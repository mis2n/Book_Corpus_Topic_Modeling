FOREWORD 
Mopern principles involved in teaching geography 
by problems and projects, and concrete examples of 
teaching the subject by means of these principles, 
are contained in this book. To teach geography by 
problems and projects requires materials other than 
the geography text. Among these materials, books 
of reference are necessary. Therefore, in the chap- 
ters that follow, lists of references will frequently 
be found, and these show abbreviations for those 
publishers referred to most often. In appendix 
E, the index to these abbreviations is printed. 
This book ought to prove helpful to teachers 
by assisting to vitalize the subject of geography. 
Since geography provides specific knowledge of wide 
application to life’s problems and furnishes useful 
methods of investigation, and fosters a lofty spirit 
of patriotism, the possibilities of the subject are 
great indeed. It therefore becomes a privilege to 
assist, by means of this book, in its rightful applica- 
tion and merited extension. 
The ideas expressed are largely the result of ob- 
servation and successful teaching in class rooms. 
Many teachers, therefore, will recognize their contri- 
butions to these pages. In this regard, I desire to 
mention especially the assistance of Misses Emma

  INTRODUCTION 
Scoot geography, very gradually and with diffi- 
culty, is getting rid of some of the foreign matter with 
which it has been obscured during the past. While 
there are a number of reasons for this: development, 
the one which appears to be of the greatest im- 
portance is the popular disclosure of that wonderful 
story of what man has accomplished in various por- 
tions of the world. This progress has been suffi- 
ciently interesting to gain and to hold the attention 
of many; but somehow teachers have missed this 
element of interest in the geographical story, and for 
many years have been teaching in classrooms a mass 
of facts devoid of interest and lacking in most of 
those elements which create a zest for knowledge. 
Through the instruction that most of us received 
we thought of geography as concerned only with 
the names of countries, capitals, rivers, mountains, 
and seas. Definitions demanded the major emphasis 
and the geography of the grammar school consisted 
of exercises mainly composed of “bounding” coun- 
tries which we could scarcely recognize on the map. 
In the high school the subject was not of sufficient 
importance to obtain a place in the program. Those 
of us who passed on into college caught glimpses 
of the theme when we heard talk of monsoons and 
xv

xvi INTRODUCTION 
isotherms, alluvial deposits and processes of erosion, 
but we were relieved that nothing was said of capitals 
and cities and towns, while those of us who now know 
better are astonished that we heard absolutely noth- 
ing of man and his work. 
This sort of geographical study, to say the least, 
did not function. When the war came on, educated 
people felt puzzled enough at the very names of 
places which appeared, indicating daily where the 
military operations were being carried on. The 
dust was blown from old atlases by intelligent men 
seeking information for the purpose of following these 
international questions which, for a period of five 
years, absorbed the attention of us all. 
The importance of geography to our nation is 
increasing. Whether we would have it or not, we 
are no longer a provincial people. The very fact 
that we entered the World War has helped to banish 
isolation and provincialism. Rapid transportation 
by railroad, by steamship and by air, has also 
assisted in bringing to the minds of thoughtful people 
the futility of continuing to adhere to such a policy. 
We may not play the réle of recluse any longer. 
Every question presented to the Conference at 
Versailles had a geographical background. The 
political representatives of new states brought 
with them to the Conference facts of importance 
about languages, races, and peoples. They argued 
in detail, eloquently presenting claims based on the 
former extent of their territorial possessions. Ethno-

reached conclusions founded on geographical facts, 
with products of the soil and the distribution of 
minerals holding a large place in the final settle- 
ments. Previously the great military leaders of 
the Allies, who were fighting for the liberty of the 
world on French soil, had planned their campaigns, 
not in terms of armaments alone, but also of strategic 
geographical points. 
Our manufactures and commerce have grown 
vastly since 1890. We do a ten or twelve-billion- 
dollar foreign trade now, and are just beginning to 
take stock of things. It is our job to do the manu- 
facturing for half the world’s foreign commerce; 
and the training of men for foreign trade is a per- 
manent obligation now confronting us. As a com- 
mercial nation, charged with world responsibility, 
we must feel the necessity for developing a knowledge 
of those principles which govern the production of 
raw materials and their distribution to the markets 
of the world. This field is commonly known as 
commercial geography, influencing to no mean degree 
the public school grade curriculum even now. 
All of these things have made it very clear that the 
essential problems of civilization are matters con- 
cerned with human geography. Necessities of the 
future argue still more urgently for the establishment 
of geographical teaching in our schools, which shall 
be different from that of the past, in regard to 
method, extent, and content. The needs of the 
business world alone will call for instruction which 
will include the study of geography on a very 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  xviii INTRODUCTION 
extensive scale. The study of controlling factors 
in the life of peoples which includes population, 
natural resources, and the commercial possibilities of 
nations, in a way which is vitally interesting, must 
necessarily gain headway. Languages, distribu- 
tion of peoples, climates, manners and customs, 
forms of government, transportation and com- 
munication, will enter the courses of study of our 
higher institutions so as to contribute to the ultimate 
solution of the problems of society. 
While geography is of direct and immediate 
technical vocational service for only a few vocations 
as we know them, nevertheless the classification of 
vocations grows apace, and with this increment there 
is an attendant extension of a necessity for this 
geographical instruction. But this is not for our 
discussion. Let us observe, while passing, however, 
that the “geographical division of the world from 
the view of overseas commerce has little in common 
with the old continental division of the globe with 
which we are familiar from our school geographies. 
On a moment’s notice, such formal division will ap- 
pear in all its absurdity from the commercial stand- 
point.”? 
Those who have already realized the condition 
in which this subject finds itself, have applied them- 
selves to find the remedies. The doctrine of interest 
has been the first element practised. It has not had 
an easy road in the elementary schools, for it has

met with criticism from parents and with inertia 
from some school principals and most boards. Re- 
lics of past instruction obtrude themselves with 
persistency between the efforts of progressive teach- 
ers trying to apply this remedy. The parent 
declares that his child ought to know where all 
kinds of places are, or what are the boundaries of this 
or that country, if, indeed, he cares enough to express 
himself concerning the education of his child. As 
a matter of fact, it is not nearly so necessary for one 
to know where Melbourne is, as it is essential that one 
know how to find out where it is; and when one has 
found this out, to know immediately a good deal 
about Melbourne because of this very knowledge of 
the location. Just where is so-and-so and what is 
so-and-so noted for, are not nearly so formidable as 
they were in the past.

CHAPTER I 
PRESENT PRACTICE 
I. Question-and-answer method.—Survey re- 
ports from cities and states all over the United 
States lead us to believe that geography is the most 
neglected as well as the most poorly taught of school 
subjects. Since this is true, teachers everywhere 
should apply themselves to the task of learning how 
to teach it by becoming interested in the most 
effective methods of presentation. 
Various school surveys have been made in recent 
years.! These surveys tell us that there is generally 
an average poorness about the teaching of geography. 
The trouble is not difficult of diagnosis: the teacher 
assigns the pupils a certain number of pages or para- 
graphs in the text and questions them the next day. 
Judging from the statements made in these surveys, 
geography appears to foot the list of school subjects 
when pedagogy approaching an ideal is considered. 
Practically all the findings show that the teaching of 
geography is repressive rather than instructive, 
lifeless rather than vital. One of the critics stated, 
when he had occasion to speak of the misuse of text-

books, “The children read over the assignment 
chiefly with a view of finding the answers to the ques- 
tions printed at the end of the section.’? According 
to the evidence in all of the surveys, this seems to be a 
rather widespread practice in teaching. This critic 
continues: “The teacher, with the book in hand, put 
seriatim the above-mentioned questions, occasionally 
adding one or more on her own initiative. The 
answers of the children were brief and deficient in 
detail; this whether they remembered for the 
moment what the text contained, or whether they 
read the answers from the open book before them. 
The teacher usually added very little; there 
was little or no class discussion; outside reading was 
seldom required.” 
Another critic declares: “The teachers use the 
blackboard very little for illustrative sketching, for 
rapid drawings and diagrams and for various modes 
of graphic representation. Where teachers fail to do 
this they fail to cultivate the habit in children.” 
“Tn another city,” he says, “maps and globes were 
seldom used, pictures sparingly, and specimens very 
rarely.’’® 
It requires a considerable expenditure of money 
to procure such articles as sand tables, slate globes, 
supplementary books, pictures, maps, and speci- 
mens. That the appearance of such material in 
classrooms is entirely too rare we are informed by the

numerous critics of educational practice. We are 
told that a certain superintendent did not believe in 
publishing even a course of study in geography, be- 
cause he had provided the best text on the market. 
He had given it to the teachers to follow, and he 
expected them to follow it implicitly. 
2. Lines of least resistance.—Textbook geo- 
graphy teaching is simply the result of following the 
lines of least resistance. Teachers who have relied 
upon the book in spelling, arithmetic, and reading to 
supply all the material for the recitation, fail to 
realize that the geography text needs to be handled 
differently if it is to be made vital. In part, at 
least, the textbook is but one of a number of re- 
ference books, and should be used as such to assist, in 
gathering information about problems. Materials, 
like maps and projects, help to develop initiative, 
but supplementary books should now be regarded as 
so essential that it is difficult to discriminate between 
the text or basal book and the supplementary in 
geography. 
Everyone knows that it is easier to follow the text- 
book, asking questions based upon lessons. This 
method is far simpler than planning for discussions 
rather than recitations; for study rather than memor- 
izing; and for all the good things that enter into 
modern teaching. To be specific, it is an easier 
task for one to assign a lesson in the text about 
“Italy” than it is to choose a good problem in- 
volving the appropriate selection of the distinct 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  4 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
(Characteristics which make Italy important for the 
| world’s work; it is easier than arranging the minor 
‘problems; it is easier than providing adequate maps; 
it is easier than guiding pupils into skilful and effec- 
) tive habits of reasoning and study. It takes time to 
search for pictures that shed light upon the reading 
matter, and it requires energy and intelligence to 
plan map work. To teach differently an apparently 
despised subject demands application and grit. 
3- Typography and cartography.—Photography, 
including the color process, typography, and carto- 
graphy have attained a high degree of perfection. 
All of these arts, employed by the American text in 
geography, are extremely helpful in providing many 
kinds of interesting and instructive material for 
school pupils. 
Combined with these visual aids to instruction, 
which make the texts very attractive, to say the 
least, either the type or topical method of presenta- 
tion is employed in modern’ school books. Never- 
theless, many supplementary readers of a general 
descriptive character, of industry and commerce, 
physical, scenic and nature readers, have ready sales 
when placed on the market. All of them are de- 
signed to enrich the textbook presentation, Some 
geographies have sought to incorporate as much 
of this supplementary material as the pages of the 
book were capable of containing, and in this way 
amplified the type method. 
Besides these aids, teachers here and there are
-P-A-G-E-29
PRESENT PRACTICE 5 
using pictures, publications, experiments, stere- 
opticons, desk outline maps, and other aids to the 
presentation of lessons. 
Without immediate commentary upon the visual 
aids mentioned above, let us direct our present at- 
tention to the value of the type and topical methods 
of presentation. 
4. Type and topical methods.—A type study, 
as at present used, is concerned with some in- 
dustry, such as the growing of corn, in which the 
salient facts, illustrated with appropriate cuts, are 
developed by map study, topography, climate, 
vegetation, and similar subjects relating to the 
industry, thus setting forth one of the main activities 
of the world’s work. This type presentation has 
occupied a large part of the pedagogical treatment of 
geography during the last decade. Indian corn or 
maize is treated as follows in one of the standard 
textbooks:¢ 
Extent to which tt is ratsed: 
Corn is raised in most of the states of the Union, 
and you have already learned how important it is in 
the South. It is in the Central States, however, 
that we find the greatest amount. The corn belt 
of the country extends from Ohio to central Kansas 
and Nebraska, with smaller quantities raised to the 
north, south, east, and west of it. Farmers within 
this belt usually expect to devote from one third to 
one half of their land to corn; therefore, in traveling

6 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
across these states in summer, one sees corn-fields in 
every direction. 
How it is cultivated and harvested: 
The seed is planted in rows in the springtime. 
Soon the little stalks appear above ground, growing 
rapidly during the hot summer months, until they 
reach a height of from seven to ten feet. In order 
to keep the soil loose, and kill the weeds, the ground 
between the rows is plowed when the corn is young; 
but as it grows higher, the shade of its leaves pro- 
tects the soil from both drought and weeds. 
A corn-field usually presents the most beautiful 
appearance in July, when the corn “‘tassels out.” 
. The plants then entirely hide the ground from view, 
and the rich green stalks, with their long, slender 
leaves, bend to the breezes in the most graceful 
manner. 
If the stalk is to be used as fodder for cattle in 
winter, it is cut before frost, when the kernels on the 
cob are still somewhat soft and milky. If left until 
after frost, the grain hardens, and then the harvest 
season begins. Men drive into the fields in wagons 
and tear the husks from the ear, spending day after 
day at that kind of work. 
Its uses: 
Corn is put to many uses. Much that is raised 
is fed to cattle and hogs, as already stated. Some is 
made into hominy and breakfast foods, or into corn 
meal. Starch is another product. . . . . 
While topical studies are type studies, the types 
selected are representative classes.. The topical 
method, in seeking orientation from textbook treat- 
ment, involves consideration of practically any 
feature of geographical study; and when necessary,
-P-A-G-E-31
PRESENT PRACTICE q 
several of the same class of things. Syllabi, or 
courses of study, are usually presented by topics 
for consideration, and, in general, “reviews” are 
topical in treatment, following logical arrangement. 
The topical method as an outline of the main 
features of study can be made interesting and in- 
tensive in nature, pointing to bibliographical data 
and suggesting aids to study. The following il- 
lustrates the topical method of treatment:® 
Tut Rocky Mountains 
Positron; Surracr. The Rocky Mountains, as we 
have seen, are the high mountain wall bordering the 
Great Central Plain on the west. The surface is 
rugged, the slopes are steep and long, and the passes 
are high. Yet, though the Rocky Mountains do 
not offer many opportunities for travel, they were, 
during the time of the exploration of the West, by 
no means so difficult a barrier as the arid plains to 
the east and the deserts of the West. 
Cuimate; Inpustries. The climate is cold and 
moist, with the heaviest rainfall on the western 
slopes. The rocks contain silver and other metals in 
abundance, so that mining is the chief industry. 
Grazing is the only other occupation of importance, 
though lumbering is carried on in some regions. 
Popunation; Scenery. Large cities have grown 
up about the mining centers. Elsewhere the 
population is found mostly in the occasional moun- 
tain valleys, especially in the high, level “parks” 
of Colorado and New Mexico. In the less populated 
regions wild animals, like bears and mountain sheep,

are numerous, so that portions of the area are fav- 
orite resorts for sportsmen. 
The Yellowstone National Park, famous for its 
hot springs and geysers, lies in the Rocky Mountain 
region. It is very picturesque, and is much vis- 
ited by tourists from all parts of the world. 
To some the type method seems superior to the 
topical method, because, it is argued, there is 
generally a more careful discrimination in selection 
when the type method is used, in order that repre- 
sentative classes may be considered. Topics may 
be very numerous; and, indeed, when that method 
was in vogue, the type method came into use to 
reduce the number of topics. 
The material contained in topical and i studies 
can be effectively employed in the teaching of 
geography. The organization of geographical mater- 
ial about a country or region is generally grouped 
around topics: climate, vegetation, minerals, manu- 
facturing, people, communication and transportation; 
and information about some specific material of 
these topics is contained in type studies. Let it be 
assumed that a somewhat exhaustive treatment can 
be made by the organization of facts in logical 
sequence about these topics. It then remains to 
comment upon and to study each one of these topics 
to understand their salient characteristics. In- 
formation gained in reading, from supplementary 
material, projects, and the textbook should be 
organized in some convenient and impressive manner 
for use in the solution of problems.
-P-A-G-E-33
PRESENT PRACTICE 9 
5. Topical organization presented.—Climate. 
Knowledge of the climate of a region is necessary 
for the geographical comprehension of it, yet data 
about climate seem to be the least real to a pupil 
of all the geographic influences about which he 
studies. Technical terms involved in the study of 
climate, like long period changes, isobars, isotherms, 
currents, averages, and numerical data, tend to 
obscure the reality. Pupils do not readily attain a 
thorough grasp of the significance of climatic in- 
vestigation. In all probability, and practice bears it 
out, it is better to present climatic conditions in 
relation to large areas and with reference to broad 
distinctions, suggestive of the effects of climate 
on the life of man or on phenomena connected with 
life, than to deal with an abstract study of climate. 
Concretely put, such questions as the following 
typify the point under consideration: 
1. Which country is warmer, England, or Japan. 
or India? Why? 
2. What parts of the United States are coolest 
in summer, coldest in winter? Rainiest? Why? 
8. Compare the climate of the Mediterranean 
Sea with that of the Indian Ocean. 
4. Describe the various kinds of climate that 
one would meet if he attempted to traverse a 
certain continent from north to south. 
Since this question receives further emphasis 
elsewhere in this book,‘ let us for the time being be 
content with this meager presentation. 
®See Appendix C.  
-P-A-G-E-34
    10 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Vegetation Development of the pupil’s knowl. 
edge about the vegetation of any region depends, in 
large measure, upon his familiarity with the climate 
of that region; and attention should be directed to 
the results which the control of vegetation yields 
to humanity. The importance of this can not be 
over-emphasized. But this does not imply that 
pupils should be allowed to deal in vague generalities 
about this subject. When one is handling a problem 
he must adduce evidence to that problem in clear, 
concise, and explanatory language, sufficient to 
convince his hearers that he knows what he is 
talking about and that he knows enough about it. 
In consideration of the problems involved in the fol- 
lowing statements, for example: Many cattle are 
raised in the Argentine, many sheep are raised in 
Australia, much wheat is grown in the United 
States; there should arise the following type-ques- 
tions which should succeed in bringing out important 
knowledge about vegetation: What great natural 
vegetation region has been altered to suit these forms 
of human activity? What is being done with the 
products? 
Minerals.—Often time is devoted to false con- 
siderations. To the scientist an examination of a 
geological survey will not fail to disclose the fact that 
certain portions of a country are rich in minerals; 
but to the teacher of geography the study of these 
same portions reveals the truth that unless a section 
is “worked” to produce minerals for the use of 
the world, it is of little value for geographical con-
-P-A-G-E-35

sideration, even though the potential wealth be 
fabulous. While minerals may be classed as an asset 
to a country or region, unless this commodity plays 
an important réle in the affairs of the life of the 
people, the mineral resources need not be studied 
per se. China and India possess valuable minerals; 
but, owing to the lack of ambition of the natives 
and to the present inaccessibility of these minerals, 
only a passing thought needs to be directed to the 
mineral wealth of such countries. On the other 
hand, Hungary, shorn of a large part of her former 
territory, must depend now upon Czecho-Slovakia 
for her coal. Czecho-Slovakia, then, on account of 
her mineral wealth, assumes importance in respect to 
this resource. 
Manufacturing—There is not time, so far as 
school geography is concerned, to investigate manu- 
facturing except in a superficial manner, and in rela- 
tion to a wide outlook, such as that which char- 
acterizes the study of climate, vegetation, and 
minerals. The importance of manufactures in gen- 
eral to the needs of the world and the development of 
machinery practically to perfection, are the salient 
features of manufacturing to be considered. It is 
to the condition of the worker that attention is now 
being directed, so that, through education, he may 
be brought to his maximum capacity to handle 
machinery. Skilled workmen are a tremendous 
asset to a country or to any section of it. For 
instance, around Boston many shoes are made, 
not, as earlier geography teaching would have us

12 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
believe, because of proximity to the raw material 
(as a matter of fact, hides are produced far away 
from Massachusetts towns), or because of Boston’s 
superior shipping facilities, or yet because of water 
power for manufacturing purposes, but because 
certain Massachusetts towns are filled with skilled 
| workmen, and the raw material goes tothem. What 
then, is most essential to carry on this industry 
successfully? 
' People.—The character of the people who inhabit 
a particular region is of much importance for geo- 
graphical study. Knowledge of the characteristics of 
people is often gained through a study of the condi- 
tions that surround them, the climate in which they 
live, the food they eat, their houses, the government 
under which they live, etc. 
Take, for example, the question, Why has the 
Russian left his country to make his home in Amer- 
ica? His government has been one of despotism, 
with a strict censorship; secret police service has 
been maintained; freedom of the press has been pro- 
hibited; public meetings have not been allowed. 
He has suffered from a vile prison system, and 
the Jews, Catholics, Armenians, and Baptists have 
undergone religious persecution. Furthermore, it is 
true that the average Russian is illiterate, for 
educational opportunity in Russia depended upon 
the parent’s position in life. Peasant boys and 
girls rarely attended school; sometimes they were 
allowed to go when they could be spared from home. 
Even then, they were taught by poorly paid teachers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
PRESENT PRACTICE 18 
just as poorly equipped for teaching. Buildings, 
homes, and equipment were miserable; and the huts 
in which the peasants lived had little or no ventila- 
tion. This condition was evidently the result of 
poverty and serfdom for over three hundred years. 
The land in Russia has been poorly cultivated; 
fertilizer has seldom been used; little attention has 
been paid to rotation of crops; inferior tools and farm 
machinery have been employed; and a general dis- 
like for country life existed particularly among the 
upper classes. Climatic conditions are not favor- 
able to comfortable living. Cold winds blow from 
the north, and the evenings in winter are cold and 
long. In this inhospitable climate the industries 
have been poorly developed. The peasant farms 
have been small, often too small to support a family. 
Home industries favored by the long winter even- 
ings, rather than a factory system have been pre- 
valent. Such inferior manufacturing conditions 
caused low wages to be paid; in fact, the Russian only 
received about ten cents a day for his labor.

Russia,” in “Little People Everywhere Series” (Ed. Pub.). 
In some such way as this, when a concrete state- 
ment is given of conditions which influence a certain 
group of people, children can be led to appreciate 
generalizations of characteristics of people. It is 
doubtful if the average textbook in geography sup- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
    
14 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
plies such information. Hither the teacher must 
supply it or the pupils must secure it through what 
is called, or rather miscalled, supplementary reading. 
Broadly speaking, people, in respect to occupa- 
tions, are divided, geographically, into two classes: 
those who are controlled by their environment and 
those who, by control of their environment, are 
engaged in occupations of world-wide importance. 
The Eskimos represent the former class; the cattle- 
men of the Argentine the latter. 
Communication and transportation.—Communica- 
tion and transportation are very important to our 
civilization; our railroads are even more closely linked 
- to our lives than the telephone. While limited 
telephone service is inconvenient, restricted trans- 
portation service can cause actual suffering, since 
the handling of food and fuel is essential to our exis- 
tence. Transportation by means of electricity and 
oil is greatly increasing. One is often heard to 
remark that it is difficult to imagine how people got 
along without typewriters, railways, telegraph sys- 
tems, telephones, printing presses, and similar 
necessities. All these modern methods of communi- 
cation have been made possible through inventions 
and discoveries, and these have materially changed 
the character and manner of living in the world at 
large, having in some sections brought about a 
complete revolution. By 1880, for example, the fac- 
tory had gained precedence over farming in England, 
even though at that time her farmers were making 
excellent wages, for the simple reason that means and
-P-A-G-E-39
PRESENT PRACTICE 15 
methods of communication abroad so improved that 
she could obtain food supplies from the outside world 
cheaper than she could produce these at home. 
In the North Central Plains of the United States 
farming is the leading industry. Comprising one 
fourth of the area of the United States, and one third 
of the people, this section raises half the food; half 
of the cows and horses, and three fourths of the corn 
produced in this country. These plains supply our 
country’s food in much the same way as New Eng- 
land provides manufactures and handles commerce. 
Routes of transportation are more numerous here 
than in any other equally large region in any part 
of the world, except in the western lowland of 
Europe. Given an intelligent, progressive people, 
with a favorable environment, and with fully 
developed transportation facilities, the economic 
prosperity of any section is unquestionably assured.” 
While during the last decade the human factor in 
geography has received considerable emphasis, physi- 
cal geography previously had forced its neglect. 
The human factor, in the new texts, is now beginning 
to receive merited attention.’ Besides the emphasis 
given in these texts to this element of interest, they 
are also excellent in such pedagogical principles as 
correlation with other subjects of the curriculum, 
topical and type studies and comparative reviews, 
all of which afford opportunities for skilful presenta- 
tions of the subject.

6. Maps.—From various sources, maps depicting 
the facts and principles briefly sketched in the above 
sections are available. World maps connected with 
climate, showing the mean annual temperature, heat 
belts in relation to countries, winds and tempera- 
tures for the various months of the year, mean 
annual rainfall, atmospheric pressure, winds and 
ocean currents; those relating to the distribution of 
vegetation regions and mineral products; others with 
industrial regions, density of population, regions of 
largest commerce, regions of important commerce, 
telegraph and ocean cables, and much other informa- 
tion are usually presented in the best textbooks; 
and teachers often neglect them. The problem 
before teachers, besides acquiring enough up-to-date 
maps, consists in acquainting pupils not only with 
the proper use of them, but also with the method 
of skilful interpretation of them. Good, modern 
maps, properly understood and interpreted by 
teachers, can be made to serve as one of the most 
important and instructive elements of the subject. 
In this connection, it is well to emphasize the im- 
portance of the exercise of having pupils visualize 
product maps of the United States, and then re- 
produce them from memory in colors, on desk 
outline maps.

CHAPTER II 
THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 
1. Regional rather than political geography.— 
The first regional treatment, really, is home geog- 
raphy because this demands an intimate study, 
in some well-defined geographical unit, of man and 
his surroundings. Any study is regional in char- 
acter which involves a careful study of a portion of 
the earth, uniform in regard to certain features like 
climate, topography, vegetation, resources, and oc- 
cupations. According to the conception of geog- 
raphy which we have already sought to establish, 
the story of man’s control of different regions in the 
interest of world needs must be a constant factor 
throughout the study of the subject. In a region of 
homogeneity, like purposes dominate people, and 
cooperation is likely to follow when people are bound 
together by the ties of common interests. 
By means of the regional method of study, the 
opportunity is afforded to discard the cut-and-dried 
outline of position, coastline, surface, climate, etc., 
and that consequent mechanical presentation, in 
which no account is given of the significance of each 
factor in relation to the other factors making up the 
region’s characteristics. 
1s
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 19 
This regional method of study is both physio- 
graphic and economic, in proportion as it emphasizes 
the physiography of the section under consideration 
and the human aspects or the commercial and in- 
dustrial activities of men. Political boundaries are 
not observed in the regional treatment. 
This regional treatment of geography, using the 
problem method of approach, is best illustrated by a 
recent publication of the Massachusetts Board of 
Education, entitled “The Teachers’ Manual of 
Geography for Grades VII and VIII.” (See Ap- 
pendix A., pp. 263-278). This manual is noted for the 
emphasis it places on regional geography. In respect 
to aim and purpose, the authors assign to geography 
a high rank in the curriculum as is evidenced by the 
following: ‘It [the subject of geography] applies 
so widely to the immediate problems of human life, 
it possesses so broad a cultural value, and is so im- 
portant in developing powers of reasoning, of in- 
vestigation and of initiative that the committee 
feels that it deserves a prominent place in the upper 
grades or in the Junior High School.” 
2. Emphasis upon and limitation of material_— 
The modern teacher, who wishes to make geography 
vital to the lives of pupils, is not primarily interested 
in topographical knowledge for its own sake. In 
other words, it is not her purpose to provide her 
pupils simply with the names of cities, countries, 
capes, and bays. Nor should it be her intention to 
follow the lines of least resistance, but rather should
-P-A-G-E-44
  20 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
she seek to make the subject absorbingly interesting 
and appealing. In order that this purpose may be 
accomplished, not only is the source of subject 
matter a question of importance, but the reason for 
teaching the subject must also be clearly defined. 
Geography relies upon the current activities of men 
to give it life. On account of the multitude of such 
activities, with the interest of pupils naturally 
focused upon the world where men are busy with 
the accomplishment of purposes and where the adap- © 
tation of their knowledge to physical environment 
is being achieved, if interest is to be maintained, 
there must be both proper limitation and careful 
selection of the items taught, together with central- 
ization around as few major subjects as possible. 
The main part of geographical teaching consists in 
building up a steadily increasing, but gradually 
formed idea about the world’s workers and the kind, 
the amount, and the quality of work they do. The 
type of presentation followed should assist pupils to, 
acquire an outlook in due perspective upon the 
whole world as the home of man where some places 
are of more importance than others because the work 
which is being done in those places and the results 
which are being accomplished are more valuable to 
mankind. 
From such a point of view the comparative 
handful of people in Holland assume importance out 
of all proportion to their numbers in comparison with 
the millions either of Africa or of India. Stated in 
problem form as the main problem, the idea can be
-P-A-G-E-45
THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 21 
illustrated by considering: What can we learn from 
the smaller countries of Europe? Holland, one of 
these countries, comes in for its share of considera- 
tion by the minor problem: What effect does the sea 
have upon Holland? The brief statements that fol- 
low point to the salient features which should receive 
attention in the solution of the problem. 
The sea takes away land from the people of 
Holland; it destroys their property; it endangers 
their lives; it checks their rivers; it makes necessary 
enormous expense to stop its inroads. Hence, the 
people have to defend themselves by building dikes 
and sea walls, by making canals for drainage, by 
pumping the water out of the country, by planting 
grass in sand dunes, and by keeping watchmen on the 
dikes. 
The sea affects the character of the people. Being 
constantly exposed to danger, they develop bravery. 
Since they are compelled to use everything to good 
purpose, they are economical and thrifty. Because 
they must work hard they are industrious. From 
long waiting and working they are patient. Since 
they have to struggle to defend their country from 
the elements, they are patriotic. Because they 
have to depend upon one another for common defence 
and the necessities of life, there is unity of spirit. 
There is self control because of discipline, and there 
is skill because of long experience in work. 
Besides the things mentioned above, the sea af- 
fects the industries of Holland. It not only makes 
sailors and fishermen, but it also produces merchants.
-P-A-G-E-46
  22 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
It also causes the people to manufacture articles. 
At first they made things with their hands, but later 
on, when coal and machinery were brought into the 
country by their hardy sailors, they began to man- 
ufacture many things in factories. While they do 
some manufacturing, the nation at large consists 
mainly of farmers and cattle raisers.

Could such lessons be learned from a study of the 
whole of Africa? This and more minor problems 
about the smaller countries of Europe form the 
questions which, when answered, would solve the 
main problem: What can we learn from the smaller 
countries of Europe? 
3- The world’s needs.—Character of information. 
It is well said that education must prepare all 
men for mutual aid, each to codperate in the best 
possible way. In the broad sense of thinking about 
morality as thought and action that promote the 
improvement and satisfaction of human needs, 
geography lends itself to specific treatment for the 
appreciation of such a principle. Usefulness or 
service is one of the great characteristics of morality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
_ THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 23 
Honesty and courage—habits which are necessary 
for those who render service—definitely performed 
for the benefit of the world receive considerable 
emphasis in this absorbing story, while injustice and 
cruelty—wrong habits of action in nations as well 
as in individuals, vicious tendencies that interfere 
with the progress of peoples—are taught to be de- 
spised in this great drama of every-day life. 
For purposes of instruction the old geography 
considered each country with equal emphasis. Thus, 
China was equally as important for study as Eng- 
land, France, or the United States. China does 
possess to a considerable extent all the natural ad- 
vantages of the United States. The pupils can 
find that the country has long, navigable rivers such 
as the Yangtze and Hwang; that there is variety of 
climate; that the area is large; that it has many 
natural resources—minerals, agriculture, forests, 
and fisheries; and that the coastline is favorable for 
harbors and communication. Yet, when the ques- 
tion is asked: With all these advantages, why has 
China progressed so slowly? the principles contained 
in the new geography demand a modification of 
such an antiquated perspective. Seeking a proper 
solution of this problem, the pupils, observing the 
change in the form of government, now learn that 
there are signs of awakening in this great country. 
The Chinese have introduced the telephone and the 
telegraph; they have opened their ports to foreign 
trade, exporting and importing between Japan, 
Great Britain, and the United States; and they have  
-P-A-G-E-48
  24 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
large cities like Shanghai, Hongkong, Hankow, with 
Pekin the seat of government and the gateway to 
Mongolia and Manchuria. On the other hand, the 
Chinese retain century-old ways of carrying passen- 
gers and hauling freight. While we owe to them the 
origin of printing, the art of pottery, and the dis- 
covery of gunpowder, as a people they are relatively 
unimportant as large factors in supplying the wants 
and needs of the world. Breaking habits is even 
more difficult for a nation than for an individual, and 
the men and women in power in China belong to the 
older generation, to whom custom is endeared by 
long familiarity. 
Conservation..—By means of geography one should 
learn that not only are man’s needs ever increasing 
but also how much these needs have been enlarged, 
and how they are being satisfied. While it is neces- 
sary that attention be directed to the manner in 
which people once lived, especially when they were 
surrounded by resources which were practically un- 
tapped, the greater emphasis should be placed upon 
how people now, under new conditions, live and 
work. For instance, in the early days of our 
country, our government lavishly disposed of its 
unoccupied lands because they were believed to be 
practically inexhaustible. One of our presidents 
predicted that it would take six hundred years 
for our great West to develop to its capacity; but in 
1A pamphlet, Lessons in Community and National Life, Series C, 
Chapter II, pp. 41-72, Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C., contains 
material on this subject. This pamphlet can be secured from the Super- 
intendent of Public Docunents.
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 25 
less than twenty-five years after this calculation, the 
menace of exhaustion of our forests alone was so 
great that Congress authorized the withdrawal of 
timber lands from public sale; and, later, this author- 
ization was extended to mineral lands and coal 
fields (especially in Alaska). So it happened that 
the government claimed for federal use, forest and 
mineral reservations of about 150,000 acres. Under 
the beneficent operation of the sale of irrigated lands 
by the government to settlers at moderate prices, 
land which was once worth only a few cents an acre 
and fit only for cattle grazing, has become worth 
several hundred dollars an acre for purposes of 
agriculture. 
Enlarged production for the needs of the world and 
wise consumption of the world’s supplies offer many 
new and increasing problems. Modern science has 
done much in showing men how to conserve good 
soil and how to restore poor land. Modern science 
has also helped to banish ignorance of the value of 
things which were once wasted. For instance, cotton 
seed, once allowed to rot, is now made to yield 
valuable oil and cattle food. A black, pithy sub- 
stance, known as coal tar, was once regarded as 
worthless, but ways have been discovered whereby 
dyes and other valuable products such as aspirin, 
wintergreen, and saccharin are obtained from it, 
thus making it worth as much as or more than 
lump coal. Corn products have been multiplied at 
an astonishing rate. 
The sharp eye of science is constantly on the look-
-P-A-G-E-50
  26 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
out for the utilization of waste material for the 
«world’s needs. Left to themselves, the natives of the 
Malay Peninsula would hardly realize the value of 
the rubber that grows there. Yet, only recently, 
scientists have extracted an oil from the Para rubber 
seed which, it is declared, can be used in the manu-, 
facture of paints, varnishes, linoleum, and soft soaps. 
The residue of the seed, after the oil is extracted, it is 
asserted, can be converted into a feeding cake for 
cattle and other stock. The value of such an in- 
dustry can well be appreciated when one is informed 
that in the British Malay possessions alone, rubber 
estates own two million acres of land, of which area 
more than one million are planted in Para trees; and 
that the quantity of seeds thrown off each year 
by the rubber trees averages about three pounds to 
the acre. 
While the world has undergone a most horrible 
experience at the hands of Imperial Germany, those 
who would listen to the story of this empire can 
gain some valuable lessons. Not only is economy 
the dominant idea in agriculture, in terracing and 
using the mountain sides for orchards and cattle, in 
eliminating wood patches and using every available 
space for products, in studying conditions of soil and 
climate and planting suitable crops, and of improving 
land wherever possible, but even in forestry, the 
Germans have, for a long time, led the thought and 
practice of the world with conservation as the 
prevailing idea. Not only do they plant trees for 
future use, but they also protect what they have from.
-P-A-G-E-51
  
' THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 27 
destruction by fire. The Hohenzollern Government, 
in the Imperial reservations, preserved the young 
trees, and taught lessons of careful forestry, such as 
clearing undergrowth and wooded lands, and created 
legislation for the protection of game and birds. 
Dr. Edward E. Slosson says: ‘We now call the 
Germans wasteful of human life, and we are right. 
They used to call us so. When the Prussian Minister 
of Commerce visited the United States some years 
ago, he reported that we were ‘very careless about 
the life and health of the working classes; in the 
largest works the precautions against accident are of 
the most primitive kind.’ We must remember that 
the reason. the German Government could sacrifice 
men and money so lavishly in war was because this 
same government had for fifty years devoted itself 
assiduously to the up-building of a rich and populous 
nation. A country much smaller than Texas and 
with few natural advantages has been brought into 
the foremost rank of world powers in commerce and 
industry, in science and arts.’”? 
All of these illustrations show that, in order to 
supply the needs of the world, men must use the re- 
sources about them in the most economical way; that 
they must increase production by means of conserva- 
tion; and that, by wise consumption, they must 
make the wealth of the world “go around” to all. 
The teacher of geography should be vitally con-

28 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
cerned with the effort to teach pupils the world’s need 
for conservation as a necessary activity in the safe 
conquest of the environment. 
Interdependence.—While no brief is being held 
here for the so-called internationalism as opposed 
to nationalism, teachers should seek to impart, by 
first obtaining it themselves, a broad geographical 
outlook gained by an intimate contact and ac- 
quaintance with geographical literature. The world 
is an interdependent group of peoples. No subject 
in the school curriculum teaches this fact better than 
does geography. It is a dull brain indeed that cannot 
appreciate the fact that the densely populated dis- 
tricts of our own country—for instance the factory 
district of New England, where the people’s energies 
are devoted to manufacturing and not to agriculture 
—must receive food from some other section of the 
country, and that the most accessible, both by nature 
and by engineering, is that area known as the 
prairies. From this fertile region, wheat, barley, 
oats, rye, sheep, and cattle supply the needs of the 
crowded New England states. Although thousands 
of miles separate the men who live on the prairies of 
America from those who live and toil in the fields of 
Australia, nevertheless the law of supply and de- 
mand for their products establishes a mutual rela- 
tionship between these countries. Geography must 
teach that the prosperity and livelihood of one kind 
of worker are bound up with the prosperity and liveli- 
hood of another. A study of this relationship 
leads the pupil into a field of inquiry about interna:
-P-A-G-E-53
THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 29 
tional relationships. One thus learns not only 
that tea comes from Japan and China, rubber from 
tropical countries, a great deal of wheat from 
southern Russia, and nitrate from Chile, but also how, 
when one country can supply the needs of the world 
for a particular commodity, this has resulted in the 
development of trade between nations, and this trade 
makes nations very dependent on one another. At 
the same time, exchange between countries makes it 
possible for everyone to share in the good things 
that the world produces. 
Emphasis upon this thought is most important. 
Let us further consider the rubber tree. Synthetic 
caoutchouc has been made in the laboratories of both 
England and Germany. It is not at all certain that 
this product can be made cheap enough to compete 
with the cultivated product, but the fact remains 
that there is an enormous demand, constantly 
growing, for this output of the trees of the African 
and South American forests. The Belgians, history 
tells us, lashed the natives of the Kongo for increased 
supply, but they drew only blood. The English 
and the Germans, foreseeing a scarcity in this com- 
modity, planted trees in their own tropical posses- 
sions. With the acquisition of Togo, Kamerun, and 
Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land, Great Britain now comes into 
possession of Germany’s supply. 
While the United States leads the world in the 
manufacture of automobiles and uses more than half 
the world’s supply of rubber, the home production 
of this article is insignificant. Yet it is said that
-P-A-G-E-54
  30 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines have most 
excellent lands for the cultivation of the tree. Be- 
sides these colonies of the United States, Central 
America and Mexico as well as the West Indies offer 
inviting fields to the American planter. In order to 
supply the needs of the world for rubber, it is 
necessary that production keep pace with consump- 
tion; and it is merely a matter of time before the 
United States, in company with these other nations, 
must necessarily enter the field of rubber produc~ 
tion, certainly in its own colonies. 
Enrichment of consciousness—The American boy, 
in particular, is interested in the life of to-day. It 
is his choice that, in his school societies, he no 
longer deals with dusty academic questions but prefers 
current affairs. Boys and girls alike read news- 
papers; they discuss present-day events. The boy is 
interested in what kind of work people do because 
he is a part of the world and he knows that what is 
going on affects him, his people, and even his own 
boy-world; and the more information he can get 
about things the more he is satisfied. Girls are no 
longer disinterested spectators in the world’s progress 
because, in modern life, they, too, look forward to a 
place in affairs. Therefore, a problem for teachers 
is to present interestingly and effectively the drama 
of the reconstructed life of peoples; and make efforts 
to inculcate a keen understanding of how the Cau- 
casian race is controlling its environment, how it 
has not permitted itself to be limited by its sur- 
roundings, how it has expanded to the uttermost

parts of the earth with conquest yet ahead, and 
many victories over environment in the past. 
Comprehension of this Caucasian expansion alone 
is enriching, for it cultivates sympathy with others 
whose needs, resources, efforts, and feelings are like 
our own. The old idea of competition has given 
way to the new idea of codperation in government, 
in business, and in industry. 
For instance, Canada’s problems are similar to our 
own. With Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and 
even South Africa we have common problems (one 
of which is immigration) and interests. England 
keeps watch over the Caribbean Sea at Jamaica 
and we have taken our post at Panama, and Porto 
Rico. In the Pacific Ocean, the United States guards 
Hawaii and the Philippines while Great Britain’s em- 
pire in the Far East embraces Singapore, Hongkong, 
and India. What goes on in France and in other 
European countries affects the industrial life of our 
own. And so it has come about that the new working 
principle is that it is better to be helping your 
neighbor than to be seeking to defeat him; for, in 
the long run, both you and your neighbor will be 
better off. Competition is the method of war; co- 
operation is the method of peace and understanding. 
Geography thus offers the opportunity, through 
the study of peoples and industries, for the cultiva- 
tion of understanding and appreciation of interde- 
pendence among individuals and social groups of the 
same type. Industrial relationship necessarily pre- 
supposes commercial reciprocity, and hence, con-
-P-A-G-E-56

sideration must be devoted to the commercial 
struggles of people who are at work to provide 
food, shelter, and clothing for the millions of workers 
in factories, machine shops, mills, and other lines of 
endeavor. 
Sociological results —When one has derived some 
conception of our American industrial and com- 
mercial organization, it is well to realize that this 
information is still incomplete. This must be ex- 
panded so as to induce a vision of this organization 
in its relation to the rest of the national structure— 
religious, political, and social. To such matters 
geography can only refer. Textbooks on pedagogy 
state that such facts can be correlated. 
Shifting values—While shifting values are char- 
acteristic of the world’s progress these changes are 
recorded in no uncertain terms. They find applica- 
tion in the very life of the people, in the daily search 
after the things worth while. Take, for instance, 
the increasing value of the tropics to those who dwell 
in the temperate zones. Tropical South America 
now is probably of more value to North America 
than North America is to South America; for we 
know now that as the population of the earth in- 
creases, and as civilization advances, the inhabitants 
of the temperate climates become necessarily de- 
pendent upon the tropics for food, shelter, and cloth- 
ing. It has been said that while the construction of 
the Panama Canal was a most remarkable en- 
gineering feat, it will sink into insignificance in com- 
parison with some projects of the future, as, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE NEW GEOGRAPHY 33 
instance, reclaiming the Amazon Valley. In that 
region where the sun shines straightest from the 
heavens to the earth, the food of the future must be 
procured. From the tropics we already get many 
valuable commodities, and all the people of the 
civilized world must receive these products in ever- 
increasing quantity. 
Political changes as a result of the World War 
have been numerous. The teacher of geography as 
well as the teacher of history is concerned with 
many of these. Elsewhere in this book reference is 
made to Miss Edith P. Parker’s study of the par- 
tition of Africa (page 77). This study was printed 
in 1919. Under date of May 14, 1921, The Literary 
Digest (page 12) contains an article, “The New 
Partition of Africa,” in which it is pointed out that, 
in this new partition, Germany, the last of the 
European Powers to acquire African territory un- 
der the former partition, is the first to be forced 
out of the continent, with England as her chief in- 
heritor; and, on page 13, a map of the New Euro- 
pean possessions in Africa is printed. This change in 
the political map of Africa and changes in the map 
of Europe as a result of the World War have, from 
time to time, appeared in numerous magazines. 
Alert teachers have grasped the opportunity of 
keeping those articles which applied to their school 
work and they have cut out and mounted those 
maps which were likely to prove serviceable. 
One finds that it is not a difficult matter to 
glean, even from a number of contemporary news-

papers, new facts of the world’s progress along 
different lines—facts which for the first time assume 
a significance not to be disregarded in case the source 
is authoritative. No less a person than Charles 
Kingsley has informed us that: “All but God is 
changing day by day.”
-P-A-G-E-59
CHAPTER II 
THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 
1. How a problem is selected.—Thoughtful and 
extensive reading forms the basis for teaching by 
problems and projects. Out of this experience \ 
teachers become prepared to construct problems. 
The greatest difficulty in the way of securing prob- 
lems lies in the fact that too much dependence is 
put upon the text and not enough upon inspiration 
and information gained from other authoritative 
sources. From a_ well-selected bibliography, a 
teacher can construct a vast number of interesting 
problems. Without adequate range in reading and 
knowledge it is exceedingly doubtful whether teach- 
ers can vitalize geography. 
In selecting a problem, one must take into consid- 
eration not only what information is to be secured, but 
also how the information can be related to present- 
day interests; and the closer these are to the interests 
_of the children, the better. For instance, the bare 
facts about the tropics might be assigned and the 
pupils required to memorize them, or the text lesson 
might be given. But it is so much better to gather 
‘information which treats of various phases of tropical 
geography, then concentrate upon one which is im- 
35
-P-A-G-E-60
  
36 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
portant and follow this by other phases of less im- 
portance. For instance it is an important fact that 
modern interest in the tropics is definitely related to 
the food supply which is available for world con- 
sumption. All nations are interested in this phase 
of tropical life. The cocoanut, a tropical fruit which 
yields an oil which provides a butter substitute, is 
of importance to the every-day interests of pupils, 
because butter, or a substitute, is a common neces- 
sity. Read what Slosson says: 
One tropical product . . . . is the meat 
of the cocoanut, known in commerce as copra. This 
was once thought fit only for soap fat, but the chemist, 
with the aid of a catalytic agent, succeeded in trans- 
forming the evil-smelling oil into a solid white and 
wholesome fat, and this has now become one of the 
chief ingredients in margerine and other substitutes 
for butter and lard in cooking and table use. This 
simple chemical reaction, which any schoolboy— 
of the Macauley caliber—could write upon the 
blackboard, has been worth hundreds of millions to 
Europe. Germany has been paying out forty 
millions a year for copra and this commodity was 
sold for a great deal more. The margerine indus- 
try has developed to immense proportions in Great 
Britain, but still does not suffice for the needs of the 
people of these islands, and they had to import be- 
fore the war 150,000,000 pounds of margerine a year, 
chiefly from Germany and Denmark. This amounts 
to more than a third of the butter imports. 
The margerine business in America has grown until 
it is now more than eight million dollars a year. 
The cocoanut grows close to the seashore and here

is where the tropical archipelagoes have the ad- 
vantage. Ey 
Turning to another important topic, our country 
has a decided interest in the Philippine Islands, a 
tropical country. What subject, then, offers a 
better opportunity for concrete study than this 
tropical possession of the United States? Suppose 
the search for information has led the teacher to 
select the following reading matter:

Sheltered,” pp. 67-76, Chamberlain (Mac.); “Australia, Our Col-

States; see also Appendix B for other illustrative material. 
Suppose, from these data, the teacher is impressed 
with the present usefulness as well as with the 
future possibilities of the Philippine Islands. Then 
why not construct the problem: Why have the 
Philippine Islands a promising future? If so, how 
can the material—text and references—be arranged 
for advantageous treatment of this problem? 
The introduction might be given somewhat as

  88 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
follows: The Philippine Islands came into our pos- 
session in 1898. For a long time the inhabitants 
thought that time spent in school was lost, since 
independence, to which they constantly looked for- 
ward, would bring an entire change in affairs. They 
now think that there is prospect of independence 
through education. Does this mark progress? 
2. Organization of topics.—Living conditions 
in the islands have been greatly improved by the 
United States. Health measures and sanitary pre- 
cautions have been introduced and enforced; a better 
government has been established; and educational 
advantages are being provided. Hundreds of Amer- 
ican teachers are being sent to their schools and they 
have introduced industrial and trade education. 
A bureau of education circulates information about 
homestead laws, postal banks, and good roads among 
the natives. Societies for the improvement of 
villages have been formed. English, as a spoken 
language, is becoming more prevalent. 
Since food products—fruits, rice, vegetables, coffee, 
sugar, etc.—are easily raised, the Philippine Islands 
ean support a large population. If farming condi- 
tions are improved and are made modern, greater 
production is possible. 
The natural resources offer a variety of occupa- 
tions. Agriculture is easily carried on because of 
the rich soil, abundant rainfall, and the tropical 
climate. Quantities of tobacco, coffee, fruits, 
cocoanuts, indigo, hemp, and rice are raised. Min-
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 39 
eral resources—gold, sulphur, petroleum, coal, and 
iron—offer increasing industrial opportunities. The 
dense forests contain dyewood, rubber, bamboo, palm, 
and ebony. Therefore there is considerable possi- 
bility for industrial development and employment. 
The commercial possibilities are good, for a profit- 
able trade can be carried on between the United 
States and other countries. They have good har- 
bors at Manila and Iloilo. They import cotton, 
machinery, and hardware. With encouragement of 
industries, more and more can be imported. In 
exchange for these imports, they export tobacco, 
sugar, fruits, coffee, cocoa, indigo, hemp, lumber, 
and copra. They have facilities for communication 
with the rest of the world, for they are connected 
by cables with Asia and the United States. 
The Philippine Islands are also valuable to the 
United States for they occupy a strategic position 
in the Pacific. 
The right kind of education and a fair and inti- 
mate contact with American trade will eventually 
develop the people. 
The brief statements above of the method to be 
pursued indicate how the topics may be organized. 
If the pupils are guided in their activities, if dis- 
cussions ensue, if readings and reports are made, 
then the problem possesses advantages superior 
to the topical recitation of facts. 
A review could be obtained by the problem: Do 
you think the United States could afford to sell the 
Philippines? 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    ‘40 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
In like manner, the problem: What has England 
done for India? might be considered. This would 
bring out reports of selected readings about India,, 
group discussions, and a topical organization like the 
following: 
England has improved the civilization of India 
by establishing modern schools and colleges and by 
introducing postal and telegraph systems. 
England has enriched India’s agricultural pro- 
duction by irrigating the land. 
India’s commerce has been increased by England, 
for she has built and maintained railroads between 
all the chief cities and encouraged the exportation and 
importation of materials. 
England has improved health conditions by 
draining the marshes, fighting contagious diseases, 
and has made fever less prevalent. 
England has been successful, among other reasons, 
because she has allowed the people to worship as they 
wish and to follow out their natural social and 
governmental inclinations. 
Great Britain having benefited India, what does 
India do for Great Britain? 
India provides Great Britain with many food 
products and furnishes her with many raw materials; 
India is a market for Great Britain’s manufactured 
products; India increases the revenue of Great 
Britain by more than $500,000,000 a year.? 
India helps Great Britain in time of war, as was

up-to-date statistical information (See pp. 42-47).

evidenced by her part in the World War. In case of 
war with any country in Asia, England can use India 
as a base for supplies and for landing troops. 
Further comparisons between other countries and 
their colonies might follow these two. Why are the 
Hawaiian Islands a valuable possession of the 
United States? is a question which, in the organiza- 
tion demanded and in the process of solution, requires 
the same kind of treatment as that which was ac- 
corded the two preceding problems.* 
The brief statements that follow point to the 
salient features which should receive attention in the 
solution of this problem. 
Hawaiian products find a ready market in the 
United States. The rich soil, tropical climate, and 
abundant rainfall produce luxuriant vegetation. 
Tropical fruits—bananas, oranges, grape-fruit, pine- 
apple, cocoanuts, ete.—abound. Coffee, rice, and 
sugar-cane are the principal products. 
San Francisco is a shipping center in the United 
States for the Hawaiian trade. Sugar is our prin- 
cipal import from Hawaii, while breadstuffs, machin- 
ery, cotton manufactures, lumber, and provisions 
form our chief exports to Hawaii. In the “Golden 
Days of ’49” the Hawaiian Islands furnished prac- 
%The Department of Commerce, in its list of publications of May 1, 
1918, states (p. 20) that the Coast and Geodetic Survey publishes 658 
charts on different scales, for general or local use, covering the coasts of 
the United States and Alaska, Porto Rico, the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and 
the Philippine Islands. This department issues a monthly list of

tically all the food for the early California miners. 
Hence, they aided in the building of the West. 
The location of the Hawaiian Islands is important 
to the United States. Situated about midway be- 
tween the Pacific Coast and the Philippines, these 
islands afford a repair station for ships and a coaling 
station for the merchant marine.

These illustrations serve to show that there are 
four steps involved in the problem type of instruc- 
tion: (1) In preparation for the problem, data must 
be secured out of which problems should arise. 
(2) The problem is raised. (3) The problem 
is tested. Materials are to be secured, interpreted, 
and applied. (4) The problem is solved. De- 
tailed written analysis is, in general, not necessary 
for the pupils; yet some teachers by mistake require 
a more or less painful amount of written work.

and, in the getting, the way is opened for the teacher 
to demonstrate statistical study and arrangement. 
As a consequence, there can be developed in pupils an 
orderly and accurate way of recording what coun- 
tries and portions of countries contribute to that 
grand total which comprises the world’s table. The 
sugar industry offers an example. In the Catalogue 
of the Bureau of Publications, Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Com- 
merce, there is listed a review of information avail- 
able to manufacturers and exporters. On Page 24

Information can also be obtained about the trade 
of the United States with the world from the mis- 
cellaneous series of the Department of Commerce.

tains statistics showing the trade of the United 
States by countries and articles, rendering it possible 
to turn to Italy, for instance, and make an accurate 
survey of our trade with that country. 
In one of the standard textbooks‘ in use in schools, 
we find a quantitative treatment of a review of the 
United States and comparisons with other coun- 
tries, statistics in the figures being for 1910, with 
graphic illustrations attractively arranged, and also 
distribution maps. The idea involved is excellent. 
Up-to-date material constructed in the same form 
suggested in this section is of sufficient value to be in- 
corporated in geographical teaching as a means of 
making it effective. 
When we are able to introduce pupils to statistical 
study and treat this in such a manner that they take 
interest in it and learn both how to interpret sta- 
tistics and how to record them, they have then 
successfully acquired an advantageous amount of 
geographical skill. | 
Qualitative treatment difficul—The qualitative 
treatment of geographical facts is important, yet in 
comparison with the quantitative treatment, a little 
more difficult to present, because, at present, text- 
books devote very little attention to this phase of the

subject. It is true that in the quantitative treat- 
ment the qualitative side of things should find its 
proper place. Ira C. Davis, in discussing “‘Agri- 
culture in China,” in the December, 1918, issue of 
the Journal of Geography, says that in China almost 
every foot of land is made to contribute material for 
food, fuel, or fabric. Everything that can be made 
edible serves as food for man or domestic animals; 
whatever can not be eaten or worn is used for fuel. 
He states, too, that the Chinese are vegetarians to a 
far higher degree than are most western peoples, 
saying statistics prove that“ . . . of one hundred 
pounds of dry substance food fed to cattle, only 
four pounds appear in the form of human food, 
but five pounds from sheep and eleven from swine.” 
He further claims that according to records, China 
gets forty-two bushels of water rice per acre, twenty- 
two bushels of dry land rice per acre, and makes an 
average yield of wheat of twenty-five bushels per 
acre. 
In the northeastern section of the United States, 
the New England States politically, the North 
Atlantic Lowland of the United States regionally, 
good farm land is not abundant and therefore 
agriculture has not occupied first place in the ac- 
tivities of the people. Nevertheless, the little farm- 
ing possible is well done. Since most of the level 
land is situated near the coast and adjacent to the 
bays where the largest number of industrial and 
commercial cities of the United States are located, 
the farmers raise vegetables and fruit, and produce 
       
             
       
-P-A-G-E-70
  46 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
dairy products in abundance for the city markets. 
As a result, about one per cent. of the country’s 
area produces three per cent. of the crops and more 
per acre than any other section of the United States, 
This same section carries on two thirds of the coun: 
try’s commerce, and one third of all of its manufac. 
turing. 
This qualitative treatment, in the study of world 
industries, teaches facts and principles about com. 
petition between peoples and relative successes at~ 
tained by them. In times of acute distress, when 
the cost of living is high, qualitative production is 
studied with much interest by all. Geography, 
when quality of production is emphasized, teaches 
certain generalizations which are valuable as well as 
instructive. Though the world can be conceived of 
as an immense workshop, industries are not confined 
to those nations which can by nature produce the 
goods best and most easily. Production in France 
is not restricted to objects of art and fine wine; China 
is engaged in other activities than those pertaining 
to raw silk and tea; Australian effort is not devoted 
only to wool, nor the energy of Switzerland only 
to silk, nor that of Spain only to olives and fruit, 
nor that of Scandinavia only to dairy products, 
nor that of Canada only to lumber, nor that of 
England only to textiles, nor that of the United 
States only to steel or cotton. Industries are world 
wide; people in one section of the world compete 
with those in another section, even though one 
may not be so well favored by nature. In this com-  
-P-A-G-E-71
        
   
       
   
                            THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 47 
petition, success is measured by the amount per unit 
of production. In the case of crops and farming, 
intensive cultivation is the qualitative considera- 
tion, while extensive cultivation is the quantitative 
side of it. In qualitative production, brains are 
applied to the tasks at hand; and men bring to bear 
upon the problems before them those auxiliaries 
which help them to secure and maintain, in spite of 
the adverse circumstances of nature, a high position 
for keen competition and a superior place in the 
world’s work. 
4. Development of problem types.—Preparation 
for selection of problems.—The responsibility of ar- 
ranging the drama of the reconstructed life of peoples 
in effective instructional order rests upon teachers. 
To meet this responsibility, there are two principles 
which should guide them: first, keeping abreast of 
the times, and, second, forming the habit of reading 
from sources of authority. 
Conditions in the world are constantly changing, 
presenting shifting values which are important to 
geographical study. Teachers must be in a position 
and also in a frame of mind to weigh the importance 
of the new, to make use of available information, 
and to discriminate between transitory and stable 
facts.

-P-A-G-E-72
  48 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
It is a wise teacher who forms the habit of turn- 
ing the pages of geographical magazines, like the 
Journal of Geography, the National Geographic 
Magazine and the Geographical Review, or who 
reads at intervals, with “judgment equal or super- 
ior,” some newspaper or newspapers of recognized 
merit and authority. While broadening her in- 
tellectual horizon this teacher also obtains, as a by- 
product, gems of thought for use in the classroom, 
and technical information; and thus gains not only 
a sense of security, but also a feeling of comfort for 
the daily tasks that confront her. 
In particular, one who reads widely, and selects 
carefully, is in a position to arrange that biblio- 
graphy so necessary for both herself and her pupils in 
the solution of problems and in the literary presenta- 
tion of the subject. Furthermore, when one se- 
cures a genuine, technical knowledge of the science of 
geography, “place geography” facts assume a proper 
emphasis in respect to the importance they bear to 
one another and to geography as a subject. 
The problem raised.—Type and topical methods 
can be used in problems. By the use of the problem 
method, one can make a distinct advance in effective 
presentation, for in it one makes use of topics, since 
the relevant material must be properly classified 
in advantageous sequence. For recording facts and 
principles there are a number of methods that can 
be used, but the topical or outline method is worthy 
of mention, inasmuch as it affords opportunity for 
classification of material under a convenient and 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 49 
logical arrangement. Through the use of type 
studies, also, one is able to secure information about 
a certain class or obtain from the type study data 
for the purpose at hand. Once obtained, this must 
be subjected to the following examination: Are 
the data of enough combined weight to prove the 
point in question? Are these adequate to solve the 
problem? 
The problem type of presentation not only in- 
sures a psychological and suggestive plan whereby 
pupils may develop topics to a conclusion, but it 
likewise performs even a more important mission 
in limiting the number of items taught, in making a 
careful selection of them (minor problems), and in 
grouping these items around a few major topics 
(main problems). 
Do we ever really think without a problem? 
In “A Curriculum on Mexico,’® by Dr. Frank M. 
McMurry, there is a somewhat detailed treatment 
of that country. His main problem is: “Is our in- 
tervention advisable?” The conclusion is reached 
by means of the solution of seven minor problems,° 
as follows: 
1. Ease and safety with which the various 
parts of Mexico might be reached by us. 
2. Character of the inhabitants. 
5 Teachers College Record, September, 1915, Columbia University, New 
York City. 
6]t is a general practice to organize material about a country or region 
around the following topics: climate, vegetation, minerals, manu- 
factures, people, communication, and transportation. See pp. 9-15.

3. Unity among the people. 
4. Thrift among the people. 
5. Possibilities of industrial progress and prob- 
able benefits to us. 
6. Opposing conclusions as to the advisability 
of intervention by us. 
7. Our government’s solution of the problem up 
to the present. 
If we are interested in solving this problem, we 
find that upon gathering material relating to each 
of the above minor problems, we shall also secure 
the evidence needed for an answer to the main prob- 
lem. 
Explanations, arising in response to problems 
that are set up for solution, may be adequate or in- 
adequate. It must be definitely decided whether 
the data offered in respect to each of the minor 
problems are sufficient for the purpose. If not, 
we must look elsewhere for more convincing informa- 
tion. Each fact obtained should constitute a link 
in the chain of evidence. 
In setting up problems for pupils to solve, while 
the general outline may be derived from geographi- 
cal principles, yet, the filling in of the outline or the 
treatment of the minor problems, either orally or in 
writing, might reveal in the pupil a lack of intimate 
knowledge of the subject. Sufficient evidence must 
be adduced to supplement the facts of the out- 
line. Consequently, success lies in the nature and 
the amount of the evidence that is to be expected 
from school pupils in support of statements.
-P-A-G-E-75
THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 51 
We might well ask ourselves some questions like 
the following: Can we think of any way in which 
independence on our part in working out a problem— 
that is, independence of authority and text—might 
be of benefit to the pupil if we acquaint him with it? 
Which is preferable, poverty and independence, 
or riches borrowed from others? Which did our 
teachers encourage in us? Which is. more impor- 
tant to possess, mental attitude or information? 
Or are they equal in importance? Are results in 
teaching assisted by method? 
Admitting the necessity of setting up problems, 
what are some of the vital factors we should consider 
in searching for suitable ones? A poet says: 
Attempt the end, and never stand in doubt; 
Nothing’s so hard, but search will find it out. 
5. Testing the problem.—tIn making preparation 
for the selection of a problem, the country, or what- 
ever section or thing is contemplated, must be 
studied with the idea of choosing from the mass of 
available material those descriptions and data 
which contain distinct characteristics of the country 
or section under survey, the main factor or factors of 
geographic control. After these have been selected, 
then the question must be framed for consideration 
and tested for validity. After choosing the problem 
the following principles should be applied as a meas- 
ure of its efficacy: 
The value of the problem.—Is the problem worth 
solving? Will its solution be of enough value to
-P-A-G-E-76
  52 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
pay for the work involved? Will the conclusions of 
the investigations be of worth? Will it involve pro- 
jects? If so, are they capable of adding to interest 
in the solution? 
The feasibility of solution—Can the problem 
be solved? Can suitable methods be devised? 
Can enough related data be obtained for its solu- 
tion? Are the pupils able to judge whether the 
problem can or can not be solved? 
Judgment of the worth of statements—When one 
has chosen his problem and made clear its meaning, 
one must then know how io select data that will 
aid in its solution, and reject those that will not. 
In other words, it is a case of “sticking to the point.” 
Statistics or quantitative treatment.—Is there evi- 
. dence of ability to know when statistics are needed in 
proof of a statement or in thesolution of the problem?7 
Recording facts and principles.—There are a num- 
ber of methods for recording facts and principles. 
Some are better than others; but one principle is 
clearly established, namely, that the significant 
outstanding feature or features of any generali- 
zation should find expression in clear, good English, 
and statistical or other information should follow this 
declaration. 
Classification—Can the facts be readily classi- 
fied? 
  
7Teachers are not generally aware of the valuable free information 
which can be obtained from the different departments of the Gover- 
ment (See Appendix B), and from various agencies like the Pan American 
Union, Washington, D. C.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 58 
Arrangement.—When one has placed the relevant 
facts in proper classification, that is, each in its proper 
class, and in accordance with the purpose at hand, 
can they be arranged in some advantageous se- 
quence? The arrangement may be dominated by 
any one of a number of ideas, according to the 
purpose in view, such as number, size, or degree of 
importance, or of difficulty, ete. 
Sufficiency—Having the relevant data properly 
classified, no conclusion can be made until the ques- 
tion of sufficiency has been answered: Are the data 
of enough combined weight to prove the’ point? 
Are they adequate to solve the problem? 
Clearness.—Can the data be grasped by the pupils? 
Are these of sufficient importance, suited to the age 
and understanding so as to enable them to gain 
enough knowledge for making extended, clear 
statements in support of the problem? 
6. Values attributed to the problem method.— 
The problem method may be said to possess the fol- 
lowing values: 
1. The pupils have a definite goal to reach, and 
each assignment leads them toward the 
solution. 
2. Pupils receive a direct training in weighing 
values, because, independently, they must 
select and reject material bearing upon the 
subject under discussion. 
8. They are trained in habits of mind that will 
be equally useful to them in the solution of 
other problems in other subjects or lessons.
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
7. Therefore the problem method is generally 
useful, for it is not confined to one subject.— 
. The principles acquired in the problem method 
—learning how to study—are identical with 
those used in the solution of life problems. 
5. Problems and projects if selected with due 
regard to the pupils, and if accepted by them 
as their own, are likely to be of sufficient 
interest to cause pupils to go to work with 
enthusiasm. 
. The solution of each problem is but one more 
link in the chain of giving the pupil an in- 
sight into geographical principles and data on 
geography as a whole. 
. In solving problems, children are enabled to 
acquire, to organize, and immediately utilize 
certain essential material. 
. The solution of problems encourages pupils 
to use supplementary texts and_ books; 
causes them to collect material bearing upon 
the problem from sources other than the 
school room. ~ a ai ao 
9. In the solution of problems, pupils can develop 
a desire to read for pleasure and information, 
ase they have a specific purpose for which to 
read. 
10. By means of live problems, pupils realize that 
geography is concerned with the present; that 
it is a living, growing subject, involving knowl- 
edge of the world and its people, of the work 
that they do, and of the interdependence of 
people in the world as the home of man.

to instruction by presenting two problems with their 
outlines only. Therefore, no statistical information 
is supplied, though up-to-date statistics should be 
incorporated when the problem is applied in class- 
room work. 
Suppose the British Empire be studied according 
to the following problem: Why has Great Britain 
the largest merchant marine and navy in the world? 
and the following topical arrangement: 
ORGANIZATION 
I. Conditions underlying the development of 
Great Britain. 
1. Physical conditions: 
A. Location (latitude and longitude with 
reference to other nations). 
B. Climate (winds, rain, bordering bodies of 
water and ocean currents). 
C. Surface—rivers and mountains. 
D. Shorelines. 
2. Industrial conditions of Great Britain: 
A. Natural advantages: 
(1) Minerals, (2) Lumber, (3) Water power, 
(4) Nearness to sea (no place more than 
seventy miles from the coast). 
(5) Physical conditions. 
B. Disadvantages: 
(1) Lack of raw materials (foods and 
textiles). 
(2) Lack of some minerals (iron, nickel, 
copper). 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
(3) Property control (large landed estates 
and unfair taxation). 
C. Sources of raw materials traced. Desk 
outline maps to be used. 
3. The influence of government: 
A. The people intelligent, industrious, enter- 
prising. 
B. The form of government compared with 
the United States and Germany (brief com- 
parison, including ruler, law-making body, 
prime minister, e¢ al.). 
4. Colonial possessions of the British Empire: 
A. Important to the welfare of the Em- 
pire: 
(1) Canada, (2) Australia, (3) New Zealand, 
(4) India, (5) South Africa, (6) Egypt, 
(7) Jamaica and other possessions in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
B. Important to the Empire strategically:

(5) Singapore, (6) Hongkong, (7) St. Helena, 
(8) Bermuda Islands, (9) Falkland Islands, 
(10) Islands in the Southern Pacific. 
II. Power on the seas: 
1. Necessary for defence, for the development 
of the home land, for world trade and colonial 
control. 
2. Made possible by resources such as coal, 
iron, and lumber in Britain; by the character 
of the shoreline, and by the skilfulness of the 
people.

THE NEW TYPE OF PRESENTATION 57 
Now let us assume that the knowledge obtained 
in the solution of the above problem about Great 
Britain is a matter of common knowledge to all of the 
pupils. Let us say that what they have organized 
about England they can use by way of a com- 
parison. So, left to their own initiative, they are 
given another problem for solution, supplied with the 
bibliography and material, and, divided into groups, 
they solve, after a number of days of investigation, 
the following problem, “Can Japan be to the East 
what the British Isles are to the West?”

England receives the influence of the Gulf 
Stream; Japan, the Japan Current. 
2. There is abundant rainfall. Compare London 
and Yokohama in regard to heat belts. 
III. Area and population compared: 
1. Japan is a little larger. 
2. Japan is more densely populated. 
IV. The occupations are similar: 
1. Both are great manufacturing centers.

(2) There is little farming on an extensive 
plan. 
(3) There are extensive fisheries. 
(4) Commercial advantages are similar. 
(5) Industries are well developed. 
V. The people are of different races, but they are 
both progressive, intelligent, industrious and 
enterprising. Other characteristics differentiate 
them. Attitude of United States toward emi- 
grants from each country.

8. At the outbreak of the war in 1914, Great 
Britain had the first navy (tonnage) in the 
world, and Japan the fifth. 
8. Minimum requirements of place geography.— 
In the organization of material bearing upon 
problems, consideration must be taken of what are 
known as the minimum requirements in place geog- 
raphy. These have a definite place in problem 
study. Without them an effective solution would be 
impossible. By means of certain facts, pupils can 
advance very rapidly toward the goal they are seek- 
ing. Let us see what place-facts must necessarily 
be brought out in a study of the two problems on 
Great Britain and Japan. In the case of Great 
Britain, first, the surrounding waters had to be noted: 
the North Sea, the English Channel, the Irish Sea, 
St. George’s Channel, the Atlantic Ocean, and the 
Strait of Dover. Next, in a consideration of the 
surface features, the Severn, the Thames, and the 
Firth of Clyde must have been observed, as well as 
important mountains. In order to follow the de- 
velopment of industrial conditions, cities like Lon- 
don, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, 
Cardiff, Dublin, Queenstown, Belfast, Glasgow, and 
Grimsby occupied the pupil’s attention. In tracing 
the colonial possessions, the important cities of 
Ottawa, Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Winnipeg, and 
Vancouver in Canada, St. Johns in Newfoundland, 
Melbourne, Sidney, and Canberra in Australia, 
Wellington in New Zealand, Delhi, Calcutta, Bom-

bay and Madras in India, Johannesburg, Kimberley, 
and Capetown in South Africa, Cairo and Alexandria 
in Egypt, Colombo in Ceylon, Singapore in the 
Straits Settlement, and Hongkong in China could be 
listed. The psychological advantage of obtaining 
place-facts in this manner is obvious because of the 
number and variety of associations that are neces- 
sarily brought into play. Assuming that provision 
has been made for these facts to be recorded in note- 
books, further use of such minimum requirements in 
place geography for drill, short review, and applica- 
tion to other problems is both necessary and de- 
sirable.

  CHAPTER 1V 
PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 
1. The project is a vital factor—The problem 
to be solved, the questions to be asked, the projects 
which evolve, the application of principles to a 
specific question of large scope—these are factors 
which outline the definite procedure of work. 
When the necessity for the selection of a project 
arises, and after the desired project has been selected 
and begun, care must be taken that the very desire 
to attain success should cause the pupils to begin 
work with enthusiasm. Getting pupils away from 
the sole use of the textbook by supplying stimulating 
materials and then giving them the opportunity to 
work out the ideas suggested, constitutes one of the 
best ways to insure the success of instruction. 
There is another way in which project and problem 
teaching meets the essential demands of modern 
pedagogy:/it provides opportunity for continually 
working with one’s fellows! /One of the social aims 
of education is to teach codperation and mutual 
helpfulness. In this method of instruction, ample 
opportunity is afforded for the development of such 
social virtues. When we provide our pupils with 
many of the sources from which they can get informa- 
61 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  62 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
tion, sources involving manipulation, visual explora- 
tion, and the fundamental impulses of activity, we 
are treading upon firm ground. When the activi- 
ties of the pupils are made educative, when they 
are steered to worthy and successful ends, we are 
building upon safe foundations. 
William H. Kilpatrick classifies projects as follows: 
“Type 1, where the purpose is to embody some idea 
or plan in external form, as building a boat, writing a 
letter, presenting a play; type 2, where the purpose 
is to embody some (esthetic) experience, as listening 
to a story, hearing a symphony, appreciating a 
picture; type 3, where the purpose is to straighten 
out some intellectual difficulty, to solve some prob- 
lem, as to find out whether or not dew falls, to ascer- 
‘tain how New York outgrew Philadelphia; type 4, 
where the purpose is to obtain some item or degree of 
skill or knowledge, as learning to write grade 14 
on the Thorndike Scale, learning the irregular verbs 
in French. It is at once evident that these group- 
ings more or less overlap and that one type may be 
used as means to another as an end.”’! 
The use of the term “project”? which follows may 
be said to pertain, for the most part, to type 1 of - 
Kilpatrick’s classification. One may be able to 
observe, however, that both the previous presenta- 
tion of the use of problems and the presentation in 
this chapter disclose a process of instruction which 
can include all of the types referred to above.

2. How projects aid instruction. Pupils are 
roughly classified into ear-minded, eye-minded, and 
motor-minded groups.) Some learn quickly through 
what they hear, others by means of what they see, 
and still others through what they do. Projects 
consist in doing what pupils think it is worth while 
todo. By means of them the subject of geography is 
vitalized, because projects involve the active and 
motivated participation of the pupils in carrying 
them to successful conclusions. The treatment of 
topics is formal, in which teachers do most of the 
thinking and the pupils the absorbing. Projects 
can originate in the questions that pupils ask, and 
these questions usually arise in the recitation, 
socialized through the problem method and group 
instruction. When there is interest, questions arise, 
and the need of answering them is imperative. 
Answers need not always be given verbally; they 
ean be acted. A class may keep records of the 
weather and the seasons; an individual pupil can 
make a weather vane or a wind wheel. Several 
Camp-fire Girls might, in the process of winning 
honors in campcraft, keep scientific records and 
seek to interpret weather lore. Scores of activities 
are possible in geography.” 
3. The procedure illustrated.—It is the real need 
for objective illustration that makes projects vital. 
2 The “Book of Knowledge,” 24 vols. (The Grolier Society, New York), 
and Foster’s “Something to Do—Boys” and “Something to Do— 
Girls” (W. A. Wilde Co., Boston), contain suggestions which are in- 
dicative of the wealth of material that can be secured.
-P-A-G-E-88
64 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
To supply the wants and needs of pupils, especially 
in an objective manner, is one of the interesting mis- 
sions of geography; and projects not only serve this 
purpose, but they also help to vary the instruction. 
Getting the pupil’s interest in a question like, “What 
is man’s relation to climate?” is a difficult task 
because the subject is formal and abstract. The 
problem and the project offer a way out of the diffi- 
culty. 
In beginning the subject, divide the class into 
groups. Let some pupils bring in reports on people 
who live in deserts, others about those who live in 
cold climates, showing how the food, the occupa- 
tions, the houses, and the manner of living are in- 
fluenced by climatic conditions. Others may cover 
the field of temperate climate, and so on. 
In the Journal of Geography, October, 1918, there 
is a series of thirty questions which could be used 
in the study of the subject. These questions, which 
follow, illustrate how the curiosity of pupils might 
be aroused and how pupils can be stimulated to find 
out more about climate. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Why is the atmosphere more dense at sea level 
than at high altitudes? 
2. Why does warmed air tend to rise? 
3. Why does dew form on cool summer nights? 
4. Why does it form more abundantly on some 
objects than on others?

  PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 65 
5. Why does dew not form on cloudy or windy 
nights? 
6. Why do clouds form? 
7. Why do they form at considerable altitudes? 
8. Why do clouds sometimes seem to melt away or 
dissolve? 
9. Why are most clouds white? Why are some 
very dark? Why are the sunset clouds often bril- 
liantly colored? 
10. Why is a cloudy night in autumn usually 
warmer than a clear night? 
11. Why is the sky sometimes free from clouds? 
12. Why do we not expect rain from a clear sky? 
13. Is there any basis for the proverb—‘Rain 
before 7, clear before 11”? Explain. 
14. Why does moisture collect on the ice pitcher? 
Why not on a pitcher of warm water? 
15. Why does our breath show on a cold day and 
not on a warm one? 
16. Why does water “boil away’’? 
17. Why do clothes dry rapidly on some days and 
slowly on others? 
18. Why is it difficult satisfactorily to press a 
garment in certain kind of weather? What kind of 
weather? 
19. Why may even a sheet of paper over a flower 
bed save it from frost? 
20. Why does fanning cool us? 
21. Why is mercury used in a barometer? 
22. Why is mercury used in a thermometer? 
23. Why does the mercury in the barometer rise 
and fall? 
24. Why does the mercury in a thermometer rise 
and fall? 
25. Why does the mercury in a barometer stand 
higher at sea level than on a mountain? 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  66 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
26. Why is the barometer used in determining 
altitudes? 
27. Why is the air near the earth’s surface usually 
warmer during the day time than that higher up? 
28. Why is a stream of cool air sometimes found 
flowing down the stairways of our houses in winter? 
29. Why does a chimney “draw’’? 
30. Why does wind hasten evaporation? 
With the development of such questions, pupils 
will seek to prove the truth of the facts by doing and 
making certain things. They will experiment under 
direction, learning by doing. Projects, then, are set 
up in proportion as they are really needed and de- 
manded by the class, all assisting in appreciation 
of the significant facts about climate—conditions of 
temperature, conditions of moisture, composition 
of the air, winds influencing weather, the average 
weather conditions constituting climate, and, finally, 
climate affecting the mode of living, the occupations, 
the temperament of people, giving them their soil 
and their minerals, shaping their hopes and their 
ambitions, and causing the great problems of ex- 
ploration, engineering, and similar human endeavors. 
In schools having manual training, cooking, and 
general science, there should be the closest codpera- 
tion between these departments and that of geog- 
raphy. Examination of a book like Van Buskirk 
and Smith’s “The Science of Everyday Life” (H. M.) 
will convince the teacher that there is some real help 
to be received through codperation with a depart- 
ment of general science.

4. Kinds of projects—Through projects the 
power of initiative and executive ability can at least 
be discovered; and it is possible that these may be 
developed. 
A project may be a large unit of work, upon 
which the effort of the whole class is centered. If, 
in a study of the United States, regional product 
charts are prepared, this is a project in which the 
whole class participates. (See Page 139). The 
product map of the United States is a popular 
example of the group project, for each pupil brings 
samples of different articles, or pictures of articles, 
raw and manufactured, for placement upon a large 
outline map of the country: cotton in the Southern 
States, coal in Pennsylvania, wheat and flour in the 
central West, and so forth; and these are fixed upon 
the map in some convenient way. Some teachers 
like to have papier-maché maps made; others like
-P-A-G-E-93

PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 69 | 
to get the children interested in sand table representa- | 
tions. All of these are examples of group projects.‘ 
When compositions, spelling papers, art posters, 
placards, charts, and pictures of any one unit-study 
of geography_are made and collected, and are put on 
exhibition; and when the selection, arrangement, 
and mounting of the material are required, there again 
we have a group project. 
A project may be a smaller unit of work involving a 
relatively short period of time for its completion. 
In the higher grades the judgment and the skill of 
pupils can be tested by designing cut-out poster 
effects typical of certain countries. These cannot 
be planned successfully unless the pupil knows 
about the peculiar customs, the native dress, the 
scenic wonders, and the products of a country. 
Each pupil, in projects of this kind, must select a 
subject according to his own interests; but he should 
receive assistance in expressing satisfactorily his 
ideas in subject matter, color values, perspective, 
mounting, etc. A promised exhibit of this material 
adds to the interest and it puts pupils on their mettle 
to do something worth showing. 
Again, a project may be a certain, specific piece of 
work of an individual pupil, such as filling in a desk 
outline map with the necessary data or painting the 
flag of a country or the preparation of an outline con- 
taining interesting material concerning a place or 
  
4Dramatization as an example of a group project is illustrated in

  70 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
country about which he wants to tell a friend who is 
unable to attend school. 
5. Classroom materials necessary.—Besides co- 
operation with other departments, an attempt should 
be made to have some of the following materials 
supplied: 
1. Maps. Adequate up-to-date maps, de- 
signed to supply the need of gaining accurate con- 
ceptions of place geography and the distribution of 
life, etc., are essential. 
Outline wall maps for class use and printed desk 
outline maps for individual pupil’s practice are now 
in common use and are practical necessities. They 
may be obtained from various publishers. 
Relief and political maps should at all times be 
placed in full view of the class. (See Page 16). 
2. Globes. Both slated and colored globes are 
used. For mathematical geography, globes are in- 
dispensable. For obtaining clear conceptions of 
geographical relations, they are without comparison. 
8. Atlases are most valuable aids to the work, 
provided they are up-to-date. The out-of-date 
atlas affords very poor assistance to the modern 
reader. (See Appendix B). 
4. The “World Almanac,” published by the Press 
Publishing Company, Pulitzer Building, New York, 
and obtainable at bookstands, is highly valuable for 
reference work. It is published annually and the 
information contained therein is thoroughly modern. 
5. Pictures, railroad folders, post cards, slides, 
the baloptican, the stereoscope, the motion picture, 
are all valuable auxiliaries to teaching. (See 
Appendix B).

PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 7 
6. Publications. Various departments of the 
government publish valuable pamphlets and bulle- 
tins. (See Appendix B). 
A good newspaper or newspapers with Associated 
Press news and unbiased reading matter is most 
helpful for teachers. 
The Chambers of Commerce of various cities 
furnish material of interesting character upon re- 
quest. (See Appendix B). 
Organizations like the Pan American Union, 
Washington, D. C., are glad to render service. Large 
industrial and manufacturing concerns distribute 
instructive material through their educational de- 
partments. (See Appendix B). 
The National Geographic Magazine has for many 
years provided schools with material of excellence. 
To it many classrooms are subscribers. Teachers 
find the Journal of Geography and the Geographical 
Review of large and effective service. 
7. Bulletin Boards. For holding current clip- 
pings and extracts from magazines, notices, and the 
like, at least one bulletin board is necessary. 
8. Scrap books and notebooks (loose leaf), for 
holding advertisements, illustrations, notes, news- 
paper clippings, outline maps filled in, essential facts 
and interesting data of many sorts can be used to 
advantage. 
9. Specimens and exhibits. While raw materials 
of commerce and manufactured articles may be 
obtained from the educational departments of many 
large manufacturing and industrial concerns, teach- 
ers and pupils can, individually and collectively, 
secure many valuable specimens of rocks, minerals, 
and the like through excursions. The science 
department can also provide interesting material. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  72 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The government departments at Washington sell 
cases containing specimens of various sorts. (See 
Appendix B). 
10. Supplementary books. Books of history, 
literature, commerce, statistics, geography, and 
travel should be selected for the work and kept in the 
department of geography or in the classroom, as a 
part of the school library. (See pp. 92-98). 
11. Experiment tables. To have an experiment 
table for modeling is most desirable. Shallow tins or 
oilcloth or even heavy wrapping paper for protecting 
the desk may be substituted. The best material 
for temporary modeling is moist sand. Plasticine 
finds practical use in the hands of many successful 
teachers, it being applied not only to modeling, but 
also to desk demonstrations, when, by quickly 
‘rolling or pulling the material and otherwise manip- 
ulating it, it is placed on view to represent certain 
comparisons, etc. Practical demonstrations are eas- 
ily made. For instance, the relative output of 
potatoes in one country in comparison with that of 
another may be represented by two plasticine balls, 
quickly rolled, approximately correct in ratio. The 
use of this material is valuable in the hands of a 
skilful and enthusiastic teacher. 
12. A blackboard, in full view of the class, 
accessible to the teacher, who can turn and make 
quick, comprehensive diagrams and drawings and 
other graphic representations is often considered 
unnecessary; but, without this facility, many lessons 
are failures. 
Teachers will do well to make an inventory of the 
work of the grade which the course of study de- 
mands, by laying out their term’s problems and
-P-A-G-E-97
    PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 73 
projects. After this has been done, an accurate 
and comprehensive requisition can be made for the 
material necessary for the success of the term’s 
geography course. 
6. Group instruction.—In carrying out projects, 
in the solution of problems, teachers will find that 
some pupils are more rapid workers than others. 
These can be employed to great advantage in 
mutual helpfulness and codperation, for they may 
study maps required for class discussion, when the 
retarded pupils are reciting and thus prepare them- 
selves to assist the teacher in bringing the work 
up to a definite focus; they may provide the models 
which are required for project work; they may ar- 
range the lantern slides needed for illustrative pur- 
poses; they may select pictures for presentation and 
distribution—in these and in many other ways 
proficient pupils can assist materially, by the group 
plan, in advancing the class as a whole toward a 
broader geographical viewpoint. _ 
In order for children to be able to give an intel- 
ligent and essential description of any particular 
region, one must teach certain principles applicable 
to the study of that particular region or place. By 
possessing sufficient acquaintance with the process 
of applying these principles in the most effective 
manner, the pupils acquire the power of studying, 
and also gain the knowledge of how to proceed in the 
acquisition of additional facts. 
Topical treatment in problem study—Let us con- 
       
   
        
   
         
-P-A-G-E-98
      
   74 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
sider the following arbitrary outline of an order to 
be followed in the study of a country as a whole and 
then let us apply the principles involved: Position, 
size, climate, vegetation, minerals and manufactur- 
ing, occupations, communication, and distribution of 
population in relation to occupation.’ It is to be 
understood that a study of surface features is to be 
included in these topics. 
Now let us suppose that a certain country is being 
studied by groups, in relation to the above topics. 
Let the teacher arrange the class into five or six 
groups. Let the pupils in group one discuss the 
results achieved in regard to “‘position and size,” 
while pupils in other sections take notes; and so on 
with the remaining groups, considering “climate,” 
“vegetation,” and so forth in the order named. 
The later stages of treatment will be devoted to 
those unique features which give individuality to the 
country in question. 
Consider the problem, ‘“‘Can Japan be to the East 
what the British Isles are to the West?” (See pp. 57- 
59). When the above procedure is applied, em- 
phasis is thus placed upon significant features 
with the result that these become uppermost in 
the minds of the pupils, to the relative elimination 
of those deserving a subordinate rank. 
When a different country is studied, under another 
problem, group one should do the work of group 
four or group five and so on, with the result that each 
group in the study of five or six different countries

                                                        will have investigated all the general aspects neces- 
sary to the study of any one country. After prac- 
tice of this kind, each pupil learns how to gain the 
essential characteristics or how to make a rapid 
survey of a country without aid from the teacher. 
He becomes an independent unit in investiga- 
tion. 
7. Necessity of recording main problems.—In 
order to achieve this result, however, care must be 
taken to see that every one develops the ability to 
organize, to collect, and reject material; that there 
is a growing desire to read for pleasure and informa- 
tion; and that ample opportunity is given for 
application of the data obtained. In other words, 
individuals should gain facility in solving problems. 
Independent accomplishment by pupils, in the 
successful study of a few countries, gives them a calm 
and deliberate power in performing the tasks as- 
signed to them. Particular emphasis should be 
given to the matter of recording in order that, there- 
by, the significant, well-defined, outstanding features 
or main problems connected with the subject matter 
under consideration may be given due prominence. 
For instance, in a study of Brazil (See pp. 200-210), 
the topics are about the size, rivers, climate, etc. 
Statements are made of the following significant 
facts: Brazil is very large and richly endowed; its 
rivers possess a degree of importance greater than do 
ost rivers of the world; its climate is conducive to a 
ried vegetation. All of these facts are important;  
-P-A-G-E-102
  76 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
a record of them is therefore essential. These 
generalizations are obtained by the pupils as a result 
of investigation, and the statements in regard to them 
are contributions by the pupils themselves. Such 
training as the above is so often overlooked in the 
work of the schools that special emphasis is here 
called to the extreme importance of the procedure, 
for the habits acquired, developed, and perpetuated 
by constant school-room practice along this line 
result in immeasurable benefit to the pupil’s growth 
into a student and citizen. 
Desk outline maps for recording.—Little comment 
need be made upon the questions designed to test 
the knowledge gained in the manner mentioned 
above, except that such questions should refer to the 
names of places of comparatively great importance 
and should not be merely a list of names and places 
which the pupils must answer in numerous oral 
quizzes. A way both to develop and to test knowl- 
edge about geography is through constant use of out- 
line maps. For illustration, submit the following to 
the pupil, “On the outline map of South America, 
insert three rivers, three large ports, and indicate the 
scale of miles approximately.” By use of relief out- 
line maps, one may likewise find out how intimately 
the pupil is acquainted with the real facts. Tests, 
with the use of such maps, containing questions like, 
“Describe and illustrate with diagrams the valleys of 
the rivers which enter the sea near San Francisco. 
In what part of Europe is the coastline similar to 
that of New York and Charleston? Can you offer

PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 7 
an explanation for this embayed coastline?’ are 
highly valuable. 
8. A study of Africa by the problem method.— 
Miss Edith P. Parker‘ treats the subject of Africa in a 
seventh grade by the problem method as follows: 
THE PARTITION OF AFRICA 
1. A general survey of the continent based on a 
study of the physical map. 
2. Newspaper clippings and magazines about 
Africa were presented. 
8. Three problems were set up: 
(1) How is Africa divided among the European 
nations? 
(2) How does Germany’s late share compare 
with the shares of other European nations? 
(3) What determined the size and location of 
the share each country has? 
4. Problems (1) and (3) were answered by a 
study of the political map, the class text and by 
the use of such references as Chamberlain’s “Africa,” 
Carpenter’s ‘‘Africa,” Jacobs’ “Story of Geograph- 
ical Discovery,” and “World Book” (a. child’s 
encyclopeedia). 
5. Hectographed maps were distributed to the 
class. These were obtained from Keltie’s “Parti- 
tion of Africa.” 
6. Selections were read to the class from Keltie’s 
“Partition of Africa,” and from Lucas’s ‘Historical 
Geography of the British Colonies.”

7. Blackboard study was furnished the class by 
passages selected from Powell’s “The Last Frontier.” 
8. Group work.—In (2) above, each child chose 
a group of colonies or a colony for detailed study 
according to a prepared outline. Reports were 
made to the class. 
9. On a cork bulletin board (3’ x 44’) the out- 
line of Africa was traced. The colonies were cut out 
in brightly colored cardboard and placed on the 
outline by one child, while another briefly described 
them. 
10. Current events were reviewed (with the 
newspaper clippings and magazine articles already 
on hand) in the light of the information which had 
been gained. 
Observe that, in this problem, there was need of 
preparation by the teacher. References were con- 
sulted; the problem was selected; maps were hecto- 
graphed; proper materials for projects were collected; 
literary passages from Powell’s ““The Last Frontier” 
were chosen; passages to be read to the class were 
apportioned, and map study was planned. 
Notice, too, that a socialized recitation ensued. 
All of the pupils took part, for newspaper clippings 
and magazines were brought; selections were read 
by certain pupils to other members of the class; 
a survey of the continent through physical map 
study was made; group study of the colonies, calling 
for reports of the class, was required, and a review 
was called for. 
Note, too, that project work was in evidence when
-P-A-G-E-105
PROJECTS AND PROBLEMS 79 
the “cardboard colonies” were fitted to the cork map; 
when the hectographed maps were filled in, and when 
the products of Africa were displayed. 
9. The democratic tendency of geography.— 
The subject matter of geography presents the re- 
constructed lives of people engaged in activities 
befitting everybody and not just an aristocracy of 
nations. All progressive people, geography points 
out, are engaged in improving the quality of the 
output of the world and it would have us become 
intimately acquainted with these people, our own in 
particular, who have made not only tremendous 
but also successful efforts to harness the forces of 
nature in order to supply the needs of the world; 
who have changed the face of the world with 
factories, farms, mines, and cities; and who ex- 
change commodities with each other in order that 
everyone may share in the good things the world 
produces. 
In this tremendous struggle America has been in 
the thick of battle. Beginning with supplying the 
primary wants of food, clothing, and shelter, higher 
levels of thought and action have been reached. In 
this record of achievement, millions of Americans 
have contributed. Patient and skilful labor has 
been combined with brilliant inventions and startling 
discoveries and with those not so brilliant or so start- 
ling but nevertheless extremely useful. America’s 
democracy of opportunity has encouraged the rich 
land the poor, the strong and the weak alike, to assist 
ot only in the mastery of the immediate environ-    
   
     
                    
     
             
-P-A-G-E-106
    
80 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
ment, but also in the effort to supply the world, in 
both quality and quantity, with those things which 
the world expects of us. Labor-saving devices, such 
as the reaper, have not only increased the amount of 
man-unit production but they have afforded men, in 
many instances, more humane, upright opportunities 
to do more work with less exertion. 
School problems are those activities that possess 
maximum educational values in which children, in 
anticipation of effective results, are engaged in co- 
operative efforts to attain objectives which appeal 
to them as desirable. Success in accomplishment is 
to be measured not only by the results obtained, 
but also by how earnestly, how economically, and 
how purposefully the pupils work. The net result 
is that the educational activities engaged in by the 
pupils enter their conduct and improve it. Hence 
teachers may expect children, in problem study, to 
learn facts, to interpret facts, to utilize the content 
of geography, and to imbibe ideals, skills, habits, 
and attitudes of value. 
The method employed in the preceding chapters 
in which pupils can be brought into effective contact 
with the best modern educational thought and prac- 
tice in the process of solving up-to-date and vital 
problems should, by its very application, prepare 
pupils for effective participation in democratic 
society; and, indeed, in solving such problems, pupils 
are then and there participants.

CHAPTER V 
OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 
1. Journey geography.—Journey geography is a 
name given to that type of presentation which seeks 
to inform the pupil by arousing his interest in some 
imaginary trip. A juster balance between the 
serious side of geography and its lighter aspect is 
secured by such a type of presentation. Like the 
real traveler who has seen strange sights in foreign 
lands, and who, when he returns home finds ap- 
preciative audiences, the pupil-traveler can now 
take his journeys. Now that the world is coming 
to be recognized as a family of nations there is con- 
stantly increasing a certain eagerness to hear about 
the customs and the manner of life of other peoples 
in other lands. 
For a study of this character adequate material 
is required. Specific preparation must be made for 
the work. Some time must first be spent in arousing 
the interest of children in the section to be visited. 
By the use of railroad folders, or boat routes, the 
itinerary must be planned from the point of de- 
parture; the objective should be noted with the 
children’s books open to the map where the distance 
to be traversed, the cities en route, side trips to be 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
    
82 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
taken and the like are to be determined upon. By 
pictures, picture postals, magazines, readers, and 
textbooks, an opportunity is afforded to make the 
trip as real as possible. 
Journey geography illustrated——Suppose a jour- 
ney to the Pacific Coast from a point near the 
Mississippi River is planned. 
Suggestive of the material which should be on 
hand, railroad folders of the respective routes should 
be secured, for the itinerary must be planned. 
Pictures illustrating special points of interest, in- 
dustries, agricultural scenes, and many other topics 
should be ready for the pupils.2 Adequate maps, in- 
cluding desk outline maps for each pupil and the 
railroad map of the United States should be provided. 
Since such a study can be advantageously studied 
by groups, form them according to the routes which 
would be followed: some would probably like to take 
the Union Pacific through Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, 
and Nevada; others might desire to go by the Santa 
Fé across New Mexico and Arizona; and others might 
choose the Northern Pacific or Great Northern by 
the Yellowstone or National Parks through Wyo- 
ming, Montana, Nevada, Washington, and Oregon. 
Next in order comes the planning of the trip. 
1See Appendix B. 
?¥For instance, one book, “Scenes from Every Land,” by Gilbert 
Grosvenor, published by the National Geographic Society, contains 
the following pictures: Sea of fog from Mount Wilson, California; Eliot 
Glazier at northeast side of Mount Hood; a yucca, seen on the slopes of 
Mount Wilson; drying seedless raisins in California; seedless Sultana 
oe grown by irrigation near Carlsbad, New Mexico; date tree in 
lt River Valley, Arizona; winesap apple trees, Yakima, Washington; 
sheep in the Truckee-Carson Project of Nevada. See Appendix B.
-P-A-G-E-109
  OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 83 
Clothing must be selected in order to be prepared 
for the weather conditions that might be encoun- 
tered. Some idea of the sights which are expected 
should be listed, so these will not be overlooked en 
route: mountains, rivers, valleys, forests and forest 
reserves, arid plateaus, grazing areas, irrigation proj- 
ects, mineral wealth, national parks, cafions, hydro- 
electric plants, unusual natural phenomena, fisheries, 
ranches, fruit orchards, and dozens of other sights. 
Then, since several parties (represented by the 
class groups) are to take different routes, a meeting 
place should be agreed upon. Let it be San Fran- 
cisco on a certain date. In this city, since good 
travelers keep diaries, plan to have letters written 
home telling about the journey. 
When everyone shall have met in San Francisco, 
and this city shall have been toured,’ the whole party 
should prepare the return journey which will be 
taken all together. Leaving San Francisco, they 
could go to the Hawaiian Islands, thence to the Gulf 
of Mexico through the Panama Canal and from there, 
by a chosen route, head toward home. 
Through the Panama Canal, let it be noted, 
products of the world pass: those from the Far East, 
those from the western coasts of North and of South 
America bound for the eastern coast of the United 
States or Europe or vice versa. At the canal, an 
objective for a study of the climate, the vegetation, 
and the products of Central America is afforded.

-P-A-G-E-110
84 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
2. Stories and literature-—The mode in common 
practice in public schools to-day reveals the fact that 
initial instruction in geography consists in story- 
telling. Before beginning studying from a textbook, 
the pupil’s knowledge of other parts of the world is 
presumed to have been gained through stories he has 
already heard. He knows that the city in which he 
lives or the county where his home is located and his 
own country are not all there is; he realizes in a vague 
sort of way that there is something larger still, which 
he thinks of as the world. What he knows of parts 
of the world through the stories he has had related 
to him is neither well defined nor in connected se- 
quence. It thus becomes the business of the teacher 
to get some order out of chaos. 
Relating a sequence of stories, say of the explora- 
tion of the world, woven around the names of a few 
famous explorers and travelers seems a safe and in- 
teresting way to begin. Columbus, Ponce de Leon, 
Livingston, Daniel Boone, Champlain, and Marco 
Polo are but a few of the names that suggest them- 
selves. Studies relating to the exploits of con- 
temporaneous men such as Nansen, Scott, Peary, 
Roosevelt, and others possess much educational value. 
The contributions of Walter Reed, of Matthew 
Fontaine Maury, of American geographers in the 
World War, and of similar people, when attractively 
presented, prove to be of distinct interest. 
At the present time the intense interest developed 
by the World War affords an opportunity for en- 
listing the attention of pupils. For example, they
-P-A-G-E-111
    OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 
respond readily to questions such as, See from what 
countries and by what routes sugar, meats, fats, flour, 
and coal, respectively, were carried to the starving 
Belgians; or, from what countries and by what 
routes did the Allies get men to help them fight the 
Germans? 
Some teachers have seen successful in developing 
these ideas by tracing the sources of common things 
upon which we are dependent in our everyday life. 
For instance, Miss Lydia R. Blaich, would take “A 
Trip Around the World in Our Town”;! teaching 
pupils that, “The familiar articles all around you 
speak of the service of your far-away, unknown 
brothers and sisters. 
“Look about your parlor. The rug on the floor 
may have come from Turkey. The Japanese print 
adorning the walls traveled thousands of miles 
across the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco 
before it came to your house. The mahogany of the 
piano came from forests in Mexico or Central Amer- 
ica.” 
In the dining room she would have children ob- 
serve that, “The tablecloth of Irish linen came direct 
from Belfast. The dishes of Haviland china were 
made in France. . The coffee very likely came from 
Brazil, for that country produces three-fourths of the 
world’s supply; and the sugar probably was im- 
ported from Cuba or Hawaii.” 
The story of exploration which is probably most 
familiar is that of Columbus. In the portrayal of 
4“Three Industrial Nations,” L. R. Blaich. (A. B. C.) 85 
    
    
        
   
      
  
-P-A-G-E-112
  86 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
this event a number of instructive features about the 
life of Columbus illustrate the value of this method. 
In his boyhood, not only his home and parental in- 
fluence, but also his education, adventures, and en- 
vironment are informing. The influence of the ideas 
of his age is enlightening, because the contrast be- 
tween the superstitious beliefs and the inaccurate 
geographical knowledge of his time and the courage 
of Columbus’ belief, depict an example worthy of 
emulation. 
The fact that great things are accomplished only 
after hard training is illustrated by the story of 
Columbus. Witness the expedition against Naples, 
the shipwreck on the coast of Portugal, and other 
dangerous trips along the shores of Europe and 
Africa. 
That Columbus was a man of stout beliefs and of 
purpose is also contained in the narrative of his life. 
Though hampered and discouraged by lack of funds 
and the distrust of most people, who could not 
believe in his heretical ideas, he won friends in spite 
of these obstacles. He made his friends believe in 
him. Among them was his brother, who was a 
maker of maps; his father-in-law, who was an ex- 
plorer; the old friar, Queen Isabella, and Toscanelli, 
the geographer. It was his band of friends who 
helped him set out on his famous voyage across the 
Atlantic. 
The start was made at Palos on September 8, 
1492. The Pinta, the Nina, and the Santa Maria 
were equipped and manned by a queer crew—ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 87 
venturers, criminals, and some real leaders. As 
to the supplies on board, a comparison with those 
of a present-day exploring party would be startling. 
How courageous Columbus was and what a bold 
sailor he was is a continuous story of the voyage. 
His motley crew gave him no end of trouble; but 
finally they spied land, and on October 12, 1492, 
they set foot on the shores of the Western Hemi- 
sphere, probably on one of the Bahamas. It is 
certain that Cuba and Haiti were visited. It was a 
strange land to Columbus and his followers, for the 
natives, the climate, the vegetation—almost every- 
thing was different from what he expected to find. 
During the voyage, the Santa Maria was wrecked, 
so Columbus had to sail back home with the Pinta 
and the Nina. Though these boats were separated 
on the return journey, they are said to have reached 
home the same day, bringing gold, birds, animals, 
plants, and six natives, all of which created great 
excitement in Spain and provided ample proof of 
Columbus’ success. Consequently, Columbus was 
loaded with honors. 
Not content to remain idle, Columbus again 
crossed the ocean, this time reaching the island of St. 
Dominica. In two other voyages he discovered 
South America and the Gulf of Mexico. But 
after the second voyage, many troubles beset him. 
After a long illness, he was sent to Spain in irons 
(by a new government, however). Amid the base 
ingratitude of his people and in disappointment he 
died in Spain on May 20, 1506. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114

88 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The effective arrangement of the story to bring out 
the salient features which are genuinely educative 
because they advance the pupils’ ideas is, of course, 
a matter of importance. The stories of three other 
entertaining adventurers—Ponce de Leon thedreamer, 
Balboa the outlaw, and De Soto the wanderer—are 
entertaining and instructive. They offer parallels 
to the story of Columbus. On the other hand, the 
complete story of the contribution of Matthew 
Fontaine Maury, the founder of the new and im- 
portant science of hydrography and called the 
“Pathfinder of the Seas,” is not nearly so applicable 
to younger pupils because the element of adventure 
illustrated in the above story is superseded by the 
facts of science of the nineteenth century. Hence, 
these things are rather to be appreciated by more 
mature pupils. In the contributions of Theodore 
Roosevelt, one finds chapters of adventure combined 
with periods of constructive service for the geo- 
graphical story. 
Thus it is that the use of the story in geography 
does not end with the primary grades. It is effec- 
tive in the more advanced grades and for the older 
pupils. To build a story around a subject like, 
“Suppose George Rogers Clark had not conquered 
the Northwest Territory from the British,” is a 
stimulating exercise constituting one of the many 
valuable opportunities for exemplifying the inter- 
relationship between the historical evolution and the 
consequent geographical status of countries. —

contrasts are helpful for effedtivd instruction. The 
contrast between the continuous efforts of the 
Eskimos, for instance, and the comparative lack of 
effort required to obtain food in the tropical forests 
and jungles is significant by reason of the dissimi- 
larity in climate, life, vegetation, and natural re- 
sources. In this latter way, too, pupils are intro- 
duced to the real meaning of geography. By 
comparing the situation at home with that on the 
deserts, where any form of life exists with great 
difficulty; by contrasting the northern forests, 
where lumbering receives introductory treatment, 
with the lands of farming and cattle raising, where 
food is obtained in abundance; by comparing other 
sections of the United States with sections of the 
world across the seas, by means of narrative and 
anecdote, the alert teacher gains and holds the pupils’ 
attention. Gradually, these stories furnish the cor- 
rect names and locations of continents and countries, 
and the significance of valleys to the life of people is 
made known. Bays and peninsulas assume a mean- 
ing; coastlines whisper their wondrous story of 
cargoes received and unloaded. The notions of 
area and distance, at first hazy and meaningless, 
begin to take on definite proportions; pupils learn 
how the navigator depends for his existence upon a 
certain kind of knowledge while in mid-ocean; 
latitude and longitude are appreciated in the rough; 
what part the North Star plays, charts of coastlines 
for sailors and fishermen—all these become the 
source from which springs a taste for knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-117

Literary stories the best.—Both stories and recita- 
tions should reveal the fundamental ideas concerned 
with life over the earth. The more literary the 
instruction can be, in the sense of presenting clear, 
truthful, and interesting aspects of life in the various 
regions, the better it is for the educational experience 
of the pupils. The problem of effectively present- 
ing the drama of the reconstructed life of peoples 
is the task of the teacher; the children will then do 
their own thinking, seeing, and understanding. 
On through the grammar grades, with persistent 
educational tread, this same world-pageant should 
move, further deepening the understanding and 
sympathies of the pupils. The argument that young 
pupils can not be taught by this method does not 
hold, because experience and educational science 
have informed us that children can and do acquire, 
because of their interest, the habit of observation of 
human affairs in a world-wide way during their school 
days. Adults who have acquired this habit attest 
to its incipiency in childhood. Contrast the adult 
who has been dosed with didactic facts in childhood 
with the one who, having searched for knowledge 
under wise guidance, feels the exhilaration of the 
quest. The one forgets the facts, the other possesses 
the long acquired secret of getting them perma- 
ently. Therefore, there is no necessity to argue 
or deferred values—observation of world-wide 
ffairs and interest in them grows apace, simply 
roadening in comprehension and application with 
aturitv.

  92 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Literature as presentation.—Geography is indebted 
then, to other subjects, history, literature, and read- 
ing in particular, as contributory factors to its 
vitalization. The mechanical difficulties of the 
daily program, especially that of a departmental one, 
sometimes obscure the relationship. When litera- 
ture and reading can be made, by an adroit change 
in the daily program, to contribute to the knowledge 
of classes studying geography, it is well for those 
classes. More and more there is revealed a tendency 
to read narratives of adventure and travel, selected 
and placed in the hands of pupils for the definite 
contribution that they make to the other subjects 
of the curriculum, aiding in appreciation, but at 
the same time giving pleasure to the readers. Some 
children find such books as “Two Years Before the 
Mast,” “The Cruise of the Cachelot,”’ “Lost in the 
Jungle,’ “Adventures of Two Youths in Ceylon 
and India,” “Boy Travelers in Australia,” “The 
Land of Long Night,” “The Voyage of the Beagle,” 
“Around the World in the Sloop Survey,” “Through 
the Dark Continent,” and many others most in- 
teresting. Some teachers call this reading for in- 
formation; others reading for enjoyment, and. still 
others reading for appreciation. It is silent reading} 
that really possesses all the factors of reading men-| 
tioned. 
It might be argued that classes grow weary with 
books ostensibly literary but having a didactic pur. 
pose. The field is inexhaustible, for there are man; 
books which contain remarkable and illuminatin,

OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 93 
descriptions of particular regions and acceptable 
narrative about important life situations. Such 
material is used by the most progressive teachers, 
not only for geography but also for other subjects 
of the curriculum. 
It is a matter of impossibility to stimulate the 
process of instruction which we call problem solving 
without the vital contact of the pupil with literature 
and reading. The broader the contact of the pupil 
with books, the more vital geography becomes. 
In like manner, the disposition on the part of the 
teacher to be well-informed and the consequent 
companionship with literature and technical read- 
ing permit her to share with the pupils the en- 
joyment it affords her. One of the most vitalizing 
forces in geography is the application of broad 
and sufficient knowledge and of interesting and in- 
structive readings by well-read and progressive teach- 
ers. 
3. Correlation—The adjustment of the program 
to meet the needs of such a process is known as 
correlation. On one day of the week, the reading 
period and the geography period will be thrown to- 
gether; on another day, the reading and the history 
can be combined; and on still another, literature 
and geography; again, geography and written or oral 
language. The same may be true of history or other 
subjects of the curriculum. After pupils have 
learned to read fluently, silent reading in particular 
becomes a means to an end, namely, securing infor-

mation and obtaining knowledge, appreciation, and 
enjoyment.® 
Composition, spelling, and writing as means: geog- 
raphy as an end.—Composition should assume an 
important place in the interest of pupils. If they 
once become habituated to writing about the various 
phases of geographical study from the standpoint of 
interest; if topics about this work are carefully 
selected, then composition becomes a means to an 
end: writing to portray impressions. The best kind 
of compositions, including variety of expression and 
other important factors of this subject, are secured 
only when motives are afforded by much discussion 
and kindly criticism, as well as by provision for 
displaying the papers. 
Spelling ideals, too, are stimulated by such means. 
It is a matter of common information that better 
spelling is secured when pupils recognize their need 
for words, and, in anticipation of this need, learn to 
use the words properly in written work. 
The art of writing words, of penmanship, is also 
aided if such methods are employed. Pupils will 
usually do what is expected of them when they know 
others are going to be interested in what they say 
and write. 
If the proper care is taken to let each pupil se- 
lect his own subjects according to his own interests; 
‘With this idea in mind, it will be observed that, in the reference 
material which is listed in the following pages, occasionally there are 
suggested books and articles which do not, strictly speaking, belong 
to the field of geography, but only indirectly as a means of affording a 
broader interpretation of the problem under consideration. For in- 
stance, often readings in both history and literature are listed.
-P-A-G-E-121
  OTHER AIDS TO INSTRUCTION 95 
if enough attention is given him for the proper de- 
velopment of these subjects, accurate compositions, 
better spelling, and better writing at least should be 
by-products of the process. 
As an example of stimulating the pupil by means of 
a real situation, teachers attest to the fact that both 
enthusiasm and interest are manifested by pupils 
who elect to write letters of inquiry for folders and 
booklets from railroads, industrial and commercial 
houses, chambers of commerce, the government print- 
ing office, and other sources. (See Appendix B). 
When the mail brings to the homes of these pupils 
the requested data, there is usually aroused in the 
pupils a desire not only to read and digest the in- 
formation contained therein, but also to impart this 
information to other people. 
Mathematics and geography—How closely arith- 
metic is linked with geography may be discerned 
from the following statement of Wallis, “The Teach- 
ing of Geography”: 
In matters arithmetical it has become a truism 
that the problems which are placed before the pupil 
should bear some relation to the life which he leads, 
both in and out of school. Hence, even in matters 
of multiplication and division, in the use of decimals 
and the metric system, geography provides a great 
range of subject matter for arithmetical work of 
which correct results might easily be recorded in- 
stead of being consigned to the oblivion which awaits 
useless things. Every teacher of arithmetic pro- 
vides his pupils with a certain amount of drill, and 
if he were to take his drill from the data which are
-P-A-G-E-122
  96 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
used in geography, it would be useful to the geog- 
raphy pupil and would provide him with most of 
the material which he would need. In the content 
of later arithmetic there are many matters which call 
for geographical explanation. It is not suggested 
that all the material for arithmetical computation 
should be geographical, but it is suggested that a 
large amount of the time which is spent in making 
calculations which are useless when completed, be- 
cause their results are of little practical importance, 
should be better occupied in making calculations 
of which the results have an intrinsic value. 
Mathematical problems in geography include a 
variety of topics. Movements of the earth, resulting 
in day and night, and seasons; measurements of time 
and space; latitude, longitude, time belts, compass 
study and use, circles and zones should claim con- 
siderable attention because these conditions have 
helped or hindered the progress of civilization. 
In connection with the above topics, the following 
suggestive questions may prove helpful to those who 
are seeking to vitalize arithmetic through geographi- 
cal study: 
Why are the temperate zones 43 degrees in width? 
Why are the days and nights of equal length about 
March 21st and September 22nd? 
Why does the North Pole have its day during the 
time that we are having summer? 
Why does it have its nights during our winter? 
Why is it that no place except the poles can have 
six months of continuous day or night?

   CHAPTER VI 
CONCLUSION 
It is obvious that the fundamental principles 
implied in the previous chapters exclude the mere 
hearing of recitations, for the pedagogical principles 
advocated in this treatise can not be applied without 
careful supervision of study and intelligent correla- 
tion between subjects. Furthermore, the variety 
of presentation possible under the plan challenges the 
alert teacher to vary the process of instruction from 
time to time. 
Throughout the pages of this book the one prin- 
ciple of training pupils in the correct methods of 
learning must never be lost to view. This is so 
important that it will not be out of place to em- 
phasize some salient principles of the learning pro- 
cess. 
Geography should be taught under conditions in 
which pupils can do their best work.—When pupils are 
comfortably seated in a well-lighted, properly venti- 
lated, and heated room, and under proper discipline, 
a large part of the battle is already won. In the 
geography classroom we are now aware that other 
conditions than curriculum and methods of instruc- 
tion are essential to successful teaching. The ma- 
99     
   
                        
-P-A-G-E-126
  100 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
terials required for the work—books of reference 
properly classified, visual aids ready for distribution 
and presentation, notebooks and outline maps in 
place, wall maps pulled down for the view of all, 
blackboards prepared, etc.—these should be well 
arranged and immediately available for use when 
needed. 
Pupils should have incentives for going to work.— 
When the pupils feel that the teacher “means busi- 
ness,” the next thing they ask is, “What is it all for?” 
If confident of that skilful direction which will effect 
for them economy of time and energy, so that they 
can accomplish more than if each went at the work 
alone, the pupils will have the first motive for doing 
their work faithfully and well. 
The second incentive is the nature of the problem 
to be solved. If this has been selected with the 
proper care and study by the teacher (See pp. 47-51), 
and the pupils receive it as their own, they then have 
further cause for serious work. 
The third motive for study consists in setting 
before thepupilsa certain desired standard of achieve- 
ment during the prescribed time for work. If the 
grade’s work for the day consists of gleaning five 
points toward the solution of the problem, then the 
attainment of these five points in the given time is 
the standard of achievement sought. If the grade’s 
work consists of ten problems in the semester’s work, 
then those who solve these most rapidly should be 
given the opportunity to go ahead. Herein lies the 
value of group instruction, for a premium is placed
-P-A-G-E-127
  CONCLUSION 101 
upon superior intellect and skill; but, at the same 
time, all other pupils have their chance. 
The fourth motive for study is to make provision 
for variety of procedure. ‘The same old thing” 
each day becomes tiresome even if the best method 
is being applied. Conducting the same sort of at- 
tack each day will not win the battle for the general; 
applying the same type of attack on geography 
each day will not win the battle for the teacher. 
Pupils should be taught how to use reference and 
supplementary material in the most economical and 
effective manner—The effective use of books of 
reference for the purpose at hand is an important 
part of the training involved in the study of the sub- 
ject of geography. Pupils should know both how to 
obtain information from books and how to gain 
facility in the use of reference books, particularly 
through the use of the index and the dictionary. 
Sustained effort should be maintained while study- 
ing geography.—If pupils have the motive for wishing 
to do good work, their activities should continue 
efficient throughout the geography period. High- 
grade effort involves beginning promptly and finishing 
with a spurt. When pupils desire to make good rec- 
ords, they even put forth additional effort at the 
end of the task. 
Teachers should make sure that pupils know with 
what the business of the hour is concerned.—In taking 
up a new problem or in the process of solving an 
old one, an attentive attitude toward the business 
at hand reinforced by a definite assignment, is de-
-P-A-G-E-128
  102 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
sirable. If the problem is “working” properly, the 
learners will not do “blind alley” work; the main 
object of the study will be definitely before them. 
Assistance should be rendered when and where it is 
needed. In developing an outline of data related to 
a problem, care should be taken that the system does 
not become so elaborate as to spoil the purpose. It 
is necessary for pupils to secure information and ar- 
range this in effective order; but in general, detailed 
written analysis is not necessary. Sometimes the 
best kind of work is done when pupils jot down 
this or that, make marginal notes, or underscore main 
topics in the text. Helpful only where help is needed; 
guidance only where pupils are hopelessly faltering; 
surveillance for purposes of rendering aid when this 
is necessary—these constitute the principles of 
effective assistance. While it is necessary, yet it is 
extremely difficult for school pupils to gain facility 
in selecting the essential facts and principles con- 
tained in the books they read or the material they 
manipulate. Even as they progress in the course, 
acquiring greater power in this respect, there is never 
a time when pupils do not need wise and careful 
guidance. 
It is a necessary part of the work that pupils 
sometimes memorize verbatim; but it is also essential 
that pupils should become accustomed to memorizing 
ideas rather than mere words. The problem method 
seeks successful orientation from the question-and- 
answer method. Teachers who so utilize their 
power as to lead pupils to see important facts con-
-P-A-G-E-129
    CONCLUSION 103 
noted by words or objects, that these readily give 
up their meanings, are possessed with consummate 
skill. In this connection, rote memory plays a 
very small part. There are times, however, when 
not only meanings are important, but also the 
words and names in which these meanings are in- 
corporated are of supreme importance. When mem- 
ory is required to seize upon these, there should be 
neither hesitancy nor lack of appreciation of such 
necessity by the pupils. 
Each pupil should be conscious of the fact that the 
teacher is willing to devote to him a certain amount 
of individual attention. The codperative class or 
socialized recitation is one in which each and every 
pupil is accomplishing those results which he can 
best do for the good of the class as a whole. All 
pupils can not be treated alike, for they differ among 
themselves in aptitudes and capacities. 
After the completion of a period of relatively de- 
tailed study in the solution of a problem, there fol- 
lows the necessity of both an arrangement of the 
ideas and facts and a review of the details. The 
problem method possesses a very significant value 
in that, while studying in parts, the relationship of 
each part to the purpose or problem should never be 
obscured. During the whole investigation—a syn- 
thetic process—each portion of matter studied should 
be tested as to its relationship to the problem at hand; 
and then this or that portion should either be selected 
and used or be rejected. 
Once solved, however, and the whole structure 
      
     
           
     
-P-A-G-E-130
    ‘104 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
of the problem completed, it becomes necessary to 
concentrate attention on each individual’s difficulties. 
After these have been cleared up, the entire organiza- 
tion is to be reviewed, and the various elements are 
to be linked together to afford a comprehensive study 
by the class of the entire situation.

CHAPTER I 
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 
Thirteen sections of geographical material for the 
grades with illustrative problems and some reference 
material are presented in this chapter. These 
sections seek to show the following: 
1. Geography is a continuous school subject, with 
the subject matter designed to enrich the conscious- 
ness by giving a vision of geographical environment 
as wide as the world itself. As a general rule, teach. 
ers have textbooks with definitely assigned directions 
for teaching by sections and by pages, instructions 
which are usually contained in a course of study. 
Sometimes a teacher forgets to take stock to find out 
what is the relative importance of the material 
contained in the course and for what purpose it is 
intended. Hence, these sections do not attempt to 
present the subject matter of a school geography 
text, for this would be superfluous; but they do 
present information which can be used with any 
textbook in geography. g 
2. By the time the elementary school is com- 
pleted there should be presented a carefully selected 
number of items, grouped about a few major topics 
and possessing a psychological and definite plan by 
121
-P-A-G-E-148
  
  122 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
which pupils may develop the topics to a definite 
conclusion. To this end the problem type of pre- 
sentation is adopted, and the problems given must 
necessarily be stated as if they were those of the 
pupils. As a matter of fact, problems are often 
raised by pupils themselves. This habit can be 
developed by setting forth the situation out of which 
problems should arise, by getting pupils to ask ques- 
tions. Then the problems can be stated. The 
problems given in these sections should be helpful, 
in that the solution of them should be the means 
to the attainment of the knowledge and skill funda- 
mental to the pupils’ assignments. At least, it may 
be helpful to teachers to know where they can secure 
suggestive problems bearing upon the part or parts 
of geography which they are teaching. 
8. Making and developing problems is attended 
with some difficulty; but once this difficulty is sur- 
mounted, then teaching geography is far more at- 
tractive, both to teachers and pupils. The problem 
about Brazil, Section 9, pp. 200-210, is a complete 
problem, containing directions as to method and 
procedure. 
4. The modern viewpoint of teaching principles 
involved in the study of each continent as a whole 
should be in the possession of every teacher of the 
subject. Then problems can be evolved. To this 
end, a brief sketch of each continent as a whole is 
presented. It must be left to teachers to construct 
their own introductory statements to pupils to 
precede the construction and the development of
-P-A-G-E-149
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 123 
problems for those possible situations out of which 
problems naturally arise. Hence, in the latter in- 
stances, only illustrative problems can be given in 
the following pages. 
5. While the regional treatment of geography 
is preferable, one can construct good problems by 
using the political classification. (See pp. 189-151). 
6. While minimum essentials of place geography 
are necessary to the successful teaching of the sub- 
ject, those essentials which are given in these 
sections are simply suggestive of some of the facts 
which should receive particular emphasis, thus 
stressing the importance of such essentials. 
7. The type and topical methods can be used 
in the teaching of geography. The topical method, 
in particular, can be employed as a means of organi- 
zation of data for the solution of problems. 
8. Reference material is necessary for successful 
teaching. In all instances in which problems are 
used, some reference material is given; in some in- 
stances, considerable reference material is employed. 
As a rule, however, the latter is not attempted, be- 
cause large libraries are not available to all teachers, 
and hence little practical value would result. As a 
general rule, it may be said that the references which 
are given are simply suggestive. Should library 
facilities be available to teachers, such material as is 
needed can be organized and applied to the purpose 
at hand in accordance with the best practice of teach- 
ing the subject. Otherwise, teachers should see 
to it that at least a minimum amount of reference
-P-A-G-E-150
  124 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
material is provided for teaching that part of the 
subject which is assigned to them. 
9. It is necessary for a teacher to plan her work 
by surveying the field she is to teach. She must 
select her reference material, plan her projects, con- 
sider what problems she would like to have raised 
by the pupils, and make requisition for the material 
which she desires in her laboratory. Geography, 
like science, needs equipment. 
1. Observational geography, map study, and 
excursions.—The general content of this section 
consists ot what is usually called “observational 
geography.”’ Subjects receiving consideration are, 
weather observations, how the people of the pupil’s 
locality work and live, map study and the use of 
maps. By means of this kind of instruction, the 
background for a later and fluent understanding of 
geographical principles may be established. 
Weather observations include not only a daily 
record of weather conditions but also monthly and 
seasonal summaries. The pupils do the work under 
direction of the teacher. The temperature is taken 
at the same hour during the day; the direction of 
the wind and its influence upon the weather are 
noted; and the kind of day is made a matter of rec- 
ord. 
The sun’s apparent daily path across the sky is 
observed and the following phenomena are noted: 
where the sun seems to rise and set; at what time it 
stands highest in the sky; when it is lowest in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 125 
heavens, and the consequent variation in the length 
of day and night. 
One should see to it that children’s attention is 
directed to changes in seasons, to the occupations of 
people as affected by these seasons, and to the plant 
and animal life due to these seasonal changes. 
The study of how the people of the pupils’ locality 
work and live may best be undertaken by setting up 
a number of problems. For instance, using the city 
in which the pupils live as a unit, this main problem 
could receive attention: Why do the people of my 
city work? Two statements attach themselves to 
this problem. These are, (1) people work to provide 
themselves with the necessities of life—food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter, and (2) people work to obtain for 
themselves some of the comforts of life. Two minor 
problems contribute to the solution of the main 
problem, Where do people work? and, How do they 
get to their work? 
Another main problem helps in the study: In 
what kinds of work do people engage? In solving it, 
six statements could be developed: (1) food is so 
necessary that people work in places where it is dis- 
tributed—wholesale markets, retail markets, gro- 
cery stores, dairies, restaurants, etc. People also 
work in places where food is manufactured, in 
places where food products are raised, and in places 
where food is transported. Type studies of a market 
and a milk depot also contribute to the appreciation 
of the study. (2) Clothing is so necessary that 
people work in department stores, distributing 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    
126 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
centers, and in places where clothing is manufac- 
tured. (3) Shelter is also necessary to the people 
of a city; therefore they build houses, stores, and 
many other buildings. (4) In order to distribute 
materials for food, shelter, and clothing, people are 
engaged in transporting these materials to and from 
places. This transportation is carried on by land, 
by water, and through the air. (5) In order for 
people to transact business with each other, they 
work in banks and in the postal, telephone, and 
telegraph services. (6) People must be protected 
by laws which are made by them for mutual benefit; 
hence, people work in the service of the city, state, 
and national governments. 
The third main problem is, What do people do 
besides work? They must have recreation, so they 
frequent movies, theaters, playgrounds and parks, 
libraries and other places. Worship is necessary 
for most people, so churches and cathedrals are 
erected. 
Study of the geographical conditions—climate, 
surface, natural resources, transportation, and com- 
munication—assists in solving the fourth main 
problem, What enables the people of my locality to 
maintain the industries they have? 
The use of a simple map will aid in the solution of 
the fifth and last main problem, What should I know 
about my city? Show and explain the use of a 
compass; teach the cardinal and semi-cardinal direc- 
tions; locate the school building on the map and then 
locate other places with due regard to directions,
-P-A-G-E-153
  
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 127 
When excursions are undertaken, simple, rough 
maps can be made on which the directions can be 
indicated. More accurate maps of the schoolroom, 
school house and even school yard, drawn to scale, 
will prove helpful.

2. Interdependence and the study of child life. 
In the previous section, projects concerned with 
weather observations were recommended. This in- 
struction should be extended to include the effects 
of dew, frost, snow, hail, sleet, rain, and fogs. Par- 
ticular attention should be directed to the action of 
rain in making soil. 
Whether one had rather live in the country or in 
the city is a main problem which includes three minor 
problems: How is the city dependent upon the 
country? How is the country dependent upon the 
city? How are both dependent upon the ‘state 
as a whole? Consideration of these problems forms 
a study of interdependence. Organize the informa- 
tion about the following topics: food supply, shelter, 
fuel, clothing, water supply, transportation, and raw 
materials. 
Follow this with a series of development questions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  128 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
What would you see to interest you on a trip through 
such-and-such a valley? Why would you like to 
take a trip to a near-by town? Describe the life of a 
farmer. In what respects is the life of a miner 
different from that of a farmer? What do you know 
of another city in your state? How did you learn 
it? What can you find out about your state by 
visiting the State Fair? 
Desk outline maps can be filled in, showing the 
products of the state. (See Appendix B). 
It is essential to use a globe to locate continent 
and water areas in connection with child life in other 
lands. The use of pictures is also necessary. Col- 
lect, classify, and mount the pictures; then file them. 
Constant use of the sand table adds greater interest. 
Only three studies are given here: the mountain 
child, the desert child, and the Eskimo child; but 
these illustrate the possibilities of instruction by 
anecdote and story, comparisons and contrasts. 
Two problems can be employed to cover these 
studies: How and why do the Swiss children differ 
from us? and, Contrast the life of the desert child 
with that of the Eskimo child. 
In solving both of these problems, the following 
brief facts are suggestive of the method of successful 
procedure. In addition to the use of a globe to 
locate the homes of the Swiss, the desert, and the 
Eskimo child, make use of interesting and instruc- 
tive pictures. If the construction of sand table 
scenes is possible, use this means of instruction. 
When reading assignments are made, take care that 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 129 
each pupil is properly directed to read in order to 
obtain some particular information—some will find 
out about the kind of clothing worn, others about 
the food eaten, others about the houses, some 
about work and play, and still others about the way 
in which the people travel. The socialized recitation 
which is progressing by such a method will be com- 
pleted when these groups and individuals make their 
contributions to the class.

3. The world as a whole, the Middle Atlantic 
States, and the New England States.—The weather 
observations which, in the previous sections, have 
been made by means of experiments and projects, 
have introduced the pupils to the method of attain- 
ing knowledge at first hand. Information about 
child life in other lands has, in the main, been 
achieved by means of directed reading. 
It is now proposed to introduce pupils to an 
elementary study of the world as a whole, in which 
activity both projects and problems are necessary. 
To the end of inculcating the idea of seasonal
-P-A-G-E-156
  
130 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
changes, certain experiments should assist. Select- 
ing a post in the school yard, pupils may make records 
of the length of the shadow at or near noon upon the 
same day of each week; and particular attention 
may be directed to those observations made on 
March 21, September 22, December 21, and June 22. 
Observe the gradual lengthening of the shadow until 
December 21; then observe the gradual shortening 
up to June 22. With the lengthening of the shadow, 
notice the apparent movement of the sun toward the 
southern horizon; and with the shortening of the 
shadow, observe its gradual movement toward 
the zenith. 
Establish the following facts and provide for drill 
upon them: In winter the days are coldest and short- 
est. The sun is low and the rays are slanting. The 
longest shadow occurs on December 21. In summer 
the days are longest and warmest. The sun is high 
and the rays are nearly vertical. The shortest 
shadow occurs on June 22. In spring and autumn 
the days are mild and almost equal in length to the 
nights. They are equal on March 21 and September 
22. 
This idea may be developed further if the pupils 
take observations of the weather at stated intervals 
and record these observations in some convenient 
way. The records should show the date, tempera- 
ture, in degrees,and whether hot, warm, cool, or cold, 
whether the sky is clear or cloudy, the amount and 
form of moisture and whether this moisture is in 
the form of rain, snow, fog, sleet, or hail, the amount
-P-A-G-E-157
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 131 
of wind and direction as indicated by the weather 
vane, the shape of the moon and its apparent loca- 
tion in the sky, the apparent location of the sun in 
the sky at sunrise, noon, and sunset, time of sunrise 
and sunset, and the record of the length and direc- 
tion of the shadow as indicated by the shadow-stick. 
The monthly summary of these same things would 
show general weather conditions, prevailing winds, 
temperature, phases of the moon, and changes in the 
length of day. After these projects, pupils should 
be ready to gain a ready appreciation of newspaper 
weather reports. 
' Demonstration experiments on evaporation and 
condensation can assist. The following directions 
illustrate how these experiments can be conducted. 
Place the same amount of water in two dishes 
of the same size and shape, the one on the warm side 
of the room and the other on the coolest side. Watch 
the change. Water evaporates in the form of vapor. 
Make any other observations of evaporation. 
Contrast by whatever means is simplest, the 
melting of ice on a cold day with that on a hot day. 
Place a small pan of water over strong heat, and 
observe the cloud form. Hold a cold plate in the 
vapor, and watch the drops of water form. Heat 
the plate and watch the water disappear. Observe 
clouds rising from walks and roofs on a warm day 
after a shower, or steam from kettles, or moisture on 
windows, or frost on a cold day. 
Place two glasses in a room, one filled with ice 
water and the other with tepid water. Observe
-P-A-G-E-158
  138 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
water collect on the former. On a cold day, watch 
ice crystals form on a cup of water out-of-doors. 
What may happen to a glass or pitcher if water is 
allowed to freeze in it? 
Measure rainfall and snowfall after storms by plac- 
ing a deep, tin pan in an open space during the storms. 
Measure the depths of rain or snow in the pan. 
After such experiments the way is made clear to 
undertake a formal study of dew, frost, snow, fogs, 
and clouds and an assignment for recitation may be 
made. 
All of these phenomena have a decided effect 
upon the earth. Hence, how soils are formed, the 
kinds and character of each, are essential to the 
instruction. The use of a manual or of a general 
science will be of distinct aid in providing the material 
for this. 
Development questions should not be neglected, 
hence the following are suggested: What seasons 
do we have in the course of a year? What would be 
the effect if we had winter all of the time? Where 
are the countries which do have winter most of the 
time? What kind of people do we find living in cold 
regions? How do they live? What kinds of plants 
have they? From what has been studied, what 
have the number of hours of sunshine and the de- 
gree of the slant of the sun’s rays to do with the 
different portions of the earth?

Turning now to the textbook, formal study of the 
following topics might well be pursued: the earth’s 
shape and movements with the relation of the move- 
ments of the earth on its axis to our day and night 
and around the sun to our seasons; land masses, 
map and globe study of the continents, comparative 
size, location in zones and life on these continents; 
map and globe study of the oceans, location in zones, 
continents that border the oceans, effect of the oceans 
upon land, comparative size and importance; tem- 
perature belts, names of each, climatic features, 
characteristics of people living in the different belts, 
and an elementary study of plant and animal life 
in each zone. 
Consideration of say, two questions about the 
World War should add interest to the discussion: 
From what countries and by what routes did the 
Allies get sugar, meats, fats, wheat, wool, cotton, 
copper, gasoline, and coal? and, From what countries 
did the Allies get their man power? 
With the use of desk outline maps, the pupils are 
now ready to trace one or more of our important 
exports—wheat, cotton, or meat—to world markets. 
Then important reciprocal relationships can be 
developed by directed reading in answer to such a 
question as, Upon what countries are we dependent 
for the things we use at breakfast? 
Globe study should find a ready introduction if 
the pupils’ interest in child life, which has previously

been developed, is appealed to. Imaginary journeys 
could well be taken around the continents. 
Finally, certain historical stories about discoveries 
of continents and oceans and the routes followed by 
the explorers (traced upon the globe or maps) com- 
plete the study of the subject, the world as a whole. 
In taking up the study of the divisions of the 
United States, begin with the group in which you 
are located, and then follow with the groups upon 
which you are most dependent. The information 
which is thus obtained should be organized according 
to some good plan. A topical outline suggests the 
form; problems suggest the method. If pupils are 
well taught, there is comparatively little difficulty 
in getting them to study the remaining groups of 
states independently by the assignment of prob- 
lems relating to these groups. 
The Middle Atlantic States.—The topical outline 
should include the following: leading cities, in- 
dustries, shore line, surface, climate, people, products 
(raw and manufactured), communication, and trans- 
portation. 
Minimum essentials of place geography are neces- 
sary to geographical study. For example, in the 
study of the Middle Atlantic States, tell one im- 
portant fact about Niagara, Hudson, Susquehanna, 
Potomac, Delaware, Erie Canal, Great Lakes, Buffalo, 
Albany, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Atlantic City, 
Wilmington, Annapolis, Washington, Adirondacks, 
Catskills, Blue Ridge, and Alleghany. Name and 
locate the states of this section.
-P-A-G-E-161
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 135 
By means of the assignment of a problem, the im- 
portant facts of the topical outline and the above 
minimum essentials of place geography of the 
Middle Atlantic States can be taught. The prob- 
lem suggested for the study of this group of states is, 
Why is the Middle Atlantic group of states a most 
desirable place in which to live? 
The information which can be secured by the ex- 
amination of several minor problems will contribute 
to the solution of the problem just stated: Are these 
states advantageously located? What can be found 
out about the climate? Are the advantages for 
education good? What are the means and what 
is the extent of transportation? Are the food prod- 
ucts abundant? Are they varied? What are the 
possibilities of occupation? Of recreation? 
The main problem may be developed according 
to the organization which follows. Whenever sta- 
tistical information can promote discussion and aid 
in instruction, it should be employed. When statistics 
are used, be sure they are up-to-date. 
Manufacturing is easily maintained in these states, 
because certain raw products—lumber, iron, and 
coal—are abundant. The Delaware, Susquehanna, 
and Ohio rivers afford water power. Food products 
—meats, grains, vegetables, and fruit—are plentiful. 
Labor is relatively easy to obtain. 
Both climate and soil admit of many forms of 
agriculture. These states, situated in the cool, 
temperate zone, enjoy short winters and a long 
season for vegetable life to mature. The coastal
-P-A-G-E-162
  136 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
plain is adapted to trucking, because the soil is light 
and sandy; and, besides, the ocean is generous in 
providing moisture for crops. The central plain 
is a grain region, and in the mountain section 
cattle and fruits are raised. 
The situation of these states favors both domestic 
and foreign commerce. Located between the South- 
ern and New England States, it is the distributing 
region between the North and the South. Further- 
more, these states border on the Great Lakes, from 
which bodies of water the great western trade is 
shipped via the Erie Canal. Foreign commerce is 
facilitated by good harbors, which are connected 
with the inland by navigable rivers and by railroads. 
In addition, these harbors are within easy reach of 
the markets of Europe. 
Minimum essentials of place geography should be 
summarized according to requirements and re- 
corded in note books for future reference when the 
pupils will need to use them in the solution of other 
problems.

The New England States—The problem sug- 
gested for the study of this group of states is, Why 
can New England be called a great workshop?
-P-A-G-E-163
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 137 
The people of New England, energetic because of 
a stimulating climate, are engaged in many industries. 
Manufacturing is easily carried on, not only be- 
cause of the magnificent water power which is 
furnished by the falls and rapids of the rivers, but 
also because of the acquired skill of the people. 
Attracted by opportunity, immigrants have come in 
hundreds of thousands to its shores. 
Early in the history of this section, the people 
found it profitable to import raw material from 
other sections of the United States. Cotton in 
immense quantities finds its way to the New Eng- 
land mills and clothing, household, and cotton goods, 
thread and string are manufactured; wool is con- 
verted into clothing, blankets, and carpets; hides 
are made into boots, shoes, harness, pocket books, 
and many other articles. 
The forests afford work for many men, for the 
trees must be cut, hauled to the mills, and con- 
verted into lumber, boxes, furniture, barrels, and 
paper. The sugar maples of Vermont are famous 
because of their delicious product. 
Fishing has remained an important industry in 
New England. Mackerel, halibut, cod, and lobsters 
are caught in large quantities. Fish are cleaned and 
salted by being soaked in brine and dried for ship- 
ment. 
Granite, marble, and slate are quarried in great 
quantities. Paving stones, curb stones, blocks for 
buildings and monuments are made from granite, 
which is blasted by dynamite. Marble, being

relatively soft, is sawed and used for buildings, 
statues, and monuments. Slate is broken into thin 
slabs and is used for roofing and school blackboards, 
It follows that, with so many manufactured prod- 
ucts, New England’s commerce, both foreign and 
domestic, is extensive. Raw products are brought 
into New England and manufactured articles sent 
away by rail and by water. Ports of great import- 
ance have been provided by nature. Boston is a 
great shipping point, and this port and others are 
connected with the interior by railways. There are 
many industrial and commercial cities in New Eng- 
land. From the list of cities of the United States 
in the geography text, it would be interesting to 
count the number which are located in this section 
of the United States. 
Many minor problems can easily be added to these 
two: Why is Boston called the “Hub City’? and, 
How does New England life differ from that in Mary- 
land?

cotton. This commodity is raised in large quanti- 
ties in the Southern States because there fertile soil, 
plentiful rainfall, and a long, hot season are furnished 
the cotton plant. The soil is perfectly suited to the 
growth of cotton because of the fertile coastal plain 
which extends to the Ohio River and because of the 
rich lands which are fed by the Mississippi River. 
Because the Southern States are situated in the 
warm half of the temperate zone, the cotton plant 
has the benefit of the sunshine of long, hot summers. 
Across the Gulf of Mexico come winds laden with 
rainfall, and this constitutes the final requisite for 
cotton culture. 
Since cotton is very extensively used in the world, 
pupils may, with advantage, be directed to find out 
what needs cotton fills and to what uses it is put; 
in what other places in the world it is grown and why 
it grows in these places; where it is manufactured 
in largest quantities and why; and what part the 
Southern States play in the manufacture and ex- 
portation of cotton. 
In the South many cotton mills have been erected. 
In North Carolina more cotton goods are manu- 
factured than in any state, with the exception of 
Massachusetts. While New England has more mills 
than the South, nevertheless, because of the plenti- 
fulness of the raw product, because of good water 
power,® coal fields, and mountain-white labor, forty 
per cent. of the spindles in the country are located   
3One of the largest hydroelectric plants in the world is situated at

    ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 
in the mills of the Piedmont section of the Carolinas, 
Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. While the south- 
ern mills have secured local supplies of labor, north- 
ern mills have had to employ many immigrants. 
Under present conditions, it appears that both 
southern and northern mills may soon be forced to 
seek some new source of labor. y 
The total number of spindles in the United States_ 
at present is about thirty-five million. This is about 
twenty-three per cent. of the total number in the 
world. 
The demand for cotton goods has been increasingly 
steady all over the world. In some countries like 
India and ‘China, primitive industrial methods are 
popular. For example, more than one half of the 
cotton used in China, it is estimated, is woven on 
hand-looms in peasants’ homes. On one of these 
hand-looms only about four yards of cloth are 
woven by a weaver in a day. On one power-loom, 
such as is used in the United States, the daily out- 
put is about fifty yards; and each weaver in an 
American mill tends from six to thirty of these 
power-looms. Both the great demand for cotton 
goods and the use of labor-saving machinery have 
made it possible for the southern mills to manu- 
facture not only yarns and the cheapest grades of 
plaids and sheetings but also the best of cotton 
goods. 
In addition to manufactured cotton products, 
much raw cotton is exported from the South; and 
hence, there are many cotton markets there: Gal- 141

-P-A-G-E-169
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 143 
The Mississippi River is a great, natural highway 
of trade, because it not only receives mighty tribu- 
taries from regions thousands of miles apart— 
Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, Wisconsin and the region 
of the Red River—but of itself it affords an outlet 
to many inland cities. While this is as true to-day 
as it was many years ago, the direction in which the 
Mississippi River flows is not now as advantageous te 
either these regions or to these cities as previously. 
Before the Civil War, the Mississippi River was one 
of the great commercial arteries of the United States; 
but, in 1825 the Erie Canal was built and products 
began to be transported in the direction in which this 
led. In 1850 railroads appeared, and the number 
grew in enormous proportions. 
These new, artificial competitors have steadily 
encroached upon the natural supremacy of the 
“Father of Waters.’ The number of boats on the 
Mississippi is decreasing. In 1916 there were less 
than two million tons of freight transported between 
Memphis and Vicksburg, and most of this was sand, 
stone, and gravel. There were only one million 
tons transported between St. Louis and Cairo. 
Traffic in coal has declined to one half of what it was 
fifteen years ago, lumber to about one eighth and 
grain to about one fifteenth. 
The flood plains of the Mississippi are extremely 
productive. Along its way from its source to the 
Gulf of Mexico a deep, rich soil suitable to 
many crops—cotton, sugar-cane, and grains—is af- 
forded. Silt, brought down by the many rivers of
-P-A-G-E-170

the system, forms the largest contribution to this 
fertility. 
The Central States, with their broad plains and 
remarkable fertility, do not look to the Mississippi to 
receive their products for transportation, but rather 
to the railroads and the Great Lakes. 
But the Mississippi is still serviceable and its 
usefulness is now being greatly improved.‘ Levees 
have been erected to keep the rising water from 
flooding the fields and destroying the crops and rail- 
roads; jetties have been built along the banks of the 
river; and bills, seeking national aid for improve- 
ment of this waterway, have been introduced in 
Congress.

Should the teacher desire to correlate this study 
with that of history, this could be done by using the 
problem: Suppose George Rogers Clark had not 
conquered the Northwest Territory? (See p. 89). 
The Western States —The great movement to carry 
on the work of irrigation was given a successful 
start during the administration of Theodore Roose- 
velt. In his message to Congress, December 3, 
1901, he said, in part, “The reclamation and settle- 
ment of arid lands will enrich every portion of our 
country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and 
Mississippi Valleys brought prosperity to the At- 
lantic States.” 
Nature has been generous to America; but, in the 
vast West there are many acres of arid land. Al- 
most one fifth of the United States is unfit for culti- 
vation, and most of this land is in the western sec- 
tion of our country. One half of the 32,000,000 
acres of desert land has now been reclaimed by 
federal and private irrigation enterprises. 
Thus it is that one is brought to consider the prob- 
lem, How and to what extent has man overcome 
nature on the Western Plains? 
If, in attempting to solve this problem, the pupils 
are guided in their activities, the brief statements of
-P-A-G-E-172
146 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
method which follow are indicative of how the 
problem may be solved. 
Interesting questions present themselves. How 
did Montana help to win the World War? Con- 
trast a farm in Arizona with one in Minnesota. 
How did our forefathers reach Salt Lake City? Why 
has Denver grown so rapidly? Why do so many 
people visit the Western States? 
What are the natural geographic conditions of this 
section? Most of the winds which reach these 
states have been robbed of their moisture by the 
Rocky Mountains. Snow and rain on the mountains 
feed the Missouri, the North and South Platte, the 
Arkansas, and the Yellowstone rivers, which flow 
across these states. 
Some of the difficulties which nature has im- 
posed have been overcome by means of irrigation. 
Canals and ditches now lead off water from the 
rivers to the once arid land. Dams and reservoirs 
have been built by the government. 
Magnificent results have accrued from irrigation. 
The rapid settlement of the West was given impetus 
by it. Now grains, vegetables, fruits, grass, cattle, 
and sheep—rich products of this district—are at the 
disposal of the inhabitants. Every portion of the 
United States, as Theodore Roosevelt predicted, 
has been enriched. 
The people in other parts of the United States are 
not fully informed concerning the results which 
have been obtained during the last twenty years by 
means of federal, state, and private irrigation enter
-P-A-G-E-173
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 147 
prises. There are now under irrigation a little more 
than fifteen million acres, which is about one half 
of the total land available for opening up in this 
way. The United States Reclamation Service is 
authority for the statement that the value of land 
irrigated by the government alone, has increased 
from ten dollars to two hundred dollars an acre. 
The production of the irrigation projects, constructed 
and owned by the government, in 1919 amounted 
to more than eighty million dollars or about two 
thirds of the entire capital invested in these projects 
by the government. 
These irrigated areas in the West are producing 
crops of even greater abundance than those in humid 
regions. The reason for this is that the water which 
is applied to the land is given to it artificially, and 
thus the climatic conditions are assisted by this 
control of rainfall, so to speak. 
The products of these irrigated regions are ad- 
vertised to the world. If, as a class project, the 
number of advertisements in a few magazines of food 
products of this section are compared with those 
of any other section, the result will be interesting. 
After recounting these brief statements and 
amplifying and complementing them with reading 
and up-to-date statistics, the minimum essentials 
of place geography should not be neglected.

States claim that theirs is a “Land of Opportunity.” 
Can this claim be justified? 
In order to help the pupils, the following briet 
suggestions of method and statements of fact will 
prove helpful. 
Guide the activities of the children by assigning a 
number of minor problems. Why is California the 
“Fairyland of America’? Contrast the methods of 
farming in southern California with those in the 
northern part. Contrast a wheat harvest in Wash- 
ington with one in Minnesota. Why is San Francisco 
the “Gateway to the West”? What cities are rivals 
of San Francisco? What has Luther Burbank done 
to deserve the name, ‘“‘Wizard of the Plant World’’? 
In how many ways does California stand first in the 
amount of her products? What great natural re- 
sources are the mainstay of this region? Is irriga- 
tion necessary? Is it extensive? What geographi- 
cal advantages does this region possess? In this 
latter problem, consider the climate (temperature, 
rainfall, character of the seasons,) and the scenery. 
Farms in this region are extremely productive. 
The rapid advance of the United States to a position 
of great prosperity among the nations of the world
-P-A-G-E-175
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 149 
has been caused chiefly by the development of ar- 
able lands. In the Pacific States, land which is not 
readily productive, has been irrigated, and it is not 
uncommon to find an acre of land giving from ten to 
twelve tons of alfalfa, or from one to two hundred 
bushels of potatoes, or from fifty to one hundred 
bushels of corn. Fruit trees grow in immense quanti- 
ties, and every effort is made to raise the maximum 
quantity of fruit. For instance, bee culture is en- 
couraged, not only for the sale of honey and bees- 
wax, but also for use in pollenizing the blossoms of 
the fruit trees. 
The people of the Pacific States seek to attract 
desirable people to their section, and hence they 
have set about reclaiming their desert lands be- 
cause they see in this a sure means of increasing the 
population and wealth of their respective states. 
They are utilizing to the fullest extent the oppor- 
tunities which lie within the boundaries of the 
Pacific States. 
Besides, reclaimed deserts, mighty forests, rich 
mines, and grand mountains add to the attractive- 
ness of this once unexplored wilderness. 
This area is not thickly settled, as examination 
of the area and population of these states in com- 
parison with the Eastern states will prove. For 
instance, the area of Oregon, which is by no means the 
largest state, is greater than that of both Penn- 
sylvania and New York, though its population is only 
one eighteenth of these states. The State of Mass- 
achusetts could be placed in a single county in Oregon,  
-P-A-G-E-176
  150 ‘TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The people of the Pacific Coast are enthusiastic 
about their section and are energetic in advertising 
their goods and in placing them in Eastern markets., 
Even though the haul across the continent is long, 
they have entered into successful competition for the 
control of the fruit markets of the country. In one 
year the State of Washington shipped eighteen 
thousand carloads of apples to various markets. 
Many problems can and will, in all probability, 
be brought out by the pupils. In Appendix A (pp. 
263-278), two more problems, which follow the re- 
gional treatment, are given. 
Type studies, too, form a valuable method of study 
of these states. The surface, as a whole, is a mile 
above sea level, with ridges of mountains frequently 
towering two miles or more high. The entire 
region is so great in extent, so varied in quality of 
soil, and so wide in range of temperature and prod- 
ucts, that teachers attest to the fact that a number 
of type studies can convey an excellent geographical 
notion of the entire region. These type studies 
afford an opportunity to present the physical features, 
irrigation, dry farming, herding or ranching, fishing 
and fur trading, mining, fruit growing, and lumber- 
ing? 
As has already been suggested, (pp. 81-83), this 
region as well as other sections, can also be taught 
advantageously by means of journey geography.

A general study of the United States as a whole.— 
In a study of this character, codperative reading to 
determine the development and present status of our 
country is necessary; and thereby a perspective 
of the United States as a living and developing 
whole should be obtained. In the study, each 
pupil should become acquainted with the importance 
of how and why all should work together in the 
nation’s business. 
Minutely accurate statistics are not necessary, but 
round numbers, which can be more easily retained in 
memory, may be regarded as representative of essen- 
tial conditions. 
Knowledge of our land and our people is necessary 
for a fundamental appreciation of our nation’s life. 
The complete geographical story of the United
-P-A-G-E-178
  
152 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
States is extensive. In this elementary study the 
salient features only can be treated, and the story 
must be abridged to cover a few hours of intensive 
study. The activities of both pupils and teacher 
must be directed to the organization of the in- 
formation which will be gained. This is but an- 
other way of saying that proper methods of study 
must be applied to the subject. 
The main problem for consideration is not to de- 
termine whether the United States, in case of isola- 
tion by a great war or by some world catastrophe, 
could be self supporting, but rather to inquire into 
our country’s capacity and the disposition of our 
people to keep the United States the safest place 
in the world in which to live. 
Supplementing the geographical story with les- 
sons which point out the genius of America in 
various lines of activity definitely related to geo- 
graphy should form a part of this study. The 
necessity, in modern life, of preserving food so that 
it may be used throughout the year; the production 
of food in sufficient quantities to feed the great cities 
and make city life, and hence great industrial produc- 
tion, possible; the use of labor-saving machinery; 
inventions and science; concentration of population 
and industries; conservation—all these and more, 
help to unfold the whole story of man’s conquest 
of his environment.‘

ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 153 
The minimum essentials of the previous studies 
about the different sections of the United States 
need to be applied; and all the ideas which have been 
gained, should help in this study of the country as a 
whole. 
Teaching by groups can assist, since it is possible 
to assign to different groups of pupils respective 
topics, questions and mincr problems for which 
they must be responsible to the class by reporting 
the answers. (See pp. 74-75). 
Questions in geography textbooks may or may not 
be development questions, for the answers may be 
simply a series of unrelated, isolated facts. In what 
section of the United States would you rather live? 
Why? Why is the East more thickly populated than 
the West? Is it worth while for the United States to 
spend so much on irrigation? Why? This type of 
question, relating in series to some specific study, 
and the answer to which leads the pupil to the 
appreciation of related information, is the kind to be 
employed. The responsibility of expert instruction 
in a study of this kind is obvious, for the important 
purpose of it is to instil a patriotic pride in our 
country’s activities. 
In what important ways did the United States 
contribute to the winning of the World War? In 
what ways is our country richly endowed by nature? 
Have these natural conditions been advantageously 
developed? Surely, the consideration of these and 
similar problems would lead to the appreciation of 
the position and size of our country; the physical  
-P-A-G-E-180
  154 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
factors which influence production—climate, soil, 
latitude, altitude, winds, ocean currents, topog- 
raphy, and rainfall; vegetation—drainage, irrigation, 
agriculture, and natural productive areas; industrial 
sections—minerals and manufacturing; animal life; 
communication and transportation—ports and com- 
merce; people—distribution of the population in rela- 
tion to occupations, cities, and rural communities. 
In the development, the significant reasons why we 
should play the important part we do in the world’s 
affairs should be stressed. What has caused our 
rapid advance to a position of great prosperity among 
the nations of the world; our dependence upon 
foodstuffs; how the United States is able to maintain 
her industries—these and dozens of other questions 
should be answered as the horizon of knowledge and 
appreciation of our country broadens.

5. Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Central America, 
outlying possessions of the United States, Cuba, and 
the West Indies.—Take care, in the initial stages 
of each of these studies, to dwell carefully upon the 
strange names which must be encountered. Hereto- 
fore, the pupil has had comparatively little difficulty 
in the immediate recognition of names; but now he 
is to be introduced to puzzling mixtures of conso- 
nants and vowels. Provide for sufficient association 
and application, for adequate recall and review of the 
difficult names which are important. 
The complete study of each subject involves con- 
sideration of the following topics: location, com- 
parative size, coastline and surface, climate, vegeta- 
tion, minerals, and manufacturing occupations, com- 
munication and transportation, and the distribution 
of population relative to occupations. 
Alaska —Alaska was bought from Russia in 1867 
for $7,200,000. Has this purchase proved a good 
investment? The suggestions of method which 
follow indicate how the problem may be solved. 
Consideration of the following minor problems 
may prove helpful: Why have many people emigrated 
to Alaska in recent years? Is it likely that more 
people from the United States will go to Alaska? 
Why would a trip to Alaska prove interesting and 
instructive? How did Alaska help to win the World 
ar? In what respects are Alaska and the Scan- 
inavian countries similar? Is Alaska a desirable 
lace in which to live? 
The total area of Alaska is as great as that of Great

Britain and the Scandinavian Peninsula. It is al- 
most twice as large as the area covered by the orig- 
inal thirteen states, and the climatic conditions are 
about as different in Alaska as in the thirteen colo- 
nies. From the northern to the southern boundary 
is a distance equal to that between the Canadian line 
and the Mexican border. From east to west the 
distance is 2,000 miles. 
The minerals of Alaska have paid many times the 
purchase price, for, since 1867 (to 1920), it has pro- 
duced $437,465,930 worth. Gold, copper, and coal 
are mined in enormous quantities. Since rail- 
roads have been built across the mountains, mining 
is being still further developed. The construction 
of the Alaskan Railway was a government enter- 
prise which called forth the heroic pioneering qual- 
ities of the Americans who built it. 
The fisheries have also paid many times the 
amount paid for the country. Fish products since 
1867 (to 1920) have reached the total of 
$413,749,223. Salmon, cod, and halibut are the 
principal catch. 
The fur-bearing animals have, since 1867 (to 1920), 
put $84,704,428 into the hands of the United States. 
The government protects the seals, and hence they 
are not being exterminated. Those companies which 
engage in the fur trade pay the government a special! 
privilege tax. 
On the seaward slope of Alaska, forests are ver. 
valuable, since they yield spruce, the wood of whi 
is used for boxes, wood pulp, and airplane framing.

yellow cedar, fir, white pine, and balsam fir, which 
is used for tanning. Twenty-seven per cent. of the 
area of Alaska is covered with forests. Of this, 
about 31,000 square miles—about the area of Maine 
—are covered with merchantable timber.

Canada and Mexico——Both Canada and Mexico 
can be studied advantageously if a comparison is 
made of the two countries. The following problem 
will serve the purpose: Why has Canada progressed 
more rapidly than Mexico? The brief statements 
and minor problems which follow point to the salient 
features which should receive attention. The de- 
velopment should be amplified. 
An examination of the trade relations between the 
United States and Canada will answer the question, 
Why are Canada and the United States good friends? 
The absence of extensive trade relations with Mexico 
has been caused by the fact that American capital 
could be profitably invested at home, and because the 
Mexicans speak a foreign language. Because of the 
lack of reciprocity treaties, because of the lack of 
direct steamship lines, because of the absence of
-P-A-G-E-186
    158 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
stable government in Mexico, and because of in- 
adequate railroad facilities, the United States has 
found further cause to neglect trade relations with 
Mexico. Consequently, it is European capital that 
has helped develop Mexican industries. 
Although the British Government has given land 
to settlers in Canada, and thus assisted in the develop- 
ment of that country, the population of Canada is 
much smaller than that of the United States. Large 
numbers of American farmers from time to time leave 
the United States and emigrate to Canada to take 
advantage of the tillable lands available in this 
neighbor’s territory. 
The natives of Canada are from better classes of 
people than those of Mexico, and the Canadians are 
reckoned among the foremost farmers of the world. 
The industries of Canada are more numerous and 
better developed than those of Mexico. 
Examination of the governments of the two coun- 
tries will also help to account for the difference in 
prosperity.

   Central America.—Using the descriptive and il- 
lustrated pamphlets of the Pan American Union, 
magazine articles, combined with the reading matter 
in the geography textbook and supplementary geo- 
graphical readers, the importance of Central Ameri- 
can countries to the work of the world can readily 
be determined. 
Outlying possessions of the United States—These 
possessions are Alaska, the Philippines, the Hawaiian 
Islands, Porto Rico, Canal Zone, Guam, and Tut- 
uila. Suggestions for the study of Alaska, the 
Philippines, and Hawaii have already been presented. 
Porto Rican industries are wholly agricultural, 
sugar, coffee, and tobacco being the most valuable 
products. Transportation facilities are not good. 
Two problems could be presented for considera- 
tion: Why has Porto Rico progressed? and, Why 
did the United States purchase the Danish West 
Indies? 
Not only should it be impressed upon the pupils 
that an important possession like the Panama Canal 
eds to be protected, but also the means employed 
0 secure this protection should form an essential 
art of the instruction. To this end, it would be

well to consider how the United States has helped the 
Canal Zone (health and sanitation), and whether 
the Panama Canal has proved a paying investment 
to America. ‘ 
The government announced that, for the fiscal 
year of 1919-1920, there was a net profit of 
$2,387,599 from the income of the Panama Canal. 
An annual amount greater than this, however, must 
be reached before the construction of the canal will 
become a paying investment. .The total cost of its 
construction, exclusive of expenditures for pro- 
tective armament, was $366,650,000. Although it is 
not paying financially, it is paying in other ways, 
for through its use there has come about a great 
stimulation of American trade with the west coast of 
South America as well as with the Orient. 
Guam is one of the Ladrone Islands and is im- 
portant as a naval station. Tutuila, one of the 
Samoan Islands, is a coaling and a naval station. 
Both of these possessions are of strategic importance 
and help to secure the interests of the United States 
in the Pacific. In the foreign trade of the United 
States, these possessions occupy a significant posi- 
tion. (See Section 11). 
The new possessions of the United States in the 
Pacific and the rapid development of the Pacific 
Coast made it necessary for the government to 
undertake the construction of a canal through the 
Isthmus of Panama. America has begun a new 
policy of expansion and has entered the race for world 
trade. Although warning the nations of Europe to;

keep away from the Western Hemisphere, the United 
States now possesses land in the Eastern Hemisphere. 
The historical story connected with these possessions 
is interesting and absorbing. :

Cuba.—Cuba is the largest of the West Indies, and 
is an independent republic. Main problem: It is 
said that a country advantageously located, with 
abundant food and resources, prosperous farmers, a 
stimulating and healthful climate, easy transporta- 
tion, excellent sea coast, and good opportunities for 
recreation, is, geographically speaking, an ideal 
country. Does Cuba, a great garden, possess all 
of these advantages? 
Development 
I. Position: 100 miles south of Key West, Florida. 
Size: 780 miles long, varying in width from 
20 to 100 miles. Area, 44,215 sq. mi., the 
size of either Pennsylvania or New England. 
It takes 24 hours by train or 48 hours 
by steamer to go from Havana to San- 
tiago. 
II. Coastline and surface: There are 2,000 miles of 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
162 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
coastline. As is characteristic of the West 
Indies, it is somewhat mountainous. Why? 
Three fifths of Cuba is fertile plain and 
about one fifth swampy region. It is some- 
times called the “Island of a Hundred Har- 
bors.” In the pamphlet “Cuba” (Pan 
American Union), p. 1, there is a description 
of Santiago harbor. 
III. Climate: Cuban summers are like our July 
and August; their winters like our April 
and May. Breezes blow from the ocean. 
The trade winds temper the heat; the 
nights are cool. On the coast there is ma~- 
laria; but, generally speaking, it is not an 
unhealthy country. Summer resorts are 
plentiful. 
IV. Vegetation, minerals, and manufacturing oc- 
cupations: The sugar crop of Cuba is worth 
more than one hundred million dollars, 
when the price of sugar is high; their tobacco 
brings thirty-five million or more; their 
citrus fruits bring ten million or more; 
pineapple, honey, asphalt, iron, henequen, 
mahogany, cedar, and cacao bring them 
fifteen million or more (Statistics of 1919). 
Cigar factories are abundant. Iron, man- 
ganese, and copper are the chief minerals. 
See pamphlet, Cuba, pp. 16-20 (Pan American 
Union). 
V. Communication and transportation: Havana 
is a modern city. There are yaved streets, 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 163 
electric lights, sewerage, and water works; 
stores are modern; banks, libraries, schools, 
churches, and modern theaters serve the 
people. The high office buildings are met- 
ropolitan. The suburbs of the city are 
connected by electric lines, and railroads lead 
from the interior to the harbors. Cuba has 
2,360 miles of railway lines; 200 miles of 
electric railways. The island is 54 miles 
from Haiti, 130 miles from Yucatan, and 85 
miles from Jamaica. 
VI. The people of Cuba: Cuba has 24 cities con- 
taining 25 per cent. of the population. Its 
population is largely native, engaged in har- 
vesting the sugar, tobacco, and fruit crops. 
Government—(Consult a good history). The 
government, a republic in form, is in the 
hands of a president chosen by popular suf- 
frage. He serves four years and appoints 
his own cabinet. The Congress consists of a 
Senate and a House, one representative be- 
ing chosen for every 25,000 inhabitants. The 
provinces, of which they have six, correspond 
to the American States, elect their own 
governors and control their internal affairs.

The West Indies.’—The following problems about 
the islands of the West Indies are presented without 
suggestions for their development: How important 
is Jamaica to Great Britain? What necessities do 
the Bahamas contribute to world trade? If Haiti, 
under the protection of the United States, becomes 
civilized, of how much importance could it become? 
How important is Trinidad to Great Britain? Why 
are the Bermuda Islands well known? 
6. The continent of Europe.—Modern Europe is 
best understood through the study of both its history 
and its geography. In order to gain at least an ele- 
mentary geographical knowledge of this continent, 
the different regions or physical characteristics may 
well be studied first. With a map of Europe before 
the class, the most important physical features should 
be investigated by the pupils. What are the most 
important and interesting features? This question 
and the problem, In what ways is Europe, one of the 
smallest of all the continents, fitted to be the home 
of so many different countries? can be answered by 
studying in accordance with the outline and sugges- 
tions which follow. 
7]llustrative material about Bermuda and the West Indies can be 
obtained from the Quebec Steamship Co., New York City; about Haiti, 
the Dominican Republic, and the Panama Canal from the Pan American 
Union, Washington, D. C., and about Trinidad, from the Barber Asphalt 
Company, Philadelphia. Illuminating and interesting reading matter, 
including illustrations, about any of the studies given above, can be found 
in the issues of the National Geographic Magazine. If both time and 
interest will permit, the wealth of material which can be secured from 
the above sources will serve to acquaint pupils with “some little-known 
marvels of the Western Hemisphere.”

The Great Central Lowland stretches across 
northern Europe from the Pyrenees to the Ural 
Mountains and embraces about two thirds of the 
continent’s area. This lowland is triangular in 
shape, with the base on the eastern boundary and the 
apex near the shores of Holland. It separates the 
mountain systems of Europe, the Scandinavian or 
highlands of northwest Europe in the north from the 
Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Balkans, and Caucasus 
in the south. Since, within this area, an abundance 
of fish and game and extensive forests exist, agri- 
culture has not developed. Because of the lack of 
defensive barriers within the lowland, constant 
warfare has been waged. Earlier than can be 
traced, there was an immense emigration from the 
base of the Altai Mountains (Asia), which spread 
over northern Europe. This, with other migra- 
tions and subsequent settlements, caused many 
peoples to make their homes in Europe. The lands 
along the great river valleys, possessing superior ad- 
vantages, became densely populated. What peoples 
have been attracted to the countries lying within 
the lowlands? Do the physical conditions make 
the nationalities secure? How have they existed? 
The highlands of northwest Europe or the Scan- 
dinavian Highlands are noted for their beautiful 
scenery. In both Scandinavia and Scotland, the 
land is not conducive to farming, though this does 
not mean that none of the land is tillable. The 
climate is cold and wet. The soil is rocky and there 
is to be found great wealth in both forests and fish-

  166 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
eries. What peoples have been attracted to this 
region? What are their claims? Do the physical 
conditions make the nationalities secure? How do 
they exist? 
The Mediterranean region, accessible to the entire 
continent of Europe, may be said to be the play- 
ground of the continent. The Mediterranean Sea 
is connected with the Black Sea by the Dardanelles, 
Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus. The Suez 
Canal connects it with the Red Sea. The chief 
rivers which flow into it are the Rhone, the Po, and 
the Nile (from Africa). The Mediterranean Sea is 
famous in history, poetry, and ancient story. Of the 
countries bordering the Mediterranean, Phoenicia, 
Greece, and Italy have, since ancient times, been 
the cradle of civilization. 
The Mediterranean Sea, one of the most important 
water routes of the world, is separated from central 
and northwestern Europe by mountains. These 
mountains have been pierced by three tunnels: Mt. 
Cenis, St. Gothard, and the Simplon. There are six- 
teen great passes over the Alps, and famous marches 
across them have made them well known in history. 
Why is manufacturing not an important industry 
with the Mediterranean people? What nationalities 
are now settled in these countries? Are their father- 
lands secure? 
The region of the Pyrenees and the highlands of the 
northern part of the Iberian Peninsula, possess cer- 
tain geographical advantages. On both north and 
south, the mountains, sinking down to the plains in a

series of terraces with precipitous faces, offer a pro- 
tective barrier to the people. This region is rich in 
iron ore and forests. Recreational advantages are 
afforded the people. : 
The region of the Alps is one of the most famous 
of the world. As an important barrier between the 
Italian Peninsula and the Great Central Lowland, 
it has been necessary for man to overcome this diffi- 
culty. The lofty east and west mountains affect 
the climate of the lowland to the north. Streams 
from the Alps not only supply water power, but also 
afford water for irrigation purposes. This region, 
sometimes called the “Playground of Europe,” is 
both a summer and winter resort. While grazing 
is important and lumbering is extensive, few min- 
erals are found. A large number of different coun- 
tries have made claim to this region. 
The people of the Carpathian region have not 
found their ancient nationalities secure. This por- 
tion of Europe, which has recently witnessed ex- 
tensive political changes, included the old Austrian 
Dominions and the Plain of Hungary, one of the rich- 
est of the lands of Europe. Forests, steep precipices, 
and narrow ravines combine to make the Carpath- 
ians a magnificent sight. In this region cattle and 
sheep abound. There exists an extensive forest belt 
and mining is an important industry. Where .are 
the large cities of this region located? What causes 
determine their locations? 
The mountainous Balkan region, a peninsula in 
form, once afforded protection to many backward

and unprogressive people. In what condition do 
the nationalities of this region now find themselves? 
How did they make a living in the past? With re- 
cent political changes once settled, will the condition 
of the people be improved? 
The Caucasus Mountains form a part of the bound- 
ary between Europe and Asia. The Caucasus Range 
has been called the “mountain of languages” from 
the many tongues, distinct from one another, and 
having little or no similarity to other languages of 
the world, which are spoken in this narrow region. 
The mountains are so lofty and present such difficulty 
to those who would cross them, that, until recent 
years, there was little intercourse between the people 
living upon opposite sides. Even now there are but 
two roads across the mountains: the Derbend Pass 
and the fine military road built by the Russians 
through the Dariel Gorge. 
The mountains, between the Black and the Cas- 
pian seas extend west-northwest and east-southeast. 
If they had extended north and south instead, they 
would have been effective in checking ancient mi- 
grations. The Black Sea, the Sea of Azof and the 
Caspian Sea afforded a water route around these 
mountains, at the base of which are valuable forests 
because they are extensive in a part of the world 
where forests are scarce. Streams from the moun- 
tains furnish water for purposes of irrigation. The 
climate of practically the entire region is agreeable. 
Some sixteen or more distinct and well-marked races, 
including the Georgians, the Circassians, and the
-P-A-G-E-197
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 169 
Armenians, are found in the region of the Caucasus. 
Recent political changes have occurred and terri- 
torial changes have been made. 
Thus it was that the irregular coastline and the 
complex mountain system of Europe geographically 
attractive, naturally invited peoples of different 
aptitudes and capacities to settle, as many nations, 
in this relatively small area. The new ideals re- 
garding countries, as a result of the World War, 
would guarantee to each race or nationality, however 
small, the right to live as an independent govern- 
ment. How has this principle affected the map of 
Europe since the World War?

Illustrative problems.—In. the development of that 
section of the Great Central Lowland between the 
Vistula and the Duna and Dnieper rivers, the 
following problems might be considered. At the 
conclusion of the study of the minor problems sug- 
gested, the facts should be organized in the form of a 
brief summary. 
The first main problem to be considered is, Do you 
think this section of the lowland should possess 
superior transportation facilities? Why? 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
    170 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The organization of the facts which would lead to 
the solution of this problem could follow from a study 
of some minor problems. What are the opportunities 
for river transportation? What is the combined 
length of river traffic? Why do these rivers possess 
less volume of transportation than those of the west- 
ern part of the lowland? What canals have been 
dug to permit transportation from one river to an- 
other? Examine a railroad map of Europe. Does 
this portion of the lowland possess many railroad 
lines? How are Petrograd and Moscow connected 
with the rest of Europe? Examine a physical map of 
Europe, and note particularly the relief, soil, climate, 
and presence of farms. Would one expect to find 
good roads here? What products are raised in this 
region which need transportation to markets? Trace 
theroutes. Which routes are most favored? Where 
are the coal fields? What commodities must be im- 
ported? 
Another problem might be considered: What 
advantages have the Baltic countries of Esthonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, East Prussia, Poland, and western 
Russia because they are located in the Great Central 
Lowland? 
From a list of the ports of Europe, select those 
which the entire lowland contains. Determine 
whether Libau, Riga, and Petrograd are favorably 
located. What is the relation of the cities of the 
above countries to the rivers and to the seas? What 
is their relation to the commerce of the country?

Why should Memel be under control of the League? 
A number of interesting questions might also be 
considered. Why has our acquaintance with the 
people who live in this section of Europe been lim- 
ited? Why is interest centred upon them at the 
present time? Have the people who live here enough 
geographical advantages to warrant extensive geo- 
graphical study? 
The Races of Europe, a map published by the 
National Geographic Society, will be of assistance 
in this study. With the aid of this and other maps, 
the reading and study of the recitation will be de- 
cidedly stimulated. 
The interdependence of people, the appreciation of 
which is so important, requires the consideration of 
other problems. It is for this reason that no one 
region can be separated and studied entirely alone. 
The peoples of the world are inextricably bound to- 
gether by economic bonds. 
The industrial population of western Europe re- 
quires food. What effect has this need upon agri- 
cultural pursuits in Europe? 
In order to find out why the people of the eastern 
lowland are behind those of the west in comforts, 
arts of modern life, and industries, it is necessary to 
note that the eastern people are unprotected from 
Asiatic invasions; the streams are sluggish, and hence 
there is lack of water power; the mountainous life in

certain sections preserves early conditions; and the 
region, as a whole, is remote from the centres of civil- 
ization. 
Many of the large cities of the western lowland 
are situated upon estuaries or rather, bays. Deter- 
mine why this is true. 
The Great Central Lowland: Russia—Russia is 
such a large country, the area embraced by it is so 
extensive and varied, it is in such close proximity to 
Asia and its physical characteristics are so similar 
to those of Asia, that the study of Russia might well 
beundertaken immediately before either thecontinent 
or the countries of Asia are considered. In other 
words, this country’s geographical story might be 
called a transitional narrative which contributes 
many ideas that will prove useful when the class will 
seek to gather data about the Orient. 
A problem which would assist in such a study is 
connected with a marketplace in Russia. Many 
fairs, or markets, have been held at Nizhnii Novgo- 
rod. Why should this place be selected for an annual 
exhibition of products of Europe and Asia? 
What does one find out about the surface of the 
country around Novgorod? Locate Archangel. Lo- 
cate Odessa. Which is the more important port? 
Compare the location of Novgorod in Russia with 
that of St. Louis in the United States. What are the 
opportunities of river transportation to Novgorod?

would furnish the fair; Asia Minor; Turkey in Asia; 
other countries. On an outline map, show the routes 
followed to the fair. 
The surface of the country surrounding Novgorod 
is generally flat. The site is easily accessible to all 
the lowland of Europe both by land and water; 
it is also easily reached by Asiatic peoples. 
The rivers flow from north to south into four seas. 
The sources of the rivers are near together, and canals 
afford continuous waterways for 5,000 miles or more. 
The situation of St. Louis in the United States is com- 
parable. 
Many articles of trade can easily be brought to 
Novgorod. By way of the Dwina, lumber, fur, coal, 
iron, and platinum can be brought; by way of the 
Dnieper and Don the route is opened to Turkey, 
Arabia, Persia, and India. Rugs, leather, and tobacco 
come from Turkey, coffee from Arabia, and from 
India, muslins, spices, shawls, carpets, and rugs. 
Silks, cotton, fruits, and wines come from the Medi- 
terranean countries, chinaware and metal goods from 
Germany, and glass and wheat from Austria. Eng- 
land sends cutlery, jewelry, iron and steel goods, and 
France supplies cloth. Up the Volga, boats bring 
fish and oil, astrakhan, mats, hides, and perfumes. 
Overland, by the Trans-Siberian Railway, tea, rice, 
and silk come from China. From Riga, by the Duna 
and Volga, amber can be transported from Lithuania. 
From Warsaw, cotton and woolen goods, glass and 
chinaware are sent. 
A type study of Russia.~-Russia has one sixth of

  174 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
the land area and one twelfth of the population of 
the globe. Explain her lack of progress. 
Russia has suffered and is now suffering from the 
effects of misgovernment. Until 1917, there was an 
* unlimited monarchy and a corrupt bureaucracy. 
The power of the Duma was limited under the Rom- 
anoffs. There was every evidence of lack of social, 
religious, and political freedom. Not only have the 
masses been kept illiterate through lack of educa- 
tional advantages, but the people have been re- 
pressed in every walk of life by the cruelty of the for- 
mer police. 
The population is largely composed of Asiatic 
peoples. There are more than forty different lan- 
guages and races in Russia. Up to a short while 
ago, serfdom existed in reality, though not in name, 
for the land was owned by barons who exerted their 
power over thousands of farmers. (See pp. 12-13). 
The physical characteristics of Russia have played 
a large part in prohibiting progress. The seacoast is 
meagre. There are few ports, and most of these are 
ice bound during a large part of the year. The 
country’s area is so large that the community spirit 
is lacking. Because of many swamps and marshes, 
transportation overland is difficult. The absence of 
defensive boundaries has led to constant warfare and 
to invasions from Asia. The climate is so disagree- 
able in the north that these people, seeking a better 
abode, have sought to overrun the lands in the south. 
Under these conditions, one would not hope to find 
up-to-date methods of industry in vogue. Russian 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS WS 
methods of agriculture are primitive. Though many 
minerals are available and forests are plentiful, the 
natural resources, through lack of personal initiative, 
are not utilized. Most of the manufacturing that is 
done is carried on by means of primitive methods of 
home industry. It is only occasionally that one 
finds a modern industrial plant equipped with labor- 
saving machinery. 
Because of recent political changes and the terri- 
tory occupied by new European nations, Russia’s 
area has been diminished. 
The minimum requirements of place geography 
should include Volga, Petrograd, Odessa, Warsaw, 
Archangel, Vladivostok, Kola, Caucasus, Ural, ete. 
In contrasting the new Russia in size and area with 
the old Russia, note Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, Finland, and Ukraine. (See pp. 244-259). 
7. The countries of Europe.—A general directive 
problem.—A large number of the countries of Europe 
are densely populated. Emigration isa partial result 
of this condition. European nations depend upon 
one another and upon other countries of the world te 
furnish them with those things which they desire or 
need but which they do not raise or produce. At the 
same time, each nation is seeking to be independent 
of other countries or self-supporting. 
What are the most obvious means of self-support 
which a densely populated country of small area 
seeks? The country can try to increase its area 
within the continent by securing adjacent territory
-P-A-G-E-204
  
176 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
or an outlet to ocean trade. Or, by building canals, 
by arranging for drainage, and by irrigation projects, 
the country can reclaim land within its own bound- 
aries. Or, the country can seek lands elsewhere or 
establish colonies, to which immigrants can be sent, 
manufactured products sold and from which raw 
materials can be secured. 
The country can set science to work on its existing 
resources. If this work is successful, by-products, 
which have heretofore been wasted, can be made use- 
ful. Improved methods of agriculture and of manu- 
facture, intensive farming on the fertile lands, the 
use of less fertile lands for grazing and breeding pro- 
fitable animals—these and dozens of other ad- 
vantages help to increase the productive power of 
the country.

The British Isles.—Bringing the facts above to 
bear upon Great Britain, which has more colonies 
than any other country in the world, these questions 
might be asked: Of what advantage are colonies to 
Great Britain? What help does she render colo- 
nies? (Protection, government, etc.) Why is it 
necessary for Great Britain to maintain a large navy 
and merchant marine?

   ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 177 
In answering these problems, the minimum re- 
quirements of place geography are rather extensive 
because of the importance of so many places and 
possessions. The following should be listed: Sur- 
rounding waters—North Sea, British Channel, Irish 
Sea, St. George’s Channel, and the Strait of Dover; 
important rivers—the Severn, the Thames, the Firth 
of Clyde; important cities—London, Liverpool, 
Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, 
Queenstown, Belfast, Glasgow, and Grimsby; im- 
portant colonial cities—Ottawa, Halifax, Vancouver, 
Quebec, and Montreal in Canada, St. Johns in New- 
foundland, Melbourne, Sidney, and Canberra in 
Australia, Wellington in New Zealand, Delhi, Cal- 
cutta, Bombay, and Madras in India, Johannesburg,

   France-——The story of France as one of the four 
great manufacturing and commercial nations can be 
developed from the problem, How can France sup- 
port such a large population? 
The location of France is favorable to its commer- 
cial development, for it is within easy reach of other
-P-A-G-E-206
  178 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
European countries, it is opposite America and it is 
convenient to Mediterranean trade. 
The surface of France has helped not only to de- 
velop its industries but also to protect its people. 
Natural barriers on the south and east have kept 
away the invasions of foes. Swift rivers, in their 
course through the country, furnish water power. 
In the mountains, minerals are mined, iron and coal 
furnishing occupation for thousands. 
France boasts of a coastline on three sides; it 
possesses important seaports; it makes extremely 
good use of its rivers; and its cities are known 
throughout the world. 
The people of France enjoy a favorable climate, 
for the country receives warm winds from the Gulf 
Stream and the Mediterranean, and one can go to its 
mountains and find the climate to suit the taste. 
Under these conditions the people are industrious 
and skilful and enjoy the protection of a liberal 
government. Add to this the love of art, which 
seems characteristic of the people, and there is no 
wonder that Frenchmen are content to live within 
their native boundaries. 
In addition to these suggestions, a number of 
questions will assist in further study. Why are we 
interested in France? Why were the French anx- 
ious to regain Alsace and Lorraine? Does France 
occupy a favorable position for agricultural pur- 
suits? (Compare with the Baltic, North Sea, and 
Mediterranean countries.) Why is France attract- 
ive to tourists? ;

Germany.—Prior to the World War, Germany was 
a great manufacturing and commercial nation, 
particularly jealous of Great Britain and possessing a 
large portion of the beautiful Rhine River. To de- 
termine why Germany was a great manufacturing 
and commercial nation, why she was jealous of Great 
Britain, and what advantage to the world there is in 
making the Rhine an international highway, form 
three interesting problems for investigation. 
Locate and study: Berlin, Essen, Hamburg, Kiel, 
and the Rhine River. Using a world map, locate the 
colonies Germany lost by the World War and an- 
swer, Being bereft of these colonies, what ad- 
vantages will Germany lose? 
Italy.—Italy’s story forms a large part of the his- 
tory of Europe, for its location makes it an im- 
portant link of communication between Europe and 
the Far East.
-P-A-G-E-208
  180 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
In 1453 the Turks captured Constantinople. The 
three great eastern trade routes which started from 
Italy were then blocked. England, Portugal, and 
France were then in a more favorable situation for 
world commerce. With the opening of the Suez 
Canal, the trade routes again led through the Medi- 
terranean; the mail and express now go overland 
from France and England to Italy, and from thence 
to Egypt, India, China, and Australia. 
Develop fully the reasons that make Italy an 
important link of communication between Europe 
and the Far East. 
Why do so many southern Italians come to the 
United States? Why do so many of them wish to 
return to Italy? Why has Italy failed to make the 
same progress in manufacturing and commerce as 
Germany? What has Italy done to become self- 
supporting? 
Among the minimum essentials in connection with 
the study of Italy, some historical and artistic phases 
of the influence of Rome would find ready application 
in the study of that city; and Venice, Milan, Naples, 
and Genoa have contributed in large measure to the 
world’s civilization.

Switzerland—In addition to the main problem, 
What influence has Switzerland upon the world?
-P-A-G-E-209
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 181 
the following minor problems could be presented: 
(1) Switzerland was free from invasion during the 
World War. Why? (2) Why is Switzerland a pros- 
perous little country? (3) Switzerland is sometimes 
called the “Playground of Europe.” Why? (4) 
What important lessons does Switzerland teach the 
world? 
In the solution of the problems, the following 
suggestions are offered. Being inland and moun- 
tainous, Switzerland has been protected from inva- 
sion. The gorgeous mountains have attracted tour- 
ists from all over the world, while the fertile valleys 
have yielded a sufficient supply of food. The rais- 
ing of cattle and goats and the making of dairy prod- 
ucts are large industries. Fruit cultivation is also 
extensive. 
The manufacturing that is done is highly special- 
ized. The principal exports are watches, toys, music 
boxes, carved wood, buttons, clocks, embroidered 
goods, silk and cotton fabrics. 
Good roads penetrate most parts of the country. 
By means of excellent railroads through the St. 
Gothard tunnel, which is 9} miles in length, and the 
Simplon Pass tunnel, which is 12 miles in length, one 
can easily pass beyond the confines of the country 
by rail. By way of the Rhone Valley, one can reach 
Paris, and by the Arksburg tunnel, Vienna. In 
fact, communication with the countries surrounding 
Switzerland is made comparatively easy, and great 
volumes of freight can be transported because of the 
Jow railroad rates which obtain.

People from all over the world come to view the 
magnificent sights of the Alps and other scenic won- 
ders. Consequently, many good hotels, providing 
ample accommodations for thousands of tourists, 
have been erected. Since Switzerland is a land noted 
for its scenic beauty and startling phenomena, a 
series of lessons in journey geography can be made 
out and used effectively.

and Cushing (Wiley). 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark—In 
studying Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, 
the following may prove helpful suggestions. Why 
would a trip to Norway be interesting? Germany, 
during the World War, continually insulted the 
Scandinavian people. Why did they not resent it? 
Why is Finland called the “Land of a Thousand 
Lakes”? Can you see any reason why Norway, in 
the World War, leaned toward the Allies and Sweden 
toward the Central Powers? Finland was recog- 
nized as a new and independent republic by Great 
Britain on May 6, 1919, and by the United States 
on May 7. Can Finland compare with Sweden in 
importance? Is the port of Kola a better one than 
Helsingfors? Why do the people of Norway, Sweden,
-P-A-G-E-211
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 188 
and Denmark speak similar languages and have the 
same civilization? Have topographical conditions 
assisted in bringing this about? Why is Copen- 
hagen a famous port? 
The United States, by the purchase of Alaska, is 
greatly interested in the development of this posses- 
sion. Can the United States learn anything valu- 
able from Norway, Sweden, and Finland? 
The latitudes of Norway, Sweden, and Finland are 
identical with those of Alaska. Seward, in Alaska, 
is almost on the line with Christiania and Stock- 
holm. The area of Alaska is greater. 
To Norway and Sweden many European tourists 
go in search of recreation. Few American tourists 
visit Alaska, although it is reported by those who 
have had the opportunity to compare the Scan- 
dinavian advantages of recreation with those of 
Alaska that the scenery of Alaska is more pictures- 
que, that the mountains are more sublime, that a 
climate suitable to any one can be selected, and that 
eventually Alaska will become a summer playground 
for the Western Hemisphere. 
Norway, Sweden, and Finland contain a popula- 
tion of about 11,000,000, while Alaska possesses only 
about 55,000 people, among whom there are only 
30,000 whites. The Norwegians maintain extensive 
timber and fishing industries and engage in dairying. 
The Swedes are farmers. It is pointed out that 
Alaska has even more arable land than Sweden and 
decidedly more timber than Norway at its disposal. 
As yet, Alaska has no dairying industry.
-P-A-G-E-212
  
  184 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Contrary to the general belief, cereals grow in 
northern countries with remarkable rapidity. It 
is said that in Uleaborg, Finland, oats, barley, and 
rye, the staple crops, require only seventy to eighty 
days from the time of seeding to maturity. Having 
long summer days, the frozen ground is thawed, and 
that part of the subsoil which remains frozen, acts 
exactly like a stratum of rock. Being impenetra- 
ble, the products of vegetable decay remain on the 
surface and a rich humus results. This is well 
adapted to the growth of plant life. 
Reindeer are important to the Scandinavian 
countries. Smoked reindeer tongues and reindeer 
meat find ready sales in their markets. The skins 
of the reindeer are useful and valuable, for they can 
be converted into gloves, bindings for books, ete. 
Glue is made from the horns. It is predicted that 
Alaska will be able to support large numbers of 
reindeer which, in time, will help to support a large 
number of people. The government has taken steps 
in this direction, and the reindeer industry of Alaska 
is under the direction of the Bureau of Education, 
Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C. 
The fact that Stockholm has a large population of 
about 340,000 people and because many other cities 
thrive in the Scandinavian Peninsula, encourages 
many to believe that cities of considerable size will 
develop in Alaska. In fact, observations of the 
prosperity of the people in the Scandinavian Penin- 
sula and study of the methods they employ in agri- 
culture, cause many to look with optimism toward
-P-A-G-E-213

the increased usefulness of Alaska to the United 
States.

Holland.—For the study of Holland see Chapter 
IL, pp. 20-22. 
Belgium.—Belgium, although only as large as our 
little state of Maryland, possesses a population which 
is about six times as large. Within this small area, 
coal, iron, zine, sand, and clay are found, and thriving 
factories are at work converting these raw materials 
into finished products. The people raise sheep and 
manufacture the wool into cloth, carpets, and rugs. 
From flax, they produce linen and lace. From the 
forests they get lumber and wood pulp, which they 
convert into paper. 
Not only are they a manufacturing people, but 
they have decided advantages for commerce.. There 
are navigable rivers, good railroads, a complete 
system of canals, and they have access to the sea. 
Since the World War, Belgium has rapidly forged 
ahead to her former position of prosperity. 
Is there any wonder that, with such a small area 
and such a large population, Belgium should seek to 
enlarge her territory? Has she succeeded in doing 
this? 
Since Belgium is confined to a small area, since it
-P-A-G-E-214
  186 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS | 
possesses a large population, and since the people 
are engaged in manufacturing and commercial pur- 
suits rather than in agricultural pursuits, could it be 
said that, although a nation, Belgium is really noth- 
ing more than a great city?

Some countries of southern Europe-—One must 
consult the old map of Europe to find the location of 
the former Balkan States. What has become of these 
states? Why did they create trouble in European 
affairs? 
The people of the Balkan States have remained 
backward. The theory is advanced that these 
people, at one time, were simply stragglers of the 
famous Crusaders—people from the various coun- 
tries, who, years ago, made pilgrimages across this 
section of Europe for many centuries. In the sur- 
vival of the fittest, some never reached the Holy 
Land, but sought refuge in the mountains, mixed 
with the few natives there and built up states. Under 
Turkish misrule, these people kept up continuous 
warfare from their mountainous homes.

lems. Of what advantage was it to internationalize

Austria, formerly rivals, subsequently foes, finally 
joined hands again in the World War. 
Other countries of Europe-—The new map of 
Europe (which is now found in the new geogra- 
phies), shows that new nationalities have, as a result 
of the World War, been carved out of the old area 
of Europe. Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Czecho-Slovakia, Jugo-Slavia, Montenegro, Ukraine, 
a new Austria and a new Hungary now appear."

8. Asia, Africa, and Australasia.—The continent 
of Asia.—Although Asia is considered the oldest of 
the continents, being regarded as the cradle of the 
human race, people are astonishingly unfamiliar with 
its history and its geography. In the past, various 
domestic conditions prevailing on this continent, 
have, individually or collectively, tended to produce 
this situation, such as the caste system, nomadic 
life, ancestral worship, and religious asceticism. The 
result of these and other repressive influences has been 
the stifling or the retarding of the spirit of modern 
progress in Asia to such an extent that for years the 
people of the rapidly advancing western nations 
ceased to view her with interest and enthusiasm. 
Recent awakening and rising importance-—However, 
within the last half century there have occurred 
significant events in this part of the globe, many

of which are in actual progress at the present mo- 
ment; and these are evolving numerous problems 
vitally affecting our own interests and, at the same 
time, effectually influencing the course of modern 
civilization. For example, the ports of Japan and 
China are open to foreign trade. The penetration 
by missionaries proved to be an entering wedge to 
foreign influence which has been extended by armies 
of conquest and by business interests. Great 
Britain, dominating India and controlling the im- 
portant seaport of Hongkong on the coast of China, 
has exercised upon those countries a constructive in- 
fluence of progress by introducing machinery, de- 
veloping agriculture, improving sanitary conditions, 
and establishing schools. Russia had developed 
some modern methods of economic and industrial 
achievements within her own vast Asiatic territory. 
Japan has come to be considered one of the most 
progressive nations of the world; and China, recently 
imbibing the spirit of progress, is now building rail- 
roads, establishing factories, developing internal 
resources, and remodelling her educational system. 
In southwestern Asia, new nations have risen upon 
the stage of history, evolving democratic govern- 
ments and claiming the interest and attention of their 
western neighbors in the struggle. Natives of 
Asiatic countries are now pursuing courses of study 
in European and American universities for the pur- 
pose of bringing home to their own countries the 
ways of the western world. Everywhere in Asia 
more humane customs are supplanting the effete

| and barbarous policies of by-gone eras. In fact, 
the entire continent is pervaded with a spirit of un- 
rest, which aims at the attainment of loftier ideals 
and the living of better lives by the people. 
Consideration of these things is the material which 
should oceupy the attention of the modern teacher 
of geography. 
Therefore it follows that one of the best problems 
which could be devised is, Why is so little known 
about Asia, the largest continent on the globe? Is 
it as important to the world’s work as Europe or 
America? Why? 
When this problem is set up, the pupils, in order to 
solve it, must concern themselves with finding out 
about the different countries on this enormous con- 
tinent. Why has China developed so slowly? In 
what respects does Japan differ from China? Does 
Japan want to control China? Why? Why is 
Japan the only Asiatic country which is considered 
a world power? What evidences are there of prog- 
ress in the Far East? 
Considerable interest will, undoubtedly, be shown 
in learning of the modes of dress, the kinds of homes, 
and the peculiar customs of these Asiatic peoples. 
In this process, attention will necessarily be directed 
to the geographical conditions of the countries: 
transportation and industries, rivers, harbors, cli- 
mate, soil, surface, and many other factors, all of 
which must be brought to bear in consideration of the 
problem, Why do so many people live in southeast. 
ern Asia? 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 191 
In southern Asia, India occupies the chief interest. 
Why is this country so densely populated? What 
are the chief cities and how important are they? 
What has India done for Great Britain? What has 
Great Britain done for India? 
When the center of interest shifts to southwestern 
Asia, an imaginary trip could be taken to the Holy 
Land, which method employs excellent books and 
pictures. What a tourist would find of interest in 
Arabia can also be taught pictorially by this method. 
The oppression of the Armenians and our interest 
in them, the Syrians, and the people of Palestine are 
subjects which offer pupils opportunity to suggest 
problems. In Asia Minor, Smyrna is of considerable 
importance. To find out why and how Greece will 
profit by receiving it as a possession, forms an inter- 
esting problem. 
Many teachers find it profitable to select topics 
from geographical studies and assign these for writ- 
ten composition. Many interesting ones can be 
found. From the study of Asia, the following might 
be used for this purpose: The importance of tea 
culture in India; What the silk industry means to 
China; Interesting customs of the Chinese; Chinese 
schools; The most interesting thing about the Jap- 
anese; The most important Japanese industries; What 
the Japanese make from bamboo; The Holy Land of 
to-day. 
Siberia.—Because of recent political changes in 
Russia, Siberia has received considerable popular 
attention; consequently, illuminating descriptions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-220

192 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
the country’s geographical importance and indus- 
trial and commercial possibilities are to be found. 
One reads of interest of Vladivostok, a combination 
of Gotham and Chicago, of Omsk, Ekaterinburg, 
Chita, Irkutsk, Harbin, Nikolsk; of her rich agri- 
cultural potentialities, of the alluring opportunities 
of the country in gold, silver, and the precious 
stones; and of the character of the people. In this 
way one is emancipated from old geographical text- 
book descriptions of Siberia as simply a cold, barren 
land, filled with prisons, exiles, deep snow and 
wolves. 
It is perfectly natural to study Siberia in compari- 
son with Canada. One wonders if Siberia can be- 
come as important as Canada. In the study trans- 
portation facilities can be contrasted. Has Siberia 
good facilities for transportation? Here the Trans- 
Siberian Railway as a factor in Siberia’s development 
can be an object of inquiry. The difficulties of 
transportation on the St. Lawrence and opportuni- 
ties for transportation on the other rivers of Canada 
can be compared with the great rivers of Siberia 
which are used as highways of travel in summer and 
winter. 
In the race for the development of resources, are 
the geographical conditions of Canada more favor- 
able? When the geographical conditions of the two 
countries are compared, not only do the industries 
assume form for comment and investigation, but the 
respective advantages of location and opportunities 
for exploitation appear. When the number, im-
-P-A-G-E-221
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 193 
portance, and beauty of the cities are contrasted; 
when the governments are considered and the differ- 
ence between the inhabitants is noted, the relative pro- 
gressiveness of the people can be deliberated upon. 
Finally, the part that Siberia played in the Russo- 
Japanese War and that of Canada in the World War 
will lend color to the comparison.

The Continent of Africa——The continent of Africa 
is of vital interest to Europe because practically the 
entire continent has been divided among European 
powers, thus furnishing colonies as an outlet for their 
large numbers at home, as a market for their manu- 
factured products, and as a source of raw materials. 
Great Britain, Belgium, France, Italy, and Portugal 
have divided Africa among themselves, Germany hay- 
ing lost her possessions since the World War. If 
these nations succeed in training the African negro 
to work and produce many articles of trade which

are needed in Europe, then enormous Lica will 
result to the mutual benefit of both Africans and 
Europeans and eventually to the development of 
Africa as a very important factor in the life of the 
world. In this event, the continent will be of great 
importance for geographical study, since the eyes of 
the civilized world will again be turned to Africa just 
as, centuries ago, there was intense interest mani- 
fested in northern Africa where one of the most an- 
cient of civilizations existed and where the Pharaohs 
of old entered the life of Old Testament history. 
In studying the continent of Africa at the present 
time, attention must necessarily be directed to its 
partition among European nations and its govern- 
ment by European powers. On the other hand, the 
study of Europe involves consideration of a conti- 
nent made up of both large and small countries, prac- 
tically all of which are now independent nations; the 
study of the Western Hemisphere embraces countries 
all of which are republics except Canada, which en- 
joys the same privileges as if it were one; and while 
the study of Asia directs attention to certain coun- 
tries controlled by European nations, nevertheless 
the most important, like Japan and China, determine 
their own government. 
In the case of other continents and countries, the 
independent countries could, most advantageously, 
be studied first; and then each country could be 
studied in relation to the continent as a whole. How- 
ever, in the case of Africa the entire continent can 
best be studied first.
-P-A-G-E-223
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 195 
The suggestions of method which follow, indicate 
how the continent of Africa may be studied. 
First, set up the main problem: What geographic 
conditions of a continent are conducive to trade and 
intercourse between nations on other continents? 
In the answer to this, bring out the significance of 
location and surface, rivers, climate, and people. 
Ideal geographic surroundings, it will be recalled, 
include abundant food resources, prosperous farm- 
ers, a stimulating climate, easy transportation, and 
opportunities for recreation. 
In this study, be sure to consider: Why did the 
Europeans settle in the southern part of Africa? 
How is Africa divided among European nations?” If, 
in consideration of this question, the teacher has 
practically all of the reading matter and the pupils 
have little, projects could be assigned in the pursuit 
of which the pupils could indicate on an outline map 
the territorial changes and make notes of the prin- 
cipal points brought out in the teacher’s readings and 
explanations. 
Why is Cairo a great city? Why is Egypt so 
productive? Why is Africa of interest to tourists? 
Can Africa now be called the “dark continent”? 
What great names are associated with the story of 
Africa? What are the famous railways in Africa? 
What have European nations done to improve con- 
ditions in Africa? Why have they done these things? 
What is known as the ‘‘American penetration” into 
Africa, and when did it occur? These and dozens

of other problems could be presented. _ Numerous 
projects can be selected. Among these, a topical 
outline of Africa could be recorded, and the signif- 
icant features (location, surface, rivers, climate, 
people) could be indicated; cotton and gold charts 
could be constructed; and a product map could be 
made.

Australia and Islands of the Pacific.—The follow- 
ing problems are indicative of the procedure which 
may be employed in a study of Australia and the 
Islands of the Pacific. The main problem is, Aus- 
tralia, Argentina, and Canada may be said to culti- 
vate the soil and raise the crops of the world: What 
is Australia’s share in the work? What is New 
Zealand’s? Other Islands’ of the Pacific? 
The minor problems are, How does Australia aid 
England? (Consider government, World War, etc.  
-P-A-G-E-225
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 197 
It will be remembered that Australia and New Zea- 
land attracted much attention during the World War 
because of the bravery displayed by their soldiers). 
Why has Australia attracted settlers? Australia 
has broad plains suited for grazing and pastures. 
Compare these in productivity, with similar parts in 
other countries. How are Australian goods mar- 
keted? Is Australia a young continent? What are 
the possibilities for growth and usefulness? New 
Zealand is called the “Newest England.” Why? 
What is the value of the smaller islands of the Pacific 
to the nations which control them?

9. The continent of South America and a com- 
plete problem about Brazil— The continent of South 
America.—No one who is informed, doubts the in- 
creasing importance of knowledge about South Amer- 
ica and South American countries. The United 
States and the world at large are becoming more and 
more dependent upon these countries for the neces- 
sities of life. In a study of the countries of Europe 
our attention is directed to a high state of civilized 
society, and our geographical interest is chiefly cen- 
tred upon it as a means of appreciation of what 
European people have contributed and are contribut-

ing to the world’s needs.. In America we are inter- 
ested in our reciprocal relations with Europe. 
South America is playing an increasingly impor- 
tant part in this respect; and we are beginning to ap- 
preciate the fact that we in America are more de- 
pendent upon South America than South America is 
upon us. In the light of solving the questions which 
this statement naturally presents, the study of the 
countries of South America can be made distinctly 
advantageous and illuminating. 
Shifting values—(See pp. 32-34). The rise in 
importance of South America is illustrative of shift- 
ing values in geography. At a glance, one sees that 
the material contained in school geographies about 
South America needs to be revised; up-to-date 
material needs to be secured.“ In general, problems 
should be selected in accordance with the amount and 
kind of reading material which can be obtained. 
These problems which are suggested here do not re- 
quire a large variety of reference material for their 
solution. 
The main problem recommended for the study of 
the continent of South America is, Are we more de- 
pendent upon South America than South America 
is upon us? The minor problems which follow are 
suggestive of the kinds which would be serviceable 
in the study. Does South America supply the

Is the United States more important to South Amer-

What are the interesting things in South America? 
Why would a trip to a coffee plantation be interest-

South America—Buenos Aires. How does the Pan- 
ama Canal aid South America? Show why Argen- 
tina, Canada, and Australia are the “farmers of the

In the study of each country, there will be found 
little difficulty, because of data which can easily be 
procured, in constructing problems which offer fields 
for advantageous study.            REFERENCES

A complete problem about Brazil—The problem 
about Brazil which follows can be given in five lessons 
of forty minutes each. Full directions as to proced- 
ure, content, and problem development are con- 
tained in the instructions which follow. 
The main problem is, Why can Brazil be called the 
young giant of the Western Hemisphere? Prepara- 
tion for the solution of this problem should consist of 
specific reading and preparation by the teacher and 
the selection of references and material for the 
pupils. 
The problem is selected and reference material is 
provided not only to supplement the textbook, but 
also to provide motivation. Instead of following the 
textbook matter about Brazil, see that certain pupils 
read sections of the data that have been provided. 
Particularly significant selections, which the teacher 
desires to present to the class, can be written on the 
blackboard. 
“For the references relating to this problem see above.

ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 201 
Besides dividing the class into groups, correlate the 
reading period with that of geography, or use the 
time ordinarily devoted to the subject of reading to 
the exercise of reading for information relative to 
the solution of the main problem. This not only 
affords more time, but it also gives motivation to the 
reading. 
Make constant use of the blackboard. 
Distribute the outline maps of South America and 
of the world. As the work develops, have the impor- 
tant products, places, and commercial routes filled in. 
Provide for review of important facts and the min- 
imum essentials of place geography. 
A brief history of Brazil may be had in the pamph- 
let of the Pan American Union, Brazil, pp. 4-12. If 
the teacher prefers, a short history could be prepared, 
mimeographed, and distributed to the class. 
Next in order, comes the teacher’s presentation. 
As civilization advances and population becomes 
more dense, the inhabitants of the temperate zones 
become necessarily more dependent upon the tropics 
for foodstuffs. Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, Literary 
Editor of the Independent, says: “No nation can call 
itself independent unless it has command of the 
seven C’s: coffee, cacao, copra, cotton, cane, and 
caoutchouc.”!® (Dr. Slosson credits ‘“‘caoutchouc”’ 
with two C’s.) 
Why does the United States need the “seven 
C’s”? The United States uses much more coffee

than any other country of the world and none is 
grown in the United States. Chocolate is made 
from cacao. We use large amounts of chocolate in 
many different ways. It is very nutritious. Coprais 
the dried meat of cocoanuts. From this there is 
obtained an oil which is changed into a solid, white, 
and wholesome fat used in margarine and other sub- 
stitutes for butter and lard in cooking and table use. 
Nations must use substitutes of vegetable fats and 
oils for those of animals, in part or in whole, for rea- 
sons of both economy and health. For instance, it 
takes 100 pounds of food fed to hogs to produce only 
11 pounds of hog meat. 
Our sugar supply is less than half of what we need. 
Of cotton we have plenty, for we produce 60 per cent. 
of the world’s supply. Caoutchouc, the last two“‘C’s,” 
or rubber, is obtained from the rubber tree. We use 
more than one half of the world’s supply and pro- 
duce very little. Rubber is most essential to the 
automobile industry, in which we excel, since we 
make 85 per cent. of the world’s automobiles. 
Are all nations dependent upon the “seven C’s’’? 
Is France? Italy? Germany? Compare their need 
of the “seven C’s” with those of the United States. 
To what extent does this young giant, Brazil, help 
us in obtaining the “seven C’s”? 
After this presentation, other suggestions of method 
are necessary before the class sets to work on the 
problem.

in the reading should be presented on the blackboard 
and provision made for pronunciation of them so as to 
guarantee smooth and fluent reading. 
Make divisions of the class into, say, eight groups 
for a study of the material advised in the next part 
of the problem. These eight groups, in supervised 
study, would read from the reference material (and 
from the textbook) about (1) size and surface, (2) 
Rio de Janeiro and other cities, (3) rivers, (4) cli- 
mate and vegetation, (5) agriculture, (6) minerals, 
(7) manufactures, and (8) the people, respectively. 
Each group is to be held responsible for its assign- 
ment. Limit the time for reading to, say, one half 
an hour. 
Distribute copies of a brief history of Brazil. (See 
p. 201). Have all the pupils read this. Then distri- 
bute the reference books. 
Be sure that note books are handy and that pen- 
cils are sharpened, ready for use. 
Summarize, in class recitation, the results of the 
reading during the supervised study period. Pupils 
are to record the necessary data, under the teacher’s 
direction, according to the sections of the outline 
which follow in the next part of the problem. 
Supplementary information is to be given the 
pupils by the teacher. The oral reading suggested 
in this outline is based mainly upon Bryce’s “South 
America.” 
The class, during the reading referred to above, 
should be given the problem, In what respects is 
Brazil a young giant? Let it be assumed that the

following is the result of the investigations of the class 
plus the information supplied by the teacher, and the 
class is ready to record the data. 
Size—Brazil is very large and richly endowed. 
In length from north to south it is 2,660 miles; in 
width, 2,700 miles. Its area, 3,301,350 square miles, 
is greater than that of the United States. The 
Atlantic coast line is 4,000 miles in length. The 
north coast is but little broken, but on the south 
coast good harbors are not wanting. (Read from 
Bryce’s “South America,” pp. 367-370; 404). 
Rio de Janeiro (River of January) is the thirteenth 
city in size in the world and hence among the world’s 
largest cities. (Read from Bryce’s “South America,” 
pp. 378-383; 415). 
Rivers —The rivers of Brazil possess a degree of 
importance greater than most other rivers of the 
world, since they are the chief, and in some cases, 
the only highways of travel and commerce through 
a region of great natural resources. Because of the 
copious rainfall and the mild climate, navigation of 
most of them is possible throughout the year. 
More than two thirds of Brazil is drained by the 
Amazon and Tocantins rivers, and about one fourth 
by the Paraguay-Paran&é system, while the re- 
mainder is drained by the Sao Francisco and smaller 
streams. 
Climate-—Brazil is situated in a climate which 
makes possible a varied vegetation. In the greater 
part of the country, the climate is remarkably con- 
stant, with a fairly uniform temperature and wilh
-P-A-G-E-233

heavy rainfall. (Read from Bryce’s ‘South Amer- 
ica,” p. 384). In the great Amazon Valley, low and 
moist, densely forested, and subjected at all times 
to the sweep of the trades, the thermometer stands 
around ninety degrees. Most of the rain falls be- 
tween January and June. (Read Bryce’s “South 
America,” pp. 405-406.) 
Vegetation and Agriculture —Brazil possesses many 
useful products. The vegetation is luxurious along 
the coast and especially in the lowlands of the Ama- 
zon. There are mangoes, cacao, dwarf palms, and 
Brazilwood. Most of the Amazon basin is a vast 
forest, stretching from the foot of the Andes to the 
sea. Here are found a great variety of palms and 
hardwood trees which surround many rubber trees. 
Pineapples, figs, bananas, guavas, grapes, and 
oranges are indigenous. European grapes, olives, 
and watermelons are grown. 
On the southeast coast, within the tropics, rainfall 
is abundant, too, and the vegetation is profuse. 
Southward, in the temperate climate, the vegeta- 
tion is like that of our own Southern States. (Place 
some of the names of the products mentioned above 
on the desk outline maps that have been provided.) 
Minerals.—Brazil is one of the richest mineral- 
bearing countries in the world. The scarcity of 
population as well as of capital, and restrictive legisla- 
tion tend to retard the development of these re- 
sources. (Compare the state of Minas Geraes with 
California or Pennsylvania). Lack of fuel and suf- 
ficient skilled labor prohibit the extensive manu-

facture of iron, lead, copper, zinc, and manganese. 
The coal found in Brazil is of inferior quality. 
Marble and building stones abound. 
Manufactures—While agriculture is the leading 
occupation in Brazil, manufactures are increasing in 
importance. These are taking a natural course of 
development; that is, those industries are making 
most progress which depend upon the native agri- 
cultural and mineral products of the country. For 
instance, the textile industry is important. Some 
woolen mills are situated at Rio de Janeiro, Minas 
Geraes, and Sao Paulo. Sugar refining goes on at 
Bahia and Pernambuco. Cigar making is import- 
ant. Many’ other miscellaneous commodities are 
marketed as a result of smelting metals, assem- 
bling steam engines, tanning leather and working 
hides, manufacturing salt, straw hats, soap and 
candles, paper, calicoes, powder and dynamite, 
glass, and cotton-seed oil. 
Summary.—Hence it can be said that, although 
essentially a tropical land, with heavy rainfall, high 
temperatures, and with vast forests over its equa- 
torial portion, a large part of Brazil is an open 
country of elevated, rolling campos, with trees scat- 
tered about, suited to agriculture in the main, hav- 
ing many rivers, and with an agricultural, a grazing, 
and a mining future of great promise. 
The major portion of the activities of the class is to 
be devoted to map study to determine how many of 
the “seven C’s” one would find in Brazil. 
Before this is undertaken, certain instructions are

necessary. Distribute to each member of the class 
one outline map of South America and one outline 
map of the world. The class as a whole, and not in 
groups, should be ready to follow the teacher in 
locating each one of the “seven C’s.” On the outline 
maps which have been provided, the “seven C’s” 
should be placed. The proper notes should be re- 
corded. 
In response to the question, How many of the 
“seven C’s,” from our study of the map, have been 
found in Brazil? the following facts and questions 
should be recorded. 
Cotton is found in Brazil. It is of excellent qual- 
ity. What conditions are conducive to cotton pro- 
duction? 
In 1890, Brazil raised and shipped 4,600,000 bags 
of coffee. In 1900, 11,000,000 bags were shipped. 
This was increased to 12,000,000 in 1912. This over- 
production caused low prices; so low, that the govern- 
ment, realizing that the prosperity of Brazil, in the 
main, was dependent upon the income obtained from 
coffee, tried to put a stop to this overproduction. They 
did this (1) by taxing the overproduction of coffee - 
intended for export; (2) by purchasing large quantities 
from the planters and destroying this coffee; and (3) 
by propaganda (advertising in the newspapers of the 
world) to create greater demand for coffee. 
Coffee is produced in large quantities in Brazil, and 
especially in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas 
Geraes and Sao Paulo. Read selections from 
Bryce’s “South America,” pp. 387-388.  
-P-A-G-E-236
    
208 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Cocoanut trees are grown successfully. 
Sugar-cane grows in the Atlantic states of Brazil, 
especially in Bahia and Pernambuco. 
In northeast Brazil, cacao is found. 
Caoutchouc trees are found in great numbers, 
scattered among other trees in the forests of the 
Amazon. Grain, cattle, and horses are found in the 
southern states, especially Rio Grande do Sul. 
But these products are not all that are found in 
Brazil, for rice, bananas, and vegetables of many 
kinds grow there. 
The next part of the problem is a class activity, 
and the commercial map of the world should be used 
for this part of the study. Some statistical informa- 
tion will, of necessity, have to be provided. This, 
as well as the minimum essentials of place geography, 
should be recorded in the note books. 
How does the young giant hope to grow? Growth 
is assisted by improvement of facilities of trans- 
portation and communication. In 1912, Brazil had 
14,338 miles of railroads. In the United States 
there are 266,000 miles, or 40 per cent. of the world’s 
railroads. In Europe, there are 215,000 miles of 
railroads. But the rivers of Brazil, which are nat- 
ural highways, help to make up for the lack of rail- 
road mileage. 
Ports are essential to the commercial expansion of 
countries, and extension of commerce will help Brazil 
to grow. Rio de Janeiro, the New York of Brazil, 
gets two fifths of Brazil’s imports and ships one sixth 
of its products. Bahia, Pernambuco, and Parahyba

in the north, Santos, Paranagua, Desterro, Porto 
Alegre, and Rio Grande do Sul in the south, are the 
other principal cities. 
Manufacturing enterprises are usually centered 
in cities. In addition to those mentioned above, Sao 
Paulo is a manufacturing center, a description of 
which may be found in bulletins of the Pan 
American Union and in Bryce’s “South America,” 
p. 374. 
From the bulletins of the Pan American Union, 
much data about Brazil’s commerce can be obtained. 
Although Brazil’s commerce is greater than that of 
any other South American republic, this can be ex- 
tended because the possibilities of exports are large. 
For instance, coffee, which means more to Brazil’s 
prosperity than wheat or cotton means to the United 
States, is an article of commerce increasing in de- 
mand. The United States alone takes two thirds of 
the rubber supply of Brazil. In addition to these 
products, Brazil can extend her exportation of 
cotton, sugar, cacao, tobacco, Paraguay tea, Brazil- 
wood, cabinet woods, and hides. By means of the 
Panama Canal, all of the western coast of both North 
and South America has become more accessible, and 
Brazil should profit by the volume of trade afforded 
by the canal. 
The people who inhabit this extensive country, and 
to whom this possibility of development is offered, 
are of a different combination than the people of any 
other country in the world. The 25,000,000 people 
of Brazil are divided about as follows: one half are

white, one third are half-breeds, one seventh are 
negroes, and one tenth are savages.”® 
The minimum essentials of place geography should 
include the location of three ports of the Atlantic 
Coast; the naming of three large rivers of Brazil 
and their importance; the description of the surface 
of the country; and the location and importance of 
the principal cities. 
to. A study of the United States by both topics and 
problems.—In section four, an elementary study of 
the United States (designed for younger pupils than 
the present study contemplates), which followed a like 
study of the sections of the country, was suggested. 
After this came the study of other continents and 
countries of the world. It should follow that this 
rather extensive work should be attended by growth 
in ability to study and in fluent reading. A more 
serious study of the United States should be presented 
to students when they have arrived at the point when 
they can appreciate, in much greater degree than 
before, the significance of our country in the world’s 
affairs. It remains, then, to acquaint more mature 
pupils, who are better equipped in the art of study- 
ing, with a brief but thorough presentation of their 
country’s strength, resources, and ability. 
In previous studies, the pupils have secured some 
knowledge of the development of the several sections 
of the United States, because they have studied about

the location, surface, climate, etc., which have 
affected this development. Miss Lydia R. Blaich tells 
how these things have contributed to the industrial 
development of the United States.” 
With desk outline maps ready to be filled in with 
the names of products which are found in America, 
a number of investigations should be pursued. From 
a list of products of the United States, it must be 
determined where each product is found in greatest 
abundance or the important areas of the principal 
products; how these products reach the people who 
use them; what articles are manufactured from the 
principal raw products; and the cities and districts 
which are developed by these activities. In the pro- 
cess of classification of these products, the surface, 
climate, and other geographical factors must be taken 
into consideration, in order that intelligent location 
of them may follow. For instance, large areas of 
wheat would not likely be found upon mountains, 
nor timber on plains. 
When the products of the United States which are 
agricultural have been classified and properly filled in 
on the outline maps, graphical illustrations of the 
proportion of each product contributed by the United 
States to the world’s supply should find a ready place 
in the method of teaching. For instance, three 
fourths of the world’s supply of corn is grown in 
America, one fourth of its wheat, and 60 per cent. of 
its cotton. The United States has a greater variety

and abundance of fruits than any other country in 
the world. Vegetables and fruits are raised not only 
for domestic consumption, but also for exportation 
in the form of canned goods.48 In mineral products, 
this graphical illustration is particularly illumina- 
ting, for our country supplies the world with 52 per 
cent. of its coal, 66 per cent. of its petroleum and oil, 
40 per cent. of its iron, 60 per cent. of its copper, 25 
per cent. of its gold, 40 per cent. of its silver, 40 per 
cent. of its lead, 50 per cent. of its zinc, 60 per cent. 
of its aluminum, and much of its salt. But, enormous 
and important as this wealth is to the United States, 
many authorities assert that the prosperity and 
success of the country depend primarily upon agri- 
culture. To understand the productivity and possi- 
bilities of the country as a whole in this respect, the 
fundamental factors in agricultural development 
should receive great emphasis in this study: pro- 
ductive areas, areas made productive and how, phys- 
ical factors affecting production, the people who till 
the soil and other related factors concerned with the 
land and the people.!

Stimulation of the activities of the class by raising 
problems should not be neglected. Interesting recita- 
tions result from a problem like, What is the world’s 
most important agricultural product? or, What is 
the world’s most important mineral? 
Let the latter receive consideration for a moment. 
What should be the result of setting up such a prob- 
lem? The values of various minerals will be dis- 
cussed, and authorities quoted and statistics given. 
If the argument is conducted wisely, by the time the 
class has made its decision, only the organization of 
the contributions of the pupils will be left tothe 
teacher. It might, however, be well to secure a 
collection of minerals (in your locality, if there are 
any), and find out the names of each. These should 
be labelled and arranged. By all means have ready 
specimens of different kinds of coal. What a story 
any one of these could tell!

To illustrate further the possibilities of a study of 
this kind, consider the problem, What is the world’s 
most useful metal? After determining the answer, 
the class has for consideration a type study of iron. 
Minnesota produces the most iron. Pennsylvania 
manufactures the most iron goods. The formation 
of iron, how it is obtained from the earth, appearance, 
smelting, what is cast-iron and what is steel are all 
interesting topics. A lesson by J. Russell Smith, 
Professor of Industry, Wharton School of Finance 
and Commerce, University of Pennsylvania, aims tc

of them have added many problems which form 
puzzling questions of government. What are some 
of them? Consider the cities of your home state 
in relation to the cities of the United States. How 
many does your state possess? Should it have more? 
Less? Why? How does a great city manage’ to 
secure food? 
Commercial routes of trade necessarily form an 
important part of this treatment. (A full study 
of the foreign trade of the United States is suggested 
in Section 11, pp. 218-227). Hence, it is necessary to 
study, along with the products, the markets which 
are reached by these products. Both railways and 
waterways need incidental as well as specific treat- 
ment.”4

most familiar to those who are accustomed to scien- 
tific method. These can be readily applied to this 
study. 
The minimum essentials of place geography should 
not be neglected. A ready description of the sur- 
face features of the United States should be in pos- 
session of every pupil. It should be easy to tell the 
salient facts about the principal mountain ranges, 
the highest mountain peaks, certain principal cities, 
certain important rivers, etc., as well as to give names 
and location. The pupils should also be able to 
appreciate the values of the largest rivers, to trace the 
principal routes of trade, to place accurately the 
important cities; and, above all, to locate with pre- 
cision, because they understand the underlying 
factors of production, the areas occupied by the 
chief natural resources of the United States. 
Proper methods of study having been pursued, 
accurate and sufficient details having been presented, 
many questions and problems which have not been 
anticipated will undoubtedly be produced by the 
pupils themselves. Among these, the following 
might be suggested: With a list of our principal 
natural resources, compare a list of products which 
are necessary to our everyday life. How many do we 
produce? What are the sources of those which we 
do not produce? What are the important articles 
“made in the U.S. A.,” which you think should be 
advertised to the world? How many are well ad- 
vertised? New Orleans ranks second in foreign 
trade. Explain this. Why is Chicago the largest

dustry. How has the possession of Alaska proved 
_ profitable to the United States? Why is Los Ange- 
les the fruit port of the Pacific? Why does such 
interest center around the Chesapeake Bay? 
1x. A study of the foreign trade of the United 
States.—The foreign trade of the United States is a 
subject of importance and forms a large part of the 
deliberations of important bodies of business men. 
The study is also important for geographical consid- 
eration, because it involves the study of the exchange 
of products between the United States and other 
countries of the world and hence, of the relative im- 
portance of the United States and other countries as 
producers of commodities for world consumption. 
It is therefore necessary, in order that this study 
may be successful, to supply for the use of the class 
physical and political maps of Europe, Africa, South 
America, Asia, and the World. Maps of commerce 
and trade should also be at the disposal of the pupils. 
The use of a large globe is advantageous. Reference 
books, including a number of different school geog- 
raphy textbooks, geographical readers, some good 
commercial and industrial geographies and readers 
on industry and commerce, the World Almanac and 
Encyclopedia, etc., and other material from which 
statistical information can be obtained, (See Ap- 
pendix B), should be generously applied. Current

magazines and newspapers with articles which relate 
to the subject, should also be provided. 
For projects, desk outline maps of the United 
States, Asia, Africa, South America, and the World 
might also be used. Assembling and classifying in- 
formation relating to the several topics which follow, 
also offer opportunity for doing effective work. 
Our trade in the Western Hemisphere —Not only do 
trade relations exist between Canada, South America, 
and the United States, but the West Indies, Mexico, 
and Central America exchange commodities with the 
United States. To these latter places, agricultural 
and mining machinery, textiles and clothing, focd- 
stuffs and drugs are exported. The important ex- 
ports of these countries to the United States, as well 
as the chief ports for shipment and the trade routes, 
should be ascertained.* 
The following problems will help the pupils in the 
study of the trade relations of the United States with 
the West Indies, Mexico, and Central America: 
Why was the purchase of the Danish West Indies 
important to the United States? (Geographical 
Review, November, 1917, pp. 359-373). Why is 
Cuba the ‘Pearl of the Antilles’? (National Geo- 
graphic Magazine, October, 1906, p. 535.) What 
conditions are needed to make Mexico a progressive 
country? Why have not the Central American 
countries been more prominent in world affairs? 
How is the Panama Canal important to world trade?   
In this connection, pamphlets of the Pan American Union, Wash- 
ington, D. C., will be serviceable.

How are we dependent upon countries of the Carib- 
bean Sea? 
Canadian products are used in the United States, 
and America supplies Canada with many articles. 
How much trade do we carry on with Canada? To 
what degree is Canada dependent upon the United 
States for supplying her needs? 
Our trade with South America.—Does South Amer- 
ica need our commercial products more than we need 
those of South America? To this main problem, add 
the following minor problems: What does South 
America produce without which we could not thrive? 
Could South America produce or get elsewhere every- 
thing we want to sell her? Is the United States 
more important to South America, commercially and 
industrially, than to Europe? Are the character and 
extent of our trade with South American countries 
appreciated by the people of America? To what 
extent are articles “made in the U. S. A.” used in 
South American countries? Will Argentina ever be 
to South America what the United States is to North 
America? Do you expect South America to grow? 
Why? What is Latin America? Develop the re- 
ciprocal service of Chile in sending nitrate to us and 
getting foodstuffs from us. What is the influence of 
the Monroe Doctrine? What has been the influence 
of the A. B. C. conferences? ?”

South America for trade with the United States and 
European countries, harbors, winds, and ocean cur- 
rents which affect commerce, should be brought out. 
The commercial grouping of South American 
States which is generally accepted is based upon the 
surface features and climate of the continent: (1) 
the Andean countries—Chili, Peru, Bolivia, Colom- 
bia, and Ecuador; (2) the tropical countries— 
Brazil, Venezuela, Guiana, and Paraguay; and (3) 
the temperate countries—Argentine and Uruguay. 
It has well been said that the world is no longer a 
place where any race of men can live in isolated exis- 
tence and still rank in the forefront of civilized 
peoples. The races of people—Red, European, and 
Black—in South America and their consequent needs, 
whether civilized or savage, are important because 
upon this distribution depend not only how great 
the demand for goods will be, but also the extent of 
prosperity and hence the ability to purchase goods. 
The leading exports of South American countries 
must necessarily receive consideration: (1) min- 
eral products—silver, copper, tin, nitrates, and 
emerald; (2) animal products; and (3) agricultural 
and forest products—sugar, coffee, wheat, cacao, 
ivory, nuts, rubber, dye woods, quebracho, and 
cabinet woods. Not only the leading exports, but 
also the sources, ports of shipment, and ocean routes 
must necessarily receive attention. 
How many things South America needs, and how 
various they are, can be seen from the following list, 
which is by no means exhaustive: railway supplies,

  agricultural machinery, manufactured textiles, hard- 
ware and ships’ stores, flour, coal, petroleum prod- 
ucts, soft woods, industrial machinery for power 
and lights, foodstuffs, fish, dynamite and powder for 
blasting, musical instruments, labor-saving devices, 
and the machete. 
Our trade with Europe-—Transportation and com- 
munication across oceans are now so general that 
all modern nations are closely related. When the 
population of one country suffers from pestilence 
caused by the lack of food and the loss of vitality, 
this crosses into other lands and disease is spread 
broadcast. In like manner, when financial or in- 
dustrial disaster occurs in one nation, all others are 
likely to suffer. 
One naturally expects the eastern coast of the 
United States, because of its many advantages, to 
carry on an enormous amount of foreign trade. 
As a matter of fact, practically 85 per cent. of our 
foreign trade is maintained by the Atlantic Coast in 
connection with transatlantic countries. 
What conditions have led to the great volume of 
trade between European countries and the United 
States? Before this situation can be discussed in- 
telligently, it is necessary that several matters re- 
lating to the subject be reviewed. 
In the first place, the comparative nearness of 
European ports to our great Atlantic seaboard has 
helped to encourage trade relations. To locate New

Naples, and Marseilles, and the approximate trans- 
atlantic distances will assist in impressing this fact. 
The facts established by a comparison of the size 
and population of Europe with the United States and 
by consideration of the climate and the topographic 
conditions of the two; the need of foodstuffs by the 
dense population of Europe, the central plains of 
America forming “the granary of the world’; the 
existence of that great subtropical fruit belt in south- 
ern Europe, and dozens of other facts, reveal the 
necessity for trade relations between Europe and 
America. When to these are added studies about the 
industries—the raw materials and manufacturing 
interests of Great Britain, France, Russia, the United 
States and other countries—and knowledge of Euro- 
pean immigration to the United States, they but 
emphasize the conviction that the reciprocal needs 
of the United States and European countries must 
continue to be supplied by the interchange of com- 
modities. 
In order to gain adequate information of the condi- 
tions under which trade is carried on, the necessity 
of finding out the chief products which are exchanged 
between the United States and European countries, 
as a result of the above conditions, is obvious. In 
locating the sources, shipping ports, and distributing 
centers of products in the United States and in 
Europe, export and import trade receives considera- 
tion. In similar fashion, one must become ac- 
quainted with the leading steamship lines and the 
trade routes followed.  
-P-A-G-E-252
224 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The study of our commerce with Europe, then, 
involves consideration of (1) the comparative near- 
ness of European ports to our great Atlantic sea- 
board; (2) comparison of size and population; (3) 
climatic and topographic conditions; (4) industries; 
and, (5) the chief products exchanged between the 
United States and European countries. 
Our trade with Asiatic countries —The continent of 
Asia, containing two thirds of the earth’s population, 
and land which is enormously rich in untapped na- 
tural resources, is undoubtedly the greatest potential 
producing and consuming land in the world. Our 
present trade with Asia and Oceanica amounts to 
more than two billion dollars annually, and yet we 
command but a small part of Asia’s trade. Since 
there is a growing demand for American-made 
machinery and other American products in Asia, 
especially among the four hundred million people of 
China, it is predicted that the trade between the 
United States and the Orient will rapidly increase. 
Japan, the most progressive of Asiatic countries, 
is yearly rising to a greater degree of prominence in 
securing Chinese trade. On account of this com- 
petition, in addition to the desire to increase our trade 
with the Orient, a large part of the merchant marine 
of the United States will undoubtedly be placed in 
the Pacific. 
The Pacific coast lies opposite Asia, and it is na- 
tural to assume that this section of the United 
States must, in the main, attend to this great business 
of Oriental trade. Favored with a number of great,
-P-A-G-E-253
  ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 225 
natural harbors, possessing extremely productive 
soil, blessed with mineral wealth, backed by a hinter- 
land of increasing fertility and managed by intelli- 
gent farmers, capable of receiving thousands of 
products via the Panama Canal, and with many 
other advantages, the Pacific coast looks out to- 
ward the richest potential agricultural and mineral- 
producing regions of the world—the vast Orient. 
The Trans-Siberian Railway opens up in Siberia, 
China, and Manchuria the possibilities of a greater 
wheat-producing area than lies in the Pacific coast 
hinterland. Butter, beef, hides, beans, and many 
other products have been continually transported by 
this railroad. 
So it is that, in all probability, the eastern and 
older coast of the United States will gaze in amaze- 
ment, and at the same time with pride, at the growth 
in trade of the newer, western coast. 
The United States Department of Agriculture, in 
a report on peanut trade, said, ““The nominal quota- 
tions on September 10 (1920) were from six to nine 
cents per pound, but there was no demand. The 
department has peanuts of its own in storage at 
Florence, S. C., which it would like to sell, but cannot. 
The market is swamped with Oriental peanuts at the 
ports. Only this morning there were sent to us from 
the Department of Commerce, samples of Oriental 
peanuts which show conclusively that the Orientals 
have sent to this country and got our best seed. The 
industry is ruined unless there is prohibition of im- 
ports or the imposition of a heavy tariff, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  
226 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
eighteen years of work done by this department will 
have been thrown away.” What would be the 
effect of a tariff protecting the peanut industry of this 
country? 
The Japanese are particularly active in trading in 
peanuts, and this illustration serves to acquaint one 
with the growing importance of Japan in world trade. 
Considerable popular interest has been aroused in 
Japanese activities in bringing the question of racial 
equality before the League of Nations as well by the 
fact that a stout fight against the Californian land 
laws has been carried to the United States Supreme 
Court by the Japanese. 
In a study of our trade relations with Japan, it 
would be well to consider the problems: Why is Japan 
a power in the Pacific? What effect has American 
influence upon Japan? and, What effect has Japanese 
influence upon America? Before these matters can 
be discussed intelligently, it is necessary to consider 
Japan’s position with regard to Asia, Europe, and 
North America, her harbors, her agricultural, min-' 
eral, and forest resources and her people, old and 
new. It goes without saying that one must deter- 
mine the products exchanged with the United States 
and the leading ports of commerce between the two 
countries.” 
In the study of our trade refations with China, the 
problems: Why has China not progressed as rapidly 
as Japan? and, What American interests are estab- 
lished in China? will call for study of the extent of

the country, its government, its people, and its re- 
sources—mineral, agricultural, forest, ete. To com- 
plete the study, it is necessary to determine the 
products which are exchanged between the United 
States and China and the leading ports involved in 
the trade. 
In the solution of the problem, Are the Philippines 
a valuable possession of the United States? be sure to 
consider the following: location, resources, races of 
people, Spanish occupation, intervention of the 
United States, imports, exports, and trade routes. 
There are many government publications which 
are available for the above studies. One can obtain 
a list of the bulletins of any and all bureaus of the 
government by writing to the Superintendent of 
Public Documents, Washington, D. C., for a monthly 
list of government publications. While the great 
majority of these documents are issued free, some of 
them must be purchased. For specific treatment 
of the above studies,’ the material issued by the 
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce should 
be secured. The State Department issues consular 
reports, which contain valuable and _ instructive 
articles about foreign industries and trade. Address 
a letter to that department and have your name 
placed on the mailing list.

12. A study of the British Empire by both topics 
and problems.—In the study of the British Empire, 
no attempt is made to present the details of the 
problem: Why is Great Britain a great industriz] na- 
tion and how does she maintain supremacy in com- 
merce? However, in the following brief outline cer- 
tain significant features are pointed out. 
The influences under which Great Britain has 
risen to a position of supreme importance in world 
trade should be recounted. The physical conditions, 
which are among these influences, include the loca- 
tion of Great Britain, the small area of the British 
Isles, and the climate—winds, rainfall, ocean cur- 
rents, altitudes, waters which border the country, etc. 
In connection with climate, let it be remembered that 
a nation’s supply of food may be seriously affected 
by climatic conditions or the ability of a section to 
engage successfully in the textile industry may be 
affected by lack of moisture in the atmosphere, but 
the output of a mineral, like coal, receives very little 
hindrance from storms, heat or cold, because the 
workers are below the surface affected by climatic 
conditions. The natural advantages or industrial 
conditions, also among these influences, embrace the 
presence of minerals, forests, water power, nearness 
to the sea (no place being more than 70 miles from 
the coast), and topographical conditions favorable
-P-A-G-E-257
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 229 
to the development of large industrial centers—Lon- 
don, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, etc. On the 
other hand, the disadvantages include lack of raw 
materials—foodstuffs, textiles, sufficient minerals 
(iron, nickel, copper), scattered sources of supplies 
of raw materials (very evident when one traces the 
sources of these supplies), lack of local oil fields, and 
a rather unfair system of property control—large, 
landed estates and unfair taxation. 
Great Britain has deliberately overcome some of 
the disadvantages mentioned above. Although lack- 
ing certain minerals, her world power has been built 
chiefly on production and trade in coal. And her 
power must continue to rest upon this basic industry. 
Oil might be considered the rival of coal until one 
knows that the world’s annual production of coal is 
about one and a half billion tons and only eighty- 
five million tons of petroleum. This would seem to 
indicate that petroleum is not likely to take the place 
of coal as the world’s principal source of light and 
heat. Hence, Great Britain’s principal sponsor in 
world commerce will continue to help her maintain 
her high position. 
Government conditions play a large part in forcing 
Great Britain to the top in industry and trade. Not 
only the form of government, but also the intelligent, 
industrious, and enterprising people who maintain 
this government, help to guarantee to Great Britain 
an important position in the industrial progress of the 
world, and help to maintain her in that position. 
The Britishers, through long training in commerce, 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  230 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
have learned how to play the game in accordance 
with wise, recognized principles. 
Consider, for example, the way business is done at 
the port of London. This great port receives cot- 
ton, wool, rubber, ivory, mahogany, hemp, sugar, 
jute, coffee, wheat, and a hundred other commod- 
ities from all over the world. Numerous kinds of 
raw material can be shipped unsold to London and 
remain there, like commodities in a large city mar- 
ket, awaiting the purchases of the nations of the 
world. Representatives of all nations are anxious 
to buy cotton, wool, wheat, coffee, ivory, and rubber 
in the London market because not only is it a central 
market, but it is also advantageous to purchase goods 
there. In the first place, London merchants guar- 
antee the quality of the goods. In the second place, 
because of the network of ocean steamers radiating 
from England, the buyer is sure of quick delivery of 
his goods. And, finally, cheap freight rates are 
maintained from England to the rest of the world, 
The reason for this is that vessels which sail to 
England loaded with foodstuffs and raw material 
prefer return cargoes rather than empty space. Con. 
sequently, steamship lines which are outbound offer 
low, attractive freight rates. 
Great Britain has striven to offset her disadvan- 
tages in another way. She is the owner of the 
world’s greatest colonial empire. It is said that the 
sun never sets upon her dominions, for she holds 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, possessions 
in Africa, Jamaica, and other possessions in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 231 
Western Hemisphere. Her government of these 
possessions is wise and beneficent. Nor has Great 
Britain failed to provide strategic points of defence 
and commerce. Long ago she secured the mighty 
Gibraltar, at the western entrance of the Mediter- 
ranean Sea. Malta, Suez, Aden, Singapore, Hong- 
kong, St. Helena, Bermuda, and the Falkland Islands 
in the Southern Pacific fly the British flag. 
Great Britain’s naval power has been attained 
with great expense and with much sacrifice. How- 
ever, with her resources of coal, iron, and lumber, by 
means of skilled, intelligent labor, by means of her 
harbors, and by means of the united backing of the 
nation in the enterprise, Great Britain is the first 
naval power among the nations of the world. This 
navy protects a huge merchant marine, and the two 
together are extremely busy in world trade and in 
the development of British colonial possessions. 
In teaching Great Britain, the owner of the world’s 
greatest colonial empire, use the following problems. 
“ The colonial possessions of Great Britain are 
valuable for defence, for the development of industry, 
for extensive trade, and for the raising of food sup- 
plies. Why must Great Britain remain one of the 
great maritime powers of the world? 
Why is Canada necessary to the British Empire? 
Consider Canada as a source of food supplies, of 
lumber, of revenue, and of minerals. Why is Can- 
ada, a country of great resources, and the home of a 
young, sturdy race of people, contented to remain a 
British possession? 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  232 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
In what respects has Great Britain helped to make 
India one of her most important dependencies? Con- 
sider government, industrial development, health 
and sanitation, and products. 
Why are the resources of Australia and New Zea- 
land especially valuable to Great Britain? Emphasize 
the fact that, because of the position of these posses- 
sions, the products differ from those of possessions 
situated in other zones and are ready for the market 
at opposite seasons. 
Why was Great Britain anxious to gain full control 
of Egypt? Bring out the fact that, besides the cotton, 
rice, and wheat which she secured, the ownership of 
Egypt is important because of the control of the 
Suez Canal, of the Mediterranean and southwest 
Asia. 
What will the “‘Cape-to-Cairo” railroad mean to 
Great Britain? Transportation facilities are es- 
pecially important for the development of the African 
colonies, for Great Britain’s holdings are not only 
extensive but they are also scattered. They include 
British East Africa, South Africa, British Egyptian 
Sudan, possessions along the west coast and Zan- 
zibar. Again, the completion of this railroad will 
help Great Britain in the perfection of her federal 
idea of government, especially in the remote Brit- 
ish South Africa as well as in Egypt. It will 
also assist by providing means of defence against 
any possible incursion of Turkish forces to Af- 
rica. 
What men have been most important in extending 
 
-P-A-G-E-261

British influence in Africa? Consider David Liv- 
ingston, Cecil Rhodes, and Lord Kitchener.

13. The Home State; Germany and France in 
world commerce.—An intensive study of the home 
state—If geography serves to foster patriotism 
through the study of the country in sections, political 
or regional, and as a whole, it must no less serve to 
create in pupils pride in the achievements of their 
home state. In order that the latter objective may 
be made effective, an intensive study of this sort 
should be postponed until pupils have been trained 
to study, for then they will be ready to collect data 
about their state and to arrange this material most 
effectively. Good citizenship demands that one not 
only get the best knowledge he can, but also that 
one apply this knowledge to his social, economic, 
religious, and moral environments. The most ef- 
fective citizens are those who think and act in terms 
of accurate facts about their state and their country, 
and hence about the particular locality in which they 
live. Therefore, teachers and school officials should 
exercise particular care to see to it that the course of 
study makes provision not only for the study of the  
-P-A-G-E-262
  234 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
home state, but also for sufficient literature and up-to- 
date material about the state’s history, economic and 
geographical advantages, and other material which 
will stimulate pupils not only to solve particular 
problems, but also to create in them the keen desire 
to keep informed about the state’s achievements and 
its importance to them, the United States, and the 
world at large. 
The previous sections will have provided the 
method of going about this sort of study efficiently. 
Germany in world commerce.—Why was Germany one 
of the world’s greatest powers before the World War? 
Industrially, Germany became one of the fore- 
most of nations. Because of extensive agricultural 
territory, a favorable climate, and sunny harvest 
seasons, Germany is well favored by nature. The 
leading crops consisted of potatoes, rye, oats, barley, 
‘wheat, and sugar-beets. Nine tenths of Germany’s 
land is productive. The government, ambitious for 
effective development, had applied science to the 
conduct of farming. By means of crop rotation and 
the adoption of the world’s best methods of cultiva- 
ting the soil, production of staple crops in huge 
quantities resulted. 
Although Germany’s agricultural policy was ex- 
cellent and produced expected results, her population, 
growing at the rate of a million a year, forced large 
numbers to engage in manufacturing enterprises. As 
combines or big business concerns grew, the Imperial 
government assisted many of them. Consequently, 
it was not long before the German Empire began to

produce toys, munitions, iron and steel goods, dyes, 
chemicals, sugar, textiles, electrical supplies, and 
many other articles. 
Nature assisted the efforts of the people. The 
location of Germany, her surface, her climate, soils, 
minerals, forests, and waterways offered to them rich 
opportunities for diversified industries. 
The forests of Germany, in particular, which cover 
one fourth of the area, yielded lumber for ship build- 
ing, toys, and musical instruments, to mention a few 
articles. Realizing the importance of this asset, 
Germany instituted a policy of protection to her 
forests; and it was not long before she became famous 
over the world for the thrift and excellence of her 
forest conservation. It is generally predicted that 
the United States must eventually adopt some 
broad policy of government conservation or else 
timber resources in America will be depleted by 
private interests. 
Germany was one of the richest countries in the 
world in the value of mineral products. In one 
third of her area are located coal, iron, salt, potash, 
and other minerals. These formed the basis for 
modern Germany’s industrial development. 
Animal husbandry played an important part in 
Germany’s industrial success. Swine, horses, dairy 
cattle, and sheep were raised in great numbers. Fish- 
ing was a considerable industry. 
With her fields productive and tilled by thrifty 
farmers; with her mills manufacturing finished 
articles from her natural resources and imported 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  236 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
material; and with a government ambitious for world 
power, Germany naturally reached out for a large 
share of the world’s commerce. Commercially, 
she developed into one of the leading nations of the 
world. She first saw to it that transportation 
within Germany was perfected. Huge amounts 
were spent on railroads; fifteen hundred miles of 
canals were built; and the rivers were improved. 
Her coal, iron, and timber resources furnished abun- 
dant material for ship building. The Weser, Elbe, 
and Oder rivers have estuaries, or drowned mouths, 
which afford ocean-going vessels the opportunity of 
sailing far inland. Bremen, Hamburg, and Stettin 
are situated at the heads of estuaries. 
But Germany did not possess all the products she 
needed. Cotton, wool, silk, flax, nitrates, rubber, 
wheat, hides, skins, eggs, butter, petroleum, copper, 
and other commodities were necessary for her su- 
premacy. Besides, her population was not only large 
but increasing rapidly, and land was at a premium. 
Emigrants from Germany had been leaving to take 
up farming, to engage in business and to follow man- 
ufacturing pursuits and banking in other lands. So 
Germany began to look for ache since 1884 she 
had secured Togoland, the\Kameruns, German East 
and German Southwest Africa; Kiao-Chau Bay in 
Asia, Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land and islands in the Pacific 
and possessions in Samoa—in all 1,027,120 square 
miles with an estimated population of fifteen millions.”   
% Great Britain’s colonies and dependencies are estimated at 11,770,000 
square miles and their population at 388,000,000.
-P-A-G-E-267
  
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 237 
Germany built up an extensive foreign commerce. 
She began to import those things she needed and to 
export cloth and clothing, iron and steel goods, 
machinery and musical instruments, leather goods, 
sugar, dyes, chemical products, books, maps, and 
dozens of other articles. To South America, Rus- 
sia, Great Britain, the United States, Asiatic coun- 
tries and to all parts of the globe, Germany’s ships 
plied their trade. South America’s trade was par- 
ticularly important to Germany. She, therefore, 
established a liberal colonization policy, encouraged 
her best salesmen to stimulate the sale of German 
goods, maintained a high order of consular service, 
and wise banking policies with South American coun- 
tries. Germany’s local transportation and docking 
facilities—her canals, boats, ports, wharves, and rail- 
roads—soon became laden with goods from South 
America not only for consumption in Germany but 
for distribution in Europe. 
The history of the rise of Germany as an interna- 
tional power is as brief as it is startling. Gifted 
men—composers, educators, and military leaders— 
sought in every way to assist Germany in her efforts 
to become a great nation. Educational institutions 
of great renown were attended by students from all 
over the world. A fervid patriotism and well laid 
plans for world power—educational, military, and 
economic—existed everywhere, reaching their climax 
in the time of Bismarck and leading finally to the 
World War of 1914. : 
The above outline of Germany’s rise to a high
-P-A-G-E-268
238 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
  position among the world powers serves to cause one 
to consider why Germany embroiled the civilized 
world in war. 
The geography of Germany, in part, helps to ex- 
plain this. With immense wealth, with extensive 
commerce on the high seas and by land, but with an 
area of 208,830 square miles and with a population 
of 56,000,000 before the World War; with science 
applied to the limit to her soil and industries; with 
insufficient colonies; with Great Britain in control 
of the North Sea and with unsatisfactory Baltic op- 
portunities—all these caused discontent. In addi- 
tion, Germany felt that her people were superior to 
those of all other nations and hence she was entitled 
to rule the world. She deliberately set out to con- 
trol the world in order to satisfy her felt needs as 
well as to satisfy herself that she only was capable of 
governing the world. 
Once involved in war, how did Germany hope to 
feed her people, get supplies and win the war? 
Germany had counted upon her ability to gain 
complete control of American trade. By the inva- 
sion of Belgium and northern France, she hoped to 
secure and maintain the seaports of these nations. 
This would give her control of the North Sea and give 
her the much desired direct Atlantic outlet, all of 
which would give her a firmer grasp upon western 
trade. By the immediate invasion of Russia and 
Roumania, she was able to obtain huge supplies of 
food. By draining the Austro-Hungarian people of 
their resources, she added to her stock of materials
-P-A-G-E-269
  
ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEMS 239 
for maintaining her army. Germany through control 
of all central Europe longed for the possession of 
Asiatic trade. 
Her intense desire for markets in an easterly direc- 
tion led to the dream of the Berlin-to-Bagdad Rail- 
way, leading through a favored territory and termi- 
nating in a region full of rich possibilities. Her 
peculiar diplomacy started plots among the Indians, 
spread German propaganda in America and Mexico, 
and gained Mohammedan sympathy. Finally, by 
speeding up her own industries and by making a 
supreme effort in every direction in the German 
fatherland, she hoped to win the war. 
History supplies the rest of the story of the people 
who thus designed to gain control of the world. 
Dominated by a militaristic class who were satisfied 
with autocratic government and who desired to ex- 
tend German influence over the entire world, all 
classes of people were caught in their net. The 
thrifty on the farms, the industrious and _ skilled 
workers in the mills, the scholars in the universities— 
all were taught that unless Germany gained more 
by war she was being wronged by the world. Ger- 
man plots became notorious, deception was prac- 
tised by Germans well nigh everywhere, and, out of 
it all, Germany reaped the whirlwind and now finds 
herself with an area of approximately 175,000 square 
miles and with 50,000,000 people—her colonies 
gone, Alsace and Lorraine in the hands of France, 
and her dreams, for the time being, shattered. Surely 
Germany has chased the rainbow.

Trace the proposed Berlin-to-Bagdad Railway and 
show how important this land route would have been 
to a victorious Germany. If Germany had been 
successful in getting and holding northern France, 
what advantages would she have obtained for carry- 
ing on war? If Germany’s territory extended over 
northern France and her northern coastline also in- 
cluded Belgium, how much more powerful, com- 
mercially, could Germany become? 
France in world commerce-—The very territory 
which France possesses—that northern portion, in 
particular, which Germany wanted so much—gives 
France a superior position for ocean trade. Why, 
then, has France occupied an inferior position, in 
modern times, as a commercial power to that of Ger- 
many? This problem is presented for study by 
giving a series of minor problems and an outline, both 
of which should be developed in the classroom by the 
usual method of reading and discussion.

favorable to its development? 
What were the early advantages of France 
as an industrial nation? ‘ 
Until comparatively recently, France has done 
little colonizing. Account for this. 
Has France been successful in handling her 
colonies? Has France been successful with 
her African possessions?

They are patriotic. Contrast this form of 
patriotism with that of Germany. 
The people are contented at home, not seek-

        CHAPTER II 
SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE! 
LitHvuania 
History.—Long ago, three groups of the Indo- 
European family of languages moved westward 
from the plateau of Iran. They settled on the shores 
of the Baltic Sea, between the Vistula and the Salis 
rivers. These people, known as the Old Prussians, 
the Letts and the Lithuanians are now believed to 
have lived in this region many years before either 
the Teutons or the Slavs came. During the Middle 
Ages (1226-1281) the Order of Teutonic Knights, 
a German people, fond of fighting, tried to spread, 
at the point of the sword, Christianity. This order 
gained possession of the southern portion of the 
region, which was then occupied by the Old Prus- 
‘dane. The Teutonic Knights and the Old Prussians 
joined hands and laid the foundations of modern Prus- 
sia and its junkers, responsible for the World War. 
Later this order attacked the people who lived in 
the north—some of the Lithuanians. The main 
branch of these people, however, occupied the valley

of the Niemen River. They were not molested by 
the Order until the middle of the thirteenth century. 
All of these people were pagans. The Greek Ortho- 
dox Christians, the Roman Catholic Poles, and other 
religious orders undertook crusades against Lith- 
uania until they accepted the Christian faith. 
After this there was a great Tartar invasion led 
by Genghis Khan, which swept over central and 
western Europe and the southern parts of Russia. 
The Ukrainians, who lived in southern Russia, and 
other peoples thereabouts, put themselves under the 
protection of the Lithuanians to fight Genghis Khan. 
They checked the invader on the Volga River and 
the Sea of Azov. It was then that Lithuania ruled 
all that vast territory, which extends from the Baltic 
to the Black Sea, between the Ugra River in the east 
and the Narva and Bug rivers in the west, for a 
period of two hundred and fifty years. It is said that 
the Lithuanians were benevolent rulers, allowing 
the people considerable freedom of thought, speech, 
and action. 
At one time, Lithuania joined with another country 
to the west, Poland, thus forming a dual monarchy, 
like old Austria-Hungary before the war of 1914. 
This union did not help either nation. 
At the time that our Revolutionary War was 
being fought the Lithuanians were attacked by Aus- 
tria, Prussia, and Russia. The country was over- 
run and divided among these nations. From that 
time until the close of the World War they were 
tuled with the utmost severity by their conquerors.  
-P-A-G-E-276

246 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
It is said that Austria, Russia, and Prussia attempted 
to destroy the language, the institutions, and the 
national hopes of the Lithuanians. During this 
period, many Lithuanians and Poles emigrated to 
foreign countries, because they wanted to escape the 
many cruelties which were heaped upon them. Those 
who did not leave Lithuania and Poland continued 
to speak their own language and cherished hopes of a 
time when they would be set free. 
It is reported that from the beginning of the World 
War many of the young men of Lithuania deserted to 
the Allied armies. Upon the defeat of the Central 
Empires in 1918, Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia were 
recognized and restored by the Allied and Associated 
Powers to their rightful portion of free, sovereign, 
and independent nations. 
Geography.—Lithuania’s boundaries, as recom- 
mended to the Supreme Council of the Peace Con- 
ference at Versailles, does not comprise all the area 
of former times, but it has been reorganized upon 
what is known as the “principle of nationality.” 
Only portions of old Lithuania, in which the popula- 
tion is pure Lithuanian, are set apart as a separate 
nation. Those parts thoroughly Germanized or 
Russianized have been left to those nations. Its 
boundaries now are the Baltic Sea on the west; 
East Prussia and Poland on the south; on the north, 
Latvia, and on the east, probably, Russia. 
The soil of Lithuania is largely alluvial, very fer- 
tile, and well adapted to agriculture and cattle raising.
-P-A-G-E-277
  SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 247 
The climate, being tempered by the prevailing winds 
which come from the sea, is moderate. The leading 
agricultural products are rye, oats, barley, potatoes, 
wheat, peas, flax, and fruits (apples, cherries, and ber- 
ries). Fine grades of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and 
fowl are raised, with great profit to the owners. In re- 
cent years dairying has become an important industry. 
Ever since ancient times Lithuania has been 
famous for her forests of pine, oak, birch, ash, maple, 
and linden. 
This country is not rich in minerals and hence is 
not naturally adapted to extensive manufacturing. 
For fuel, peat is chiefly used, although coal is im- 
ported from England. Deposits of clay, lime, and 
quartz are also found. The radium mineral springs 
on the banks of the Niemen are famous to tourists. 
The manufactured products of Lithuania are 
leather, paper, farming tools, nails, horseshoes, beet 
sugar, and pottery. There are no coal and iron 
deposits. Owing to her abundance of flax and wool, 
it seems that there is a promising outlook for the 
future establishment of textile industries. Cotton 
is imported from the United States. 
The amber industry must not be overlooked. On 
the Baltic coastline of this country is the only place 
in the world where the collecting, digging, and manu- 
facture of amber is a practical industry. Ancient 
Pheenicia, Greece, Rome, and Egypt knew that this 
substance was deposited there. Many journeys 
were made to the shores of Lithuania for amber 
with which to make necklaces, buttons, and buckles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  248 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
The amber cigar-holders which are displayed in our 
stores to-day are made from this Lithuanian product. 
The area of Lithuania is about as large as both 
Virginia and Maryland. The population is estimated 
at about 5,000,000. 
The chief river is the Niemen. The principal 
seaport is Libau, which city is suited for the nation’s 
capital. 
Lithuania’s geographical position and good sea- 
coast offer excellent opportunities for both industrial 
and commercial development. With Russia as its 
eastern neighbor, it has far better prospects for 
substantial development than do certain other 
European nations like Switzerland; for much of 
this country’s commerce with Europe and the west 
must cross the territory of its small and recently 
reconstructed neighbor. 
Problems which might be offered for consideration 
of Lithuania are as follows: On what facts did the 
Lithuanians base their desire for independence? 
What geographical advantages should make Lith- 
uania important to the world’s work? Why did the 
Lithuanians migrate to the land which they now 
occupy? Where are the Lithuanians who have 
emigrated to the United States?? 
PoLanp 
History.—The people of Poland are Slavs. In 
complexion, Slavs range from brunette to blonde, the

former predominating among the southern Slavs, 
while blondes are more numerous among the north- 
ern people. The Poles speak a branch of the Indo- 
European language and hence are related to all the 
leading countries of modern Europe. The name was 
taken from the Polani, who first came from the East, 
in the “region of the Danube,” and settling in the 
valley of the Niemen River, laid the foundations of 
the nation. Many other Slavic tribes of the same 
family of languages flocked to the fertile fields and 
plains of the Baltic. These took up their abode 
north of the Carpathian Mountains, west of the 
Volga River, and south of old Muscovy. The Polani, 
however, always kept their own government, for 
their rulers survived and kept alive their national 
aspirations. 
The real history of Poland began with the es- 
tablishment of the Piast rulers in the tenth century. 
At this time Christianity became the national 
religion; and Poland took rank as one of the im- 
portant political powers of Europe. Successful 
wars of conquest soon enlarged its territories, which 
soon took in Lithuania, Pomerania, Ukrainia, Kiev, 
and other old countries, including all of the fertile 
region of south-central Europe lying between the 
Carpathians on the south, Muscovy on the north, 
the Baltic on the west and the Black Sea on the east. 
This was a very large territory as one will see who 
looks on the map. Its area is about 350,000 square 
miles. Manufactures and commerce flourished to a 
considerable extent.
-P-A-G-E-280
  250 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
Then came the monster Turks upon these peoples. 
These barbarians gave Poland a stunning blow. One 
group of people within Poland began to fight with the 
other. The peoples of one religion would wage war 
upon those of another. The rich people, called the 
aristocrats, held the peasants as their slaves. Selfish 
and incompetent rulers, unwise laws, disastrous wars 
with neighboring states, corruption and immorality 
in all the walks of life, so weakened the nation that 
it became an easy prey to the rising power of Russia, 
Austria, and Prussia. A nation could not exist in the 
face of such difficulties, for it was divided against 
itself, and pressed upon by foes from without. It 
was finally wiped off the map of Europe by the three 
great nations mentioned above. 
During all this time Poland was not without its 
patriots. Sobeski, Kosciusko, and others struggled 
to regain liberty and independence, but all their 
attempts failed. The leaders were executed, im- 
prisoned, or sent into exile. 
The real emigration of Poles to the United States 
began in the year 1870. Between that year and 1880 
40,000 entered our country. In 1885 the tide of 
Slavish immigration began to sweep through our 
ports of entry in an annually swelling stream, and 
Polish agricultural colonies were rapidly established 
around the Great Lakes, in Minnesota, and in the 
Dakotas. Texas has the distinction of containing 
the first permanent Polish settlement in the United 
States (1855)*, 
See “Poles in the United States,” Literary Digest, 60:36, March 8, 1919.  
-P-A-G-E-281
  
SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 251 
After the defeat of the Central Powers in 1918, 
Poland was again made a nation by the Allied and 
Associated Powers at the famous Treaty of Versailles. 
It became a republic and the presidency was awarded 
to the great composer, Paderewski. In this way 
Poland once more gained a place upon the map of 
Europe. 
Geography.—Poland, as reorganized by the Treaty 
of Versailles, is considerably smaller than it was in 
former years. The present area is about 135,000 
square miles or about the size of Montana, with a 
population of approximately 35,000,000. 
The climate is severe, the summers being ex- 
tremely hot and the winters excessively cold. The 
soil is mostly a light, fertile loam, well adapted as a 
whole to cereal crops, though here and there occur 
extensive barren tracts of sand, heath, and swamp. 
This is especially so in the eastern districts of Poland. 
Some of the fertile land is permanent pasture, where 
some of the finest cattle in Europe are raised. Much 
of it is occupied by extensive forests of pine, oak, 
birch, and hemlock. Rye, wheat, barley, hemp, 
wood and its products, honey, wax, cattle, sheep, 
horses, inexhaustible supplies of salt, some silver, 
iron, copper, and lead constitute the chief natural 
resources. For the export of the surplus of these 
products the Vistula, the Bug, the Sar, and other 
rivers afford good facilities. 
Warsaw, the capital and the largest city, owes 
its greatness to its position on the Vistula River, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
    
252 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
the rich surrounding agricultural country, to its 
manufactures, and to its enterprising people. It is 
also the seat of one of the most famous universities 
of Europe. Danzig, formerly belonging to Prussia, 
has been internationalized, and is used by Poland 
as its chief seaport. 
Agriculture is the chief occupation, but there is con- 
siderable mining and commerce. The chief exports 
are cattle, hides, leather goods, honey, cotton and 
woolen goods, glass and earthenware. The present 
population consists of Poles, Lithuanians, Germans, 
Russians, Jews, and Gypsies. The religion is chiefly 
Roman Catholic with many Protestants and Jews. 
Even as a state under foreign rule, Poland was a 
great industrial section before the World War. 
Why? (In the development of this problem, em- 
phasize the character of the people; minerals: coal, 
iron, and other minerals; textile and other industries, 
and the importance of sugar-beets to the agriculture 
of the country.) 
Poland was once called the “Granary of Europe” 
and the “‘Garden of Europe.’”’ Can these names be 
justified at the present time? 
Huncary 
History.—The Hungarians—in their own tongue, 
Magyars—come from the Tartaric family of lan- 
guages, similar to the Turks, the Mongols, and the 
Finns. Their ancient abode was somewhere in the 
plains and mountains of central Asia. Certain 
members of this family, having settled in China and
-P-A-G-E-283
  SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 253 
Japan, laid the foundations of those prominent 
Oriental nations. Others occupied the plains of 
what is now Siberia. Under the leadership of Attila, 
Tomerlain, and Genghis Khan, the Tartars overran 
western Asia, the eastern part of the old Roman 
Empire, Russia in Europe, Poland, and Ukrainia. 
Wherever their warriors went, they left death and 
desolation in their course. From their hideous ap- 
pearance, their cruel practices in war, their great 
numbers, and their oppressive rule, they were held in 
terror by all who dared oppose them. 
The story goes that the Hun or Tartar chieftain, 
Attila, was so savage and fierce that grass never 
again grew where his horse once set its hoof. In the 
footsteps of Tomerlain and Genghis Khan whole 
cities disappeared, populous plains were transformed 
to sterile deserts, and the bones of slaughtered civil- 
ians were piled high up in places. 
Europe was finally saved from these Huns. The 
Romans and their allies defeated, at Tours, a vast 
horde of Huns under their leader Attila, after which 
event those settling in the plains of Hungary, then 
known as Dacia and Pamonia, laid the foundations 
of modern Hungary, so named after the Tartar Huns. 
Hungary thus became “The Land of the Huns.” 
It will be recalled that the northern Tartar in- 
vasions were finally stopped by the Lithuanians near 
the Niemen (or Memel) River, after which these 
oriental barbarians either retired to Asia or settled 
down among the peoples with whom they had been 
waging such cruel warfare.
-P-A-G-E-284
254 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS | 
At one time, Hungary’s rulers were elected by a 
council and held office so long as they remained 
faithful to their subjects and discharged their duties 
as rulers. About 1000 A.D., Christianity displaced 
paganism, and Stephen was the first king under the 
new faith. So wise, beneficent, and efficient was this 
great and good man that even to-day he is regarded 
as the patron saint of Hungary, just as St. Patrick is 
recognized by the Irish. Other strong rulers followed 
Stephen. It was due to them that the Mongol in- 
vasions and Turkish were repulsed. 
It was in 1526 that the throne of Hungary became 
vacant. It was offered to the Hapsburg King of 
Austria. From this time down to 1918, with the 
exception of the nineteen years from 1848 to 1867, 
Hungary and Austria were united as a dual mon- 
archy. Each country, however, retained its own - 
local customs, institutions, and laws. 
Early in the nineteenth century, Austrian rule was 
displeasing to the Hungarians; and a revolt, led by 
the patriot Kossuth, resulted. This movement for 
national independence was crushed when Russia 
sent timely aid to Austria. 
The independent spirit and the national aspi- 
rations of the Hungarian Magyars could not be 
crushed by the stern rule of German Austria and the 
ruthless tyranny of the Hapsburgs. For a time it 
seemed that a second revolt, more dangerous than 
Kossuth’s, would break out. In 1867, just after 
our Civil War, Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria, 
chastened by a recent defeat at the hands of Ger-
-P-A-G-E-285
SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 255 
many, consented to a compromise. Realizing that 
absolute government over people of different na- 
tionalities was impossible, Hungary was recon- 
structed as a separate state and its relations with 
Austria were regulated by a set of laws. This dual 
monarchy, under a constitution, permitted the 
Austrian emperor to be King of Hungary; but the 
common interests of the two states (Austria and 
Hungary), such as foreign affairs, the army, and the 
finances were regulated by a parliament composed 
of delegates from both countries. Each, however, 
was to have its own local parliament, the one sitting 
at Vienna, the other at Budapest. This peaceful 
governmental relationship continued until the victory 
of the Allies in 1918. Since that time, Hungary, 
shorn of much of her former territory, has been 
recognized as an independent republic. 
  
Geography.—The new Hungary, as defined by re- 
cent events, has an area of about 46,000 square miles 
instead of 125,000, the old area. Even this may be 
reduced. Much of its former domain has passed 
under the political control of Roumania, Czecho- 
Slovakia, and Serbia. As now constituted, Hungary 
has Czecho-Slovakia on the north, Roumania on the 
east, Austria on the west, and Jugo-Slavia on the 
south. The population, composed of Magyars, 
Croats, Gypsies, Germans, and Jews, is about 
15,000,000. 
The soil, for the most part, is exceedingly fertile, 
and well adapted to agriculture and grazing. The
-P-A-G-E-286
  256 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
surface of this country consists chiefly of a vast plain 
called the “Alfold,” which is one of the greatest 
wheat and stock growing sections of the world. Be- 
sides wheat, other grains such as oats, maize, rye, 
and barley are extensively grown. Vast quantities 
of flax and hemp are cultivated with great success. 
Potatoes, tobacco, fruits, such as peaches, apples, 
and figs are raised with great profit. Wine is also 
an important source of wealth. Large quantities 
of horses, cattle, and sheep are exported. 
The leading occupations of the people are agricul- 
ture, some mining, manufacturing, and stock raising. 
Linen and woolen goods, leather, sugar, glass, and 
paper are its chief manufactures; and these, together 
with live-stock, constitute the chief exports. 
The prevailing religious sects are Catholics, Jews, 
and Protestants. 
The Danube River is the chief outlet to the sea. 
Budapest is the capital and chief city. 
In taking up the study of Hungary, it might be 
well to consider the problems, Will Hungary, smaller 
in area than formerly, be able to maintain as im~ 
portant a place in the affairs of the world? Why 
have the Slavs resisted the Hungarian yoke? 
CzecHo-SLOVAKIA 
Geography.—In the northeastern part of former 
Hungary, where the Carpathians slope toward the 
great Hungarian Plain, is a country which is now 
called Czecho-Slovakia. Lying directly between 
the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian
-P-A-G-E-287
  
SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 257 
Empire of former times, its location is important. 
It was Bismarck who said, ““Whoever is master of 
Bohemia, is master of Europe.” As Czecho-Slovakia 
now stands, it will be an effective barrier to German 
expansion. This region, comprising some sixteen 
counties of old Hungary, is the home of the northern 
Slavs or the Slovaks, an historic race of solid charac- 
ter and exceeding industry, whose fate, through the 
centuries, has been determined by other peoples. 
This country, when viewed as a whole, is rough, 
consisting of mountainsides and valleys. Since the 
country abounds in timber and mineral resources 
one would naturally expect manufacturing to exist 
in this mountainous and hilly country. As a matter 
of fact, the former monarchy of Hungary gave up 
about three fourths of its industries to these Slavs. 
According to present indications these will, ul- 
timately, be rehabilitated by the Czecho-Slovak 
Republic. 
The exports of the republic consist mainly of 
leather goods, glass, textiles, machinery, beer, and 
sugar. Possessing an excellent beet-root harvest, 
Czecho-Slovakia is in a position to export exception- 
ally large quantities of sugar. Hops and timber are 
also available for export on a large scale. The clays 
near Karlsbad provide material which is used in the 
manufacture of high-grade porcelain. 
The fruits of the temperate climate abound. In 
the eastern section of the country they are said to 
be particularly well flavored. The staple foods 
are black bread, the flour of which is a mixture of
-P-A-G-E-288
258 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY BY PROBLEMS 
barley and rye, potatoes, cabbage, milk, cheese, and 
cornmeal. Meatisaluxury. Salt is scarce and high. 
Czecho-Slovakia abounds in timber resources. 
The valleys and fertile lands were formerly owned 
by lords and nobles, who did not live in the country, 
or by the church. The peasants stayed on the land 
and tilled the soil. For this, they were paid a certain 
number of days’ work each year. The living condi- 
tions of these peasants were difficult to imagine. 
Even if they had land of their own, it was in the 
roughest and rockiest regions on the mountainsides. 
These peasants had little, scattered pieces of land, 
so barren that constant fertilizer was required, in 
which case it was necessary for them to haul the 
manure up the mountainsides in baskets. As a 
consequence, the Czecho-Slovak either went out to 
seek employment as a laborer in the rich fields of 
Hungary or emigrated to America, where, by sheer 
pluck, good behavior, unbounded energy, and by 
hard work he has won merited recognition and holds 
the confidence of the American people. 
Prague, the capital of Czecho-Slovakia, is situated 
on the Molkau River, a tributary of the Elbe River. 
Located in the midst of the most productive part of 
a country which has free use of the Elbe, Danube, and 
Oder rivers, as well as harbor privileges in Hamburg, 
Trieste, Fiume, and Stettin, Prague has become one 
of the chief trading and industrial centers in central 
Europe. Briinn, also a city of industrial importance, 
owes its growth to deposits of coal and iron near by. 
Agricultural machinery is manufactured in Briinn.
-P-A-G-E-289
SOME NEW COUNTRIES OF EUROPE 259 
Czecho-Slovakia is building canals to connect the 
Elbe, Oder, and Danube rivers. The Elbe River 
flows to the North Sea; the Oder River leads to the 
Baltic; and the Danube empties into the Black Sea. 
Three important cities—Prague, Aussig, and Bratis- 
lava—will therefore have access to the world’s 
commerce, and Czecho-Slovakia, though a land- 
bound country, will be linked to three seas and will 
be a maritime power. These ports are being en- 
larged so that Prague bids fair to become Czecho- 
Slovakia’s Chicago, Bratislava her San Francisco, 
and Aussig her New York. 
When the whole canal plan shall have been com- 
pleted, cotton and raw material can be imported all 
the way by water from New York or New Orleans 
to her mills in the heart of Bohemia. In like man- 
ner, exports will find their way out. Sugar, cut glass, 
and leather goods will, in all probability, lead the 
materials exported from Czecho-Slovakia. 
Problems that may be considered are, Why do 
you think that the Czecho-Slovaks may regain their 
ancient position in European civilization? What 
causes Czecho-Slovakia to be important to the sur- 
rounding countries? The Germans dreamed of a 
large kingdom lying through central Europe and 
thence into Asia. With Czecho-Slovakia, and the 
countries of Jugo-Slavia and Poland, as free nations, 
could such a dream be realized?

REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY IN A COURSE OF 
INSTRUCTION FOR THE SEVENTH GRADE 
A New Massacuusetts Manuau 
The following lines are printed by courtesy of the 
Journal of Geography from an article under date of Feb- 
ruary, 1919, p. 62, and entitled, “Regional Geography In 
a Course of Instruction for the Seventh Grade.” 
The sections are reprinted by permission of the Mas- 
sachusetts Board of Education. 
The purpose of the Manual.—The manual is distinguished 
by the emphasis it places on regional geography. This 
will be shown by the reprint below of a section of the 
manual. Before this is done, however, it will be necessary 
to glance at the aim and purpose of the manual. In the 
first place, the authors assign to geography a high rank 
in the school curriculum. “It (geography) applies so 
widely to the immediate problems of human life, it pos- 
sesses so broad a cultural value, and is so important in 
developing the powers of reasoning, of investigation, and 
of initiative that the committee feels that it deserves a 
prominent place in the upper grades or in the Junior High 
School.” As a basis for the courses proposed for the 
seventh and eighth grades, it is assumed that before the 
end of the sixth grade, all the continents will have been 
studied in an elementary fashion, and that the two suc- 
ceeding years may be available for covering the field with 
new method and emphasis. The United States and 
Europe, because of their importance, are selected for

intensive study, the United States being preferably 
assigned, other things being equal, to the seventh grade 
where it is to be supplemented by brief study of Canada 
and of the chief countries of South America. 
This type of geography teaching is based upon the 
division of the earth into natural geographic regions to 
which human activities are closely related. It sums up 
the important facts with reference to a given region, and 
shows their relation to man. It utilizes the best of each 
of the other methods. Thus it demands a knowledge of 
location and of political geography, but uses these as a 
means of understanding the climate, the commerce, or 
international relations. It also requires a knowledge of 
physical features, but uses these as a means to understand- 
ing man’s occupations, habits, and character. Far more 
than its predecessors, this method is characterized by a 
conscious attempt to meet the needs of the pupil as a 
member of society. This type of geography has been 
taught by progressive teachers for years. Now that the 
studies of the upper grades are being reorganized, the time 
seems ripe to accord to it (the regional treatment) a 
worthy place in every school. 
The outline for study of the regional geography of the 
United States recognizes the following natural geographic 
regions: 
(a) North Atlantic Lowland | 
(b) South Atlantic Lowland 
(c) Appalachian Highland 
(d) North Central Plains 
(e) South Central Plains 
(f) Rocky Mountain Region 
(g) North Pacific Slope 
(h) South Pacific Slope 
The classification is simple and practical, but it is well to 
point out here that, unlike a political classification, it 
is not absolute. According to the geographic factors
-P-A-G-E-295
APPENDIX 265 
stressed, the classification will vary in the hands of differ- 
ent interpreters. Those who are interested in pursuing 
the subject further should look up the papers, “The 
Subdivision of North America into Natural Regions,” 
by W. L. G. Joerg, and “Natural Economic Regions,” 
by C.R. Dryer, published in the Annals of the Association 
of American Geographers. 
Finally, it is intended that study of the natural regions 
be followed by study of the political divisions. Regarding 
the relations between the two divisions and the emphasis 
to be placed upon them, opinions will vary, and it would 
be interesting to learn how this works out in practice. 
Human Geography of the Natural Regions of the United 
States.—Since the available textbooks do not deal syste- 
matically with natural regions, the committee has felt it 
desirable to define those of the United States and Europe 
and to include in this manual a brief statement of the 
human geography of selected regions. A study of these 
regions may well serve as an introduction to the study 
of the political divisions as given in the textbooks. Thus 
the pupil is introduced to the United States or Europe 
by a study of the way in which nature leads the people of 
one region to live differently from those of another, and 
thus divides the world into natural regions which may 
or may not coincide with man’s political divisions. In 
connection with each continent, this study may be finished 
in a few weeks or expanded to two or three months at the 
option of the teacher. 
The following descriptions of the various regions are not 
exhaustive, nor do they suggest novel facts. ‘They merely 
illustrate some of the ways in which the pupils may be 
led from a human interest to a clear and broad geographi- 
cal concept. Other human interests may equally well 
be taken as the starting point. It seems to be unnecessary 
for the purposes of this manual to include descriptions of 
all the geographic regions of the United States or of Europe, 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  266 APPENDIX 
and no reference in this conlahedtiel has been made to the 
other continents. Enough of this t; of treatment is 
given, however, to illustrate the method. 
I. THE NORTH ATLANTIC LOWLAND 
The North Atlantic Lowland includes a strip of land 
from 30 to 50 miles wide, extending from northern Maine 
to the Potomac River. In general, it reaches back from 
the coast to the point where the hills begin to become 
mountains. Though hilly in the north, it is flat in the 
south. The irregularity due to the submergence of the 
coast multiplies the advantages of the lowland by provid- 
ing an abundance of good harbors for commerce and 
fishing. I il 
The dominant feature of this narrow coastal strip is a 
closely spaced series of industrial and commercial cities. 
Lying between Portland, Me., and Washington, D. C., 
about 1 per cent. of the area of the United States contains 
one fifth of its population, does one third of the country’s 
manufacturing, provides work for one third of the im- 
migrants from foreign countries, uses two fifths of all the 
cotton produced in the country, and carries on two 
thirds of the country’s foreign commerce. All this is true 
largely because the lowland is within comparatively easy 
reach of Europe, the climate is invigorating, the harbors 
are commodious, and water power is abundant. For 
three hundred years the lowland has been the place that 
Europeans have chiefly thought of as they planned for 
emigration to America or carried on commerce with the 
people across the sea. 
Since good farm land is not abundant here, agriculture 
has never been of first importance. The people have been 
obliged to turn to other occupations. Before machinery 
was common the people of the North Atlantic Lowland 
engaged largely in ocean commerce, whaling, and the slave
-P-A-G-E-297
  APPENDIX 267 
trade. Later they undertook manufacturing. For this 
purpose they brought to their homes the cotton of the 
South and the coal and iron of Pennsylvania and states 
farther west, but they used the water power of their own 
rivers. Being within easier reach of Europe than was any 
other part of the country, the lowland was the first to 
learn from that continent the art of manufacturing; and it 
still derives great profit from its relative proximity to 
Europe because the immigrants from the Old World us- 
ually land on its shores, where it is easy to secure them for 
factory labor. 
In some respects it is unfortunate that hilly and even 
mountainous spurs from the Appalachian Highland ex- 
tend into the lowland and make the surface rough so 
that good farm land is scarce. The little farming possible, 
however, is well done. Since most of the level land lies 
near the coast and surrounds the bays where the cities 
are located, the farmers devote themselves largely to 
vaising vegetables, poultry, and fruit and to producing 
milk for the city markets. So well is the land cultivated 
that this 1 per cent. of the country’s area raises 3 per cent. 
of the crops and produces more per acre than any other 
section. 
Main Problem.—Why should the North Atlantic Low- 
land have more large cities than any other region of the 
United States? 
Minor Problems. 1. From a list of the sixty largest 
cities of the country, to be found at the back of your geog- 
raphy textbook, select those that are located in the 
North Atlantic Lowland. Prove that no other natural 
region of the country contains so many. 
2. Relation of the leading cities of the North Atlantic 
Lowland (those in the list. you have made) to good har- 
bors. Which are located on good harbors? Does any 
other region have so many good harbors? 
8. Relation of the leading cities to rivers. Which are
-P-A-G-E-298
  
  | 
268 APPENDIX 
| 
located on navigable rivers or canals? ich are located. 
at waterfalls? Does any other region have better 
opportunities for river cities? 
4. Relation of these cities to Europe as compared with 
the relation of other cities of the country. What ad- 
vantages are there in this relation? 
5. Position of the leading cities in respect to coal 
mines. 
6. What effect has the climate of this lowland as com- 
pared with that of other regions of the country in produc- 
ing an energetic people? What effect does this have upon 
the growth of cities? 
7. How early was this lowland settled as compared 
with other parts of the country? How, then, has age 
helped the growth of the cities here? 
Conclusion.—(Under this head the answer to the main 
problem is to be given in the form of a brief summary of 
the results of the minor problems.) 
2. THE SOUTH ATLANTIC LOWLAND 
The South Atlantic Lowland consists of the level plain 
or gentle hilly country extending from the Potomac River 
to the Gulf of Mexico. On the west it is bordered by the 
eastern slope of the Appalachians, but farther south it is 
arbitrarily separated from the South Central Lowland 
by the boundary between Georgia and Alabama. Al- 
though five or six times as large as the North Atlantic 
Lowland, it has less than half as many people, does only 
one seventh as much manufacturing, carries on only one 
fifteenth as much foreign commerce, and uses no more 
cotton in its mills, even though the cotton grows right 
there. It has only one foreigner to more than fifty in the 
northern lowland. These conditions are due partly to 
the fact that the climate is admirably adapted to cotton 
and tobacco raising and to the negro, but not so well
-P-A-G-E-299
  APPENDIX 269 
to the white man of northwestern Europe. They are also 
due to the distance of the South Atlantic Lowland from 
Europe and to the scarcity of good harbors along its coast. 
These conditions tend to drive people inland instead of 
holding them near the sea. Moreover, an inner border 
of mountains hinders trade much more than do the moun- 
tains on the western side of the North Atlantic Lowland. 
The swampy, and in many places unhealthful, coast with 
its few and poor harbors caused the early settlers to press 
inland till they reached the gently rolling inner strip with 
its deep, rich soil where cotton and tobacco thrive. 
Hence commerce and fishing did not flourish and, when 
the time came for manufacturing, the people were deriving 
such prosperity from their farms that they did not care to 
try other occupations. In fact, agricultural labor was in 
so great demand that there was little to spare for manu- 
facturing, and negroes were brought from Africa in order 
to raise big crops of cotton to sell to the North Atlantic 
Lowland and England. To-day the presence of tobacco in 
the north, and cotton farther south, is causing manufac- 
turing cities to grow up in the interior, or Piedmont, sec- 
tion of the South Atlantic Lowland, but the coast cities 
do not grow rapidly. There is little immigration because 
of (1) few ports, (2) a warm climate, (3) the presence of 
the negro to furnish labor on the farms. 
Main Problem.—Wbhy are Fernandina, Fla., and Savan- 
nah, Ga., the leading ports of the world for “naval stores’’? 
Minor Problems.—1. What are “naval stores”? Why 
are they so called? 
2. What trees produce naval stores? Where do these 
grow in the United States? 
8. What parts of the United States and what countries 
of the world use large quantities of naval stores? 
4. Where are these ports in relation to the places where 
naval stores are produced and the places where they are 
used?
-P-A-G-E-300
    270 APPENDIX 
Conclusion.—(To be stated in the form of a brief sum- 
mary of the results of the minor problems.) 
38. THE APPALACHIAN HIGHLAND 
The Appalachian Highland, a long, narrow strip extend- 
ing from the mountains of Maine southwest through the 
White Mountains, Adirondacks, Alleghany Plateau, and 
Appalachian Mountains proper to northern Alabama, is 
the lumber yard, coal bin, and pleasure resort of the eastern 
half of the United States. The northern end differs little 
from the southern, for the difference in latitude is partly 
offset by the higher elevation of the southern. Through- 
out much of its length the ruggedness and coolness of the 
mountains forbid agriculture, so that forests grow every- 
where, and lumbering is the chief occupation. The for- 
ests and the ruggedness of the section combine to make 
travel difficult and to make it impossible for people 
to live there in large numbers. In certain localities the 
sparse population is uneducated and backward. Such 
conditions would be more prevalent if it were not that a 
long fertile valley extends through the highland almost 
from end to end between the mountains on the east and 
the plateau on the west. In the North, in such regions 
as the Adirondacks and White Mountains, the presence of 
great numbers of summer visitors helps to bring prosperity, 
but this influence is only beginning to be felt in the South. 
The center of the Appalachian region is quite different 
from the rest. In the first place, this is where the high- 
land can be crossed most easily. From New York an 
easy route by the Hudson Valley and Lake Champlain 
leads across to Montreal, while the still easier route by 
the Hudson and Mohawk valleys leads to the Great Lakes. 
Therefore several cities, like Albany and Utica, have 
grown up, but New York has reaped the chief benefit from 
this situation by being the seaport which can most easily 
handle the products of the Great Central Plains. Farther
-P-A-G-E-301
APPENDIX 271 
south, in Pennsylvania and Maryland, the valleys of the 
Delaware, Susquehanna, and Potomac also furnish routes 
across the Appalachian Highland, although not so good as 
that of the Hudson-Mohawk Valley. It is fortunate that 
just where the climate and position of the North Atlantic 
Lowland most favor rapid development it is easiest to 
cross the highland and reach the Great Central Plains. 
A second reason why the center of the Appalachian 
Highland differs from the extremities is found in the 
great deposits of coal in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
Therefore in this region mining and manufacturing are 
more important than lumbering, and in consequence there 
are found such cities as Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Johnstown, 
and Scranton. The factories are not like those of the 
North Atlantic Lowland, however, for they are concerned 
with turning coal into coke, with smelting iron ore, and 
with making machinery, rails, and other steel and iron 
products. Around Birmingham, Ala., “the Pittsburgh of 
the South,” the presence of coal and iron causes the low 
southern tip of the Appalachian Highland to be somewhat 
\ike the center. Apart from its coal and its forests the 
Appalachian Highland is chiefly important as a barrier. 
In the future, however, its use as a playground will become 
more and more prominent. 
Main Problem.—Why are the Adirondack Mountains 
one of the most famous summer resorts, while the North 
Carolina Mountains are rarely visited? 
Minor Problems.—1. How do the Adirondack Moun- 
tains compare with the North Carolina mountains in 
respect to: 
Height of the mountains and the presence of 
forests? 
The warmth and length of the summer of the 
neighboring lowlands and the consequent need of 
a cool place for recreation? 
Proximity to large cities?
-P-A-G-E-302
  ane APPENDIX 
Comparative number of nl ad lines entering 
the two regions? 
Wealth of the neighboring regions and the ability 
of the people to afford vacations? 
2. Will the North Carolina mountains ever be as 
popular a summer resort as the Adirondacks? 
Conclusion.—(To be stated in the form of a brief 
summary of the results of the minor problems.) 
4. THE NORTH CENTRAL PLAINS 
As “cotton is king” in the South, so “corn is king” 
in the northern half of the great grassy plains that extend 
from the western base of the Appalachian Highlands to the 
eastern base of the Rocky Mountain Region. This is the 
home of the farmer. With a quarter of the country’s 
area and a third of its people this section raises half of the 
food, has half the cows and horses, keeps 60 per cent. of 
the swine, and raises three fourths of the corn, oats, and 
barley produced in the whole country. The North Cen- 
tral Plains provide the country’s food in much the same 
way that the North Atlantic Lowland provides the manu- 
factures and handles the foreign commerce. With a 
climate that makes people energetic, with deep, rich soil, 
and with vast expanses of level surface where roads and 
railroads are easily built, such a region is most favorably 
conditioned to provide enormous quantities of food for the 
workers in the factories farther east and in Europe. It 
has its own manufacturing region around the Great Lakes, 
where there are cheap transportation facilities and abun- 
dant coal. Automobiles, farm machinery, cutlery, and 
hundreds of other kinds of iron and steel products are 
manufactured. Away from the coal beds and the lines of 
easy transportation by water, the factories are less numer- 
ous and are chiefly those that grind wheat, make butter, 
can vegetables, prepare meat, or otherwise use farm prod- 
ucts. Such manufacturing is quite different from that
-P-A-G-E-303
  
APPENDIX 273 
of the smoking steel factories of the center of the Appalach- 
ian Highland, or the humming textile mills of the North 
Atlantic Lowland. With its abundant food, prosperous 
farmers, stimulating climate, and easy transportation, 
the North Central Plains lack only a seacoast and good 
opportunities for recreation to provide almost ideal geo- 
graphic surroundings. 
Main Problem.—Routes of transportation are more 
numerous in the North Central Plains than in any other 
equally large region in any part of the world, except the 
western lowland of Europe. What conditions have made 
this possible? 
Minor Problems.—1. Lakes: (a) What are the op- 
portunities for lake transportation? (b) What is the 
combined length of the lakes? (Use scale on map.) (c) 
Are there to be found anywhere else so many large lakes 
that join one another? (d) What is the origin of these 
lakes? 
2. Rivers: (a) What navigable rivers are there in 
the North Central Plains? (b) What is the combined 
length of the navigable parts? (c) What relief of the 
land allows the rivers to be navigable for so great a dis- 
tance? (d) Why are these rivers not used more for 
transportation? 
3. Canals: (a) What canals have been dug to per- 
mit transportation from one lake to another? (b) What 
canals connect rivers with lakes? (c) Why are the 
lake-to-lake canals so extensively used and the lake-to- 
river so little used? 
4. Railroads: Look at a railroad map of the United 
States and notice the close network of railway lines cover- 
ing the North Central Plains. (a) How has relief 
favored the building of these lines? (b) How have the 
number and wealth of the inhabitants encouraged railway 
building?
-P-A-G-E-304
  274 APPENDIX 
5. Roads: Roads are very numerous all over the 
North Central Plains. How has their extension been 
influenced (a) by relief; (b) by fine soil; (c) by the 
presence of farms everywhere? 
6. In general: (a) What products are raised in this 
region that are easily transported to markets? (b) 
Which transportation routes have been favored by the 
presence of coal? (c) Where are the coal fields? 
Conclusion.—(To be stated in the form of a brief sum- 
mary of the results of the minor problems.) 
5. THE SOUTH CENTRAL PLAINS 
The South Central Plains consist of the central plains 
south of the southern boundaries of eee Kansas, 
and Missouri. 
6. THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION 
The treatment of this topic and the preceding one on 
the South Central Plains should be developed in accordance 
with the plan used for the other regions. 
7. THE NORTH PACIFIC SLOPE 
It is strange that one of the best parts of the United 
States should have remained almost uninhabited until a 
half century ago. The North Pacific Slope, between the 
crest of the Cascade Mountains and the sea, is blessed 
with one of the best climates in the United States both for 
health and for agriculture. It is one of the most beautiful 
regions. It has splendid harbors and easy. water com- 
munication, and possesses abundant natural resources 
in the form of timber, coal, and other minerals. Yet a 
half century ago, it had only one inhabitant to every five 
hundred in the United States. To-day comprising about 
one fiftieth of the country’s whole area, it has about one 
fiftieth of the population, and is growing more rapidly
-P-A-G-E-305
APPENDIX 275 
than any other part of the country. The reason the North 
Pacific Slope, comprising the western part of the states of 
Washington and Oregon, was so long neglected is that it is 
comparatively remote. The Cascade Mountains on the 
east and Siskiyou Mountains on the south are formidable 
barriers. Then, too, the great Pacific Ocean on the west 
separates it from China and Japan. The coast is so 
rainy and rugged that few people can live there. For the 
foregoing reasons the veritable gem of country comprising 
the Willamette and Puget Sound valleys between the 
Olympic Range and the Cascades remained unused almost 
to our own day. Now it has become one of the country’s 
finest agricultural regions. Compared with the North 
Atlantic Lowland, it cannot carry on so much commerce 
because it is too far from the great markets. In spite of 
this, cities like Seattle are beginning to do much manu- 
facturing to supply the needs of the Pacific coast. The 
moist slopes of the magnificent mountains are covered with 
the finest kind of forests, where some of the Douglas firs 
rise to a height of 300 feet. So abundant are forests that 
nearly half of the states of Washington and Oregon has 
been placed in forest reserves by the United States Govern- 
ment. Wood is so plentiful that Seattle is one of the 
chief woodworking centers of the country. 
Main Problem.—Suppose the prevailing wind of the 
North Pacific Slope were an easterly instead of a westerly 
wind. What differences in the life of the region would be 
found? i 
Minor Problems.—1. The present distribution of rain- 
fall. How much is there (a) on the coast; (b) in the 
Willamette and Puget Sound valleys—for example, at 
Portland and Seattle; (c) on the eastern side of the 
Cascade Mountains? 
2. If the winds came from the east, what parts of this 
region would receive the greatest rainfall; the least? 
3. Consider the relation of such winds to the ocean and
-P-A-G-E-306
  276 APPENDIX 
the continent. What parts of the United States would 
the dry portions probably resemble? 
4. Would there be any forests? If so, where would 
they be? How would they compare with the wonderful 
forests that now cover the Olympic Mountains? 
5. Would the population be as abundant as now? What 
sort of occupations would the people probably follow? 
Conclusion.—(To be stated in the form of a brief sum- 
mary of the results of the minor problems.) 
8. THE SOUTH PACIFIC SLOPE 
The most surprising thing about the South Pacific Slope, 
which embraces California from the crest of the Sierras to 
the ocean, is the number of products in which it stands 
first. Most people know that California rivals Colorado 
as a gold-mining state and that it stands first in raising 
oranges and grapes. Few, however, realize that it also 
stands first in raising melons, string beans, plums, aspara- 
gus, and walnuts. One tenth of all the country’s melons, 
fruits, and nuts come from this region. It raises one 
seventh of the string beans, nearly one third of the plums 
and prunes, and more than one third of the asparagus. 
As for oranges, half of those produced in the United States 
are from the South Pacific Slope, while two thirds of the 
grapes and four fifths of the walnuts come from there. 
In spite of its wonderful achievements in agriculture, 
however, the South Pacific Slope is not very densely 
populated, for it contains vast areas that are either too 
mountainous or too dry to support many people. Never- 
theless, it has as many inhabitants as the Rocky Mountain 
Region, which is six times as large. 
Four great natural resources have in turn been the 
mainstay of the South Pacific Slope. Before the coming 
of the white man, the Indians, not knowing how to use 
many of these resources, were very poor and degraded.
-P-A-G-E-307
APPENDIX arr 
The Spaniards brought cattle and so were able to use the 
abundant grass—the first important resource. California 
might still be a great cattle country, as it was in the days 
of the old missions, if other occupations were not more 
profitable. One of these occupations is mining. It began 
in the middle of the last century when “prospectors” 
found that gold was an important resource of the western 
slope of the Sierras. The people who came for gold had 
to be fed, and they began to use still another resource— 
the fertile soil. On account of this California acquired 
fame because of its vast fields of wheat and barley. Cereal 
farming was so profitable that it banished cattle raising 
from the better watered parts of the country. Then a 
fourth resource—the water of the rivers—was used. By 
means of irrigation the raising of fruit and vegetables 
became so profitable that in large areas it took the place 
of cereal farming. This will probably be the great endur- 
ing industry of the country, for agriculture of this sort is 
the chief occupation in other subtropical countries, such as 
Italy and Syria, which resemble California in having 
abundant rain in winter and a long, dry period in summer. 
Main Problem.—Why do so many people like to visit 
southern California? 
Minor Problems.—1. The kind of climate: (a) tempera- 
ture (amount of variation from day to day and from sea- 
son to season); (b) rainfall (amount, season, number of 
rainy days); (c) character of the season. 
2. Character of the scenery: (a) mountains; (b) 
forests; (c) vegetation of the irrigated areas; (d) deserts; 
(e) coast. 
8. Irrigation: Why should life in an irrigated fruit 
region be attractive? 
4. Manufacturing: Is there much or little in southern 
California? Why? Does this condition make the region 
attractive? What sort of people does it attract?
-P-A-G-E-308
  278 APPENDIX 
5. Many people come to southern California for their 
health. Which of the conditions suggested above are 
especially attractive to them? 
Conclusion.—(To be stated in the form of a brief 
summary of the results of the minor problems.)

sent from the foreign offices, containing notes upon foreign 
industries, agriculture, and affairs in general are valuable 
reference material. 
Congressmen and Senators can assist.—Congressmen 
and Senators at Washington are glad to assist in distribut- 
ing copies of government publications among their con- 
stituents. Teachers may write to them. While some of 
the publications have to be purchased, the great majority 
are issued for free distribution. Applications, in modera- 
tion, by schools are usually granted, provided the quota 
is not exhausted. 
Farmers’ Bulletins, issued by the Department of Agri- 
culture, Division of Publications, will be sent free so long 
as the supply lasts, on application to the Secretary of 
Agriculture, Washington, D. C., or to any Senator, Repre- 
sentative, or Delegate in Congress. Thousands of these 
bulletins have been distributed. 
Special lantern slide sets.—Sets of about fifty lantern 
slides, each set accompanied by a syllabus or lecture, can 
be loaned for short periods to schools, for which applica- 
tion must be made to the Forester, Forest Service, Wash- 
ington, D. C. Some of the subjects available are: Nature 
Study and Forestry, Botany and Forestry, Manual Train-
-P-A-G-E-312

ing and Forestry, Geography and Forestry, Agriculture 
and Forestry, and Life of a Tree. These are loaned under 
certain conditions. | 
Traveling exhibits of commercially important woods.— 
Schools may also obtain from the Forester, Forestry 
Service, Washington, D. C., samples of commercially 
important woods together with illustrative maps. These 
are loaned for a short time. 
Photograph exhibits.—Photographs illustrating some 
special feature of foresting work or forest conditions in the 
United States can be secured by schools from the Forestry 
Service of the Department of Agriculture for a short loan. 
The Smithsonian Institution.—Many publications of 
the Smithsonian Institution deal with subjects of timely 
and general interest; and, often, the treatment, though 
scholarly, is non-technical and well illustrated. For in- 
stance, ‘The Mineral Industries of the United States” 
is a series which may be obtained free of charge from the 
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., and com- 
prises the following subjects: Coal Products, Fertilizers, 
Sulphur, Coal, Power, Petroleum, The Energy Resources 
of the United States, etc. 
State universities.—The several State Universities are 
beginning to send out to schools special lantern slides and 
moving pictures. Address the Secretary of your State 
University, asking for a list of such material issued by 
them. The Bureau of Commercial Economics, Wash- 
ington, D. C., furnishes a list of picture films for moving 
pictures. 
National Geographic Society—During the time that 
the National Geographic Magazine has been published 
an immense reservoir of photographs has been issued.
-P-A-G-E-313
  
APPENDIX 283 
In order that these photographs may be available to 
schools the National Geographic Society, Washington, 
D. C., has established a school service which is issuing, 
from its vast pictorial collection, a series known as 
Pictorial Geography. So far there have been issued four 
sets: those on Eskimo Life and Sahara Life, each contain- 
ing twenty-four sheets, while of those on the Land, Water, 
Air, and the United States, each contains forty-eight 
sheets. The picture subjects and the reading matter 
accompanying each picture are in conformity with cur- 
rent geographical courses. More sets are being issued as 
rapidly as possible. They are sold at cost. 
The National Geographic Society also issues weekly a 
Geographic News Bulletin for the Department of the Inte- 
rior, Bureau of Education. The bulletins are furnished by 
the Society. Teachers may apply individually for them; 
principals may apply for copies for teachers (not for 
individual pupils at present) and for their school libraries. 
Superintendents desiring copies for their entire teaching 
staff should correspond with the Bureau of Education, 
Washington, D. C., as to methods of sending in quantities. 
These bulletins contain many problems for use in class- 
rooms. 
Other magazines.—Of special importance to teachers, 
because of the wealth of pedagogical and geographical 
material contained in them, are the Geographical Review, 
published by the American Geographical Society, New 
York City, and the Journal of Geography, the official jour- 
nal of the National Council of Geography Teachers and 
published by A. J. Nystrom and Company, Chicago, IIl.; 
Asia—Journal of the American Asiatic Association, pub- 
lished by the Asia Publishing Co., New York City, the 
Geographical Journal, published by the Royal Geogra- 
phical Society, London, England, and the Scottish Geo- 
graphical Magazine, published by the Royal Scottish 
Geographical Society, Edinburgh, Scotland.

THE CLIMATE OF LIBERIA 
An article, “The Climate of Liberia and Its Effects 
Upon Man,” by Emory Ross (Geographical Review, 
June, 1919), closes with this statement (p. 402): “The 
writer has cited many things in this paper that do not bear 
directly on climate, in an attempt to point out a few of 
the influences that, connected with an unusual and in- 
hospitable climate, combine to make acclimatization at 
present all but impossible. My feeling is that, if the 
earth’s increasing population makes the acquisition of 
additional cultivated land areas of sufficient importance 
to justify the immense efforts that would be necessary for 
the sanitation of tropical countries, acclimatization of the 
white man to these countries would be possible. This 
means, of course, that the present bar to such acclimatiza- 
tion is mainly disease rather than climate.” 
An outline of the paper quoted above is reproduced 
here to illustrate the didactic treatment of climate rather 
than the purely scientific treatment of climatology. 
I. Meteorological records. 
1. “The only meteorological records in existence 
that have been made in Liberia over a period of 
more than a few weeks are those begun in 1913 
and ended in 1915.” 
2. Summary of the records.

November, occupied about seven months of the 
year. Precipitation described. 
8. Sensible temperature and insolation. 
A. “The sensible temperatures of the Liberian 
coast are not so high as those of many places 
in intermediate latitudes. The writer, at any 
rate, has never experienced in Liberia the sense 
of suffocation, gasping respiration, and general 
oppression that he has repeatedly felt in July 
and August in Indiana and Illinois, not to 
mention Mississippi.” 
The heat has steady persistence, and the cumu- 
lative effect is extremely enervating. 
“Tnsolation values are exceedingly high. How 
high, one lacks data for determining. It 
does not require instruments, however, to 
give one an appreciation of the power of the 
sun’s rays. Negligent or ignorant exposure 
by a European of a bare head to the sun for 
periods of 2, 5, or 10 minutes and like short 
periods of time, has resulted in prolonged 
pernicious fevers and sometimes in death.” 
Effects of elevation. Elevation above the sea 
level markedly affects the temperature, and hence 
the Europeans build their houses on the hills. 
The fact that makes the coast as good as it is for 
the white man, is the winds. The nights are 
cool, and the evening is the social time par ex- 
cellence of the tropics. 
A region of high humidity. Humidity data are 
not available, except in certain sections. Dur- 
ing the dry season, the rainfall is negligible, but 
moisture is supplied to the plant life by the excessive 
dews that, in many cases, are equivalent to light 
showers.

Influence of the rains on human life. The

DRAMATIZATION OF GEOGRAPHY 
Geography can be dramatized. In a fifth grade of 
eleven-year-old children, Miss Bessie Sampson, of the 
Bainbridge School, Richmond, Virginia, secured the fol- 
lowing review of the grade’s course of study about Latin 
America. The teacher organized the suggestions which 
were contributed by the pupils. These suggestions bear 
evidence of “purposing, planning and judging” by the 
children. The teacher, in assisting them in the actual 
dramatization, guided the purposeful activities of pupils 
in executing their plans.‘

Good morning, Mrs. Bolivia! What can I do 
for you to-day? 
(Opening basket) I have brought you some tin 
ore, some coca, some silver and some lead. 
(Places the packages on the counter). I don’t 
know what I want in exchange. I must look 
around. 
Take your time. (Handles the packages). 
I am glad to get all that you have brought. 
How about some cotton goods to-day? If 
what I hear is true, some of your children go 
practically naked. Maybe they wouldn’t 
be quite so savage if you would dress them 
properly. 
Well, Uncle Sam, my children are improving, 
I am sure; and that is more than can be said 
of some of yours. (Pointing) I'll take some 
of that blue calico if you will guarantee it will 
not fade. How is Mrs. Sam? 
I am afraid she has a touch of malaria. I 
wish you had brought me some cinchona. Be 
sure to bring me some next time you come, 
because I want to make some quinine for her. 
Bring some more coca, for this tooth is bother- 
ing me and I may need some cocaine. By the 
way, I hear that our friend Chile has opened 
his heart and given back the property which 
it is said he took from you some time back. 
Yes, that’s so. I can nowopen my windows on 
the Pacific. I can also take a sail whenever I 
like. 
That’s fine. How about some food products 
and some “drinks” (beverages) to-day? I 
know you need these. Do you need any rail- 
way supplies? 
Yes. I wish you would duplicate my last

There comes that Chile fellow now. I’m 
going. (Evits hurriedly). 
Enter Chile | 
“Talk about angels and you hear the flutter 
of their wings.’ Friend Bolivia and I were 
just saying how kind and noble you are to give 
her a part of your estate se she can have a 
window on the sea. 
Is that so? (Confidentially) You know, 
Uncle Sam, I believe she thinks I stole that 
land from her and that I have only given her 
what is hers by right. Well, never mind. 
See here, I have brought you a load of nitrate 
of soda to-day. Are you ready for it? 
Yes, the farmers around here have already 
been asking about it. They have found that 
it is a waste of time to try to raise anything 
when they have not used a good fertilizer on 
the soil. ‘ 
I’m coming to the store again Wednesday. 
Anything special you want me to bring? 
I could use some iodine, some borate of lime, 
and all the wool you can bring me. 
Allright. I have some samples to match for 
Mrs. Chile. (Pulls large roll of samples from 
pocket) We had better do this first, because 
I am afraid to go home without her order? 
(Laughing) All right. Woolen or cotton 
goods? 
Both. I hope we may be able soon to make 
most of the cotton and woolen goods that we 
need for our children, but we can’t do that at 
present. Besides, what we get from you has 
always been satisfactory. 
Miss Columbia, match these, please, and

make a package of the quantities called for 
on each sample. (Zo Chile) By the way, 
I hear you have formed a new stock company 
down your way, to pack meats and cure hides 
on an extensive scale. Is that so? 
Yes; and, what is more, the companies for 
manufacturing fertilizers are increasing each 
month. 
That’s going some! Now, Mr. Chile, how 
about some machinery for all of those new 
factories? 
Yes, I do need some machinery for them 
and also for a silver mine. I have made a 
list of what I want in the way of machinery, 
paints, and hardware. I wish you would see 
to it that these orders are given prompt 
attention. (Starting off) 
All right, I will. 
(Coming back in haste) Gracious! I forgot 
the very thing this string was to remind me 
of! (Indicates very long string hanging from 
finger) Be sure to put in a bottle of cologne 
and a cake of soap for Mrs. Chile. 
(Laughing) All right. What did she say 
about that hat you bought for her last week? 
(Making wry face) Don’t ask me! 
(Exit) 
(Addressing Miss Bolivia) There comes Mr. 
Argentina. I hear he has a good wheat crop 
this year and that means that while he will 
interfere with my wheat trade he’ll have some 
money to spend. I’m not jealous, though. 
“Live and let live,” say I.

crop this year. Is that so?

Yes, pretty good, Uncle Sam. We didn’t 
have a drought as we did last year; and the 
locusts didn’t take a notion to come and 
destroy my field, so I really have a bumper 
crop, thank you. We are rivals in wheat 
selling, Uncle Sam, but it happens that, this 
year, our near neighbors need all we can sell 
them. We are also going to do well in rye, 
barley, oats, beans, potatoes, and corn. 
Good! What can I do for you this morning? 
You carry electrical apparatus, don’t you? 
I’m going to have my house and my cheese 
factory wired for electricity next week and I 
would like to get the material and fixtures 
from you. 
The automobile truck I bought from you 
will be along presently, and I wish you would 
put on it some railway supplies I have listed 
here. (Hands the list to Uncle Sam) That 
hoe hanging there reminds me I need one. 
You may put that on the truck, too. 
By the way, Mrs. Sam told me to be sure to 
ask you if you could let her have an ostrich 
plume like the one Mrs. Argentina had on her 
hat Sunday. 
Sure, I can. I'll bring it next week. The 
truck is loaded with the hides you ordered 
last week. (Starting away) I’m trying to 
get a few more hands for my farm. While I 
have a few Indians, most of my help are 
Italians, so I think I'll go and look over the 
immigrants. Good-bye ’till I see you again.

Hi, Uncle Sam! Mother says send her (read-

a shirt for me to wear to school, one tack ham- 
mer for papa to put down the carpet, one box 
of shells for papa’s gun, one music box for my 
little brother, and one box of aspirin for my 
grandmother. 
All right, sonnie! 
You fix them up and I’ll come by on my way 
from school and get them. (Starts away) 
Hold on! Didn’t you bring me something in 
that basket? 
Gee! I almost forgot. Yes. Everything in 
here is for you except my lunch and that’s at 
the bottom. 
(Taking articles out of the basket as he calls): 
One dozen oranges, one package Paraguay 
tea, one pound leaf tobacco, two bottles of 
quebracho extract, one can of meat extract, 
three yards of lace, and eight grams of heron 
plumes for aigrettes. 
Allright, you will have to run to school. It’s

I am going back to that German fellow I 
used to trade with before the World War. 
I know an English merchant who would like 
to have my trade, too. They are both after 
me.

to lose your trade, for I can’t do without your 
rubber and coffee, to say nothing of your 
sugar, cacao, wax, and hides—and Brazil nuts 
for Christmas. Besides, I have a rush order 
here now from a big steel factory for some 
manganese ore to harden steel; and I want you 
to take the order back with you. 
I thought you needed my food products, 
machinery, shoes, paper and cotton goods. 
Don’t you? 
So Ido. But you will have to be more care- 
ful. That case of apricots I bought from you 
last week was a complete loss to me. A thin 
layer of the fruit on top was good, but all the 
rest was old, poor fruit. Then, too, I bought 
some scissors from you the same day. You 
remember, don’t you? Well, I found the 
shipment to contain some very poor pairs 
which I did not order. The box of grape juice 
was partly filled with paper and sand and 
contained only a few bottles of the juice. 
Why, I am astonished, old man! I can’t 
think how in the world that could have hap- 
pened! Oh, wait! That new clerk I had 
last week must have done all the damage. I 
found that he had been working for the Ger- 
man fellow you mentioned, so I discharged 
him. | 
Ah, I see! He was evidently trying to break 
up our trade. 
Exactly. Now, brother Brazil, you just be 
patient. I'll straighten out this trouble. 
There is no one I would rather have for a 
customer than yourself. I see that we are 
going to do a bigger business in the future 
than we have done in the past. I promise you

They tell me your asphalt beds are the finest 
ever. Is that so? 
Well, I just naturally believe we are going to

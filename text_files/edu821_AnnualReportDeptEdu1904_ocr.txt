STATE SUPERINTENDENTS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction was 
created in 1835, and by an Act of the Legislature of 1848, which 
went into effect in 1844, the office was abolished. The following 
Superintendents were elected by the Legislature: 
Roserr H. McEwen, 1835-1840.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
Nasuvit_e, Tenn., November 15, 1904. 
To His Excellency, Jas. B. Frazier, Governor of Tennessee: 
In compliance with Section 7, Chapter 25 of the Acts of 1878, 
T herewith submit the annual report of the Department of Pub- 
lic Instruction for the year ending June 30, 1904. 
The Act of 1873 establishing our system of public schools 
wisely provides for their support by both the State and county. 
It recognizes the duty of the State to provide for the edu- 
cation of all the children within its borders, and at the same 
time requires local taxation by the several counties in recog- 
nition of the fact that the county, as the smallest unit of tax- 
ation, brings the matter of education of the children nearer 
home to the people and also takes into consideration the differ- 
ent local conditions. 
The value of property, as well as the peace and prosperity of 
the country, depends largely upon the intelligence of the popu- 
lation of the whole State, and upon the security afforded the 
property of the State. Then, it is right that the State should, 
as a whole, bear a part of the burden of educating the children 
—the future citizens of the State—and that the expense should 
be apportioned among the property owners of the entire State. 
The children of a county that chances to be poor should not be 
deprived of an education simply by reason of their poverty. 
The State reserves the right to call into service every able-bodied 
man when needed to protect the property of the entire State. 
The State also depends upon the suffrage of all its citizens for 
its government. Then it should, so far as possible, furnish equal 
educational advantages to all. The rights of the boy who works 
upon the farm or in the shop, are just as sacred as those of the 
city or town boy, and as both are to become citizens of the State, 
their advantages should be equalized so far as possible. Again, 
from a commercial standpoint, it becomes the duty of the State 
to participate in the work of education. The business prosper- 
ity of the city is enhanced by the prosperity of the rural dis- 
tricts.
-P-A-G-E-23
—20— 
Yet there are good reasons why the responsibility for the ed- 
ucation of the children should be divided and a part left to the 
counties. For years to come, local conditions will control the 
length of terms and cost of schools. A special county tax for 
school purposes brings the matter nearer home to the people, 
and so elicits more earnestly their interest. 
The double system of State and county seems to me, then, to 
be the best. 
For many years after the inauguration of our school system 
the growth of county taxation was slow, but today every county 
in the State levies a special school tax, and the growth of this is 
gradual but healthy. Yet in most counties of the State the 
school term is too short. 
Sraristics. 
The statistics herewith submitted furnish a just cause for en- 
couragement. The average school term in the State has in- 
creased from 95 days to 103 days, while the enrollment for 1904 
was 9,554 more than for 1903 and 17,667 more than for 1902. 
The increase in scholastic population for the two years was only 
4,757. Especial attention is called to the very large increase in 
the number of pupils enrolled in the higher grades. In 1902 
there were in the eighth grade and above 7,852. This year there 
were 16,018, or an increase of over 103 percent. This indicates 
clearly an increased interest and confidence in our public 
schools. In the two years there have been erected 248 good 
frame and brick school houses. The most of these are up-to- 
date rural school buildings. Attention is called to the fact that 
in 1902 only 829 diplomas were issued to pupils completing the 
public school course, while in 1904, 1,774 such diplomas were 
issued. The average compensation of teachers for the past year 
has increased from $37.30 to $38.90, 
FINANCES. 
The great problem in Tennessee, as in all other Southern 
States, is, how shall we secure sufficient funds to increase the 
school term and employ more competent teachers? The finan- 
cial tables in this report show that we are making progress in the 
solution of this problem. The tables will show that the in- 
crease of the State’s part of the fund was met by a correspond- 
ing increase on the part of the several counties and that the
-P-A-G-E-24
—24— 
school term has been increased over 8 per cent. The appor- 
tionment to the several counties under the Act of 1903, which 
turned into the school fund the surplus in the treasury on the 
31st day of December, 1908, was $271,614.35. This represents 
the increase on the part of the State. The increase from coun- 
ties and municipalities from taxes and privileges was $376,- 
023.29. The total receipts from all sources for the year ending 
June 30, 1904, was $2,741,188.59, which, with the balance on 
hand at the close of the previous year, gave a total income for 
the schools of $3,647,494.17. The balance on hand June 30, 
1904, was $1,045,352.87 or $178,138.63 more than June 30, 1903. 
This is accounted for largely from the fact that the surplus was 
not distributed to County Trustees until January 15, and in 
many counties not apportioned by the Trustees to the several 
districts until April 1, the beginning of the second quarter. 
As most of the rural schools had closed at that time, the money 
was left on hand for the current term. The splendid showing 
in increase of “ Number of days taught” is to be attributed then 
only in part to the surplus act, and more to the consolidation of 
schools under the act of making school and civil districts co- 
extensive. As the public schools of the State cost approximate- 
ly $18,000 a day, we may reasonably calculate on an average 
term of 120 days for the school year ending June 30, 1905. This 
calculation is based on amount on hand and prospects of a 
slightly increased surplus from the State treasury and further in; 
creased advantages from anticipated consolidations. A differ- 
ence in the published report for 1903 and the present report of 
amount on hand at close of the former report and beginning of 
this, is accounted for from the fact that after the close of the re- 
port for 1903, investigation found in hands of Boards of Educa- 
tion in municipalities and due by Trustees $39,091.82 more than 
reported. Especial care has been. taken to secure from proper 
officials accurate reports, and I believe the figures given in this 
report to be correct. 
ScuHooL Bortpinas. 
One of the many hopeful signs of the advance in educational 
sentiment in Tennessee is the large number of good public 
school buildings that have been erected during the past two 
years. We have spent for this item alone, $444,799.41. This 
does not include several fine buildings built in cities by the 
issuance of bonds. The people are beginning to realize the
-P-A-G-E-25
—22— 
importance of providing comfortable houses, supplied with 
proper methods of heating and ventilation. If a pamphlet 
could be issued by the Department of Public Instruction giving 
plans and specifications for several different buildings, ranging 
in cost from $300 to $5,000, it would not only insure the build- 
ing of better houses, but would also save large amounts to the 
school funds. This pamphlet should be furnished free to 
directors. 
AGRICULTURAL TEACHING. 
The law requires the teaching of the elements of agriculture 
in the public schools of the State, and the farmers’ conventions 
held in the several divisions of the State have passed resolutions 
urging that more attention be given to this important subject. 
When the secondary school law was framed this branch of 
study was placed in the secondary grades, and the text-books 
heretofore used have been too scientific for the lower grades. 
The State Text-Book Commission, in the recent adoption, gave 
particular attention to this matter and adopted a book which we 
believe meets all the demands and can be used as low as the 
fifth grade. The law should be amended so as to place this in 
the primary schools and provide for its teaching in all the schools 
of the State. 
THOROUGHNESS IN ELEMENTARY STUDIES. 
The most urgent need in our public school system today is 
more thorough work in the elementary branches, such as 
spelling, reading, language, arithmetic, history and geography. 
The truth must be faced that these subjects are neglected in the 
everlasting pushing of the child into higher grades, and the 
great amount of supplementary work attempted. These defects 
are not local but general. An examination of the papers of the 
pupils of the fifth and sixth grades in city or rural schools in 
any section will demonstrate the truth of this statement. The 
lack of a practical knowledge of the principles of the subjects 
mentioned is shown by the large number of applicants who fail 
on teachers’ examinations and university entrance examinations. 
In the papers of applicants for teachers’ certificates, bad grammar, 
worse spelling and a careless knowledge of history and geography 
abound. Our high schools and colleges are hampered in their 
training work by having first to drill an adequate knowledge of 
fundamentals into pupils who come bringing certificates from 
primary and secondary schools. .
-P-A-G-E-26
—23— 
The cry for “enlarged curriculum” has led to the neglect of 
drills in the elementary branches. The time of teachers and 
pupils in our schools is filled to overflowing, and if more work 
is added it must follow as a principle of natural law that some- 
thing must be displaced. Once learning a subject is not enough 
to fix it in a young child’s mind. It must be reiterated until he 
is familiar with every phase of the subject and this requires 
time. It has been urged that correlation will make up for much 
of the lack of proper drills in the fundamental branches. In the 
work of skilled teachers this may be in part true, but with the 
great majority of our public school teachers correlation is an * 
“unknown art’ and is most likely to become a source of 
confusion. Superintendents, teachers and directors have no 
more important duty than guarding against overcrowding of 
courses of study and neglect of the essential fundamental 
branches. 
Our secondary school law is a good one, but in many places 
its operation has worked an evil Directors yielding to a 
popular demand for so called “higher education” have declared 
their schools “secondary schools” and required one teacher to 
attempt to teach the eighteen subjects embraced in the curri- 
culum. his would require, in the small school of twenty 
pupils, an average of thirty-two recitations a day. As the 
income for such schools is small, only one teacher can be 
employed, and to this J attribute much of the lack of thorough- 
ness in their work. No secondary school should be maintained 
with less than two teachers. 
County SUPERVISION. 
The county superintendency should be made more efficient, 
_ through wider power, higher qualifications and better compen- 
sation. There must be a general head in each county to plan, 
counsel and direct or the country schools cannot be systematized 
and developed. For want of executive management, schools in 
the rural districts in some counties in the State have not only 
failed to keep pace with those in the towns, but have retrograded. 
Seven-eighths of the school population of the State is in the 
country districts and the agricultural interests of the State are 
its most important. Practically all of this population depends 
upon the public schools for an education. Intelligent State 
policy demands that these schools be made efficient. They must
-P-A-G-E-27
—24— 
have direction that can come alone through intelligent super- 
vision. This would unify and give foundation and permanence 
to the country schools. It would inspire public confidence and 
save money for the people. 
The act of 1895 which requires candidates for County 
Superintendent to pass an examination prescribed by the State 
Board of Education was a great advance step and has made 
much more efficient the work of that office. There are many 
competent, faithful and zealous superintendents in the State, but 
in order to secure the best results and the best equipped men for 
the work of supervision, the office must pay a living to him who 
fills it, and the work of overseeing and directing the schools of 
an entire county should certainly demand the entire time and 
attention of an efficient person. If he gives this time and labor, 
he should receive a salary commensurate with the work he is 
required to perform. In many counties in the State, the salary 
is so small that the County Superintendent is compelled to 
teach or follow some other regular employment for a livelihood, 
This is poor economy for the State or county and the schools 
suffer in many ways. 
The Legislature should fix a minimum salary for the office of 
County Superintendent, and the duties and powers of this office 
should be enlarged and more definitely defined. He should be 
to the country schools, as near as possible, what the City 
Superintendent is to the city schools. 
Tsacuers’ Instirures. 
As long as our rural schools have an average term of less than 
seven or eight months, and the average salary paid teachers is 
less than $300 a year, the great majority of our teachers must 
come from the public schools of the State, without professional 
training or experience. The professionally trained teacher can 
find much more remunerative employment in the towns and 
cities. Nearly 25 per cent of our teaching force is new every 
year, and the average term of service in the country schools is 
less than three years. So long as this is the case, we cannot 
hope to secure the best results from our schools. Under present 
conditions we cannot demand professional training as a pre- 
requisite for employment of teachers, but we must provide for 
carrying the means for providing some kind of training to them 
after employment. This can only be done through a good
-P-A-G-E-28
—25— 
system of Teachers’ Institutes, and I believe the time has come 
for some legislation on this subject. 
Teachers’ Institutes have for their purpose: 
1. To expedite the work of the Department of Public 
Instruction by calling attention of teachers to any points that 
“may need especial attention. The Institute provides an organ- 
ization through which the State and County Superintendents can 
reach the teachers and through them the schools. 
2. To furnish to the teacher instruction in those subjects in 
which the examinations and the superintendents’ visits to the 
schools show poor results. This work is of immediate and 
direct benefit to the schools, as it guards against irregular and 
ingullicient, or poor instruction in subjects that are essential.   
      
3. To stimulate effort and investigation, and to draw from 
every available source the material necessary for success; also to 
bring the most successfu] and skilled teachers in contact with 
that large proportion of our teaching force which has not had 
the advantage of professional training or experience. In this 
way the pedagogical knowledge of the first named teachers is 
given the widest possible field and the schools derive the largest 
possible benefits. 
4, To bring to the teachers the free consideratiun and study 
of educational problems and needs. The teaching force is thus 
kept abreast of the times, familiar with the latest educational 
theories and ready to use those that have proven their worth. 
5. To furvish the teachers whose educational advantages 
have been insufficient an opportunity to review their studies 
under skilled instructors and at the same time receive training 
in the best methods of teaching and management. 
6. To foster and stimulate the professional spirit among the 
teachers and by elevating their estimation of the work, encour- 
age longer service and more thorough preparation. 
7. To bring patrons, teachers and citizens in direct contact 
for consideration of school questions, affecting the entire commu- 
nity and bring about cooperation of all the parties at interest. 
The Institutes of Tennessee have been of three classes: 
1. The District Institute in charge of the County Superintend- 
ent held in different districts of the county for one or two days’ 
session. These are for discussion of general school subjects and 
of interest to the entire community.
-P-A-G-E-29
—26— 
2. The Summer County Institute held for one week or longer 
with regular instructors, and intended as a school of methods 
for the instruction of the teachers who are to have charge of the 
schools the following term. The instructors are usually em- 
ployed by the teachers, but in some counties appropriations are 
made by the county courts. It bas also been the policy of this 
department to send instructors to as many counties as the ap- 
propriations made for State Institutes will permit. 
3. The State Institutes are held at three points in each divis- 
ion of theState, and are of four weeks’ duration each. The in- 
structors are employed by the Department of Public Instruction 
and paid out of the State Institute fund. These Institutes have 
for their purpose a review of the public school branches, and 
especial instruction on methods of teaching. school management 
and philosophy of education. 
In view of the importance of the Institute work, County Su- 
perintendents should be required by law to hold the annual 
County Institute and at least four District Institutes annually. 
The appropriation for State Institutes should be large enough 
to enable the State Department to hold the State Institutes and 
send at least one instructor to each county, where in his judg- 
ment it is needed. 
By reference to the summary table, page , it will be seen 
that about 80 per cent. of our teachers attend some kind of 
an institute each year. Attendance at the Annual Institute 
should be made compulsory. No money appropriated by the . 
State brings larger returns than that spent foe Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes.   
Private AND DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
No report of education in Tennessee would be complete with- 
out reference to the large number of excellent private and de- 
nominational schools in the State. This report accordingly in- 
cludes a table showing the most important statistics of these 
institutions. They errolled last year 27,007 pupilsand reported 
an estimated value of property, $9,135,370. Of the pupils en- 
rolled 17,478 came from Tennessee, while 9,529 came from other 
States. 
District Directors AND Counry Boarps or EpucaTion. 
A bill was considered by the General Assembly of 1903 pro- 
viding for abolishing the office of district school director and
-P-A-G-E-30
—27— 
establishing instead county boards of education. The law was 
finally amended to apply to Montgomery County and passed. 
Prof. P. L. Harned, Superintendent of Public Instruction for 
* Montgomery County, has furnished this department with a care- 
fully prepared report showing the operations of the schools for 
five years under the old system and comparing the average of 
the five with the one year under the new system. This report 
shows that for the five years the average term was 134 days, 
while for the year under the new system, without increasing the 
school levy one cent, every school in the county can run 160 
days, a gain of 26 days. 
In concluding his report, Supt. Harned says: 
“The system is based on the principle that all property values 
are estimated or equalized upon the same basis, that every one 
has to pay the same rate of school tax, and every one is justly 
entitled to the same number of schoo! days. If the county is 
the unit of taxation it should be the unit of school government. 
“ Asa matter of fact the white people pay most of the school 
tax. Under the old system of distributing the school funds 
according to scholastic population there were some colored 
schools run ten months, while many white children in other 
districts had less than six months. * 
“On July 1, 1903, there was to the credit of the school fund 
$21,685.20. The County Board of Education, by wise, economical 
and judicious business methods, has run the public schools of 
the county one month and two days longer than they were run 
the year before and closed the year with $23,699.64, or $2,014.44 
more than the Board had at the beginning of the year; this, too, 
after having paid all debts or accounts against the school fund. 
“ Purther, the County Board, with a considerable falling off in 
scholastic population, increased the enrollment in rural schools 
867, and notwithstanding the fact that hundreds of pupils for 
several months were kept out of school on account of measles, 
yet the average daily attendance for the year was increased by 
2538 pupils. 
“From all information that we have been able to obtain, the 
experiment in Montgomery County seems to have been a success, 
and I am satisfied that its application to the entire State, with 
the possible exception of Davidson and Shelby Counties, would 
improve the school system.
-P-A-G-E-31
—28— 
“Tf the present system of school directors is to be continued, 
some amendments to the law should be made, restricting their 
authority and fixing penalties for violation of the law. Under 
the present law they can use the school fund apportioned to: 
their district as they think best. This authority in many 
instances is exercised in such a way as to waste the fund by 
useless and extravagant expenditures. Thousands of dollars 
have been spent for useless charts, libraries, maps and other 
apparatus, and extravagant prices have been paid for these. It 
is necessary that they buy chalk, brooms, fuel and other 
necessary articles that are classed as “Incidentals,” but the right 
to buy apparatus, etc., should be restricted. 
“The act requiring County Superintendents to approve all 
warrants, except for teachers’ salaries, was intended as a check on 
directors, but the Supreme Court has decided that the statute is 
mandatory and that the Superintendent must sign all such 
warrants. I suggest that this law be so amended as to accom- 
plish the purpose intended, and that for the purchase of 
apparatus, etc., the additional approval of the County Chairman 
and County Court Clerk be required.” 
Graping oF Ruka ScHoots AND UNIFORM 
Course or Srupy. 
Chapter 182, Acts of 1891, provides that the course of study 
in the public schools of each county shall be graded, and that the 
system of promoting pupils through the several grades shall be 
prescribed by the County Superintendent thereof, in accordance 
with the general regulations of the State Superintendent. 
At the time of the passage of this act, the great difference in 
the length of school terms in the several counties and the 
difference in text books used in different parts of the State, made 
the preparation of a uniform graded course practically impossible. 
Since the passage of the Uniform Text-Book Law in 199, and 
the increase in the number of teachers’ institutes held under the 
direction of the State Superintendent, there is much more 
uniformity in the echools of the State, and the time has come 
when a uniform course of study should be provided. In the 
preparation of this course of study the aim should be: 
1. To supply a plain, practical and progressive outline, which, 
if followed carefully, will give the pupils a thorough knowledge
-P-A-G-E-32
—29— 
of the common school branches and secure a systematic develop- 
ment of their intellectual powers. 
2. To unify the work of teachers and superintendents 
throughout the State. 
3. To restrict the work of the schools to the common school 
branches. 
4, To simplify classification and regulate gradation and 
promotion, thereby making the work of the teacher lighter, but. 
more systematic and effective. 
5. To divide the entire course into definite portions so that a 
record of the progress and standing of each pupil may be pre- 
served, and the confusion and loss of time usually resulting from 
frequent changes of teachers avoided. 
The course should be so prepared as not to restrict too much 
the work and individuality of teachers and pupils. Many of 
our graded courses have gone too far, and by prescribing too 
many regulations and too minute directions discouraged individ- 
ual research and effort. The course of study for the schools of 
the State should be divided into periods of three months each, 
so as to adapt it to all counties. 
The preparation of this outline should not be left to the State 
Superintendent or any other one man, but to the State Board of 
Education or a committee of experienced teachers. 
Primary TEACHERS. 
The greatest need of our schools is more competent primary 
teachers. With small schools and short terms there was no in- 
ducement for competent persons to undertake this work, and as 
a natural result, the impression has prevailed in many sections 
that “anybody can teach a primary school.” Nothing could be 
farther from the truth. The best talent, broadest culture and 
most thorough professional training is needed for the primary 
grades. Training of the mind and faculties of the child requires 
as thorough training as does the treatment of the physical body. 
CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS. 
Much time and work of this department has been devoted to. 
urging consolidation of rural schools. There are yet too many 
small and inefficient schools. Without a very great increase in 
our school revenues, the small school cannot receive a sufficient.
-P-A-G-E-33
—30— 
amount to run a reasonable length of time or employ a compe- 
tent teacher. The law making school and civil districts coex- 
tensive fixed the minimum scholastic population for maintain- 
ing a school at seventy, except under certain conditions. In 
counties where this law has been closely observed there has been 
a marked improvement, both in the length of term and efficiency 
of the schools, Seventy scholastic population would give on a 
basis of the average per capita for the State about $150 a year. 
This would employ a teacher four months at $35 a month and 
leave $10 for incidental expenses. Jn fixing this as a minimum 
the Legislature certainly acted wisely. The establishment of 
schools with a less income should be discouraged. 
Reviston oF Pusric Scuoor Laws. 
Our present law was enacted in 1873, and nearly every General 
Assembly since that time has made one or more amendments to 
it. It now needs a general revision or codification so that the 
language and provisions may be made to harmonize more clearly. 
Tue UsIversiTy oF TENNESSEE. 
The State University should be the culmination of our educa- 
tional system and should afford to the youth of the State an op- 
portunity of acquiring a thorough and complete education in all 
branches of useful science, literature, art and technology. Our 
public school system should be so articulated and graded as to 
furnish a regular system of promotions from the first grade in 
the primary school through the university. 
Dr. Brown Ayers, the new President of the university, en- 
tered upon the discharge of his duties on September 1, and is 
proving a capable and efficient officer. The attendance is larger 
than for many years past. All the State scholarships are filled 
and there are a large nuwber of tuition students. 
The university deserves substantial recognition from the 
State, and it is earnestly hoped that the General Assembly will 
take steps to extend its usefulness and influence. 
Crry ScHoots. 
Every possible effort has been exerted to secure full and accu- 
rate reports of the schools controlled by special boards of educa- 
tion, and it is believed that the statistical tables herewith pre- 
sented are reliable.
-P-A-G-E-34
—31— 
Great advance has been made in the past few years by our 
city schools and the large increase in attendance, expenditures 
and valuation of property shown by this report shows the inter- 
est being taken by the cities of the State in public education. 
Preanopy CoLLEGE FoR TEACHERS. 
Attention is called to the report of the Peabody College for 
Teachers, submitted herewith: 
No institution in the South has done more for the cause of 
education than this college. Its graduates are scattered over the 
Southern States and are the leaders in educational thought. 
While this school is a college for the entire South it is also 
recognized as our State Normal School, and as such has received 
substantial aid from the State. 
The scholarships heretofore granted by the Peabody Board of 
Trustees have been withdrawn, but their appropriations for sal- 
aries and expenses is continued as heretofore. 
The Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund have now un- 
der consideration the disposition of the principal of that fund. 
The friends of the college at Nashville are hopeful of securing 
a large part of this as a permanent endowment for this school 
and the General Assembly will be asked to help. 
A special report and recommendation will be submitted to 
the Legislature by the President of the college, and it is confi- 
dently hoped and believed that it will receive favorable consid- 
eration by that body. 
CoycLusion. 
Iam under lasting obligations to you for your earnest sup- 
port and to the press and teachers of the State for their hearty 
cooperation. 
Very respectfully submitted,

Superintendent.

The Institute was not so largely attended this year as last 
year, yet the attendance was large enough to make a most suc- 
cessful institute. The St. Louis Exposition and the County 
Institutes cut the attendance down.

The instructors did excellent work. They were prompt in 
the discharge of every duty. 
The character of work done by the student body was far 
above the average work done in institutes. 
The examinations were very rigid and the papers were care- 
fully graded by the instructors. No. certificates were issued 
except to those who merited them. We exercised unusual care 
in issuing certificates. 
The instructors, in their work, endeavored to make the pede: 
gogical features of the branches taught prominent. 
The faculty desires to express its most yrateful appreciation 
of the financial support given by the Madison County Court, and 
by the City Board of Education.

STATE INSTITUTE, UNION CITY. 
June 6, Four Weeks. 
Sin—The Institute conducted at this place under your gener- 
al directions, beginning June 6 and closing July 1, was one of 
the very best ever held in Union City. 
Three years ago, when conducting my first Institute at this 
place, County Superintendent Moore called my attention to the 
woeful deficiency of many of his teachers in the subjects of Read- 
ing, Writing and Spelling; and insisted upon special stress be- 
ing placed upon these three very much neglected rudiments. 
Since that time, by emphasizing and magnifying their im- 
portance as well as giving special instruction in each of them, we 
feel that we have fanned a spark into a flame; that we have 
changed a dormant interest into a vital interest, and that we have 
created a desire on the part of the teachers who have attended 
our Institutes to hold these subjects, which lie at the very foun- 
dation of an education, in greater esteem than ever before. 
We do not wish to create the impression that any subject was 
neglected, or that all subjects required by the State were not of 
equal importance; or that careful attention was not bestowed on 
all subjects; but we do mean to create the impression that we 
have endeavored to lay a safe and sane foundation upon which 
the youth of our State may safely build. 
Professionalism is becoming more and more marked; the 
number of school libraries is steadily increasing, as is also the 
number of our teachers who read good school journals and such 
works as ‘Foundations of Education ;” “Theory and Practice of 
Teaching ;” “School Management;” ‘School Sanitation,” etc. 
To encourage this movement, Supt. Moore of Obion County is 
urging upon his County Directorate the advisability of adding 
one day’s pay to each teacher’s salary for every meeting attended 
during the school year. 
The one month we spend together each year in Institute 
work, while delightfully pleasant and profitable too, only serves 
to emphasize the urgent need of greater and more substantial aid 
from the State. We believe it would be veritable life insurance 
for our State to establish Normal Schools and conduct them

nine months, instead of one month as it is now doing; this little 
crumb of instruction flung from the State’s bountiful locker 
will no longer satisfy the sharpened appetite and increased desire 
of the mighty army of teachers for more; it will require the 
whole normal loaf, and to this measure every teacher who at. 
tended our Institute stands committed. 
We wish to assure you of our heartiest cooperation in your 
every undertaking for the improvement of our public school 
system. We feel your leadership in every line of educational 
work, and naturally look to you for the achievement of this most 
laudable undertaking, which, if successful, will mark the crown- 
ing feature of your administration. 
Attention is invited to the Secretary’s report herewith ap-

RESOLUTIONS, 
Resolutions adopted by the teachers of the State Institute 
held at Union City, June 20, 1904: 
“ Believing the education of the children of Tennessee to be a 
matter of greatest importance to the welfare of the State, and recog- 
nizing the need for improvement in our schools of all grades, and 
for their more liberal support, we, teachers of Tennessee, attend- 
ing the State Institute held at Union City, adopt the following 
resolutions and hereby.request our representatives in both houses 
of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee to give their 
support and influence to the enactment of such laws as will carry 
these resolutions into effect : 
. 1. Some counties being much less able to support their 
schools than other counties are, the State should contribute a 
larger amount from its treasury for the support of the public 
schools than it now contributes. We favor the levy of a State 
school tax of ten cents on each hundred dollars of taxable prop- 
erty,to be paid into the State treasury and distributed to the 
several counties on the basis of gchool population, as the interest 
on the school fund and the annual surplus are now distributed. 
“9. There is great need for at least three good normal 
schools, one in each grand division of the State, for training 
teachers for the primary and secondary schools, especially of 
villages and rural districts. The General Assembly should ap-
-P-A-G-E-120
—111— 
propriate from the surplus in the treasury such sum (probably 
about $100,000 a year) as may be necessary for the maintenance 
of these schools, and should enact the necessary laws for their 
government. 
“3. The full development of our public school system and 
all the material and spiritual interests of the State demand a 
more liberal support of our State University and an enlargement 
of its work, and, to this end, the General Assembly, at its next 
session, should appropriate to the University of Tennessee not 
less than $50,000 annually, in addition to all grants from the 
Federal Government and interest on Federal} funds. 
“4, We approve the efforts now being made for the recon- 
struction of the Peabody College at Nashville, in order that it 
may be made a teachers’ college of high grade for all in the 
South. The permanent location of such an institution in Ten- 
nessee cannot fail to be very helpful to all its educational 
interests. If the Peabody Board will agree to endow this school 
with a sum not less than $1,000,000, the General Assembly 
should enact such laws as may be necessary to make the present 
appropriation ($25,000 a year) permanent.

STATE INSTITUTE, DICKSON. 
June 6, Four Weeks. 
Sir—The statistical report of the Secretary, found below, will 
doubtless give you the information desired relative to the State 
Institute you so kindly located at Dickson. As Conductor of 
the Institute I desire, however, to make this supplemental 
report. I have been connected with State Institutes in Tennes- 
see fora number of years, and J do not hesitate to say this was 
the most satisfactory one I have ever witnessed. The work done 
by the large body of teachers was above the average. The 
entire time of the Institute was devoted to the work, and noth- 
ing allowed to interfere therewith. None but bona fide teachers 
were enrolled, and the attendance was remarkably regular and 
uniform, Very few came except to work and be benefited. 
Many of the teachers who were in attendance had previously 
taken the State work and held State certificates, but all of them, 
as per your instructions, took the examination again, and not a 
single certificate was renewed or otherwise issued, save upon 
satisfactory examination. 
It was unanimously agreed among the faculty that the State 
Institute examinations should be made more rigid, so that 
State certificates would mean more than they were beginning to 
mean in some sections of the State. How well we succeeded in 
this you may see from copies of the questions used, which I 
herewith submit for your inspection. 
Better helpers than Supt. J. B. Cummings, Supt. E. B. 
Wilson and Supt. W. C. Lawson were never appointed to an 
Institute. They are not only capable and efficient instructors, 
but tireless workers, who, at any sacrifice of self, were willing 
at all times to do anything in their power for the success of 
the Institute or the good of the individual teachers. 1 hereby 
express to you my thanks for furnishing such a faculty, and to 
them for invaluable assistance in making the Institute a 
success. Supt. P. L. Harned was with us two days, and delivered 
interesting and helpful lectures on the general status and some 
needed reforms in the public schools. His work was appreciated 
by the Institute. Miss Georgia Oliver, your special instructor
-P-A-G-E-122
—113-— 
in Primary methods, was with us several days and did excellent 
and much needed work. 
In conclusion, permit me to say that the County Court, which 
so generously contributed to the Institute financially, and the 
citizens of the county and town, and especially the teachers of 
the county, thoroughly appreciate your continued recognition of 
Dickson’s subperb accessibility and adaptability to summer 
tate Institute work, and thank you most cordially for locating 
the Institute in our midst. 
Very respectfully, 
T. B. Logetns, 
Conductor. 
Srr—The following report of the State Institute, conducted at 
Dickson, Tenn., from June 6 to July 1, 1904, is most respectfully 
submitted: 
The most cordial feeling existed throughout the Institute, 
not only among the individual members of the faculty, but 
between faculty and teachers, and also between the teachers and 
the citizens of the town. Dickson is an ideal place for a State 
Institute, and it was a common remark with the members of the 
Institute and visitors that no better place could have been 
selected in the State. The fine college buildings, the abundant 
shade, the inexhaustible supply of pure water, the height above 
the sea level, the cool breezes and the ample facilities and cheap 
rates of board make it most acceptable to teachers. 
The following work was assigned by the Conductor as soon 
as the faculty was announced and consulted: 
T. B. Loggins—Grammar, Physiology, Agriculture, Geology, 
Physics. 
E. B, Wilson—United States History, School Management, 
Geometry, Pedagogy. 
J. B. Cummings—Tennessee History, Arithmetic, Civil Gov- 
ernment, Bookkeeping. 
W. ©. Lawson—-Reading, Spelling, Geography, Rhetoric, 
Algebra.

STATE INSTITUTE, LEWISBURG, 
June 6, Four Weeks. 
Sir—The following brief report of the State Institute con- 
ducted at Lewisburg from June 6 to July 1, 1904, is most respect- 
fully submitted: 
Through your courtesy it was my privilege to conduct the 
Institute, and I trust that the interest manifested by the teachers 
who attended and the efforts put forth by those in charge have 
in some degree justified the confidence you reposed in me. Pro- 
fessors M. M. Summar, Fred J. Page, J. S. Batey, Supt. J. G. 
Stinson and Miss Ethel Northern were earnest and unaffected in 
their methods of instruction and won the attention of their classes 
by the interest manifested, the ability with which they bandled 
their respective subjects, and by the courtesy and genial spirit 
manifested toward every one in attendance. I cannot commend 
them too highly. They are all well up on their work, energetic, 
industrious and prompt. It was a genuine pleasure to have their 
cheerful and helpful cooperation. Prof. F. M. Massey was elected 
Chairman and Supt. J. G. Stinson, Secretary, and certainly each 
was the right man in the right place. 
It affords me very great pleasure to state further that the body 
of teachers in attendance manifested a very high degree of in- 
‘terest, were very attentive and respectful, and I feel sure that 
much good was done. A spirit of investigation and a strong de- 
sire for better preparation for their noble work was clearly mani- 
fested from beginning to end of the Institute. Lectures were 
delivered and quizzes conducted by the instructors on all the 
branches required to be taught in the primary and secondary 
schools of this State. Much attention was given to methods of 
teaching, especially by Miss Ethel Northern, who is a specialist 
on primary work. The Institute was highly honored and greatly 
benefited by lectures delivered by such distinguished visitors as 
Supt. P. P. Claxton of the Summer School of the South, Prof.

STATE INSTITUTE, HUNTINGDON, 
June 13, Four Weeks. 
Srr—I have the honor to submit to you my report as Con- 
ductor of the State Institute held under your direction at Hunt- 
ingdon, from June 18 to July 8, four weeks. 
The County Court of Carroll County liberally and almost 
unanimously, upon the application of the Conductor, County 
Superintendent Traywick and other citizens, appropriated suf- 
ficient funds to secure the school at Huntingdon, and by thorough 
advertising by circulars and letters the school was brought to the 
attention of the teachers from this part of the State, so that on 
opening day the chapel of the college building was filled. with 
teachers and their friends to take the work and to lend encour- 
agement to the cause. After remarks by the Conductor and 
each member of the faculty the following program was announced:

The entire plant of the Southern Normal University, includ- 
ing library, laboratory, ete., was turned over to the Institute 
and nothing was left undone by the school authorities and by 
the city of Huntingdon to make the Institute a success. 
More than twenty counties were represented in the enroll- 
ment. More than fifty of those in attendance were college grad- 
uates, holding diplomas from such colleges as Peabody College, 
Bethel College, Tennessee, Bethel College, Kentucky, Southern 
9
-P-A-G-E-139
—130— 
Normal University, National Normal University, Southwestern 
Baptist University, Carson and Newman College, Kentucky State 
Normal School, Ward Seminary, Boscobel College, G. R. C. Col- 
lege and others of like standing. This significant fact is worth 
more than a passing notice, in my opinion; it shows that our 
teachers and others are getting out of the idea that such schools 
are only organized for a four-weeks “cramming for examina- 
tion,” and that teachers, college graduates among the number, 
are waking up to the right idea of professional training. Thus 
they attend such schools to get training in methods and devices 
for better and more profitable use of their scholarship for the 
practical work of the school room. Great stress in the work of 
the Institute was put on the ‘‘How” and the “ Why” in the 
various texts, the method to be used, so as to best develop the 
children and to bring about knowledge through healthy intel- 
lectual growth. 
The improvement in the personnel of the teachers over last 
year was marked, and'there was especially significant the absence 
of the one who merely “draws his salary” and the professional 
“grumbler.” If they came they left before examinations came. 
‘Professionalism and love of the work characterized the entire 
body and it is believed that it will tell out most certainly in the 
next few years by the influence of these teachers for better things 
in their fields of labor, 
The instructors selected by you as my associates worked in 
perfect harmony with me and with each other ; they are all those 
of the “true spirit.” Certainly no Conductor of any one of the 
other State Institutes was more fortunate in his faculty than I. 
The Institute passed resolutions which are herewith attached 
as a part of this report. 
The examinations were made very rigid, even more so than 
last year, and those who received certificates merited them.

tion and of many of the distinguished men of our State, together 
witha profusion of flags and bunting, also furnished with organ 
and piano. Itindeed presented the appearance of an ideal school 
room.' 
The Institute was organized 6n Monday with a splendid at- - 
tendance. The faculty, composed of C. 8S. Douglass, Conductor; . 
Ed. Brugh, W. F. Albright and Miss Susie Finnegan, were on 
band ready forduty. Prof. Brugh was chosen secretary of faculty 
and Miss Lula Boone secretary of Institute. From the begin- 
ning it was remarked that the teachers meant business, and that 
the four weeks spent here would be oceupied in. faithful and 
profitable work and right well was the duty performed. At 10 
o’clock on the second day we were visited by many of our repre- 
sentative citizens, who welcomed us most royally, and two hours 
were spent in an educational love feast. The Mayor, Hon. J. W. 
Blackmore, in a very appropriate address, tendered us the keys 
of the city and the blessings and good will of its people. Prof. 
Brugh of the faculty responded. There were also good speeches 
from Messrs. Boddie, Seay, Morton, Baskerville and Collier, of 
the Gallatin Bar, who were followed by our ministerial brethren, 
Revs. Tucker, Burwell, Fisher, White, Webb and Payne, all of 
whom expressed deep interest in our work and lent much en- 
couragement to the profession. Of course these speeches were 
interspersed with music and song ard two good recitations from 
Misses Wooten and Oldham. 
We held one session daily, opening at 8:30 a. m. and closing at 
lp.m, There were enrolled 206 actual teachers; 17 days were 
given to Institute work and three days to examination. There
-P-A-G-E-145
—136— 
were no applicants for secondary work, hence only a primary 
class; 78 stood examination, 53 received certificates, 20 failed to 
make the required average and 5 passed examination who were 
notinattendance 15 days. We set apart special day for directors 
and State Superintendent, which proved to be a day of pleasure 
and profit. Supt. Mynders was especially happy in his discus. 
sion of the school question in all of its phases, and very wisely 
drew from the directors causes and results of the many troubles 
in their respective districts and in most cases gave safe and tried 
antidotes. 
We do truly thank Doctors L. M. Woodson, H. A. Holder and 
B. A. Williams for their several very interesting and instructive 
lectures in Physiology; also we would not forget the visits and 
speeches of Dr. Krohn, of Chicago, and Judge Allison, of Nashville. 
Truly may it be said of them that they are masters of their sub- 
jects. Nor can we be too grateful for the timely aid given us by 
Professors Chapman and. Wilson; indeed they are teachers in 
“spirit and in truth.” To the Committee on Correspondence- 
composed of Professors Chapman and McGlothlin and Misses 
Rutherford, Griffin and Barnet, also to Committee on Music, Misses 
Gilmore, Rutherford, Chenault, Harris and Brown, we would say 
that they discharged their duties well, and assuredly are entitled 
to the gratitude of the Institute. In conclusion we would assure 
Supt. Mynders that we are grateful to him for locating the Institute 
at Gallatin, also feel that it was a perfect success. Appreciate pro- 
foundly the strong and telling work that he is doing and trust 
that he will continue to go forward “still achieving, still pur- 
suing” until every vestige of ignorance is dispersed and our 
grand old State, educationally, “shall blossom as the rose.” 
Respectfully, 
C. 8. Douaiass, 
Conductor.

STATE INSTITUTE, DAYTON. 
June 20, Four Weeks. 
Sir—I have the honor to submit to you the report of the 
Peabody State Institute held under your direction at Dayton 
from June 20 to July 15, 1904. 
PLACE oF Mrgrine. 
There being no hall in any of the school buildings of Dayton 
large enough to accommodate the Institute all the sessions 
were held in the courthouse. One large court room and as 
many smaller rooms as were needed were placed at the disposal 
of Supt. Fred B..Frazier by the county authorities, and proved 
in many respects a very satisfactory arrangement. 
| ATTENDANCE. 
As shown by the statistical tables 107 teachers were enrolled, 
of whom 79 took the examinations. At the day sessions 268 
visitors were registered by the secretary. The average daily 
attendance of teachers was 79, of visitors about 30, many of 
the visitors being as regular in attendance as were the teachers. 
Rhea County has only about 60 licensed teachers; these were all 
enrolled. The-counties having the largest delegations were Rhea, 
Hamilton, Marion, McMinn, Meigs and Bradley. 
INTEREST. 
The local interest in the Institute could not have been 
excelled. Every week two or more night sessions were held, 
and every one was the occasion for a crowded house. Every 
citizen of Dayton was actively interested in the success of the 
Institute, and the local papers were more than generous in the 
notices given to it. The welcome addresses on the opening 
night by Judges McKenzie and Henry, Mayor Sherman and 
Superintendents Frazier and Stephens were more than verified 
by the abundant courtesy and hospitality shown the faculty and 
teachers. On “ Directors’ Day” every school director and justice 
of the peace in the county was present One of the best of the
-P-A-G-E-149
—140— 
evening entertainments was that’ given by Spring City talent. 
“Pikeville Night” was very enjoyable, as was also “ Dayton 
Night.” The Institute was put under obligation to the Dayton 
Coal & Iron Company for a visit to their mines and other 
properties on special cars, and to the Board of Trade for a 
banquet at one of the leading hotels. Superintendents Frazier 
and Stephens and Messrs. Allen, Godsey and others were 
eminently successful in the fete champetre which marked the 
closing night of the Institute. Resolutions asking that the 
Institute be again located in Dayton were unanimously adopted. 
Facurty axnp Work. 
That the work of the instructors appointed by you was satis- 
factory to the teachers is sufficiently attested by the resolutions 
adopted asking for the reappointment and return of the same 
faculty next year. It was regretted by all that Miss Chandler’s 
appointment was for only two weeks. Her work was of a supe- 
rior type, and will prove helpful and inspiring to all who heard 
her. Primary teaching is done or directly supervised by all who 
attend the Institute, and special attention should be given to 
this all-important part of the public school teacher’s service. 
Less time should be devoted in these annual meetings to reviews 
of the grammar school subjects and more should be given to the 
professional study, expression and interpretation of the primary 
branches. The examination papers of too many applicants show 
a lamentable deficiency in fundamentals, and this will continue 
until the teachers of teachers give to subjects the attention their 
relative importance demands. 
PERSONAL. 
Every one regretted that your duties in connection with the 
Text-Book Commission denied us the opportunity to hear one 
of your helpful educational addresses. Prof. P. P. Claxton spent 
one day with us to our delight, and Col. R. C. Cunningham, of 
Spring City; Prof. G. Clinton Hanna, Supt. J. C. Fooshee, C. K. 
Gallaher and others favored the Institute with talks on educa- 
tional topics. 
Respectfully submitted,

ReEsoLutions. 
Adopted by unanimous vote July 15, 1904. 
Wuereas, The school laws of Tennessee do not prohibit County 
Superintendents in counties of less than thirty thousand inhabi- 
tants from teaching while in office; and 
Wuerzas, During the sessions of the public schools the entire 
time and energy of the Superintendent should be devoted to
-P-A-G-E-153
—144— 
visiting the schools under his charge, to inspect their efficiencies 
or inefficiencies and to devise plans or means for their improve- 
ment; therefore be it 
Resolved, That we petition the Legislature to so amend sub- 
section 9a of section 9 of the school laws that ail County Super- 
intendents shall be prohibited from teaching during their terms 
of office, and that their salary shall be fixed at not less than $600. 
Realizing the great need of local taxation for public school 
purposes, be it therefore 
Resolved, First—T hat the Constitution be so amended as to per- 
mit civil districts to levy special taxes for the aforesaid purpose. 
Second—That we demand higher educational qualifications 
of teachers and that their salaries shall be fixed by law at not less 
than $35, to be increased according to efficiency and experience 
in teaching. : 
Wuerzas, We, the teachers of Tennessee, have found under 
the present system of school law in the State that the most igno- 
rant of the children are not being educated; and 
Wuereas, The safety of our State and nation will be jeopar- 
dized by this uneducated element; be it therefore 
Resolved, First—That we ask our Legislature to pass a law com- 
pelling parents or guardians to send their children to school 
during the entire school term in the district where they reside. 
Second—That some counties being much less able to support 
their schools than other counties, the State should contribute a 
larger amount from its treasury for the support of public schools 
than it now contributes. We favor the levy of a State school 
tax of 10 cents on each $100 of taxable property, to be paid into 
the State treasury and distributed to the several counties on the 
basis of school population, as the interest on the school fund and 
’ the annual surplus are now distributed. 
Third—That there is great need for at least three good normal 
schools, one in each grand division of the State, for training 
teachers for the primary and secondary schools, especially of 
villages and of rural districts The General Assembly should 
appropriate from the surplus in the treasury such sum (probably 
about $100,000'a year) as may be necessary for the maintenance 
of these schools, and should enact the necessary laws for their 
government. 
Fourth—That the full 11 development of our public school sys-
-P-A-G-E-154
—145— 
tem and all the material and spiritual interests of the State de- 
mand a more liberal support of our State University and an en- 
largement of its work, and to this end the General Assembly at 
its next session should appropriate to the University of Tennes- 
see not less than $50,000 annually in addition to all grants from 
the Federal Government and interest on Federal funds. 
Fifth—That we approve the efforts now being made for the 
reconstruction of the Peabody College at Nashville in order that 
it may be made a teachers’ college of high grade for all the. 
South. The permanent location of such an institution in Ten- 
nessee cannot fail to be very helpful to all its educational inter- 
ests. If the Peabody Board will agree to endow this school with 
asum not less than $1,000,000 the General Assembly should enact 
such laws as may be necessary to make the present appropriation 
($25,000 a year) permanent. :

STATE INSTITUTE, JONESBORO. 
" June 27, Four Weeks. 
Srr—I respectfully submit the following report of the State 
Institute held at Jonesboro, Tenn., from June 27 to July 22. 
The Institute met 10 a.m. June 27. An able and cordial ad- 
dress of welcome was delivered by the Hon. E.J. Baxter of Jones- 
boro. For two hours the Institute listened to able addresses on 
educational linés by leading educators. Work was announced 
for the following day by the different instructors and the Insti- 
tute was formally opened. This was the third State Institute 
held at Jonesboro and it was indeed a successful one. Our en- 
rollment was 145. We enrolled none except regular teachers who 
attended and took the work of the Institute. I never saw greater 
interest than that shown by those who took the work, and I 
never saw better work done. Instructors R. H. Watkins of 
Bristol, J. C. Fooshee of Dayton and 8. C: Brown of Jonesboro, 
were earnest and very proficient in their work, They are in- 
structors thoroughly capable, conscientious and enthusiastic. 
I cannot commend their work too highly. 
The work of the Institute was divided as follows: Samuel 
W. Sherrill, Conductor, Theory and Practice of Teaching, Physi- 
ology, Orthography and Reading; S. C. Brown, Secretary, Arith- 
metic, Algebra, Rhetoric and Bookkeeping ; R. H. Watkins, Phys- 
ics, English Grammar, Agriculture, Geometry ; J. C. Fooshee, 
Geography, Civil Government,.U. 8S. History, History of Ten- 
nessee, Geology of Tennessee. 
At the request of the teachers in attendance we had one session 
a day for the first three weeks. The afternoons were desired for 
study and I am glad to be able to say that this time was well 
_ occupied. 
The people of Jonesboro know how to entertain an Institute 
and they did everything in their power to make the stay of all 
pleasant. On the 4th of July we had a celebration and educa- 
tional rally. Atleast four thousand people were present. The 
educational speech of the day was delivered by the Hon. Samuel 
G. Heiskell of Knoxville, Tennessee. The day was indeed a 
success.
-P-A-G-E-156
—147— 
I beg leave to incorporate in my report the following passages 
from the resolutions adopted at the close of the Institute. (See 
resolutions.) Pardon me for saying in conclusion that I am sure 
our work at Jonesboro has accomplished much good. I wish to 
extend to you my sincere thanks for sending me to Jonesboro. 
I wish to express my hearty appreciation of the able services ren- 
dered by my colleagues in the work. 
Yours respectfully, 
8. W. SHERILL,

ure to all who are interested in educational matters; and 
Wuereas, The local authorities have spared no pains to make 
it a success in every particular; therefore, 
Resolved, First—That the heartfelt thanks of the Institute be 
tendered our most excellent State Superintendent, the Hon. S.

portunity of refreshing ourselves for the coming year’s work. 
Second—That we thank our broad-minded County Court for 
their liberality in appropriating $150 to assist in carrying on this 
work. 
Third—That we express to the Conductor, Supt. 8. W. Sher-

unbounded patience and untiring energy shown throughout their

every respect, and we petition the State Superintendent to send 
them among us again. 
Fourth—That we recommend to the Hon. S. A. Mynders that 
he again place the Institute at Jonesboro, pledging ourselves to do 
all in our power to make ita continued success, and pledging him

Fifth—That we thank the Board of Education of Jonesboro 
for the use of this building and furniture for our Institute. 
Sixth—That we thank the ministers and others for their en- 
couragement and kind words of advice. 
Seventh—That this has been the best Institute ever held in 
Jonesboro, and that we have derived therefrom abundance of 
practical knowledge, which will be of untold value to us and our 
pupils.

—153—~ 
STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED 
TEACHERS, COLUMBIA. 
June 13, Three Weeks. 
Srr—I have the honor to transmit to you my eighth annual 
report as Conductor of a State Institute. Without any desire to 
exaggerate, [can say that I consider this one of the best, if not 
the best Institute, it has been my privilege and honor to preside 
over. The earnestness, obedience, interest and determination of 
the teachers to derive the greatest benefit from this Institute; 
the feeling of friendship and cooperation of the colored people of 
Columbia; the activity and support of the local committee; the 
high character of the instruction given by my associate teachers 
in their classes, all lead me to believe that this Institute has 
been one of the best ever held in the State for colored teachers. 
The Institute was opened on the morning of June 18, A. T. 
Morrell, presiding. Prof. J. H. Kelly, Principal of the Columbia 
High School, welcomed the Institute to Columbia in a neatly 
prepared speech on the part of the teachers and was responded to 
by Prof. A. Thomas Hill. Rev. J. C. Lawrence welcomed the 
teachers in behalf of the pastors of the city and in his speech 
made an eloquent plea for race development and advancement. 
Prof. C. B. Lowe responded. Dr. T. W. Stephens welcomed the 
teachers in behalf of the physicians and professional men and a 
response was given by the Conductor. After these preliminaries 
the Institute was turned over to the faculty and the lessons for 
the second day’s work were assigned. The program below indi- 
cates the faculty and division of subjects. 
Cnorr. 
A very pleasing feature of the Institute was the good music 
furnished by the choir, a body of fourteen voices especially or- 
ganized and trained to furnish music for the Institute. Every 
class of music was rendered, sacred, secular, patriotic, and classic. 
Many times the Institute was inspired by listening to the mar- 
tial strains of our national airs.

Lectures, 
The Institute had the pleasure of listening to one of the most 
eloquent lectures that ever fell from the lips of one of their own 
race. Dr, James A. Davis, D. D., Presiding Elder of the Colum- 
bia District of the A. M. E. Church, delivered an address upon 
the subject: “ Progress of the Negro.” It was full of historical 
references, giving names, dates, places of birth and achievements 
of prominent negroes, which coupled with his natural eloquence 
captivated his audience and moved them to vote that the address 
be printed in pamphlet form and kept for general distribution. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The enrollment of the Institute, including the faculty and 
assistants, was 149. This isan excess over last year of 22. Nine 
counties of the State were represented—Maury, Bedford, Mar- 
shall, Davidson, Montgomery, Williamson, Giles, Lawrence and 
Shelby. This was very gratifying to the faculty, as it was thought 
that the attendance might possibly be less than last year, owing 
to the fact that at one time there was a possibility of the Institute 
being moved to another city. Other influences of a local nature, 
it was feared, might diminish the attendance, but the teachers 
rallied to the support of the faculty and the result was the largest 
enrollment ever recorded in the history of Maury County. Iam 
sure that no faculty could ask a stronger endorsement. 
Primary Meruops. 
The work of the teacher in this branch showed the same 
standard of excellence as Jast year. If any change was noticed, it 
was an improvement over the work of last year. The work in 
“Nature Study” and “ Movement Songs” was very acceptable to 
the teachers. ; 
Russ ror Examination. 
1. The examination will begin promptly at 9 o’clock each 
morning. 
2. Teachers will write their names only on the cards given 
them. 
8. No name of any teacher must appear on the examination . 
paper. 
4. Teachers will number their papers, using the same number 
as the card.
-P-A-G-E-164
~-155— 
5. Teachers will sit singly; one teacher at a desk. 
6. No communication; a violation of this rule forfeits the ex- 
amination. 
7. No consultation with visitors during the examination. 
8. A paper must be handed in for each subject, if only a blank. 
PusBLic ADDRESSES. 
The institute was visited by many persons prominent in the 
development of the race and some of them were given an oppor- 
tunity to address the Institute. Often a word from a strange 
face and from one who has traveled over the Stite, studying the 
condition of the negro in other localities and under different cir- 
cumstances, proves to be of more practical benefit than a regular 
lesson. With this thought in mind, the Conductor invited the 
following persons to address the Institute: Dr. Jas. A. Davis, 
Prof. S. H. Archer, Prof. W. H. Fort, Miss Nannie Perkins, Dr. 
J. P. Crawford, Dr. T. W. Stephens, Dr. A. T. Williamson, Rev. 
J.C. Lawrence, Rev. Owen and Miss A. R. Parminter. . 
CoMMITTEE OF FINANCE. 
Great thanks are due Rev. J. C. Lawrence, Prof. R. P. Purdy 
and Miss Q. V. Moore in looking after the financial interests of 
the Institute. Some obstacles had to be overcome; through their 
efforts, however, every indebtedness was promptly met. 
T cannot close this report without thanking you, both for my- 
self personally, and for my associates, for every act of kindness 
you have shown us and for the support you have so cordially 
given us, which has helped to lighten our burdens and make our 
work more pleasant. It is our wish that you may long live to 
enjoy the love and esteem of the people of Tennessee, and to 
adorn by your talents and virtues the office which you now so 
ably fill. : Very respectfully, 
F.G. Smirx, 
Conductor.

STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED 
TEACHERS, JACKSON. 
June 73, Four Weeks. 
Str—I have the honor to render to you a report of our Sum- 
mer Normal, known as Lane College Summer School and State 
Peabody Institute for Colored Teachers. The session opened 
June 18 and closed July 8. 
Tue How anp THE WHat. 
After sufficient test it was found that the teachers in attend- 
ance were in need of a more thorough knowledge of the subject 
matter to be taught as much as they stood in need of drill and 
how to present the subject matter. Accordingly the work 
proceeded along the line of a wise mixture of the how and the 
what. Teachers were given real class work to do, and in addition 
were required to present the same as teacher. . 
As Conductor of the Institute I commend the work done by 
the several instructors. Each instructor was one of experience 
and was well prepared in the special branches assigned him. 
Those who attended were loud in their praise of the work done.

Tue Instrrure AN Opsect Lesson. 
The Institute was conducted on the plan of a model school, 
that it might be an object lesson. The daily program as an- 
nounced was regularly carried out. Punctuality, promptness and 
regularity were at all times insisted upon. It was recognized 
that the living example of the:e things was worth much more 
than lectures alone. 
. Manvar Training, 
No part of the work done was attended with greater enthu- 
siasm than the manual training, At the beginning some were 
inclined to disregard it, probably because they did not know any 
thing of its value. When its practical value, both to the teacher 
and the pupil, was shown through articles made as many as fifty 
joined the class. Many teachers went to their homes wearing 
hats and belts and carrying baskets and other articles of value 
made in those four weeks by persons who had never used their 
hands in making such articles. This work as taught here can 
_be done in any city, village or rural school by pupils of all grades. 
The material for doing much of it can be secured in any com- 
munity free. Its educational value can be readily seen as can 
also its commercial value. 
Tue Desire FoR CERTIFICATES ONLY. 
It is apparent that many attend the summer institutes with 
one purpose and that is to secure a-certificate to teach. It was 
the policy of this Institute to minimize this as the sole purpose, 
and to magnify the idea of self-improvement for doing efficient. 
work in the field of education. 
Cuostxe EXERCISES. 
Appropriate exercises were held at the close of the Institute. 
The large attendance of citizens of the city of Jackson and vicin- 
ity demonstrated the amount of interest the Institute had engen- 
dered among those whom it was designed to benefit directly. 
The exercises were in the hands of the students of the Institute 
and were regarded as the graduating exercises of those who were 
to receive secondary certificates. At these exercises the Conduc- 
tor on behalf of the faculty awarded four Honor’Roll certificates.

Reso.vurions. 
1. We regard the summer school idea as a great blessing to 
educational workers ; and as educators it shall be our endeavor to 
avail ourselves of the privilege of attending some summer school 
each year. 
2. We heartily endorse the efforts put forth by Hon. 8. A. 
Mynders to establish teachers’ institutes in the several counties 
of the State of Tennessee. We believe such organizations will 
tend to encourage the best talent among teachers and will result 
in much good to the several communities in which such organi- 
zations may exist. As teachers of the State we shall lend our 
influence in helping to establish such institutes in our several 
counties. 
8. The location of the State Peabody Institute for Colored 
Teachers of West Tennessee at Lane College in the city of Jack- 
son appears to us a great blessing, both as regards the location 
and the special advantages offered by the college. We here 
express our appreciation to the Hon. Hu. C. Anderson, Mayor 
of the city of Jackson, for his kindly influence with the State 
Superintendent, Hon. 8. A. Mynders, in having the Institute 
located at this place. , 
4. We here express our endorsement of the work and meth. 
ods pursued in the Lane College Summer School and State Pea- 
body Institute. It shall be our endeavor to put into practice 
and enlarge upon what we have learned during this session. 
We go away inspifed to help in the betterment of our common 
schools, in which the vast majority of our people must secure all 
that it shall be their fortune to secure in the way of education.

EAST TENNESSEE INSTITUTE FOR 
COLORED STUDENTS. 
Sir—The third annual session of the Knoxville College Sum- 
mer School was held from June 28 to August 5, 1904. By au- 
thority of the State Superintendent this summer school was also. 
made the East Tennessee Institute for Colored Teachers. 
The session was a very successful one. It was expected that. 
the St. Louis Exposition would seriously interfere with the- 
attendance this year as many would feel that they could not 
attend both and they would not have another opportunity 
to attend the Exposition. The attendance of 115 showed the 
expectations were realized, but still the presence of more than 
100 earnest teachers made one of the most successful sessions that. 
we have had, in the work accomplished. In addition to the 115 
enrolled a great many attended the lectures who did not enroll. 
The faculty proved all that was expected of them. Faith- 
ful and earnest’ work was done by all. Prof. C. W. Cansler, 
Knoxville, had charge of Mathematics; Dr. J. B. Work, Knox- 
ville, Psychology and Pedagogy; Prof. T. J. Elder, Sandersville, 
Ga., Manual Training; Prof. H. W. Spencer, Knoxville, English 
and History; Miss E. C. Lapsley, Chattanooga, Reading, Drawing 
and Physical Culture; Miss L V. Childers, Knoxville, Music. ° 
The daily lecture feature was very remarkable. The fact that 
our summer school parallels the great Summer School of the 
South at the University of Tennessee and that the management 
cooperated most heartily in having the instructors and lecturers 
secured for their school come to ours. * 
The following well-known educators spoke on the Knoxville 
College platform : 
Prof. Geo. W. Carver, Tuskegee, Ala., daily lectures for ten 
days on Nature Study. 
Dr. C. B. Gregory, Superintendent Schools, Chelsea, Mass., 
one week of wonderfully helpful lectures on the Principles of 
Education. : 
Dr. W. H. Mace, of Syracuse University, course of three lec- 
tures on Methods in History. 
i
-P-A-G-E-171
—162— 
Dr. C. W. Dabney, President of University of Cincinnati, one 
lecture. 
Prof. P. P. Claxton, Superintendent of the Summer School of 
the South, one lecture on Methods in Teaching Reading. 
Prof. Sam. E, Hill, Superintendent Schools Knox County, 
one lecture. 
J. Campbell White, Pittsburg, Pa., course of three lectures on 
Missionary Work. 
Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, of the Boston School of Technology, 
one lecture. 
Mrs. E. J. Harwood, of the Boston School of Expression, two 
lectures. 
Miss Anna Williams, Superintendent of Kindergarten Work, 
Philadelphia, one lecture. 
Dr. Arnold P. Tompkins, Principal Chicago Normal School, 
one lecture. 
Dr. Chas. D. McIver, President Normal School. Greensboro, 
N. C., one lecture. 
Prof. G..R. McGee, Superintendent Schools, Jackson, Tenn., 
one lecture, 
The lectures were so arranged{that they did not interfere with 
the regular class room work. 
Great interest was manifested in the manual training. Card- 
board construction, knife work and basketry were taught. 
Respectfully submitted.

BENTON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the Annual Teachers’ Insti- 
tute of Benton County, which was held in Benton Seminary Col- 
lege at Camden, commencing Jume 6, and closing July 2, 1904. 
The Institute was under the supervision of the County Super- 
intendent as Conductor. 
Our enrollment reached 62 and had an average attendance 
of 50. The teachers were given a review in all the branches, and 
a course in Pedagogy. The books used were: MeMurry’s 
Method of Recitation and Elements of General Method, Ogden’s 
School Management and Page’s Theory and Practice. 
The teachers manifested a great interest and expressed them- 
selves as being highly pleased and pronounced it to be the best 
Institute we have ever had. 
More interest is being taken in edueation in this county than 
ever before. The publie school work this year has been the best 
and most successful of any in the educational history of the 
eounty. : 
We hold cur monthly teachers’ meetings on Saturday before 
the third Sunday in each month. We have at least one meeting 
in all the civil districts during the year, and every patron is 
urged to attend. McD. Neat, 
County Superintendent. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
The Annual Institute for Bledsoe County was one of the most 
interesting of recent years; nearly all the teachers were teachers 
who had taught, and this accounts for the fact that no teachers 
failed on examination. 
The work for the week was interesting from the beginning, 
and the grades of teachers showed greater educational progress 
than ever before.

BRADLEY COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my second annual report for the close of 
the fiscal year, 1904. The great up-stir and educational spirit 
that has been spreading over our State for the past two years 
has reached us with good results and better ones anticipated in 
the near future. In my visits to the rural schools I can see more 
interest manifested by the actions of the people than ever before 
in the history of education. They are becoming more reconciled. 
with consolidated schools. I am doing all that I am able to bring 
the people to a sense of their duty along the line of fewer and 
better schocls; better teachers and longer terms; more interest 
in the school work and of the nature for the upbuilding of the 
schools and education in general. I find opposition in every di- 
rection, yet I push on with renewed energy and a higher ambi- 
tion. 
1 am trying to de more for the schools of this county this year 
than has'ever been done before. I have been visiting schools 
daily, and especially where young teachers are employed. I find 
that many of the young teachers need help in many ways, and 
they can be very easily strengthened with a little help from older 
ones. It has never been the custom heretofore in my county to 
work exclusively in looking after the schools, but the County 
Court has been liberal enough to arrange for me to give my 
entire time to the work, and we hope to get good results, and will 
be satisfied with nothing but the very best that we are able to 
accomplish, We realize that it takes time to bring about the 
best results. Bradley County is entitled to as good schools as 
any county, and we are determined that she will be able to boast 
of her good schools in the near future and be second to none in 
the State. 
I have been doing all in my power to consolidate schools, and 
I am glad to say that I do not have so much opposition as I did 
six months ago. We have discontinued six schools and built four 
new houses this year, and are equipping them in the best styles, 
and others cannot be contcnted until more are constructed, which 
will be effected as soon as the present term closes. One good new 
house will be the cause of several others to be built. We will 
have more school days this year than any previous year.

CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Our Institute convened at Jacksboro on Monday, June 27, 
and closed July 7. The attendance was the best we have had for 
years, and in excellence of instruction, and in the manifest in- 
terest of the teachers present, the Normal was a pronounced 
success. In addition to the regular instruction given by Prof. 
M. M. Dossett, Prof. D. R. and Mrs. Case, Mrs. E. W. Newport 
and others, the teachers generally took an animated part in the 
discussion of the several subjects. This held the attention of the 
teachers, and greatly added to the interest of the routine work. 
Class work, in which the most vital points of the various 
branches were dwelt upon, and discussions of the problems that 
eonfront teachers, were the principal features of our Normal. 
While the work of all those who participated was of an exeellent 
order, the instructions of Prof. Case deserve special mention. 
His exhaustive knowledge of the school branches and his long 
experience in school work make him of great value in an Insti- 
tute. 
During the Normal the teachers and public were favored with 
two splendid addresses on education. On Wednesday, June 29, 
Hon. 8. G. Heiskell, of Knoxville, made a brilliant address to the 
teachers and a large audience of citizens in the court room. And 
on Tuesday evening Prof. John Thomas was heard in a delightful 
educational address. 
The Teaehers’ Association, organized last year, elected new 
officers, and a series of Institutes has been arranged. We intend 
to make this the best school year in our history.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
The Annnal Carroll County Teachers’ Institute was held in 
connection with the Peabody State Institute, which was held at 
Huntingdon, the county seat of Carroll County, June 13, to. 
July 8, 1904. The work was exactly the same in both Institutes, 
and there were only a few that did not take the State examina- 
tion. Some, however, were so situated that they found it impos- 
sible to attend fifteen days and were forced to apply for county 
certificates. The examination for county certificates was the 
same as the examination for State certificates, and was held on 
the same days. They were required to attend at least five days 
before they could become applicants for county certificates. Sev- 
enteen took the examination and twelve received certificates. 
I am proud to say that all of our teachers appreciated the 
high character of the State Institute, and most of them took ad- 
vantage of this opportunity and better qualified themselves for 
the duties of professional teaching. The Institute was a suc- 
cess in every particular, being the largest in the State, and the 
work has proved very effectual. The standard of teaching has 
been raised, and with it, the salaries of teachers have increased. 
The patrons are taking more interest, and therefore, the attend- 
ance has become greater and more regular. Our teachers have 
realized that Institute work is a vital necessity for their success 
in the school room, and that the time spent each year in a good 
’ Institute is more than repaid by better salaries, and by the ap- 
preciation of parents and students for good work done all over 
the county. 
I feel safe in saying that the interest in public education in 
Carroll County has greatly increased and that our teachers have 
gotten hold of the teaching spirit, and that they are more inter- 
ested and better appreciate the high profession of teaching than 
ever before. 
The faculty and division of work was the same as the State 
Institute. The enrollment and attendance was not kept separate.

County Superintendent.

CARTER COUNTY. 
The attendance at our Annual Institute this year was larger 
than ever known in the history of the county. About 90 per 
cent of the teachers of the county were present. To say that the 
work of Prof. J. E. Crouch in our Institute was entirely satis- 
factory to every one is a feeble way to express it. 
Our teachers are progressive and want to improve their con- 
dition, and show it by attending and taking part in the Institute 
work. We were disappointed because we did not get the State 
Peabody Institute, but hope to get it next year. 
Miss Rice, Principal Harold McCormick Institute, offered us 
the use of their building, which we gratefully accepted. The 
conveniences and accommodations were many and an enjoyable 
time was spent by all present. 
Our county is gradually advancing along the educational line. 
We succeeded in getting the County Court to levy 5 cents addi- 
tional school tax on $100 taxable property this year. One 
splendid new house was erected last year; one house was seated 
with patent desks last year, and I am glad to say that desks have 
just been received in the past few days for a house which I have 
tried for the last ten years to get seated with desks.

While our Institute was not so long as it has been formerly, 
it was the equal of any in the matter of interest and attendance. 
At the close of our session of one week this year, a resolution 
was adopted providing for a term of two weeks next-year, and 
for a regular monthly meeting during the present school term. 
In addition to the valuable services of some of our own teachers 
we had with us Mr. E. L. Roberts, of the Nashville schools, whose 
labors in our Institute were much appreciated.

County Superintendent, 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
The scholastic year-closing June 30, 1904, has been a very suc- 
cessful one, both in attendance and enthusiasm. The act making 
school and civil districts coextensive has been in operation the 
past year and its benefits are already being seen. Longer terms 
and larger attendance have been witnessed in most all the schools. 
The people highly commend the act and are working for the ad- 
vancement of the rural schools. . 
The Annual Institute for white teachers was held in the 
G. R. C. College building from July 4-9; 53 teachers were en- 
rolled and the program was profitably discussed from day to

day. I was ably assisted by J. W. Stewart, G. G. Butler, I. B. 
Day and others. It was the opinion of all that it was the best 
work ever done in the county. 
The colored Institute convened July 11 and continued one 
week. The attendance and work were good, and the teachers 
show quite a marked improvement in all the branches. 
Several schools of the county have established libraries, and 
the pupils are using them to advantage. The Teachers’ and Di- 
rectors’ Association have done much in their meetings to ad- 
vance the school interests. The teachers are active, energetic 
and rank among the best in the State. 
Cc. B. Isams, 
County Superintendent. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
Iam glad to note that our schools are in a much more pros- 
perous condition this year than last. We have a much better 
grade of teachers, some fewer schools, a few new houses and pros- 
pects for others, a generally increased interest in education, and 
bright hopes for a longer term, with a light increase in teachers’ 
salaries. I have already visited most of our 100 schools and find 
that comparatively satisfactory work is being done in most of 
them. A good deal of trouble was experienced in securing effi- 
cient teachers for this term—three examinations having been 
held with a few schools yet without teachers. 
There is great room for, and much need of improvement in 
our present school system in this county. More efficient and ex- 
perieneed teachers are needed. A larger enrollment, a higher 
per cent of attendance, and more suitable and comfortable houses 
are demanded as a means of more rapid advancement. We need, 
also,.2 more thorough and practical grading and classification 
of pupils and an inereased interest and cooperation on the part 
of parents. Both pupils and teachers should be better supplied 
with books, apparatus, ete. 
The Superintendent is working hard for the betterment of
-P-A-G-E-201

both teachers and pupils, and will hold in various parts of the 
county a number of teachers’ meetings, which parents and pupils 
are urged to attend. A school indebtedness of about $6,000 is 
almost all settled, and we hope soon to have a clean record, with 
nothing to retard our progress toward a higher standard of 
edueation. 
We had some discussions during spare moments at the ex- 
aminations.

CLAY COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Institute for Clay County met in the town of 
Celina, July 4, 1904, and closed July 12. The State not fur- 
nishing us any aid the great work devolved upon the teachers 
and County Superintendent, but I must say it closed with marked 
success. I am proud to say that the interest manifested in our 
Institute has been good, and I must acknowledge my thanks to 
W. B. Boyd, J. W. Wood, B. C. Ledbetter, E. P. Fowler, C. M. 
Copeland, Sam Birdwell and others for helping me to make the 
Institute what it was--‘‘a success.’’
-P-A-G-E-202
—187— 
I am endeavoring to remove what I have considered to be 
an obstacle in the way of education in my county by granting 
certificates only to such teachers as are thoroughly qualified to 
teach. As a result I feel safe in predicting we will have better 
schools this year than ever before. 
The people of Clay County are becoming more interested in 
the cause of education every year, and our schools are climbing 
step by step. Our motto is, onward and upward, and constant 
improvement. The question is often asked, ‘‘How can we create 
a school interest and maintain it among parents and pupils?’’ 
My answer is. ‘‘By good teaching.’’ 
-I will submit my annual report as soon as the Trustee makes 
his. We have brighter prospects for good schools this year than 
ever before, and we are hopeful of better results.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
I take great pleasure in reporting to you the work of the 
Coffee County Teachers’ Institute, which was held at Manchester, 
commencing June 27, and ending July 1, 1904. Prof. J. T. 
Ensey was re-elected chairman and Prof. 8. L. Phillips was re- 
elected secretary of the Institute. The program that had been 
previously arranged by the Executive Committee was carried 
out with energy and enthusiasm. A spirit of harmony prevailed 
during the Institute. The afternoons were devoted almost exclu- 
sively to discussions of school questions. 
A large crowd of visitors attended almost every meeting. A 
full account of our proceedings was published in the Manchester 
Times. 
‘We were very much disappointed on account of the State Su- 
perintendent failing to address the Institute on Thursday as had 
been announced, but were much pleased with the very able and 
helpful address made by Prof. Barrett, of Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, who came as a representative of Supt. S. A. Mynders.
-P-A-G-E-205

‘We expect to hold teachers’ meetings during the coming 
year in the different districts of the county. We have forty 
volumes in our teachers’ library, and will add several others 
this year. The outlook for better schools in Coffee County is 
favorable.

CROCKETT COUNTY. 
Our Institute was small in numbers, but of a most excellent 
quality. The work was done by our own teachers. Every 
teacher in attendance, except those having State certificates and 
the L. I. Degree from Peabody College, was examined. The 
teachers were as cheerful and lively as any set of teachers I 
ever had to deal with. A part of our county includes the early 
fruit and vegetable section, and many of our teachers have to 
supplement their teaching by raising berries, tomatoes, beans, 
corn, etc. The Institute comes on at a time when work of this 
kind has to be attended to or lost. This in part accounts for the 
small attendance at our Institute. Some of our teachers attended 
the State Institute at Jackson. Of course these were doing right, 
but this caused our County Institute to be rather small. 
‘We had a colored Institute near Alamo to continue a week, 
and it closed on July 1. Did very well; about 16 being in attend- 
ance—8 males and 8 females.

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
The Davidson County Annual Institute was held at the Fogg 
School Building, corner Spruce and Broad streets, Nashville, 
beginning August 1 and continuing two weeks. A membership 
fee of $i, previously paid by most of the teachers, furnished 
ample means to meet all expenses. Prof. John L. Wright, Prin- 
cipal of John Thomas School, Thirteenth District, acted as Con- 
duetor. A Primary and Secondary Course was conducted at the 
same time. 
Our Institute was held in August, with the hope that the 
teachers would become, to some extent, familiar with the new 
text books before the opening of the schools. We failed to get 
all the books. Most of the teachers attending had been elected to- 
positions. Our reading course examination had taken place. 
The certificates of those teachers whose work had been suc- 
cessful had been renewed. All other examinations had taken. 
place prior to this time. 
‘We enrolled 125. It was an earnest, working Institute, and a 
very successful one. Ex-Governor McMillin favored the Insti- 
tute with an address, ‘‘What to Read and How to Read It.’’ 
The address was a magnificent one and made a most profound. 
impression.

Our County Institute was not so well attended this year as 
last, there being a case of smallpox in town at the time of the 
Institute and many teachers were afraid to attend. The best of 
interest was taken by those who did attend. We acknowledge 
our indebtedness to our State Superintendent for the interest he 
has taken in our little county. We think our schools will open 
up with brighter prospects this year than ever before.

GIBSON COUNTY. 
T herewith submit for your consideration my annual report 
of the Gibson County Teachers’ Normal Institute, which met at 
the courthouse in Trenton on Monday morning, May 28, and 
closed June 2, 1904. 
The Institute was under the direct supervision of the County 
Superintendent as Conductor, who was ably assisted by the very 
best and mest progressive teachers of this county as instructors. 
In the selection cf instructors for the institute it was the pur- 
pose of the County Superintendent to secure those who would 
elevate and magnify the office of the teacher and give us broader 
views and higher conceptions of what true teaching means. 
Each instructor gave special directions as to the best methods of 
teaching his subjects. In each class principles, processes and the 
products of teaching, were thoroughly discussed. The instruc- 
tors recognized that teachers must know the ‘‘what,’’ the 
“‘when,’’ the ‘‘why’’ and the ‘‘how”’ of teaching any and every 
subject. 
The work of the Institute was eminently practical and purely 
professional, made so by giving each member of the Institute 
something pleasant and profitable to do daily. It was a working 
Institute, from which ‘‘glittering generalities,’’ ‘‘shoddy-show- 
off shams”’ for tickling the popular fancy were practically elimi- 
nated. Every effort possible was put forth to make the exercises 
pleasant and profitable alike to teachers and visitors of the In- 
stitute. A daily program was printed and carried out almost 
to the letter, thus rendering the work regular and systematic. 
As a result of these reforms the general public are beginning to 
regard the Institute a practical business educational institution, 
rather than an opportunity at public expense for the display of 
spread-eagle oratory, elecutionary pyrotechnics, instrumental 
esthetics, and vocal gymnastics. 
Dr. Baber, of Jackson, was a valuable visitor, and gave the 
Institute some excellent talks. Dr. Irby, of Jackson, also favored 
the Institute with an interesting address on Education. Some 
strong resolutions were adopted by the teachers commendatory 
of the present school administration.

GILES COUNTY. 
The Institute! I love to think of it. It isa pleasant memory. 
Life, energy, enthusiasm, zeal, all were strongly in evidence. 
We abolished the class room idea and all sat in same room— 
court room. JI may be wrong, but I feel that little can be done in 
two weeks towards the preparation of teachers regarding actual 
scholarships. This I claim must be had ere the teacher enters 
the Institute. Methods, school management, school law, interest 
in work, love for the profession, fraternity and a long pull and 
pull altogether, were some of the things aimed at by this Insti- 
tute and in which, in my humble judgment, we succeeded in some 
degree. 
One idea was to bring out the fullest discussion possible on all 
subjects discussed. This was accomplished in a marked degree 
by assigning one hour to each topic, and placing four teachers 
to the topic, allowing each ten minutes, and the other twenty 
minutes were allowed for discussion by any member of the In- 
stitute. The program was prepared a day ahead and teachers 
thereby given notice and time to prepare for their ten minutes 
say. This plan worked admirably in that it developed some of 
our otherwise timid and silent teachers into strong help in our 
work. No one was excused (except for good reason), indeed, it 
was rare that one asked to be excused. These ten minute talks 
were usually made by two young teachers followed by two older 
and more experienced ones, and many sharp and interesting 
clashes (always in best of humor) were had between the old and 
the new, rather, the young and old teachers. Old teachers were 
many times made to get out of the ruts and the young were as 
many times kept out of fads and fancies. If ‘‘in multiplicity of 
counsel there is wisdom’’ we had wisdom ever present with us. 
It was a common thing to see a dozen rise to ask privilege to 
discuss some mooted question. If ‘‘fools rush in where angels 
fear to tread,’’ then, we had fools, for we all rushed into many 
discussions concerning schools, children and their management. 
To my mind a vast deal of this interest was brought about by 
eight months terms and increased salaries. 
Beginning cighteen months ago with three teachers at our
-P-A-G-E-219
—204— 
first meeting, I think we will be pardoned for our pride in our 
active Institute, with 137 teachers. It was fortunate that we 
held our Institute in the courthouse for the room was crowded 
at each session, and many visitors dropped in and caught the 
inspiration of the teachers and went out to tell others. I believe 
I am safe in saying the people are aroused to a greater degree 
than for a number of years. 
We have-been enabled to consolidate in but two districts, but 
these are strong schools and will prove a valuable object lesson 
in the near future. I have raised the requirement for teachers 
and several have been dropped because of poor scholarship and 
failure to conduct schools successfully. Our dual system will 
retard and effectually block anything like transportation for 
many years. This is my honest opinion. The inability of the 
masses to see the advantage of consolidation is a miracle to me; 
however, they do not, and a ‘‘school at every man’s door’? is pre- 
ferred by them. Truthfully, there are many things to dishearten, 
and many things to encourage us. We acknowledge our weak- 
ness and the weakness of our system, but we shall persevere. 
We will bid you God speed in your noble efforts and promise you 
our untiring and unstinted, but feeble support.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The Grainger County Teachers’ Institute met at Rutledge 
July 11, 1904, and continued one week. The Institute was con- 
ducted by the County Superintendent and Prof. Sam R. Wester. 
of Madison Academy. 
There were a large number of teachers present during the 
week and all took a part in the Institute work. The interest 
manifested in primary work was more than usual. The primary 
branches were all discussed, and the teachers were urged to give 
special attention to primary teaching. 
Our schcols are not what they should be, but we are making 
some improvement each year. The term has been increased from 
three and one-half months to five months within the last few 
years. We have a better class of teachers now than ever before. 
The act making school districts and civil districts coextensive 
and cutting out small schools has been of help to our county. ? 
The school director system has been detrimental to our schools 
all along, but fewer directors now make it better. Our county 
would be better, educationally, if the Montgomery County school
-P-A-G-E-221
—206— 
law applied here. Our schools are all in progress now, and I 
have visited about one-half of them and find the interest of both 
teacher and pupil to be first rate. 
At our Institute in July we organized a loeal or district 
teachers’ association, which meets in each of the five districts at 
least once a month. We have held several mass meetings and 
find that the people are interested in the school work more than 
heretofore. There seems to be an educational spirit among all 
that has long been looked for here. I am well pleased with the 
progress we are making in Grainger County. Our teachers at- 
tend all Institutes, and their reports show that they are reading 
school journals and good works on teaching.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
The Annual Institute for Grundy and Marion Counties 
convened at Monteagle, Tenn., June 2, 1904, and continued in 
session two weeks. There were 85 teachers in attendance, this 
being the largest and most successful Institute in the history of 
the two counties. 
The teachers. were prepared to work as well as the instructors, 
and after the organization on the evening of June 2, the work 
progressed regularly and systematically. This was due to the 
fact that the Institute, and the work to be done during same, 
had been advertised, mapped out and plans discussed thoroughly 
before hand. When this is done the work is more than half 
completed. 
Prof. B. O. Duggan, of South Pittsburg, gave instruction in 
the following branches of study: \ Physiology, History, Civil 
Government and Spelling. 
Prof. W. G. Dillon, of Tracy City, taught the following 
branches: Algebra, Arithmetic, Grammar and Geography. 
Miss Virginia Johns, of Nashville, lectured on the following 
subjects: Language, Primary Work, Literature and Reading. 
All the work was of the very best, and the instructors are to 
be commended. The work of Miss Johns, who was sent us by 
the State Superintendent, should be especially mentioned. She 
has many friends and admirers among the teachers of these 
counties.
-P-A-G-E-223

Prof. G. C. Partin’s work, as Chairman, was invaluable. For 
running on exact time and keeping the best of order, Mr. Partin 
has no superior. 
The teachers of these two counties all join in extending 
thanks to State Supt. Mynders for the assistance rendered us. 
Many prominent educators addressed the Institute. Among 
them were Prof. Morgan, of Fayetteville; Dr. D. C. Kelley, of 
Nashville, and Dr. Du Bose, of Sewanee.

HAMILTON COUNTY. 
While educational conditions are by,no means ideal, we be- 
lieve that the attitude of the public toward our free school system 
is better by far than ever before. Parents’ meetings are being 
held in almost every community throughout the county, and some 
mothers’ clubs have already been organized, and we expect the 
organization of: many more before the present scholastic year 
shall have closed. These clubs discuss the needs of the school 
* from the community standpoint and aid wonderfully in develop- 
ing a School spirit and in unifying the community. One of these 
elubs presented the school at -its commenement this year with a 
$300 piano. Our school rooms are being decorated, and school 
sanitation is given more attention than ever before. 
You will notice that the average salary of our teachers is 
$45.09 per month this year as compared to $41.81, last, a gain of 
$3.28 per month over the preceding year. Next year’s re- 
port will. show fully as great a gain over this. The average 
length of the scholastic year is 145 days this year, as compared 
to 134 days last year. 
Our County Court at its term last April increased the school 
tax levy from 35 cents to 40 cents on the $100. This will pro- 
long our school term more than one-half month. 
We have been working most earnestly to consolidate the small 
rural schools. We have succeeded in eliminating seven of them 
during the present and past year, but there are a few more yet 
that should be combined ; however, at present we have an average 
of over 200 pupils belonging to each house. 
Our County Institute was the largest in the history of the 
county, there being 135 teachers in attendance. The instructors, 
Supt. 8. G. Gilbreath, of the Chattanooga schools, Miss Emily 
MeVea, of the University of Tennessee, and Miss May Andrews, 
of the Alabama State Normal College, all did a high type of 
work, and greatly benefited our teaching body. 
We need more thoroughly equipped and consecrated teachers 
and some method of regulating salaries according to qualifica- 
tions, experience and _ efficiency.

The Teachers’ Annual Institute, of Hardeman County, 
opened on June 20, 1904, with Prof. Terry Abernathy as Con- 
ductor. The Institute was one of the most successful ever held 
in this county. Miss Mary Myers, of Nashville, did some most 
excellent work in the primary department. 
The schools of the county are in a better condition than they 
have ever been; teachers’ salaries have been increased and the 
terms lengthened. Within the past year about twenty schools 
have been discontinued, representing a saving of about $3,000 
annual to the county.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
In our work this year nothing but methods of teaching were 
considered. We held our Institute in May instead of June as 
usual. Teachers seem more interested than usual in the work. 
Salaries are better than in the past. Our school terms are becont- 
ing longer. Our teachers are not yet what teachers should be, 
but our present short terms and poor salaries are not sufficient 
to enable a teacher to do his best. Under our present system 
schools are in better condition than they were when each school 
was a school district, yet are in great need of a more uniform 
system of schools for the whole county. A system like that of 
Montgomery County would cure many of the ills our schools are 
heir to. As it now is the County Superintendent has no voice 
in placing the teachers. A teacher who has made a failure for 
two or three school terms always manages to get a school in a 
new locality. If we had the Montgomery County plan the Su- 
perintendent could be of greater service in securing competent 
teachers. There is yet too much favoritism and nepotism in our 
schools. A county school board would eradicate much of this.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
The Hawkins County Institute for white teachers was held 
at MeMinn Academy in Rogersville from June 27 to July 5, 
1904. The Institute was conducted by the County Superintend- 
ent, with the assistance of Prof. H. B. Alexander, of Fayette- 
ville, and Mrs. Gennie Mynders, of Knoxville, Tenn., and was 
considered the most interesting and best attended Institute ever 
held in this county. Too much cannot be said of the valuable 
work of Prof. Alexander and Mrs. Mynders, whom you kindly
-P-A-G-E-232
—215— 
sent to assist us. We feel that they have infused new.life in our 
work. Prof. Alexander was a tireless worker, giving us many 
aids and devices in teaching and practical talks on school work. 
He won the admiration of teachers and visitors. 
Mrs. Mynders made her work quite interesting by teaching 
a class of beginners each morning, followed by an explanation 
of the work. At the close of the Institute the teachers passed 
resolutions requesting that Mrs. Mynders and Prof. Alexander 
be sent here again next year and expressing their appreciation of . 
their work, which was so helpful to all. : 
Supt. P. L. Harned, of Clarksville, visited our Institute and 
delivered an excellent address on the conditions and needs of 
our rural schools. 
The Colored Teachers’ Institute was held at Swift Memorial 
Institute from July 6 to 10, 1904, and was conducted by W. H. 
Franklin. Thirteen colored teachers were examined and cer- 
tificates were issued to twelve. 
I am satisfied we have better qualified teachers now than at 
any time since I have been Superintendent. A number of our 
leading citizens remarked during the Institute that we had the 
most intelligent looking bedy of teachers that had ever assem- 
pled at Rogersville. I know we are improving in the work of 
education in this county. We are building every year many new 
school houses and furnishing them with nice desks, ete. We 
have a nice balance of money on hand, which will enable us to 
pay our teachers at the end of each month this year. Hereto- 
fore our teachers have been compelled to wait five and six months 
for the payment of their salaries, and in some instances a year. 
I think our financial condition now will aid us in the improve- 
ment of our teaching force. 
We have better school directors now than formerly, and they 
“have raised the salaries of teachers. In conclusion, I wish to 
thank you for the assistance given me in my Institute work, and 
I assure you that I will do all in my power to further advance 
the schools of this county.

HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
I have not been connected with school work in Haywood 
County since June. The annual report was made by the new 
Superintendent, Mr. F. R. Ogilvie, of Brownsville. He held the 
July examination fer applicants for teachers’ certificates, so I 
cannot furnish you with any information regarding the result 
of that. The June examinations that I held were in reading 
course work, which was done by many white and nearly all col- 
ored teachers in the county. Owing to my absence part of the 
time, and the illness of eity teachers and consequent confusion 
in that school, I did not hold a County Institute. 
. EstELLE WALKER, 
County Superintendent. 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
The Institute was under the supervision of the County Su- 
perintendent as Conductor. Profs. J. 0. Brown and C. P. Pat- 
terson and Miss Hattie M. Hanna were employed as instructors. 
The Institute opened on the first day with much interest, which 
continued to grow until the close. 
All the teachers of the county were in attendance and gladly 
reponded to every duty assigned them. They gained valuable 
information from the instructors, who showed themselves masters 
of the situation. 
On the 23rd Dr. H. H. Cherry, of the Southern Normal Col- 
lege at Bowling Green, Ky., delivered two very able addresses 
before the. Institute. Dr. Cherry’s lectures were delivered with 
such magnetic power that they proved inspiring and uplifting 
to all. 
The number of school distriets in Henderson County has 
been reduced from 44 to 6. This change has created but little 
confusion, but has afforded better advantages in the supervision. 
The public school fund that is now in the treasury will run the
-P-A-G-E-235
—218— 
schools to an average term of seven months, notwithstanding the - 
teachers’ salary in every district has been increased. The out- 
look of our public schools is better than it has ever been before 
in the history of this county. The incompetent teacher has 
almost disappeared and good teachers are in charge of the 
schools. With this condition of affairs we feel assured that the 
best of educational success will soon dawn upon the people of 
Henderson County.

have 1,000 more children in school than at any time in the past,

and by far the best corps of teachers we have ever had. The

On the whole I am enthusiastic over the work being done in our

JAMES COUNTY. 
The thing we need most is good school houses furnished with 
comfortable seats. You will notice a shortage in the scholastic 
population of 158. This is due to the fact that many have left 
the rural districts and gone to the city where they could get 
better wages and have better school facilities. The way to check 
this is to improve our school building. 
The educational addresses delivered in our county by Hon. 
Charles W. Dabney, Hon. P. P. Claxton and our worthy State 
Superintendent were highly appieciated and have already done 
much good. : 
We want some form of compulsory law in this State, but not 
till we get better school buildings. We hope the Legislature will 
levy a building tax to be used for that purpose only for the next 
five years. . .

JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
Our regular Summer Institute, which convened here June 
27, to July 1, was not as large in attendance as former Institutes. 
This was due possibly to two causes. One was the summer school 
at Knoxville, and the other was to the fact that several of our 
schools have been eliminated by the operation of the new school 
law of 1903. 
What our Institute lacked in point of numbers was more than 
made up in the intelligence and enthusiasm of the teachers who 
were in attendance. There were quite a number of young teach- 
ers, who expect to enter upon the work of teaching for the first 
time this fall. This is the first time in the three years that I 
have been County Superintendent that there have been no fail- 
ures on examination. There has been a gradual improvement 
in the general intelligence and the personality of the teachers 
since I have been Superintendent in this county. 
One special feature of interest and encouragement was the 
organization of a reading club cirele in connection with our In- 
stitute work for the fall term. I was very much gratified with 
the enthusiasm with which the teachers entered upon this new 
field of preparation for their work.

The schools of Johnson County the past year, taking them

it has not been what it should have been, has been fairly satis-

very good.

The teachers. are taking a better interest in their work, and 
are reading good school journals and books on education. I 
held several educational mass meetings the past year, with good 
results. I am going to try to make this one of the banner years 
in education in Johnson County. 
In June we held a two weeks Institute and a two days ex- 
amination. It was conducted by Dr. W. S. Tindell, of Harriman, 
Tenn., and was one of the best Institutes we have ever had. The 
attendance and interest were above the average. At the close of 
the Institute the Johnson County Teachers’ Association was re- 
organized, with a good enrollment. The past year we profited by 
these meetings, and are expecting much better results this year |

KNOX COUNTY. 
In compliance with requirements of law, I herewith hand you 
annual report public schools of Knox County for scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1904, and most respectfully ask your careful 
consideration of the same. 
In preparing this report I was made to feel that the public 
schools of Knox County are steadily improving. The statistical 
tables herewith submitted, in comparison with similar tables of 
last year’s report, show that the advance in many particulars is 
not only pronouneed, but of such nature as to be decidedly en- 
couraging. It cannot be claimed that everything has moved on 
without hitch or failure; but viewing the situation as a whole, 
the results are pleasing, and it is fair to say that the year’s work 
was characterized by earnest, painstaking effort on the part of 
all engaged in the different departments. 
ScHoLastic PopuLation. 
The scholastic census as reported in July of this year is shown 
to be 27,437. This represents a gain of 2,168 over the census of 
last year, and shows that our community is enjoying the benefits 
of an unusual prosperous time. During the past year a new ~ 
trunk line railroad was built through this section; and as a re- 
sult our county is growing very rapidly in population, which of 
course means a great deal to the schools, both in point of finan- 
cial support and motive, and requirement of management. Of 
the increase in scholastic population, 1,041 belong to the city of 
Knoxville, and 1,127 to the rural districts. Due diligence was
-P-A-G-E-247
—228— 
exercised in taking the census, and it is believed to be as nearly 
correct as it is posible to make it. 
Leneto or Term. 
Comparing the average length of terms with last year, a gain 
of 19 days is found. This is regarded as a very hopeful sign, 
and gives evidence of the helpful influence which our educational 
leaders and recent legislation enactment have had over the school 
interests of the State. In view of the increase of the tax aggre- 
gate of our county, the inerease in scholastic population and the 
increase of State revenue we hope to report an average length of 
term for the county district (in this connection country schools 
are spoken of to the exclusion of city schools) of not less than 
eight months for next year. 
TEACHERS, QUALIFICATION, SALARIES, Ec. 
In the recent exarhinations held for the purpose of ascertain- 
ing the fitness and qualification of applicants for positions as 
teachers, I found that there is a perceptible increase in scholastic 
attainments on the part of candidates applying for the first time 
for teachers’ license. This is, indeed, encouraging. But more 
must be done. When we view the tremendous responsibilities 
which rest upon the teachers, and then think of the meagre quali- 
fication of many who are posing as teachers, we are filled with 
misgivings. ,There is another side. Pcorness of salary, short- 
ness of term service, insecurity of position, hindrance in the form 
of ignorant and inefficient boards of directors, all do not combine 
to attract good talent to the work of teaching, or cause the teach- 
ers attracted to seek better qualifications. 
The average salary for the year is $36.85. This represents 
a slight increase over last year; and taking the record for a 
number of years back, the ratio indicated by the increase of this 
year represents in fairly good way the rate by which we may 
measure our progress. It is sometimes a perplexing problem: 
Which must come first; the teacher with an appropriate salary 
or the salary with an appropriate teacher? At any rate the State 
needs to do something looking to the supply of an efficient teach- 
ing foree. As time goes by, the need becomes more and more 
urgent; it is folly to wait.

FINANCES. 
Closely identified with the questions of length of term and 
the salaries of teachers is the one of money. ‘In fact both are 
entirely dependent upon the latter. As can be seen from the 
financial report contained in table herewith accompanying, our 
gross receipts for the year, all sources, was $127,297.12. This 
amount gave each child more than $5, which accounts for the 
material increase in length of terms and the slight inerease in 
average salaries paid teachers. The money has been, for the 
most part, judiciously expended; as much so as can be expected 
from the system under which we operate—the fund ever sub- 
ject to the dispcsal of boards whose various conceptions of eco- 
nomical usage are often as varied as their knowledge and concep- 
tions of the qualifications of teachers and the purposes of schools. 
Some of these things are at strange varianee with efforts seeking 
to build a good school system. What think you of a fundamental 
change? 
ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The enrollment was 11,002. The year preceding was 10,529. 
A gain of 473. The average daily attendance for the year just 
closed was 6,686. The year preceding, 6,536. <A gain of 150. 
(These figures are for the rural districts.) Basing a eomputa- 
tion on the entire schclastic population of the rural districts, it is 
found that 69 per cent of the scholastic population was enrolled 
in school some time during the year, but only 42 per cent ef the 
entire scholastic population was in daily attendance. This one 
fact alone shows that our sehcols cannot do what they should. 
We need a remedy at the hands of the Legislature. It is impos- 
sible to make any considerable degree of progress when it is im- 
possible to have children attend with regularity. Of course, it 
may be claimed, and justly too, that the derelict teacher and the 
poor school is responsible; but there is responsibility resting at 
the door of many indifferent parents. and in justice to the com- 
munity, especially to the children, there ought to be measures 
enacted that would empower school authorities to compel parents 
to send their children to school.

Mass Meerines, Lysrirutrs anp Summer ScHoou. 
Early in the fall of last year a series of educational rallies 
were planned. In accord with the plans the work was carried 
to a most successful conclusion. Crowds from 500 to 2,000 came 
together to hear the discussion of educational topies. 
Some of the best speakers in our section gave their assistance. 
Among the list are the names of Ex-Gov. R. L. Taylor, Prof. 
P. P. Claxton, Col. George F. Milton, Capt. William Rule, Dr. 
C. W. Dabney, Prof. George Mellen, HE. T. Sanford, Esq., 8. G. 
Heiskell, Esq., Prof. S. G. Gilbreath and Capt. Frank M. Smith. 
Especially do we want to acknowledge a debt of gratitude to 
Prof. P. P. Claxton for the untiring interest which he showed in 
all of these meetings. His characteristic earnestness never 
abated. Surely a rich harvest shall follow these efforts. 
In addition to these mess meetings, the teachers, white and 
colored, through their respective association did a great deal of 
institute work. Regular class work was carried on throughout 
the year, and in this way genuine scholarly habits are eulti- 
vated and a professional spirit developed and kept alive. 
You are acquainted with the Summer Schcel of the South. 
Beginning June 28 and continuing six weeks, this famous school 
has just closed its third year in our midst. It is unnecessary to 
recount the many good things. This is not an institution fcr 
Knox County or for Tennessee; if you take the registration list, 
you will say it is a school for the world, and the names of the 
instruetors and the kind of work done are sufficient guarantee 
that the saying will prove acceptable. Knox County teachers 
attended this school and the work which they did was accepted 
in lieu of work which was formerly required at the County Insti- 
tute. The work there is of a much higher type than is possible 
to get in an institution of local nature. he presence of so many 
distinguished leaders has a wholesome influence upon the entire 
community, not to mention the inspiring effect upon the teachers. 
Knox County, Tennessee, all of it, has been greatly benefited by 
the Summer School of the South. .

zealous determination. Reports from schools already running 
indieate a large registration. In the recent election, fairly good 
selections were made for school direetors. With earnest teachers, 
cooperative school boards, and a reasonably good fund, we look 
forward, expecting substantial improvement at the end of the 
scholastie year, June 30, 1905. 
Wishing you full measure as a reward for all laudable efforts, 
this annual report is 
Respectfully submitted, 
Sam E. Hinz, 
County Superintendent. 
LAKE COUNTY. 
The schools of Lake County are confronted with several‘ad- 
verse natural conditions peculiar to geographical situation of the 
section. A large portion of the schools are interrupted during 
the winter and spring months by overflows from the Mississippi 
‘River. The cotton crop is also a serious factor in school attend- 
ance. The less well-to-do-people keep their children in the fields 
during the making and gathering of the crop, i. e., during the 
whole of spring and fall, thus causing the school term to be cut 
up, and the attendance to be irregular and spasmodic. 
These drawbacks are confined practically to. the tier - of 
counties along the western border of Tennessee. Moreover, the 
roads are probably worse during the winter months, here, than 
in the other counties of Tennessee. In spite of the foregoing the 
condition of educatiori in the county is encouraging. It has been 
our policy to consolidate and centralize the schools; to secure good 
- compensation for all earnest and competent teachers; to dis- 
courage all applicants not fitted for teaching, without fear or 
favor ; to build a substantial school house for every school in the 
county, and to build up a strong county high school, located so 
that all might derive benefit from it. 
Success has crowned our efforts along all these lines. Lake 
County pays her teachers a higher average salary than any other
-P-A-G-E-255
—232— 
in the State (barring the counties in which the four cities are 
located). Incompetent teachers have been thinned out and elimi- 
natd. Good houses have replaced shanties. The County High 
School, located at Tiptonville (the first one established in Ten- 
nessee under the High School Act), has ceased to be an experi- 
ment and has become an established part of the public school 
system. 
In view of the fact that a State Institute was held at Union 
City in the adjoining county of Obion, no Institute was held in 
Lake County this summer. 
R. C. Donaupson, 
County Superintendent. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
“Our white Institute met on June 6 and was in session one 
week. As our County Court makes no appropriation to meet the 
expenses of Institutes, I conducted the work myself, assisted by 
some of my teachers. Perhaps the work was none the less effi-. 
cient and interesting because it was ’*home-made.’? At any 
rate at the close we congratulated ourselves on having had the 
most interesting Institute we have held at all. 
The work was almost altogether along the line of the primary 
school course, and was in the main quite satisfactory. I think at- 
tendance on the Institute work should be an indispensable pre- 
requisite to the securing of a certificate. The white Institute 
lasted five days, followed by two days of examinations; 41 teach- 
ers were in attendance and 23 took the examination, 22 passing. 
Colored Institute was in session four days, followed by two 
days’ examination; 23 examined, 7 passed. 
The schools in this county are not coming up to my desires 
any more than they are up to my expectations. True, I think 
there is, all the time, some little improvement going on, but it is 
like the recovery of a typhid fever patient, so slow as to be almost 
imperceptible from day to day. I think I can safely say that the 
personnel of the teachers has improved considerably since I

eame into the superintendency of this county, eight years ago. 
But the two races will never come up to the same standard of ex- 
ecellence. (I mean the teachers of the races.) I think there 
should be a different educational standard established for the 
two races. And this would require uniform examinations 
throughout the State. I am not quite sure yet that I am in favor 
of that measure. There are some features which commend it 
very strongly and there are some objections to it. On the whole 
I think the reasons in its favor are in the preponderance. The 
greatest. drawback to our public school system is the system of 
directorship. This is so crude and ill managed that the public 
schools of Tennessee will never be a success till it is abolished. 
For instance: in this county there are eighteen separate and in- 
dependent educational boards. None know what the others are do- 
ing and they eare less. There is no uniformity of action, every- 
thing is going at haphazard; the business is transacted in an ir- 
regular, slipshod manner, and it is often the case that the money 
spent does not bring back all its value. Of course this is not 
_ always the case. Some of the directors take a lively interest in 
everything pertaining to the schools, and do their duty as well as 
if they were paid for it. It is not so much the fault of the men 
who fill the directorships, as of the system. The ‘Montgomery 
County Law’’ is the best antidote for the evils of which I com- 
plain. Let us have it at the next meeting of the Legislature. 
At least let it be applied to all counties having a certain popu- 
lation, say 15,000, or a certain scholastie population, say 4,000. 
Can you not prevail on a sufficient number of the members 
of the Legislature, who are not afraid that the displaced diree- 
tors will defeat them next time, to give us that, or, as the Popu- 
lists used to say by their pet scheme of the subtreasury, ‘‘some- 
thing better?’’ The Montgomery County law shall be my slogan 
henceforth. The pupils of the private schools were better edu- 
cated than those of the public schools are yet, but private schools 
are almost a thing of the past, and we must bring the public 
schools up to a higher state of efficiency or the country will 
suffer by the change. 
But ‘‘there’s a bright day coming bye and bye.’’ Give us 
the Montgomery County law, a compulsory edueation law, and an 
eight or nine months’ term of the public schools and Tennessee 
will take her rightful place near the head of the column.

LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
I am glad to report that we have just closed the best attended 
and most successful Institute ever held in this county. Prof. 
James E. Scobey, of Mount Pleasant, and Miss Meggie Robinson, 
of Nashville, were sent by Supt. Mynders to assist us, and the 
teachers were highly pleased with their work. Profs. Joe Sims, 
J. P. Conway and Roy Reynolds, also rendered valuable assist- 
ance. Special attention was given to theory and practice and 
school management, the teachers taking an active part in the dis- 
cussions on these subjects.
-P-A-G-E-260

It has been customary in this county to have difficult exami- 
nations, but the grading would be done in such a liberal way 
that there were generally few failures. I decided to make the ex- 
aminations practical and to grade to the point. After spending 
several hours in preparing the questions, I presented them to the 
instructors for their approval. The only criticism they offered 
was that they were ‘‘not as difficult as they should be.’’ The 
grading was done by a committee, the members of which were 
instructors in the Institute. No favoritism was shown. About 
33 1-3 per cent of the applicants failed to make an average grade 
of 75 per cent. (I gave 10 per cent eredits for perfect attend- 
ance.) It is my opinion that if a teacher cannot answer a few 
easy and practical questions on the subjects required in our 
public schools, he does not deserve a certificate, no matter how 
much experience he may have had. 
I was elected Superintendent of this county in January, 1903, 
when I was only 21 years old. I am doing and intend to do all I 
can for the schools of the county. I have taken a great interest in 
studying the history of the schools of the State, and I think that 
Capt. Mynders has done more to promote their general welfare 
than any of his predecesors. JI sincerely hope that he may be re- 
appointed. .

The Loudon County Institute of 1904 was very successful 
and very instruetive. Much interest was manifested by all of our 
teachers and they went back to their homes and their schools 
with new ambitions, new determinations and increased knowl- 
edge. To their credit we would say that those few who did not 
attend the whole time were very attentive, industrious and stu- 
dious, and showed that they were possessed with much of the 
spirit of the teacher.

Our county is moving along slowly. She is not doing all she 
could do, but she is doing more now than she has done in the past. 
Lenoir City, our largest town, has a school that must be called 
first class in every respect. The building is modern, of recent 
erection, very commodious and handsome. There is a sp.endid 
staff of teachers and under Prof. J. P. Griffiths much good work 
is being done. 
Philadelphia, also, owing to the public spirit and intelligence 
of its citizens, maintains an excellent secondary school. Under 
the leadership of Miss Huey this school is making rapid strides. 
There are several first class rural schools in the county ably 
taught by some of our very best teachers. 
All in all, I feel we are forging ahead and can safely say that 
the day is breaking.

McNAIRY COUNTY. 
It is with pleasure that I am permitted to say that the schools 
of McNairy County are showing signs of improvement. During 
the year several old buildings have been torn down and new ones 
erected. The number of summer schools is decreasing, and the 
winter terms are being lengthened by supplementing the public 
fund with private subscriptions. It seems to me that more 
teachers are entering upon the work as a profession than ever 
before, and with the problem of fewer schools and an adequate 
school fund solved, it is my opinion that the standard will 
compare favorably with the standard for teachers in any of our 
Southern States. 
Our County Institute was well attended. It began June 27, 
and continued one week, including examinations. Quite a num- 
ber of teachers were licensed without examination this year, 
they having made an average of 90 last year, and attended the 
Institute regularly this year, and filed their abstracts with me.
-P-A-G-E-268
. —243— 
JI am indebted to the teachers of McNairy County for their will- 
ing service in our Institute work, and especially am I grateful 
to Hon. Will K. Abernathy, Profs. H. J. Cox, L. W. Ellis and 
J. D. Mullins. Harry Hodges, J. A. Houston and Frank Lock 
composed the faculty. 
I think I see in the future a better system for our schools. 
With a uniform examination for teachers; with the powers of 
the County Superintendents enlarged, and a salary sufficient to 
enable them to devote their whole time to the work, I should have 
great hope for a marked advancement of our rural schools within 
the next two years. TrRRY ABERNATHY, 
County Superintendent. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
The condition of public schools of Madison County is not 
satisfactory owing, I suppose somewhat, to want of proper at- 
tention of County Superintendent. 
If you will allow me to advise of needed legislation, namely : 
wipe out all school directors; give a county school board of not 
more than six competent school men, presided over and con- 
trolled by County Superintendent, with full power of control 
over schools. Have this law enacted and it will cure the many 
evils so prominent now. 
No Institute was. held by County Superintendent. Nearly 
all of teachers attended State Normal held in Jackson for 30 
days. ‘W. M. Wuarton, 
County Superintendent. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
I am sending you herewith my annual report of the public 
schools of Marshall County for the scholastic year ending June 
30, 1904. The school year has been a very successful one, and

—244— 
I am well pleased with results. Never before in the history of 
the public school system of the county has there been such in- 
terest manifested on the part, not only of teachers, but the publie 
generally. 
In addition to our monthly Institutes, which were largely at- 
tended during the year, we had two educational rallies in the 
eounty, attended by 800 to 1,000 of our best people. 
The State Peabody Institute held at Lewisburg during the 
month of June, a report of which will be made by Prof. W. N. 
Billingsley, the Conductor of the Institute, was a success in every 
respect. The faculty was an exceptionably strong one. The 
student body, consisting of 178 actual teachers, representing nine 
counties, were the best. J. G. STINSON,

  Enclosed please find report of Colored State Institute at Col- 
umbia, June-July, 1904. The ‘‘ins’”’ thought it was fine; the 
“‘outs’’ otherwise, as usual. The faculty ‘“‘swapped work,’’ ex- 
cept Miss Trimble, who did so well in primary work that it was 
left entirely to her. 
A good deal of enthusiasm was manifested, both in attend- 
ance, close work and social enjoyment with the faculty and each 
other. The Maury County Teachers’ Institute decided to have 
an Institute at each of their monthly meetings and did some ex- 
cellent work on various subjects of school work. 
One thing has interfered somewhat with our work. In the 
past year we have had three organizations. First: 37 school 
districts and 111 school directors. Second: 25 school districts 
and 75 school directors. Third: 9 school districts and 27 school 
directors. This has caused considerable confusion, but we are 
doing better now. We are strong for a county system like 
Montgomery County instead of a district system. Also for a 
uniform State examination of teachers. Finally for the adjust- 
ment of the time of service of County Superintendents, and their 
pay in proportion to the work they do.

MEIGS COUNTY. ° 
You will please find enclosed my annual report of the public 
schools of Meigs County. I have put forth special effort to make 
this report accurate and I think that in the main it is so. 
Our regular Annual Institute was put off this year until after 
the close of the State Institute at Dayton, so as to give every 
teacher in the county an opportunity to attend the same, and 1 
am very glad to say that quite a number did attend. I was in at- 
tendance several days myself and can conscientiously say that 
it was one of the best State Institutes ever held in this part of the 
State. 
The Annual Institute for this county was held during the 
week beginning July 18, at Decatur. There were about 40 teach- 
ers and visitors in attendance. I consider it as being a vers 
profitable Institute in every respect. Profs. J. G. Paul and W. F. 
Grubb, both of Peabody Normal College, assisted me in the work. 
Special attention was given to the discussion of pedagogical 
questions and instructions along the line of theory and practice 
of teaching. Two hours each day were devoted to examinations, 
and at the close of the Institute thirty-two certificates were 
issued. 
It is not my intention to appear overly optimistic in regard 
to the educational affairs of this county, but I believe that I can 
conservatively say that the educational affairs of this county 
are still progressive. We are not by any means what we ought 
to be, but with the organized endeavors which are being put forth ~ 
at the present time I believe there will eventually be great im- 
provements in the educational conditions of this county. 
Our county high school is a great source of uplift and I be- 
lieve it will furnish a good leverage for making all the other 
schools of the county better. Meigs County is quite small, but I 
believe it has the honor of being one among the first counties of 
the State to establish a county high school. The session last year, 
with Prof. J. S. Ziegler as principal, was very successful. You 
will note in my report that five received high school diplomas, 
and if I am not misinformed, these are the first high school diplo- 
mas that have ever been issued by the State.

At a recent meeting of the County Board of Education I 
was elected as principal of the High School and since my election 
I have been putting forth special effort to secure harmony and 
organization among the citizens of the county in behalf of this 
school, as I regard it as the most hopeful prospect for educa- 
tional conditions. ‘Two splendid assistants have been selected 
to assist me, as well as a first class music teacher for our music 
department. So the ‘‘signs of the times’’ are very hopeful. 
At our County Institute the teachers unanimously adopted the 
following resolution: Resolved, that we, the teachers of Meigs 
County, in Institute assembled at Decatur, do wish to assert our- 
selves as being heartily in sympathy with the County Court of 
this county in establishing a edunty high school. We pledge 
ourselves to support and cooperate in every way possible for the 
upbuilding of this school.’’ 
It shall be my very earnest endeavor to not only make this 
school a success but also to make it instrumental in systematiz- 
ing, organizing and properly grading all the publie schools of. the 
county. I sincerely hope I shall be able, so long as it shall re- 
main my honor, to submit to you more favorable reports from 
year to year. ‘ C. K. Ganuaur, .

MONROE COUNTY. 
I herewith send you my annual report of the schools of Mon- 
roe County for the year ending June 30, 1904. One year ago I 
stated to you that our schools had been on the decline for a num- 
ber of years. I can now state that the interest now manifested 
in them is perceptibly on the inerease. The signs are more en- 
couraging. : 
The enforcement of the Seventy Population Act is confront- 
ing stubborn opposition. Every community clamors against the 
abolishing of its own school, however insignificant that school 
may be. The directors are inclined to yield to the popular de- 
mand.- But let the law be wisely enforeed.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
In submitting my annual report of the public schools of Mont- 
gomery County, I beg to call your attention to the very satis- 
factory increase in the term, enrollment and daily attendance— 
the results of careful and judicious management on the part of 
the County Board of Education, and the cooperation and faith- 
ful efforts of the teachers of the county. 
Without additional funds or reducing the average salary of 
the teachers, the rural schools were run 159 days, 21 days longer 
than ever before. Besides this there were more necessary build- 
ing and repairs than usual, which required more than ordinary 
yearly appropriation for that purpose. ° 
Last year, in nearly every district of the county, measles and 
whoopingcough raged and we really expeeted a reduction in the 
average daily attendance, but the enrollment and the daily at- 
tendance were increased 647 and 391, respectively, notwithstand- 
ing the loss of 559 scholastic population. 
The longer term is permanent under the mangement of the 
County Board of Education. It will be eight months a year so 
long as the tax levy and collection for school purposes are what 
they now are, and the additional money coming from the State 
will be used to increase the teachers’ salaries in order to employ 
none but the real teacher for every community. 
It is also gratifying to report that our teachers find much 
more convenience in the county system and are giving it their 
unqualified endorsement. It has done everything claimed for 
the system and even more. All the schools open the same day,
-P-A-G-E-275
—250— 
run the same number of days and close with.a uniform exami- 
nation for the promotion of pupils on the same day. Hence, 
for the first time, the teachers are able to work a uniform course 
of study. 
After one year’s work under a county system, it has been 
demonstrated that a judicious use of the school funds already 
provided is the equivalent of an increase levy of 1214 per cent 
of the total amount of school tax collected. 
The Annual Institutes, as usual, were well attended and much 
good has come from them. We are grateful to you for sending 
Mr. J. L. Brooks, of Jackson, Tenn., as one of the instructors.’ 
He, together with Messrs. J. G. Rollow, W. (L. Lawrence, W. I. 
Harper and J. H. Wardroper, of this county, did most satisfac- 
tory work. The Institute for colored teachers continued but one 
week, but was not lacking in, good attendance and interest. 
The membership of the County Teachers’ Association in- 
ereased during the year and more satisfactory work has been 
done by these organizations. The white teachers meet on the sec- 
ond and the colored teachers the first Saturday of each month. 
The teachers, members of the board and the citizens of the 
county, are indebted to you and Prof. Wharton Jones for your 
able addresses June 2. These gave useful advice and suggestions 
and new life to the effort of all who are truly interested in the 
welfare of the people and their institutions.

MOORE COUNTY. 
The Moore County Teachers’ Institute held its sixteenth an- 
nual session at the Normal Academy, Lynchburg, beginning 
Monday, June 20, 1904, and continuing one week. Much enthu- 
siasm was manifested by the teachers in this meeting. 
Prof. W. V. Freiley, of Burritt College, rendered valuable 
assistance in mathematies and physics. The work of the county 
teachers, Miss Mary Record in Physiology, Miss Mary Boone in
-P-A-G-E-276
—251— 
History of Tennessee, Miss Janye Floyd in Reading and Orthog- 
raphy, and Prof. Sion T. Record in American History, was very 
ereditable. 
Plans, Methods of Teaching and School Management were dis- 
cussed each day. Our teachers are becoming more professional 
in their work. Monthly meetings of the teachers will be held in 
different sections of the county during the school term. By 
these meetings we hope to awaken a greater interest in education 
all over the county and to promote the good of the schools gen- 
erally. 
Entertaining and instructive lectures were delivered during 
our Institute by Profs. R. K. Morgan, of Fayetteville, H. Peoples, 
of Franklin, ‘and G. Clinton Hanna, of Shelbyville.

MORGAN COUNTY 
Better school houses, better teachers, better salaries and a 
longer term of school, has been the ery for the last few years 
among the people interested in education throughout East Ten- 
nessee. In Morgan County it must be admitted that we are in 
need of some of these things at least. That we ought to have 
longer terms of school cannot be denied by any one, and yet 
public sentiment is not strongly enough in favor of it to demand 
it. Parents generally throughout the county are negligent about 
patronizing the schools during the short time they are in session, 
which fact is discouraging to those in charge of the schools and 
to those who have the power to increase our school fund. Teach- 
ers are more alert and active now than they have been for a few 
years, and their educational qualifications are better, but if 
Morgan County hopes to keep her best teachers she must offer 
them more inducement to stay here. It isa reasonable conclusion 
that a proficient teacher is not willing to contract for a three or
-P-A-G-E-278
—253— 
four months’ school, and that in a community where the people 
are indifferent as to whether they have even that long a term, 
when there are greater inducements elsewhere. This is not so 
throughout the entire county, but generally it is true. 
If our natural resources were not so great we could not be 
censured so much for the condition of our schools. Last year 
there was taxable property to the amount of $2,345,168 in the 
county, of which $1,678,058 was owned outside the county. The 
total amount of school funds received for the year was $13,297.48, 
of which $9,614.56 was collected from State and county levy; 
$1,921.81 from State; privileges and all other sources furnished 
$1,761.11. The scholastic population was 3,869, and the pro rata 
$2.50. This gave us only an average of 77.54 days of school, with 
an average salary for teachers of $35.20 per month. Of the 3,869 
pupils the enrollment was 2,550, and the average daily attend- 
ance only 1,499. It is plainly to be seen that some of them 
never entered ‘the schoolhouse door, and not half of them 
attended half of the 77 days which were open to them out of 365. 
Can we ever hope to see the young men and women, the boys 
and girls, of Morgan County come to the front under such con- 
ditions? 
The chances for an education of a great many of our young 
people end with the public schools, and itis our duty to give to 
them all we can up to the time they reach the age limit. You 
will admit that the situation is grave, and it will never be any 
better if we just lament over these deplorable facts without try- 
ing to remedy them. Before any move can be made for advance- 
ment the public must be in sympathy with it. 
Under Section 40 of the School Law, the County Court shall 
levy an additional tax sufficient to keep up the public schools 
for a period of five months, or shall submit the proposition to a 
vote of the people, and the County Court may levy enough to 
prolong them beyond that time. An increased levy of 5 cents, 
making the total levy for school purposes 40 cents (and we are 
allowed to make it 60 cents), would prolung our schools to five 
months, if the Boards of Directors would exercise the necessary 
precaution in disposing of it. Their first step toward this would 
be to consolidate the schools. During the school year of 1903 
there were 51 white schools in the county. This year that 
number was reduced to 44, and ought to have been reduced to 
31, in compliance with the School Law, Acts of 1903. If this
-P-A-G-E-279
—254— 
was done the county would be self-supporting so far as teachers 
are concerned, for there is now a larger percentage of bona fide 
Morgan County teachers in charge of the public schools than 
heretofore.

Our State Institute was characterized by an earnest effort 
on the part of the pupils to properly appreciate and appropriate 
the instructions of the faculty. It was indeed gratifying to. be 
a member of an Institute when such perfect harmony existed 
and where loyalty to duty seemed to be the motto from which no 
one deviated. The lack of levity and dishonesty was an inspir- 
ing feature of our Institute. In my feeble way I wish to ex- 
press to our State Superintendent my gratitude for the positive 
good he is contributing to the personal interest of Tennessee’s 
children. ‘The faculty given me was highly appreciated by all 
the members of our Institute. We hope to be honored in the 
future as in the past by having one of the State Institutes at

OVERTON COUNTY. 
The educational interest of Overton County is slowly im- 
proving and the interest manifested by the people seems to be 
getting better, but we need something done to cause a greater 
interest and a more united effort on the part of every one 
concerned. I have visited the schools of my county for four 
years in succession and have studied the need of each one of 
them in their present condition, and I fully realize that there are 
some necessaries that must be supplied before the schools of the 
county can be what they should be, and they are as follows: 
First—We intend to build a number of suitable school 
houses in which children can be properly taken care of. Until
-P-A-G-E-282
—257— 
this is done we need not and ought not to expect the attend- 
ance to be what it should be. While there are a few good houses 
being built, yet comparatively speaking there is none what it 
should be. 
Second—We intend to have more school money that we 
may be able to have longer terms of schools and pay better 
prices to teachers, 
Third—We need more trained teachers, and this we will never 
be able to have until we get better houses and pay better prices. 
I don’t say this meaning to cast any reflection on. the teachers 
of Overton County. I know that we have as well qualified and 
as conscientious corps of teachers as any county in the State that 
does not offer its teachers better advantages than we do ours.

PERRY COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Institute for Perry County was opened June 
27, and closed July 2. The Institute was conducted by Prof. 
A. F. Aydelott, of Centreville, Tenn., who was ably assisted by 
Profs. A. H. Wiggs, J. A. Sisco, L. F. Marshall and C. 8. Austin 
of our local teaching force. There were. several able educators 
from adjacent counties, who paid us visits and took active in- 
terest in the work. 
To say the Institute was a success would be putting it in very 
mild terms. The people of the surrounding country, as well as 
the town of Linden, took a very active interest from the begin- 
ning. More than half of the school directors visited the Institute 
and delivered addresses. at one time or other during the week. 
The teachers entered the work with enthusiasm, and I think bet- 
ter work will be the result. The ‘‘Coextensive Act’’ was thor- 
oughly discussed by both directors and teachers, the result of 
which will be longer schools and better salaries of teachers.

POLK COUNTY. 
Our Annual Institute for 1904 kept up to the high standard 
heretofore set, though we had but little beside local help. The 
average attendance of teachers and applicants was larger than 
the number required to supply our schools. 
The welcome address was well made by Rev. T. M. Hicks, and 
the response by Rev. M. C. Lunsford. The organization of the 
Institute was completed by selecting Miss Bessie Bandy, Secre- 
tary; D. B. Stephens, Critic; J. P. Morris, D. B. Stephens and 
J. F. Gentry, Secondary Grading Committee; M. 8. Waldrop, 
W. H. Vaughn and G. L. Williams, Primary Grading Committee. 
The sessions were characterized by practical instruction, close 
attention, higher examination requirements and by a deep re- 
ligious feeling. The most noticeable indication of the spirit of 
advancement in our teachers was their passing Friday morning, 
by a standing vote of fifty to nothing, a resolution to require all 
teachers and applicants for schools in 1905 to pass an examina- 
tion at the Normal. About four-fifths of those so voting have 
heretofore been exempted from examination at one time or an- 
other. A promising indication for the future was several strong 
speeches in favor of a high school. 
The school conditions here continue to become more favor- 
able. Prof. Claxton’s address to several hundred citizens Cir- 
euit Court day in March was one of the greatest ever delivered 
in the county. He aroused the friends of education, and made 
many careless persons alive to the needs of schools. His address 
was the chief factor in securing an increased school levy, which 
was done at the following April term of court. One main reason 
given by the ’Squires for the increase was to be able to pay better 
salaries in order to get better teachers. Already the salaries have 
advanced from $30 average per month to about $33. 
A consolidation of three schools into one has been effected in 
the Fourth District, and a new three-room building is being 
erected to accommodate the more than 200 children in the com- 
bined wards. Two new buildings are soon to be erected near 
Duektown. These are to be substantial two room frame struct- 
ures, and when completed will make 38 houses, 28 of them on my 
plans, erected since 1898.

PUTNAM COUNTY. 
The 1904 Putnam County-Teachers’ Annual Institute is eon- 
ceded to have been one of the most interesting and best attended 
Institutes ever held in Putnam County. The Institute continued 
six days and consisted of a review of the public school curricu- 
Tum, lectures by members of the faculty of instructors, regular 
work in the theory and practice of teaching and drills and dis- 
cussions as to the best methods of study and teaching and ex- 
aminations. All of the teachers manifested the greatest interest 
in the Institute and seemed determined to secure the greatest 
benefit possible from it. As a result of the four State Institutes 
which have been held in this city over two-thirds of the teachers 
of this county hold State certificates, either secondary or pri- 
mary. - : 
We hold semi-monthly Teachers’ Institutes and educational 
rallies at different points throughout the county while the schools 
are in session. These meetings have been a wonderful stimulus 
to the educational interests of the county. Never before in the 
history of Putnam County was there so much interest manifested 
by the people in public education as at present. They desire bet~ 
ter schools and are interested in the education of their children. 
The teaching corps of this county is better qualified and doing 
better work than ever before. We are endeavoring this year to 
grade the public schools of the county and adhere as nearly as 
practicable to the grades. 
I gratuitously furnish all of the teachers of the county with 
monthly report blanks for their schools and require them to 
promptly furnish parents with a complete record of the progress,

standing, attendance and deportment of their children, thereby 
enabling the parents to keep informed as to the educational 
progress of their children. 
A good per cent of my teachers read educational journals, 
study works on teaching and are thoroughly interested in their 
work. 
The colored teachers had an interesting and successful In- 
stitute, with 15 teachers in attendance; 13 received certificates. 
Their Institute was conducted at the same time as the Institute 
for white teachers, but in a different building. Their instructors 
did very creditable work. We are expecting to accomplish much 
during the coming year.

RHEA COUNTY. 
Practically every teacher in the county attended the State 
Institute placed with us at Dayton. This took the place of our 
regular Annual Institute, and the examination given was our 
first examination for county teachers. There is no doubt but 
that this State Institute raised the standard of our teachers con- 
siderably. All who failed to receive State certificates either did 
not teach or waited until my second examination, with the ex- 
_ception of some who made the requisite grade, but whose at- 
tendance would not allow them a certificate. Upon the recom- 
mendation of the faculty I gave them county certificates. Since 
the close of the Institute I have been compelled to hold two sup- 
plementary examinations for county teachers in order to supply 
the demand. Each time these examinations continued two days, 
and I was assisted by a board of examiners. 
The past year has witnessed some fruitful consolidation work. 
Eight schools have been consolidated, with but slight opposition,
-P-A-G-E-294

and movements are on foot to do more work of this kind. In 
every case the will of the people was consulted. Two new one- 
story, two-room school houses have been erected and now have a 
splendid attendance. These are serving as examples to others 
who opposed the consolidation. At the January term of the 
County Court the school tax was raised from 30 to 37 cents on 
the $100. A proposition for a high school was voted down. 
Our monthly meetings have been remarkably successful. At 
every meeting only from 6 to 10 teachers have been absent. For 
convenience we set the first Monday in August as the beginning 
of the school year, and at the close of each sehool month we hold 
our meeting. This makes all monthly reports and warrants due 
on the same day. We have arranged with the clerks of the 
boards to send warrants for salaries to these meetings so the 
teachers can give out their monthly reports, receive warrants 
and have them cashed at these meetings. 
We have four sub-associations in the county—one in each 
district. These associations have presidents and secretaries—the 
presidents serving as vice presidents of the county associations. 
The districts are so large—only four main ones in the county — 
that it takes considerable time and trouble for the directors to 
transact the business, so much so, that the court appropriates a 
per diem of $1.50 and mileage for the actual time spent by the 
directors in their work. 
We are now holding a series of school rallies over the county, 
the main object of which is to discuss school questions with the 
patrons and to arouse a deeper interest in the schools,

ROANE COUNTY. 
The Summer School for the teachers of Roane County was 
held in Kingston, Tenn., beginning June 20, and closing July 
15. The attendance from the first was good, and grew until the 
close. The interest upon the part of the attendants was the very

best. All went to show that the teachers of Roane County are 
up to date in school work. The Superintendent was ably as- 
sisted by Prof. H. L. Ellis, of Kingston, and W. E. Gallion, of 
Oliver Springs, as instructors. Daily recitations were held in 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, U. 8S. History, Tennessee History, 
Physiology, Geography and School Management; also occasional 
recitations in spelling and reading. The purpose of the school 
was to review the teachers closely on the subject matter of the 
above studies, as also to train them in the best methods of teach- 
ing. The results along these lines were very gratifying. Much 
of praise can be said of the diligent efforts of all who attended. 
The writer has never witnessed better work nor better results. 
  Many visitors were present almost constantly. The people 
of the town and county showed unbounded interest in the 
work. Able addresses were delivered before the school by 
different persons on various subjects. A valuable lecture was 
given by Judge Sevier, of Kingston, on ‘Early Tennessee His- 
tory.’’ A lecture denoting wide research was delivered by Capt. 
McElwee, of Rockwood, on ‘‘Roane County History.’? Hon. 
8. G. Heiskell, of Knoxville, gave an entertaining lecture on 
**Publie Schools in Tennessee.’ : 
In vocal music, Miss Vera Smith, of Harriman, and Miss 
Grace Martin, of Kingston, reridered most beautiful solos; also 
high class readings were given by Miss Kate Wester, of Kingston, 
and Miss Eva McDonald, of Harriman. Miss Voorhees and Miss 
Veavy, the former a teacher in the public schools of Dayton, 
Ohio, and the latter of Richmond, Ind., were interested attend- 
ants upon the school, and each gave interesting representations 
of the public school work in their respective States. There was 
not a dull moment during the entire session of the school. 
Roane County is proud of her schools and of her teachers. 
The people are waking up to this vital interest and are moving 
into line. We have built, and are now oceupying four new school ° 
houses erected this summer, in good modern style. Salaries 
range from $30 to $50 per month in the country schools, all to 
run five months. These schools are now in session and doing 
well. I expect to use the new books this year.

ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
Two years ago, when I qualified as Superintendent of Public 
Schools of Robertson County, I found that the organization of 
schools for the rural districts had been carried forward to such 
an extent as not to require special attention except where there 
were weak schools. 
The reorganization of these communities has been attempted. 
I find such work slow, but some advance has been made. In 
every case we have tried to act advisedly. 
Early in my term of office I announced to teachers and di- 
rectors that the administration of the schools was the end to- 
ward which we direct our energies. 
Under this we were confronted with the problems of (1) at- 
tendance, (2) grading, (8) discipline, (4) the proper stimulus. 
I make grateful acknowledgments of the earnestness with 
which these problems have been discussed.
-P-A-G-E-301
—270— 
1. Thus far our attendance is not what we desire it to be— 
and may never be under our existing laws, but we are proud to 
note fewer days absent and an increasing interest among our 
patrons in the solution of this question. If the future will 
maintain our present healthy condition of public sentiment and 
improve our public roads, much progress can be made. 
2. Our best secondary schools are fairly well graded; they 
have the work well planned in all the grades of the public 
school course, and offer additional instruction in Language, 
Mathematics, History and Science. 
In the primary schools there is marked progress. Many of 
the patrons in the rural districts are renters, who move at the 
end of the year, and having such a short term after the holidays, 
it has been difficult to get the children to enter. The grading 
and promotion of such children have been difficult, but with our 
recent increase in school term the above difficulty has been par- 
tially eliminated. 
3. The problem of discipline is being satisfactorily solved. 
There are fewer outbreaks and more mutual confidence and sym- 
pathy between pupils and teacher. 
4. The proper stimulus depends on many things and many 
things depend on it. The teachers, as a rule, are reading peda- 
gogical works and studying every phase of child-life. In the 
main, they are capable of judging the spirit that should animate. 
In the past year much interest has been aroused in the coun- 
ty teachers’ library. We have a small, but choice, county li-- 
brary, about half of which is pedagogical works. These books 
are being read and studied. A few of the stronger educational 
centers in the rural districts have school libraries, and efforts are 
being made to enlarge these. We hope to see this sentiment 
widen, deepen and push forward until all the districts are thus 
supplied. 
The educational tendency is upward. Though many things 
are not what we would have them be, we have great confidence 
in the good intention of those to whom our school interest is 
intrusted.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
Our Annual Institute for Scott County met in the academy 
at Huntsville, June 27, and held two weeks. Supt. Mynders 
sent Miss M. Arthur, of Nashville, to help and her work was ex- 
eellent and highly appreciated. 
Prof. Setliff’s work was mainly a continuance of the work 
began one year ago in Method and Psychology, and it was very 
efficient. The faculty was unusually strong, and I believe more 
effective work was done than at any Institute heretofore held in 
this county. 
We reorganized our Reading Circle and expect to continue 
that work this year. Some of our teachers did good work last 
year, but we expect to make our organization much more effec- 
tive. 
Our school term will be materially increased this year on ae- 
count of a good tax levy and a better valuation of property.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
Inclosed find the annual report of the schools of Sevier 
County. This report is as nearly correct as it is possible for me 
to make it, a few of the distriet directors having failed to report 
in time for me to get the exact statistics. 
Our Annual Normal Institute was held from July 4, to July 
10, and was well attended by the teachers of the county, who 
showed a great deal of earnestness in their work by the enthu- 
siasm with which they entered the work, and by the close atten- 
tion they gave to the instruction. The teachers are unanimous 
in the opinion that this was the best Normal Institute ever held 
in the county. 
The instruction given was principally on methods and 
school management. The class exercise was not given as review 
to prepare the teachers for examination, but to illustrate methods 
of instruction. 
The teachers of Sevier County join me in expressing our sin- 
cere thanks to Hon. S. A. Mynders for sending us such splendid 
instructors as Prof. H. B. Alexander, of Fayetteville, and Mrs. 
Gennie Mynders, of Knoxville. Their instruction was earnest,
-P-A-G-E-307
—276— 
forceful, very interesting and highly beneficial. Their work was 
ably supplemented by Prof. J. W. Trotter, Rev. D. W. White 
and Prof. Goddard. 
I believe this Institute did more effective work than any ever 
held in this county. The Teachers’ Library Association is in ex- 
cellent condition, and we expect much good work on that line 
this year. Our greatest needs are more money, more comfortable 
school houses and better equipments.

SHELBY COUNTY. 
In compliance with the school law 1 herewith submit my re- 
port of Shelby County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 
1904. During my term of office I have worked very earnestly 
to advance the educational interests of the county. To our di- 
rectors and teachers who have given me their hearty coopera- 
tion much eredit for the marked improvement of the schools is 
due. The patrons, too, manifest a great deal of interest in our 
plans for the betterment of the schools. We have organized as- 
sociations of county teachers—white and colored—which meet 
monthly during the scholastie year to diseuss educational ques- 
tions of importance and current interest. 
‘We also have teachers’ reading circles for both white and 
colored teachers. Systematic courses of reading and study are 
pursued each year, and interest in this work is steadily growing. 
In June I held a County Institute of one week’s duration, for 
the white teachers, and short rally for the colored teachers. At 
the close of each I held examinations in the subjects of the read- 
ing courses for the year. 
Our directors are endeavoring to make the physical condi- 
tions of their schools as nearly what they should be as possible, 
and with but few exceptions our school buildings are comfort- 
able and well furnished. 
«An increase in the county school tax together with our ap- 
portionment of the State surplus fund has caused a correspond- 
“ing increase in the length of our school term and the salaries of
-P-A-G-E-309
—278— 
teachers. ‘These changes will of course have a beneficial effect 
upon our entire system. 
The general interest in the public school system has been 
gradually deepening and spreading in this county for several 
years, and the prospect for a continued improvement and wider 
appreciation in the future is very encouraging.

SMITH COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Annual Institute met at Carthage, Monday 
morning June 6, with a large, enthusiastic band of teachers pres- 
ent. The old teachers of the county say: ‘‘It was the most har- 
monious Institute ever held in the county, and the teachers were 
more earnest in their work. They seemed to have their whole 
heart in the work, and showed that they were anxious to do 
everything in their power to better the schools of the county.’’ 
Our County Teachers’ Asgociation reorganized, changing the 
place of meeting from Carthage, the county seat, to different 
sections of the county, feeling by so doing, as the old saying goes, 
‘‘we could kill two birds with the same stone;’’ the teachers 
would get the benefit of the meeting just the same, and while so 
doing would create an interest among the patrons, school officers, 
ete. Realizing that we cannot hope to raise the standard of 
teaching very much until we can get more money to pay our 
teachers—as there is not much inducement for a teacher to make 
special preparation for teaching, when he gets only $30 per 
month for about four or five months in the year—we resolved to 
make a strong effort to induce our County Court to raise our tax 
sufficient to give us eight months of school a year. 
We appreciate the instructions of our worthy State Super- 
intendent to do away with our small schools. We have discon- 
tinued some and are educating our patrons up to the point where 
we can do the same with others without so much friction. We 
think we can accomplish better results more satisfactorily by tak- 
ing a little time and work. I am proud to say that by having 
fewer schools and receiving the extra money from the State 
treasury, we will have about six and one-half months of school 
this year instead of five. 
The colored teachers had a very interesting Institute, held at 
Gordonsville by W. H. Ballard. It opened June 20, and con- 
tinued five days.

STEWART COUNTY. 
' Stewart County is still on the upward trend in school matters. 
The new school law making civil and school districts coextensive 
has improved conditions very much. We have fewer and more 
competent school directors, thus giving better administration. 
Ten small schools have been consolidated into larger schools, 
with better attendance and greater interest. Improvements 
from this law have been so many that our citizens think that 
another step in this same direction would result in still greater 
improvements. Our County Court, Public School Directors and 
County Teachers’ Association have all passed resolutions en- 
dorsing the Montgomery bill and asking our Representatives to 
vote for its extension to the State. 
Our efforts for each school. to supply itself with a library, 
having met with only a very limited success, we began the pres- 
ent year with a new plan. Each teacher at our Annual Institute 
pledged herself to raise the sum of $10, to be turned over toa 
general fund for the purpose of establishing a circulating school 
library for the county. Entertainments have been held through- 
out the county, and in nothing we have ever undertaken have 
we met with the cordial support that we have in this matter. 
The people realize the necessity for such a thing, and the response 
has been most liberal. We have already a fund amounting to 
$400, and when all have reported we will have something like 
$600 for a start. These entertainments have not only served the 
purpose of raising funds for a library, but have also set them to 
discussing a wide range of educational matters which were 
brought before them at these meetings. The attendance in the 
schools this fall has been the best ever known in the history of 
the county. . 
We havea live Teachers’ Association, which meets monthly 
from April to November, inclusive. Throughout the winter 
they read a prescribed course of study, and at our annual exam- 
ination many take this examination in preference to the regular 
examination. 
The newly-adopted series of books has given almost universal 
satisfaction, both among teachers and patrons. They are re- 
garded as being very much superior to the old series. We have

had considerable trouble in the matter of exchange, but we hope 
that we now have that satisfactorily arranged. 
Everything considered, we are doing nicely in school matters,

history.

SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
I send you herewith my annual statistical report. I have 
been so overwhelmed of late with official work as to make it not 
possible to get it in shape earlier. As yet I have been unable to 
get full data for all items required. This report is, however, as 
nearly accurate as I can make it at this time. 
I have but little else to report. I cannot boast that we are 
making any rapid forward strides educationally, but we are stiil 
moving forward very satisfactorily. I am earnestly trying to 
have our schools supplied with the very best tnachers available. 
As usual, I am having some trouble with a few ‘‘would be school 
keepers,’’ whose answer papers are below ‘‘low water mark;’’ 
one a member of our County Court. 
Our County Normal was by no means a failure, even though 
the teacher whom you appointed to aid us failed to appear. I 
was ably assisted by Profs. Sherfey, Shipley and Pope, Drs. 
Wallace, Neighbors and Jeffries; also Supt. Watkins and Prof. 
Henderson were with us and contributed. much to make the In- 
stitute a success. From present indications the coming year 
bids fair to be a prosperous one. 
J. E. L. SENEKER, 
County Superintendent. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
I take pleasure in making a few remarks on the conditions 
in Sumner County. The State Peabody Institute, which you 
located at Gallatin, was a marked success. This Institute was 
well attended by teachers from Sumner and adjoining counties. 
Your visit to our county during the Institute did much good 
in the upbuilding of a strong public sentiment for better schools 
and longer terms. 
I think our work in the school room was better last year than 
ever before. The teachers seem to be more in earnest than ever
-P-A-G-E-317
—284— 
before. I am glad to say that the people are thoroughly aroused 
and are demanding higher work in many sections of the county 
where we only had primary schools. In a number of instances 
they have built good houses by private subseription for the pub- 
lie school work. Our teachers are using every influence with the 
people to have better attendance and better work. 
Nearly every district in the county is trying to get the people, 
by private subseriptions, to put libraries in the schools. We have 
meetings of our teachers once a month while the schools are in 
session in different parts of the county.. I find that these meet- 
ings get. the people aroused and they take more interest in edu- 
cation. I also mect the colored teachers in their monthly meet- 
ings. This is well attended by them and is accomplishing great 
good. Interest has been thoroughly aroused, and we believe the 
schools in this section will show improvement. Our teachers 
appreciate the value of Institute work. No teacher, who wants 
to be progressive, can afford to miss an Institute. I have been 
proclaiming this doctrine up and down the hills and valleys of 
Sumyer County for the last eight years. 
W. F. ALBricHt, 
County Superintendent. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
During my term of office I have witnessed many and marked 
changes in the public schools of this county, most of which have 
been decided improvements, but at the close of this year’s work 
I find many improvements that could and should be added to 
our public school system. The act fixing the number of 
directors in Hamilton County should be extended to every 
county in the State. Our next Legislature should pass some act 
of “requirement” (call it compulsory education if you wish) that 
would prevent parents from taking their children out of school 
for trivial causes. — , 
The act that protects our citizens and ministers against dis- 
turbers of public worship should apply also to our public schools 
and public school teachers. Such an act would practically

abolish corporal punishment in our schools and at the same time 
would protect our now helpless teachers from the unwarranted 
attacks of the fond and over indulgent mothers, More stringent 
laws against tresspassing on school grounds, defacing school 
property and writing obscene language in private as well as pub- 
lic places. 
I have no opponent next January, which means reelection for 
the next term, during which time, with your kind and ready 
assistance and intelligent guidance, I expect to accomplish 
much and render to my people the best service of my life. 
With best wishes for your continued success, I am,

County Superintendent. 
TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
As the State Superintendent favored us with a State Insti- 
tute in Sumner County, which is in reach of all our teachers, and. 
as most of them wanted to attend there, we had no institute for 
white teachers in our county this year. We are beginning to 
reap the benefits of some of the wise legislation in our county in 
longer terms by one month, and better school houses. There 
has been a good deal of kicking about consolidating schools, but 
the people are beginning to see the wisdom of the law. On the 
whole, Trousdale County can congratulate berself on the condi- 
tion of her schools. 
The Trousdale County Colored Institute was held in June 
and run one week. It was ably conducted by R. R. Burnley, 
assisted by John Mitchell, and was one of the most successful 
institutes ever held in this county.

The Annual Institute in and for the County of Van Buren 
was held at Burritt College, in the town of Spencer. It was 
called to order on the 23d of May by Supt. Ernest N. Haston, 
who was elected chairman for the Institute. Miss Lena Moore, 
of White County, was elected secretary for said Institute, and 
made a most efficient and faithful secretary. Prof. T. H. Gillin- 
tine was elected critic for said Institute, and rendered interesting 
and valuable service. The Institute, as a whole—the work and 
all—proved to be the most complete and best in the history of the 
county. We feel very grateful, indeed, to all those who in any 
way, whatever, assisted in the Institute work, and we are looking 
forward to one of the most successful years in the school work 
in this county that has ever been.

We had a good Institute. Fine interest in the work. I ex- 
pected you to visit us one day. I am sorry that you did not 
come. Several took the examination to whom I did not issue 
certificates. I shall hold one moreexamination in August, 1904; 
because ll of the teachers did not attend this last examination. 
The most of the schools in Warren will open July 11,1904. The 
teachers of ‘Warren County this fall, generally speaking, are well 
prepared for their work. I gave them a pretty critical examina- 
tion.

tions, had expired, and the reports thereof, if any were made,

  WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
The schools of Washington County the past year have not met 
the expectations of those directly interested in public school 
work. While one-fifth of the number of schools was cut out by 
the act requiring a population of 70 to the school, there was no 
increase in attendance in the schools established in conformity 
with the law. Through indifference or obstinacy on the part of 
patrong and directors the children from these discontinued 
schools were kept out of school, which was detrimental to child 
and parent. 
The greatest need of the public schools of Washington County 
is more funds to continue the schools for longer terms, and a 
more experienced corps of teachers. If the funds were sufficient 
to continue the schools for eight or nine months in the year, 
then, no doubt, we would be able to hold good, efficient teachers, 
The average school term of Washington County is about five 
months, in the rural districts. We have an average teaching 
force, but each year we have a new recruit of young teachers ° 
without any experience in school work. The experienced and 
efficient teachers drift away to the city schools, or where they 
can secure better remuneration. This is deplorable
-P-A-G-E-327
—292— 
The county is well equipped with good school houses, 65 in 
number, modern and up to date, and nearly all well furnished 
with good, patent desks and other fixtures. Only one log school 
house remains in the county. 
The people of the county are generally interested in educa- 
tion, although our County Court failed the past year to do its 
duty in levying sufficient tax to support the schools of the 
county for a longer term of five months. When the State gave 
sufficient funds from the surplus to prolong the schools, the 
County Court lowered the rate of taxation for school purposes 
and left the schools with the usual short term. I am sure this 
action was not sanctioned or approved by the people of the 
county. 
The schools of the county are in fairly good condition the 
present year. 
Trusting the interest may grow and prosper, | am your servant 
and co-worker in the cause of education.

Prof. Jackson Reeves, of Lynnville, Tenn., came to help us 
instead of Prof. Brugh, af Nashville, Tenn., as Prof. Brugh could 
not come. Prudentiorem vidi neminem quam Prof. Reeves. 
The Wayne County Teachers’ Institute had a regular daily 
attendance of 60 per cent of teachers, besides a large crowd of 
spectators and visiting teachers. Professors Jim Stricklin and 
J. F. Gallaher, both Wayne County boys, helped in the Institute, 
and I can truthfully say did good work in the Institute. In 
fact, the last Institute was the best attended ; teachers took more 
interest and were more eager to get the latest and best methods 
of instruction, so as to be better able to impart their knowledge 
to others. The teachers were better qualified than any other 
body of teachers I have examined within the last four years. I 
am thankful to Prof. Reeves for his good work in the Institute. 
I thank the teachers, ladies and gentlemen, for their every 
courtesy and attention to the instructors during our short stay

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
Owing to the fact that two State Peabody Institutes were held 
in adjoining counties, I deemed it unwise to hold or attempt to 
hold a County Institute for white teachers, inasmuch as nearly 
all my teachers attended some State Peabody Institute either at 
Huntingdon, Union City, Jackson and Dickson. Over 100 of 
my teachers hold State certificates and the majority of them do 
good work in the school-room. . 
The colored teachers held their County Institute as usual at 
Martin. About four-fifths of the colored teachers attended. 
Their Institute was better in every way this year than ever before. 
It was conducted by Prof. J. W. Johnson, of Columbia, Tenn. 
He was assisted in the work by Profs. Dabbs and Bailey. But 
two failed to get certificates. 
The general interest in our school work is better than ever 
before, and there is a widespread demand among our best citi- 
zens for a reasonable compulsory attendance law. I long for the 
day to dawn when our public school children will have to attend 
not fewer than four months every year. -It isso much better to 
educate children than it is to prosecute them, and force the State 
to pay, in addition tothe public school funds already paid for 
them, more money taken from the pockets of honest men. J will 
make my statistical report later.

The summer Institute was changed to a summer school; was 
held at Hutchings College, the home of Supt. R. I. Hutchings. 
All teachers took an active part and pronounced it the best work 
ever done in the history of the county. 
The educational interest of White County is on a progressive 
move at present. One of the greatest educational revivals ever 
held in White County was held at Hutchings College during the 
month of June, in a four weeks’ summer school for teachers, 
The County Court appropriated $75 to employ an instructor, in

which Prof, Geo. Davis, of Hill City, was employed, and by his

they have placed the educational interest of White County upon 
a higher plane than ever before. 
During the administrations previous to Gov. Frazier the 
length of our schools was only about 75 days, but now we have 
five more, and on a much higher plane than ever before and with 
greater enthusiasm. We have monthly institutes, which are 
well attended with a great deal of interest. And we feel grateful 
to our County Court, to our teachers, and especially to our Gov- 
ernor and State Superintendent, for their earnest support in 
helping the poor boys and girls of White County to obtain a 
better education, which has met the approval of a gracious people.

WILSON COUNTY. 
The school interest of Wilson County is improving, but 
slowly. There seems to be a desire among the people generally 
for better prepared teachers, better school houses and facilities 
generally, as regards schools. The people most generally desire, 
as far as possible, to have fewer schools, and the secondary 
schools more centrally located. Our greatest trouble seems to 
be in running too many secondary schools, thereby forcing too 
many branches to be taught. 
The rural schools in Wilson County are yet lacking in many 
things which the city schools are blessed with. Their houses are 
not so good, their attendance not so full or regular and their 
gradation not so good. 
yur Summer Institute was a great success. The teachers 
took an interest and seemed to appreciate the work gone over. 
We find we have some home talent as Institute workers.

SUPPLEMENTARY COUNTY REPORTS. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
My necessary absence from Institute this summer prevents 
me from adding much to report of Prof. Cline, who acted for 
me at Institute. I employed Prof. J. 8. Hill, of Williamsburg, 
Ky., as Conductor, and all reports agree that a very successful 
Institute was held. Changing conditions due to school develop- 
ments have required the starting of two new schools. In another 
Joeality three schools have gone together voluntarily, and in an- 
other two have gone together. There are a number of small 
schools still, but sparseness of population prevents uniting more 
at present. 
The fact that civil districts were reduced from 18 to 4 at the 
same time that school districts were made coextensive with civil 
districts cannot work well in our county. The territory to be 
supervised by directors is too large. They cannot properly look 
after so large districts, especially without compensation. 
I feel that a great need is a unification of county work by 
having a county board, who should have authority to legislate, 
and they would naturally bring all parts of county under same | 
rules. On the whole, I think our work is progressing, and the 
standard of work done by the teachers is improving. ~ 
Yours truly, 
W. E. WHEELER, 
County Superintendent. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
In Franklin County there are 85 schools, whose terms aver- 
age a little over four months. The general school interest in the 
rural communities is not at all good, as evidenced by the poor
-P-A-G-E-340
—301— 
attendance, especially during the closing weeks of the schools. 
Many schools are closed before they have expended the money 
due them on account of the poor attendance. 
The majority of our teachers are doing good work, but some 
are wholly lacking in the elements of real progress. We have a 
County Teachers’ Association, which holds meetings in different 
sections of the county once each month and has done great good 
in arousing the proper interest in the schools. The association 
meetings ave growing in interest and efficiency, and if continued 
on present lines will result in much better conditions in this 
county. The school houses and furniture are generally good. 
The provisions of the law providing that there shall be sev- 
enty pupils to the school is almost wholly ignored in this county 
and school houses are frequently in a mile or a mile and a haif 
of each other, and consequently pay poor salaries and run short 
terms, but the sentiment for larger schools and longer terms is 
growing and in several districts has taken definite form and will 
be put into execution next year.

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
An Institute for the teachers of Fentress County began July 
4, 1904, and continued five days, during which time there were 
45 teachers in attendance, most of whom took an active part in 
the work. The Institute was conducted by the County Superin- 
tendent. Several of the teachers tock an active part, making the 
work pleasant and profitable. 
‘We have divided the county into five districts for the pur- 
pose of holding school meetings. A president is elected for each 
district, who is to preside over the meetings. All teachers in the 
distriet are expected to attend these meetings, as well as to attend 
a general meeting, which is held at the county seat, where the 
presidents report the success of the local meetings. I am glad to 
state that these meetings are well attended by teachers, patrons 
and pupils. 
Our schools are larger than they were a few years ago, and I 
believe I can see that greater interest is being manifested by all 
concerned. W. P. Livre, 
County Superintendent.

GREENE COUNTY. 
The condition of schools in Greene County, while far from 
ideal, is better than ever before in its history. Last year we were 
able, by persistent effort, to reduce the number of our schools 
from 142 to 126, at the same time increasing the average number 
of days taught from 93 to 94; and the average salary from $27.35 
to $31.20. We enrolled more than twice as many pupils in the 
secondary schools than had been enrolled the year previous. 
Owing to severe sickness I was unable to do all the work I 
had planned for the summer. Jn consequence of this fact we had 
only one week’s Institute, as my report shows. Quite a number 
of our teachers attended Normal schools, and owing to this fact 
our Institute was not as well attended as it would otherwise have 
been. But, in spite of the many difficulties, we are progressing. 
Prof. Claxton has been with us on several oeeasions, and large 
crowds have attended our rallies. 
We are hopeful, and can see the dawning of a better day for 
Greene County. Consolidation, more money and better-prepared. 
teachers are the sources through which it must come. May that 
better day soon dawn! Very respectfully, 
R. H. Burxuart, - 
County Superintendent. 
TLAMBLEN COUNTY. 
In submitting annual report of Hamblen County I desire to 
eall your attention to some of the conditions of schools. The 
year just closing was one of the most successful in the history of 
Hamblen County schools. Never before was there such manifes- 
tation of interest on the part, not only of the teachers, but also 
of school officials and the public in general. 
Our Normal, condueted by Prof. Crouch, assisted by Prof. 
Heatwole and Mrs. Gennie Mynders, was interesting and instrue- 
tive to all. A larger number of teachers were enrolled, and more
-P-A-G-E-343
—304— 
interest shown than ever before in our County Institutes. Al- 
most all of the teachers and one-third of the school directors of 
the county are members of the Teachers’ Association and attend 
our monthly meetings regularly. The association is in the second 
year of its existence and much good has been accomplished. 
These things, with other facts found in statistics herein given, 
will tell of a year’s work which we believe to be well done. Our 
people are interested and we hope to accomplish a great deal in 
the year which has opened with such flattering prospects. 
Lena L. McCurster, 
County Superintendent. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
As I was not appointed Superintendent until July I had 
no part in the making of last year’s record. I have examined the 
records and find that no Institute was held during the year. The 
annual report, which I submitted some months ago, contains 
about all of the information that I could gather concerning the 
condition of our schools at that time. During July I examined 
70 applicants, most of them colored, and issued certificates to 27 
of them, but I suppose this work will have to eome in the report 
next June. 
There is more interest being manifested in the schools of this 
county than I have ever seen before. We have effected an or- 
ganization for monthly Institute work during the fall and winter 
and expect good results from the course of study mapped out. 
It is our desire to see Haywood among the first counties of the 
State in educational work. We fully endorse our State Super- 
intendent in the splendid work he is doing for the advancement 
of educational interests in the State, and pledge him our hearty 
support. F. R. Oaitvis, 
County Superintendent.

HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
The Humphreys County Institute met at Waverly, Tenn., on 
Monday, June 6, with 49 teachers in attendance. I was very 
ably assisted by Prof. C. L. Ridings, of the Waverly High School, 
who did some excellent work. Our teachers manifested a great 
deal of interest, and the work they did showed they were keeping 
up with the times in educational lines. 
T heartily indorse the present school system and I believe the 
schools will be greatly benefited by it; but in my opinion the 
greatest thing we need now is a compulsory school law.

MARION COUNTY. 
Our average school term, as you will see by my report, was 
longer last year than ever before in the history of the county. 
The strong opposition to school tax onee prevalent in this county 
has practically died out. A more progressive educational spirit . 
prevails, and the indications are that we will, in the near future, 
have better school facilities, and still longer terms. The pro- 
20
-P-A-G-E-345
—306— 
fessional spirit among owr teachers seems to be stronger and 
more general than at any previous time. 
Our teachers met in joint Institute at Monteagle, with the 
teachers of Greene County on the 6th of June, and was in ses- 
sion two weeks. Supt. J. D. Fults and myself employed Prof. 
W. G. Dillon, President of the school at Tracy City, and Prof. 
B. O. Duggan, Superintendent of the South Pittsburg City 
schools, as instructors in the Institute, while Miss Virginia Johns, 
of the Nashville schools, was employed by myself. 
Prof. Dillon taught Mathematics and Geography; Prof. Dug- 
gan taught History, Civil Government, Grammar, Rhetoric, 
Physiology and Pedagogy, alternating the studies so as to have 
only three periods each day. Miss Johns taught Primary Meth- 
ods and Literature. It is but justice to say that the work of all 
the instructors was of the highest order and eminently satisfac- 
tory to the Superintendents and teachers of both counties. 
T am sure that I voice the unanimous sentiment of the Marion 
County teachers when I say that our association with Supt. 
Fults and his teachers was both pleasant and profitable. At the 
elose of the Institute the Marion County teachers voted almost 
unanimously to meet with the Grundy County teachers at Mont- 
eagle next year. The enrollment was 83, and the attendance reg- 
ular. Respectfully, 
D. A. Tats, 
County Superintendent.

REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tenn. : 
Str—The Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School, located at Knox- 
ville, closed its fifty-fourth session on June 15, 1904. 
The attendance exceeded that of any previous year, the total 
enrollment being 255 in both departments—226 in the white de- 
partment and 29 in the colored department. The average at- 
tendance was 240. Nearly every county in the State was repre- 
sented. 
The health of the pupils was, as a rule, excellent, but in 
April, 1904, an epidemic of measles occurred affecting 35 pupils. 
There were, however, no fatalities from the disease and no seri- 
ous sequences. The commodious and well adapted hospital of 
the institution added much in this instance to the efficiency of 
the labors in behalf of the sick by the physician and the nurses, 
and also contributed greatly to the comfort of the patients. The 
generosity and the humanity of our State has never been more 
practically and helpfully manifested than in the excellent pro- 
vision here made for the care of the sick. 
Throughout the year the great work of the school—the train- 
ing, the education of the hands, the minds, the hearts of the 
deaf children of the State who could be brought under its c care— 
was pursued steadily with gratifying success. 
A brief sketch of the work of the deaf mute instruction may 
not be amiss here: A deaf child 8 years of age—the age of ad- 
mission with us—if untaught, has no means of free, satisfactory 
communication with the people of the world in which he lives 
—he has no language intelligible to the world and the world has 
no language for him. To give him language is the great work, 
_ the difficult work of the teacher of the deaf. 
At the outset persons, objects and pictures are used to inter- 
est the deaf child and to teach him that every person has a 
(309)
-P-A-G-E-349
—310— 
name, that everything has a name expressed by speech, by writ- 
ing, by printing or by manual spelling. If the pupil is taught 
by the manual method he is put at once to writing the names 
given him and to spelling them on his fingers, the single-hand 
manual alphabet being used. If taught by the oral method, 
speech is substituted for manual spelling. Action, words, verbs 
and descriptive words, adjectives in simple form are next intro- 
duced and simple sentences taught, to be followed by the other 
parts of speech and the more complex forms of words and sen- 
tences. 
To lay the foundation of education, to acquire the key to all 
other knowledge—language—is an especially difficult task for the 
deaf, to whom nature’s avenue of access to the brain for language, 
the ear, is closed. Thus the greater part of the first year of a 
deaf child’s stay at school must be given to acquiring the lan- 
guage, which a hearing child learns without effort, even uncon- 
sciously, before reaching school age. With a sufficient know]- 
edge of language to pursue other studies successfully, the prog- 
ress of the deaf child in the common school branches compares 
most favorably with that‘of the hearing child of like age and 
opportunities Our aim is to teach the common school branches 
thoroughly and to give at the same time such instruction in 
manners and morals, in neatness and efficient industry as will 
enable our pupils to become self-respecting and respected, self- 
supporting and helpful citizens of our Commonwealth. 
Daily instruction is given in a well-equipped gymnasium 
with very beneficial results upon the health, strength and bear- 
ing of the students who, in athletics, rank well to the front 
among the schools and colleges of this section of the State. 
The pupils maintain a literary society and a “Christian En- 
deavor Society,” both of which have been very interesting and 
helpful. , 
Printing, carpentry and shoemaking are taught the boys, 
while the girls are instructed in sewing, fancy work and general 
household duties. 
At the colored department, where a dairy for both depart- 
ments is maintained, the pupils assist in the dairy and in farm 
work. 
The overcrowding, mentioned in former reports, was happily 
relieved last year by the completion of the handsome and well 
adapted small boys’ building under construction at the time of
-P-A-G-E-350
—3ll— 
our last report. This building is now in use, contributing 
greatly to the efficient and satisfactory management of the 
younger boys by their separation from the older boys and giving 
the room thus vacated in the main building to the older pupils. 
The desire of the management of the school is to give to 
every deaf child in Tennessee the benefit of the education and 
training here provided by a generous State. There are now bet- 
ter facilities for doing this than ever before, though there are 
still deaf children scattered throughout the State who ought. to 
be at school, whose attendance might be secured by the assist- 
ance of public school teachers thrown in contact with sueh 
pupils and their friends. 
May not the management of the school ask again with confi- 
dence for the cooperation of all teachers in this work ? 
On the rising tide of educational interest, activity and prog- 
ress now so evident in our State, boding so much of good for 
her future welfare, the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School is 
striving to keep abreast with the foremost. 
Very respectfully, 
Tomas L. Mosgs, 
Superintendent. 
WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
DEAR Str—We submit the following statement of the work 
of the Watkins Institute for the year just passed. 
The Institute was established in 1885 in pursuance of the 
wishes, as expressed in his will, of Mr. Samuel Watkins, of 
Nashville, who desired to devote the larger part of his consider- 
able fortune to the education of persons whose circumstances 
had debarred them from the possession and enjoyment of this 
inestimable blessing. 
For many years past it has been found that Mr. Watkins’ 
objects could best be accomplished by maintaining, with the 
means which his benevolence placed at the command of the 
Commissioners, a free school primarily arranged for young per- 
sons of both sexes who are occupied during the day, and who 
are therefore prevented from attending the free schools main- 
tained by the city and county.
-P-A-G-E-351
—312— 
Fortunately, Mr. Watkins’ will gave to the Commissioners 
such wide discretion in administering the fund that it was 
clearly within their power to establish the Watkins Institute 
Free Night School, which was opened in 1889, and from that 
time has had a career of great success and usefulness. It is esti- 
mated by those familiar with the workings of the school that 
probably 90° per cent of the students are engaged all day in 
stores, shops and factories, and but for the opportunity afforded 
them to gain some education at this school must needs go with- 
out it. The remainder are young persons who need more ad- 
vanced instruction in bookkeeping, stenography, typewriting 
and similar branches, than is given in the public schools, and 
are not able to pay the charges of regular commercial colleges. 
A notable element in the school is the number of young foreign- 
ers who learn here to speak, spell and read English. Some of 
the students who attend are not less than 60 years of age, and 
there are many instances of American men and women 26 or 30 
years old who begin here the alphabet or the multiplication 
table; and this has been the case ever since the organization of 
a department low enough to admit pupils of this class. 
The Society of Colonial Dames of Tennessee, which is doing 
much to encourage the study of American history, offers each 
year a prize for the best essay on a historical subjezt selected by 
. that society ; and a prize was given this year by Mr. Fall for the 
next best essay. . 
Mr. John Hill Eakin, chairman of the Board of Commission- 
ers, and in point of service its oldest member, died in January, 
1094, He had for many years taken a deep iiterest in the suc- 
cess of the school, and his participation in all efforts to sustain 
and improve it was as active as his health would permit. 
And in February, 1904, the school lost by death the services 
of Prof. W. R. Garrett; he had been superintendent of the night 
school from its beginning until his death, except during the two 
years that he held the position of State Superintendent of In- 
struction. He was a gentleman of the highest character, and for 
thirty-seven years had devoted himself to teaching. To his 
experience and sagacity is due very much of the success of the 
school. 7 , 
Mr. William C. Collier has been appointed by the Governor 
Commissioner to succeed Mr. Eakin; and Prof. Alexander Fall 
has been elected superintendent of the school to succeed Dr. Gar- 
rett.
-P-A-G-E-352
318 — 
Mrs. A. E. Webber, in 1902, gave by deed to the State of 
Tennessee, in trust, two valuable storehouses and lots in Nash- 
ville, the rents of which were intended to go to the Watkins 
Institute and to add to the scope and usefulness of the school. 
During the past year there were maintained by means of the 
increased income two technical departments—telegraphy and 
telephony—and mechanical drawing. which had each from ten to 
fifteen students; and the term of the whole school was length- 
ened from four to six months. 
The Commissioners have by injunction been prohibited from 
using the Webber money until the termination of a suit which 
seeks to set aside the deed executed by Mrs. Webber; and those 
two departments have therefore been discontinued for the com- 
ing year; and it is possible that the length of the term may have 
to be diminished. 
The Commissioners take great pleasure in commending the 
efficient and earnest efforts of the teachers, nearly all of whom 
have worked in the school for years and are devoted to it and its 
objects. 
We append hereto the report of Prof. Fall for the year. 
Yours truly

—31b— 
DEPARTMENT OF TELEGRAPHY AND ELECTRICITY. 
Instruction and training were given in Practical Telegraphy 
and in the installation and operation of repeaters, duplex and 
quadruplex telegraph instruments. The course in Telegraphy 
comprised the construction of telephone receivers and transmitters, 
signalling apparatus and switchboards, Instruction was also 
given in the application ‘of electricity to other practical purposes. 
The courses in the three technical departments were designed 
to prepare students fur practical work. Students completing 
any department, upon giving satisfactory evidence of proficiency 
on examination, are awarded certificates, showing qualifications 
in the business or industry for which they are fitted. No fees 
of any kind are charged, but students provide text-books, sta- 
tionery, drawing material, etc. There are no restrictions of age 
or sex. The school is open every night in the week, except Sat- 
urday, from 7:20 until 9 o’cloek. Good character and behavior, 
regular and punctual attendance. and the faithful performance 
of duty are the only requirements. 
The sixteenth annual session was by far the most satisfactory 
in the history of the school. The total enrollment was 574 
against 443 of the preceding session; the percentage of attend- 
ance was better; the discipline was as near perfect as could be 
expected where so many of the pupils are wnaccustomed to the 
restraints of the school room ; and the work of the teachers has 
been characterized by prompt attendance and enthusiastic inter- 
est in the progress of their pupils. 
The following is the class and general report for the session :

SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Sirn—Another year, with its joys and sorrows, with its suc- 
cesses and disappointments, has passed into eternity never to be 
recalled. The curtain has dropped, the play is done, and many 
of those who trod the stage and played their part nobly and 
well have passed to their reward. We, who still remain, must 
take up the work they dropped and continue. it as well as we 
may, notwithstanding our inexperience and the ever-shifting 
scenes, now attracting with their bewildering beauty and now 
repelling with their hideous deformity and ugliness. Perplexed 
and uncertain we scarce know how to act or what todo. To be 
able to decide, to know the right, is, after all, the one thing, the 
great problem we are all trying to solve, for most of the happen- 
ings of life come by force of circumstances and not by our own 
foresight, nor by our own power to control destiny. But to 
seize a thought or principle, to fix it in the mind, to mould it 
into form, to test its vital force, to apply it to humanity’s great- 
est need, is the absorbing business of our civilization and the self- 
imposed task of this generation. The question is: What has 
brought about this wonderful civilization? What has caused it 
to:spread, not only throughout Christendom, but overall lands? 
What are the forces which make it, in its onward march, over- 
come all difficulties and obstacles? How comes it that man’s 
opportunities. for success and happiness are a hundred fold 
greater than they were a few generations ago? How comes it 
that the humblest and poorest can rise to distinction and honor? 
Which of the nations of the earth possesses the wealth, the in- 
fluence and the commerce of the world and are the arbiters of 
peace and war? All this comes from knowledge and all know!- 
edge from education. We believe in education, but what is it 
that we call education? A few years at school, a few subjects 
superficially studied and scarcely comprehended, a little Latin 
and a little mathematics? This is commonly thought to be ed- 
ucation; but education in its broadest sense may be divided into 
three great divisions—the first, instruction or knowledge com- 
municated to the intellect; second, training or exercise of the 
faculties; third, the developing or unfolding of the whole na- 
ture of man—his growth, his expansion, his striving to reach
-P-A-G-E-359
—318— 
his broadest and most exalted stature, to become acquainted 
with man’s possibilities, his powers and his limitations, to live 
with Nature and to know that we are a part, though a very small 
part, of God’s great universe. 
To make education possible the country at Jarge spends for 
every one of its population $2.90 annually for schooling its 
children. This sum sounds very insignificant when spoken of 
as each individual’s contribution to that noble purpose, but in 
the aggregate it amounts to more than $200,000,000. The coun- 
try at large spends for every pupil enrolled in its schools $20.29 
annually, but the South. in consequence of her poverty, has only 
been able to spend less than a third of the above amount for the 
education of her children. We are, however, steadily improv- 
ing, and before very long I trust our schools will be equal to any 
in the land. 
The sixtieth session of the school opened September 1, 1903, 
and it was one of the most successful periods in its history as to 
the number of children in attendance and their progress. On 
the first assembling of the school in chapel the morning of the 
2d of September there were present 146 pupils—an unusually 
good beginning, On September 19 there were 182 children pres- 
ent, and in the colored department, 36; total, 218. Total en- 
rollment for the year, 114 girls and 95 boys; total, 209. Colored 
department, 18 girls and 28 boys; total 46. Grand total, 255. 
Twenty of these were returned to their homes with sight com- 
pletely restored, or so improved that they have been able to at- 
tend the public school in their neighborhood. 
While this school is not in any sen¢e an infirmary, and while 
I do not offer the treatment of the eyes as an inducement to par- 
ents to send us their afflicted children, yet with many parents it 
is the best and the most important thing the school has to offer. 
Education is a secondary consideration with them. 
While I deprecate the low estimate thus placed upon educa- 
tion, and while it is supposed that the applicant has been 
examined and treated without success by some skillful oculist 
before seeking admission to the school, nevertheless, as there 
are so many poor people in the remote districts of the State 
where skillful specialists are not to be found, we have, for 
humunity’s sake, connected with the school an eminent oculist 
who examines each child as it enters and if anything can be done 
to assuage suffering or to restore vision it is done at once. Thus 
the physical comfort and welfare of the pupil is our first care.

Education is primarily intended to enlarge the mind, quicken 
perception, to fit man for life’s duties and responsibilities, to 
enable him to judiciously select from the thousands of trades 
and professions that one best adapted to his taste and training, 
whereby he may earn a livelihood and thus become an independ- 
ent citizen, a helper in the world’s great industries. So far as 
education and preparation go they are equally applicable to the 
blind, but as there are so few mechanical employments adapted 
to the blind, and those few not at all remunerative, the blind’s 
sphere of activity is very, very narrow and circumscribed. His 
only hope lies in the field of thought, where the intellect can 
~ have free play and where his infirmity will not be a hindrance 
to his success. If a man can do a thing well. mentally or 
physically, and if that thing contributes to the happiness or 
pleasure of any one, he is a benefactor; his physical condition 
rarely adds to or takes from its worth or popularity. The world, 
. ag a rule, is good and indulgent, has great sympathy for the 
helpless and afflicted, but when one has wares to sell the world is 
critical and strictly mercantile in its dealings—not a penny more 
than its true value will be given, no matter who is the vendor. 
I therefore seek the best teachers procurable for the money at 
ourcommand. I insist on thoroughness and exactness in the 
school room. The teacher must be enthusiastic, earnest, and 
conscientious, so that the children may have constantly before 
them a‘spirit to incite to greater and greater effort and to arouse 
in them an ambition to excel. J wish to create in the children a 
love for book, for the true and beautiful. If this is accomplished 
and high aspirations and noble thoughts fill the mind the battle 
is more than half won. Then personal effort and kind providence 
will do the rest. 
The school is carefully graded, requiring in the Literary De- 
partment the services of eight teachers who are graduates of the 
best schools and colleges in the country. The course of study is 
similar to that pursued in our foremost preparatory schools. 
The Musical Department, which has long been noted for its 
excellence, engages five well-trained musicians who thoroughly 
instruct the pupils in piano, organ and vocal music, and also in 
theory and harmony. 
As so many of the children come to us weak, awkward and 
poorly developed, we find it very beneficial to give them careful 
and systematic physical training, for a strong, wholesome, and
-P-A-G-E-363
—320— 
well-developed body is the prime requisite in a successful devel- 
opment of the intellect. A physical culture teacher is, therefore, 
employed and combines with this physical training the art of 
correct reading, or elocution,

from the perpendicular and which was considered dangerous, 
was safely anchored to the main building by hog chains. The 
basement of the east wing was plastered, painted, and fitted up 
for the Primary Department and for the sewing and fancy: work 
rooms and has proven a most satisfactory addition as well asa 
great convenience to the school. All floors of this wing were 
thoroughly oiled, receiving two heavy coats, and a wainscot was 
painted on the walls of its halls and stairways. The galleries 
connecting main buildings and wings were thoroughly over- 
hauled, decayed timbers removed and new ones put in their 
place. Substantial supports and braces have so strengthened 
them that there may be no longer any apprehension of danger. 
They have also been thoroughly painted. 
A durable cork carpet was placed on the floor of the front hall 
which has proven very satisfactory. The parlor and private 
office were beautifully painted, an attention which they had 
needed for several years. The old parlor furniture was replaced 
by a handsome new set. The front of the building, which was 
very dingy and weather-stained, received afresh coat of paint 
which greatly adds to the beautiful appearance of the entire 
building. Fifty iron beds take the place of the wooden beds and 
cots used last year. So there is not a single wooden bedstead 
now used by the children. Fifty desks were purchased, thirty 
for Primary Hall and twenty for the colored school. We also 
purchased six new pianos and two very good second-hand pianos, 
The front wall, the massive pillars, the handsome gates, the ex- 
cellent driveway, and the sidewalks, all have been completed 
and add greatly to the appearance of the grounds. 
Through the kindness and influence of Messrs. Foster & 
Creighton the materials used in constructing the guard fence in 
front of the house along the drive were donated by Messrs. J. H. 
Fall & Co., Stewart & Bruckner and Phillips & Buttorff. The 
superintendence and labor were donated by Messrs. Foster & 
Creighton. The colored school has been enclosed by a new and 
substantial wire fence which improv-s the entire appearance.

UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Tu the Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction of Tennessee : 
This report upon the condition of the work of the University 
of Tennessee during the session of 1903-4 is respectiully sub- 
mitted in accordance with your request. 
The organization of the institution has continued the same 
as at the time of my last report; progress has been made during 
the year in a majority of the departments, and the influence of 
the University has been extended still further. ‘The year has 
been made notable by the number of gifts, which are most grate- 
fully acknowledged. Mr. John L. Rhea, an eminent citizen of 
Knoxville, Tenn., has given the University securities of value of 
about $10,000 to establish the Rhea Memorial, the income to be 
used in assisting worthy students in the classical department. The 
General Education Board has made a second contribution of 
$5,000 for the Department of Education; Hon. D. Willis James, 
of New York City, donated $1,000 for the same purpose. Smaller 
amounts have been received for this department from other 
sources, making the total sum of $9,600 raised for its support. 
The attendance upon the different departments of the Uni- 
versity during the session ending June, 1904, was as follows:

In view of the discussions going on in the State relative to 
the character of instruction and the results of the work of the 
University of Tennessee, it appears to be well to again explain 
the foundations of the University in the act of Congress and 
the laws of the State. One must at least go back to the Consti- 
tution of North Carolina, adopted in 1776, to trace the source of 
influences which gave rise to this institution. . North Carolina 
and Tennessee were peopled chiefly by the so-called Scotch-Irish, 
who loved their schools next to their churches and established 
them wherever they went. Chiefly through their influence the 
means of education were among the first things provided for in 
all the constitutions drawn up by these people. The Constitu- 
tion of North Carolina, referred to, declared that ‘ta school or 
schools shall be established by the Legislature for the convenient 
instruction of youth,” and that ‘all useful learning shall be 
duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” 
The unsettled condition of the country prevented a compliance 
with this requirement until 1789, when the University of North 
Carolina was duly established. 
The people who came over from Virginia and North Carolina 
into the western valleys brought the same principles and pur- 
poses with them. The most notable of their utterances in this 
connection was that contained in the Constitution proposed for 
the State of Franklin, submitted to the convention at Greene- 
ville in 1785. This declared that “all kinds of useful learning 
shall be encouraged by the commonwealth, that is to say, the 
future Legislature shall erect before the year 1787 one university 
which shall be near the center of the State, and not in any city 
or town; and if experience shall make it appear to be useful to
-P-A-G-E-372
—3825— 
the interest of learning in this State, a grammar school shall be 
erected in each county.” Truly a most remarkable utterance for 
so early a day, only to be explained when we learn that Scotch- 
Irish preachers wrote it. 
The celebrated Ordinance for the Government of the Territory 
of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio, passed July 
18, 1787, contained these memorable words: ‘“ Religion, morality, 
and knowledge being necessary to good government and the 
happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall 
be forever encouraged.” When North Carolina ceded to the 
United States the territory from which the State of Tennessee 
was formed, it stipulated expressly that the inhabitants of the 
“Territory South of the River Ohio” “shall enjoy all ‘the 
privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth in the ordinance of 
the late Congress for the Government of thé Territory Northwest 
of the River Uhio.” The United States accepted this south- 
western territory, therefore, under an obligation to provide 
“schools and means of education,” and right royally has it 
fulfilled its pledge. The Act for the Government of the ‘lerri- 
tory South of the River Ohio says: “ The inhabitants shall enjoy 
all the privileges, benefits and advantages set forth in the 
Ordinance of the late Congress for the Territory Northwest of the 
River Ohio” The only general privileges or advantages men- 
tioned in the Ordinance for the Northwest Territory were “schools 
and means of education.” Congress thus affirmed the demands 
of the State of North Carolina and bound itself to provide them. 
On September 10, 1794, the fifteenth day of the first regular 
session of the first Assembly of the New Territory South of the 
River Ohio, the mother institution of our State University came 
into being under the title of the “President and Trustees of 
Blount College,” so named in honor of William Blount, Governor 
of the Territory. Col. Moses White, the historian of the 
University, claims that this was the first strictly nondenomina- 
tional college established under the jurisdiction of the United 
States—the forerunner of all these great state colleges and 
universities which are destined to become the distinctly American 
institutions of learning. The charter of Blount College stip- 
ulated that “the trustees shall take effectual care that students 
of all denominations shall be admitted to the equal advantages 
of a liberal education, and to the emoluments and honors of a 
college; and that they shall receive a like fair, generous and 
equal treatment during their residence therein.” That the great
-P-A-G-E-373
—326— 
men who organized our State intended to found a Territorial 
(State) College, as distinguished from a local or a sectarian col- 
lege, is further shown by the trustees named in its charter. 
These trustees were William Blount, the Governor of the Terri- 
tory and the friend of President Washington; the Secretary of 
the Territory ; its two Judges; Gen. John Sevier, the ex-Gover- 
nor of the State of Franklin and the first Governor of Tennes- 
see; Col. William Cocke, the mover of the act for the college, 
afterward Blount’s colleague in the Senate of the United States, 
and eleven other leading men, two of whom (Roane and Willie 
Blount) were afterwards Governors of the State, and four United 
States Senators. These noble pioneers gave the new college all 
they had to give, a charter and trustees. They doubtless had in 
mind, even then, their obligation and that of the United States 
and the territory to the people committed to their care. Thus 
was born the present State University. 
In 1806 Congress ceded to Tennessee public lands comprising 
the eastern two-thirds of the present State. In yielding this 
magnificent empire. it was evidently mindful of the solemn 
covenant contained in the Northwest Ordinance and in the con- 
tract with the State of North Carolina that “schools and the 
means of education” should be a perpetual privilege to be en- 
joyed by the inhabitants of this soil; for this act made it a con- 
dition of the cession that Tennessee should set apart 100,000 
acres which should be sold and the proceeds be invested for the 
use of two colleges, one in East and one in West (now Middle) 
_Tennessee A like amount was to be devoted to academies in 
the counties. 
The General Assembly of Tennessee, at the session following 
the passage of this act, established East Tennessee College at 
Knoxville, made it the heir of Blount College and endowed it 
with the proceeds of the sale of one-half of this land. In this 
manner the parent college of our State University received its 
first endowment. It was founded, as we have seen, in accord- 
ance with the requirements of the first Constitution of North 
Carolina, of the Northwest Ordinance, and of the deed of cession 
of the State of North Carolina. 
The Tennessee Constitution of 1884 declared: “ Knowledge, 
learning, and virtue being essential to the preservation of repub- 
lican institutions, and the diffusion of the opportunities and ad- 
vantages of education throughout the different portions of the
-P-A-G-E-374
—327— 
State being highly conducive to the prumotion of this end, it 
shall be the duty of the General Assembly in all future periods 
of this government to cherish literature and science.” This con- 
stitution goes on to say that the common school fund “shall re- 
main.a perpetual fund, the principal of which shall never be 
diminished by legislative appropriation, and the interest thereof 
shall be inviolably appropriated to the support and encourage- 
ment of common schools throughout the State and for the equal 
benefit of the people thereof.” And it adds that these provisions 
with regard to the common schools shall not be construed to 
“ prevent the Legislature from carrying into effect any laws that 
have been passed in favor of the colleges, universities or acade- 
mies.” These declarations have come down to us in the Consti- 
tution of 1870 and in the laws of the State. 
We have thus traced the University back through the State 
Constitutions, the charter of Blount Collegé, the charter of the 
Territory South of the River Ohio, the deed of cession from the. 
State of North Carolina to the United States, and the Northwest 
Ordinance, the proposed Constitution for the State of Franklin 
to the Constitution of the State of North Carolina. It is proved, 
therefore, beyond possibility of denial, that the State of Tennes- 
see, as the heir of this soil, is bound by its several constitutions 
and by the terms of the grant under which it received this terri- 
tory to * forever encourage and maintain schools and the means 
of education.” This includes a State University, as well as com- 
mon schools. The State of Tennessee is thus bound by the act 
of cession of the State of North Carolina, the act of Congress 
granting it, the largest part of its territory, and by every one of 
its constitutions, to maintain.a State University which shall 
“cherish literature and science.” 
The fact that it has not done more of its own means for this 
cause may possibly be explained by the frequent grants made it 
for college purposes by the United States, though in reality these 
later grants of Congress have merely made the State’s obligation 
the greater. 
The act of Congress of July 2, 1862, donating public lands for 
agricultural colleges, was accepted, with all of its conditions, by 
the General Assembly, in 1869. This act donated certain land 
scrip to the several states and territories, the proceeds of the sale 
of which should “constitute a perpetual fund,” the capital of 
which shall remain forever undiminished, and the interest of
-P-A-G-E-375
—828— 
which ghall be inviolably appropriated by each State which may. 
take and claim the benefit of this act, to the endowment, sup- 
port, and maintenance of at least one college, where the leading 
object shall be, without excluding other: scientific and classical 
studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches 
of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanic arts,” etc. 
One of the conditions of this act was that*‘no portion of said 
fund, nor interest thereon, shall be applied directly or indirectly 
under any pretence whatever, to the purchase, erection, preserva- 
tion, or repair of any building or buildings.” Another section 
provides that “any State which may take and claim the benefit: 
of the provision. of this act shall provide, within five years, at 
least, not less than one college, or. the grant to said State shall 
cease.” In other words, the State was to provide the college, 
with all that pertained to it, especially the land and buildings 
while the United States provided the funds with which to 
carry it on. This land scrip was sold, the money invested in 
State bonds, and this institution was, in consideration of this 
endowment, required to “ provide free instruction for 275 stu- 
dents from the State of Tennessee.” In doing this, the State. of 
Tennessee did not forever discharge its obligation to maintain a 
university. On the other hand, in accepting this second grand 
trust for the State University, the State undertook a continu- 
ing responsibility, one that must grow with the State and with 
the needs of the people.. The United States Government has 
been wonderfully beneficent in its dealings with the State, but 
the State thereby is put under an increasingly greater obligation 
to do its part. 
Our conclusion then is that the State of Tennessee still rests, _ 
after all these years, under the solemn obligation, traced back 
through all the State constitutions, through the Ordinance for 
the Territory South of the River Ohio and the acts of its Assem- 
bly, to the Constitution of the mother State of North Carolina, 
and confirmed by two great grants of the Congress of the United 
States, to build for its own people a State University. This obli- 
gation attached to the very territory of the State. The State 
accepted this obligation with its land and its right to govern it 
and the inhabitants thereof. It is therefore an undying obliga- 
tion. It has never been discharged and it can never be dis- 
charged except by building and maintaining the University. Ten- 
nessee is now the only State or Territory in the American Union
-P-A-G-E-376
—329— 
which has not taken of its own funds to build its State Univer- 
sity. 
The next point that we desire to make is that the character 
and scope of the work of the University of Tennessee is to be 
determined not entirely by these more recent land-grant acts, 
as some persons seem to think, but by the provisions of all of the 
acts of incorporation, beginning with the act for the establish- 
ment of Blount College. The later acts are merely additions and 
extensions of this. They confirm the obligation and extend the 
scope of the institution, but they do not do away with anything 
that preceded. First, the General Assembly of the Territory and 
then the General Assembly of the State established an institution 
of iiberal education and endowed it with the proceeds of the sale 
of public lands belonging to all the people of the State and not to 
any one class, even that large class made up of the tillers of the 
soil. The University of Tennessee never was intended to be and 
never can be an institution for any one class. [It never was 
intended to be and never can be anything less than a college of 
liberal arts and sciences for all the people of Tennessee. To this 
the Government has added a college of agriculture and tech- 
nology, but when it did so, it did not thereby destroy the college 
of liberal arts and sciences. Its trustees hold an ancient 
charter for the State University and everything which has been 
done since the establishment of Blount College has only con- 
firmed and strengthened them in their purpose to build such an 
institution just as rapidly as the means therefor were provided. 
It is only necessary to recur to the different charter acts of 
the University to establish this proposition. The act for the 
establishment of Blount College, passed September 10, 1794, 
states that its purpose is to establish a seminary of education 
“where youth may be habituated in an amiable, moral and 
virtuous conduct, and accurately instructed in the various 
branches of useful science and in the principles of the ancient 
and modern languages.” The two acts of 1807, establishing the 
East Tennessee College, tovk up and confirmed the above 
purpose, merely changing the name of the institution. The 
Legislature of 1840 changed the name of the institution to East 
Tennessee University, without changing its character or the 
scope of its work. 
We come next to the Land-Grant Act for agricultural and 
mechanical colleges referred to above. The land scrip donated
-P-A-G-E-377
--830— 
to the State of Tennessee by the United States by that act was 
accepted by the General Assembly of 1869 and turned over to the 
Trustees of the East Tennessee University, without changing the 
character of the former institution. The Trustees were merely 
instructed that they should establish a college “so as to strictly 
conform with the Congressional enactment making the appro- 
priation.” It should be noted here that the acceptance of this 
grant from the United States and its transferrence to the East 
Tennessee University did not relieve the State of Tennessee from 
the obligation to maintain a State University, as established 
under the Constitution and laws explained in the first part of 
this discussion. The new college was not to be a substitute for, 
but a part of this State University. The fact that the National 
Government endowed the new college did not relieve the State of 
Tennessee from its obligation to maintain the old one. The two 
colleges, the old and the new, were united, but by this act the 
old one should not have been destroyed or even absorbed. 
Tennessee’s great mistake was in not providing adequately for 
the liberal arts and sciences and the professional studies. Having 
turned over to them this endowment for the agricultural and 
mechanical college, the Trusttes of the University were without 
means to provide buildings and equipment for it and, worst of 
all, without means for extending their college of liberal arts and 
for establishing the professional departments that belong to a 
real state University. This mistake Tennessee should speedily 
rectify. 
The section of this act fixing the purpose and scope of the 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts reads as follows: 
“The endowment, support and maintenance of at least one 
college where the leading object shall he, without excluding 
other scientific and classical studies and including military tac- 
tics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agri- 
culture and the mechanic arts in such manner as the Legisla- 
tures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to pro- 
mote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes 
in the several pursuits and professions of life.” (Section 4, Act 
approved July 2, 1862.) 
It will be seen at once that the provision does not nullify the 
original purpose of the college, but only extends it. It has been 
so frequently misstated and misunderstood that it seems advisa- 
ble to again expound its meaning. 
It is to be noted, first, that while the leading object shall be
-P-A-G-E-378
—331— 
to teach the branches of learning related to ‘agriculture and the 
mechanic arts, other scientific and classical studies are not to be 
excladed. Secondly, we are not told that practical agriculture 
and mechanic arts are the only things to be taught, but that the 
colleges are to teach the ‘ branches of learning related thereto.” 
And thirdly, their general object is to promote the “liberal and 
practical education of the industrial classes in the several pur- 
suits and professions of life.” The first general object mentioned 
is thus the liberal education, the second is the practical educa- 
tion. 
It cannot be believed that Congress meant to establish an in- 
stitution for any class. The discussion of the bill and the his- 
tory of these institutions clearly teach us that Congress did have 
in mind training broadly and liberally the future industrialists 
of all classes. Down to the time of the establishment of these 
colleges, there had been no institutions in our country for scien- 
tific and technical education. The old literary colleges trained 
only for the so-called learned professions. It was recognized that 
any boy could get an education for these learned professions, but 
that there was no place for him to get training for the industrial 
professions. The object of these institutions. then, was to sup- 
ply this great want; that is, to provide both “a liberal and prac- 
tical education” for the young people who wish to enter the in- 
dustrial professions. The language is broad; it says, ‘the in- 
dustrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.” 
We see, therefore, how absurd it is to claim that these insti- 
tutions are designed exclusively for the sons of farmers and 
mechanics. They were designed to give a liberal and _ practical 
education to young persons desiring to become farmers and me- 
chanics, but they were also to train persons for all the other 
‘pursuits and professions in life.” 
If, therefore, the University of Tennessee had omitted the 
“‘ other scientific and classical studies” and denied its students 
the opportunity to study them when they wanted to do so, it 
would have positively disobeyed this law just as clearly as if it 
had omitted entirely “the branches of learning related to agri- 
culture and mechanic arts.” 
The author of this bill has himself, in an often published 
letter, confirmed this interpretation of the act. He says: “The 
act did not proceed upon any exclusive idea, but indicated the 
leading purpose without excluding other classical and scientific
-P-A-G-E-379
—332— 
education. You will see it is very broad and liberal. I should 
hope that no farmer or mechanic would be so illiberal as to wish 
to have the monoply of education in any of there land grant 
colleges.” 
Congress reaffirmed these purposes and extended the scope of 
the colleges in the act of August 30, 1890, making additional ap- 
propriations to them. This was also written and championed by 
Senator Morrill. In that act the purpose of the grant is said to 
be “instruction in agriculture, mechanic arts, the English lan- 
guage and the various branches of mathematical, natural, and 
economic sciences.” Nothing could be broader or clearer than 
this. For the second time these institutions are expressly re- 
quired to teach, in addition to agriculture and mechanic arts, 
“the English language, and the various branches of mathemati- 
cal, natural and economic sciences.” The first act had expressly 
stipulated that “other scientific and classical studies” should 
not be excluded, and the second act affirms that the ‘English 
lauguage and the various branches of mathematical, natural and- 
economic sciences” must be taught. : 
It is a mistake to hold that even the sons of farmers and of the 
other industrial classes should be strictly limited to practical 
courses in agriculture or mechanic arts and not permitted to 
take “the scientific and classical studies,” which go to make up a 
liberal education. All institutions of learning testify that the 
farmers’ sons constitute a large proportion of their best students. 
They are the most ambitious young men who enter college, and 
are the first to seek a liberal education to fit them for the highest 
walks in life. It is not believed that the farmers of Tennesse 
‘would, if consulted, entertain for a moment a proposal to limit 
the education of their sons to practical agriculture or to mechanic 
arts. 
In accordance with these distinct requirements the Board of 
Trustees have arranged the courses of study in the University so 
that the farmer’s son who wants to study agriculture and the 
sciences related thereto can at the same time, if he chooses, get'a 
liberal education. He is required, in addition to agricultural 
sciences, to study English, history and economics, and is allowed’ 
to elect other literary studies if he chooses. He can even take 
up Latin or Greek. Who will dare. say that because he works 
upon the farm, or in the shop, the farmer’s son should be pro- 
hibited from studying his Latin or hisGerman? In accordance
-P-A-G-E-380
—333— 
with this interpretation of the law, it is the policy of the Univer- 
sity to permit the agriculturalist to’ do this, if he chooses, and if 
he completes his course, he receives a diploma representing an 
education as liberal and as broad as that taken by any other 
student in the institution. 
Ii the view here criticised were right, the sons of the farmers 
and of the other industrial classes would be limited in their edu- 
cation to the callings of their fathers and not permitted to rise 
above them if they could. This is the grossest conceivable per- 
version of the true theory of public education whose funda- 
mental principle is that any man’s son, no matter how humble 
his origin, or what his father’s calling may be, shall have an op- 
portunity in the public schools and in these State colleges, like 
the University of Tennessee, to prepare himself in the most lib- 
eral, thorough manner for any pursuit or profession in life that 
he may choose. This is the glory of these agricultural and 
mechanical colleges, that they take the children of the poorest 
people along with those of the rich and give them all a liberal 
education and an equal opportunity to attain the very highest 
positions in life. 
Before these institutions were founded the liberal education 
was only to be obtained by the sons of the rich. This view 
would rob the industrial classes of the greatest boon, the free 
liberal education, offered by these institutions, and destroy this, 
the chief glory of the colleges themselves. 
Some persons seem also to be under the impression that the 
Legislature can prescribe the manner in which this instruction 
is to be given, differently from that set forth in the act of 
Congress. 
By the act referred to above, the State of Tennessee accepted 
and adopted the provisions of the act of Congress providing the 
endowment for the college, and turned it over to the University 
of Tennessee, saying only: “It shall be the duty of the Trustees 
of the said University to strictly conform to the congressional 
enactment making the appropriation.” It there prescribed once 
for all the manner in which the law was to be carried out, and 
all that now remains for the General Assembly to do is to see 
that the acts of Congress are faithfully carried out: Any other 
construction of this act would lead to the absurd conclusion that 
every session of the General Assembly could prescribe instruction 
to be given to this institution. Such treatment would utterly 
destroy any college.
-P-A-G-E-381
—334— 
The important question is: Have the Trustees of the Univer 
sity of Tennessee made “ the leading object” of the institution, 
“without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and 
including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as 
are related to agriculture and mechanic arts?” The way to get 
a satisfactory answer to this question is to examine the expendi- 
tures, for land, buildings, machinery, apparatus, etc.; list of 
instructors employed, and to see whether the “branches of 
learning related to agriculture and mechanic arts” are properly 
represented. 
Jn order to do this, we must determine. first, which are “the 
branches of learning related to agriculture and mechanic arts?” 
Clearly, these are: chemistry, which teaches the composition of 
minerals, plants, soils, atmosphere, and all the products of the 
earth and their uses; physics, which explain the forces of nature 
and their workings; botany, which describes the kinds of plants, 
their structure and methods of growth; geology, which treats of 
rocks and their composition, and the changes that make them 
into soils; physiology and zoology, which teach of the families 
of animals, their development, growth, breeding, products, ete. 
Secondly: What are “the branches of learning related to 
mechanic arts?” Amoug these are: mathematics, the science 
of numbers; physics, again, especially in its applications in steam 
engineering and electrical engineering; chemistry and metal- 
lurgy, which treat of the materials out of which all buildings and 
machines are constructed, and the methods of their preparation 
and manufacture; civil engineering, which teaches how to put 
materials together in houses, bridges, and structures of all kinds; 
and mechanical engineering and machine design, which teaches 
bow to put them together in machines and implements for doing 
his work. Drawing is used in all these arts, and must, therefore, 
be taught in connection with all of them. 
Let us next see how the departments, or schools, in the 
University of Tennessee accord with the laws establishing it. 
The University divides itself, first, into two great departments: 
I. the College: IJ. the University. The University so far 
contains only three professional departments, viz., the Depart- 
ment of Law, located at Knoxville, and the Departments of 
Medicine and of Dentistry, located at Nashville. Efforts have 
been made to develop a graduate department in connection 
with the Academic Department of the College, but it has not
-P-A-G-E-382
335 — 
been possible to accomplish much in this line owing to the want 
of additional library and laboratory equipment and a larger 
teaching staff. The Departments of Law, Medicine and Dentistry 
receive no financial support from the land grant or other funds 
of the University and may, therefore, be omitted from further 
discussion at this place. 
The college, which is the main thing under discussion, has 
five departments, which were planned to carry out the require- 
ments of the law. These departments are: 
1. The Agricultural Department, giving instruction in the 
sciences pertaining to agriculture. 
2. The Engineering Department, giving instruction in the 
sciences pertaining to mechani¢ arts as illustrated in mechanical, 
electrical and civil engineering, and in chemistry and mining 
engineering. 
8. The Literarv Department, giving instruction in “ other sci- 
entific and classical” and in the.“ English language and the 
various branches of mathematical, natural and economical sci- 
ences,” as required in the Morrill Act. 
Closely related with the latter department is: 
4, The Department of Education, recently organized in the 
University for the purpose of giving instruction in the history 
and philosophy of education, -cience and art of teaching and 
methods of teaching special new branches. 
5. The Industrial Department, located at Knoxville College, 
for colored students. The laws of ‘Tennessee direct, “That no 
citizen of this State, otherwise qualified, shall be excluded from 
the privileges of the University by reason of his race or color; 
but the accommodations for persons of color shall be separate 
from the white.” The State, having failed to provide any sepa- 
rate accommodations—buildings, lands or shops—and the Uni- 
versity being debarred from using any of its funds for this pur- 
pose, the trustees were constrained to make a contract with 
Knoxville College to provide this equipment while it pays for 
the teachers and the instruction of colored State students ap- 
pointed in the usual way. It is now appropriating some $6,000 
a year for this purpose. The instruction given corresponds as 
nearly as possible with that provided for whites in the college, 
special emphasis being put upon the industrial branches. 
For a nearer view of the work of these several departments,
-P-A-G-E-383
—836— 
the‘reader must be referred to the announcements of the Uni- 
versity, particularly the one for 1904-5. It will be there seen 
that the University is teaching the sciences pertaining to agri- 
culture and mechanic arte, without excluding other scientificand 
classical studies and including the English language and the va- 
rious branches of natural, economic and mathematical sciences 
and military science, as is required by the law. 
We take up the Agricultural Department, by way of illustra- 
tion. The schools of instruction are as follows: Agriculture, 
agronomy, animal industry, dairy husbandry, botany, horticul- 
ture and forestry, geology, veterinary science, agricultural chem- 
istry and meteorology. The University has expended more 
money in proportion upon the equipment of this department 
and the laboratories for the sciences pertaining to agriculture, 
and annually expends more upon their amendment than for any 
other department of the University. The department has a 
large building, Morrill Hall, and plant houses on the University 
grounds. It also has two large farms—one for agriculture and 
one for horticulture—with good office buildings, extensive barns, 
dairy laboratory, cottages for farm hands, etc. At present there 
are 160 animals on the University farm: Dairy herd, 47; bdef 
animals, 32; horses used, 10; hogs under experiment, 50, etc, 
Twenty-five acres of land are devoted to plat experiments, and 
more than 1,200 plats are kept up. Upon the horticultural farm 
are varieties of all the leading fruits cultivated in this climate. 
The Engineering Department contains schools of mathemat- 
ics, civil engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and pharmacy; 
physics and electrical engineering, drawing and mechanical en- 
gineering and mechanic arts. This department is chiefly devo- 
ted to laboratories in Science Hall. They include extensive 
laboratories for chemistry, metallurgy and pharmacy for physics 
and electricity, and drawing rooms and recitation rooms for civil 
engineering. Estabrook Hall was erected without aid from the 
State, especially for use in this department. It contains boiler 
and engine rooms, foundry and forge, shops, hydraulic and steam- 
testing laboratory, wood shops, machine shops and tool rooms 
for the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic 
Arts. The University has never had the means with which to 
complete this building as originally planned, but the apartments 
completed are fully equipped and always crowded with students. 
‘The trustees have done the best they possibly could and have
-P-A-G-E-384
—337— 
utilized their resources to the utmost extent to provide the facil- 
ties for instruction in these Departments of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts. Additional buildings and equipments are re- 
quired, but they must look to the State to provide them, as they 
are prohibited from using funds under their control for building 
purposes. 
This with regard to the instructors and expenditures of the 
University: The Agricultural and Engineering Department, 
representing the “ leading object ” have the largest number and 
the largest appropriation. In fact, the expenditures of this de- 
partment have been pushed to such a degree as to seriously 
cramp the other departments. 
We have sought thus to show that the University of Tennes- 
see held a charter for a broad institution of liberal culture before 
it ever received the land grant funds, and that the land grant 
act itself and the Morrill act supplementary thereto both ex- 
pressly provided for “ other scientific and classical studies” and 
for the various English, historical and economic studies that be- 
long to a liberal education. It has also been shown that the 
trustees of the University have, in the organization of their in- 
stitution, made sciences pertaining to agriculture and mechanic 
arts the “leading object,” as the laws required, and have devoted 
a large share of their funds to the equipment and maintenance of 
this department. That the trustees have been able to do this 
and to equip these departments as extensively as they have, en- 
tirely without State aid (except the $10,000 appropriated for the 
purchase of land) is a remarkable fact in the history of the insti- 
tution during the last fifteen years. These trustees, instead of 
being criticised, should be highly commended for their wise and 
faithful administration of the laws and the success which they 
have had in the development of the institution. It is truly 
wonderful that they have done so much; it is inconceivable that 
they could have done more than they have done under the cir- 
cumstances. Instead of receiving criticism and detraction the 
trustees of the University should be commended and assisted. 
The people of the State should come earnestly to their support 
and make the University of Tennessee what it was designed to 
be, a great and complete institution for a “liberal and practical 
education.” The great need of the University at present is bet- 
ter buildings. The original buildings, constructed in the early 
days when the board had very little money, were of a plain and 
22
-P-A-G-E-385
—838— 
simple character and are’ now rapidly approaching that condition 
in which repairing is almost impossible. The institution has 
suffered for many years. It needs a great central academic hall 
for lecture rooms and offices; it needs larger and better dormi- 
tories for its students; it also needs to have its mechanical and 
agricultural buildings enlarged and better equipped ; it needs, 
above everything else, additional funds for the support of these 
more expensive departments. It is to be hoped that the people 
of the State may be brought to consider these needs and that the 
next General Assembly may provide some of. them, 
The Summer School of the South is a separate institution 
from the University, but it has received so much indirect aid 
from it and its work is so intimately connected with the educa- 
tional work of the State that it is believed a brief statement of 
the results of its last session’s work is appropriate in this place. 
The third session of the Summer School of the South was 
held at the University from June 28 to August 5, inclusive. 
The school was in session five days of each week, making thirty 
full days devoted to actual work. . 
One hundred and thirty separate courses were given; 115 ex- 
tended through the full term of six weeks, 15 were shorter 
courses. Sixty-four general lectures were given. There were 
8,456 class lectures and recitations. The attendance upon classes 
ranged from 6 to 200. 
The regular faculty contained 75 of the most eminent teach- 
ers and instructors of this country, including many members of 
the faculty of the University of Tennessee. The total number 
of students registered this term was 1,312—456 men, 856 women. 
These came from 37 States and countries, all the Southern States 
being represented. There were 432 from the Southern States 
outside of Tennessee. Five hundred and sixty-one students re- 
ported themselves as college graduates. Some 100 teachers and 
superintendents of schools spent a few days at the school exam- 
ining its work, and are not included in the above. There were 
175 children in the model schools and classes. 
It is the unanimous opinion of the students and the faculty 
that the work of this session was much better than of any other 
former one, and that the total value of the school was much 
greater, although the attendance was smaller. We quote a 
few expressions of appreciation from the reports of the pro- 
fessors: Dr. G. Stanley Hall, after spending two weeks in the
-P-A-G-E-386
—339— 
Summer School, said that he had “ never seen such work done 
at any summer school or any summer session of the great uni- 
versities.” Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, Professor of English Litera- 
ture, University of North Carolina, said: ‘As universities 
complete colleges, so this Summer School completes other sum- 
mer schools. It is a necessary culmination.” Dr. B. C. Greg- 
ory, Superintendent of Schools, Chelsea, Mass., said: ‘I know 
of no other organization that compares with the Summer School 
of the South.” Prof. W. K. Tate, Principal of the High School, 
Charleston, 8. C. said: ‘It is doing a work much needed in the 
South, which no other institution is doing. Ido not see how 
the organization could be improved.” Prof. J. W. Sewell of 
Nashvill said: ‘The best general result of the school is the in- 
creased respect given the teachers for their own section and the 
strong aspiration toward what is better in schools of all kinds 
every where.” 
Each student was requested to make a report of the work done 
and the impression received. Only two expressions can be 
quoted here. A Southern teachersays: ‘This school will surely 
prove a most potent factor in raising soon the educational status 
of the South to that of the North. I feel that I’ve gained more 
from this six weeks than from a six weeks spent last summer at 
the University of Chicago.” A Northern teacher says: “It 
seems to me that the value of this school to the South as a whole 
is beyond computation. For the great benefits I have received, 
not only in the increased knowledge I came here to get, but in 
the increase knowledge of the noble Southern people and in 
reverence for them, I shall always be grateful.” 
The usual conferences and conventions for the discussion of 
Southern educational questions were held. The Fourth of July 
was celebrated by a great meeting for the discussion of the gen- 
eral educational needs of the South and the opinions of the 
thousand or more teachers assembled from all portions of our 
country were given form in the following resolutions: 
DEcLARATION oF PRIncIPLES, SUMMER ScHOOL 
oF THE Soutn, 1904. 
We, teachers and citizens, students of the Summer School of 
the South, representatives of every Southern State and of every 
phase of educational service, assembled to celebrate this day of 
our national independence, desire to voice our sense of gratitude
-P-A-G-E-387
—340— 
for the heritage handed down to us by our fathers and to express 
our sense of responsibility to the generations that are to come. 
As an expression of our patriotism and of a courage born of the 
consciousness of power to enlarge the freedom which we this day 
celebrate, we unite in the following declaration: 
1. That the genius of democracy implies opportunity made 
universal; opportunity given to every man to live according to 
his capacity the life of highest meaning to himself and of largest 
service to humanity. 
2. That the mutual relations of individual and collective in- 
terests in our society are such that the ignorance of one individ- 
ual or of one class becomes a menace to the security of the social 
whole and a handicap to its every member, while the intelligence 
and efficiency of each individual contributes to the wealth and 
opportunity of all; that every child born into the State thus be- 
comes at once a social asset and a social charge; that the educa- 
tion of all the children of all the people into the highest degree of 
efficiency is the chief problem and the supreme duty of our de- 
mocracy. 
3. That since more than 80 per cent of our people live in 
the country and for generations to come must continue to live 
under rural conditions, we express our gratitude for the steady 
progress of the rural school and pledge our continued cooperation 
with the forces now at work for the increase of local taxation for 
schools, the lengthening of terms, and the improvement of houses 
and equipment. 
4, That we commend the policy which seeks to consolidate 
and centralize schools and to make these consolidated schools 
vital centers of community life. 
5. That the rural library is an essential instrumentality in 
overcoming the isolation of rural life and in bringing the child 
and the community into relation with the larger life of humanity. 
6. That, to the traditional curriculum which educated the 
child away from his environment and prepared him for leisure 
or for the learned professions, should be added the sciences and 
the modes of expression which will give him mastery over nature 
and over himself—this to the end that he may honor labor and 
find joy in produtive activity ; that his surroundings may be made 
his instruments, and that the plot of earth upon which he lives 
may become at once the fit environment and the fit expression 
of a worthy life.
-P-A-G-E-388
—341— 
7. That the consolidated school with its reconstructed curri- 
culum and improved machinery is after allso much dead mate- 
rial which must be quickened by the personality of the teacher. 
Our progress in material facilities emphasizes the call for edu- 
cated teachers and we appeal to our States to meet this need by 
the more adequate provision and equipment of high schools and 
normal schools. 
8. That the fine educational enthusiasm, the passion for serv- 
vice now so manifest throughout the South calls for an adequately 
trained leadership to direct it into the channels of constructive 
activity. The greatest educational need of the hour is educa- 
tional statesmanship and directive capacity in the office of super- 
intendent, supervisor, and principal. To supply this need we 
appeal to our States for a more generous support of our State 
universities now entering upon a career of larger life and greater 
efficiency. 
9. That for the adequate training of leadership the South is in 
need of an educational West Point. In the Summer School of 
the South we find a suggestion of the possibilities of a central 
teachers’ college permanently endowed and adequately equipped. 
Such an institution would supplement and reinforce local en- 
deavor at every point and would perform a function which no 
State institution can undertake. 
10. That we acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the General 
Education Board and to the friends of education who have so 
generously cooperated with them in making possible this Sum- 
mer School. Its helpful influence has already been felt in every 
State in the South and in every grade of educational service. 
We desire to express our grateful appreciation of what it has 
already accomplished, and our hope that it has only just begun 
its service in the cause of Southern education. 
On the last day of the-school a meeting was held for a 
comparison of views and a discussion of the future of this school. 
Mr. J. P. Selman, Superintendent of Schools, Troy, Ala., was 
appointed by the students to voice their opinion. Among other 
things, Mr. Selman said: ‘‘These thirteen hundred teachers 
have come in touch with one of the strongest faculties on the 
American continent—a faculty made up of men and women 
whose skill in their departments has been matched with the 
interest and zeal of their students. No better fortune has come 
to the teachers of the South than this sympathetic relation,
-P-A-G-E-389
~342— 
representing every section of the nation. It leads to a more 
liberal culture, a broader and truer Americanism. It is clearly 
seen that the Summer School, while it has done so much to bring 
about an educational awakening throughout the South, has just 
begun to place itself where it can bea permanent force. It is 
just now in a position where it can be the medium of the most 
efficient service. There is imperative need that it be continued 
as a distinctive institution. This does not mean the slightest 
criticism against the summer schools of the different States, 
which in their own sphere can do much toward raising the 
standard of teaching. By all means let them be sustained. But 
the Summer School of the South, established for all the teachers 
of the South and comprising so many problems of education, 
must mean more for Southern development than any institution 
under the auspices of a single State. Not one of these schools 
could possibly secure a faculty equal to that which has made the 
school at Knoxville so desirable. The association of teachers | 
from every part of the South assures greater breadth of view, and 
deepens the sense of a community of interests to a degree 
obtainable by no other means. It would be folly to inhibit a 
long career of usefulness, having made such a successful begin- 
ning.” 
The school this year cost the total sum of $22,836.25. The 
fund was contributed: $10,000 by the General Education Board, 
$9,457.55 subscribed by people of Knoxville, Knox County and 
friends on the outside, and $3,462 was collected in fees of 
students. The fee for all the privileges of the school was only * 6. 
Subscribers obtained a large number of free entrances in the 
school for their friends. The subscription of Knox County, for 
example, admitted all of its teachers free of charge. 
The school has equipment in the form of pavilions, furniture 
and apparatus, and lodging and boarding equipment, of cost 
value of some $13,000. We sincerely hope that it may be carried 
on even more successfully in the future than in the past. 
In submitting this, my last annual report on the University of 
Tennessee, I wish to thank you forthe generousassistance you have 
given us in all our endeavors and to congratulate you upon the 
success of your labors for the public schools. It has been a great 
pleasure to cooperate with you in this educational work in Ten- 
nessee, and it is with deep regret that I now leave it. On doing
-P-A-G-E-390
343 
so it is a great pleasure to know that the good work will go for- 
ward under your direction. : 
Let me also use this opportunity to express my deep sense of 
gratitude to my friends in Tennessee who have given their help 
in the work for the University and for the advancement of the 
educational interests of the State. To the people of Knoxville 
and Knox County, and especially to the members of the County 
Court of Knox and of the Chamber of Commerce of Knox- 
ville, I tender my most grateful acknowledgments. Individu- 
als, commercial and civic bodies in this county have contributed 
in the last three years some $40,000 to the various educational 
interests under our care, a sum, as far as I know, not equalled 
by any community in our section. To each and all I tender my 
sincere thanks with the hope and beliet that the noble service 
thus begun will grow in volume and strength with the years. 
In my letter of resignation I endeavored to make my grate- 
ful acknowledgments to the Board of Trustees of the University 
of Tennessee, but I wish to here again bear testimony to the de- 
votion and faithfulness of this body of public servants. Always 
wise, conservative and far-sighted in the whole history of the 
institution since I have known it, they have never Jost a dolar 
from carelessness or error. The entire property of the institu- 
tion has been steadily improved while the regular expenditures 
of the institution have increased rapidly with the attendance. 
That the trustees have been able to accomplish this without 
State aid is sufficient evidence of their remarkable sagacity and 
efficient business management. A board which can accomplish 
such results certainly deserves to be entrusted with ample re- 
sources with which to develop the great institution under their 
care. 
In conclusion I wish to congratulate the people of Tennessee, 
the trustees and the students and alumni upon the advent of 
Dr. Brown Ayres, who comes under these favorable auspices to 
take the presidency of the University in the future. I beg that 
the people of Tennessee will give him cordial support in all he 
undertakes to do, and I predict for him a successful career in the 
responsible position which I am happy to turn over to so distin- 
guished a scholar and able an executive. 
Very respectfully, 
Cuartes W. DaBney, 
August 20, 1904. President.

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
Srr—The University of Nashville is composed of the Peabody 
College for Teachers, with the Winthrop Model School; the 
Medical Department, and the Montgomery Bell Academy. 
As the first named derives a material part of its income from 
the State of Tennessee, I have made for it a separate report, to 
which, for full information, you are respectfully referred. 
The total enrollment the past year in all departments of the 
University was 1,264. The total number of instructors 64. 
Tus MepicaL CoLLEGE. 
. The Medical College has had another year of success, with a 
larger enrollment than in any previous year. The department 
was opened for the instuction of students in medicine, October 
11, 1850. With three exceptions it is the oldest school of 
medicine in the South, and is an integral part of the University 
of Nashville, which was founded in 1785 by the State of North 
Carolina. 
The session comprises two terms of six months each. The 
first, or fall term, commenced. October 1, 1904,and closes March 
31,1905. The second, or spring term, commences January 2, 
1905, and closes June 30, 1905. Attendance upon either term 
entitles the student to a time credit of one year; and a complete 
course of instruction is given during each term. Final examina- 
tions are held at the close of each term, in March and June 
respectively. Students may enter the University for a regular . 
and official course either in October or January. At the close of 
each term tickets are issued in accordance with the regulations of 
the Southern Medical College Association of which the institu- 
tion isa member. The required time of study for the degree of 
Doctor of Medicine is four years. 
The curriculum covers the entire field of modern instruction in 
Medicine and Surgery, including all the specialties and twenty- 
three lecture courses, seven laboratory courses, and three hours 
daily of hospital instruction. The laboratories are thoroughly 
equipped with modern apparatus and appliances, and the 
following courses are offered: Chemistry, Histology, Anatomy,

Physiology, Pathology, Bacteriology and Operative Surgery. 
The hospital instruction includes clinical work in the Nashville 
City Hospital, the University of Nashville Free Dispensary, St. 
Thomas Hospital and toe Woman’s Hospital of Tennessee. 
The Faculty is composed of thirteen professors and fourteen 
lecturers, assistants, and demonstrators, all of whom are graduates 
in medicine, The attendance for the past year was 301, and the 
number of graduates for the year, 41. 
The tuition fees are as follows: matriculation $5, payable on 
or before entrance; tuition $30 per qnarter (three months). In 
the senior year there is a graduation and diploma fee of $25. 
These fees cover all charges of every kind payable to the Univer- 
sity, and no extra or side charges are allowed. The Dean of the 
Faculty is Dr. William G. Ewing, and the Secretary, Dr. Dillard 
Jacobs. : 
Tue Monteomery BELL ACADEMY. 
This Academy is the preparatory department of the Univer- 
sity of Nashville; its graduates enter the leading universities 
without examination, its certificates of graduation being regarded 
as a guaranty of proficiency. 
It has a seven years’ course of study—three years in the 
Grammar School Department, and four years in the High School 
Department. In the latter department there is a classical course 
looking to the degree of B. A.; a Latin-scientific course, looking 
to the degree of B. S., and also an English and business corrse. 
The Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville has set 
aside for the exclusive use of the Academy a large campus and 
has erected thereon a commodious two-story brick building, with 
the necessary stables to accommodate the students who ride or 
drive from the country. 
Athletic games of all kinds are encouraged and proper 
provision made for them; athletics, however, are subordinated to 
scholarship. 
The endowment of the Academy by Mr. Bell guaranties its 
permanency. 
Twenty-five scholarships are in force, given to boys from ten 
to fourteen years of age, ten for Davidson, and five each for 
Williamson, Dickson, and Montgomery counties. 
The esprit de corps of the institution is excellent. Its graduates 
stand high in both the professional and the business world.
-P-A-G-E-395

Few, if any, of the schools in the South are so well equipped 
in physical and chemical apparatus, and the reference library is 
a valuable adjunct. 
The attention given to reading, elocution, spelling and 
writing, as well as the number of teachers, is a marked feature of 
the school. 
The institution meets the demands of the community, and is 
doing excellent work. It is an honor to its founder.

PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
Sir—I submit my report as President of the Peabody College 
for Teachers for the year which closed August 3, 1904: 
The work of all the three terms, two winter terms of sixteen 
weeks each and one summer term of eight weeks, has been satisfac- 
tory from every standpoint. While the attendance was slightly 
smaller than that of preceding years, this was foreseen as the 
effect of the announced intention of the Peabody Board. to dis- 
continue the two hundred scholarships it has maintained in the 
‘college for so many years. It has long been the policy of the college 
in awarding scholarships to prefer students already in attendance, 
so that in addition to those in possession of scholarships there 
were always many who attended with the expectation of obtain- 
ing them the next year. Both of these classes are now eliminated. 
The general scholarship of the students was measurably bet- 
ter than for previous years; more of them brought diplomas 
from other colleges; more of them were found qualified for col- 
lege work and fewer had conditions imposed upon them for fail- 
ure'to reach the standards prescribed for entrance and for gradu- 
ation than heretofore. 
The Summer School, of which the third annual term termi- 
nated August 8, was pronounced by Prof. C. E. Little, its superin- 
tendent, to be “decidedly more satisfactory than ever before.” 
The session was lengthened to eight weeks to enable the stu- 
dent to do in this time the same amount of work in any branch

offered, as in a term of four months, but he is limited to half the 
number of courses. Students who from ill health or want of in- 
dustry have fallen behind their classes of the winter sessions 
have, by devoting the summer session to the branches in which 
they were deficient, been able to obtain their diplomas without 
returning to college another year; an important matter to young 
people of limited resources anxious to utilize all their time and 
means. Another object of the summer session is that of per- 
mitting teachers who are closely confined to the schoolroom dur- 
ing the winter, to learn whatever is new in the art and science of 
teaching, and this is by far its most important office. 
Manual training, which has not yet been made part of the 
winter and of the college courses, has been taught successfully 
in all the summer sessions. The instruction in this course has 
been given with the view of qualifying teachers to impart it to 
their pupils. 
The table hereto attached shows the number of students tak- 
ing each course of study in the winter and the summer session :

see; at end of summer session to 23, 13 from Tennessee. 
The degree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred by the Univer- 
sity of Nashville at end of winter session upon 19, 6 from Ten- 
nessee; Bachelor of Science, 11, 2 from Tennessee; Bachelor of 
Letters, 2, 1 from Tenzessee. 
Since the organization of the college in 1875, the number of 
students in attendance is ten thousand six hundred and sixty- 
nine (10,669), of whom five thousand and forty-four (6,044) were 
from Tennessee. The total number receiving diplomas, two 
thousand seven hundred and forty (2,740). 
This report would not be complete without some reference to 
the death, February, 1904, of the Dean of the College, Dr. Wiill- 
jam Robertson Garrett. The institution had no truer friend;

no one was more ready to work for its welfare or give to its ad- 
vancement the benefit of a sound and refined judgment. . His 
reputation as an educator was national, and not only the college, 
but the country has sustained a loss by his death. Prof. Wick- 
liffe Rose, an alumnus, and formerly a professor of this college, 
but more recently of the University of Tennessee, has been se- 
lected as Dean in place of Dr. Garrett.

This school was established to enable the students of the col- 
lege to study daily the proper method of imparting instruction 
to pupils in every grade of ordinay school work. For some years 
its course corresponded with the ten grades of the city schools ; but 
for the past two years this has been so changed that there are 
now eight grades, corresponding to the first eight grades of the 
city schools, and two additional years of work intended to pre- 
pare students for the college. 
Special emphasis is placed on the work of the first three 
grades as affording fine opportunity for observation of the 
development of the child from its first entrance to the school- 
room, 
The instruction of three grades is in the hands of a teacher 
thoroughly familiar with primary methods, and who has charge 
of the same branch in the college course. Students of the col- 
lege are required to attend the sessions of the Model School at 
stated times and familiarize themselves with both the theory 
and practice of primary instruction. 
Manual training, physical culture and drawing have been 
made prominent features of the school work; the department 
of physical culture being in charge of the directress of the col- 
lege gymnasium and obligatory upon the pupils. 
The building was erected by an appropriation from the Pea- 
body Board of $12,000 in 1890, and was the first, if not the only 
instance of expenditure by that board for permanent improve- 
ments. The school has fine teachers, the majority of them 
graduates of the college, and the past year had 240 pupils, and it 
is believed is kept at a high point of excellence. 
Vouchers showing the manner in which the State appropria- 
tion has been expended to date are in your office. :

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, 
S1r—I have the honor to present to you the seventeenth an- 
nual report of this institution. 
The deportment of the children and young people, who have 
been pupils of the school, has been a constant wonder to us dur- 
ing the whole of the seventeen years of our work here and we 
can only account for it on this basis—that they, as a rule, are 
endowed with plenty of good native sense intertwined and inter- 
woven with moral courage and moral capacity. It is true that 
we have been many times sorely tried and perplexed. This edu- 
cation is compulsory. 
In almost every minutia of our system of training we find 
some one thing that proves distasteful to the pupil. It may be 
to the child the most important lesson of life, that which will 
probably prove of greatest value if pursued successfully. There 
should be no escape from it; no sentimental catering; the good 
people of the State of Tennessee pay for a thorough and varied 
education, according to capacity, and they should expect every 
dependent child to take advantage of the opportunities offered. 
We have received since opening the institution 3,414 pupils; 
2,608 were white boys, 603 were white girls, 202 were colored 
boys and one colored girl. We have dismissed since opening 
2,628 pupils; 2,096 were white boys, 367 were white girls, and 165 
were colored boys. 
We had remaining in school at the close of the fiscal year, 
December 19, 1903, 786 pupils; 594 of these are paid by the 
State, 100 by Davidson County and 92 by parents, guardians 
and friends. . 
During the past year we have received from all sources $84,- 
449.59. The following summary will show from what sources 
these receipts came: 
We have received from the State of Tennessee $61,258.04, 
from pay wards $20,532.68, from subscription to Boys’ Lantern 
$5, from refunded money account $159.96, from sale of live stock 
$1,812.25, also for service of brass band $100, which with the bal- 
ance in bank December 19, 1902, of $376.04, makes a total of © 
$84,449.59. We have expended on subsistence account $75,-
-P-A-G-E-406
—351— 
100.74, on furnishing account $3,006.51, on improvement ac- 
count $6,341.75. (These figures do not include special appro- 
priation of $4,000 for water supply, which was paid out after 
December 19, 1903, and will be accounted for in the next bien- 
nial report). We have an indebtedness December 19, 1908, of 
$3,734.07. Total disbursements $84,449, leaving a balance in 
bank December 19, 1903, of 59 cents. 
During the year our farm has been fairly productive; at times 
it was necessary to purchase vegetables and fruits, at other times 
these important factors of our living were abundant. We keep 
our land well fertilized with barnyard manure and from it we 
generally get from two to three crops a year. We raise princi- 
pally Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, peas, onions, lettuce, 
raddishes, butter beans, carrots, parnsips, beets, cabbages, cucum- 
bers and tomatoes. 
Our work shops and manual training features are a source of 
helpfulness. The children have at all times displayed a spirit 
of cheerful willingness in performing whatever duties have been 
assigned them, and have manifested an interest in and a desire 
to thoroughly master the trades and branches taught. How 
well they have succeeded in this laudable desire is abundantly 
evidenced by the fact that few, if any, of the young men learn- 
ing a business here fail to find steady employment at good sal- 
aries after dismissal from the institution. 
Of the 2,628 pupils who have left the school, many of whom 
are engaged in most of the leading trades, and some have entered 
the professions, many notable examples of their success might be 
cited. Only about twenty-five out of 3,000 have gone entirely 
wrong. 
The children are engaged in the following trades and indus- 
tries: Bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, arch- 
itectural and free hand drawing, printing, cabinet making, wood 
carving, furniture finishing, carpentry, Sloyd manual training, 
mattress making, upholstering, painting, barber shop work, 
broommaking, tailoring, blacksmithing, bread baking, harness 
and shoemaking, storekeeping, steam laundrying, work in ma- 
chine shops, care of steam boilers, plumbing, farming, vegetable 
gardening, floriculture, work in hotbeds, barn and care of stock. 
Each of these departments are helpful to the institution and 
children alike. All of the shoes, clothing, furniture, brooms, 
etc., consumed and used by the institution are made by the
-P-A-G-E-407
—352— 
pupils, The practicability of maintaining each of the foregoing 
departments is unquestionably of economical value and of 
greater import—helpful to the children. 
In their school work the children are doing nicely, and their 
conduct and advancement have been satistactory. 
General examinations for promotion are held annually, and 
individual test examinations are given as often as there is cause 
forsame. The daily school hours are divided into two sessions, 
the morning session extending from 7 until 11 o’clock and the 
afternoon session extending from 1 to 5 o’clock. 
The advantages of this system are many, inasmuch as it is 
made possible by its adoption to keep both manual and literary 
branches in operation during the entire day, thus affording op- 
portunities to a greater number of children to devote a portion 
of their time to some useful course of training. 
Our music departments continue to support the reputation 
they have established. Our brass band, composed of boys be- 
tween the ages of 12 and 17, is generally and favorably known 
throughout the State. There are also classes in vocal and instru- 
mental music at each department, which are arranged and di- 
rected by competent teachers. 
The official force of the institution has been effective in its 
efforts, collectively and individually, to promote the general 
welfare and advancement of the children. 
Many of these workers are young people who have been ben- 
eficiaries of the institution’s training—young people who as pu- 
pils have been educated and made useful for the work they are 
now performing. - 
The per capita allowance for each pupil entering this institu- 
tion has heretofore been placed at $100; this amount is entirely 
inadequate and should be placed at not less than $125 per an- 
num foreach pupil. Every year demonstrates the fact more and 
more that the per capita allowance of $100 is not sufficient to 
pay the teachers’ and officers’ salaries, clothe the children, pur- 
chase the school books, furnish beds and bedding, lights and fuel, 
lumber and tools, as well as keep the institution everywhere in 
good repair. We have algo to pay our physician’s salary, pay 
nurses, purchase medicines, etc., and all this must be done on a 
per capita of $8.334 per month. 
After all and above all, we have an abiding love for our work 
and pleasure in the performance of our various duties.
-P-A-G-E-408
—353— 
We are exceedingly grateful for the work we have been per- 
mitted to do for a period of 39 years, and feel grateful for the 
life and strength that has made possible our helpfulness. 
I cannot close this report without paying tribute to the young 
people who have labored with me during the past year. The 
greater portion of them have been faithful and earnest in the 
performance of every duty. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
W. C. Kitvineron, 
Superintendent.

SCHOOLS FOR THE COLORED. 
ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
The school year 1903-4 was one of the best in the history of 
the institution. More than the usual number of students came 
at the opening of the term and remained through the year, a 
feature that indicates, as much as increased enrollment, substan- 
tial advancement. 
Students to the number of 255, 149 male and and 106 female, 
were present from 15 States and Territories, and pursued studies 
from about the fifth grade of the public school through normal, 
college preparatory, full college and theological courses. 
Thorough and systematic instruction in sewing, including 
patching, darning and all sorts of mending, and in dressmaking, 
including cutting and fitting by measure, was given to all the 
girls in all departments, An exhibition of this work was made 
at commencement and attracted much favorable comment, Since 
. the vast majority of girls ultimately become wives and mothers, 
the makers and keepers of homes, too much emphasis can hardly 
be placed upon efficiency of the needle. 
Thorough instruction in singing was given to all students 
free of charge, and instruction in instrumental music to such as 
elected it for a slight extra charge. : 
A 16-page paper was published monthly throughout the school 
year. The composition and preparation for the press was the 
work of students in the school printing office. 
A new feature of the year was the inauguration of a corre- 
spondence department for the benefit of ministers who are una- 
ble to leave home and family to pursue residence study. Full 
courses were offered in all the subjects of the regular theological 
department. Thirty-one ministers in various parts of the State 
enrolled immediately, and most of them have pursued their 
studies faithfully and intelligently. 
It is inspiring to those who teach, and it must be interesting 
to all who desire the improvement of their fellowmen and the
-P-A-G-E-415
—358— 
uplift of the various communities of the State, to note the in- 
tense earnestness and dogged perseverance of these young people 
gathered in our schools. They are determined to get an educa- 
tion, and many maintain themselves through a series of school 
terms by their own efforts and earnings. 
This institution is at present represented by a body of over 
500 graduates from the various departments. All these gradu- 
ates, without a known exception, are loyal and law-abiding citi- 
zens, an inspiration to the young and a steadying, conservative 
force in their several communities. 
Particular emphasis has been laid during the past year, a8 in 
other years, upon the formation of right character, the cultiva- 
tion of habits of faithfulness, honesty and thrift. 
The prospects for the ensuing year are excellent, both as to 
numbers and material. 
Respectfully submitted, 
P. B. Guernsey, 
President. 
FISK UNIVERSITY. 
In making our annual report for your honor, I am very glad 
to say that Fisk University during the scholastic year of 1903-4 
was remarkably successful. We catalogued the largest number 
of students that we have had for inany years, and we are partic- 
ularly strong in those departments upon which we place em- 
phasis, 
We graduated this year, as last, a class of 21 from our College 
Department, 14 young men and 7 young women. A majority 
of them had been with us during their entire collegiate course, 
seven years. They came from the North and South, Hast and 
West, and were hence quite cosmopolitan. The spirit of the 
class was excellent. There was profound loyalty to the institu- 
tion and a determination on the part of nearly all of them to fit 
themselves for lives of service, thereby following the motto of 
Fisk, ‘‘ Education for Service.” 
We had a very large musical department, as would naturally 
be expected in an institution with the history that Fisk has had.

—359— 
This department afforded us, in addition to the ordinary Jubilee 
Club, a College Glee Club of male voices, 21 in number, and 
another of women’s voices, 29 in number. 
The athletic life of the school, which is always made subserv- 
jent to the literary life and so arranged as to stimulate study, 
was of the usual character, the institution remaining, as it has 
for years, champion. 
It is the purpose of the faculty of the institution to make a 
constant study of conditions in the South, and to shape the cur- 
riculum of the school in such fashion as shall make the young 
men and young women who come to Fisk fitted to meet these 
conditions. Just now it is evident to those who look beneath 
the surface of things that the demand is very urgent for young 
men and young women who have become masters of themselves 
and thus are fitted for the leadership of others, especially in the 
professions and in business life. The roster of our alumni is 
very suggestive along this line. A large majority of those who - 
have graduated from our Normal and College Departments are 
teachers; and the movement going forward in the South looking 
toward a higher grade of schools is an incentive to us to fit our 
young people as fully as*our means will allow for this exacting 
profession. 
The kind of work that we are doing can perhaps best be 
estimated by the statement of the fact that a graduate of our 
school who received his A. B. at Fisk in 1903 received an A. M. 
from Yale in 1904, and it is his purpose to becomea teacher. We 
also bear in mind that the Southern country greatly needs well 
equipped negro physicians, and at the present time there are a 
goodly number of our recent graduates who are taking a medical 
course in Nashville, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia. It is 
their purpose, when thoroughly equipped by this four-years’ 
course, to settle in the South and stay, if possible, as far as they 
can, the tide of mortality which is so marked among the colored 
people of late. 
The opportunity for the colored young man to go into busi- 
ness has become more marked, and we are convinced that, with 
their heredity, young people of color who intend to go into bus- 
iness need the training of the college in order that they may 
come into possession of the patience and perseverance, the clear-

It is a gratifying fact that as the years go by institutions like . 
Fisk can make selection from the great number of applicants 
that ask for entrance and thus have the best of material to work 
upon. 
The interest shown in the work done by such schools as ours 
on the part of the school authorities of Tennessee, particularly 
your honored self as its head, is exceedingly gratifying, and it 
will be our aim in the future, as it has been in the past, to do all 
that we can for the young people who are to make their homes 
in this Southland and whose character and attainments have so 
much to do with the prosperity of the region which is so rapidly 
forging to the front.

LANE COLLEGE. 
Str—The honor is mine to report to you the work done at 
Lane College, Jackson. This is my report since being President 
of this institution. 
By far the majority of our students are from this State and 
are doing considerable service in the common schools. Those 
supported by State scholarships in Lane College have made com- 
mendable progress, 
This institution fills a very important place in the field of edu- 
cation for colored youth in West Tennessee. It isin reality the 
only institution that provides for higher education of colored 
youth in this part of the State. Its normal course is arranged 
with special reference to the betterment of the common schools 
by furnishing better prepared teachers. The opinion of this in- 
stitution is that the colored race will be lifted by well-fitted 
teachers in the common schools, and some institution of higher 
learning must do the preparation. Teachers are taught sewing, 
cooking, basketry, housekeeping and music in addition to their 
regular literary work. The coursé requires four years’ study 
after the English course has been completed. During the past 
year those engaged in normal studies numbered 30.
-P-A-G-E-420
—361— 
A regular English course is taught, beginning with the fifth 
grade. It is recognized that a great majority of our young peo- 
ple never get more than a common English education. There- 
fore considerable attention is given to this department, which is 
under the direction of well-prepared teachers. This department 
numbered last session 184, . 
In order to provide opportunity for the more talented of the 
race, so that intelligent and broad leaders may be trained, a college 
classical course is maintained. It is recognized that the questions 
confronting the colored race call for the exercise of the most 
broadly developed minds and that nothing can so effectually ac- 
complish this development as a college training, Between the 
college classical and the English course is supported a college pre- 
paratory course of three years’ work. Connected with all these 
departments is an industrial department. It is not the purpose 
to prepare well-equipped tradesmen but to train each student’s 
hands to the degree that he may do intelligent manual work, 
also teach the dignity of labor. Each student is required to do 
some manual labor each day. After a student has finished a 
course at Lane College, if he (or she) desires to learn a trade 
thoroughly, he (or she) is prepared to enter a trades school with 
a well-trained mind and skillful hands. The foundation fora 
trade is laid. In addition to these a musical and a theological 
department are supported. It is clear that the need of an edu- 
cated and moral ministry is great and this institution is endeav- 
oring to supply that need. 
The past session was a very successful one. Seven States were 
represented. The total enrollment was 267, almost equally di- 
vided between the sexes. The Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church furnishes the bulk of the financial support. The M. E. 
Church South also gives some aid. The other support is derived 
from contributions by the general public. The institution is at- 
tended. by students representing all denominations, also those 
who have no denominational ties. The purpose of the institution 
is to give every one a good Christian education and leave the 
student free to identify himself with whatever denomination he 
may choose. .

KNOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
Srr—The year-1903-4 has been in every respect a prosperous 
one. The total attendance in all departments reached 407. 
Seven students graduated from the College Department and 10 
from the Normal Department. The attendance the past year 
represented 21 States and Central America. . 
The teaching. force, including faculty, matrons and foremen, 
numbers 29. 
The Knoxville College is under the control of the United 
Presbyterian Church, being directly controlled by the Board. of 
Freedmen’s Missions of that church. By arrangement with the 
University of Tennessee the college is also the Industrial De- 
partment of the University for colored students. For this pur- 
pose the University makes an annual appropriation to pay for 
salaries of professors and foremen in the Industrial Department, 
equipment and a sum to pay for student labor. Aside from the 
funds received from the University, as indicated above, the col- 
lege is supported by the voluntary offerings of the church. 
Knoxville College stands for the most thorough training in an 
intellectual way, and at the same time provides for the most 
helpful industrial training. The courses of study offered are 
classical, scientific, theological, normal and common school. 
The Industrial Department offers training in agriculture, carpen- 
tering, electric work, printing, sewing, cooking, baking, brick- 
making and blacksmithing. The plant consists of 75 acres on 
which 12 buildings stand. 
Through the Industrial Department the students are given 
the very best opportunities for self-help. More than $2,500 are 
paid out annually for student labor, and many students, by 
working during the summer and through the year, are able to 
earn their expenses. 
_A new agricultural building is being erected and will be 
ready for use at the opening of the fall term. The money for 
this building was given by the citizens of Knoxville, and it bears 
testimony to the endorsement of the work by the best people of 
the city.

There have been ten State Normal students in attendance 
during the year under appointment by State Senators. 
The work that the college is doing is best seen in the lives of 
those who have gone out from it. The profession of teaching 
claims the largest number, the most of whom exhibit with their 
profession a most healthful example in industry by carrying on 
some manual art—farming, sewing, or some other useful occupa- 
tion. While in college students are taught that work is honor- 
able. They are encouraged to go back to their homes and devote 
their lives to the upbuilding of their fellow beings in the commu- 
nities where they have been reared. 
The expenses in the college are merely nominal. Tuition is 
only 50 cents a month. Boarding, heat, light and furnished 
room are provided for $6.85 per month. Very little charity 
help is given, but by furnishing work to worthy students and 
keeping the expenses at the very lowest, self-help is encouraged 
and the foundation laid for useful citizenship. 
A Summer Normal term of six weeks is provided for teach- 
ers, and it has met with marvelous success. The report of this 
is found elsewhere.

VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
Vanderbilt University was opened for work in 1875. At that 
time it included four departments, Academic, Law, Medical and 
Theological. The departments of Pharmacy and Dentistry were 
added in 1879, and Engineering in 1886. The founder of the 
university was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, 
whose gift of $1,000,000 was intended and accepted as a token of 
good will from the North to the South. The Vanderbilt family 
has continued to manifest their interest in the work of the 
university by making needed contributions from time to time. 
Mr. Wm. H. Vanderbilt gave about $500,000 for buildings and 
endowment. Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, grandson of the founder, 
erected an engineering building and made other contributions 
amounting altogether to $100,000. Mr. Wm. K. Vanderbilt lately 
erected a splendid dormitory, Kissam Hall, at a cost of nearly 
$150,000, and has made other contributions for current expenses. 
Contributions have also been made by many other benefactors 
until now the total property of the university amounts to two and 
one-third million dollars. The number of professors and 
instructors in al] departments numbers more than 100 and the 
total number of students is about 750 annually. The alumni of 
all departments number about 4,000 and are scattered largely 
over the whole South. 
Vanderbilt University has been noted for the strictness of its 
requirements and the thorough character of its work. Entrance 
examinations for the Freshman class are held all over the South 
and exert a stimulating effect on the work of many high schools. 
The policy of the university is to admit no student before he is 
prepared for its work, and in carrying out this policy a strong 
influence has been exerted on the educational systems of the South. 
The work of the university has also been strongly felt in the 
training of teachers. While it has no professional courses for
-P-A-G-E-431
—368— 
teachers, its literary graduates have in large numbers gone into 
school and college work, and are much sought after for such 
positions. 
The founding of Vanderbilt University marked an epoch in 
Southern education. Conditions were so adverse, the poverty of 
the South so great, that there was little hope or prospect of 
improvement. The gift of Commodore Vanderbilt, coming at 
such a time, made it possible for one institution, at least, to adopt 
a sound educational policy and work out high educational ideals. 
The success of this work was an inspiration and encouragement 
to others and has helped to make possible the splendid advance- 
ment of higher education in the South. 
BOLTON COLLEGE. 
Tue Romantic Story or THE Boiron CouiEGE. 
Bolton College was founded by and was named in honor of 
Wade H. Bolton, who for many years prior to the civil war did a 
large slave trading business in conjunction with his brothers. One 
of the brothers, Isaac L. Bolton, in a dispute as to whether a 
certain negro was a slave, killed a citizen of Kentucky. He was 
arrested for the crime and placed in the county jail. Great in- 
dignation was expressed at his act and a mob was organized to 
hang him, and he was only saved from an ignominious death 
through the intervention of Nathan Bedford Forrest and others 
who interceded for him. He was tried in the courts of Shelby 
County some two or three times, a mistrial being entered each 
time. He finally secured a change of venue to Tipton County, 
and after a number of mistrials was acquitted. Charges of bribery 
were preferred against the jurors in the case and some of the 
number were tried and convicted of that offense. The acquittal of 
Isaac L. Bolton of the killing of the Kentuckian was finally se- 
cured as stated, but the litigation cost him over $100,000. The
-P-A-G-E-432
—369— 
expense of the trials was borne by the partnership of which he 
was a member, but years after his death an effort was made to 
compel his brother, Wade H. Bolton, and his estate to bear the 
expenses of the different trials. The bitter feeling that was en- 
gendered finally led to the killing of Wade H. Bolton by his 
brother-in-law, Thomas Dickens. The tragedy occurred in Court. 
Square in 1869. 
A REMARKABLE WILL. 
Prior to his death, however, Mr. Bolton made his will, which 
is one of the most remarkable documents ever spread upon the 
public records of the county. Under the will the testator be- 
queathed the fund which established Bolton College. He also 
gave a bequest of $10,000 to the widow of Stonewall Jackson, 
who fell at the battle of Chancellorsville. 
_ James H. Malone has been the attorney of Bolton College for 
a number of years, and when Prof. Jones received the communi- 
cation from Supt. Mynders he requested Mr. Malone to prepare 
the history of Bolton College to be incorporated in the report of 
the State Superintendent. Mr. Malone has just completed that 
history, or historical sketch, of Wade H. Bolton and the Bolton 
College, and it is given below: 
A Srrrkmne CHARACTER. 
Wade H. Bolton, the founder of Bolton College, was one of the 
most striking characters of Shelby County and the city of Mem- 
phis. For many years prior to the civil war of 1861-65 he and 
his brothers did a very large business trading in slaves through- 
out the Southern States, their headquarters being at Memphis. 
A dispute having arisen as to whether acertain negro was a slave, 
Isaac L. Bolton killed at Memphis a citizen of Kentucky, which 
created profound feeling and was the sensation of the day. 
Though Isaac L. Bolton was acquitted, the expense of the various 
trials cost over $100,000. Years afterward, in the sattlement of 
the partnership affairs, the expense of this trial with the concur- 
rence of Wade H. Bolton was charged to the partnership, and the 
partnership wound up in 1857. Afterwards litigation was set on 
foot in Memphis by some members of the family, in which it was 
sought to saddle this expense upon Wade H. Bolton and the 
24
-P-A-G-E-433
—370— 
estate of his deceased brother Isaac. This created the bitterest: 
feeling possible that ever existed in Shelby County, and finally 
resulted in the killing of Wade H. Bolton in front of Court Square 
in Memphis by his brother-in-law Thomas Dickens, and who. 
shortly afterwards was killed by the accidental discharge of his 
own gun. This occurred in 1869, and in the previous year Wade 
H. Bolton had written his own will, a very lengthy document, as 
he declared, “at my plantation, at home in Shelby County, Tenn., 
this the 10th day of August, 1868.” The entire paper was in his 
own handwriting, and though the spelling and grammar were quite 
faulty, the will was written with remarkable vigor, clearness and 
force, and is one of the most remarkable testamentary papers 
ever placed upon record in this or any other State, and the entire 
document is copied word for word by the Supreme Court in its 
opinion now reported in 14 Lea, page 553. The testator gave 
large sums of $5,000 to $10,000 each to many of his relatives, 
but each of them was upon condition substantially as is con- 
tained in the seventh item of his will, which is as follows: 
“T give and bequeath to my niece, now Miss Wade Bolton, 
$5,000, provided she is and so remains a true and faithful friend 
of mine and does all she can to defeat this gigantic swindle of 
the old land pirate, Tom Dickens, and Sarah W. Bolton, his ally, 
against her father’s estate and mine in Chancery Court at Mem- 
phis, and the onus of proof shall be upon her to show she has 
done all she could to defeat the same.” 
A Propaecy FULFILLED. 
The eighth clause of the will is a very remarkable one and is 
as follows: 
“T give and bequeath my niece, Josephine Bolton, now the 
wife of the notorious Dr. Samuel Dickens (the Judas of the 
family), $5, one-sixth of what Judas Iscariot got for betraying 
the Lord. Poor Jo! Her cup of iniquity will be full after a 
while, if she ever gets time to stop her mad career, trying to help 
swindle her sister, and her mewory will let her mind reflect back 
upon her childhood days when she sat under the shade trees and 
roof of her father and mother and saw the streaming tears and 
heard the bitter sobs of her departed mother portraying in the
-P-A-G-E-434
—371— 
ears of her father that some distant day that old Tom Dickens 
would swindle them and their children out of all they had and 
bring them to need and want. The prophecy is fulfilled in 1868, 
and her daughter Jo is lending a helping hand.” 
As showing the broad spirit and patriotism of Mr. Bolton, 
the eleventh clause of his will is here quoted as follows: 
“JT give and bequeath to the widow and children of Gen. 
Thomas Jonathan Jackson, known as Stonewall Jackson, who 
fell at the battle of Chancellorsville, Va., $10,000, as history 
tells me his widow’s furniture was sold after his death for debt.” 
It is said that this is the only bequest or memento that has 
ever been bestowed by anyone upon the widow and in memory of 
the distinguished Stonewall Jackson. 
The next item commences as follows: 
“ Fidelity is the noblest trait of human beings and should be 
rewarded, therefore, I hereby give and bequeath to my loyal 
slaves, now called freedmen, that have stayed with me during 
the war, and have remained with me on my plantation ever since, 
in my employ or working my land and have never left it to work 
or labor on any other farm, to all of these that continue faithful 
in this way up to my death, I instruct my executor to pay the 
heads of families of all such $300, and to single ones $100 each 
that have no families.” 
By the fourteenth item of his will he left his Hoboken farm, 
in the First Civil District of Shelby County, and where he re- 
sided, to the trustees of the free schools of Shelby County, Ten- 
nessee, for the purpose of erecting a college of learning on the 
same, to be called Bolton College. By the fifteenth item of his 
will he gave all the residue and remainder of his estate not otherwise 
donated to the Chairman of the County Court of Shelby County 
to be loaned out on interest perpetually, and the accruing to be 
applied to the education ‘of the poor and orphan white children 
in the First District of Shelby County, Tennessee,” the fund so 
bequeathed to be perpetual. 
Mr. Bolton directed that his will should be published in one 
of the daily papers for thirty days after his death, and it was so 
done by his executor, the late Mr. E. M. Apperson.
-P-A-G-E-435
—3872— 
UPHELD BY Courts. 
It is but just to state that the courts of Tennessee concurred 
with Mr. Bolton in the position that the Chancery suit brought 
against him and which he styled “ The Gigantic Swindle,” was 
not well founded and that his estate was not indebted as claimed 
in the Chancery proceeding. His estate ran up in value to 
nearly half a million dollars, but a perfect sea of litigation ensued 
by and between the beneficiaries and thé executors and others, so 
that it was very greatly depleted, and the college reccived réally 
but a small part of what should have gone into its coffers, much 
of the estate being wasted in lawyers’ fees, court costs and use- - 
less expenses. : 
The provisions of the will being very meager aid no scheme 
being provided or details given as to what kind of a college 
should be erected or how it should be conducted, a bill was filed 
in the Chancery Court by the Attorney General of the State 
against C. E. Smith, then Chairman of the County Court, about 
the year 1889, whereupon that court took charge of the entire 
trust, formulating plans and designating the agencies to conduct 
the college, and the general plans upon which the provisions of 
the will should be carried out, with a view of affording free edu- 
cation “to the poor and orphan white children” of the First 
District of Shelby County. Much of the funds of the estate 
had been loaned out and much of it upon very poor security. A 
great deal of litigation ensued from these sources, so that finally 
the entire trust fund passed from the County Court and was 
placed in the Security Bank of Memphis, as trustee, while the 
affairs of the college proper were to be in the hands of a Board. 
of Trustees of seven citizens selected from the First District. 
Boyps are Issvep. 
The school was conducted in this way for some years. The 
Security Bank then resigned, and the County Court, with the 
sanction of the State Legislature, was induced to take what was: 
left of the Bolton bequest, then amounting to $60,000, upon a loan 
of fifteen years, bearing 5 per cent interest, for which bonds were 
issued. : 
The affairs of Bolton College have been gradually simplified

until they are now in better shape than at any previous time. 
The old Bolton farm is now owned by the college, and contains 
about 1,200 acres of very valuable land, upon which the college 
is situated and which cost originally over $25,000. The rentals 
from the farm amount to some $1,200 per year. The interest 
on the fund loaned to Shelby County is paid semiannually, 
amounting to $3,000 per annum, while there is paid from the 
public school fund about $500 per year, all of which, together 
with such incidental charges collected amounts to the sum of 
about $5,000 per year upon which to run Bolton College. 
Some years since the college was incorporated, which entitles 
it to issue diplomas, and it has turned out some most excellent 
men and women, and has an enrollment of something over 200 
pupils per year. 
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. 
The history of higher education in the Cumberland Presby- 
terian Church begins with the year 1826, when Cumberland 
College was established at Princeton, Ky. From the beginning 
the college was seriously embarrassed by a small debt and a too 
meager income; and so year by year the situation grew worse, 
as the burden resting on the General Assembly grew heavier. 
Finally, in 1842, after fruitless efforts to lift the debt and endow 
the college, the General Assembly “appointed a committee to 
select a suitable location for the establishment of a new 
institution.” After investigation the committee decided on 
Lebanon, Tennessee. For a few years it was called Cumberland 
College but in 1844 the name was changed to Cumberland 
University. 
The university was first chartered December 30, 1843, which 
charter has been several times amended. The Board of Trustees 
is local and self-perpetuating. The election of new members, 
however, must be confirmed by the General Assembly of the 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. 
The Law School was opened in 1847. Its. growth from the
-P-A-G-E-439
—3874— 
beginning was remarkable, and in 1856 it was considered the 
second in size among the law schools of the country. It now 
numbers its graduates by more than 2,000. By the concurrent 
action of the General Assembly and the Board of ‘Trustees the 
Theological School was established in 1852. More than 325 
living ministers in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church have 
graduated from this department. 
When the Civil War began, the value of buildings and 
apparatus belonging to the university was very creditable. 
Moreover, the university was in a very prosperous condition, the 
number of students in 1858—the most successful year before the 
war—being 481. During the war the university suffered a fate 
like that of many other Southern schools. The buildings were 
burned, the apparatus and library were destroyed, the endowment 
was rendered worthless, and many of the trustees and friends 
lost all hope of reorganization. Notwithstanding all this, a few 
faithful ones determined to attempt the seemingly impossible, 
and in January 1860, the university was reopened without 
buildings, endowment or apparatus. Since the “resurgence 
from ashes” the university has had a steady growth. Its build- 
ings are new, large and commodious; its libraries, general and 
departmental, number more than twenty thousand volumes; its 
apparatus valued at many thousand dollars, and its influence 
reaches far and wide through the Union. 
The university has had five Presidents, all of whom have done 
noble work. In 1902 David E. Mitchell was elected to the 
presidency of the institution. He is the youngest college 
President in the United States. 
His administration has revolutionized the university. Two 
new departments have been added—the School of Oratory and 
the Conservatory of Music. A magnificent new dormitory has 
been erected on the campus. The equipment has been very 
much improved and the student body greatly increased. Total 
enrollment 1903-04, 648. The university has two splendid 
training schools, one for boys, the other for girls, in Lebanon. 
The institution is coeducational. 
The moral and religious elements of an education have always 
been stressed. Lebanon, the seat of the university, is a small town,

without saloons, gambling houses or low places. The place was 
chosen because it offered a minimum of temptation. 
Cumberland University has considerably over 3,000 graduates. 
Among her alumni are found 26 Judges State Supreme Courts, 
45 Congressmen, 8 Governors of States, 9 Generals in the Con- 
federate service and a score of college presidents. The fifty- 
eighth Congress, extraordinary session, had more representatives 
from Cumberland University than from all. the educational 
institutions in Tennessee together; more than any Southern 
institution except the University of Virginia. In the same 
Senate, Cumberland University tied Yale in graduate represent- 
atives and led all other institutions. For three times in a 
quarter of a century Cumberland has had more representatives in 
Congress thin any other institution in the United States. 
UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH. 
The University of the South was projected in the ante-bellum 
by Bishop (afterwards Major General) Polk, in collaboration 
with other Southern bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church; 
and was designed to furnish for the youths of the South the edu- 
cation which was furnished by the Universities of Oxford and 
Cambridge to young Englishmen. The site finally selected for 
the University was Sewanee, Franklin County, Tenn., on the Cum- 
berland plateau, upon what was then a coal road leading up the 
mountains from Cowan, on the N.C. & St. L. Road. A domain 
was acquired, comprising nearly 10,000 acres of woodland, 
abundantly watered, and in every way adapted to the needs of 
the projected University, which was purposely located ut a dis- 
tance from cities, in order that it might ‘‘ make its. own society.” 
A charter was obtained from the State of Tennessee. The nucleus 
of an endowment was secured, the university domain was laid out 
by a landscape architect, buildings were designed and in 1859 
the cornerstone of the principal building was laid with appro 
priate ceremonies. It was then supposed that the work would go
-P-A-G-E-443
—3876— 
on and that the dream of the founders would be speedly realized. 
But the war swept away everything upon which their hopes had 
been built excepting the charter and the domain, and even the 
latter was held upon the conditions that the work of the projected 
University be begun within ten years, which would expire with 
the year 1868. 
At the close of the war Dr. Charles Todd Quintard succeeded 
to the Episcopate n Tennessee. He called together the survivors 
of the ante-bellum trustees of the University, reorganized the 
board, collected necessary funds, was elected Vice Chancellor, 
removed his residence to Sewanee, and by dint of much labor 
succeeded in opening the school there on the 18th September, 
1868. From that time the work has steadily grown until the 
University of the South has taken high rank among the institu- 
tions of learning in this country. The Academic Department 
was organized as distinct from the Grammar School in 1871. A 
Theological Department was organized in 1876. Medical, Phar- 
maceutical and Law Departments were opened in the nineties, 
the equipment of the University meanwhile expanding, and new 
and beautiful buildings being erected upon the domain until a 
conservative estimate of the value of the property might be 
given as $750,000. The Sewanee Grammar School was main- 
tained and preserves the military features which once character- 
ised the entire University. The University still retains the aca- 
demic dress—cap and gown, with the hood for the degree men, 
and has its sessions from the middle of March to the middle of 
December, with vacation in the winter. 
The number of students has steadily grown from 9 in 1868 to 
550 in 1904, The present officers of the university are ax fol- 
lows: B. Lawton Wiggins, M.A., LL.D., Vice Chancellor; Cam- 
eron Piggot, M.D., Dean of the Academic Department; the Rev. 
W. P. DuBose, M.A., 8.T.D., Dean of the Theological Depart- 
ment; John 8. Cain, M.D., Dean of the Medical Department ; 
Albert T. McNeal, Dean of the law Department; B. M. Roszel, 
Ph.D., Headmaster of the Grammar School, besides whom there 
are about fifty professors, lecturers and instructors. The gradu- 
ate alumni number about 900.

The United States Governmentin June, 1904, deeded for edu- 
cational purposes the Columbia Arsenal to the Columbia Military 
Academy, a corporation organized under the laws of Tennessee. 
This property is situated one mile from Columbia, Tenn.,in the 
most beautiful section of the State. 
In 1891 the Government at an expense of some $300,000 
erected upon the sixty-seven acres of land, donated by the citi- 
zens of Columbia, ten buildings of the most substantial character 
—four constructed of stone, and the remaining ones built of 
brick. These buildings and grounds are the handsomest in the 
State, and after the interior remodeling now under way is com- 
pleted it is safe to say that no school in the South will have such 
a magnificent plant. The refining influence of such surroundings 
is of incalculable value in the formation of character. 
The Secretary of War prescribes the military curriculum and 
exercises all the rights of a visitor. The Government will detail 
an active officer from the regular army as instructor in military 
science. 
The Board of Trustees is composed of the following gentle- 
men: Dr. B. L. Wiggins, Vice Chancellor of University of South ; 
Dr. J. H. Kirkland, Chancellor Vanderbilt University ; Hon. Har- 
vey H. Hannah, Adjutant General of the State; Prof. W. E. 
Bostick, Superintendent of the City Schools of Columbia; Hon.. 
E. E. Barthell, President City Board of Education, Nashville ; 
Hon. A. M. Tillman, U.S. District Attorney for Middle Tenn- 
essee, and Hon. Seymour A. Mynders, State Superintendent of 
Public Instrnction. The Board of Trustees elected H. OC. Weber, 
ex-Superintendent of the City Schools of Nashville, as Super- 
intendent of the Academy. Mr. Weber is one of the leading 
schoolmen of the South. 
With such a body of educators and public spirited men to look 
after the welfare of the Institution nothing but success can be 
predicted. 
The Academy opens for the reception of students, September, 
1905.

DEPARTMENT oF PuBuic INstRUCTION. 
Nasuvitte, Tenn., January 8, 1904. 
To School Directors: 
The distribution of the surplus in the State treasury on 
December 31, 1908, gives to the public schools of the State an 
increase of funds amounting to 85 cents per capita. It is 
earnestly hoped that this evidence of interest on the part of the 
Governor and the Legislature will be met with an increased inter- 
est by the County Courts and school officers. We need longer 
terms and better primary schools, and I trust that you will see 
that the money is used to supply these necds. Employ no one 
to teach in these schools that does not love little children and is 
not thoroughly qualified. Professional knowledge and a high 
order of attainments are absolutely necessary. The primary 
teacher should be the best teacher ‘in the school system. 
As a rule, directors should not buy maps, charts, libraries, 
etc., from traveling agents. To meet their heavy expenses, they 
must charge much more than the publishers would charge if 
bought direct. Then, while these things may be good, their use 
is often wholly impracticable in the average school room. 
T again urge that the State and county money be used so far 
as possible to lengthen the school term and employ competent 
teachers. You will be furnished with blanks by your County 
Superintendents on which you will report ten days before the 
close of each quarter a complete list of all warrants issued for 
salaries and other purposes. These lists will be compared with 
the Trustee’s report of warrants paid. 
The district director is one of the most important officers 
elected by the people. You are charged with the care of the 
educational interests of the children of your district. The future 
citizenship of the State will be determined by the manner in 
which you discharge this trust. Let us make the year 1904 
memorable by a great improvement in our public schools. 
Very truly yours, . 
Seymour A. Mynprrs, 
State Superintendent.

The summer school to be held at the Peabody College for 
Teachers has my hearty endorsement. : 
Ihave arranged to grant to teachers attending the summer 
school the same privileges that are given to those attending Pea- 
body State Institutes. 
Teachers attending this year for the first time, and passing 
the required examinations on the primary school branches, will 
be given certificates entitling the holders to teach in any county . 
in the State for one year. Those who have previously taken the 
primary course in the summer school or a Peabody State Insti- 
tute and: passing the examination on the secondary school
-P-A-G-E-490

branches will be granted “Roll of Honor” certificates entitling 
the holders to teach in any county in the State for four years. 
At least three weeks attendance at the snmmer school is re- 
quired of applicants for certificates and I recommend that they 
attend the full term.

lic schools in the State of Tennessee for a period of five years. 
The following branches of study are included in the public school

all expense, including freight, express charges, or postage, in 
placing books in the hands of patrons to be borne by the fur- 
nisher. 
Accompanying each bid, but under separate cover, shall be 
one or more specimen copies of each and every book proposed 
to be furnished and each bidder shall deposit with the Treasurer 
of the State, at the time of filing his bid, the sum of $500. The 
commission reserves the right, under said Act, to increase said 
sum to twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) to be deposited by 
any bidder on or before the 9th day of July, 1904, when said 
bids are to be opened. Said deposit is to be forfeited absolutely

-P-A-G-E-494
—419— 
fail or refuse in ease of acceptance of his bid, to make and ex- 
ecute such contract and bond as is required by said act, within 
thirty days after notification of the acceptance of his bid by the 
Text-Book Commission, as provided in said act. 
All bids will be opened on July 9, 1904, in the office of the 
Governor of the State of Tennessee, in the presence of the Text-

Jackson, at which a supply of the book or books to be furnished, 
sufficient to meet all immediate demands, shall be kept. The 
principal depository shall be at Nashville. The successful bid-

1, 1905, so as to cause the least inconvenience and expense to the 
school children of the State.

To County Superintendents : 
If you are in need of any supplies, please send your order to 
this office at once. Be sure to give your nearest express office. 
Your attention is called to Section 9, Subsections 3 and 6 of 
the Public School Laws. I insist that, this year, all County Su- 
perintendents have their annual reports at this office not later 
than August 1, as required by law. 
Notify district clerks to report to you at once, and see that 
their reports are accurate and complete. Be sure to include all 
city schools in your statistics. 
Census of scholastic population must be taken by district 
clerks in the month of July. Do not pay any clerk for taking 
census until he has filed complete report of the schools of his 
district for the year ending June 30, 1904. 
Teachers who fail or refuse to file report and abstract of 
school taught this year should be refused certificates for the 
coming session. 
Yery truly yours, 
Seymour A. Mynpsrs, 
State Superintendent.

Hon. Jas. D. Richardson, Chairman, Atlanta, Ga. 
Duar Srr—I call your attention to the fact that State Insti- 
tutes for teachers will be held in Tennessee at the following times 
and places : 
Jackson, June 6 to July 1. 
Dickson, June 6 to July 1. 
Union City, June 6 to July 1. 
Lewisburg, June 6 to July 1. 
Huntingdon, June 18 to July 8. 
Dayton, June 20 to July 15. 
Gallatin, June 20 to July 15. 
Jonesboro, June 27 to July 22. 
Jackson (for colored), June 13 to July 8. 
It has been the custom of the Southern Passenger Associa- 
tion to grant a one and one-third fare for the round trip on the 
certificate plan. I will be glad if you will do so in this instance. 
Please advise us as early as practicable so that the matter will 
receive proper advertisement. 
Yours very truly, 
SrymMour A. MyYNpERS, 
State Superintendent. 
Stare or TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pusiic INstRucTION. 
NasHvite, Trnn., June 9, 1904. 
To County Superintendents : 
The act passed by the last Legislature making the school and 
civil districts coextensive will take effect August 1. Under this 
act, in all districts not heretofore coextensive, directors will be 
- elected at a special election to be held on the first Thursday in 
August, but in all districts where the school and civil districts 
are already coextensive no election will be held. Directors 
elected in August shall serve until the regular election in 1904.’
-P-A-G-E-499
—422— 
All directors elected in August of this year will qualify on the 
first Monday in September. 
The present directors should take the scholastic population 
this year as usual, on the blanks furnished by this office. In the 
column marked “ Civil District in which Child Lives,” the person 
taking the census should be careful to note the number of the 
civil district. The County Superintendent will then be able to 
prepare for the State Superintendent and the County Trustee, as 
required by law, the census by civil districts. Do not pay any 
clerk for taking census until he has filed with you reports in full 
for all schools taught in his district for scholastic year ending 
June 30. 
For schools opening the first of September the present 
directors have the right to contract; for schools opening after 
that time, except where it has been the custom to elect at the 
close of the previous term, the new directors should elect and 
contract. 
Under this act no school can be maintained with a scholastic 
population of less than seventy. This does not mean attendance. 
This clause does not necessarily abolish any school that should be 
continued, as the act provides that where the scholastic popula- 
tion is less than seventy the school may be maintained if by 
abolishing the same would require children to walk over twe and 
one-half miles to another school, or if there are natural barriers. 
The purpose of this provision in the law is to consolidate the 
small schools with larger ones, thus enabling us to run the schools 
longer and furnish better school facilities. 
Schools under contract for summer terms may be continued, 
but the directors should be urged not to continue schools that 
have not the required population after that time. 
When the present school districts are abolished any money 
left to the credit of a school district should go to the civil district 
in which the child lives—that is to say, the County Superintend- 
ent with the County Trustee should, from the scholastic 
population as furnished by the district clerks, distribute the 
school money on hand to the credit of the civil districts out of 
which the said school district was heretofore established, in 
proportion to the number of children enumerated from the 
different civil districts.
-P-A-G-E-500
—423— 
The law provides that the child can attend the school nearest 
to it, whether in its own or another civil district, so that it is 
impossible to take off from any one school any part of the 
scholastic population in order to make the number above seventy 
for any school. The manner of apportioning the money where 
children attend school in a district other than their own is fully 
set out in the act, copies of which have been sent you. 
Districts that have been created by special acts df the 
Legislature remain as heretofore and the directors remain the 
same. 
EXAMINATION oF TRACHERS. 
I cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity for great 
care in the examination and licensing of teachers. Under no 
consideration should an incompetent person be employed to teach 
in the public schools. We cannot hope for better schools until 
we raise the standard required of our teachers. 
Remember that examinations on all the branches required to 
be taught in the schools and upon Theory and Practice of 
Teaching should be thorough, practical and uniform, and that 
only persons possessing ability to teach and of good moral 
character should be granted certificates. You have no right to 
grant a certificate to a person who has failed as a teacher or who 
is of a doubtful character. The fact that a person holds a 
certificate from a State Institute does not justify you in issuing 
him a certificate if you are not satisfied as to his moral character. 
In brief you are instructed to license only persons who are in 
every way worthy, capable and thoroughly qualified. 
You are to exempt from examination only persons holding 
diplomas from the Peabody Normal College or certificates from 
the Peabody State Institutes, or such persons as have been in 
regular attendance at the County Institutes and have shown by 
previous examination and successful experience, under your 
observation in the school room, that they are worthy of such con- 
sideration, and these cases should be very few. As arule, I would 
not encourage duplicating certificates and I instruct against this.
-P-A-G-E-501
—424— 
Timms oF EXAMINATIONS. 
County Superintendents are directed to hold public examina- 
tions at the following times and to give no private examinations: 
Annual Examination—At close of County Institute. 
Second Examination—First Friday and Saturday in August. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Oc- 
tober. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Janu- 
ary. 
Quarterly Examination— First Friday and Saturday in March. 
Fix the time and place for the examination; announce before- 
hand the number of hours to be consumed daily and then follow 
your announcement. 
Do not permit personal consideration, importunities of teach- 
ers, directors, or influential friends in any way to influence you 
in licensing teachers. All certificates should be made to expire 
at the close of the scholastic year, June 30. 
County TEAcHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
If you have not already done so, you should at once organize 
a County Teachers’ Association and hold regular meetings. All 
teachers should be urged to attend these meetings and their attend- 
ance and work in such meetings should be taken into considera- 
tion in granting them certificates. This is a good opportunity 
to test their knowledge of theory and practice of teaching. 
The new Roll of Honor certificates provided for the Peabody 
State Institutes will be good for four years, but they are not cer- 
tificates to teach. The holders thereof will be entitled to a 
county certificate from you upon presentation of said Roll of 
Honor certificate if they are in other respects worthy. The fol- 
lowing clause has been added after the words “for four years,” 
“ provided the holder hereof has attended the County Association 
and complied with all other regulations made by the County 
Superintendent.” 
Work or Instrrutes aNp ASSOCIATIONS. 
I sincerely hope that this year, in all your teachers’ meetings, 
you will give attention to the subject of improvement of methods
-P-A-G-E-502
—425— 
in our primary schools. In any successful school system it is 
very important that the foundation be well laid. Good primary 
teachers are few and our schools need improvement in this par- 
ticular department. 
Primary, SeconpAaRY anp HicH ScHooLs. 
Our law provides for three grades of schools and as we now 
have the civil and school districts coextensive, I urge that where 
practicable not more than one secondary school be established in 
a district, and that children from the entire district be allowed to 
take the secondary branches in this school. The secondary 
school should have not less than two teachers. The other schools 
of the district should be primary and graded so that the district 
will have a system of graded schools running through the primary 
and secondary grades just as are found in the cities. 
County High School where established should be the head of 
the public school system of the county, and pupils should be en- 
couraged to attend school until they have finished the secondary 
and high schools. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
The University of Tennessee is the head of our public school 
system and you should see that the scholarships in it, as provided 
by law, are all filled, Ifyou have not had applicants sufficient 
to fill these, urge upon some worthy young men or women in 
your county the necessity of taking advantage of the great op- 
portunity offered by this institution. 
EpucationaL MEETINGS. , 
As outlined to you at the conference for education held in the 
city of Nashville in April, you are urged to hold educational rallies 
or meetings in every district in your county. Urge the people 
to come together and discuss freely matters pertaining to our 
‘public school system. Organize your county by having a good 
central committee, and under it district committees, and carry on 
the work of an educational campaign in a systematic way. On 
these committees bring into service influential men of your 
county.
-P-A-G-E-503
—426— 
Urge the people to keep their children in school through the en- 
tire term. Create a sentiment in favor of longer terms, better 
school houses, better facilities, consolidation and grading of 
schools. 
Wishing you success in your year’s work and assuring you 
that I am ready to cooperate and help you in any way, I am, 
Very sincerely,

To the County Superintendent : 
I send you herewith two blanks for your annual report. One 
is to be kept as a record in your office, and the other, properly 
“filled out,” is to be furnished to this department not later than 
August 1, as required by Section 9, Subsection 6, of the Public 
School Laws. Notice. that the blanks are different from those 
previously used.
-P-A-G-E-505
—428— 
In making out this report, please observe the following : 
1. Make all figures plain, and put units of the same order 
under each other. 
2. Include all school statistics under the heading “County,” 
except schools run independently by “City or Town Boards of 
Education” and strictly private schools. The statisties for schools 
run a portion of the year with public school funds and a portion 
with private subscription should be included, and should embrace 
only the period maintained by public school funds. 
3. Under the heading “ Cities”? should be embraced all statis- 
tics of schools in charge of city or town Boards of Education. 
These statistics should be obtained from City Superintendents. 
4. In event any new schools have been built to take the place 
of old ones, do not include in“ number built,” as they are ac- 
counted for in “Increased Value of School Property at End of 
Year.” 
5. In arriving at “ Average Compensation of Teachers per 
Month,” the entire amount paid to teachers should be divided by 
the number of teachers, and that amount by the average number 
of days taught during the year, and the result multiplied by 20. 
6. The financial statement must be correct to a cent, and I 
suggest that you see that the balance on hand at beginning of year 
is properly charged to the County Trustee, and in event there is 
any difference between what is claimed and the amount reported 
in my last report, investigate it carefully, and advise me of the 
cause of the discrepancy, if any, in separate letter. 
7. The total amount received by the county on account of 
State apportionments should equal the total amount paid to the 
Trustee for the year by the State Comptroller. 
8. Private school statistics should embrace only such schools 
as are run strictly as private or denominational schools. If there 
is not sufficient room to embrace them all, extend the ruling and 
attach more paper, as they must all be included and all questions 
fully answered. 
9. Every question should be fully answered, and where defi- 
nite figures cannot be obtained, they can be estimated under heads 
of “Sexes,” white or colored, “ Enrollment by Grades” and “In
-P-A-G-E-506
—429— 
Each Branch of Study,” butin no instance should any. estimate 
be made as to matters pertaining to financial statements. This 
must be accurate. 
Please give this your immediate attention. Remember, your 
report must reach this office by August 1, or an expert will be 
sent to your county to look after it. 
Very truly yours,

_ STATE or TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT OF PuBLic INSTRUCTION. 
NasHVILLE, Tenn., July 12, 1904. 
To the City Superintendent : 
I enclose blanks for your report for the year ending June 380, 
1904. One is for file in your office, one for the County Superin- 
tendent and the third should be sent to this office not later than 
August 1. 
In making this report please observe the following: 
1. Make all figures plain and put units of the same order 
under each other. 
2. Every question should be answered, and when definite sta- 
tistics cannot be obtained, as is sometimes the case in giving 
color, sex, enrollment in each branch, etc., estimate the statistics 
as best you can, but financial statements must be accurate. 
3. In arriving at “average compensation of teachers per 
month,” the entire amount paid to teachers should be divided 
by the number of teachers and that amount divided by the num- 
ber of days taught, and the result multiplied by 20. 
4. The financial statement must be correct to a cent, and I 
suggest that you see that the balance on hand at the beginning 
of the year is properly charged against the accounting officer, 
and in event of any difference between the balance claimed and 
‘the balance shown by my report as “on hand at beginning of 
year,” please investigate oarefully and advise me in a separate 
letter of the cause of the discrepancy, if any. 
Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. Mynpers, 
State Superintendent.

State of ‘TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT OF Pusiic InstRucTION. 
  Dear Str—Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tenn., 
desires to hoid its entrance examinations as usual in each county 
of this State. This is done annually with a view of bringing 
these examinations nearer the home of applicants for admission, 
many of whom wish to test their fitness before the September 
examinations at the college, and without the trip to Nashville. 
The dates this year are July 28-30 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), 
and I request that you conduct the examinations, or appoint 
some one to do so. Give as great publicity as possible to the 
date and place of examination. Take care to distribute the 
examinations over the three days to suit the hours needed for 
each paper, and send all the papers when finished to John M. 
Bass, Secretary Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tenn., 
who will refund to you the postage necessary. 
This service on your part will be a genuine favor to the col- 
lege, and to great numbers of our bright young people looking 
to this source for an education and for professional training. 
Yours truly, : 
Srymour A. Mynvers, 
State Superintendent. 
Statement and Proclamation of Text-Book Commission. 
In the important and responsible task of selecting text-books 
for use in the public schools of Tennessee, the Text-Book Com- 
mission has endeavored to act with great care and deliberation. 
The general purpose of the commission has been to secure the 
best possible books at a reasonable cost. In reaching a decision 
as to the merits of books offered, we have availed ourselves of 
the best information obtainable. 
In the first place we have had before us the report of the sub- 
commission, carefully prepared, after long and tedious labor, In 
the second place the members of the commission have spent
-P-A-G-E-517
—440— 
considerable time and labor in the examination of the books sub- 
mitted. This has been done both privately and by the commis- 
sion as a whole in executive session. In the third place we have 
had before us the opinions of city and county superintendents 
and principals of schools as to the merits of books now in use. 
To secure these opinions a confidential circular letter was sent 
out April 5, 1904, by the Governor and Superintendent of Edu- 
cation. Every effort was made to obtain candid judgments, 
based on personal experience and observation. These opinions 
were tabulated and were constantly before the commission during 
its sittings. 
Practically stated the effort of the commission in each case 
was to secure the best book offered at a price lower, if possible, 
than that now paid for the same or a similar book. This ideal 
could not of couse be attained in every case, but in general it is 
believed that the books selected are decidedly superior to those 
now in use. The State is to be congratulated that this end has 
been attained at a very material reduction in price. The list of 
books selected is as follows:

The commission has deemed it unnecessary to adopt any book 
in higher arithmetic or higher algebra, believing the ground suf- 
ficiently covered by the books adopted. For the same. reason 
Metcalf’s Elementary English has been omitted. 
In some cases books are offered at two prices. This indicates 
a difference in binding between boards and cloth. Every effort 
has been made to save expense. In a number of cases the com- 
mission was able to secure terms slightly more favorable than 
those offered in the first bid. Altogether the total cost of the 
books selected is seventeen per cent (17 per cent) less than that 
of the books now in use. While a number of books now in use
-P-A-G-E-519
—442— 
have been omitted from our list, no change has been made with- 
out the best of reasons. The exchange privilege, which will be 
in effect until September 1, 1905, protects the pupils against seri- 
ous loss from this cause, and the gain in character of books fur- 
nished will far outweigh the slight inconvenience of a change. 
Schools opening before September 1, 1904, will use the old 
books and continue their use until the same are finished or until 
the end of the term. 
All things considered the commission feels satisfied with the 
results of its labors. No such list of books can contain all the 
best or only the best books; but we feel that we have selected no 
book of inferior character. We know that in making our selec- 
tions we have had in view only the best interests of the children 
of the State, and we present the results of our labors with confi- 
dence and with satisfaction.

than that now paid for the same or a similar book. This ideal 
could not, of course, be attained in every case, but in general it 
is believed that the books selected are decidedly superior to those
-P-A-G-E-522
—445— 
now in use. The State is to be congratulated that this end has 
been attained at a very material reduction in price. 
The commission has deemed it unnecessary to adopt any 
book in higher arithmetic or higher algebra, believing the ground 
sufficiently covered by the books adopted. For the same reason 
Metcalf’s Elementary English has been omitted. 
In some cases books are offered at two prices. This indicates 
a difference in binding between boards and cloth. Every effort 
has been made to save expense. In a number of cases the com-: 
mission was able to secure terms slightly more favorable than 
those offered in the first bids. Altogether the total cost of the 
books selected is seventeen (17) per cent less than that of 
the books now in use. While a number of books now in use 
have been omitted from our list, no change has been made with- 
out the best reasons. The exchange privilege, which will be in 
effect until September 1, 1903, protects the pupils against serious 
loss from this cause, and the gain in character of books furnished 
will far outweigh the slight inconvenience of a change. Schools 
opening before September 1, 1904, will use the old books and con- 
tinue their use until the same are finished or until the end of the 
derm. 
All things considered, the commission feels satisfied with the 
results of its labors. No such list of books can contain all the 
best or only the best books; but we feel that we have selected no 
book of inferior character. We know that in making our selec- 
tions we have had in view only the best interests of the children 
of the State, and we present the results of our labers with confi- 
dence and with satisfaction.

This, July 19, 1904. 
Particular attention is called to the adoption of Burkett, 
Stevens and Hill’s Agriculture for beginners. The law requires 
the teaching of the Elements of Agriculture in the public schools 
of the State, and the farmers’ conventions in the several divis-
-P-A-G-E-523
—446— 
ions of the State have passed resolutions urging that more atten- 
tion be given to this important subject. The commission accord- 
ingly adopted a book that can be used in the fifth grade, and we 
earnestly hope that the County Superintendents of the State 
will see that this study is taught in every school. 
The books formerly adopted on Mental Arithmetic, Higher 
Arithmetic, Geology of Tennessee and History of Tennessee 
continue in use under the old contract until December 1, 1904, 
and the new contract for these books begins on that date. 
The commission adopted copy books of both the vertical and 
intermediate slant systems, in order that teachers may select 
and teach the one best suited to their schools. These copy books, 
we believe, are the best published, and have been secured at a 
remarkably low price. We trust they will be used by every 
school in the State. The commission expressed no preference 
between the systems, and leaves the selection of cither to the 
good judgment of the public school teachers and officials. The 
higher books on business forms and correspondence are especial- 
ly recommended for secondary schools. 
The’ publishers have officially notified me of the establish- 
ment of the following depositories : 
Frank K. Smith, Knoxville. 
T. H. Payne & Co., Chattanooga. 
Marshall & Bruce Co., Nashville. 
Hunter & Welburn, Nashville. 
The Owen & Moore Drug Co., Clarksville. 
D. A. Lyerla, Jackson. 
A. R. Taylor & Co., Memphis. 
E. H. Clarke & Bro., Memphis. 
In addition to the above, the depositories at Nashville have 
established and will maintain a subdepository at Cookeville in 
charge of Griffin Smith. 
Agencies have been established in every county seat in the 
State, and in most counties in at least three other points, where 
all books adopted by the commission will be constantly kept on 
sale. It is the intention of the commission that the books shall 
be on sale at convenient distance of all the people. 
The contract and exchange price of each book shall be printed
-P-A-G-E-524
—447— 
upon it, and all sales and exchanges must be in accordance with 
these prices. Any violations of these instructions or complaint 
made'to you by citizens of your county should be reported by 
you to this office. 
All contracts made by publishers have the following clause: 
“Tt is further specially agreed by the said party of the second 
part that it will supply each and all of the books embraced in this 
contract at the exchange price hereinbefore stipulated, in all 
cases where there is offered in part payment for a book herein- 
before designated, an old book now or heretofore in use in the 
public schools of the State, under said act of 1899, and the 
adoption thereunder by the State Text-Book Commission, and 
which is of like grade and upon the same subject as the one for 
which it is offered and taken in part payment; provided, that an 
exchange of old books for new book or books hereinbefore desig- 
nated and contracted to be furnished by said party of the second 
part may be made at any time between September 1, 1904, and 
September 1, 1905; and provided further, that such exchange 
may be gradually made between said dates as occasion and de- 
mand therefor may arise so as to cause the least inconvenience 
and expense to the school children of the State.” 
Your especial attention is called to the subject of exchange. 
No certificate of any kind is required, and the merchants should 
receive in exchange any book offered that could have been used 
in the schools had not the new book been adopted. Mutilated 
books must be taken in exchange, provided such books are in 
conditions to be used by the students in school. Books with 
good backs and otherwise in reasonable condition, with a few 
leaves missing, should be taken in exchange. A book otherwise 
in.good condition should be taken in exchange even if the back 
is torn off and marks are in it. Books should be exchanged, 
book for book, im accordance with the contract and exchange 
prices. ‘That is, a fourth reader should be exchanged for a fourth 
reader, an advanced arithmetic for an advanced arithmetic, etc. 
The commission adopted a complete speller, and either the pri- 
mary or advanced speller formerly in use can be exchanged for - 
it, at the exchange price. The Beginner’s Physiology can be 
exchanged for the First Book in Hygiene, and either the Inter-
-P-A-G-E-525
—448— 
mediate or Comprehensive Physiology for the Graded Lessons in 
Hygiene. 
It is important that you explain fully to the people of your 
county the provisions of the law, the method of exchange, the 
price of books and the exchange period, in order that every one 
who desires to do so may take advantage of the reduced prices 
and reasonable exchange. 
I earnestly solicit your cooperation in putting in force the 
new adoption without friction. 
Be sure to report all complaints promptly to this office. 
Yours very truly, 
Seymour A. Mynvers, 
State Superintendent.

If no one should be at the depot to meet the teachers, they 
are requested to come to the college buildings, where will be 
found members of the local committee who will assign homes, 
furnish badges, and send a guide with the teachers to the homes 
assigned. 
A reception to the teachers in attendance will be tendered on 
Friday evening, after the address by Governor Frazier, in the 
Armory Hall in the main college building. This reception will 
be in charge of the local lodges, the Masons, Knights of Pythias 
and Maccabees, assisted by a committee of ladies. 
The membership fee in the Association is only 50 cents. 
This entitles the member to the badge of the Association and all 
the privileges of the reception. 
The usual one and one-third fare rate has been granted by the 
‘Southeastern Passenger Association to all parties attending from

ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
The Summer School for colored teachers and students at Lane 
College will begin June 13 and continue four weeks, closing July 
8, 1904. 
The State Normal will be combined with the Summer School. 
This has been done by the Hon. S. A. Mynders, State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, who, after being interested in lo- 
cating the State Summer Normal by Pres. J. A. Bray, through 
the influence of Mayor Hu C. Anderson, plans to let this com- 
bination be permanent. 
The Board of Trustees and Faculty of Lane College appre- 
ciate this act of Supt. Mynders, which will make the Summer 
School more effective both in its efficiency and in the number 
reached. 
AIM. 
The aim is to offer to teachers an opportunity to secure the 
best instruction in both the subject matter to be taught and how 
to teach it; also to meet the desire of those who wish to pursue 
special lines of study and to accommodate those students who 
failed classes, and others who wish to prepare to enter college— 
all at a rate in reach of every one. 
ADVANTAGES. 
Certificates good in any county in Tennessee will be granted 
to those who successfully pass the examination, which will be 
held at the close of the Summer School. 
See the statement of the Hon. 8. A. Mynders elsewhere in 
these announcements.
-P-A-G-E-531

preparation for services in the common public schools. A four 
weeks’ course will be given. Each one should take the whole 
course. 
The instruction will be given by those who are professional 
and experienced in their several subjects. 
In addition to the regular lectures given. by the instructors 
the Summer Normal for the white teachers of West Tennessee 
will be in session at the same time. Arrangements have been 
made to have the lecturers deliver the same course of lectures 
to Lane College Summer School as to the State Summer Normal. 
The work is to be interspersed with a number of pleasing 
social occasions. The people of Jackson are very hospitable. 
CouRSsES. 
1, All the branches of study required to be taught in the 
common public schools will be taught. 
2. All the branches of study required in the secondary 
schools.

The work of the Peabody State Institute will consist of a 
thorough review of the public school curriculum, regular and 
systematic work in theory and practice of teaching and school 
management, and regular drills in the various branches of study 
with special attention to the best methods of study and teaching. 
The course is divided into primary and secondary, and re- 
quires two sessions for completion. Those who pass satisfactory 
examinations on the branches required by law in the primary 
‘schools of the State, and on the lectures of the institute, will be 
given a certificate which, by order of the State Superinterdent, 
will entitle the holder to a teacher’s primary certificate in any 
county in the State, good for one year.
-P-A-G-E-534
—457— 
Only persons who have previously taken the primary course 
in a State Institute will be admitted to the secondary course.

Atameeting of the Association of the Superintendents of

1903, a committee consisting of J. Y. Joyner, of North Carolina, 
Chairman; H. L. Whitfield, of Mississippi, and S. A. Mynders,

ple of the Southern States. 
At a subsequent meeting of this Association in Birmingham, 
April 26 and 27, 1904, the following address was reported by the 
chairman of the committee, and after full discussion, was unani- 
mously adopted. 
ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH BY THE STATE SUPERIN- 
TENDENTS OF PuBuic INSTRUCTION OF THE 
SouTHERN STaTEs. 
With a keen sense of the responsibility laid upon us as heads 
of the departments of education by the people of our respective 
States; with a fixed faith in the native capacity of South-rn chil- 
dren, through whose veins courses the purest strain of Anglo- 
Saxon blood on the continent—the strongest, cleanest blood on 
earth; with a firm reliance in the patriotism, chivalry, courage, 
pride, and sense of justiée of the Southern people; with a pro- 
found conviction of the necessity of universal education for the 
preservation and perpetuation of democracy; with an assurance 
born of the evidence of all past experience and all past history 
that the only means of universal education are the public schools, 
we are moved to lay before our people these facts about their 
schools and to make to them, in the children’s name, this appeal 
for those schools.
-P-A-G-E-536

Tyaprquacy oF our Pusiic Scuoon System. 
1. The public schools of the South, the only hope for the 
education of nine-tenths of the+ people’s children, are still sadly 
inadequate to their stupendous task, unequal tothe educational 
demands of this century of education and inferior in most re- 
spects to the public schools of other sections of our common 
country. Comparative statistics of undoubted authority show 
that of all sections of our country the public schools of the 
South have the poorest houses and equipment, the most poorly , 
paid teachers, the shortest school term, and the most inadequate 
system of supervision. The average monthly salary of teachers 
for the country at large is $49 for men and $40 for women, while 
the average monthly salary for teachers in the Southern States is 
$35.63 for men and $30.47 for women. The average length of 
the public school term for the country at large is 145 days. The 
average length of the public school term for the North Atlantic 
States is 177.38 days; the average length of the public school 
term for the Southern States, including Tennessee, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, 
Alabama, Virginia, and Florida, is 99 days. Outside of the larger 
cities and towns there are few public high schools in the Southern 
States worthy of the name, and the work done in most of the 
public schools is necessarily so elementary in character as to fail 
to furnish adequate preparation for college or university, or for 
civic, social, and industrial service for the thousands that must 
depend upon them forsuch preparation, For every man, woman, 
and child of its population the country atlarge is spending $2.99 
for the education of its children; the South is spending barely 
98 cents. The country at large is spending $20.29 for every 
pupil enrolled in its public schools; the Southern States are spend- 
ing only $6.95. The country at large is spending for every 
child of school age in the United States an average of $10.57 ; 
the Southern States are spending for every child of school age 
within their borders $4.05. It is not surprising that, with such 
an inadequately equipped system of public schools, there should 
be found also in the South the largest per cent of illiteracy and 
the smallest per cent of property on a per capita distribution of 
wealth. The census report for 1900 shows that 24 per cent of
-P-A-G-E-537
—460— 
, the white population of the United States dwells in the Southern 
States that composed the Confederacy, while 64 per cent of all 
white illiterates over ten years-of age is to be found in these 
States. Mliteracy and poverty, intelligence and prosperity travel 
together through the world. The one follows the other as effect 
follows cause. 
2. Between eight-ninths and nine-tenths of the population of 
| ne South is rural and agricultural. The great masses of the 
| people of the South, therefore, are dependent upon the rural 
schools for education. These rural schools, then, are the stra- 
tegic points in the educational system of the Southern States. 
Farming is still the greatest industry and the farm house is still 
the greatest institution in the South. The preservation and im- 
provement of its greatest industry and its greatest institutions 
depend upon the improvement of these rural schools. Because 
of sparse population, large territory, bad roads, geographical bar- 
riers, small amount of taxable property, and small school fund, 
these rural public schools are the most poorly equipped and the 
most inefficient public schools in the South. Unless they can be 
made equal in merit to the best public schools of the towns and 
cities and adapted to educating farmers’ children for farm life 
rather than away from farm life, many of the best people in the 
country will continue to leave the farms, and the disastrous drain 
upon the best blood of the country will be kept up until there 
may be left only “the peasant population, too ignorant to know 
the value and blessing of an education and too indifferent to care 
to secure it for their offspring.” 
8. It behooves our people to face these facts with their char- 
/acteristic courage, the courage that they displayed on the battle- 
/ field when the forces of the world were massed against them, the 
, courage that they displayed in the darkest hour of the direst 
poverty that followed on the heels of bloody war, and that enabled 
them to repair their broken fortunes and rebuild their blasted 
homes and recultivate their devastated fields. They are now 
beginning to have time and means to build up their public schools. 
4. Far be from us any intention of ridicule, blame or dis- 
couragement in reciting these facts in regard to the educational 
conditions of the Southern States. To those familiar with the
-P-A-G-E-538
—461— 
obstacles that had to be overcome—social and political revolu- 
tion, destruction and reconstruction, poverty, robbery, misrule, 
the wonder is that these conditions are as good as they are. For 
a people that have so heroically and successfully surmounted 
such obstacles and made possible in one generation a new and 
glorious era of industrial and educational development, we have 
only admiration, gratitude, commendation. We would remind. 
this generation of Southerners, however, that some sacrifice for 
_ their children is necessary, and that with half the sacrifice 
that their fathers and mothers made, Southern children can be 
given such educational facilities as will enable them to begin the 
work of manhood and womanhood without handicap, as com- 
pared with the children of other sections of our common country. 
REMEDIES. 
Realizing the defects of the public schools of the South, we 
beg to suggest out of our experience and observation some rem- 
edies : 
(2 At the foundation of every successful school system lies 
the\practical problem of necessary physical equipment in houses, 
furniture and grounds. This question of the character of a pub- 
lic schoolhouse is a far more serious one than it seems to the un- 
thinking. Nobody has any respect for anything that is not re 
spectable. A respectable schoolhouse with respectable equip- 
ment and decent surroundings is necessary for conducting suc- 
cessfully the business of public education, and is essential for 
commanding the respect of the community for that business 
Men judge the character of the business very largely by the 
character of the place of business. Surely, then, the house in 
which this sacred work of training the children of the Republic 
for citizenship and social service, a work that has to do with mind 
and soul and body, with the moulding of character and the crea- 
tion of ideals, should be a place worthy in all respects of suck 
work; a home, not a hovel; a place of beauty, not a place of 
ugliness; a place of comfort, not a place of discomfort; a place 
of cleanliness, not a place of uncleanliness\ About it the grass 
should grow green and the sun shine bright, the flowers bloom 
and the birds sing, and the trees wave their long arms, that 
the children, while listening to the lessons taught by men and
-P-A-G-E-539
—462— 
books may receive also, from the potent, silent influence of proper 
environment, the sweet messages of peace and love and culture 
and beauty. 
~ 2. Houses and grounds and equipments are largely dead 
“mechanism without the vitalizing touch of a properly qualified 
| teacher. It is, after all, the teacher that breathes the breath of 
| life into the school. We need better teachers and must have 
\ them before we can have better schools. But we are now getting 
\ better teachers than we pay for. With short school terms, small 
“salaries, poor schoolhouses, unclassified and unclassifiable schools 
and other conditions that render success almost impossible, we 
cannot hope to command and retain first-class talent in this bus- 
iness of teaching the rural schools. After all, back of this ques- 
tion of better teachers lies the question of better pay.) For 
meagre salaries, men and women cannot afford to put themselves 
into the long and expensive training necessary for the best 
equipment for this delicate and difficult work of teaching. With 
the short terms and the necessity of dividing their attention be- 
tween the service of two masters to make abare living, they 
scarcely work at the business of teaching long enough to master 
it or to make of it a real profession. In the past, because of 
peculiar conditions in the South, we have been able to command, 
even for the meager salaries that we have paid, a teaching force 
of more culture and refinement, perhaps, than could have been 
commanded anywhere else on the continent. As the South, how- 
ever, rapidly comes more and more into her industrial and agri- 
cultural heritage, and the channels of profitable employment 
multiply, we cannot hope to retain the best men and women in 
the profession of teaching unless we make their compensation 
somewhat commensurate with that offered in other fields of labor. 
At present the annual salary paid the teacher who works in the 
immortal stuff of mind and soul is less than that paid the rudest 
workers in wood and iron—less than that paid the man that shoes 
your horse or ploughs your corn or paints your house. 
_» 3. The evidence of the most successful school systems in 
avery section of the country, and of the most successful county, 
town, and district systems in the South, proves conclusively the 
necessity and the wisdom of competent supervision. Without 
competent supervision and direction no great business can suc- “
-P-A-G-E-540
—463— 
ceed. This business of education is no exception to the rule. 
Each county system of schools Joust have a competent head. It 
can rise no higher than its head.» The supervisor of the county 
system should be a man trained to his work, with ability to make 
and execute plans for the improvement and training of the pub- 
lic school teachers; to direct campaigns for education of public 
sentiment on educational questions, and for the advancement of 
public education along all needful lines; to advise, stimulate and 
properly direct school committeemen and other school officers; 
he should be endowed with tact, wisdom, common sense, charac- 
ter, grit, ability to get along with folks and to command ~ 
fidence of teachers, officers, children, and patrons. In 
this man occupies the real strategic point in all this work o 
education in the South today.) He must be a many-sideu swoas, 
possessing not only professional training but rare qualities of 
leadership. The work is difficult enough and delicate enough, 
the responsibility great enough and sacred enough, to require 
the entire time, thought, and energy of the most competent man, 
the entire consecration of every faculty of his head and heart 
and body. You cannot command such a man for long without 
paying him a living salary. The average salary paid men for 
this work in the South is less than $500 per year. 
J* We cannot hope to give the great masses of our people 
more than the mere rudiments of learning in public schools con- 
tinuing only about 99 days a year. We cannot hope to compete 
with other sections whose public schools are open to all their 
children from 150 to 190 days. 
5, Before there can be such classification and gradation 
of the work in the public schools as to make possible thorough 
and successful instruction in even the primary and intermediate 
branches, some means must be found to consolidate most of the 
little schools with one room and one teacher into larger schools 
with at least two rooms and two teachers. Investigation shows 
that the average teacher in the little one-room rural school must 
have from twenty to fifty recitations daily. The farce of this is 
manifest on its face. The advantages of fewer and larger schools 
resulting from consolidation are apparent. Among these may 
be mentioned: (1) More money for better houses and better 
teachers; (2) more teachers in one school, making possible bet-
-P-A-G-E-541
—464— 
ter gradation and classification, with fewer and larger classes for 
each teacher and more time for each class, producing more 
thorough and more advanced instruction; (8) increase in enthu- 
siasm, pride, and effort on account of larger number of pupils and 
greater competition. 
6. Another great need of the public school system of the 
South is the public high school. There are few public high 
schools in the Southern States, and nearly all of these are in the 
cities and towns. A public school system without public high 
schools is sadly incomplete, in fact, like some magnificent struct- 
‘ure with only the lower rooms complete. Such a system of pub- 
lic schools can never raise the great masses of men to any high 
plane of general intelligence or civic usefulness and power. It 
will do well if it raise them barely above the plane of absolute 
illiteracy. These public high schools—township, county and 
district—cannot be supplied without more money. The money 
spent on the rural public schools of the South is sufficient to 
provide even five months of thorough elementary instruction. 
The money for public high schools must be supplied here, as else- 
where, by State appropriation supplemented by local taxation— 
county, township or district. 
7. We cannot hope to supply these needs of the public 
schools of the South and place these schools on an equal footing 
with the public schools of other lands and other sections without 
more money. Better houses, grounds and equipment, larger sal- 
aries and better teachers, longer terms and better supervision 
are not to be had without paying for them. There is but one 
sensible and successful way of securing the necessary funds for 
any permanent public purpose, and that is public taxation. We 
have tried for more than a quarter of a century to supply these 
funds by general taxation; we have reached the limit of general 
State taxation for schools in almost every Southern State, and 
we have failed. Other States in other sections and certain com- 
munities in.the Southern States that have succeeded in raising 
the funds necessary for a successful and complete system of pub- 
lic schools have been compelled to supplement the general tax 
by a local tax. More than 69 per cent of the funds for public 
schools in the United States is raised by local taxation. We are 
forced to the conclusion, then, that the South must adopt local
-P-A-G-E-542
—465— 
taxation by counties, townships or districts as the only means 
found effective elsewhere in supplying sufficient funds for suc- 
cessful public schools. 
EquaLity OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHILDREN 
or THE SouTH. : 
With this statement of the defects, needs and remedies of 
our public school system, as we see them, we make our confident 
appeal, in the children’s name, to the people of the South. In 
the unmixed blood of your children, strangely protected in the 
past from taint of undesirable strains of foreign blood by the 
very isolation, pride, independence, and imputed provincialism of 
the South, you have the richest heritage that any people can 
have. Shall these children have a chance through the public 
schools to be all that they are capable of being and to do all that 
they are capable of doing? 
Equality of opportunity is the only foundation on which a 
true republic can safely rest. Equality of opportunity is an im- 
possibility in the twentieth century without equality of oppor- 
tunity for education. Equality of opportunity for education is 
an impossibility for all the people without properly equipped 
public schools. Shall these children of yours, through public 
schools as good as the best, have an equal opportunity for power, 
progress, prosperity, and service with the children of other sec- 
tions and other lands? Are not your children as good as the 
best, and do they not deserve the best? The answer must come, 
and come soon, from the plain people of these Southern States. 
Shall it be an everlasting “Nay” or an everlasting “Yea?” 
Everlasting it must be. Upon the answer hangs the blight or 
blessing of millions of minds, the bondage or freedom of millions 
of souls, the weal or woe of one of the fairest lands on earth— 
may be the destiny of a nation, the perpetuity of a government 
the most beneficent the sun shines on. 
By the traditions of the past, the facts of the present, the 
hopes of the future; by the love you bear your children; by the 
duty that you owe your country, yourselves and your neighbors, 
we appeal to you, the people of the South, to rally to the support 
30
-P-A-G-E-543
—466— 
of your public schools and make them adequate to their high 
mission and their stupendous task.

The resolution to change the Constitution so as to make 
school book publishers and their representatives eligible to mem- 
bership in the association was adopted. 
The following resolutions indorsing the administration of 
Governor Frazier, State Superintenent Mynders and Commis- 
sioner of Agriculture Ogilvie were unanimously adopted: 
During the first year of Gov. Jas. B. Frazier’s administration 
there has been a great educational awakening throughout the en- 
tire State. The number of school districts has been greatly re- 
duced and many small schools have been consolidated, resulting 
in a great saving of money; the State Superintendent has visited 
more than two-thirds of the counties in the State delivering lee- 
tures on educational subjeets and rallying the people as well as 
the teachers to a crusade for better schools. And last, but by no 
means least, the public school fund has been increased more than 
$271,000 without one cent’s additional increase of taxation: 
Therefore be it
-P-A-G-E-552
—-475— 
Resolved, That the Public School Officers of the State, in 
regular session, do hereby express our deep appreciation of Gov. 
Frazier’s faithful and successful work for the public schools, 
and 
Resolved further, That we most heartily endorse his adminis- 
tration, believing that his heart is with the people and that in 
improving the public schools he is doing more for the masses 
than could be done in any other way possible. 
Cuaupe J. Bux, 
P. L. Tarnep, 
WHEREAS, very rapid and substantial progress has been made 
in educational work in our State during the past year. The peo- 
ple are awakening to the needs of better schools as never before 
in the history of the State, and have more faith in public schools 
and a higher regard for public school officers and teachers than 
heretofore. There is better organization and more harmony 
among the friends of publie schools than at any other period in 
our history. 
Much of this is due to the intelligent and untiring efforts of 
our very efficient State Superintendent of Schools, Hon. S. A. 
Mynders. The forces he has set to work will accomplish still 
greater results: Therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the Public School Officers of Tennessee, 
in convention assembled, express to Supt. Mynders our deep ap- 
preciation of the great work he is doing and pledge him our 
loyal, earnest and continued support.   
      
CLauvE J. Br, 
P. L. Harwep, 
Since Hon. W. W. Ogilvie, the State Commissioner of Agri- 
eulture, assumed the duties of his office less than one year ago, 
Farmers’ Institutes have been held in every county in Middle 
and West Tennessee with possibly two or three exceptions, and 
Institutes under his management are soon to be held in every 
county in East Tennessee. 
At these meetings addresses are delivered by a number of able 
men, including the State Superintendent of Schools or his rep- 
resentative. These meetings are highly educative and create a
-P-A-G-E-553
—476— 
desire for better knowledge for agriculture, horticulture, ete., 
and also an earnest desire for better public schools. They or- 
ganize the farmers for educational purposes and much good is 
already resulting from these organizations: Therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Public School Officers of Tennessee do 
most heartily endorse the administration of Commissioner Ogil- 
vie, and 
Resolved, further, That we, as individuals and as an asso- 
ciation, pledge him our earnest support in this great work.

State Superintendent Mynders announced that the Governor 
very much regretted that on account of illness he was unable 
to attend the sessions of the association. 
Supt. Cummings, of Gibson County, read the report of the 
Committee on ‘“‘Should we Have a Uniform Examination and 
Certification of Teachers and a Uniform Examination and Pro- 
motion of pupils?’’ which was discussed by J. E. Scobey and 
A. L. Todd and then referred to the Committee on School Law. 
The announcement of the illness of Capt. W. R. Garrett was 
received with much regret and the association directed the Sec- 
retary to send him greetings. 
My Dear Dr. Garrett: 
I am directed by the Tennessee Public School Officers’ Asso- 
ciation to send you the greetings of the association, to express 
profound regret that you are unable to be present, and the hope 
that you will soon regain your health.

Caprain THoMAS Harpin Paine. 
The Hon. Thomas Hardin Paine was born in Lawrence 
County, Tenn., sixty-six years ago. He was educated in the 
county schools of Hardin County, at Savannah College, graduat- 
ing from this institution of learning in the spring of 1861. In 
the fall of the same year he was elected to the State Legislature, 
as a member of the House of Representatives, and took a very 
active part in all of its proceedings. As soon as this session of 
the Legislature closed, known as the Harris Legislature, he raised 
a company and served as its captain throughout the civil war. 
At the close of this celebrated conflict he was elected President 
of Hardin College, and reorganized it, at which place he taught 
till again elected to the State Legislature, this time to the Senate, 
and was made Speaker of that body. He returned from the 
Legisiature to the Presidency of Hardin College, and remained 
there till 1882, when he was appointed State Superintendent. of 
Public Intructicn, serving from 1888 to 1887. He was then 
elected Superintendent of the Jackson City Schools, and served 
in that capacity till 1889, when he was appointed Commissioner 
of Agriculture, and served until June, 1903, and died in August 
of 1903. In all of his positions as teacher, legislator, State Su- 
perintendent, City Superintendent and Commissioner of Agri- 
culture, Captain Paine ranked among the first men of the State 
of Tennessee. 
He was never found wanting in any of his duties, he had 
warm perscnal friends, he was thoroughly reliable, true to every 
trust, far above the average in intelligence, and always a student. 
He endeared himself to the people in every station, and espec- 
jally as Commissioner of Agriculture. He served as one of the 
organizers of thé Public School Officers’ Association, under the 
administration of Hon. Frank M. Smith as State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, and filled with efficiency and dignity its 
various offices, including the Presidency of it. 
Captain Paine has been in the public eye since 1860, and all 
of his acts served to silence criticism and draw his friends nearer 
to him. In his death our association has lost a warm, sympa- 
thetic friend, and the State at large one of its most faithful and 
valuable citizens.

Prof. L. P. Ford, a native of Smith County, died at his home 
in Carthage in November, 1903. He was a young man of excel- 
lent attainments and exemplary life. His life was given to his 
chosen profession—teaching and school work. He very success- 
fully- taught at Elwood and Gordonsville in Smith County for 
several. years. Te was célected County Superintendent in Jan- 
nary, 1903, and was serving in that capacity when the Grim 
Reaper overtook him. He was a Christian gentleman and an

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES. 
THE PRoPER QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TEACHERS OF PARAMOUNT 
IMPORTANCE TO THE Success oF Our ScHOOLSs. 
Upon the teachers of the State, more than upon any and all 
other classes combined, devolves the solution of the problem of a 
wise and liberal education for the whole people. Our schools, 
like our government, must be ‘‘of the people, by the people and 
for the people.’? We may build grand school houses on every 
quarter section of our State, may enlarge school districts, con- 
solidate our schools, lengthen our school terms, adopt uniform 
text books, grade the schools, hoard up large school funds in 
every county in the State, endow our educational institutions 
with all the wealth of ‘‘Ormus and Ind,’”’ enact compulsory at- 
tendance laws, and yet, without a supply of well-educated, skill- 
ful and professionally trained teachers we will fall far short of 
universal education. 
Schoo] buildings, school funds and equipments are essential, 
but without the teacher they are but inert machinery. The 
power resides in the faithful and efficient teacher alone. Mark 
Hopkins on one end of a log and James A. Garfield on the other 
constitute a university. We need a law on our statute books 
that would prohibit all but professionally trained teachers from 
teaching in the public schools of the State. We can never hope 
to have a successful system of schools, and an educated citizen- 
ship, till we have a law of that character. The need of just such 
legislation is more and more apparent every year. Many of our 
’ teachers are disgracefully ignorant, not only of method of teach- 
ing, but also of the branches to be taught. As the teachers are,. 
so are the schools; as the schools are, so are the future citizens; 
as the citizenship is, so is the State. An uneducated teachership 
means an uneducated citizenship, and uneducated citizenship 
means a poor and powerless State. 
The schoolmaster is the builder, or the destroyer of the State. 
As Von Moltke said of the German school teachers: ‘‘It is the 
schoolmaster that has won our battles,’’ and it is he that is pre- 
paring the nation for the arts of peace no less than those of, war.
-P-A-G-E-565
—486— 
a great Governor, wise legislators, and a powerful military and 
naval ferece cannot save a State infected, inoculated, poisoned. 
and cursed with ignorant, inefficient and incompetent school 
teachers, True patriotism and wise statemanship demand edu- 
cated and professionally trained pedagogues. 
The future hope of the power, prosperity and perpetuity of 
our republican institutions lies in our free pnblie schools. The 
prosperity and efficiency of our public school system depend 
largely —almost wholly—upon the proper and adequate prepara- 
tion of the teachers in our rural schools, and since more than 80 
per cent of our scholastic population, the future citizenship of 
the State, reside in the rural districts, the proper teaching of the 
country children constitute a problem of grave and vital im- 
portance. . 
The first, the paramount requisite to the progress and the 
highest development of the State is the education of her people 
—not any sort of slipshed, vicious education of a few of the peo- 
ple—but the right kind of education of all the people, the rural 
as well as the urban population. The State should furnish as 
good teachers and equally as good educational advantages to the 
country child as to the city child. It is the duty of the State 
from a mere business consideration to develop her rich and 
varied material resources. It is manifest that these resources 
would lie dormant unless developed by education and brawn; 
hence it clearly becomes the duty of the State to educate every 
child within her borders, rich and poor, white and black, city and 
country, for who can divine the productive possibilities buttoned 
up in the ragged roundabout of the country lad? 
The most valuable resources of Tennessee today are not her 
fertile fields and flourishing forests, not her billowy meadows and 
verdant valleys, not her smiling gardens and fruitful orchards, 
not her marvelous resources of mineral wealth locked in mag- 
nificent mountains, ‘‘rocked-ribbed and ancient as the sun,”’ 
nor her furnaces and factories, not her floating wealth of fish- 
eries in placid lakes and rivers of resistless beauty flowing in 
ever-widening grandeur to the sea, not her royal endowment of 
salubricus climate, not her matchless scenes and lovely land- 
scapes of paradisaical beauty that makes a region fit for the 
homes of a happy and heroie race, but her 800,000 children wait-
-P-A-G-E-566
—487— 
ing to be fashioned and moulded into moral, intelligent, and pro- 
ductive citizenship by her public school teachers. Since the fu- 
ture power, wealth and glory of the commonwealth depend upon 
the intelligence of her people, and since the proper education of 
the masses depends upon the adequate and efficient training of 
the State’s teaching force, how important that the educators and 
legislators of the State reach a proper solution of the training, 
preparation and qualification of the men and women who are to 
fit, prepare and equip our boys and girls, both city and country, 
for the duties and responsibilities of life and citizenship! A 
great educational awkening is sweeping over our country—es- 
pecially is this true in this Sunny Southland of ours. A erush- 
ing crusade is being preached against Ignorance, that inveterate 
foe of progress, civil and religious liberty—that eating cancer 
of the very vitals of the body politic—is being outlawed on 
every hand, the popular demand being that it shall not only 
be banished from the humble homes of the laity, but that it shall 
be eradicated and driven out from the sacred precincts of 
priestly pedagogues as well. The times are auspicious for a 
great educaticnal revival and revolution. Great reforms move 
slowly, and are led for years by the patient, self-sacrificing, 
faithful few. The time is near at hand; even at the door, when 
the cause of public education, longer terms, larger schools, 
greater funds, more efficient supervision and _ professionally 
trained and well-educated teachers, will not be pleaded alone 
by a few timid and zealous school teachers. It is already elicit- 
ing the best thought, expression and action of the politicians, 
Governors, Congressmen, Mayors and legislators. Educators 
and statesmen after making careful investigation of the condi- 
tions of our schools, and a close study of the needs‘of our people, © 
are universally agreed that the great need of the times is ‘‘better 
country schools,’’ ‘‘longer terms,’’ ‘‘more efficient teaching,’’ 
and ‘‘mecre intelligent and effective supervision.’ ° 
There are various recognized agencies for the improvement 
and preparation of teachers for their professional duties and. 
services, but the scholastic attainments and the pedagogical abil- 
ity are usually tested and measured by some system of exami- 
nation and inspection and certified by the examiners or inspec- 
tors. The question to be passed upon by this association is, 
“Shall this examination and certification be uniform or multi-
-P-A-G-E-567
—488—- 
form throughout the State?’’ In the judgment of your commit- 
tee (1), the examination and certification of teachers should be 
uniform and simultaneous. (2) The questions should be pre- 
pared by the State Superintendent and State Board of Educa- 
tion, and should be sent sealed to every County Superintendent 
in the State, with instructions for holding the examination, 
grading the papers and issuing the certificate. (3) There should 
be two classes of certificates, viz.: Primary and Secondary, with 
first and second grades in each class. The Primary Scholastic 
Certificate should require an average grade of at least 85 per 
cent, with a minimum grade of not less than 60 per cent en any 
primary school branch, and should be marked Primary Certifi- 
cate Second Grade; the Primary Professional Certificate should 
require an average of 85 per cent, with a minimum grade of not, 
less than 60 per cent on any primary branch, and should require 
of the applicant a fair knowledge of the theory of teaching, of 
practical pedagogy, and have experience of at least one year in 
teaching, and should be maked Primary Certificate, First Grade. 
The Secondary Scholastic Certificate should require an av- 
erage grade of 85 per cent, with a minimum grade of not less 
than 60 per cent on secondary studies, and should be marked 
Secondary Certificate, Second Grade; the Secondary Profes- 
sional Certificate, First Grade, should require an average grade 
of 85 per cent, with a minimum of not Jess than 60 per cent on 
any secondary study, and the applicant should be required to 
have a fair knowledge of the theory of teaching, history of educa- 
tion, pedagogy, school management and school law, and expe- 
rience of two years in teaching secondary schools. (4) No person 
should be granted a certificate to teach who has not completed 
the publie school course of study. (5) The State should work 
up to the point that none but professionally trained or Normal 
graduates ‘should be allowed to teach our schools. 
The State is very careful that none but graduates of first- 
class medical colleges shall practice on the bodies of her citizens. 
She is always very scrupulous that nene but professionally 
trained lawyers from first-class law schools shall be entrusted 
with property of her citizens. How much more careful she 
should be as to who should fashion and mould the character 
of her future citizens! Uniform examination and certification 
of teachers will raise the standard of teaching, improve our
-P-A-G-E-568
—459— 
schools, weed out the ignorant and incompetent teachers and in- 
erease the salaries of the best class of teachers. It will dignify 
and professionalize the business of teaching. The first section 
of the law establishing our public school system ‘declares that, 
“There shall be established and maintained in this State a uni- 
form system of schools.’? We have very little system, and what 
we have is sadly lacking uniformity. 
Fer our schools to be aniform we need uniform text books, 
uniform gradation and promotion of pupils, and uniform ex- 
amination and certification of teachers. In these things save 
the text books we have great multiformity, each county being 
independent of every other county—thus giving us ninety-six 
systems of school instead of one as contemplated in the law. 
County Superintendents are not uniform in their systems of 
examination and grading, and hence we have ninety-six stand- 
ards fcr teaching in Tennessee. A teacher in one county might 
make 100 per cent on his examination and in an adjoining 
eounty he could not make a grade of 50 per cent. If a teacher 
js qualified to teach in one county in the State he ought to be 
qualified to teach in every county in the State. The child in 
the country in the poorer counties is just as much entitled to 
be taught by a first-class, well qualified teacher as the child in 
the cities and richer counties. The public schools were estab- 
lished, the taxes levied and collected for the benefit of the chil- 
dren and not to give somebedy’s incompetent daughter, son, 
cousin or niece a ‘‘soft snap’’ of teaching the district schvol 
through the winter when they have nothing else to do. 
“One of the mest serious obstacles in the way of raising the 
grade of qualification of the teachers in the public schools is 
to be found in the existing system of examinations upon which 
the greater part cf the teachers receive their licenses to teach. 
Of the 31,399 teachers employed in the public schools of the 
State, over 20,000 are licensed by school commissioners upon ex- 
aminations held by them, which are characterized by no uni- 
formity whatever in different localities. Whether a Heense is 
granted or witheld is substantially discretionary with them. 
- They are elective officers in their respective districts, and sub- 
jected to various political and personal influences, sometimes 
deflecting them from the straight line of duty, generally annoy- 
ing, and often resisted only at the risk of losing a renomination
-P-A-G-E-569
—490— 
or reelection. The consequence naturally follows that numerous 
incempetent and inefficient teachers are crowded into the 
schoels, who, but for such influences, would remain unlicensed, 
and their places would be filled by others qualified for the busi- 
ness. I know of no more effectual means of remedying this evil 
than the system already in successful operation in some of the 
States, by which this class of certifieates to teach issues only 
upon examinations held by school commissioners, or other local 
officers with similar functions, the questions for which are pre- 
pared under the direction of the State Superintendent, and sent 
out simultaneously, in printed form, at proper intervals, to 
such examiners throughout the State. A plan of subsequent 
revision, and approval or disapproval of the answers, would give 
stability and effectiveness to the system, and could be easily ar- 
ranged.’’—State Supt. N. Y., 1884-5. 
“Tt is certain that until some such action as that recom- 
mended by Mr. Morrison is taken in all the States, no extended, 
well sustained movement for the perfecting of the teaching ser- 
vice is possible.”’—W. T. Harris, U. 8S. Com. Ed. 
‘fhe improvement of the teaching force is undoubtedly the 
mest direct means ef improving the schools. Never before were 
so many agencies at work for the accomplishment of this pur- 
pose, and their influence is felt even in such districts as are 
described in the foregoing extracts.’’—Ibid. 
“The important part that teachers’ associations perform in 
stimulating teachers, enlarging their views, and increasing their 
intellectual and social force, must not be overlooked. Teachers’ 
reading clubs or reading circles have lately come into promi- 
nence as an additional means of improvement, but the sucecss 
of these various efforts is impaired by the faulty administration 
of which I have spoken.’’—Jbid. 
As regards appointments, although it is required in every 
State that a teacher should hold a certificate, the local officers 
with whom the appointing power resides show a very general 
dispcsition to be contented with candidates who have only the 
lowest-grade certificates. As a rule these represent very meager 
qualifications. State Superintendents make every effort to as- 
certain the grade of certificates held by teachers, and as a result 
of their inquiries we have evidence that in a number of States
-P-A-G-E-570
—491— 
the teachers show a laudable ambition to obtain advanced-grade 
certificates.’’—Ibid. 
N. E, A. at Nashville, 1889, delivered the following on ex- 
amination and licensing of teachers: ‘‘Uniformity of examina- 
tion and. certification should be pushed. The examination of 
teachers and their licenses should be uniform throughout the 
State.’’ In Tennessee there are as many systems as counties. 
Teaching is only a temporary profession, in which 30 per cent 
change every year. J. B. Cummines. 
How SHouLp THE SaLaRIes OF County SUPERINTENDENTS BE

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Association: 
We your Committee on How Should the Salaries of County 
Superintendents be fixed and Upon what Basis, beg leave to 
submit the following: 
After discussing this question at length, and looking at it in 
all the phases possible to the minds cf the committee. with the 
limited time we had, and realizing the vast importance of the 
question and its great interest to the various Superintendents 
of the State, and our consequent inability to devise a better plan 
of fixing the County Superintendent’s salary than the one now 
in vogue, this committee would heartily recommend to this 
honorable body’s due deliberation and favorable consideration 
the following plan: 
That the Chairman of this association appoint a committee 
of two from each division of the State and one for the State 
at large, whose business it will be to formulate and have in 
readiness a recommendation to this body at its next annual ses- 
sion, a bill that will stand the test of close serutiny, and of such 
a nature as not to provoke so much opposition as to stop legis- 
lation. Louis WiuHorre, Chairman.

The minimum attendance upon the schools should be fixed 
by law. Failing to maintain which, such school fands should 
revert to any school in the district which does maintain the legal 
attendance. Should all schools in the district fail to meet iegal 
requirements, then the funds should revert to the county school 
fund and be expended upon schools meeting requirements. We 
think this would increase the attendance, save money, break up 
little, inefficient schools and aid and encourage consolidation.

ScHooLs For THE TRAINING oF TEACHERS 
AND SUPERINTENDENTS. 
All agree that there are at least two acquired essentials nee- 
essary to successful teaching. 
First: The teacher must have scholarship in advance of that 
which he is expected to impart; second: He must have a knowl- 
edge of the science and art of teaching. 
No one denies the fact that many of our teachers in the pri- 
mary schools are entirely ignorant of instruction beyond the 
primary course, and it sometimes happens that the pupil in the 
publie school one year returns next year as teacher. 
It is estimated that 40 per cent of our public funds is wasted 
annually by the employment of untrained and incompetent 
teachers. 
We believe that the injury done to the youths of our land is 
beyond ecmputation and no per cent of the funds can express 
the loss to the children. But we are told that the teacher is 
poorly paid, hence we should expect nothing but poor service;
-P-A-G-E-572
—-493— 
that if we expect talent in the school room we must go to the 
intellectual mart and bid for it; that money, and money alone, 
will prove a panacea for all our ills. 
We admit that there is much truth in the above statement, 
but suppose we could treble the salary of every teacher and 
school officer tomorrow, would that treble the efficiency of the 
schools? We believe not. We believe that when the efficiency 
. of the schools is increased, which can only be done by increasing 
the efficiency of the teacher, public sentiment will be so wrought 
up that the funds with which to maintain our schools will be 
cheerfully provided; hence we contend that the salary of the 
profession will keep pace with its advancement, but will go no 
faster, for today, poorly paid as is the profession, many a so- 
called teacher receives all that he is worth and possibly more 
than his talent would bring if invested in some other channel. 
We do. uct mean to say that the thoroughly competent and con- 
scientious teacher is paid enough for his services, far from it; 
if his salary were doubled he would probably then not receive 
one-half as much as he deserves, but his salary is lowered and 
his influence and prestige diminished by virtue of the fact that 
it is so easy to enter the teaching ranks that the profession is 
erowded by those who have but little instruction and no profes- 
sional training and yet seemingly stand on the same plane with 
the more skilled and competent teacher. 
Unquestionably President Elliott was right when he said the 
teaching is too easily entered. 
The State should require more of its teachers in the future, 
but should first establish some means by which the teachers are 
to be enabled to meet those added requirements. . 
We do not consider it within the province of this committee 
to recommend any specific course of study for a modern normal 
school, but we believe for teachers in the primary schools the 
course should be the academic work of the high school, with two 
years’ professional training added. For principals, high school 
teachers and superintendents, the requirements for admission 
should be coordinate with that of the leading colleges and the 
course should embrace three years’ academic work combined with 
professional training. 
It may be said many teachers cannot or will not take a course
-P-A-G-E-573
—49i— 
in a normal school. Perhaps not, but if a few good teachers in 
each county fix the educational standard for that county, and if 
the Superintendents and directors would exert their best efforts 
to secure the most desirable positions for the best qualified and 
most efficient teachers, it would not be long before it would be 
apparent to all that a little time and money spent for individual 
improvement would be the best possible investment. This will 
go far toward securing an attendance at our normal schools and - 
summer schools for teachers as well. We may talk about love of 
the work, desire to do good, ete., being the chief incentives to 
teach—and in a few rare cases they may be—but we all know 
that pay exerts the most influence with the majority of teachers. 
Unquestionably if the great majority of teachers were tomorrow 
offered a more lucrative salary in some other reputable calling 
the ranks would be greatly thinned the next day. Some clain 
that teaching is a natural gift, that if a man does not possess 2 
natural genius for teaching the art ean not be acquired, and if 
the natural gift be his, training will only hamper him and he 
will be impaired thereby. 
It has been said that teachers. like poets, are born, not made, 
and that all manufactured teachers should seek a new oceupa- 
tion. 
There is an element of truth in this, perhaps. There are 
great differences in natural gifts—no more in teaching than in 
other callings. Because Washington never attended a military 
academy does not prove that West Point is useless, or since Abra- 
ham Lincoln used good, smooth English, but never studied 
rhetoric, does not invalidate that subject. Because some natural 
geniuses have been proficient without special training does not 
disprove its value. 
It is admitted that all teachers must have training, if not in 
the normal school, then in the dear school of experience, where 
the public defrays the expense and the child, alas, too often be- 
comes the victim. 
Realizing the great responsibility of the teaching profession, 
and believing our present facilities for training teachers inade- 
quate to meet the demands of a progressive age, your committee 
recommends : 
1. The establishment of three normal schools for the train-
-P-A-G-E-574
—495— 
ing of white teachers— one located in each political division of 
the State, and one for the training of colored teachers, located 
near the State’s geographical center. 
2. That an annual appropriation of $25,000 for the mainte. 
nance of each be provided by the State. 
3. That free tuition be granted all Tennessee students and a 
scholarship worth $100 be given each county upon competitive 
examination. 
4, That when time and opportunity have been given the 
teachers for securing broader scholarship and a professional 
knowledge, that a law be enacted raising the standard of require- 
ments so that none be permitted to teach that do not possess a 
scholarship in advance of that which they are expected to impart, 
and in addition thereto have been professionally trained.

SHOULD THE State By Law Provipve ror THe EsTaBLISHMENT 
AND MAINTENANCE OF Rurau ScHoou Lipraries. 
Mr, Chairman and Members of the Public School Officers’ As- 
sociation of Tennessee: 
We, your Committee on Rural School Libraries, beg leave to 
submit the following report: 
We believe that to accomplish desirable results in the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of rural school libraries we must have 
some general plan outlined by the State, to be worked out by all 
- the counties of the State, and we therefore make these sugges- 
tions: 
1, That the next Legislature of Tennessee be asked to grant 
an appropriation of $10,000 for the purpose of aiding the school 
districts of the State in establishing libraries in our rural schools, 
such aid to be given only upon condition that the school district 
first contributes for libraries an amount equal to that given by 
the State.
-P-A-G-E-575
—496— 
2. That the State Board of Education be instructed to pre- 
pare a graded list of books from which County Superintendents 
and district directors may select. 
3. That County Superintendents and directors be allowed to 
make such rules and regulations for the proper management of 
these libraries as they may deem necessary for their safekeeping 
and systematic use, and that in the event of mismanagement or 
abuse of said libraries in any community by pupils or teachers 
the State be allowed to withold any further aid from that com- 
munity. Respectfully submitted,

CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS. 
This subject has been presented to the members of this asso- 
ciation on so many occasions and in so many ways that there is 
hardly a phase of it with which they are not all perfectly fa- 
miliar. There is one thing certain, however, and that is the more 
it is discussed the more evident the necessity for it and the more 
rapid the consolidation of schools. As was evidenced by the 
County Superintendents in their reports in the early part of this 
meeting, this matter is receiving universal consideration over 
the State, and everywhere steps are being taken to enforce the 
recently enacted law locking to this end. 
Experience has proven, we are glad to know, that in every 
case of consolidation reported it proved to be an advantage over 
the old way. The little family school is a failure. Lack of num- 
bers means a lack of interest, and a lack of interest means failure 
in the schcol room. It matters little how proficient the teacher, 
if he has not material on which to work he can accomplish noth- 
ing. If pupils are interested they will attend school, if they are 
not interested they will go elsewhere. The result is that only 
about one-third of the children in the school age attend school. 
Further, under present conditions the primary rural school 
teacher is overworked. An actual canvass of a certain county in 
Tennessee brought to light the fact that the teachers of the 
county were hearing on an average thirty-six recitations daily,
-P-A-G-E-576
—497— 
and one poor fellow was actually hearing sixty classes. Of 
course every one knows that this results in very inefficient work ; 
and ineffective work is another great cause for lack of interest. 
Consolidating primary public schools gives an increase in num- 
bers without an increase in classes, and thus makes it possible 
to put two teachers in the primary school at no greater expense 
and sometimes at less than at present. This will give each 
teacher something near the proper amount of work and enable 
each to do effective work. 
In view of these facts and of the great saving and the more 
judicious expenditure of the school fund brought about by con- 
solidation, we, your committee, do most heartily endorse the pres- 
ent law looking to the consolidation of schools.

THE TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS TO CONSOLIDATED RuRAL 
ScHoois aT PuBLic Expenses. 
The conditions of country life are changing rapidly. Better 
roads, rural free delivery of mail, telephone facilities, and many 
other modern conveniences have rendered farm life at present 
altogether different from what it was when our grandparents— 
even when our parents—were school children. The school itself 
must conform to those changed conditions. 
The times demand not only in all other things, but in our 
system of education, cooperation, Efficiency, economy of admin- 
istration and conformity to the law of the division of labor. 
Likewise, hygienic surroundings, personal comfort, personal 
safety, esthetic environment and conditions favorable to the de- 
velopment and maintenance of the spirit of enthusiasm and 
liberality of views. By the consolidation of very small schools 
and the transportation of the pupils to the one central school, 
these ends are all subserved, better by far than by the mainte- 
nance of numerous small schools in a community. Let it be un- 
derstood, however, that we contend for the transportation of 
the-rural population to the central school at public expense only 
when conditions are unfavorable for the maintenance of suitable 
schools at less expense than within easy reach of the pupils’ 
homes. 
32
-P-A-G-E-577
—498— 
In this discussion, we can not enter into the details of argu- 
ment, but shall rather state conclusions based on sound reasons, 
and considerable observation, and the testimony of those who 
_ have had practieal experience. 
” Tt ig universally admitted that a school with two or more 
teachers properly organized is more efficient than two or more 
schools taught separately by an equal number of teachers. Fur- 
thermore, that the incidental expenses, such as heating, housing, 
seating, etc., as well as the relative expense for salaries, is less 
in a consolidated school than in separate schools. 
The transportation of pupils at public expense has now been 
tried practically in some twenty States, and the results have been 
almost invariably favorable from a financial standpoint. We 
may prestme, too, that experience will lead to increased economy 
in this as in any other undertaking. The reports of the United 
States Commissioner of Education show that only § per cent of 
the towns of Massachusetts found the expense of rural transpor- 
tation greater than for separate schools. In New Hampshire five 
out of 118 report the cost the same, and only one reports a 
greater cost. The saving in Southern schools will be greater 
where the attendance is small, owing to the sparseness of the 
pepulation. ‘The experienee of eleven counties in Florida has 
demonstrated this fact, and the system there as almost every- 
where else is growing rapidly in faver. 
in the consolidated school each teacher has fewer classes and 
more pupils, and consequently makes better preparation, has 
more time for each class, and works with more enthusiasm. 
The hygienic conditions usually are and invariably may be 
better in the consolidated school than in the weak and néglected 
separate schools. They may have at the consolidated school a 
better house, better heating, better water, better regulation of 
light, and more tidy external environments. 
With proper means of transportation, pupils suffer less from 
exposure to mud, rain and other inclemencies than when they 
walk shorter distances. 
Pupils when transported promptly home in the care of a 
competent driver, even though he be one of the larger pupils, are 
less liable to fight and hear immoral language than when loiter- 
ing for an hour or two every pleasant afternoon along the road 
home. Because of a peculiar danger which hangs like a black
-P-A-G-E-578
—499— 
cloud of death over those sections of our country having a large 
per cent of negro population, hundreds of young women cease to 
attend school much earlier than they would if they could go in 
safety. 
When several schools have been consolidated at least one more 
competent teacher is usually employed, more people bave an in- 
terest in the school, the term is almost invariably longer and the 
house cared for better, even in vacations. Under these improved 
conditions, trees may be planted, flowers cultivated, the walls 
adorned with pictures and many other things done to cultivate 
the finer nature of the pupils, which would be next to impossible 
in the brief and feeble separate schools. 
It takes a preacher of more than ordinary grace to deliver a 
sermon with his full foree and earnestness to a mere handful of 
people. If with the help of the Lord a consecrated minister of 
the gospel can’t preach to a small number of people earnestly 
once a week when his purpose is to save individual souls, bow - 
can an ordinary school teacher instruct with proper enthusiasm 
“from early morn till dewy eve” during five days of the week, 
classes of one, two or three pupils? 
Narrow-mindedness is a fault of many people, a fault for 
which they are not always personally responsible. The cure for 
narrow-mindedness in young people is personal contact. In the 
new school many of the narrow and selfish ideas which fetter the 
older generation melt away as dew and leave the new generation 
magnanimous and free. 
The difficulties encountered in the inauguration of this system 
are chiefly pecuniary or sentimental conditions. The people of 
a neighborhood may feel that the value of their property will be 
affected by the closing of their school. Or they may have a 
strong prejudice against the destruction of an institution, how- 
ever humble, around which cluster memories of their school 
days. Misconceptions, too, often bias them, especially during 
that period of inevitable controversy during which they are be- 
coming informed—thus, they may base their calculations of cost 
on school attendance and convince themselves that the system is 
too expensive. Some from a spirit of exclusiveness will object 
to the system for a time, just as many did half a century ago to 
public free schools in general. 
Real objections where conditions are favorable do not exist.

The method of introduction is very important. It should be 
gradual, fair and conciliatory. In fact, it is but just for school 
officers to approach parents and taxpayers on this subject with a 
proposition to give the plan a reasonable trial, with the assu- 
rance that it will be abandoned if not found economical and 
satisfactory. F. K. Henperson, Chairman.

Berrer Country SUPERVISION. 
Public School Officers’ Association, Nashville, Tennessee : 
1. Conditions. Good roads, consolidation of schools, county 
board and course of work. 
2. Selection of Superintendents—requiring entire time. 
3. System of observation and assistance or visitation. 
In the general supervision of schools much depends upon the 
conditions—good roads, consolidation of schools, county board, 
course of study, time given by the Superintendent, etc. 
Some of these have been wisely and ably considered by this con- 
vention. And, until some of these things become actual facts 
the work of the Superintendent cannot result in full fruition. 
Then, again, conditions may be all that can be desired, but if 
the Superintendent lacks spirit, enterprise and a clear under- 
standing of the problem, little can be looked for. In other words, 
any system poorly administered will accomplish its ends only 
indifferently. 
How to select the best quality of man for the place is then 
the first question. The present system of examinations in 
selecting County Superintendents has, according to the best tes- 
timony, increased many degrees the quality of our Superintend- 
ents, but it is respectfully recommended by this committee that 
an addition be made to these examinations approaching closer 
the practical work of the Superintendents. We recommend that 
the part upon Theory and Practice be made more extensive, and 
that special lists upon ‘The Construction of School Houses,” 
“Laying Out of School Grounds and Gardens” and “The Art of 
Observation and Visitation” be added. And that each applicant 
be required to furnish the Board of Examiners sworn testimo- 
nials of good, moral character. These testimonials should bear
-P-A-G-E-580
—501— 
witness especially to the applicant’s honesty, industry, personal 
purity and total abstinence from the use of intoxicants. Weare 
sure that these additions would induce a more sincere professional 
spirit, and a professional line of study, and assist much in get- 
ting a man worthy of child imitation. We are sure also that it 
would carry out the law, both in intent and spirit, as to the 
teaching of the effects of intoxicants. 
2. We recommend that a clause be enacted requiring County 
Superintendents to report upon the professional side of their 
visits, and that these observations be made known to the teach- 
ers at the county institute and district meetings and by circular 
letters. 
3. That no Superintendent be permitted to license an inex- 
perienced teacher without a thorough examination. 
4. That ail County Superintendents be required to devote 
their entire time to the work, sufficient salaries being required 
to secure this. Respectfully submitted,

How Can a,Man or ImMorsAL CHARACTER BE BARRED FROM 
Teacnine or Hoping tHe OFFICE OF 
SUPERINTENDENT? 
To the Public School Officers’ Association of Tennessee: 
From the irregularities that are being reported from some sec- 
tions of the State, it seems that the subject, ‘‘ How Can a Man of 
Immoral Character be Barred from Teaching or Holding the 
Office of County Superintendent?” is very apropos just now. 
After due consideration of the subject, we, your committee, 
beg leave to make the following recommendations: . 
1. That the school laws be so amended that, for intemperance, 
immoral conduct, brutal treatment of pupils, incompetency, in- 
attention to duty, or any other good cause, the County Super- 
intendent shall have the power to revoke the certificate of quali- 
fication of any teacher, provided the teacher has been given 
proper notice of such intention, 
2. That teachers holding certificates issued by State Peabody
-P-A-G-E-581
—502— 
Institutes shall have said certificates revoked by the State Super- 
intendent when found guilty of any charges designated in the 
first article, provided proper notice has been given of such inten- 
tion. 
3. That teachers moving or going to another county shall 
present to the County Superintendent, before entering upon his 
examination, a testimonial of character signed by the District 
Directors or by three reputable citizens of the district, or by the 
County Superintendent. 
4, That it shall be the duty of the County Superintendent to 
furnish any information that may be demanded of him concern- 
ing the character of any teacher. 
5. That the certificate of a County Superintendent may be 
revoked by the State Superintendent or State Board of Educa- 
tion when found guilty of any of the charges prescribed in the 
first article of this report, and recommended by the county in 
which the offense may have been committed.

Tue Purpose or tHE County Higu ScHoot. 
(a) How to establish, maintain and manage same. 
(b) How to fix course of study. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
The question as stated opens for investigation the entire 
public school system of the State. As is generally known, there 
exist in Tennessee two classes of public schools. Each class with 
its subdivisions directly serves two classes of people, who differ 
mainly in method of living and in some minor points of social 
intercourse. The two classes of schools are known as city and 
rural schools, and the line of demarkation which separates the 
country school from the city school is found where the taxing 
power of government is denied to the one and expressly given to 
the other.
-P-A-G-E-582
—503— 
All moneys which the State or county governments levy for 
school purposes must go toward the support of ali the schools, 
and looking to this end the State law provides that they shall 
be apportioned according to scholastic population, the ‘rural 
schools and the city schools alike receiving their pro rata upon a 
per capita basis. When such an apportionment is made, the aid 
which the rural school can get is atan end. Not so with the city 
school. When this fund is found to be inadequate, it is supple- 
mented by a tax levy made possible by rights vested in munici- 
pal governments. As a result, schools of the city have larger 
funds, thereby making possible longer terms, better teachers, 
better graded courses of study than the restricted funds of the 
rural schools will permit. In addition to the aid given by 
special privileges in regard to the question of taxes, the schools 
of the cities are operated almost independently of the general 
school laws of the State. In matters of detail of government and 
in variety and extent of scope of work, the whole plan is given 
to the discretion of school boards and city superintendents. In 
nearly all the towns and cities of the State, the schools are or- 
ganized into three departments, namely, the primary, grammar, 
and high school grades, each of which is made preparatory to 
the one succeeding, and in this way an articulated system is to a 
greater or less degree perfected. 
Until recently, the rural schools in the State were divided into 
two classes, namely, primary and secondary schools. By an act 
of the Legislature of 1899, provisions were made for the estab- 
lishment of high schools, which, in connection with the pri- 
mary and secondary schools, makes the rural schools approach 
in equivalency of work that generally adopted by the manage- 
ment of city schools, acting under special charter provisions, In 
fact, the work designated by the law providing subject matter, 
with that which may be adopted by County Boards of Educe- 
tion, renders it possible, taking into consideration favorableness 
of environment, for the rural school to even surpass in point of 
excellency the work ordinarily done by city schools. 
It is easy for.the city to arrange its work so as to make the 
work of one department serve the requirements of the next in 
order, there being uniformity of management and course of 
study making one system obtain throughout the municipality; 
in consequence of which general satisfaction is found in results. 
In operations of the county schools it is different. The County 
High School law provides for a County Board whose jurisdic -
-P-A-G-E-583
—504— 
tion holds for the entire county. The primary and secondary 
schools in their limitations as regards management and work 
are subject to the direction of boards elected for only a limited 
portion of the county, consequently in the arrangement of a 
course of study, it is somewhat difficult to have perfect articula- 
tion when there is such a multiplicity of controlling powers. In 
view of a more harmonious system—one that would provide not 
only uniformity of term but also uniformity in the work which 
all the schools of the county are required to do—it would be well 
to abolish the imperfect system provided by the law of 1878, 
which has provisions for district contro! and county and State 
aid for the maintenance of schools. Certainly do such amend- 
ments seem the more imperative since the Legislature has made 
provisions for county high schools and at the same time placed 
their control under the jurisdiction of county boards whose au- 
thority holds for the entire county. Until this is done, the 
county high school can not be made to fully subserve the pur- 
poses intended when measures were passed providing for their 
establishment. 
Recurring to the subject as outlined: 
1. The Purposes of the County High School—Why was the 
law passed? When a law is placed upon the statutes of the State, 
what does it mean? Ts it, as a rule, the expressed will of the 
people as it affects the subject embodied in the law? Taking it 
that any law is the appointed rule of conduct, having first 
received consideration by the people whom it affects, adopted 
for the government and control of the subjects of a commu- 
nity. It is, therefore, of more than passing importance that 
its provisions be carefully obeyed. That there is expediency 
for the establishment of high schools in the counties of 
Tennessee, is a question that has been settled by the peo- 
ple themselves. While the adoption is not made mandatory, 
yet it is a law which says to the various County Courts: “The 
people of the State, acting under the advice of the educational 
thinkers, have decided that a law, giving to the various County 
Courts of the State such discretion, is a wise measure and 
should be uniformly observed.” There cannot be a question 
concerning the attitude of the people. They have, through their 
representatives, spoken, and, no doubt, many are the disappoint- 
ments which have followed because of the slowness and indiffer- 
. ence which has characterized the actions of County Courts.
-P-A-G-E-584
—-505— 
(a) Salutary Influence on the Work of the Grades Preced- 
ing—There is no county in the State that does not need the ben- 
efits of a public high school. In almost every branch of human 
activity, whether it be in lines of commercial pursuit or whether 
it be in the work of the schoolroom, where encouragement is 
given to aspiring youths to make the most of all opportunities 
in the preparation necessary to make men fitted to assume and 
execute the duties of rulers, the greater the possibilities the 
greater will be the efforts. In this government of ours, where 
countless opportunities are given to boys, there is no overesti- 
mating the good that has been accomplished. The opportunity 
of securing positions of distinction is ever being held out to even 
the humblest child of the land; and, no doubt, such opportuni- 
ties are constantly serving as incentives for diligent effort and 
noble aspiration to many, who would otherwise be shiftless and 
improvident and become burdens to the State. 
Ifa school of the kind provided by the high school law was 
at the head of each county systen, an impetus would be given to 
the work of the primary and secondary grades, such as could not 
be realized by the aid of all other agencies combined. In the 
administration of school affairs, as in the operation of all other 
affairs of society, the highest institution gives vitality to the ones 
immediately preceding. The capstone of any system of public 
education is found ina State University. Such an institution, 
liberally endowed, patriotically supported and wisely managed, 
is the fountain source whence must flow the life-giving stream 
which will invigorate all the work leading to entrance thereto. 
So with the high school, it will do much to strengthen the work 
preceding and at the same time it will do more to vitalize the 
primary grades than the primary grades can possibly do for it, not 
forgetting the mutual dependence ofeach. Ifcounty high schools 
were already established, there can be no doubt that the grades 
of the secondary school would be well filled and the present 
apparent unfavorable enrollment would be increased to a very 
much larger figure. We must admit that the present enroll- 
ment does not seem to justify a claim which asks for an increase 
in the scope of work given to the public schools. following 
the logic of such an argument, it would be well to abolish the 
secondary schools, because very few pupils complete the second- 
ary course. Suppose this done, what would be the effect upon 
the grades of the primary school? Would not the highest 
grades of that school be depleted? The plan of curtailing would
-P-A-G-E-585
—506— 
be kept up until nothing was left—all grades removed and 
children completely barred from educational opportunities. Put 
in the high school and you fill the grades of the secondary school, 
add life to the work of the primary grades and, at the same time, 
provide an institution which is in itself of inestimable value. 
(b) The Connecting Link.—The contention which claims that 
the public school system of the State should be joined so that 
the pupil could pass without stop or break from the primary 
grades to classes in college, is well founded. If there is to he a 
State system of education, such conditions must prevail. To- 
day, without the high school, there is a hiatus between the 
schools of the county and entrance to college. The high school 
will supply the missing link and make it possible for the country 
child to enjoy the advantages which are now given to the child 
of the city. The cities have their high schools, and why not 
give the child of the country an equal chance? But some one 
says, it is not the duty of the State to furnish higher education 
to the individual; that if a higher education is desired, let the 
individual by personal effort get it. Well, there is another view. 
What is the State, anyway? Houses and lands, cities and cor- 
porations, gold and silver do not constitute a State. People con- 
stitute a State. If the individual by an insight into a larger 
sphere of usefulness contributes to the happiness of a commu- 
nity, he is giving in values that cannot be measured by the dol- 
lars that it took to give him the education that prepared him 
for a useful and productive life. With the advantages of the 
high school, preparation will be offered to our boys and girls to 
pass through the common schools to the open doors of a college 
or a university freed from the inconvenience of being forced to 
attend a preparatory school in order to get preparation necessary 
to enter. 
(c) Preparation of a Teaching Force.—In the State there is re- 
quired the service of more than nine thousand public school 
teachers. This vast number of employes, working in one of the 
most important places belonging to the State government, is 
taken for the most part from the list of boys and girls who have 
been pupils in the elementary and secondary sehools of the State. 
Each year an army of new and inexperienced teachers are em- 
ployed by school boards to fill positions as teachers in the pub- 
lic schools. These teachers are not qualified, but positions must 
be filled and school authorities can do no better than to accept 
the best which conditions render available. Whatever may be
-P-A-G-E-586
—607— 
done for the improvement of our schools, nothing can take the 
place of a real teacher, and the value of any school will always 
depend upon his knowledge, character and skill. High schools, 
consolidated schools, libraries and apparatus are only dead mat- 
ter unless they are given life by the vitalizing presence of real 
teachers. The day must be hastened, if we would have a public 
school system of great worth, when the work of improving the 
teacher's scholastic attainments is a matter of realization. Of 
course, we can not expect the high school to meet all the require- 
ments. The State ought to make yet more liberal provisions for 
the preparation and training of its teachers than is possible to 
be supplied by the curriculum of the high school, however am- 
ple may be the work. Many are the instances where a pupil in 
an elementary school of one year becomes the teacher of his 
classmates the succeeding year. Deficient in scholarship, alto- 
gether without professional training, can we expect a successful 
work in the hands of an incompetent workman? Again, repeat- 
ing the assertion that there ought to be ample provisions for the 
adequate education and training of the public school teachers, 
more complete than that which a county high school can furnish, 
yet the county high school can do much toward supplying teach- 
ers equipped with good scholarship. In fact, one of the most 
important functions of the high school will be to give scholar- 
ship to teachers of elementary schools. The elementary teacher 
should have more than an elementary education. The demand 
for better teachers becomes more and more urgent with the in- 
crease of modern school apparatus and appliances. So urgent, 
indeed, is the demand for teachers with power, with purpose, 
with soul, qualified with the proper text-book knowledge, that 
present facilities are powerless to meet it. The county high 
school should be established, and then a provision of law should 
require that no teacher be employed who has not completed at 
least as much work as would be required in the completion of 
the high school course. . 
(d) Higher Education for All of Our Citizens—In addition 
to other reasons, the county high schoo] would furnish means 
for the higher education of all our citizens. Every community 
organized upon a democratic basis owes it to itself to provide 
more than an elementary education for its constituency. One 
of the chief drawbacks to country life is the loneliness of envi- 
ronment. The solitude renders painful the existence of young 
people and something must be done to preserve our rural life,
-P-A-G-E-587
—508— 
and to develop the splendid “ native intellect” of our sons and 
daughters. By virtue of the age in which we live, our people 
must meet the fierce competition coming from other sections hav- 
ing better educational advantages. To do this successfully they . 
must be placed upon an equal footing in an educational way. 
Comparisons show that the progress of States and the producing 
powers of man are measured in direct proportion to the number of 
days spent.in school,and that leadership is determined approxi- 
mately by learning. If we would be great we must therefore 
prepare our citizens to meet the demands which a progressive 
intellect and commercial age is going to present. 
2. How to Establish, Manage and Maintain.—These are ques- 
tions which are clearly provided for by the high school law itself. 
Especially is this true with the question of establishing and 
maintaining. With reference to maintenance, the law is quite 
as clear; but there is some latitude in the question of fixing the 
amount which may be levied for the support of high schools. 
County Courts all the while have had the power to levy taxes for 
the support of primary and secondary schools. Tt was not until 
the year 1899 that they were empowered to levy a tax for high 
school purposes. This has been done in a few counties, and 
schools are now being operated under the provisions of the law. 
A tax of the maximum rate provided by the high school law 
will give revenue sufficient to run a good high school in each 
county of the State. The question then must be taken to the 
various County Courts for action. Much depends upon the 
stress which educational leaders place upon the first question 
in this report, ‘The Purposes of the High School.” Are they 
in themselves convincing? County Courts, as a rule, stand 
ready to obey the will of their electors, and these electors must 
rely upon the teachers and educational leaders for light upon 
this as well as all other public school questions. 
A study of the law as it is written, together with a study of 
its subsequent operation, suggests to the committee the propriety 
of adopting an amendment which would give a greater degree of 
security when once the schools are established. These schools, 
so greatly neeeded ought not to be entirely dependent for funds 
upon bodies that may be influenced by sinister motives or 
feelings of prejudice, being so influenced refuse to provide means 
to perpetuate them ; thereby entailing a waste of moneys already 
spent and defeat the good which would follow their continued 
existence.
-P-A-G-E-588

3. How to Fix Course of Study.—That the State should have 
an articulated system of schools, beginning with the primary 
grades of elementary schools and continuing through classes in 
a State University, is a question upon the issues of which all 
leaders of educational policies are well-nigh agreed. Soin the 
arrangement of the course of study for the county high schools, 
this one feature should receive careful consideration, keeping in 
mind at the same time the purposes of the high school in its im- 
mediate functions In view of the ends to be attained the com- 
mittee, with reference to course of study, makes the following 
suggestions: 
(a) The course of study should be articulated perfectly with 
that of the school preparatory to it; that isto say, that the grada- 
tion from the last term of the elementary school to the first term 
of the high school should be no more marked than the gradation 
of the different terms in the elementary school or the different 
terms of the high schoolitself. The beginning of the high school 
course should be where the course of the school immediately pre- 
ceding it ends, and should be arranged so that the transition can 
be made without any confusion or loss of time to the pupil. Just 
what should be the entrance requirements is a question of great 
importance, and in all cases it should be remembered that the 
life as well as the usefulness of any institution depends upon its 
doing work legitimately belonging to the purposes of its organi- 
zation. Notwithstanding the fact that the temptation may be 
great, in order to have a large attendance, the entrance require- 
ments should be such as to give to the high school only such 
work as legitimately belongs to its province. The next proposi- 
tion, entrance requirements having been determined, is the ex- 
tent of the work or the end to which it shall lead. The high 
school should prepare students for entrance to college and the 
extent of its course of study should meet the requirements de- 
manded by college associations. If it is to serve as a connecting 
link this must be done. The young man or woman who expects 
to go to college has as clear a right to demand this as has the 
student who wants a business or a technical education to demand 
that the curriculum lead him towards his chosen goal. 
(b) It should include courses for students who expect to be- 
come teachers, designed to give them special preparation for their 
work. This professional line should be given large prominence, 
for one of the most important functions of the high school will 
be to educate teachers for the lower grade schools.
-P-A-G-E-589
—510— 
(c) It may, without disturbance, or undue fullness, offer 
short courses along industrial or professional lines for such pupils 
ag may wish to pursue the same. As an advance course in En- 
-glish or science may be given in the first division, its place may 
be taken in the second by Latin, in the third by psychology, and 
the fourth by business arithmetic of bookkeeping or mechani- 
caldrawing. These outlines are intended only as suggestive ones 
. to emphasize the proposition elsewhere stated that the public 
high school should respond to the demands of Jife under natural 
conditions. It may be still further suggested that the curriculum 
for the county high school should be uniform throughout the 
State, and that in some way provision should be made for such 
uniformity. 
In the preparation of this report the chairman has received 
many valuable suggestions from educational leaders in the work 
of the schools of Tennessee. Especially is he indebted to the 
many helpful suggestions given by Prof. 8. G. Gilbreath, of the 
city schools of Chattanooga, in a report upon the same subject 
before an educational conference at the University of Tennessee, 
December, 1903. Respectfully submitted, 
Sam E. Hitt, 
Chairman. 
Tue Practica, Work or tHE County Boarp 
oF Epvearion. 
The very fact that the public school system is administered 
by 3,287 district boards composed of three directors each, and the 
further fact that each district board is independent of every 
other district board, is enough to convince one that the very first 
section of the fundamental declaration of the public school law, 
“There shall be established and maintained in the State a uni- 
form system of public schools,” is a misnomer and has been 
since its enactment; for, with 3,287 district boards of directors 
and each board’s almost unlimited authority to act indepen- 
dently, there are possible 3,287 systems of public schools. Not- 
withstanding the faithful efforts of the State Superintendent and 
many county superintendents and directors to realize the uniform 
system, there is little uniformity. The salary of similar teachers 
for like service is not uniform, the length of the school term in 
the schools of a single district is not always the same, the pupils 
in the different schools of a district may not be graded or classed
-P-A-G-E-590
—b11— 
alike, the uniform text book law is not followed to the letter, 
and citizens of the same community do not have equal advan- 
tages or privileges and never will have them so long as some 
boards and some teachers are monarchs of their respective 
provinces. 
The district system is loose, not only in the selection of 
teachers and the management of schools, but in the use of the 
school funds. Any member of a district board, without calling 
a meeting of the board to consider the matter in legal way, may 
draw a warrant on the County Trustee for whatever he wants for 
the schools and sign one or two other names on it with his own, 
and that warrant will be paid. In other words, 9,861 persons 
not under bond may draw on the public funds in that way. If 
every one were strictly honest this would be a very loose way 
of distributing the school funds, for little or no record is kept and 
there is no one to examine these accounts that are kept. Of all 
funds, public and private, the law protects the school funds Jeast. 
It is an extravagant system. Many aspire to the office of 
school director for no other reason than to move a school house, 
build a new one, change the teachers, or employ a different man 
to furnish the wood.. 
It is changeable. Probably two-thirds of the district boards 
are changed every two years, while more than half of the 
teachers are changed every year. A board ora teacher may make 
plans to accomplish a certain purpose only to have them reversed 
in a few months by a successor. Much of this is an expense and 
a hindrance to the progress of the public schools. A new board 
of directors generally carries with it new teachers, and new 
teachers change the classification of pupils and the method of 
instructing them, and these changes deplete the numbers of 
pupils in attendance upon the public schools. 
To be better understood it will not be out of place to turn our 
attention to one county and at the same time bear in mind that 
whatever may be said of it may be said of others. In Montgom- 
ery county, under the district system, the public school funds 
and benefits were by no means equally or fairly distributed. The 
county being the local taxing unit and the district the local unit 
of school government, it was impossible to have that just equal- 
ization of privileges that should be a characteristic of any 
common cause. While the value of every freeholder’s property 
was assessed on the same basis, and one county board equalized
-P-A-G-E-591
—512— 
the values of all the property, and while every freeholder and 
person liable to a poll tax paid the very same rate of school tax, 
yet, when it came to dividing the school funds among the dis- 
tricts in the ratio of their scholastic population, it frequently 
happened that the community that paid more into the school 
fund received back but a few months of school, while the com- 
munity, just across a district’ line but in sight of the first, that 
paid less money received in return a ten-month school taught by 
competent teachers. To be better understovd, one district re- 
ceived 96 per cent of what it had paid, while another just across 
the district line drew back 264 per cent of what it had paid into 
the school funds. Since every citizen of the county had his 
property values fixed on the same basis as every other one, and 
since every one who pays a school tax pays the same rate, it is 
only fair, just and right that every one be given the same advan- 
tages in teachers, school houses and fixtures, and the same 
number of days of schooling. 
Under the district system the children of one community 
could have an eight or ten-month school taught by competent 
teachers and could easily complete the secondary school course 
and go out in life with a working education, while just across the 
district line the school ran but three and one-half months in the 
year and if the children of that community had gone every day 
school ‘was kept open during their school age (between six and 
twenty-one years) they could not have received even a primary 
education, and if their fathers at considerable expense did not 
send them to a boarding school, they must spend the remainder 
of their lives not at what they prefer but at whatever their 
limited education will permit them to do. On one side of the 
district line they could bave the best teachers to be found, on the 
other side of the line the people could never hope for a compe- 
tent teacher, for their limited allotment of money will not employ 
one who could stand an ordinary test of scholarship. What right 
has the State to treat her children thus simply because they live 
on different sides of imaginary lines? 
The larger the unit of school government the more advan- 
tageously schools can be located; hence it will not take as many 
schools when the county is the unit, and people generally will 
_ feel an interest in all the schools rather than limit their interest 
with the school at their door. 
In Montgomery the county system is working well. With- 
out increasing the tax levy one cent the schools will run eight
-P-A-G-E-592
—513— 
months under the direction of the County Board of Education, 
while the same amount of money used by district boards gave 
an average term of seven months. At the same time the salary 
average will not be lower. Since the board was organized all the 
business has been transacted at the regular quarterly meetings, 
and the expense of the board is insignificant. For the first time 
in the history of these schools there is a county graded course of 
study, and al) pupils will be promoted in the same way at the 
end of each term. So far the results have been entirely satis- 
factory, but even more can be reasonably expected the second 
year, as some time was required to put the system in operation. 
P. L. Harnep. 
THe Practical WoRKING oF THE MontGoMERY County BoarD 
oF Epucarion as VIEWED By A TEACHER. 
The statute enacted by the last Legislature providing a 
County Board of Education for Montgomery County is a wise 
measure. It establishes order where there was no order. It 
makes the county the unit instead of the district. It unites the 
heterogeneous forces of the several district boards into the homo- 
geneous force of one County Board. Where chaos and confusion 
reigned under the old Jaw, system and order prevail under the 
new. 
The good effects of the Montgomery County law are already 
being seen and felt. A strong and growing sentiment for the 
consolidation of schools is rapidly chrystallizing. The consoli- 
dation of schools means better teachers, better instruction, better 
equipped school buildings, longer terms and better “ finished 
products.” Many citizens are aroused on the subject of better 
public schools, They are showing their faith by their works, for 
they are patronizing the rural schools as they have never done 
before. 
The operation of the new law brings the teachers in close 
touch with one another. They now fee] that they have a com- 
munity of interests where formerly they had no such interests. 
Under the old law every teacher was independent of every other 
teacher, and did not have an incentive to work for the harmoni- 
ous development of the publie schools of his county, but under 
the workings of the new law he learns, from the published 
monthly reports of the various schools, what other teachers are 
doing, which prompts him to put forth his best efforts. He 33
-P-A-G-E-593
—514—~ 
recognizes the fact that he does not occupy a world of his own, 
and that he is not the center of the universe. The new law 
enables him to take his bearings and find his true position as an 
educative factor. 
There was no uniformity among the district boards as to salary 
paid teachers and length of school term. Some boards were liberal, 
some were conservative. Some believed that the laborer is 
worthy of his hire, some believed that it was wise economy to 
employ low-priced teachers. All such evils arising from the 
cumbersome district system are corrected by the County Board 
of Education. 
The length of the school term is fixed by the County Board 
..at the beginning of the scholastic year, a wise provision for the 
teacher.. He knows in advance how much work is expected of 
him, and he can arrange for it accordingly. The County Board 
_ of Education fixes the salaries of the teachers as nearly uniform 
as possible, paying them according to their qualifications and 
_ their work as far as it is practicable to do-so. 
_ Under a regulation made by the County Board, necessary 
school furniture, fuel, etc., are supplied in a systematic way. 
Such things are more easily obtained now than they were 
through the district boards. 
The County Board makes a uniform regulation in regard to 
holidays. Every teacher is treated alike. Under the district 
boards no regulation whatever was made or could be made. On 
this question as on every other question each board was a law 
unto itself. 
Under the present law the weak ‘school i is strengthened by 
being given a longer term and in every instance a better qualified 
teacher. Under the old law it was often necessary to license in- 
competent persons, so that weak schools could be supplied with 
“teachers.” The present law enables the County Board and the 
Superintendent to overcome this evil. Poor and efficient teachers 
will be weeded out and their places will be given to teachers who 
are in every way competent and thoroughly equipped for the 
work. Under the operation of the new law it can be truthfully 
said that the days of the incompetent, unprofessional teacher 
are numbered. 
In passing it will not be out of place to say that seventy-five 
per cent, of the persons posing as moral teachers in this State are 
totally unfit for the work that they propose todo. They succeed
-P-A-G-E-594
—515— 
in making shipwrecks of the minds committed to their care and 
in plundering the county treasury of its school funds. ; 
The new law requires each teacher to furnish the County 
Superintendent a complete monthly reportof his work. When 
this is done the Superintendent, as chairman of the County Board, 
issues said teacher a warrant for his month’s salary—thus spar- 
ing the teacher the humiliation of having to make a tour of his 
district to see the clerk and the other directors in order to get a 
warrant for his services. 
As has already been intimated, the. publishing and sending 
to all members of the County Board and teachers at the end of 
each month the monthly report’ which is made to the Superin- 
tendent of the work done, acts as‘a healthy stimulus among the 
teachers. A greater effort is made by each ‘and évery teacher to 
secure the daily attendance of the entire scholastic population. 
This report protects the teacher against unjust charges from dis- 
gruntled patrons, because it gives the name of every pupil and 
the actual number: of days he (or she) has. attended for the 
month. 
It is no longer possible for teachers of equal rank and stand- 
ing to receive unequal salaries. The day of the director's favor- 
ite is gone. The teacher must be one of worth and merit or he 
will not be able to long stand before the County Board. 
A well established county system for the entire State, like the 
one now in operation in Montgomery County, would soon make 
teaching in Tennessee a noble profession, where now iti isa sorry 
trade. 
Ihave no hesitancy in giving the new law ny unqualified 
endorsement. It is along stride in the right direction. The law 
may need some amendments as to minor details, but its main 
features can not be improved upon. It corrects many evils that 
were as millstones about the neck of the old system. It is an 
economic measure. It is practical and progressive. Its opera- 
tion in Montgomery County will make her rural schools better 
than those of any other county in the State, unless other coun- 
ties are favored with a similar law. 
The time for Tennessee to improve its public school system is 
at hand. The policy pursued by the lawmakers of this com- 
monwealth, concerning public education, has been too conserva- 
tive. The teachers and school officers of the State should carry 
on such a campaign for better school laws that their efforts will
-P-A-G-E-595
—516— 
be felt at the polls when the next Legislature is chosen. If the 
public schools ever accomplish that for which they were estab- 
lished, the entire citizenship of the State will have to rise up in 
its might and speak to the members of the law-making body 
that they go forward in the matter of school legislation.

I very heartily endorse what has been said by Professors 
Harned and Lawrence upon the subject of the Montgomery 
County School Law, for it gives advantages that the district sys- 
tem could not give. Ihave considered the county system from 
every standpoint and can see no objection to it at all. 
In our district we have consolidated the schools and this has 
proven a success. We consolidated two schools of thirty pupils 
each. The enrollment in the consolidated schoo] has been about 
100, and the average daily attendance has been second to none 
in the county. At first the people were opposed to these changes 
in my district, but now everything is moving along harmoniously 
and the people are well satisfied with the changes. I can see no 
reason why any fair-minded man can oppose this law, and Iam of 
the opinion that they do not. When the law was first passed, 
and before the people knew what its provisions are, there was 
some opposition, but now I hear no objection whatever. I would 
be glad to see the State adopt it, for Iam sure it can be made a 
great success. M. M. Hussey, 
Member Board of Education, Montgomery County.

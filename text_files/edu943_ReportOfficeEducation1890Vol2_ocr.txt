CHAPTER XIX. 
HISTORY AND STATUS OF PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS AND 
ECOLES GARDIENNES IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES.' 
I.—BELG1UM. 
  The very history of this interesting kingdom is intimately connected with its 
educational interests. In 1814 Belgium was united with Holland, and much was 
done at once by the now government to place public instruction on a good footing. 
These efforts, however, deeply offended the clergy. Restrictions were placed 
on their influence and on their control of their own schools. These they interpreted 
as attacks upon the liberty and autonomy of the Belgian people, and the liberal 
party joined them in the demand for freedom of instruction. Under the influence 
of the French Revolution of July, 1830, outbreaks took place in Belgium, which led 
to the establishment of a provisional government in September, and to the declara- 
tion of Belgian independence in October. The new constitution declared: 
“Instruction is free; every preventive measure is forbidden; measures of super- 
vision and repression are regulated by the law; the public instruction to be given 
at the expense of the state is also regulated by the law.” . 
However, this law was a long time coming. In the meanwhile the clergy, always 
well organized, regained more than it had lost in matters of instruction; and 
the liberal party, poorly organized and compelled to turn now against those who 
had aided them so effectually in the attainment of independence were rapidly losing 
their foothold. They succeeded, however, in successive struggles (more particularly 
in 1835, 1842, 1850, 1859, and 1878) in establishing a system of public education which 
challenges the admiration of the world and which the clerical party, since its last. 
victory in 1884, has in vain attempted to undo. " 
Weare, however, here concerned only with the infant schools of the little kingdom. 
These were originated in 1826 by the same philanthropic spirit that had resuscitated 
the salle @asile in France. In the larger cities, which had a vast industrial popula- 
tion, societies were formed that established and maintained these salles Wasile, écoles 
gardiennes and créches, whose organizations were after French patterns. 
However, in 1857, Rogier, minister of the interior department, summoned Madame 
Marenholtz-Buelow to Brussels. He had made her acquaintance during a session 
of ‘the International Charity Congress” at Frankfort, where she had delivered two 
addresses. On her arrival at Brussels, she found that Madame Guillaume, a kinder- 
gartner from Hamburg, had just established a kindergarten. ‘‘ Nevertheless,” she 
reports, ‘‘the.cause and even Froebel’s name were wholly unknown, and endless 
labor was needed in order to obtain a modest circle of hearers for my weekly lec- 
tures. 
Later on, however, these were attended by many prominent men and women. At 
  
p Prepared for the Bureau of Education by W.N. Hailmann, superintendent of publie schools, La orte, Ind. 2Private devotion to educational progress organized in associations is even now in Belgium the chief hope of the schools, whose interests the liberals declare tobe threatened at every point by the reactionary measures of the ruling clerical party. Thus the workingmen of Ghent are organized as “Lovers of Freedom,” the working women of the same city arg bantled together in an association, sig- nificantly named “Joy in Duty” (Nreugd in Deugd). where we find rather humorous names, pushes“ Radlining Academicans” « Stending Acaiomicians,” “ Marching Academiciana;? “The Guard of the Communal Schools,” The Impermeables,” “The Five Farthings,” etc. The object of all of these is to diffuse instruction among the people and to support certain features of the schools which, for reasons of their own, the clergy are steadily attempting to restrict or abrogate.

  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. ; 677 
the same time a normal class, or course for teachers, was organized; and, at her 
request, the Government (Rogier) invited Mademoiselle Breymann to aid in this 
work. The movement was further aided by Mademoiselle Chevallier, a Parisian 
kindergartner, who had come to Brussels to give instruction to a number of nuns; 
still more by the publication of the Manuel des Jardins (Enfants, which was the 
joint work of Mademoiselle Marenholtz, School Inspector Jacobs, Mademoiselle 
Breymann, Mademoiselle Chevallier, and Madame Reulens, a Belgian poet of some 
note. 
In 1858 Rogier commissioned the inspectors-general of the Belgian provinces to 
look into the merits of the Froebelian method and to report the result of their 
examination. Their report is so classical that some of its principal portions are 
given here in full. They wrote as follows: 
“Prominent educators, filled with the love of mankind, have labored to discover 
the nature and powers of the human mind in order to bring education and instruc- 
tion into efficient and harmonious unity. ‘The influence of new psychological expe- 
riences enabled them successfully to modify the method of teaching. The majority 
of them, however, confined themselves to the enunciation of theoretical principles, 
which indicated only very imperfectly the road to be followed. 
“Froebel supplied this deficiency to a remarkable degree. The principle under- 
lying his system demands that the child be developed by means of his own sponta- 
neous activity. Education should stimulate his physical, moral, and intellectual 
powers, furnish him materials that call forth and serve his activity, and lead him to 
the harmonious and complete development of his humanity.” 
‘The report then goes on to detail the value and meaning of play, and of Froebel’s 
gifts, and continues with the following remarkable thoughts: ‘‘According to Froe- 
bel the family should be the center of education. Yet the family alone is not suffi- 
cient to develop every side of the human being. The kindergarten is meant to sup- 
plement family education by offering opportunities for the practice of social virtue. 
Froebel regards the kindergarten as the most necessary auxiliary of the mother in 
every condition of life. * * * Community of interest in the kindergarten affects 
the young souls much more strongly than is generally supposed. Children between 
the ages of two and seven learn to adapt themselves to a fixed order, to obey a Jaw 
which acts so beneficently because it secures to them much coveted joy and activity ; 
and they enjoy these pleasures only by fulfilling concurrent duties.” 
The recognition of these principles on the part of Belgian educators, and the utter 
failure of French leaders of educational thought to apprehend them, explain the 
fact that in Belgium, in spite of unfavorable conditions and in the face of deter- ~ 
mined opposition on the part of a reactionary government, Froebel has achieved 
even at this advanced epoch his brightest triumphs (at least as far as European 
countries are concerned), whereas in France, in spite of most favorable conditions 
and a government eager for progress, the spirit of his work seems to be hopelessly 
buried beneath heaps of meaningless technicalities. * 
- From Brussels Madame Marenholtz went to Ghent and Antwerp, where her lec- 
tures aroused much interest. Many kindergartens were established in these and 
other cities of Belgium, and the work continued to flourish. However, the major- 
ity of nursery schools (ecoles gardiennes) were still conducted largely on the plan of 
the salle @asile, and a constant struggle was required to prevent reversion into the 
easier methods of the claquoir. Thanks, however, to the determined devotion of anum- 
ber of persons of influence and insight the work prospered into ever greater purity in 
the leading cities of Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Liege, etc., and ultimately the kinder- 
garten triumphed and impressed its principles and tendencies permanently on the 
iy gardiennes (nursery schools) of the kingdom, which had been established in 
1842. 
Up to 1870 the écoles gardiennes had been subject to the exclusive control of the 
communal authorities. In most cases they were asylums for neglected children and 
subject in their somewhat precarious existence to shifting economic whims and preju- 
dices of the communes. The desire to remedy this state of affairs led to the intro- 
duction of the following paragraph into the law of July, 1879: 
Salles d’asile or ecoles gardiennes are to be connected with the communal schools in every locality where 
the Government deems it necessary. 
In consequence of the manifest interest in these schools which followed the pro- 
mulgation of the law, the écoles enfantines increased rapidly in number, in effi- 
ciency, in character. During the year 1880-81 the number of these schools rese from 
394 to 684, and in 1884 their number had risen to 850. Similarly their population 
had risen from 52,500 children in 1881 to 74,000in 1884. In 1879 the expenses for the 
écoles gardiennes and écoles @adultes amounted in round numbers to 2,255,000 franes, 
the state contributing 620,000 francs; in 1884 the écoles gardiennes alone cost 2,300,000 
francs, of which the state paid 900,000 francs,
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
That the minister of public instruction (P. Vanhumbéeck!) had risen to a full ap- 
preciation of the value of these schools and had learned to place a high estimate on 
Froebel’s educational aims and means is amply attested by the circular and pro- 
gramme for the écoles gardiennes issued to the governors of the provinces in Sep- 
tember, 1880. The programme indeed had been prepared by skillful hands, by a 
commission appointed for the purpose, among whom were M. Jacobs, principal in- 
-spector of primary instruction at Rrussels; M. Minnaert, subdirector of the normal 
school of Ghent; Madame Op Den Berg, directress of the kindergartens of Liege, 
and Mademoiselle Van der Molen, from the normal school of Brussels. 
In this programme the aim of the école gardienne, which was now rapidly becoming 
a jardin @ enfants (kindergarten), was formulated as follows: : 
‘To cultivate the physical powers and to assure to the children robust health; to secure by the exer- cise of the senses, an'early development of the faculty of perception to the spirit of observation; to encourage the impulse of imitation, and to stimulate the inventive faculties; to teach children, within the limits of their power, to express clearly their observations and judgments; to habituate them to cleanliness, order, politeness; to inspire them with the love of the beautiful; to train them to obedi- ence, veracity, diligence; above all, to make them kind, amiable, generous. ‘The method 'to be used is based on the natural laws that control the physical, intellectual, and moral development of the child. In its great principles, as well as in its fundamental practical applications, this method has been created by the genius of Froebel. It comprises a series of graduated plays, exer cises, stories, or conversations, song, and manual occupations, which in happy harmony bring into activity all the powers and faculties of the child. In order to succeed in this work of maternal education, it is necessary that tho teacher in the fall apprehension of Frocbel's spirit, should rely mnore on pedagogical principles than on tho study of the details in a manual; that she should shun purely mechanical devices and the mere memorizing of . formulas; that she should know how to vary the talks and invent new exercises, and lead the children to invent, to create; that she should endeavor to acquiro the affectionate and persuasive language of the mother; that, finally, she find all her joy in seeing herself surrounded by children beaming with health and happiness. 
These beautiful introductory words, as well as the painfully detailed programme 
of work, which is reproduced in Appendix D, reveal, together with the many 
cellences, also the shortcomings of the Belgian interpretation of Froebel, which 
will appear more clearly later on. 
The minister of public instruction in the circular accompanying the programme of 
work points to the fact that as a rule “education is a secondary consideration in 
charity nurseries, which attempt to gather under the direction of one teacher from 60 
to 100 and even more children, and expresses the hope that the organization of the 
eommunal kindergartens will be such as to limit the number of children intrusted 
to one teacher to 30 or 40 at most.” A similar observation may be made in ourown 
country. Charity kindergartens frequently unite in one room from 100 to 150 chil- 
dren, and seek to “keep them in order” by placing at the disposal of the teacher a 
number of inexperienced apprentices, who in blundering fashion pay with their time 
for the privilege of “learning the kindergarten.” There is no greater obstacle to 
the diffusion of a proper appreciation of the kindergarten than the charity kinder- 
gartens organized in this miserly fashion. 
The minister of public instruction concludes his remarkable circular with the fol- 
lowing far-reaching words: 
“Tf these institutions are pervaded by the principles of Froebel, if they hold in 
high esteem the cultivation of the senses and of the incipient faculties, if they open 
the heart of the child to moral influence, if they give him habits of order and indus- 
try, there can be no doubt that the primary school and the school] for adults in con- 
tinuing and completing a culture so well begun will secure that rounded education 
which renders the pupil intelligent and efiicient, prepared for individual and for 
social life, capable of working out his own improvement.” 
In accordance with the spirit of the law of 1879, the communal écoles gardiennes 
were freely subsidized by the state, and the need of private enterprise in this diree- 
tion was signally reduced. At the same time strenuous efforts were made to secure 
competent teachers for these schools. For this purpose persons who desired to teach 
in the écoles gardiennes were required to hold a special diploma as proof of a satis- 
factory examination showing among other things a knowledge of the method of 
Froebel and familiarity with the didactic exercises of the kindergarten. Admission 
to these examinations was accorded only to those who had passed satisfactorily 
through preparatory schools, and, for the present, to those serving at the time in the 
      
  
1 The Revue Pedagogique Belge just brings the news (September, 1800) of the death of this educational benefactor of Belgium. He became minister of public instruction in 1878 and filled this important office until the fall of the Liberal ministry in 1884. Tho Revue says concerning the results of his ad- ministration; ‘ Under his administration hundreds of schools were built even in the remotest ham- lets; schools for adults, normal schools, and atheneums multiplicd in every province; special and superior institutions were reorganized, supervision was strengthened, the position of the teachers im- roved and honored; the state created ‘the first intermediate schools for girls and assumed the organ- ization of kindergartens left heretofore wholly to the initiative of private enterprise and the com- munes; the programmes were entirely rccastand_gave to popular education the scientific and integral character corresponding with the requirements of our time; in short, it was a real intellectualawaken- ing.”

  communal écoles gardiennes, in the communal primary schools or in the practice 
schools of State normal schools. 
In order to secure the needed preparation the Government had planned the estab- 
ment of special normal schools for the training of kindergartners. For the period 
which must necessarily elapse before the realization of the plan it had established tem- 
porary normal courses in a number of prominent cities. ‘These courses lasted for ten 
weeks, required a high degree of preparation in those who entered, and gave much 
time to thoroughly professional work under excellent teachers.’ Persons who at- 
tended these courses could secure by suitable examination a provisional license to 
+ teach. They had after that three years’ time to prepare themselves for obtaining ~ 
their final special diploma, which alone could render their appointment permanent. 
In 1880 these normal courses were attended by 830 students; of these 720 secured the 
provisional license. ‘Out of 492 who attended in 1881 439 secured licenses. In 1884 
three-quarters of the teaching corps (over 1,400) had secured the full special license. 
Subsequently additional opportunity for improvement was offered by teachers’ con- 
ferences, four of which are held annually under the auspices of the Government. We 
reproduce in Appendix F the plan of the conferences at Antwerp for 1882. Indeed, 
in his triennial report published in 1884, the minister of public instruction, Van- 
humbéeck, could write: 
«<The exercises of the méthode Frocbel have penetrated, to a great extent at least, 
into all the écoles gardiennes subject to our inspection. There areno longer any classes 
in which the children do not practice the folding, plaiting, and cutting of paper; 
where they have not frequent talks on the persons and things in the school and in 
the family, on the productions of nature and of the arts; where the children can not 
recite some small pieces of children’s prose and poetry; where they are not able to 
render a pleasing song, to execute some regular marches or some gymnastic games. 
In all there is taught a little arithmetic and drawing, and in the greater number the 
children are skilled in producing the constructions and arrangements implied in an 
intelligent use of Froebel’s gifts.” 
Still here, too, popular ignorance and prejudice had compelled the teachers in a 
number of places, notably in the provinces of Hainault and Namur, to make conces- 
sions to false notions and to teach the rudiments of reading and writing in order to 
secure the attendance of children. 1 
“Certainly,” he concludes, “the interpretation of the thought of Froebel is not 
yet perfect in all the schools; a number of the teachers render the work with the 
occupations too mechanical and fail to arouse the spontaneous activity of the chil- 
dren; but in general there is considerable progress, and we may safely say that we 
are far in advance of the old nurseries (garderies) where the poor little children veg- 
etated in idleness and disorder and in a fatal torpor of head and heart.” 
The bright prospects of an indefinite progress, however, received a serious check 
with the accession to power of a reactionary government in 1884. In September of 
this year the beneficent law of 1879 was abrogated and a new law promulgated 
which practically disowns the écoles gardiennes so far as the state is concerned. It 
reduces these schools to the status of 1842, leaving the communes “free to establish 
or suppress écoles gardicnnes without the intervention of the Government.” The state, 
however, reserves the right of inspection over all écoles gardiennes organized by the 
communes or subsidized by the state, the province, or the commune. It still places 
in its budget a certain sum for subsidizing such schools, if the commune solicits this 
aid and the state finds the existence of the school justifiable and its character satis- 
factory. A 
At the same time the plans for the establishment of special normal schools for the 
education of competent teachers were abandoned and the special normal courses, 
established for the same purpose, were dropped. Attendance on the conferences for 
the improvement of teachers ceased to be a matter of interest to the state, and laws 
requiring special licences became inoperative so far as the state was concerned. 
The disastrous effects of this hostile legislation soon became apparent. It is true 
that according to the reports of the Government the population of these schools and 
the number of teachers continued to increase. With reference to attendance tho 
Government finds for the period from the 1st of January, 1884, to December 31, 1887, 
an increase of 33,953 children ,reporting for the latter date a population of 99,296 
children in the écoles gardiennes of the kingdom. 
It should be observed in the first place that the period referred to includes the year 
1884 during ‘9 months of which the schools were under the law of 1879, and, inas- 
much as the population of these schools, on June 30, 1884, had reached 74,383 chil- 
dren, the increase claimed would, by this consideration alone, be reduced to 24,913. 
Again, one chief inspector complains that in some schools children are kept in these 
schools to the age of 9 or10 years, and another regrets he has found in these schools 
“many children of 12, 15, and 18 months.” 
It goes without saying that such irregularities would be more apt to be tolerated 
in the “adopted and subsidized écoles gardiennes,” which are virtually under the con-  
-P-A-G-E-32

trol of religious associations or private interests; than in the communal schools, 
which are wholly under public control. Now, the immediate effect of the law with- 
drawing the impelling and encouraging offices of the Government from the com- 
munal écoles gardiennes was the reduction in the number of such schools and their 
replacement by so-called ‘adopted or subsidized” écoles gardiennes, i. e., schools estab- 
lished under the auspices of religious associations or private interests that fulfilled 
certain conditions which might entitle them to the support of the commune, the 
province, or the state. 
Thus, on September 30, 1884, there were in the kingdom 850 communal and 16 
subsidized écoles gardiennes. On the 31st of December of the same year, three 
months after the inauguration of the new régime, the number of communal schools 
had been reduced to 685, and the number of “adopted” schools had been increased 
to 109, an aggregute reduction of 72. During the next three years the number of 
communal schools was further reduced to 665 and that of the “adopted” schools 
increased to 282, an aggregate increase of 81 schools over September, 1884. 
On the other hand, the contribution of the Government to the expenses of these 
schools had amounted during the period of 188284 to 2,800,000 francs. During 
the period of 1885~87 they were reduced to 1,500,000 francs. At the same time the 
provinces, following the example of the state, reduced their contributions by nearly 
one-half, nearly 350,000 francs for the three years, while the communes increased 
their share of the expenses by less than 300,000 francs for the same period. The 
pverage annual expenditure for these schools fell from 2,435,000 francs to 1,910,000 
rancs, 
That under these conditions these schools must have suffered in efficiency is to be 
expected. In 1884 22 teachers were paid less than 1,000 francs per annum; in 1887 
641 received less than 1,000 francs; the average income of the chief instructresses 
had been reduced nearly 100 francs, and exceeded the average income of the sub- 
- instructresses less than 100 francs. The percentage of teachers furnished with 
diplomas had decreased steadily, and in the “adopted” schools full 40 per cent 
had no diplomas. In these nearly one-half the ‘teachers were members of religious 
orders. Z 
The inspectors, says the official report,‘ while acknowledging the devotion and the 
heart qualities of the teachers, regret that a great number of them are weak in the 
matter of professional education.” In the résumé of inspectors’ reports, prepared by 
M. Sosset, secretary of the council for the improvement of primary instruction, this 
gentleman writes: 
“In the écoles gardiennes conducted by licensed teachers and possessing a suffi- 
cient outfit, the greater part of the exercises continues to be conducted in accordance 
with the Froebel method; but in the others they are far from doing all that is needed 
to strengthenthe body by gymnastic exercises suited to the children’s age, far from 
arousing the faculties of the intellect and from instilling noble sentiments. 
“ Too frequently the teacher transforms into machine work the occupations which 
are best suited to exercise the spontaneous activity; rarely even does she express her- 
self with sufficient ease and correctness to enable her to do useful work in the for- 
mation of the language of the children. 
“Nearly everywhere outside of the great cities there isa more and more pro- 
nounced tendency to substitute for the conversational talks, for the instructive and - 
entertaining games, for the folding and other occupations, the monotonous and usu- 
ally mechanical exercises in reading and writing, in arithmetic and recitation, in 
which the teacher aims more at the form than at the contents.” " 
In view of the fact that even the officials of the government arebeginning to see and 
to venture to point out the growing retrogression there is, possibly, some hope of are- 
turn to the healthy and sensible methods of the law of 1879. In the interest of the 
-cause of universal education, which is the cause of humanity, it is to be hoped that 
Belgium will soon reassume the leadership in the popular kindergarten movement 
which she so summarily relinquished in 18841.

ously to uphold the cause. At their own expense they not only maintain the kinder-

news that the Keole Normale des Humanitée of Liege, devoted to the education of professors for inter- 
mediate schools, has been suppressed, and that a similar fate is in store for the Ecole Normale des 
Sciences at Ghent. The On Pee of the Federation in the vain hope of finding relief for this sad con- 
dition of affairs has decided to petition the King.

gartens previously established, but add new ones where they seem needed, organize 
training schools for kindergartners, teachers’ conferences, and do all in their power 
to ‘hold the fort.” This is so much the more commendable, since similar additional 
burdens are heaped upon them by the Government’s neglect of the schools for adults 
and by its parsimony with reference to communal primary schools and normal 
schools. The present status of the kindergarten movement in Belgium, so far as its 
brighter side is concerned is, therefore, best studied in the work of her larger c’ n 
such as Brussels, Antwerp, Liege, Ghent. To these we turn for the purpose indi- 
cated. 
     
BRUSSELS. 
In 1877 Brussels assumed full charge of its six nursery schools (écoles gardiennes), 
and in 1878 M. Allard, the superintendent of publie instruction, announced that 
after the lapse of a certain period the teachers should undergo an examination which 
would decide their fitness for the work, This examination was held under the pres- 
idency of his successor, M. Buls. He was struck with the lack of. suitable prepara- 
tion on the part of the teachers and with their scanty knowledge of Froebel. Con- 
sequently he called upon Madame J. Guillaume to give them a course of normal in- 
struction which should prepare them for the final trensformation of the écoles gardi- 
ennes (salles @asile) into kindergartens (jardins @enfants). 
He prepared at the same time a most remarkable report to the communal council, 
and drew up regulations, which were adopted in October, 1879, and have remained in 
force to this day. Concerning this document, Madame Guillaume writes to me under 
date of April, 1890: ‘It is the opinion of competent persons that this is the loftiest 
and at the same time the clearest presentation of this subject. We still strive to 
realize this programme with the same persistence as during the earliest period.” 
A few extracts from the report of M. Buls will prove the correctness of Madame 
Guillaume’s judgment. He writes: 
“The kindergarten is the basis of the primary school. Without it public educa- 
tion is without foundation and vitiated from the start. 
“When the primary school is not preceded by a kindergarten it is too often filled 
with wretched, stunted, coarse children, bred in hovels and already corrupted by 
street vagabondage. 
“The kindergarten should supplement the material and intellectual insufficiencies 
of parents who are unable to watch over the earliest physical and moral develop- 
ment of their children. It should come to the aid of too numerous families, and 
this aid will be more efficacious to them than the meager allowances of the bureau 
of charities. 
“Tf, however, it is to accomplish its purpose well it must be organized in accord- 
ance with Froebel’s method—i. e., it must be a place where the child’s powers, his 
intellect, and moral sense are cultivated in a rational manner, based on the observa- 
tion of the child’s faculties. 
“The kindergarten, then, is to fulfill a portion of the mother’s duty. Itis nota 
school in the ordinary sense of the word. It is not its business to teach, but to 
develop the child’s intellect by an appeal to his creative powers, by furnishing him 
impressions which they could not receive in their ordinary surroundings. 
“ By means of a graded series of games, of exercises, occupations, and of moral and 
instructive stories, the children are led to see well, to hear well, to acquire correct 
ideas, to feel an interest in all that is around them; they are led to observe, to 
express themselves clearly, to use their inventive and creative powers; they learn to 
appreciate the necessity of order and cleanliness, they acquire a taste for work, and 
learn to love goodness—the triple basis of all esthetic and moral education. 
“The things to be followed in the kindergarten should not be chosen, therefore, 
because of their knowledge value, but rather because of the facilities they afford for 
leading the children to observe, to think, and to express their ideas. 2 
“They should be aroused from the intellectual somnolence due to ignorance, 
avoiding with care, however, all stimulation by artificial means; itis not by tickling 
that a child should be brought to laugh. Joy, like curiosity, should result from the 
natural expansion of their being, content to live and attracted by the novelty of 
external things. 
“The kindergartner will labor to combat the natural selfishness of the child by 
giving him opportunities to be good and amiable to his comrades. 
“Tn order to furnish to the primary school well-prepared children the kindergart- 
ners should be penetrated with the spirit of Froebel’s method, and should in no way 
indulge ina hybrid compromise between kindergarten and school.” 3 
He then continues to demand for the kindergartner careful normal preparation ; 
advocates a moderate number of children as the share of each teacher; discusses the 
arrangement of the buildings and grounds, the furniture, ete. Concerning the 
government of these institutions, he says: 
“The government of the kindergarten should be humane, but not effeminate. The 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
children should learn to rely on themselves, to bear the consequences of their thought- 
lessness and awkwardness, to clean what they have soiled, to help themselves; in 
all things, they should be led by a gentle but firm hand. 
“The children of the advanced division should work as much as possible for those 
of the lower divisions, so that they may gain the feeling of that solidarity and fra- 
ternity which ought to unite all human beings. 
“They will then feel the satisfaction—so dear to children—of knowing that they are 
useful; they will taste the pleasure of being busy aud working for those weaker than 
themselves, a sentiment which is the foundation of the great law of charity and 
love, to which is attributed the superiority of modern society over ancient civiliza- 
tion.” 
He concludes this remarkable report with a tribute and an appeal to the ladies of 
Brussels, as follows: 
“We would establish, in connection with each kindergarten, aschool committee. 
“For this purpose we would draw on the assistance of the ladies of Brussels. What 
better way to employ their kindness, their natural charity, than this watching over 
the education of the poor children. How frequently could they find opportunities 
to give useful advice to mothers and to mitigate concealed suffering! ‘They ought 
to aid us in this great work of civilization; it is they who, above all else, could be- 
come the uniting link between the rich and the poor, the ignorant and the cultured. 
“ Fortunately our country is free from the hatred of classes which so cruelly divides 
the rich from the poor in other lands. Would that all the women whom fortune has 
favored might understand that on their charity and on their devotion to the interests 
of the people depends the maintenance of this favorable condition of affairs.” 
From the regulations appended to this report we gather the following facts: Chil- 
dren from 3 to 6 years old, and living in the commune, are admitted to the kindergar- 
tens gratuitously. The kindergartens are open from 8 o’clock a. m. to 40’clock p.m. 
Children may bring their dinners and remain during the noon hour under the super- 
vision of assistant teachers and janitors. Children are received at any hour of the 
day. The pedagogic supervision is confided to an inspectress. ‘The principal of the 
kindergarten is subordinated to the inspectress; she has charge of thegeneral super- 
vision of the kindergarten, and fulfills at the same time the special functions of kin- 
dergartner in one of the divisions of the school. In addition to the principal, the 
kindergarten employs other kindergartners, assistants, and women for general serv- 
ice. They are forbidden from absenting themselves without the permission of the 
Aldermanic College, to engage in any work not prescribed, or to sing songs and dis- 
tribute images not approved by the college, to receive presents of any kind from the 
parents. Four times a day the kindergartners record the degree of temperature; at 
the close of each week they report the average to the principal, who transmits the 
report to the hygienic bureau. Children before presenting themselves at the kin- 
dergarten should be washed and their hair combed; they should be provided with 
a handkerchief; they should change their linen on Mondays and Thursdays. . Every 
day before beginning the class work the kindergartners inspect the handkerchiefs, 
and ‘see to it that the children’s stockings are properly fastened, their shoes tied 
and blacked. They demand particularly careful bathing of the body, and insist that 
the boys’ hair be cut close and the girls’ hair well combed. Untidy children are 
washed by the women for general service. Fifteen minutes before the departure of 
the children, they are again inspected, so that they may besent home perfectly clean 
and in good condition. In addition to the food brought by the children who remain 
at noon, they are furnished an abundant supply of substantialsoup. They take their 
maeals seated in good order and under supervision. Itis formally forbidden to strike 
the children; they should always be reprimanded with gentleness. Only in cases of 
absolute necessity they may be requested to take a seat away from the others, but ~ 
always in sight of the teacher, or denied participation in the exercises; yet these 
punishments shall not last longer than during one exercise. For each kindergarten a 
special school committee is appointed whose mission is to observe the work and to 
suggest improvements to the communal administration; to seek out children who do 
not frequentthe kindergarten; to see to it that the care and discipline of the school 
be maintained in the kindergarten. Each of these committces consists of six members 
chosen by the communal council, and holding office for four years. 
To the courtesy of Madame Guillaume, inspectress of the Brussels kindergartens, I 
owe an account of A Day in the Kindergarten, prepared by Mademoiselle Van Molle 
André, as well as the Walk of the Children and the story of Tony, written by other 
kindergartners. These accounts, taken from the actual work, will convey an excel- 
lent idea of the spirit and character of the work done at Brussels. They are ap- 
pended to this report, together with a translation of the official program and 
time table (see appendices A, B, C, D). 
The perusal of these appendices will convince the reader that-these kindergartens 
have, indeed, much to commend them. There breathes in them a spirit of unassum- 
ing charity and sincere respect for childhood, a generously humane tendency which  
-P-A-G-E-35
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 683 
does great credit to the mind and heart qualities of all concerned in the work. On 
the other hand, the plan of the work in each section, as indicated both in the pro- 
gram and in Mademoiselle André’s account, seems to take its points wholly from 
the means and subjects of instruction and takes little account of spontaneous inter- 
est and the immediate needs of self-activity in the child’s development. 
ANTWERP. 
Concerning the kindergartens of Antwerp I owe much valuable information to 
Jan Van Rijswijck, who occupies the important position of director of public instruc- 
tion in that favored city. In the letter accompanying the documents which he sent 
me he says: : . 
“Jt is said that our institutions may be considered as the best attempt made in 
that direction in Belgium and, perhaps, in Europe. The result has been successful 
beyond our expectations. The pupils of our baby-schools (kinder-tuinen, or jardins 
@enfants) on entering the primary school, at the age of 6 or 6}, are already used to 
the discipline of the school and prove the best pupils. Their understanding is 
quicker and clearer, since it has been developed by rational practice and graduated 
exercise.” 
Mr. Van Rijswijck transmitted to me at the same time an account of Three Days 
in a Kindergarten of Antwerp (which forms appendix E) and amonograph on the 
Kindergartens of Antwerp by Alexis Sluys, published in 1890. From this valuable 
monograph we learn that the kindergartens were introduced in Antwerp by M. 
Evariste Allewaert, for many years director of public instruction of the city of 
Antwerp. ‘M. Allewaert,” says the monograph, ‘‘had learned to appreciate the 
fact that the work of the primary school was virtually without foundation so long 
as it could not rest on a well-directed early education. He resolved that in orderto 
secure this early education he would substitute the action of the commune for 
that of parents unable to fulfill their duty. He was theoretically, atleast, acquainted 
with the system invented by Froebel to stimulate in children the unfolding of all 
their faculties. In 1875, he undertook a journey to Germany and to Holland, in order 
to familiarize himself with the organization of kindergartens. In the following 
year he sent to Leiden to the Froebelian Normal School of M. Van Aerdenberg three 
communal teachers chosen from among the most intelligent; three others were sent 
later on. These teachers followed the course of the Froebelian school for three 
years and familiarized themselves completely with the theory and practice of the 
kindergarten work. In 1880 they were placed at the head of the first maternal 
schools opened at Antwerp by, the communal administration. Since that time, a 
dozen additional institutions of this kind have been opened. ‘They contain actually 
a population of 4,200 children, a personnel of 13 principal teachers, 85 teachers, 2 
piano teachers, 45 assistants, 27 servan The budget of this department comprises 
10,040 franes for general expenses, 168,585 francs for salaries, besides 2,100 francs for 
the normal Froebel course.” 
M. Sluys ascribes the success and superiorty of the Antwerp kindergartens to the 
determination and care with which M. Allewaert insisted on the pedagogicprepara- 
tion of his teachers. The paragraphs which M. Sluys devotes to this question should 
be carefully read and considered by the teachers and parents of American children, 
and more particularly by those among them who control the schools of the 
land. Much of the noisy inefficiency, weak sentimentality, and quackery that 
characterizes some American kindergarten work might be avoided by heeding the 
example of wisdom afforded by the deliberate modes of procedure followed by M. 
Allewaert. ‘Many persons,” writes M. Sluys, “imagine that it is possible to 
prepare a kindergartner with little expense and trouble; that it is sufiicient to re- 
quire of the candidate a little elementary information and the attendance during a 
few weeks on a limited course where the theory of the gifts and occupations is ex- 
plained. This is a serious blunder. This practice of breakneck speed, followed in 
So many cases, has given us, with a few exceptions, only very mediocre results; and 
to this hasty preparation is due the failure of the Froebel system in a great number 
of kindergartens, which, in spite of external appearances, are in reality only ‘gar- 
deries de moutards,’ into which the spirit of the master has not penetrated and 
where the gifts and occupations have fallen into simple routine devices. The first 
education of children requires extensive information and many special personal 
qualities and aptitudes. 
“The kindergartner should be at least as well informed-as the elementary teacher; 
she should know and understand the physiology, hygiene, and psychology of child- 
hood, and have thorough control of the theory and practice of the Froebelian exer- 
cises; she should, besides, know how to observe the character of the children and, 
what is still more difficult, she should know how to play with them; tact and good 
taste are other necessary conditions of success in her mission. Our ordinary normal 
schools (M. Sluys himself is director of the normal school of Brussels) are not in       
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
condition to develop in young girls that fund of knowledge and aptitude. The 
Froebel system, which in reality ought to be the foundation of the pedagogic cul- 
ture of our teachers, barely forms in these schools the subject of a theoretical course 
comprising a very limited number of lessons. Besides, the girls who graduate from 
our normal schools generally have little taste for the work of Froebelian teachers 
and do not feel at home in the kindergarten. Indeed, because of the unpedagogic 
character of our normal schools, the primary schools, in spite of the reforms intro- 
duced in them, continue to bear the character rather of intermediate schools, where 
literary and scientific matters are taught, than of Froebel schools which concern 
themselves with the integral culture of the faculties by means of methods based on 
the very nature of the children, 
“When those who direct public instruction shall have reached a scientific idea of 
the education of children, our normal and primary schools will undergo a thorough 
transformation; the latter will become institutions of integral education in which 
Froebelian methods will be used with all the developments they imply, and the nor- 
mal schools will assume their true character of pedagogic and professional institu- 
tions devoted exclusively to the science and art of education. 
“We said above that Mr, Allewaert had sent to Leyden six primary teachers who 
studied there for three years the Froebel system. To this first nucleus was intrusted 
the task of organizing the first kindergartens at Antwerp, and to prepare the per- 
sonnel that might be needed later on. 
“This preparation is accomplished as follows: The most intelligent, the best 
gifted young girls that have obtained a certificate of capacity in the communal 
schools of Antwerp, are admitted to the normal Froebel course, which is given by 
special teachers, from 6 to 8 o’clock in the evening, four times a week. Among these 
pupils, 15 to 16 years of age, a committee chooses the assistants, who, for at least 
two years, practice in the kindergartens under the direction of trained kindergart- 
ners. Thus these young girls become initiated in the theory and practice of the 
profession, * * * A final examination, both theoretical and practical, confers 
on those who have furnished proofs of real capacity the diploma of Froebelian 
teacher. 
The buildings are well constructed for the purposes in view. The accompanying 
ground plan of an Antwerp kindergarten has been kindly transmitted to me by Mr. 
ee Rijswijck. Its description, however, I cull again from the monograph of Mr. 
uys.

“a central corridor divides the building into two parts. Four class rooms face 
four play rooms. These arrangements permit the admission of a double population, 
for all these rooms are constantly occupied. During every hour of the day there 
are always four groups in the class rooms, busy with the gifts and occupations, and 
four groups in the play rooms, singing, dancing, or going through with gymnastic 
exercises. 
“The class rooms (in our ground plan, the play rooms) open on a covered court 
connected with an open play ground which is bounded hy garden subdivided into 
plats. Here, when the weather permits, the children play freely, breathing pure 
air and playing gardener, for each school (or group) is provided with a suflicient 
number of watering pots, spades, rakes, adapted to the size of the young horticul- 
moriate, 12." s* 
“The children remain at school the entire day, from 8:30 to 4 o’clock. At noon 
they are served a substantial meal, consisting of soup, vegetables, and meat or milk. 
Until 1884 this meal was served gratuitously to the poor children; but the reaction- 
ary ministry suppressed this state aid to the kindergartens, hoping thereby to sup- 
press them,' and the communal administration of Antwerp has been compelled to 
require of the parents a small fee for the noon meal. The expenses for this purpose 
amount annually to 62,311 francs, which is .0626 francs per meal, or 15.65 francs per 
year for each child. 
“The class furniture consists of small tables, to which two small benches with backs 
are adapted on the same side. All the children, therefore, front the blackboard, on 
which the teacher demonstrates her lessons. This arrangement has some advan- 
tages, but also serious drawbacks. It tends to transform the kindergarten into a 
school. Now, the kindergarten should be rather an overgrown family than a school 
in miniature. We prefer large tables around which the children can be seated com- 
fortably; * * * the children should be at liberty to talk with each other during 
all the exercises, to communicate to each other their impressions, desires, plans. 
This is the very essence of the Froebel system. The Antwerp furniture excludes 
this familiarity. The child is too much isolated in his place; he has no companion 
during his exercises. * * * The teacher, too, is too much tempted to give col- 
lective instruction, not leaving enough initiative to her little world of active and 
spontaneous beings.” . 
Concerning the exercises, the reader will find much in Appendix E, Three Days in 
an Antwerp Kindergarten, and in the official programme printed below. Mr. Sluys 
speaks in enthusiastic commendation of their drawing. In this the artificial Froebel 
drawing tends to disappear and to make room for drawing from nature. He men- 
tions, too, with praise, an exercise he witnessed in a kindergarten. The teacher told 
a story which appealed strongly to the children’s sympathies. Immediately after- 
wards, in the playroom, the scenes of this story furnish the subjects for the game, 
which is accompanied by a song whose stanzas recall the incidents of the story. 
In their songs the children are accompanied by the piano, which all the teachers 
must know how to play. On the whole, the teachers have enough to do. They 
keep a daily journal in which they record all the exercises made; they are expected 
to make careful preparation for every exercise of the following day. They enter 
the school at 8 o’clock a. m.,.and do not leave it until sometime past 4 o’clock inthe 
afternoon. They serve the noon meal of the children. For this the regular teachers 
are paid 1,000 to 1,600 francs. The directresses or principals are paid 1,600 to 2,500 
franes and lodging, or an indemnity of an additional 1,000 franes to pay for a lodg- 
ing; and the assistants receive annually 350 to 600 francs. 
Such is, in its principal features, the organization of the kindergartens of Antwerp. 
In 1887 the communal kindergartens of this city were attended by over 4,000 
children, taught by 95 teachers of all grades. In 1889 the city expended for her 
kindergartens 279,727 francs. - 
    Liner. 
An interesting letter addressed to me by Mr. Reuleaux, director of public instruc- 
tion at Liege, not only gives an account of the character of the work done in that 
city, but indicates the high plane from which the Belgian teachers view educa- 
tional work. 
‘It is claimed that by the reactionary revolution of 1884, which gave supremacy to the clerical party, there has been constant retrogression in educational work. This retrogression is felt more particularly in the écoles enfantines, or kindergartens, and in the schools for adults. Ina proot of this the following facts are cited: ‘The expenses for écoles gardiennes (kindergartens) and adult_schools, which in 1882, 1883, and 1884 reached the average of 3,816,911.55 francs, fell in 1877 tc 2,890,431.36 
francs. This, in spite of the fact that the communes pay more under the present administration. The annual. average of the communes rises from 1,511,410.24 francs to 1,602,093.86 francs. ‘The share of the provinces is reduced from 248,839.24 francs to 132,294.05 francs. However, the greatest economy ‘fails to the share of the state. The average which, under the preceding ministry had reached 1,581,041.67 francs, was reduced during the following three years (1885-'87) to only 804,491.77 francs. This economy is due to the suppression of more than 1,600 kindergartens and adult schools. 
     
-P-A-G-E-39
    
PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. ‘ 687 
“Our city,” he writes, “is endowed with 17 kindergartens, established in buildings 
constructed and arranged with reference to. their special purpose, where light and 
air are supplied in abundance, and provided with covered and open playgrounds, 
where children have an opportunity to play in every season. 
“The kindergartens are attended by more than 4,000 children. The educational 
methods of Froebel are used in them. 
“Inasmuch as the object of these schools is to develop the child physically, intel- 
lectually, and morally, the teachers should be in possession of at least solid, if not 
extended, general information, of a knowledge of pedagogies, of special and general 
methodology, psychology, and hygiene. 
“4 Froebel normal course, established in 1862 by the city of Liege, secures capable 
instructors. In the application of the means proposed by Froebel for the develop- 
ment of the faculties of the child, the teachers aim to leave it as free as possible; 
they avoid formal lessons, engage in motherly story-telling, in which the child has a 
large share, and from which are excluded all set or memorized answers. 
“Tn the oceupations they distinguish three phases of work: (1) The instruction by 
which the child learns intuitively how to make a weaving pattern, a folding form, a 
building form, ete.; (2) the practice, in which the child carries out given direc- 
tions; (3) the free work, which permits the child to give vent to his inventive and 
-creative powers, 
“The kindergarten is a large family or asmall society; the teacher leads the child 
gently to the practice of family and social virtues. Here orderand discipline are ob- 
tained, not imposed; they rest on the respect and affection with which the teacher 
inspires the child; on the variety which she brings into the games and occupations; 
on the tact with which she makes them pleasant to him and insures his success in 
their use. The pupil never acts under compulsion; if he refuses to play or to work, 
the school does not insist; he is not lectured, and very soon he returns of his own de- 
sire to take his place among his companions. The children are happy in these in- 
stitutions. Indeed, those who are kept away for a time from any cause whatever 
impatiently ask to be brought back to them. 
“The primary school teachers notice a remarkable difference in the development 
of pupils that come to them from kindergartens, as compared with those that come 
directly from the home. In another direction we notice the happy effect of these 
institutions on the physical development of the children, who usually enjoy in them 
robust health. This result is due to the good hygienic conditions of the buildings, 
to the judicious care bestowed on the pupils, to their games and other gymnastic 
exercises, to the joyousness and cheerfulness of the place, to the wholesome and 
varied food served to the children every day at noon. Those among them whose 
health seems to demand this are given, besides, doses of cod-liver oil. 
“These results influence the whole life of the child, and this influence will be more 
deeply felt in the measure in which the primary school will follow Froebelian prin- 
ciples in its work. 
“These principles may be summed in a few words: Direct observation (intuition, 
anschauung), and consequent development of the spirit of observation, of perception, 
and the acquisition of personal ideas; application of the acquired knowledge to 
manual occupations, development of manual skill, of keenness in estimating measure- 
ments, of the intuitive impulse, and of the creative powers; games which establish a 
happy equilibrium between the intellectual and the physical education. 
“No one to-day doubts the necessity of basing all primary instruction on intuition, 
and very few consider the manual occupations incompatible with the programme of 
these schools. Manual work is recognized as an educational factor, and is derived 
directly from the Froebelian occupations; the child whose sight and touch have been 
trained will pass without trouble to more solid work, based on geometrical applica- 
tions, such as card board work, woodwork, ete. 
“ The manual work of the household has an equally obvious relation to the Froe- 
belian occupations; indeed, the games furnish the occasion for affording practice 
to the little girls in household work, e.g., the games of the housekeepers, of the 
cooks. Pricking and embroidering prepare for sewing; weaving, for mending and 
darning; cutting out, for the handling of scissors; drawing, the coloring of engray- 
ings, the decoration of the classroom, and the selection of the colors of chains and 
festoons, develop the «esthetic sense. % 
“Reading, writing, and knitting are reserved for the primary school, inasmuch as 
these things fatigue the children, without benefit to their development. 
“Froebel is the precursor of the introduction of manual work into the primary 
schools. He has the glory of having opened new outlooks to educators, of having 
taught them the fact that the only salutary education is that which prepares the 
child for life; that which does not separate study and work, but merges the one into 
the other.” 
The arrangements and order of work in the kindergartens of Liege are still vir- 
tually the same as reported for the Paris Exposition of 1878 by Mme. Op Den Berg,

general directress of the kindergartens of the city. They seem to differ little in the 
essentials from those of Antwerp and _ Brussels, so satisfactorily described in the ap- 
pendixes to this report. We notice here, too, certain indications of schoolish for- 
malism which, however, under the circumstances, may be excusable. There is much 
of the military subordination in the distribution of teachers. Each establishment 
has a first kindergartner, who receives her orders from the general directress and 
controls the work of the second and a number of third kindergartners.. The chil- 
dren, seated on benches before kindergarten tables, face in the same direction, an 
arrangement which can not fail to place the children in more or less schoolish sub- 
ordination over against the artificially superior teacher. 
This tendency is intensified by the fact that the tcacher is seated on an elevated 
platform, from which she can overlook and control the entire class, and, perhaps, 
still more by the practice of having each child on entering the class room formally 
salute the teacher, take from a basket strips or sheets of paper, and engage quietly 
in individual work at his place. This practice evidently has no other object than 
that of keepirg the child quietly busy; for when the class is called to order he 
shows his work and deposits it in a common basket, past which all the children file 
into the courtyard; and subsequently these papers are unfolded by some one of the 
personnel and, if still fit, used again the next day. It certainly must be a severe 
trial to a child to see daily that those whose judgment he esteems most highly at- 
tach no value to his work and undo it for the sake of the material which in itself 
has-no value to him. 
All these criticisms, however, fall into insignificance before the many excellent 
qualties of the work, and above all before the spirit of genuine benevolence that 
seems to rule every phase of the work, and the never-failing regard for the child’s 
humanity in every detail. Mme. Op Den Berg herself sums up the beneficial results 
of the kindergarten in the following concise fashion: 
“The parents of the children of the working class may be divided into two cate- 
gories: Those who gain their livelihood at home and those who are compelled to 
seek it away from home. : 
“For both of these the kindergarten is a great benefit; a permanent, inestimable 
blessing; it secures the moral, intellectual, and often even the physical life of their 
children. 
. “Play, motion, are natural to the young human being; he is equally in need of 
companions of his age, who think as he does, who respond to his prattle. Now, the 
child of the working class would too often be condemned to remain at rest in a nar- 
row room, deprived of air, serving as bedroom, kitchen, and workshop, Should he 
move about father and mother would scold, and the little thing would sicken, would 
suffer physically and morally. * * * 
“Under more fortunate conditions, even where the parents enjoy a certain com- 
fort, there are few mothers who are fit to conduct the first education of their chil- 
dren and to do this in the full sense of the word. 
“« Still sadder would be the picture where father and mother leave the house in the 
morning. Here the child would be turned over to the care of a mercenary neigh- 
_ bor. It would run the streets, exposed to all kinds of physical and moral dangers. 
“Such is not the fate of the children in the localities where kindergartens are 
established; here they are housed during the entire day; they are surrounded by 
thoughtful, maternal solicitude, led to the love of work, to taste for study; devel- 
oped physically, morally, and intellectually. They are happy; their countenances 
declare it. They carry to their homes a reflection of this happiness; they tell their 
parents what they did, what they learned, and these are touched and lifted by their 
recitals. 
Thus she sums up the direct results as “harmonious development of all the facul- 
ties of the human being, security of the parents during their long hours of work, 
the happiness of the children.” : 
Concerning the indirect results, she says: ‘“‘We should not lose sight of the fact 
that the child of to-day will be the man of to-morrow; consequently, to work 
at his education is to work on the amelioration of humanity. We should have to 
despair of ever succeeding in such amelioration if great results could not be expected 
from an intelligent application of Froebel’smethod. In fact, it appeals to the child’s 
individuality; it develops his special aptitudes; it stimulates the will and forms the 
judgment which is to guide it; it awakens the spirit of observation, of research; it 
develops a taste for work and arouses the inventive tendency; it teaches that happi- 
ness comes from duty well done; it trains at the same time touch, sight, hearing, 
and speech. Without doubt children thus educated must be well prepared for more 
extended instruction; must work intelligently in whatever career they may subse- 
quently choose, must struggle vigorously against ill fortune, for resignation is not 
‘always a virtue. 
“ Surely this is a powerful remedy against pauperism, that wound of society. A 
feeling of human dignity has been cultivated in the kindergarten; the child has 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 689 
  learned that ‘poverty is a vice,’ if it is not combated by continuous work; if the 
products of its efforts are not used in an orderly and economical manner. While 
very young, he has enjoyed comforts and adyantgages procured by a government 
solicitous for the welfare of the people; he knows, for this thought has been im- 
planted in his heart, that later on he must, by his own strength, conquer for himself 
this sum of comforts and advantages. He knows it, and he will do it.” 
It is very evident from this summary of beneficial results that the public kinder- 
garten in Belgium is still to a large extent an engine of public benevolence. Prob- 
ably it shares in this respect the condition of the public school as a whole in many 
of the older European civilizations. On the other hand, itis equally obvious through- 
out that the educational leaders of this little kingdom are aware, in a higher degree 
than the rest of Europe, of the true relations between the kindergarten and the 
primary school, as wellas between Froebel’s educational principles and the develop- 
ment of humanity in man. 
I can not take leave of this generous city without noticing a very remarkable 
book which had much influence on the direction of the Belgian kindergarten devel- 
opment. This work is the History of a Kindergarten (Histoire d’un Jardin @’Enfant) 
by Mlle. Octavie Masson. 
In 1861, the city of Liege entrusted the task of organizing her écoles gardiennes to 
Mile, Octavie Masson, a large-hearted lady of rare energy and intense devotion to 
her cause. She had made a special study of Froebel’s Method and succeeded in trans- 
forming the écoles gardiennes into kindergartens, establishing at the same time a 
normal course for the preparation of competent teachers. In 1863 Mlle. Masson was 
appointed general directress of the kindergartens of the city, a position which she 
filled until her death in 1875. The success of her work attracted general attention. 
The effects of the kindergarten training on the children of the poor were so obviously 
uplifting, that ladies of the wealthy classes who visited these institutions deter- 
mined to secure for their children similar benefits, and opened in 1869 the Froebel 
Institute, a kindergarten for the children of well-to-do people who were able to pay 
for each child an annual fee of 60 to 80 francs. This institute, too, was placed under 
the direction of Mlle. Masson. 
In 1872 she published her History of a Kindergarten, in which she gives a some- 
what detailed account of the growth of the work in her ideal kindergarten. Inas- 
much as this book gave direction to the kindergartens not of Liege alone, but of Bel- 
gium as a whole, it deserves more than passing notice, The book is divided into 
twenty chapters whose headings, with two exceptions, are the names of the succes- 
sive gifts and occupations, and deal almost exclusively with the information that 
may be conveyed with the help of these, describing at the same time suitable devices 
for conveying this information effectively. Only occasionally the child is permitted 
self-actively to take the initiative in an exercise, and the opportunities for using gifts 
and occupations in the expression of his own ideas are extremely rare. 
Evidently we have to do in Mlle. Masson’s kindergarten with a most charming 
school, a school taught by a woman of rare resources, of remarkable vivacity, pos- 
sessing a large fund of love of childhood, a wonderful magnetism in manner and 
speech, but nevertheless a school whose chief business is the acquisition of informa- 
tion and the proper formulation in speech of the information acquired. 
A few passages taken from the book will render this clear, In the very introdue- 
tion we read: ‘‘ The teacher asks, the pupil tries to answer; but in his answer he 
carefully reproduces completely the very phrase contained in the question. For in- 
stance, if, after naming and introducing the cube, the teacher exhibits it to his 
audience and asks: ‘ What is the object I hold in my hand? the pupil is invariably 
expected to answer: ‘Madam, the object you hold in your hand is acube.’” This 
petrified hyper-Pestalozzianism is much insisted upon throughout the book. When 
the teacher brings to the children, concealed under her apron, a box containing the 
balls of the first gift, much time and interest are spent in an effort to secure the full 
answer: ‘Madam, you have a box under your apron.” 
In other cases where this is not feasible the teacher falls into lecturing or, worse 
still, the children merely repeat sentences spoken by the teacher. 
Thus, on the occasion of a “lesson” on the soap-bubble, the children, after labor- 
iously finding out that the stem of the pipe was “long, round, and straight,” that the 
pipe itself was “hard, stiff, and brittle,” were at last permitted to look at a soap- 
bubble made by the teacher, who immediately set to work to explain away the 
charm and mystery of the spectacle in the following fashion: 
“— My dear children, the colors.of the bubble are the decomposed colors of light. 
Light is white, it is true, but very learned’men have noticed that a ray of light on 
passing through a prism shows distinctly the colors which you found on the big 
worsted ball, A prism is a triangular piece of clear glass. Here is one!” and the 
teacher showed them a glass prism, which was eagerly examined by the children. 
She resumed her conversation. She taught them that the soap-bubble was hollow, 
very thin, that the water constantly flows down along the sides of the bubble, an 
ED 91——44   
-P-A-G-E-42
690 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
that therefore these constantly diminish in thickness; that it acts like a prism, and 
that for this reason it shows successively all the colors of the light. 
“Observe it well (she says to the children), when it is about to burst; it is almost 
black. At that moment there is, so to speak, no more light.” 
To this “lecture,” I add an example of mere Pestalozzian word-teaching from a 
lesson on the third gift. Some child had made the remark to his neighbor that the 
children were in the elass room like the enbes in their box. The little neighbor 
objected, because if it were so they would not have enough air to breathe. Then 
the teacher comes in. 
“There is a space above us and around about us which seems empty; but in 
reality, dear children, this space is filled with air. This is true; it is also true that 
the air is indispensable to life. Every day, even in winter, we have to open the 
windows to let fresh air come into the room.” 
“When the little cubes are put into the box, ” said one of the little hearers, “the 
* air disappears.” 
“Yes,” said another, “ but as soon as they are taken out, the air goes back in the 
same quantity.” 
. ‘My dear little Adrian,” I said then, ‘‘ when we speak only of the space which 
a thing occupies without referring to its mass, its weight, the exact word is then 
‘volume. 
“Repeat carefully with me: When we take the cubes out of the box, the same 
yolume of air goes into the box. 
“The hollow space of a thing meant to hold another thing is called its capacity.” 
Thus the lesson continues giving definitions of the terms “solid,” “liquid,” 
and ‘‘ gaseous,” and then coneludes: 
“The solids and the gases are contrasts; the liquids are the intermediates. I have 
already explained to you what a contrast is; I told you that the sphere and cube 
are coutrasts, and that united in an intermediate they yield the cylinder.” 
The same spirit prevades the entire book. Throughout the chief concern is to 
have the child understand the things he handles, rather than to enable him to use 
-them for purposes of his own. The spirit is Pestalozzian rather than Froebelian. 
Nevertheless the book is a charming contribution to educational literature, and 
bears on every page testimony to the unselfish devotion and motherly sympathy 
that characterized the writer’s intercourse with the children. 
A similar spirit seems to prevade, to some extent, the work at Antwerp and 
Brussels, as will appear from the descriptions in Appendices A and E. The work 
is based largely on the gifts, and consists largely in giving lessons, as on the blne 
color of the ball, on the half of the cube, ete. Nevertheless there is here increasing 
freedom and a wider scope tor self-activity, and much evidence of a deeper appre- 
hension of Froebel’s meaning. Every evidence, indeed, goes to show that genuine 
child-love presides over the work, and this can not fail to lead the devoted workers 
ultimately to the goal they seek. 
  APPENDIX A, 
A DAY IN A BRUSSELS KINDERGARTEN, 
  By Mile. H. VAN Motte ANDRE. 
From 8 to 9 o’clock.—It is 8 o’clock. The kindergarten has opened its doors to the 
little ones, who assemble gradually. The kindergarten, too, does not present the 
smiling aspect of later hours, but, as the hour advances, the animation grows, and 
soon the children come in great numbers, as if they were assembling for a pleasure 
excursion. At half-past 8 o’clock the teachers are all at their posts, and the pupils, 
in groups of 10 or 12, assemble in the passageways, where they discuss the games 
they expect to play, for they know that hoops, wheelbarrows, balls, and repes will 
be at their disposal. The older ones give themselves up heartily to their plays, while 
from prudence or egoism they seat their younger friends on the benches that sur- 
round the garden. These seem contented with their lot, for as they rest from the 
long walk, they follow attentively all the intricacies of the games.. 
From 9 to 9:30.—At last the regular time for beginning the work has come. Broth- 
ers and sisters, relatives, friends, and neighbors must separate.’ Then occur those 
endearing and charming scenes which never cease to touch those who witness them 
daily. The pupilsof the higher and middle divisions step into line and, after inspec- 
tion by the teacher, who assures herself that all the recommendations with reference 
to cleanliness have been punctually followed, enter the class rooms, where the work 
with folding awaits the former, and that of tablets the latter. 
   
-P-A-G-E-43
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. : 691 
In the upper division the square papers are counted and placed at the corner of 
each of the three tables around which 36 boys and girls are seated. In the middle 
division a dozen boxes, each containing 8 square tablets (red on one side and blue 
on the other), are placed in columns at the edge of the table. The pupil at the 
corner passes them to his smaller companions, who thank him with a pieeeit e8- 
ture. The boxes are opened eagerly; the slight stir occasioned by the noise of slip- 
ping the covers under the boxes makes the little ones Jaugh heartily. ‘The teacher 
asks the children to form a square of a uniform color with four little squares. This 
square is turned with an angle in front, and the other tablets are added, two at a 
time, in such a way as to preserve always the symmetry that belongs to the occupa- 
tion. 
The outer tablets, differing in color from the inner ones, are placed successively in 
different positions around the central square. The series of designs obtained is 
reproduced on the blackboard, and when the first form has been reached again the 
work becomes free. Each one tries his best,and after ten minutes of imaginative 
effort, the hour for recreation has come. 
Let us pass to the children of the higher division. They have folded their square 
to the double fundamental form, from which a great number of life-forms are de- 
rived. They are already familiar with quite a number of these; for on the shelves 
of the class room entire series are displayed, but to-day they are to learn a new form. 
The teacher shows it to them made from a much larger paper. It is the gondola. 
The interest of the children increases; all try their skill. -At last the most skillful 
one has obtained the new form. The frail vessel floats gracefully on the water con- 
tained in a trough placed on the teacher’s table for this purpose. Other gondolas 
follow, and soon half the class have succeeded. The last pupils seem discouraged; 
but even at this age they already have the habit of kindergarten life, and the more 
successful ones aid their little companions with much alacrity. 
All are busy at their work, nothing seems to distract them, not even the laughter 
and songs of the little ones in the next room; for when the older ones, as if to give 
the example tothe younger ones, went to their work, the younger ones were playing 
a game under the direction of their teacher. The children were arranged in a cir- 
ele in which a little girl imitated the leap of a small rabbit following the rhythm of 
the song which accompanied the game. 
From 9:50 to 10 o’clock—Our little workers quit their places in order to yield them 
to the little children of the lower sections, and very soon we see in the two class 
rooms 36 children, 3 to 4 years old, installed at their work tables. A box containing 
8 small cubes is given each one of them. They open it together, in an orderly man- 
ner, in sucha way as to bring out the entire cube. They seem familiar with it, for 
they decompose it perfectly, and after constructing a form dictated by the teacher, 
each child makes another at pleasure. Here it is a bridge, under which the neigh- 
bor glides with his train of cars made with his cubes; here, we see a number of the 
usual forms—the mother’s chair, the kitchen table, the doll’s bed, the bench for the 
tired travelers. Each form gives rise tosome conversation between the children 
and the teacher who inspects them all. 
While these little children are busy with the material of the third gift, those of the 
advanced class, with a charming swagger, defile in military fashion, for it is the hour 
for gymnastics. They arrange themselves in rows and carry out with all the exact- 
ness of which such children are capable the various gymnastic movements required 
ofthem. In another class room the teacher has selected exercises to train the hear- 
ing and touch of her children by engaging them in the play of the blind man. 
From 10 to 10:30.—At 10 o’clock the little children leaye the benches, which are 
immediately occupied by the pupils of the higher and intermediate divisions. To ~ 
the latter slates and slate pencils are distributed. While waiting for the teacher’s 
instructions, one little fellow tries to draw the tumbler which he sees on the table, 
another designs some simple pattern on the network of his slate. But a little girl 
brings in a number of ivy leaves from the garden; each one of the pupilsis given one 
of these, holds it with the left hand on the slate in order to obtain the outline of it 
by passing the pencil around it. Some of them have succeeded perfectly and add 
the veins in order to complete the drawing. At the same time there is perfect 
silence, all the little faces are attentively turned toward the teacher, who talks to 
her pupils about the walk they took the day before. They had followed a portion 
of the boulevards on the outskirts of the city and had noticed the trees. An engray- 
ing on the wall representing a magnificent tree suggests to, a little girl the very cor- 
rect remark that the trees on the boulevard did not present the same aspect as the 
tree on the engraving. The teacher then talks to them about buds and the leaves 
that come from them. She transforms a leafless tree she had drawn on the black- 
board into a tree whose branches are covered with leaves. 
While our little friends have thus been occupied with drawing in one room, and 
in another wholly absorbed in the conversation, the children of the lower sections, 
arranged in two large concentric circles, have played and sung the “‘ Imitation” 
game,  
-P-A-G-E-44
  692 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
From 10:30 to 11.—A short and rapid march brings the little ones back to the class 
room, where each one is given a weaving mat of stiff American linen (?) and a num- 
ber of Bristol board strips. All follow the first weaving dictation (one up, one down) ; 
the more advanced bring with the design a variation due to the difference in the width 
of the strips; they follow in their work a similar formula (one wide, one narrow). 
Their little chubby hands already manage the material skillfully, and they arrange 
little races among themselves as to who should first finish filling the weaving-net. 
In the adjoining playrooms the pupils of the intermediate class have their gym- 
nastic exercises, in another the teacher of the higher division has them play the 
“tree” game, which appropriately follows the talk that had just elicited so much 
interest from them. 
From 11 to 11:30.—For the last time the older pupils take the places oceupied by 
the little ones. For the intermediate division each one has been given a box of 
beads of different colors. In order to train them to patience and at the same time 
familiarize them with the colors, the teacher has them select red and blue beads. 
During this time wires for stringing the beads are distributed, and the children fol- 
lowing carefully the teacher’s dictation produce a pretty lace pattern. They work 
very earnestly at this; for, anticipating the punishment, they avoid the overturn- 
ing of their boxes. : 
‘The pupils of the higher division are engaged in interlacing slats. Each child 
has received 8, with which he has formed the octagonal star. This the teacherdraws 
on the blackboard in order to accustom the children to draw from nature. Then 
the interlaced star is modified, each child following his own suggestions, and atleast 
three-fourths of the pupils produce good designs. 
The time for closing has come. The material used in the last lessons is put up in 
the closets by the most skillful little girls. The little ones who, during the last 
period, were engaged in free play are all dressed and waiting in the playroom, where 
the older ones come to find them and to take them home. 
From 11:80 to 12.—At the door of the school the impatient mothers await the de- 
parture of the children, who do not leave their teachers without some affectionate 
sign of gratitude. About ascore of little ones have remained in the vestibule. 
They are those whom fortune has not favored. They can not, like the others, re- 
turn home at noon, for both father and mother, in order to supply the necessities of 
the household, are out at work for the entire day. A neighbor, a brother, an older 
sister, have given them their breakfast, too often only a piece of bread. They re- 
turn to one of the class rooms which the woman of general service has transformed 
into a dining room. The tables are covered with long, smooth tablecloths, and set 
with plates and spoons. The little guests take their seats; a delicious soup is 
served by two of the teachers who will share their meal with them. Towards noon 
the greater half of these pupils leave the school; the others continue at theirluncheon 
under the supervision of one of the teachers who, subsequently, permits them to 
play freely. 
At 1 o’clock the doors are reopened. The teachers and pupils return, the latter 
awaiting their schoolmates in the garden. 
From 1:80 to 2 o’clock.—At half-past one the older pupils enter their class room 
and the younger ones the playroom. In the intermediate division second-gift boxes 
have been distributed, and, after some exercises that show the relation of the ele- 
ments of the gift, the teacher passes to the play part of the lesson. A column is 
constructed with the cube, cylinder, and ballin the middle of the table. A pupil 
tries to overthrow the structure with his ball. He fails repeatedly, but another who 
has a more practiced eye succeeds at the first trial. Repeated applause is heard, for 
all are interested in the game which is continued until the hour for leaving the class 
room. 
The higher divisions in the meanwhile are busy with cardboard work.: Each 
child has a small envelope containing its work. One draws on the. square-ruled 
cardboard the development of the cube he is going to cut out. Another constructs 
a cube whose six faces are embroidered with a design of his own. A third finishes 
an oblong box which he wishes to present to his mother on her birthday. These 
good intentions wonderfully stimulate the pupils; they take up their work each time 
with renewed zeal until the little ones claim their seatsin the classroom. The little 
ones themselves come from the playroom, where they have played the game of the 
“little fishes.” 
From 2 to 2:30.—The younger children are seated around the tables on which they 
let the balls of the first gift dance. The movement, slow at first, becomes more and 
more accelerated, and soon explosions of laughter are heard. The teacher then passes 
to the formation of the first numbers, which is accomplished by -combining the 
colors. 
On the playground the cries of joy show that it is recess for the middle division. 
One can not hear his own voice; each one wants torule. At last one of the little 
despots carries his point: ‘‘Let us play horse.” The partisans of his view engage
-P-A-G-E-45
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 693 
in the game merrily, while the others in various groups amuse themselves at pleasure. 
Some little girls play mamma; some boys imitate soldiers; and here is a group 
playing school, conducted by a very severe little teacher. 
The pupils of the higher class are also occupied in playing, but they are engheet 
in the game suggested by their teacher in her class journal, and get out of it-as 
much amusement as the intermediate section do from theirs. It is the game of ‘cat 
and mouse.” 
From 2:30 to 3 o’clock.—At half past 2 o’clock recreation ceases and work begins 
afresh. As ifshe wished to furnish a contrast to the noisy games of the intermedi- 
ate division, the teacher gives them an occupation that rivets their whole attention ; 
i.e., perforation. Each one has his piece of felt, his perforating card, and pricking 
needle. 2 
The higher division are busy with sticks. Each one with 13 sticks has made a ~ 
little element for a design, and these carried out on the four sides produce elegant 
designs, developing esthetic designs. These symmetrical forms are modified by a. 
variety of changes made by the pupils. 
At the same time the little ones in the playroom imitate the trotting and gallop- 
ping of horses, singing the appropriate song. 
Brom 8 to 3:30.—For the last time, at 3 o’clock, these little ones return to the class 
room in order to interlace paper bands. Each one has two bands of different colors 
with which he makes the “ cat-steps.” During all this time they talk together; and 
one even accompanies the song which the pupils of the intermediate class are sing- 
ing in the adjoining playroom, where they are playing the game of “the child who 
seeks a place in the circle.” 
The oldest division have their free recess. One group are engaged in hunting for 
a ball which the teacher has concealed on the playground. The others are playing 
«< prisoner.” 
From 3:30 to 4 o’clock.—After recess the pupils by twos march into the class room. 
In the intermediate division, at each table, a child distributes among the children a 
certain quantity of moist sand. At the same time they are given a tin mold which 
they fill with the sand in order to recast its shape. These children, opposite one 
another, exchange molds, and, ultimately, the two arrange their forms in a square 
or in a circle. 
In the higher division the pupils are engaged in ring-laying. They have made a 
. design composed of five rings, one large one and four small ones in this one.’ The 
large one is surrounded by four large half rings and_ eight medium-sized half rings. 
By suitable modifications three new designs are made, and then they work freely. 
The little children of the lowest division have been dressed in the meantime and 
the time for closing has come. The boxes with rings are put back in the case and 
the pupils leave the class rooms to get ready for their departure. 
At 4 o’clock the doors of the kindergarten are opened for the dismissal of the 150 
little ones who passed the day so pleasantly within its walls. 
APPENDIX B. 
EXCURSION OF A BRUSSELS KINDERGARTEN TO THE BOIS DE LA CAMBRE, 
For three days great excitement has animated the kindergarten. The pupils are 
full of joy; their countenances beam. The teacher has promised them, as.a reward 
of their obedience, to take them on an excursion. For three days they have besieged 
the teacher with questions to which she opposes a silence that only increases their 
curiosity. = 
At last the eve of the great day is at hand. While they are working in silence, 
the teacher attracts their attention to her own work. She is preparing paper 
squares which, contrary to usage, will not be used ina folding lesson, but for notices 
to be taken by the children to their mothers. Pressed with questions she reads the 
contents of the note to the children, and they learn to their intense joy that an ex- 
cursion to the woods is fixed for the following day. 
On leaving school each child carries off its note and promises to rise early in order 
to be among the first. On the next day they are punctual, dressed in their best 
attire, and provided with their dinners. While waiting for their departure, they are 
continually examining the little baskets and studying their contents. Ata quarter 
of 9 they are assembled and arrange themselves in file by threes and direct their 
steps toward the gate of Schaerbeek where they are to take the tramway for the 
woods. What pleasure to mount the trams, especially for those among them who
-P-A-G-E-46
  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
have never been upon them; they take their places but no one wants to keep his 
seat, all want to see the things along the line. 
Soon they notice the column of the Congress, the lions that surround it, and they 
want to know the name of the person on the column. Some notice the statue of Gen. 
Belliard, then that of Godfrey of Bouillon, whom they call a great cavalier. Sub- 
sequently their way leads them aleng the boulevard and the avenue of the woods, 
To their great surprise the conveyance stops; they have to get out and are at the 
same time sorry and pleased. 
It is 10 o’clock; they have reached the woods; what shall they do? The teacher 
is getting ready to direct their attention to the characteristic things. The great 
number of trees strikes them at once; then the great size of the trees. They recog- 
nize those which adorn the playground of the kindergarten, and those which they 
have seen in the park. They name the chestnut tree, the plane tree, the acacia, etc. ; 
and for a time their conversations deal only with the trees and their fruits so far as 
their knowledge extends. To this the teacher adds new information; she directs 
their attention to the beech tree which yields the beechnut of which they are so 
fond, the filbert tree which ee the filberts, and the poplar, remarkable for its 
height, etc.; she induces the little society to gather some leaves from these trees in 
order to put them in their herbarium. 
Subsequently they repair to the lawns dotted with flowers. They wish to gather 
some of these, and among the gathered flowers several are new to them. They hasten 
to show them to their teacher and to ask for their names. At her advice, they put 
them with the leaves that are to be carried home. 
The permission to play freely is granted them. What game will they choose? 
“Let us play wolf,” says Arthur, ‘for we are in the woods.” ‘No, no,” says Marie, 
“we might call him, and I am very much afraid.” At these words all begin to 
laugh, for they know very well that the teacher wonld not take them to a danger- 
ous place. They begin their game. A second and a third game follow; then the 
teacher calls them to dinner. All are content, for they are very hungry. They go 
to the nearest dairy, hasten to open their baskets, and eat with an enviable.appe- 
tite. After the repast, which lasts only a few minutes, they take a walk to aid di- 
gestion. Then the teacher plays a number of games with them; shows them the 
fish which they like to imitate, entertains them in the ravine, then again grants 
them free play, when they seize the ropes, the balls, the hoops brought from the 
school, and amuse themselves royally. 
At last the hour for returning has come. The hats are gathered up and the dif- 
ferent objects laid on the grass are picked up; the children, arranged in the same 
order in which they arrived in the morning, march to the entrance of the forest. 
Here they enter again the trams which are to take them home. They are no longer 
as inquisitive as they were in the-morning; fatigue has overcome them; all are 
seated, and a number have gone to sleep. From the terminus of the tram they 
march to the kindergarten, where anxious parents await their return. 
The next morning they have a thousand things to say to their schoolmates, and 
- the teacher avails herself of their eagerness to extend their knowledge, making 
comparisons, rendering them more familiar with the great persons they met, and 
directing their attention to the provisions for the herbarium. Thus she gathers all 
possible good results from this excellent excursion,

A STORY TOLD IN A BRUSSELS KINDERGARTEN, 
Tony. 
On the banks of the Senne, a short distance beyond Lacken, there lived a family 
of peasants whose work consisted chiefly in raising vegetables for the market of 
Brussels. The husband was named Peter and his wife,Mary. They had three chil- 
dren, Paul, John, and little Louise. (Here I trace on the blackboard the house 
and add successively the things of which Ispeak.) Their house was on the banks 
of the river. In front there was a tolerably largelawn. The vegetable garden was 
behind the house. Around the garden there was a fence which Peter had built from 
small branches of shrubbery. 
The peasant had a large dog whose name was Tony. He had also many chickens. 
Tony was a splendid dog who had already done great service tothe family. At night 
he guarded the house. In the morning he left early hitched to a small wagon full
-P-A-G-E-47

  of vegetables on his way to the market with Mary. On his return he walked about 
and, when the children of the neighborhood came to play with Paul and John, Ton 
was of the party; the children mounted on his back, or they made him go tough 
with his drill, having him to sit up holding a stick in his paws. Little Louise loved 
him much, but the poor child was always sick and tormented everybody, especially 
the dog, who, however, bore her no ill will. 
At one time, in summer, a rain storm kept Peter from going to market, It rained 
for four days. Finally, on going to the window, the peasant saw that it had almost 
stopped raining, but the water of the river had risen to the edge of the bank. The 
field and vegetables were covered with water. Peter, however, left with the dog, 
put they had hard work to return, for the roads were covered with mud and the rain 
had again set in. Peter changed his clothes, and Tony lay down before the fire. 
Mary had prepared a good soup, but her husband ate very little, for he was sad. 
Therain kept on; the sky was covered with gray clouds, the wind shook the win- 
dows, and in the country the wheat was laid low by the weight of water. Peter was 
in despair. He thotght if this continued until the next morning the river would be 
in the garden and their home inundated. 
In the afternoon a neighbor, whose house was lower down, came to say to Peter 
that the water had entered his dwelling, that he had been compelled to take refuge 
with his family in the barn. He had brought his youngest child with him, and 
asked Mary to keep it until the next day. The afternoon was passed in preparing 
for the worst. Peter took into the hayloft the linen, provisions, etc. 
The rain kepton. ‘‘Al] will go well,” said Peter to his wife, ‘‘if the dike (I explain 
the word) a short distance from here is not broken by the flood; but if it should 
break, it would be terrible. I shall see if I can help our neighbor and shall return 
very soon.” 
oS hour later he came back as he had promised. ‘‘Allis well,” he said to his wife; 
“the dike holds out well and our house is well built.”. Tony was in his corner, 
his large nose between his paws. He watched the rain; he was not afraid of water, 
for he could swim like a fish. 
The peasants retired to sleep. The children were in the bedroom side by side. 
Paul and John slept together, and Louise shared her bed with the neighbor's little 
girl, In the night Mary and her husband were suddenly aroused by Tony’s howls. 
Peter sprang from the bed and cried out: ‘‘ We are already in the water; the dike 
is broken. ‘Take the children quickly to the loft.” Tony howled at the door, and 
tried in vain to open it with his heavy paws. Mary took Paul in her arms and car- 
ried him up. Peter took John and opened the door for his dog. The water in the 
house had risen up to the knees. 
“Stay in your bed,” exclaimed Peter to the other two children. ‘Ishall be back 
directly; do not be afraid.” But while he ascended quickly to the loft, Louise 
sprang out of the bed and was carried away by a current of the rising water. 
When Peter came down he heard the neighbor's little girl cry out the name of Louise 
and point to the door. He did not lose his head, but called his dogand showed him 
something white which floated out toward the river, saying: ‘Tony, quick; fetch 
Louise. 
The good dog swam after her, sought her by the end of her gown, and soon 
brought her back to Peter, who carried her to the loft. The mother took charge of 
her, but Louise had to stay in bed for six weeks. 
For several days the water covered the country around. Most of the people that 
lived on the banks of the river were ruined, but Peter and Mary were still quite 
happy to have their little Louise; and Mary often said to Tony, patting him: “Good 
Tony, you haye saved our little Louise.”

THREE DAYS IN A KINDERGARTEN OF ANTWERP. 
‘The kindergarten is free, has an attendance of 300 children in 6 classes, with 6 teachers, 3 assistants, 
and 2 servants.] 
The children begin to arrive at the school at 8 o’clock. They play freely until 9 
o’clock, either on the playground or in one of the play rooms. In summer the chil- 
dren of the two older classes are busy with the gardens, whose care is incumbent on 
them. 
After each exercise, which lasts on an average 30 minutes, the children go to the 
playground. Indeed, they remain here if the weather is favorable and the character 
of the occupations permits it. Every class-room exercise is followed by games and 
songs in the play room.
-P-A-G-E-49
    There are 6 classes, in reality 3 classes (each in two divisio! 
The noon lunch is taken at half past 11. PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS,

1 half past 1, the chil- 
dren play freely without the intervention of teachers, as before 9 o’clock. 
At 4 o’clock the children leave school. Those who can not go home alone wait, 
under the care of a teacher, until they are called for or are taken home.

      -| To distinguish the blue color.—The teacher 
shows tho blue ball. All the children look for the blue ball in the box, take it out, and show it. Various exercises with the blue ball: Putting it back into the box, taking it out again, passing it from the left to the right hand, rolling it on the table.in differ- ent directions, etc. Show various blue ob- jects, look for'such in the class room. Mix ‘the balls; take out the yellow ball, the red ball, the blue ball. : Play with the balls.The children, at a signal given by the teacher, alternately throw each of the known balls into a large basket, until they make no more blunders; ¢,9., (1) yellow balls, (2) red balls, (3) blue balls. The chair.—Talk about the chair. Its uses. Some children sit down in it. The chair is made with sticks, the work of the teacher serving as a model to the children. The children try to place it in different direc- tions, as below: 
The teacher draws the chair on the black- board. ‘How should we sit down on a chair?” If time permits, the chitdren lay several other figures previously laid. If'a child invents a new figure, he’ makes it at the teacher's desk, and the other children imitate it, cach in his place. 
      
   
The teacher sings avery simple children’s song. The children aré pleased with itand express a desire to learn it. ‘They, at first, hum the tune of it, accompanyi teacher. ‘They then learn the words, which are well pronounced and well explained, and finally sing the words. Finding the half of the cube: Divide the cube 
into two half cubes, in imitation of the teacher; the children separate and reunite the half cubes or change their places re- peatedly. With the help of the teacher they 
try to find other ways of dividing the cube. Then they divide without any help. Di vide a paper strip, a bun, a fruit into two equal parts. When we receive an apple, a cake, we give half of it to someone else, to the brother, the chum. The children march in file. All the move- ments of the leader are imitated by the rest. ‘The children form a circle; each in its turn passes around on the inside of the circle, walking, running, or leaping in some fash: ion. 
     
    Generally the children have in their hands the objects with which the lesson deals. This is particularly the caso with the gifts and occupa- tions. In the lowest class we deal only with the three colors, red, yellow, and blue. 
The bail is used in all classes 
in games which grow in complexity. 
The teacher takes every op- portunity to strengthen good téndencies and to weaken bad’ ones, to accus- 
tom thém to proper con- duct, etc. 
All gifts are used as much as 
possible for three distinet ends: (1) Torepresent com- mon objects; (2) To con- struct artistic forms; (3) 
To represent geometrical forms, and for arithmetical 
exercises.

folding sheet of any color. Observe its sides and angles. Place the lower edge on the upper and crease in the middle., Notice 
the oblong. Open the paper and fold simi- larly from right to left, etc., etc. The song of the ship.—The song is accompa- nied with imitations of the movements of 
ships and Sailors. In the work room ti.ere is a large vessel with mast, sails, cordage, rudder. In the ship there is room for three 
or four children who can do work there, 
such as casting out the anchor, hoist and take in the sails, work the radder, ete. Two interlaced triangles.—Forming different 
angles with two slats. Construct different 
triangles with threeslats. Make two equi- 
lateral triangles; place one on the other; interlace them; count and compare the new small triangles. 
Purpose: To arouse inthe children a desire to work in the garden and to prepare them for next year's duties. Talk about all they see, the beds, the trees, the flowers, etc., 
about the work in which the children of the third year are at that time engaged in their little “gardens. The children freely ask ious of the teacher. They begin to in the part of the garden reserved for them; they spade, rake, make clods, ditches, wells, etc. They also learn to handle some garden tools. Finally, by way of recom- pense, the children receive the ripe fruit and eat them. 
  Drawinga star withtriangulartablets. Some observations about the tablets, Their name, comparison with the square tablet sides and angles. Have them draw the angles on the black board. Make a square oftwotablets. Unite four of these in alarger square, etc. (until the fol- lowing’ star is reached), Thistigureis drawn on tho slate. ‘The children uso a tablet to find the chief 
points which they join afterwards with straight lines in free hand drawing, Children that have suc: ceeded well in their task, make azother figure of their own invention and copy itafterwards on their slates. The prisoners.—Three children, three pris- oncrs, are shut in the circle formed by the remaining children, hand in hand. If they succeed in their efforts to escape, those who permitted them to escape take their places. ‘Throwing a ball as near as possible a given mark. 
‘Throwing balls towards an object from a line drawn on the floor at increasing distances from the goal.     Such a lesson always begins with a talk on the object in question. Different kinds of ships should be shown the children. Familiar com- ments; moral stories are 
always in place. Afierthe exercise which appeals to the senses and the intellect * comes the little story that appeals to the heart. 
   
  The children of the two 
erclasses havegardensofone or two square meters in 
which they sowand plant at pleasure. Each one has a spade, arake, and a water- ing pot. The plantsare ob- served in their daily growth. The harvest is gathered - every year. The common parts of the garden are cared for by the teachers, thechil- dren observing their work.* Therearemany cherry trees, apple trees, gooseberry bushes, raspberry bushes, strawberry plants, fruits of which aré distributed among the children. 
Drawing beginsat the closeof thefirstyear. Throughout we follow the method indi- 
cated by Froebel, grouping 
similar elements, joining by intermediate forms dis- 
similarelements, goingfrom center to circumference, from left te right, top to bot- tom, etc. The children are thus prepared to find other tigures easily. Slate draw- ing goes hand in hand as soon as possible with pencil 
drawing on paper.

  ‘The teacher tells with interesting details and much. fecling a moral, instructive, and probable story, and draws, the, principal scene on the blackboard before the eyes of the children. Subject—The ground is covered with snow. ‘A child feeds the sparrows who suffer from the cold and hunger. Drawing on the board.—The home of the child; two trees; snow everywhere; achild that scatters bread crumbs; sparrows flying all about. Some questions are put; the differ- ent parts of the design are shown; the whole story is told, without interruption, by sev- 
eral children. If time is left, tho children are allowed to draw the easier parts of the design, and they are induced to tell other stories previously told. Repetition of thres familiar songs with piano accompaniment: Tho Blacksmith, The Gardener, House-Building. The tools of the blacksmith, of the gardener, the things needed for the construction of the house are in thechildren’s hands. ‘The words in- dicate the work and the motions. Plaiting a festoon with six strips. (Fall directions of the form are given, but are here omitted.) 
  A number of exercises of special parts of 
the body, and marches with piano accom- 
paniment. It should furnish occasion to move every 
part of the body. It comprises marches and countermarches in the shape of the square, the cross, the circle, spiral, the wavyline, * * * gymnasticmovements of all sorts with the ropes, hoops, wands, and other light apparatus. A graceful, firm gait, and the greatest exactness are re- quired. The whole should produce an 
agreeable impression. Modeling an apple in clay. This exercise is preceded by an object-lesson on the apple. A model apple in clay is examined and serves as sample. 
The children first make a ball; this is flat- 
tened and worked until the desired form is 
obtained; the lesson closes with inventive 
exercises. 
“Two are enough and three are too many; 
* then one or two chosen by the children.   Stories begin to be told with 
the beginning of the second year. Preference is given to family scenes, to events 
of child life. 
The piano is in the play-room of the higher class; it is at the disposal of the teachers of the lower classes once a week. 
The paper work (plaiting, weaving, and folding) 38 begun at the close of the 
first or beginning of the second year. 
This prepares for the gy nastic exercises of the pri- mary school. 
  The children use chiefly their 
fingers in phaping the ap- 
ple; only for final touches 
they usé the modeling tool. When the real objects are not too complicated, they serve as models. 
  
Inall exercises the children are granted all the freedom compatible with the order and 
discipline that should reignin aschool. They may talk with one another, speak to the 
teacher without asking permission whenever the nature of the occupation allows this.

  II.—SWitzERLAND. 
Astrange country is little Switzerland, harboring a motley people that—marvelous 
in Europe—rests its nationality not on language or common origin, but wholly 
and alone, spurning all external considerations, on the love of liberty. Switzerland 
boasts not of great military leaders, nor of great names in polite literature, and other 
achievements in the realms of selfgratification; but the vast love-burdened tide of 
educational development which promises to dispense the blessings of peace and 
good willto all mankind, has its sources in the freedom-loving Alps. Rousseau, 
Pere Girard, and Madame Necker de Saussure, Planta and 4 Porta; Francesco Soave 
and Alberto Lamoni; Pestalozzi, Fellenberg, and Wehrli, represent educational 
Rhones and Adiges, Pos and Rhines, carrying life-dispensing floods in the four direc- 
tions of the compass to the plains below. . 
Even Froebel, the father of the kindergarten, owes the discovery of his true call- 
ing and the unfolding of his mighty genius to the influence of this little republic. 
In 1805 Froebel had reached Frankfort with the intention of sécking occupation as 
architect. Here he was introduced to Gruner, a young enthusiast who had estab- 
lished in the city a model school conducted in the spirit of Pestalozzi. Repeated 
intercourse revealed to Gruner Froebel’s inmost soul, and in friendly advice he ex- 
claimed: ‘“ Architecture is not your calling. You must become a teacher. I needa 
teacher (of mathematics) in my school; the position is yours, if you will accept it;” 
and Froebel accepted. 
Then followed his first visit to Pestalozzi at Yoerdun, during the vacation in the 
fall of 1805, and three years later his second visit as tutor of three boys intrusted 
to his care. Still later, in 1831, when ruin was rife and threatened his work in 
Germany, he found an asylum again in Switzerland, where he established consecu- 
tively the model schools at Wartensee and Willisau, and, in 1831, accepted the di- 
rection of the orphan asylum at Burgdorf, which he retained until 1836. 
It would be an interesting task to trace the subtle influences through which the 
work of the Swiss reformer culminated in the genial ‘Come, let us live with our 
children,” of his Thuringian disciple. Butin a sketch of the kindergarten develop- 
ment among the Swiss, such an analysis would not bein place. Indeed, the kinder- 
garten idea was a somewhat later fruitage of Froebel’s mind. Yet his first clear 
utterances concerning the kindergarten (183740) followed so closely upon his stay 
in Switzerland that one wonders how the little republic could be among the last

PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 701 
European countries to establish the kindergarten. It isreported thatkindergartens 
existed for short periods in different cities as early as 1845, and among these one 
founded by Carl Froebel in Ziirich, but that they failed because of the incompetence 
of the teachers. 
Thus it happens that here, too, the first successful establishment of kindergartens 
is linked with the name of the Baroness Marenholtz-Buelow. In 1856 she labored in 
Ziirich, without, however, achieving direct practical results. In the meanwhile 
Frédéric Soret, a well-known writer, had prepared, on the basis of lectures deliv- 
ered by the baroness at Frankfort in 1854, an elaborate report on kindergartens 
for the Société de Uutilité publique of Geneva. This report was read before the 
society in January, 1858. In 1859 Prof. Raoux, of Lausanne, entered into corre- 
spondence with the baroness and established a kindergarten in his own home. In 
1860 the baroness came to French Switzerland and aroused a deep and abiding in- 
terest through her lectures, which resulted in much permanent good and led to the 
establishment of public kindergartens in a number of cantons, more particularly in 
Geneva, of which a detailed account will follow. 
In a number of places there existed infant schools whose establishment was due 
to the influence of Oberlin’s efforts in the Alsace. These were quite numerous in 
French-speaking Switzerland and in Basle. In these, too, attempts began to be 
made about this time to introduce the use of Froebel’s occupations and games, more 
particularly sewing, weaving, and pricking. 
In all directions the work grew, until in 1881 the first general statistical report 
showed that Switzerland maintained 404 infant schools. Of these 75 were pure kin- 
dergartens, 138 were partial kindergartens, and the remainder had not been touched 
appreciably by the spirit or work of Froebel.. In these infant schools 550 teachers 
taught about 15,000 children. 
In many cantons the state or the respective communities contributed largely to the 
support of these infant schools, and in Geneva 58 kindergartens and infant schools 
were maintained wholly from the public funds. 
The last available general report is for the years 1887~88. The number of infant 
schools had risen to 544, that of the teachers to 611, that of the children to 20,745, 
and in all the cantons except five the state exercised some degree of supervision and 
control over these schools. It is a notable fact, however, that the kindergartens in 
these five cantons enjoyed a high degree of efficiency and sustained a high educa- 
tional character. This was notably the case with the canton of St. Gall, which gave - 
the first impetus to the establishment of training schools for teachers and to the 
organization of the Swiss kindergarten association. 
Tn 1865 an infant school was established in the orphanage under the direction of . 
the venerable Wellauer. The results of this work of the teachers, in spite of their 
zeal, were quite unsatisfactory, and in 1866 two talented young ladies were sent to 
a training school for kindergartens in Germany in order to prepare themselves for 
the work of teaching the little orphans. The success of their work on their return 
was so marked that the teachers of St. Gall requested Wellauer to prepare a report 
on the subject of Froebel’s educational system for a conference held in 1869. 
The influence of this report was immediate. Steps were at once taken to organize 
a kindergarten association, and in 1870 the first public kindergarten was established 
with-as many children as the building could accommodate. So great was the 
demand for admission that in 1872 a large building was erected, at a cost of about 
$12,000, for the accommodation of about 100 children. The building is provided 
with the necessary occupation rooms and play rooms, and admirably lighted, heated, 
and ventilated. A large playground, ore aly arranged for running and leaping 
games and bordered by flower beds, is laid out on the south side of the building. 
On the east side a large open space has been provided, filled with vast heaps of sand 
for the use of the little gardeners, builders, and engineers; and on the opposite side 
of the street there is a beautiful small flower garden, planted and cared for by the 
children. 
Inasmuch as the work of the good people of St. Gall became the type of effective 
work done in the greater portion of Switzerland, and inasmuch as it would afford 
an excellent type for needed work in many of our American communities, the chief 
points of organization are noted here. 
The association aims “to advance the interests of national modes of educating 
infants by establishing and conducting in the city of St.Gall kindergartens in 
accordance with Froebel’s principles.” The financial means are provided from 
annual contributions, school fees, eventual presents, and legacies. All are full 
members who pay the annual contribution. The association meets at least once a 
year, decides finally concerning the establishment of kindergartens, elects for a 
triennial period of service an executive committee of seven members and an auditing 
committee of three members, and decides all questions of policy and administration. 
The executive committee elects its own secretary and treasurer from its members, 
appoints a supervising committee of four ladies, and carries out the plans and reso-

Iutions of the association, and makes an annual report to the association. For each 
kindergarten at least one professionally trained teacher is employed; as soon as the 
number of children execeds 30 an assistant must be engaged. Children are admitted 
between the ages of 3 and 6, 
The teachers are engaged for a period of six years. The planof work isdrawn up 
by the college of kindérgartners and approved by the executive commission. . The 
execution of this plan is intrusted to a supervisor selected from the college of kinder- 
artners fora period of six years. Thissupervisor presides also over themonthly con- 
Pecauces of kindergartners and reports annually the results of this work to the asso- 
ciation. Each kindergartner is aided by a janitor, who keeps the rooms in order and 
receives and dismisses the children, seeing to it that their wraps are properly cared 
for. The children pay amonthly fee of from 1 to 5 francs according to circumstances, 
or may be admitted for still less at the option of the execative committee. The ses- 
sions are from 9 to 11:30 in the forenoon, and from 2 to 4 in the afternoon, except on 
Wednesday and Saturday, which are holidays. The half hour from 10 to 10:30 is de- 
voted to a luncheon and to play. Children, however, are permitted te bring for 
luncheon only bread and fruit, a most wholesome limitation. Eight weeks of vaca- 
tion are distributed as follows: Two weeks in April; three in August; two in Octo- 
ber; one at Christmas. The close of the winter term in April is celebrated with a 
play festival, to which parents and friends are invited. 
Atraining school for kindergartners is connected with the institution. Thisschool 
is conducted by the supervisor. The course lasts for one year. Students must have 
passed the seventeenth year, must also show a good scholastic education, and be able 
to sing. They have four lessons weekly on kindergarten theory and practice; two 
lessons weekly in general pedagogies and hygiene; two lessons weekly in natural his- 
tory and botany; two lessons weekly in geometry and geometrical drawing; one les- 
son weekly in calisthenics, and two lessons weekly in singing. 
St. Gall also has the honor of having originated the idea of the Swiss kindergarten 
association, which did so much to lift the kindergartens of German Switzerland upon 
an almost ideal level of efficiency. In 1881 J. Wellauer and his enthusiastic friend, 
Charles Ed. Mayer, a gifted minister of the Gospel, issued a call to the friends of 
Froebelian education in Switzerland to assemble at St. Gall. The meeting was 
largely attended. Among other things it was resolved to establish a Swiss kinder- 
garten association, whose purpose it should be to labor in the interest of rational 
infant edueation, to diffuse a better knowledge of the principles and means of such 
an education, and to induce the communities to make the establishment and conduct 
of kindergartens an affair of public instruction. In less than two years the provi- 
sional organization numbered 662 members. At the same time the provisional com- 
mittee, with rare energy, published, under the editorial management of Director 
Knettel, of Lucerne, a monthly periodical devoted to theinterests of its cause. This 
excellent paper, which was published for seven years, did much to give to the Swiss 
kindergartens the character of pure, unaffected child-joy, of simple religious inten- 
sity, of affectionate social unity, of cheerful earnestness, and a sensible regard for the 
practical needs of life, which brings them nearer to Froebel’s ideal than the kinder- 
gartens of other neighboring lands. 
The second meeting of the association took place im Zurich in 1884, and completed 
the organization. The only notablé change in the provisional constitution was 
in the paragraph which had proposed as one of the aims of the association ‘efforts 
to render the introduction, maintenance, and conduct of kindergartens a part of 
public education.” It was maintained that neither cantonal nor federal red-tape 
could properly conduct the kindergarten cause; that the establishment. of kinder- 
gartens by the state implied the step of rendering them compulsory, which would 
interfere with the rights of the family, and that such a step would complicate still 
more the already complicated problem of public education. On the other hand, it 
was conceded that the state might do much to aid the movement by interesting itself 
in the professional education of kindergartners. A compromise in this sense was 
effected, declaring it to be the aim of the association “to establish kindergartens, to 
secure the professional education of kindergartners as far as practicable, and to enlist 
the factors of public administration in efforts to aid the kindergarten movement.” 
To this day the association has continued to flourish. Its membershipin 1886 had 
reached 1,319, and at its last meeting, in Winterthur, in 18980, exceeded 2,000. The 
most cultivated men and women vie with each other in efforts to advance its labors, 
and in every direction there is growth. 
Among the papers read at the last meeting of the association, one of the most 
notable was that of Dr. Hiirlimann, a practical physician and intelligent student of 
the kindergarten. He maintained that a well-conductéd kindergarten, provided 
with all needful apparatus and suitable play grounds, is a fountain of all good things 
for body and mind; that, on the other hand, the so-called infant schools, devoid of 
Froebel’s spirit, are a constant source of injury, burdening the children precociously 
   
-P-A-G-E-55
PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 703 
and hindering physical development. He praised Froebel for his reverence for child- 
nature, and honored him as a pioneer mind in all that relates to educational hygiene. 
More particularly is this illustrated in the stress which Froebel places on social 
games and-occupations. Through these, more than by any other means, the body 
becomes the efficient servant of themind. Courage, perseverance, decision, forbear- 
ance, become habits of the soul. The social games are as a sun for the child’s dis- 
position; without them it languishes into egoism, weakness, and isolation. 
He advises the kindergartners not to be too punctilious in their following of Froebel, 
and to study the child more than the writings of Froebel and his followers. The chief 
test of her work is the joyous cheerfulness of her children; where this is lacking in- 
jury must result. ~ : 
The experiment of Switzerland to establish and maintain kindergartens by means 
-of organized private effort and to admit state aid oily in the way of assistance to 
private effort has yielded significant results. Public sentiment has steadily grown 
in their favor and is actively enlisted; the greed of speculation and clerical as well 
as denominational interference have been successfully kept out of the way. Every- 
where kindergartens flourish and are on the infcrease. Nowhere else is there such 
alacrity in meeting the requirements of childhood with reference to buildings, play- 
grounds, and appliances of allkinds. The average of thirty children to the teacher is 
scrupulously maintained, and professional preparation of teachers receives most care- 
ful attention. 4 
A beautiful spirit reigns in the kindergartens themselves, a reverence for childhood 
and for common sense in the treatment of children which it is delightful to mect in 
these days of forced growth and system-worship. In a late report of the kindergar- 
tens of Zurich we read: “The physical welfare of the children was carefully consid- 
ered. Daily, if the weather permitted, they were taken into the open air for a walk. 
The abundance of fresh air and their permanent state of cheerfulness and joy bore 
excellent fruit. Many mothers acknowledged gratefully how much the children had 
gained in vigor and health through the influence of the kindergarten. *.* * An 
additional advantage derived from this daily walk lies in the fact that it removes the 
temptation of having the children work excessively—a temptation which is abun- 
dantly offered by Froebel’s occupations.” 
Much stress is laid throughout on the proper respect for the child’s spontaneity as 
the starting point and source of all development, and on its direction into habits of 
order and industry. Kindliness, active love of the neighbor, and reverence for all 
things, great and small, are inculeated in truly Froebelian manner. Everywhere 
system, which in Geneva is so prominently emphasized, yields to the deeper needs 
of soul development. . 
In the canton of Geneva, and in French Switzerland generally, infant school work 
is of much olderdate. It originated in Geneva in 1826 under the influence of similar 
work done in France; and, as in France, the écoles enfantines of Geneva were organ- 
ized after the manner of the English infant schools. These schools were in great 
favor with the people, and their expenses were cheerfully borne by the communes. 
In 1848 the state decreed that every commune that established an école enfantine 
should receive a subsidy of 200 francs. The law of 1872 made it the duty of every 
commune to establish such a school, placed all these schools under the supervision 
of the state, and materially increased the amount expended for them by the state. 
In 1876 these écoles enfantines were placed under the supervision of Yadame von Por- 
tugall, who labored with a great degree of success to transform them into kinder- 
gartens. In accordance with the regulations of 1888 their organization is as follows: 
“The infant schools are meant to guide and enhance the bodily and intellectual 
development of the children, and to prepare them for the primary school! They are 
composed of a lower division for children between the ages of 3 and 6, and a higher 
division for children 6 to7 years old. In both divisions the instruction consists 
chiefly of object lessons (legons de choses), manual occupations, games, and songs. 
These schools are gratuitous, but not obligatory. Children are admitted at four 
different periods during the year—at the close of the summer vacation, October, in 
January, and after the Easter holidays. The infant schools are open daily, except 
on Sundays, Thursdays, and legal holidays, from 8 to 1la.m.,and 1to4p.m. Each 
class has one teacher. When the number of children permanently exceeds 40, an 
assistant must be provided. The duty of the teachers is to watch over the intellec- 
tual, moral, and physical education of the children; to inculcate good principles, 
establish good habits, proper manners, and correct language. They must carefully 
abstain from all denominational teaching.” 
In 1887 the canton of Geneva maintained 68 public kindergartens, accommodating 
3,268 children, with 78 teachers. The following programme, which prevailed under 
the administration of Madame von Portugall, and which has not since beenmaterially 
-modified, will give an idea of the inner working of these institutions:

It is very evident, both from the regulations and the programme, that the spirit of 
Froebel has not entered very deeply into these kindergartens. The average number 
of children assigned to one teacher is too great; the time assigned to the occupa- 
tions is too long, more particularly with the younger children; the occupations 
themselves seem to come like subjects of instruction; and the entire programme 
is too sedentary. Nevertheless, there speaks from every line of reports and decrees 
concerning these schools a deep-seated respect for childhood which will sooner or 
later liberate the little ones from the thraldom of schoolishness and the superstitious 
worship of “ syst®me.”

PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 
  TIl.—Grrmany. 
The available information concerning kindergartens in Germany is very incomplete, 
In most cases the kindergartens are maintained by private effort or by associations, 
and the communal or public kindergarten is comparatively rare. As a consequence 
there are many different kinds of kindergartens to suit the purposes of the founders. 
There is the ‘private kindergarten,” (private par excellence) established by the 
teacher either for the sake of earning a livelihood or with a view of pioneer work 
in the cause of Froebel; the “association kindergarten,” established and main- 
tained by associations whose members have more or less clearly recognized the edu- 
eational value of this work; the ‘“ family kindergarten,” maintained by one or more 
families who desire to control the associations of the children; the ‘public kinder- 
garten” (Volkskindergarten), not unlike our charity kindergarten and day nursery, 
which takes care, usually during the entire day, of children whose parents are negli- 
gent or engaged in work; and the “ communal kindergarten,” established and main- 
tained by communities in connection with the communal schools. 
The ideal or “normal kindergarten” receives the children for a limited time dur- 
ing the day, from 9 to 12 or 1 o’clock, or from 10 to 12 in the forenoon, and from 2 to 4 
o’clock in the afternoon. Its purpose is to relieve the family during the busiest hours 
of the housewife, and atthe same time to supply the social training which the family 
can not give. It isusually limited in the number of children, in order to obviate the 
necessity of dividing them into groups and classes in accordance with their age or 
state of progress. Frocbel himself had insisted with much urgency upon the indi- 
viduality of the kindergarten. ‘This wholeness was needed for the ‘‘ all-sided unity 
of life” which his ideal demanded, and which called even for the regular attendance 
of mothers and children of school age. Yet when kindergartens grew in number of 
children this demand of Froebel was set aside and kindergartens of two or even three 
grades or classes were established. Thus industrial and commercial hindrances 
rendered it necessary, even in Germany, to deviate largely from Froebel’s beautiful 
ideal, and to subordinate the educational value of the kindergarten to questions of 
social expediency. 
Many factors seem to militate against the general introduction of kindergartens in 
Germany, all of which seem to have their root in the excessively conservative ten- 
dency of the German character. Hence the opposition of the clergy, of school men, 
of the constituted political authorities to this “innovation.” Hence the notorious 
decree of the Prussian minister of education, von Raumer, in 1851, which prohibited 
the establishment of kindergartens in Prussia on the ground of their alleged social- 
istic and atheistic tendency, a decree which was maintained in spite of the protests 
and explanations of Froebel and his colleagues until 1860. Hence the bitter attacks 
on the part of teachers who could see little good in an institution that taught chil- 
dren ‘‘to play” and which employed women as teachers. More concerning this will 
be found in two interesting letters published in the appendix and addressed to me, 
by Rev. B. Baehring, of Winfeld, one of the most venerable as well as most active 
defenders of Froebel. 
Yet this opposition is steadily met and is gradually yielding before the rare devotion, 
equally marked in the German character, on the part of those who have become con- 
vinced of the truth and value of Froebel’s teachings. It will be of interest in this 
connection to illustrate, with the aid of a few typical instances, the devotion which 
characterizes the establishment of kindergartens in most cases. 
Until about twelve years ago there were no kindergartens in the beautiful city of 
Aachen. There were day nurseries, but these were carried on without method and 
pedagogic insight or followed the models of the English infant school; Froebel had 
no share in them. About 1878 Hubert Kneppers, a teacher in the city of Aachen, 
through some accident, became a devoted student of Froebel’s ideas, and his enthu- 
siasm ripened rapidly into living deeds. He was the father of two children under 
school age. These and four children of the neighborhood, invited for the purpose, 
were formed by him into a kindergarten, taught after school hours by him and his 
excellent wife, who presided also over a small private school. 
At the same time a young lady who had caught the inspiration studied the sub- 
ject under the direction of the excellent couple, so that early in 1879 a public kin- 
dergarten, with 17 children, could be established. Prejudices of all kinds then beset 
the young enterprise, but Mr. and Mrs. Kneppers only redoubled their efforts. For- 
tunately the local press was favorable, or at least not hostile, and opened its columns 
to Hubert Kneppers, who wielded his pen so effectively that the more intelligent 
portion of the community became actively interested in the work. In the fall of 
1879 it became necessary to find more spacious quarters, and the number of children— 
who now paid a monthly fee of about 3 marks—rose to 50. In 1881 Mrs. Kneppers 
discontinued her private school, in order to devote herself, with her husband, wholly 
to the kindergarten and to a rapidly growing school for the training of kindergarten. 
ED 91——45

teachers. One year later the “ Industrial Association,” which conducted a number 
of day nurseries, requested Mr. Kneppers to transform these nurseries into kinder- 
gartens. In this work he was so successful that two years later he had under his 
direction six kindergartens, with nearly 1,000 children, and in 1890 the nufnber of 
public kindergartens maintained by the ‘ Industrial Association ” had risen to nine- 
teen, requiring an annual expenditure of 70,000 marks. 
Less brilliant, but not less instructive, is the history of the first kindergarten 
efforts at Karlsruhe, the capital of the Duchy of Baden. In 1870 a clergyman, who 
had learned to appreciate the value of the genuine kindergarten, began to agitate 
among his friends for the establishment of such an institution. Immediately he was 
beset from all sides with many anonymous protests and otherwise called upon to 
abandon his godless undertaking. But he continued his efforts and opened, in the 
fall of the year, a kindergarten with 22 children, in the lower story of his parsonage. 
The kindergarten was successful enough, and has held itsown to this day, but he has 
found it impossible to transform into true kindergartens the numerous infant schools 
and day nurseries of the city, and to overcome the indifference of the people at large 
to the better ways of Froebel. 
In the majority of instances the kindergartens are the work of associations of 
intelligent and philanthropic men and women. Thus, in 1875,a number of gentle- 
men under the presidency of Burgomaster Ammann, of Heidelberg, decided *to form 
a “ Froebel Association,” whose purpose it should be to establish kindergartens in 
the good old university town. In February, 1876, the organization of this associa- 
tion was completed, and in May of the same year an association kindergarten was 
opened with 94 children. The ideal of this association is tersely stated in its first 
annual report, which declares it to be the purpose of the association “to establish 
kindergartens in accordance with Froebel’s system, institutions in which children of 
all social ranks may be occupied for afew hours each day in such a way that all 
their faculties may be-developed naturally. Such kindergartens are notschools which 
are meant for older children, nor are they devoted to mere arbitrary play as day 
nurseries; they are, rather, methodical institutions in which children from 3 to 6 
years old are to be cultivated naturally in social union with other children of the 
same ages, their powers being unfolded and directed in their growth by means of 
play and work, and their hearts being led to a generous and sympathetic self- 
activity. 
In 1877 an auxiliary association composed of ladies was formed, and during the 
same year a public kindergarten (Volkskindergarten) was established in the western 
suburb of Heidelberg. For this enterprise the city council had placed temporary 
rooms at the disposal of the association, and had voted an annual contribution of 
400 marks on condition that the association should not require the children to pay 
more than 20 pfennig (about 5 cents) weekly fee. One hundred and thirty-eight 
children sought admission in this kindergarten, but only 50 could be received. 
The status of the association and its kindergartens seems to have remained prac-_ 
tically unchanged to this day. The report of 1888 shows that the average attend- 
ance of children in the ‘association kindergarten” (Vereins kindergarten) has re- 
mained the same, and that of the “public kindergarten” (Volkskindergarten) has 
been very slightly increased. 
The amount of gratuitous work done by the members of these associations is 
remarkable. This circumstance speaks well for the public spirit of participants. 
It is to be remarked, too, that members are recruited chiefly from the cultured classes 
who seem to be fully aware of the additional responsibility which superior culture 
puts upon them. Probably these general characteristics of the Froebel work in 
Germany are nowhere more clearly illustrated than in Leipzig, Breslau, Dresden, 
Berlin, and Hamburg. For this reason the organization and work of associations in 
these cities have been singled out from the vast mass of similar material to which 
almost every German city contributes. 
At Leipzig a number of high-minded ladies and gentlemen met and organized in 
1871 the “Association for the establishment of Volkskindergarten.” A circular was 
issued setting forth the object of the society. A few extracts from this circular will 
do much to illustrate the great advance such associations had made in their views 
concerning child culture over the friends of infant.education in France, Belgium, 
Italy, and England. After prefacing that the advancement of popular education is 
the most important concern of the present time and that ‘every man of culture must 
feel it to be a duty peculiarly his own to aid in every effort that looks to the en- 
hancement of popular education ;” the circular proceeds as follows concerning the 
attitude of the society towards the “kindergarten pedagogies of Frederick Froebel :” 
It is clearly a matter that concerns the honor of the cultured men and women of our people that so 
precious and propitious an idea born in our midst should no longer be permitted to remain in abey- 
ance because of unfavorable circumstances, and that they should aid it by furnishing every opportun- ity for the manifestation of its high value in the best form. In many cities this has ‘been done; in our 
city, however, there are very few institutions that fully represent the purpose of the kindergarten. Consequently the high significance of the kindergarten is not properly understood in Leipzig, and ~

  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 707 
its blessings are lost to the public education of our city. Probably it is on this account that the city authorities have not yet seen fit to establish kindergartens in connection with the public schools (Volksschulen), although the “‘Leachers’ Association” and the “Pedagogic Society” have recommended that girls should serve for a period in a good Kindergarten and receive af school instraction in kindergarten principles, and although the pedagogic world generally holds it to be desirable to make the kindergarten the first or lowest class of the public school. ‘hese requirements can not remain permanently ignored, at least ina city which means to keep pace with progress in her public education. ‘At the same time kindergarten principles fail to enter the homes of the people and to influence home education, because the opportunities to observe its means and outcome are sorare. For fre- quent visits to 2 good kindergarten would prove instructive and beneficial for the daughter of the wealthiest family as well as for the poorest nurse-girl, with the only difference that the former would have better opportunities for quick perception and careful meditation. Again, many parents who would giadly avail themselves of the kindergarten for their children are unable to pay the required fee. ‘To all these the public kindergarten would afford relief. ‘That Leipzig is not devoid of charity when physical misery calls for relief is known even in forei, lands, aud this same generous sympathy has long ago labored to aid the children of the poor by the establishment of a few day nui ~. But the mere gratification of bodily wants and prevention of bodily injury is not enough for the children of the poor. Weshould at the same time labor to improve and better their condition by means of education, so that they may find in culture and orderly living essential elements of happiness. Efforts to solve this problem will of necessity point to Froebel’s 
kindergarten principles as the key and beginning of a rational education. In order to secure the Dlessings of this to our people we need not only a sympathetic heart, but also a sympathetic intellect, 80 that our interest-in the cause may be enhanced by insight into its requirements. 
In a subsequent call for membership the executive committce says, on the same 
subject: 
Among the weighty problems of our time that of education occupies the foremost place. The great importance, not only of school education, but also of domestic and prescholastic education, is gener- ally recognized. In many cities of Germany the necessity of a wider diffusion of kindergartens and of kindergarten principles in the domestic education of little children has been persistently empha- 
sized 1t is obvious that poor parents labor under great disadvantages in this respect, and yet itis of the greatest importance that the children of these parents should from earliest infancy receive ele- vating and helpful impressions and be guarded against pernicious influences. For the whole people it is a matter of deepest concern that the children of the poor, too, should be placed under most favor- 
able conditions with reference to their religious, moral, and intellectual development. Hitherto private philanthropy has labored to meet this want by means of establishing day nurser- ies. In these institutions the children are kept during the entire day, and for a nominal fee receive 
also their noon luncheon. Although it is desirable to perfect these by the introduction of kinder- 
garten principles in the treatment of the little children, their costliness hinders their general diffusion. 
esides these are many pareats who would gladly secure to their little ones the benefits of a kinder- garten without the aid of a day nursery, if the expense could be kept within their means. ‘This association, therefore, will labor to establish, maintain, and conduct cheap kindergartens (Volkskin- dergiirten) for the benefit of these parents, and at the same time to aid existing day nurseries. The 
attainment of this aim is of vast importance to the prosperous development of our city, and general participation in the work on the part of both ladies and gentlemen is desirable. 
The membership of the association grew rapidly, so that in May of the year 1872 
the first Volkskindergarten of the association was opened with 40 children. Appli 
cations, however, came in such numbers and the interest in the work of the associa- 
tion had become so well developed that it was decided to erect a building for the 
purposes of the association. In June, 1873, the 40 little children marched from the 
old building to their own new home, carrying little flags and fragrant bouquets and 
singing an appropriate song, and their number rapidly grew to 120, = 
About the same time, in December, 1871, there was organized at Leipzig another 
association of similar import, yet of wider scope, and counting among its founders 
and members many of the members of the association. just described. It assumed 
the name “Association for the Advancement of Domestic and Popular Education” 
(Verein fiir Familien- und Volkserziehung). Its aim was not onlyt he support of 
kindergartens but the education of kindergartners and the culture of girls and 
mothers in general for their educational vocation. 
The first report of this association was published early in 1873. During the first 
years of its existence the members had displayed a most remarkable and _all-sided 
activity. They had arranged for and delivered six public lectures free to all comers, 
as follows: 
(1) The philosophical significance of Froebel’s principles of education, by Prof. Dr. Ahrens.

In addition to these lectures, two courses of weekly lectures on pedagogics and 
hygiene had been provided for ladies who might wish to join them, These courses 
were attended by about fifty ladies, and proved so successful that one of the courses 
was continued during the summer. ‘ 
For the benefit of members a number of pedagogic journals were kept for circula- 
tion among those who might desire to read them, and a beginning of a circulating 
educational library was made. x 
There existed in Leipzig at the time of the organization of the association ten or 
               
   
  
     
      twelve private kindergartens, many of which were in very incompetent hands. In_      
-P-A-G-E-60
      708 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
some cases young girls who had acted as assistants for a number of months had 
established their own private kindergartens. With the help of the better private 
kindergartens the association proposed and, in a measure, established certain ideal 
requirements concerning the arrangement and conduct of kindergartens and thus 
_exercised a healthy moral pressure, materially limiting the field and popularity of 
incompetent kindergartners, . 
The work of establishing public kindergartens (Volkskindergirten) devolved 
upon a committee under the leadership of Mrs. Dr. Goldschmidt. In order to secure 
an initial fund, the ladies arranged for a lottery, which proved quite successful. 
This fund was further increased by loans that bore no interest and which were to be 
paid back in very easy installments. The city council granted the use of a suitable 
piece of ground; seme well-built barracks that had served their purpose in 1870 
were bought at a low figure and moved to this piece of ground; and in July, 1872, 
the kindergarten was opened with 60 children under a competent kindergartner and 
two assistants. One month later the number of children had risen to 100, and it be- 
came necessary to engage a second kindergartner; and in September a third kinder- 
gartner and assistant had to be employed, inasmuch as 150 children had obtained 
admission. Subsequently additional Volkskindergédrten were established in other 
‘parts of the city. 
Another enterprise of this association was the establishment of a training school 
for kindergartners. They limited themselves, however, to the preparation of young 
women for family kindergartens. Up to the year 1878 140 kindergartners of this 
character had graduated from the institution. The course of study comprised, in 
addition to specific kindergarten subjects, instruction in the German language, ped- 
agogics, hygiene, geometry, and natural history. 
The course occupied one year. The pupils paid a monthly fee of 2 thalers. Each 
pupil was held to visit the kindergarten on three days each week. During these 
visits they were expected to help in the reception and dismissal of the children, and 
in every kind of service which the presiding kindergartner might require. During 
the second quarter they were required to assist in conducting games and occupations; 
during the third quarter they were expected to be able to conduct a kindergarten 
independently ; and the last quarter was devoted wholly to theoretical work. 
The entire work of the Volkskindergiérten in their connection with the training 
school is under the supervision of a director, who is a member of the pedagogic sec- 
tion of the association and responsible to this section for the character and conduct 
of the training school. 
In addition, a committee of ladies is appointed for each kindergarten for purposes 
of general supervision, and to whom certain cases of discipline and nonattendance 
are referred. It is expected that one or more of these ladies be present in the kinder- 
garten during some portion of each session. : 
My efforts to obtain reliable information concerning the growth of this remarkable 
work after 1880 have utterly failed. Enough, however, has been here presented to 
reveal the depth of philanthropic ardor that animates the association, as well as 
the marvellous devotion to recognized duty—so ingrained in the German character— 
and the philosophic thoroughness that pervades every portion of the enterprise. 
An equally remarkable experience, though of wider scope and richer in results, is 
that of Breslau. Additional interest attaches to its history, too, from the fact that 
in its inception itis the work of women, and women have borne a prominent part 
in its administration to this day. In 1861 Madame Ronge, in an address before a 
number of intelligent and large-hearted ladies, presented the claims of Froebel’s 
educational principles and of the kindergarten upon their consideration and active 
sympathy. The immediate result was the organization of an association with the 
object of establishing kindergartens. A most formidable obstacle presented itself at 
once in the almost hostile attitude of the authorities towards their project. It was 
said in these quarters ‘that in view of repeated scandalous proceedings in kinder- 
gartens, great care was requisite in the granting of concessions for opening such 
institutions.” A kindergartner was obtained from the training school of Madame 
Froebel at Hamburg, but the magistrate decided that ‘inasmuch as the persons who 
issued the certificate of the lady were foreigners, and, therefore, unknown to the 
magistrate, the ministry alone could grant her appointment,” and that ‘unless a 
directress agreeable to the magistrate were appointed at once, the kindergarten must 
be closed without further delay.” 
Consequently a kindergartner was obtained from nearer quarters, and at the same 
time it was decided to establish a training school for kindergartners under the aus- 
pices of the association, which was opened in 1863. Up to that time two kindergar- 
tens had been established. In 1869 the number of these had risen to nine, and in 
1874 to twelve. Five of these were styled association kindergartens (Vereinskinder- 
garten), and seven public kindergartens (Volkskindergdrten). In the former the 
monthly fee was about 75 cents; in the latter, 10 to 20 cents. The number of chil- 
cren registered in 1874 was 1,130, with an average attendance of about one-half that
-P-A-G-E-61

  number. These numbers seem to have been maintained until 1887, when an addi- 
tional kindergarten was established in honor of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
association. 
The course of study in the training school for kindergartners comprises in one year ~ 
the subjects of general pedagogics, kindergarten theory and practice, natural his- 
tory, hygiene, drawing, singing, and calisthenics, with review lessons in German 
and arithmetic. 
In 1884 the association established also a course of instruction for nurse girls. 
Candidates for admission must be 15 years old, and must be able to give evidence 
of satisfactory elementary instruction. They are to be prepared in a six months’ 
course to take the care of children between the ages of 2 and 6, and at the same 
time to do light housework. They are instructed in Froebel’s principles of educa- 
tion and practical kindergarten occupations, in hygiene for little children, in Ger- 
man (particularly in the art of telling stories and in reading to children), in wash- 
ing, ironing, darning, and in the use of the sewing machine. 
‘The energetic, all-sided activity of this association overcame all opposition. In 
due time the magistrate and local administrative bodies opened not only their hearts 
but the public purse for the support of its kindergartens, and the province of Silesia 
has now not a city in which growing kindergarten work is not done by some mis- 
sionary who owes her skill and her zeal to the training school at Breslau. 
The kindergarten history of Hamburg is doubly interesting, partly because of the 
success of the movement and partly because of the part which Froebel and Madame 
- Louise Froebel had in its development. The reporter owes most of his information 
concerning the work in this city to Madame Louise Froebel, Miss Margarethe Kroeger, 
and Heinrich Hoffmann, a direct pupil of Froebel. The letters of these friends are 
printed in the Appendix. 
It appears that the first kindergarten in Hamburg was established by Madame 
Doris Liitkens. This lady, directress of a private school at Hamburg, had met Froebel 
and listened to his memorable presentation and defense of the kindergarten at 
Rudolstadt. On her return to Hamburg she made an enthusiastic plea for Froebel’s 
_ educational ideas, and for his views on the mission of women, before the Woman’s 
Association, and herself immediately, with the aid of Alwina Middendorff, opened 
a kindergarten in connection with her schoo]. In the following year two additional 
private kindergartens were establighed, and the ““Woman’s Club,” under the leader- 
ship of Mrs. Johanna Goldschmidt, invited Froebel himself to spend a winter at 
Hamburg, in order to aid in the training of kindergartners and in the establishment 
of new kindergartens. 
Froebel accepted the call, but sent his friend Middendorft to precede him and to 
clear the way. . In the latter part of September he arrived himself and labored faith- 
fully until the spring of the following year, expounding his educational views in 
pul lic lectures, instructing young women in the theory and practice of kindergarten 
work, tilling the soil for a rich and copious harvest which even the celebrated edict 
of von Raumer could not blight. He was much aided in his work by Dr. Wichard 
Lange, the affianced of Alwina Middendorff. This enthusiastic young teacher, who 
was destined to play an important part in the educational development of Germany, 
published several popular pamphlets in support of the new education, and undertook 
in January, 1850, the editorial management of Friedrich Froebel’s Wochenschrift, 
which revealed Froebel’s plan in many important details. 
Froebel had the satisfaction of seeing the first fruits of his toil in the establish- 
ment of the third private kindergarten and of the first Biirgerkindergéirten, not 
unlike the Volkskindergdrten of other cities, but intended for less needy classes of 
the population. It was the first success of the kindergarten association, and opened 
in the spring of 1850 with 70 children, Froebel himself delivering the dedicatory 
address. Two other Biirgerkindergdrten followed soon after. At present Ham- 
burg has nine such kindergartens, each one with a capacity of about one hundred 
children, and conducted by a supervising kindergartner and several assistants. The 
expenses are defrayed from the children’s fees, from the annual contributions of 
members of the association, endowments, and legacies. Each kindergarten is under 
the immediate care of six ladies and three gentlemen, and two gentlemen and one 
lady from each of these committees constitute the general executive committee which 
directs the entire work. 
The fourth kindergarten was established in 1854 under the direction of Madame 
Louise Froebel. During the forenoons she devoted herself to the kindergarten; 
during the afternoons she instructed a number of young ladies in the theory and 
practice of the work. This led the central committee to the establishment of a 
school for the training of kindergartners in 1856. Madame Froebel was transferred 
to this school, to which she gave her energies until 1860, when she established a 
private kindergarten, transition class, and training school. 
Another organization, the Froebel Association, conducts a flourishing kindergarten 
and a training school for young ladies who desire to prepare themselves for family

kindergartens. Similarly the ‘Association for the Advancement of Industrial 
Activity among Women” has a kindergarten and a training school for kinder- 
gartners. <A private training school of considerable note is conducted by Miss Mar- 
garethe Kroeger. 
Since 1878 Heinrich Hoffmann has conducted a flourishing institution for the train- 
ing of family kindergartners and nurse girls. Heinrich Hoffmann, a direct disciple 
of Froebel, had made his first attempt in the same direction at Hamburg in 1850, 
At this time he instructed forty young girls free of charge for two hours daily in the 
principles and practices of the new education; but the decree of von Rrumer 
interfered with his activity, inasmuch as he had not yet acquired citizenship at 
Hamburg and was, therefore, subject to Prussian laws, His own interesting letter, 
printed in the Appendix, will give additional details of the activity of this excel- 
Tent man. 
In addition to this, Hamburg maintains at present thirty to forty private kinder- 
gartens of a high character and a number of Warte-Schulen (day nurseries). In all 
of these kindergarten principles are at the helm. The children are received at 8 or 
9 o'clock in the morning, and are kept until 6 or7 o’clock in the evening. They 
receive their regular meals and pay from 3 to 16 cents per week. 
On the whole, it seems that the cause is in good ways because it is in good hands. 
“ There are, indeed,” as Miss Kroeger writes me, ‘still many who oppose the kinder- 
garten, even among teachers; a number of physicians, too, are hostile. They claim 
that the children are taxed excessively, or made precocious, or that they areexposed. 
to infectious diseases, or play too much, etc.; but in spite of all this the cause of 
Froebel flourishes and thrives. Those who persist in their opposition do not take 
the trouble to visit a good kindergarten, else they would surely change their opin- 
ions; as so many others have done after a few hours stay in a good kindergarten.” 
In a spirit of much gratitude Madame Louise Froebel writes: 
“Tf now we ask what has been the outcome of the last fifty years of toil and 
growth, the answer comes: Through the grace of God the outcome is most gratify- 
ing, and is strengthened and enriched from year to year. The little tree planted 
fifty years ago has been bent and torn by many a storm; but from every attack it 
rose with new vigor. The educational principles of Froebel have entered the family. 
  " Many unconsciously follow his guidance, and yery, very many have clearly appre- 
hended his teachings. The late development of homes of refuge for boys and girls 
are a necessary consequence of his efforts; indeed, their beginnings are found in his 
educational institutions. Should the spirit of love, of industry, of generous produc- 
tive work become more generally diffused—as in the light of past experience we may 
well hope—Froebel’s ardent hope to give to mankind peace, and joy, and freedom 
will surely be realized.” 
Perhaps no other city of Germany has done as much as Dresden to establish and 
diffuse the educational ideas of Froebel in their purity and far-reaching significance. 
Possibly, too, the kindergarten history of Dresden gains in interest from the fact 
that within its walls was established the first kindergarten, even before Froebel had 
found the name kindergarten and had opened his own ‘‘occupation school” (Be- 
schiftigungs-Schule) or institution for the cultivation of little children (Kleinkinder 
pflegeanstalt) at Blankenburg. Adolf Frankenberg, who had shared the vicissi- 
tudes of Froebel’s life at Willisau and had returned with him to the institution at 
Keilhau under Barop’s direction, was the founder of this school. In 1838 he accom- 
panied as guide and teacher 20 pupils of Barop’s institute on a pedestrian trip to 
Dresden, He carried with him a few samples of the gifts Froebel had so far com- 
pleted, the ball, cube, and cylinder and a box of eight small cubes. He explained 
the use of these things to Prof. Peters, an influential teacher. Prof. Peters became 
interested and convinced. He urged Frankenberg to return. 
The latter reported this invitation to Froebel, who immediately decided to go with 
Frankenberg to Dresden and himself to present his ideas. Froebel’s historians dis- 
agree materially concerning the issue of his direct effort. Some maintain that he 
failed to interest his audience, that his words were ill chosen, his presentation of 
the subject chaotic, that his illustrations were childish and ridiculous, and that he 
disgusted Queen Mary with his entire scheme, he retaining her after the close of his 
address and importuning her with endless volubility. Others praise the logical 
crystallization of his thought as presented in this memorable address and emphasize 
as facts that he convinced and inspired with enthusiasm the best among his hearers, 
and that the Queen was deeply interested and remained (of her own accord) after 
the address to ask for further explanations, and in thanking him praised his “‘beauti- 
ful and noble endeavors.” 
Atany rate, Froebel was induced still further to expound his plan in the presence 
of a number of doctors, professors, and other lovers of science and education, and 
to visit with Frankenberg a noted day nursery where the latter for several weeks 
‘used the gifts with the children and secured the favorable judgment of many influ- 
ential and philanthropic ladies and gentlemen.  
-P-A-G-E-63
PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. — iL 
Indeed, a number of these prevailed upon Frankenberg to remain in Dresden ahd 
to open an ‘occupation school” (Beschiéftigungs Schule). Much annoying red-tape 
hindrance had to be overcome before legal concession for the continuance of the en- 
terprise could be secured and Frankenberg’s enterprise could become an insured _ 
success. 
On the 19th of April, 1845, Frankenberg married Louige Hermann, who played an 
important part in the subsequent development of the Froebel workin Dresden; and 
two days later—on Froebel’s birthday—40 little children, in festive array, bearing 
wreaths of flowers and led by Froebel and Frankenberg, marched from their old 
quarters to anew and more attractive school, where their new “auntie” received, 
them. 
Froebel began on this occasion at Dresden, and continued, in the winter of 1848, 
his as 
so much for Germany, and of which Dresden was destined to furnish a most notable 
example in the ‘‘ General Educational Association” (Allgemeiner Erziehungsverein), 
whose history and constitution will be discussed later on.    
  Froebel’s memorable visit to Dresden (1848) was due chiefly to the efforts of Mad- - 
ame Louise Frankenberg, by which she had organized for him a course of instrue- 
tion for the training of kindergartners. -This course was remarkably successful; a 
number of new kindergartens and training schools for kindergartners were estab- 
lishod and Dresden became the chief center of kindergarten agitation, the Mecea 
of the Froebel worshipers, after Froebel and Middendorf had closed their eyes for- 
ever. In 1853 Dresden had three training schools for kindergartners, the most 
prominent of which was that of Bruno Marquart. A few years later Otto Kellner 
established, together with his wife, a similar institution, which has flourished down 
to our days under the genial direction of its founders, 
A new impetus was given to the kindergarten propaganda when, in 1871, the bar- 
oness Marenholtz-Buelow made Dresden her home. She induced a number of influ- 
ential public-spirited men and women to organize the ‘ General Educational Asso- 
ciation” (Allgemeiner Erziehwngsverein), which was to have its headquarters at 
Dresden, but its members and branch associations in other places as well. Its aim 
was “the advancement of physical and intellectual (leiblich-geistig), religious and 
moral (religiés-sittlich), education in the homes and in public institutions.” For this 
purpose it endeavored to arouse general interest in education, to diffuse correct views 
on the subject of education, and to advance eduction by the establishment of prac- 
tical institutions—such as institutions for the higher culture of women, with special 
reference to their universal educational vocation, institutions for the training of pro- 
fessional educators of both sexes, kindergartens, school gardens, and other institu- 
tious for the education of the young. The immediate object of the association was 
the establishment of a Froebel institute, which was to serve asa model for all similar 
institutions. 
Membership is secured by individuals by the payment of an annual fee of 3 marks; 
by corporate bodies by the payment of 3 per cent of their regular annual fees, or by 
the payment of from 15 to 30 marks, according to the number of their members. 
Such associations may secure permanent membership by one payment of 150 marks. 
The Froebel Institute was opened in 1872. Its chief work is the training of kinder- 
gartners. This is done in two departments. The first department comprises those 
who prepare for the directorship of kindergartens and those who would secure scien- 
tific preparation for the work of education in their own families. The second de- 
partment is for family kindergartners and kindergarten assistants. The course of 
instruction for the two departments is practically the same, and lasts eighteen 
months.’ It comprises general pedagogics, theory and practice of Froebelian educa- 
tion, anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, natural history, with special reference to 
horticulture and the needs of little children, the elements of geometry, with special 
reference to the gifts and occupations, German language, the art of story-telling, 
object lessons, Froebel’s mother and nursery songs and the finger games, theory 
and practice of the gifts and occupations, drawing in the network suggested by 
Froebel, singing, kindergarten games, and calisthenics. The tuition is 100 marks 
for the entire course. The expenses for material are estimated at 75 marks. The stu- 
dents are held to regular attendance at the Volkskindergidrien school gardens, day 
nurseries, and at the children’s hospital, where they observe the work done and fur- 
nish such assistance as may be required of them. : * Students must be at least 16 years old, and must pass an entrance examination be- 
fore admission. At the end of this course, a public examination is held and the stu- 
dents obtain diplomas which are signed by the officers of the Institute and by aroyal 
commissioner who represents the state on these occasions. 
An interesting feature of this course is the Uebungsabend, an evening set aside 
one or twice a month during the winter term, when students in the presence of the 
officers of the institute go through certain practical exercises with the children, dis- 
play their own work, and in other ways report progress, tation for the formation of educational associations, which subsequently did 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
A third department of instruction receives young girls who desire to prepare them- 
selves as Kinderpflegerinnen, children’s nurses. The course for these lasts one year, 
and requires a fee of 24 marks, and an expenditure of about 25 marks for material. 
‘The subjects of instruction are: Physical care of little children, German story-telling, 
object lessons, Froebel’s principles of education, occupations and movement games 
of the kindergarten, elementg of natural history, domestic occupations (such as wash- 
ing, ironing, mending, ete.). The members of this department, too, are held to regu- 
lar attendance at kindergartens, day nurseries, and the children’s hospital for obser- 
yation and such assistance as may be required. 
In 1881 the institute established the first Froebelian school-garden (Schul-Garten). 
The children who take part in this are received on Wednesday and Saturday after- 
noons, when school is closed, and practice drawing, modeling, cutting, and other 
occupations in advance of the kindergarten requirements. At the same time they 
are kept busy in the garden, make excursions to the fields and woods, and are afforded 
opportunities for games and calisthenic exercises. 
‘The great value of the beneficent work of this institute appears from the fact that 
since its organization about 2,000 young women have graduated from its three de- 
partments, and have carried the gospel of Froebel into all phases of early child-cul- 
ture. e 
Another beneficent work of the Allgemeine Erzichungsverein is the uniform organ- 
ization of public kindergartens in the various districts of Dresden. Of these there 
are now seven in operation attended by about 600 children, under the guidance of 
ten directresses and a number of assistants. Each kindergarten is the special care 
of a district association which supplies whatever means may be needed to supply 
deficits in the income from monthly fees and the annual contribution from the All- 
gemeine Erziehungsverein. 
For the guidance and emulation of these district associations the central associa- 
tion has drawn up ideal regulations concerning the character and management of 
kindergartens. These regulations require for each kindergarten two or three 
spacious rooms; one of these is to be used for the movement games, the others for 
thé play with the gifts and occupations. Each occupation room is to be furnished 
with the necessary tables and benches and with two glass cases; in one of these the 
occupation material is kept, in the other the finished work of the children, curious 
objects, material for object-lessons, and the like. The walls are adorned with tables 
and pictures for the usual object lessons. 
The garden—indispensable in a fully-equipped kindergarten—should afford a play- 
ground for the milder season, a sand heap for the smallest children, and space for a 
sufficient number of garden beds to be planted and cared for by the children. 
Only carefully-trained kindergartners with sufficient experience should be em- 
ployed as directresses. They should be at least 20 years old, of gentle disposition, 
irreproachable character, of pleasant voice, and sufficiently skilled in musie to be 
able to use good methods in teaching songs and singing. 
The number of pupils for one kindergartner should not exceed twenty, inasmuch 
as it is impossible for one person to afford the needed care and individual attention 
to a greater number of children. [The regulations, however, grant that financial 
reasons may compel the public kindergarten to exceed this number, but insist that 
in no case should more than 40 children be in the hands of one person. As soon as 
this number is passed an assistant should be employed. This assistant, however, 
should be as well qualified for her work as the directress. In no case should young 
and inexperienced persons and persons without professional training be engaged for this 
urpose. | 
E openbeal programme for the work is to be prepared by the proper authorities. 
But in its application the spontaneity of the children should in no way be sacrificed ; 
nor should it be followed pedantically, but modified in accordance with the needs 
and desires of the children, the prevailing weather and season, and other conditions. 
Great care is recommended with reference to order, cleanliness, ventilation, heat- 
ing, the hygienic condition of the children, the use of occupation material, the 
proper Jength—or rather shortness—of exercises, and all matters that tend to pre- 
serye the mental and physical vigor and elasticity of the pupils. 
Inasmuch as the Allgemeine Erziehunzsverein, through the agency of the Froebel 
Institute, has furnished the teachers of the public kindergartens and by its annual 
contributions to their support enjoys a directing influence in their administration, 
these kindergartens are steadily approaching the ideal set before them. Rudolf 
Benfey praises the unity of procedure in their work, and the fidelity and thorough- 
ness with which each and all seek to carry out Froebel’s directions in every phase 
_ of their work, 
In addition to these public kindergartens Dresden has a number of private kin- 
dergartens, patronized by the children of the wealthier classes. Most of these are 
in excellent hands. ‘They owe their superiority largely to the efforts of Mr. and

Mrs. Kellner, whose training-school for kindergartners aims to supply the wants and 
needs of this class of institutions. 
The beneficent influence of the Allgemeine Erziehunzsverein is, however, not confined 
to Dresden, but extends to many of the larger cities of Germany, Austria-Hungary, 
to Switzerland, Italy, and England. The Froebel associations of Hamburg, Cologne, 
Kassel, of London and Manchester, are connected with it as hpanch associations, and 
many prominent names from different countries are found in its list of members. 
BERLIN. 
  We are informed by Hanschmann, in his admirable biography of Froebel, that 
Madame von Marenholtz-Buelow, during her short stay in Berlin, in 1857, had 
founded an association for the advancement of Froebelian methods in education. 
Although no kindergartens could be established because of the hostile decree of 
von Raumer forbidding their establishment, much was done by this association to 
diffuse better notions concerning kindergartens and, possibly, to prepare the way 
for the abrogation of the decree in 1860. In 1861 Madame von Marenholtz made 
Berlin her home. She found that the association had ceased to exist and had trans- 
ferred its interests to an ‘Association of Ladies for the Advancement of Froebelian 
Kindergartens,” which had been formed in 1859. She was made honorary president 
of this association, and assisted in the establishment of the first two Veveins Kinder- 
gdérten (association kindergartens), and of the first Volkskindergdérten. This name 
was suggested by her for kindergartens, not unlike the Biirgerkindergdrten of 
Hamburg. According to her own statement, however, she found the ‘Ladies’ Asso- 
ciation” inadequate for her purposes, and founded in 1863, with the aid of Professors 
Gneist and Virchow, Dr. Tappenheim, Inspector Poesche, and other prominent 
persons, the Verein fiir Familien- und Volkserziehung (Association for Domestic and 
Popular Education). This association had added to the aims of the Ladies’ Asso- 
ciation, the establishment of schools for the training of kindergartners, children’s 
nurses (Iinderpf-legerinnen), the discussion of educational problems, and the diffu- 
sion of sound educational principles. 
In 1874 the two associations united under the common name of Berliner Froebel- 
Verein (Berlin Froebel Association) and formulated their purposes as follows: 
The association will labor to advance a form of education that cultivates and 
strengthens mind and body, particularly in accordance with the principles of Fred- 
_eric Froebel. It will seek to accomplish this by instructing women in their calling 
as educators, by establishing and maintaining kindergartens, by training teachers 
for the same, by training children’s nurses for families, and by introducing these 
educational principles in existing day nurseries, 
In 1876 this association conducted 8 Vereinskindergdrten for children of well-situ- 
ated parents, and one Volkskindergarten for children of poorer parents. The num- 
ber of children‘in attendance in the former was about 400; the Volkskindergarten 
was attended on an average by 75 children. In 1888 the number of Vereinskinder- 
gérten had been reduced to five, with an average attendance of about 150 children; 
in the Volkskindergarten the average attendance had been reduced to 50 children. 
Dr. Pappenheim, the director of these kindergartens during their existence, sees in 
this decrease a symptom of success. He ascribes it to the establishment of kinder- 
gartens by local associations, by schools, by enterprising kindergartners, and by 
families, who unite for the purpose of maintaining a ‘family kindergarten” for 
their own children. However, a second Volkskindergarten was opened in 1889. 
In 1890 the municipal authorities granted the society pecuniary assistance for the 
conduct of the two Volkskindergérten, on condition that provision be made for the 
children of needy parents. Consequently, while the society maintains the hours 
from 9 to 12 a. m. and 2 to 4 p. m. as the regular kindergarten hours, it admits 
children whose parents work away from home at 8 a. m., permits them to remain 
until 7 p. m., and gives them their meals for 10 pfennige (3 cents) a day. In order 
to meet these additional requirements the number of kindergartners employed has 
been increased. e 
A second enterprise of the Froebelverein is the training school for kindergartners 
under the direction of Inspector H. Reinecke. The course lasts one year. It com- 
prises pedagogics (general and Froebelian), kindergarten occupations and games, 
natural history, hygiene and calisthenics, singing, rudiments of geometry, and 
methods of elementary teaching. The hours of instruction (twenty per week) are 
in the afternoon. On three forenoons each week each student is assigned to a kin- 
dergarten, where she observes the work and assists according to directions from the 
regular teachers. Students must be at least 16 years old and must have a fair school © 
education, more especially in the knowledge of German language and literature, 
in the history of Germany, and insinging. Students pay an entrance fee of 5 marks, 
and thereafter 27 marks quarterly for full work. Since 1888 the school admits to its

lessons young women who do not care to become kindergartners, but who, for their 
own fuller education, desire to acquaint themselves with Froebel’s'principles and 
practice. 
The third institution established and maintained by the association is the Kinder- 
phlegerinnen-Schule (school for the training of children’s maids and nurses). This 
school also is under the direction of Dr. Pappenheim. Its object is, in the words of 
Froebel, ‘‘to train young girls so that they may afford the housewife needed help in 
her domestic duties and relieve the mother. by assuming the nurture and education 
of the little children.” This school was first established in 1864 as a Sunday school, 
in which ladies of the Froebel Association taught gratuitously. 
In 1868 the association found an energetic colaborer in Director Zelle, of the 
municipal orphan department. A regular school was organized with a six months’ 
course. During three hours (2 to 5 o’clock) in the afternoons the pupils were 
instructed in the use of the gifts and occupations—including peas work and clay 
modeling, in the rudiments of educational science, and in the manual arts of the 
home. During the forenoons they assisted, under suitable direction, in the Munici- 
pal Orphans’ Home in housework and in the care of little children, or they were sent 
for similar work to some Volkskindergarten. At the same time they were permitted 
to visit the ‘créche” of Dr. Albu and the children’s hospital, where they might 
learn to nurse sick children. 
In 1869 the municipal orphans’ department established an independent school of 
this character for orphan girls, and the association continued the general work alone. 
Gradually the course was extended to one year and the curriculum was correspond- 
ingly enlarged by additional instruction—the Froebel occupations, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and in‘the use of the sewing machine. The number of weekly hours of 
instruction rose from twenty to twenty-two. € 
In 1889 the school had 53 pupils, and its list of graduates had risen to 600. Pupils 
pay an annual fee of 36 marks and 6 marks for material used in instruction and prac- 
tice. Onthe other hand the wages of such girls, which in 1868 varied between 80 
and 120 marks annually, had risen to a minimum of 135 marks and a maximum of 
180 marks annually. 
Fichte-Kindergarten.—A typical history, which reveals much of the character- 
istic tendencies of the German mind with reference to this movement, is that of 
the Fichte-Kindergarten. Its foundation was determined upon by the district 
association ‘‘Moritzplatz” as a suitable testimonial of devotion to Fichte, the great 
regenerator of German popular education, on the oecasion of the celebration of his 
one hundredth anniversary in the spring of 1862. On the 3d day of November of 
the same year it was opened with 3 children; in May of the following spring the 
number had risen to 50. The monthly fee of 13 marks was, however, too high for 
- the children of the working people; hence the fee was put on a sliding scale in ac- 
cordance with the means of the parents, and children were received for both fore- 
_ hoon and afternoon sessions. At last in the spring of 1865 a special association, 
the Verein fiir den Fichte Kindergarten took charge of the institution and trans- 
formed it into a Volkskindergarten. In this form it has continued to this day 
through many vicissitudes of fortune, arising chiefly from the fact that for lack of 
means it has been compelled ‘‘to live” in rented quarters, which it was always diffi- 
cult to retain and a few times even difficult to secure. In 1881, externally the most 
prosperous year of the association, its membership had risen to 170, the number of 
registered pupils reaching the monthly average of 106. These were taught at an ex- 
pense of 3,060 marks. The monthly tuition fees (varying from one-fourth mark to 
44 marks per child) amounted to 1,327 marks for the year, so that the association had 
to make up a deficit of 1,733 marks. In 1889 the number of members was 137, the 
monthly average of registered children 72. They were taught at an expense of 3,030 
marks, The monthly tuition fees (varying from one-half mark to 3 marks per 
child) amounted to 1,040 marks for the year, so that a deficit of 1,990 marks had to 
be covered. Undoubtedly the decrease in attendance and membership is due here, 
too, to the foundation of additional kindergartens of all descriptions. 
Much opposition had to be overcome with reference to the curriculum. Invete- 
rate prejudice, nurtured by the school and by the day nursery or infant school on 
the English model, looked upon reading, writing, knitting, and other ‘useful” occu- 
pations as of chief value. All these, however, remained persistently excluded. At 
the same time the association spared no pains to show in its reports the superiority 
of Froebel’s plan. Thus we read in the report of 1867: 
“The school and the kindergarten have different tasks. The kindergarten should 
. hot anticipate the work of the school, but only by all-sided development of the child 
prepare the way. If in this direction we may express hope with reference to our 
institution, it would be that of being able in due time to give to our kindergarten 
that degree of inner and outer development that children might remain with us for 
a longer time than is now possible. Ata time when education knew no other means 
of early culture than those of the primary school, it was proper and necessary to   
       
-P-A-G-E-67

  place the lower limit of school age at 6 or 7 years. But now, since the genius 
of Froebel has found new ways, the friends of the kindergarten can not fail to see 
that possibly the means of Froebel might suffice for even a longer period; that the 
deferring of reading, writing, and arithmetic to a later period, when the child is 
steadier and stronger, would yield good results with less effort and more readily.” 
The report of 1869 discusses the question more at lengtle. This report recognizes 
the indispensable value of reading and writing, but does not grant the necessity of 
beginning with it at too early a period. It continues: ‘‘Have you never heard of 
efficient and great men who learned to read and write in their twentieth or thirtieth 
year? Are there not, indeed, nations who formerly accomplished much in commerce 
and manufactures, in art and science, in war and diplomacy, although but few could 
read und write? And are there not to-day thousands of men efficient in their voca- 
tions who know little of reading and writing or make scarcely any use of it? * * * 
Whence, then, comes the efiiciency of these, if it is not due to the arts of reading and 
writing? 
“This question is easi 
  y answered. Eye and ear, hand and foot, are the media 
through which man learns the most and many thingsmost thoroughly. Itis by seeing, 
hearing, and going himself, and above all, by doing, by producing himself, that man 
obtains his best knowledge and his best powers. You may tell a man ten times how 
@ wagon or a plow looks, and his knowledge is not half as satisfactory as when he 
sees these things once. He may many times read in a book how a seed is to be laid 
in the ground and carefully tended when it has sprouted, and he will not understand 
the matter half as well as when he does.it once himself. Self-doing is the best means 
for the culture of man. His understanding and his hand learn most by self-doing, 
and his industry, his conscientiousness, the knowledge of his own power, respect for 
the industry and property of others, self-control and persistence, cheerfulness of dis- 
position are not by anything so well cultivated as by self-activity. 
“Everyone admits that this is true of grown people, but it is true in a still higher 
degree of the little children. The little child is, as it were, from the day of its 
birth, all eye and ear, hand and foot, full of inner unrest, and yearning for occupa- 
tion and activity. A self-active child is contented, is well behaved; a self-active 
child grows constantly in experience and knowledge, in skill and expertness, in dili- 
ence and perseverence; it is cheerful and without whims, sympathetic and help- 
ful; it is maturing internally, gradually but surely, and, what is most important, 
without precocity and presumption in thought, speech, and learning; finally noth- 
ing so keeps a child in bodily health and mental vigor as does varied creative actiy- 
ity. 
ce # * Yes, you say, but how about reading and writing? Writing? The 
child must learn to walk before it can skip and run; similarly, it must first learn to 
draw and then to write, for writing is only a particular sort of drawing. And read- 
ing? Why, indeed, should a child learn by reading how a house, a right angle, a 
~ horse, a plow looks, what the farmer and miller do, how the bee and the dove saved 
one another’s life, or about Snow-White and Red-Riding-Hood? Why not rather 
hear about these things, and, so far as feasible, see and do and represent these 
things? Will not these things be to him in these ways clearer, more living, and 
more impressive than reading about them could make them?” . 
The efforts of these associations to instruct the public concerning the meaning 
and value of the kindergarten and to obtain the active codéperation of the home in 
their work are unceasing. These efforts are quite instructive to us who are so prone 
to delegate all these things to ill-chosen boards of education; they explain much of 
the superiority of German and Swiss kindergarten instruction over what goes by 
the same name in France and even in Belgium. 
By way of illustration an additional extract is here added ‘from a public address 
by Dr. Ritter, printed in the society’s report for 1888: 
“The kindergarten would not intrust to mere chance the preservation of the 
natural vigor of children during the three years when they are largely left to 
themselves awaiting school age, but it affords thoughtful and systematic means to 
aid in the preservation of the child’s health and,.if need be, to restore it; at the 
same time it nurses the hope that its principles and methods may find introduction 
into the family, so that their salutary ipfluence may continue to be applied in the 
home.” The address then continues to contrast the aimless and inconsistent home 
treatment of exclusive home education with the thoughtful and methodical proced- 
ure of the kindergarten; shows that far from depriving the mother of a portion of 
her educational mission it instructs and encourages her in its fulfillment; far from 
entailing estrangement between mother and child, if intensifies their mutual instine- 
tive love by adding to this a mutual intelligent appreciation; far from depriving 
the child of its only period of full liberty it preserves this from degenerating into 
lawless license, which is the very worst slavery. 
The address then points out its value in social education: ‘In the kindergarten 
children find companions of their own age, whom they instinctively seek. Many of   
   
-P-A-G-E-68

these have already learned to obey the kindergartner with alacrity, and thus the 
newcomers soon are lifted into a degree of docility to which at home they were 
strangers. It is a common observation in the kindergarten that without artifivial 
straining it converts even excessively turbulent and self-willed children in a short’ 
time to natural childlike vivacity and adaptability, and removes apathy as by magic. 
“Thus the kindergarten becomes, indeed, a garden where the children are not 
merely kept, but, like tender plants, by an intelligent gardener, are carefully nurtured 
by intelligent and devoted love. In the kindergarten.the child’s instinct of activity 
is lifted without forcing into an eager desire for purposeful occupation. Clay-model- 
ing, weaving, building with blocks and sticks, trains and exercises the muscles of 
the hand, and, inasmuch as each occupation lasts for only a short time, the eyes are 
not strained but themselves suitably trained, and song, which adds to the children’s 
joy and cheerfulness, affords at the same time an exercise for the ear and deyelop- 
ment for the lungs. ‘ 
“ However, the kindergarten aims with these games and occupations at hygienic 
advantages of a still different sort. Froebel has shown that the child will learn 
most thoroughly the things that most enlist his interest and excite his curiosity. 
Now these things are not accomplished, as has been thought heretofore, by the mere 
showing of things on the part of adults and mere observation on the part of the 
children, but rather by permitting them to represent and to make things themselves. 
Thus, the child learns much about a bird by embroidering its outline or by drawing 
it on his slate, and without formal or forced instruction. Similarly, the child in 
building with its blocks tables and chairs learns from the occasional directions and 
remarks of the kindergartner the significance of right and left, of corner, face, and 
edge. In stick laying and weaving the child becomes familiar with numbers with- 
out formal instruction in arithmetic; and ina similar fashion it learns to distinguish 
plants, animals, and stones without formal lessons in natural history.” 
Such efforts on the part of the people to supply deficiencies in governmental 
work in matters of education can not fail in due time to lead the nation to higher 
intelligence, deeper morality, and fuller liberty. 
Pestalozzi-Froebel Haus—The efforts to realize Froebel’s ideals which have been so 
far described, with the exception of those made in German-Switzerland, have a more 
or less obyious leaning towards the ways of the school. It remains for us now to 
give an account of a brilliant experiment to render the spirit and ways of the family 
supreme in the work of the kindergarten. Possibly the desire to correct an unques- 
tionable abuse renders the eminent experimenter extreme in the opposite direction; 
possibly she thinks it desirable to do this in order to enable others to find some true 
golden medium. 
The experiment referred to is made again at Berlin, and the eminent leader of the 
work is Madame Henrietta Schrader, née Breymann. Madame Schrader is a direct 
pupil of Froebel. Up to her marriage she conducted a well-known girls’ school and 
kindergarten at Wolfenbiittel. In 1871 her husband’s business made it necessary 
that they should take up their home in Berlin. Here she took at once a deep and 
active interest in the kindergartens, more particularly in the Volkskindergarten of 
the district in which she lived. This institution was at the time in a dormant con- 
dition. ‘Through her efforts the association that had conducted it was reorganized, 
grew in interest, numbers, and activity, and soon entered enthusiastically into her 
plans. It assumed the name “ Association for the advancement of Volkskindergdrten 
and Volkserzichung of the southwestern Friedrichstadt” (the name of the district). 
She called to her aid a gifted friend and pupil of hers, Miss Annette Schepel, who 
took charge of the kindergarten; she herself opened a course of lectures which, in 
the course of time, developed into a training school for kindergartners and chil- 
drens’ nurses, and added from time to time other valuable features to the work of 
the association. In 1880 afew wealthy members of the association bought the house 
16 Steinmetz-Strasse, which to-day is the Pestalozzi-Froebel House, and harbors the 
philanthropic longings of its founder. 
This institution comprises at present the following departments: 
(1) The Volkskindergarten, with four sections. 
(2) A transition class. 
(3) A primary class. 
(4) A school for sewing and mending. 
(5) A bathing establishment for children. 
(6) A training school for kindergartners and nurses (Kinderpflegerinnen), 
(7) A home for friendless girls. 
(8) A cooking school. 
(9) A commission for the advancement of hygienic living among the poor. 
The Volkskindergarten is situated on the first floor of the building, in four depart- 
ments of not more than twenty children each. This limited number of children 
affords ample opportunity for individual treatment of the children and for the main- 
tenance of the “family spirit,” which is a characteristic of the work of this institu-

tion. Each division is in charge of a competent pean baee who is variously 
aided by visiting members of the training school connected with the institution, A 
Sue tee detailed account of the work in the Volkskindergarten will be found in the 
appendix. 
pres the kindergarten the children pass in their sixth year of age to the transi- 
tion class, and from this to an elementary or primary class. In these classes the 
children are gradually introduced into the aims and ways of the school. 
Much stress is laid upon the various needs and arts of home industry. The chil- 
dren assist in the cleaning of the rooms, the washing of windows and doors, the care 
of the house plants. They scrub the little wooden boards on which their luncheon 
is served, and do all kinds of domestic chores. The girls busy themselves with the 
laundry of their dolls; the boys repair paper hangings, pictures, and broken play- 
things. 
Even after their transfer to the regular school the children return to the Pesta- 
lozzi-Froebel House during certain afternoons of the week. On these occasions the 
girls are taight mending, darning, and plain sewing; the boys learn to weave ru, 
from straw or rags, to make baskets, to do all kinds of cardboard work, and to 
handle the carpenter’s tools. 
The school for the training of kindergartners consists of two departments. 
The students of the first department must have passed through a secondary school 
for girls and possess good health. They pay an entrance fee of 3 marks, and 25 
marks quarterly (foreign students pay a quarterly fee of 75 marks). The subjects. 
of instructions are hygiene, pedagogics, history of education, kindergarten theory 
and practice, natural history, rudiments of geometry, German, drawing, singing, 
calisthenics, the arts of housework and home gardening, observation and practice 
in the schools of the institution. 
The course lasts from one to two years, according to the state of progress of the 
respective students; and graduates, according to age and culture, are supposed to be 
fitted for educational work in homes and kindergartens. 
The students of the second department must have a fair common-school education 
and be in good health. They pay an entrance fee of 3 marks and a quarterly fee 
of 15 marks. Their course of instruction is on the same general lines as that of the 
first department, but much more limited. It lasts from one to two years and fits its 
graduates to become assistants in kindergartens and in home education. 
Of late a third department has been added for persons who have passed through a 
course of normal kindergarten training and who desire to fit themselves for teach- 
ing in training schools. This course lasts from six to twelve months and requires a 
fee of 60 marks for six months or of 100 marks for the year. 
In 1889 the training school had fifty-five students. Of these thirty-six were in the 
first and nineteen in the second department. Financially, the institution seems to 
be ina fair way of becoming self-supporting. With an annual expenditure in 1889 
of nearly 35,000 marks, its deficit to be covered from existing funds amounted to not 
quite 4,000 marks. 
Other instructive details of this remarkable institution will be found in the 
appendix, 
* APPENDIX A. 
The following notes were sent me by Froebel’s widow, Madame Louise Froebel, 
who resides at Hamburg: 
On the 28th day of June, 1840, Froebel celebrated at Blankenburg, in Thuringia, the inauguration of 
an institution for the cultivation of children; a German lideeeace ay founded by women of Germany. 
After his inaugural address the children, who had been taught for some time by Frocbel, engaged in plays and occupations. Subsequently kindergartens were established in many places. Froebel in- structed the kindergartners and engaged much in missionary activity in order to prepare the ground for their work. 
Madame Doris Liitkens, at Hamburg, a generous friend of childhood, had been gained for this holy 
work by Froebel’s writings and established the first kindergarten at Hamburg in connection with her. 
private schoo! in 1848. In the following year two additional kindergartens were opened, and an asso- 
ciation of ladies induced Froebel to spend a winter at Hamburg in order to train kindergartners and 
to present his educational principles in public lectures. In May, 1850, the first Biirgerkindergarten (citizens’ kindergarten) was opened by Froebel. Soon two others followed. Froebel followed the 
mene of the work with great joy. During his sickness Middendorff came to him with reports from 
‘amburg which gave him much joy in his sufferings. After the death of Froebel and Middendorff I 
went first to Dresden, in order to serve the cause with all my strength. However, in consequence of 
the prohibition of kindergartens in Prussia, and a similar disposition at Dresden, I was not received 
with favor, and I found it difficult to obtain a permit of residence. In the fall of the same year (1854) 
afourth Biirgerkindergarten was to be opened at Hamburg, and I offered to assume its direction. 
‘The kindergarten kept me occupied for a few hours in the forenoon, so that during the afternoons I 
was at liberty to instruct a few girls, an opportunity which was embraced with alacrity by the kin- dergarten assistants. *    
-P-A-G-E-70
    118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
‘Two years later the executive board of the Biirgerkindgérten established a training school for kin- dergartners, in which I taught with a number of others. In the meanwhile a Froebel society had been formed, and. this society also established a training. school for kindergartners which was always well patronized; its graduates mostly took charge of children in families and did much to render these favorable to our work, In 1860 established a kindergarten for the children of the wealthicr classes, with which a few years later I combined a transition class in order to gratify the parents of my pupils. During the entire period I continued my efforts to train kindergartners. Among my students there were a few Russian ladies, and at their request I spert a few. montlis at St. Petersburg in order to aid in the establishment of the work in that city Ido not know how many children I instructed in tho course of years, but I have the great satisfac. tion of meeting many of my former pupils who are now citizens and parents active in tho service of whatever to thom is true, beantiful. and. good. In ny sixtieth year I was compelied by ill health to give up my own kindergarten, but was still able Guea nutiber of ence to work forthe Vollahinderparted’ aiid Toxthe training school: “At presani-the excitement and noise of large assemblies is too severe for me, yet I have the good fortune of meeting little ones in families and of being grected by them with manifestations of cordial affection. If now we ask what success has crowned the labor of the past fifty years, the answer, through God’s grace, indicates remarkable growth, increasing from year to year. ‘The tender tree planted in 1840-had to bear many storms and other hindrances, but has always been strengthened by these things. The educational principles of Frochel have taken root in the families; many unconscionsly follow his guid- anee, and very many heed his instructions with intelligent appreciation of their value. The efforts to establish homes of refuge for boys and girls area necessary consequence of our endeavors ; indeed, they existed in their rudiments in Froebel’s institute. 
11 as in the light of past experience we have a right to hope, the spirit of love, of industry, and of generous creative work will become more and more general, Frocbel’s desire to bring to mankind peace, joy, and freedom will be fulfilled. 
            APPENDIX B. 
The following notes avere sent me by Heinrich Hoffmann, a direct pupil of Froebel, 
now residing at Hamburg: 
In 1848 an article written by Mme. Doris Liitkens directed my attention to Frochel and the kindergar- ten. I paid a visit to the kindergarten established by this lady at Hamburg. Following her advice L applied to Frochel. He received me at once as one of his pupils, and in the fall of 1848 I went to Dres- _ den to receive his personal istruction, ‘This was a great event for me. Henceforth my whole life was devoted to childhood as a whole. The mighty enthusiasm, the wealth of thought amazed his 
hearers, although he seemed to labor to find the right expressions for his revelations. Never again have I found so indefatigable a worker. From 9 o'clock in the morning until 10 at night he taught the Yyarious sections of the school and limited the time for his personal wants toa minimum. At 10 o'clock, when the weather was favorable, he loved to invite us for awalk. ‘These were precious hours. * * ‘When afterwards we had retired to rest, our master worked until 3or4‘o’clock, and worked and studied about new forms and arrangements, songs and games, and whatever else might enrich the children’s mind and heart or enhance their vigor. In the spring of 1849 the work at Dresden came to a close. On the 4th of July of the same year, 
Lopened the second kindergarten at Hamburg, and, at the invitation of several ladies, Froebel came in the fall of that year to Hamburg, in order to conduct a six month’scourse. Many Mifiuential men and women of advanced culture were gained for the cause, and when Middendoff, with his wonder!ul 
power of speech, had kindled the fire of enthusiasm in every heart, a brilliant success seemed assured. Although much disappointment and sorrow camo to the venerable master, he had nevertheless the satisfaction of witnessing the opening of a Burgertindergarten, to which subsequently many others were added. My efforts were directed to the educational needs of the frmily, on tho one hand the kindergarten, on the other hand the training of girls for the work of education, "At first instructed young girls for two hours daily in order to prepare them for the requirements of the nursery. As this was a gratui- tous work, I secured in ashort time 40 pupils. ‘To me personally this afforded valuable practice in the art of presenting even highest educational traths in a simple and intelligible mamner, even to persons Little killed in thought, “Unfortunately aserioua interruption intervened in this.. *The kindergartens were prohibited in Prussia, and, not beinga citizen of Hamburg, I was consequently compelled to leave the city. For a year I went as a peripatetic teacher from town to town in Hanover: Hanover, Hildes- heim, Hize, Gronau, Goettingen, then Bremen and Oldenburg. In all of these I delivered courses of lectures in'which I’ presented the method of Frocbel, established kindergartens, instructed young girls in the work, and labored to mect the accusations and misunderstandings that beset the cause. In 1854 Prince Albert opened a universal educational exposition in St. Martin’s Hal), London. A request to take part in this induced me to venture upon the journey well provided with material kindergarten work and means for illustration. I was assigned & prominent place and could display my things to advantage. The success was greater than Lhad anticipated.

Ihad intended to return after the close of the exposition, but Lord Shaftesbury. Kinnaird, Dr. Playfair, and others induced me to remain.

The interest grew steadily. * *"* Iremained in London for seventeen years, but in 1871 I returned home. At first I established myself as teacher of English at Altona, bud soon I gave my energies wholly again to the work nearest my heart. Since 1878 I have conducted six monih’s courses in which young girls are trained for the educational requirements of the nursery, as well as a flourishing kindergarten. _A few years ago I was requested by Joseph Hughes to write a biography of Froebel for his “Prac- tical Teacher.” ‘This I did, and he published iny manuscript in the years 1883 and 1834,

APPENDIX ©. 
THE MONTHLY SUBJECT IN THE KINDERGARTEN, 
Madame Henriette Schrader, the genial’ founder of the Pestalozzi-Froebel House 
at Berlin, makes much of what she calls the Monatsgegenstand (monthly subject or 
subject forthe month) in the kindergarten. In one of her reports (1890) she fur- 
nishes an instructive illustration of this. The subject chosen is the pine tree. 
For the smallest children of the kindergarten it furnishes material for play. The 
kindergartner on the first morning brings to the little ones—3 to 44 years old—a 
covered basket filled with pine sprays. After the children have examined them and 
admired them, they plant with their aid and some sand a pine forest. This is filled 
with animals from ‘‘ Noah’s ark.” The kindergartner rapidly fashions from wax a 
squirrel which visits all the children and leaps nimbly from tree to tree. Suddenly 
it begins to snow, small pieces of white paper fall upon the trees, the squirrel 
hidés himseif in one of the trees, and the animals, too, seek suitable shelter. The 
children sing a suitable song. 
On another day the kindergartner brings pine cones for the play. Some of the 
children fill the scales with sand and stick small leaves and flowers into this. The 
cone is smoothed off on one side with a knife, and the charming bouquet is pre- 
sented to one of the assistants. The other children transform pine cones into horses 
and cows and build astable for them from blocks, or manufacture wagons, to which 
the horses are hitched. The children express themselves freely’and during the 
play learn many things about the pine tree and its uses. 
The second division—44 to 5} years old—had planted small pine trees last spring, 
and these have been carefully nursed by the children. In the month of December 
these pine trees and whatever else the children may have seen and heard about 
pine trees, become the subject of earnest and frequent instructive conversations, and 
the central figure of songs and games. Pine trees and pine cones are drawn with 
the help of stencils and suitably colored. Pine cones are adorned for the Christ- 
mas tree, and fashioned from clay, and all culminates in the story of the Christ- 
child and conversations on the significance of Christmas. 
In the transition class children 5} to 6 years old learn to express their expe- 
rience and knowledge in regular correct sentences. Thus, after a visit to the 
potanical gardens, they are led to say: “The pine tree is dressed in green. The 
leaves of the pine tree are called needles. The pine tree stands quite straight. 
The pine cones are brown. In the pine tree there dre many small tents. In these 
tents the seeds are sheltered, etc.” In the occupations, too, connected with the 
subject everything is done more systematically than in the kindergarten proper. 
Bertha-Meyer, author of “From the Cradle to the School,” gives a full sketch of 
a day in this institution. We take the following notes from this: At 9 o’clock all . 
the children of the kindergarten assemble in the large play room. The kindergar- 
ten designates two children from each division, who, while the rest are engaged in 
their movement games, arrange the occupation material in the respective division 
rooms. These children hold the office for a week. After the games comes roll call, 
and at 9:30 each kindergartner marches her division into the music room, where 
transition class and primary class assemble at the same time. Here all sing a sim- 
ple morning prayer. Only the smallest children, 2} to 4 years old, are excluded 
from this and remain in the play room. Thereupon all children return to their 
respective occupation rooms and the day’s work begins. 
The division of the smallest children, too, had its two arrangers. Let us stop 
with these at first. We notice that the playthings of the nursery are not banished 
from their room. We see here dolls, dolls’ beds and carriages, cooking utensils, a 
Noah’s ark, hollow forms for the sand game, arailroad, and many otherthings. Fre- 
quently they may use these things as they please, yet at other times much is pru- 
dently withheld. One of their regular occupations is stringing of beads. During 
this time they are told a story or sing a song, or give vent to their own fancies in ~ 
free conversation. Hero a bead strung on a thread plays varied parts. Now it isa 
bell, swinging to and fro, now a locomotive puffing noisily away. The various col- 
ors of the beads enable the children to discover many instructive distinctions among 
them. Thus they vary song and work until the time is past. Another favorite oc- 
cupation is the sand game. The children fashion, with the help of their hollow sand 
forms or suitable kitchen utensils, a variety of things from moist sand, cooking 
ranges, all sorts of cakes and pastry, or they make little gardens, which they adorn 
with real flowers or pine sprays, or with paper trees and birds which the upper di- 
visions have made for them. Another occupation is the drawing out of threads 
from coarse woolen rags. These threads they tie into dolls, little birds, or mice, or 
they make brooms with them, or lay them loosely into a small basket or clay saucer
-P-A-G-E-72
    720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
to represent the nest of birds or mice, or they manufacture them into small beds for 
dolls cut from paper or wood. 
. However, after the very first occupation the signal for luncheon is given. The 
children march again to the large play room. Inthe meanwhile the two little help- 
- ers place at each seat a small round piece of board upon the table, and on each of 
these boards a small slice of bread and butter is laid and cut into small pieces. When 
all preparations are made the children march back to luncheon amid suitable calis- 
thenic exercises. After breakfast the children again repair to the play room, while 
the little helpers clear the tables and prepare for the new occupation. 
This lasts until 11.45, when the children are dismissed to their homes, with the 
exception of those whose mothers work away from their homes, who receive their 
dinner at the kindergarten. These remain under supervision during the entire noon- 
recess, and should. they feel tired they take a nap on mattresses provided for this 
purpose. The afternoon session lasts from 2 to 4 o’clock and is spent chiefly in free 
play or movement games. 
Let us turn to the other divisions. In the Froebel occupations the children are 
notallowed to do as much asin other kindergartens. The more difficult and deli- 
cate work is reserved for the transition class and the primary class, when they do 
not strain the nerves and eyes excessively. Geometrical terms, too, are avoided in 
the kindergarten and are consigned to the advanced classes, The squares on the 
network are called boxes; the vertical and horizontal lines in drawing have various 
names, as remote resemblance or fancy may dictate, such as soldiers, handkerchiefs, 
ete. 
Much stress is laid on intelligent intercourse with nature and on the activities of 
daily domestic life. Subjects forinstruction are chosen chiefly from nature and in 
accordance with theseasons. Thus, in March, the lessons and plays dealt with pease, 
lentils, and beans; in April, with violets and spring beauties; in May, with some 
prominent May-blossoms and the bird-tree; in June, with grass and cereals; in July, 
with chickens; in August, with bees and butterflies; in September, with water; in 
October, with theapple tree and ivy; in November, with the mouse and baked apples; 
in December, with the pine tree; in January, with the joiner and what he makes 
from pine; in February, with the titmouse, etc., according to choice or opportunity. 
In the transition class the work in the Proebel occupations is gradually combined 
with the rudiments of school work. Instruction begins at 8.30. In writing they 
Jearn to make simple letters; in arithmetic they analyze numbers, with the help of 
sticks and lines, from 1 to 5; in German they learn to form simple sentences and to 
analyze them into words and these into syllables; in drawing they draw from sten- 
cils the outlines of right triangles, squares, etc., and fill these with lines; they learn 
to recognize angles and to draw them; in home geography they learn to know the 
cardinal points of the compass and the directions in which to find familiar buildings 
and localities; they observe the position of the sun and other similar facts. They 
measure the schoolroom and distances of objects from each other, and make a 
ground-plan of the house and its contents. They become familiar with native 
plants and animals. 
For religious instruction they are told the stories of the Old Testament, and shown 
pictures of incidents connected with the stories. In music they learn to recognize 
and keep time with the aid of ‘orchestral performances” on triangles, castanets, 
tambourines, and trumpets. In the primary class these things are done more and 
more fully in the ways of the school.

SCHOOLS. 
A.—KINDERGARTENS. 
(1) The purpose of the kindergarten is to aid and supplement horie education during the earlier years of childhood, and, consequently, to prepare the children for public school education ( Volks-schul- unterricht) by systematic training of the body and of the senses, as well as by appropriate culture of the intellect. (2) Tho means of kindergarten education are to be found in occupations which develop the creative and férmative instincts, in movement games with or without singing, in conversations about things and pictures, little stories and poems, and light garden work. Ali instruction peculiar to the'school is strictly excluded. : (8) Children may not be admitted to the kindergarten before they have entered on their fourth year, and they must be discharged therefrom, in accordance with the imperial school law of 1879, at. the close of their sixth. Within these limits they may be received or discharged at any time, as their parents or guardians may desire. Children troubled with afilictions that are fraught with danger to Other children shall not be received in kindergartens.

The establishment of such institutions requires the approval of the provincial school authorities. 
Kindergartensestablised by provinces, school districts, and municipalities are public kindergartens; 
those established by associations and private individaals are private kindergartens. (5) The kindergarten may exist alone or in connection with a public school (Yolksschule). It ocen- pies the children daily, except on Sundays and holidays, for two or three hours in the forenoon and two 
hours in the afternoon. Arrangements, however, may be made to receive children for the remainder 
of the day for supervision and board. (6) The number of children in the care of one person shall not exceed 40. 
(7) ‘The rooms destined for kindergartens must be safe and easy of access; must have a perfectly 
healthy location, good light, and ample opportunities for the unhindered movements of the children. In addition to suitable rooms, there must be a sufliciently large, cheerful, and adequately sheltered space for play and movement in the open air. Exceptions may be made only in large cities and in private kindergartens. (8) ‘The kindergarten must be provided with the necessary apparatus for occupations and instruc- tion, the requisite number of seats and benches, tables ruled with networks, and suitable arrange- 
ments for the bodily needs of tho children. : (9) Every kindergarten must be conducted in accordance with regulations and a time-table adapted to local needs. 
(10) The founder is responsible for the external condition, the director (or directress) for the peda- 
gogical guidance of the kindergarten, i 
(il) The direction of a kindergarten connected with the Volksschule shall be in the hands of the 
director of the school. The directors (directresses) of independent kindergartens must enjoy a good moral character, must be 24 years old, in possession of the certificate of graduation from general com- 
mon schools, and must show that they have familiarized themselves with the nature of kindergarten 
education by attendance (as observers) for at least three months in a good kindergarten. Only in 
cases where other proof of the requisite pedagogic attainments can be furnished, the minister of public instruction may dispense the candidate from the certificate of graduation. 
(12) The practical training in the kindergarten, and the intercourse with the children, are to be placed 
in the hands of kindergartners which can furnish the required proofs of competence for this work (§§ 
20-23). ‘Lhe directress, if she furnishes proof of possessing the required competence, may also be kinder- 
partner. 8813) Any vigorous and intellectually normal person of unquestioned morality may be attendant (Warterin\ in the kindergarten. 
(14) The engagement of the director (directress), of the kindergartners, and attendants is to be mado by the founder on approval of the district school board. ‘The founder will also determine the extent 
of the fee to be paid for attendance at the kindergarten. 
(15) The district school board shall be informed of all contemplated changes in the management 
or conduct, as well as in the location, of the kindergarten. 
(16) The public shall be permitted at all times to visit the kindergarten, provided previous notice 
is given of such visit. * (17) 'The kindergartens are under the supervision of the regular school authorities. ‘The pedagogic supervision is within the duties of the imperial district school-inspector. In othe: matters the public 
kindergartens are under the supervision of the local authorities, the pr! © kindergartens under the

from time to time, and report to the local authorities the needs of the same. 
(18) Kindergartens which fail to observe these regulations or show defects that preyent the attain- 
ment of their legitimate parpcee, shall be closed by the provincial school authorities. 
(19) For the training of kindergartners, in so far as this is not done by public normal schools for female teachers, special courses shall be established in some of the schools. = 
(20) Certificates of graduation, showing that the candidate possesses satisfactory theoretical and practical knowledge of the kindergarten, entitle the holder to become a kindergartner, 
(21) Besides these special courses in public normal schools for female teachers, training courses may also be combined with well-conducted Banlic and private kindergartens, with the consent of the min- 
ister of education. Such schools may be granted by the minister the privilege of issuing certificates that shall be valid throughout the state on condition that the curriculum shall not differ essentially 
from that of public normal schools, that the teachers be approved by the provisional school board, and 
that the final examination be conducted by a member of this board, whose consent shall be necessary 
for the granting of a certificate. a 
(22) Girls in the higher classes of public schools (Volks- und Biirgerschulen) shall*be permitted to take part in divisions in the games and occupations of the kindergarten whenever this is feasible. 
Besides, the directors of kindergartens may instruct girls, that have satisfied the provisions of the 
school laws, in the science and art of natural child culture, and issue to them certificates of success. 
(23) Day nurseries.—The object of the day nursery is to receive children of working people for daily care and suitable occupation, and to accustom them to cleanliness, orderliness, and good behavior, as 
well as to instill into them love of work. 
These institutions shall not receive children under 3 years of age. 
‘The establishment of a day nursery requires the approval of the provincial school board, which may ‘0 fix the conditions of such approval. ‘he supervision of day nurseries is under the same regulations as the supervision of kindergartens. 
Special care is to be taken to see that all arrangements satisfy the modern pedagogic and sanitary re- quirements, and that all school instruction be excluded. 
     
    
       
IV.—FRANCE. : ‘ 
France claims as the first germ of her interest in the systematic education of in- 
fants in public institutions the remarkable philanthropy of Oberlin. John Fred- 
eric Oberlin was born at Strasburg in 1740. In 1767 he assumed the pastorate of 
Waldersbach in the Ban-de-la-Roche (Steinthal), a rocky and sterile valley in the 
Vosges Mountains of Alsace. ‘ 
He found his people in a condition of utter wretchedness, which he attributed to 
their dense ignorance. In his efforts to alleviate this wretchedness he sought, there- 
ED 9k 46  
-P-A-G-E-74
    722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
fore, to dissipate the prevailing ignorance by teaching the peasants better agricul- 
tural and horticultural methods, the establishment of new industrial pursuits and of 
commercial relations with neighboring parishes, the art of building roads and bridges. 
At the same time, he‘realized that his most important concern was the education of 
the children of his parish. After two years of earnest striving he succeeded in giv- 
ing to his people a schoolbouse. This success he followed up by securing the con- 
struction of similar houses in several adjoining villages. 
However, these schools brought no relief to children under 6 years of age, who 
were sadly in need of care. The mothers, compelled to labor in the fields, left them 
at home where they were either without supervision or in the doubtful care of older 
oe or sisters who thus were themselves deprived of the benefits of the town 
school. 
At this juncture Oberlin learned that in a neighboring village there was one Sarah 
Banzet who tanght the children of the place the art of knitting. He hastened to en- 
gage her to teach the children of Waldersbach in some spacious rooms which he had 
rented for this purpose. Here, we are told by Legrand, he wished the children might 
find motherly guidance. The smallest played, the larger ones learned to spin, to 
knit, to sew. Colored pictures of scriptural subjects and of natural history furnished 
means for pleasing instruction. 
The work was enlivened by song, and simple stories were told. In summer they 
gathered flowers, learned the names of plants, as well as their peculiarities and uses. 
Oberlin’s wife, Salome Witter, and his servant, Louise Schoeppler, aided in this 
work of love; and after the death of Sarah Banzet, which occurred a few years 
later, Louise Schoeppler continued the work for over fifty years. 
In 1794 the national convention of France eulogized the efforts of Oberlin in a 
public decree; and his “knitting-schools” began to attract favorable public atten- 
tion and found a number of imitators, who, however, succeeded poorly, possibly be- 
cause they failed to bring to the work the spirit of pure, unselfish devotion that 
characterized the efforts of Oberlin. 
Another notable attempt in.a similar direction was that of Madame de Fastouret, 
who, in 1801, established in Paris a salle Whospitalité, a sort of day nursery, for a 
limited number—10 or 12—little girls. Her enterprise failed in spite of the ample 
means which she devoted to it. M. Durand! ascribes this failure chiefly to the fact 
that her work was more religious than philanthropic, for she helped only those who 
were remarkable for piety, and the exercises of the school were chiefly of a religious 
character. 
It seems, however, that her failure did not discourage her, for in 1826 we find her 
at the head of.a:committee of ladies engaged in similar efforts, although of a broader, 
less narrowly ecclesiastical character. In these she was joined by the excellent M. 
Cochin, mayor of the twelfth district of Paris, and by Abbé Desgenettes. Funds 
were collected, the general council of charities was prevailed upon to contribute 
3,000 francs, and to furnish a suitable room for anew institution fer the care and 
education of neglected children. 
In order to defeat open and concealed opposition, it was decided that Madame 
Millet, enthusiastically devoted to these plans, should go to England in order to 
study the methods by which Buchanan, Wilderspin, and their followers had attained 
their marvelous results, She undertook the journey in 1827, and was soon joined by 
M. Cochin himself, who was eager to leave nothing undone that might contribute to 
the success of the noble work of charity and edncation, from which he expected so 
much for the wretched poor of the twelfth district. 
On his return, in 1828, M. Cochin established a model salle @asile (house of refuge) 
or infant school after the English pattern, ant, in connection with it, a normal 
course for the training of teachers under the direction of Madame Millet. 
From this time on success seems to have been assured. In Paris alone there were 
in 1830 six such schools, and in 1836 their number had risen to eighty. Other cities 
were equally active, so that in 1837 Salvandy could report to the King that 800 such 
cools were open in France, and that 261 of these were supported partly by public 
‘unds. 
In the meanwhile, however, and in the measure in which municipalities began to 
interest themselves in these institutions, their educational valne became more and 
more prominent, and their charitable features lost in importance. At the same time 
there arose conflicts of authority between the municipal administration and the 
committee of ladies, who struggled to retain control at least-of the supervision of 
the salles Wasile. These-conflicts resulted in the defeat of the committee of ladies, 
who resigned their functions near the close of 1836. 
In his report to the King, dated on the 22d of December, 1837, M. Salvandy, the 
minister of public instruction, deplores this. He feels that the success of these insti- 
tutions can not be assured unless the daily inspection of the schools as well as the 
examination and supervision of the teachers, is in the hands of mothers. Deeply   
1 La Législation des Keoles Maternelles. Paris, 1883.  
-P-A-G-E-75
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 723 
impressed, at the same time, with the usefulness of the salles d’asile, he urges the 
King to give them a legal existence, and to secure for them the maternal inspection 
and control so necessary to their success. € 
This request was answered by a royal decree bearing the same date, in which for 
the first time the salles @asile are assigned a place in the public education of the 
state. They are declared to be “charitable institutions to which children of both 
sexes may be admitted up to the age of 6 years (the seventh birthday) in order to 
receive the motherly supervision and first education which their age requires.” 
Here they were to receive “the first principles of religious instruction and element- 
ary notions of reading, writing, and oral arithmetic, to which may be added instruc- 
tive and moral songs, needlework, and all kinds of manual worl.” 
Tho regular visitation and daily inspection of these schools, in so far as they were 
public institutions, were placed in the hands of ladies. Each school was to have 
one inspectress, who, however, might select deputies to aid her. These were to 
supervise “the conduct of the salles Vasile in all that touches the children’s health, 
their moral disposition, their religious education, and the treatment they receive.” 
At their request the license to teach is withdrawn from any attendant “whose hab- 
its, conduct, and character are not in conformity with the spirit of the institution.” 
The inspectresses render to the proper authorities quarterly reports of the status and 
needs of the work. If they see fit they may take part in the discussion of these re- 
ports. Departments and communes are empowered to appoint permanent inspec- 
tresses, and the minister of public instruction appoints a permanent inspectress as a 
member of the supreme educational commission of the state. - 
The reason for stating here at such length the provisions of this decree lies in the 
fact stated by Mlle. Matrat' that “allsubsequent decrees and orders merely modify, 
restate, complete, or sanction the decree of December 22.” 
The regulations concerning the details of work in salles dasile were based wholly 
on a manual published by M. Cochin in 1833. They bear the stamp of their English ~ 
origin, and are distressingly schoolish. In the decree of the central authority pub- 
lished on the 24th of April, 1838, it is ordered that the rooms in which the children 
are to be exercised should be situated on the ground floor. The floor itself is to be 
covered with planks, tiles, asphaltum, or cement. The rooms are to be lighted from 
both sides by windows placed at least 2 meters above the floor, ‘‘so that the chil- 
dren’s attention may not be disturbed by outdoor attractions.” 
The rooms are to be of a rectangular shape, 4 by 10 meters for 50 children, 6 by 12 
meters for 100 children, 16 by 20 meters, 200 or 250 children. The last number is 
fixed at the maximum. The children are seated at one end of the room in at least 
five nor more than ten rows, on terraced seats extending across the entire width of 
the room. However, passages are left down the middle of the terraces, or amphi- 
theater, and on the sides for the purposes of classification, and the better control of 
the chitdren. A general view of such an estrade is given in Fig.1 and sectional 
view in Fig. 2. 
            
  
  
  Fic.1.—View of an-estrade. 
The rest of the room is provided with benches fastened to the floor, leaving, how- 
ever, an empty space in the middle for evolutions. In front of the benches, in the 
play room, circles are painted on the floor indicating the places where groups of chil- 
dren are to stand before suspended pictures and charts used in the work. Similar 
charts are hung on the walls of the room. Indced, M. Cochin recommends that the 
1! Histoire de Education Enfantine Publique. Par Mlle. Matrat.

  724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
“seript letters and ciphers, as well as a number of geometrical figures, be painted on 
the walls, so that they may be continually before the children’s eyes for imitation.” 
The subjoined cut which, together with Figs.1 and 2,is taken from M. Narjoux’s 
Ecoles Primaires et Salles @Asile gives a very fair idea of the interior arrangement 
of a salle Wasile. 
A courtyard is provided, at least three times the size of the work room (salle 
Wexercices) just described, partly covered and partly open. [At a later period this 
was divided lengthwise into two halves, one for the boys and one for the girls.] In 
the courtyard various provisions are made for games, and the covered portions are 
furnished with movable benches. 
Wherever it is feasible there is also a room in which the children take their meals 
and keep warm in winter. This is suitably furnished with shelves for the children’s 
baskets, with movable benches, porringers, and other utensils. 
The furniture for the work room proper, in addition to the things needed for the 
children’s toilet and other comfort, comprises a clock, a large bell conveniently hung, 
a claquoir,! a whistle for sounding signals for the various exercises, blackboards and 
charts, slates and pencils, an abacus with 10 rows of 10 balls each, one or several 
books and portfolios with pictures, and various provisions for needlework and other 
manual work, 
  1G. 2.—Sectional view. 
In each salle Vasile there is at least one teacher (swrveillante) and one woman for 
general service (femme “de service). Should the number of children exceed 100, a 
Jeast 2 assistants are given the teacher. 
Admission is granted to children from 2 to 6 years old. The schools are open every 
week day from 90’clock until sunset in winter, from 7 o’clock in the morning until 
_ 6 o’clock in the evening during the remainder of the year. 
In urgent cases children may have to be received before the stated hours and kept 
for a longer time and during the holidays. On the other hand the hours for actual 
teaching may not be more than four daily nor less than two, and no exercise is to last 
longer than ten or fifteen minutes. 
This is the substance of the official directions of 1838. There is in all of them 
unquestionably an oppressive air of schoolishness. This schoolishness gaye rise in 
due time to that ‘méthode des salles @asile’? in which Madame Kergomard sees 
“the absolute negation of Oberlin’s principles,” and the only truly redoubtable 
weapon at the disposal of opponents of schools fo. early childhood.? 
Nevertheless, these schools were the outcome of an earnest spirit of philanthropy. 
There is no better proof for this than the classical directions concerning the care and 
instruction the children are to receive, which form the second chapter of Villemain’s 
rescript of April 24, 1838, approved by Salvandy. 
According to this rescript ‘‘the rooms and courtyard must be cleaned and swept 
every morning thirty minutes before the arrival of the children. At the time set for 
the children’s arrival the teacher (surveillant or surveillante) should receive them, 
inspect each one with regard to cleanliness and neatness, examine the food brought 
with reference to quantity and wholesomeness, see that the baskets are placed on 
the shelves, and make suitable reports on these things to parents or guardians, A 
child that is sick when brought shall not be received, but taken to its home or 
immediately sent to the physician.

teacher makes sharp clicks resembling those made with a castanet. Those clicks serve as signals or 
accentuate the steps of the children marching.

“The teachers and women for general service, impressed with the sacredness of 
their charge in the persons of these little children, should strive to fulfill their mis- 
sion with unchangeable gentleness and true Christian patience. The children should 
never be struck. The inspectress should see to it with the greatest care that no 
excessively long or severe punishment be inflicted. 
“The teachers should always superintend the exercises and recreations; they 
should always be in position to obtain at any moment and at the first signal complete 
silence: Whatever attention may be needed for the children’s health should be im-

  mediately given by the teachers. Children who are tired or indisposed should rest 
on the cots provided for this purpose, or in the teacher’s lodging, until they can be 
returned to their families. ‘ 
“The evolutions of the children, and the games suitable to their age, should always 
be directed and superintended in order to avoid all quarrels and unpleasant acci- 
dents. In the courtyard the ground should always be covered with a deep layer of 
sand. The periods of intermission afford intelligent and attentive teachers constant 
opportunities for instruction concerning cleanliness, deportment, politeness. The  
-P-A-G-E-78
    ; 726 EDUCATION EEPORT, 1890-91 
thousand little incidents of each day may serve as texts for useful lessons that will 
never be forgotten, and which in due time will bear most grateful fruit. 
“The teacher should ascertain each day who are absent and whv are present, not by 
subjecting such young children to a roll call, but by reading all the names on the 
register and by calling to his aid, in his observations, the waiting maid and a few of 
the older children. W hen, after ‘the last period of instruction, the children are not 
called for by some member of their families, the teacher should retain them, so that 
This ‘they should do until all the children are they may not be alone in the streets. 
Should parents, after due notice, continue in such negligence, the in safe hands. 
inspectress may authorize the teacher to refuse further admission to the child. In 
-case of the reiterated absence of the child, without some known cause, the teacher 
should ascertain the cause of such absence and record it for the information of the 
inspectress. 
“On Sundays and other holidays, the teachers, if the parents desire it, should 
assemble the older children at the salle @asile in order to conduct them to divine 
service. It will also be proper, if on the same days the teachers visit sick, pupils; 
talk with parents about the character and conduct of their children, of the faults 
and failings that deserve special attention; discuss with the mayor and with philan- 
thropic persons the most pressing needs of certain children or of the school itself.” 
The philanthropic spirit that dictated these directions led the more sanguine 
friends of these schools to the most extravagant expectations. 
Mademoiselle Matrat calls it a poem—w hich Saly: andy addressed the prefects of 
departments, dated in August, 1845, this 
“This blessed institution promises to oj     
  Thus, in a cireular— 
nerous minister of public instruction, says: 
r nation generations sounder in mind and 
body, more deeply impressed with principles of order and discipline so needful in an 
epoch of popular liberty and activity like ours—generations better informed, more 
capable, better prepared for work and for the achievement of prosperity. * * 
By means of these institutions the communes can transform their people, instruct 
them, elevate them, and substitute for their evil tendencies principles of sound 
morality and habits of practical integrity.” 
In another circular, dated September, 1846, the same enthusiastic minister informs 
the prefects that “ the salles Vasile render the family and society invaluable service. 
By daily gathering the children during the hours when the family can not take care 
of them without giving up a part of its daily labor—which is its only wealth—they 
afford the children greater liberty, more comfort, and greater security. 
give to the children the first education which their parents have always lacked. ~ They 
This education will secure to our land more moral, stronger, better disciplined, bet- 
ter instructed generations.” 
In the actual work of the schools, however, the teachers were so hemmed in by 
directions, manuals, and inspections concerning the most self-evident externals of 
their duties that they could reach a truly educative activity scarcely in any phase 
It remained at best and always mere verbal information, tested 
by verbal recitation, and class drill tested by class unanimity. 
M. Cochin himself says that persons who have merely looked in on a salle dasile 
must be impressed with the fact that here the pupils are carried on by a common 
movement that holds the entire class, not one finding himself able to raise a doubt 
or to offerresistance; that here the children follow the right way in which they are 
placed; that thus habit is ‘formed and education achieves its triumphs without dif- of their work.

therefore, safe in concluding that, in spite of the best intentions, the salle d’asile

make of the child a passive being, an atom ina conventional whole, and there is 
nothing to start his progressive and rational development by enlisting his self-

“Deprived of his liberty of movement, incessantly benumbed by routine, the ~ 
child had at school neither originality nor personality, was merely one of the links 
of the chain, one of the wheels of an unconscious machine. The method of the salle 
Wasile, indeed, avoided confusion and tumult, it obtained silence, but at what price, 
* * * and it finally deceived the teachers concerning their own fitness, for it over-_ 
whelmed with praise not those who knew the children best, but those who, having 
most completely absorbed the processes, made children go most successfully through 
the drills.” 
That under such conditions great stress should be laid on mere verbal information 
is to be expected. Even the manual of M. Cochin shows that this was the ease. He 
demands ‘‘not reading, but a knowlege of theletters; * * * notindustrial teach- 
ing, but acertain amount of information about common things; * * * not moral 
and religious instruction, but some impressions concerning morals and religion.” 
This led to all sorts of strange devices in letter-teaching, to the memorizing of the 
most incomprehensible or unmeaning descriptions and definitions; and, in morals 
and religion, to the smaller catechism. A few samples from the manual of Madame 
Pape-Carpantier, so closely identified with the growth and development of the salle 
@asile, will render this clear. ; 
For teaching the reading of words she recommends the phonomimic method of 
Gyosselin. By this method the word is analyzed into its series of spoken sounds and 
the corresponding written signs of these sounds. Each sound is, at the same time, 
successively associated with some animal or some familar fact, and impressed upon 
the memory by having the children imitate the animal or indicate the fact in some 
gesture corresponding to the spoken sound andits written sign which is pointed out 
to them. Thusthe word chapeau (hat) is handled as follows: 
ch . The children place a finger on the lips to indicate silence, and say: sh! 
a They-raise their hands in admiration: ah! 
They blow explosively on the back of the hand, as if to blow away a feather: p! 
eau They extend their hands forward, expressive of repulsion, saying: oh! 
In a ‘‘grammar” lesson in Which the child is to find out what words are, the 
teacher, after a few leading questions, addresses the children as follows: ‘Well, 
children, letters arranged in such a way as to make us think of some person or thing 
form words. Words serve to express, to make known what we want. When you 
say, ‘I am hungry,’ yousay words. When you say, ‘I am going to bed,’ these, again, 
are words which you repeat as you have heard others repeat them. For we allspeak 
in words, and written words are formed with letters, like those I have just written. 
What, now, is the use of the letters of the alphabet? Do you know it now?” 
Among the first lessons in numbers is the following: 
TEACHER. How much is a 6 worth, standing alone? (Here the figure 6 is shown 
with the pointer.]—A. Six units. 
TEACHER. What is a unit?—A. A whole object. j : 
TeacuEr. Show me 6 units. [The child drops 6 balls on the abacus.] 
In drawing, Madame Pape-Carpantier would have the children learn, after a num- 
ber of explanations and comments, all sorts of geometrical definitions, such as of a 
straight line being the shortest distance between two points, etc. 
In the first lesson on the human body the children find head, arms, legs, body. 
They are then regaled with the following dialogue: 
- LeeceeE. Had Adam and Eve, our first parents, a body, arms, and legs like ours ?— 
.<Yes, 
TracnER. Then we are made as God made our first parents?—A. Yes. 
Tracner. Then God gives to the little children the same form which he gave to 
the parents. 
Here, too, is found a lesson on the “symmetry of the organs.” A lesson on the 
circulation of the blood gives all possible information about arteries and veins, the 
course of the blood, and its relation torespiration. The height of pedantry is reached, 
however, in the lessons on “the soul,” ‘the invisibility and sovereignty of the 
soul,” and ‘the separation of soul and body.” 
A lesson on conscience in the religious instruction concludes as follows: 
TEacuER. Do you know why God has given us a conscience capable of thus reward- 
ing us for our good actions?’—A. Because He is good. g 
TracuER. But why has He made it capable also of punishing us for our bad 
actions?—A. Because he is just. 
Another lesson on sin is so grossly immoral in its tendencies that one shudders to 
find it in a book that bears the imprint of 1885. : 
Do we wonder that with these facts before her Mademoiselle Matrat, the clear- 
sighted general inspectress of maternal schools, should stigmatize the salle @asileas a 
“dead body.” -Must we not sympathize with her when she sums up her criticism in 
these words: “As fast as the uniform and crushing discipline of Lancaster disappeared 
from the primary school it identified itself with public infant education to such an

  extent that to-day it paralyzes the école maternelle, which will die because it allowed 
itself to be engrafted on a corpse!” 
The name écoles maternelles (maternal schools) was officially given to these insti- 
tutions in an order dated April 28, 1848. For a long time previous to this date the 
people in many places had found the name salle W@asile distasteful. It suggested to 
them a somewhat ostentatious charity and seemed to degrade to the level of beggars 
the working people, who chiefly patronized them. Yet these patrons were of the 
bone and sinew of the nation. They labored hard to live honestly; even the mothers 
joined in the heroic struggle against tlie very beggary which the salle @asile implied. 
On the other hand, far from affording a sort of voluntary alms, these schools seemed 
to these hard-working people rather a practical acknowledgment of a sacred duty 
which the State owed to them, a duty to be to the children of these heroic mothers 
what, because of their industrial duties, they could not be themselves. This relation 
was so well expressed by the term ¢cole maternelle that long before the order of the 
18th of April the name had become currentin many localities. If, at the same time, 
the method of the salle d’asile had become odious among thoughtful educators, the 
new name would offer an opportunity to symbolize reform and to cast the odium 
that attached to the method upon the old name itself. 
It was fitting that the Republic of 1848 should give official sanction to these voic- 
ings of a correct popular instinct, declaring that ‘the salles Wasile, improperly 
called charitable institutions, are institutions of public instruction, and will hence- 
forth bear the name ¢écoles maternelles.” This order was signed by Carnot. 
Perhaps it was equally fitting that the first decree on this subject, signed by Louis 
Napoleon, should unceremoniously reinstate the old name which persisted during his 
reign; and fitting again that it was reserved for the third Republic, in a decree of 
August, 1881, to rehabilitate the more popular name and to declare that ‘the écoles 
maternelles are educational establishments where children of both sexes receive the 
care which their physical, intellectual, and moral development requires.” 
The Empire came, indeed, like a cloud over these schools. In the spring of 1854 
the central committee of patronage had been placed under the auspices of the Em- 
press, who became protectress ex officio of the salles @asile. In the spring of the fol- 
lowing year a decree was published fixing the status of the salles d’asile which con- 
tains little of note, unless it be the fervor with which it emphasizes the claims of 
the church upon the children. Henceforth in the Catholic salles @asile the relig- 
ious instruction is to be given under the direction of the bishop, and in every such 
school a crucifix and an image of the Holy Virgin are to form an obligatory part of 
the furniture. In all salles @asile, too, a portrait of the Empress must be suspended. 
The decree provided for more detailed regulations to be prepared by a committee 
and approved by the Empress. These regulations, issued on the very next day, were 
in the same spirit. The religious instruction demanded “comprises particularly the 
first chapters of the smaller catechism.” * * * ‘The moral exercises comprise 
the recital of historical incidents which tend to inspire the child with a profound 
sentiment of love to God, of gratitude to the Emperor and to their august protect- 
ress, to teach them their duties to their parents and to their superiors; to render 
them gentle, polite, and kind to one another.” 
In other respects the programme is more schoolish and bookish than before. 
“(Reading comprises the vowels and consonants, the large and small letters of the 
alphabet, the different kinds of accents, syllables of two or three letters, words of 
two syllables. * * * Arithmetic comprises knowledge of the single numbers, 
their representation by Arabic ciphers, addition and subtraction taught with the 
abacus, the multiplication tables memorized with the aid of singing, an explanation 
of weights and measures with the help of solids or of tables. * * * A knowl- 
edge of common things embraces the divisions of time, the seasons, the colors, the 
senses, the shapes, the materials and uses of familiar objects; notions about ani- 
mals and plants, simple trades, the elements, the shape of the earth, its principal 
divisions, the names of the departments of France with their capitals, and what- 
ever other rudimentary ideas may help to form the judgment of the children;” if, 
indeed, adds Madame Kergomard, the preceding rubbish has not rendered them 
hopelessly stupid. 
- The regulations then proceed 1o detail the manual and singing exercises, and con- 
clude as they began with the religious and moral exercises: ‘‘The lessons and the 
religious and moral exercises” begin and end with a short prayer; they take place 
from 10 o’clock until noon and from 2 to 4 o’clock. 
'Theré is one ray of light, however, in the following article: ‘It is forbidden to 
overload the memory of the children with dialogues or dramatic scenes destined for 
public occasions.” 
By a strange coincidence the year 1855, which reriveted ancient fetters upon the 
salles d’asile, saw the arrival in Paris of the gifted Baroness Marenholtz-Buelow. 
She knew, as she says, not a single person and had come without any letters of rec- 
ommendation. Her first visit was to Marbeau, president of the ‘International
-P-A-G-E-81
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 729 
Society of Charity,” and founder of the creche. He took a deep interest in her work 
and aided her in many ways. For three years she remained in Paris, delivering lec- 
tures under all imaginable conditions, writing articles for the press, publishing 
pamphlets, superintending the publication of a practical manual,! and directing 
experimental work in a number of salles @asile. 
In order to secure recognition for Froebel in the salles Vasile, it was necessary 
that she should gain the favor of Cardinal Morlot and of the Empress. The former 
presided over the committee of patronage of these schools, the latter was president 
of the central committee. She was successful beyond her most sanguine expecta- 
tions. The official journal of the ministry of instruction published shortly after her 
arrival that at the “ request of Baroness von Marenholtz, her majesty in her anxiety 
for the welfare of the children had ordered the creation of a commission to examine 
Froebel’s new method of education in his kindergartens, and eventually to intro- 
duce it in our salles @asile.” : 
This commission was appointed and the salle dasile in the normal school of 
Madame Pape-Carpantier designated for the experiments, For three months the chil- 
dren were here instructed in the games and occupations by a young teacher under 
the direction of Madame von Marenholtz, and under the supervision of the com- 
mission. The subsequent report of the commission is quite favorable. It points 
out the facts that Froebel’s occupations prevent indolence and employ usefully all 
the powers of the child; that even in so short a time there was noticeable a great 
improvement in the morals and manners of the children, It requests the minister 
of public instruction to order the introduction of Froebel’s ‘occupations in all the 
salles @asile, ‘‘so that the children of the working classes may thereby learn to 
love activity and work; gain manual skill, keenness of vision, bodily strength, and 
be generally prepared for subsequent working and learning.” However, this intro- 
duction was not to be obligatory, chiefly because the method could be profitably 
used only by trained teachers. 
Madame Pape-Carpantier herself says about these experiments: ‘‘ The devices of 
» the ‘méthode Froebel’ would prove very helpful. They would occupy the children 
usefully, and by that alone would lighten the now too heavy burden of the directresses. 
During the entire series of manual experiments made at our normal school (cours 
pratique) the children’s interest was aroused and held without fatigue on the part 
of the teacher, as well as without constraint on the children’s part. Inasmuch as 
the first manifestation of life in the child is an impulse of activity and movement, 
it is easy to see how devices that appeal to the senses andkeep hands and eyes busy, 
devices that keep alive curiosity by their exhaustless variety and that reward the 
busy child with almost certain success, should be welcomed with joy and preferred to 
the drudgery of listening and listening again and constantly to monotonous lessons 
heard a hundred times over by the teacher.” 
Unfortunately this was practically the end. It is true that the “‘méthode Froe- 
bel” was introduced in a number of asiles, that many persons were deeply interested 
in Froebel’s educational principles, and that the press praised Froebel as the dis- 
coverer of a new educational method based on a knowledge and appreciation of 
man’s innermost nature; but the peitical storms that held the Empire constantly on 
the verge of dissolution, and which necessarily kept educational interests at a low 
ebb, and, still more, the unfortunate error that saw in Froebel’s educational gospel 
only a new méthode, another way for reaching an old end, caused the work of the 
gifted prophetess to become almost forgotten. 
To such an extent was this the case that Mademoiselle Matrat, in her history of 
Public Infant Education, puts the date of the arrival of Madame Marenholtz in Paris 
“about 1864,” and gives the honor of authorizing the first experiment in kindergar- 
ten work to M. Gréard. 
At any rate there was no notable advance or new development in the salle d’asile 
as a whole between 1855 and 1879. It is true their number increased, and conse- 
quently the need of increased facilities for the normal training of teachers was felt 
more and more deeply. Yet in their educational character they remained well nigh 
stationary, to such an extent that Mademoiselle Matrat, who entered upon her duties 
as inspectress in 1879, says that she was ‘‘so struck with their antiquated, mummi- 
fied, conventional, and artificial makeup, that her first inspection left on her mind 
an impression like that of a visit to the land of ‘The Beauty in the Sleeping Forest.’” 
Another inspectress, Mademoiselle Loizillon, reports in 1880: ‘‘Some teachers have 
completely transformed their asiles into schools where the children write, recite 
ereee by heart, make analyses, conjugate verbs, and make copies in order to 
earn orthography.” : 
In the same year the teachers’ congress in Paris resolved unanimously that the 
“salles @asile ought to give less negative results.” a

  730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
Again, in 1881, Mademoiselle Matrat reviews the methods, which the new decree 
of that year would supersede, in the following vivid terms: 
“Now what has been the ideal method of the salle @asile up to this day? It has 
been that of a ten minutes’ talk or dissertation on the teacher’s part, followed by 
questions frequently on subjects of advanced science, such as the metallurgy of iron, 
the extraction of rock-salt and of sea-salt, the influence of the moon on the tides, 
definition of the tliree kingdoms of nature, their divisions and subdivisions, ete. 
The children keep silent, the teacher talks for ten minutes. What is the result? 
Alas! she knows it, and acknowledges it readily. When the time for questioning 
has come, she finds that the silence in their minds was as great as that in the room.” 
In 1879 a special commission was appointed under the presidency of Ad. Mourier, 
charged with the reorganization of the salles @asile. As the result of their labors a 
new decree came in August, 1881, and new regulations in 1882. 
The decree of 1881 definitely establishes the name école maternelle, and recognizes 
the claims of intellectual in addition to physical and moral development. It sub- 
stitutes for the first principles of religious the first principles of moral instruction; 
these in the public écoles maternelles are ineulcated not under the form of special 
and connected lessons but by means of conversations, questions, stories, and songs, 
calculated to inspire a sense of their duties toward the family, the fatherland, and 
toward God, wholly free, however, from all sectarian teaching. 
The decree requires,furthermore, instruction on common things (clothing, shelter, 
food, color, shape, division of time, seasons, etc.); the rudiments of drawing (stick- 
laying, copying on the slate, easy designs drawn on the blackboard, outline repre- 
sentations of simple objects); language exercises, training the children in expressing 
what they have heard or seen; collective or concert exercises in reading and writing; 
exercises in the combinations of numbers between 1 and 10 and from 10 to 100, the 
four operations in the most elementary form and, at first, within the limits of 1 to 
10, the representation of numbers by figures, simple applications of the metric sys- 
tem, all with the help of blocks and. sticks, etc.; the rudiments of natural histery 
with the help of objects and collections made by the children and teachers; notions 
of geography (the cardinal points, land and water, the rivers, mountains, and prin- 
. cipal cities of France); stories on the grand facts of national history and on common 
objects; manual exercises (plaiting, weaving, folding, light knitting), but “nothing 
that will fatigue the children ;” graded gymnastic and calisthenic exercises; the sing- 
ing of simple time and tune exercises, and of one-part and two-part rote songs to ac- 
company the games. 
It reduces the minimum age of the directress from 24 to 21 years, and that of the 
subdirectress from 21 to 18 years; provides for general inspectresses, who shall be 
at least 35 years old, and shall have taught at least five years; and department in- 
spectresses, at least 30 years old, and for three years teacher. It requires that les- 
sons shall not exceed fifteen or twenty minutes, and be interspersed with songs, 
ymnastic exercises, marches, and evolutions, and establishes a number of judicious 
ractices, which indicate clearly that the state has learned to take a broader and 
deeper view of the educational problem and has gained a truer insight into the 
nature and needs of childhood. 
“ach line of this programme,” writes Madame Kergomard, ‘‘is a protest of peda- 
gogic science against routine; it gaye a mortal blow to the ‘méthode des salles 
@asile.’” For this statement she offers as proof the preface of a detailed programme 
of studies, circulated by the ministry of education (Jules Ferry) in July, 1882. This 
preface is so classical that it is here given in full. It says: 
“The école maternelle is not an ordinary school; it forms the transition from the 
family to the school; it preserves the affectionate and indulgent tenderness of the 
Sunily, while at the same time it initiates the child in the work and discipline of the 
school. 
“The success of the directress of an école maternelle is, therefore, measured not 
by the mass of imparted knowledge, not by the number and length of lessons, but 
rather by the sum of good influences with which the child is surrounded, by the 
pleasure it feels in the school, by the habits of order, neatness, politeness, attention, 
intellectual activity it acquires there, as it were, in play. 
“Consequently, the directresses should aim to promote to the primary school not 
somuch children already well advanced in instruction, but rather children well pre- 
pared to receive instruction. All exercises of the école maternelle should accord 
with this principle; they should favor the development of the various faculties of 
the child without fatigue, without compulsion or excessive application; they should 
make him love the school and give him at an early period a taste for work by never 
requiring of him a kind of work incompatible with the weakness and instability of 
tender years. < 
“The end in view, while considering the diversity of temperaments, the precocity 
of some and the slowness of others, is not to bring all to a certain grade of skill in 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, but it is that they know well what they may
-P-A-G-E-83
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 731 
know, that they love their tasks, their games, their lessons of any kind; it is par- 
ticularly that they may not have a dislike for those first school exercises, which 
would so readily become distasteful if the patience, the versatility, the ingenuous 
affection of the teacher did not contrive to vary them, to enliven them, to get from 
them or attach to them some pleasure for the child. 
“Good health; the senses already trained by a series of little games and experi- 
ments calculated to educate them; childlike, but distinct and clear ideas on the 
first rudiments of what will become primary instruction; a start in the formation of 
habits and tastes on which the school may base its regular teaching; a taste for gym- 
nastics, singing, drawing, pictures, stories; eagerness to listen, to look, to observe, 
to imitate, to ask and answer questions; a certain power of attention resulting from 
docility, confidence, and. good cisposition; finally, an awakened intelligence and a 
soul open to all good moral impressions; these are effects and results to be asked of 
the école maternelle, and if the child comes from it to the primary school with such 
a preparation, it matters little whether it has acquired a few pages more or less of 
the syllabus.” 
The circular then proceeds to discuss the method to be followed and finds it in the 
imitation of the method followed by an “intelligent and devoted mother.” It con- 
demns ‘‘ the exclusive following of any special method founded on an exclusive and 
artificial system ;” but, taking from every school its simplest exercises, it ‘‘seeks to 
form a course of instruction and education that may answer all the various needs 
and call into play all the faculties of the little child. * * * It is a method essen- 
tially natural, unconstrained, always open to progress, always susceptible of exten- 
sion and reform.” 
These excellent suggestions are followed by detailed programmes, setting forth 
the things and exercises to be presented to the children in each of the two sections 
(from 2 to 5 and from 5 to 7 years, respectively) and during each season. These pro- 
grammes are so simple and thoughtful, so thoroughly adapted to the child’s needs, 
and so happily connected with his spontaneous interests, so wholly free from science- 
aping, that to this day they may well serve as models for guidance in the work of 
the infant school and of the lower primary grades. 
Yet it seems that, in spite of their simplicity and in spite of the unmistakable dis- 
tinctness and clearness with which they insist upon their simplicity, the teachers 
failed to apprehend their spirit. ‘The children,” writes Madame Kergomard, 
“from 2 to 6 years old remained in our écoles maternelles subjected to a system of 
artificial physical activity fatal to their bodily development, and exposed to prema- 
turely advanced work most injurious to their intellectual development.” 
This state of affairs led to the formation of anew commission under the presidency 
of M. Gréard, whose labors culminated in a new*decree and programme published in 
January, 1887. In its programme, this decree laid first stress on physical education 
as the underlying basis of all education. This is to be attained by means of plays, 
games, graduated calisthenic movements accompanied by singing, and, lastly, by 
manual work. The very enumeration of these means proves that the framers of this 
programme took a broad organic view of physical training, and endeavored to con- 
nect it closely at every step with intellectual and moral elements, appreciating the 
fact that physical training derives its only value from this connection. This is 
beautifully expressed by Madame Kergomard, who writes: ‘While playing with his 
comrades the child learns to live in association with others, his. conscience is aroused, 
the first principles of morals are revealed to him. Without ever hearing a set moral 
lesson, he learns to understand gradually that he must not be overbearing, or brutal, 
or selfish, or indolent, that he should love and obey parents and teachers. Day by 
day he gains in generosity and gentleness, in love of work, in fellow feeling, in 
kindness. He ought to know these things before he knows how to read and write.” 
In the second place, the decree Jays stress on ‘‘ the first principles of moral edu- 
cation,” and lastly, on the requirements of intellectual culture—a knowledge of 
common things, language exercises, stories, the first rndiments of reading and writ- 
ing, as well as of drawing and singing; yet on all these things within narrowest 
limits and within the child’s scope of ready comprehension. At the same time the 
decree emphasizes the necessity of instructing boys and girls together, confirms the 
establishment of two sections.of children (from 2 to 5 and from 5 to 6 years old, 
respectively), and increases the number of holidays by adding two full weeks to 
the Sundays and principal religious and national holidays heretofore granted. 
On the other hand, it forbids, in special regulations added to the deeree, the keep- 
ing of any kind of domestic animals in the rooms of the school, and reaffirms the 
practice of giving merit cards, which may be exchanged for pictures and playthings, 
but prohibits the giving of prizes. 
A significant paragraph suggests the introduction of small movable oblong tables, 
each accommodating eight children. ‘‘ Those honest tables,” says Madame Kergo- 
mard, ‘where the child has a comrade on each side and comrades opposite; those 
good tables, which permit chatting, an exchange of impressions and discoveries,”    
     
-P-A-G-E-84
        
        
        
            
    
            
          
  132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Unquestionably these tables, together with movable single chairs, and. with-the > 
Froebel material that must accompany them, will do much to banish the reprehen- 
sible ‘méthode de la salle @asile,” and to establish not only Froebel’s method, but 
Froebel’s principles, a consummation which seems to be earnestly sought by the 
leaders of educational progress in this movement. 
The subjoined cuts of tables in use before the gradual adoption of the far-seeing 
suggestion of the decree of 1887 will give an idea how thoroughly schoolish was the 
psf first French interpretation of Froebel’s thought. Every precaution is taken to iso- 
late the child. Even in the “Model Froebel Table” (Fig. 6), with its quasi social 
bench, the surface of the table is managed in a way to isolate the individuals and to 
ostracize every approach to social work. Similarly, the fact that all the children 
face the teacher excludes all truly spontaneous activity, and renders impossible 
mutually helpful spontaneous interest on the children’s part. A glance at these 
tables will satisfactorily explain Madame Kergomard’s enthusiasm in favor of the 
“honest” oblong tables that will accommodate 8 children at their four sides. 
    
  
  
  
Fig. 5.—'' Beole Maternelle” tablo (Paris model).    Another achievement of this decree is the final practical abandonment of the 
“¢école enfantine.” ‘These schools were the outgrowth of a practice of sending chil- 
dren to school before the age of 6 years. In the course of time these younger chil- 
dren were gathered in special schools, which, without assuming the unpopular uame 
of salle Wasile, followed many of its practices. 
. A ministerial circular of 1882 fixed the age of admission to these schools between 
6 and 8, and gave them the character of transition schools between the école mater- 
nelle andthe primary school. For smaller communities that have no école maternelle, 
the cireular authorized for children between the ages of 5 and 8 the establishment 
4 of the classe enfantine in connection with the primary school. 
The decree of 1887 abandons the école enfantine as coinciding with the école mater- 
nelle, but retains the classe enfantine for children between the ages of 4 and 7, and 
requires that their programme be in conformity with that of the older section of 
ue onies maternelles as well as with that of the elementary course of the primary 
schools.

    PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. : 133. 
In the selection of teachers for the écoles maternelles much care is exercised. No’ 
one is admitted to the examination for the certificate of fitness before the age of 18, 
and without a certificate of moral character and others showing where she has 
resided and what occupations she has followed for-at least three years previous to 
her application. The examination itself is quite strict, calling for skill in orthogra- 
phy, penmanship, arithmetic, the writing of letters and simple essays, reading, 
drawing, and singing,\as well as for a fair knowledge of the principles of moral 
education, literature, grammar, geography, the history of France, the elements of 
natural his.ory, andof hygiene. Written and oral tests on these subjects are supple- 
mented by practical tests in some école maternelle, which the candidate may visit for 
two days previous to the tests. In these the applicant fills during one portion of 
the session the office of directress, and during another portion that of subdirectress, 
  Fig. 6.—‘' Model Froebel table.” (The benches, if desired, may be furnished with backs.) 
Still more is required of the general inspectresses. These must be at least thirty- 
five years of age; must have taught at least five years, and be provided witha license 
to teach in the superior primary schools, with a certificate of pedagogic fitness and 
a certificate of fitness for the inspection of écoles maternelles. The latter requires 
the writing of a satisfactory essay on some subject of pedagogics as applied to these 
schools, an essay on their hygiene, oral tests on the same subjects and on questions 
of legislation and administration concerning these schools, as well as a practical test, 
consisting in the actual inspection of some école maternelle and an oral report 
thereon. in 
The law provides also for department inspectresses ; but very few departments have 
availed themselves of this provision. Itis claimed that this is due chiefly to the 
unpopularity of female supervision. Yet the hand of woman—or rather her head, 
rendered so clear in all that pertains to education by the love she bears to child- 
hood—is the one prominent and unfailing factor in the development of these remark- 
able schools. However, this unpopularity is steadily yielding before the luminous 
and fearless enthusiasm of general inspectresses, such as Madame Thomas, née Matrat, 
and Madame Kergomard, who rank among the foremost educational forces of France. 
In order to secure satisfactorily prepared teachers for these schools, an école ma- 
ternelle normale was created by a public decree in Paris in 1848. The courses of 
study were short enough—only four months. Their purpose was ‘‘to complete the 
elementary instruction of the students, and, particularly, to teach them to direct the 
écoles maternelles in the spirit of the Republic.” The special programme for this 
school was decreed in the following year, and Mademoiselle Pape (later Madame 
Pape-Carpantier) was made directress of the school. In fact, however, the school 
had been established by private philanthropy in 1847, and Mademoiselle Pape, who 
had distinguished herself as a thoughtful writer on the subject of the salles Wasile 
’ and as a successful directress of salles @asile at Mans, had been called to its direc- 
tion at that time. In 1848 and 749, the Government assumed control of this school 
and continued Mademoiselle Pape in its direction. 
In 1875 the two annual courses of four months each were united in one course. In 
1878 it received the name Ecole Pape-Carpantier; and in 1882 its duties were trans- 
ferred to special normal courses established in connection with the normal schools’ 
for lady teachers (écoles normales dinstitutrices) in the various departments of the 
Republic; and the Ecole Pape-Carpantier received the special charge of preparing 
directresses and professors for these normal courses. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  1384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
In the normal courses of the department normal schools the programme.embraces 
“a course of general instruction bearing on the work of the first year in the maternal 
schools, a course in pedagogics, and practice teaching in the maternal school 
annexed to the institution.” In the Ecole Pape-Carpantier the programme requires 
a course in psychology and ethics as applied to education, a course in critical his- 
tory. of pedagogic doctrines, with special reference to the education of earliest 
infaney, various courses on the subjects taught in the department normal courses of 
_ the écoles maternelles, model lessons and practice exercises in the school itself as well 
asin the écoles maternelles and in the classes enfantines instruction concerning the 
legislation and administration of maternal schools and infant classes. 
An important decree of 1884 added a new triumph. It requires the establishment 
of an école maternelle in connection with every normal school for lady teachers, in 
order to enable every teacher to form an estimate of their character and value, to 
enable her to study child-nature within wider limits, and thus to protect her from 
the snares and pitfalls of a narrow empiricism. A similar wisdom has induced many 
of the normal schools in our own land to establish kindergartens in connection with 
_their practice schools; and there seems to be little doubt that this measure, afford- 
ing rich opportunities for the direct observation of growing childhood, does much 
to banish from the schools the evils of mere lesson-giving and equally much to 
establish a truly educational practice in our primary schools. 
One of the most charming features of the école maternelle is the warm meal which 
it secures to every child at noon. A quite full account of this excellent custom will 
be found in Mademoiselle Hardy’s account of ‘A Day in the Maternal School,” 
appended to this statement. 
On the whole, indeed, in spite of repeated legislative attempts to emphasize the 
educational character of these schools, they still continue to be conducted largely 
as charitable institutions. There is no better proof of this than the “ conclusions” of. 
Madame Kergomard in her monograph on ‘Les Ecoles Maternelles.” Here she declares 
them to be ‘‘absolutely indispensable in large cities and industrial centers;” she 
would render them “obligatory for neglected children;” she would require “the 
daily attendance of children whose mothers work daily and all day away from 
home;” and would have them receive ‘other children during the hours when their 
mothers can not take care of them.” She would also have them (notice the signifi- 
cant term) “ give hospitality during the hours of recreation to children who have 
neither brothers nor sisters.” Finally, in comparing the maternal schools of France 
with the infant schools of London, she points with special pride to the fact that in 
the former the children “‘found at least warm meals to strengthen their poor little 
bodies, and warm caresses to comfort their hearts.” 
Somewhat different conclusions are reached by Mademoiselle Matrat (Madame 
Thomas) in her Histoire de VEducation Enfantine Publique. She finds that the école 
matornelle such as the superior council had in mind, exists only in eight or ten large 
cities; that elsewhere it has not displaced the salle d’asile (see Appendix). 
She shows that public statistical reports on this subject are misleading. These 
report, in 1889, 3,700 public institutions of this character,! distributed in 2,000 com- 
munes, and receiving 500,000children. Mademoiselle Matrat shows that, because of cer- 
tain peculiarities of registration, this number should be reduced to 350,000, and that of 
these, even in the good season, only 280,000 actually attend school. In addition, she 
points out tlie fact that while these reported schools are-distributed in 2,000 com- 
munes, there are 34,000 other communes without public écoles maternelles. She | 
concludes, therefore, that the services rendered by the école maternelle are of a local 
character, and belong to exceptional situations, and do not justify the efforts and 
sacrifices made in their behalf.” 
While, therefore, she would let actual asylums for little children continue to exist, 
she would not create new ones.at public expense; she would give up the attempt of 
“making the education of all little children a public, uniform, and universal afiair;” 
but would rather organize in a general way the education of these children by the 
family. 
In order to accomplish this, she would, in the first place, modify the school pro- 
gramme for girls. She would teach them less about the battles and treaties of the 
    
1 The official report of 1886-"87 enumerates, in addition to 3,597 public écoles maternelles, attended by 
543,839 children, 2,493 private ones, attended by 217,583 children. 
2'This conclusion seems rashly taken. France, during the current century, has gone through many revulsions unfavorable to the development of educational interests. Lorain (Tableau del Instruction 
Publique) reports in 1887 tl chools in summer were usually empty; that parents even refused offers of money to send their children to school, claiming that they could not spare them from the 
fields. In one commune of 128 children, the municipal council refused to establish a school because 
» the money was needed to build roads. In some departments only7 per cent, in others only 4 per cent, hhad schools. Under such circumstances many generations would be required to enablo the people to appreciate the benefits of education, and probably the école maternelle would be the last to find favor. 
In our own country the primary school is still in many sections much neglected, and the kindergarten will remain a beggar for years to come. Yet it would be rash to argue from this that these imstitu- 
tions are not needed.

  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 135 
Middle Ages, less about political economy and fraetions, but more about hygiene and 
the treatment and education of little children, more about sewing and the fitting of 
garments; she would pay more attention to drawing, and instruct the girls in every 
technical and industrial handicraft which does not call for great physical strength. 
She would then—just as now mothers who nurse their children themselves receive 
assistance from the state—remunerate mothers, in all cases where poverty demands 
this, assistance, for whatever loss they may sustain by educating their chidren at 
home until the age of five. 
“However,” she continues, ‘as the child needs companions, as the mother is com- 
elled now and then to leave the house, let all communes—great and small—estab- 
ish, instead of the excessivety expensive salle @asile, a children’s garden, a garden 
in the plain French meaning of the word, with a playroom for rainy days, a garden 
which will serve as the Tuileries of the children of the people.” 
Even in the absence of her special reservation on this score, it may be doubted 
that in Mademoiselle Matrat’s mind these ‘‘ children’s gardens” had anything in com- 
mon with Froebel’s kindergarten or child-garden. As previously indicated, French 
educators see in Froebel only the inventor of a new méthode. ‘They rarely rise to an 
appreciation of underlying principles; and when Froebel, in the contemplation of 
the infinite responsibilities of his work, fails to find clear and definite utterance for 
the thought-emotions that fill his being, they set him down as a haif-learned mystic 
whom it would be folly to follow. 
This may be largely dwe to the fact that Madame Marenholtz, who brought Froebel’s 
message to Paris in 1885, under the pressure of circumstances laid great stress on 
Froebel’s méthode as distinct from that of the salle @asile, labored to introduce itin 
the salles d’asile which were already established, and in her publications emphasized. 
the charitable and industrial application of the kindergarten. 
Compayré, strangely enough, stamps Froebel as the originator of the salle d’asile, 
which, us we have seen, is a distinctly French interpretation of an English enterprise, 
and—even in its French dress—of much earlier date than the kindergarten. He 
gives Froebel credit for ieee and nobility of sentiment, and for a certain de- 
gree of insight into ‘the instinct of the child,” as well as for ingenuity in “system- 
atizing” the children’s plays; but he has little patience with the persistence with 
which Froebel insists on respect for the child’s spontaneity and freedom, and with 
what he is pleased to call Froebel’s “habitual symbolism” that sees in the child “‘a 
living pledge of the presence, goodness, and love of God.” Freebel’s faith in the 
omnipresence and omnipotence of a Creator who has indelibly and unmistakably 
impressed himself on all manifestations of universal being is to Compayré a vague 
pantheism, and in Froebel’s wonderful stroke of genius which taught him to lead the 
child to see all things, however varied, in the light of the three fundamental forms 
(cube, cylinder, ball), Compayré sees an attempt to “begin with the abstract in 
order to arrive at the concrete,” as if Froebel meant to dogmatize on these forms in- 
stead of using them as mere types which aid the child in apprehending the deeper 
similarities of things. 
Subsequently, however, he seems to have reconsidered this judgment; for in a 
later work he applauds Froebel for the Pestalozzian spirit in which he develops be- 
fore the child’s eyes successively the marvels of the six gifts, exhibits to his view 
concrete objects, such as balls of colored worsted and geometrical bodies, and teaches 
the child to discern their solidity, form, and substance. 
Madame Matrat finds in _‘‘la méthode Froebel” much exaggeration of details, 
much tedious ado about self-evident matters, a confusing medley of geometrical 
terms, and at the very heart of the systema certain mysticism. All of these things she 
deems ill-suited to the French mind; they account, therefore, in a large measure for 
the little favor the “ méthode” has attained in France. 
Even more is made of this want of adaptation on the part of the méthode Froebel 
to the “‘ French temperament” by M. Delon, who, together with Madame Delon, did 
much to introduce some of Froebel’s devices in France. In a letter on this subject, 
which M. Delon had the kindness to address to me in April, 1890, he writes: : 
“Tt was, indeed, I who, in 1872, introduced in Frauce the Froebelian methed. A 
few attempts had been previously made, but had failed of suecess, because the zeal- 
ous persons who had undertaken to introduce among us a method of German origin 
had tried to import it, such as it was, without any change. Nearly all of these were 
ladies charmed with the feminine and sentimental side of the system. They took no ~ 
account of the changes needed.in order to adapt the method to the other customs, 
other ideas, other temperaments—a different race.” 
Under the auspices of an association of ladies “familiar with the tendencies of 
the modern mind and who understood that, while there are in Froebel some things 
worthy of approval, there are others that must be rejected,” M. and Madame Deloa 
studied the question and visited kindergartens in Switzerland, Belgium, and Ger- 
many. On their return they were empowered to open a small experimental school, 
based on their interpretations, in connection with the school of which Madame 
     
     
-P-A-G-E-88
  EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Delon was directress. Two years later, however, Madame Delon died, and the experi- 
ment was discontinued, . 7 
On the other hand, a course in general pedagogics together with a special course 
on the “‘Froebelian method” had been organized at the same time by M. Delon, and 
has been continued by him to this time. This course is attended annually by 
“twenty young women or girls, who are teachers or prepare themselves for the 
work.” 
In writing of his modifications of the ‘‘Froebelian method” M. Delon says: ‘‘ Froe- 
bel, although infinitely ingenious, unfortunately lacked erudition. Ifeltthatit was 
necessary to supply for the education of earliest childhood a firmer basis, and one 
more in keeping with the scientific spirit ofmodern society. For thisreasonI began 
with the establishment of the synthesis of the method of education and instruction 
on ascientific basis, at the same time excluding the mystic element and the excess- 
ive symbolism brought into it by Froebel, and even exaggerated by the women who 
continued his work. Not that I excluded sentiment and poetry, but I purposely 
confined myself to the poetry of nature and of life, avoiding the reveries of a sym- 
bolism which is inaccessible to children. Nature, human labor, family life, home 
affections, human sympathy seemed to me to be the only sources of a true and liy- 
ing poetry.” } 
From another point of view, he first made a sharp distinction between the method 
and its devices, then between general devices and special Frobelian devices. The 
general devices correspond with those of the intuitive metkod in its general fea- 
tures, a method in which the child is taught by means of observation and work and 
which is typified in the object-lesson (legon de choses.) 
With reference to the special Froebelian devices he claims to have shown that 
they were and could be only special cases of some general device, distinguished 
merely by certain forms and certain details; that, indeed, all these special devices 
(the exercises with the cubes, prisms, sticks, rings, ete.) together constitute an in- 
tuitive study of geometry and an introduction to the intelligent construction and 
realization of geometrical forms. ‘ Consequently,” he continues, “I have grouped 
them all around the most important exercise of the series, the one exercise which 
represents the general thought most clearly, viz., drawing. I connected all these 
exercises, not exclusively, but principally, as a gradual introduction to drawing, or 
as a variation of drawing.” 
It is scarcely needful to add another word in order to show how little Froebel is 
understood by his French disciple. Froebel’s-constant effort, even in his plays with 
the gifts, to lead the child to a more intelligent observation of the things suggested 
by the plays; his constant endeavor to insure clearer thought and more definite 
thought-expression; his constant aim to lead the children with the help of those 
plays to see more fully and to appreciate more reverently as well as more lovingly the 
relations of things to life; and—most of all—his unceasing endeavor to develop 
and strengthen in the children through these plays, in addition to a growing sense 
of individual power, a correspondingly increasing sense of social responsibility, of 
duty toman and to God—all this is overlooked, and nothing remains but a little 
Pestalozzian knowledge-getting and a new way to teach drawing. 
    
1M. Delon gives us illustrations in his Lectures Expliquées of the poctry of which he approves for early childhood. These consist of a number of dictations to be given to the children and followed by 
explanations of certain portions of the dictation. I take one of them at random; it is entitled ‘‘ The 
Moth,” and reads as follows: 
“O moth, pretty little moth with velvety wings, more delicate than the leaf of a rose, lighter than, the feather carried away by the wind, littlé capricious, roving thing! Flutter about in the dusk of the evening, drink the dewdrops on the leaves, skim over the water of the pond, graze with thy 
wings the eaves of the house, rest thyself on the flowers of the garden or upon the white walls which 
the moon lights up. Go, come, free as the bird; roam. dar.ce, and whirl; but beware of the owl and 
her glistening eyes; beware, above all, of the treacherous flames that give us light in the evening.” ‘One day the window was open, the lighted candle was on the table. The moth, outside, perceived it. 
Did he mistake it from afar for a star? He flies towards the light; he enters the room.’ ‘ Alas! little 
foolhardy pet who playest with danger, who lovest whatever burns, little doting moth who fliest 
towards all shining things, pet moth beware!” He flies about the candle flame; he passes to and fro, 
flies away and returns; frightened, then dazzled, whirling nearer and nearer, drawn by the flame, so near that he burns the tip of his wing. And, then, it is over, one more turn, then two others, and he 
rushes into the middle of the flame, a slight sudden flash, arustling sound, alittle smoke, it is all 
over.’ ‘Alas! alas! poor little moth!” 
This is followed by a little oral treatise on moths, informing the little child that they are insects; 
that they have a head, a thorax, and an abdomen; that they have six legs; that they undergo meta- morphoses, and so on, the entire science somewhat boiled down. In the first paragraph of another piece the oak has been felled, its wood is prepared for the stove. ‘The second paragraph gives the history of the tree from the acorn up through a hundred years. ‘The third paragraph enjoys ‘the heat of the burming wood, enjoys seeing the forest tree compelled to return to us in the bottom of the furnace the heat and the light which a hundred summers ago, under the 
blue heavens, it took trom the sun.” This is followed by learned disquisitions on the chemistry of 
combustion, not hesitating to disclose to the little child the atomic composition of its products, car- 
bonic acid and water. 
‘We leave those who are familiar with Froebel’s Nursery Songs to judge on whose side lies the true 
poetry, and which will kindle a bright light in the child’s soul—Froebel’s ‘‘ mysticism” or M. Delon’s 
learned mystifications.

  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. ; 737 
Even M. Gréard, to whom Mademoiselle Matrat assigns the honor of having au- 
thorized the first experiments with the ‘‘méthode Froebel” (see page 729) and who 
is a most thoughtful and earnest lover and student of childhood, fails to reach the 
heart of the kindergarten. He recognizes correctly enough that Froebel in his play- 
work with the child appeals to the child’s instincts of inquisitiveness, of activity, and 
personality, but sees the work wholly in its relation to intellectual development 
and ignores its influence on the development of the moral and social nature of the 
child and its bearings on the humane and religious tendencies. 
THE PUBLIC KCOLES MATERNELLES OF PARIS. 
From the official report of M. Duplan, subdirector of primary instruction, the fol- 
lowing account of these schools is culled: 
The public école maternelles of Paris are organized virtually on the basis of the 
decree of August, 1881, which would transform the salle dasile from a purely char- 
itable institution into an école maternelle with definite purposes of instruction, a 
special programme, and peculiar methods of procedure. It is claimed that Paris has 
been able to accomplish this transformation more completely than other parts of 
France. In proof of this, the official regulations, time-table, and programme are 
adduced. (See Appendix B.) ; 
The assential points of transformation aré— 
(1) The definite separation of the children into sections in accordance with their 
age and degree of intellectual development. There are three of these sections, com- 
prising, respectively, children of 2 to 34, 3} to 5, and 5 to 7 years old. In the former 
salle dasile all the children’ were united for purposes of occasional purely oral 
instruction in a single room and seated on an amphitheatral estrade. During the 
greater part of the day the children played as they pleased, under the supervision of 
the teacher, in the play-room or in the open court: In some cases efforts were made 
to teach the children in groups according to age, but this expedient proved quite 
unsatisfactory. In the école maternelle, the children are divided definitely into groups 
not PSN fifty children, and each group is under the direction of its own special 
teacher. 
(2) The consequent establishment of three classrooms, and the gradual abandon- 
ment of the amphitheatral estrade. 
(3) The provision of furniture, seats, and tables, which enable the children to 
practice drawing, writing, and to do manual work with kindergarten material. In 
this direction there is a gradual development from the double-seated school desks, 
with the children facing the teacher, to the movable kindergarten tables and chairs. 
(4) The definite introduction of Froebel’s occupation material, and consequent 
efforts to instruct the teachers in the intelligent use of it by means of conferences 
conducted by the inspectresses. All new teachers are required to be proficient in the 
use of the new methods. 
In order to enable the teachers to carry out the plans of the administration, the 
city places at their disposal an extensive list of books and school apparatus from 
which they may choose freely to the extent of 1 fr. 40c. per pupil and per year. 
Concerning the specific subjects of instruction, the following facts are of interest: 
The greatest difficulties are encountered in the teaching of reading; ‘the phonetic 
alphabet is too abstract to enable the children to understand readily that a certain 
letter or group of letters form a symbol suggesting a certain sound.” Consequently 
the teaching of reading has been combined with exercises in writing. At first the 
child learns to imitate the forms of letters with the help of sticks; he then learns to 
reproduce these forms on his slate, and during the latter part of his stay in the 
école maternelle he is permitted to write on paper. As a rule, at the age of six or 
seven, they read and write passably well. 
Arithmetic is taught within the limits of counting from 1 to 100 and from 100 to 
1,000 with the help of balls, sticks, cubes, ete. At the end of the school period the 
multiplication table is learned,and some very rudimentary notions of the metric 
system are given. 
Geographical notions within narrowest limits afford much satisfaction; but history, 
inasmuch as it deals with facts beyond the children’s horizon, seems to offer much 
difficulty, ~ 
Singing gains in the measure in which the teachers gathermusical knowledge and 
skill for themselves. In the use of the Froebel games some restrictions are imposed 
by the lack of space. The free gymnastic movements which are used in all the 
schools seem to have little interest for the children, and the ordinary gymnastic 
apparatus is excluded because of the dangers its use involves. 
‘This portion of M. Duplan’s report closes with an account of a regulation day in a 
maternal school, which we translate in full: 
“At half past 6 in summer, and at half past7 in winter, the school is opened, the 
Semme de service is at her post, the fire is burning if the weather requires it; every- 
thing is in its place. 
ED 91——47

  738 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
“The teacher on duty is the first to enter; she has to receive the children and to 
supervise them. Until 9 o’clock the children as they arrive are gathered in the court 
in fine weather, in the playroom in unfavorable weather, and play freely. 
“At 9 o’clock all the teachers are at their posts; at the signal given by the direc- 
tress, silence reigns and the children group themselves in classes. 
“From 9 until half past 9 the inspection for cleanliness takes place and the chil- 
dren are led to the closets; finally, at half past 9, they enter the class rooms singing. 
“The next period lasts until half past 10; for an entire hour intenseness of thought! 
Care is taken, therefore, to vary the exercises; a little reading and writing, object 
lessons, and language exercises. After each exercise songs and marching around the 
class room. Thus the hour passes rapidly and the fifteen minutes recess which fol- 
lows suffices to relax the fatigued little minds. 
“At three-quarters past 10 the work istaken up again, varying each day. At one 
time the teacher tells instructive and moral stories, at another time she takes up 
geography. ‘ 
“At half past 11 the hour for luncheon has come. THe children eat what they 
haye brought or what the school fare furnishes them. Then they play. 
“At half past 1 the work begins again as in the morning, with reading and lan- 
_ guage exercises. At 2 o’clock follow arithmetic or singing, alternately, for thirty 
minutes, : 
“From half past 2 to 3 o’clock the little ones play in the playroom or in the court- 
yard, while the larger children are engaged in gymnastic exercises. 
~ “¥rom 8 to half past 3 o’clock, drawing and manual work. Well handled these 
exercises are,a veritable recreation; so that the lessons (in morals or hygiene, or in 
natural history) which follow from half past 3 to 4 o’clock find the children’s atten- 
tion still bright. 
“ After 4 o’clock the children play in the courtyard or on the covered play ground, 
awaiting the arrival of their parents,.who are to come for'them. Very often an 
older brother or sister, themselves pupils in the adjoining primary school, are charged 
with this care, and thus spare their parents a disturbance prejudicial to their daily 
work. 
“At 6 o'clock the last children haye left. The doors of the school are closed. The 
child will return the next day, happy to find again the comfort and the vigilant atten- 
tion which this truly maternal house offers to him.” 
The personnel of the écoles maternelles of Paris consists of directresses, sub-direc- 
tresses (or assistants), and substitutes, who take the places of absent teachers. In 
addition, each school has one or more femmes de service. 
In point of requirements the teachers are on the same footing with primary 
teachers. They must be provided at least with the brevet élémentaire (elementary 
license).!_ Besides, those who would aspire to the position of directress need the cer- 
tificate of pedagogic aptitude.? Again, since 1886, the applicant must not be con- 
nected with any religious order. The personnel may be recruited from among the 
pupil teachers of the Normal School of the Department of the Seine who have finished 
a three years’ course; from among the pupils of a private school ‘‘ Cours Normal des 
Ecoles Maternelles,” subsidized by the minister of instruction and by the city of 
Paris; and from amiong other candidates who. have prepared themselves independ- 
ently for the work of teaching. In 1888, out of 430 teachers of maternal schools in 
Paris, 35 had been furnished by this private ‘cours normal,” the remainder had pre- 
pared themselves for the work independently. Their salaries are the same as those 
of teachers in primary schools for girls, and reach for directresses from 2,750 to 
3,450 franes, and for assistants from 1,500 to 2,500 francs. 
In addition to the teachers each école maternelle has a doorkeeper (concierge) and 
one or more femmes de service. ‘The latter receive a salary of 800 francs. 
In 1888 Paris possessed 127 public écoles maternelles, seating 22,879 children. These 
places are more than filled by 25,700 registered children. In addition to these there 
are 5,177 ‘‘expectants” waiting for vacancies. For the accommodation of these, in 
so far as they are unable to pay the fees of private maternal schools, funds have been 
created to pay these fees for them. However, the funds secured were suflicient for

expended 3,606,000 ‘francs, an increase of 1,459,000 francs or 68 per cent. This 
amounts to 140 francs pany, for each registered child. 
A significant fact, proving the popularity of these schools among educated classes, 
as well as the democratic spirit of the French people, is brought out in a table ex- 
hibiting the callings of the registered children. This shows that the liberal pro- 
fessions are represented by 533 children; the public functionaries by 1,671; commer- 
cial employés by 3,289; merchants and manufacturers by 2,305; workingmen by 
15,755; servants by 1,139; undetermined, 928 children. 
The report justly looks upon this table as a proof that the école maternelle has 
ermanently lost its purely charitable character and is more and more universally 
ooked upon as a desirable educational institution. 
    APPENDIX A. 
The following account of “A day in the Maternal School” has been kindly furnished 
me by Mademoiselle Marie Hardy, subdirectress of the école maternelle, 94 Rue du 
Point du Four, at Paris. It affords a charming view of the inner life ofthese institu- 
tions: 
“‘Our school is situated in one of the pleasantest and healthiest quarters of Paris. 
Well builf and of smiling aspect, it affords every opportunity for the care of little 
children. 
“The class rooms are large, well lighted, and cheerful. The reception hall? in 
which the children eat their meal is spacious and gives access to the play ground. 
Planted with large and beautiful trees, which, in spite of their dense foliage, 
admit air and light, this play ground is at once entertaining and instructive. Kn- 
tertaining because here the children engage in their merry games, and instructive 
because it possesses a plat, band, or border in which Mademoiselle Blanvillain (the 
directress) every year, in order to please the bigger children, has them sow wheat, 
rye, barley, oats, hemp, and flax. These plants, which the children are pleased to 
watch in their growth, furnish topies for interesting and profitable lessons. 
“ As the useful should be united with the agreeable, a number of blooming plants 
surround the border, planted in boxes and in pots. It is difficult to imagine the 
care and attention the children bestow on their little garden. The largest ones water 
the plants and weed the beds, and if, accidentally, one of the smaller children would 
touch a plant, they quickly interfere, though with much gentleness and politeness. 
“Last spring when there were many violets, Mademoiselle Blanvillain, in order to 
please the older children, gave them permission to gather each a little bouquet of a 
limited number of flowers and leaves. It is impossible to describe the joy of all 
these children. In ashort time all had adorned themselves with these bouquets, yet 
not one had taken one violet more than his comrades. This, however, ceases to be 
astonishing when one remembers the lessons of morals which we give daily and in 
every connection, and in which we seek to ineuleate a-sense of diligence, of honesty, 
and duty. 
“Tf have laid so much stress on the arrangement and charms of our school it was 
done in order to show that our dear country is concerned not only with efforts to 
enlighten and increase the intelligence of her children, but would procure them all 
necessary comforts and pleasure like a loving and devoted mother. 2 
“Yesterday, at 7 o’clock, the school was opened and children began to arrive, each 
bringing a small basket with provisions, such as bread, some beverage, and dessert 
* for the noon meal. On their arrival they handed to one of the teachers 2 sous which 
an ever watchful mother had carefully wrapped in a piece of paper or tied in a cor- 
ner of the handkerchief. They receivedin return a copper check, furnished-with a 
string; this they fastened themselves to their baskets. For the 2 sous the children 
received food, varying each day, and suited to the season. Yesterday the bill of fare 
consisted of beef broth, beef, and preserved fruit. After handiug over their money 
the children went to play freely in the courtyard, waiting for the opening of the 
class room. (In winter they wait in the reception hall (préaw), and one of the 
teachers has them sing or go through with some movements suited to their age and 
owe;r.) 
x “At half past 9 they were called into the préau, where each teacher inspected ner 
respective pupils with reference to their cleanliness. Then they entered the class 
room, marching in step and singing, in order to begin the day gaily and their work 
with zest. - 
  
Mn the Révue Pedagogique of December, 1889, Madame Kergomard says that there aremany localities . where the mothers of from 50 per cent to 80 per cent of the children who attend the école ‘maternelle could keep their children at home withont inconvenience to themselves. In some cases this percentage rises cven higher, as at Cahors, where of an average attendance of 330 children there are not ten whose mothers work away from home, there being no factories in that city and scarcely any indigence. 2 Préau, originally a covered play ground, has gradually come to be a combination of vestibule cloak room, eating rom, toilet room, and assembly room, Frequently, indeed, these various departments are separated from each other by partitions, breaking up the original préaw into several rooms,

“Quickly to work, now; time is precious, was exclaimed. The younger ones read 
at the blackboard, the more advanced studied a lesson from a book. At 10 o’clock 
the books were put away; the time for writing had come. Each child took from its 
little compartment a slate and pencil, and copied as faithfully as possible the letters 
written on the blackboard by the teacher, while she passed through the ranks en- 
couraging some, writing model letters for others, correcting bad postures. 
“At half past 10 all the slates were put away. At a given signal the children 
formed in ranks, and singing marched out to the playground. One might have 
taken them for a flock of sparrows set at liberty; for whoever has worked well can 
play vigorously, and this our young pupils never fail to do. 
“At 11 o’clock the whistle was sounded, the children again formed in ranks, and 
returned to the classroom for a new lesson. It treated of the human body in gen- 
eral and of its different parts. I asked many questions and did all I could to enable 
the children to find the answers in order to stimulate indolent intellects. After ex- 
plaining everything, I had two children repeat all that had been said. Then, as 
nothing should be left undone to lift the soul of the children to Him who is Father 
of all, ‘T showed them how grateful they ought to be to God who endowed us so per- 
fectly, and that in order to thank Him it was our duty to take good care of our body 
and to preserve it in health and cleanliness. 
“This lesson closed at half past 11, and with it the work of the morning had 
reached its close. The children left the room and were conducted to the closets. 
Subsequently those who take their meals at the school returned to the préau in line 
for their meals. Here they assembled around the tables, on which are arranged 
bowls with soup. During the meal two hired women busied themselves helping the 
little ones. After the soup each child was given a piece of meat and a piece of 
bread covered with fruit preserves. A special school fund, called caisse des écoles,' 
renders it possible to furnish indigent children the same food as their comrades, and 
without pay on the part of their parents. 
“At half past 12 the meal was over; the children went to the playground, where 
the children take up and abandon a great variety of games with the fickleness 
characteristic of childhood. At half past 1 they reassembled in the préau, they were 
inspected as to cleanliness, and then entered the classroom in order. 
“The arithmetic lesson was taken up. After a few very simple operations in addi- 
tion and subtraction the teacher gave them some easy problems on things with 
which the children are familiar, or which were before their eyes. These they are ex- 
pected to solve mentally and as promptly as possible, Like all the others, this lesson 
occupies thirty minutes. Subsequently they resumed their readers and carried on 
the exercise in the manner of the morning lesson. 
“At half past 2 the children again returned to the playground and resumed the 
interrupted games. This short recreation of only about thirty minutes sufficed to 
relax the muscles and to relieve the attention of the children. At 3 o’clock anew 
lesson, this time of manual work, was begun. The children make paper sailboats, 
an dmany suceced quite well in their simple foldings and cuttings, which not only 
render the hand more nimble and skillful but develop the taste of the children. 
“After some short exhortations concerning the work and the conduct, the distri- 
bution of “good points” took place. All who were prominent by their applica- 
tion and good conduct received good-points.? At the close of the month they will 
receive in exchange for them rewards or prizes, such as playthings, books, pictures, 
etc. ‘ 
“ At the stroke of 4 the children who go home alone were dismissed in line, fur- 
nished each with his basket. 
“Those who have to wait until some one calls for them remained in the préau 
under the supervision of one of the teachers, who is expected to remain until 7 o’clock 
in summer and 6 o’clock in winter. 
«Such is the day forthe older ones. The little ones have but one hour of work in 
the morning. During this time the teacher has them read in a singing voice a few 
letters; then she has them talk. Yesterday they repeated a short fable, entitled 
‘T have the cross.’ This very simple and very short piece is readily learned. 
  
1 The caisse des écoles originated in 1849 in associations formed by some companies of the national 
‘uard in some Parisian goers for the purpose of aiding in the education of poor children. In 1867 
these associations wero legalized, and the law of 1882 rendered them obligatory in every commune. 
‘The revenue results from assessments, gifts, legacies, and the like, and in some cases the state aids 
these funds directly. They furnish indigent children not only with clothing, books, school material, 
and money, but rewards and prizes. ney, aid not only in the school meals, but in the outfit of school 
cadets and of vacation trips and of school colonies. In 1875-'76 in Paris and the Department of the 
Seine the receipts of these institutions amounted to 343,500 francs, and in 1887-88 to 1,030,800 franes. 
Surely this is a public charity, administered in a manner most commendable and rerehy OF imitation. 
See call the attention of our patriots who would leave all such matters to the school boards to 
this example. 
20n ‘the other hand the only punishments eRe ees by law are exclusion for a very short time from 
work and common games and withdrawal of ‘‘ good points.”

very pretty designs. 
“During the remainder of the time they went through with some very simple ex- 
ercises of the limbs; they sang and took part in a number of pleasing games ar- 
ranged by the teachers.” *

V.—IPALy. 
The first impulse for popular education in Italy came from the Piarists, a religious 
order established by Joseph Calasanzio, in 1617. At the time of its foundation the 
order embraced 15 priests, who, in addition to the usual vows, had promised to 
devote themselves to the gratuitous instruction of youth. Although much hindered, 
and even persecuted, by the Jesuits, they established themselves inmany places, and 
are found even to-day, chiefly in Italy, Spain, the West Indies, Germany, and, par- 
ticularly, in Austria-Hungary. 
The first infant asylum (asilo per Vinfanzia) was established through the efforts 
of Ferranti Aporti, an Italian abbot, in the year 1829, at San Martino, near Mantua. 
His writings have done much to establish a desire for educational reform in Italy 
and for the liberal movement in Italy. Indeed, in 1848, his liberal views compelled 
him to take refuge in Turin, where he died, in 1859, as rector of the University. 
The example of San Martino was soon followed by Milan, by Turin—where Camillo 
Cavour and others founded an association for the establishment of infant asylums—- 
by Brescia, and by Mantua. 
Unfortunately the movement here, too, suffered much from the prevailing literary 
tendency of educational work and from the lack of suitably trained teachers. In 
their work the asylums followed the ideas of Pere Girard, and labored to impart all 
knowledge through the medium of the study of the maternal tongue. This work 
soon degenerated into “the literal repetition of the teacher’s words,” a “mechanical 
drill which fails to develop the pupil’s mind,” a ‘new torment which children of 
former periods had been spared.” 
A Milanese report of 1889 assertsthat Aporti foresaw thisruinous decadence of his 
work when he said, in tones of grief: “I only rarely visit the asylum now, because 
they are trying to convert it into a little university.” In its criticism of such poorly 
(asylums) special attention is given to instruction, whereas this should be subordi- 
conducted asylums this same report, prepared by Roncheti, continues: “In these 
nated to education. The excessive forcing to which the children’s intelligence is 
subjected frequently renders the intellect and reason sterile, while at the same time 
it prevents the harmonious development of thebody. Private asylums generally sin

  744 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
by stuffing the children’s memory with mystic legends, abstruse didactic precepts, 
and unintelligible poetry, ‘Their pupils excite the admiration of thoughtless people, 
yet their achievements are only the fruit of automatic drill.” 
Aporti himself, dissatisfied with these tendencies of the asylums, requested the 
Government to send a suitable person to Switzerland and Germany to study the kin- 
dergartens whose fame had reached him. Asaconsequence it b6came more and more 
evident that only Froebel’s method could bring true life into these asylums, and the 
efforts of philanthropic educators were chiefly in this direction: 
At the same time the attention of the Government was drawn more and more to 
these asylums. The ministerial regulations of 1860 empower school inspectors to 
visit infant asylums and accord to persons furnished with an elementary teacher's 
license the privilege to teach in these institutions. The regulations of 1862 urged 
school inspectors not to neglect visiting these asylums in their tours of inspection. 
In 1867 were published the conditions that entitle asylums to subsidies from the state. 
A notable change of name occurred. in 1880. Whereas heretofore in official docu- 
ments the name asili @’infanzia (infant asylums) had been used, we meet henceforth 
the name giardini d’infanzia (child garden), indicative of the full recognition of 
Froebel’s method. The regulations of 1880, which brought this change, made it the 
duty of normal school students to take a course of practical exercises in a kinder- 
garten (giardino @infanzia), and decreed that, in order to teach in an infant’s school, 
the candidate must show that she had taken a three years’ course in a kindergarten. 
A ministerial circular, dated in September, 1885, gives very particular instructions 
concerning the practical exercises of pupil teachers in kindergartens, and the report 
made by Superintendent Gioda to Minister Boselli in 1889 says: ‘‘I am firmly con- 
vinced that not until every normal school shall possess a kindergarten may we hope 
to place infant instruction on a solid foundation.” 
In April, 1889, Minister Boselli issued a circular, in which it is clearly stated that 
the asylums are no longer to be considered as places of refuge for the poor, but as 
educational institutions, in-which is laid the foundation for future instruction; nor 
are they to be confounded with the school for which they prepare the children. For 
the sake of promoting the improvement of these asylums, the minister ordered the 
holding of conferences by competent men in which teachers should be made familiar 
with correct principles of infant training; and, with the same object in view, he 
‘declared that the subsidies of the state henceforth would be conceded only to asy- 
lums which already followed the new methods (of Froebel), or which could show 
that they were prepared to introduce the needed improvements in their work. 
In order to render these conferences truly efficacious, model-work was presented 
and opportunity afforded for observing the practical work of excellent teachers. 
During the same year there were held nineteen such conferences, attended by 3,000 
teachers, 
From statistics presented in the report of Mr. Gioda, I take the following interest- 
ing notes concerning the growth and development of these schools: In 1862 there 
were 1,673 infant asylums, of which 373 were public, attended by 71,054 children, 
and taught by 2,287 teachers. In 1884 there were 2,035 asylums, of which 1,433 were 
public, attended by 229,510 children, and taught by 5,330 teachers. 
In 1889 there were 2,118 asylums, with 268,954 children taught in 5,676 rooms. 
Of these 2,118 asylums, only 328 were of the old Aporti pattern; the remainder fol- 
lowed Froebel’s methods, more or less; chiefly less, it would seem, inasmuch as 
reading and writing was still followed in 1,858 of these schools. Of the 268,954 
children attending these schools, 80,480 were less than 4 years old; 154,912 were be- 
tween the ages of 4 and 6; the remainder were over 6 years old. 
With excellent tact the report to which I owe most of these statements attaches 
little value to the efforts to reconcile the Aporti and Froebel systems in the so-called 
mixed system. ‘In many of these mixed asylums,” the reporter says, ‘‘the mne- 
tonic exercises are excessive and are added to reading and writing. The error has 
always the same cause; it arises from an effort to transform the asylumintoa school. 
All the evil lies here, inasmuch as it is impossible to imagine two institutions more 
different in their make-up. The mixing of the programme of one elementary school 
with that of another is already a great evil atin with the order in which the 
cognitions are to be learned; but it grows a thousand fold in the case mentioned 
above, because the disturbance extends to the very root of mental development. 
Who has ever had the courage to assert that a child of 4 or 5 years can understand 
the infinity of things with which their memory may be crammed? Before teaching the 
child the arts of reading and writing, itis the chief duty of the educator to give the 
greatest possible attention to the cultivation of its senses and the rational direction 
of its natural instincts. The principle of intuition of Pestalozzi and the principle 
of productive work of Froebel, however, are of wonderful efficacy in the asylums. 
It is well established that unless the child has attained the proper age it isnot well 
that he should learn the things which are taught in school; he has above all things 
need of motion, air, and light,”

  Much, too, is made in Italy of real gardens in connection with the infants’ schools. 
- Of the 2,118 asylums in 1889, 886 were provided with gardens. To us these appear 
most gratifying when contrasted with the labor-hating and sun-shunning Ameri- 
ean kindergartens, to which the ‘‘garden” is a myth, symbolized occasionally in 
a few sickly pot-plants. But the thoughtful Gioda deplores that so few of the 
asylums are thus blessed. With the help of the garden, the child learns the lesson 
that he who does not sow shall not reap; grows fairly into respect for property, 
love of his neighbor and charity, love of work, and helpful kindliness. 
Much is being done, too, to secure well-prepared teachers. The conferences con- 
ducted by competent men and women have been mentioned. In addition an excel- 
lent normal school for the preparation of kindergartners has been in operation for a 
number of years at Naples, under the patronage of Madame Salis-Schwabe. Of this 
we shall speak more in detail further on. Another such school was established 
at Verona a few years ago, and a third at Rome last year. If to these we join the 
facts that good kindergartens have been established or are about to be established 
in connection with all normal schools for elementary teachers, and that all ele- 
mentary teachers are expected to take a course of kindergarten training, we may 
well look upon Italy as the land of hope. 
Nevertheless, much still remains to be done. Of 5,119 teachers in 1889, only 2,109 
were licensed; 3,050 had had no preparation or, at any rate, were without licenses of 
any sort. Of these teachers 1,878 belonged to religious orders, 3,241 were lay teachers. 
The report prophesies that the number of lay teachers will increase in the measure 
in which the importance of kindergartens or asylums will be recognized, and inti- 
mates that the retention of the teachers belonging to religious orders is due chiefly 
to the fact that they cost less. 
In many. asylums the regular teacher is assisted by young women who watch over 
the children while she is engaged in the work of teaching one of the sections. These 
assistants, according to the report of Gioda, ‘are generally without culture and 
without licenses of any kind; in many regions they speak, with the children, the local 
dialect, themselves knowing no other, and thus waste mucl precious time that would 
be used in the acquisition of the Italian language.” Among the evils of this system 
the report mentions the immobility to which the children are condemned, since the 
chief business of these assistants is to keep the children, who are not being taught at 
the time, from talking or moving about. 
In similar spirit the report condemns the employment of uncultured servants, who 
receive the children in the morning, stay'with them at lunch time, and attend to 
their various needs. For this purpose, too, Gioda would employ -persons of gentle 
manners and graceful speech. 
The ideal placed before Italian asylums is surely satisfactory. It requires ample, 
well lighted and ventilated, scrupulously clean roonis, the walls ornamented with 
charts representing facts of life, an ample playground, a large and carefully culti- 
vated garden. The progress in this direction seems to be encouraging. It is true 
that of the 2,118 asylums in 1889 more than one-half, or 1,303 asylums, were in satis- 
factory rooms and localities; in 1,002 the didactic material was satisfactory, and 
in 1,091 the seating was good. On the other hand, 1,309 still had their benches ar- 
ranged in gallery style. ; 
In 1,232 of the asylums a light lunch is served, consisting of vegetables, fruit, and 
bread. This is furnished free to poor children; others pay a small monthly fee. 
The numbers of hours during which the children are kept in the asylums vary from 
two to five daily. The latter number prevails where the asylums are treated as 
schools. In the majority of these the children are kept seated for two long hours 
each half day. Yet these evils, too, gradually yield before the intelligent efforts to 
establish true kindergarten ways in these institutions. 
The cost of the asylums during the year 1889 was about 6,000,000 lire, an average 
of a little over 20 lire per child; but there:is constant, and successful pressure to 
increase this and to raise the character of the asylums accordingly. 
‘The supervision over the asylums is in the hands of committees consisting of coun- 
selors, inspectresses, and a physician. It is peculiarly gratifying to notice the promi- 
menee etven to inspection of these institutions byladies. This fact alone will here, 
as well as in France and Belgium, insure constant progress of the work in the right 
direction and render it more and more truly educative. 
The report of Mr. Gioda further recommends that the care of the asylums of Italy 
be made the exclusive concern of one official connected with the ministry of public 
instruction, and that four inspectresses be detailed to aid him in his work. : 
Among the various provinces of Italy, Milan is most thoroughly committed to the 
work of infant education. In this province of 1,200,000 inhabitants there are over 
200 asylums, 109 of which are the work of public charity. They are attended by 
20,000 children, and employ 360 teachers and 180 servants. é, 
‘The method followed in these asylums is ‘‘ mixed,” yet with a decided tendency to 
follow the principles of Froebel. It aims, in the words of Superintendent A. Ron-
-P-A-G-E-98
  746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
choti, “to secure the development of the physical, intellectual, and moral faculties 
of the child, in order to enable it to find by its own efforts the first knowledge of the 
true, to experience the free aspirations of the beautiful, and to dispose it in its feel- 
ings and in deeds to practice the good. * * * Itengages the child in simple 
exercises which serve to develop its natural faculties, placing it in the helpful envi- 
ronment of that small world of objects which invites it to explore spontaneously 
_ what there is and what is done in real life. These exercises are made with the 
help of the varied supply of objects which constitute a characteristic feature of the 
Milanese asylums. In some of these the children are exercised even in manual work, 
in the work of the field, of the orchard, and of the garden; borrowing as much as 
possible from the Froebel system without, however, transforming the Italian insti- 
tutions into German kindergartens.” 
Yor manual work Swedish woodwork (Sléjd) has been rejected as being too ex- 
clusively utilitarian, tending to the trades. On the other hand, clay and cardboard 
are used extensively and quite systematically. By this means “the child does not 
learn a trade, but its interests are directed to practical life and to a knowledge of 
ape things. Thus it acquires knowledge, acquires firmness of will, learns 
to love work.” - 
On the whole, it seems that the work has an upward tendency. Yet one of my 
most honored and clear-sighted correspondents writes me: ‘‘You will find that these 
infants’ schools are known as asylums, although efforts are being made to introduce 
into them the occupations and plays of Froebel. Considering the spirit in which 
these asylums are conducted, they scarcely, however, deserve a different name, inas- 
much as the chief effort still is to make prodigies. This fault reigns supreme in all 
infants’ schools, and the pedagogic maxim that bids us follow the slow and syste- 
mutic march of nature is only a fashionable phrase which no one would seriously put 
in practice.” 
Great help, however, in this respect is radiating from the Frocbel Institute, estab- 
lished at Naples through the efforts of Madame Salis-Schwabe. In 1861 Garibaldi, 
~ convinced that an education that might elevate the people could be established only 
with the coéperation of women, issued.an. address to the women of Italy, in which oc- 
curred the following words: “I have that profound faith in the kindly disposition of 
Italian women of all classes that I venture to address them and to invite them to 
realize this noble end (of removing the immense gulf that separates the poor from 
the rich). In the hundred cities of Italy let there be formed committees of ladies 
with the object of collecting means of every kind in Italy and other parts of the 
world to assist the needy and to establish schools for their education.” 
In answer to this appeal there was formed at Turin the “Italian Ladies’ Philan- 
thropic Society,” of which the Marchioness Anna Pallavicino Trivulzio was made 
president. These ladies issued a “programme,” in which they declared it to be their 
intention to establish: “(1) Ragged schools; (2) provident societies; (3) institutions 
for destitute orphan daughters of the Italian liberators.” A special letter was ad- 
dressed to Madame Salis-Schwabe, a Neapolitan lady of wealth and philanthropic 
fervor, at her English home, in which she was urged to appeal for aid to “our En- 
glish sisters.” ‘ 
Madame Schwabe entered into the work with great energy, and in a short time 
raised a fund of £3,000 and a two years’ annual subscription of £400. With the help 
of this money she established, under the guidance of Miss Reeve, an English lady, 
an elementary school.at Naples in the-same year. In 1865 Miss Reeve died, a victim 
to the cholera. The school was closed until a fit successor to Miss Reeve could be 
found. In the winter of 1871 Madame Schwabe went to Rome and Naples and suc- 
ceeded in obtaining from the city of Naples the gift of part of an old monastery for 
~ her work. When, however, she was ready to resume the school, through some 
change in the officials the building was withheld. At this juncture the Italian Goy- 
_ ernment came to her aid, placed at her disposal the sum of 24,000 lire, and consigned 
to her use in 1873.a large Government building, the former Collegio Medico, for a 
term of three years, the grant to be renewed every three years, as long as the school 
should continue to flourish. In 1876 the grant was:made for thirty years, because of 
the success in the work. In 1884 the growth of the institution called for additional 
rooms, and she was enabled to supply this with the aid of an extra subsidy of 50,000 
lire by the Italian Government. In 1887 the institution was constituted by royal 
decree into.a corporate body, with the title Instituto Frébeliano Internazionale Vit- 
torio Emanuele JI. On this occasion the building was granted the institution 
forever, with an annual subsidy of 12,400 lire from the Government. In addition 
to this, the institution enjoys other subsidies from various corporations at Naples, 
and the interest-of an endowment of 50,000 lire, secured through Madame Schwabe. 
The institution consists of a popular school and .aschool for the wealthier classes. 
The latter is made up of a kindergarten in three divisions, a transition class, four 
elementary classes, a higher school of five classes, and a Froebel'seminary for the 
training of teachers on Frocbel’s system. In the kindergarten boys and girls are  
-P-A-G-E-99

educated together; in the elementary schools they are separated. The boys leave 
the school in their eleventh or twelfth year; as girls, however, continue their 
studies in the ‘‘higherschool.” After passing a Government examination in their sev- 
enteenth or eighteenth year, they may enter the training college for teachers. This 
college also receives girls from other schools, provided they hold a Government license 
as teachers. 
The three upper classes are taught by leading professors, All the other classes are 
under lady teachers, all of whom must be familiar with Froebel’s principles and 
method. The institution at present numbers 1,100 pupils, of whom 450 belong to the 
popular school. 
The popular school consists of a kindergarten of three classes, a transition class for 
Loys and one for girls, each followed by three elementary classes. The 180 children 
of the kindergartens are served a plate of warm soup at noon. The kindergarten 
work is under the supervision of Madame de Portugall, whose work at Geneva and 
whose synoptical table at kindergarten occupations have world-wide fame. The 
presidency of the institution is in the hands of Prof. Trinchese. 
The popularity and growth of the institution will appear when these notices are 
compared with the original status of the institution. ‘In 1873 the kindergarten was 
opened with 24 children of both sexes, and the elementary school with 16 pupils. In 
1877 the normal department was opened with 8 pupils. : 
To the courtesy of Madame de Portugall and her accomplished kindergartners, 
Silvia Brassiello, Elvira Cerboni, and Carusio Elminda, I owe the detailed description 
of the work of the three kindergarten classes appended to this report. » 
APPENDIX. 
DETAILS OF THE WORK OF THE KINDERGARTEN OF THE FROEBEL INSTITUTE AT NAPLES. 
First class. 
Everybody knows that Froebel established the kindergarten in order to assist the 
mother in the fulfillment of her many and varied duties, and in order to supplement 
the education of the family, which, alone, can not secure for the child the environ- 
ment necessary, as says Montaigne, to teach him the art of living. 
The sphere of his affections should grow, and he should learn to respect the rights 
of others and follow the dictates of duty. 
Furthermore, the kindergarten affords the child opportunities to manifest his 
whole being, to enjoy the advantages of social intercourse with his equals, children 
of his own age, and to develop harmoniously. Thus the kindergarten complements 
thé family and furnishes a normal environment in which the child may pass profit- 
ably a few hours of the day. 
In order to comply with the growing requirements of the child our kindergarten 
is divided into three classes: The first, for children 3 to 4 years old; the second, 4 to 
5 years; the third, 5 to 6 years. From this third class the children enter the school. 
Each class has its own peculiar complexion in accordance with the age of the chil- 
dren, but the spirit of the class is that of the teacher. Naturally the first class, 
more than the others, preserves the tone of the family. Here there is merriment, 
joy, and festivity without end. The occupations are simple, elementary, and always 
alternating with songs, games, and other diversions. However, everything is 
grouped as much as possible about a common subject, so that the child may gradu- 
ally learn to concentrate his attention upon a certain group of facts. A certain sub- “ 
ject is chosen, either with the help of a story, or of a stanza of poetry, or of a pic- 
pate and all the occupations serve to illustrate, to represent, and to explore the 
subject. 
The story should be short, clear, animated, and the children should take part init, 
not only listening but imitating in play the movement in point. How easy is it by 
means of well-chosen stories to influence the judgment and the moral development 
of the little audience which is deeply interested and shows ready sympathy, lives 
with its heroes, and takes partin the various scenes in a whole-souledmanner. Still 
more efficacious and captivating are these stories, if they accord with surrounding 
natere, the seasons, and localevents. Such a story furnishes material for an entire 
week. A 
THE FROZEN, BIRD, 
Little Mary lived in a nice little house. She hada sweet little room all for herself with a window from which she eould look out into a large garden. Directly opposite, at a short distance from the window, there was a high tree, in which, during the summer, many little birds built their nests. One day it turned very cold, and the frost lasted for several days; Mary frequently looked out at her tree, for every day it lost more and more of its leaves which had already turned quite yellow.
-P-A-G-E-100
  748 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
It rained constantly, and one day, to her great surprise when she stepbed to the window, she saw 
that the tree and the window sill were covered with snow. She opened the window, inorder to scatter, 
as usual, crumbs of bread for the little birds that lived in the tree. But, what did she see? A poor 
little bird with its eyes closed, and quite cold. ‘Poor little bird!” she exclaimed, taking it in her 
little hand, and breathing upon it in order to warmit. Then she ran to mammacrying, “ Look, mam- ma, what I have found! I fear it is dead." And her mamma went immediately to get some cotton, 
with which she made a soft warm nest for the poor little bird. Gradually the little bird began to get 
warm and opened its little eyes. ‘Then it began to eat, and at last to hop around the room. Little Mary, full of joy, ran to get a cage, put the little bird in it, saying, “Now this will be your little house, and I shall be your little mamma, for it is cold out of doors, and it rains.” From that 
day he was little Mary’s friend. Every morning he woke her with his song, and Mary from her little bed wished him “good morning.” After the winter came the spring. ‘The trees began to put forth new leaves, and the little birds 
began to build nests among the branches. But Mary’s little friend was still in his cage. Heheard 
the songs of the other birds and saw them fiying about. He, too, would have liked to be with them in the open air, and he became sad and stopped singing. Mary noticed this, and one beautiful day she opened the cage, gave a last kiss to the little bird and let him fly away. The happy little bird flew to 
the tree opposite the window and there Dogan to sing with all his might. - Every morning after that he pecked at the window to greet his little Mary. 
After the story the children imitate the little birds in their games. When they 
return to their tables they build with cubes and bricks the little bed in which Mary 
slept, the window on which the little bird was found, the garden ‘and the tree cov- 
ered with snowflakes are made in the sand table. The little balls are made to fly 
like the little birds; they are caught in the hands, as Mary did the little bird, etc. 
Thus every occupation is related in some way to the little story. 
The various occupations may be seen in the time-table, which, however, is subject 
to all kinds of occasional variations, depending on the seasons, on. the events of 
daily life, and on the phenomena of nature. 
The chief purpose of the teacher should be to make the children happy, to lead 
theminsensibly to the good and to secure the natural development of their natures.

Second class. 
The majority of the children of my class were prepared in the first class. Hence 
. they are led much in the same manner, especially during the first part of the scholastic 
year. 
I aim, above all, to make my children happy and good, and as I notice their powers 
growing I require more prolonged attention, greater precision in the work, more 
promptness of obedience, indeed, progress in every respect. 
The garden with its flowers, with the plants, with the animals, and the fountain, 
furnish material for the subject of the week, which is introduced much in the same 
manner as in the first class, but at every point tending to lift the children to the 
higher plane of the third class. 
Furthermore, I seek to make the children familiar with industrial life, more par- 
ticularly with the arts and trades that affect their own existence, in order to get them 
_ to feel their dependence and to awaken in their hearts the sentiment of gratitude. 
Certain occupations, too difficult for the first part of the year, I take up after 
New Year or toward Easter. This is the case with drawing and perforating, which 
require a steady hand and greater attention. 
‘The gymnastic games are carried on in this class more systematically. Thus in 
marching I aim to secure more precision and agility in the movements. To this are 
added the ball games in the open air. This does not exclude, however, the free run- 
ning and playing in the garden which affords me an opportunity to observe my 
children and to study their temperaments. 
In the proper season there is added the occupation of gardening, which is much 
“enjoyed by the children, and affords opportunities for observing the development of 
the common herbs and vegetables. Finally, by means of the observation of nature, 
I seek to lead the children gradually to the recognition of the Creator, to lead them 
to love Him and to be thankful to Him.

Third class. 
In his kindergarten, Frocbel has created_an environment where the child can de- 
velop harmoniously its physical, moral, and intellectual powers. 
I. The gymnastic exercises, the games, songs, the free plays in the garden 
strengthen the physical powers of the child, and secure to him that condition or 
health so indispensable to his normal development. 
II. Love is a fountain which must be reached in the education of the child. All 
in the kindergarten is love; love of the teacher for the children, of the children 
among themselves, and for their other mamma. This love should extend to all 
within the reach of these little ones and find fresh food in intercourse with nature. 
To let, the child live in nature is one of Froebel’s fundamental ideas, 
To make the flowers speak, as well as the bird and its little ones, and the meanest 
worm, to endow them with a soul, with affections and feelings, while the child is 
near, so that he may love and respect them—this is the great secret. 
The world of the little child should teem with love, and he is happy when, with 
the teacher’s help, he apprehends this life. Respectful and loving intercourse with 
nature are, then, the cardinal points of the child’s moral education. He becomes 
good through contact with nature. This is true everywhere; but has especial value 
for our city of Naples, where as a rule there is little interest in nature and little 
sympathy for lower animals. s 
II. All the occupations, in a general way, strengthen and develop the intellectual 
faculties. In the work with these the teacher should proceed from the easy to the 
difficult, without leaps, without omission, so that each new knowledge may be pre- 
pared by its predecessor. Itis needful, besides, to present to the child known objects, 
to enlarge the number of the sensations he receives from these objects, so that he 
may form accurate perceptions. 
All teaching should tend to establish habits of order, of accuracy, of neatness, 
and nourish in the child the sentiments of the beautiful and the good. In his work 
the child should experience a sense of gratification that makes him love his work. 
In his occupations the child is, at first, directed by the teacher; subsequently he 
invents for himself. In this lies the chief value of the occupation; for it is creative 
work that gives strength of mind and engages all its powers, and enables it to feel, 
as it were, its own value. 
My class, being the third of the kindergarten, forms the bridge from the kinder- 
garten to the school. Here the children are to be prepared to become good scholars, 
Hence, certain occupations become more important than others. Such are drawing, 
number and language exercises, the discussion of objects, and preparation for 
writing. * 
The eae oeations tend to enlarge the ideas, to increase the knowledge of the child, » 
as well as to give him conscious control of his speech. Having selected asubject of 
conversation, I let the children make many short sentences aboutit. If I have 
spoken, for instance, of a dog whom I named Fido, I let the children tell me all that 
Fido can do. ‘Fido eats; Fido drinks; etc.” I let the children see clearly that 
when I say Fido sleeps, I do not mean that he runs; and that when I call Fido, I do 
not mean Julius. Iaim to impress upon the children that each word corresponds 
with a thing, an action, etc., and that everything has its own name, 
When they have appreciated the full word, I let them break it up in syllables, and 
finally in these various syllables I let them find the various sounds, leaving to the 
school the work of continuing this study on the synthetic side. 
Of equal importance are the first number exercises from 1 to 10, always in ‘the 
form of play, and keeping away fray all abstract work. 
I let my children count numbers of things. These exercises constitute mental 
gymnastics, and of much value if care is taken to avoid premature considerations of 
abstract work. 
I add to these general remarks a time-table which will show how the various sub- 
jects are distributed.

VI—ENGLAND. 
The first deliberate efforts in behalf of infant education in England date back to 
the philanthropic work of Robert Owen at New Lanark. For the benefit of the poor 
people whose interests he had made his own, he established in connection with his 
-schools a preparatory department or ‘‘ training school,” to which children were ad- 
mitted at the age of 3. Here they were ‘‘perpetually superintended to prevent 
their acquiring bad habits, to give them good ones, and to form their dispositions to 
mutual kindness and a sincere desire to contribute all in their power to benefit each 
other.” The first teacher.employed by Robert Owen in this work was Buchanan. 
Buchanan’s work attracted general attention, and in 1819 he was called to West- 
minster, where he established a similar school under the auspices of Brougham, 
James Mill, Macaulay, and others. 
Tn 1820 a similar school was opened at Spitalfields and placed in charge of Wil- 
derspin. Wilderspin was an educational genius. To him. is due the name infant 
school, as well as the general and abiding impetus to the work which led to the es- . 
tablishment of the Home and Colonial Infant School Society, and made infant train- 
- ing a prominent feature of the work of the British and Foreign School Society. 
The Home and Colonial Infant School Society was founded in 1836 for the purpose 
of improving and extending the existing system of infant schools. With the aid of 
Miss Mayo and Robert Dunning they accomplished much good. They sent into the 
field many well-trained teachers; they arrested the further growth of the “prodigy 
system” of precocious forcing, which was making sad havoc of child-like modesty 
and innocence; they placed their work broadly on Pestalozzianism ; they established 
the practice ot grading children for purposes of instruction, and abolished the gal- 
lery system, and banished arbitrariness and bitterness from their modes of discipline. 
In the course of time they admitted some kindergarten practices into their work, but 
left the honor of establishing the full kindergarten to the older British and Foreign 
School Society. z 
‘This society had been established in 1808 as an outcome of efforts on the part of a 
number of philanthropists to aid Joseph Lancaster in his efforts to establish free 
schools, i. ¢., schools ‘‘open to all, without distinction of sect or party.” To this 
purpose the society has faithfully adhered to this day. Indeed, the development of 
popular education in Great Britain is largely, if not wholly, the work of this society. 
The names of Brougham and Graham, of Althorp and Russell, of Forster and Mun- 
della, are prominently connected with its labors. 
_ In order to accomplish its object, the society maintained a number of central 
model and experimental schools; established colleges for the training of teachers; 
employed agents and inspectors whose duty it was ‘‘to visit and inspect British 
schools, confer with local committees, aid in the establishment of new schools, de- 
liver lectures, hold parents’ meetings, and in various ways help forsvard the work of 
popular education”; supplied schoolbooks and school material, and kept.a watchful 
eye to aid sound educational development. . ° 
In the fall of 1874, Sir Charles Reed, acting under the society’s instructions, en- 
gaged Miss Eleanor Heerwart to inaugurate the kindergarten work in the Stockwell 
‘Training College. In addition to the classes of senior and junior students, a class was 
formed for teachers, meeting once a week, and a class for pupil-teachers, four times 
a week; a specimen kindergarten was established, the children being taught two” 
hours each Saturday morning. (Seventieth Report.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS, 751 
The soil had been well prepared for the favorable reception of really good work. 
Miss Barton, Madame Michaelis, Miss Manning, Madame de Portugall, Prof. Payne, 
and others had already done much to show the value of the kindergarten. Miss Heer- 
wart herself had successfully conducted a kindergarten in Dublin since 1862, and had ~ 
proved her unusual ability as a teacher and.as an apostle of Froebel in many other 
ways. x a 
Rev. J. R. Byrne, one of the inspectors of the British and Foreign School Society, 
had given special attention to “the value of the kindergarten system as a means of 
education in infant schools.” He had reported concerning it in terms of unqualified 
approval. “Notwithstanding its foreign name,” he says in his report, “there is no 
‘fad’ or gammon about it whatever. It is as English, common-sense, practical, as 
they could wish it to be who prize these qualities above everything else. I natu- 
rally, as an inspector, value highly whatever conduces most to making children ‘pass’ 
in the standards, and I find that this kind of thing makes them pass. Not only do 
they become brighter and happier under it, but their progress in ordinary school- 
work is all the more sure and rapid.” 
The work under Miss Heerwart’s direction proved so prosperous that in 1876 per- 
manent premises had to be provided, and additional kindergarten classes were 
established. In 1882 there were five such classes, two kindergartens proper, one 
“transition class,” and two advanced ‘‘kindergarten school” classes. The society’s 
report for this year says that ‘those who have visited either of the kindergartens 
and seen the life and happiness and progress of the children will not need to be 
assured that the experiment bas been successful.” The same report congratulates 
the society on the fact that the ‘‘education department, whose vice-president has 
more than onee seen something of the work at Stockwell, has introduced into the 
code a clause requiring that infant schools must make provision for ‘appropriate 
and varied occupations’ in order to obtain the next grant.” 
At the same time the executive committee reported that ‘‘no better use could be 
made of the new college at Saffron Walden than for the training of infant school- 
mistresses on kindergarten principles. ” 
In 1883 Miss Heerwart retired from her work, The Stockwell kindergarten estab- 
lishment was strong enough to be transferred to private hands, and the society was 
enabled to give its entire attention in this direction to the new Saffron Walden 
Training College. Up to July, 1883, 42 students had received practical training in 
a two years’ course, besides 47 others who had received a partial course, and 92 
mothers, nurses, and acting teachers who had attended the evening classes. (Sev- 
enty-ninth Report.) 
The last distribution of certificates to students who had successfully finished their 
two years’ course at the Stockwell college was made the occasion of most gratify- 
ing testimony to Miss Heerwart’s efficiency. The certificates were presented by Mrs, 
Forster, Dr. Arnold’s daughter, and Matthew Arnold gave words to her gratification. 
Mr. Alfred Bourne presented Miss Heerwart with a beautifully illuminated address of 
appreciation, a number of photographs, a gold watch and chain. ‘The address bore 
the signatures of Forster, Mundella, Miss Shireff, and others. Mr. Fitch had sentin 
his tribute of respect in a letter in which he attributes to the diffusion of Froebel’s 
principles by Stockwell and Miss Heerwart “the improved tone and spirit of our in- 
fant schools.” 
Nor did all these changes entail the abrogation of kindergarten work in the Stock- 
well schools. In the practicing schools of the ifstitution it continued to flourish 
under excellent teachers, and subsequently one of these took up with a number of 
students a course of instruction ‘‘in the life and principles of Froebel and the differ- 
ent branches of kindergarten work.” 
The establishment of Saffron Walden Training College is due to the munificence 
of George Stacey Gibson, who gaye the society for this purpose a site of 2 acres 
and £10,500. This sum was subsequently increased by gifts from other sources, 
The college was opened in the spring of 1884 with suitable ceremonies and dedica- 
ted to its purpose of training teachers for infant schools. It began its work with 
30 students. In 1889 it counted 50 resident students. “Of the 161 who had attended 
up to this date only 12 had left after less than two years of residence. 
Among other factors that led to the establishment of higher standards in infant 
education the London Froebel Society occupies a prominent place. I regret exceed- 
ingly that I have failed to obtain sufficient data concerning its early history. It was 
formed in 1874 ‘‘for the purpose of promoting codperation among those engaged in 
kindergarten work, of spreading the knowledge and practice of the system, and of 
maintaining a high standard of efficiency among kindergarten teachers.” 
These objects the society seeks to accomplish by lectures, discussions, public 
meetings, publications, the examination of students and the granting of certificates 
to the deserving, the inspection and registration of kindergartens, and other similar 
metliods. Miss Shireff is president of the society. Among its vice-presidents are 
Mr. Fitch, Prof. Meiklejohn, Mme. Schwabe, Miss Heerwart. From its organization

to 1890 it conferred certificates upon 219 kindergartens. In this work of examit«- 
tion of teachers it is joined by the Kindergarten Company, of Bedford, and with 
this constitutes the National Froebel Union. 
Candidates for examination must first pass a preliminary examination in the anal- 
ysis of easy sentences, in essay or letter writing, in English history, in geography, 
and arithmetic. 
Candidates who have passed this preliminary examination and who are not under 
the age of 17 may acquire the elementary certificate on passing an examination 
in the biographies, principles, and methods of Froebel and Pestalozzi; in a gen- 
eral knowledge of plants, animals, the physical facts in nature, and the simple facts 
of health; in kindergarten gifts and occupations; in music and singing; in class 
teaching and drawing. A more extended examination in geometry, algebra, physi- 
ography, physics, chemistry of common life, botany, zodlogy, music, gifts and occupa- 
tions, history of education and theory of education must, be passed in order to obtain 
the higher certificate. 
The value of this work of examination on the part of the Froebel Union seems to 
be quite generally conceded. In 1887, 73 candidates presented themselves for exam- 
ination; this number in 1888 increased to 128, and in 1889 to 169 candidates. This 
increase becomes still more significant when it is remembered that each candidate 
pays an examination fee of one guinea for the elementary and higher certificates, or 
10s. for the preliminary certificate. 
Nor are these examinations confined to kindergartners, but are more and more 
sought by elementary teachers and their employers. Since 1888 the society has fur- 
nished the Lendon school board ‘‘ an examiner in the theory of kindergarten teach- 
ing.” \ 
The society does not control the preparation of candidates for the work of examina- 
tion, yet it prefers that those who present themselves should have attended some 
properly constituted training college. Even with reference to the annual course of 
lectures held by the society, it is distinctly stated that ‘“ these lectures are intended 
to help students prepare for the elementary certificate examination, but do not dis- 
pense with the necessity of regular training and instruction in these subjects.” 
Fortunately, England is thoroughly alive to the necessity of providing infant 
schools for the children of the people. In 1874 the number of children under 6 years 
of age on the registers of the schools receiving grants from the education depart- 
ment was 617,910. In 1884 this number had risen to 841,128, an increase of 36 per 
cent in ten years. At the same rate of increase 1894 would yield a list of 1,143,924. 
Yet, inasmuch as England has just entered into the high tide of the popular educa- 
tion movement, this number will probably be very much larger. 
Fortunately, too, the kindergarten movement has been in the hands of thoughtful 
and competent persons, who, while they know how to take into account popular de- 
mands and even prejudices, know also how to keep the work steadily in the direc- 
tion of progress. Foremost among these is Rey. Alfred Bourne, the efficient secre- 
tary of the British and Foreign School Society ; Miss Eleanor Heerwart, Miss Manning, 
Miss Snell, Madame Michaelis, Mr. A. H. Sonnenschein, Miss Shireff, Miss Bayley, 
and Miss Lord. : 
While, therefore, there is much schoolishness even in the good kindergartens, 
there is throughout the Kingdom—because of the efficiency of these kindergartens in 
preparing children for the work of the school—a growing demand not only for the 
adoption of kindergarten ways and means in the infant schools, but for the employ- 
ment, in elementary schools, of teachers who are familiar with the theory of Froebel. 
The extent and character of the schoolishness in the English infants’ schools and 
kindergartens will be apparent from the time-tables published in the appendix. The 
time-tables will show the gradual inflow of the kindergarten spirit both in the in- 
fant schools and kindergartens, and clearly prophesy the coming victory of child 
nature over school or, rather, over the subject of instruction. 
The same gratifying fact is apparent from a number of utterances by leading per- 
sons. Thus in the noteworthy conference on education during the international 
health exhibition at South Kensington, in 1884, Mr. Severn, an enthusiastic admirer 
of the kindergarten, spoke in glowing terms of a star play he had witnessed ina 
South Kensington school where his own children were taught. ‘The game in ques- 
tion was called ‘Our Solar System.’ A boy, big for his age, and with a radiant 
face, represented the sun. He held a high pole in his hand at the top of which silk 
ribbons were fixed, of different lengths, to represent the relative distances of the 
planets from the sun. In reply to the question as to which planet was the nearest, 
all responded at once ‘Mercury,’ and the happy throng of about 30 or 40 children 
arranged in a circle sang a verse descriptive of the planet. A little Mercury then 
stepped up to the pole and, taking the shortest ribbon, revolved around the radiant 
orb of day. Miss W. then asked which was the next planet, and they all answered 
‘Venus’ without the slightest difficulty; his own pretty little girl revolved around 
the sun, with the next longest ribbon, in her proper orbit. Then came Earth and 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. a 753 
Mars, the latter being represented by a most valiant little boy between three and 
four years of age who was evidently determined to be a Wolseley some day. All the 
other planets revolved in the same way, each verse sung being descriptive of the 
motions of the particular planet to which it related.” 
Mr. Sonnenschein very gracefully protested, in illustration of his statement that 
the principles of Froebel were not understood, that such plays ‘were not Froebel.” 
He added that the English ‘were haunted by certain fatal prejudices.” Thus “it 
was a superstition that the child must learn the three R’s, and it was believed that 
no education could be given unless these three subjects were mastered.” 
Mr. Fitch, who presided at this meeting, observed that ‘ Froebel’s method was not 
a mechanical art which could be acquired by purchasing a shilling handbook de- 
seriptive of his methods, or by buying’a box of models. It was a philosophy, a 
theory, a principle. It required to be learned by those who had thorough sympathy 
with childhood, and who had something of the spiritof Him who said, ‘Take heed 
that ye despise not one of these little ones.’ ” 
Rey. Alfred Bourne, the efficient secretary of the British.and Foreign School 
Society, spoke as follows on the same occasion on the attitude of infant’s schools to the 
code and more particularly to the first standard prescribed for children between 7 and 
8 years of age: ‘‘Shall we,” heasks “‘ break up this standard work into a set of pre- 
liminary standards, and set the children to grind at the work for three or four years, 
‘taking time by the forelock’ (as someone has said), and ‘teaching them their pre- 
scribed tasks a little sooner, so that the tasks may become familiar by mere re- 
iteration before the children are legally called upon to repeat them? Or shall we 
postpone the staudard work altogether till certain preparation has been accomplished 
and the power has been developed which will make the work easy. I am pleading 
for the latter course, for the kindergarten as a preparation for the school. Let us 
have for the little ones happy, homelike places with plenty of room, plenty of fresh 
air, plenty of light, varied forms of beauty, and nothing ugly or slovenly, or sug- 
gestive of grossness or selfishness, or misery, gardens in which the human plants 
will grow. ‘Let us have a sufficiency of loving teachers touched with a feeling of 
childhood’s weaknesses, with hearts ‘at leisure from themselves to soothe and sympa- 
thize,’ and glowing with delight at the budding of higher nature, with minds suffi- 
ciently enriched and active to excite and satisfy the curiosity of awakening intellect. - 
Let us have organized and well directed play, so that every limb may have its exer- 
cise, and the various phenomena of nature and the occupations of the grown up peo- 
ple around may be associated with the pleasant activites of the restless and growing 
children. Let us have carefully graduated work for inquiring eyes, and listening 
ears, and busy fingers, work which shall at once awaken inquiry and satisfy the 
natural craving for results, while it teaches lessons of patience and perseverance, 
cultivates accuracy and dexterity, and rewards industry by creating new and higher 
ideals and opening new fields for exertion.” ‘ 
Even ‘‘the code” has felt the quickening influence of the kindergarten movement 
in England. It prescribes, indeed (code of 1884), ‘suitable instruction in the ele- 
mentary subjects, simple lessons on objects and the phenomena of nature and com- 
mon life,” butit adds ‘‘ appropriate and varied occupations,” and modifies in its re- 
vised instructions to inspectors the requirement as to instruction in elementary 
subjects, i.e., reading, writing, and arithmetic. 
On the whole, indeed, it appears that England is on the high-road to unusual 
success in this work. With a lofty reverence for the spiritual essence of life and for 
the claims of simple humanity, she combines a deep love of childhood and a pecul- 
iarly clear insight into the practical needs of external life. This spirit coupled with 
her newly awakened interest in popular education, assures for her a success in 
infant school teaching that will arouse the admiration and gratitude of the world. 
Froebel’s principles, educational practice, physiology and hygiene, class-teaching, 
and drawing entitle the successful candidate to a “higher certificate.” ‘The char- 
acter of these examinations may be inferred from the following sets of questions 
selected from the papers presented in 1889:

APPENDIX B. 
Paper read before the Froebel Society, London, by Miss E. A. Manning, May 11, 1889. 
THE KINDERGARTEN IN INDIA. 
One proof of the soundness of Froebel’s principles of education lies in the fact that 
they have been found practically useful in the training of children of various nationsand 
ofvariousraces. The experimentmadeinaretired German village had withinit such 
wise elements that it has extended itself with succéss.not only into many countries 
of Europe and into America, but also to the East. At the Health Exhibition a few 
years ago we found that some of the little Japanese children share at least the in- 
terest of Froebel’s occupations, and I wish to bring before you this evening some 
indications that his healthy natural system is beginning to be appreciated in India. 
Because Froebel observed children faithfully—and it is for his having done this, and 
having told us what he observed, that we owe him endless gratitude—it followed as a 
matter of course that the German villagers Gretchen and Hiinslein could not be the 
only children to profit by his discoveries. For boys and girls under 6 years old are 
very like each other all over the globe. Everywhere they have same eagerness to 
investigate as to what sort of a world they haveentered. The same clinging depend- 
ence on their elders, the same impulse to test their new powers, the same sociability, 
the same faults, the same charm, the same method of development. Therefore, the 
German teacher and philosopher, while guiding the mothers of his own valleys, was 
really counseling mothers and teachers in countries and epochs far distant from his 
own. 
It is true that there are hereditary differences, and differences due to variety in 
surroundings, which are noticeable even in the earliest stages of a child’s life. 
National characteristics show their mark even before children can talk. Onerace of 
people is more active than another, one more vindictive, one more thoughtful, one 
has more delight in the beautiful, and as the phases of life in an individual are in- 
dissolubly linked together from beginning to end, such peculiar qualities exhibit 
themselves from the first. But Froebel’s principles include so much width of ap- 
plication, they have such elasticity as well as strength, he looked so fully at 
human nature through the German villager’s nature, that these differences can be 
met and dealt with easily. And after all even a dozen English children have al- 
most as much variety of temperament and of tendency as if they were children of 
several nationalities. Jroebel supplied certain leading truths, and, accepting these 
truths, those who can carry out his ideas have just to give due attention to special 
good or bad points of character and to the special aptitudes which need to be drawn 
out and exercised in accordance with race peculiarities, and thus his system becomes 
of world-wide application. 
In regard to the practical methods of the kindergarten, however, it is very im- 
portant that habits and circumstances should be taken carefully intoaccount. One 
of Froebel’s principles was that the child should always pass from the known to the 
unknown—that familiarity is valuable both in regard to mental and moral growth— 
and thus he followed the bent of the children around him in arranging his series of 
occupations. But he would have been the last to stereotype his methods, because 
in doing so he would have felt that he was going against his own principles. Even 
these methods, as children are so much alike in all countries, prove very much in 
accordance with tastes and tendencies everywhere. But it is most important to util- 
ize the self-chosen occupations of the little ones of any particular nationality and to 
recognize and to fit things in with the associations that have molded them. Hence 
the introduction of the kindergarten into a fresh country requires much care and 
resource, much judgment and sympathy. 
Now, [have lately returned from a visit to India, and I have been asked to give some 
information as to what is being done there in regard to kindergartens. Perhaps, when 
you have heard what I have to tell, you will consider that the kindergarten can 
hardly be said to exist in India, and I should almost agree with you. But there is 
a decided effort, especially in one part of India, to enliven the old methods of teach- 
ing, to introduce manual and physical training among the younger classes in schools, 
and to make the teachers understand better the nature of children. Therefore, 
though I have not much to tell you of kindergartens as we know them here, apart 
from school training and in connection with home influences, yet something is going 
on which is decidedly valuable, and which, but for all that has been spoken ans 
written upon Froebel’s principles, would not have been carried out. Moreover, there 
is continual progress noticeable, and with a large supply of qualified teachers very 
much more might be attempted; for the educated men of India have many of them 
heard and read of this. kind of training, and they are very anxious to see it spread 
in their country.
-P-A-G-E-121
  PUBLIC _KINDERGARTENS. 769 
The part of India which I have referred to as that where a decided effort is being 
made in the kindergarten direction is the Presidency of Madras. There is an ex- 
cellent inspectress of girls’ schools in that presidency, Mrs. Brander, who cares 
very much that the younger children in the schools should be appropriately dealt 
with. Mrs. Brander has spent many years in India, first as superintendent of the 
government training-school for mistresses, and now as inspectress. In her present 
capacity she visits numbers of girls’ schools in distant districts as well as those in 
the city of Madras, and latterly a second inspectress, Miss Carr, has been appointed. 
These two ladies undertake the inspection, personally or through their deputies, of 
all the presidency girls’ schools. In no other part of India is such an arrangement 
made; partly because it is not easy to find qualified ladies for the work and partly 
because Madras has always been rather forward, owing to the zeal of the mission- 
aries, in education. Mrs. Brander was in England a few years ago, and she inter- 
ested herself much about Froebel’s methods and read books on the subject. She 
had, even before, as superintendent of the training college, adopted the occupations 
and games to a small extent in the practicing school, and gradually she has become 
more and more convinced of their value. Miss Carr, her colleague, was, till last 
December, head of the same training school, many students of which are now set- 
tled as teachers in various places. Miss Carr, partly with the help of two Madras 
students who spent a year or two in England, did a great deal to improve the in- 
fant classes of the practicing schools and to instill rational ideas on education into 
the minds of the students. So now Mrs. Brander and Miss Carr on their tour of in- 
spection are able to encourage the former students and to keep up this standard of 
teaching, and they both pay special attention to the kindergarten teaching. 
Mrs. Brander has seen the great importance of adapting the methods to the sur- 
roundings of the little Indian children. You can hardly realize how very narrow 
the life of these children is. Seldom going out of their houses; with no shops con- 
taining pictures and other educating objects to look at; living among elders who 
are extremely ignorant and who believe in all sorts of superstitions, and married, 
or, as we should call it, betrothed, before they are 10 or 12 years old, they grow uj 
with unobservant faculties, untrained habits of conduct, no knowledge of the out- 
side world, and altogether undeveloped. In the treatment of such children when 
they are allowed to attend school it is difficult to find a basis to work from. Even 
pictures do not readily convey ideas to them, and the games that are interesting to 
European children have to do with ways and phases of life of which they have never 
heard. At the same time these children have bright capacities, they are very eager 
to improve, and, as little pupils, they are exceptionally good. The great thing there 
is to utilize the sights and sounds that they are accustomed to, and the occupations 
which are familiar to them. Mrs, Brander devotes much care to this. She selects 
native songs that may be suitable, and the materials which can be bought in the 
bazaar (this for another reason also, that they are cheaper), and she lets the children 
practice beadwork, in which they are very ingenious, and play with familiar seeds 
and berries. Some of the native methods, as forming letters in the sand, are quite 
an accord with kindergarten plans, but in the oldfashioned schools the exercises are 
done without joyousness, with great monotony, and undersevere threats and punish- 
ments. All the world over it seems to have been assumed that children hate learning, 
whereas to learn, under right conditions, is to most children a real pleasure. 
Now, will you pay a visit with me in imagination to a school in Madras to which 
a kindergarten is attached—that is, the younger children are taught on Froebel’s 
method, as far as it can be managed. Mrs. Brander and I went to see this school 
one morning during my visit to Madras, driving to it in that glorious Indian sun- 
shine, of which there is not too much in December, though even then we have to pro- 
tect ourselves against it. Well, we arrive in a rather crowded street at the central 
school and kindergarten, which, with five other schools, is supported by the Maha- 
raja of Vizianagrum, and is under the supervision of the committee of the National 
Indian Association. The house is one of typical native arrangement. Entering 
from the street we came upon a small courtyard, and beyond it was another. ‘The 
rooms all round the court on the lower floor were quite open, something like an in- 
terior veranda, with supporting pillars. It looks extremely picturesque to see at 
one glance the groups of children sitting in these open rooms in their bright varie- 
gated sarees. The head mistress, Miss Jupe, came to meet us. She is chiefly occu- 
pied upstairs with the elder girls, but she superintends the kindergarten with great 
care and interest. In the right-hand room of the court we see seventeen tiny boys 
and girls, all occupied with mat plaiting. The needles are now made in Madras, for 
it costs a great deal to get them from England. The children sat on benches with 
desks before them. I wish I could convey to you an idea of how they looked. Rich 
brown faces, large dark eyes, black smooth hair plaited behind in a knot, or hang- 
ing down, and most of them very gaily dressed. They wear very small short-sleeved, 
jackets and a skirt, and over all, a long saree, a sort of scarf of several yards, twisted 
ED 91——49

all about and raised over the head when required. In that part of India the dress 
is of cotton. One little girlhad a red jacket and a white saree; another, a green 
saree; another an orahge one over a white skirt. One child had aspot of red paint 
on her forehead, ear ornaments all about the ears, and many bangles. Most had 
these ornaments on, but no shoes and stockings. A little boy had a green jacket and 
gay cap. I tell you these details that you may form a picture in your minds of the 
scene. Then the native teacher, who also had bare feet, wore a red jacket and a 
saree, with shawl stripes (red, green, and yellow). Round her neck was a coral 
chain set in silver, a flat gold ornament in her hair, and_she wore spectacles. All 
the children seemed interested in this mat-plaiting, and they got on with it as well 
as English children might. Then we went to see about twenty of a baby class, all 
sitting on a long strip of mat on the floor, which is much more comfortable for them 
than benches. These babies were busy with bricks. The teacher had a ma- 
genta jacket and a cream-colored saree with gold border. She told them to make 
two chairs with their bricks for the ladies, which they did with alacrity. Then they 
made, with five bricks, a fireplace and a “ chattie” (a pot) upon it for boiling rice. 
“What do you do with the rice”? asked the teacher. “ Eatit,” said they, thinking * 
of the invariabledailymeal. Onelittle boy had aceat and cap of yellow and redsilk, 
and he wore toerings. Theverysmall girls donot yetwearsarees. They sanga Tamil 
song about something very familiar to them, ‘miftai,”—thatis, sweetmeats. ‘‘ Who 
make the sweets”? ‘ Brahmins,” they replied. This isso, because what Brahmins 
made everyone may eat, but things made by those of a lower caste may not be eaten 
by ahigher. Leaving these dear little children we found some rather older, playing 
in the courtyard. They were pretending to draw water from a well in tiny chatties, 
imitating the dipping of the chattie into the well with their soft delicate lit- 
tle arms and then watering some long twists of paper with flapping green 
ends, which I suppose were intended for palm trees. Then we saw some of their 
own games. One they call the frog game. Two little girls took hold of each other’s 
hands, repeating a rhyme: ‘“‘ We have rice in our pot; you have grain (that is,a 
coarse kind of grain), in yours. Which willyou have”? Then they jumped again 
arid again from the ground, bending and throwing their interlaced hands alternately 
to one side or the other. Another game was with clapping hands, first clapping 
each her own hands and then across. Then we saw another little class where all 
were forming the Tamil letters by laying red seeds on their slates upon the form of 
the letters which had been drawn by the teacher. In the upper story we found the 
older children. It is difficult to get enough female teachers as yet, and many men 
teach the girls’ schools. It looked strange at first to see the men, in-white and red 
turbans and perhaps a long white or orange coat or an enveloping shawl, conduct- 
ing a class. One was giving a lesson on the cotton plant, with plenty of specimens, 
and he had a small pot containing water, that he might let them drop a rupee and 
also some cotton into it, to show the relative weight. ‘These elder girls performed 
the kol-attam, or stick dance. Each child in the circle had two sticks, and in a 
methodical way she struck her own together in time with those of her neighbors on 
each side of her. The effect was extremely pretty. owing to their graceful actions. 
and the blue, red, white, lemon, and other colors of the saree and skirts. Meanwhile 
they sang a song about a garden and red and white lotus flowers. There was much 
that was interesting in the upper school, but I must keep to the little ones; so we 
will leave this schoo] and look in at another in a different part of Madras. It is a 
missionary school, of which the superintendent is Miss Oxley, of the Church Mission- 
ary Society. A storm had come on and we had.to rush into the house. These child- 
ren were fetched to school in a bullock cart; it goes round to their houses and 
brings them in sets of ten or twelve. One such batch arrived when we were there, 
and it was curious to see the pains taken lest the driver or anyone else should see 
the girls. The cart had to be turned with its end toward the verandah, and then 
they slipped out and ran in on the inner side of the cart. The driver is screened off. 
The teacher was a young Mohammedan woman, ina yellow chudder, something like 
a saree, but not near so long. Itis worn by Mohammedans. She taught the class 
with great spirit. Most of them had red Manchester cotton chudders, perhaps with 
yellow borders, and red pyjamas (trousers), We went to see asmall class sitting in 
an inner verandah. These tiny ones were on the floor, occupied with bead thread- 
ing, which they greatly enjoy. As I have said, the Indian work with beads is most 
ingenious; so this occupation is one which it is very useful to develop educationally. 
The beads were in a little chattie, or pot, and each child had a slate, so that if the 
beads were dropped they did not get lost on the matting of the floor. They were 
questioned in colors andanswered very well. After the Health Exhibition in London 
Mme. Michaelis kindly allowed me to have for India her series of bead threading, 
and. this has been circulated in most of the Madras Presidency schools. Mrs. 
Brander saw its value,and she has made the greatest use of it as a pattern. It is 
very rare that Mahommedan girls are allowed to attend school. There is something 
very dignified even in the tiny children’s manners. They wear their chudders over
-P-A-G-E-123
  PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. V7 
their heads, and when they stand with folded arms, their faces so plump and their 
eyes so fine, they look like Little Red Riding Hoods. Mrs. Brander inspects mission- 
~ ary as well as government schools, and she takes every opportunity of organizing an 
interesting variety of occupations. 
But now let us go to the presidency training school for mistresses at Madras, which 
is the source whence the teachers derive their knowledge of Froebel’s system. . Miss 
Carr, who till lately was the superintendent, has sent out in the five years of her 
stay about one hundred teachers. She had not yet started her new inspecting work 
when I was at Madras, so I was able to see the training school while her methods 
were in force. I thought this institution was most carefully conducted and there 
was a unity about the working which appeared to me remarkably well suited to the 
aims in view. The normal students usually number about 40, some English or 
Eurasian and others Hindoos. On account of the variety of languages it is neces- 
sary to have three practicing schools—Tamil, Telugu, and English. ‘The two teach- 
ers I referred to just now, Miss Shunmugum and Miss Bernard, were for a time in 
England studying at the Teachers’ Training College, then in Bishopsgate. They 
have proved very useful since their return, both in the practicing school and for the 
normal department. The students have passed three examinations in ordinary sub- 
jects before going to the training school, so that while they are there all their time 
is occupied in learning the art of teaching. Miss Carr used to look over and criti- 
cise all their sketches of lessons beforehand and she appointed them to one class for 
amonth. In the course of their stay they in turn took all the classes, including 
those of the little ones. Thus the kindergarten division is an integral part of the 
whole. There are also model lessons and criticism lessons and lectures to the stu- 
dents on school management and on points relating to teaching. The result of allis 
that there is much life and spirit in the training school and that the younger chil- 
dren are most happy in their classes, where the methods present a great contrast to 
the monotonous and uninteresting routine usually pursued. : 
The training school stands in a large compound (thatis, surrounding ground, some- 
times a garden). In this case there is only grass and a few trees. You seea group of 
little carriages and bullock carts, in which the teachers, and students, and children 
have driven to school. The classes were crowded as to space when I was there, for 
a large panda, i. e., temporary room inthe compound, had been lately blown down 
in a gale, but the director of public instruction has secured that a hall with class- 
rooms shall soon be built. The children were in the lower part of the house, the stu- 
dents upstairs. Miss Shunmugum took us first to see the little ones. About 20 small 
Telugu children were having an objectlesson from one of thestudents, named Suber- 
mal. She wore ared cotton skirt and a greenish bodice, over which was a white saree. 
In her ears there were several pearls and a green stone was near the top of her ear. 
Tiny pearls were screwed on to her face here and there. Her black hair was neatly 
plaited and round her neck was a bead chain with some coins interspersed. No 
shoes, but silver toe rings. Gold is thought too precious to wear on the feet. The 
lesson was on the hen. A stuffed hen stood before Subermal, and she called the 
children up in turns to examine it and to compare it with a duck, for in that school 
they teach much by comparison. They all seemed very much interested. It was 
pleasant to see their bright smiles. Indian children are generally very quiet and 
impassive, but these quite entered into teaching so suited to their nature and capac- 
ities. From the constant habit of preparation, the student teacher did not lose her 
way. One other lesson, but to elder children, was on the peacock, a very familiar 
bird in India. Here the teacher had to content herself with a picture and a pea- 
cock’s feather. But Imust not take you into the higher school. I will tell, however, 
of a lesson I heard given by astudent on another day when Miss Brander wasinspect- 
ing the training school. Aclass of eight little boys and girls was brought up into the 
inspection room and the student gave a very good lesson with square and oblong. 
I have the sketch here, only it is in Tamil. I could not follow it, but the children 
evidently enjoyed it and Mrs. Brander approved it. At one point they all held out 
their slates to illustrate the oblong. One tiny boy was bare to the waist. Indeed, 
his only dress was a white cloth tied round him and falling over his legs, except that 
he hed a purple cap. It was very amusing to see this little fellow go up eagerly 
to the blackboard and point to the square and the oblong of colored papers stuck on 
toit. This was the only inspection lesson given that day to a kindergarten class, 
but later I saw the little ones do some very simple exercises. It was not easy to dis- 
tinguish the girls from the boys, for the smallest ones are often dressed alike, in gay 
little vests and trousers. Parents like their girls to be taken for boys, because, as you 
are aware, it is thought more desirable in India to have sons than daughters. At 
one time the Hindoo mothers did not like their children to have movement exercises, 
so this teaching had to be given up. But Miss Carr took care to let the Eurasian 
children practice in the open verandah, where the Hindoo mothers could look on, and 
after awhile they came to her asking, ‘‘ Why do you not let our children do as these 
do?’ Whereupon these exercises were resumed. Of course in the Indian climate 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
a careful choice has to be made in gymnastics, lest the girls should overdo. The 
course of training is for one year, but the students can stay longer if they do not pass 
well. Sometimes a teacher in some country school is sent up to be trained and she 
goes back with new ideas and a different sense of what to aim at. This was the 
case with a girl ealled Sellammal, from Kumbakonum, for whom we procured ascholar- 
ship (£10) from English funds. She profited extremely by her stay in Madras, and 
she delighted in the training school so much that she wrote a poem on it celebrating 
its advantages andits management. WhenIwas atMadrasshe came with her parents 
a long night journey from Kumbakonum to see me. She fully recognizes the value 
of the kindergarten occupations and is very successful with them. Mrs. Brander 
encourages for the basis of the games the daily occupations which go on in the chil- 
dren’s homes, as fetching water from the well, grinding the corn, and so on. I think 
the Indian children have quite a dramatic instinct and they are fond of joining in 
simple scenes, arranged by the teachers. Their memories are so remarkably good 
that the learning what each has to say is quite easy. At one school at Madras, 
under a native Christianlady, Mrs. Satthiandahan, some children acted a sort of wel- 
come tome. The schoolgirls were placed in the open rooms round the courtyard, 
in the middle of which was a tree, and there were also shrubs in pots. Several girls 
pretended to be getting flowers, when another girl appeared finding great fault with 
them for coming without leave into a garden and plucking flowers. I should say 
that each girl had a colored paper basket, something like a fly catcher. They de- 
fended themselves and said they did not mean to do wrong. Then came the little 
gnardian’s mother, and she scolded her for having been off duty and let the other 
girls enter, but she also found fault with the invaders. After some disputing the 
whole matter was amicably settled by the girls explaining that an English lady 
had come to their school and they wished to get flowers for a garland for her. That 
excuse was considered satisfactory, and when a garland was placed on me it was 
supposed to be the one that they had been meanwhile making. Sometimes they hold 
a sort of argumentative conversation on the advantages of going to school, and they 
are very fond of a wedding game of their own called a ‘Garbi,” in which the children 
with a particular step move round in a circle, clapping their hands and bowing to- 
wards the center at each forward step. 
There are scarcely any teachers except those trained at the training school who 
understand anything about Froebel; so the kindergarten attempts in the mofussil 
(the country) schools are often very poor and mechanical. Still there is a recogni- 
tion of the idea that education means something wider than learning to read and 
write, and certainly many of the results are good. I willread to you asentence or two 
out of the report of Mrs. Brander, to the director of public instruction (Mr. Grigg), 
for last year: 
“The introduction of children’s occupations, object lessons, and action songs, and 
the grants offered for them have awakened an interest in the subject of the educa- 
tion of young children. Many managers have bought books on the subject, anda 
knowledge of the best methods of teaching young children is certainly spreading. 
Where well-trained teachers are employed the younger classes are now well taught, 
and managers seem to realize more than they used to do that the best teaching can 
not be obtained from untrained or poorly trained teachers. Even where the teachers 
are untrained, and where they conduct occupations mechanically, the children are 
happier and betteremployed in weaving paper, threading beads, or coum at pictures 
of animals than they were in shouting the alphabet for an hour at a time on the old 
pyal school system.” 
I may add asto Madras, that Miss Rajahcopaul, of the Free Church Missions, who 
was also once in England, and who studied at Miss Naubi’s, has translated a select- 
ion of action songs from the book of Mrs. Berry and Madame Michaelis into Tamil. 
In other parts of India there is not much known or practiced as yet regarding the 
kindergarten, but a good many inquiries are made about it, because articles in news- 
papers, and educational information from England has stirred up some interest in the 
subject. The training schools generally have not taken it up. There is one at 
Ahmedabad, inthe Bombay Presidency, where the lady superintendent of the trainin, 
college is Mrs. McAfee, who was lately in England. She gained here some usefw 
ideas, I think, through Mrs. Holton, which she has found very helpful. But I must 
not omit ae the Irish Mission School, where many years ago two of Friiu- 
lein Heerwart’s students used to teach. Though they have both left (one has mar- 
ried a missionary and the other is also married), yet the beginning that they made 
has been carried on. I was present at the prize giving in this schoolandI gathered 
that the younger children are taught in a bright, rational way. A little pupil of 4 
years old was of the Parsee family in which I was staying, and this child, Dhunbai, 
showed the good effects of attending the kindergarten. She was a fine child, very 
quick and dignified, and with much self-possession. She would repeat several in- 
fant school rhymes in Gujerate translations out of a book prepared by the head of a 
training college at Poona. It was curious to see the grave way in which she would
-P-A-G-E-125
    PUBLIC KINDERGARTENS. 773 
recite about the “Clock in the corner that stands,” pointing to her hands and face 
quite properly and making the pendulum go with even swing. This dear little girl 
was a great favorite with me. She would come stealthily into my room and wait 
till I noticed her, perhaps dressed in a pink frock and trousers, with a little cerise- 
colored sleeveless vest outside. Her sisters attended the higher classes of the school 
and are very promising girls. The last time I might have seen little Dhunbai Dady- 
sett was at 1 o’clock in the night, when I was to pass Surat again in the train. 
Owing to a delay my train did not arrive till 5 in the morning and I found that all 
the family, with Dhunbai, had been at 1 o’clock to meet me. Little Dhunbai, too, 
had brought a large nosegay which, after all, had to be left for me with the station 
master. I should have greatly liked to see that dear child again. 
Mrs. Sorabji, at Poona, has some useful kindergarten classes in her excellent school 
in that city. 
In the Bombay scbools there is a wide field for kindergarten teaching, and the 
managers would, I am sure, be very pleased if some one would introduce it. » 
Now, I have to tell you of the interesting fact that two native Indian ladies in 
different parts of India have interested themselves in the subject and are likely to be 
of great help in spreading Froebel’s ideas. The first is Pundita Ramabai, a Mah- 
ratti widow and a Sanskrit scholar, of whom you have probably heard. She came 
to England about seven years ago and stayed at Wantage, and afterwards at Chel- 
tenham College. Then she went to America, and she was so much struck with the 
educational work there that she formed the plan of collecting a large sum of money 
for establishing a widows’ home in India. After great exertions in lecturing and 
writing (her book on the High Caste Hindu Woman is most interesting) she met 
with sufficient success to return to India and start the home. She is beginning it . 
ona small scale in Bombay, and she has with her an American teacher who, I be- 
lieve, understands the kindergarten. Ramabai herself has the greatest belief in 
the value of such teaching, and she is convinced that it is just what is required for 
Hindu children in order to counteract the defects in their home training. Rama- 
pai’s enthusiasm is keen about the undertaking, and I have great hopes that she 
will be of real service in the kindergarten movement. 
The other lady is Srimati Harderi, also a widow, living at Lahore. She, too, has 
been in England, and she used to attend the kindergarten of Madame and Miss Roth. 
It promises well that these two ladies are both so convinced of the truth of Froe- 
bel’s principles. 
Now, let us come to one or two practical points. I think you will have seen how 
advantageous it would be for India if some good kindergarten teachers could go out 
and help to carry forward the work already just begun; and, besides the Hindu, 
Mahommedan, and Parsee children, there are the little English children to be con- 
sidered, for whom it would be delightful if kindergartens were started, especially 
in the Hills. Those of 6 and 7 are usually sent home; but there are numbers under 
that age who, owing to the climate and the want of variety in their daily life, be- 
come iretful and selfish, languid and troublesome. Kindergarten teaching would 
not altogether change this state of things; but we know that it often does effect 
wonders on difficult children. When I was at Calcutta two or three ladies whom 
Ispoke to about it said that they thought the plan might succeed at Darjeeling, 
and another lady in the N. W. P. spoke hopefully as to Gaini Tal being a suit- 
able station for the experiment; but, then, such opinions are vague for acting on, 
for there is the united expense of voyage and outfit and the probability that it 
would be a long time before the attempt could prove remunerative. I will read you 
part of a letter that I received lately from Miss Collins, who took the elementary 
Froebel certificate, as it was then called, in the first year of that examination. Miss 
Collins has a mother and brother in India, and she went out with the hope of estab- 
lishing a kindergarten at Simla, which is her home for most of the year. She found 
it a difficult undertaking, because she could not afford to wait. 
“T am very disheartened and disappointed that I have been quite unable to start 
my kindergarten home, because I have not been able to save the rent for the ensu- 
ing season; in fact, I am in debt for last year’s rent, and my hope of being quite 
independent has rather a gloomy prospect. I have been told that had I been able to 
get a suitable house and governess and English nurse sent, I should have all the 
children in Simla, and a good many more, but I find it utterly impracticable this 
season. I have been thinking of a plan, and that is to get some clever lady with a 
little money to join me, and we together might start the school on the plan I had 
arranged, I supplying the connection and influence I have already gained, and she 
the money to begin with, sharing the income eventually; but where to get such a 
lady is the difficulty; such an one is not to be had in India, and I thought you 
would be the only one whom I know who could bring two such people to correspond 
as myself and such a lady.” 
There is no doubt that the parents were pleased with her efforts. Her wish was 
that she and her mother pie set up a kindergarten home for little children at 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  TT4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Simla, where they would be safely left when the rest of the family had to go down 
to Calcutta, but for that you see she had not enough funds. 
Well, all that seems made out is that someone with experience and money might 
get on well in the Hills and do most useful work. 
To go back to the Indian children. I think thatifa good teacher were to settle in 
Bombay it would not be long before she would get plenty to do. Supposing she 
could teach gymnastics for ladies, also, probably numbers of Parsee teachers would 
~ take lessons of her, for physical training is much favored just now. Or, better still, 
if two ladies could go out, one for the kindergarten and one for gymnastics, they 
would be not unlikely to succeed. Training classes for the teachers would be very 
important, and there would not be any difficulty, I believe, in utilizing an existing 
school as a practicing school. And not only at’ Bombay, but at Calcutta, and per- 
~haps at Madras, the scheme might prosper. When there was originally a discussion 
about medical women for India, a native statesman said he thought 10,000 might be 
required. We might, perhaps, reduce this by half for kindergarten teachers and 
expect 5,000 to become occupied in India, or perhaps we had better first limit our- 
selves to two. But I really believe that once satisfactorily started the movement 
would get on well, and perhaps the Indian Government might be willing to help 
with grants in aid. 
Now I come to another practical point, I want to ask your help for Mrs. Brander 
and the other workers in India in respect.to specimens of kindergarten work done 
by students or by children, and books and pamphlets on this subject. I can assure 
you now from personal knowledge that all such aid is most warmly appreciated. I 
have already mentioned how valuable Mrs. Michael’s bead series has been. The 
teachers are much encouraged when they find that English people have sympathy 
in what they do, and they derive suggestions from the work sent out, and it keeps 
up this standard. Books, too, are of the greatest use. May I hope that you will bear 
this request in mind, and that you will now and then send a parcel to me which I 
» can inclose in the cases that I frequently forward. Some kindergarten children at 
~ Reading once dressed a doll for the kindergarten at the Central School, Madras, which 
Lhave told you of. Whilst they were dressing it they gave it many messages and 
questions to convey, which were duly inscribed by me on a piece of paper pinned on 
to the doll’s dress. I have also received Christmas cards from those same little chil- 
dren. I feel that the link of sympathy thus forged is of great value, besides that 
the gifts and patterns sent are immensely prized by Mrs. Brander and her friends in 
their often perplexing labors. 
In conclusion let me add a very few words about the backward state of the women 
‘of India. You must not think that because I have referred to many girls’ schools 
these are at all in proportion to the population. Hardly 2 per cent of girls of the 
school-going age attend schools; thatis, taking a thousand girls, less than 20 will be 
atschools. Perhaps there may be 25,000,000 of very young girls in India, and yet the 
pupils in the girls’ schools only number some thousands. In the higher classes a little 
instruction is given in the homes, but education for girls is a novelty in these later 
times, whatever may have been done there in the far past. The girls (as you know), 
whether they go to school or not, marry very early; they are seldom real companions 
for their husbands, and they are quite unprepared to train their children well. Of 
development, as Froebel understood it, such young mothers with their restricted life 
and their superstitious ignorance have no idea. Child-marriage and caste are two of 
the greatest evils from which India suffers, and little progress will be possible till 
educated opinion has weakened these customs. It is the mothers that need to be 
enlightened and it is they who are the most difficult to reach. Something may be 
done through teachers who attend at the houses, but it is not every family that will 
admit them, By degrees we may hope that girls will be allowed to remain longer 
at school, and as an inducement to this it is of great use to give scholarships to the 
highest pupils, and then if such girls could be taught something in regard to the 
training of little children, they might enter upon their home duties with more 
knowledge and kindly skill. But all this is at present far off, except as to a very 
few. It is for us, however, to work wherever the path is open and clear, bearing in 
mind that we have through wonderful circumstances become intimately bound to 
India, and that many of the women of India are looking affectionately and confidently 
on support in their forward efforts and for enlightenment to their English sisters 
ere.

APPENDIX C. 
THE KINDERGARTEN IN MADRAS. 
By Mrs. Brander, Government Inspector of Girls’ Schools, Madras. 
Efforts have been made for some years past to introduce kindergarten teaching 
into the native girls’ schools of the Madras presidency. It may be of interest to 
note the progress that has been made and the plans which have been found most 
successful. 
In a few large and flourishing kindergartens in the presidency, like that at the 
Government Female Normal School and H. H. the Maharajah of Vizianagrum’s Kin- 
dergarten, the materials used are in part obtained from England, and the teaching, 
being by trained teachers, is superior to and more complicated than that about to 
be described. The following remarks apply to the majority of ordinary schools, not 
to the few kindergartens under European supervision. These latter tend to raise 
the standard, and where they supply trained kindergarten teachers, as at the nor- 
mal school, are invaluable, 
In the revised grant-in-aid code, which came into force in 1885, kindergarten occu- 
pations and action songs are introduced as optional subjects, for which grants can be 
earned. This has stimulated interest and many managers are now introducing these 
subjects into their schools. A 
It has often been objected to the kindergarten in England that the idea bering: 
originated in Germany, the songs, games, occupations, and even the materials use: 
were too German, and it was not until English kindergartens changed this by in- 
venting English games, songs, etc., that the system began to take root in England. 
Thesame difficulty has beenfelt, even more strongly,in India. Asregards the games, 
the difficulty has been partly avoided by introducing native games, such as the 
kotatham or stick dance, gobi, kunni, and others. These dances and games are 
very pretty and graceful, and, when played with energy, secure real physical exer- 
cise for the children. They do not, however, exercise the dramatic powers of the 
children as Froebel’s games do. This has been partly achieved by translating 
English kindergarten songs into the vernaculars. There isone book of these in Tansil, 
ealled Thirty Kindergarten and Action Songs, translated by Miss Rajajapal, which, 
in the absence of original native action songs for infants, is very useful. Such 
translations are, however, of course open to the objection that the ideas and forms 
are foreign. It is to be hoped that, before long, some native poet will produce orig- 
inal native songs of the kind required. 
With regard to the occupations, native material has been introduced as much as 
possible. It has the advantage of being familiar to the children and it is cheaper 
than English material. 3 
The teaching ofthe alphabet is not strictly a kindergarten occupation, but the 
method by which the vowels are taught to beginners here gives it aright to be 
classed as such. The children are seated on mats on the floor, with a strip of smooth 
chunam or their slates in front of them. Before they take their seats the letter to 
be taught is written with chalk, in large size, on the chunam floor or a slate, oppo- 
site the center of the class, and repeated, in smaller size, on the floor orslate in front of 
each child. Beside each letter is a pile of tamarind seeds. The teacher calls atten- 
tion to the large letter, traces its form, discusses it with the children, and tells them 
itsname. She then lays the tamarind seeds over the chalk letter, thereby tracing 
its form.again. While doing so she allows the children to count the seeds laid on 
in twelves (12 is the limit of the arithmetic required of them). The attention of 
the children is next called to the small-sized letters in front of them, and they are 
required to lay seeds, from the heaps beside them, on their chalk letters, care being 
taken that they begin and end at the right points, as if they were writing the letter. 
The children are encouraged to count the seeds, in twelves, as they lay them on, and 
to induce them to work quickly, each child is allowed to stand as soon as she has 
finished. By means of this occupation the children learn, in a pleasant way, the 
forms of the letters before they can write them. These forms are further impressed 
on their minds by means of pricking and sewing. Later in the day the children are 
sested on their mats with a small cushion and a pin in front of each. The cushions 
are about 2 inches long by an inch wide and are stuffed with bran. They are coy- 
ered with Turkey red cloth, so that the materials for them can be bought in any 
Indian bazaar. “Each child is now supplied with a strip of olei, that is, the dried 
leaf of the palmyra or toddy palm. The teacher has previously written on each 
strip the letter traced by seeds that day, and she has made a series of dots along the 
letter. The children are now shown how to prick out the letter, pricking only 
where they see a dot and beginning and ending at the right points.
-P-A-G-E-128
  776 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Asa third occupation, eae& child is supplied with the olei, on which she has previ- 
ously pricked the letter with a thimble and a needle threaded with weavers’ thread. 
This is the thread used for weaving women’s clothes, and can be bought in almost 
every village {in India. Its bright colors render it particularly suitable for chil- 
dren’s occupations. The children now backstitch the letter on the olei, putting in 
the needle at the holes previously pricked. : 
The occupations and general use of native materials hitherto described were 
invented and introduced by Mrs. Capron, an American lady, who has done a great 
deal of good for girls’ education in Madura. Itis from her schools there that the 
plans described have been adopted and spread to other schools in the presidency. 
The same is true of Mrs. Capron’s use of weavers’ bright colored thread for cross- 
stitch and for samplers, 
On the same lines but arranged and introduced by others, are the more advanced 
styles of the occupation of pricking and sewing for standards above the infants. 
The materials used are the weavers’ thread, coarse bazaar paper, of which two or 
three thicknesses are pasted together to form a sort of cardboard, and chequered paper. 
The latter is the only one of the materials which can not be procured in the bazaars. 
It is now made in the town of Madras, and has to be supplied from there. By means 
of these materials ideas of form are taught. The lessons and patterns begin with 
simple lines, first vertical, then horizontal, and then slanting, and proceed to com- 
binations of these lines into angles, and gradually to more complicated forms and 
patterns. 
Bead-threading is an occupation which is very popular with Indian children, and 
a graduated series of patterns, obtained from a bead school in London, is taught in 
many of the schools at this presidency. It is true that the beads come from Eng- 
land, but they are sold cheaply in all Indian bazaars. Counting and knowledge of 
color are taught by means of the series mentioned, and the teachers and children 
are very clever at imitating native jewelry and at covering toy water-pots, cook- 
ing vessels, and other things with beads by a method of threading which seems to 
be practiced only in India, Paper plaiting and folding are to some extent taught, 
but not widely, as colored paper can not be bought in small bazaars. 
Prizes for kindergarten work are given at the exhibition held by the National 
Indian Associaton at Madras every year. It is very pleasant to see how much the 
little Indian children enjoy the songs, games, and occupations of the kindergarten. 
In all schools into which these have been introduced, there is a marked improve- 
ment in the brightness and intelligence of the children in the infant classes.

  CHAPTER XXI. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
  A.—Dublic high schools. B.—Private academies, seminaries, ete. 
For the purpose of comparison and study of the moyements in secondary institu- 
tions in the United States, the two great classes of (1) public high schools and (2) 
private academies, seminaries, and institutions of like grade have been reported in 
the same way, as far as was possible. Assuming that the studies pursued were of 
the same general character in each, the same inquiries were made and the replies col- 
lected in the two sets of tables, each class separately, but upon the same general plan. 
In the last report (1889-90) for the first time an attempt was made by the Bureau 
to collect complete statistics of the public high schools, union schools, and high 
school departments of public schools in this country, so far as the lists of such schools 
could be secured in the short period allotted. Of necessity, these lists were some- 
what incomplete, but often by considerable correspondence detailed returns more or 
less complete were received from 2,526 high schools for that year. For the purpose 
above stated and to show a more exact condition of the schools as to management, 
scholarship, and actual results, it became necessary to arrange for securing more ac- 
curate information from all secondary schools, public and private, as to the number 
of teachers giving secondary instruction and the number of students pursuing only 
secondary studies in these schools. This plan required the elimination from the 
teaching force of all elementary teachers, or those giving instruction solely in 
grades below the secondary, and also necessitated the exclusion from the number of 
students of all those who were not pursuing secondary studies. As was expected, 
the first effort to secure accurate data upon all these points was not only difficult, 
but almost impossible to accomplish in one year. Hence, while the statistics re- 
ported were given as fully as possible for 1889~90, they were not considered as suffi- 
eiently accurate for discussion or comparison with other years, even if the data for 
former years had been obtainable, as they were not in the case of public high schools. 
For these reasons the statistics alone were printed last year, yet these by a careful _ 
study show many interesting results, imperfect as they are, like all data collected 
for the first time. 
This year the inquiries sent out were more perfectly understood, and the returns 
made approximated more closely to the exact conditions of the various institutions 
reporting. The fact that many union schools, and some high schools, both public 
and private, contain students in the elementary grade, and as the line of demarca- 
tion between elemeritary and secondary instruction varies somewhat in different 
States, and often in different schools of the,same State, although nominally of the 
same grade, it becomes quite a difficult question to decide which students in some 
high schools belong to the one class or the other. 
To secure uniformity in the returns from so many different schools where there 
were differences in regard to the classification of students as belonging to the 
secondary grade, it became necessary to adopt some plan to define, as far as possible, 
the status of the students inaschool by the reports made in each case, and the prin- 
cipal was asked to classify the students into secondary and elementary, if there were 
any of the latter class, and to place the number of elementary students in a sepa- 
rate column apart from the secondary students in the report from the school. 
In addition to this method of showing the grade of students in the school, another 
plan was adopted to secure uniformity by having a reportof the number of students 
pursuing certain studies, generally accepted as secondary studies. For this purpose 
a list of thirteen studies, with spaces for additional ones of like grade, was placed 
on the form of inquiry sent out and reports asked as to the number of students pur- 
suing each of these studies named. ‘These studies were Latin, Greek, French, Ger- 
man, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, history (other than the 
789 
     
-P-A-G-E-142
790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
  * United States), rhetoric, English literature, and geology. It is of course admitted 
that these studies, selected to indicate in a general way the secondary grade, do not 
include all that might have been chosen, but as they are studies usually found in 
all secondary schools they may be taken as fairly representative of all institutions. 
This method shows approximately not only the standard of the school in certain 
studies and classes of studies, but gives a very interesting collection of statistics 
for comparison as to the curricula of secondary schools, in different sections of the 
country, as to what classes of studies have the ascendancy, and also furnishes ground 
for comparing the standards of the public and private schools of this grade. These 
data of studies will also in time indicate the changes going on in the various indi- 
vidual schools, and also show the general changes in States and larger geographical 
divisions, if the curriculum may be considered a standard of comparison, other things 
being equal. In the year 1889~90 reports were received from 2,526 public high 
schools, with 9,120 teachers and 202,963 students. In 1890-91, 2,773 schools reported, 
with 8,270 teachers and 211,598 students. In 1889~90 the private secondary schools 
were reported as 1,632, with 7,209 teachers and 94,931 students. In 1890-91 of this 
_ class there were reported 1,773 schools, with 6,231 teachers and 98,400 students. 
An apparent discrepancy arises in the number of teachers in both the public and 
private schools, owing in some measure to the imperfect nature of the returns for 
1889-90 in both classes of schools. In the first attempt to separate the teachers who 
taught other than secondary studies from the entire teaching force and give only 
those who were in fact secondary teachers, it was expected that some errors would 
arise. In many schools some teachers teach in both grades; hence the difficulty of 
making complete returns, but in 1890~91 the report given probably approximates 
more nearly to the exact number. It should be noted that the apparent decrease in 
the number of teachers in both classes of schools is about the same. 
As to the students it is also doubtless true that some below the standard of sec- 
-ondary schools were included in t889-’90 which are eliminated in the next return for 
1890~91, and hence the increase of secondary students does not appear so great as-it 
really is. 
How nearly complete the return of the number of these schools of both classes is 
not certainly known, though persistent efforts have been made to reach every 
school. Quite a number of them have not yet been reported, because the work on 
the part of the schools is entirely voluntary, and often the changes in principals, 
absence, and other causes make it difficult to secure replies in time from many 
schools, both public and private. It is well known that some of the State superin- 
- tendents in their returns to this Bureau report quite differently from the numbers 
given in these tables, some giving less, but most of thema greater percentage espe- 
cially of scholars. 
The probability would seem to be from all the returns given that the reports made 
by the States as a whole are too large, avhile those collected upon returns direct 
from the schools are somewhat too small, and the true number is to be found some- 
where between the two extremes and can only be determined by returns made for a 
series of years. 
Another apparent discrepancy appears in the Extra Census Bulletin No. 11, October 
7, 1891, which gives the returns of secondary students for July 1, 1891, in public 
schools, 277,049, and in private schools, 277,241. These figures increase the number 
of students in public high schools by 65,451, or one-third; and in private secondary 
schools, the increase is 182,310, over three times as great, or 82 per cent more than 
the reports made to the Bureau show for the same year. A portion of this differ- 
ence may be explained by the fact that probably quite a portion of those included 
in these figures are elementary students and not separated as in the reports made to 
this Bureau. 
The simple statement of these varying results shows how difficult it is to get 
definite data and how careful it is necessary to be in predicating results upon these 
figures. 
While it is true that the returns given in the tables of statistics published by the 
Bureau are far from complete, it is equally true that what data has been received is 
fairly reliable, and for comparison as to the character of the institutions by their 
studies and of the two classes of public and private institutions with each other 
the data are sufficient. If even only one-half of the institutions of each class were 
fairly reported the comparison would be good. 
That certain changes are going on in these two classes of schools is quite evident, 
put it requires statistics for a series of years to make definite statements as to the 
extent of these changes, for a special cause might operate for a single year. The 
rapid growth of the system of public high schools seems well indicated, and prob- 
ably this result has its influence in absorbing many of the private institutions ofthe 
same grade; and hence it is probable that in some States the number of the public 
institutions will increase and the private ones decrease. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
  SECONDARY SCHOOLS. T91 
The changes in the number of students in these institutions seems not so great, 
for the thorough courses of study in many private institutions as preparatory for 
college, and the lack of these facilities in some public high schools, simply on ac- 
count of being newly established, keep students where it is supposed they can 
secure special advantages for theirfuture work. ‘The prevailing idea in some locali- 
ties that the public high schools should not prepare for college may also have its 
influence to some extent. At any rate, at the present time the private institutions 
still do a large proportion of the preparatory work, and it is equally true that as far 
as the public schools accept this function as part of their work they will more and 
more take their position as being next to the college in the educational system. 
SUMMARIES OF STATISTICS, 1890-91. 
The following tables of summaries are so arranged that the public and private 
schools may be compared as far as possible, the same table in each case following in 
order, the public schools first. On this plan the general statistics are given by geo- 
-graphical divisions and by States and Territories. Table 1 gives the number of 
schools, instructors, and students for public high schools. . 
This table shows that over one-half of the whole number of public high schools 
reported are in the North Central Division, 1,448 out of 2,273; and out of 8,270 in- 
structors this same division has 4,075, almost one-half. Of the 211,596 students 
104,290, about the same proportion, are found in the great Northwest, showing that 
in this section the public high school has had a rapid growth. The North Atlantic 
Division follows closely with 845 schools, 2,091 instructors, and 77,850 students. The 
South Atlantic and South Central Divisions are nearly the same as to the number of 
instructors and students, the South Central having a larger number of schools, but 
smaller in size. The Western Division, though smallest in numbers, has shown rapid 
growth, the increase in the number of students being about 20 per cent over the 
last year, and a large percentage, also, in the number of schools and instructors, 
The other items of this table are further discussed in connection with the diagrams 
following the next table. 
INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS IN PRIVATE ACADEMIES, ETC, 
Arranged on the same plan follows the summary of statistics of the private acade- 
mies, etc., as to schools, instructors, and students.

    796 : EDUCATION REPORT 1890-91. 
The foregoing table follows the same plan in regard to private schools as the pre- 
‘ceding one for public schools. Of the 1,714 schools, 531 are in the North Atlantic, 
363 in the South Atlantic, 380 in the South Central, 305 in the North Central, and 
135 in the Western Division. It will be noticed that these private schvols are much 
more evenly distributed over the country than the public schools. Of the 6,231 in- 
structors 2,542, or 41-per cent, are in the North Atlantic Division, and of the 98,400 
students 36,135, or nearly 37 per cent, are in this same division. The North Central 
Division, though not having as many schools as either the South Atlantic or the 
South Central, has more instructors and students than either of the other two. A 
study of this table shows that in this class of schools the teaching force is to the 
number of students in a ratio of 1 to 16 in the country taken together, while in the 
North Atlantic it is 1 to 14, in the South Atlantic 1 to 17, in the South Central 1 to 
18, in the North Central 1 to 174, and in the Western Division 1 to 13}. 
In connection with the general summaries in the foregoing tables, it has been 
thought best to give certain comparisons between the two classes of public and 
private schools, by means of diagrams, in addition to the figures, and several of these 
are made by geographical divisions like the summaries.

Diagram 1 shows in a general way the proportion of public and private secondary 
schools to each other, and the relative percentage of instructors, students, number 
preparing for college, in both classical and scientific courses, the number of gradu- 
ates, and the number in the graduating class preparing for college. From this it is 
seen that the public high schools are 64.25 per cent of the total number, and have 57 
per cent of the instructors, 68.25 per cent of the students, and 78.2 per cent of the gradu- 
ates. Of those preparing for college in the classical course the public schools have 
only 48.81 per cent, or Jess than the private schools, although the private schools have 
not quite half as many students in them. In the scientific course the public schools 
have 61.54 per cent. Of those preparing for college in the graduating class, both 
courses, 62.52 per cent were in the public schools, One thing is specially noticeable, 
that the private schools furnish considerably more than their proportion of stu- 
dents preparing for college in the classical course (more than one-half of all), and 
over 88 per cent of those in the scientific course. While it is true that not all the 
- schools of either class are reported, yet it is believed that the comparisons may be 
taken as fairly showing the relation of the two classes of schools to each other. The 
general statistics are more fully shown in the summary tables of each class, and the 
details as to each school are given in Part 11 of the report. 
The great interest in the question as to whether the secondary schools are doing 
their full part in preparing students for college suggested the preparation of the
-P-A-G-E-149

following diagram, showing the number of students preparing, .or college. in both 
the classical and scientific courses, and the proportion to the total number of stu-

It is interesting to note that in the public high schools over 12 per cent of the 
total number of students are preparing for college and that the numbers are almost 
evenly divided between the two courses in the country, taken as a whole. In the 
North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and South Central Divisions the greater number is 
in the classical course, the South Central Division having the greatest ratio, while in 
the North Central and Western Divisions the scientific course predominates, espe- 
cially in the last, which has nearly three times as many in the scientific as in the clas- 
sical course. 
In the private academies it is found that in the country, as a whole, of over 21 per 
-eent preparing for college almost two-thirds of them are in the classical course, and 
in every division the greater number take this course, the highest ratio,-over 17 per 
cent, being in the South Atlantic Division; the lowest, 8.26 per cent, being in the 
North Central Division. In the scientific course the greatest proportion is in the 
month Atlantic Division, 9.15 per cent, and the lowest in the South Atlantic Division, 
.09 per cent. 
Of the 20,907 students preparing for college, both courses, in private institutions, 
8,869, or about 42:5 per cent, are found in the North Atlantic Division alone, while 
of the 25,058 students preparing for college in the public high schools, 12,002, or 48 
per cent, are in the North Central Division—that is, the North Atlantic States have

Another subject of interest is the number and proportion of graduates from sec- 
ondary schools. The following diagram (3) shows this for both classes of schools 
and the percentage of each to the other: zs

From this it appears that of the 32,567 graduates in 1891, from’both the public high 
schools and private academies, 25,459, or over 78 per cent, came from the public schools, 
and only about 22 per cent from the private institutions. Of the graduates from 
the public schools, the North Central Division furnished 12,933, or over one-half, and 
of those from the private schools the North Atlantic Division had 3,458, or néarly 
one-half of all from that class of schools. The question of the proportion of stu- 
dents who complete the course of study in secondary schools js so important that 
statistics as to the number have been collected, and in addition to the tables diagram 
4 has been prepared.

12 per cent. of all the students in attendance during the year, and the private 
academies 7.22 per cent. In the public schools the Southern Atlantic Division had 
13.23 per cent, the highest ratio, while the South Central Division had the lowest, 
or 9.37 per cent. of graduates. In the private schools, the greatest ratio was in the 
North Atlantic Division, 9.57 per cent of the total number, while the smallest pro- 
oreo is found in the South Central Division, 4.28 percent. Of course these figures 
o not always give the exact statement of the relative standards of the schools be- 
cause the conditions and requirements for graduation both as to length of time and 
amount of study vary greatly in the different portions of the country as well as in 
the different schools, These statistics, however, may, with other data, aid in find- 
ing the comparative growth of the institutions as to numbers and scholarship, es- 
pecially when the questions of courses of study are taken into consideration. 
STUDIES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
As already stated, the plan of collecting data relating to the principal studies 
pursued in the schools has been continued and tables of summaries made. Table 
it following gives the number of students pursuing the studies named in the pub- 
lic high schools:

In Table Iv will be found the same statistics from the private academies, etc., and 
by comparing them with the former table the work done by each can be readily seen.

From these figures it is shown that in the private academies, of the 36,370 study- 
ing Latin, 14, 995, or over 41 per cent, were in the North Atlantic Division, the South 
Atlantic being next in number, with T; 410; of the 7,918 in Greek, 4,260 were in the 
same division, the North Central having i 172, , and the South Atlantic Division 1,134; 
of the 16,607in French, 8,910 were in the North ‘Atlantic, and 2,673 in the South Atlantic 
Division; of the 14,913 in German, 7,602 were in the North Atlantic, and 3,932 in the 
North Central Division; of the 44,251 in algebra the North Atlantic Division had 
15,521, the next three divi isions, nearly the same number each, between eight and 
nine thousand. The other studies are much in the same ratio, showing that the pre-

    dominance of the North Atlantic Division is more regular in the private schools than 
in the public schools. 
In order to more clearly exhibit the comparative work of the two classes of schools, 
public and private, as shown by the proportion of students in each class of schools 
pursuing the studies already mentioned, the following, Diagram 5, has been pre- 
pared, which gives the pereentage for the whole country only.

From the above diagram it may be noted that a greater proportionate number 
study Latin in the public schools than in the private schools by over 4 per cent, and, 
what may seem surprising, that this number is over 41 per cent of the whole number 
of students in the publie schools and 37 per cent in the private institutions.

which has only one-third the percentage that the private schools have. In German 
there is little difference, the public school having 1 per cent more. In the public 
schools over 52 per cent study algebra and 45 per cent in the private schools; in 
geometry the public schools have 24.6 or 5 per cent more than the private. In phys- 
ics the private schools have 27 per cent, 3 per cent more than the public. Chemistry 
is about the same in each, a little over 10 per cent. In general history the private 
schools have 33 per cent, or 5 per cent more than the public schools. As has been 
stated, figures like these can not be taken as settling the exact percentages of the 
students in these various branches of study, in one year, but by careful returns from 
practically the same institutions for a number of years, a fairly reliable table can 
be made. The tables given for this year are believed to be more correct than those 
in the last report, which was the first attempt to collect the results in this manner. 
Another year.a comparison of the same studies can be made which will be more sat- 
isfactory as a statistical exhibit. 
PROPORTION AS TO SEX IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The increasing interest in the question of sex in education and the discussion of 
this question in regard to the work of preparatory schools, make this subject impor- 
tant, and to give as far as possible the number and proportion of instructors and 
students as classified by sex, Table V has been prepared. This not only gives the 
number of students in the schools by sex, but the number and percentage of each 
sex preparing for college in each of the courses, as well as the ratio of each sex pre- 
paring for college to the whole number of students in the institutions.

From this table it is seen that nearly 55 per cent of the instructors in public high 
schools are women, and 51 per cent in the private institutions. Of the white stu- 
dents, almost 60 per cent in public schools are females, while in the private schools 
the number is about equal. Of the colored students, the females are over 60 per 
cent in the public schools and not quite 46 per cent in the private. Of the students 
preparing for college in the classical course, the males in public schools have a small 
majority, while in the private schools the number is nearly three to one. Of those 
in the scientific course, the proportion is the same in the public schools, and the 
percentage of males slightly less in the private schools. The percentage of male 
students preparing for college in both courses to the whole number‘ of students is

schools; and the males, 29.31 per cent, and females, 12.19 per cent in the private 
schools.

  810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
A mere glance at these two tables shows that in the public schools the females 
constitute a large majority in Latin, French, algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, 
and general history, while the males have the larger number only in Greek and 
German. The relative percentages as to certain studies vary considerably in the 
different geographical divisions, especially in regard to French and German; as, for 
instance, 72 per cent of those studying German in the North Atlantic Division are 
males, while in the Western Division over 70 per cent are females. In the South 
Central Division only 1 per cent studying French are males, and in the South Atlan- 
tic not quite 10 per cent. In physics and chemistry the percentages are the most 
uniform. In the table for private schools it will be found that the percentages are 
quite different from the public schools. Here the males are in a majority in every 
study except French and general history. In Latin the males are 55.54 per cent; in 
Greek, 81.80 per cent; in French, nearly 33 per cent; in German, 51.33 per cent; in 
algebra, 55 per cent; in geometry, 58.33 per cent; in physics and chemistry, 50 percent; 
and in general history, 46.52 percent. ‘The various geographical divisions show more 
uniformity, but there is the same difference in localities in regard to French and 
German, but perhaps not to so great a degree; for instance, in the North Central 
Division, only 16.25 per cent of those studying French are males. 
  FINANCIAL SUMMARIES, ETC, 
Perhaps the most difficult thing to procure in the reports from the schools is that 
including a statement of financial matters. In regard to public high schools the 
difficulty arises largely from the fact that the matters of finance for these schools are 
included in the general financial statement of the public school system in each 
locality and can not therefore be easily separated. On the other land, the private 
institutions are somewhat averse to giving statistics which do not seem properly to 
belong tothe public. To avoid this difficulty the detailed statistics do not give these 
items in the reports as published. The following tables give the number of volumes 
in libraries, the value of buildings and grounds, the amount of State and municipal 
aid, the income from tuition fees, and the amount received from other sources. They 
are Elven as being very incomplete and therefore do not need much explanation, 
Table vil is a summary of financial statistics for public high schools and Table 1x 
the same showing for private academies, seminaries, etc.

I.—UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
Number of institutions.—The number of institutions included in the table devoted 
to the statistics of universities and colleges for the year 1890~91 is 430. This is an 
increase of 15 over 188990. 
Character of institutions.—The institutions included under the above head may be 
divided into two classes, viz, colleges for males only and coeducational colleges. 
The fact that some of the older institutions of the country are gradually removing 
the barriers to the admission of women seems to justify the insertion of the fol- 
lowing summarized statement showing the number of colleges for males only and_ 
the number of coeducational colleges in the several States, together with the number 
of college students in attendance during the year under consideration. The discus- 
sion of the different colleges for women only is given further on.

The above table shows that 282 institutions, or 65.6 per cent of the total number, 
are coeducational. The average number of students in attendance upon the several 
coeducational colleges was 99, while at the colleges for males it was 132. An exami- 
nation of the figures by divisions in the above table will show that coeducation has 
- made least progress in the North Atlantic division of the country, while in the North 
Central and Western divisions the number of institutions to which women are not 
admitted is comparatively small. 
The number of coeducational institutions in the eastern section of the country is 
increasing, as evidenced by the recent action of some of the older New England in- 
stitutions, viz, Tufts College, Mass.; Brown University, Providence, R.I.; and Yale 
University, New Haven, Conn. 
The trustees of Tufts College voted to open the college in all departments to 
women on the same terms as to men, beginning with the year 1892~93. 
The action taken by Yale on the question of admitting women is contained in the 
report of President Dwight for the year 1891, from which the following is taken: 
“Near the close of the year a committee of the philosophical faculty, which had 
been appointed at an earlier date, took into serious consideration certain new 
arrangements and provisions connected with the courses of study in the graduate 
department. The report which they made, and which was subsequently reeom- 
mended by the faculty and adopted by the corporation, was not presented until after 
the end of the year 1891. * * * The committee recommended that five fellowships, 
yielding $400 each, and twenty scholarships, yielding $100 each and covering the 
expense of tuition, should be established in the graduate department immediately,
-P-A-G-E-167

on the foundation of present university funds. . These fellowships they recommended 
should be opened to graduates of all colleges and universities whose membership in 
the department should begin not more than five years after their reception of the | 
bachelor’s degree. They also recommended that in the academic year 1891-92, and 
afterwards, the courses for graduate study, leading to the degree of doctor of phi- 
losophy, should be open to graduates of all colleges and universities without distinc- 
tion of sex. The first of these provisions will prove to be of great advantage to well 
qualified and gifted students who, after graduation at any of our higher institutions 
of learning, may desire to prosecute further studies in our university, and to avail 
themselves of the privileges which it offers. The latter will present to the gradu- 
ates of our leading colleges for young women, as well as to those of similar colleges 
for young men, the opportunities which an old and large university affords. It is 
believed that the opening of these opportunities to young women who have previ- 
ously advanced to such a point in their studies in the institutions founded especially 
for them will prove to be a great advantage to the, cause of the higher education. 
The objections which occur to many minds as bearing against the union of the two 
sexes in the same institution in the courses of undergraduate study haye no existence 
or force as related to the uniting of the two in the graduate courses. The privilege 
of coming under the instruction of the best and ablest professors in a large uni- 
versity, of using its libraries, and of enjoying the many facilities for study under 
the highest advantages which it furnishes, must be a privilege of inestimable value. 
The university becomes by the offering of this privilege, not a rival or opponent of 
the colleges for women, but an ally and helper to them. It offers its graduate courses 
and its degree of doctor of philosphy to their graduates, and thus presents its gifts to 
these graduates as an addition to the gift which they have already received from 
their own institutions. It is gratifying to observe the favorable reception which 
has been given to this new plan and arrangement by the public and the friends of 
education everywhere.” 
The question of rendering the appliances of Brown University available to young 
women, has received more or less attention from the corporation since 1885. A plan 
for the admission of women was adopted in 1886, but was never put into execution. 
In 1888 the corporation deemed it unwise to open its doors to women, but recom- 
mended that the faculty prepare a scheme by which women might be admitted to 
college examinations and receive certificates of proficiency. In accordance with this 
recommendation the faculty in February, 1890, prepared the following rules, which 
were approved by the corporation: 
“Young women may be admitted to examinations in Brown University on the fol- 
lowing conditions: 
“First. They shall take the entrance examinations at the same times and places 
and under the same conditions as young men. 
“Second. The advanced examinations they shall take at the college. 
“Third. In order to be admitted to advanced examinations, candidates must have 
passed all the entrance examinations and all examinations which cover the work of 
previous terms; but candidates may present certificates in place of entrance exam-. 
inations,.subject to the same conditions which apply to young men. 
“Fourth. The subjects for women’s examinations, when not identical with those in 
ihe courses of instruction given in college, shall in all cases closely correspond to 
em. 
“Fifth. For an entire set of entrance examinations or of advanced examinations, 
each candidate shall pay $10. For any extra examinations the fee shall be at the 
rate of $20 per set. Reports of proficiency will be given after all examinations. 
Upon the satisfactory completion of any course of study candidates will receive cer- 
tificates of their attainments.” 
‘The above rules were in force during the year 1891~92, and thirteen young women 
availed themselves of the opportunities offered. In order to acquire the knowledge 
necessary to pass the examinations, women’s classes in all freshman studies were 
formed outside of college and received instruction substantially the same as that 
received by freshmen in college. As to graduate instruction for women the faculty, 
during the year 189192, recommended “that to women holding bachelors’ degrees, 
and, by special permission, to other women of liberal education, all the courses of 
instruction in the university intended for graduate students be opened on the same 
terms as to men.”?! 5 
At the close of the session of 1892 the trustees of Georgetown Coilege, George- 
town, Ky., determined to admit young ladies to the college tentatively. If coedu- 
pation is found to work favorably the doors will be opened permanently to young 
adies. ae

The above table is self-explanatory and needs but a few words in the way of com- 
ment. It will beseen that a considerable proportion of the teaching force is composed 
of women, but it may be well to state that a large number of them are engaged as 
Especially noticeable is the very small number of 
women professors in the professiorral departments. 
Students.—The number of students enrolled in universities and colleges during the 
year shows a gratifying increase over the number enrolled in 1889-90. The princi- 
re items respecting the attendance and classification of students is given in the fol- instructors in music, art, ete.

820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
This table shows that the total number of students in attendance upon all the 
courses of study of the several institutions was 124,684, of which number 29,734, or 
almost 24 per cent, were women. Of the 47,535 students in the regular college de- 
partments almost 20 per cent were women. ‘The number of students in the graduate 
departments shows a marked increase over last year’s figures. As will be seen by 
the footnotes appended to the above table, 930 of the graduate students were non- 
residents; that is, students pursuing advanced courses of study at their homes or 
places other than the institutions at which their names are enrolled. The total 
number of students enrolled in graduate departments was 2,863, of which number 
but 8.6 per cent were women. ! 
Notwithstanding the considerable increase in the number of institutions, it is 
found that the number of students in the preparatory departments was less than 
during the preceding year. The University of Kansas reports that no preparatory 
work will be done by that institution after the close of the year 1890-91.. This goes 
to show that the academies and high schools are now able and willing to prepare 
students for the freshman class of the university, thus allowing the entire force of 
the university to be devoted to college and university work. 
The number of students in the several degree and other* courses is also given in 
the above table. As will be seen, a large number of students were enrolled in nor- 
mal and business courses. Besides these, there are also courses in music, art, ete., in 
a large number of the institutions. 
The following table shows the percentage of college students in the several de- 
gree courses offered by 368 universities and colleges:

RATIO OF COLLEGE STUDENTS TO POPULATION. 
The ratio of college students to population is an important item of information; 
and one whichis frequently called for by correspondents of the Bureau. The ratio of 
the total number of college students to the total population of the country is easily 
obtained, but to arrive at the ratio for any one State or section of the country re- 
quires the expenditure of a considerable amount of time, though this is undoubt- 
edly justified by the facts obtained. 
This office possesses as complete a file of the catalogues. of the colleges as it has 
been possible to obtain, and these have been fully examined for the purposes of this 
investigation. 
residences of the students enrolled in the institutions of eac! It has been necessary to examine each catalogue to find the State 
State. Satisfactory 
information respecting the students was obtained from the catalogues of but 361 
institutions. This was due to the fact that some institutions do not publish the 
residence of the students, while others, though giving the residence of the students, 
do not distinguish between college and other students. Students in the collegiate 
departments only have been considered, all preparatory and professional students 
Technological schools are not included. 
To give the residence of students in edch individual institution concerned would 
require more space than can be given to the subject. 
investigation have been somewhat condensed, the State residences of students at- 
tending the colleges of the several States being given. 
The first part of the table, pp. 822-826, gives merely the State residences of the stu- 
dents, while the ratio of college students tothe population will be found on p. 827. 
We find that frequently a ratio of college students to population for the several 
States is obtained by dividing the population of the several States by the number of having been excluded. 
students attending college in the respective States. Therefore the results of the 
In order to show the difference 
between the results obtained by each method, both have been here employed, and 
the results obtained embodied in the table. 
It will be seen, for example, that although there are 1,773 students in the colleges 
of Connecticut, only.802 students from Connecticut were enrolled in the 361 insti- 
tutions included in Table 5, showing that while the real ratio in this case is 930, the 
one given to the State by the other method is 421. In the case of Delaware more 
students of the State attend the colleges of the country than are enrolled in, the 
college of the State. Similar instances will be found throughout the table.

The number of bound volumes in the libraries, 4,542,902, shows an increase of 
390,849 volumes during the past year. Besides the bound volumes, there were 
pamphlets to the number of 796,333 reported. This number should undoubtedly be 
very much larger than it is, for in a large number of the institutions the pamphlets 
een neither numbered nor catalogued, thus making it impossible to render a report 
of them. 
Benefactions.—The amount of benefactions received by these institutions during 
the past year through gifts and bequests was $6,849,208. This does not include the 
famous Fayerweather bequest nor the large amounts given to the University of Chi- 
cago. The former bequest not having been paid over to the several institutions 
interested during the year under consideration, it will be included in’ the report for 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. : 829 
1891~92. The amounts received by the University of Chicago will appear in the re- 
port for 189293, the year of the opening of the institution. It will be seen that the 
North Atlantic division again fared better in the matter of benefactions than any 
of the other divisions, $2,933,656 being reported by thirty-four of the seventy-three 
institutions included in this section. 
Degrees.—Excluding degrees in law, medicine, and theology, the total number of 
degrees conferred on examination in 1890-’91, asreported to this Bureau, was 6,452. 
The following summarized statement gives the name and number of each kind of 
degree conferred in the several States:

The classification of the institutions known as colleges for women has for a num- 
ber of years received the earnest consideration of this office. 
way of arriving at any definite classification are so serious and so numerous that , 
but little progress has been made in this direction. ' These difficulties were fully ex- 
plained in the Annual Report for 1886~’87, p. 642. At that time these institutions — « 
were divided into two classes, ‘‘the one including asmall number of colleges organ- x 
ized upon the usual plan of the arts colleges; the other large class of colleges and . 
seminaries, most of which make provisions for a complefe course of instruction, be- 
ginning at a-very elementary stage and carrying pupils on to graduation.” This 
classification, maintained since then, is, in a measure, unsatisfactory, but is retained 
_at present for want of a better. . The obstacles in the

Thé above table shows that the number of these institutions is at present 15, of   which number 12 are included in the North Atlantic Division. It will also be seen 
that the proportion of preparatory students to the total number is very small in this 
section, but six of these institutions maintaining preparatory departments. The 
cause of higher education for women has been greatly strengthened by the action 
of a few of the older institutions of the North Atlantic ao in admitting wo- 
men to their eed departments. >.

The foregoing table includes the statistics of 152 institutions, 108 of which are 
in Southern States, while in the North, especially the north central and western 
sections where coeducation has a firm hold, the number of colleges for women is 
comparatively small. 
Comparing the statistics of these two classes of institutions we find that w hile 
the average number of professors to an institution in the first class is 30, in tha 
second class it is only 11. In the same way, the average number of students to e 
professor in the first class is 7, while in the second class it is 12. In the latter 
class we also find that the proportion of male instructors is very small. . 
Another interesting point to be observed relates to the matter of benefactions. 
Comparing this item in the two tables it will be seen that while the institutions in 
the first division number less than one-tenth of those in the second division, the 
amount of the benefactions received by the first division is more than three times the 
amount received by the second division. This may perhaps be due to the fact that a 
large number of the institutionsin the second division are purely private property and 
are carried on for what the proprietors can make out of them. 
The following table gives the degrees conferred by the several colleges for women. 
As will be seen, the number of honorary degrees is comparatively small, the total 
number, 14, being conferred by two institutions.

A scholarship, as defined by Webster, is a foundation for the support of a student, 
or maintenance for a scholar. The income from scholarships depends entirely upon 
the amount of the principal invested for this special purpose, and in a majority of 
cases covers merely what is known as the tuition fee. In other cases the income is 
gonsiderebly, greater, and very often is sufficient to defray all expenses while at col- 
lege. 
The plan of founding scholarships usually adopted is to bequeath or set aside a 
certain sum or sums of money, only the income of which is to be paid to the person 
or persons who become the holders of the scholarships. - 
It is often demanded as a condition for obtaining the scholarships that the appli- 
cants shall be indigent and unable without this assistance to pursue a college course. 
This condition has been objected to by a number of writers on this subject, promi- 
nent among them being ex-President J. L. Pickard, of the State University of Iowa. 
This gentleman, at the meeting of the National Educational Association, in July, 
1890, read a paper on scholarships, in which he said: : 
‘‘Scholarships have been devised as a means whereby the best talent may be en- 
couraged in pursuit of an education. To the system as practiced there are some 
serious objections. 
“*(1) They are in the wrong hands. They are under the control of men who have 
no opportunity of selecting from the mass the most promising youth, but who must 
make their selection from those who present themselves as candidates for assistance. 
This class of candidates may be of the very best material. The chances are, how- 
ever, that very many will be found among them whose only ambition is to secure an 
easier place than that assigned them by fortune. The same amount of money con- 
trolled by those who know more of the native energy of the young man before he 
becomes an applicant for help, by those who are seeking the material fit for molding, 
and who will give just enough encouragement to secure on the part of the benefic- 
iary the best effort of which he is capable, will do far more good than the alluring 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
836 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
baits held out before young men who are watching, not working, for better place. 
If the men who endow scholarships would select their own beneficiaries there would 
be a better use of the money given in many instances. 
“(2) They are designated as helps to indigent students, so that the recipients are 
at once set over by themselves as a distinct class. To a young man of spirit there 
is much that is repulsive in such a classification. If by his own efforts he is securing 
an education he is respected. Many a young man desirous of socialstanding attempts 
to conceal the fact that he is supported by trust funds, and, unable to conceal it, he 
would make it appear that he is not at all dependent upon them, and expends upon 
luxuries what he receives for his necessities. 
“(3) The considerations already adduced lead naturally to this, that scholarships 
as ordinarily administered do not secure the end sought. They do not bring out the 
talent which poverty keeps latent. They do bring forth those who will ever be 
dependent. Most strenuous efforts have been made in the direction of aid to pro- 
fessional students of one class. No profession shows a larger proportion of imprac- 
tical men. Freed from the cares of life during the period of preparation, they have 
failed to receive the training which acquaintance with practical affairs gives one 
who is compelled to meet and conquer difficulties as he earns his own living.” 
To remedy these defects the same writer suggested: 
_“(1) Let wealthy men who desire to aid worthy students select their own benefi- 
ciaries. 
«<(2.) Let the mark of indigence be taken from the recipients of scholarships 
already established by throwing them open to competition. There need be no fear 
that the most needy will not take the largest share of the benefits, and. 
“(3) Not poverty but pluck will win the coveted aid, and the recipient will not 
be a dependent upon the bounty of another, but will receive the wages he has fairly 
earned.” 
The number of scholarships and loan funds is constantly increasing. An attempt 
has been made to collect statistics on this subject, and the data, though not com- 
plete, are as follows:

The detailed information is given in the following tables. Besides the institutions 
included in these tables, a large number of the State universities do not charge 
tuition, especially for students from their own States. If the tuition thus made free 
was included in the preceding summary, the amounts would be considerably larger 
than thus appears: .

IV.—UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 
REMARKS BY COLLEGE PROFESSORS. 
At the close of the scholastic year 1890-91, a blank form of inquiry containing the 
question, “‘ What, if anything, has been done by your institution, or by the professors 
connected therewith, in the work commonly known as university extension,’ was 
sent to the colleges and universities of the country. The following replies have been 
received: 
Delaware College, Newark, Del.—We have a center located here of which the college 
president is president. A course of lectures was delivered last winter in the college 
auditorium by Prof. Richard G. Moulton. None of our professors have thus far been 
called upon to lecture. (President A. N. Raub, Ph. D.) . 
University of IUinois, Champaign, Ill.—In the exact and specific sense, nothing. 
In a collateral sense, at farmers’ and teachers’ institutes, probably 200 lectures dur- 
ing last year to audiences of 200 to 1,000 each. (Regent Selim H. Peabody, LL. D.) 
Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.—A series of lectures in Indianapolis on eco- 
nomic and social problems by Dr. J. W. Jenks, under the auspices of the collegiate 
alumne. Many lectures in various parts of the State by different professors, these 
usually single. (President David 8. Jordan, LL. D.) 
The faculty of the Indiana University, desiring to increase the usefulness of a 
State institution, purpose to undertake what is known as university extension. 
In extending its work to the homes of students, the university will adopt for the 
present three methods—the first as practiced many years successfully in England, ~ 
the others as thoroughly tested in this country, namely: (1) Weekly lectures followed 
by examination, (2) summer schools, (3) correspondence. The departments in which 
the university offers these methods of extension for the college year 1891~92 are as 
follows: Greek, Latin, romance languages, Germanic languages, English, rhetoric 
and oratory, European history, American history, economics and social science, 
philosophy, pedagogics, mathematics, pure and applied, physics, chemistry, geology, 
zoology, botany, law. (Indiana University Extension Teaching Circular for 1891~92.) 
Indiana Normal University, Evansville, Ind.—The public has been invited to certain 
regular classes, as this spring (1), a course of lectures on experimental and compara- 
tive psychology (physiological, abnormal, etc.), given by President Fulcomer and 
attended by teachers and other specialists; (2) a course on English history, by Prof. | 
Stoaks; free evening “Chalk Talks,” lectures on art, and elocutionary entertainments, 
etc., have been given. A woman’s club, for the study of children, is conducted by 
Miss Brooks, and attended by ladies of prominence. Paid evening and Saturday 
classes, to accommodate teachers and others; ten or fifteen teachers’ institutes, of 
counties and townships, have been attended by professors (placed on programmes), 
at the expense of the university. (President Daniel Fulcomer, A. M.) 
Moore's Hill College, Moore’s Hill, Ind.—Valuable efforts are put forth in the sur- 
rounding portion of the State in the way of lectures and work generally before 
" young people’s scientific and other societies. (President J. H. Martin, D. D.) 
Lenox College, Hopkinton, Iowa.—The university extension will fail to catch the col- 
lege spirit and will lose the molding of character that is usually found in a college 
course. (President Alex. G. Wilson, D. D.) 
University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kans.—Nothing in true university extension. 
Lectures, 100 altogether, have been delivered during the year by various members 
of the faculty. (Chancellor F. H. Snow, Ph. D., LL. D.) 
For the season of 1891~92, the university offers 19 courses of lectures to communi- 
ties desiring them. Persons who hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the Uni- 
versity of Kansas, or from other institutions of equal rank with it, may receive the 
degree of Master of Arts upon the satisfactory completion of nine university exten- 
sion courses of twelve lectures each. These courses shall be accompanied by such 
study, reading, and examination as shall be prescribed by the professors in charge. 
Persons not holding the bachelor’s degree, upon the satisfactory completion of nine 
university extension courses of twelve lectures each, shall receive a university exten- 
sion diploma. ; 
Work done under instructors from other institutions than the University of Kansas 
will be accepted upon examination for not more than four of the nine courses for a 
degree or a diploma. This work will also be accepted as undergraduate work, a 
full course in university extension being reckoned as a two-thirds term in the uni- 
versity. Nine twelve-lecture courses will be accepted as equivalent to one full year’s 
work at the university. 
The records of all work done under the direction of the University of Kansas will 
be kept on file at the university. Not more than one lecture per week will be given 
in any one of the courses.

Wm. O. Rogers.) 
Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me.—At the last meeting of the boards they author- 
ized three courses of lectures by professors, net expenses not to exceed $300. (Presi- 
dent Wm. De Witt Hyde, D. D.) Sv. Johns College, Annapolis, Md.—Two or three lectures were given by myself and 
the faculty in connection with this work, but the college is at present waiting for 
more improvement, and is desirous of taking part in some more definite organiza- 
tion than at present exists in this State. (President Thomas Fell, LL. D.) 
Morgan College Baltimore, Md.—The Johns Hopkins professors and fellows have 
delivered two courses before the school, and Professor Moulton, of England, has 
_ also lectured before our students. (President Francis J. Wagner.) 
Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.—The Prospect Progressive Union was or- 
ganized as an attempt to bring university men into contact with that numerous 
class of persons who are at present largely beyond the sphere of university influence. 
The Union began active operations in January, 1891, by engaging rooms in the old 
Prospect House, Cambridgeport, and offering courses in various subjects under the 
direction of college men, with occasional public lectures and entertainments. Dur- 
ing the year the membership rose to nearly 200, of whom over 100 received definite 
course training. Thirty-seven students were engaged in instructing, and others as- 
sisted actively in the administration of the Union. The number of regular courses 
was 24 and included drawing (free-hand and mechanical), arithmetic, algebra, 
geometry, German, French, constitutional government, bookkeeping, penman- 
ship, history, English grammar and composition, and political economy. In addi- 
tion to the regular courses about 20 men received private instruction through the 
Union. The entertainments included lectures by Prof. James, on Hypnotism; 
Prof. Norton, on Illustrated Newspapers; Prof. Peabody, on Codperation; Mr. J. G. 
» Brooks, on Single Tax; a number of talks on Botany by Mr. G. J. Pierce, and a 
concert by the Freshman Glee and Banjo Clubs of the college. 
From the start the Prospect Union has been successful in demonstrating that there 
is a genuine demand for university instruction and culture on the part of the people 
whom it has tried to reach, and that there is an earnest response to this demand on 
the part of the student body which may easily be made more effective. Inthe future 
the Union aims to extend its work so as to meet more completely the desire for edu- 
cation on the part of the people on the one hand, and so as to render effective the 
ethical spirit of the university on the other. Without encroaching in anyway upon 
the claims of other charitable work it aims to commend itself more distinctly and 
directly to the university as a Harvard enterprise in which every Harvard man can 
feel an interest and bear apart. With such an extension of its work as the active 
support of the university would make possible, the Prospect Progressive Union can 
hope to occupy such a position with reference to Harvard as Toynbee Hall and 
Oxford House with reference to the English universities. (Handbook of Young Men’s 
Christian Association of Harvard University.) 
French Protestant College, Springfield, Mass.—We are generally in favor of carrying 
the university extension idea too far. We believe care needs to be exercised on this 
matter, else a class of narrow specialists will be created and men of broad scholar- 
ship will diminish. (President C. E. dmaron, A. UM.)

Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Bik Nose except that, associated with Bates Col- 
lege, Lewiston, Me., a correspondence school has been established for the purpose of 
iving instruction in theology to those not able to attend college. Two of our pro- 
fe ssors have appointments in said school. (Secretary Llon G, Reynolds.) 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.—A course in English literature was 
given last winter in St. Paul by our professor of English; a course in political science 
by our professor of political science, and a course in history by our professor of his- 
tory. These were all so successful that without doubt they will be repeated during 
the coming year. (Registrar L. B. Johnson.) 
Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, N. Y.—Several lectures have been given 
by different members of the faculty upon invitation of the university extension com- 
mittee, and our rooms are thrown open for other lecturers. (President David H. 
Cochran, LL. D. 
Columbia College, New York, N. Y.—H. H. Boyesen, pu. D., professor of the Germanic 
languages and literatures, delivered four courses of lectures in the university and 
school extension, two courses being upon modern German literature and two others 
upon mediwval German literature. John W. Burgess, PH. D., LL. D., professor of his- 
tory and constitutional law, delivered two courses of lectures in the university and 
school extension, one course being upon medieval relations of church and State 
and the other upon modern relations of church and State. (President Seth Low, LL. D.) 
University of Rochester, Rochester, N. Y.—A few lectures have beén given in ad- 
joining cities and towns. (President David J. Hill, LL. D.) 
Trinity College, N. C.—This department is now being organized, though a good 
deal of work has been done by lecturing in academies ani before farmers’ institutes 
on economic and scientific subjects. An extended programme is being arranged. 
(President John I. Crowell, Litt. D.) 
University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.—It [the university] has established, in 
1891, courses of thirty lectures each in the three subjects of history, Latin, and chem- 
istry, given on Saturdays and intended to meet more especially the needs of the 
large body of teachers within easy reach of the university. Seventy are enrolled 
in these courses. It has also given annual coursés of six lectures, nen to the gen- 
eral public, which have been well attended. (Dean W. R. Benedict, C. EF.) 
Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio.—A course of lectures by different members of the 
faculty has been carried on through the year at Oberlin, and lectures in Cleyeland 
and other cities as opportunity offered. (President W. @ Ballantine, D, D., LL. D.) 
Haverford College, F ‘Dr. Crew, professor of physics, gave two courses of six 
lectures each on electricity. (President Isaac Sharpless, Sc. D., LL. D.) 
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.—The American Society for the Exten- 
sion of University Teaching has its center here, Prof. E. J. James being president. 
Eighteen of our professors and instructors take an active part in the work. (Jesse 
¥; “Burk, Secretary.) * 
‘Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa.—Dr. Spencer Trott, aoe of biology, has 
ak course of lectures on zodlogy in Philadelphia. (President W. H. Appleton, 
Ph. D. 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.—For a number of years the leading English 
- universities have been endeavoring to extend the benefits of university instruction 
to the people in various parts of ‘the kingdom through courses of lectures accom- 
panied by class work, special studies, and examinations. The movement was at first 
of slow growth, but at length took’ strong hold upon the more progressive classes 
and has become one of the most important departures in university effort. Last 
year more than 40,000 students were enrolled as regular attendants upon the courses 
offered. The effort is known as University Extension. 
Quite independently of this, an analogous movement in popular education, aguas 
in a more specialized field, was started in Wisconsin six years ago by the enactment 
of a law establishing agricultural institutes and making a generous appropriation 
for their maintenance. The attendance upon these institutes, and their success in 
awakening thought, has closely approximated that of the English system. There is 
a radical difference between the two, however, in the fact that the English instruc- 
tion lies chiefly in literary, historical, and scientific lines, and is esssentially cul- 
tural, while the Wisconsin effort has been essentially industrial. It is obvious that 
the two systems are complements of each other and that their union is necessary 
to a complete system. 
Some tentative efforts in the direction of literary and scientific popular instruction 
have been made by the university with a view to proving the ground preliminary to 
a more formal effort. More extensive endeavors have been made at the East with 
such success as to warram more systematic efforts. 
By recent action of the regents and the faculty of the university the English uni- 
versity extension system has been formally adopted, and steps will be taken for 
Sarrying ib into effect at the opening of the coming year. The plan adopted will be 
essentially that which has proved successful in connection with the English uni- 
-versities,   
   
-P-A-G-E-198
  846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
By a similar action of the regents and faculty the American correspondence system 
of promoting advanced private study has been adopted and will be definitely formu- 
lated at the opening of the coming year. The correspondence system is inferior to 
the lecture and class system in that it lacks the personal supervision and inspiration 
which are so important factors in the best education, but it has the compensating 
merit of being adapted to a sparse population, and to special students who can not 
gather themselves into classes or wudiences to receive lectures and personal instruc- 
tion. 
The scheme thus adopted is exceptionally comprehensive, embracing a combination 
of all the leading lines of effort which have proved successful in extending to the 
people a portion of the benefits of university education. (Catalogue of University of 
Wisconsin, 1890~91.) : 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN GEORGIA, 
University extension was inaugurated in the city of Atlanta, Ga., by the Young 
Men’s Library Association. Six courses of six lectures each were given during the 
ear 1890-91 by the members of the faculty of the University of Georgia on the fol- 
owing subjects: Mental science, biology, Roman law and jurisprudence, the Greek 
drama, building materials, and English language and literature. The fee for each 
course of lectures was fixed at $1, or $5 for the whole series of thirty-six lectures. 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN MINNESOTA. 
The first work of university extension instituted in this State began at St. Paulin 
March, 1890. At that time Prof. H. P. Judson, of the State University, delivered a 
course of lectures in United States history, supplemented by class work. There 
were about 60 or 70 persons in the class. At the same time classes of half 
that size were conducted in mathematics by Prof.James H. Boyd, of Macalester 
College; in geology, by Prof. Lucian Chaney, of Carleton College; in botany, by 
Prof. Conway McMillan, of the State University; in electricity, by Prof. F. 8. Jones, 
of the same, and in mechanics, by Prof. John H. Barr, of thesame. It was found 
that the members of the various classes, while sufficiently interested to listen to lec- 
tures of a somewhat popular character, were not inclined to hold themselves down 
to the requirements of a rigid course of scientific class work. The movement, how- 
ever, gave impetus to the establishment of a night high school. 
In the fall of the above-mentioned year, Professors G. E. McLean, W. W. Folwell, 
and H. P. Judson, all of whom are members of the State University faculty, delivered 
lectures respectively in English literature, political science, and United States his- 
tory. These were duplicated in Minneapolis, but at St. Paul all save the course in 
history were dropped after the Christmas holidays. This same season the movement 
extended feebly to two or three places, like Faribault and Duluth.—(D. L. Kiekle, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, St. Paul, Minn.) 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN RHODE ISLAND, 
The following description of university extension work in Rhode Island was fur- 
nished by Prof. Wilfred H. Munro, a.M., director of university extension of Brown 
University: 
“Tn the academic year 1890-91 university-extension work, as such, was begun 
experimentally in Providence and in Pawtucket, R. I., by Profs. Bailey, Bumpus, 
Upton, and Williams, of Brown University. Lecture courses were given by these 
gentlemen in botany, biology, astronomy, and German literature. The audiences 
were large and the interest they manifested was most gratifying. 
“As a result of these experimental courses, the corporation of Brown University, at 
its meeting in June, 1891, voted to make extension teaching a part of its scheme of 
work, appointed one of the faculty as director of the university extension, and 
granted permission to all the members of the faculty to engage in extension teaching 
whenever they could do so without detriment to their regular college work, 
“The peculiar situation of Providence, in the midst of a large and compact popu- 
lation, and its excellent railway facilities, enable the university to accomplish more 
in this line than is possible for most institutions. In order to reach the largest num- 
ber (and because the lecturers feel that they ought to do, at least at the outset, 
much missionary work), the lecturer’s fee has been placed at $100 for a course of 
twelve lectures. No half courses are given. This low charge makes it possible for 
centers to be organized in small towns and for the most part results in small classes 
of from 30 to 50 persons, that is, in classes having about the number of students 
which the best schools ordinarily assign to one teacher. The element we make most 
pace is the teaching element. Our object is not to amuse, but to instruct.

Small classes do better work than large ones in the extension not less than in the 
regular university work, and the personality of the instructor counts for much 
more. 
«With one exception all our lecturers are members of our own faculty. There is 
no ‘green material’ in the force, and the work done is consequently more systematic 
and thorough than. is usually the case with early extension teaching. The director 
knows personally the capabilities of his men and can place them to the best advan- 
tage. 
© Not so much importance has been given to the syllabus as is usually assigned to 
it. Except in a very few instances no syllabi have thus far been printed. The lec- 
tures have been prepared with special reference to the needs of the particular audi- 
ence before which they were to be delivered, and the lecturers have not hesitated to 
vary them whenever it seemed wise to do so. This has required more labor on the 
part of the instructor, but the benefit to the class has been great. Not unfrequently 
written lectures prove to be beyond the comprehension of those who listened to them ; 
and if in such a case a east iron syllabus has to be used much harm results, All the 
Brown University lecturers have prepared full analyses, which have most frequently 
been dictated to tho class, and all furnish full bibliographies. All givespecial prom- 
inence to their class work. % 
“ All ages and conditions of life are found in the classes. The larger proportion 
of the members are women; but two centers are composed entirely of men. One 
of these latter—in practical physics—is made up almost entirely of skilled mechan- 
ies from the famous factory of the Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company. The 
other numbers upon its roll only members of the Young Men’s Debating Society, in 
whose rooms it meets. These young men are all of foreign—English, Scotch, and 
Irish—descent. 
“The place of meeting is almost always a schoolhouse. The use of such build- 
ings is gladly given by the school authorities. 
“ Twenty-one courses of lectures are now (January, 1892) being delivered by thir- 
teen lecturers in nine cities and towns of Rhode Island and Massachusetts; five 
courses in constitutional history, one in medieval history, one in botany, two in zo6]- 
ogy, one in physiology, one in political economy, six in English literature, two in 
physics, one in astronomy, and one in art and architecture.” 
AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TUE EXTENSION OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING. 
A brief account of the organization of this society, under the name of the Phila- 
delphia Society for the Extension of University Teaching, was given in the last 
annual report of this office. The society was organized in order to make an experi- 
ment in university extension in and around Philadelphia, Systematic instruction 
was begun at several points in November, 1890, and success was at once assured. 
The demand for courses from a distance was so great that it could not be met by the 
local society, so it was determined to establish a national society to aid in the inau- 
guration and prosecution of this important work. 
The object of this national society is very clearly described in a pamphlet issued 
by the society: 
“The American society proposes to collect information as to the experiments now 
going on in this work in the various parts of the world, and make it accessible to all 
who are interested in this movement. It will, as far as possible, form branch socie- 
ties to take up and push the work in and around their localities. It will try to se- 
cure a staff of persons trained by actual experience in organizing and lecturing, who 
may be placed at the disposal of the local societies to assist them in organizing and 
prosecuting the work. It will strive to make every college and university in the 
country a center of university extension.” 
The society publishes a monthly journal called the University Extension, which 
serves as a medium of communication between the society and the local branches, 
The journal contains many interesting and valuable articles on the subject of uni- 
versity extension, and gives full information concerning the progress of the move- 
ment throughout the world. 
The results of the work done by the American society can perhaps be best given 
by quoting from the report of the general secretary for the year 1890-91: 
“ast year 43 courses ete giv et with an average attendance of 9,160, whose ag- 
gtegate attendances numbered 60,573. There were 19 courses on literature, 8 on his- 
tory, 1 on descriptive astronomy, 4 on chemistry, 1 on psychology, 1 on biology, 2 
on botany, 2 on electricity, 1 on mathematics with applications to mechanics, 1 on 
algebra, and 1 on zodlogy. The most of these were six lectures in length; the aver- 
aee for the 43 courses being 7.6. The average attendance at the courses was 250. 
The number of those taking the examination, while not very large, was encouraging; 
231 passed successfully. Four of these were in geology, 11 in mathematics, 20 in
-P-A-G-E-200
  848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
algebra, 108 in literature, 7 in physics, 14 in history, 51 in botany, and 11 in psychol- 
ogy. 
eX rerenty-four of the students received two certificates, 9 three, 4 four, 1 five, and 
1six. Sixty-three per cent of those attending the lectures renfained to the class ex- 
ercises; 54 per cent of the class wrote weekly papers; 72 per cent of those writing 
weekly papers took the examination, and 93 per cent of these passed successfully. 
“The work thus far developed in this country differs very materially from that 
in England in these respects: the audiences are larger and seem to possess, as 
described by an English lecturer, more intellectual curiosity; the proportion of the 
audience which remains for the class is also larger. This, indeed, has very clearly 
shown that the English methods must be materially modified. It may be necessary 
to develop what might be called a second class for the real student nucleus, or, pos- 
sibly, as an alternate way out of the difficulty, we must look forward to well organ- 
ized students’ associations, presided over perhaps by assistant lecturers.”

the Extension of University Teaching during the year 1890-91:

  850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
A number of colleges and universities of this country have for some years been 
offering what are known as summer courses.of study. These courses are given dur- 
ing the summer vacation, and as a rule are not given under the responsibility or 
jurisdiction of the college faculty, but under that of the professors in charge of the 
several courses. This system of instruction was undertaken mainly to meet the 
wants of teachers and others who could not attend the regular college courses, and 
may well be termed a branch of university extension. . 
According to reports received, the privileges thus offered are taken advantage of 
by a comparatively largenumber of persons, especially teachers in secondary schools, 
who would otherwise not be able to enjoy the advantages offered by the large libra- 
ries and well-equipped laboratories of some of our largest and richest universities 
and colleges. Were it not for these summer courses the libraries and laboratories 
. would remain unused for the greater part of three months during each year. 
- At Harvard University the summer courses attracted so large a number of the 
regular college students that it was decided to count certain of the summer courses 
towards the acquisition of the bachelor’s degree. The action taken by the Harvard 
faculty is embodied in the report of the dean to President Eliot at the close of the 
year 1890-91, in which he says: 
‘While the faculty was engaged in preparing the list of courses of instruction to 
be provided for the year 1891-92, it found itself called upon to consider the condi- 
tions, under which courses given during the summer vacation might be counted 
towards the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of science. Such courses have 
been given for several years and have sometimes had a large attendance, especially in 
chemistry, physics, botany, geology, and physical training. Originally undertaken 
to meet the special wants of teachers and of other persons outside of the uni- 
versity; these courses have been carried on under the charge of a committee 
appointed by the president and fellows—in most cases, although not always, by 
members of the regular teaching force, but still in no way under the responsibility 
or jurisdiction of either of the faculties. Their proved usefulness has demonstrated 
the value of such concentrated study as was required of those pursuing them, and 
as time has gone on they have attracted an increasing proportion of students of the 
university. The college faculty more than once consented to recognize work done 
in some of these courses as work to be counted for the degree of bachelor of arts, 
but was reasonably unwilling to commit itself far in the direction of counting 
work not done under its control, or under the other safeguards which guarantee 
courses publicly given in term time. The need of some systematic provision as to 
the use of these courses by undergraduates continued to be felt, however, and the 
faculty, therefore, after full consideration, determined to admit to its list among the 
courses to be counted for the bachelor’s degreess, summer courses proposed under 
the responsibility of the proper departments and formally approved by the faculty, 
when carried on under the supervision of some regularly appointed officer of-in- 
struction, with proper tests of the systematic application and proficiency of the 
students and with a final examination in due form not later than October1. The 
further condition was imposed that not more than two summer courses, counted as 
the equivalent of half courses, should be taken in any one year. Under these con- 
ditions seven summer courses were proposed and approved—one-in German, two in 
engineering, one in physics, one in botany, and two in geology, together with one 
in geological field work, to be counted as a full or asa half course, according to the 
length of time for which it is followed. 
“Several summer courses outside of this list were pie as usual, without comply- 
ing with these conditions, and, therefore, without the privilege of counting for the 
degree, the departments concerned finding that the character of the courses, or the 
uses to which they were mainly adapted, did not make it worth while to bring them 
within the rules laid down by the faculty. Such courses will no doubt continue to 
serve the same excellent purpose as heretofore, extending some important benefits of 
the university equipment and methods to teachers and others who could not other- 
wise have access to them. The courses placed under the faculty’s rules, and there- 
fore to be counted for the degree, will have the signal advantage, considered as reg- 
ular courses of instruction, of enabling students to carry on important work, espe- 
cially in the natural sciences and in engineering, at the best season of the year, and 
with such freedom in the choice of place as is impossible for either student or instruc- 
tor in the ordinary working year of the university. 
“The general scheme of the courses adopted by the faculty calls, in most cases, for 
about six weeks of daily attendance, with a large amount of laboratory or field 
work, and the value of the work, as has often been shown, is much heightened by 
the interest and animation due to concentrated daily attention to only one or two- 
subjects. It is not to be assumed that the students would find equal profit from this 
method in all subjects. Upon many studies it is no doubt difficult to secure a firm
-P-A-G-E-203

hold without a certain time for reflection and for gradual assimilation, and some 
caution may be needed, then, in extending this arrangement to untried branches of 
work. So far as it can be carried safely, it promises to secure increased use for 
a part of the valuable scientific equipment and libraries of the university during a 
part of the year when the old division between term and vacation would keep them 
idle; and it also gives to the students the optional use, to a limited extent, of the 
long vacation. This fraction of the year has long been felt to be too important 
to be neglected, but the different needs of individuals, as well as the habits of a 
large part of the community, have stood in the way of any method of dealing with 
it so far proposed. The result of the present experiment of enabling earnest stu- 
dents in vigorous health to use, if they will, a part of the leisure time of the year 
in such studies as can then be pursued with the best advantage, must be observed 
with great interest.” a 
The number of persons that attended the summer courses at Harvard during the 
past three years is as follows: In the summer of 1889, 188; in the summer of 1890, 
279; and in the summer of 1891, 287. The amount of fees paid by students in the 
summer courses since 1886 is as follows: In 1886, $1,720; 1887, $4,060; 1888, $4,165; 
1889, $5,191; 1890, $6,345; 1891, $7,873.50. ‘ 
The Indiana University at Bloomington, Ind., opened its libraries and laboratories 
for vacation instruction in 1890. The catalogue of the university for 1891~92 con- 
tains the following description of the summer school connected with the university: 
“The Indiana University Summer School was organized for the purpose of extend- 
ing to those who are occupied during the school year the advantages of advanced 
instruction in certain departments, aided by the library, laboratories, and other ~ 
facilities for study connected with the university. The policy of the university 
in presenting thorough courses of study in each department, instead of multiplying 
short unrelated courses, is followed in the school. The instructors are all teachers 
in the university, and are specialists in the lines of study in which they offer courses _ 
of instruction. 
5 i Those whom the school is especially designed to serve may be enumerated as 
follows : 
‘*(1) Teachers in high schools, academies, etc.—A number of courses of study have been 
arranged for the purpose of aiding those who teach or wish to prepare themselves 
to teach in high schools, academies, and other schools of secondary instruction. In 
this connection may be named the courses in American literature, theory of arith- 
metic and of algebra, geometry, astronomy, elementary physics, chemistry, botany, 
and zoilogy. Itis not the intention to do review work in these courses, but to give 
larger views and more thorough and accurate knowledge of subjects. Methods of 
teaching the subjects in the high school will be incidentally treated. 
“ (2) Teachers in higher institutions, etc—The more advanced courses of instruc- 
tion, aided by the extensive library and well-equipped laboratories, are intended to 
accommodate teachers, students, and others who desire to carry on during the sum- 
mer studies in special lines, or to do work which will aid in completing a college 
course. Opportunity will be given anyone in attendance, to spend profitably one- 
half his time, or even more, in anyone of the courses taught by the laboratory 
method. By thus concentrating upon one or more subjects it is possible to complete 
the equivalent of two terms of university work in those subjects. Anyone com- 
pleting in a satisfactory manner courses of study in the school which are the equiv 
alent of courses in the curriculum of the university may be credited with such work 
upon the university record.” 
During the summer of 1891, 24 courses of lectures and instruction were given in 
the following subjects: Literature, 4; mathematics and astronomy, 7; physics, 5; 
chemistry, 4; biology, 4. 
Besides the above courses, there was given a course of 18 evening lectures upon 
various topics of interest to students and teachers. 
The number of persons in attendance at the summer school in 1890 was 31, while 
in 1891 the number was increased to 60. Of this number 37 were teachers in sec- 
ondary schools, 5 were professors in colleges, and 8 were students in colleges. 
Among the institutions offering instruction in summer schools are the following: 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.; Colorado College, Colorado Springs, Colo.; 
Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.; Cornell College, Mount Vernon, lowa; Am- 
herst College, Amherst, Mass.; Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.; Western 
Michigan College, Grand Rapids, Mich.; Hope College, Holland, Mich.; Cotner Uni-

institutes and summer schools are frequently organized and carried on at seaside 
and mountain resorts, where rest and intellectual improvement may be sought at 
the same time. Among such schools may be mentioned the following: 
Chautanqua Assembly, Chautauqua, N. Y.; Lake Madison (S. D.) Summer School; 
Seashore Normal Institute, West Chop, Martha’s Vineyard, Mass.; National Summer 
School, Glen Falls, N. Y.; Seaside Assembly, Avon-by-the-Sea, N. J.; Martha’s Vine-

V.—LATIN PRONUNCIATION IN UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, 
In the year 1876, Prof. W.G. Richardson a.M.,of Central University, Richmond, 
Ky., prepared an article on Latin pronunciation. This article, which included a 
short history of the methods of pronunciation, a description and bibliography of 
the Latin or Roman method, and a list of the institutions employing the several 
methods, was published in the annual report of this office for 1876. 
For some time past the Bureau has been receiving inquiries concerning the extent 
to which the several methods of pronunciation are at present used by the univer- 
sities and colleges of thiscountry. In order that these inquiries might be answered 
a special letter was sent to all such institutions. The letter was as follows: ¥ 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., May 16, 1892. 
PROFESSOR OF LATIN,     
Drar Str: In 1876, the Bureau published a list of colleges and universities, with 
the method of pronunciation then in use. Many changes having taken place since 
that time, it is now desired to revise the matter then collected. You are therefore 
requested to designate which one of the methods given below is used in your insti- 
tution. Any remarks you may wish to make will be thankfuily received. 
Very respectfully, 
Wm. T. Harris, 
Commissioner. 
1. Latin or Roman. 
2. Continental. 
3. English.     
Signature of reporting officer. 
In answer to this letter replies were received from 402 universities and colleges. 
From these replies we learn the following: 269 institutions use the Roman or Latin 
method, 59 institutions use the English method, 58 institutions use the Continental 
method, 10 institutions use the Roman and English methods, 2 institutions use the 
Roman and Continental methods, and 4 institutions give indefinite answers.

REMARKS BY PROFESSORS OF LATIN. 
In addition to the answers given in the preceding tabulation, a number of the 
professors of Latin gave their reasons for using the methods employed by them- 
selves. Some of these remarks are very interesting and profitable, as will be seen 
by an examination of them. The statements made are as follows: 
University of Alabama.—The Roman is our standard, but we teach the English 
goetnod also. Our students are trained to pronounce in both ways. (Prof. William 
. Wyman.) 
Hendrix College, Arkansas.—I use the Roman method, but am about persuaded that 
-the English method would, upon the whole, prove more satisfactory. (Prof. J. B. 
Clark.) University of California.—Roman. I do not feel quite satisfied with the weaken- 
ing of the v, especially as it has its full consonant power in Italianand = rench. On 
the whole, I wish (vain wish) that the English and Americans had adopted the 
Ttalian system. (Prof. Martin Kellogg.) 
Pierce Christian College, California. —We use the Continental, but it is my opinion 
that the English is the method for Americans. (President William Henslee.) 
Washington College, California.—We use the Roman method altogether. We think 
4¢ nearer correct, or nearer the ancient pronunciation, and there is a great gain to 
students who desire to study the leading modern languages of Europe, English 
excepted. (President J. C. Keith.) 
Pacific Methodist College, California.—In my opinion the Roman method is the 
proper one, and should be used by all instructors of the Latin language. (Prof. 
George W. Gooch.) 
Trinity College, Connecticut.—I use the English myself for most purposes, but Ido 
not require it of the students. (Prof. Samuel Hart.) 
Buford College, Georgia.—The Continental method is chiefly used as most euphonic 
and as more suitable where Spanish is spoken by many. . English pronunciation is, to 
my mind, too harsh. (President Lamont Gordon.) 
Clark University, Georgia.—We have used the English method up to this point, but 
intend a change to the Roman next year. (Prof. W. H. Crogman.) 
Hedding College, Illinois.—We use the English method; will probably introduce 
the Roman next year. (Prof. V. C. Randolph.) 
Northwestern University, Illinois.—English used at present. Change to Roman an- 
- nounced. (Prof. Daniel Bonbright.) 
Illinois College.—English is now in use, but shall soon change to Roman. (Prof. 
AL. W. Johnston.) 
Northwestern College, Illinois.—English is used at present. Some thought of change. 
(Prof. Henry C. Smith.) 
Augustana College, Illinois.—The English method is foreign, and thus destructive 
to the character of the Latin language; the Continental method is less so, but lacks 
sufficient qualifications for becoming universally accepted; the Roman method, be- 
ing in full harmony with the character of the language, is the most natural, and has 
the best prospects of becoming universally adopted. The Roman method, therefore, 
is the only one that deserves to be favored. (Prof. C. O. Granére.) 
Wheaton College, [llinois.—We use the English method for thesereasons: 1. There is 
more or less uncertainty as to how the Romans sounded certain letters. 2. It is emi- 
nently more practical: (a) It enables the student, from resemblance of sounds, to 
detect the English word contained in the Latin; where such is the case, time and 
labor are saved, therefore, by transfering, or better, synonymizing. (b) Tt enables 
the student, in reading a page of English, to detect more readily from what Latin 
word it is derived, thus giving him its root meaning, etc. (Prof. B. S. Fox.) 
Wabash College, Indiana.—Roman preferred as being phonetic, and as better suited 
to the expression of Latin words and phrases. (Prof. H. M. Kingery.) 
Concordia College, Indiana.—We are still using the Continental method, but Iam 
personally in favor of adopting the Roman. (Prof. 0. Siemon.) 
Union Christian College, Indiana.—I consider the English method superior to all 
others, because itis a help in pronouncing English. (Prof. A. D. Woodworth.) 
Eartham College, Indiana.—English is used. There will probably be a change to 
the Roman at an early date. (Prof. Marianna Brown. ) 
German-English College, Iowa.—We employ the Roman method because we believe 
that it was the method employed by the Romans, and also that the vigor and force 
peculiar to any language is lost if the native and natural method of pronouncing 
such language is not retained. (Prof. P. P. Rodenberger.) 
Coe College, Iowa.—I find the Roman method is much easier to learn and is used 
more correctly. (Prof. R. A. Condit.) | 
Parsons College, Iowa.—I use the English in my class-room work, though during 
the last term in the course I teach the Roman as a matter of information. (Prof. R. 
A. Harkness.) E
-P-A-G-E-213
    '- HIGHER EDUCATION. : 861 
Western College, Iowa.—We regard the Roman method as the most natural and 
helpful. (Prof. H. W. War 
University of Kansas.—We use the Roman, because modern scholarship has shown 
it to be much nearer the pronunciation of Cicero than either of the others. (Prof. 
D. H. Robinson.) 
St. Mary’s College, Kansas.—We use the Continental method for vowels and diph- 
thongs and the English for consonants. (Prof. James J. O'Meara.) 
Wichita University. Kansas.—We have discarded the English and Continental meth- 
ods and use only the Roman. The last or Roman method is better adapted to the 
nature of the Latin language and consequently is more euphonic than the other 
methods. In my opinion the Roman method is the method to be used, not only in 
the universities but also in the high schools throughout the country. (Prof. 8. 4. 
Alt.) 
Berea College, Kentucky.—For some reasons I prefer the English, but it seemed to 
me necessary to change because of the large number of colleges using the Roman 
method and our students were confused when hearing the Roman method used. 
(Prof. B. 8. Hunting.) 
Kentucky University.—I think it very important that a movement should be made 
in the direction of securing that uniformity in the pronunciation of Latin out of liter- 
ary institutions chiefly by lawyers, physicians, and pharmacists, which the general — 
adoption of the ‘‘ Roman” system by Latinists has brought about in academies, col- 
leges, and universities. (Prof. A. 2. Milligan.) 
Straight University, Louisiana.—We use the Roman method in all our Latin work 
because, first, this approximates most nearly to the speech of the ancient Romans; 
second, its uniformity renders it easier than either of the other methods; third, the 
absence of all flat sounds of vowels renders the rhythm more pleasing to the ear. © 
(Prof. W. Scott Goss.) 
Bowdoin College, Maine.—The Roman method is used exclusively in Bowdoin College, 
and all fitting schools are urged to use it from the first. It is almost essential to 
any intelligent study of phonetic laws, of the language as a growth, or of compara- 
tive philology. Itis necessary, however, to have all long syllables matkedin advance 
as wellas elementary texts.. Otherwise we must choose bétween slovenly inaccuracy 
in pronunciation, or an insufferable and comparatively useless burden on the memory 
of teacher and pupils. (Prof. William C. Lawton.) 
Loyola College, Maryland.—The Continental method is used in uttering vowels, 
while the English is employed in the use of the consonants, (Prof. J. D. Downs. ys 
Washington College, Maryland.—The Roman pronunciation is taught in this college 
because it is believed to approximate more nearly than any other to the true one. 
(Prof. James R. Micon.) 
Olivet College, Michigan.—For scientific students, who take Latin two years for ety- 
mology merely, I note advantages in the English pronunciation; but for real Latin 
students who read the Latin of Cicero nothing equals the Roman method. The Roman 
method alone truly brings out the beauty of scansions in Virgil. (Prof. George N. 
Ellis.) 
Gustavus Adolphus College, Minnesota.—We use the English method of Latin pro- 
nunciation, although somewhat under protest. (1) Because we are supposed to be 
behind the age. (2) Because foreigners, especially the Germans and Swedes, prefer 
the broad vowel sounds which would correspond more with their languages. The 
reason I have adhered to the English was because I believe it to be of adecided advan- 
tage in acquiring the English: (1) In the study of derivation of English, but (2) 
especially for pronunciation.. We have even here at our institution men who were’ 
raised and educated in this country who invariably say ‘yeneral” for general, and 
“yust” for just, and instances of a like nature. One other thing I disapprove of in 
our Latin texts of late years, and that is the exclusion of the letter j. Although the 
ancient Latins may have known nothing of the letter j, yet since i must serve two 
purposes, viz, that of a vowel and a consonant, we may as well have a j and train 
our young people in a correct pronunciation of ‘that letter. (Prof. John Sander.) 
Mississippi College.—I am of the opinion that the beauty and harmony of the ‘lan- 
guage can be obtained through no method as satisfactorily as by the Roman method. 
(Prof. A. J. Aven.) 
Missouri Valley College.—I teach the Roman pronunciation with care, believing 
that it is decidedly better than the English method. Its superiority is unequivocal 
if the student is also to study another ‘foreign language. So far as my knowledge 
goes, the public schools in this State decidedly favor the English method. (Prof. 
Albert McGinnis.) 
Drury College, Missouri—The lack of uniformity in the practice of the schools 
makes it difficult to maintain a consistent pronunciation. (Prof. Arthur P. Hall.) 
Gates College, Nebraska.—The method of pronunciation is optional with the stu- 
dent, but some one system must be followed consistently. The Roman is recom- 
mended to the student, and is exclusively used by the instructors in this college.

  862 Sige EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, N. ¥.—The Roman pronunciation was adopted 
by us in about 1860. After using it some five years the faculty unanimously resolved - 
to go back to the English. The advantages of the Roman seemed to us trifling as 
compared with its disadvantages. At that time we consulted all leading colleges in 
this country, and also the Latin authorities in Oxford and Cambridge. One emi- 
nent Latin scholar remarked: ‘(If my Latin instruction is to be an impediment to 
the student of English, I will drop it.” We use the English, requiring the pupil to 
master the rules for Roman and Continental, but not their application in daily prac- 
tice. (President D, H. Cockran.) 
Vassar College, New York.—In addition to the quality given to each sound in pro- 
_ nunciation, I desire to call special attention to the importance of careful observ- 
- ance of the value of vewel quantities, whether long or short. Experience shows 
clearly that carelessness in this regard is a very prominent and serious defect in the 
use of any method of Latin pronunciation employed by American schools and col- 
leges. (Prof. J. Leverett Moore.) 
Findlay College, Ohio.—We use the Roman method. The reasons are as follows: 1, 
The analogy of vowel sounds to kindred languages. 2. The fitness of the pronun- 
eiation when acquired, and the ease of its acquisition. (Prof. Chas. T. Fox.) 
Hiram College, Ohio.—There are, at least, six good reasons for using the Roman 
method of pronunciation: (1) Statements of Roman writers, e.g.,M. Varro, Cicero, 
Quintilianus, and other writers. (2) Orthography of Latin. It was pronounced as 
spelled. (3) Roman sounds represented by Greek letters. (4) Comparison of Ital- 
ian, French, Spanish and Portugvese. (5) Tradition of scholars and of Roman 
Catholic church. (6) General principles of phonology. (Prof. EZ. L. Hall.) 
Richmond College, Ohio.—The English method is used because the students’ pro- 
anunciation of English is not injured. (President G. W. MacMillan.) 
Otterbein University, Ohio.—I have used the Roman method for twelve years and 
have always regarded it as the only rational one. (Prof. George Scott.) 
Wilberforce University, Ohio.—The Roman is used by us as we regard it the nearest 
approach to the method used by the Romans themselves. (Prof. W. 8. Scarborough.) 
niversity of Oregon.—We use the English. No one knows how Cicero pronounced 
hhis vernacular. There are some good reasons why we should use the English. I 
can’t conceive of any reason or any good sense in our attempting to pronounce the 
Latin as the Germans or the French do. (President J. W. Johnson.) 
South Carolina College.—I have been connected with the South Carolina College as 
professor of ancient languages nearly ten years, and during all that time have given 
ears to the English method of pronouncing Latin. At the same time; the 
oman and Continental methods are taught and explained for the benefit of the 
student, to whom the largest discretion is allowed, ithe sound of the vowels and con- 
sonants being regarded as a matter of taste, while a false quantity is a capital offense. 
* (Prof. £. L. Patton.) i: 
Erskine College, South Carolina.—The English method is employed as being that 
ae in our judgment, can be most consistently. followed throughout. (Prof. J. 
. Todd.) 
King College, Tennessee.—The Continental method is used. English method pre- 
ferred for aac purposes, and because the Continental is, after all, arbitrary. 
(Prof. G. W. A, Lyon.) 
Hiwassee College, Tennessee.—The Roman is foreign and unsatisfactory. There isno 
Continental method. English, by all means, for English-speaking peoples. (Presi- 
Gent J. H. Brunner.) 
Central Tennessee College, Tennessee.—The Roman method is used. Idonot approve of 
itfor ourstudents. Itsecms to interfere with their pronunciation of English and con- 
fuses them in getting the English of new words. So far as utility is concerned the 
pronunciation of Latin of course equals zero. I think Virgil would hardly under- 
stand one of our students reading or repeating the Aineid any more than the Pa- 
risian understands the French of one-half of our studentsof French. If our students 
necd to exercise their vocal organs in sounds not in our language the living lan- 
guages are open to us, and we can know when we are correct, more than can be said 
of any pronunciation of any dead tongue. (President J. Braden.) 
University of Texas—We use the Roman method as the only one that renders the 
euphonic laws intelligible, and as furnishing an invaluable key to the broad funda- 
ay facts of the phonetics of modern European languages. (Prof. Thomas Vitz- 
ugh.) Washington and Lee University, Virginia.—I use the quantitative Latin pronuncia- 
tion; have insisted on this for about fifteen years, and with fairly good results, 
especially in the recitation of verses. I find it very hard to impress teachers of 
preparatory schools with the importance of insisting upon quantity as well as qual- 
in rendering vowel sounds. I should be glad to see the quantity marked in 
school editions of Cwsar and Cicero. (Prof. C.J. Harris.) 
Bandolph-Macon College, Virginia.—I find the greater objection made to c and g

hard before ec andi, But little less is the objection to sounding v as w. While the z

and unnatural, pee in my judgment the weight of authority is decidedly in its 
favor. (Prof. J. L. Buchanan.)

Vowels. 
Long and short vowels generally differ in quantity, not quality, of sound. 
@ is Sounded like our a in Sather, Ithas the rich Italian sound of that letter as 
indicated in the dictionaries of Worcesterand Webster. The sounds we hear in fate 
and fat are unknown in the Latin a; so also is that intermediate sound, of which 
some otherwise good speakers are guilty in saying, or trying to say, “Our Father.” 
a has the sound of a in diadem. 
éis French ‘é, which Surenne properly represents as our ¢ in met, very slightly pro- 
longed. é is samein quality, differing only in quantity. Itis French é, or ¢, in met, 
still more prolonged than é in tres. Thus, féie, as rapidly enunciated among the 
Parisians, is represented in the works of English lexicographers by fate. This is 
certainly a convenient, approximate sound. 
a, as i in.machine; %,a8 tin purity. (See site in Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary.) 
6,asoinno. For & Roby gives dot, not, omit. 
a like oo in moon; % short, like w in full. 
y intermediate beween i and w. It is French w or German é (Miiller is nearer 
Miller than Muller). For convenience sake, then, rank y with i 
A short vowel rendered long by position, as, for instance, e in est and esse is still 
pronounced short. 
Great care should be taken as to final short syllables, e. g., essé, amatiir,amatis. 
Distinguish fructiis and fructiis. 
Diphthongs. 
In all these each element is heard. Let the combination be rapid. 
Ae or ai like ay (yes). In rapid utterance it is nearly our personal pronoun of the 
first person; 7 isa compound sound made up of ah and ee. See Walker’s Dictionary. 
au like ow in now. The analysis is ah-oo. The rapid combination is ow in now. 
ei as in vein, slightly drawled, and not like the English ¢ in time. 
eu as eh-oo; many give the sound of ew in Seud. 
oe or oi like oi in oil. 
ui like French oui; very nearly our pronoun we. 
The American Philological Association recommends the use of the Ttalian sounds 
of the vowels and diphthongs. 
Consonants. 
d, f, h, k, 1, », p, t, as in English. So }, like English b, except that bs=ps—thus, 
urbs, 007; ps. 
c always hard, like English k. (See Bullion’s Latin Grammar, section 17, 4, note.) 
g always hard, as in give. 
Zz Fike pi in hallelujah; 4. €., like y in yet. 
m at the end of words appears to have been scarcely audible. (Roby.) 
ne is like ngk; as ancéra, like anchor. 
ng like ngg; as frango, like anger. 
qu as in queen (Roby); but the combination guu was odious to the Roman eye and 
ear. For quum always write cum. Even equus and loquuntur may be barely toler- 
ated, and were usually written equos or ecus and locuntur. 
r always trilled, as in French. 
s always hissing, as in this; never like z; thus, nos, pes, trans. Every Englishcom-  , 
pound with trans should have the hissing sound. See the English dictionaries, 
‘Worcester, Webster, Smart. 
ti with the pure sound of ¢ always preserved. Thus, natio, nah-te-o, and not nd- 
she-o or nah-she-o. (See Bullion’s Latin Grammar, section 17, 4.) 
vis English w, or French ow in oui. 
@ is ks, never gz. 
z occurs only in words of Greek origin, and is pronounced like & Dr. Georg Cur- 
tius, in the elucidations of his Greek grammer (translated by Evelyn Abbott, John

Murray, London, pp. 233, 12 mo., $2), says: ‘‘Z, therefore, which is shown by pros- 
ody, to be a double consonant, must certainly be pronounced as dz, that is, d with a 
soft 8. 
ps preserves the sound of both its elements, as in psallo. 
ph, th, ch, Roby maintains, are not pronounced as in either English or in German, 
but as p+h,t+h,c+h, or the ordinary p, t, c, immediately followed by @ rough 
breathing. So Curtius as to the Greek; see Elucidations, p. 7. Those who would be 
annoyed by so much that is foreign to the English will take comfort in Hadley’s 
statement (see grammar, section 17). ‘The letters 9, 9, y, seem to have had at first 
the sound of ph, th, ch, in English uphill, hothouse, blockhead. But afterward they 
came to sound as in English graphic, pathos, and German machen, the last being a 
rough palatal sound, no longer heard in English.” Many orthoépists set down ch as 
practically k.

PROFESSIONAL ENSTRUCTION, = 
IL 
GRADUATION AND LICENSE. 
The recent activity of the State in matters pertaining to the public health and 
intelligence is well known. In a Republic composed, in matters pertaining to the 
professions of medicine, of law, and of teaching, of many independent Common- 
wealths, such as is the United States, a great difficulty is experienced in securing 
uniformity in the regulations governing either admission to or practice of those pro- 
fessions, Our country, therefore, as a national unit can 1fot be compared in the par- 
iculars mentioned above with the nations of Continental Europe, but such a com- 
on may very properly be instituted between any of the States of which the 
Union is composed and France or any other centralized government of Europe. 
In France, for instance, the faculties established by Napoleon the First in 1808 
were primarily examining and degree conferring bodies, suchas is the University of 
London at the present day. These faculties (law, medicine, theology, letters, and 
sciences) constituted the higher education department of the University of France, 
and only by the faculties of which this department is composed can academic 
degrees be conferred. To enter one of the faculties it is necessary to have obtained 
the lowest degree conferred by the faculty of letters, that of bachelor, which may 
be compared, as to kind but not as to quality, to the admission examination held by 
our colleges. But the point to be marked is that the professors composing these 
faculties are employés of the state—paid by the state, promoted by the state, trans- 
ferred by the state, and pensioned by the state. Thus it appears that in France the 
state has never relinquished its right to say what knowledge and experience should 
be possessed by the candidates for the professions of law and medicine, and of late 
has added to these the profession of teaching, though that in its elementary grades 
is regulated by the state department of elementary instruction, which with the 
department of secondary and higher education, form the University of France. 
In Germany, on the other hand, the degree conferred by the faculties of medicine 
and law is merely an academic distinction such as is our M. A., and confers no right 
to-practicein the case of medicine, or of appointment to public judicial positions in 
the case of law, that right being granted by a board of examiners appointed by the 
state; for law and medicine in Germany are taught only in universities, and these 
institutions still retain their corporate existence, though the state maintains a plen- 
ipotentiary, bearing the title of curator, within the walls of each. On ‘the other 
hand, graduation from a school for training teachers is equivalent to being licensed; 
for the curriculum of the school, its administration, and its teachers have all been 
fixed or appointed by the state. . 
The following table shows how differently these matters are conducted in America. 
It would seem that of all the States Massachusetts alone has never delegated to 
a corporation, not even to her own normal schools (in the case of teachers), the 
right, in substance, to license her physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers, or 
teachers. Other States are equally consistent in conferring that right, while others 
still are not so consistent, retaining within their own hands the right of examinin 
pharmacists and lawyers, but not physicians. Indeed, there seems to be considera- 
ble apprehension that the pharmacists will improperly compound the drugs prescribed 
by the physician, an apprehension, however, which does not seem to be present as 
far as concerns the writer of the prescription. 3

Leaving aside the material value of the diploma or degree as a license to prac- 
tice, or tantamount tosuch, wemay inquire whether the schools of theology in the 
United States are: empowered by the State to grant degrees, or, to put the question 
more properly, whether the schools have very generally sought to obtain that privi- 
lege from the State. Of a list of 141 theological institutions reporting in 1889, 80 
answer the question, “ Are you authorized by law to confer degrees?” Of these 45 
answer in the affirmative and 35 in the negative.

ENDOWED ‘CHAIRS IN PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
It has been asserted both in Europe and here in America that fierce competition in 
the business of teaching will not produce the higher kind of instruction called for 
in the intelligent practice of the learned professions, When ‘the State hires the 
teaching corps and is administered by patriotic persons who prefer men of character 
and understanding to such as have political friends, the evils of competition and 
the attendant evils. of an undue number of schools and of inadequate instruction 
are minimized. But even in a country in which professional education is a business 
matter.a remedy may be sought in endowment of chairs. A glance at the following
-P-A-G-E-219
  PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 867 
table will show how poorly the American schools of medicine and law are equipped 
in this way. -As far as reported to the Bureau there is not in these two'professions 
an endowed chair south or west of Philadelphia. Theology has been better cared 
ee er only in the Eastern States, but also in the West and to some extent in the 
outh, 
Of the five endowed professorships that have been established in law schools four 
belong to Harvard University. These are the Royall, the Dane, the Bussey, and the 
Story “chairs, the first two of which were established at a very early date in tho 
history of this country, thongh it was not until 1829 that the Royall professorship 
became an integral part of the law department of the university. 
In speaking of endowed professorships in the United States a reservation has to 
be made. A chair may be endowed in a university or in one of its departments, but 
a chair may also be endowed, less specifically it 4s true, by endowing the university or 
one of its departments. The university has the income to allot and every chair that 
receives regularly an allotment may be looked upon as endowed. Itis impossible to 
enter into an intricate analysis of endowments of this kind at the present writing 
A subsequent publication of this Bureau, however, will deal with the whole, question 
of endowment: of institutions of learning from a financial standpoint, which ap- 
parently isthe proper method of approaching the subject.

SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS, 
The terms scholarship and fellowship, so commonly met with in connection with 
the discussion of college and university affairs, “came from the English univ ee 4 
Ina semiofiicial publication of the University of Oxford a ‘“ college fellowship” i 
defined as “an eleemosynary institution which constitutes its holder a member for 
the time being of an intra-academical corporation, with a voice in its government 
and aclaim upon its revenues.” And further, these fellowships ‘‘ were established 
for the promotion of religion and learning, and the original intention has been so far 
respected by subsequent t usage that literary or scientific merit is still the basis of 
election; but a fellow once clected is at liberty to follow his own pursuits, whether 
they be literary or otherwise.” ‘A scholarship,” continues the same authority, “is 
an institution which constitutes its holder a member of an intra-academical corpora- 
tion, without a voice in its government, but with a claim to instruction, to rooms, 
and to an allowance for maintenance.” Beyond the difference between the fellow 
and the scholar, that one is an administrator and the other is not, a further differ- 
ence is apparent, that the scholar is still obliged to follow the curriculum of the 
school and the fellow has gone beyond it, and, in a measure at least, is left to his 
own predilections.

Just in what sense the term scholarship was taken by the several professional 
schools of the United States, when asked, in 1889, as to the number of scholarships 
existing in those schools, can not be stated, as distinctions of English origin lose 
their specific English significance in America.

It is much to be feared, however, that the school authorities who have favored the 
Bureau with answers to the question it asked of them have, in many cases, thor- 
oughly misunderstood the word “scholarship.” The answers received, especially in 
the cases of medicine and law, have led to the belief that prizes in "the shape of 
< current coin or of medals, or of professional books or instruments, have been denom- 
inated scholarships. This belief, however, does not include the case of Harvard Uni- 
versity, where the faculty have ‘established four scholarships of $200 each, in addi- 
tion to the two Barringer scholarships, respectively of $300 and $200, and the Cheever

  PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 869 
The 88 bachelors of (‘natural ”] philosophy of the table are students of one of the 
three courses of the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. - These three 
courses are, chemistry, civilengineering, and medical biology. It may therefore be 
safe to assume that the great majority “of the 88 degrees conferred on the students 
of the Sheflield school were for work accomplished in “ science,” or ‘ civil engineer- 
ing.” Taking this assumption as a fact,it is very evident ‘that the favorite or 
ustal degree ‘conferred by our technological schools is bachelor of science and next 
after it, though at a wide interval, comes the degree of civil engineering. 
The degree of mechanical engineer is also well represented, both in the land grant 
and other technological institutions, and if to the number ef degrees granted in 
mechanical engineering be added those conferred in the comparatively new degree 
of electrical engineering, it is probable that they would, when so combined, surpass 
in number the civil engineering degrees, even though each kind of degree be given 
its quota, now hidden in the indistinctive degree of ‘bachelor of science.” 
The degrees of bachelor of arts and of literature would seem to be out of place in 
a table appearing in a section of the report containing the statistics of technological 
institutions. However, ten institutions report that they granted this degree in 
1890-91; and had all the institutions endowed with the national land grant reported 
in the blanks for technological schools the number of such degrees here given would 
have been largely augmented. = 
The usual degrees granted to women students are bachelor of science. or bachelor 
of literature.

STATE AID. 
The only professional justitutions that the States of the Union support to any 
noteworthy extent are the schools for training teachers and the quasi-technical 
schools endowed with the national land grants of 1862 and 1890 and several mining 
schools not in that category. Law, medical, and theological schools have been left 
to their own devices, but while the several States have contributed to the support 
of schools already heavily endowed by national grants, the piety of individuals has 
made theology the best endowed study in, the land. 
There can be no doubt of the propriety of private philanthropy endowing theolog- 
ical study or of the State’s enterprise in supporting technical and pedagogical 
instruction, but itis difficult to discover why such consummately practical and impor- 
tant topics as law and medicine should be neglected by private benevolence or public 
caution. It seems to be conceded that unendowed instruction in law or medicine 
will be just as poorly given as unendowed instruction in theology ®r pedagogy. Yet 
we find instructors in both these sciences, thought to be necessarily state-supported 
on the continent of Europe, in America left to live upon the meager diet of tuition fees.

a Through the courtesy of Principal Cooper, ot the State Normal School at Eilinboro, the Bureau is informed that ‘‘ during the year 1890-91 the State paid $90,000 to its 12 normal schools. Part of this ~ 
went to help students in certain studios and the restto graduates. In the Edinboro school $4,300.was paid to graduates and $6,286 to those pursuing certain studies. This expenditure by the State helped the students and, indirectly, the school.” 
VI. 
BENEFACTIONS. 
The gifts to institutions for professional instruction for 1890~91 have been rather 
one-sided. Of a total of $1,466,399, 63 per cent was given to theological schools, 
medicine following with 17 per cent, technology with 14 per cent, and law with 
nearly 1 per cent. The rest was received by schools for the training of teachers, 
though more than half of the amount received by those schools went to one institu- 
tion—a ‘normal and industrial” school for colored youth. ‘To nurse-training 
schools $27,221 were given, of which $25,000 was received by one institution. The 
amount given to nurse-training schools, however, has not been included in the grand 
total. 
Vii. 
= STATISTICS OF PERSONNEL AND ATTENDANCE. 
In conformity with the intention stated in Chapter x1 of the Report preeeding 
this, the summaries that follow exhibit the statistical facts of primary importance 
in connection with the States in which the institutions reporting the facts are located. These facts are the number of schools, the number of instructors in them, 
and the number of students instructed within their walls during the period under review, and the graduates from them. 
Taking the medical table as one whole, there is an increase of nearly 2,000 in the 
number enrolled over the figures reported for 1889~90, and of 500 in graduates. 
Analysis of the table shows that 1,000, or 53 per cent, of this increase in enrollment 
was contributed by the schools for the class of medical practitioners called regular; 
61, or 3 per cent, by the eclectics; 54, or 3 per cent, by the homeopathists, and 3 indi- 
viduals by the physio-medical practitioners. The graduate schools as reported for 
each of the two years show an increase of nearly 400, the schools of dentistry an 
increase of 320, or nearly 17 per cent, and the schools of pharmacy an increase of 13. 
The schools of veterinary medicine increased their enrollment by 50, or nearly 3 per 
     
-P-A-G-E-224
872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
cent of the whole increase of 2,000, and the enrollment at nurse-training schools 
increased by 61, or 3 per cent. 
If we take the table by geographical divisions we find that 22 per cent of the in- 
crease is in schools of the North Atlantic Division, 19 per cent in those of the South 
Atlantic, 13 per cent in those of the South Central, 40 per cent in those of the North 
Central, and 6 per cent in those of the Western. 
In canvassing the same facts for theology as has just been done for medicine, an 
increase of 315 in enrollment appears, and a slight decrease in the number of gradu- 
ates. Of the increase in enrollment 65 per centis in the South Atlantic Division and 
is mainly attributable to the presence of a school that had not reported for 1889-90, 
In other words the attendance on theological schools has increased but slightly. 
Turning now to law, an increase of 734 in enrollment is shown, and of 303 in the num- 
ber of graduates. Of this increase 75 per cent occurs north of Mason and Dixon’s 
line and the Ohio and is equally divided between the North Atlantic and North Cen-> 
tral States. Twenty per cent of the increase occurs in the South Atlantic States, 
leaving not quite 5 per cent for the States of the Southwest, of the Rocky Mountain re- 
gion, and of the Pacific slope. It is at once apparent how the States of the Upper 
Mississippi Valley are forging ahead in the matter of medical and legal education, 
at least as far as numbers are concerned. * 
Now before alluding to the two remaining classes of professional schools, that is to 
say, technological and pedagogical schools, it is advisable to consider a feature of 
the schools for instruction in theso-called learned professions which will perhaps for 
many years serve to distinguish them from the other professional schools. This fea- 
ture is that everywhere except in America, and even there theoretically, they are 
university or, in American phraseology, post-graduate schools of study. The univer- 
sity on the continent of Europe presupposes a very thorough training in Latin and 
Greek. It will thus be seen that the last two columns of Table 3 are interesting 
only to those who believe that a thorough drill in the literature and language of the 
Greeks and Romans, or in science with or without Latin, is a necessary preliminary 
to reading law, medicine, or theology. By such, however, it must be remembered: 
that though many schools answer the Bureau’s question candidly by giving either 
the number among the matriculates who have had a liberal education, as shown by 
the possession of a degree in letters or science, or by writing plainly the word 
“none” or figure “0,” asrequested, some persist in ignoring the question or in answer- 
ing it with a dash or a ‘‘don’t know.” Thus it happens that 43 per cent of the stu- 
dents in schools for making physicians are not represented in the last column of the 
summary on p. 873, 28 per cent of the students in schools of theology du not ap- 
pear in the last column of the summary on p. 877, and 23 per cent of the schools 
of law are omitted in the final column of the summary on p. 878. Under these 
conditions comparison with preceding years is a work replete with misleading state- 
ments unless a system of comp customs be inaugurated for the nonreporting schools. 
Indeed, for medicine, nearly half of whose schools do not report, itis hardly per- 
missible even then to make such comparisons. 
In regular medical schools 15 per cent of the number of students had obtained a 
degree in letters or science in schools returning an intelligible answer to the Bu- 
reau’s question as to liberally educated men; in eclectic schools, 17 per cent; in homeo- 
pathic schools, 9 per cent; in physio-medical schools, none. Considering the regular 
schools alone, which schools contain over 80 per cent of the attendance at medical 
schools, it is found that in the States of the Atlantic slope 18 per cent of the 
students in schools reporting intelligibly, have a degree in letters or science; 
in the States of the Mississippi Valley and the Gulf, 12 per cent; and in the Rocky 
Mountain region and on the Pacific slope 10 per cent. The proportion of students 
represented on the last column of the summary (Table 3) varies; in the North Atlan- 
tic it is 71 per cent; in the South Atlantic it is 53 per cent; th the South Central it 
is 59 per cent; in the North Central 62 per cent; and in the Western it is 93 per cent. 
Canvassing the same facts for schools of theology an improvement is shown as 
compared with the statistics of schools of medicine; for 39 per cent of the studentsin 
theological schools which answer the question as to liberally educated men intelligibly 
had received a degree in letters or science. The proportion of the whole attendance 
at theological schools that appears in the final column of the summary (Table 4) 
varies much. Thus in the North Atlantic Division 80 per cent is accounted for; in 
the South Atlantic 59 per cent; inthe South Central 68 per cent; in the North 
Central 70 per cent; and in the Western 80 per cent. But greatly as the schools of 
the sections vary in the matter of reporting, still more do they vary in the number 
haying a liberal education, for the proportion is 56in every 100 in the North Atlantic, 
16 in the South Atlantic, 25 in the South Central, and 32 in the North Central 
Division. 
Finally, let us turn tolaw schools. In those that answer the question as to lib- 
erally educated men intelligibly, itis found that 23 per cent. had obtaineda degree in 
letters orscience. With the exception of the Southern States, particularly of those of      
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  a 
PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 873 
the South Atlantic, the reports are very fullin the final column of the summary (Table 
5), ranging from 87 to 95 of the whole attendance reported. It isnoticeable, however, 
that the proportion of liberally educated men is much the largest in the North 
Atlantic States, in whose schools, as far as reported intelligibly, 38in every hundred 
students had a degree in letters or science. In the North Central Division the pro- 
portion is 13 in every hundred, and in the other sections it ranges from 15 to 17 in 
the hundred. 
The statistics of the schools of noncollegiate grade for training teachers show an 
increase in attendance in the professional departments of nearly 5,000, and of about 
600 in graduates. Of the increase in students 97 per cent is due to the increase in 
the number of young women in attendance, they constituting about 70 per cent of 
the whole enrollment, which seems to be about the normal percentage. In the non- 
professional departments of these schools there were 5,968 students. 
In this chapter only those manual training schools are eonsidered which do not 
belong to a system of public schools. They are so few in number that it is con- 
venient to bring them in here rather than to let them take their place in the detailed 
tables in Part m1 of this Report.

  CHAPTER XXIV. 
EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 
By Rev. A. D. Mayo, M. A 
In the year 1734, Orange County of the colony of Virginia in theory 
included the whole of the present United States of America west of the 
Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1738 the new counties of Augusta and 
Frederick covered the vast area of the present States of West Virginia, 
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the major part of what 
isnow the New Dominion. In 1763, by treaty with France, Virginia was 
reduced to the territory east of the Mississippi River and north of the 
present boundary of Tennessee. Later, in the early days of the new 
Republic, the release of her ancient claim upon the original Northwest 
eurtailed her boundary to the still noble dimensions of the common- 
wealth of 1860. The secession of “ the Mother of Presidents” from the 
Union her great statesmen had done so much to create, in 1861, was 
the signal for an important section of her own territory to follow her 
example, and the present State of West Virginia is now a prosperous 
and worthy member of the splendid group of seven northwestern com- 
monwealths between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi. The Vir- 
ginia of to-day consists of the one hundred counties. between the sea 
and the high mountain ranges which divide its southwestern realm from 
West Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. What may be called 
southwestern Virginia, for the purpose of this essay, with no attempt 
at strict accuracy in the division, is contained in the twenty-five 
counties between the city of Roanoke and the western border of the 
State. The names of these counties are Roanoke, Craig, Alleghany, 
Bath, Highland, Giles, Bland, Buchanan, Dickinson, Wise, Lee, Scott, 
Russell, Washington, Tazewell, Smyth, Grayson, Wythe, Pulaski, Mont- 
gomery, Floyd, Carroll, Patrick, Henry, Franklin. \ 
In the year 1865, at the close of the great civil conflict, the Old 
Dominion, east of Augusta County, presented one of the most melan- 
choly specimens of the ruin wrought by war in modern times. For 
four years it had been the most desperate battle ground for the 
preservation of the Union, As the mighty struggle neared its conclu- 
sion the grand armies of the Republic and the Confederacy, led by 
their most eminent commanders, all turned their faces toward east 
Virginia. Here was seen the closing act of the drama, in the fall of 
the Confederate capital and the surrender of the army that from the 
first had been the most stubborn and successful defender of “the lost 
cause.” Through the entire realm between the Alleghany Mountains 
and the sea, old Virginia had been ravaged by the surging to and fro 
of the contending hosts of the rival powers, battling for the State of 
Washington and Jefierson. Almost every square mile had its woeful

- record of bloody encounter. Its cities were in ruins, its plantations 
ravaged, and its whole industrial order overthrown. So complete was 
the destruction that entire regions of this older part of the State, after 
twenty-five years, are only beginning to recuperate. Indeed, important 
sections of the Virginia of the Revolution are now virtually abandoned 
territory, biding the time of the heroic investment of capital and labor 
necessary for reclaiming lands hallowed by the most sacred historical 
memories of the olden days. 
In the year 1861, at the opening of the war, Virginia, east of the 
Alleghany range, led the entire fifteen States of the South in the ar- 
rangements for the secondary and higher education. The State Uni- 
versity, founded by Jefferson in 1820, in Albemarle County, had the 
undisputed leadership of the colleges in all the Southern and Southwest- 
ern States. Randolph-Macon, Hampden-Sidney, William and Mary, 
still existing, and Washington College, at Lexington, were known and 
held in high esteem. In the southwest, Emory and Henry, nestling in 
its lovely valley, gathered a large body of students from many distant 
States. Hollins Institute, in Botetourt County, was the best-known 
and probably the most effective seminary for girls in the South, draw- 
ing large numbers of her students from distant communities. The 
original plan of Thomas Jefferson for a college in every county, tribu- 
tary to the State University, had never been realized; but a good num- 
ber of academical foundations, organized on the plan of the famous 
public schools of England, made a strong point of the classics and 
mathematics and held up the standard of old-time liberal culture. 
The superior graduates of these institutions became the leading presi- 
dents and professors of the collegiate and academical establishments 
through the South, especially in the Southwest; even contributing lib- 
erally to the same class of teachers in the States north of the Ohio. 
There was a good deal of vigorous private and family schooling and 
tutoring among the wealthy families, and a habit of sending to the best 
Northern and European schools. The one weak point was the erudeand 
meager arrangements for the common schooling of the masses of white 
people, even in this portion of the State a numerous class, and in the 
western country beyond the range of slave cultivation including a 
large proportion of the entire population. There are no reliable statis- 
ties of popular education in Virginia during these 250 years, but enough 
is known to make painfully evident the neglect of this, the only dura- 
ble foundation on which to build a republican State. 
A few of these leading schools held on in a half-hearted way during 
the stormy years of the war. Among them was Hollins Institute, the 
foremost institute for girls. It is a striking indication of the confi- 
dence of even the leading educational men of the State in the ultimate 
successof the cause, that at the lastcommencement season of this institu- 
tion before the fall of Richmond, while Grant was closing in on Peters- 
burg and Sherman fighting his way to Atlanta, the management of 
this institution responded to the ablest plea for the normal training of 
teachers ever made in the South by Prof. Edward Joynes, and voted 
to reorganize this academy as a normal school for the instruction of 
the young women who would be called to serve in the new educational 
system of the Confederacy. The majority of the older seats oflearning 
were suspended during this year, many of their buildings destroyed 
or greatly injured by use for hospital and other military purposes. The 
State owes to Gen. Philip Sheridan the preservation of the quaint 
buildings of the university, at Charlottesville, and, after wunaccounta- 
ble delays, the Congress of the United States has at last reimbursed

William and Mary College for the unauthorized burning of its build- 
ings in the peninsular campaign. 
In southwestern Virginia the material ruin of the war was less evi- 
dent. There had been comparatively little serious fighting in the re- 
gion below Lynchburg, save where an occasional raid had left.a black 
and blasted tract in its wake. Outside of the valleys where the chief © 
slave population was concentrated, there had been ho especial loss 
from occupation. The people of these highland counties were mostly 
independent farmers, and, notwithstanding the fearful drain of the con- 
scription for the army, were left with a country not seriously injured 
by overeulture in the past. But the educational destruction was even 
greater in this portion of the State. Outside a few collegiate and 
academical schools, attended by a small percentage of the school popu- 
lation, there had never been any well organized or efficient system of 
popular instruction on the ground. The majority of even the better-off 
families were now unable ‘to resume their old-time habit of sending 
their children from home to distant schools. A feeble attempt to re: 
establish the ‘“ Old Field” system of subscription schools, taught by 
itinerant masters, often under conditions that would dampen the zeal 
of the most ambitious student, seems to be all that-was done for sev- 
eral years. Meanwhile illiteracy was on the increase among the humbler 
classes of white people and the colored folk were compelled to depend 
largely upon the missionary zeal of teachers sent from the various 
churches and educational societies of the North for the inauguration 
of their educational life. : 
He would have been regarded a visionary indeed who in this dis- 
mal emergency should have prophesied that on the sacred soil of the 
Old Dominion, memorable as the home of great men, within a brief 
generation, not yet thirty years from the surrender at Appomattox, 
would have been revealed what we now behold; for, spite of this 
destruction in the older part of the State, the revival of material pros- 
perity has justified the prophecy of Washington in a marvelous degree. 
The Virginia of 1892 is steadily being renewed in all that makes an 
American State powerful and prosperous, and nowhere is this progress 
more evident than in the region left to itin the deprivation of the great 
undeveloped territory now its neighboring State of West Virginia. In 
its depression, almost its despair, the ancient Commonwealth has | 
“lifted its éyes unto the hills” of its new southwest, and thence “cometh 
its help.” 
The eye of the Father of his Country was always on this great south- 
west in the darkest hour of the Revolution. Into that mysterious wil- 
derness he would retreat, if worst came to worst, and prolong the 
battle for the freedom of the colonies through indefinite years. And 
when the good fight was won he still looked westward in prophetic 
consideration of the swarming myriads that should people the Jands 
toward the sunset. He was always saying, ‘““We must bind these peo- 
ple of the new West to us by bands of steel.” His favorite idea of a 
canal from the seaboard to the valley of the Ohio antedated the more 
practical scheme of De Witt Clinton by a generation. In his Will 
he left stock in these projected waterways to found a national uni- 
versity at Washington, in which the favored male youth of the several 
States should be educated together by American teachers into a pha-_ 
lanx of patriotic leaders of the new American citizenship. His especial 
plan failed of accomplishment, but the ways of water and steel now 
bind the shore of the Atlantic to the mighty West. The University 
of Virginia was the real mother of the system of State universities

that now has the leadership in the education of every State beyond the 
old Augusta County line, while the city of Washington has already 
become a national university whose opportunities for a broad and patri- 
otic culture surpass even the dream of the great first President of the 
Republic. 
On every side the traveler now sees the evidence of the advancing 
material prosperity and power of the new Dominion of Virginia. 
Within the past twenty-five years two great lines of railroad have 
spanned the 500 miles between the sea and the Ohio Valley, while two 
systems of almost equal importance bind it to the South and South- 
west, and the Baltimore and Ohio, the great highland railroad of the 
civil war, is still expanding its facilities. Hampton Roads is rapidly 
becoming the Atlantic harbor that one marvels it has not been from 
the beginning. At the mouth of the James River is springing up a 
new city, the rival of busy Norfolk, across its broad and beautiful bay. 
Richmond is becoming a notable center of the manufacturing industry 
she resisted for years in the interest of a narrow industrial and polit- 
ical theory. Southside Virginia is being wrought up into vast garden, 
orchard, and tobacco plantations, with old villages rising into new 
cities. Alexandria is bestirring herself to revive her ancient days of 
commercial importance, and can hardly fail to be an important manu- 
facturing annex of the United States capital. The Potomac is already 
regarded as one of the two noblest pleasure waterways in the eastern 
section of the Union, only rivaled by the Hudson. The quiet valley 
of the Shenandoah has not only surpassed its old-time agricultural 
fame, but is now making loud proclamation of new mining and manu- 
factures more startling than the stories of its natural bridge, caverns, 
and mountain wonders in the geographies of our youth. 
But the people of Virginia are rapidly learning that the new and 
exciting hope of a material prosperity, impossible under its ancient 
régime, is burdened with its new perils and solemnized by a call for the 
noblest effort of a Christian civilization. To the average politician, 
ensnared in the toils of the little expediencies of to-day; to the social 
philosopher, who leaves out the common humawity of man; to the lit- 
terateur, looking backward for inspiration into a state of society abnor- 
mal at its best and impossible to be recalled to-day, the race problem, as 
the relation between the white and colored people of the South is called, 
isafearful portent. Butthe very friction of the attempt to force a reac- 
tionary policy on these expanding States of the South will compel the 
Christian civilization of the present to assert itself and boldly declare 
that the only outlet for this peril is through the broad highway of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. The moment any man, however noble by nature 
or exalted by pedigree, bends down to his weaker brother to recognize 
the image of the Creator and aid in the uplift to his own highest possi- 
bilities, all danger of race conflict disappears in the new revelation of 
the divine and human love that makes of one family all God’s creatures 
on earth and in heaven. It is already seen and realized by a great and 
increasing body of the Southern people that, so far from a cause of 
discouragement, the present social situation is the call of God to the 
greatest moral achievement of the century, that is, the inauguration of 
a vast missionary movement for the education of all its less-favored 
classes in that training of the hand, the heart, and the head which is 
the making of a true American citizenship no less than the realization 
of the brotherhood of man in the Church of Christ. : 
While the mighty North is wrestling with her prodigious effort to 
change the thronging millions of the humbler sort of European. immi-

grants to a safe, helpful, and patriotic American people, the South is 
awakening to her own corresponding obligation to lift up, not the new- 
comers from foreign lands, but her own people of both races, who from 
the first have been at once the source of all her prosperity and in lat- 
ter days the occasion of allher woes. And if this view of the situation 
seems fanciful and impracticable, or runs against the theory or practice 
of any set of secular or sacred men, we can safely appeal to the future 
and the providence of God, nowhere displayed in more affecting and - 
inspiring ways than during the past twenty-five years of our American 
history, so crowded with warning, instruction, and inspiration to “all 
orders and conditions of men.” ; 
To the thoughtful observer of American affairs the educational prog- 
ress of the sixteen ex-slave-holding, originally known as the Southern 
States, during the past twenty-five years, is one of the chief marvels of 
our marvelous national life. Indeed, this great movement along the 
whole line of educational advancement has practically been made in the 
twenty years since 1870, and is, by all odds, the most interesting and 
significant feature of the complex industrial, political, and social evo- 
lution we call the New South. We have already referred to the start- 
ling manner in which the prophetic common sense of Washington has 
been more than verified in the new outburst of Southern industries and 
the push for the development of the vast resources of the Southern 
States within the past fifteen years. Less evident to the superficial 
observer, but far more radical in its quiet and irresistible influence since 
1870, has been the educational renaissance which reads like a chapter 
of the prophecy according to Thomas Jefferson, fulfilled almost to the 
letter, with even greater enlargement of the spirit than even that great 
man foresaw. 
To few men has been given the combination of creative genius and 
executive capacity that makes the ideal statesman. We believe that 
history will award the crown of practical, sound, conservative Amer- 
ican statesmanship to the group of great men that looked for lead- 
ership to Washington, the most unselfish, successful, and sensible leader 
of men in modern times, with Marshall, Madison, and others of like. 
broad, calm, and moderate spirit as his fit associates. But just as 
surely does it appear that in fruitful theories of republican society, 
in deep speculation concerning the ultimate foundations of just gov- 
ernment, especially in the fertility of expedient and breadth of concep- - 
tion concerning the fit training of the people of thirteen rival colonies 
and their probable new elements of population from abroad for the 
highest position on earth, a competent American citizenship, Thomas 
Jefferson of all his countrymen stands supreme. 
Nothing so reveals the superficial estimate of vital forces by the 
average partisan political leaders of the day asthe fact that this crown- 
ing element of his fame should be so persistently overlooked. Within 
the past five years a notable eulogy on the life and character of Jeffer- 
son was pronounced before a State university by a distinguished pub- 
lic man, with no especial mention of this his most prominent claim to 
the gratitude of his countrymen and the most precious heritage to his 
own Commonwealth. It may not be amiss to recapitulate the elements 
of this system of schooling for the youth of the Old Dominion, elabo- 
rated by Thomas Jefferson even before the foundation of the Union, 
and persisted in with an intelligent obstinacy, increasing with years, 
until the closing days of his life. 
(1) Foremost, as the basis of the whole structure, was the great eru- 
sade in behalf of religious liberty which rescued Virginia from an
-P-A-G-E-238
  886 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
ecclesiastical bondage more galling and far less respectable and moral 
than the corresponding Puritan rule of the first thirty years of the 
New England colonial life. The more closely we look at the actual 
state of colonial affairs, the more evident it seems that the new Govern- 
ment of the United States owed its most radical and essential feature, 
a complete separation of church and state, more to the wisdom of a 
small group of far-seeing statesmen than to any settled conviction in 
the popular mind. To Washington, Marshall, Franklin, Adams, and 
Jefferson, and in his better days somewhat to the agitation of Thomas 
Paine, was it given to quietly place in the very heart of the new re- 
public the assertion of an absolute religious liberty of thought and 
action, only limited by the moral law as incorporated in the Constitu- 
tion and legislation of the modern civilized state. The leadership in 
the first great battle against ecclesiastical authority in the South was 
given to Jefferson. It was clear as light to him that, without this as 
the chief corner stone, not only would republican institutions be im- 
possible, but all education for American citizenship would be poisoned 
at the fountain by the most desperate virus of sectarian bigotry and 
ecclesiastical despotism. All these men were deeply religious, although 
no one of them was a notable churchman in the popular sense. Their 
work was accomplished against the bitter opposition of a majority of 
the clergy, which found expression in a proclamation of Jefierson as 
the arch apostle of infidelity. But,ouce achieved, this act so com- 
-mended itself to the common religious sense of the leading laity of all 
sections that it has seldom been questioned in theory. 
(2) Next in importance in scheme of Jefferson was the emancipation 
of the slaves and their training by industrial education for what then 
appeared the most practicable way of disposing of this already danger- 
ous element of Southern population. This plan is distinctly outlined 
in the original scheme of Jefferson for the new educational organiza- 
tion of Virginia, and, had it been accepted, would have become the 
fashion of the day and saved the Republic of 1860 from the terrible 
conflict for the independence of the South. It was not remarkable that 
Jefferson shared in what was the almost universal moral repugnance to, 
and the deep conviction of the political inconsistency and social peril of 
such an institution as American negro slavery; but that he should have 
reached out and seized, as by instinct, on the idea of preparation, 
through industrial training, for the new life of the freedman, whether 
at home or in Africa, declares him foremost among the educational 
theorists of his age. He would see to-day his fundamental idea real- 
ized on a broader. scale at Hampton, in sight of the landing-place of 
the first Dutch slaver, “built in the eclipse and rigged with curses 
dark,” that smote with its fatal prow the sands of old Virginia. In the 
light of the opinions and feelings of Christendom at that day concern- 
ing the morale of slavery and the status of the Negro, probably stated 
with accuracy in the memorable sentence of the decision of Chief Jus- 
tice Taney in the Dred Scott ease, illustrated by the persistent effort 
of the British Government to force African slavery on the American 
colonies, this enlightened and benevolent plan of Jefferson for the 
peaceful emancipation and preparation of the negro race for useful- 
ness is a striking proof of a statesmanship only too ideal for that early 
day. 
(3) Next came the first clear and influential statement of the right of 
the common white people of the South to elementary schooling at the 
expense of the State, under the supervision of the Government, in Jef: 
ferson’s proposition for a system of cemmon schools. The hand-to- 
 
-P-A-G-E-239

mouth expedient of the “Old Field school,” a private subseription 
arrangement, dependent entirely on the teacher and the whim of his 
patrons, possibly good but almost universally poor, was already seen 
to be a failure as a method for the permanent education of the majority 
of white youth. The proposition to limit the period of free schuvling 
to three years and the small care for girls in the arrangement were 
concessions to the obstinate unbelief in any system of free public educa- 
tion among the influential classes of the people, backed by the universal 
prejudice of the clergy in favor of clerical supervision of all training of 
childhood and youth outside the family; itself, in this respect, little 
better than anannex to the church. One feature of the plan not fully 
appreciated was the appointment of teachers from worthy veterans of 
the Revolutionary army during good behavior and their establishment 
in a permanent home as a perquisite of the position, an arrangement 
that would have given to the teaching profession a standing of respect- 
ability and permanency it has not yet attained in the most favored sec- 
tions of the Union. Atthe same time Joseph Cabell, the Fidus Achates 
of Jefferson in all his educational schemes, returned from Europe full 
of the new method of instruction associated with the name of Pesta- 
lozzi. Had the scheme carried and been established in good faith the 
teachers of New England and the Northwest might have been throng- 
ing the normal schools and summer institutes of Virginia to-day for the 
latest methods and devices in the organization, discipline, and teaching 
of the common school. 
(4) The next step upward was the conception of Jefferson respecting 
the secondary education, as far as concerned its establishment and. 
supervision by the State. The germ of the idea included the modern 
American high school. In form it corresponded with what was then’ 
the universal conception of an academical training—the drill in the 
classics and mathematics as sufficient for a university and professional 
career, and the schooling essential to a gentleman. He proposed a 
system of colleges so numerous that every man in the State could reach 
one at the end of a day’s journey, where the sons of the better-off class 
could be instructed in the learning and manners essential to their sta- 
tion. But the plan included a provision for the free tuition of a few 
scholars in each county, elected by competitive examination from the 
common schools, thus reaching down a hand to lift up the more promis- 
inig boys of the humbler class to companionship in privilege with their 
social superiors. Here the war was declared, fierce and persistent, by 
the clergy and the regulation planter of the day. Already had the 
prominent Christian bodies monopolized the higher education, even 
William and Mary being really a Church of England seminary, and 
the majority of the academies already established were regarded as 
feeders and missionary centers of the rival sects. On the other hand, 
the exclusive family idea of the time was outraged by a proposition to 
mix the offspring of even the different grades of upper-caste folk in 
schools removed from the home inspection and supervised by the State. 
No man realized better than Thomas Jefferson the essential antagonism 
of the family notion of exclusive education by tutors and governesses, 
virtually in an apartment of the home, without the independence of the 
teacher even in methods of instruction, and its inevitable enslavement 
to the habits and whims of a plantation household, to any genuine ideal 
of republican institutions. His voluminous writings on education are 
full of the clear perception of the right and duty of the whole people, 
represented in a republican state, to a vital codperation in the mental 
and moral training of children and youth for republican citizenship, 
   
-P-A-G-E-240
  888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Otherwise the material of citizenship is always at the mercy of the 
church, and the church a clerical preserve. He asserted that, not 
only by a negative method of a legislation based on the highest con- 
ception of the moral law possible at any. given period, and the protec- 
tive method of state guardianship of the child as a defense against 
. parental incapacity and vice and clerical persecution of heresy with all 
the agencies in possession of the clerical class, but also in the common, 
collegiate, and secondary state school, the moral right arm of the 
American commonwealth, was lodged this power and obligation. We 
are not yet out of the persistent war against this, the American idea 
of the training of American youth for American life. And no man of 
the earlier time so clearly anticipated this conflict, or so wisely pro- 
vided against the peril of social and sectarian interference with the 
liberty of becoming a full American citizen, as this great and farseeing 
statesman of education. 
5. Thus obstructed and worried even to the verge of desperation by 
the steady resistance of the old-time family and clerical ideas of educa- 
tion, there is no wonder that Jefferson, at the end of a good fight of 
thirty years, in his old age, worn out by the cares of public office and 
the embarrassment of his own private affairs, was happy even to save 
the upper story of his great temple for the training of his beloved Virginia. 
It was indeed like the spire of a cathedral, poised in the air high above 
the earth, with no building underneath, propped by such stays and sup- 
ports as the unorganized school scheme of private and church institu- 
tions could afford. As conceived in the imagination of its creator, the 
new University of Virginia was the broadest and most democratic ar- 
rangement for the higher education that had appeared on the new con- 
tinent. It had broken loose from the ecclesiastical control that still held 
all American collegesin bonds. It had inaugurated the elective system 
of study, which is now the accepted method of all leading colleges and 
universities in the country. As conceived.in the mind of the sage, in 
his study over at Monticello, the idea of a community of young gentle- 
men, put upon their sense of personal responsibility and honor for good 
behavior, was a new departure that struck down below the roots of the 
prevailing notions of the discipline of youth for the obligations and 
perils of life. His curriculum was almost the rival of Milton’s noble 
conception of the education fit for an English gentleman, and included 
not only military tactics, but the industrial drill now coming to the 
front in the most progressive institutions of learning. 
So great were these and other lesser merits that, with all the draw- 
backs of its actual organization, the University of Virginia has been 
one of the most influential of American seats of learning, setting the 
pitch for the entire organization of the higher education in every State 
south of Virginia, and repeating itself, with the additions of Jeferson’s 
entire scheme, in the State universities of every Northwestern and 
Pacific Commonwealth. Of course, under the conditions, it could not 
fail to become a university of the dominant class, and, with the grow- 
ing tendency of that leading aristocracy, a citadel of the political and 
social ideas that drove the South into revolt from the Natioual Govern- 
ment and wrought the dismemberment of the Old Dominion herself. 
But it has graduated a noble company of eminent men. Its standard 
of scholarship has been high, exacting severe labor from all who claim 
its diploma. Ithassentfortha great crowd of accomplished teachers to 
thesecondary and higher schoolsof the Southwest, and largely modified 
the collegiatelife of the older Northwest and, today, perhaps, no other edu- 
cational institution in these sixteen States has a better outlook for a new

life along the lines of the new university departure. If the favorite 
notion of Dr. Ruffner, that here should be established an annex for the 
higher education of young women, could be realized, anew departure 
of incalculable importance would bemadein the quarter most demanded 
by the rising ambition of thousands of the daughters of the State. 
But while the provision for the superior schooling of the more favored 
youth of Virginia was steadily increasing in quantity and quality 
through the forty years between 1820 and 1860, the leading class of her 
people seem never to have recognized the dream of Jefferson for the 
common schooling of the common people. From time to time conven- 
tions were held. Influential educational and public men like Henry 
A. Wise and numerous others uttered their-warning and persuading 
plea for the bread of life, and more than one abortive attempt was made 
to establish in especial localities something that should take the place 
of a common school. Butneither thelean and hungry arrangement for 
the schooling of the poor by the Literary Fund, nor the attempt at a 
county arrangement based on public taxation, made any great headway. 
Doubtless many of the children even of the poorer sort of families were 
assisted by private charity and several generous public gifts to rise 
above the level of their companions. There was an occasional ming- 
ling of all sorts and conditions in the great number of family, private, 
and Old-Field schools; and the academies for boys and girls were now 
and then invaded by ambitious youths, who, at all hazards, fought their 
way along the steep and rugged road that the American education was 
to the American boy and girl of half a century ago. But the condition 
of the educational destitution in which the State found itself in 1865, in 
the hour of its dire extremity, was the logical result of the narrow Eng- 
lish policy it had pursued in this as in other directions; and, in 1870, 
the cry went up, from the sea sands to the most distant recesses of the 
western mountains, for the establishment of the American people’s 
common school. 3 
In nothing has the really superior class of Virginia more notably 
declared its soundness, persistence, and capacity to hold fast to a great 
idea than in the way in which it stood by the educational ideas of Jef- 
ferson through the one hundred turbulent years from the outbreak of 
the war of the Revolution to the inauguration of the people’s common 
school in 1870. Every now and then a desperate effort was made to 
break out of the fatal circle of the old-time family and church notion of 
the school. Repeated conventions were held and some of the most 
brilliant and comprehensive pleas for universal education ever made 
were the efforts of this agitation. Among them, the famous address of 
the Hon. Henry A. Wise to his constituents in Accomack County on 
retiring from his Congressional career, was conspicuous for its almost 
prophetic outlook into the future. His nephew is now the able super- 
intendent of common schools in the city of Baltimore. At last, the 
close of the civil war, in 1865, first opened the way to the realization of 
the truly American scheme of the author of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, and to-day, under modern forms and methods, the essential 
ideas of this great educational statesman are implanted in the consti- 
tution and laws and steadily becoming accepted facts in the new Do- 
minion. 
In sight of the old Hampton Beach, where the first slave ship dis- 
gorged its freight of black savages, on their way out of African bar- 
barism toward the lofty goal of American citizenship, now rises the 
beautiful village called The Hampton Normal and Industrial Insti- 
tute. Established immediately after the advent of peace, by Gen. S.

troops, a remarkable blending of the statesman and scholar, it has 
fully taken up Jefferson’s plan of industrial training for the emanci- 
pated race and wrought it out with all the added experience of a hun- 
dred fruitful years. Not only has it profoundly interested the attention 
of the great wealthy Northeast, but it has become a part of the educa- 
tionalsystem of the Stateof Virginia, which pays annually into its treas- 
ury a portion of the income from the fund for the agricultural and me- 
chanical education of the people. And, as in further recollection of the 
old days, it now includes the training of one hundred youth of the Indian 
race, first met by the original settlers on this historic ground. An- 
other valuable school for the training of colored teachers now over- 
looks, from the towers of its stately buildings, the scene of the final 
conflict of the war of the sections, at Petersburg; while the State au- 
thorities every year are concerned in the management of the Sumner 
Institute of instruction for the same class of teachers. Sixty-eight 
thousand colored children arenowreceiving educational training, largely 
at the expense of the white people, in the common schools of the State. 
The college founded by Washington in Augusta County, beyond the 
mountains, received Gen. Robert E. Lee as president at the close of 
the war. In the reorganization of this venerable institution of learn- 
ing and its adjustment to the educational needs of the time, Gen. Lee 
displayed the same ability and vitality that made him the foremost 
military leader of the Confederacy. To-day Washington and Lee, gen- 
erously endowed from both sections of the country, is one of the most 
substantial of the Southern colleges. 
The son of one of the old presidents of Washington College, Dr. 
Ruffner, himself, before 1860, known all over the Union from a bold and 
powerful article on the institution of slavery, was wisely selected by the 
new State government to organize the. system of common schools de- 
manded by the new constitution of the Commonwealth, and for twelve 
years Dr. W. H. Ruffner administered the great office of first State 
commissioner of schools in Virginia in a way that made him the Horace 
Mann of the new South. The schoolman from abroad, who to-day sees 
how obstinately the old caste and sectarian spirit still resists the fit 
development of common schools established “for the people and by 
the people,” has but a faint impression of the prodigious task that con- 
fronted Dr. Ruffner in 1870. Myerywhere the old-time political, eccle- 
siastical, and social combination that had defeated Jefferson and kept 
the hated common school of the North out of the State for a hundred 
years, rallied in the last ditch for a final trial of strength. That in the 
brief space of twelve years of official service this accomplished and 
courageous leader had so conducted the educational campaign that his 
displacement from office in 1882 left the system so firmly established in 
the hearts of the people of Virginia that neither the relentless opposi- 
tion of the defeated combination of its enemies, the fierce agitations of 
anew political administration, and, most dangerous of all, the fearful 
inadequacy of the schools themselves to do their proposed work, were 
able to discourage the educational public of the State, is conclusive 
proof of the success of this momentous achievement, for in this experi- 
ment was involved not only the establishment of the American common- 
school system in Virginia, but virtually in all the States of the South. 
Even to-day the State of Jefferson leads the educational column south

for white youth in the State was a fit conclusion of his illustrious career, 
It may not be too much to demand that, in his later years, he shall 
publish a complete collection of his valuable official reports and his 
numerous writings in defense of the system of popular education which 
involved him in controversy with some of the most eminent men of the 
Commonwealth. 
As a vital department of the new system he incorporated Jeffer- 
son’s idea of the college in the form of the modern high school. 
He fully recognized the value of the industrial feature of educational 
life that now is so happily illustrated for white youth in the Miller 
Manual Labor School of Albemarle County, and in the Hampton 
Agricultural and Normal Institute for the colored people at Hamp- 
ton. His wise and politic organization of the common-school insti- 
tute in the summer of 1880, in the buildings and with the hearty 
codperation of the faculty of the University of Virginia, was the 
final victory which ended the long-time conflict of the upper side 
of the Old Dominion against the education of the masses at the expense 
and under the supervision of the State. To-day the University of 
Virginia has not only at last assumed its legitimate position as the 
erown of the public-school system, but it now has a special provision 
for the instruction of teachers as a prominent feature of its revised 
curriculum. Old William and Mary College has arisen from its deca- 
dence and, with the normal training of young men as its most prominent 
feature, now numbers a larger body of students than in its most palmy 
days. Dr. Ruffner was permitted to remain in office until he could say 
that a larger number of youth were attending schools of the second- 
ary and higher education in Virginia than at any former period of her 
history. 
In one respect it was given to this leader of the great educational 
movement in Virginia to surpass the ideal of Jefferson. A hundred 
years ago it was a social impossibility to urge the equal educational 
rights of the sexes anywhere in the American colonies. And nowhere 
was the old European prejudice against the serious higher culture of 
young women held with greater tenacity than in the Old Dominion. 
The family tutor or governess, with the occasional accompaniment of 
a neighborhood private school for girls only slowly evolved into the 
girls’ academy, of which there were several well-known institutions in 
the State before 1860; Hollins Institute for girls in Botetourt County 
by far the best known and most effective. 
But even with the increase of this feature of the educational outfit 
of the State, as late as 1885 Dr. Ruffner gave utterance, almost out of 
the bitterness of a hope long deferred, to words that bore testimony to 
the strange neglect of public provision for the higher education of the 
daughters of a Commonwealth of all others most profuse in oratory 
and the devotion of the old-time habit of chivalry in behalf of woman. 
Said Dr. Ruffner, speaking of the Farmville Normal School for girls: 
“My vision is not confined to this school, or to any school. — It is 
turned with anxious longing upon the entire body of Virginia women. 
How strangely have they been neglected by the ruling sex, They are 
mixed through and through our social life; we love them as we love 
nothing else upon earth; they have an immeasurable power over us, 
they dictate our personal habits, they raise our children, they refine 
our tastes, they conserve our morals, they keep burning the fires of 
religion—everywhere in our daily life is found the skillful hand, ready 
mind, the quenchless heart of woman. And yet where has there ever 
been any public recognition of her inestimable claims upon society?   
     
-P-A-G-E-244
  892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Men make provision for their boys out of public funds and for them- 
selves too—duly conserving every interest they have; but how wretch- 
edly small has been the share doled out to her who deserves every- 
thing. This is an injustice that will make our children ashamed of 
their fathers. But it is not only an injustice, it is an infatuation—an 
infatuation similar to that which kept down popular education generally 
in Virginia until a few yearsago. The power residing in woman, if util- 
ized and directed, would give to society a life, a grace, a purity, a skill, 
a progressiveness peculiarly its own, and the coming generation would 
receive a training in the homes, in the schools, in the social circles, in all 
the quiet but immeasurably potent centers and lines of influence such 
as can come from nowhere else. Behold what woman does now in a 
state of neglect and try to imagine what she could and would do if 
allowed the privileges which men have so liberally provided for them- 
selves. Do justice to the women of Virginia and every good thing 
will be developed in the State.” In an elaborate report devoted to the 
higher education of Virginia girls, Dr. Ruffner outlined the plan of an 
annex to the University of Virginia for young women, on the style of 
Girton and Newman at Oxford, England. The only step yet taken in 
this direction is the opening of the free high school to girls and the 
establishment of the excellent State Normal School at Farmyille; both 
secured under the administration of its first State superintendent of 
instruction. 
As a logical outcome of this great awakening of the educational 
spirit in Virginia, under the lead of Dr. Ruffner, there has beén a 
remarkable time of refreshing for the higher education of the State. 
It has been a wise policy that has aided in the establishment of these 
rival colleges and concentrated the attention of the people on the 
rehabilitation and endowment of the half-dozen on the ground. Of 
these, the University of Virginia, Washington and Lee, William and 
Mary, Hampden-Sidney, and Randolph-Macon have been largely rein- 
forced by benefactions from beyond the limits of Virginia; in some 
cases, aS in the gifts of McCormick, Austin, Brooks, Fayerweather, 
and Corcoran, to the university, and the generous contributions to 
Washington and Lee from the great cities of the Northeast, and the 
more moderate donations to the remaining institutions, as the interest 
taken in New England in one of the smallest of them, Roanoke College, 
- the gift of money has seemed all-the more precious as a testimonial of 
the pride and affection of the old Northeast and the new Northwest for 
the mother of Presidents. 
There has been a remarkable development of academies for both 
_ Sexes since 1865. Several of the most valuable fitting schools for the 
colleges and universities are of comparatively recent date. Staunton 
has a notable cluster of academies for girls, and everywhere, from 
Norfolk in the east to Bristol in the far west, this class of schools for 
the secondary training of young women is growing in numbers and in 
value. The State still waits for the establishment of a great school 
of technology in the mining region of the Shenandoah Valley and 
southwest. But within the present year the State Agricultural and 
Mechanical College at Blacksburg, on the summit level of the Common- 
wealth, has been reorganized in a fashion that promises a new career 
of enlarged usefulness to this most important feature in the higher 
education of a State so dependent on an energetic and progressive 
system of farming, mining, and manufactures. 
No State has more reason to regret the final defeat of the original 
movement for national aid to education, in 1890, than Virginia. Out      
   
-P-A-G-E-245
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 893 
of her magnificent bequest of public domain came the first great possi- 
bilities of the splendid policy of endowment of education by the gift of 
public lands that has given to the new Northwest the prodigious im- 
petus in educational provision for its whole people. It was indeed an 
unaccountable thing that the bill was finally defeated by the votes of 
Senators of States whose schools are to-day munificently endowed by 
the bounty of their impoverished mother. It can not be that the coun- 
try will be forever unmindful of the claims of the old colonial division 
of the Republic that surrendered its vast western domain to the States 
beyond the Alleghanies, for aid in the present home effort to perform 
their duty to the coming generation. Especially do States like Mary- 
land, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, from which these great dona- 
tions of an imperial territory have taken place, deserve consideration. 
It will come when our partisan politicians rise to the comprehension 
of the fact that only what makes for the uplift of the younger third of 
the people can be relied upon to solve the great problems of finance, 
suffrage, race, even the perplexities of the involved labor and social re- 
forms. Wemay decide each and all these matters connected with the 
material, political, and social welfare of the Republic again and again, 
in our heated political campaigns, only to find them confronting us at 
the end of every session of Congress. But only as we educate the 
youth who are to receive the perilous heritage of constitutional govern- 
ment into amore intelligent, righteous, patriotic, and skilled executive 
way of living, will there be a reasonable hope of the final solution of 
problems so far above the capacity of the average politician of the day. 
Said Jefferson, “Let us educate the children. Then the coming gen- 
eration will be wiser than we and many things impossible to us will be 
easy to them.” 
Among the eminent records of Virginia statesmanship none is more 
significant than the twenty-first annual report of the superintendent of 
public instruction of the Commonwealth of Virginia, with the accom- 
panying documents, forthe school year closing January 31,1891. Fourth 
of the superintendents of public instruction since the inauguration of 
the American system of common schools in 1870, the Hon. Jno. E. Mas- 
sey may well feel an honest satisfaction in presenting to the country and 
to Christendom such a record of great achievement as the educational 
history of the New Dominion during this brief generation. 
The most notable fact in this record is that, with the exception of 
three institutions for the higher education of boys, the medical school, 
and the institutions for the deaf, dumb, and blind, all partially depend- 
ent on State support and somewhat under State supervision, this entire 
group of educational agencies is the growth of the past twenty-five 
years since the close of the civil war. The University of Virginia, the 
Virginia Military Institute, and the College of William and Mary, all, 
to-day, contain a larger number of students, with superior facilities for 
proper collegiate work and more abundant resources, than at any pre- 
vious time. The recent establishments, the State Female Normal 
School for white girls, and the Virginia Agricultural and Mechan- 
ical College for white youth; the Virginia Normal and Collegiate 
Institute for colored youth; the Miller Manual Labor School of Albe- 
marle County for white boys and girls; the Hampton Normai and 
Agricultural Institute for negro and Indian students, and the normal 
department of William and Mary College for white young men, are all 
the fruit of the movement that dates from this later period. In addi- 
tion to this, the State for the first time in its history has seriously 
responded to the high demand of Jefferson for the free instruction of  
-P-A-G-E-246
  894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
her entire population in a system of common schools, far more thorough 
and effective than was in the mind of any American educator at the 
close of the Revolutionary War. 
From the tables of this elaborate and interesting report we learn 
that in 1891 there were 112 counties and cities in Virginia under the 
superintendence of public officials appointed by the State board of edu- 
cation, consisting of the governor, attorney-general, superintendent of 
education, and the secretary of the board. The salaries of these super- 
intendents range from $2,110 in Richmond, with four cities from $1,200 
to $1,370, to $200 as a minimum; $2 of the 107 counties below $500; the 
remaining between $500 and $740, making $70,000 in round numbers for 
State and local supervision. Of the 652,045 children and youth of school 
age (6 to 21), 376,650 are white and 275,388 are colored. Of this num- 
ber, 342,720 were enrolled in the common. schools—219,141 white and 
123,579 colored—of whom 193,536—126,848 white and 66,688 colored— 
are in average daily attendance. Of the pupils enrolled 8,269 are 
studying the higher branches. The enrollment represents 52.5 per cent, 
and the average daily attendance 29.6 per cent of the entire school 
population of the State; the average age of the pupils is 10.8. The 
exactions of the new Southern life tell heavily on the youth of both 
races after the age of 12. There are 7,689 schools open (of which 1,017 
are graded), with 5,710 white and 2,008 colored teachers—3,000 male 
and 4,600 female. The average salaries of men are $31.40 and of 
women $26.66 per month. These schools are open during an average 
period of 5.8 months per year, the long city and village offsetting the 
short country district term. The cost of tuition per month per pupil 
enrolled is 64 cents; $1.15 for actual attendance; the whole cost of 
popular education per month being 74 cents for number enrolled, and 
$1.32 for daily attendance—being $7.70 for the school year. The total 
cost of public education to-the State in 1891 was $1,636,982.84, Of 
this sum, $900,000 is supplied by the State and the remainder by 
county, district, and miscellaneous funds. Six thousand five hundred 
and nine schoolhouses represented an investment of $2,379,745.32, and 
had a seating capacity for 357,378 pupils. Of these, 147 are brick, 
4,650 frame, 79 stone, and 1,633 log; 5,943 have “suitable grounds.” 
There is a steady though moderate increase in attendance every year 
and the superintendents generally report the growth of the common 
school in popular favor, with some improvements in school accommoda- 
tions and the efficiency of teachers, by far the most important feature 
in the estimate. Three normal institutes for the’ teachers of each race 
were held during the summer of 1890, the funds, $5,800, including $2,800 
for the instruction of students in the Peabody Normal College at Nash- 
ville, being donated by the Peabody educational fund. In addition to 
the cost of the public schools, the State disburses an annual sum of 
probably over $100,000 to the several higher institutions subsidized; 
besides the receipts of the agricultural and normal college fund donated 
~ by the General Government. 
It would be difficult, if not impossible, to give even an approximate 
statement of the corresponding development of the academical and col- 
legiate institutions under private and denominational religious control 
in the twenty-five years since the close of the civil war. Every college 
in existence in 1860 has been sustained and, with perhaps one excep- 
tion, largely extended in facilities for instruction and attendance of 
students. No important academical foundation has been suspended, 
while nearly every school of this description has been enlarged, and 
several of the most important have been founded during this time. Not

the least in importance may be named several classical schools of supe- 
rior merit, tributary to the university, or furnishing an excellent outfit 
for collegiate life. The number of young persons sent to the North and 
to Europe for superior training has probably not diminished with the 
. improvement of home facilities. Indeed, the more the home field is 
tilled the greater is the crop of eager youth seeking the best opportu- 
nities where they can be found. The writer of this essay, during a 
twelve-years observation of the higher education of all the Southwestern 
States of the Union, has noted the increasing number of teachers in 
higher institutions hailing from Virginia. Ié would probably be safe 
to estimate the cost of public and private education for the people of . 
the Commonwealth for the current year at a sum not less than $2,000,- 
000, probably more than that large sum, of which several hundred 
thousand dollars are paid for the free schooling of children whose 
parents were slaves in 1860. In view of the pessimistic estimate of the 
negro problem by some of the literary and political writers of the 
period, it is encouraging to turn to the elaborate and able report of 
Gen. 8S. C. Armstrong, president of the Hampton Normal and A gricultu- 
ral Institute, in the matter referred to—a complete refutation of all the 
erude speculations emanating from the « priert theories and imperfect 
information of this entire class of writers. A work already in the press 
of the Hampton Institute concerning the experience of this, the most 
careful and conservative body of workers in this new field of educa- 
tional effort, will be a great comfort to all who have not despaired of 
the side of the Republic represented by its 7,000,000 new-made citizens 
of African descent. 
While it is not true that this remarkable statement represents any- 
thing like a complete arrangement for the fit schooling of the 600,000 
children and youth of school age, and while the system of public edu- 
cation, even in the majority of villages, and especially in the open 
country, where three-fourths of the pupils live, is painfully below the 
needs of this great State; and while the educational critic finds much 
to condemn in the organization and administration of this department 
of the Government, and the chronic agitator can find enough to point 
his sarcasm or sharpen his denunciation, still, under the conditions of 
public and private life in Virginia during the past twenty-tive years, 
this record is one of the most notable in the annals of mankind. Never 
before since the dawn of history has a commonwealth so overwhelmed 
by the results of a disastrous civil war risen with such persistent deter- 
mination, “renewed its strength like the eagle’s,” and in one short and 
troubled generation placed itself in all ways so far in advance of any 
previous period of its history. And when we remember that the pres- 
ent year has brought the great relief of a final settlement of the finan- 
cial troubles of the State; that in no yéar has there been such an invest- 
ment of capital frony abroad in the development of its resources; that 
from the seaboard to the western mountains the State is astir with 
the movement of a great expectation of material prosperity, only for a 
time checked by the usual excess of speculation in real estate, there 
is ample ground for the just hope of the days that areto come. During 
the most intense period of the civil war, in 1863, a devoted band of 
teachers in the city of Petersburg organized the first educational asso- 
ciation of Virginia. In the summer of 1891 this association, consisting 
of the male educators representing the higher education, was absorbed. 
in a general State educational association founded at Bedford City, one 
of the new centers of industry and education in the southwest, including 
the public school interests, with many of the able and enthusiastic

women teachers of the State in attendance and participating in all its 
doings. The omensare all bright for an advance in the educational life 
of Virginia during the coming ten years, which will not only keep the old 
Commonwealth where she has always been, at the head of the South, 
put will place her in line with the great northern States, 
But just now the observer of this interesting feature in the develop- 
ment of new Virginia is especially attracted by that portion already 
referred to, the twenty-five counties included in the southwest, extend- 
ing from the new city of Roanoke to the borders of Tennessee, West 
Virginia, and North Carolina, A tour of several months through the 
most interesting portion of this district has furnished the materials for 
the present essay on education in southwestern Virginia, There is no 
pretense that this estimate is comprehensive in its details; neither does 
the writer attempt to declare the complete value of schools or pass 
judgment on the educational merit or demerit of the different towns 
and cities of the region. Enough if such a statement as he is able to 
make, after honest and persistent attempts to reach the truth of the 
matter, can exhibit to the people, especially to the generous youth of 
this favored land, the opportunities, invitations, and reasonable expec- 
tations of the coming years. Itis largely with the view of giving to 
the youth of this region the conclusions of a friendly observer, after 
walking about their Zion, that the present essay is dedicated to them, 
their teachers, and the friends of universal education in Virginia. 
The reasonable foundation of the great expectations of Virginia, as . 
of the entire South, is the vast reserve of material resources in every 
Southern State. In this respect the oldest of the sisterhood of the six- 
teen former slave-holding Commonwealths is notably among the fore- 
most. After the exhaustion of a portion of her old eastern fields by a 
culture of nearly three hundred years and the latest dismemberment of 
her territory, there still remains as the Virginia of to-day a realm larger 
in extent than some of the historical nations of Europe, and this por- 
tion is as essentially “a new country” as some of the recently admitted 
States of the Northwest. 
From the city of Roanoke, Roanoke County, which in five years has 
risen from a railroad station to a flourishing city of 20,000 people, 
stretching away to the southwest, with a narrow annex to the north 
and south, are found the twenty-five counties in general terms known 
as southwestern Virginia. In comparison with the State of Massachu- 
setts, most eminent for wealth, general prosperity, and the influence 
that depends on intelligent industry, this region includes 14,000 square 
iniles as against 8,000 in the Bay State. In all except the possession 
of 50 miles of seacoast, with two or three harbors of the first class, 
southwestern Virginia in every respect may claim an unquestioned su- 
periority in the natural resources for the building of a great common- 
wealth. In its large areas of fertile soil for variety of crop culture and 
extensive grazing, with skilled farming adequate to the support of a 
larger population than now inhabits any American State; in its mar- 
velous wealth of coal and iron and other valuable minerals; in its 
boundless forests of precious woods; in its abundance of water power; 
in its climate, by all odds the most favorable of any southern and not 
inferior to any American commonwealth; in its peculiar felicity of geo- 
grapical situation, at the meeting of the ways of the great North and 
Southwest and the Northeast; in its occupation for one hundred years 
bya population of the best original European stock, the plain British peo- 
ple and the Germans of the Lutheran sort, now representing 400,000 of 
the 1,600,000 people of the State, with-its small colored contingent, as in

the West, chiefly gathered in the villages and new centers of develop- 
ment, with only the later immigrant population recently called in by the 
rapid development of the mining and manufacturing districts; already 
connected with the adjacent parts of the Union by important lines of 
railroads, which are stretching out their arms of steel into every cor- 
ner of its territory; not inferior in picturesque beauty and grandeur of 
alternating mountain range, valley, hill, and fertile “cove,” to any por- 
tion of the country east of the Mississippi; here is an outfit of nature 
and a favorable condition of human affairs that explains the fact that 
to-day the eye of the capitalist at home and abroad is concentrated on 
this favored land as upon no other portion of the Republic. 
And here is found, in connection with all the substantial advantages 
of a new country, the historical background, the lack of which is areal 
disadvantage in the vast unoccupied wilderness beyond the mountains. 
For a hundred years this 14,000 square miles of the Old Dominion has 
been slowly prepared for the great day of its appearance on the stage 
of the new American era of improvement. From the first, the vast 
majority of these people have been farmers, in moderate circumstances, 
living according to the slow, obscure ways of the rural American of 
half a century ago. The few great plantations of the valleys absorbed 
the slave interest and, outside of an inevitable leadership in public 
and social life, this class did not essentially affect the life of the plain 
people. The more restless spirits were drawn off by the settlement of 
the new southwest. The country beyond the mountains, now known 
as West Virginia, remained for many years rather a portion of the new 
northwest than of the old Virginia of the seaboard. Between these 
rival interests that finally divided the State, this important region 
remained, biding its time for development. 
Already, by the enterprising policy of its great railroad and land com- 
panies, itis being better supplied with good hotel accommodations than 
any portion of the South. The great southwest is drifting thither as 
the most attractive summer home, and every week sees a large excur- 
sion train, filled with the restless pleasure seekers of the luxurious 
eastern cities, seeking “ fresh fields and pastures new” for the stimu- 
lants of an appetite for novelty, satiated and gorged by European travel 
and the laborious vacation life of the seashore and huge centers of met- 
ropolitan resort. The population left on the soil, after the steady drain 
of the past twenty-five years to the far West and Southwest and the 
eastern cities, is perhaps in the best condition for the developing forces 
of the new American civilization through all their various agencies of 
popular stimulation and culture. In public affairs it can hardly be 
called a vital part of the “ Solid South” or ofarival consolidated North, 
being conspicuous for a political independence which has more than 
once given it a decisive voice in the affiirs of the State; though in 
accord with the Confederacy during the Civil war, its territory was 
largely exempt from the ravages of the great conflict; especially was 
it saved from the terrible strife of divided factions which has inflicted 
on the entire border land, from Virginia to Kansas, a chronic habit of 
local exasperation and political bitterness that only a coming genera- 
tion can outlive. Nowhere in the South is there to-day a people more 
truly patriotic and nowhere in the Commonwealth of Virginia are the 
noble historic traditions of the Old Dominion in behalf of liberty and 
union more firmly and obstinately cherished. 
It is just this condition of affairs that makes the recent great invest- 
ment of capital from the North and from Europe so important to the 
future of this region. Southwest Virginia is not an Eldorado whose 
ED 91 57

  898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
“booming” attractions invite the fierce, reckless, and unreliable adven- 
turer from all parts of the earth. It is nota country that is to be over- 
flowed by any rapid immigration from home or abread. Its present 
population is of the substantial quality that, when once fully awakened te 
the importance of what is going on in its midst, will straightway prepare 
the coming generation to join hands with the new life, and in due time 
come into possession of all the substantial opportunities and successes 
of anew era. And herein is a great advantage, not always appreciated, 
especially by the people of the North, in the social, political, religions, 
and educational development of the New South. The enthusiastic 
expectations of the early days of reconstruction that the South was to be 
made over by a vast campaign of education into an annex of the vic- 
torious North, has long since become the “ baseless fabric of a vision, 
leaving not a wrack behind.” No American State, county, or neighbor- 
hood can or ought to be overrun by the superiority of a neighboring 
people, or its characteristics stamped out, even by missionary zeal for 
higher things. Only by the gradual, ir resistible progress of universal 
education of the “American type, the slow and sure training of the 
heart, the head, and the hand of the younger generation, by the hearty 
coéperation and sympathy of all corresponding States and sections, can 
areliable growth into the higher American citizenship be secured. 
Whatever is otherwise attempted, with prospects however brilliant, 
inevitably comes to a fatal collision with an awakened and exasperated 
local sentiment, leaving “the last state worse than the first.” 
Here is just the happy adjustment of social forces needed to make the 
new Virginia of the Southwest an object lesson in the true readjustment 
of American society in the South. The great investment of capital that 
is now opening the mines, building new towns, carrying newrailroads like 
spider webs of steel and iron all over this wonderland, is not a hostile 
influence working for the dispossession of the home proprietor. The 
inevitable collapse of the real estate boom with which the country is 
now somewhat depressed is only the reaction of an overexcited move- 
nient, and will be a healthy warning rather than a permanent backset 
to the country. Within twenty years, probably sooner, southwestern 
Virginia, with anything like a judicious management of its industrial 
opportunities, will offer to its ambitious and active young men and 
  ~ women such chances of industrial success as have never been known 
in any portion of the South from the beginning. In the mine, on the 
farm, in the development of all varieties of manufactures, in the count- 
ing room, at the teacher’s desk, in the call for a superior clergy and a 
higher type of commercial and political talent—in all the characteris- 
tic American avenues of occupation, there will be a call that will bring 
the home people into the most intimate connection with the leaders of 
these great enterprises. Eighty per cent.of the men worth $100,000 
to-day in the United States were the poor American boys of a genera- 
tion ago, and more than 80 per cent of the women who are the true 
“first 400” of every community are recruits from the same great Ameri- 
can hive. There is no good reason why in half a century the descend- 
ants of the southwestern Virginia people of this decade should not 
become the virtual possessors of the plant now being made on the soil 
and come into most intimate connection with the substantial people 
coming to this promised land. Certain it is that, whatever may be the 
theories of any party of reaction, the Virginia of the year of our Lord 
1892 is “lifting its eyes unto the hills” of its own southwest with a 
mighty faith that in “Ged’s country” beyond the Blue Ridge, the

splendid valley of the Shenandoah, and the New Southwest, will be 
found its strength for the coming momentous years. 
Tt will be well if this fact is speedily recognized by the present pop- 
ulation of this portion of the old Commonwealth as the inevitable con- 
dition of the best possible success. It will be ‘as easy as preaching” 
to plant in every valley of southwestern Virginia a little “hell-town,” 
representing the worst features of the worst form of human degrada- 
tion, in an ignorant, reckless, brutal laboring population—a hideous 
stew of all races, nationalities, and undesirable home folk—in chronic 
conflict with a grasping, materialistic moneyed aristocracy, bent only 
on working the land for all it is worth. Already is this to be seen in 
more than one of this sudden growth of towns, sprung up in the night 
into a hideous apparition that defies the savagery of the wildest moun- 
tain clan. It is not pretended that a great region like this, under the 
present stimulation of sudden material development, will of itself 
evolve into a social paradise or in any way become anything good which ~ 
the foremost people within its borders do not insist on its beéoming. 
The boom that is now rushing down the valleys of Virginia and Ten- 
nessee is the same eld boom that in turn has excited every land, in 
every age, with brilliant prophecy of the millenium, The wisest word 
yet spoken concerning the development of an American city or region 
was the response of Mr. Jay Gould, two years ago, to a group of inter- 
viewers, to the effect that the great cities and favored regions of the 
earth were not the inevitable outgrowth of great natural resources, 
favorable climate, or geographical position, but were built up en the 
solid foundations of personal character, social refinement, religious-and 
educational enterprise, and a good home life of the better class of the 
population. Here is the bottom fact in this, as in every portion of our 
great Republic, newly awakened to feverish activity and compelled to. 
pose as the last “bonanza land” before the superior public opinion of 
Christendom. No vulgar, vicious, ignorant people anywhere in the 
United States of America, swollen with the conceit of its own superi- 
ority to the rest of mankind, inviting the stranger to the admiration of 
a provincial type of life, is to be lifted into importance by any advan- 
tage of climate, scil, wealth of mine, or other physical superiority. Only 
that country which recognizes in its material advantages a call of 
Providence to rise up and adjust itself to the foremost life of this 
“grand and awful time” in which we live and move will find an out- 
come from final wreckage in the most flattering prospect of the future. ° 
To the thoughtful observer, as he looks out from the windows of that 
real progress which means the superiority of man over all his environ- 
ments and the control of all his surroundings by the power of a Christian 
civilization, the southwestern Virginia of to-day presents one of the 
-most interesting problems of American society. It stands at the part- 
ing of the ways, and the few swift-coming years will determine whether 
this inevitable material prosperity shall be the angel going before or 
the demon spurring from behind. It is with this profound conviction 
that we have studied the present educational status of these twenty- 
five counties of the southwest; not in the mood of an educational 
critic, but with the hopeful spirit of a “ministry of education” which 
prays for a revival—that uplift of a whole people toward the higher 
life which is the prophecy of a Christian civilization as the ruling foree 
in national affairs. : 
From the accessible records of the educational life of this region pre- 
vious to 1860, it is evident that it was in every way the least-favored 
portion of the Virginia of that day. The great educational opportuni-

ties of the State for two hundred and fifty years have been monopolized 
by the favored plantation class beyond the eastern mountains. The 
Virginia “out West,” now West Virginia, was gaining by contact with 
the new and vigorous Northwest. Here, in the middle country, par- 
tially isolated from the great world of which it is really the geograph- 
ical center, the opportunities for good schooling for the masses were 
meager and unsatisfactory. The ‘old-field school” was one of the 
makeshifts of the pioneer civilization that was good or bad according 
to the master of ceremonies. The most enlightening account of these 
pioneer arrangements is found in a remarkable series of historical mem- 
oranda, called out in the first year’s service of the Hon. R. R. Farr as 
State superintendent of instruction, in 1885, at a superintendents’ con- 
ference held-in Richmond in February of that year. A majority of 
the county and local superintendents of common schools preseuted 
there a remarkable series of reports concerning the early status of edu- 
_ cation in their districts. While, as a whole, these brief monographs 
bear new testimony to the exceeding difficulty of gathering up reliable 
statistics by hearsay and often highly colored reports concerning the 
real condition of education and the actual illiteracy of the population, 
yet enough was produced to make a vivid presentation of the difficul- 
ties that beset the youth of large regions of the Old Dominion, even at 
a late day, in this respect.. The field school was generally a private- 
subscription term of schooling, built up by the efforts of a master and. 
a few of the more earnest patrons, held in the most available building, 
often of a very primitive character; the school itself depending entirely 
on the quality of the teacher. What the average quality was can be 
found out by a perusal of these interesting reminiscences. Especially 
in these twenty-five counties, the majority of which are distant from the 
old educational centers of the State, sparsely populated, formerly some- 
what out of touch with the great influential classes of the Common- 
wealth; were these opportunities, even for a large majority of the peo- 
ple, very scanty. A better sort of schools were the privileged groups 
of children of the more favored families, taught by superior teachers, 
often in the homes of the leading patrons. The entire region contained 
but two institutions fairly entitled to the name of college, and these 
for boys—Roanoke College, at Salem, then in its early struggle for 
existence, and farther to the southwest, Emory and Henry, which for 
a number of years was a great power for the training of clergymen, 
teachers, and public men to the entire southwest. A small number of 
academies for girls date back to this early era. These were chiefly of 
a denominational Christian type, very largely an annex to the sect on 
which the school chiefly depended for support. Indeed, we must look 
to the superior clergy and the more enlightened and vigorous of the 
religious sects for the chief influence in the development of the second- 
ary and higher education here, as in all portions of the South, in that 
early day. On the border, between the old Virginia of the east and 
the great southwest, Hollins Institute was for many years conspicuous. 
Begun by a clergyman from the North as a normal school for the train- 
ing of teachers, it happily fell under the control of Dr. Cocke, who, 
still, after a generation of good service, maintains it as one of the best 
schools for girls in all the Southland. Farther down, at Christians- 
burg, Marion, Wytheville, Abingdon, Bristol, and other places less con- 
spicuous, were academies for boys and girls, all reliable institutions 
for their day, all the fruit of sacrifices and toils by men like Rey. Creed 
Fulton and his contemporaries, whose labors are the noblest educa- 
tional heritage of this locality. -A considerable number of the leading

_ instructors in this section were drawn from the Northeast, which, until 
the later alienation of the sections forbade, was the hive from which great 
numbers of teachers in all sorts of schools were drawn. 
It is not our purpose to attempt a picture of the educational condition 
of this region during the past seventy-five years of its settlement, even 
until the breaking out of the civil war. It would be impossible to draw 
a picture that would be satisfactory to the vigilant home critic of all 
Southern history written to date. The materials do not exist for a 
presentation that will be accepted as just by anybody. Probably the 
brief reports of the one hundred superintendents of common schools,in 
1885 are as near as is possible to come to the facts of the case, and these 
are accessible in the report of the State superintendent of education 
for that year. 
But whatever may have been the deficiency of popular culture to 
this date, all accounts report the state of education immediately fol- 
lowing the close of the war as sufficiently depressed to excite the 
gravest apprehension. From 1865 to 1870 was everywhere in the 
South a season of prostration, alternating with fierce outbreaks of local 
resistance to the national military rule. While attempts were made 
to revive the old-time field subscription schools, and academies and 
colleges were resuming their activity, still all beside the favored few 
were in a condition that made the use of these educational advantages 
impossible. It was not until 1870, when the American system of 
common schools for the first- time was introduced into the oldest 
American Commonwealth, that a vast majority of the people of this 
great region had a fair opportunity to give to their children even the 
small elementary schooling that is still the meager pittance accorded 
to the majority of Southern children to- day. 
But we shall greatly misjudge this section of the Southern white peo- 
ple if we infer that this prevailing illiteracy in the knowledge and use 
ot books implied.a fatal lack in education. Here is the rock on which 
so many of our university men and educational experts to-day are 
aground—the comparison of European and American youth on exclu- 
sively literary lines. It may be,as President Eliot is fond of telling us, 
that the French or German boy of 16 knows his Latin grammar and 
some other portions of the school curriculum more thoroughly than our 
own. The American boy, meanwhile, has been a close and eager student 
in the greatest university of all the ages, thenew American life. At18he 
knows] more of what he must do and be as a man than the average Euro- 
pean man knows or can know under the existing conditions of his outdoor 
life. While we must insist on the increasing thoroughness and cor- 
rectness of our school work for all classes and conditions of our peo- 
ple, we need not forget that the special merit of republican institutions 
is their educational power over the citizen from the cradle to the 
grave. 
No portion of the American people from the beginning has so profited 
by the experiences and opportunities of this national university of the 
common American life as the class we sometimes call “the third es- 
tate of the South;” the nonslaveholding, plain people, who, in 1860 
constituted an overwhelming majority of the white population of these 
sixteen Southern States. No section of American history could be woven 
into a story of the making of a republic more thrilling in incident, more 
instructive to the social philosopher or historian, than the true story of 
the rise and growth of this portion of the southern white population, 
from its earliest appearance upon the Atlantic seaboard south until

‘its last uprising in the Farmers’ Alliance of the present decade. At 
first it was the most adventurous and independent class of the south- 
ern country; the least satisfied with the high aristocratic complexion of 
the Old Dominion by thesea. It pushed through the gaps of the nearer 
mountains, forced back the line of savage warfare in the decisive 
battle of Point Pleasant, broke the power of the Indian, and, under 
the lead of Col. George Washington, cleared the country of the French- 
man and his brutal allies, even before the Revolution. There has rarely 
been a more capable set of men than the better class of the early immi- 
grants to southwestern Virginia. The records of the half century before™ 
the Revolutionary war abound with the exploits of this courageous, 
all-enduring, and powerful people—the makers of Kentucky, Tennessee, - 
and the new Southwest. In their way they were a body of religious, 
moral, and solid colonists of a new country whose perils and hardships - 
already imparted to their stern and decisive character a strain of feroc- 
ity and almost barbarism in their dealings with the “noble savage,” 
of whose nobility they had no high estimation. The admirable series 
of volumes by Edmund Kirke (Mr. Gilmore), on the early settlement 
of Tennessee, with the brilliant sketch of the environment of Andrew 
Jackson by James Parton, and the growing literature of this interesting 
portion of the old republic, furnish an illuminating picture of these 
times and men. Itis significant that the three older Presidents of the 
United States—best known through Christendom—Washington, Jack- 
son, and Lincoln—were all, to a great extent, educated by the pioneer life 
of this time and this region, and the present Chief Magistrate of the 
United States, Benjamin Harrison, is the descendant of his grand- 
father, whose big hat covered a head trained in the game stringent 
school. While Washington, with the assembled forces of the eastern 
colonies, was holding the British empire at bay from Boston to Savan- 
nah, Lewis, Sevier, and their partisan associates of the backwoods 
were achieving the equally important and more trying conquest of the 
wild West and. clearing the land of the British oecupancy. And later 
it was the ominous cloud of southwestern riflemen, hovering on the hori- 
zon of the vast French empire of the Southwest, that made Napoleon, 
shrewdest of imperial politicians, sell out the territory now represented 
_ by a domain of twenty great American Commonwealths. Later yet, 
the same rough-and-ready army followed the heels of Jackson in clear- 
ing the country to the Gulf of Indian occupation; the climax of that 
remarkable series of campaigns being the memorable battle of New 
Orleans. Still later, a group of the same sort of people were the ma- 
jority of the advanced guard of American life that swarmed into Texas 
and, under the lead of a Tennessee President, forced the Mexican war, 
which gave to the country the splendid Pacific realm, itself one of the 
noblest empires on the face of the earth. 
The civil war was the fit climax of this campaign of the Southwest of 
a hundred years in bringing this portion of the Republic, consisting of 
the old Orange County of Virginia in 1630, to the front. There is no 
doubt that nine-tenths of the nonslayeholding population of this region 
of West Virginia, North Carolina, eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, 
northern Georgia and Alabama, western Arkansas, and southern Mis- 
souri were as thoroughly opposed to the great secession movement of 
1861 as the people of New England. The revolt in the east at once 
separated from Virginia the territory now known as the progressive 
State of West Virginia. It rallied the mountain population to the 
defense of the Union, and 140,000 white soldiers, a greater army than 
Washington ever commanded, shouldered arms and followed the old  
-P-A-G-E-255

flag to the end. The bitter end of the civil war was felt by these 
2,000,000 people in the central section of the United States where the 
warfare of armies was supplemented by the terrible strife of rival fami-_ 
lies, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, schools and churches, 
of which the wounds are not healed even to this day. Here, during 
these tremendous years from 1860 to 1870, was a training school of 
manhood and womanhood even in the region least disturbed by the 
outward conflict of armies, the twenty-five counties now known as 
southwestern Virginia. To speak of such a people, so drilled, tutored, 
and trained in the great university of the pioneer American life for a 
whole century as uneducated is a misuse of terms. And beyond this 
stringent and varied discipline of actual life these people were further 
educated by the original method of all civilized nations. The “plain 
speaking” in the pulpit and on the stump of this end of the old South- 
ern life has forced its way from the mountain region of the central 
South out into the free West, east of the Blue Ridge, into the very 
heart of the culture of the fastidious Northeast. The old-time high- 
soaring oratory of the educated Southern States, and the concentrated 
discourse of the corresponding class in the Northeast, have both “paled 
their ineffectual fires” before the direct, powerful, home-dealing talk of 
the Southwestern pioneer. The coming type of eloquence in the 
Republic is based on this, the most effective method yet found of moving — 
men, women, and children to great deeds and._to progressive thinking. 
So out of this object-lesson of the American life, annotated and punc- 
tuated by the public and private conditions of the Southwestern pioneer 
American civilization, did this people of which we write get a prepara- 
tion for the first common school of the masses and the reconstruction 
~of the old-time academical and collegiate training of the more favored, 
which makes what we now call the new education of the new South. 
Never was the hand of Providence more visibly stretched forth in 
our American life than in the call of Horace Mann, in 1835, to lead the 
first reconstruction of the old-time New England district, country, and 
village school into the present graded commor-school system of the 
United States. Of equal significance and no less potent in its outeome 
was the appointment of Dr. William H. Ruffner to the difficult pioneer 
position of State superintendent of education in Virginia, thirty-five 
years later, in 1870." Of all the States of the Union, perhaps, Virginia 
was the least disposed, up to this date, to adopt the common-school 
system of the Northern States of the Union. Only by a careful study 
of the educational situation, even at the close of the war, when the 
leading class was left almost destitute of the.means to educate their 
children in the old-time exclusive way, can we obtain a true insight 
into the difficult position oecupied by the new superintendent, and 
especially by the subordinate local supervisors of the new schoolsystem, 
almost forced upon the people. It probably was fortunate, that at the 
beginning supreme power was lodged in the State board of education, 
practically in the State superintendent, to appoint every local, county, 
and city superintendent of common schools in the Commonwealth. In 
this way Dr. Ruffner was able to place his hand on a body of men who 
believed in the new régime and could be trusted for some reasonable 
effort to make the new school system a reality. 
The history of the introduction of the new common school system 
into southwestern Virginia reads like a romance in the brief records of 
the superintendents of the twenty-five counties now under observation, _ 
All paint in almost tragic colors the disadvantages under which the 
mass of the white people labored up to the time of the inauguration of

the new arrangements. Says one: “ Not one in five of the whole popu- 
lation was possessed of the rudiments of an education.” Says another: 
“The log schoolhouses, few and far between, scattered here and there, 
- would tell a sad tale of ignorance to the masses and culture only to the 
few.” Another says: “ Previous to 1860 five great families held nearly 
the entire fertile portion of our county. They divided society into two 
classes, Virginia gentlemen and slaves; the poor dependent whites 
occupying a position like the grain between the two millstones.” Still 
another declares: “The records of this antebellum time are written in 
the ignorance of the masses of the people.” Still another: “Education 
acquired by means of public money was considered an arrangement for 
paupers only.” The first superintendent of one of these counties writes, 
on giving up his office to his successor: “I have so far ruled for good 
morals in the case of applicants for certificates as teachers as to send 
none to trustees for employment who use profane language, drink 
drams, gamble, dance, or are otherwise of questionable character.” 
Well might the superintendent of Washington County write in 1885: 
The new common-school system was incorporated into our organic law 
by a convention composed of members many of whom were considered 
as not atall in sympathy with a large and hitherto influential class of 
our people, The whole movement was new and, in many features, con- 
trary to all our cherished notions and hereditary traditions. Its ene- 
mnies predicted that. the system would of itself fall to pieces in a short 
time and be buried out of sight never to be resurrected. The opposi- 
tion and distrust were decidedly outspoken in this county for several 
years—in some neighborhoods perhaps more than others. The impro- 
vised houses were areproach to the name of school. The teachers were 
often without any especial fitness for their calling, since the better class 
were unwilling to engage in a free school. The State, however, had 
been fortunate in its selection ofa man to put the machinery in mo- 
tion who was heart and soul in the work, who was a true believer in 
free schools and who, by his energy, wisdom, and unsurpassed tact, at 
length lifted the despised system from its low estate to great useful- 
ness. He laid foundations broad and deep, upon which has been built 
up the magnificent structure which bids fair to be the State’s chief 
glory and the people’s greatest benefaction.” 
But not even the high qualities and burning zeal of the eminent State 
superintendent could have won the victory had not the soil of this cor- 
ner of the Old Dominion been prepared for the great awakening in 
behalf of the children, Of course, the new system was opposed by 
all the forces of the old régime, too often by those who were to become 
its most generous benefactors and most ardent friends. Poverty in 
the masses, class prejudice, sectarian bigotry disguised as zeal for 
Christian education, the deeply-rooted prejudice against the pauper 
free school of the old day, somewhat the sectional jealousy against 
everything coming from the victorious North, the greed of avarice—all 
these and other considerations only less powerful were enlisted against 
the new departure. But it is interesting to note how, in the fifteen 
years before this report of progress, these barriers had been so largely 
burned away and the common school, in theory at least, had been gen- 
erally adopted throughout this portion of the State. In fact, some of 
the mountain counties took to it at once with a vigor and zest that 
shamed the more cultivated section of the Commonwealth. Superin- 
tendent Ruffner holds up Grayson County, perched upon the plateau of 
the Blue Ridge, to the admiration of the State. ‘In the first year,” he 
says, “it had started forty-two schools, being excelled by only seven of  
-P-A-G-E-257
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 905 
the more populous and more favorably situated counties of the State; 
and even these seven counties were excelied in enrollment. Grayson, 
rough and mountainous, with her snows and hard winters, enrolled 66 
per cent of her school population (6 to 21) the first year, thus leading 
_ eyery county in the State in this respect.” In 1885 every county super- 
intendent in this portion of the State was-able to report a most grati- 
fying advance in the popular interest in education, an improvement in 
school buildings, gain in teachers, and increasing attendance of chil- 
dren. The chief impediment to an immediate and eminent success was 
the chronic Southern difficulty of the lack of funds to put on the ground 
a system so expensive as the free schooling of the whole people. . Thou- 
sands of children here and. through the Southland were and still are 
kept away from the new schools by the distance, difficulty of regular 
attendance, especially through the winter, unfit clothing, exposure in 
unsuitable buildings; sometimes by the unworthiness of such teachers 
as can be had at from $20 to $50 per month for the three or four months 
of the school year. 
It is a sufficient answer to the assertion of the Northern enemies of 
the Blair bill that, with scarcely an exception, the one hundred city and 
county superintendents of Virginia in 1885 presented the hope of 
national aid of education as the great expectation and reliance of the 
people. The first long delay of this beneficent measure and its final 
defeat in 1891 have been among the most potent causes of hope de- 
ferred, deepening almost to despair, concerning an effective system of 
popular education, observed by the writer of this essay as a present 
sentiment among the friends of good schooling in this portion of the 
State. Another backset has undoubtedly been the involving of the 
school system in the hotly contested partisan politics of the Common- 
wealth since 1880. The solemn warnings of Dr. Ruffner against this, 
one of the most fatal of the group of children’s diseases that invariably 
infest any new system of popular education, were unheeded. This great 
leader of the people was deposed after a term almost as long as that of 
Horace Mann, and the ax of political decapitation, placed in the hands 
of the State board, has henceforth been wielded in the usual American 
partisan political way.. But so firmly had the system been founded in 
the hearts of the people during the preceding period, and every new 
State superintendent and probably a majority of the local superintend- 
ents had been so inspired or swept along by a decisive and progressive 
public opinion, that the common school of the Virginia of to-day in 
some ways is the advance guard of universal education in the South, 
and, with all its infirmities, was never in so good a condition to take 
the field for the final overcoming of illiteracy as in the present year. 
The vigorous way in which the city of Lynchburg, on the border of this 
section of the State, took up the new system from the first, and made 
itself one of the foremost of Southern cities in the excellency of its 
schools; and the zeal with which its efficient superintendents have 
wrought in the home work and its present chief official in the new insti- 
tute work of this portion of the Commonwealth, have been powerful 
influences in the success of the movement. 
There is no educational problem of more commanding interest in the 
sixteen Southern States to-day than the thorough organization of the 
educational interest in these twenty-five counties, grouped in this essay 
as southwestern Virginia. With a present population of 400,000, 
90 per cent of the native white stock from which have been going forth 
for a hundred years the most valuable pioneers of the Southwest, 
overburdened neither with the lower colored nor recently imported

European contingent, there would seem to be no good reason why this 
favored realm of all the Southland should not become, in time, the 
most vital end of the old Commonwealth, and in connection with East 
Tennessee and the adjacent highland region, the most prosperous and. 
influential portion of the old central Southern dominion. A tour, in 
1892, of several months through the valley region of this country, with 
unusual opportunities of obtaining information concerning the present 
status of educational affairs, both in the towns and through the open 
country, has only confirmed the growing impression of the twelve years 
of our ministry of education in the South, that here, just now, is the 
providential soil to put ia seed of the best quality and the most gen- 
erous quantity for an abundant harvest in the near future. 
The problem in this region, broadly stated, is, How can the present 
generation of children and youth in this portion of Virginia, at least 
50,000 between the ages of 6 and 14 and near 100,000 of legal school 
age, be given the opportunities of good schooling and self-improvement 
which will bring them out abreast of the demands which their own 
home country will make upon every competent young man and woman 
within the next ten or fifteen years? At present I see that the inevi- 
_ table drift of the more ambitious young men from the rural districts 
toward the new towns and the more progressive regions of their States 
has well begun. The county superintendents of schools report that a 
considerable class who have been available as teachers in the common 
schools have been carried away by the boom that recently swept like a 
swollen river down the great. central valley, but whose backwater is 
now the cause of a temporary stagnation in enterprise and often of 
serious depression among large bodies of people. It is from a region 
like this and the adjacent portions of States like Tennessee, Virginia, 
and North Carolina that this drift is most apparent. The superior strata 
of country boys, discouraged by the scanty returns of the ordinary 
method of farming that still “lingers shivering on the brink and fears 
to launch away,” are everywhere setting their faces toward some rising 
sun, real or apparent. The ambitious and bright girls are wearying of 
the home life, which was all the mothers and grandmothers knew, and, 
spite of the eloquent pleadings of the rural clergy and the glowing 
pictures of rural felicity drawn by the magazine poets, are making the 
_ best of time toward the 350 ways of earning a respectable living for a 
woman found at the great centers of the new national life. Itis simply 
wasted breath to scold or entreat them to stay. Some of them may not 
find what they seek; but all of them will measurably satisfy the great 
longing of American youth for a broader and more stirring environ- 
ment; greater opportunities for doing their best; social, religious, and 
educational privileges for their own children as they come on, better 
than they or their ancestors have yet known. At present there is a 
moderate call for their services in the score of new industrial centers 
growing in local importance up and down the valleys. But unfor- 
tunately only a limited number of these young people have the train- 
ing essential for the positions of expert clerks, engineers, foremen, or 
- skilled workmen.of any sort. These places, often very desirable, are 
now filled very largely by young men and women prepared for such 
work elsewhere; oftener than otherwise from the neighboring Northern 
States. The same disability to take advantage of the situation is found 
among a large class of the rural population. The director of a great 
mining plant in this country stated that, for several years after the 
beginning of his enterprise, he was compelled to keep on his rolls twice 
the number of men required for actual service in order to obtain the
-P-A-G-E-259
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 907 
needed work. Thus, while other portions of the country are receiving 
many of the superior youth who often would be better off at home, the 
educational facilities of these twenty-five counties are neither sufficient 
in quantity nor of the peculiar quality or adaptation to bring out these 
50,000 children and youth in a way required to meet the demands of 
the swiftly coming years. Yet there isno body of American youth that 
a wise and progressive educator would regard as better material for the 
coming race than is found in this later region which has patiently 
bided its time, now almost three hundred years, awaiting this summons 
to launch into the coming life of the Commonwealth. 
One of the drawbacks of Southern education here, as everywhere, 
is the power of a noisy class of second-rate political and social leaders 
to excite and prejudice even the better sort of people to resent every 
true statement of the educational situation as another attack on the 
South and a fresh outcome of sectional misrepresentation and hostility. 
Happily, this spirit is not apparent in the superior educators in this or, 
indeed, in any portion of the Seuth. Nowhere have we found this 
class, including a large proportion of the clergy of all denominations, 
more thoroughly sensible of the gravity of this demand and more 
strenuous in their efforts to supply the crying need. But the South, 
everywhere to-day, is confronted with a peril not yet sufficiently appre- 
ciated even when most apparent. In its natural desire to protect itself 
from the great danger of the early days of reconstruction, the govern- - 
ing of great States and communities by the newly emancipated freed- 
man, the ruling class has not counted sufficiently on the more formidable 
peril of these States and cities falling into the eclipse of an indefinite 
period of rule by the great mass of illiterate and untrained people of 
their own race, under a leadership often more reckless and not half so 
enlightened as the far-famed “ carpet-bagger” of bygone days. For the 
present, it seems that all these States, even the oldest and most cele- 
brated, will be in the hands of this rising “third estate,” less in touch 
with the higher American civilization than any similar bedy of American- 
born people in the Union. All that has yet been done for the uplift of 
the new South, especially for the educational advancement of its people, 
is really to a great extent the work of the old superior class, under the _ 
wise and courageous leadership of the best men and women in every 
community. It will require all the wisdom, worth, and culture of this 
portion of Southern society for more than one decade to meet this ris-- 
ing tide from beneath that, under various names, is every day gaining 
involume and power. Thisinfluenceisalready dominating in educational 
affairs. Itis already seen that large numbers of this class are not only op- 
posed to any support, even of thesecondary, much less of the higher edu- 
cation by the State, but are far more hostile to the uplift of the colored, 
folk than their old masters. Indeed, the work already done for the 
education of the negro in the State schools has been chiefly under the 
influence and direction of the people that knew him best and, by all 
odds to-day, are his most valued friends. The alarming outbreak of 
lawlessness that is now exciting the whole country and is nowhere 
more dreaded and feared than by the best people of the communities 
where it appears, is but another outcome of this upheaval from below. 
Nowhere is this danger so threatening as in many of these new towns 
and industrial centers of the entire highland and valley regions of the | 
old central South. I find numbers of these towns thronged with fam- 
ilies drifted in from the remote country, drawn thither from the lower 
strata of the new foreign immigration, often the vilest refuse of the 
vagrant negro population. These people come with a houseful of chil-

dren, needing all that the home, the church, and the school can do 
for their training into respectable citizenship. The home is too often 
the weakest of all these forces, either through sheer poverty or the 
mental and moral incapacity of the parents. The church and clergy 
are waking up and vigorously working the ordinary church methods 
of the periodical revival, the Sunday school, Young Men’s Christian 
Association and temperance movements, with other schemes of useful 
reformation. But the clergy are terribly overworked through all this 
portion of the country. Many of them are compelled to minister in 
several places, often miles apart, reached during the winter in the 
laborious southern way through a battle with mud, bad roads and 
changeful weather, especially kept going as constantly as the country 
doctor by the demands of a parish work that includes miles of a wide 
country side. The most effective method of dealing with this youthful 
erowd is by a good school established in every locality, rural and vil- 
lage, taught by a worthy, intelligent man or woman, who will be more 
than the ordinary pedagogue, the “ guide, philosopher, and friend” of 
the little people; at once training the head, the heart, and the hand, 
and holding up before these young Americans the knowledge of the 
great opportunity that in a near future lies just outside the school- 
house door. 
But here is, just now, the most critical feature of the situation. . We 
found scarcely a village in this entire district where the educational 
arrangements were in any reasonable way adequate to the emergency. In 
several important places the public school hardly existed, or was in a con- 
dition so nearly useless that it was painfully unfit for even the elementary 
schooling of the small number who were found in it. We doubt if in 
any place visited two-thirds of the children between 6 and 12 were in 
regular attendance in any school of any value. The boys on whom 
these communities must rely for their male citizenship are drifting out 
of school at the age of 12, seldom better occupied outside than: inside 
even the poor arrangement for education on the ground. While sev- 
eral of these villages were getting new and improved school buildings, 
I found but one where the people seemed to recognize the necessity 
for a well-organized graded school system under competent superin- 
tendency, in the hands of fit teachers sufficient for the growing popu- 
lation during a session long enough to be of real service. 
Tn the open country I could not hear of any especial progress adequate 
to the great need of the people. Schoolhouses too often unfit for occu- 
pation; teachers working at from $20 to $30 per month for what is 
called a term of five months in the year; county superintendents paid 
so little that itis almost impossible to entice an expert into the work, and, 
added to these disabilities, the interference of local and State polities, 
often sectarian, religious, and social jealousies. We found the people 
whose influence and codperation is necessary to hold up an effective sys- 
tem of popular education generally incredulous, almost despairing of the 
possibilities of sustaining a school system adequate to the advancing 
needs of the population. In the present condition of affairs the superior 
families in the country districts are anxiously looking about for some 
way to educate their children, leaving the farms for the villages, send- 
ing off their boys and girls at a tender age to distant schools, too often 
not able to avail themselves of the opportunities of the academical 
institutions which are scattered up and dowh the region. In almost 
every village the establishment of new colleges or private schools for 
instruction of the better-off pupils leaves this influential portion of the 
community antagonistic or indifferent to the fate of the common school,

where two-thirds of the children must be educated, if at all. In short, 
all the difficulties against which Dr. Ruffner and the early superintend- 
ents of education so bravely struggled are here, still on the ground, 
somewhat overcome by the experience of the past twenty years, but 
still a mighty obstacle. And the important fact is that while the 
industrial life of this great realm has shot ahead so marvelously during 
the past ten years, and the promise of a new future is brightening the 
sky, the educational public outside a few institutions and localities 
does not seem to have really sensed the situation, but is going on at 
the gradual pace that would have been helpful in the days that are 
past, but which is altogether behind the imperious demands of the 
present time. 
Of course, the suggestions of a stranger are never quite welcome, 
even if he is able to see the point of difficulty. But, in this essay, I 
do not offer theories, or make comparisons, or endeavor to place the 
responsibility for past or present conditions. I simply put on paper 
what is the talk of every superior schoo] man or woman, every wise 
clergyman, every thoughtful public man, every man of affairs who sees 
what is coming to this favored region; especially of every good woman 
who, from the home and social mount of observation, is prospecting 
the status of her neighborhood in the swift-coming years. If there is 
anything of value in the suggestions of this essay, the writer only 
claims the merit and assumes the responsibility of putting on paper in 
reasonable shape what is the common report of the superior educa- . 
tional public which is still expected to put on the ground thesé great 
agencies of civilization. And the encouragement of the work is that, 
in every community, there are decided indications that the present con- 
dition is a state of transition, and this important portion of the coun- 
try is not now and will be less and less content with the present oppor- 
tunities as the years go on. 
In contrast with a new State like Texas, an old commonwealth like 
Virginia, with an influential cultured class, chiefly trained by the edu- 
cational methods of a generation ago, encounters serious difficulties in 
putting on the ground an effective system of schools for the masses. 
The people who need it most are often least awake to its necessities. 
The educated portion of the community, always the minority, finding 
the progress so slow and deeply anxious for the schooling of their own 
children, can not await the tardy development of the common schools, 
but look to established institutions or extemporized private arrange- 
ments to do the imperative work. 
Until 1870, southwest Virginia, with what is now West Virginia, ~ 
seemed reasonably content with the old-time Southern system—essen- 
tially the British system of half a century ago—a scheme of colleges 
and academies for such as could afford their expense and aspire to their 
training, and the field school or poor school of the past, with a wide- 
spread illiteracy that was never reported in statistical tables and only 
known to the class of progressive educators on the ground. The result 
is that there are now, in southwestern Virginia, a supply of colleges 
and academies with college names more than sufficient for all the rea- 
sonable demands of the genuine secondary and higher educational train- - 
ing of the country for the next twenty years. The old drift of students 
to the Virginia schools from the far Southwest is becoming sensibly less 
every year, because these States no longer are obliged to go northward, 
but find their new school systems every year more satisfactory. There 
is no educational reason why Louisiana should send her superior boys - 
and girls beyond Tulane University and its annex, the Sophie Newcomb

  910 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
College, it being in all matters of organization, present efficiency, and a 
rational expectation for the future, the equal of any institution for the 
_ best discipline and instruction of a Scuthwestern student. Texas is 
becoming a land of good graded village, improving academical, excel- 
Jent normal, and promising State university schooling. The nearer 
States are alive with the development of this class of institutions. It 
would therefore seem useless to build up collegiate or academical seats 
of learning beyond the present immediate necessities of the home pop- 
ulation, especially in this portien of Virginia, where the demand is for 
the popular schooling of the masses and a broader education of the 
secondary and higher departments. 
There are now in this portion of Virginia three collegiate foundations 
for boys, which, properly supported, generously endowed, and handled 
in the spirit of the advancing college and university life of the time, 
will be ample for the home schooling of these twenty-five counties 
‘for years to come—the State Agricultural and Mechanical College at 
Blacksburg; Roanoke College, at Salem, and Emory and Henry Col- 
lege, at Emory. Each of these is now in excellent condition, as far as 
a competent faculty, adequate currieulum, and arrangements for the 
thorough schooling of its students are concerned, to doa great work, 
adapted especially to the needs of the district. With extensive knowl- 
edge of similar institutions in every Southern State, I am sure that 
under its present management, no one of them is ready to do better 
than the State Agricultural and Mechanical College at Blacksburg. If 
the farmers of the most attractive agricultural country awaiting a 
broader development in the Union will heartily stand by this institu- 
tion and the railroad and manufacturing interests will codperate with 
the State in giving to it the helping hand and aid in the organization 
of a thorough system of industrial training through the entire coun- 
try, there will be no educational opportunity more to be envied than 
‘ig open to this in a future near at hand. Roanoke College, at Salem, 
through the activity of its enthusiastic and far-sighted young presi- 
dent, is already known in some of the great centers of educational activ- 
ity in the North. Boston could do nothing better than supply it with 
the endowment to educate hundreds of the sort of vigorous and am- 
pitious young men that are now under instruction. Emory and Henry, 
in situation and sufficiency of buildings, is ready to welcome 500 stu- 
dents and renew itsyouth. Its crying need, like the majority of South- 
_ ern colleges, is money to enable it to work its machinery and hold on 
to the class of capable young professors that can be had for the proper 
support in all these States. 
All these institutions have adopted the elective curriculum and are in 
essential respects in vital sympathy with the best tendency of the uni- 
versity and college life of the day. It would be a gracious thing, and 
no less just than generous, if the men of wealth who have gone out 
from southwestern Virginia during the past twenty-five years and now ° 
are found among the crowd of millionaires in several of the northern 
and western cities, would “remember the rock out of which they were 
hewn” and repeat the work so splendidly done by a similar class of 
prosperous men in the New England and Northern States, whereby 
- almost every worthy college from Boston to San Francisco has been 
generously endowed and magnificent new foundations laid since the 
close of the civil war. Here, as in northern Alabama and other por- 
tions of the South, we are glad to take note of the far-sighted gen- 
erosity of some of the railroad, land, and manufacturing companies 
recently established, in giving sites for schoolhouses and churches; con- 
   
-P-A-G-E-263
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN virGiIntA. 911 
tributing, sometimes generously, and in some cases actually building 
schoolhouses and supporting free schools for operatives and workmen. 
A great deal more of this sort of work could be done in southwestern 
Virginia by these great wealthy corporations which to-day almost 
hold this splendid country in the holbow of their hands; done, not only 
to their own pecuniary advantage, but, what is of far more importance, 
to the uplifting of the masses of the people, on which all the highest _ 
success of their own investment will depend. There is an admirable ~ 
foundation already laid through the great service of President Cocke, 
of Hollins Institute, in a near suburb of the new city of Roanoke, for 
awoman’s college of the type of Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, 
in a beautiful and healthful region, with ample buildings for a great 
beginning, at the headquarters of the new development of southwest- 
ern Virginia. An investment of a million would place here a great 
school of the higher type and perpetuate the well-earned reputation of 
this well known institute, for the past forty years one of the most nota- 
ble of Southern schools. 
Of the secondary schools for girls the same can be said as concerning 
the colleges for boys. There are more than enough in number to sup- 
ply the actual need of this region for a generation to come. Under the 
various titles, College, Institute, Seminary, they all, with the usual 
variations of good, indifferent, and poor, areof the samesort; all schools 
for the secondary education, compelled by circumstances to assume, on 
the one hand, something of the higher and, oftener, of the elementary 
training of their pupils. : 
The radical infirmity of the Southern educational situation is the weak- 
ness of itselementary department. In the vast open country and in the 
majority of little hamlets that hardly rank as villages, both the public 
and private schools for children under the age of 15 are oftener than 
otherwise of the sort that nobody is satisfied with save their teachers 
and their “kinfolk and acquaintance.” The result-is that when the 
girl whose parents are able to meet the cost, and, more and more, even 
the daughter of the humbler family, assisted by some friend or church 
or the kindness of her teachers, reaches the verge of American young 
Jadyhood, she is filled with the desire for a better education and goes 
with the increasing throng that crowds the private secondary school to 
repletion, sometimes even to the peril of health. The school, even of 
average worth, generally has one or more superior teachers and oftenis 
able to give a thorough training in its curriculum, including music and 
boarding-school art. But here comes.in the drawbeck. The majority 
of these pupils are neither by habits of study, mode of life, or elemen- 
tary knowledge, in any fit condition to enter upon a genuine course of 
the secondary education. Time is flying; young womanhood, with all 
the bewitchment of the genial social life of the southland and the be- 
wildering mirage of early marriage, is waiting outside the schoolhouse 
door. ‘To go back to the proper work of childhood and learn honestly 
and well the few things indispensible to scholarship, culture, and true 
refinement seems a moral impossibility. Tolaunch forth on the untried 
ocean of the higher branches, music and art, has at least the attraction 
of novelty. The latter is the ordinary conclusion. Spite of the mis- 
givings of their teachers, the situation is what it is and the crowded 
curriculum, including Latin, is adventured upon and buffetted with like 
a strong or faint swimmer fighting an Atlantic surf. A portion of the 
managers of these schools are seriously trying to shorten the course, 
leave out superfluities, and give these pupils a moderate task, with the 
hope of better results. But here come in the ignorance and ambition of 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  912 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
parents, who insist on having the worth of their money in all the lux- 
uries of the great modern feast of knowledge. The intense rivalry be- 
tween the denominational seminaries, in which the spirit of an ardent 
sectarian propagandism blends with the natural desire for success, and 
the absolute necessity of numbers to the existence of the institution, 
make it very difficult to introduce any reform in the direction of thor- 
oughness and limitation ofstudies. The few superior girls whose health 
is adequate to the tremendous toil imposed by such an undertaking, 
often amid an environment so unfavorable, come out with honor and 
frequently complete their studies at schools of higher grade in better 
condition to do valuable work. The larger crowd of social, faint-hearted, 
or frivolous girls: get on in their own way and graduate ‘into the class 
of women who perpetuate the defects of this type of seminary by 
enthusiastically pushing their own daughters into the same condition 
of affairs. 
It can not be truly said that the teachers of the institutions are 
chiefly responsible for this state of affairs. Indeed the quality of their 
teachers is steadily improving and no school of any mark is wanting 
in one or several who come from the highest seminaries with well de- 
served commendation. But the one thing that no teacher can do is to 
reconstruct, in one or two years, the dishéveled mind of a girl, until 
15 “fussed with” in the regulation private village or in the ordinary 
common country school.. The problem is, on the one hand, to build 
from the foundation the scholarly mind, or at least to form some honest 
and effective habits of study and, on the other, to feed to this pupil as 
much of the rich food of the abundant bill of fare as can be digested. 
Nobody so well knows the difficulties of the situation as the superior 
instructors of this class of female colleges, and our sketch of their 
trials will be recognized with painful assent. 
A way out of this everglade of female education of the secondary 
sort, from which no part of our country is exempt, is already being 
found on more than one side. One excellent reform is inaugurated by 
the courageous body of teachers who resolutely set their faces against 
the old British fetich of everlasting Latin. No competent. educator 
questions the great value of classical education, when it is both classi- 
cal and educational. But the earricature of classicism that the ordi- 
nary grind of boarding-school Latin for boys and girls becomes de- 
serves all the disparagement visited-upon it even by the anti-classic 
advocates of exclusively scientific and industrial instruction. That a 
girl of 15, for whom there are only two or three years of remaining school 
life, with no reliable habits of study, unable to spell or cipher or write 
a page of respectable English, at sea in the history of her own coun- 
try, with no information of natural science and no acquaintance with the 
writers of her own land, to say nothing of English literature, enthused 
with the desire to take the extras of music and ] painting, should be shut 
down to the study of an ancient language which, if superficial, is of no 
worth, and, if thorough, must absorb the major part of her mental ener- 
gies, may still be accepted as truth by aclass of teachers, but isless appar- 
entevery year to thesolid Americancommonsense. Couldafewmorecour- 
ageous managers of these schools make the new departure of admit- 
ting to the exclusive course only such as by training, mental habit, and 
taste are competent and insist that the average pupil shall be honestly 
dealt with on the lines.of a solid English training, with guarded elec- 
tion of modern languages or the accomplishments, the objective point 
being to send her forth with an ardent desire for improvement and a 
habit of good reading of the best literature of her native tongue, the
-P-A-G-E-265
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 913 
work would be well begun. We found several of these schools where 
the condition of graduation is a high grade of excellence in spelling, 
elementary arithmetic, and the use ofthe mother tongue. Theseschools 
will grow with the sensible ideas of woman’s education in the country. 
There is no implied disparagement of the higher education of women 
in these strictures. But all high things in the material or spiritual 
world are based on broad and deep foundations among the common 
things of life, and the success of the higher education in college or 
academy depends, for boys and girls, on this laying of the corner stone 
and broadening and strengthening the base. Here is the tragedy of 
college life for boys; compelling all these institutions either to support 
an expensive preparatory department or to work in the upper story 
with material so unfit that the best professors are discouraged and can 
only be held by the missionary spirit from accepting the constant in- 
vitation to “go up higher.” 
Another method of dealing with this embarrassment is the establish- 
ment of a genuine department of pedagogy in every school of the sort, 
with an elementary department, managed at once as a school of the 
best type for children and a model for the observation of young teach- 
ers, by the principal of the entire department. There are in the South 
a great number of admirable women, whose presence in this capacity. 
would put a new soul into many a dull and dreary college for girls. 
This arrangement would offer to a family desirous of giving a full 
course of instruction to their girls the opportunity of beginning the 
work in season. It would supply the higher departments of the insti- 
tution with a central corps of trained pupils in every grade, well taught, 
all the way up. It would be an inspiration to a large class of grown 
girls, sadly needing the training of children, to go back to this enticing 
occupation, which makes the observation of the natural methods of 
instruction, even the participation in this beautiful work, the greatest 
pleasure for the most cultivated minds. It would give an impulse to 
the whole range of nature studies and change the often senseless work 
of the art and music department, by laying the foundations of both in 
the thorough instruction of children, according to the methods so 
effectual in the best graded schools; only in this way can the public 
school system of the open country be supplied with teachers compe- 
. tent to lift them out of the present slough of inefficiency, because these 
graduates would be able to work for such compensation as the people 
can afford, and thoroughly interested in the uplift of childhood and 
youth in their own communities. In this and similar directions can 
these schools be steadily improved, until they become genuine semi- 
naries of the secondary education, which is all the vast majority even 
of the better sort of young women anywhere are able to obtain. 
It will be a blessed day for education in Virginia when the old-time 
contempt for the common school is dispelled, both by the improvement 
of the common school itself and a broader and more philosophic idea of 
education and its relation to American society. At present, the per- 
petual sprouting of new private and denominational schools, with high 
sounding names, for the gathering together of the daughters and sons 
of the more favored families, is one of the serious hindrances to the fit 
schooling of the people, and works for the perpetuation of the reign of 
superficiality. Few of these schools can secure the teaching force nec- 
essary to the successful schooling of their pupils, while they absorb the 
money and interest of the class that is most needed to build up an effect- 
ive system for the community. It would be a great step forward if 
the trustees of half these little seminaries, now starving under denomi- 
ED 91——58 
   
-P-A-G-E-266
    914 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
national auspices, could place their properties in the hands of the com- 
mon school board, at least for the elementary departments; if necessary, 
retaining the secondary as a high school, with tuition, In this way 
“the first step that eosts, ” the housing a graded school in suitable build- 
ings, could be taken. Many of these village academies have large build- 
ings.and ample grounds which, with proper repairs and ornamentation, 
would be sufficient for the public use for a generation, leaving the people 
to apply the school funds to the proper work of instruction. This has 
been done largely in New England, and is socommon in the South that 
we often feel impatient at seeing the educational business of the smaller 
‘towns in a deadlock, from the obstinacy of boards of trustees, or some- 
times of only individualowners of these properties, which were often con- 
tributed by the people for general education in the earlier days. “With 
this clearing of the ground many a town could afford the establishment 
of a.good high school department, on the shoulders of the graded school 
of the better sort, enabling the people to keep their children at home 
until the final necessity for their going abroad. 
‘Then the great schools now being founded through this region, includ- 
ing those of established reputation, could have some reasonable hope of 
fit endowment and, with increasing numbers, could rise to:a fair com- 
parison with similar institutions in-other parts of the country. There 
are half a dozen of these schools of the superior sort, so-good and under 
an administration so wise and progressive, that we long to see them 
recognized and put in a condition where the hand-to-mouth support on 
which they now live will be overcome and their managers be able ‘to 
inaugurate the reforms nearest their hearts. 
The idea of a free high school in each county, supplementing the 
country district school, is destined to materialize in some localities in 
the not distant future. Until the Southern people, far more than at 
present, live in cities or large villages, this would bean admirable and 
practicable provision for the schooling of many who can not afford even 
the moderate expense of the academies now on the ground. Such a 
school might combine instruction in the higher branches with normal 
and industrial training for both sexes and, if coeducational, would go 
far to: convert'the Southern people to this feature of modern educational 
progress. At present, the average private school for boys, in this sec- 
tion, suffers a:prodigious drawback in the frequent lack of discipline, 
good order, neatness, and all the higher conditions of school life, not 
only from its obstinate isolation of sex, but-often from the peculiarities 
of an old-time habit of general shiftlessness that makes school life itself 
. a demoralizing occupation. The schools of the academical sort for boys 
in southwestern Virginia are few in number and, generally, of inferior 
quality to the seminaries for girls. This is probably due to the fact 
that the number of girls in secondary schools is already much larger 
than of the boys, and the disparity is yearly increasing. The Southern 
boy generally concludes to go to college or ‘to leave school before the 
age of 14. In the former case he goes toa college with a preparatory 
school: department, leaving the ordinary intermediate schools. Outside 
these, we find a few seminaries for boys of high grade, for special prepa- 
ration for the universities; although sometimes these are of the old-time 
type, out-of elbow touch with the best in the education of the commu- 
nities in;which they abide. The coeducational graded public school is 
now the most vital element in the educational life of the South, when 
it is properly organized, placed:above the reach of political, sectarian, 
or social interference, and put into the hands of a competent superin-- 
tendent “with power to act.”  
-P-A-G-E-267
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 915 
But the root of the matter must be found in a great revival of the 
common school interest in city, village, and open country. Here is the 
original clearing of the forest of illiteracy in the draining of the slough 
of ignorance, superstition, shiftlessness, vulgarity, and vice, without 
which the secondary and higher education in a country like owrs can 
only result in an occasional success; even a majority of its own students 
fatally handicapped by a neglect of the foundations in early childhood 
and youth. It is not necessary to emphasize the unsatisfactory condi- 
_tion, in this region, even of the village schools for the people, much less 
to insist on the failure of the average country school to give the neces- 
sary training for the American citizenship of the present day. Our 
people, everywhere, must shake off the pleasing delusion that things 
are now as they were halfa century ago, when there were no great 
cities, even in themost populous States, and the rude boys came up to 
town in various conditions of ignorance of letters, with no special train- 
ing, from the remote rural districts, and by a sharp fight for success, 
in half a lifetime seeured wealth and consideration in communities made 
up of people of the same sort as themselves. But to-day a young man, 
with a corresponding lack of preparation, finds himself in Roanoke, 
Bristol, Radford, face to face with half'a dozen bright fellows, trained 
in the best schools for any and every service for commerce, manufac- 
tures, or mechanics; and straightway “moves on” to a crude cultiva-- 
tion out on some borderland, or becomes discouraged and “ gives him- 
self away” to the crowd of worthless and reckless youth that haunt 
these places and make life hideous to every well-intentioned man. The 
only condition of meeting the requirements even of a progressive agri- 
culture is the solid foundation of the education in the elements that 
could be well given in a good country district school, properly housed, 
with a competent teacher and moderate library and session of six or 
eight months in the year. ‘There could the foundations of a fair school 
training be laid, a taste for reading and a habit of study formed, with a 
valuable training in“ good morals and gentle manners” and, above all, 
a hunger and thirst after knowledge and an elevated idea of American. 
citizenship be matured which would lead on like a guiding star, high 
in the heaven of youthful aspiration, to any possible achievement. 
We are often enough reminded that the Southern common school, 
especially for the negro, has been a failure, at best sending forth its 
graduates unfit for the life they must lead and with no fitness for that 
to which they blindly aspire; but, pray, what can be expected of such 
a life as.can be seen by a travelerin thousands of thesecommon schools— 
the schoolhouse cheerless, unwholesome, and repugnant to all ideas of 
decency; an ignorant, conceited, often vulgar and sometimes vicious - 
teacher, working on a salary below that of the waiters in the hotels of 
the neighboring villages; a mob of children, studying out loud, demor- — 
alized by the disorder and violence that invariably attend such a gath- 
ering; a third of the pupils only in oceasional, and not half in what is 
ealled “daily attendance;” working against the disgust or absolute 
neglect of the better sort, and worried by the miserable jealonsies and 
local feuds of the lower order of its patrons? Just what we do get? A 
failure that is imputed to the system itself and gives new occasion to 
ventilate the. old “wise saw” that the lower strata of humanity are 
better off in ignorance, as they are only pushed by education out of 
their sphere. Every community that tolerates an educational abortion 
of this sort is certain to meet retribution, pressed down and overflow- 
ing, in the increased barbarism of its humbler and the steady desertion 
of its better population.  
-P-A-G-E-268
  916 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
We are not insensible to the difficulties that beset many of these 
communities in the effort to maintain a competent system of schooling 
which shall at once educate the lower and at the same time reasonably 
satisfy the higher elements of its people. The financial obstacle, how- 
ever, is real or imaginary according to the spirit of the population. 
There i is no district of southwestern Virginia which does not spend on 
things unnecessary, even harmful and pernicious, twice the money 
needed to establish a satisfactory system of education. There is no 
county where the people do not waste, in haunting the courts and fee- 
ing the local lawyers, enough time and cash to build a good schoolhouse 
in every district. People have what their hearts are set upon. The 
bottom necessity is a revival of the educational spirit through the length 
and breadth of this beautiful country, until, instead of brooding down 
among the hollows, the people shall lift their eyes to the uplands of a 
noble | pride in State, country, and humanity, which will be content with 
nothing less than their full share of the great American heritage for 
every boy and girl in every sphere of life. This once awakened, the 
same spirit that drove the young men from their homes a generation 
ago to fight in a cause they held to be just and true, with a bravery 
and endurance that won the admiration of the world, will marshal their 
sons.and daughters to-day ina grander war against the illiteracy which 
is the one American peril to all the true patriot and Christian holds 
dear. This done, ways and means will be found to build and furnish 
the schoolhouse; to find the good teacher, even if hunted for with a 
lighted pine knot; to watch the going on of the school with more jealous 
care than the political campaign; to make it the fundamental business 
and the most exhilarating recreation of every neighborhood to encour- 
age the little ones in their wrestling with the daily trials, humiliations, 
and sorrows of life in the country district school. 
But where shall be found the “evangelist” to wake up the people and 
hold them at the concert pitch of obstinate determination to secure for 
the children and youth this precious boon of education? Certainly not 
largely in the present system of county supervision, which by common 
consent has become one of the chief obstacles to the success of the 
common schools. There would seem to be no reasonable expectation 
that the State or the county can at present offer the salary to entice an 
educational expert to this work, or even to obtain from a competent 
man anything but the most perfunctory service. Real supervision is 
the backbone of every educational system. The best college or second- 
ary school depends upon it, in the president or principal chosen espe- 
cially for this business. What would become of any superior school if 
the teacher of each class and room was left to carry on his work at his 
own sweet will, like the only teacher in the average common school? 
We are not unmindful of the self. sacrificing service of a noble band of 
these superintendents, whose works praise them in the valleys and on 
the hillsides of more than one region blessed by their missionary zeal. 
But millionaires and martyrs do not march in regiments, even in such 
notable centers of moral and religious life as some of these towns are 
declared to be by their enthusiastic secular “boomers.” The ordinary 
public man rarely does more than he is paid to do, whatever the people 
who “pay the shot” expect of him, The work in the ordinary office of 
superintendency of schools is largely the performance of a clerk, a per- 
functory examination of candidates for teachers’ certificates, a semi- 
occasional hasty visit to the schoolhouse of his beat, a bland com- 
pliance with the humors of influential people, and an eloquent laudation 
of the educational state of the county on the stump or in the report to  
-P-A-G-E-269
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 917 
headquarters in the office of his chief. All this when the election or 
appointment of this class of officials is carried on with the best inten- 
tions. But when this choice is burdened with the whims of a personal 
or political interest, or entangled in any one of the score of methods 
that are the dry rot of public life, the result is what we see, in the de- 
feat of all the advantages real supervision is believed to offer. 
We believe that, in place of this fooling with a good thing, a system of 
district superintendence by experts chosen in the best way to assure the - 
bestresults, paid enough to secure the entire success of trained officials, 
could be sustained with profit. When the bishop of areligious body comes 
around, the people crowd the church, the clergy hang upon his presence 
and take heart from his words of hope, caution, and good cheer; the 
women come out in their best, the children rejoice, and the day becomes 
a festival remembered for a year. A fit man or woman, recognized as 
". fit, will do more to wake up a community even by a letter, like an epistle 
of St. Paul, than a common man drifting in and out every day of the 
year. The people recognize their genuine rulers and do not fail to give 
honor where honor is due. The State of Massachusetts, which does 
most for education according to its population of any State, and which 
from the first has done more for education than any American com- 
monwealth and is not behind the present in its care for the children, 
supervises its schools by a secretary of the board of education and a 
corps of half a dozen trained assistants. But the superintendent is 
not a politician “on the make” for a higher place, and each gentleman 
of the board is a man of national reputation, always on his beat, drop- 
ping into the humblest little country school, encouraging and instruct- 
ing the teacher, stirring up the country people, gathering the school 
committees of the towns into associations, conducting institutes, “work- 
ing like a horse” all the year round. What is to hinder a State of less 
population than Massachusetts from concentrating her insufficient little 
salaries of county superintendents into a State fund to keep in the 
field a corps of trained experts of the best men and women of the Com- 
monwealth, to visit the cities and revive the towns, break up the fallow 
ground and plant trees of life by the side of every stream and great 
forests on every mountain side? Nothing but the obstinate prejudice 
that always keeps on the ground any dead-alive system of “how not 
to do it,” with the little teasing ambition of people to hold a little useless 
office, that is the curse of our American civilization. A great man will yet 
be found—he may be even now on his way—who will waken the people 
of this fair country of the Southwest so they will send up to the capi- 
tal a body of Representatives.that will demand a reconstruction of the _ 
  present inefficient method of handling the schools of the country— 
handling and manipulating until the children seem to have only the 
crumbs that fall under the tables, that the dogs doeat. The enterpris- 
ing State of Texas has found a way to success in the bringing forward 
of the ablest women for the most important office of supervision of 
schools. The great West found out years ago that the male sex is not 
an indispensable condition of fitness for superior school work in all de- 
partments of educational activity. Virginia has “noble women nota 
few” who are fully competent for this work of supervision, and who, if 
sent forth on this message of love to the children, would bring forth the 
response that always comes from a true Southern community to any- 
. thing brave and efficient done by the humblest girl. 
A few years ago, at a convention of the teachers of the State of New 
York, a resolution was passed, urging that, at least, one address on 
the subject of popular education should be given in every school 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
  918 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
district of the State during the coming year. Whether 12,600 orators 
responded we are not informed, but certainly nothing would better 
relieve the deadness and torpor of the southern winter on these great 
hills and in the broad valleys like a widespread organization of com- 
mon schooi associations, holding frequent meetings in the churches 
and schoolhouses of every district, in behalf of the children and youth, 
The clergy would be foremost in this good work; as the ministers of 
New Hngland, in the old time, were the guardians and strong friends 
of the little country schools-and lyceums, out of which grew the public 
library, the lecture system, and the reading and thinking habits of the 
people. We are told that eloquence is on the decline. Perhaps it is 
true that the people are coming to demand facts and practical instruc- 
tion in place ef clerical highflying and supernatural vaticination in the 
pulpit, and are so worn out with “the thunder of stump speaking that 
they prefer the fireside or the shade tree, with a respectable news- 
paper, to the great speech of the regulation campaign orator. But 
surely if there ‘be a cause in which the dumb could speak, the silent 
fathers and mothers grow eloquent, the aspiring young man be lifted 
to enthusiasm and the maidens break forth into song, it would seem to 
be the uplift of 50,000 children and youth to welcome the coming dawn 
of such a destiny’ as will change the fate of the Old Dominion. For 
here it is not the rising up of another group of famous men to catch 
the eye of the nations; but the drill of a generation of American boys 
and girls for the labors and discipline of a citizenship which makes 
every man a sovereign and every woman “the power behind the 
throne.” Such a revival would result in the awakening of the people 
to the fact that only by local taxation and local supervision of schools 
ean there be any permanent success. Thirty years ago, great armies 
in the southland fought to the death to testify to the rights of the 
. State as opposed to the concentration of power in the central govern- 
ment. What-were the use of all this blood and sacrifice of men if, in 
her most vital interest, she must fall back upon a halting and capri- 
cious legislature to originate every movement for the betterment of 
our schools? Rather should every city or district be empowered, under 
fit conditions and in suitable localities, to tax itself to the uttermost ~ 
for the bottom interests of the State. The ery of the average politician 
is still the old chestnut, that “taxation is tyranny,” whereas taxation, 
wisely and yigorously imposed, is the lifeblood of republican. civiliza- 
tion; taking out of one poeket to put into another the money that 
brings to the children the precious instruction and discipline without 
which democracy becomes a byword anda government of the people 
and by the people only means anarchy and down-rushing destruction. 
We are glad to see that in several of these new villages, where the 
bulk of the negro population of this part of Virginia is found, a fair 
arrangement is made for the children of this race. There is a special 
call for this, as for another great crowd of children who flock to these 
towns that are springing up like a gourd in thenight. If nothing else 
is done, this class of the population must be taken in hand and lifted, 
by the combined effort of school, church, and the awakened interest in 
social reform, to a sense of their position and duty in a civilized coun- 
try. Everyone of these new mining towns or cities, with a people 
gathered from the ends of the earth, is a magazine of untried barbar- 
ous fo ees which, unless controlled: especially by the fit education of 
the rising generation, will make it a citadel planted against the peace 
and honor of the Commonwealth. 
We believe that one more great school for the training of colored  
-P-A-G-E-271
  
  EDUCATION IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. 919 
youth, like the Hampton Institute, could well be established at Bris- 
tol, already becoming a commanding center of educational interest. 
Here could be trained the teachers and clergy especially fit for the 
peculiar service among these people, as we see them in these villages 
and mining camps, and here could be organized the forces that would - 
lift up the race to good’ American citizenship and Christian brother- 
hood. ; 
It goes without saying that industrial education is bound to become 
a vital element in the school system of this portion of Virginia. At 
present the vast majority of the people of southwestern Virginia are 
workers in the ordinary methods of farming, inured to hardship, de- 
pending on daily toil to support life. To the southwestern farmer itis ~ 
not a sermon on the dignity of labor or a pitchfork behind his waist- 
band to propel him to his work, that is the crying need of the time. It 
is rather the better education of his boys and girls, the awakening and 
direction of vital force and a new ambition that will devise improved 
ways of tilling the earth, rotating and diversifying crops; opening the 
mind to that scientific agriculiure which makes the land “a laboratory 
rather than a mine,” making this fair realm blossom like the rose; and. 
the exaltation of the family by the training in a style of home-making 
which demands the best culture and honors the most refined woman- 
hood. This can possibly be best achieved through the organization of 
farmers’ associations, where the men and women of the country may 
come together at stated times, discuss methods and exhibit results, and 
make common stock of the superior ways of doingcommon work. We 
urge again thecheerful support of the State Agricultural and Mechanical 
College, under its present organization, as the center of the movement 
for an improved agriculture. The crowning advantage of southwest- 
ern Virginia, as of Pennsylvania and Ohio, is, that under fit cultiva- 
tion the country can produce all that the largest: population drawn to 
it by the development of mining and manufactures could demand for 
its support. If the farmers’ sons and daughters will take heed to this 
and prepare themselves for the coming demand, there will be little need 
of seeking the northland of the cyclone and blizzard, or the southland 
of the flood and malaria, for the most complete success in the primal 
profession of the tilling of the soil. : 
There will be a great call for a trained class of mechanies and skilled 
operatives, of all sorts required ina mining and manufacturing region, 
within a few years, in southwestern Virginia. The depression of the 
collapse of the real estate speculation will pass away and the people, 
here as elsewhere, will learn, that it is not by selling your old farm ‘to 
your neighbor, taking pay in his own broad acres, with absurd overes- 
timated value, that builds up the material prosperity of a State. This 
portion of Virginia, like all others, must depend for its prosperity upon 
the value and-enterprise of the greatindustrial establishments that are 
now making their homes in its valleys and penetrating its hillsides. A 
great school of technology at Roanoke would seem to be a necess 
Working in connection with the State, it might be an outlying annex 
of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, planted where the object 
lesson of a new manufacturing and railroad city would always be avyail- 
able to the students. There would seem to be no reason why the great 
success of the Tulane University at New Orleans should not here be 
repeated; the organization of a broad educational course of study, 
supplementing the classical and literary training, which would do much 
for the refreshing of the regulation higher and secondary education. 
Many of these academies for girls could with great profit introduce a 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
  920 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
department of skilled housekeeping, which would send the pupils 
home with a knowledge of enlightened and refined housework, over- 
coming the silly pride of laziness and elevating home-making to the 
place it deserves; the finest of all the fine arts and the most practical 
end of religion. aA general shaking up of the old-time erude literary 
curriculum, flanked by a course of music and art, even at the risk of 
flying in the face of tradition, would be a helpful experiment. Now 
that the University of Virginia has called a graduate of the Miller 
Manual Labor School to a position in connection with its board of in- 
struction and the Agricultural and Mechanical College hag received 
several excellent young professors from this admirable school, it would 
seem that this portion of Virginia, beyond all others, could profit by 
such a revival of industrial education. If a dozen great millionaires 
could be visited. on their beds at night by the ghost of Father Miller, 
and good Dr. Vawter could enforce the solemn ‘warning by a flank 
movement, like that of his old commander, Stonewall Jackson, on this 
vast mountain region, a dozen great schools, like this superb university 
of all work, might link together this glorious land of mountain and 
valley by a chain of industrial Edens, waking up its 2,000,000 people 
to their true destiny as members of a republic whose crown of glory is 
the exaltation of the poor and lowly to the uplands of an intelligent, 
moral, industrious and patriotic citizenship. 
But all these good things, seen in vision by the hopeful educator, may 
fail in the realization that gives them a foundation on the solid earth. 
Yet it is as true to-day in southwest Virginia as in Palestine, ‘““ Where 
there is no vision the people perish.” And equally true is it that we 
are now living in the full light of the prophetic day when “the young 
men shall see visions.” For, after all, even in the most progressive 
American Commonwealth it is upon the young men and women that 
we must rely for the agitation which wakes up the people to a great 
spiritual need and the courage and persistence that insists that “ Old 
things shall pass away and all things shall become new.” 
‘And here is the new dominion of Virginia especially the favored land, 
even among the proudest of its sisterhood of States, in its coming gen- 
eration of young women, While the boys are thronging the great cit- 
ies of the Northeast and the new West, pushing towards the front 
wherever there is good work to be done, the girls are left behind. As 
in New England halfa century ago in every town and village was 
found a crowd of aspiring young women, studying in the best schools, 
getting into communication with the great centers of culture and re- 
fined society and skilled industry, until the present year sees their 
daughters in possession of 350 ways of getting a respectable living, 
scattered all along from “away down East” to Alaska, up to every 
good American word and work; so do we behold the same inspiring 
spectacle in the State of Mary and Martha Washington. In our edu- 
cational visitations up and down the State we are always in sight of a 
group of splendid girls, not a whit behind any former generation in all 
that has made the young Virginia woman the toast of a dozen genera- 
tions, but with a new inspiration and mighty hope overlooking and out- 
reaching longing for a life beyond the uttermost possibilities of the 
older time. It is no lack of loyalty to the past, no scorning of the 
sacred memories of the mothers and grandmothers, that is making the 
name and opportunities of the new American womanhood so precious 
to many of these gracious daughters of the old Commonwealth. Their 
reverent love for the life that has forever past is the best assurance 
that the rising admiration for the new life that beckons from the hori-

zon will be faithful and true; implacable as the roots of their moun- 
tains; tender.as the blue grass that drapes their slopes and nestles in 
their shy and shadowed coves. To them, more than to all others, is 
given the inauguration of the era of resurrection for this southwest 
Virginia that, even to the stranger first coming within her gates, ap- 
pears like what the old knights of the Golden Horseshoe named it— 
God’s country—awaiting the providential call to rise up and become 
the promised land of the new dominion. First let the women of Vir- 
ginia demand the establishment of a genuine woman’s university where — 
“the daugliters, by the aid of the State, can share in the opportunity 
enjoyed by her sons for the pastseventy years. This achieved, all good 
things will follow in their turn. Prophecies are delayed and dreams are 
forgotten, but predictions inspired by what may be seen by him who 
hath eyes to see and heard by him who hath ears to hear in the south- 
west Virginia of to-day are only the pledges of Providence to be re- 
deemed in God’s own good time.

REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 
By Rey. SHELDON JACKSON, General Agent.of Education for Alaska. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1891. 
Sir: In compliance with the requirements of the office I have the honor of sub- 
mitting the following annual report of the general agent of education, for the year 
ending June 30, 1891: 
NUMBER AND GENERAL CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS OF ALASKA. 
There isin Alaska a school population of from 8,000 to 10,000. Of these 1,847 
were enrolled in the 31 schools in operation during the year closing June 30, 1891. 
Thirteen day schools, with an enrollment of 745 pupils, were supported entirely by 
the Government at an expense of $20,639.39, and 12 contract schools, with an en- 
rollment of 1,102, were supported jointly by the Government and the missionary 
societies of the Presbyterian, Methodist, Congregational, Episcopal, Moravian, Lu- 
theran, and Roman Catholic churches. Of the-pupils in the contract schools, 810 
were day pupils and 292 industrial pupils. These latter were clothed, housed, fed, 
and tanght. 
The boys were taught shoemaking, house-building, furniture-making, coopering, 
baking, gardening, and the care of cattle; the girls were taught cooking, baking, 
washing, ironing, sewing, dressmaking, and housekeeping. 
Towards the support of these contract schools the Government contributed 
$29,360.61, and the missionary societies $74,434.29. 
UNALASKA DrsTRICT, 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
Owing to the inaccessibility of the schools in this district, only having commnni- 
cation with the outside world anda mail once a year, and the consequent difficulty 
of supervision, no public schools have been established except on the island of Unga. 
But wherever it was desired to loeate:a school arrangements were made with the 
leading missionary societies of the country to share with the Government in the 
responsibility and expense. These schools are called “contract schools.”

CONTRACT SCILOOLS. 
In the spring of 1890 I made a call! through the newspapers for volunteer teachers 
to go to the barbarous Eskimo of Arctic Alaska, which resulted in the following 
persons offering themselves: Messrs. L.M. Stevenson and P.N. Killbreath, Mr. and 
Mrs. James K. Reeve, and Misses H. L. Harwood and Martha McQuarll, of Ohio; Mr. 
and Mrs. James F. McKee, Mr. E. M. Calvin, and Miss Ella Blair, all of Pennsylvania; 
Misses Ella Dudley and Martha L. Taylor. of Missouri; Mr. and Mrs. Warren-Norton, 
of Tennessee; Rey. and Mrs. 8. H. King, of Minnesota; Mrs. Rebecca Wilklow, of Illi- 
nois; W.T.Lopp, of Indiana; H.R. Thornton, of Virginia; George Drenford, M.D., 
of District of Columbia; and Thomas H. Hang, of South Dakota. Of the above, 
Messrs. Stevenson, Lopp, and Thornton were selected. 
Point Barrow, Presbyterian; population, Eskimo; L. M. Stevenson, teacher: This 
is the northernmost school in America and, with the possible exception of Uper- 
_navik, Greenland, the most northern in the world. Mr. Stevenson arrived at his 
_ station on the 30th of July, 1890, on board a whaler. The next day I reached the 
place on board the U. S. Revenue Cutter Bear, and at once began making arrange- 
ments with Mr, Stevenson for the establishment of the school. Having been unable 
to secure transportation for the necessary buildings from San Francisco, I procured, 
through the courtesy-of Capt. M. A. Healy, commander of the Bear, the use of the 
rear room of the Government Refuge Station for the school. On the 6th of October, 
1890, Mr. Stevenson opened school with 3 pupils. By the end of the month 15 were 
in attendance, and the number continued to increase until 38 were enrolled. 
The school was begun under adverse circumstances, but a beginning had to be 
made. Five men from a stranded schooner were quartered in the room used as @ 
schoolroom, and the teacher held them subject to the rules of the school for conduct, 
and required them to set the example of order, thus using them as a means of assist- 
ance in the government of the school. None of the pupils had any knowledge of the 
English language, speaking only their native lingo, consisting of heterogeneous 
sounds, produced something after the ventriloquist method of using the vocal chord, 
the other organs of speech not being permitted to participate in the production of 
sound. Those who came to school seemed to manifest a great desire to learn, and 
the acquisition of making ‘‘paper talk” was like the entrance to fairy land. They 
made rapid progress, being able to spell and pronounce all the words on the chart 
lesson by the end of the second week. 
Nearly all the pupils, after the first day or two, manifested a strong desire to learn, 
and in this they were both patient and persevering, repeating the same word many 
times in trying to acquire a correct pronunciation. At first they were shy and 
feared to make a start, but after one or two letters were memorized, so that they 
could form ashort word, they were proud of the acquisition, and upon the snow, the 
frost, anywhere where they could make an impression, the words were traced. 
Mr. Stevenson reportsit very interesting to see their black eyes flash and their dusky

TEACHERS WANTED FOR CONTRACT SCHOOLS AMONG THE ESKIMOS OF ARCTIC ALASKA. 
An unexpected opportunity offers for the establishment of a contract mission school among the Eski- mos at Point Barrow, and also at Cape Prince of Wales. Point Barrow is the northernmost point of the mainland of the continent. Tt has a permanent population of about 600 Eskimos. Last summer the Government erected at that point arefuge station for shipwrecked whalers. During the summer there are 1,500 to 2,000 sailors of the whaling ficet in the vicinity. ‘This season 20 of these men are wintering there. Cape Prince of Wales, at Berings Strait, is the westernmost point of the mainland of the continent. It has a permanent population of about 300 Eskimos with no white men. During the summer season hundreds of the nomad Eskimos of the interior visit these points for the purposeof trade. ‘The coming of these strangers greatly increases the influence and importance of the work at the station. ‘At each of these stations it is proposed to erect a comfortable one-story frame building, containing a schoolroom in one end and a teachers’ residence in the other. ‘The schools are to be taught in English. As the people have never had schools and know no Eng- lish, the schools will, for a long time fo come, be in the primary grade. ‘There is no communication with the outside world except once a year, ships arriving and departing in midsummer. For the first year at Cape Prince of Wales it isadvisable that a male teacher go without his family. ‘At Point Barrow the teacher should be a married man without children, and can take his wife with   
im. ‘The teachers should bé of good sound health, and from 28 to 40 years of age. 
Tho teacbers should be prepared to remain at least two years. 
‘As they will need to leave home next May, prompt action will be required. The work being both 
educational and missionary, applicants will send not only certificates as to their aptness as teachers 
but also testimonials from their pastor or others as to their Christian activity. 
The rigors of the arctic winter, and the self-denial and patience required in dealing with the natives 
demands ‘a missionary spirit in the teachers. None other will succeed or be willing to remain there, 
even if sent.

countenances brighten as they learned a new word ora new combination of figures, 
They seem to pride themselves on knowing English, but manifest little desire to 
speak it, as that would be breaking off from their traditions, and their Im-ut-koots 
(doctors) would let the evil one take full possession of them for thus abandoning the 
style of former days. 
‘The attendance for the most part was very irregular, owing to the trips that had 
to be made out to the caches! where the deer were stored, and which they brought in, 
as required, for food, as well as to the catching of seals for both food and fuel. 
After the age of 4 is reached, no parent is able to tell the age of his children, and 
they are not positively certain beyond 3 years, so that the classification by ages in 
school is mere guess work. Knowledge of the past is summed up in the single word 
“T-pan-ee,” which may be yesterday or ten thousand years ago, or any indefinite 
period.

hension, and beyond the limit of 15 the best of them become confused, and cut off 
further count by a single word, Am-a-lok-tuk, which may be anything from 1 up- 
wards. he seems to mean plenty. If there is enough for the present meal it is Am- 
a-lok-tuk. 
The hindrances to the work are many. The association of the natives with white 
men have not been ennobling, but, on the contrary, debasing, the products of which 
are fornication, adultery, disease, and death. Another hindrance is the lack of 
livelihood. The natives are under the necessity of hunting and whaling, and these 
two occupations keep them busy nearly the entire year, and away from the village 
the greater part of the time, sometimes scattered many miles over the country hunt- 
ing and fishing, or over the ice catching seals, whales, bears, and walrus. The 
deer furnishes food and clothing, the walrus boot soles and skins for canoes, the seal 
food, flour, and clothing, the whale food, flour, and bone for trade. 
The coldest weather reported was 494° below zero. The long, dark (for the night 
extends from November 19 to January 23) Arctic winter wore away until April 14, 
when the report of ‘‘ whales seen in the lead”? set every one wild with excitement, 
nearly breaking up the school. All the pupils large enough left immediately to 
hunt whales, and a few weeks later the remaining boys and girls left to drive the 
dog teams that were transporting the whalebone and meat to the village from the 
edge of the ice, from 12 to 20 miles out to sea. 
In the spring of 1891 a schooner was chartered at San Francisco and loaded with 
Jumber and materials for a school building and teacher’s residence at Point Barrow; 
but the great Arctic ice pack not leaving the shore in time, the vessel was unable 
to reach the place, and the school has been compelled to remain another year in the 
Refuge Station. 
Point Hope, Episcopal; population, Eskimo; John B. Driggs, M. D., teacher: Dr. 
Driggs reports the population of the village as unusually small, the scarcity of 
food during the preceding winter having scattered them along the coast in more 
favored villages for hundreds of miles. In taking a census of the population in 
April he found only 161, being one-half the usual population. Out of that number, 
however, he had 68 pupils. Six of these were compelled to drop out in order to pro- 
vide food for their families. The others attended through the winter with great 
regularity. Three of the pupils died during the season, one being carried off on the 
ice and never heard from, probably being frozen to death and eaten by the bears; 
another was frozen to death, and a third died from hemorrhage. 
The school was opened on the Ist of October. ‘The day brought with it a blizzard 
and snow storm that lasted for nine days. During the morning the teacher occupied 
the schoolroom alone, but as time wore on and no pupils came he put on his furs and 
started for the village to hunt up the children. Upon going outside the house he 
found a boy walking the beach. Taking him into the schoolroom, he commenced 
school. At the close of the afternoon he presented bis pupil with a couple of pan 
cakes left from his own breakfast. The effect was equal to any reward of merit. 
‘That boy proved one of the most regular in attendance during the entire winter season. 
‘The next morning 4 presented themselves, and from that the school grew to 68. A 
mixture of flour, molasses, and water made a sort of cake, alittle of which was given 
to the pupils each evening, proving not only a very cheap and efficient method of 
securing regular attendance, but also discipline, as they had to be both present and 
perfect in their deportment and recitations to be entitled to cake. The scholars 
usually arrived from 6 to 7 in the morning and remained all day. Owing, perhaps, 
to their long-continued diet of frozen meat and snow eating, they had constantly to 
be excused to run out doors and get more snow, as the teacher found it impossible 
to melt water fast enough on his stove to keep them in drink. The sun disappeared 
on the 10th of December and returned on the 3d of January, giving them a night of 
twenty-four days. Lamps were required in the schoolroom from November 12 to Feb-

ruary9. Thethermometervaried inthe coldest weather from 27° to 31° below zero, the 
average of the winter being probably about 15° below zero. During February anda 
portion of March a series of blizzards set in that were beyond description, The ice 
was solid across the ocean to Cape Prince of Wales, 200 miles distant. The effect 
of the gales was such that at times it seemed as if the schoolhouse must be blown 
away. Snow flew in perfect sheets. The schoolhouse was located 2 miles from the 
village, and yet, notwithstanding the storms and distance, the attendance was good. 
For a few days the teacher hired men to see the little ones safely home through the 
- storm (the 2 miles distance), but soon found that the precaution was unnecessary ; 
that they were accustomed to take care of themselves. Not being used to any seats 
or chairs at home, the children found it very hard to sit on benches, and greatly 
preferred to occupy the floor, so that, looking over the schoolroom in writing time, 
a little girl could be seen on her knees and elbows-writing in one place, and in another 
a boy lying with his face downward on the floor, also writing, and so through the 
room every imaginable position could be seen. If beginners made a mistake they 
tried to rectify it by scratching with their finger nails. ‘They readily learned the 
alphabet and made some progress in reading, singing, and writing, the teacher being 
very much encouraged with his school. 
Cape Prince of Wales; American Missionary Association (Congregational) ; popu- 
lation, Eskimo; Messrs. W. T. Lopp.and H. R. Thornton, teachers: School was. opened 
on the 18th of August, 1890, with only about one-fourth of the population returned to 
the village from their summer’s hunt. 
The school being established among a wild people, that had never known any re- 
straints, that could not comprehend the purposes of the teachers in coming to them, 
and could not understand their language, through misapprehension there was agood 
deal of trouble at first. On the 19th of September, Elignak, one of the wealthiest 
_ men of the village, and one of his wives, both in a state of beastly intoxication, 
tried to force their way into the house. On the 23rd of September some of the stu- 
dents became so boisterous and unruly in the schoolroom that they also had to be 
excluded from the house. And again, in November, drunken parties tried to break 
in and make a disturbance, so that, for two months, the teachers taught, ate, 
worked, and slept-with loaded arms at lrand, not knowing at what moment they 
might have to defend the property committed to them, and their lives, their minds 
constantly harassed with questions as to when resistance should begin and how far 
it would be justifiable, debating in their own minds whether it would be better to 
allow themselyes to be robbed.or murdered without resistance, or through resistance 
make the savages respect their manhood. 
The danger to the station was greatly increased by an epidemic of the grip, which 
carried away 26 people in two months, which was by the superstitions of the people 
attributed to the presence of the white men among them. However, through tact 
and good management.and the providence of God hostilities were prevented, and by 
January the strained situation was greatly relieved. Mutual.confidence sprang up 
between the natives and the teachers. Having heard, before going to the place, of 
the bad reputation of the people (which, however, it was found they did not de- 
serve), and feeling that a people who knew nothing of schools would not endure for 
any length of time the restraints of a schoolroom, and the cost of building being 
very great (all lumber and material being sent from San Francisco, between 3,000 
and 4,000 miles), ‘the schoolhouse was built, to commence with, on a small scale (a 
room that would hold about 50 pupils),.and it was thought that if 50 pupils could 
be obtained among sucha people, under such circumstances, it would be a very great 
success. Buttotheastonishment of the teachers themselves and to the astonishment 
of the friends of education that are interested in these Arctic schools, it was found 
that the total enrollment for the first year was 304 pupils out of a population of 539 
people. The average daily attendance for the last seven months of the school was 
146 and the average daily attendance for the whole session of nine months was 105. 
As the schoolroom would hold only about 50 at a time, the teachers were compelled 
to divide the pupils into three classes.and hold morning, afternoon, and evening ses- 
sions.of school. And then, to prevent the children who belonged to the afternoon or 
evening school from smuggling themselves into the morning session, or the morning 
children from remaining to the afternoon.or evening session, it was found necessary 
to build two parallel snow walls some distance from the schoolroom door, and when 
the bell stopped ringing for school tho teachers ranged themselves.on either side, in 
order to sift the children that were trying to get into the schoolroom. It was with 
great difficulty that the pupils were made to understand that it was not proper to 
talk and laugh and jump over the benches in the schoolroom during school as much 
as they pleased; nor could they understand why 30 or 40 visitors could not lounge 
about the room which was needed for those who desired to study; so that upon sev- 
eral occasions.it became necessary to exclude certain parties from the schoolroom, 
but this exclusion of a few days was all that was necessary. It was considered a 
great punishment not to be able to come to school. During the epidemic a number

of slates of the children that they had been allowed to take home at night were re- 
turned by order of the:medicine men, who ascribed that much of the sickness was 
due to the slates and the pictures which the children made upon them—they were 
“bad medicine.” 
The teachers began their school-work by learning the Eskimo names of the most 
important objects in daily use and training their pupils in the Unglish equivalents, 
From words they proceeded to phrases.and from phrases to sentences, teaching them 
to translate from Eskimointo English and vice-versa. They gradually added English 
letters and numbers, together with some elementary geography and arithmetic. 
Although they had had a combined experience of thirteen years in the schoolroom 
in the States, the teachers declare that they never had more quick-witted, intelli- 
gent pupils than these wild Eskimo children. At the beginning of the-scheol year 
only a few could count ten in a blundering fashion, and nine-tenths of the pupils 
knew practically no English whatever. At the close of the first school year they 
had a good working vocabulary, knew-something of geography and map-drawing

showed.a remarkable desire to learn for learning’s sake. 
Anvik Christ Church Mission, Protestant Episcopal; Rey. O. Parker and Rey. John 
W. Chapman, teachers; enrollment, 6 boarding and 38 day pupils; population Atha- 
baskan. The-summer of 1890 was spent by the teachers in clearing the ground nec- 
essary for the establishment of their school.and residence buildings and in erecting 
asmall building, 15 feet square, to serve for the school. Upon the opening of school 
they found that they had built too small. It was, however, a great improvement 
upon the accommodations of the previous year. The school opened inthe new build- 
ing on the Ist of October, and the success was very gratifying, the attendance being 
nearly double that of the previous-year. The teachers report some very encour- 
aging instances of Indians.at a distance bringing their children to get the advan- 
tages of the school. On the 22d of January a trip was made to-several villages on

Chagelook Slough, for the purpose of interesting the people in the school. They 
only succeeded, however, in reaching the first village, the roads beyond that point 
being impassable. During the winter season the four walls of a house, 26 by 23 feet 
in size, were raised. ‘The new house will serve for a dwelling, and the present resi- 
dence will be turned into’a schoolhouse, utilizing the present small schoolhouse 
for a carpenter shop for the boys. 
Kosorifisky Holy Cross Mission, Roman Catholic; Rev. P. Tosi, teacher, assisted 
by two sisters of the Order of St. Ann; enrollment, 83; population Eskimo. They 
report the attendance of 53 boarding and 30 day pupils. ‘This is the largest and best 
equipped Roman Catholic school in the Territory. 
Nulato, Roman Catholic; population Indian. No report. 
Bethel, Moravian; Rey. J. &. Kilbuck in charge, with four assistants; enrollment, 
31; population Eskimo. Owing to the lack of a sufficient food supply, they were 
unable to keep the school in operation more than three terms (or 150 days) out of the 
school year. The schoolroom has been mainly in charge of Rev. E, L, Weber, The 
  Moravia Mission at Bethel, Alaska.

pupils made decided progress in the usual branches taught in schools with the excep- 
tion of speaking English. Owing to the fact that English is not heard in the com- 
munity outside of the school and mission, it is very difficult to secure its speaking 
by the pupils. In addition to the ordinary school studies taken, instruction was 
given in descriptive and physical geography and in physiology and hygiene. Three 
of the boys were given music lessons. Out of school hours the boys in connection 
with the home are busy in providing fuel and water, also in hunting for food. Thus 
- they are kept in touch with the methods necessary for them to employ to support 
themselves when they leave school. Two of the promising boys were sent East and 
found places in the Indian school at Carlisle, Pa. This being the oldest school among 
the Eskimo of western Alaska, it has made corresponding progress and secured a 
great influence among the people. . 
Carmel, Moravian, in charge of Rev. F. E. Wolf, with three assistants; enrollment, 
18; population, Eskimo: The teacher reports that they have received much opposi- 
tion from the Greek priest; that there were from 15 to 18 children whose parents ex-

pressed a desire to have them attend the school, but were afraid of the priest, who 
had forbidden them; that some of those who did send children were persecuted for 
it. A protest was sent by the teachers, indcrsed by the officers of the Moravian Mis- 
sionary Society, asking the interference of the Bureau of Education. At the request 
of the U. 8. Commissioner of Education, the honorable Secretary of the Treasury 
issued instructions for the captain of the U. S. revenue-cutter Bear to visit the place 
and inquire into the matter; but circumstances beyond control prevented this being 
done. 
Unalaska (Jessie Lee Memorial Home), Methodist Episcopal, John Tuck, in charge, 
with one assistant; attendance, 16 boarders and 31 day scholars; population, Aleuts 
and Creoles: A great deal of interest has been manifested in the school by the com- 
munity, the grown-up daughters of the Russian-Greek priest being among the pupils. 
There was also less interference with the regular attendance of school on account of 
the church holidays than is usual in communities under the influence of the Russian- 
Greek Church. ‘The progress of the pupils is all that could be desired. Indeed, 
Prof. Tuck, who is a teacher of many years experience in New England, reports that 
he never saw better progress made in any school. Capt. M. A. Healy, commander of 
the United States revenue-cutter Bear, has taken a great interest in the school be- 
cause of its successful management, and very kindly gave free passage to 6 orphan 
girls that were sent from St. Paul Island to Unalaska to attend school. Prof. Tuck 
still labors under the very great disadvantage of insufficient room for the school. 
KapiAk DIsTrict. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
Kadiak, William E. Roscoe, teacher; enrollment, 80; population, Russian Creoles: 
The teacher reports avery successful year. The children who came with any degree 
of regularity made excellent progress. Some trouble, as usual, was experienced from 
the opposition of the priest of the Greek Church, and the taking away of the children 
for almost daily services of the church during certain months of the year. 
Afognak, John Duff, teacher; enrollment, 39; population, Russian Creoles and 
Eskimo: School was opened on the 3d of October, a number of children coming in 
from neighboring villages to enjoy its advantages. During the year a comfortable 
school building and teacher’s residence were erected. The teacher reports that, 
while the people are quiet and inoffensive, yet a hundred years of misrule has broken 
their spirit and left them without hope or courage to better their condition; that 
intemperance is very rife among them, and that many of the pupils of the school, 
during the winter, were on the verge of starvation because their parents had wasted 
nearly all their living on intoxicating liquors. On visiting his pupils at their homes, 
he often found both parents dead drunk and the hungry children shivering with 
cold. Until some efficient means can be employed to prevent the introduction of 
liquors among them, the school work will be carried on under very great disadvan- 
tages. 
Karluk, Nicholas Faordorf, teacher; enrollment, 33; population, Eskimo: A comfort- 
able teacher’s residence and school building have been erected at thisplace. The chief 
industry is canning salmon, which gives employment to children as well as adults, 
so that during the run of thesalmon in summer schoolis suspended. It isan impor- 
tant center for a school, and it is hoped thatmuch can be accomplished in the future. 
Among the children are a large number of orphans that ought to be placed in an 
orphans’ home, where they can be properly fed and clothed as well as taught. It is 
hoped that this end will be accomplished when the women of the American Baptist 
Home Missionary Society establish their proposed home on Wood Island. 
Sirka District. 
Juneau, No. 1,Rhoda A. Lee, teacher; enrollment, 33; population, Americans: The 
children have made very gratifying progress during the year. They work under the 
grave disadvantage of being cramped in their schoolroom. Through the growth of 
the community a much larger school building is needed. It is also important that a 
small sum be allowed for draining and fixing up the school grounds. 
Juneau, No. 2, Mrs. Seth Tozer, teacher; enrollment, 51; population, Thlingets: The 
native children that reside with their parents have been very irregular in their_at- 
tendance. ‘The tendency for the parents to take the whole family with them when 
they go off fishing, hunting, or in search of work greatly interferes with the progress 
of the children in their school work. Some 25 of the children, however, are occupants 
of the Presbyterian Home conducted by Rev. Eugene 8, Willard and three assistants. 
These children, attending school every day and having special training out of school 
hours, made very commendable progress. The difference in the progress between 
these children from the Home and the children from the native village is so great

that it emphasizes the need of more Homes, tosecure the very best results from school 
work. During the year a good bell has been furnished the school. —- 
Douglas, No. 1, Mrs. W. 8. Adams, teacher; enrollment, 23; population, Amer- 
icans: This is the white school for the mining settlement on Douglas Island. Mrs. 
Adams was indefatigable in her efforts to interest and advance the pupils under her 
care. 
- Douglas, No. 2, Charles H. Edwards, teacher ; enrollment, 68; population, Thlingets: 
The enthusiasm and skill of Mr. Edwards as a teacher has made his native school 
equal to any in the Territory. 
Killisnoo, W. A. McDougall, teacher; enrollment, 68; population, Thlingets, with 
a yery few Russian Creoles. 
i sia Patton, teacher; enrollment, 54; population, whites and Rus- 
s : This school, being attended hy the children of the Government officials 
‘in Alaska, has scholars in more advanced ‘studies than any other in the Territory. 
,.Miss Patton has proved herself a very efficient and successful teacher. 
Sitka, No. 2, Mrs. Lena Vanderbilt, teacher; enrollment, 55; population, Thlin- 
gets: Owing to the want of coéperation on the part of the governor, who failed to 
use his influence with the native population to secure the attendance of their chil- 
dren at school, the results have been less satisfactory in this than in any other 
school. Instead of an enrollment of 55 it ought to be at Jeast 200, and this conld 
have been brought about if the proper influence had been exerted in the community. 
Wrangel, Mrs. W. G. Thomas, teacher; enrollment, 93; population, Thlingets: 
This school has during the year past entered the second stage of its existence, the 
earlier pupils having largely grown up and gone off for work and left a second and 
younger set of children to come into the school. Mrs. Thomas, haying been the first 
and only teacher of the school from the date of its organization as a Government 
school, has had the great satisfaction of ‘seeing the fruit of her work. 
Klawack, H. C. Wilson, teacher; enrollment, 50; population, Thlingets: During 
the year the schoolhouse has been repaired and made very comfortable. 
Jackson, Mrs, Clara G. McLeod, teacher; enrollment, 100; population, Hydai: 
This school, like the one at Wrangel, having had but one teacher during its whole 
history, has made much progress.     
  CONTRACT SCHOOLS. 
The Sitka Industrial Training School: This, largest of all the industrial schools in 
Alaska, was established in 1880 by the Board of Home Missions in the Presbyterian 
Church, United States of America, and has since become a Government contract 
school, although the entire plant, consisting of more than a dozen buildings, is 
owned exclusively by the board. The total number of pupils enrolled from the ~ 
commencement of the school year was $9 boys and 60 girls, making a total of 159. 
‘The average attendance for the year was 140. The ages of pupils ranged from four 
to twenty-one years. - 
The buildings are admirably situated on an elevation back some 200 feet from 
high-water mark, with a gently rolling beach in front, and about centrally located 
between the village and Indian River. An abundant supply of pure water is 
brought in pipes a distance of three-fourths of a mile. The water is forced to a 
height of 80 feet into a large tank by means of a pump run by water power, and 
from this source all the buildings, including hospitals, are supplied. Z 
The model cottages are eight in number, where the married couples from the 
school begin housekeeping in “‘ Boston style,” as the natives express it. Funds for 
the erection of some of the cottages were loaned (without interest) by the Indian 
Rights Association, and funds for the erection of others were contributed by indi- 
viduals in full sympathy with a rational system of dealing with the Indian problem. 
The young people who occupy the cottages have a life lease of the ground, and are 
expected to pay for the building they occupy in annual installments. The average 
cost of a cottage is $350. Of 9 couples married, some of whom were in school only 
four years, 8 are doing well, and are trustworthy, reliable citizens. ‘Like all true 
homes, we expect these to be the centers of purity from which will radiate blessed 
influences that shall be far-reaching and lasting in their results. Here family life 
is established, and family ties are held sacred; here industry, frugality, persever- 
ance, and thrift are developed; here old customs have no place—no Indian doctors, 
no witchcraft, no pot laches, no indemnity payments, no plural wives, no driuking, 
no gambling, no improvident want, no reckless living. In these model homes the 
young husbands have a chance to develop into manly, self-supporting men, and the 
young housewives have opportunity to deyelop into tidy, industrious, womanly 
women, 
In the winter of 188788 the Society of Alaskan Natural History and Ethnology 
was organized and incorporated. The purpose is to collect and preserve in connec-

tion with the Sitka Industrial and Training School specimen illustrations of the 
natural history and ethnology of Alaska. 
Hospitals: There are two wards, capable of accommodating 12 patients each. 
During the summer the death rate was not high. The wards, however, were never 
vacant. The approach of a rainy winter brings colds, pneumo:ia, rheumatism, ¢ 
sumption, and epidemic diseases. Chronic troubles, sore eyes, scrofula, syphilitic 
taints, and tubercular disease.are common among native parents and are visited upon 
the children. Patients receive the remedies, but owing to neglect of guidance they 
disregard the Jaws of health. It is a task to keep convalescents from exposure to 
drafts and violating sanitary regulations. The preparation of food, administering 
of medicine, care of the wardrobe, dressing of cuts, wounds, and sores, the watching 
and anxiety, are all exhausting to the nervous system, but when disease yields to 
nt the school physician and nurses feel repaid for all their services. 
Language: The children speedily acquire an English-speaking vocabulary when 
strictly prohibited from using their native dialects. For five years-English has 
been the exclusive language of the school. Experience has removed all doubt as to 
its expediency. The use of their vernaculars (Thlinget, Tsimpshean, Hydia) seriously 
retards their progress and does them no essential benefit. No schoolbooks have 
ever been printed in any of their native dialects. Each distinct people has a dialect 
of its own, local in character, and in course of time the vernacular dialects of the 
tribes of southeastern Alaska will become obsolete and English will everywhere 
prevail. Asa matter of preservation the Society of Alaskan Natural History and 
Ethnology has lately commenced to reduce the Thlinget language to writing, which 
we hope to accomplish through the instrumentality of Mrs. Paul and Miss Willard, 
two native teachers of the industrial school. : 
Culinary department: This department is a place of great interest to the pupils, 
both boys and girls, small and large. All want to come into the kitchen to work 
andto learn to cook. The boys wish to know how to cook good meals and bake 
good bread, pies, and cakes. They often ask if they can come into the kitchen to 
work, and this stirs up a spirit of emulation among the girls so that they beg to 
work in the kitchen; consequently, there is no lack of those who desire to work in 
these departments. 
In the bakery the work is too heavy for the girls, and isdone entirely by the boys. 
During the past year they have averaged 140 pounds of flour baked daily turning 
out from 90 to 100 leaves of delicious bread a day. When the girls serve in the 
kitchen they bake the pies and cakes, and the boys in their turn do the same, which 
is during the winter season, that being the hard period of work. Much attention 
has been given to the quality of food, and in the past few years it has been greatly 
improved. One great victory won in the battle of work in these departments is 
cleanliness, In this direction there has been a vast improvement made. It is a 
pleasure now to be with them and hear them say, ‘‘ Oh, this must be very clean; I    
       
      
  want it to be clean and nice.” Viewing these departments, they have made rapid _ 
progress in the last year. . : 
The kitchen is supplied with both hot and cold water. The greatest obstacle in 
the work of these departments is the annoyance of having green wood much of the 
time. , 
The sewing room has been enlarged and nicely papered. The light is admitted 
from the east, so that they get the benefit of the morning sun. This department is 
well equipped, and the amount of work done each week is surprising. The girls 
over 7 years of age knit their own stockings. In the sewing department they learn 
quickly and accomplish much. Sewing machines are in daily use, and the girls soon 
learn to use them. Almost every graduate has a machine of her own. 
All the shees are made by the boys, apprenticed under the direction of a master 
workman. Considerable custom work is also done. 
Laundry: Mrs. Simpson, in charge of this department, says in her report: “ Nearly 
all of the large boys that formerly had charge of the machinery have gone from the 
school, and two of the younger boyshave charge of all the machinery, and are getting 
along nicely.” 
The steam laundry, with its labor-saving machinery, relieves the teachers and 
pupils of much hard drudging work incident to a school of this character where 
water and soap must be used in such copious quantities. 
Carpentry department: All of the buildings on the mission premises, twenty or 
more, have been built by boys apprenticed to this trade, under the supervision of a 
competent foreman. Shopwork consists in the making of furniture, bookcases, - 
elothespresses, screens, chests, curtain poles, picture frames, hand-sleds, bric-a-brac 
work, and undertaking. The outdoor work consists of joining, framing, contract- 
ing, and building. Sail-making and boat-building are among the useful industries © 
of this department. Among our carpenter apprentices a number have shown special 
aptitude as artists and designers. The spirit of earnest industry is most praise- 
worthy, and the boys appreciate their opportunities.-

  932 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Gardening: Mr. John Gamble, gardener and general worker, has three medium- 
sized plats of arable land. One garden, which has been cultivated for several 
years, produces lettuce, beets, peas, and onions in abundance. Of the other gar- 
dens, which are new, one is planted in potatoes and the other sown in turnips. 
Cereals, for lack of warmth and sunshine, do not ripen. Currants, rhubarb, rasp- 
berries, cauliflower, and celery are easily grown. Fruits, such as apples, plums, and 
pears, have not been fully tested, but it is believed that they could be grown with 
success. 
Blacksmithing can hardly be classed among the trades by which a man can earn 
a living in Alaska, yet there is much work in this line, doing repairs about the mis- 
sion, mending machinery, repairing stoves, making stovepipes, camp hooks, sharpen- 
ing tools, and doing miscellaneous jobs for.the citizens of the quaint little capital: 
Soldering anda little tin work are also done. | The constant wear and tear in most of 
the work departments require much repairing, nearly all of which is done by the 
boys. 
Painting: Two or three of the boys have received instruction in this useful branch 
of industry, and are kept busy painting, papering, glazing, and kalsomining. 
Recreations and amusements: The home life of the school is particularly pleas- 
ant. Their games and plays are such as white children. enjoy, consisting of games 
of marbles, baseball, townball, playing soldier, flying kites, sailing ships, target prac- 
tice with bow and arrow, authors, checkers, dominoes, rope-jumpiug, hide-and-seek. 
Coasting and skating are indulged in by both sexes. Then there is an organ for the 
girls and another for the boys, and violins, guitars, fifes, bugles, and the irrepressible 
mouth organs are among the amusements and recreations of each day. 
A rational system of discipline is easily and well maintained. 
Those in charge aim to make the industrial training school just what its name 
implies. Manual occupations are in reach of the pupils as fast as they acquire suf- 
ficient knowledge of the English language to enable them to prosecute the learning 
of a trade with success. To accomplish anything permanent and of material benefit 
       
~ in the way of mastering trades, they must first acquire a fair, common school educa- 
tion, before which they are not prepared to serve an intelligent apprenticeship. 
After certain initiatory advancement has been made, industrial training is then 
made coequal with school-room work. While the boys are taught trades, the girls 
are taught all branches of household industry. Indeed, the appointments and work 
of the school are such as to familiarize them with American ways of living and to 
ingraft into their lives industrious habits. *

of 36; by Christmas the enrollment had reached 96. A number of them came from 
distant villages, one family coming 300 miles across country from the Arctic re- 
gion. During the long winter evenings the children were taught various kinds of

Of Henry Philips, Capt. R. H. Pratt, of the Carlisle School, writes: 
“J have had Henry Philips for nearly a year in a machine shop in the town of 
Carlisle, where he has made most wonderful progress in his knowledge of machinery. 
He is bound up in it, far more interested in it than he was in the printing rooms. 
There is very little about an engine that he cannot now attend to. Moreover, he 
has become a very strong, sensible boy. His brain power has developed wonder- 
fully, and he is, I believe, a sincere Christian, and leads the students in that feature 
of our school work. Now, I have not talked with him on the subject of your letter. 
The opportunity for him to go into this work came through his Sunday School 
teacher, who is the head of one of our firms in the town of Carlisle. It came natu- 
rally, and its worth has been fully established. I believe that Henry may go back 
to Alaska, able to go into any of their great mining machinery departments, or he 
"may find profitable employment in the country at large. 
SUPERVISION, 
In accordance with your directions, I left Washington on the 19th of May, reach- 
ing Port Townsend on the 25th. Immediately going on board the U.S.8. Bear, I 
was assigned quarters in the captain’s cabin. From May 24 to 29I was very busy 
securing barter goods for the purchase of reindeer and supplies for the schools at 
Cape Prince of Wales and Point Barrow. At Port Townsend, Mr. J. P. Russell and 
party, of the U. S. Bureau of Ethnology, were received on board for transportation 
to the base of Mount St. Elias. é 
At4 a.m. on the 30th of May anchor was weighed and we left for the north. On 
the 4th of June we caught our first glimpse of Mount St. Elias, one hundred and 
forty miles away. We coasted all day along the Fair-weather range of mountains, 
covered with snow and large glaciers. _ We also passed a number of sealing vessels. 
At 11.45 p. m. dropped anchor on the south side of Fort Mulgrave, and were soon 
after visited by Mr. Henrickson, one of the Swedish missionaries at that place. 
On June 5, immediately after breakfast, I went ashore and inspected the school 
and mission station. The teachers in charge were Rev. K. J. Henrickson and Rev. 
and Mrs, Albin Johnson, I found the missionaries living in a small one and a half 
story house (20 by 30 feet) of four rooms on the ground floor. Into this house.they 
had taken eight boys and six girls as lodgers. During the past winter they reported 
250 people in attendance at church and 60 children at school. They have erécted 
and inclosed a complete and substantial frame building (35 by 45 feet), two anda 
half stories high, The schoolroom is so far finished as to be occupied. With very 
great labor they have cleared two or three acres of land and planted them with pota~ 
toes and turnips. 
Commencing with July 1, 1891, this will be made one of the contract schools of 
the Government. From the mission we went through the native village; then, tak- 
ing a boat, we crossed the bay in a driving rain and visited the old village, return- 
ing to the ship for lunch. In the afternoon I again went ashore, when the school 
children were called together and examined by myself. In the neighborhood of 
Yakatat are coal measures, and along the beach a black sand bearing gold. On the 
6th of June we weighed anchor at 2:40 a. m. and at 9:25 a. m. dropped anchor off Guyot 
Glacier, Icy Bay. At 9 for a short time Mount St. Elias emerged from the clouds 
and stood revealed before us from base to top in all its majesty. It was a sight 
never to be forgotten. The whole distance from Yakatat to Iey Bay we skirted the 
base of Mount St. Elias and the gigantic glaciers that occupy the coast line. Upon’ 
dropping anchor Lieut, Jarvis was sent ashore to see if a landing could be made 
through the surf in safety. He reported favorably; preparations were at once made: 
to land the exploring party and their supplies. At 10 o’clock Lieut. Jarvis led the 
way, in charge of the second cutter, with a load of supplies. Fifteen minutes later 
he was followed by the third cutter, in charge of Lieut. L. L. Robinson, with James 
Haisler, cockswain, W. J. Wright, H. Smith, T. F. Anderson, and A. Nelson, seamen, 
and W: C. Moore, of Prof. Russell’s party. This boat capsized just before entering 
the breakers and all the cccupants were drowned except seaman Wright. At 10:30 
the first cutter of Lieut. Broadbent was sent in, but before reaching the breakers, 
seeing the fate of the other boat, was recalled to the ship. 
+ The balance of the day was spent in uncertainty as to the fate of the crew in the 
wrecked boat. First, Lieut. MeConnel was sent in shore as close as the breakers 
would allow, but was unable to secure information. The next morning Lieuts. 
McConnel and Broadbent were sent to the edge of the breakers to endeavor to open 
communication with Lieut. Jarvis onshore, They then returned, reporting the loss. 
Lieut. Jarvis was then signaled to bury the body of seaman Anderson, and, when he
-P-A-G-E-291
  4 EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 939 
could safely do so, embark and return aboard with the body of Lieut. Robinson, the only 
bodies that were recovered at the date of sailing. At slack water, high tide, Lieut. 
Jarvis and men returned to the ship, bringing with them the body of Lieut. Robin- 
son. Several boat loads of supplies were then safely landed, until the third entter, 
breaking its oarlock, capsized at the landing, and the cutter that was still outside 
the surf was recalled to the ship. Lieut. McConnel and crew of the overturned eut- 
ters 
it was safe to land the balance of Prof. Russell’s party and the supplies, which was 
done. At 4.25 a. m. anchor was weighed and we sailed for Sitka, 285 knots away, 
reaching there at 5.12 p. m. 
At 11 o’clock on June 10 the body of Lieut. Robinson was buried in the military 
and naval cemetery. While at Sitka I inspected the two Government schools, and 
also the industrial training school. While there Mr. William Wells, John Matthew, 
and William Hoonah, native boys trained in the industrial school, were enlisted on 
the Bear in the place of the drowned crew. On the 14th anchor was weighed at 3.a, 
m., and the ship started for the Shumagin Islands. 
At 4:30 in the morning, June 18, the captain called me to the deck to see the scen- 
ery. We were abreast of Cape St. John, Alaska Peninsula. To the south were 
Castle Rock and Big and Little Koninshi islands. To the southwest was Nagai 
Island. In front was Andronick Island;.and between Andronick and Nagai islands 
the Seven Haystack Rocks stood as sentinels across the West Nagai Straits. To the 
northwest were Korovoin and Bouldyr islands, while over and beyond them was 
the main peninsula, with its snow-covered mountains glistening inthe morning sun.    
  yed on shore all night. At 2.15 a. m., June 8, Lieut. McConnel signaled that_ 
In the lower ravines of the mountains lay great banks of fog. Hour after hourI - 
sat watching with unabated interest the ever-changing panorama. On the right a 
school of whales was playing. Then a sea otter tantalizingly lifted its head out 
from its watery home to see what strange monster was passing by. 
About 8 o’clock we passed into Gorman Straits, between Korovoin and Andronick : 
islands, heading for Pirate Cove on Popoff Island. On Korovoim is a small settle- 
ment of two large families. They have four or five houses and a small Greck church. 
The patriarch of the settlement is a Russian, who claims to be 105 years old. Passing 
to the north of High Island, we were abreast of Pirate Cove. Steam was shut off, 
the propeller stopped with a jar, and the ship lay off and on, while a boat was sent 
ashore in charge of Lieut. Jarvis. A small, high, narrow nook of land ex!ending 
out into the sea forms a small but beantiful land-locked bay, just such a sheltered 
and hidden retreat as'might be chosen by pirates, from which to make a sudden raid 
upon some -passing vessel. According to tradition, this was once the strenghold of 
a piratical and warlike people, who subsisted by raiding neighboring settlements, 
from whom they exacted tribute in skins, furs, and fish. They usually made their 
piratical raids in their large skin boats. They were bold and brave and became the 
terror of the Shumagin Islands, For many years the neighboring settlements groaned. 
under their oppressive rule, until it became so heavy and unendurable that a secret 
combination of warriors was formed at Korovoin to make a desperate effort for lib- 
erty. Under cover of a dark and stormy Alaskan night they made an attack on’ ~ 
Pirate Cove. Taken unawares, the people fell before the avenging hands of those 
they had so greatly wronged, and the hate of years was wiped out in the complete 
. Massacre of the population, not a man, woman, or child being left alive. The place

station. . 
Landing on the wharf, we had to pick our way across, through, and over a large 
heap of fish that were waiting to be cleaned, while on the beach near by a large 
flock of noisy sea gulls awaited breakfast from the refuse thrown away in cleaning . 
the fish. In a neighboring sturehouse forty thousand codfish were awaiting trans- 
portation to market. On the beach was the machinery of the wrecked steamer Pre- 
mier. Ona grassy, flowery hillside back of the building were the lone graves of 
thirteen sailors that were drowned a few years beforo in the wreck of a schooner. 
Of the crew of sixteen’ but three escaped. Gathering large bouquets of beautiful 
wild flowers, we returned to the ship and were soon under way for Unga. 
Turning south, we skirted the east side of Popoff Island, rounded Popoff Head, and 
made direct for the mouth of Unga Harbor, where we dropped anchor at noon. I 
went ashore and inspected the schoolhouse andsupplies. About3 o’clock p.m.anchor 
was again weighed and we went to Sand Point, dropping anchor in Humboldt Har- 
bor, where I again went ashore. At 2:25 a.m. anchor was again weighed and we 
Jeft Humboldt Harbor for Unalaska. At 4:20 we were rounding the Sea Lion Rocks 
off the extreme southern end of Unga Island. At 9 o’clock we passed a small settle- 
ment of Aleuts on Wosnesensky Island, which lay to the southwest of our course. 
Passing to the north of Ukolsnoy Island a “woolly” ' swept down from Payloff Bay 
that sent the spray in sheets across our deck. Directly ahead was Pavyloff volcano, 
1A sudden gale of wind that sweeps down high mountains on the seacoast.

covered with snow from base to summit. From the craterlazily arose pufts of smoke 
and steam which flew off before the wind. Rounding Cape Baum, we passed, on 
Dolgay Island, the village of Nicclopski, of three or four houses, and the omnipresent 
Greek church. Passing west of Goloy Island and on between the inner and outer 
Iliask Islands, we were abreast of Belkofsky, a noted sea-otter hunting village. 
This is said to be one of. the windiest settlements in Alaska. Situated on a bluff at 
the base of a high mountain, the ‘ woollies” sweep over it with such violence that 
at times a tub set outside of the door is in danger of being blown out to sea. The 
village has, next to Sitka, the best Greek church building in the Territory. Upon 
one occasion the captain of the revenue cutter, learning that one of the citizens was. 
making ‘‘quass” (native beer) contrary to law, sent a force on shore to seize and 
destroy the liquor. The owner became so furious at the loss of his liquor that he 
called upon the men to take everything he had, saying that without his liquor life was 
not worth living, and when they left him he was smashing his windows, throwing 
his crockery out of doors, and breaking up his furniture generally. 
To the north of us a few miles was Bailey Harbor, where, during November, 1886, 
in the steam schooner Léo, I safely rode out a winter’s gale. Passing between Cape 
Tonkey and Deer Island, in the distance loomed up Unca, a small rock upon which 
one fall were placed two natives to spend the winter in search of sea otters. When 
taken off the following spring, they were nearly dead from starvation, a storm hay- 
ing carried away a large portion of their provisions. At 7 o’clock in the evening, 
Sheshaldin volcano arose up before us, a snow-covered cone, 8,755 feet high. Pass- 
ing between Cape Pankoff and the Sannak group of islands and rocks, we were 
again in the waters of the North PacificOcean. On the morning of the 20th, coming 
early upon deck, I found we had, during the night, passed between Ougomok Island 
and Scotch Cape, on Ounimak Island, and were in Bering Sea. At 7:30 a.m. we were 
in the midst of a large school of whales. Fourteen were counted playing at one 
time around the ship. They were so near that it seemed as if the ship must strike 
some of them. Myriads of birds. darkened the surface of the water. Along the 
north shore of Akoutan Island the honeycombed rocks of lava formed many beauti- 
ful arches and cayes, while, a short distance inland, lay open before us the crater of 
an extinct volcano. Rounding Priests’ Rock, we were soon in Captain’s Bay and 
smooth water. Passing Ulakhta Bay, we were opposite Dutch Harbor, where the 
North American Commercial Company are making extensive improvements. A few 
miles further, and at 2:55 p.m., we were at the wharf of the Alaska Commercial 
Company at Unalaska, receiving the cordial greetings of friehds. 
U.S. 8. Rush, Capt. Coulson commanding, and the Alaska Commercial Company’s 
schooner Matthew Turner, Capt. Hay, were in port, and, about an hour afterwards, 
the steamer South Coast arrived with a load of miners and mining material for the 
mines of Golovine Bay. On Wednesday, June 24, there was a heavy shock of 
earthquake. The week was spent mainly on shore, looking after school matters. 
On the 26th a drunken mother took a child ont of the boarding department of the 
school, but upon the following day the United States deputy marshal secured the 
* girl and returned her to the school. On the 29th the U.S. 8. Corwin, Capt. Hooper 
commanding, arrived with newspapers as late as June 17, from San Francisco. 
At 2 o’clock p. m. on the 30th of June anchor was weighed and we started for our 
long Arctic cruise, our first stop being off the village on St. George Island, at 9:45 
p.m.on July 1. The school kept under the auspices of the North American Com- 
mercial Company report an average attendance: of twenty pupils. The surf being 
too bad for landing, at 3:15 a, m.on July 2, we started for St. Paul Island, reaching 
there at 9 o’clock. The forenoon was spent in visiting the village and looking after 
. school matters. The attendance for the preceding year had ranged from 42 to 50. 
Between the landing and the village there is a large wooden cross which marks the 
spot where the first religious service was held on the island, by the Russo-Greek 
Church. Returning to the ship we got under way at 2:45 p. m. and for the next 
day steamed through the rain and fog. On the morning of the 4th of July as we 
were just finishing breakfast we were startled by the cry, ‘Land all around.” Rush- 
ing to the deck we found that in the fog and through an easterly set of the current, 
at the rate of 1,4 miles an hour, we had drifted to the westward of our course 45 
miles in forty-one hours and were in danger of running on shore at the southeast 
cape of St. Lawrence Island. A few minutes more of fog would have shipwrecked 
us. As customary upon such holidays the sailors were given by the officers an extra 
dinner in honor of the day. At 6:30 a.m. July 5 we passed King Island, five miles 
distant, and at 11:10 a. m. came to anchor in the midst of the whaling fleet at Port 
Clarence. 
There were at anchor around us 11 whaling steamers and 9 sailing vessels. Soon 
after dropping anchor Messrs. Thornton and Lopp, the two teachers landed at Cape 
Prince of Wales, came on board, It was a great relief to see them looking well and 
to learn that they had had a very prosperous winter. They were disappointed, how- 
ever, in finding that no ladies had been sent up to reénforce their mission. Soon

after landing tho captains of the various whalers came on board for their mail and 
the day passed yery rapidly. In the evening Capt. Healy and myself went off to 
the brig Abram Barker to see Mr. J. B. Vincent, third mate, with regard to procur- 
ing domestic reindeer. I had hoped to be able to employ Mr. Vincent, but found 
that he could not be relieved from his present engagement until the ship returned to 
San Francisco in the fall. On July 6 Mr. Vincent came aboard the cutter and spent 
the whole forenoon in discussing with me plans for procuring reindeer. In the 
afternoon I went ashore and visited the large number of natives that were camped on 
the beach. 
On the 7th anchor was weighed and the ship started for Cape Prince of Wales, 
having on board 170 natives with their eight umniaks in tow behind. During the 
day the natives on board gave an exhibition of some of their dances. At 5 p.m. we 
anchored off the cape, and the natives were immediately set to work with their 
umniaks, taking on shore 18} tons of coal and the supply of provisions for the mis- 
sion, which was completed by 9 0’clock thatevening. ‘The supplies, with the excep- 
tion of the coal, were then carried by the natives from the beach to the mission 
house, which kept them at work until about 2 o’clock in the morning. 
On the forenoon of the 8th my time was spent on shore, inspecting the mission and 
the village, and at 1 o’clock that afternoon thé whole village was invited off to the

ship. Messrs. Thornton and Lopp called the school children to the cutter and gaye 
an exhibition of what their schools could do in arithmetic, language, and singing, 
after which there was a race of 12 umniaks from the beach to the ship and return, 
the winner to receive as a prize three pails full of ship biscuit, the second best, two, 
and the third, one. After this the people were assembled on deck, the officers of the 
ship being in full uniform, and Capt. Healy gave them a talk with regard to tem- 
perance, school matters, etc., ending with appointing ten policemen whose duty it 
should be to assist the teachers in preserving order and looking after school attend- 
ance. The chief of the police was Er-a-hé-na and his assistant, Kitmeesuk. The 
others were Tiongmok, Ootiktok, Teredloona, Kalawhak, Weahona, Wéakiseok, 
Kartayak, and Maana. The first chief, for his year’s wages, was to receive three 
sacks of flour, the second two, and the others one each. Capt. Healy presented each 
of them with a uniform cap. Three rounds of blank shells were then fired from the 
20-pound howitzer, to impress the natives with the power of the ship. When the 
shell struck the water miles away and threw a large column of water high in the 
air, many were the exclamations of astonishment. 
From July 8 to July 26 the time was spent mostly upon the coast of Siberia, in 
prosecuting further inquiries with regard to domestic reindeer, of which an account 
will be given later on in this report.

Upon going on deck on the morning of July 26, I found that we had just passed 
throngh Bering Strait and were in the Arctic Ocean. ‘To the south of us the 
strait Play like a panorama, Cape Prince of Wales its eastern boundary, East Cape 
its western, and the two Diomede Islands in the center, all being plainly visible. ‘To 
the right of us, looking back, loomed up on the horizon the snow-covered mountains 
of Asia, to tho left of us those of America. The ocean was as smooth as a mill-pond. 
Late in the evening two umniak loads of natives came off to the shfp. The dayhad 
been a charming one of quiet and sunshine. 
On themorning of the 27th we anchored off Capo Blossom at Kotzebue Sound, and 
soon after 300 natives were on the decks of the vessel, and a keen barter was had 
between the furs of the natives and the flour, powder, caps, muslin, and tebacco of 
“the ship. 
At 11:45 a. m.on the 28th anchor was weighed and the ship started for Cape 
Thompson, 75 miles distant. 
At 5:35 a.m. on the 29th we dropped anchor abreast of Cape Thompson, and the 
ship’s boats were at once lowered to water ship. Cape Thompson is one of the great 
bird rookories of the Arctic. The early morning calls and cries of the myriad birds 
on the face of the clifis sound on the deck of the ship, half a mile away, like the 
escape of steam from a railroad engine at the depot. Some of the officers went on

shore hunting. At 5 in the afternoon anchor was hoye and the ship got under way 
for Point Hope, where we anchored abreast of the schoolhouse at 9: 15 p.m. As 
late as was the hour, several umniaks full of natives came on board to request the 
captain to take off their hands a sailor who the previous season deserted from one 
of the whaling ships and during the winter had frozen his feet so badly that they 
had mortified and would need to be amputated. The ship’s physician was sent off 
to sec the man with the frozen feet. Early the following day the physician returned 
to the ship, bringing the sick man with him. After breakfast I went on shore to 
inspect the school. Dr. Driggs, the teacher, reported that all the children of the 
village between the ages of 5 and 21, with the exception of three married girls, had 
been in school during the past winter; that the best attendance was on the stormi- 
est days, as then the children would not be required to go out upon the ice to fish. 
The village has a present population of 161. These are only about one-half of those 
who belong there, the others being scattered through the country for a living, the 
food supply having g been very scant at the village. The coldestweather experienced 
during the previous winter at the village, where tho climate is moderated by the 
ocean, is 31° below zero. Back from the village a few miles inland the cold was 
much more severe. The longest time during which the sun did not appear above 
the horizon was twenty-four days. During the spring Polar white bear prowled 
around the schoolhouse. In May the teacher had a battle with a large bear in front

of his house. During the afternoon, in company with the teacher, I visited the 
native village. . 
On the 3ist of July the captain received on board a deserter by the nameof Wil- 
liam Brown, who the previous winter, through exposure, had frozen his feet and 
hands, necessitating the amputation of his left leg at the ankle and three fingers of 
his left hand. He was covered with vermin and greatly reduced in strength by star- 
vation and neglect. Stephen Cushi, a miner, crippled with rheumatism, was also ~ 
taken on board for treatment and taken out of the country. At noon on the Ist of 
August we weighed anchor and started for the coal mines, 42 miles distant, and at 
7:15 came to anchor off the north side of Cape Lisbon. At midnight the captain and 
some of the officers went ashore, and in avery short time returned with 50 to 60 ptar- 
magin. We met much floating ice. 
At 3 p.m. on the 3d of August the ship got under way for the coal mines at 
Cape Sabine. Picking our way through large masses of heavy drifting ice, we 
reached the cape and dropped anchor at 7 o'clock. We were surrounded with ice 
during the 4th and 5th, when, the ice becoming too heavy, the ship got under way 
at4:40.a,m. on the 5th, standing northwest towards the iee pack. At6p.m., in 
the midst of large fields of broken ice, we came upon hundreds of walrus. A boat 
was lowered and the captain and surgeon went after them and soon came back with 
four large ones, which were hoisted on board. During the 6th the ship stood off 
and on along the edge‘of the ice pack, speaking several whalers during the day. 
Upon the 8th the ship returned to the shore, anchoring: off the Thetis coal mine at 
3:25 p.m. On the morning of August 9 three deserters from the whaler Rosario 
were discovered on the beach, brought on board, and placed in irons. At 10:15 a.m. 
anchor was weighed and the ship sailed northward, pushing its way through. the 
heavy floating ice. At 5:40 p.m. on the 10th the ship was stopped a short time to 
see some natives off Wainwright Inlet. Onthe 11th the vessel anchored at midnight 
off Point Belcher. In thé early morning Mr. L. M. Stevenson, the teacher from 
Point Barrow, who had come down the coast 70 miles across the ice, came on board. 
In the afternoon Mr. Frank Gotch, of the Refuge Station, arrived. The same day 
Samuel Benny, a deserter from the whaler Rosario, was brought before Capt. Healy, 
accused of having stolen from the natives. The charge having been substantiated, 
and the man being a disreputable and desperate character, he was detained on board 
the vessel. Mr. Stevenson, the teacher, mentioned that during the spring, when 
the natives were out upon the ice floe after walrus, one of the school girls, who was 
driving a team of dogs with a load of whalebone from :the edge of the ice to the 
village, being taken sick upon the way, her father wanted to leave her upon the ice 
to die, as was the custom with the natives under similar circumstances, but that 
her school companions resisted him, and, taking off their own fur coats, made a 
warm bed for her on top of the sled load of whalebone, and thus brought her safely 
into the village—one of the incidental fruits of the little schooling that they had had. 
From August 12 to 23 we lay at anchor against the great southern edge of the Are- 
tic ice pack, watching for the chance to get farther north, hoping a gale would 
spring up from tlie east that would open a channel for the ship, but it did not come, 
and we were unable to reach Point Barrow. On the 14th two natives, Mary and 
Charlie, who had previously been employed as interpreters, were received on board, 
to be returned to their friends at St. Michael. The school supplies intended for 
Point Barrow were landed at Point Belcher. On the16th Lieut. Jarvis and Dr. Call 
and Engineer Falkenstein were sent on an exploring expedition to examine a sound 
and harbor which had been reported to the captain. They were found, however, to 
be too shallow to be of any service. On the 17th Capt. Healy, learning that a 
strange iron steamer had gone north that morning, concluded to follow her up, and 
for that purpose boldly pushed forwardintotheicefield. After proceeding northsome 
10 miles or more in the fog, fearing that he would miss the vessel, he steamed clear 
ofthe ice and anchored at 3:30 p.m. Toward evening, the fog lifting, the steamer 
was seen working her way out of the ice from the north. At7:35 p.m, the Bear 
weighed anchor and steamed out to meet théunknown vessel, which was found tobe 
asmall Japanese iron steamer, the Tsuri Marie, of Tokio, that had been chartered 
at Yokohama-by a Mr. Carroll, of Carrollton, Md., who was on a bridal trip around 
the world, and, with ayachting party, had come into the Arctic hunting walrus and 
Polar bear.. Ignorant of their danger, they had driven their steamer into the ice. 
thinking they could force a way up to Point Barrow. The two steamers came 
to anchor at 9:55 p. m., and Mr. and Mrs. Carroll and party came over to the Bear to 
eall. 
August 23: Fresh ice was now forming every day upon the ocean. The ridging of 
the ship was covered with ice, and daily there were fresh flurries of sleet and hail. 
Allhope of reaching Point Barrow being abandoned, at 9:15 a, m. anchor was weighed. 
and the ship turned southward, slowly forcing its way through great masses of bro-   
   
ken ice. At 3:40p.m. the fog was so dense that it was thought best to dropanchor — 
for the night. On the 24th the ship wax still at anchor at Wainwright Inlet in the

midst of heavy snow squalls. At 7 in the morning anchor was weighed and another 
start made through large fields of brokenice. At 11 p.m.schooner John McCullough, 
that had on board material for the school and mission house at Point Barrow, was 
sighted. As it would be impossible for it to reach there this season, I went aboard 
and gave the captain permission to land his material at Cape Prince of Wales. On 
the morning of the 25th we were off Corwin Coal Mine, where the captain took in a 
supply of fresh water. At 6.20 p.m. we were again under way going south, and on 
the 17th, in the midst of a dense fog, made the coast of Siberia. At 6 o’clock on the 
evening of August 29, a short stop was made at Cape Prince of Wales, and the last 
mail of the teachers to their friends was received on board. 
At 9a. m., August 20, we lett the cape for King Island, where we anchored at 4:25 
p.m. After leaving Cape Prince of Wales, upon going on deck to take a last view 
of the mission, I saw the mountain, at the base of which lies the village, encircled 
with a beautiful rainbow. At King Island Dr. Cali and Engineer Falkenstein went 
on shore to explore a remarkable cave in which the natives store their provisions. 
Providing themselves with ropes, candles, and a lantern, they approached the cave 
in the face of the cliff, a few hunderd feet east of the village. The water extendsin 
some 20 feet from the shore to the mouth of the cave, but, owing to the swell from 
the ocean, the boat could not enter. Hurriedly jumping on the rocks, they clam- 
bered over the sides to the entrance. The first obstacle that confronted them was an 
immense cake of ice, with a perpendicular face, jammed bétween the two sides of 
the entrance, each of which was equally inaccessible for them. After several unsuc- 
cessful attempts to scale it, they appealed to the guide, who clambered over the ice 
with the agility of amonkey and carried theirline with him. Even with the assist- 
ance of the rope they found considerable difficulty in following him. They were 
then in the main chamber of the cave. In height it is 30 or 40 feet, and 25 feet in 
width. The floor was very uneyen and full of holes, Scattered about over this 
slippery surface were strewn the remains of walrus bones, Skins, and blubber. This, 
mixed with the yellow clay, presented a most unfavorabie aspect. In the left- 
hand corner of this immense cavern they saw a hole which could easily be mis- 
taken for an exit to the top of the mountain. To reach it seemed impossible. Re- 
ferring to their guide, he demanded the promise of more pay, in addition to the 
pants which they had agreed to give him ‘for his services, exclaiming with much 
force, ‘‘King Charlie cow-cow pechuk” (King Charlie has but little food). The 
ascent to the hole was found to be almost perpendicular. The first 15 or 20 feet 
were made by means of climbing a rope which the natives had fastened under a 
large rock jammed in the crevice some distance above, and finally overanother bowl- 
der, when they stood in the direct entrance of another part of the cave. Lighting 
their candles and making fast the line, two of them withthe guide descended through 
a narrow crack, the floor of which was solid ice. To assist in coming down, steps 
had been cut out, and the dripping of water from above had formed little pinnacles 
of ice which answered as steps for their feet. Soon they found themselves in a most 
beautiful and interesting part of the cave. The chamber was pyramidal in shape, 
the peaks extending upward 40 or 50 feet. The walls were everywhere covered with 
miniature icicles, moisture frozen in the most fantastic shapes, appearing like a 
mass of diamonds. The floor was solid ice, out of which chambers were excavated 
from 10 to 15 feetin depth and from 6 to10 feet in diameter and used for cold storage. 
_ The party having on skin boots which had become slippery from traveling over the 
ice and grease, were obliged to exercise the greatest precaution to keep from fall- 
ing into these holes. The return was far more difficult and dangerous, but was made 
without any scrious accident. The cave is used by the villagers for the storing of 
walrus, which they kill in winter and use for their food in summer, They were also 
told that it was used at one time as a rendezvous in times of attack from warriors off 
the coast. At present there is no communication between the top of the island or 
the village and the cave, and the cave contained but few pieces of walrus meat. 
At 7:20 p. m. the ship got underway for St. Michael, reaching there at 12:55 p.m., 
September 1. At-St. Michael, Mr. J. E. McGrath, of the U. 8. Coast and Geodetic 
Survey, with W. W. Davis, his assistant, and party of six men, who had been en- 
gaged in the international boundary, survey at the crossing of the Yukon and Por- 
cupine rivers, were waiting for transportation to the south, and were received on 
board. During the day of September 2, while the goods of the exploring party 
were being shipped, a severe gale sprang up, and the ship had to steam out to Egg 
Island for deeper water and shelter. Returning to St. Michael on the 3d, we took 
on board all the surveying party, also Mr. William A. D. Hass, of the Frank Leslie 
exploring expedition, and Mr. U. E. Taggart and James Chaplyn, destitute miners, 
and at 7:15 p. m. the ship was again underway for King Island. At noon, Septem- 
ber 4, we passed Sledge Island, with a northeast gale behind us. The gale increas- 
ing in the evening, the captain hove to, but during the night drifted far north and 
west of King Island. On the morning of the 5th, returning to the island, and find- 
ing it too rough to land, the captain steamed back to Port Clarence for harbor.

About 7:15 a, m, September 6 the ship anchored off King Island, and Capt. Healy 
distributed tc the natives, who were in a starving condition, 100 sacks of flour, 1 
chest of tea, 9 boxes of pilot bread, 6 barrels of bread, and 7 barrels of flour. At 
1:05 p. m. we started for Indian Point, reaching there at 9:15 a.m. on September 7. 
The following week was spent in procuring reindeer, and on the 17th of Septem- 
ber, at 12:10 0 “clock in the morning, we anchored in the large harbor of Unalaska. 
In the harbor were the U.8. 8. Mohican, the Rush, Alki, the American ship Erickson, 
H. B. M.S. Nymphe; also the steamer Costa Rica, from Victoria, also the steamer Dan- 
ube from Victoria, all connected with the Bering Sea difficulty. On the 21st of Sep- 
tember, through the courtesy of Capt. Coulson, commanding, I was received on 
board the revenue steamer Rush, and at 6:45 a. m. on the 22d we weighed anchor for 
San Francisco, reaching there on the forenoon of October 2. On October 3 the start + 
was made for Washington, which was reached on the 8th, having made 16,997 miles 
during the season. 
INTRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC REINDEER. east 
Upon my return to Washington last fall I had the honor on November. 12 to address 
you a preliminary report of ‘the season’s work, emphasizing the destitute condition 
of the Alaskan Eskimo. 
On the 5th of December this report was transmitted by you to the Secretary of the 
‘Interior for his information, and on the 15th transmitted to the Senate by Hon. George 
Chandler, Acting Secretary of the Interior. On the following day it was referred 
by the Senate to the Committee on Education and Labor. 
On the 19th of December, Hon, Louis E. McComas, of Maryland, introduced into 
the House of Representatives a joint resolution (H. R. No. ), providing that the 
act of Congress, approved March 2, 1887, ‘An act to establish agricultural experi- 
ment stations in connection with the colleges established in the several States under 
the provisions of an act approved July 2, 1362, and of the acts supplementary there- 
to” and an act approved August 30, 1890, entitled “An act to apply a portion of the 
proceeds of the public Jands to the more complete endowment and support of the 
colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, established under the 
provisions of an act of Congress approved July 2, 1862,” should be extended by the 
Secretary of the Interior over Alaska, with the expectation that the purchase, im- 
provement, and management of domestic reindeer should be made a part of the indus- 
trial education of the proposed college. 
The resolution was referred to the Committee on Education, and on the 9th of 
January, 1891, reported back to the House of Representatives for passage. 
It was, however, so near the close of the short term of Congress that the resolution 
was not reached. 
When it became apparent that it would not be reached in the usual way, the Hon. 
Henry M. Teller, on the 26th of February moved an amendment to the bill (H. R. 
No, 13462) making appropriations, for sundry civil expenses of the Government for 
the year ending June 30, 1892, appropriating $15,000 for the introduction of domestic 
reindeer into Alaska, which was carried. ‘The appropriation failed to receive the 
concurrence of the conference committee of the House of Representatives. 
Upon the failure of the Fifty-first Congress to take action, and deprecating the 
delay of twelve months before another attempt could be made, with your approval, 
I made an appeal in the Mail and Express of New York City, the Boston Transcript, 
the Philadelphia Ledger, the Chicago Interocean, and Washington Star, as well as 
in a number of the leading religious newspapers of the country, , for contributions to 
this object. The response was s prompt and generous; $2,146 were received. 
As the season had arrived for the usual visit of inspection and supervision of the 
schools in Alaska you were kind enough to direct that in addition to my regular 
work for the schools, I should continue in charge of the work of transplanting do- 
mesticated reindeer from Siberia to Alaska. As the natives of Siberia, who own the 
reindeer, know nothing of the use of money, an assortment of goods for the purpose 
of barter for the reindeer was procured from the funds so generously contributed by 
benevolent people in answer to the appeal through the newspapers. 
The honorable Secretary of the Treasury issued instructions to Capt. Healy to 
furnish me every possible facility for the purchase and transportation of reindeer 
from Siberia to Alaska. The honorable Secretary of State secured from the Russian 
Government instructions to their officers on the Siberian coast, also, to render what 
assistance they could. 
The proposition to introduce domesticated reindeer into Alaska had excited wide- 
spread and general interest. In the public discussions which arose with regard to 
the scheme a sentiment was found in some circles that it was impracticable; ‘that on 
account of the superstitions of the natives they would be unwilling to sell their stock 
alive; further, that the nature of the reindeer was such that he would not bear ship 
transportation, and also that even if they could be purchased and safely transported

the native dogs on the Alaskan coast would destroy or the natives killthem for food. 
This feeling, which was held by many intelligent white men, was asserted so strongly 
and positively that it was thought best the first season to make haste slowly, and 
instead of purchasing a large number of reindeer to possibly die on shipboard, or 
perhaps to be destroyed by the Alaskan dogs (thus at the very outset prejudicing 
the-scheme), it was deemed wiser and safer to buy only a few. 
Therefore, in the time available from other educational duties during the season 
of 1891, it seemed important that 1 should again carefully review the ground and 
secure all possible additional information with regard to the reindeer, and, while 
delaying the actual establishment of a herd until another season, that I should deter- 
mine the correctness of the objections that the natives would not sell and the deer 
would not bear transportation by actually purchasing and transporting them. 
The work was so new and uniried that many things could only be found out*by 
actual experience. 
First. The wild deermen of Siberia are a very superstitious people, and need to 
be approached with great wisdom and tact. f 
Upon one. occasion, when Capt. Healy purchased a few reindeer for food, the fol- 
lowing ceremonies were observed: When getting ready to lasso the deer the owner’s 
family seated themselves in a circle on the ground, where probably some rites con- 
nected with their superstitions were observed. Upon attempting to approach the 
circle, I was motioned away. After a short time the men went out and lassoed a 
selected animal, which was led to one side of the herd. The man that was leading 
him stationed himself directly in front of the animal and held him firmly by the two 
horns. Another, with a butcher knife, stood at the side of the deer. An old man, 
probably the owner, went off to the eastward, and placing his back to the setting 
un seemed engaged in prayer, upon the conclusion of which he turned around and     
  ; Superstitions ceremony connected with killing or selling reindeer in Siberia. 
faced the deer. This was the signal for knifing the animal. With apparently no 
effort, the knife was pushed to the heart and withdrawn. The animal seemed to 
suffer no pain, and in a few seconds sank to his knees and rolled over on his side. 
While this was taking place the old man before mentioned stood erect and motion- 
Jess, with his hand over his‘eyes. When the deer was dead he approached, and 
taking a handful of hair and blood from the wound, impressively threw it to the 
eastward. This was repeated a sccond time. Upon the killing of the second ani- 
mal, the wife of the owner cast the hair and blood to the eastward. 
Since then I have often observed tho:man who was selling a deer pluck some hair 
from the deer and put it in his pocket or throw it to the winds for good luck. 
If a man should sell us a deer, and the following winter an epidemic break ont in 
his herd, or some calamity befall his family, the shamans would make him believe 
that his bad luck was all due to the sale of the deer. 
Second. The Siberian deermen are a nonprogressive people. They have lived for 
ages outside of the activities and progress of the world. \As the fathers did, so 
continue to do their children. 
Now, they have never before beer asked to sell their deer; it is a new thing to 
them, and they do not know what to make of it. They were suspicious of our 
designs. And in reference to this state of mind I have found that being on a Goy- 
ernment vessel has been of great assistance. It impresses the natives with confidence 
that they will be treated honorably and justly. This moral effect was so great that 
we secured results that. otherwise could not have been obtained so easily. 
Then, Capt. Healy, commander of the Bear, is well known for thousands of miles 
on both sides of the coast, and the natives have confidenceinhim. With astranger 
in command I am confident that but little would have been accomplished in the sum- 
mer of 1891.

Purchasing reindeer in Siberia is very different from going to Texas and buying a 
herd of cattle. In ‘Texas suchasale could be consummated in a few minutes or hours. 
But in Siberia it takes both time and patience. 
Upon the anchoring of the ship in the vicinity of a settlement the natives flock 
aboard, bringing skins and fursto exchange for flour, cotton cloth, powder, lead, etc. 
Once aboard they expect to be fed by the captain, and bueket after bucket-of hard 
bread is distributed among them. They know perfectly well that-we are after rein- 
deer, but nothing is said about it. They have to be feasted first. They are never 
in a hurry and therefore do not sée why we should be. 4 
After a little, small:presents are judiciously given to the wife or child ofa leading 
man, and when every one is in good humor a few of the leaders are taken into the 
pilot-house and the main subject is opened. After much discussion and talking all 
  Ran-en-ka. 
[The first Siberian to sell a reindeer for the Alaska herd, 1801, Published by permission of The Cali- fornian.] i 
around the subject one man is ready to sell twenty and another perhaps only two. 
After allis arranged the leading men send their servants off after the deer, which 
may be in the vicinity or four or five days’ journey away. Sometimes these delays 
consume a week or more at a place. 
Another difficulty arises from the fact that they can not understand what we want 
of the reindeer. They have no knowledge of such a motive as doing good to others 
without pay. 
As a rule the men with the largest herds, who can best afford to sell; are inland 
and difficult to reach. 
Then business selfishness comes in. The introduction of the reindeer on the Ameri- 
can side may to some extent injuriously affect their trade in deer skins. From time

immemorial they have been accustomed to take their skins to Alaska and exchange 
them for oil To establish herds in Alaska will, they fear, ruin this business. 
Another difficulty experienced was the impossibility of securing a competent inter- 
reter. 
: A few of the natives of the Siberian coast have spent one or more seasons on a 
whaler,and thus picked up a very little English. And upon this class we haye been 
dependent in the past. 
It is very desirable that a native young man should be secured and trained as an 
interpreter, who could be employed regularly, year after year. 
However, notwithstanding all these difficulties and delays, Capt. Healy with the 
Bear coasted from 1,200 to 1,500 miles, calling at the various villages and holding 
conferences with the leading reindeer owners on the Siberian coast. Arrangements 
were made for the purchase of animals the following season. Then, to answer the 
question whether reindeer could be purchased and transported alive, sixteen were 
  Ko-har-ra, the Richest Native in N. E, Siberia.

purchased, kept on shipboard for some three weeks, passing through a gale so severe 
that the ship had to ‘‘lie to,” and finally landed in good condition at Amaknak 
Island, in the harbor of Unalaska, haying had a sea voyage of over 1,000 miles, 
While at Port Clarence, on July 6 we met a Siberian native who understood a little 
English, having spent a few summers on a whaling ship. His name was Shoofly. 
We secured his services as interpreter to the deermen, but when we were ready to 
sail he was not to be found. 
At 6:25 p.m. on July 9, leaving our anchorage off the village of Cape Prince of Wales, 
wwe started for Asia. Swinging around by Fairway Rock, we sailed through Bering 
Straits north of the Diomede Islands, reaching the village at East Cape Siberia at 1:20 
on the morning of the 9th. Coming upon deck I found that many natives had come 
aboard. Among them was one that had a little smattering of English. Inquiries 
were immediately made for reindeer. We had been informed that we would find 
some deermen at East Cape, but now that we had reached the place we were 
     
-P-A-G-E-301
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 949 
informed that there were very small heards around them, but that north, at Cape 
Serdze Kamen, 100 miles distant on the Arctic coast, there were large herds. Last ~ 
season, having made inquiries at the native village at Indian Point, and receiving 
assurances that they would sell deer, and there being a number of natives at that 
point that understood some English, the captain concluded to go there first. Con- 
sequently, at 9:30 a.m., the anchor was weighed, and we started for the point, 150 
miles south. Around us was a field of floating ice, through which we had to pick 
our way. 
At 2.30 p. m. we were at Cape Nuniagmo, that marks the northern entrance to St. 
Lawrence Bay. In this bay, during the winter of 1881-82, the U. 8. 8. Rogers, which 
had been sent in search of the Jeannette, burned to the water’s edge. At 4 p.m. we 
passed Cape Krleougoune, the southern headland of St. Lawrence Bay, back of which 
snowy mountains rise 3,407 feet. This high and steep cape is crowned with a cluster 
of sharp peaks, which makes it a noted landmark. At8 p.m. Cape Nygtchigane 
came iv view with eight or ten snow-covered peaks clustered back of it in a semi- 
circle. Seniavine Straits to the southwest, lying between the main coast and Ara-

kamtchetchene Island, were still closed with ice. These straits were named after 
his ship by Capt. Lutke, the explorer. It is remarkable that these straits, as well 
as St. Lawrence Bay, are deeper than the adjacent sea. This depth is separated 
from the shallower, open sea by a bank that has still less water upon it, so that 
soundings first decrease and then increase when approaching the coast. At 3 o'clock 
on the morning of July 10 we anchored off Indian Point. ‘The village had been vis- 
ited by twenty-four whalers previous to our arrival. Soon a number of the natives 
came on board, among them being Ko-har-ra, the leading man of the village. After 
breakfast the captain and myself hada long conference with him’ concerning the 
purchase of reindeer, and a proposition was made to take his whole herd of one hun- 
dred. He declined our offer, pleading as an excuse that he was keeping his herd for 
a time of need; that if, any season, the walrus and seal should fail him, he would 
need his herd to keep the people of the village from starving. He offered to make 
the captain a present of two, but would not sellany. Finally, we came down in our 
requests, but received no encouragement. 
_About 11 o’clock the party abruptly took their departure, Ko-har-ra claiming that

he wished to consult his son. In the afternoon, with several of the officers, I went 
onshore to visit the village. At the highest part of the ridge, parallel to the north- 
ern beach, were ruins of from twenty-five to thirty old houses, the frames of which 
had been constructed of the lower jaw-bene of the whale. In Ko-har-ra’sstorehouse, 
which was the only frame house in the village, I counted 200 sacks of flour-and 80 
boxes of tobacco; also a head of walrus, bone, worth from $5,000 to $8,000. Another 
interview was had with Ko-har-ra, which resulted in his refusing to sell any-of his . 
deer. In the evening another party came aboard, from whom we received some hope 
that we might:be able to purchase a few the following September, when they would 
be driven down to the coast in Penkegnti Bay, on Senavine Straits. They all testified 
that but few could be had in that neighborhood, but that along the shores of Holy 
Cross Bay, at the head of Anadyr Gulf, there were large numbers of reindeer close to 
the beach. No one expressed a doubt oran intimation of the natives being unwill- 
ing to sell, through superstitious notions, but somehow or.other we failed to get any. 
But the people otf the region, so far visited, only owned small bands, ranging from 
twenty-live to one hundred, and they did not wish to part with them. 
We were aiso at a great Uisadvantago in our communications with them for the 
want of asuitableinterpreter. The natives could not comprehend why we wanted 
them. Several of them expressed their opinion that the deer would not live on St 
Lawrence Island, where weat that timeintended to place them. They also claimed 
that the deer would not go over forty-eight hours without food, and wanted to know 
what we intended feeding them onthe ship while in transit. However, that night, 
from the last party of visitors, we secured, through Capt. Healy, an old man and a 
boy as interpreters, who agreed to accompany us to Holy Cross Bay. Early the next 
morning our interpreters appeared on deck to decline going, saying that they were 
afraid, alleging that if the ship should go to Holy Cross Bay and not find any deer- 
men on the beach, or if the natives should refuse to sell their deer, or if the bay 
should be full of ice so that the ship could not get in, the captain would be angry 
and accuse them of lying tohim. After repeated assurances of the captain that he 
would not hold them responsible, they went ashore after their clothes and blankets, 
which they brought off in a hairsealskin bag. 
At 11:30 a.m. on July 11-we got under way for Holy Cross Bay, 300 miles inland 
in Siberia. From Indian Point the coast of Siberia trends in a general southwest 
direction to Cape Choukotzki and then turns sharply to the northw At this 
_ cape commences the Gulf of Anadyr, whose, entrance across to Cape Thaddeus is 200 
miles. Counting the distance across the entrance the gulf has a circuit of 420 miles, 
and at its northwest extremity is the Bay of Holy Cross, with a circuit of 180 miles, 
its northern shore being within 10 miles of the Arctic Circle. At 8 p.m. we were off 
the entrance of Ployer Bay, where the British ship Plover, Capt. Moore command- 
ing, in search of Sir John Franklin, wintered in 1848~49. In view of the necessity 
of transporting the reindeer so great a distance, should we secure any at Holy 
Cross Bay, the question of food was carefully considered. We had confidently ex- 
pected to secure them near Indian Point, only a few hours’ sail from St. Lawrence 
Island, in which case there would beno need of feeding them; butif we secured any 
at Holy Cross Bay it would require a trip of from thirty to forty-eight hours, and in 
that case thé food question became important. An inventory of the stores on board 
revealed some 10} pounds of oatmeal in the captain’s pantry, 24 pounds in the offi- 
cers’ mess, afew pounds in the engineer’s department, and about 60 pounds in the sail- 
ors’ stores. It was agreed to purchase these and mix with the drinking water of the 
animals 1f secured. - 
At 8:45 o’clock a. m. on July 2 we were off Cape Bering in a fog, when ice sud- 
denly appeared under the bows of the-ship, and the heart of the officer on deck stood 
still, thinking that he was ashore. Wethen entered alarge field of broken ice. 
speed was slowed down and several hours were spent in picking our way through 
the ice. In the afternoon clear water was again reached, and at 5:35 p. m., there 
being no evidence of land and the fog continuing thick, the anchor was let goin 11 
fathoms of water. The next day continuing rainy and foggy, the ship continued at 
anchor until 8:20 p. m., when the wind increased and the captain concluded tomake 
an effort to get inside of Holy Cros We were in the proximity of land, in 
strange waters, with imperfect charts. he ship was surrounded with floating ice; 
the night was very dark, with a cold, driving rain storm, and we almost ran ashore. 
However, we got inside and were at anchor about midnight. Holy Cross Bay was 
first entered by a vessel in 1827, when Capt. Lutke made a reconnoissance. Proba- 
bly the Bear was the first steamer ever 10 plow its waters. re 
About 10 o’clock on the morning of the 14th three or four umniaks full of natives 
came off from a village of sixteen tents or yourts on the sandy beach. They were 
all large-sized and a healthy but dirty looking set. The afternoon was spent in 
securing fresh water for the ship. Diligent inquiries were made for reindeer, and 
two men were found who sold five each, but their deer were on the west side of the 
bay, which could not be reached until the ice should move, and the ice would not 
moye until the wind changed. For ten days, the wind had been in the east and

southeast and kept the ice piled up against the west shore. Just as we were finish- 
ing breakfast on the morning of the 15th the announcement was made that a “pod” 
of walrus was visible. Going upon deck, some fifty or more Were seen swimming 
ina line toward the ship. A boat was at once lowered and the captain and surgeon 
with a boat’s crew started to intercept them. Several were shot, but only two se- 
cured. A baby walrus weighing about 500 pounds was also shot, but while getting 
it into the boat the rope slipped and the animal went to the bottom as if it were 
made of lead. Three umniaks came off from shore and were sent out to help bring 
in the walrus. When brought to the side they were hoisted by the steam windlass 
on deck, The skin and hides were preserved and the carcasses divided up among 
the natives. The heart and liver were reserved for eating on the ship and proved 
to be very palatable. The walrus episode helped pass away the day. % 
After a tedious wait for better weather, on the 17th of July anchor was weighed 
at4:10a.m. A few minutes afterwards we entered the ice, into which we pushed 
until we came abreast of a Tuchtchi village on the west side of the bay, where the 
ship dropped anchor. The ice floe causing the anchor to drag, it was again hoisted 
up and we steamed a few miles farther north throughehe ice, anchoring at 9:30 a.m. 
in comparatively clear water. A boatin charge of Lieut. Jarvis was started toward 
the shore, but the wind freshening and the sea being rough, the captain recalled the 
boat with the steam whistle. Parties of natives were seen on shore, but none came 
off through the ice to the steamer. After breakfast on the morning of the 18th we 
made another attempt to reach shore. Moving cautiously through a large field of 
floating ice we at length got on terra firma, and a walk of 4 or 5 miles brought us to 
two native huts. Upon reaching them we found only the women and children at 
home, the men having passed us on the way to the ship. We therefore retraced 
our steps to the beach and signaled fora boat. Returning to the ship we found 
two umniak loads of natives on board. One of them agreed to furnish us next year 
twenty-five deer at the rate of five fora rifle and twenty for a whale boat. They 
promised us that they would secure some two hundred head for us the following 
season, driving them down to the beach the middle of July. 
Having accomplished everything that we could, at 8 p.m. anchor was weighed 
and the ship steamed out through the drifting ice. The natives sat a little way off 
in their umniaks, watching the movements of the first steamer that many of them 
had ever seen. During the night the vessel plowed through fields of heavy ice from 
Cape Spanberg to Cape Tchingan. The coast was bold and beautiful, consisting of 
perpendicular rocks. On the evening of the 17th we passed two or three small 
Tchutchi villages, the largest of which was at John Howland Bay. At 10 o’clock 
the sunset was remarkably fine. Another hour brought us to anchorage in Plover 
Bay, but the fog became so thick that the captain did not venture to attempt to 
make the bay, but lay off at sea all night. At3a.m., July 20, the fog lifted and the 
ship made for Plover Bay, which is a fiord about 2 miles wide and 20 miles long, 
extending into the very heart of the mountains, whose precipitous sides rise to the 
height of from 1,200 to 1,500 feet. Passing between Capes Lessouski and Bald Head, 
sailing past a small village situated on the sand spit and around Cape Haidmak, the 
northwest side of the spit, the ship anchored in Providence Harbor at6:30a.m. This 
little landlocked bay was named by the commander, Moore, of H.M. ship Plover, 
who visited it first in search of Sir John Franklin. A short distance up the bay is 
Emma Harbor, where he wintered his ship in 184849. Above Emma Harbor on the 
eer side of the bay is Cape Theodorof, overtopped by Mount Kennicott, 2,343 feet ~ 
igh. 
At the upper end. of the bay in 1866 the Western Union Telegraph expedition 
erected a house and established a station, it being their purpose to run a land wire 
across the cape, connecting the proposed cable across Bering Straits with another 
across Anadyr Gulf. Overlooking our anchorage and almost toppling over uson the east 
side of the bay was Mount Slavianka, 1,427 feet high. During the summer of 1866, 
while awaiting supplies at this bay, Mr. R. J. Bush, in the employ of the telegraph 
company, says that one day, seeing a party of natives gathered upon the bleak bar- 
ren mountain side back of the village, curiosity led a party from the ship to visit” 
the spot. They found about forty people present, of all ages down to babies. They 
were laughing as if ata picnic. On a small level spot had been constructed an 
oblong line of stones about 6 feet in length. Near by a reindeer had been killed 
and the party of women were sprinkling the stones with handfuls of tobacco and 
choice bits of deer meat, as if they were making a sacrifice to their gods. One of 
the natives who had learned a little English of the whalers was called one side and 
asked what was going on. Pointing to an old man in the group, he said, “Old man 
no got eyes. Byme-by kill um.” “But why do you kill him?” was asked. “Old 
man like it. Old man plenty of deer, Last year old man’s son die. He plenty like 
um son. He want die too; he want Tchutchi man kill um. All right. Old man 
pitkininy (grandson) no want to killum. To-day Tchutchi kill um.” “It is bad,
-P-A-G-E-304
  952 EDUCATION REPORT, aot 
very bad,” one of the party replied. “No bad,” he said. ‘Tchutchi plenty like 
um. All same every fellow. Byme-by me get old. Kill me, too. All same.” 
It seemed that a day had previously been fixed by the old man to die, but he had 
yielded to the importunities of his grandson, who had begged him to live for his 
sake. In some cases the old person is first made insensible by inhaling something. 
They are then stoned, speared, or bled to death, as the case may be. ‘This was simi- 
Tar to the experience of Capt. Healy, who, upon one of his trips to the Arctic, was 
inquiring the whereabouts of a native whom he had met upon former trips. Meet- 
ing a companion, he said to him, ‘‘ Where is Charlie now?” “Charlie?” he replied; 
“JT shot him last year.” ‘Shot him? How was that?” “Why, Charlie and I were 
great friends. He was taken very sick. One day he sent his boy over to ask me to 
come to see him and to bring my gun along. When I went to see him he said that 
-he could not get well and wanted me to shoot him. I did not want to. He was my 
friend. So I told him he would be better ina few days, and tried to encourage him; 
but he wanted me as his friend to shoot him to put him out of his misery. To put 
him off I told him that if he did not get better in a few days he couid send for me 
again and I would come over and shoot him. 
“(Tn a few days his boy came to my house and saidhis father was no better. He 
wanted me as his friend to come and shoot him. So I went over and shot him.” It 
seems a very common practice among some of the tribes, when a person has an incur- 
« able disease or becomes too old for further service in procuring the necessities of life, 
to killhim. The conditions of life are so hard, the difficulties of feeding the well 
so great, that no supernumeraries can be allowed in their homes. Last season, visit- 
ing several thousands of miles of this Arctic and semi-Arctic coast, and meeting with 
thousands of natives, I met with hut one old person. This season I met but two. 
The almost entire absence of aged persons among the population confirms the accounts 
of the custom of killing the old and infirm. There are years when the fish fail to 
come in their usual number, when the winter supply of walrus and seal fail them, 
and thenstarvation stares them in the face during the long Arctic winter. During 
the sojourn of the Western Union Telegraph Company in that country in 1866 and 
1867, Mr. Bush speaks of one of these periodic famines, in which, as early as October, 
the people had begun to boil their deerskins into soup. Many of these natives 
sought his.advice and assistance. One said, ‘‘ You know, sir, the winter has hardly 
begun. I have a wife and seven children and seven dogs to support, and not a pound 
of meat or fish to give them. But I have some deerskins and eight fathoms of thong 
that I can boilup. But these are not sufficient to sustain the family and the dogs 
too until the Tchutchi come with their reindeer.’ I do not know where to get more 
food, as my neighbors are starving too.” 
With hesitation and a faltering voice he added, “If my children perish I will 
have my dogs left, but if my dogs die how can I go to the Tchutchi to get deer? 
Thenmy family will starve too, and thenI will have neither family nor dogs,” What 
he wanted Mr. Bush to decide was whether it was wiser for him to let his children 
or sled dogs starve, for if the latter starved it would involve the starvation of the 
whole family. He was advised to try and keep both aslongaspossible. Occasionally 
an instance of this destitution and starvation comes under the eye of an intelligent 
white man and is given to the world. But these periodic seasons of starvation come 
and go, and hundreds of human beings starve and die, their fate unheeded and 
unknown by the great world outside. To the starving natives of Siberia there is 
always the possibility of the then who own herds of domestic reindeer hearing of their 
straits and coming to theirrelief. Buton the Alaska side, where as yet are no herds of 
domestic reindeer to fall back upon in the dark days of dire necessity, there is noth- 
ing left the people but to starve and die. May the day be hastened when the efforts 
now making to introduce the domestic reindeer of Siberia into Alaska shall be 
crowned with success and this dying people saved from utter extinction. In nego- 
tiating for the purchase of reindeer on the Siberian coast we constantly met with 
men owning small herds of from five to one hundred animals. Frequent attempts 
were made to‘buy these men out, but those along the coast steadily refused to sell, 
on the plea that they must keep their deer for a time of need; that some years they 
got no walrus or seal (their principal living) and then would need the deer to keep 
their families from starving. 
The day at Plover Bay was spent in watering ship, the water being procured from 
a mountain stream that came out from under a snow bank. After the ship was 
watered the sailors were sent ashore to wash their clothes. Two of the leading 
natives were interested and promised good pay if during the coming wiuater they 
would communicate with the deer men and have a number of the reindeer on the 
coast for purchase the following season. It was the inténtion to leave the harbor 
on the morning of the 21st, but a dense fog having settled down and a storm having 
set in, we were fog-bound in the harbor for the three following days. On the 24th, 
he fog having lifted sufficiently to see our way out of the harbor, the anchor wast 
weighed, and we started at 8.20 a.m. Passing around Bald ‘Head, we were soon

abreast of a village of a dozen huts at the mouth of the small creck that connects’ 
Lake Moore with the sea. From the sea the hill to the rear of the village presented 
a beautiful green. Soon after passing the village the fog again closed down and 
we sailed apparently through space, seeing nothing until, in the afternoon, St. Law- 
rence Island was seen dimly looming up through the fog. At 5.15 p.m. anchor was 
let go, and after dinner Lieut. Jarvis and Dr. Call and the interpreter and myself 
went ashore. After making a circuit of the village and consulting: several groups 
of the natives, I decided to locate the school building at the eastern end of the vil- 
lage, near the lake. Accordingly, stakes were driven for the guidance of the car- 
penter who was daily expected with the materials for tho building which had been 
shipped on the schooner from San Francisco. Returning to the ship, Capt. Healy 
bantered one of the Shamans to show his powers. He replied that he could do 
nothing on shipboard. So we proposed to accompany him on shore, the captain 
him a present of some powder, lead, and tobacco. With the rattling of a 
native drum and the monotonous hi-yah-hah chorus of women he pretended to suck 
from the flesh of Dr. Call a piece of sponge and a second time a piece of walrus hide. 
He then attempted to have two men strangle him with a rope, but could not make 
it work. An assistant Shaman then took up the performance, and held an inch 
board 18 inches by 3 feet in size to his mouth by suction. He also allowed his hands 
to be manacled behind his back and then work them through and in some way got 
the manacles off. It was rather a tame affair. 
At 2:15 on the morning of July 25 we again got under way, reaching Indian Point 
at 9 o’clock. The two interpreters that we had had with us for the last two weeks 
left the ship and returned home. 
About noon we again got under way for the Arctic, returning thence on the 
27th of August. During a dense fog at.9 o’clock in the morning we picked up 
three umniak loads of Siberians, and found that we were near Enchowan, on the 
Arctic coast of Siberia, where we dropped anchor at 10:30 a.m. Lieut. Jarvis and 
Dr. Call were sent ashore to visit the herd, and the next day four deer were deliv- 
ered to us on board the ship. A large number were offered us, but having failed in 
procuring herders, and having no place ready to receive the deer, and not knowing 
whether we could procure food such as they would eat, we thought it prudent to 
experiment first with the four. At 1:40 p.m. August 28, 1891, the first reindeer was 
hoisted on board the ship, and thus one of the objections which we had found made, 
that reindeer could not be purchased alive, was answered by actually purchasing 
and receiving them. A second objection, that they could not be safely transported, 
remained to be decided. Anchor was weighed at 12:30 midnight, and at 4:30 onthe 
morning of the 29th we anchored at Whalen. The landing being bad, we got under 
way at 7:20, passing through Bering Straits at noon, and at 6:30 p.m. anchored off 
Cape Prince of Wales. Not wishing to carry our trade goods back to San Francisco, 
I consigned a number of them to Messrs, Lopp and Thornton for safe-keeping until 
the following year. 
During the night, the sea becoming rough, the captain stopped the landing of 
goods until the morning of the 30th, when they were safely landed. 
At 9:20 on the morning of the 30th we again got under way, going to St. Michael, 
and returning to Indian Point, Siberia, on the 7th of September, where we anchored 
at 9:15 a.m. 
At 4:25 the next morning, having taken on board Koharra, the leading deer man 
at the village, and two interpreters, we got under way for Senayine Straits. At 
5:45_we passed Cape Mertens, a high, steep, mountain, with three summits, 1,014 
fect high. This cape forms the southern limit of Tchetchikouyoume Bay.’ At 6:12 
a.m. we passed between Nouneangan, a small rocky islet rising perpendicularly 
from the sea 80 feet, then sloping up to an elevation of 386 feet, and Tchirklook, an 
island 6 by 3 miles in extent, and crowned with a number of peaks ranging from 500 
to 1,800 feet hign. Rounding the northeastern end of this island, we steamed 
through Yerguine Pass, and at 7:13 a. m. entered Senavine Straits. These straits 
are a body of water 30 miles long and from one-half mile to 6 miles wide, lying be- 
tween the mainland on the west and the Arakamtchetchene and Tchirklook islands 
on the east. The opening had been noticed by Bering, Cook, and Sarytscheff, but 
Capt. Lutke was the first to explore it. It was named after his ship. At 7:28 a.m. 
we wererounding Cape Paguelune, the southwest point of Arakamtchetchene Island. 
This island is 16 by 8 miles in extent, and contains several small native settlements. 
Jt has several high peaks, the greatest elevation of which is Tinmai, 1,809 feet high, 
A southeast storm setting in, at 8:30 a.m, the captain turned southward, and at 
10:30 anchored in Glasenapp Harbor, under Cape Yerguine, for shelter. The harbor 
is well sheltered from all winds and sea, and convenient for procuring water, quite 
a blessing in this region. Glad enough were we to find safe anchorage here from 
the storm and rough water in Senavine Straits. 
While lying here some five or six natives boarded the vessel. They had hardly 
Janded on deck before they began their incessant pleading for ‘“ Kow-kow” (bread). 
   
-P-A-G-E-306

A bucket of bread was given them and a shelter from the storm profered if they desired to remain with us. The captain engaged them to gather reindeer moss for

the animals he had on board. These natives embraced the opportunity readily to earn a few biscuits of hard bread. Having gone ashore, they returned in a very short

space of time with a dozen well-filled sacks of reindeer moss. Understanding that 
the island was well covered with reindeer food, the captain made inquiry of the 
interpreters why these natives did not have reindeer. He was given the following 
rather romantic narrative of these now poor, miserable, half-starved people and out- 
casts from the Eskimo and neighboring tribes: 
“A very long time.ago, before my father wasa boy, the people on this island had 
plenty of deer, more deer than we can count on our fingers and toes together; a heap 
more. In those days these people were never hungry. They did not steal then, 
either, but now they are always hungry, and if not sharply watched will steal- 
plenty very quick.” 
Thenext question asked was, “ How did they lose their deer, and why do they stay in 
aplace that gives themsolittletoeat?” ‘Well, before my father was a boy these peo- 
ple had plenty of deer. Yardgidigan, the chief, was a rich man, all the same as you 
(referring to the captain). He wanted a wife, There were none on the island or in any 
of thencighboring settlements that came up to the requirements of this rich, fastidious, 
and powerful deer man, Harnessing his finest and fastest deer team, he started on 
a matrimonial prospecting tour among the deer men of the interior. A report being 
current that a deer man named Omileuth, living far up in the mountainous region 
of Siberia, possessed a daughter of rare and wonderful beauty, that excelled in 
all the arts of making shoes and clothes and looking after the creature comforts of 
him who would be her husband—with whom none in Siberia could compare. He 
sought and found this wonderful woman, and in dué course of time was the success- 
ful wooer among many suitors. The nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and 
feasting by the girl’s people, and the happy couple started for their future home 
accompanied by alarge herd of reindeer, the father’s gift and the bride’s dower. 
Bride, groom, and deer arrived home without accident, their journey having been 
one continued round of feasting. 
“On the homeward journey the groom wasso generous with his wife’s property that 
at the very beginning of their married life a cloud of mistrust. came over the bride. 
Among those who accompanied the bridal pair-on their home journey were many of 
the rejected suitors. One, in particular, Tenisken, the chief of Marcus Bay, who, 
prior to the coming of the bridegroom, was the favored suitor, and still was the 
maiden’s choice. Consumed with jealousy, he let no opportunity slip that gave the 
slightest chance of poisoning the young wife’s mind against her husband. Upon 
their arrival at the home of the groom the feast and dance were again the order of 
the ds Wrestling and other athletic sports were indulged in far into the winter. 
Yardyidigan was proud of his beautiful wife. Being extremely happy and secure 
in his leve, he heeded not the warnings to beware of his rival, Tenisken, chief of 
Marcus Bay. Tenisken lingered many months in the bridegroom’s camp, enjoying 
every hospitality that a rich and happy husband could bestow. At length he took 
his departure, and the bridegroom awoke one morning to find that his wife of a few 
moons had disappeared with his friend and fellow-chief. Pursuit was-immediately 
ordered and dreadful vengeance vowed upon the destroyer of his peace of mind and 
betrayer of his house and home. As swift as were the pursuers, swifter still was the 
flight of the guilty pair. 
“Arriving at Marcus Bay, the pair were warmly welcomed by the villagers, who 
upheld their chief and his guilty bride. To him they thought she rightfully be- 
longed by the right of love divine. The husband, through spies, discovered the state 
of things in the enemy’s camp and knew that his vengeance must be sought by 
stealth. Long he watched, concealed near Tenisken’s camp. At last the anxiously 
-formoment arrived. During the prevalence of one of those storms that only 
n the Arctic (and thatseldom), he, with a stone in his hand anda knife be- 
tween histeeth, sought thecamp. Entering the house of his enemy, ho was rendered 
still more furious by the sight of his beautiful and faithless bride lying in the em- 
brace of histival. Bw 2 his knife deep into the heart of his enemy, he offered 
him the greatest indignity that can be put upon an Eskimo—bit off his nese. Forei- 
bly carrying his faithless wife out-of the house, he took her back to his camp. 
Not until morning were the people of Marcus Bay aware of the tragedy that had 
been enacted in their midst. Pursuit and retaliation were ordered. ‘The son of the 
murdered chief headed the party. The wronged husband, having tarried too long 
near his enemy’s camp for vengeance, had so exhausted his supplies of men and beasts 
as to render him able to make but short stages homeward and to offer slight resist- 
ance if attacked. This weakened condition of Yardgidigan’s was made known to 
the son of Tenisken by the faithless wife, who promised at a certain day and desig- 
nated place to make her lord and master drunk and stupefied from ‘toad-stool’ wine. 
This she did. And when the followers of her husband were lying drunk, at a given 
signal from her, the whole encampment were put to death, and the faithless and cruel 
woman led back to Marcus Bay amid great rejoicing and as the bride of her para- 
mour’s son. Now was planned the extermination of the colony on that island. They 
had not heard of the fate of Tardgidigan, theirchief. Sounder disguise the Marcus -

Bay people entered their village, killed most of their people, drove away every deer, 
and razed their houses to the ground. Purposely they spared a few lives, upon 
whom the shaman (native priest) pronounced a fearful anathema. 
“This happened many generations ago, yet the people dare not and will not, for 
fear of a similar fate, imperil their hopes for present and future happiness by asso- 
ciating with these poor, wretched outcasts, accursed by the shaman perhaps:a hun- 
dred years ago. So from affluence and plenty they and their offspring have been 
reduced to want and misery, and will so endure, until they shall cease to exist, on 
account of the perfidy of a woman, who by her beauty and sophistry prejudiced 
priests and populace against her outraged and lawful husband and his people, mak- 
ing right appear wrong and wrong right.” 
* After the interpreters had completed their story both ina breath remarked, ‘ Cap- 
tain, that is hard luck—before, plenty; now, all the time hungry.” 
The storm having abated, on September 9 we again got under way about 11 o’clock. 
Steaming up Senavine Straits, at 1:30 we came to anchor off Cape Yagnakinone, 
Siberia, where Koharra and his party were sent ashore for deer. On the following 
day, the sea becoming rough, we returned to Glasenapp Harborforrefuge. The storm 
abating on the 12th of September, at 5:15 a, m. anchor was weighed, and we again 
started for Cape Yagnakinone. There we secured twelve additional reindeer. Early 
on the morning of September 13 the natives were sent ashore, and at 9 a. m. we got 
under way for Unalaska, where we arrived on the 17th of September. - 
On the 21st of September seven of the reindeer were put ashore on Unalaska Island 
and the other nine on Amaknak Island, in charge of Mr. Ney B. Anthony, United 
States deputy marshal. 
Thus the results of the investigations and work for 1891 with regard to reindeer 
were: 1. The cultivation of the good will of the Siberians and foundations laid for 
future purchases; 2, the actual purchase of sixteen reindeer; 3, the proving by 
actual experience that reindeer can be transported with the same facility as other 
domestic cattle, the sixteen in charge having been safely loaded, kept on shipboard 
three weeks, and landed in good condition a thousand miles away. 
It having been proved by experience that reindeer can be purchased and trans- 
ported, the general introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska becomes a mere 
question of time and money. 
With the accomplishment of this result several important objects will be attained. 
PERMA 
  NT FOOD SUPPLY. 
In the first place, the population, which is now upon the verge of starvation, will 
be furnished with a permanent, regular, and abundant supply of food. As has al- 
ready been stated, the native supply of food in that region has been destroyed by the 
industries of the white men. The whale and the walrus, that once teemed in their 
waters and furnished over half their food supply, have been killed or driven off by 
the persistent hunting of the whalers. The wild reindeer (caribou) and fur-bear- 
ing animals of the land, which also furnished them food and clothing, are being 
largely destroyed by the deadly breech-loading firearm. It will be impossible to re- 
stock their waters with whale and walrus in the same way that we restock rivers 
with a fresh supply of fish. But what we can not give them back their former food, 
we can, through the introduction of the domestic reindeer, provide anew food 
supply. 4 
Upon our return southward from the Arctic Ocean in the fall of 1891 Capt. Healy 
providentially called at the village on King Island, where we found the population 
starving. The appeal for food was so pressing that the captain detailed a lieuten- 
ant to make a thorough examination of the village, and invited me to accompany him 
In a few houses we found that the families in their great distress had_ killed their 
sled dogs to keep themselves from starving. In the larger number of families they 
were making a broth of seaweed, their only food supply. In all human probability, 
if the syip had not learned their condition, the following summer not a man, woman, 
or child would have been left alive to tell the story. A few years ago the same 
» thing happened to three large villages on the island of St. Lawrence, and when, the 
following season, the revenue cutter called at the villages, the putrefying corpses of 
the population were found everywhere—on the bed platforms, on the floors, in the 
door ways, and along the paths, wherever death overtook them. 
In 1891 one of the teachers on the Kuskokwim River wrote me that the inhabitants 
of that valley had had but little opportunity during the summer of 1890 to provide a 
sufficient food supply of fish; that consequently starvation faced them all winter, and 
that it was with great difficulty that they survived until the fish returned the fol- 
lowing season. A teacher on the Yukon River reported this past summer that some 
of the natives to the north of him had starved to death. This same scarcity of food 
exists across the entire northern portion of North America, so that now, under the 
auspices of the Church of England, subscriptions have been opened in London for a 
famine fund, out of which to send relief to the starving Eskimo of Arctic British

America, This condition of things will go on, increaséng in severity from year to 
year, until the food supply of the seas and of the land is entirely gone, and then there 
is nothing left but the extermination of the native population. The general intro- 
duction of the domestic reindeer alone will change this entire condition of things, 
and furnish as reliable asupply of food to that people as the herds of cattle in Texas 
and Wyoming do to their owners or the herds of sheep in New Mexico and Arizona. 
The reindeer is the animal which God’s providence seems to have provided for those 
northern regions, being food, clothing, house, furniture, implements, and. transpor- 
tation to the people. Its milk and flesh furnish food. Its marrow, tongue, and hams 
are considered choice delicacies. Its blood mixed with the contents of its stomach 
forms a favorite native dish. Its‘intestines are cleaned, filled with tallow, and eaten 
as sausage. Itsskin is made into clothes, bedding, tent covers, reindeer harness, ropes, 
cords, and fish lines. The hard skin of the forelegs makes an excellent covering for 
snowshoes. Its sinews are made into a strong and lasting thread. Its bones are 
soaked in seal oil and burned for fuel. I¢s horns are made into various kinds of house- 
hold implements, into weapons for hunting, fishing, or war, and used in the manu- 
facture of sleds. Then the living animal is trained for riding and dragging of sleds. 
The general introduction of such an animal into that region will arrest the present 
starvation and restock that vast country with a permanent food supply. It will 
revive hope in the hearts of a sturdy race that is now rapidly passing away. Surely, 
the country that sends shiploads of grain to starving Russians, that has never turned 
a deaf ear to the call of distress in any section of the globe, will not begrudge a few 
thousand dollars for the purchase and introduction of this Siberian reindeer and the 
rescue of thousands of people from starvation. 
REPEOPLING THE COUNTRY, 
In the second place, the introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska will not only 
thus arrest the present starvation, but will assist in increasing the population. 
-With a more generous food supply this population will commence to increase in 
numbers. Occupying a region whose climatic conditions are so rigorous that but 
few white men will ever be willing to make their permanent home in it, it is im- 
portant, if we would save it from being an unpeopled waste and howling wilder- 
ness, that we build up the people who through generaticns have become acclimated 
and who are as fervently attached to their bleak and storm-swept plains as the people 
of temperate and torrid zones to their lands of comfort and abundance. 
They are a race worth saving. I find that public opinion, gained perhaps by a 
more familiar knowledge of the Eskimo of Greenland and Labrador, conceives that 
the Alaska Eskimos are of the same small type. But this is not true. 
In the extreme north, at Point Barrow and along the coast of Bering Sea, they are 
of medium size. At Point Barrow the average height of the males is 5 feet 3 inches 
and average weight 153 pounds; of the women, 4 feet 11 inches and weight 135 
pounds. On the Nushagak River the average weight of the men is from 150 to 167 
pounds. From Cape Prince of Wales to Icy Cape and on the great inland rivers 
emptying into the Arctic Ocean they are, a large race, many of them being 6 feet 
and over in height. At Kotzebue Sound I have met a number of men and women 6 
feet tall. Physically they are very strong, with great powers of endurance. When 
on a journey, if food is scarce, they will travel 30 or 40 miles without breaking their 
fast. Lieut. Cantwell, in his explorations of the Kowak River, makes record that 
upon one occasion when he wanted a heavy stone for an anchor a woman went out 
and alone rolled into her birch-bark canoe and brought him a stone that would weigh 
800 pounds. It took two strong men to lift it out of the canoe. 
Another explorer speaks of a woman carrying off on her shoulder a box of lead 
weighing 280 pounds. This summer, in erecting the school buildings in the Arctic, 
there being no drays or horses in that country, all the timbers, lumber, hardware, 
etc., had to be carried from the beach to the site of the house on the shoulders of the 
people. They pride themselves on their ability to outjump or outrun any of our 
race who have competed with them. They can lift a heavier weight, throw a heavy 
weight farther, and endure more than we. They are a strong, vigorous race, fitted 
for peopling and subduing the frozen regions of their home. 
Arctic and sub-Arctic Alaska cover an empire in extent equal to nearly all Europe. 
With the covering of those vast plains with herds of domesticated reindeer it will + 
be possible to support in comparative comfort a population of 100,000 people where 
now 20,000 people have a precarious support. To bring this about is worthy the fos- 
tering care of the General Government.   
CIVILIZATION OF THE ESKIMOS. 
Thirdly, the introduction of domestic reindecr is the commencement of the eleya- 
tion of this race from barbarism to civilization. A change from the condition of

hunters to. that of herders is a long step upwards in the seale of civilization, teaching 
them to provide for the futnre by new methods. . 
Probably no greater returns can befound in this country from the expenditure of 
the same amount of money than in lifting up this native race out-of barbarism by 
the introduction of reindeer and education. 
ARCTIC TRANSPORTATION. 
« 
Fourthly, the introduction of the domestic reindeer will solve the question of 
Arctic transportation. The present transportatign of that region is by dog sleds. 
One load of supplies for the trader or traveler requires a second load of food 
for the two teams of dogs, and they make but short distances per day. This 
difficulty of transportation has been one great drawback to the development of the 
country. It has interfered with the plans of the fur trader; it has interfered with 
Government exploration. Only three years ago when the U.S. Coast and Geodetic 
Survey sent two parties to determine the international boundary between Alaska 
and British America the small steamer that was conveying the supplies up the Yukon 
River was wrecked, and it was with the utmost difficulty that the surveying parties 
- were kept from starvation because of the difficulty of sending sufficient food 2,000 
mifes.along that great valley by dog sleds. If reindeer had been introduced into the 
cozntry there would have been no such difficulty in furnishing food. Bills have 
been before Congress for several years proposing to establish a military post in the 
Yukon Valley. If such a post is established it is not at all improbable that a com- 
bination of cirenmstances may arise some winter by which the forces that shall be 
stationed there will be reduced to starvation unless reindeer transportation shall 
have become so systematized that food can readily be sent in from other regions. 
The same is true with reference to the Government officials whom it may be found 
necessary to station in that region. 
The same is true of the forty or more missionaries and their families that are now 
scattered through that-vast region; also, of the teachers and their families whom 
the Government has sent into that country. 
These are now separated from all communication with the outside world, receiv- 
ing their mail but once a year. With reindeer transportation they could havea 
monthly mail. 
During the past three years the whalers have been extending their voyag 
of Point Barrow to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, and wintering at Hers 
Island. To the owners of this property it would be worth tens of thousands of dol- 
Jars if they could hear from their vessels inthe winter before new supplies and 
additional vessels are sent out in the spring. But this can not now be done. Last 
winter letters were sent out from the field, overland, by Indian runners that as- 
cended the Mackenzie, crossed over to the Porcupine, and descended the Porcupine 
and Yukon rivers down to St. Michael, on the coast. It was ten months before those 
letters reached their destination. It was a great satisfaction to the owners to hear 
of the welfare of their ships and crews, but the news was too late for business pur- 
poses. Millions of dollars’ worth of property and thousands of lives are involved in 
the whaling business. With the introduction of domestic reindeer into that region 
it will be both feasible and perfectly practicable to establish a reindeer express dur- 
ing the winter from the Arctic coast down to the North Pacific ceast of Alaska. 
‘The southern coast of Alaska on the Pacific Ocean never freezes, and is accessible 
all the year round to vessels from San Francisco or Puget Sound. : 
A reindeer express across Alaska, from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean, would 
have a corresponding commercial value to that section as the telegraph between 
New, York and London to theirs. It would enable the owners of the whaling fleet to 
avail themselves of the latest commercial news and keep a more perfect control over 
their business.       
  COMMERCIAL VALUE. 
In the fifth place, the introduction of domesticated reindeer will add a new indus- 
try to that country, which will go to swell the aggregate of national wealth. Lap- 
land sends to market about 22,000 head of reindeer a year, the surplus of her herds. 
Through N. yy and Sweden smoked reindeer meat and smoked reinde 
are everywhere found forsa 
and the tongues 10 cents apiece, There are wealthy merchants in St 
specialty and entire trade is in these Lapland products. Thereindeer 
keted all over Europe, being worth in their raw condition fro 
The tanned skins (soft, with a beautiful yellow color) find a 
at from $2 to $2.75 each. Reindeer skins are used for gloves, military riding trous- 
ers, and the binding of books. Reindeer hair isin great demand for the filling of 
life-saving apparatuses, buoys, etc., and from the reindeer horns is made the best

existing glue. "One great article, smoked reindeer tongues, and ed skins are 
among ‘the principal ‘products of the great annual fair at Nischnij Novgorod, Russia. 
In Lapland there are about 400,000 head of reindeer, sastaining in comfort some 26,000 
people. There is no reason, considering the greater area.of the country and the a 
abundance of reindeer moss, why arctic ‘and subaretic Alaska should not sustain a 
population of 100,000 people with 2,000,000 head of reindeer. In Lapland the rein- 
deer return a tax of $1 a head to the Government, so that they yield an annual rey- 
enue to the Government of $400,000. 
With the destruction of the buffalo the material for cheapgarriage and sleigh robes 
forcommon use is gone. Bear and wolf skins are too expensive; but with the intro- 
duction of the reindeer their skins would to a certain extent take the place ef the 
extinct buffalo. 
The commercial importance of introducing domesticated reindeer in Alaska was so 
manifest that shrewd business men on the Pacific coast at once appreciated the 
great possibilities involved, and hastened, through their chambers of commerce and. 
boards of trade, to take action urging their several delegations in Congress to do 
what they could to secure an appropriation of money for these purposes. 
Under favorable circumstances a swift reindeer can traverse 150 miles in a day. 
A speed of 100 miles per day is easily made. As a beast of burden they can draw a 
load of 300 pounds. 
The progress of exploration, settlement, development, government, civilization, 
education, humanity, and religion, are all jargely dependent in that region on rein- 
deer transportation. 
If there is any measure of public policy better established than another or more 
frequently acted upon, it has been the earnest and unceasing efforts of Congress to 
encourage and aid in every way the improvement of stock, and the markets of the 
world have been searched for improved breeds. The same wise and liberal policy 
will make ample provision for the introduction of the reindeer, which of all animals 
is the most serviceable and indispensable to man in high northern latitudes. 
If it is sound policy to sink artesian wells or create large water reservoirs for 
reclaiming large areas of valuable land otherwise worthless; if it is the part of 
national wisdom to introduce large, permanent, and wealth-producing industries 
where none previously existed, then it is the part of national wisdom to coyer that 
vast empire with herds of domestic reindeer, the only industry that can live and 
thrive in that region, and take a barbarian people on the verge of starvation, lift 
them up toa comfortable support and civilization, and turn them from consumers 
into producers of national wealth. 
It will be noticed that the sum asked from Congress is only $15,000. I hope that 
this will not be misunderstood and taken as a measure of the importance of the 
movement, for if the proposed results could not be obtained with any less sum an 
appropria ationof hundreds of thousands of dollars would be both wise and economical, . 
But so smail a sum is accepted on the ground of proceeding with extreme caution. 
It is the commencement of a great movement that will, if successful, extend its 
beneficial influences as long as the world stands. Therefore we move ’ slowly and 
carefully at first in order to secure that success. Commencing in a small way, the 
first outlay of money is not large. 
So far the purchase of the reindeer has been defrayed from the money contributed 
by benevolent individuals.     
    
  REVENUE-MARINE SERVICE, 
These gratifying results, however, could not have been attained without the hearty 
anda I éperation of the Revenue-Marine Service. 
If ce had been required to charter a vessel for the transporting of the rein- 
der nothing could have been done with the small sum at our disposal. 
But the Secretary of the Treasury directed that the rev enue cutter Bear, in addi- 
tion to her regu duties of patrolling the Seal Islands and the coasts of Bering Sea 
and the Arctic O an, following the whaling fleet, and inspecting the refuge station at 
Point Barrow,should also give what time was possible to tr orting the reindeer, 
To the captain, officers, and crew of the Bear is due much praise for the hard work 
done by them. 
Special thanks are due Capt. M. A. Healy for his earnestness and efficiency in 
doing his part of the work; also to Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, Surg.8.J.Call, and As- 
sistant Engineer Falkenstein, who were in charge of much of the shore work of load- 
ing and unloading the deer. 
The establishment of schools and the commencement of the introduction of do- 
mestic reindeer into Alaska are adding largely to the importance of the annual 
cruise of the U. 8. R. M. 8. Bear in Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. 
‘These schools and mission stations, with their large and increasing property inter- 
ests, beyond the protection and reach of the courts of the Territory, are dependent 
upon the protecting influence exerted by the annual visit of the revenue cutter.

RECOMMENDATIONS. . 
I. The recent act of Congress, entitled “An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and 
for other purposes,” approved March 8, 1891, makes provision for the incorporation 
‘of villages in Alaska. 
Under the proyisions of this act the citizens of Sitka and Juneau are taking steps 
to incorporate. 
As incorporation will enable them to levy and collect taxes for school purposes, I 
respectfully recommend that when a village incorporates, the white school of the 
place be turned over to the care of the school trustees that may be elected for that 
AEBORE, and that at least one-half of the expenses of the school shall be borne by the 
village. 
II. I renew the recommendation of former years for some provision for securing a 
more regular attendance of pupils. : 
III. With the gradual opening up of Alaska, it becomes increasingly important 
that the law creating agricultural colleges and experiment stations should be ex- 
tended to it. 
Iremain, with great respect, yours truly, 
SHELDON JACKSON, 
General Agent of Education in Alaska.

    962 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
From the foregoing table it appears that during the school year 1890-’91 there 
were 3,539,670 white ‘pupils enrolled in the public schools of the States under con- 
sideration, and 1,324,937 colored pupils. 
The white pupils formed 67.83 per cent of the total number of white persons 5 to 
18 years of age, and the colored pupils only 52.08 per cent of the colored persons 5 
to 18. 
The per cent of the colored population 5 to 18 enrolled exceeded that of the white 
only in Texas and the District ofColumbia. In nearly all the remaining States the 
per cent of colored enrollment fell largely short of the white enrollment. 
In Louisiana scarcely more than one- fourth of the colored population 5 to 18 years 
of age were enrolled in school (27.53 per cent). This is only about two-fifths of the 
general average for the United States. Nowhere else in the Union is there so poor a 
school attendance as among the colored people of Louisiana. 
The regularity of school attendance, as indicated by the relation of the average 
daily attendance to the total number of pupils enrolled, was nearly the same for 
both races. About five-cighths of the whole enrollment of each race were present 
daily on an average. 
The percentage of the school population (5 to 18) enrolled, both white and colored, 
has made some gainsince the preceding year The change is slight, it is true, but the 
movement is in the right direction, as will be seen from the following:

ALABAMA. 
Observations of W. H. Councill, conductor of institutes for colored teachers in 
Alabama: The night mass meetings, held atall the institutes, were largely attended 
—crowded—and always encouraged by the best white people in the communities, 
many of them attending all the meetings. 
While holding these meetings from year to year I have observed: (1) That there 
is great progress among the colored teachers in every way. (2) That the desire 
for industrial instruction is firm and widespread. (3) That the masses are mak- 
ing marked progress in general intelligence and in support of education. (4) That 
the white people and colored people are increasing in good feelings on all moral, re- 
ligious, temperance, and educational questions, and that the whites everywhere are 
willing to aid the colored people along the lines. (5) That the proper kind of moral, 
industrial, and intellectual training is a check on any inclination or temptation to 
racial conflict, and guarantees an honest, peaceful, industrious citizenship to the 
State. (6) That the institutes are of incalculable good to popular education.

  NTUCKY. 
Encouraging prospects.—The. superintendent of Mason County: The condition of 
the colored schools in our county has been to me a matter of surprise and congratu- 
lation. The capacity of the negro children for acquiring education surpasses any 
thing I had supposed concerning this race. ‘There are fifteen colored districts in our 
county, and most of them are taught by well-educated and trained teachers. At 
present our teachers mostly come from Cincinnati, Dayton, Cleveland, and Steu- 
benville, Ohio. They bring with them a knowledge of common school training and 
drill which enables them to conduct their schools successfully, and I am able to 
report the colored schools of our county as being in a very encouraging condition. 
The superintendent of Nicholas County also reports that the colored schools are 
progressing very well, and that the colored people seem to take a greater interest in 
the schools than the whites do. 
Superintendent of Scott County: The colored people are making material progress 
in regard to schoolhouses and equipments. Several houses will be improved this 
year, and two new ones built. They are very much in carnest in the matter of edu- 
eating their children, and are doing probably as much as they are able to do to 
accomplish thatend. Teachers are improving in efficiency and_qualification for 
their work. I am very hopeful of our colored schools. The people have the right 
spirit, and respond to all school demands to the limit of their ability. 
The trouble. with colored trustces.—Superintendent of Bourbon County: A public 
school was taught in every colored district the past year. The colored people are 
too poor to support a private school. However, in a few places, school is continued 
beyond the public term, though with little profit to the teachers. The trustees are 
ignorant, and, in reality, not competent to select a teacher. With many applicants 
_ before them demanding the same compensation, they often pass over the best for 
poor teachers. They do not understand, and can not properly appreciate, the dif- 
ference between the several grades of certificates. I may also add that in some 
cases I have had strong suspicion that the trustees of the colored schools have been 
bribed. But it is impossible to get any information on a subject as to which all par- 
ties, trustees and teachers, are equally interested in keeping quict. So that the 
guilty go unpunished for want of sufficient evidence. It would be wellif the su- 
perintendent could, out of the applicants for a school, select a certain number—say 
two or three—out of-which number so selected the trustees would be compelled to 
employ. This would enable the trustee to get a qualified teacher, and at the same 
timo allow some margin for their choice in the matter. Without some limitation of 
the kind, or some guard of this nature thrown around them, they are wholly atsea, 
unable to discharge their duty. The colored teachers are improving, but they are 
not, as a class, well qualified to teach. The list of certificates granted show that 
few get over a third-class certificate. This is an evil which can be cured only by 
time. Ina few years we will doubtless have capable colored teachers. The younger 
teachers are generally the best qualified. Better training of teachers is much needed,   
   
LOUISIANA. 
The relations between the races.—State Superintendent W.H. Jack: The relations of 
the two races are harmonious and happy, and each seems actuated by a true spirit to 
reach the highest possible standard of mental and moral culture. We are educating
-P-A-G-E-317
  ; EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 965 
the negro in the same way that we are educating ourown children, and are succeed- 
ing in developing him to an extent that is highly gratifying. Our method of solving 
the race problem is not by amalgamation or deportation, but by educating the 
negro children and bringing them under the renovating influences of white civiliza- 
tion. I: would take occasion to observe, just here, that there is no such thing, in 
point of fact, as ‘‘race antagonism.” The very kindest relations naturally exist 
between the two races, and there is not, and has never been, any such innate 
prejudice or antipathy on either side as would prevent the two races from living 
happily together. They understand each other perfectly, and govern themselves 
accordingly. The white man feels the native superiority of the Caucasian height- 
ened by centuries of civilization, and the negro knows and recognizes the fact in all 
itsmeaning. * * * 
I know of no reason why the negro, by proper training and direction, can not be 
made a good citizen and his race be elevated to a much higher plane than he now 
occupies. : ; 
aAaeGi oo of negro teachers; one of two things should be done.—At a meeting of the 
Louisiana Educational Association, July, 1890, Col. T. Sambola Jones, of Baton 
Rouge. said: é 
“Multiplicity of tongues and differences ef religion have made private, public, and 
sectarian school interests seem to retard rather than advance the cause of education. 
But there is no influence that has so reduced our general average, scattered our 
funds, or weakened the efficiency of our system half so much as the colored contin- 
gent in the public schools. Like the rain from heaven, that falls alike upon the just 
as wellas upon the unjust, the funds obtained almost exclusively from the Caucasian 
element of the population are divided, share and share alike, with the children of 
their brothers in black. With a furtive glance at duty we do not consider binding, 
we appropriate funds for colored country schools and employ the ignorant and super- 
stitious to teach ignorance and superstition. Better have no education whatever 
than be organized into schools and clans where falsehood takes the place of truth, 
where virtue is turned to vice, and prejudice and hatred of their white superiors 
encouraged and taught.” 
Here Col. Jones related some ludicrous incidents which occurred that forcibly 
demonstrated the capacity and standing of the average teacher of a negro public 
school, showing how unfit they were to advance the ignorant under their charge, 
He went on to say: 
“Tf, indeed, poverty and dejection occasionally drive a belated soul to such a pro- 
fession, the finger of shame is pointed, and while we pity we scorn and despise. No 
young man or woman here or elsewhere dares cross the black line or take a stand at 
the head of a negro school to teach good morals, sound philosophy, or beautiful 
rhetoric. If we must educate the negro let us no longer follow the unwise and sui- 
cidal policy of importing aliens, impractical, half-educated men and women, unac- 
quainted with the relationship of the races and the duties and responsibilities uf one toward the other, to teach the inferior race heresies, to poison and prejudice them 
against their own welfare and our safety.” 
Turning to the president, Col. Jones said: “It is your duty as the head of the 
educational interest of Louisiana, as molders of public opinion and directors of pub- 
lic thought upon the question of education, to do one of two things. You should 
stimulate public opinion in behalf of honest, upright, competent, and learned white 
instructors for the colored schools, or you should prick the huge bubble that claims 
for them equal rights, equal education, and an equal share of the public funds with 
the children of our own white race.” 
White teachers for colored schools.—The following resolutions were adopted by the 
Louisiana Educational Association at its Shreveport (1890) meeting: 
Resolved, That we recognize it as the duty of those interested with the employ- 
ment of teachers for our public colored schools to select only those whose moral and 
intellectual worth shall fit him or her to the task of attempting to elevate the 
colored race. 
Resolved, That we henceforth bend our energies to having teachers thus qualified 
employed in the colored schools regardless of color. 
In another resolution the same association affirmed the ability and the duty of the 
people of the State of Louisiana to educate all its children. 
MARYLAND. 
Schools for colored pupils.—Dr. James L. Bryan, school examiner of Dorchester 
County, says in his report: : 
     The ae generous and just appreciation of the rights of our fellow white men, 
leads na y to the fair appropriation of common State funds for educational pur- 
poses to colored people of the State. The school law, in Chapter xvm, section 
  96, says: ‘It shall be the duty of the board of county school commissioners to
-P-A-G-E-318
  | | 966 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
establish one or more public schools in each election district for all colored youths 
between 6 and 20 years of age, to which-admission shall be free, and which sha’l be 
kept open as long as the other public schools of the particular county, provided the 
average attendance is not less than 15 scholars.” 
And yet the necessary funds for the purpose are not provided. The State appro- 
priates more pro rata to the colored pupils than to the white ones, but the county 
appropriations are not so divided, nor are they sufficient to carry out the purposes 
of the law in this regard. 
We shonld never forget that public school systems result from the conviction that 
the education of the whole people of a State can not be accomplished in any other 
way than by a State system and by State aid. That to be of benefit to the very 
class which would be most injurious to a true republican statehood, the very means 
of education must be furnished systematically, regularly, and fairly, and this can 
~ best be done by a tax upon all the property of the State. Such tax once raised be- 
comes the property of the cause or interest for which it was levied, and then there 
can be no difference between white and colored pupils. Separate schools for the 
two races are a necessity, but there the difference ends, and all the expenses of the 
schools, their accounts, reports, are and should be upon a common basis and fairly 
proportioned. 
TY. InpustriaL TRAINING. 
In all of the twenty-five universities and colleges except two, Lincoln University, 
Pennsylvania, and Morgan College, Baltimore, Md., instruction was given in differ- 
ent lines of industry. In some of the institutions special attention was given to such 
instruction. In Claflin University, South Carolina, more than a dozen industries are 
taught and $20,000 have been e ‘pended i in procuring the necessary outfits, and no 
student is allowed to graduate a he or she has mastered some line of industry. 
At Clark University, Atlanta, Ga., and Rust University, Mississippi, great attention 
is also given to training in the industries, Among the young men carpentry and 
printing, and among they young women plain sewing and dressmaking ‘are the fayor- 
ite branches. This is what was to be expected. “Carpentry affords opportunities 
for earning good wages, besides having other inducements, while printing furnishes 
a good livelihood and at the same time offers excellent opportunitics for educational 
advancement. Carpentry is taught in all but five of the institutions, and printing 
in all but six. Sewing also is tanght in all but five. Farming, gardening, shoe- 
making, and cooking were the other most frequent employments. 
‘A statement of the carpentry work done at Claflin University represents very 
fairly the work at other institutions. The carpenter shop at Claflin University is 
furnished with several sets of tools. But little machinery has been introduced, as 
it is the purpose of the managers to make the students familiar with hand tools, 
such as they would be most likely to use after leaving school. Students are taught 
the names and uses of tools and how to keep them in order. A great variety of 
work has been performed, such as building cottages, shops, repairing buildings, making 
and repairing furniture, ornamenting buildings and campus, building and repairing 
fences, making and repairing agricultural implements, making wardrobes, etc. . 
At Clark University, Atlanta, Ga., students are taught how to make carriages and 
harness, which are sold in the market in competition with other manufacturing 
establishments. Buildings are fully equipped with tools, machinery, and steam 
power for the prosecution of the following industries: (1) General blacksmithing, 
(2) carriage-making and carpentry, (3) carriage-painting, (4) carriage-trimming, 
(5) eae making, (6) shoemaking, (7) printing, (8) iron and composition molding, 
(9) planing-mill work, (10) drawing and designing. 
“These courses of instruction are designed to fit pupils to become journeymen and 
foremen in the trades represented. The student is employed in model work until he 
acquires a sufficient knowledge of the use of tools to engage in the actual production 
of goods for the market. The sales of goods manufactured in these shops during the 
present year will amount to about $15, 000. We compete with other shops and factories, 
and find sale for more than we can make. This is ono of the ¥: ery few schools in the 
South which combine theory, or model work, and the actual manufacturing of arti- 
eles for the markets. The graduates from our shops go at once as full journeymen 
into regular manufacturing establishments, and some of them as foremen. We could 
find places for ten times as many as we send out,”

At the meeting of the general committee of the Freedman’s Aid and Southern Edu- 
cation Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held in Harrisburg, Pa., Novem- 
ber 7, 1892, the report on manual training in 23 colored schools was as follows: Male

V.—CoEDUCATION OF THE RACES. 
In the catalogues of many of the colored institutions it is stated that students will - 
be received regardless of race or sex. Usually, however, there are not many white 
students in colored schools. In quite a number of Northern institutions there can _ 
be found from one to five colored students, but generally these are in schools where 
the students are grown young men and where their intercourse is practically limited 
to the lecture room. So far as reported the number of colored students in Northern 
and Western schools in 1890-91 was as follows: In secondary schools, 80; universities 
and colleges, 160; normal schools, 207; theological, 71; law, 20; medical, dental, and 
pharmaceutical, 63. Most of the normal students here reported were attending nor- 
mal schools supported by the State or city. Wherever a sufficient number of col- 
ored students are found for a separate institution, there is apt to be an institution 
for each race. 
On this subject of coeducation of the races, Rev. J.E. Rankin, p. D., president of 
Howard University, Washington, D. C., said at the Mohonk Conference in 1891: 
“Jtistrue that the colored mancan go to Northern institutions of learning. Thatis, 
as an individual, one of him. But ten of him together would break up any college 
class, Even Harvard would ceass to elect him class orator. He cannot be educated 
in large numbers, except in institutions established and maintained especially for his 
penefit. He can go into a few of the white churches, but not in any large number, 
There is scarcely a white church in the land that conld exist long with 50 colored 
people as members, if they came en masse, if there were a colored revival. Iam not 
complaining of this. I am speaking cold facts, frozen facts. Iam not looking for it 
at present to be otherwise. Christian as are our theological seminaries, I believe 
that while the white students of a class would regard 1 colored man as a curiosity,

a phenomenon, and 2 colored men as a double enigma, 10 colored men would put 
10,000 of them to flight. If, therefore, you want to give'colored men higher theologi- 
caltraining, it must be provided for in schools established for colored men.” 
Rey. Samuel W. Boardman, president of Maryville College, Tenn., says: ‘Not lorg 
ago there were said to be about 20 Afro-Americans in the different departments of 
Harvard University. Nowhere have I seen such students appear to be more at 
home than in the libraries, reading rooms, and on the shady walks of Cambridge. It 
is well known that they are made welcome in the universities of England, France, 
Germany, and other countries of Europe. At Yale, Cornell, and other American col- 
leges, they have been well represented. They haye won prizes, and received in some 
cases the especial recognition of their classmates in appointments to class honors.” 
There is probably a greater intermingling of the races at Berea College, Ky., and 
at Orange Park, Fla., than at any other places. Both of these institutions are as- 
sisted by the American Missionary Association, and it is stated in the catalogue of 
Berea College that the school is intended as a source of educational, moral, and social 
reform. ‘Che number of colored male and female students at Berea was 188, and of 
white students male and female, 166. They mingle together both in theschool rooms 
and in the boarding departments. 
At the Orange Park, Fla., school there are about 35 colored boys and girls and 
almost as many whites who board, together with many day pupils of both races. It 
seems that the majority of the whites in Orangé Park are New Englanders, who have 
been there for some years. Having spent their money to fix themselves in the South 
and, after getting there, failing to realize what they had. hoped, they became poor— 
too poor to send their children off to school. Not satisfied that their children should 
forego the training given in the Orange Park School, they were, because of circum- 
stances, forced to send there. It is abitter pill, however, because many of them are 
Southernized Northerners. At first they strongly objected, and more than once 
used their influence to have the colored pupils withdrawn, but with no effect. 
“Tn the beginning the white pupils separated themselves as much as possible from 
the colored pupils. As the school work progressed and all the pupils became inter- 
ested in the common cause of education, the differences were forgotten, the storm 
outside abated, and the white pupils naturally became more intimately associated 
with the colored pupils in class work.” 
VI. Various Expressions OF OPINION REGARDING NEGRo EpucatTION AND AD- 
VANCEMENT. 
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO, 
_ [From an article by W. T. Harris in the Atlantic Monthly, June, 1892, with annotations by representa- 
tive men to whom it had been submitted for criticism.] 
The negro was brought to this country as a slave almost from the date of its first 
settlement. Two hundred and fifty years of bondage had elapsed when the issue of 
civil war sethim free. He had brought with him from Africa the lowest form ef ciy- 
ilization to be found among men—that in which the most degrading superstition 
furnishes the forms of public and private life. His religion was fetichism. But by 
contact with the Anglo-Saxon race in the very close relation of domestic servitude, 
living in the same family and governed by the absolute authority which character- 
izes all family control, the negro, after two and a half centuries, had come to possess 
what we may call the Anglo-Saxon consciousness. For the negro of the South, with 
the exception of a stratum of population in the dark belt of large plantations, where 
he has not been brought into contact with white people through domestic servitude, 
but segregated as oxen and horses are—the negro of the South, with this exception, 
I repeat, is thoroughly imbued with nearly all the ideals and aspirations which form 
the conscious and unconscious motives of acticen with the white people among whom 
he lives.!. It would be very easy to convince one’s self of this by free conversation 
with any specimen of the colored race, and a comparison of his thoughts with those 
of a newly arrived immigrant from Ireland, Italy, Germany, or Scandinavia. It 
would be found that the negro is in thorough sympathy, intellectually and emotion- 
ally, with our national point of view, while the immigrant looks through the dark 
lass of his own national presuppositions, and misinterprets most that hesees around 
ni here. Only in the second generation, and after association with the native pop- 
  
1Tt is a matter for discussion whether the negro has come into the possession of what may be called 
“the Anglo-Saxon consciousness.” I can not see how, so long as the people of this race constitute a distinct and insoluble entity in our political society, it will be possible for them to acquire the charac- 
teristics which it has taken such a long period of time to develop in the Caucasian race. (Zt. L. Gib- 
gon.)   
-P-A-G-E-321
  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 969 
ulation in common schools, the workshop, and the political mecting, does the Euro- 
pean contingent of our population become assimilated.! 
Of course I do not say this in disparagement of the European immigrant, for he 
stubbornly resists our national idea only in proportion to the value of his own. 
But I do insist on the practical fact that the negro of the South is not an African in 
his inner consciousness, but an American who has acquired our Anglo-Saxon con- 
sciousness in its American type through seven generations of dom >stic seryitude in 
the family of a white master. That this has been acquired so completely because of 
the inherent aptitude of the African race to imitate may be admitted as probable, 
and it follows from this that the national consciousness assumed by the black race 
is not so firmly seated as in other races that have risen through their own activity 
to views of the world more advanced than fetichism. Hence we may expect that 
the sundering of the negro from close domestic relations with the white race will be 
accompanied with tendencies of relapse to the old fetich worship and belief in magic; 
and this would be especially the case in the dark belt where the large plantations 
are‘found, *.°*  * 
Here is the chief problem of the negro of the South. It is to retain the elevation 
acquired through the long generations of domestic slavery, and to superimpose on 
it the sense of personal responsibility, moral dignity, and self-respect which belongs 
to the conscious ideal of the white race. Those acquainted with the free negro of the 
South, especially with the specimens at school and college, know that he is as capable 
of this higher form of civilization as in slavery he was capable of faithful attach- 
ment to the interests of his master. 
The first step? towards this higher stage which will make the negro a valued citi- 
zen is intellectual education, and the second is industrial education.® By the expres- 
sion ‘‘industrial education” I do not refer so much to training in habits of industry, 
for he has had this discipline for two hundred years,* but to school instruction in arts 
and trades as applications of scientific principles. Nor do I refer even to manual and 
scientific training, valuable as it is,so much as to that fundamental training in thrift® 
which is so essential to the progress of industry. The negro must teach himself to 
become a capitalist. There are two stages to this: First, that of hoarding; second, 
that of profitable investment. The first stage of thrift may be stimulated by adopt- 
ing the postal savings device. If it be true, as is plausibly asserted, that the so-called 
poor white of the South is less thrifty than the negro, such adoption by our Govern- 
1 Withdrawn by force from his original physical and moral environment, the negro has adapted himself to his American surro:mdings, and in Woing so has necessarily acquired, so far as his lower intelligence permitted, the ideals and aspirations of the people to whom he was bound so long in slav- ery; but he is essentially still an African in tho. controlling tendencies of his character. When left to an exclusive association with his own people, thero is powerful inclination on the part of the Southern negro to revert to all of the distinctive features of his African ancestors. ‘This is a fact of the utmost importance in the consideration of the proper means to be employed for the improvement of his character. ‘The principal cause of the many failures which have been made in the effort to pro- duce this improvement has been the unfortunate misconception that the Southern negro Jof to-day i simply an ignorant white man with a black skin. ‘Lhe American descendants of European immigrants are, in the second generation, thoroughly assimilated with the surrounding white population. ‘The grandsons of an American, a German, and an Englishman differ but little, if at all, in the basis of their Character. It can hardly be said that the negroes even of those Northern communities in which their race has enjoyed freedom for five generations are so assimilated with tho surrounding white popula- tion that they are not to be discriminated from it in racial characteristics. (P. A. Bruce.) 2 ‘The first step really to be taken must be by the whites about/him in letting the negro feel that he possesses inalienable rights. What ho now possesses is by sufferance only. He knows that he is neither a citizen nor a man, in the full sense. (LZ. H. Blair:) 
3I should prefer to define the course thus: First, religious; second, industrial; and third, intellec- tual. An ideal public-school system for the Southern negroes for many generations to come would be a system under the operation of which each schoolhouse would be devoted to the religious instruction of the colored pupils, with a sudicient amount of indusérial training to impart habits of industry, and a sufficient amount of intellectual training to facilitate the inculeation of the religions teachings. As far as possible the public-school system should be made supervisory of the moral life of tho pupils; it should take the place of the parental authority, which is so much relaxed, now that the watchful eye and firm support of the slaveholders have been withdrawn. (P. A. Bruce.) 4 One of the discouraging features in the character of the young Southern negro is that apparentl he has inherited but a small share of the steadiness and industry which were acquired under compul- sion by his fathers. Iam referring now to the young negro to be found in the agricultural commu- nities. He is in a marked degree inferior to thé former slave in agricultural knowledge and manipu- lating skill, for the very simple reason that his employer is unable to enforce the rigid attentiom to all the details of work which he wonld do if the young negro were his property. (P. A. Bruce.) Dr. Harris seems to me to overestimate the ‘value of the slave's experience in developing tho habits of punctuality and obedience in descendants who were never slaves. I fear that the result is far other; that in the descendants of the slave there is an inherited disposition to be disobedient*to law as a proof of the newly acquired freedom. (Anon.) 5 There is need of tlic ineuleation and of the adoption in home life, in daily conduct, of sounder principles of economy and of consumption. What to eat, what to wear, how to cook, how to provide and preserve home conveniences and comforts, how to lay by for a rainy day, must be indoctrinated, ingrained, and become a habit. In other days the African slave was cared for from cradle to coffin, and literally tcok nc thought for the morrow. Comparatively few negroes now living were ever slaves, but the habits of servitude have been transmitted. (J. L. ML Curry.)

ment of the postal savings institution would be a blessing to both races.!_ We know, 
indeed, that the poor white in the North is chiefly in necd of the thrift that has a 
habit of hoarding—that is, the habit of saving something from its weekly pittance, 
no matter how small. 
The introduction of manufacturing industries throughout the South is favorable 
to the rise of the poor white from his poverty. In the early days of cotton manu- 
facture in New England, the unthrifty white people, who hitherto had lived in cot- 
tages or hovels near the large farms, removed to the villages that were springing up 
near water privileges. They learned how to “ work in the mill,” all the members of 
the family, from the oldest to the youngest, and the aggregate wages was wealth 
compared with what they had known before. In fact, they earned more than the 
well-to-do farmers in whose service they had formerly labored. The children now 
earned more wages than the parents had earned before. The work on the farm was 
varied and intermittent, depending upon the season. Plowing, planting, weed- 
ing, haying, harvesting, thrashing, marketing, weod-cutting, etc., are regulated by 
the farmer’s calendar. There are rainy days, when the day laborer loses his hire; 
and, besides these, there are intervals between the season of one species of work 
and that of the next, in which no employment is offered him by the farm proprietor. 
If he had thrift he would find work of some kind for himself at home; he would 
save money and own his house. But thrift he does not possess. Hence, what he 
earns in the days of the working season is prodigally expended while it lasts, and 
the days of idleness after harvest are days of want in the household. The children 
are educated in the same habits of unthrift. 
The rise of manufactures? and the removal of the ill-to-do families from the farm 
to the mi!l put an end to the periodic alternation of want and plenty in the house, 
Plenty now prevails, but does not generate thrift, for there is less occasion for it. 
The week’s wages may be expended as fast as earned, thanks to the demoralizing 
institution of credit at the grocery kept by the proprietors of the mill. But, not- 
withstanding this drawback, there is more self-respect on the part of the children, 
who now have the consciousness that they earn their living. Manufactures and 
commerce bring about urban life as contrasted with rural life. The village grows 
into the city; the railroad carries the daily newspaper from the metropolis to the 
suburbs and to all towns on its line, and thus extends urban life indefinitely. 
The difference between these two orders of life, the urban and rural, is quite im- 
portant, and its discussion affords us an insight into a process going on rapidly 
throughout the South. The old régime of the large farm, with its cordon of de- 
pendent families, rendered possible a sort of patriarchal constitution. The farm 
proprietor, in the North as well as in the South, wielded great power over the un- 
thrifty families of day laborers who lived near him. He helped them do their think- 
ing, as he mingled with them in the daily work. He was called uponto assist when- 
ever their unthrift pinched them. His intellect and will in a measure supplanted 
the native intellect and will of his hired laborers, not merely in directing their work 
on his farm, but also in their private matters, it being their habit to consult him. 
The farm proprietor thus furnished a sort of substantial will power that governed 
his small community as the head of a family governs his. 
This semi-patriarchal rule which exists in the exclusively agricultural community . 
produces its own peculiar form of ethical life. The head of the farm, who does the 
thinking and willing for the others in all matters that are not fixed by routine, so 
penetrates their lives that’ he exercises a moral restraint over them, holding them 
back from crime of all kinds. Such ethical influence is, however, of the lowest and 
most rudimentary character in the stage next above slavery. It presupposes a lack 
of individual self-determination in the persons thus controlled. ‘They are obsessed, 
as it were, by his will and intellect, and fail to develop their own native capacities, 
He rules as a clan leader, and they are his henchmen. They are repressed and are 
not educated into a moral character of their own. There is little outward stimulus 
compelling them to exercise their independent choice. Hence agricultural commu- 
nities are conservative, governed by custom and routine, taking up very slowly any 
new ideas. 
The change to urban life through the intermediary step of village life br 
      aks up 
    r industrial ary, for him. 1 Until the negro learns thrift he will never be a man, no matter what his scienti education may be; therefore postal savings banks are especially desirable, indeed neces (Li. He Blair.) 21¢ is vain to look for mannfactures in the South. Manufactures flourish only in a cool climate. Manufacturing has for years been diminishing in the South, press reports to the contrary notwith- standing. (Z. H. Blai7.) The recent statistics of American cotton manufacture issued from the Census Office show that great strides have been made by the Southern States between 1880 and 1890. ‘The amount of capital invested in that Solar in the Southern group has advanced from $21,976,713 to $61,124,096; the num- ber of hands employed has advanced from 20,827 to 41,481, and the valu of themanufactured products has been raised from $21,038,712 to $46,971,503. ‘This compares very favorably with the progress made by any other group of States within ‘the same interval. (J. 8. Means, in the “ Southern States” for arch, 1893.

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 971 
this patriarchal clanship, and cultivates in its place independence of opinion and 
action. The laborer in the ‘‘mill” recognizes his right to choose his employer and 
his place of labor, and exercises it to a far greater degree than the farm laborer. 
He migrates ‘from village to village; in the city he has before him a bewildering 
variety of employers to choose from. The city employer does not act as patriarch, 
nor permit his laborers to approach him as head of a clan. The urban life protects 
the laborer from the obsessing influence of the employer, and throws a far greater 
weight of responsibility on the individual. Hence the urban life stimulates and 
develops independence of character. 
In the case of the Southern slave there was none of this alternation between idle- 
ness and industry, plenty and want, that comes to the poor white at the North and 
South by reason of his freedom. But his will and intellect were obsessed more 
effectually because the slave could not be allowed the development of spontaneous, 
independent, self-activity. Since the civil war, however, the condition of the negro 
has changed, and in the agricultural region it now resembles more nearly the status 
above described as that of the poor white in rural in contradistinction from urban 
surroundings. Where the country is sparsely settled the proprietor farmer retains 
the dominant influence. Where the villages are getting numerous the tendeney to 
independence manifests itselfin a partial revolt from the patriarchal rule of the 
plantation, and the struggle leads naturally to an unpleasant state of affairs for all 
parties. But the urban factor in the problem is certain to gain the ascendancy, and 
we must see in the near future, with the increase of railroads and manufacturing 
centers, the progressive decadence of the patriarchal rule. The old system of social 
morality will perish, and a new one will take its place. In the formation of the 
new one the present danger lies. 
If the negro separates entirely from the white classes so far as domestic relations 
are concerned, and forms his own independent family, he separates from the clan 
influence also, and loses the education of the white master’s family in manners.! 
He loses, too, the education of the master’s counseland directing influence. Unless 
this is counterbalanced by school education, it will produce degeneracy; for to _ 
remove the weight of authority is productive of good only when there has been a 
growth of individuality that demands a larger sphere of free activity. In case of 
entering upon village life and mechanical industries greater freedom from authority 
is demanded, and its effects are healthful; but with the isolated life on the planta- 
tion the opposite holds. 
The remedy for evils incident to these changes is, as before said, school education, 
provided it is inclusive enough to furnish industrial and moral as well as intellectual 
training. 
Education, intellectual and moral, is the only means yet discovered that is always 
sure to help people to help themselves. Any other species of aid may enervate the 
beneficiary, and lead to a habit of dependence on outside help. But intellectual and 
moral education develops self-respect, fertility of resources, knowledge of human 
nature, and aspiration for a better condition in life. It produces that divine discon- 
tent which goads on the individual, and will not let him rest.? 
How does the school produce this important result? In what way can it give to 
the negro a solid basis for character and accomplishments? The school has under- 
taken to perform two quite different and opposite educational functions. The first 
produces intellectual training, and the second the training of the will. 
The school, for its intellectual function, causes the pupil to learn certain arts, 
such as reading and writing, which make possible communication with one’s fellow- 
men, and impart certain rudimentary insights or general elementary ideas with 
which practical thinking may be done, and the pupil be set on the way to comprehend 
        
1 The increasing isolation of the negro of the South from the whites is, so far as his own advancement is concerned, the niost significant fact connected with his present condition. In one point only does he come in contact with the white man, and that is in the formal relation of employed to employer. ‘Tho negro and the white man are driven into this relation of necessity. In their social spheres they are as wide apart as if they inhabited ditlerent countries. ‘They have separate churches and separate schools, and it is only a question of time for them to have, in all parts of the South, separate public conveyances. The two races resemble two great streams that flow side by side, never commingling nor converging. There is no disposition to unite. On the contrary, the tendency is to swerve still further apart, ‘This is a fuct of supreme importance in its hearing’ upon the prospects of the negro race in the South, for that race is essentially imitative and adaptive in its character, showing a parasitic loyalty to its environment. Ina state of servitude, the negro was disciplined into a fixed and industrious life by the regulations of the system which enslaved him; he was improved in man- ners and elevated in his general conceptions by his daily association with the individuals of a superior * white casto. ‘This semi-military discipline of slavery is gone, aud no social or personal tie now unites the home of the negro with that of the white man. (P. A. Bruce.) : : 2Self-respect is near akin to self-support. Any one who has lived in a foreign land where class dis- tinctions prevail knows how ineffaceable is deference to rank, sometimes approaching scrvility. The negro secms to assume, to feel, to act on, his inferiority. ‘he action of the Government, of party managers, of religious organizations, of givers of pecuniary aid, of administrators of charitable bend. factions, has tended to make him look to and rely upon Hercules. Slavery subordinated will, repressed intelligence, did not cultivate individuality or self-determination, and what is needed for the African is a strengthening at weak points so as to build up self-reliant character. (J. L. I. Ourry.)

his environment of nature, and of humanity and history. There is taught in the 
humblest of schools something of arithmetic, the science and arts of numbers, by 
whose aid material nature is divided and combined—the most practical of all knowl- 
edge of nature because it relates to the fundamental conditions of the existence of 
nature, the quantitative structure of time and space themselves. A little geography, 
also, is taught; the pupil acquires the idea of the interrelation of each locality with 
every other. Each place produces something for the world-market, and in return it 
Teceives numerous commodities of useful and ornamental articles for food, clothing, 
and shelter. The great cosmopolitan idea of the human race and its unity of inter- 
ests is born of geography, and even the smattering of it which the poorly taught 
pupil gets enwraps this great general idea, which is fertile and productive, a veri- 
table knowledge of power from the start. 
All school studies, moreover, deal with language, the embodiment of the reason, 
not of the individual, but of the Anglo-Saxon stock or people. ‘The most elementary 
language study begins by isolating the words of a sentence, and making tke pupil 
conscious of their separate articulation, spelling, and meaning. The savage does 
not quite arrive ata consciousness of the separate words of the language, but knows 
only whole sentences. All inflected languages preserve for us their primitive form 
of language consciousness, the inflections being the addition (to the roots or stems) 
of various subjective or pronominal clements necessary to give definiteness of appli- 
cation. The Turanic languages are called “agglutinative,” because the power of an- 
alytic thinking has not proceeded so far as to differentiate the parts of speech fully. 
Every sentence is as it were some form of a conjugation of its verb. 
Now, the steps of becoming conscious of words as words involved in writing and 
spelling, and in making out the meaning, and, finally, in the study of grammatical 
distinctions between the parts of speech, bring to the pupil a power of abstraction, 
a power of discriminating form from contents, substance from accidents, activity 
from passivity, subjective from objective, which makes him a thinker. For think- 
ing depends on the mastery of categories, the ability to analyze a subject and get at 
its essential elements and see their necessary relations. The people who are taught 
to analyze their speech into words have a constant elementary training through life 
that makes them reflective and analytic as compared with a totally illiterate people. 
This explains to some degree the effect upon a lower race of adopting the language 
of ahigher race. It brings up into consciousness, by furnishing exact expressions 
‘for them, complicated series of ideas which remain sunk below the mental horizon of 
the savage. It enables the rudimentary intelligence to ascend from the thought of 
isolated things to the thought of their relations and interdependencies. 
The school teaches also literature, and trains the pupil to read by setting him les- 
sons consisting-of extracts from literary works of art. These are selected for their 
intensity, and for their peculiar merits in expressing situations of the soul brought 
about by external or internal circumstances. Language itself contains the catego- 
ries of thought, and the study of grammatical structure makes one conscious of 
phases of ideas which flit past without notice in the mind of the illiterate person. 
Literary genious invents modes of utterance for feelings and thoughts that were 
hitherto below the surface of consciousness. It brings them above its level, and 
makes them forever after conscious and articulate. Especially in the realm of ethi- 
eal and religious ideas, the thoughts that furnish the regulative forms for living and 
acting, literature is preéminent forits usefulness. Literature may be said, therefore, 
to reveal human nature. Its very elementary study in school makes the pupil ac- 
quainted with a hundred or more pieces of literary art, expressing for him with 
felicity his rarer and higher moods of feeling and thought. When, in mature age, 
we look back over our lives and recall to mind the influence that our schooldays 
brought us, the time spent over the school readers seems quite naturally to have been 
the most valuable part of our education. Our thoughts on the conduct of life have 
been stimulated by it, and this ethical knowledge is of all knowledge the nearest 
related to self-preseryation. 
The school, even in its least efficient form, does something on these lines of intel- 
lectual insight. For the most fruitful part of all intellectual education is the aequi- 
sition of the gencral outline and the basal idea—the categories, so to speak, of the 
provinces of human learning. This intellectual part of school education could not 
well be more accurately directed to aid the cause of civilization. For the kind of 
knowledge and mental discipline that conserves civil life is the knowledge that gives 
an insight into the dependence of the individual upon society. The school is busied 
with giving the pupil a knowledge of the conditions of physical nature and human 
nature; the former in mathematical study, the latter in language study. 
The school also educates the will through its discipline. It demands of the pupil 
that he shall be obedient to the rules of order, and adopt habits that make it possi- 
ble to combine with one’s fellows. The school is a small community, in which many 
immature wills are combined in such a way as to prevent one from standing in the 
way of another, while each helps all and all help each. For the pupil learns more

by seeing the efforts of his fellows at mastering the lesson than he does by hearing 
the teacher's explanations. In order to secure concert of action, the semimechanical 
moral habits of regularity, punctuality, silence, and industry are insisted on. Moral 
education is not accomplished by lectures on morals so much as by a strict training 
in moral habits. The American school is proverbially strict in the matter of these 
semimechanical moral habits. They constitute the basis of self-control as related 
to combination with one’s fellows. Leave out punctuality and regularity, and no 
combination is practicable; leave ont silence and industry, and the school work is 
not possible. Without industry and abstention from meddlesomeness (and this is 
the equivalent of silence in the school) there can be no combination in civil society 
at large. The school secures peaceful codperation, repressing the natural quarrel- 
someness that exists among boys who are strangers to one another, and insuring civil 
behavior. Good behavior is the general term that characterizes the ideal aimed at 
by the school in the matter of will-training. A mastery of the ‘“ conventionalities of 
intelligence,” as the ‘‘three R’s” are called by a thoughtful observer, characterizes 
in like manner the ideal of its intellectual training. 
From these considerations we can see how the common school may work, and does 
necessarily work, to civilize the intellect and will of the child, and how it must affect 
any lower race struggling to master the elements of civilization. For this scholastic 
training gives one the power to comprehend the springs of action that move the 
races which possess the directive power, and thus he can govern himself. It enables 
the pupil to see the properties and adaptabilities of material things, and he cansub- 
due nature and convert things into wealth. 
Here is the ground for the addition of industrial training to the traditional course 
of study in the common schools. The negro must learn to manage machinery, and 
  make himself useful to the community in which he lives by becoming a skilled _ 
laborer.! Every physical peculiarity may be converted by the cunning of intellect 
into some knack or aptitude which gives its possessor an advantage in. productive 
industry. But the skill to use tools and direct machinery is asuperior gift. Inven- 
tion is fast discounting the value of special gifts of manual dexterity. Scienceis the 
seedcorn, while artisan skill—yes, even art itself—is only the baked bread. 
The first step above brute instinct takes place when man looks beyond things as 
he sees them existing before him, and begins to consider their possibilities; he adds 
ig his external seeing an internal seeing. The world assumes a new aspect; each 
object appears to be of larger scope than in its present existence, for there is a sphere 
of possibility environing it—a sphere which the sharpest animal eyes of lynx or eagle 
can not see, but which man, endowed with this new faculty of inward sight, per- 
ceives at once. To this insight into possibilities there loom up uses and adaptations, 
transformations, and combinations, in along series, stretching into the infinite behind 
each finite real thing. The bodily eye sees the real objects, but can not see the infi- 
nite trails; they are invisible except to the inward eye of the mind. 
What we call directive power on the part of man, his combining and organizing 
capacity, all rests on this ability to see beyond the real things before the senses to 
the ideal possibilities invisible to the brute. The more clearly man sees these ideals, 
the more perfectly he can construct for his behoof another set of conditions than 
those in which he finds himself. 
The school, in so far as it gives intellectual education, aids the pupil by science 
and literature. Science collects about each subject all its phases of existence under 
different conditions; it teaches the student to look at a thing as a whole, and see in 
it not only what is visible before his senses, but also what is invisible—what is not 
realized, but remains dormant or potential. The scientifically educated laborer, 
therefore, is of a higher type than the mere ‘hand laborer,” because he has learned 
to see in each thing its possibilities. He sees each thing in the perspective of its 
history. Here, then, in the educated laborer, we have a hand belonging to a brain 
that directs or that can intelligently comprehend a detailed statement of an ideal to 
be worked out. The laborer and the overseer, or “boss,” are united in one man. 
Hence it is that the productive power of the educated laborer is so great. 
The school may indefinitely reénforce the effect of this general education by adding 
manual training and other industrial branches, taking care to make the instruction 
     
  
1 It is well to understand clearly the formidable character of the obstacles which the negromechanic will be called upon to overcome before he can acquire, in the mechanical trades, any substantial advan- tage from the prosperity which may surround him. Tn the first place, he will encounter race projudice; employers will preter mechanics of their own race, if other conditions are equal. ‘Then he will have to submit to the stress of modern competition, ‘he skilled white mechanic protects himself by his trade union; into that he is not likely to admit the negro mechanic. Lf the skilled negro mechanics form their own trade unions, the superiority of the members must be of the most striking character to create a preponderating influence in their favor in the mind of the employer, who naturally leans towards individuals of his own race. Let the negro unions work at cheaper rates and the white mechanics be forced to come down to the same wages, the former would at once he exposed to those destructive con- ditions to which Ihaye referred. ‘These are the influences that diminish the prospect of the negro taking an active part in the manufacturing development of the South, except in those branches of labor which are distinctly below such as require special skill and training. (P. A, Bruce.)

scientific; for it is science that gives scope and power of adaptation to new condi- 
tions. The instrument of modern civilization is the labor-saving machine. The 
negro can not share in the white man’s freedom unless he can learn to manage ma- 
chinery. Nothing but drudgery remains for a race that can not understand applied 
science. The productive power of a race that works only with its hands is so small 
that only one in the hundred can live in the enjoyment of the comforts of life.- The 
nations that haye conquered nature by the aid of machinery can afford luxury for 
large classes. In Great Britain,! for example, 30 per cent of the families enjoy 
incomes of $1,000 and upwards per annum, while the 70 per cent, constituting the 
so-called “working classes,” have an average of $485 to each family. When we con- 
sider how much this will buy in England, we see that the common laborer of to-day is 
better off for real comforts than the nobleman of three hundred years ago. In France, 
76 per cent, including the working classes, receive $395 per family, while the 24 per 
cent, including the wealthy, get an average of $1,300 and upwards. But in Italy the 
income returns show (in 1881) only 8,500 families with incomes above $1,000, while 
more than 98 per cent of the population average less than $300 for each family.2 Agri- 
culture without manufactures and commerce can not furnish wealth for a large frac- 
tion of the people. But with diversity of industry there is opportunity for many, 
and will be finally forall. The increased use of machinery multiplies wealth, so that 
production doubles twice as often as the population in the United States. 
This is the significance of manual training in our schools, The youth learns how 
to shape wood and iron into machines, and thus how to construct and manage 
machines. The hand worker is to be turned into a brain worker; for the machine 
does the work of the hand, but requires a brain to direct it. Human productive 
industry needs more and more directive power, but less and less mere sleight of hand. 
The negro, educated in manual training, will find himself at home in a civilization 
which is accumulating invention of all sorts and descriptions to perform the work 
necessary to supply the people with food, clothing, and shelter at so cheap a rate as 
to have a large surplus of income to purchase the means of luxury, amusement, and 
culture. 
The friends of the education of the negro, North and South, have seen the impor- 
tance of previding industrial education for him. So long as he ean work only at 
the cultivation of staple crops he can not become a salutary element in the social 
whol When he acquires skill in mechanical industries his presence in the com- 
munity is valued and his person respected. Many colored institutions have been 
founded for the special promotion of skill in the arts and trades, and nearly all of 
the higher institutions have undertaken to provide some facilities for industrial 
éducation. * * * 
With the growing isolation of the negro in his state of freedom comes the neces- 
sity of a well educated clergy? to counteract an increasing tendency to relapse into 
fetichism and magic and all manner of degrading superstitions. The profession of 
Christianity in empty words does not avail anything, and the practical interpreta- 
tion of those words by means of the ideas of fetichism secures and confirms the lew- 
est status of savagery. The more highly educated the colored clergy, the more 
closely are the masses of the people brought into intelligent sympathy with the 
aspirations and endeavors of the white race with whom they live. For it is not the 
abstract dogma that gives vital religion, important though it be as a symbol of the 
highest. It is the correct interpretation of that dogma in terms of concrete vital 
issues which make it a living faith. One must be able to see the present world and 
its Sphinx riddles solved by the high doctrines of his creed, or he does not possess a 
“saving faith.” The preacher who can not, for his illiteracy, see the hand of Prov: 
dence in the instruments of modern civilization—in the steamship, the railroad, the 
telegraph, the morning newspaper, the popular novel, the labor-saving machine, the 
investigations in natural science—is not likely to be of much help in building up a

%As yet public sentiment confines him principally to agricultural or other similarly unremunerative employments. (L. H.

As a rule, the present spiritual guides of the Southern nogroes are self-appointed. he most feasibie plan for promoting this improvement of character seems to be the establishment of alarge number of seminaries, to be controlled absolutely by the white religions denominations, in which the general system of instruction now pursued in the normal institutes, with religious courses predominating, shall be employed for the education of the students.

new civilization, although he may, it is true, administer consolation to souls world- 
sick and weary.! 
The Christian religion, as interpreted by the modern spirit, means not only the 
preparation for death, but, more than this, a preparation for living. The true mis- 
sionary spirit is thoroughly of this character. It bids each human being help his 
brother in all ways that may secure his self-help, Hence the conquest of nature, 
first by means of natural science, and secondly by means of useful inventions, to the 
end that man may be lifted forever above a life of drudgery into a life of intelligent, 
directive power, where brains count more than hands—this conquest is demanded 
by religion asa preliminary missionary movement. 
he labors in social science directed ‘to the end of discov ering the best means of 
administering charity so that it may create activity and enterprise rather than 
demoralize society's weaklings; the improvement of tenement houses, hygienic pre- 
cautions, public parks, and innocent amusements, all that goes to increase the interest 
of man in his fellow men, and especially all that goes to Tift the burden from child- 
hood—the burden that is premature and causes arrested development, stunting the 
soul in its growth—these are Christian instrumentalities, and are seen to be sueh by 
an educated cler; gy. But an illiterate clergy condemns them as works of Antichrist, 
because it can not see the spirit of the doctrines which it preaches. It sounds like 
a paradox to say that the literate is bound by the letter and can not see the spirit, 
butit is true. 
It is quite important that the Tie education of the negro should include Latin 
and Greek. The Anglo-Saxon civilization in which he lives is a derivative one, 
receiving one of its factors from Rome and the other from Athens. The white youth 
is obliged to study the classic languages in order to become conscious of these two 
derivative elements in his life, and it is equally important for the colored youth. 
A “liberal” education by classic study gives to the youth some acquaintance with 
his spiritual embryology. * 
It is clear, from the above Seaciierations, that money expended for the secondary 
and higher education of thenegro accomplishes far more for him than similar expendi- 
tures accomplish for the white people. It is seed sown where it brings forth a hun- 
dred fold,? because each one of the pupils of these higher institutions is a center of 
diffusion of superior methods and refining influences among an imitative and impres- 
sible race. State and national aid as well as private bequest should take this direc- 
tion first. There should be no gifts or bequests for common elementary instruction ; 
this should be left to the common schools, and all ontside aid should be concentrated 
on the secondary and higher instruction, inclusive of industrial education. * * * 
‘The three symbols of our most advanced civilization are the railroad, the morning 
newspaper, and the school. The rural population everywhere is backward in its 
sympathies for these “moderns.” The good school is the instrumentality which 
must precede in order to create this sympathy. But the good school will not spring 
up of itself in the agricultural community. It must be provided for by the urban 
influence of the State and nation. By judicious distribution of general funds, coupled 
with provisions requiring local taxation as a condition of sharing in these funds, 
even the rural districts may be brought up to the standard. The State as a whole 
gains in wealth and in the priceless increase of individual ability by education. 
It was revealed by the census of 1880-that the colored race furnished a dispropor- 
tionate share of illiterates even in the Northern and Pacific groups of States. In the 
Northern group the percentage of colored illiterates was nearly five times as large as 
the percentage of white illiterates—16 per cent for the colored and 3} per cent for 
the white. In the Pacific group the same disproportion prevailed. In the Southern 
section of the colored population of the ages 15 to 20 years the illiterates amounted 
to 67 per cent, while the white illiterates were only 17 per cent of their quota; 
colored illiterates from 10 to 14 were 70 per cent and the white 30 per cent of their 
respective quotas. 
The illiterate person is apt to be intolerant and full of race prejudice, and to this» 
cause we may attribute the larger portion of the feuds* between the races where- 
ever they have existed in the South. But the worst feature of illiteracy is to be   
    
    
1 One of the chief drawbacks to higher civilization in the negro race is the exceeding difficulty of giving a predominant ethical character to his religion. In the black belt religion and virtue are olten Considered as distinet and separable things. ‘The moral clement, good character, is eliminated from the essential ingredients of Christianity, and good citizenship, womanliness, truth, chastity, honesty, cleanliness, trustworthiness, are not always of the essence of religions obligation. An intelligont, pions, courageous ministry is indispensable to any hopeful attempt to lift up the negro rac, (J.L. ry.) 
2 The wisest course to pursue at prosent is to employ every means to widen the scope and perfect the methods of the normal schools for the negroes. ‘Tho Hampton Institute represents in an eminent degree the true principle to be applied in this age to their improvement, throuzh the public, school, that principle being embodied in the careful selection of the best material which the race affords for instructors of the young. (P..A. Bruce.) 3Tho feuds spring almost wholly from the enmity of the whites. ‘The negroes generally stand for the lamb drinking below and muddying the stream above. (L. H. Blair.)

found in the fact that it is impenetrable to the influence of the nowspaper. En- 
lightened public opinion depends so much on the daily newspaper that it is not pos- 
sible without it; and lacking this, an ideal self-government is not to be thought of. 
The most advanced form of government is that by public opinion. This is essen- 
tially a newspaper form of government. The extension of the railroad system into 
all parts of the South will carry the urban influence to the towns and villages, every 
station being a radiating center for the daily newspapers of the metropolis. The 
education that comes from the daily survey of the events of the world, and a delib- 
erate consideration of the opinions and verdicts editorially written in view of these 
events, is a supplement or extension of the school. It takes the place of the village 
gossip which once furnished the mental food for the vast majority. School educa- 
tion makes possible this participation in the world process of thought by means of 
the printed page. The book and periodical come to the individual, and prevent the 
mental paralysis or arrested development that used to succeed the school days of the 
rural population. 
With the colored people all educated in schools and become areading people inter- 
ested in the daily newspaper; with all forms of industrial training accessible to 
them, and the opportunity so improved that every form of mechanical and manufac- 
turing skill has its quota of colored working men and women; with a colored min- 
istry educated in a Chistian theology interpreted in the missionary spirit, and find- 
ing its auxiliaries in modern science and modern literature—with these educational 
essentials, the negro problem for the South will be solved without recourse to violent 
measures of any kind, whether migration or disfranchisement or ostracism.! Mu- 
tualrespect for moral and intellectual character, for useful talents and industry, will 
surely not lead to miscegenation, but only to what is desirable, namely, te civil and 
political recognition. ©    
Susceptibility of the negro to advancement.—Prof. H. Clay Armstrong, jr. (Alabama): 
We have but to look at his condition to-day and the illustrious examples of negro 
achievement in individual instances and compare these with the barbarian of two 
hundred and fifty years ago and less, or eyen twenty-five years ago, to convince us 
that chopping cotton is not the limit of negro capability. * * * In fact there 
are dangers that in some sections of the South the negroes may win in the race for edu- 
cationaladyancement. They are worshipful of intellect, and ambitious, you may say, 
as arace, and especially so in some communities; fond of exhibit, perfectly ableand 
willing to live scantily and send their children to school when their white neighbor 
would think it necessary to have his sons to help him maintain his more pretentious 
standard of life; perfect children in their love of approbation; with these charac- 
teristics we need never fear that the negro will lose the effects of all our educational 
efforts for him. We had rather fear that the result of the race between the‘negro 
and the plebeian class that now, as noticeably as before the war, stand between the 
slave owner and the former slave will be victory for the negro. 
  Race characteristics of the negro.—Dr. J.T. Scarcy, in an address before the Alabama 
Educational Association: In the acquiring department, as exhibited on the planta- 
tionsandin the schools, negroes ate very apt up to a certain age—when they begin to 
reach adult life. In the plays of childhood and in the acquisitions of the primary 
schools, the negro children show abilities which compare very favorably, and taken 
as criteria of mental abilities to come they are often misleading. The negro chil- 
dren who show the same acquiring abilities in childhood, fall further and further be- 
hind, as a rule, as the activities incident to adult life come into play. They fall 
behind then in acquiring abilities, further behind in judgment and reason, and still 
further behind in tenacity of purpose and decision of character. Such differences 
come into strong relief as age advances, and as the tests of competitive life bring 
them into view. I believe it is very evident that the more advanced the type of 
race, the later in life do brain capacities ripen, or fully mature. This is another 
point in which individuals in the same race differ, and one in which races differ. 
These facts all contribute to explain the manifold disappointments of those enthu- 
siastic friends, who in the past twenty-five years rushed into the field, filled with 
the wildest expectations, believing, on the basis of old-fashioned philosophy, that 
all that is necessary in his case is to give him instruction and education, when he 
would stand out in all the capacities of the highest manhood, fully able to hold his    
  1 Freedom itself is educatory. ‘The energy of representative institutions is a valuable schoolmaster. ‘To control one's labor, to enjoy the earnings of it, to make contracts freely, to have the right of loco- motion and change of residence and business, have a helpful influence on manhood. ‘These conerete and intelligible acts affect the negro far more than abstract speculations, or ntiment, or the low processes of remote and combined causes. They require prompt and spo: learns from personal experience that he is a constituent member of society. Unquestionably, he some- times makes Indicrous mistakes, is guilty of offensive selfassertion, but despite these errors there is perceptible and hopeful progress. (J. L. I. C.)

own in the competitions of the European society which surroundshim. I have been 
showing that such ideas are often a delusion as regards the children of European 
parents, and it is the most natural of all facts that it should be the case with the 
African children. 
The philanthropists of the past have held these ideas to their practical disappoint- 
ment in a great many cases as regards the civilization of the so-called heathen races. 
They have thought that all that is necessary, in their several cases, is that some 
one shall be sent to instruct them in the ways of the civilization of the advanced 
‘races of Europe, when they would be equally as capable. The history of such 
work all over the world has shown that the races civilize just to the level of their 
several inherent abilities, and afterwards maintain civilization in accordance with 
their capacities. The ethnologist could almost anticipate the degree of the success 
of the missionary by a study of the type and lineage of the race, and by giving an 
opinion on their inherent mental abilities. * * * 
I have said that no race or people is uniform inmembership. There are some 
notable exceptions to the general average among the negroes, which can be accounted 
for on natural principles. There are higher and lower grades among the negroes, 
because there were to some extent differences among them when first imported and, 
secondly, to their forced artificial culture and improvement during their servitude; 
thirdly, to causes known nowadays as natural and sexual selection, and, fourthly, 
to miscegenation. These causes have produced some lines among them pointing 
towards excellent ability to compete, safety, and survival, but the very large major- 
ity hold the level, in the European society that surrounds them, of the classes point- 
ing towards elimination. In intellectual and in ethical abilities they occupy the 
ranks of the eliminating classes as a ruie. 
Like all such classes of men, white or black, the negro does not bear success well. 
Acquisition of property, more rapidly than among the whites, begets at once inac- 
tivity and idleness, and consequent rapid deterioration of line. The children of for- 
tunate parents among them, by reason of idle deterioration of ability, rapidly lose 
their property, and when in some lines examples of excellent intellectual abilities 
are shown, because it is exceptional in the course, the next generation seldom show 
age. 
Time and the same natural processes that are of universal application over the 
whole world, by which races have risen into excellence and again fallen into deca- 
dence, prevail among the negroes as well, notwithstanding sympathy and sentiment 
have endeavored to show their case as an exceptional one. There is abundant lati- 
tude in this country for the negro, as well as everybody else, to help himself. 
Self-help improves. Strength and accomplishment come only by practice and exer- 
cise. The auto-activity of the line of descent alone gives permanency to capacity, 
and it can not be donated, it can only be acquired. 
Progress of the negro.—Samuel J. Barrows (Boston): My recent trip through the 
South covered about 3,500 miles. It led me through portions of Virginia, the Caro- 
linas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. I spent 
proportionately more time in the black belt. I visited the great centers and went 
through the agricultural districts. I paid special attention to social, industrial, 
and educational conditions. One question was constantly before me: What is the 
result of twenty-five years of freedom? Four lines of inquiry were constantly pur- 
sued: What is the negro doing for himself? What is the white man doing for him? 
How are the two races getting on together? What is the negro’s view of the 
situation? 
Industrially.—There were many who predicted that, when freedom came, Uncle 
Ned, in the spirit of the old song, would “lay down de shobel and de hoe;” but 
Uncle Ned did nothing of the kind. He took a firmer grip upon it, and advertised 
for a situation. He did not have to go far to seek one. His old master was the very 
one who wanted him. I was impressed in the South with the general fact that the 
negro had remained pretty much where the war left him. He was at first only a 
farm laborer. Many have since become farm renters, and others are on the way to 
become farm owners. The economic conditionsare hard. The negro is handicapped 
by the mortgage system, or the lien upon the crop. He buys his goods on time. 
The time price is twice as high as the cash price. He pays exorbitant rates of in- 
terest, and heavy commissions for freightage, storage, etc. Zaccheus still exists, but 
it is the colored man who is up the tree. Yet there are thousands of negroes who 
have shown that they can break from this commercial bondage. In the mechanical 
trades, in commercial life, in the professions, the doors stand open to them, and they 
are entering into them. ‘There is a new stimulus to inventive genius, 
Socially.—It is possible to see the negro in all stages of social evolution. In the 
black belt you find the one-roomed cabin without windows; but cabins with one 
window, or two windows, with two rooms instead of one room, are becoming more 
common in the agricultural districts. Home-buying is rapidly going on. There is

asteady accumulation of property. Social refinements are increasing with the bet- 
ter environment. Gradually a prosperous and moneyed class is rising. The love of 
color and the love of music, two fine tastes of the negro, may be expected to become 
important factors in his development. 
Educationally,—The interest of the negroes in education is immense. They have 
discovered that it is the ladder on which they mustrise. Both children and parents 
are making great sacrifices to secure it. They are not only availing themselves of 
the primary schools, but are supplementing the school fund and establishing and 
supporting higher schools. The enrollment of colored children in schools has im- 
mensely increased. In some districts they literally fill the doors and windows of the 
schoolhouses. Their capacity for higher education has been demonstrated. A new 
interest in industrial education is exhibited. 
Religion.—The negro has always been marked by strong religious feeling. It has 
found expression mainly in emotional forms. His religion has been marked by 
voodooism and other superstitions. With his growth in education, he is breakin 
away from these. There is a marked difference between the rising generation an 
their parents in this respect. In tke cities, especially, the extravagant emotionalism 
that characterized the slave days is much less frequently found. 
Ethically.—Before the war the negro had no rights of property. He therefore 
could have little conception of what rights pertained to property. With the 
acquisition of property he is learning the difference between mine and thine. The 
family relation was not respected. There is still a great work to be done in elevat- 
ing the moral standard of the colored race, but a gain is evident. Too much de- 
pendence must not be placed upon criminal statistics. A great many negroesare put 
into prison or the chain gang who do not belong there. ‘The fault is more with the 
system and its administration than with the offender. Indeed, the p: 
e South, both as relates to white and colored people, greatly needs re 
Codperative tendencies.—The negro has had to learn how to organize. The 
growth of building associations, benevolent associations, banks, and, in a few cases 
of codperative organizations, illustrates the development of the organic spirit. 
What is the white man doing for him? I have spoken of what the negro is doing 
for himself, but a chapter might be written also on what the white man is doing 
for him. Statistics will show how large a sum proportionately to their means the 
white people are paying for the education of the negro. The Southern whites of 
the better class recognize the fact that the colored man must beeducated. This sen- 
timent is finding fresh expression in educational, religious, and political gatherings. 
Many instances might’ be given of the individual generosity and helpfulness of 
Southern whites toward their colored neighbors. I simply wish to recognize in a 
general way the kindly, helpful, and sympathetic spirit which the better class of 
Southern white people exhibit toward the education and development of the negro, 
My third question, How are the two races getting on together? will, perhaps, be- 
sufficiently answered in the fourth, What is the negro’s view of the situation? 
In going through the South I was greatly interested to find what the average 
negro and the great mass of colored people, educated and uneducated, think of the 
situation. I visited the centers of negro population and sought the testimony of 
their acknowledged leaders in social, industrial, and political matters. * * * 
What impressed me in these conferences was the cheerful, manly tone of the stu- 
dents when they gave their own opinions. Their grievances were the last. thing 
they spoke of. In one respect their testimony was nearly unanimous—that the col- 
pee pecnle can do more to settle the negro problem than the white people can do 
‘or them. 
Another fact seems equally evident to the negro and to the intelligent white man. 
It is that the problem, such as it is, isto be settled in the South. The negro is 
there, and means to stay there; and the white man means to have him there. The 
problem can not be shifted by emigration or any other device; first, because the 
negro is taking root just where he is; and, secondly, because the white man is rooted 
alongside of him, A colored man in Alabama said: “If a colored man knows how 
to use his muscle, I think he can do as well in Montgomery as in any other place.” 
Another said: “In regard to living in the South, I think if a man has a trade he can 
get along there as well as anywhere else. He can do better than in some places.” 
Another man from Georgia said: “A good point in the South is that all trades are 
open to colored people. They do not seem tobe shut out of any. My brother is a 
carpenter, and he builds as many houses for whites as for colored. I have just re- 
ceived a letter,” he said, “from my brother, saying that he had bought a white 
man’s home place. The white men are going to the cities, and the colored men are 
buying their property.” The same man from Georgia said: ‘I do not think our 
condition in.the South isso bad. Under the circumstances, I think it is very good. 
The prospects of the colored man in the South are better than in the North. It is 
for him to come up, and show himself worthy of what he has got.” Similar testi- 
mony was given by a colored lawyer in Baltimore:     
-P-A-G-E-331

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. + OS 
“My belief is that the best avenue for the colored man is in the South. In the 
North he gets a better show for civil privilege, but in the South he gets a better 
chance to accumulate something.” This man was born in Virginia. In a public ad- 
dress he said: ‘‘ The best friends of the colored man are at the South. The colored 
people are not among the Northern people in sufficient numbers for them to line a 
policy in regard to them. Baltimore is a city intensely Southern in sentiment, but 
this city offers every opportunity that the white man has. I have almost as much 
white practice as colored practice. We find members of all the learned professions 
to be of the better class of people. If they meet a man, they expect him to be up to 
his profession. . If they are going to meet him on equal grounds, they expect him to 
be equal to them. Ido not ask anything for the colored man except an equal op- 
portunity with the white man; and then, if he can not keep up, let him take a back 
seat.” Such testimony might be multiplied. It is the testimony of the colored peo- 
ple on the ladder, the men who have climbed and the men who are climbing. 
The colored man is rapidly learning another lesson: That the dollar will buy not 
only food and clothing, but somal position and influence. The colored preacher 
does not now often preach that “the love of money is the root of all evil.” 
Avenues of employment.—Rev. J. Braden, president of Central Tennessee College, 
Nashville, at Colored Educators’ Convention, December, 1891: To the query, What can 
the highly educated colored mando? What places of honor, trust, responsibility are 
or will be epened to him? We answer that we need not cross a river till we reach 
it, nor climb a mountain till it is in our path. Let us give the white people a little 
credit for the usual amount of common sense and common selfishness which belong 
te our common humanity. In the days of slavery they knew how to avail themselves 
of our labors, of our skill as mechanics. . They took some pleasure in employing us 
because we could do the work they wanted done. They found that we could clear 
and plow their plantations, and they let us de it. We could cook their food, wash 
their clothes, nurse their children, and we did it. ~They found we could mend their 
plows, shoe their horses, make their wagons, build their fences, their pens, their 
stables, and even their houses, and they let us do it. They found that we were good 
to black shoes, brush their clothes, wait on table, drive their carriages, and they let 
us do it. 
As freedmen they have been equally as willing to employ us in all these avoca- 
tions. They have done more. They have let us work their land as renters, work on 
shares, paying for rent often a8 much as the land was worth. Sometimes we have 
come out a little ahead, but more frequently behind. But what is that when we 
have been trusted with the responsibility of managing a plantation in our own way? 
We have bossed the job, and have nobody to blame, perhaps, but ourselves, the man 
who weighed the cotton, and the merchant who sold us the corn meal and bacon. 
But they have done more than this; they have taxed themselves to build school- 
houses for us, and have actually put thousands of us in these schoolhouses as teachers 
of our own children. They have done more; they have permitted us to educate 
many of our young men in medicine on this sacred southern soil, and have licensed 
them to practice medicine without limiting that practice, by law, to colored people; 
they have turned these colored M. D’s loose in this sonthland to practice on patients 
who may choose to call on them, when needing medical aid. 
They have admitted our young men to practice in all the courts of the country, 
and the gentlemanly, cultured, well-equipped lawyer who has the ability to commans 
the respect of the bench and other members of the bar, has it, though he be black 
enough to be invisible. The white man has found it to his interest to use us as 
slaves, as servants, and to open the higher avenues of labor to us in the professions, 
If he has done all this for us, will he not use us in any capacity in which we can 
serve him, when we are prepared for it? 
What cares the sick man for the color of the man whom he believes is most skill- 
fal in diagnosing his disease and prescribing the proper remedies? What eares the 
injured man, whose broken bones need the skill of the experienced surgeon, about 
the color of the hands that set the bones and give him back the use of his limbs? 
What does the dying man care about the color of the hand that ties an artery and 
saves his life? What does the man care for the color of the lawyer who wins his 
case, saves his home, and keeps his family from want? What the country is waiting 
for is white men or black who have developed to the utmost their intellectual power, 
who have schooled themselves to think soberly, deeply, righteously ; who have con- 
victions on the great, live questions of the day, and who have both the ability and 
courage to maintain these convictions, 
Training schools.—Rev. J. E. Rankin: Schools of training for the African are espe- 
cially needed, becanse no man will take him as an apprentice, and no man wants to 
work by his side as only his equal. This is one of the fangs of slavery which will 
be slow to come out. Here are 8,000,000 of people. Shall they not have the privi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
  980 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
lege of building houses for themselves and for each other? Must the Anglo-Saxon 
insist upon the great industries as his monopoly? The problem which Afro-Ameri- 
cans have to solve is not really solved without that independence which can come 
only from a knowledge of handicrafts. Intellectual culture should go hand in hand 
with industrial training. The African ought to be supplied with men of his own 
color, competent to plan houses and build them, to take the lead in any of the trades. 
ae aud thus only, can he stand alone; wherever you throw him he will land on 
‘is feet. 
Need of colored dentists.—G. W. Hubbard, M. D., of Meharry Medical College, Nash- 
ville, Tenn.: It was formerly supposed that colored people seldom required the sery- 
ices of a dentist; however this may have been in the past, it certainly is not true 
now, and at the present time one or more well qualified colored dentists would be 
well patronized in every large city in the South; and as the people increase in intel- 
ligence and wealth they will realize more and more the importance of caring for and 
preserving their teeth. Owing to public sentiment the Southern white dentists can 
not, in many localities, treat colored_patients, and they would gladly welcome well- 
educated colored dentists who could relieve them of this embarrassment. 
Industrial excellences of the colored man.—Judge A. W. Tourgee, at the Mohonk 
Conference: So much has been said this morning about the industrial deficiencies 
of the colored people of the South that I have been greatly surprised at the omis- 
sion of any reference to the other side of the question—their industrial excellences. 
I have always been less impressed with the industrial needs of the colored man than 
his industrial achievements. From 1865 until 1880 I had a peculiarly good oppor- 
tunity for observing his qualities both as an agricultural and mechanical laborer, 
having first and last had some hundreds in my employ, and during much of thetime 
each year travelling in different parts of the State in which I then lived. As a re- 
sult of constant study of their conditions since emancipation, I do not hesitate to 
say that the colored people of the South have accomplished more in twenty-five 
years, from an industrial point of view, than any people on the face of the earth 
ever before achieved under anything like such unfavorable circumstances. 
The manner in which they live and the things they do not do have been alluded 
to here as if they were racial qualities, and not fortuitous, resulting conditions. I 
was much impressed with the suggestions of more than one who has spoken as to 
what they should be taught to do, as if they were industrial babes. I would like 
to see any of their advisers give the colored man lessons in the management of a 
mule, or teach him to raise a crop of corn or cotton or tobacco, or work a bad hill- 
side at the South. In those forms of industry which they have had an opportunity 
to acquire, they have shown an aptitude and success which are simply amazing, 
when we consider their previous lack of opportunity to learn management, thrift, 
and economy. The Northern man is always prompt to criticise their agricultural 
methods, yet the Northern farmer who goes South and relies upon his own judgment 
and his own labor is very generally a failure. 
Industrial education.—Gen. 8.C. Armstrong: The main thing, then, in the indus- 
trial system is to open as widely and broadly as possible opportunities for agricul- 
tural, mechanical, and household industries, which shall provide Negro students 
means to support themselves and to develop character. Character is the foundation. 
The training that our pupils get is an endowment. An able-bodied student repre- 
sents a capital of, perhaps, a thousand dollars. We propose to treble that. When 
they learn a trade they are worth threefold more in the labor market. Last Satur- 
day I gave my final words to our graduating class. I said to those forty-five schol- 
ars: ‘‘How many of you can go out into the world and, if you can not get a school, 
_ how many can work in some line of industry and so support yourselves?” There 
was aroar. Every one said, ‘‘I can,” and every one laughed. ‘They go out into the 
world smiling at difficulties, happy in their pluck and purpose and skill,

INTRODUCTION. 
The birth of the first graded school occurred in 1537, when Johann Sturm organ- 
ized his famous school at Strasburg. His plan originally contemplated nine classes, 
corresponding with the nine years that pupils were expected to spend in his gym- 
nasium, each class having its own teacher, its prescribed studies, examinations, and 
promotions, in very much the same way that our schools of to-day have. Sturm 
was one of the most celebrated schoolmasters of his day, and his methods were 
widely copied. The Jesuits adapted his system of organization to their needs, and 
their schools on this plan were established all over Europe and attained great popu- 
larity. The division into yearly classes in the modern German gymnasia and the 
French lycées undoubtedly has its origin in the same source. 
The American graded school, however, is a growth which has arisen on our own 
soil, and while it finally showed some of the features of the European method of 
organization, these did not appear until the system had reached a certain degree 
of perfection in the line of its own evolution. 
In the first part of this century—it almost seems like ancient history, now that 
the conditions everywhere are so different—the grading of elementary schools was a 
thing unknown in this country. Instruction was almost whollyindividual. When- 
ever a pupil chose to present himself for admission into school, no matter at what time 
of the year, he was received. His studies were determined by the books he brought. 
His first lesson was apt to follow the last one his former teacher had given him. It 
he had been through Webster’s ‘‘blue-back” speller twice, and had finished the lasf 
column of the tenth page on the third round, the first column on the eleventh page 
would naturally be the first lesson his new teacher would give him. If a class 
already formed had reached just that point he was put into that class. Otherwise he 
would probably form anew class. It was thus by no means uncommon to see a dozen 
or more classes in the same room studying the same book, but at a dozen or more stages 
of advancement in it, and altogether, a teacher with a school of moderate size, con- 
taining pupils of all ages, sexes, and sizes, might easily have 50 or 60 classes. 
Attend to them all? Certainly, but what attention! The little fellows recej ved 
but little of it, especially those who had learned to read. Their lessons woul d be 
heard—every few days. The teacher’s pet classes were called to the recitation bench 
often; his favorite subjects received nearly all his attention. ‘The rest of the school 
whiled away the time as best they might. They ‘did their sums” on their slates, 
or droned over their ‘‘ blue-backs ” till they were tired, and then turned their atten- 
tion to cach other and to mischief, opportunities for which frequently appeared in 
the open mouth or bare soles of a sleeping pupil; and such opportunities rarely 
went unimproved. 
Such were the schools of our fathers, the merits of which we so frequently hear ex- 
tolled. They produced many strong men; for the favored ones the advantages of such 
schools aremanifest. Butthe great majority made but little progress, either through

the sheer neglect of the teacher or because, with impartial treatment, the multiplicity 
of classes made it absolutely impossible for the teacher to give sufficient time to any 
class to enable his pupils to accomplish anything of real value. 
The result is clearly shown in the statement made by one of the early State super- 
intendents that many young men and women who had attended the common district 
schools for fifteen or sixteen winters absolutely failed in the lowest grade of teachers’ 
examinations, requiring but little more than a mere rudimentary education. 
In the general educational revival in the thirties the need of some sort of effect- 
ive classification was frequently mentioned. Horace Mann’s first report, in 1836, 
contains a suggestion as to building schoolhouses with a view to the classification 
of the pupils, and many other propositions appeared with the same end in view; but 
all these were vague and nebulous. The necessity for reform was apparent, but 
actual methods for accomplishing it did not readily appear. The most that seemed 
to be feasible to the writers of the time was a division into three departments, 
usually mentioned as primary, intermediate, and high. ch one of these was to be 
taught by a single teacher, who should conduct the exercises in much the same way 
as before, excepting, of course, that there would be fewer classes and the pupils 
would be nearer the same age. Many schools were soon organized on this plan and 
came to be known as “union schools,” because they were usually formed by consoli- 
dating schools already existing. 
It is always difficult to say with certainty who was first in any field of effort, or 
to fix the exact locality in which any meritorious movement began, and the ease of 
the union schools forms no exception to the rule; but it is probable that in 
Boston, where the distinction between the Latin school, grammar schools, and infant 
schools dates from a very early period, is to be found the first move toward grading 
that was made in this country. But even there the distinction was not well marked. 
until a comparatively late period, for in a paper read by S. M. Burnside before the 
meeting of the American Institute of Instruction in Boston in 1832 it was stated 
that the schools of the village of Worcester had been conducted for eight years 
upon a plan similar to that described, and the difficulties mentioned by the writer as 
hindering the perfection of the scheme clearly show that the plan was an innova- 
tion presenting unfamiliar difficulties whose solution was not to be sought in the 
experience of his hearers. 
As time Wore on the advantages of the union schools became more and more man- 
-ifest, and with experience in them came more definite plans for their improvement, 
though it was not until the latter part of the decade of 1840-50 that comparatively 
full and practical details for the organization of a graded school as we now under- 
stand it began to appear. 
John D. Philbrick was placed in charge of the Quincey grammar school in Boston 
in 1847, and then under him the full details of a graded school began to be worked 
out for the first time in this country. Then it was, too, that the old ideas of Sturm, 
which had been transmitted to the nineteenth century from the sixteenth by means 
of the Jesuit schools and the secondary schools of Continental Europe, began to be 
suceessfully applied to American elementary education, and under Philbrick’s skillful 
guidance the graded school, with yearly grades, each taught by a single teacher, and 
a regularly outlined course of studies, came into being. 
The success of the new system was quickly published to the pedagogical world, 
and graded schools soon became the fad of the progressive element of schoolmen. 
The spread of the idea of professional supervision was concurrent with the devel- 
opment of the graded system, and in fact the perfection of the latter was the legit- 
imate outcome of the extension of the former. 
Many difficulties, however, attended the application of the graded system, some of 
which seem to us inexplicable. For instance, it was at one time doubted and ear- 
nestly discussed whether there were any right on the part of the schoo] authorities 
to prescribe a course of studies or to specify the text-books to be used, such things 
being seriously asserted to be intrusions on the right of the parent to determine 
what sort of education was suited to his child. Then, too, the practical difficulty 
arose of adapting the buildings already existing to the requirements of the new sys- 
tem. But these troubles gave way to the evident advantages of the graded school 
in both economy and efficiency, and by 1860 grading was the rule in nearly all the- 
cities and large villages. 
In many localities the system was not, for various reasons, applied in the manner 
in which it was advocated by its most enthusiastic supporters, but during the six- 
ties and early seventies strict adherence to a rigid system of classification into 
grades of yearly interval, with the attending features of annual promotions, 
written examinations, per cented markings, etc., was to be found in nearly every 
town or city of any considerable size. 
The pendulum had swung from the extreme of no system to the extreme of all 
system. 
Then critics began to appear; and the bed of Procrustes entered upon its long

tour of duty as a simile for the graded system. Perhaps the reader is not unfa- 
miliar with it even in the educational literature of the present time. 
Among these critics were to be found men who had participated in the adminis- 
tration of systems upon the rigid plan as well as those whose experience had been 
in schools of a somewhat different type, a few words concerning which may not 
be amiss, 
It has already been stated that the idea of grading arose from the consolidation of 
schools. In such cases the increase of pupils had previously been provided for by 
the establishment of new and independent schools, and upon the consolidation each 
teacher retained much of his independence. As pupils furtherincreased in numbers 
the principle of equality of teachers was to a great extent continued in the further 
subdivision of the pupils forming new grades until the point was reached of having 
a separate teacher for each year’s work. 
The other type of schools grew according to another plan. When the number of 
pupils became too great for one man an assistant would be employed who would 
“hear the lessons” of the classes indiscriminately as the principal directed. At first 
the assistant would oecupy a distant corner of the principal’s room, but as time 
passed on separate rooms were provided for them, the pupils sitting ordinarily in 
the principal’s room, and going into the assistant’s room to “say” their lessons. 
Thus far there was no real departure from the old plan. The methods of manage- 
ment were the same, and the intervals between the classes as short as before, the 
only difference being that there were more teachers to care for the greater number 
of pupils. 
the effect of the discussion of classification is seen in these schools in the estab- 
lishment of ‘‘ primary departments,” “intermediate departments,” and ‘grammar 
departments,” etc., as the schools grew larger, but in each of the departments there 
was an entirely independent principal teacher, all of whose pupils sat in his toom 
when at study and proceeded to adjoining recitation rooms to receive from assist- 
ants the lessons which the principal had not time to give. This was the ‘“ depart- 
ment system” as distinguished from the “ graded system.” 
In the course of time the advantages of the graded system became so plain that all 
the principal cities swung intoline. St. Louis determined upon its adoption in 1857, 
though it was several years before it was fully in operation. But the old traditions 
remained. The “department plan” during the years in which it had been in operation 
had been systematized to a great extent and most of the objections tothe old ungraded 
schools had been modified out of existence. The classes were certainly numerous as 
judged by the standards of the graded system, but not so numerous as to be harmfal. 
The teachers were accustomed to conduct a number of classes. The schools were 
running smoothly in that groove, and to a certain extent they stayel in it after 
the adoption of the graded system, for when a full and detailed course of study was 
first adopted for the St. Louis schools in 1862, we find that the unit of division was 
the quarter, and not the year; that the average interval between classes was ten 
weeks instead of forty, and that each teacher instructed not one class only, but two, 
three, or even four or more classes—plainly all relics of the old department plan of 
instruction. In short, in the cities of which St. Louis is the type the rigid graded 
system has never been in vogue as it was in most of the Eastern cities. 
Tt was but natural that prominent among the first to point out the defects and dan- 
gers of the rigid system was W. T. Harris, who, as assistant principal, principal, 
assistant superintendent, and superintendent of the St. Louis schools had been 
accustomed to the elasticity.of the system there, and who, more than anyone else, 
was responsible for it. 
In his report for 187172 he set forth the advantages of the St.Louis system as 
opposed to the system involving long intervals between classes and set times for 
promotion from grade to grade. The report attracted wide attention and was 
warmly discussed in educational gatherings. Among the most conspicuous of the 
advocates of the rigid system at that time was Supt. H. M. Harrington, of New Bed- 
ford, Mass., who went so far as to hold that even individual promotions at times other 
than the end of the school year are pernicious. 
The effect of this and similar discussions 1s apparent in the many modifications 
that have been made in the graded system, all tending to relax its rigidity and make 
it meet the needs of individual pupils in a way that wasimpossible with the former - 
plan of classification and promotion. 
With a view to ascertaining to what extent these modifications have been made in 
the annual intervals between classes which for y prevailed almost universally 
the inquiry whose result is appended was instituted. All cities and villages of 4,000 
inhabitants and upward, 816 in number, were addressed, the questions covering not 
only the methods in use, but also the views of the superintendents, the latter indi- 
cating to what extent further changes may be expected. Four hundred and sixty- 
five superintendents replied. Of these, 149 report that in all grades up to and includ- 
ing the cighth elementary grade the class intervals are less than a school year. 
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-336
  984 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
These cities may be said to have adopted the short interval plan entire, since the 
eighth is usually the highest elementary grade. 
The statement is sometimes made that short intervals are peculiar to the schools 
of Western cities. That no such geographical limitation exists is evident from an 
examination of the list of cities in which the plan prevails. Forty-seven of the cities 
are located in the North Atlantic division, 4 in the South Atlantic, 12 in the South 
Central, 77 in the North Central, and 9 in the Western. 
Many small cities, in which the pupils are too few to secure classes of the requi- 
site size with shorter intervals, retain the yearly plan in the higher grades through 
necessity, although the preferences of the superintendents are in the other direction. 
In many systems, however, the long interval is the rule in the higher grades through 
the choice of the managers. In Denver, Colo., for instance, the interval is three 
months in the lowest grade, four months in the second, four and a half months, or a 
half year, in the third to the sixth, inclusive, and a year in the seventh and eighth. 
A few superintendents who adhere in theory to the strict year plan report shorter 
intervals in the lowest grades as the result of the admission of new pupils in the 
midst of the school year. 
The great disparity between the number of those who express a decided prefer- 
ence for short intervals in reply to direct questions, and the number of cities in 
which such class intervals actually exist is remarkable. This may be explained in 
part by the impression that seems to prevail that short intervals involve a more 
frequent change of teachers and a greater number of them, and consequently a 
greater expense. This, of course, need not follow, but the belief that such is the 
result is undoubtedly the reason that a great many who perceive what they consider 
the pernicious effects of the yearly intervals do not apply the remedy. In many 
cases a change to the short interval has been determined upon, but not yet put in 
operation. Cleveland, Ohio, is a conspicuous example. 
These two causes, with the prevalent spirit of conservatism, may be the explana- 
tion for the differences between the theory as indicated by the replies to the ques- 
tions and the practice as shown by the table. 
It may be observed that no description has been attempted in the foregoing of the 
points of difference between the several plans mentioned, that having been left to 
the appended quotations from the superintendents under whose direction the respec- 
tive methods are in operation. They are best fitted to describe their methods and 
they know best the advantages offered by the systems they advocate. It is intended 
to present as far as may be all the principal plans in use, and the strongest argu- 
ments for each. 
Following the quotations showing the several devices is a presentation of the 
substance of all the replies to the questions asked in the circular. These serve to 
indicate the trend of sentiment upon the question under consideration. 
The tabular statements following are self-explanatory. They show the statistics 
of class intervals in all the 465 cities reported, the names of the 149 cities in which 
the intervals are less than a year, and the details of arrangement of the intervals in 
41 of the largest cities of the United States. 
I QUOTATIONS SHOWING THE SEVERAL METHODS OF ARRANGEMENT 
OF CLASS INTERVALS. 
A.—TuE SHorT AND IRREGULAR INTERVAL. 
THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SHORT INTERVAL, 
W. T. Harris, in his report as superintendent of the St. Louis (Mo.) public schools, 
1871-72.—The tendency of all classification is to unite pupils of widely different 
attainments. Especially is this found in the small schools. The consequence is that 
the lesson is too long for some and too short for others. The best pupils in the class 
are not tried to the full extent of their ability; they consequently lose in some 
degree the discipline which they should gain. The poorest pupils of the class are 
strained to the utmost. They are dragged, as it were, over the ground without 
haying time to digest it as they should. This develops the result that the over- 
worked pupils are frequently discouraged and drop out of the class and likely enough 
out of the school altogether. In large systems of schools where classification is very 
perfect the evil here spoken of need not occur to a serious degree. But it does so 
very frequently from the fact that the course of study is laid out in grades (ten, 
more or less, in number) and all pupils are classified or graded so that each belongs 
to one of these grades. All the pupils in the grade must be in the same degree of 
advancement at about the same time. The result is that the school is classified in 
such a way that there are ten classes separated by intervals of from five to ten 
months’ work. Then promotion is made from one grade to another at set times,

annually or semiannually. All who pass the examination commence the werk of the 
next grade; all who do not continue until the next examination in the work of the 
grade through which they have just passed. 
The effects of this is well known to all teachers who have made experiments in 
this direction. Both parent and pupil feel very keenly the time lost. The pupil 
must have been over much of the work of the year; perhaps nine-tenths, or three- 
quarters, or perhaps only one-half of it. Yet what he has done entitles him to an 
advanced position over his fellow-pupils of the next class below him. If he returns 
to school after being thrust back a year for his lack of less than half a year, he ap- 
pears in the ranks of a class who were a year’s work behind him. He has lost his 
ambition; he is some time in the class before they come to work that is difficult to 
arouse him to the exertion of his full energies. Meanwhile he has lost his discipline 
for hard study, and he is very likely to break down a second time on the work of 
the year. A second failure for promotion is nearly sure to cause withdrawal from 
school. The parent has lost faith in the talent of his child, and puts him into busi- 
ness or appentices him to a trade. The youth has lost his own confidence in him- 
self, and is stunted for intellectual growth for the rest of his life. 
Was there any advantage in this kind of grading? How could it otherwise have 
transpired? Instead of the Procrustean bed of grades, the pupils should have been 
classitied into classes of thirty or lesseach. These classes in all large schools would 
be separated by intervals of about five wecks’ work. As often as these classes, any 
of them, become too small by the withdrawal of pupils, or too large by the assign- 
ment to them of newcomers, there should be a new formation of classes. The best 
pupils of one class should be sent up to the next, the best from the next below are 
to peimomoted and joined with the pupils remaining. Those not promoted are now 
united with the best of the class that is five weeks’ work behind them. The degra- 
dation is scarcely felt. Itis rather called, in both cases, a promotion of the best 
oues—not a degrading of the poorest. It is a process of cutting up the school into 
classes anew, and, as a matter of fact, the pupils need not have changed rooms to 
any very great extent. 
A set time for examination and promotion is injurious just in the ratio of its in- 
frequency. Annual examinations for promotion and a discontinuance of promotions 
at other times is an extremely pernicious system, and occasions serious injury to the 
higher grades of our schools. It is evident that the farther advanced the pupil the 
more unfavorably will it affect him; and yet in our schools throughout the country 
the system is so arranged that this Procrustean device applies more especially to 
the advanced pupils. In how many of our cities is there promotion to the high 
school oftener than once per year? What becomes of the pupils who lack one per 
centum of making the standard required? Are they not sent over the work of the 
highest grade of the grammar schools again, and thus made to occupy a year in 
doing what they might do in one-fourth of that time? And do they not leave 
school at this crisis more than at any other time in the whole course? = * * * * * *    
For schools where the number in each grade fell below the requisite thirty where- 
with to form a new division, of course this plan of subdivision could not be carried 
out. But'so far as the first [highest] grade of the grammar school is concerned this 
would rarely happen and still less likely would it occur with classes below the 
highest grade. 
The principle is clearly this: Not a Procrustean bed of grades on which the school 
is to be stretched so as to reduce the number of grades of advancement to ten or any 
other special number, but a thorough classification of all the pupils into classes on 
a certain quota as a basis, whether this. be thirty or twenty-five, or whatever other 
number is considered the best. The endeavor will be to have the classes separated 
by as small an interval as possible; but four, six, or even ten weeks’ work is small 
enough for all practical purposes; and in order to make this arrangement uniform 
the pupils in upper grades, when too few to form classes with the required quota, 
should be brought together in central schools. If the highest grade in the high 
school consisted of sixty pupils or more, the division of it into two classes would be 
required. * 
This process of continual readjustment of classification in our schools will render 
the whole system elastic and mobile. Like the current of a river there will be every- 
where forward motion—in the middle the current is more rapid, at the sides the cur- 
rent flows more slowly. The work of the grade laid down for a year’s study will be 
accomplished in three or three and a half quarters by the brightest; by the dullest 
and slowest in five quarters. There will be no temptation to push on a slow pupil 
or drag him beyond his powers; no temptation to promote a pupil to a new grade’s 
work before thoroughly completing what is below him. * * * 
There may be some points on which doubts may rest. For example, it may be 
urged that this system would cause a collection of the dall and stupid pupils into 
classes by themselves, a deplorable result. But this is one of the evils which this 
system is adapted to correct. The fact that the best pupils from below are allowed
-P-A-G-E-338
  ~ 986 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
to rise through the masses above them as fast as their ability can carry them is 
surely not likely to prevent the slower pupils, who are their companions, from exert- 
ing all their energies and making considerable progress. The stream of bright pupils 
from below is inexhaustible. From the primary grades it ascends, continually pass- 
ing fixed points or points that move on moreslowly. In every class there will be its 
quota of bright pupils, some leading the class, and some just sustaining themselves 
in it, having recently joined it. But in the old system all the bright pupils had 
attained the top of the class and the dull ones had fallen hopelessly to the bottom 
long before the needed reclassification took place. 
Another may urge that this system causes so rapid a change from teacher to 
teacher that the very important personal influence of the teacher is materially im- 
paired. But under this system in the higher grades the pupil would hardly change 
teachers oftener than once or twice per year, and a change as often as this is desir- 
able for the healthy individual culture of the child. The school should not be a 
family influence exclusively. It is the transition to civil society; consequently the 
pupil must change teachers often enough to correct any one-sided tendencies of 
social culture that he may be liable to acquire fiom the individual teacher. For it 
must be remembered that reclassification of a whole school of 700 pupils, distributed 
through 12 rooms, does not imply a change of teachers on the part of more than 
one-sixth of the pupils, even when one-third of the best pupils in each class are 
promoted to the next higher. Each teacher having two classes (or, in the lower 
grades, three classes) will have one-third of the pupils from her advanced class 
promoted to the lower class in the next room above; she will likewise receive from 
the next room below one-third of the pupils from the advanced class there. In her 
own room, one-third of the pupils will be promoted from her second to her first 
class, but will still remain under the same teacher. In fact, she will have promoted 
to the next room one-sixth of her pupils, and have received one-sixth from the next 
lower room—that is to say, one-third is promoted from each class; but, practically, 
this is the maximum, and in ordinary cases a less proportion of the class will be 
transferred. If reclassification is instituted four times per year, and on each oc- 
easion one-sixth of the pupils are promoted to the next room, it will follow that 
each pupil will be taught one year and a half by the same teacher. But, as fre- 
quent transfer is necessary in some schools, to make up for the depletion of pupils 
in the higher grades, it will happen that this period will be reduced one-half or 
two-thirds. * * * 
The psychological effect of successful competition has been alluded to before. 
The moderate scholars of a higher class may find themselves at an advantage as 
compared with the best pupils newly promoted from the class below and are likely 
to take fresh courage. 
The question is likely to arise: Do these pupils who are promoted from one class 
to the next omit that portion of their studies gone over in the interval of time be- 
tween the two classes? It is expected that this will be taken up by areview of the 
ground embraced in the mentioned interval. 
THE ENTIRE FIELD SHOULD BE WORKED AT THE SAME TIME, SO THAT PUPILS MAY 
t BE EASILY PLACED IN ANY PART OF IT. 
J. L. Pickard, formerly superintendent of public schools, Chicago, 1U., in “‘ School Super 
vision” [New York: D. Appleton § Co.].—One method of administration places the 
several grades, as it were, in a series of rooms adjoining but separated by a wall in 
which is aclosed door. Once a year the door is opened for the passage of those who 
are provided with cards bearing the requisite percentage mark, and then closed for 
another year. To obtain these cards is the sole aim of the children, who think only- 
of release from one cell and of admission to another, which they hope may prove 
more attractive, but of whose attractions they have no knowledge. They are not 
lured upward and onward. They are goaded by the dread of continuance for another 
year in the room which has lost all its attractions for them. Wise supervision has 
succeeded in opening the doors more frequently; wiser supervision has rested less 
upon cards of admission bearing percentage marks and more upon cards of merit 
obtained from watchiul and loving teachers; wisest supervision has removed the 
doors entirely, so that constantly a stream of influence flows downward, arousing a 
healthful ambition, inspiring self-activity, and furnishing a worthy metive for 
advance; and in response to this influence there is a steady movement of pupils 
upward. 2 * * * * * * * 
Motion is universally acceptable to the human race. Motion forward is specially 
pleasurable, even though landmarks must be studied to make it observable. - To the 
race all days are alike, but to the individual there are days marked by a red line. 
In the child’s calendar the promotion days are red-lined days. Promotions, techni- 
cally so called, should not be discarded. Preparation for them is exhilarating, suc-

cess is refreshing, and even failure is not without its healthful fluence. Their 
value, however, is impaired when they are made the end of all effort. Nor should 
promotions occur at certain set times predetermined. Especially harmful will prove 
the policy of making promotions synchronous with the end of a schoolyear. Under 
such a system indolence prevails at the beginning of the year and cramming at the 
end. Just when, as the result of faithful work, teachers and children need lessened 
rather than increased burdens, the system of annual examinations and promotions 
at the end of the year will wear out both teachers and children in mind and body. 
In every large system of schools the rank of classes should be such that the whole 
field of study is under cultivation at all times. There should be no gaps of a year’s 
length at any stage of a child’s progress—least of all in the earlier stages—over 
which none can leap, and which prove discouraging to the pupil lacking in physical 
strength or in mental grasp. The opportunity for advancement by a series of short 
steps encourages to rapid promotion and the feeling that a little lost time does not 
put a pupil back out of sight of his former classmates gives him a hope of regainin. 
his lost place. The superintendent’s ideal should be a stream flowing steadily, wit! 
its particles mobile, ready to glide forward or to slip backward a little if force of 
circumstances so decree. 
SOME, FEATURES OF THE OLD UNGRADED SCHOOLS WOULD IMPROVE THE MODERN 
GRADED SCHOOL, 
Mr. John Kneeland, in the Report of the Board of Supervisors of Boston, Mass., for 
1891-92.—Graded schools have been and are still open to the objection that they do 
not allow all the pupils to work, each up to his full ability. The brighter pupils 
must at intervals mark time, that the slower-minded may have an opportunity to 
eatch up with them. Marking time does very well in gymnastics, but hasa deaden- 
ing effect in its application to mental efforts; and, by and by, reduces the pupil to 
such a condition that marking time is no longer required. Only that effort is made 
which is necessary to keep up with the class; and the habit of doing one’s best 
under the exhilaration of quickening influences and of engaging studies gives place 
to the habit of mediocre exertion. Who, for instance, familiar with the schools, 
has not been often saddened to find pupils who were bright and eager workers in the 
primary school sunk to the level of careless plodders in some lower class of a gram- 
mar school? Who has not found in the lowest classes of the primary school bright 
children from the kindergartens subjected to the same processes of instruction and 
kept down with the newcomers who had had no previous training? These, it may 
be claimed, are exceptional cases. They are, however, not infrequent; and they 
indicate clearly the wrong done by the neglect of the true principle of classification, 
and a too rigid adherence to the letter of the course of study. 
What can be done, then, toward enabling every pupil in the class of a graded 
school to work up to his fail ability, and pass from one grade of work to another as 
soon as he is prepared for such advance? One look at the old-fashioned district 
school may give usa hint. Notwithstanding the manifest advantages of the graded 
school, the ungraded had some advantages it is best to keep in sight. In the latter 
the pupils were carefully classed in the various studies according to their ability 
and advancement, but the way was left open for the easy and prompt passage from 
one class to another. It was common to see pupils advance from one class to 
another during a single term, and, elated by their success, push on eagerly for the 
next advance. There was no attempt to bring a certain number of pupils to a fixed 
level of attainment in all studies before there could be an advancement of pupils in 
any study. Can there not be something of this free way of working in what we call 
the graded class? 
The pupils of a large graded class are seldom, if ever, of the same absolute grade; 
but they are near enough of a grade to enable a teacher to make very much of her 
instruction general, and herein is an advantage. If, however, she treats them as all 
of a grade, and endeavors to make them all move on together at an average pace, 
she does not give the alert minds of her class full opportunity. A wiser way would 
be to allow the class by a natural process to become divided into sections, and one 
section, if need be, to advance faster than the other. The course of study lays out 
the work for the different classes, but it does not require that only such and such 
work shall be done in any particular schoolroom and that all that work shall be 
done by all the pupils in the same time. It means that what it outlines for any 
class shall be done as a stage in the pupil’s progress, and when it is accomplished, 
though the pupil remain in the same room with the same teacher, he is entitled to 
pass on to the next stage. Itis a wrong to him to hold him back. A sixth-class 
teacher, for instance, should not think, her sixth-class work having been accom- 
plished before the time for regular promotion, that it is forbidden her to enter upon 
the fifth-class work, but should rather feel that the necessity is upon her to allow 
  no slackening of interest on the part of her pupils, but rather to give them the 
pleasurable excitement of a move onward.
-P-A-G-E-340
  988 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
It sometimes happens that pupils ready for promotion are held back because there 
are not accommodations for them in the room occupied by the next class. The pro- 
motions are made upon the principle that as only so many pupils can be accommo- 
dated in the room above, the line of promotion must be drawn at that limit. There 
can be no question that this is entirely right as far as passing from reom to room is 
concerned, but all wrong as deciding the passing from class to class. There is 
always room in the class above. Let the pupils have free way to press forward and 
occupy it. 
There may be schools where something would be gained by allowing teachers to 
hold their classes through the work of two or three grades. A thoroughly good 
primary teacher, for instance, taking fifty pupils through the three divisions of the 
primary grade, would give them a better fitting for the grammar school than would 
three different teachers, though equally good, taking them in succession. Much 
time is lost in gaining the acquaintance of the pupils and learning their individual 
characteristics. Besides, each teacher keeps within her vision only the narrow 
limits of her special work. The single teacher, thoroughly understanding the abil- 
ities and dispositions of her pupils from the beginning, can go along with them step 
by step, relating her instruction and direction to the farther-off results she is to 
reach, seizing opportunities to connect the present fact or experience with things to 
be accomplished later. The same thing can be said in regard to arrangements for 
more continuous teaching in the grammar schools. Were teachers all alike capable, 
there could be no question of the advantage of such arrangements. Are they not of 
sufficient capability in most schools to carry out to some extent sucha plan of work 
with some gain for the pupils? z 
Whatever the position assigned the teacher in respect to class work, however, it 
does become her duty, when she receives a class, no matter how it is labeled and 
what work it is supposed to undertake, to reach as soon as she can a knowledge of 
its real condition as a whele and in respect to its individual members. Whatever 
is lacking in previous training necessary to the advance she is called upon to make 
must first be supplied. The majority of pupils may be all ready to go on, but the 
others may need special help in certain directions. The problem is how to render 
that special help if no provision is made for it in the general arrangements of the 
school. As under no circumstances should a part of the class be held back to go 
over familiar ground to accommodate the rest of the class, as is too often done under 
the name of reviewing, the division of the class seems a necessity if all are to be 
justly dealt with. Teachers who are called upon to teach two classes, or one class 
in two sections, generally dislike the arrangement. At first thought it seems to 
add to their labors, and make a just distribution of their time and efforts more diffi- 
cult. But what if it does? Are they not willing to take an additional burden, if 
they can thereby benefit their pupils? They will probably find, however, after 
becoming habituated to such an arrangement and having learned how to make the 
right adjustments, that they can get better results and carry on their work with 
more ease, because with more satisfaction to themselves. 
The simultaneous instruction of all the pupils of a class in all their studies has 
one disadvantage not often enough considered. It either compels the using of the 
school time almost entirely in recitation or some other general exercise, or it de- 
vives the teacher of the opportunity of fulfilling to the extent she might her 
function of teaching. Suppose one hour of the day is set apart for arithmetic. The 
teacher may require one-half of the hour to be given to study, while she sits at her 
desk and gives such individual help as is requested, and give the other half hour to 
recitation. The same may be done in regard to other studies. ‘The half hour is 
occupied with a class of fifty. In some exercises all the pupils cannot be reached in 
that time. Now, suppose a division of the class: one-half recites while the other 
halfstudies. Does not this give the teacher an opportunity to come into closer con- 
tact with the individual minds, and get from each pupil the steadiest and most 
effective work? This is only by way of illustration. In actual practice the study- 
ing time of the one-class system is greatly abridged; much the larger part of the 
time is taken for recitations and general exercises. 
Another consideration may here be presented. Suppose a teacher doing sixth- 
class work with one pupil to instruct, giving such time to each study as is now 
required, what part of the year would she require to take him over the whole 
ground? How far beyond the requirement in all his studiescould she take him in 
the course ofa single year? What number of pupils can she take and work together, 
and yet do for each pupil all that she can do for asingle pupil? There must, of 
course, be a limit to this number. Now, whatever the number of pupils to be 
taught, the true economy of time and effort is to manage that number in such a way 
as to give each pupil as nearly as possible all the advantages he would have if taught 
by himself. To hold the concentrated and continuous attention of fifty pupils 
through a recitation as the attention of one can be held is certainly impossible for 
most teachers. But a limited number of pupils can be worked together as one, with
-P-A-G-E-341
  CLASS INTERVALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 989 
the advantage, too, of a quickening influence upon each other. The burden laid 
upon the teacher is to'awaken an interest in all her pupils, to keep them in the right 
temper of mind for required work, to have ready for them the right kind of employ- 
ment, and to hold their concentrated attention during instruction and recitation. 
That she can do all this to the fullest helpfulness of all the pupils by dividing them 
into groups or sections, according to their abilities and acquirements, seems certain, 
as far as considerable of the required work is concerned. Much of the instruction 
must, of course, be general. It is as easy to tell fifty pupils some fact as it is to tell 
it to one pupil. But it is not so easy to make fifty pupils, varying as they must in 
mental characteristics, move along together in reading or arithmetic, even at aslack- 
ened pace, as it is to hold together half that number of pupils, nearly alike in mental 
alertness and acquirement, in a quicker movement. To divide a class into two sec- 
tions for purposes of teaching may seem to be doubling the teacher's labor, but, in 
reality, it lessens it. Pupils working within and up to the limit of their abilities 
work with more ease, and require less urging and direction by the teacher than when 
forced beyond their power to grasp and hold. Call to mind the misdirected energy 
putforth by a teacher laboring with what to her seems stupidity, the amount of breath 
she sometimes expends in heightened and rasping tone, the wear and tear upon her 
amiabiilty in wrestling with the wandering attentiou of her class, and there will beno 
difficulty in conceiving that the simultaneous teaching of a large class is not always 
a labor saving protess. 5 
THE LIMITATIONS TO BE OVERCOME, 
Supt. Frank A. Fitzpatrick, Omaha, Nebr., in Northwestern Journal of Education.— 
The graded school represents a solution, or a partial solution, of the difficulties en- 
countered in the ungraded or partially graded schools. 
A perfect system of classification would be such a scheme as would take care of all 
the irregularities incident to school life. For instance, such a subdivision of classes 
that a pupil who was absent one day or two days could, upon his return, drop into 
a class that was studying precisely the same lessons that the pupil would have recited 
had he not been absent. 
But the best system of classification is not attainable, for the reason that in our 
urban existence we have limitations that are speedily encountered and can not be 
overcome. 
One limitation is that we have not a sufficiently large school attendance that we 
may have enough pupils to form classes under such an arrangement. And were this 
limitation removed, we have not a sufficiently dense population that could be placed 
within a convenient distance of the schoo] buildings. 
Hence the problem of classification becomes a search after the best possible, tak- 
ing into consideration our limitations and environment. And that system is best 
for any particular locality which gives the utmost possible plasticity without reduc- 
ing the number of pupils in each class to such a number as will entail too great a 
burden upon the community greater than efficiency requires. 
* * * * * * * 
A grade in school nomenclature means the work of one school year. Schoolmen 
have not as yet agreed on the length of time that is required for the average child 
in the average community to complete the work included in the common-school 
course of study. In the West, however, we are agreed that eight years is a sufficient 
period of time, and quite a number of able men belicve that seven years is sufii- 
cient. 
* * * * * * 
The next phase of the question is the arrangement of the pupils in each grade 
into classes according to the attainments, capacities, ete., of the individual pupils 
in each grade. 
Here is where our limitations press upon us. If we make but one class or division 
in each room, the teacher will not be economically employed; if we make too many 
classes in each grade, the number of pupils in each class will become so small that 
the teacher handling two classes, which is probably the maximum, will not be eco- 
nomically employed, and the result will be too many teachers for the wealth of the 
town to take care of, and a consequent reduction in salary of efficient teachers and 
an ultimate financial breakdown. ‘ 
Here lies the weakness of the graded system, because we are compelled by our 
limitations to place children of varying’ attainments, will power, capabilities, and 
opportunities into the same class. 
‘The defect is inherent; all that is possible is to reduce the difficulty to its lowest 
terms. The number of pupils in any individual school system is the constant factor 
in the treatment of this question of classification; the character, size, and location 
of school buildings variable elements. 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  990 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
In other words, in a school system having a daily attendance of 400 or less, it will 
not be advisable to have any subdivision of classes in each grade, except for purposes 
of convenience, and when each class in the grade will represent the same degree of 
advancement. 
In systems having from 400 to 1,200 pupils in daily attendance, it will be found 
advisable to have two divisions or classes in each grade, the interval between each 
class being one-half the school year. 
In systems having from 1,200 to 2,000 pupils in daily attendance, it will be found 
advisable to have three divisions or classes in each grade, the interval between each 
class being one-third of the school year. 
In systems having 2,100 pupils and upwards in attendance, four subdivisions or 
classes in each eure or year will be found advantageous. 
The shorter the interval between classes, the better the school will perform its 
function of adapting itself to the needs of the community. 
The more easy it is to classify pupils of varying attainments and capacities, the 
more easy it is to make special promotions where pupils are able to do more work. 
The more plastic a system of schools becomes in the direction of allowing properly 
regulated special promotions, the better the system. 
‘The limitation here upon the creation of classes with short intervals between 
them is that the number of pupils in each class must not fall below twenty, other- 
wise we shall trench over on the other side. ‘ 
In a properly managed school system the classes are perpetually undergoing dis- 
integration and reintegration. Crystallization into any one absolute form is death, 
just the same as it is in physical life. 
When a new class of pupils is organized, there may be a complete homogeneity, 
but after ten short weeks have passed. away the pupils in this class will appear in 
three different and divergent forms. A certain percentage may be classified as very 
good pupils, another definite quantity may be classified as average pupils, and still 
another portion as deficient pupils. Approximately 20 per cent will belong to the 
first clement, 50 per cent to the second element, and 30 per cent to the third element 
of the class. 
And should this class of pupils be again divided on these lines and formed into 
three separate and distinct classes, it will be only a few short months before each 
class will break up again into the same relatively strongly marked three elements, ~ 
very good, average, and poor pupils. 
This phenomenon may be styled the persistency of disintegration. Its parallel 
may be found in life, where the tissues are continually wasting away, and need to 
be rebuilt from time to time if the physical organism is to escape extinction. 
The remedy for this disintegration is reintegration—reclassification, the gathering 
up together of somewhat similar elements to form a new class, which itself again 
disintegrates only to be rebuilt again, and so ad infinitum. 
In life, were we to wait until the tissues in any particular organ were wasted 
away before beginning the work of rehabilitation, the organism would die. Just 
so in the work of classification; if we wait until the disintegration has been com- 
pleted, we shall not be able to reunite the dead, lifeless parts into a living, breath- 
ing whok. 
The breaking up of classes must be foreseen and the remedy foreshadowed all 
through the year, but more especially the last three months of the year. 
In the rebuilding of classes in a school system, the short interval between classes 
becomes a very potent factor. : 
But, even in systems where the classes are a school year apart, there are three or 
four places in every course of study where the rebuilding process can be carried on 
with great advantage to all concerned. 
‘There is nothing in the whole work of a supervisor that demands clearer insight 
and greater breadth of vision than the taking care of this disease which so remorse- 
lessly-attacks classification. 
The weak points in the system will be found in the fourth and grades above. 
Its symptoms are very strongly marked and can be readily detected. 
If you have any class having fewer than twenty pupils in it three months before 
the close of the school year, you may depend upon breaking that class up for the 
next year or else trouble will ensue. 
As the course of study is prepared on the basis of the average accomplishment of 
  _ tasks by the average pupil, the better element in the class will always very easily 
do more than the required work, and thus be able to do the additional work in the 
remaining months that is necessary to enter on a level into the next highest class. 
Here again certain principles must be kept in mind; the pupil to be advanced in 
his work faster than his comrades must have the requisite age or maturity; he must 
be strong in the main study of his grade or class. 
In the first three grades reading is the grading study, in the next three grades 
reading and arithmetic, and the last two grades, arithmetic and grammar,
-P-A-G-E-343

No pupil or pupils should be allowed to attempt advancement who are not in 
advance of their classmates in these vital studies. A boy who has the requisite 
maturity and reads well in the third reader and can perform reasonably accurately 
and rapidly the fundamental elementary operations of arithmetic can bo advanced ~ 
into a class using the fourth reader and beginning common fractions with the 
greatest ease, with advantage to himself and also to the class into which he is 
advanced." *°-* 
It may be inferred that in the best system of classification advancement or pro- 
motion may occur at any time; there are no settled, stated periods. S 
THE CHICAGO PLAN. 
E. LE. White, LL. D., in “ Promotions.and Examinationsin Graded Schools.”—Pupils are 
admitted to the primary schools in Chicago at all times in the year when there is 
room, and new classes are formed'whenever this is found necessary and feasible. 
Each principal classifies the pupils under his supervision to the best advantage as 
he sees it, and the classes are advanced in the course as rapidly as they can do the 
work to his satisfaction. No attempt is made to bring all the classes of a grade to 
the same point in the course in a prescribed time. The resulting interval between 
consecutive classes may be amonth and it may be five months. In other words, 
each great school in Chicago is a law to itself in classification, and the principal 
thereof is under no constraint to sacrifice the best interests of his pupils to secure 
uniformity of progress or mechanical perfection in grading. 
Inspection by the supervising force is the only means depended upon to secure 
needed uniformity of standard and methods. When pupils complete in a satisfac- 
tory manner the elementary course they are admitted to the high schools, the only 
evidence of fitness required being the recommendation of the grammar-school prin- 
cipal. 
Pupils are promoted to the high schools annually. 
It is obvious that this varying class interval gives the school system of Chicago 
great flexibility, and at the same time it permits the closest possible classification 
of pupils for purposes of instruction. How eompletely all this would be changed 
by the adoption of a uniform class interval, a uniform rate of progress, and uniform 
examinations to test results! It would not require more than two uniform grade 
examinations imposed by the superintendent ‘‘to determine fitness for promotion,” 
to bring the schools to a halt, and then to uniformity in “marking time.” 
ANOTHER EXPERIENCE WITH SHORT INTERVALS, 
Supt. F. Treudley, Youngstown, Ohio.—In common with some others I have felt the 
bondage of the graded school system and have believed that there was not encugh 
flexibility in it. There are such wide differences among pupils that it is impossible 
under our present processes of selection to find in any building groups of fifty who 
can work together profitably. It has been the effort of teachers, heretofore, largely 
to keep schools together, hurrying up the dull ones, retarding the quick ones, and 
failing to recognize adequately these marked differences, 
After thinking this matter over, talking with teachers, citizens, and the board of 
education, we concluded to break up our schools into groups according to strength, 
allowing classes to move on as rapidly as possible. Suppose we have a room, for ex- 
ample, of fifty pupils. In the progress of the year that school will naturally resolve 
itself into three groups, one able to do more than the work of the grade and one 
probably much less. Our instruction to the teachers was to permit these groups to 
move on accurding to strength; these who can do more than the year’s work to go 
into the work of the next grade whether transferred to that grade or not; those 
that could not do the work of the school are to go slower and to do what they can. 
We began this the first of September, and are now beginning to realize its fruits. 
By this plan all pupils are moving on according to strength. Wherever a child is, 
he ought to be, as arule. It permits of frequent and easy reclassification. Inhigher 
grades we do not have more than three groups, nor less than two; in low primaries 
we may have four. Ata late grade meeting of “A” primary teachers where this 
matter was thoroughly discussed there was a hearty spirit of codperation, and the 
expression was unanimous as to the ¥access with which it is working. 
TWO DIVISIONS, ADVANCING AT UNEQUAL RATES, SUPPLEMENTED BY AN UNGRADED 
ROOM. 
Supt. Francis Cogswell, Cambridge, Mass.—The pupils in the primary and grammar 
schools are classified in nine grades, the primary schools having three grades and the 
grammar schools six. In the English high school there are four grades, and in the 
Latin school five. Under this classification children entering the lowest grade of 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  992 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the primary schools, and advancing regularly from grado to grade, graduate from 
the grammar schools in nine years, from the En. lish high school in thirteen years, 
and from the Latin school in fourteen years. any pupils, however, advance more 
rapidly. Twenty-five per cent of those who graduate from the grammar schools do 
the work in five years and 5 per cent additional in four years. In the English high 
school a few pupils graduate in three years, and about 10 per cent of those in the 
Latin school in four years. 
The majority of the pupils who graduate from the grammar schools in less than 
six years are usually carried over the course arranged for two years in one year. 
* * * Other pupils who graduate in less than six years usually accomplish this by 
omitting for the time being the subjects included in one year’s work, relying upon 
the instruction given in review lessons for a knowledge of these subjects. In the 
primary schools it is not expected that many pupils will complete the work in less 
than the regular three years. 
In all the schools many pupils fail of promotion at the end of the year and are 
obliged to continue in the same grade two years in succession, doing the second year 
, - . precisely the same work they did the first year. Thirty per 
5 cent of the pupils who graduated from the primary schools 
Ses last June had been four years or more in completing the work, 
DA and 18 per cent of the graduates of the grammar schools had 
% & been seven years or more. 
The question now to be considered is whether or not the 
present plan of classification and promotion is the best that 
6 can be adopted. Under it, as has been stated, pupils in the 
6 grammar schools who wish to complete the course of study in 
4/5 Jess than the full time are obliged to do two years’ work in one 
or omit the subjects taught in one grade, taking them up only 
inreview. Wouldit not be better for such pupils if the course 
were so arranged that no part of it shall be omitted, and no 
4/5 one year’s subjects more hastily passed over than another? 
This can be done by dividing the course of study in two 
ways: (1) into six sections; (2) into four sections, each sec- 
tion to represent a year’s work. The accompanying diagram 
3\4 will make the plan more clear. Pupils promoted to the gram- 
3lg mar schools would begin the first year’s work together. After 
two or three months they would be divided into two divisions; 
one division would advance more rapidly than the other, and 
during the year would complete one-fourth of the whole 
course of study. The other division would complete one-sixth 
a of the course. For convenience we will call these divisions A 
3 and B. At the beginning of the second year division A would 
2\2 be placed with division B of the third year. At the end of the 
c year these divisions would be at the same point in the course 
of study, having completed (one-division in two years and the 
other in three years) one-half the course. These divisions 
2/2 would begin the next year’s work together; but division A 
would advance more rapidly than division B, and at the be- 
ginning of the fourth year it would be placed with division B 
of the sixth year. At the end of the year both divisions 
Z would have completed the course of study without omitting 
aly any part of it, and without being obliged to do in any one year 
more than in any other, one division having completed the 
work in four years and the other in six. 
Under this plan there are also two ways of completing the 
A B course in five years. Any pupil beginng in division A can, at 
theend of two years, if for any cause it seems desirable, be transferred to division B; 
then he would be three years finishing the course, making five years in all. On the 
other hand, any pupil beginning in division B can, at the end of three years, if he 
has shown himself able to advance more rapidly, be transferred to division A, and 
in this division finish the course in two years, making as before five years in all. 
In both these cases these changes can be made without omitting or repeating any 
part of the course of study. At other times than at the middle of the course pupils 
can also be transferred from a higher division to a lower, or from a lower to a higher, 
with fewer difficulties to overcome and with greater probability of being benefited 
thereby than under our present classification; the divisions in A being separated 
prot tose in B by only six months’ work, while the present grades are a year 
apart. 
One objection which will be made to this plan, especially by teachers. is that it 
will frequently be necessary to have two grades or divisions of unequal attainments
-P-A-G-E-345
  CLASS INTERYALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 993 
in the same room. It is by no means a settled question, however, whether tl one- 
class plan is for the best interests of the pupils. * * * In my own opinion, there 
are decided advantages in having two grades in a room where they are separated 
by an interval of not more than six months, making it practicable to teach writing, 
drawing, music, and other exercises of a general character to all the pupils at the 
same time. The pupils of the lower grade are benefited not only by observing 
what is going on in the higher grade, but by being assisted with those whom they 
look upon, in a measure, at least, as superior; and especially is this the case when 
it is understood that any pupil in the lower grade can by application find his way 
into the higher. Buta greater benefit isin having a part of the time devoted to 
study. The practice now so common with the majority of teachers in elementary 
schools of working with their pupils almost incessantly from the beginning of the 
session to its close is not favorable to the success of those pupils when they take up 
the high-school studies, and are obliged, under the changed circumstances of classi- 
fication and recitation, to prepare their lessons ‘‘ without the aid or stimulus of the 
ever present teacher.” Itis also unfavorable to the intellectual growth of the pu- 
pils who do not go beyond the grammar school. Without the habit of quiet study, 
little will be undertaken or accomplished in the line of mental improvement after 
school days are over. * * * 
The proposed plan seems to me feasible, and I believe it can be successfully car- 
ried ont, so that from 15 to 20 per cent of the pupils will be able to complete the 
course of study in four years, from 40 to 50 per cent in five years, and the remainder, 
with only a few exceptions, in six years. T'o do this, however, more individual in- 
struction will be required. How shall this be best secured? Not, I believe, by re- 
ducing the number of pupils in a room, but by the appointment of a teacher of spe- 
cial qualifications, who shall have charge of no particular class, but whose time 
shall be divided among the pupils needing this instruction in all the classes. At 
first thought it would seem that an additional teacher in each school would increase 
the cost of instruction; and this would be the case were it not that by this means 
many pupils would be carried forward more rapidly than would otherwise be possi- 
ble. After carefully considering this question I have no hesitation in expressing 
the opinion that such a course in the end would not add a dollar to the expense of 
the schools. 
NUMEROUS CLASSES WITI SILIORT INTERVALS AND WITHOUT STATED TIMES FOR 
PROMOTION, 
Supt. rank J. Barnard, Seattle, Wash.—In my opinion the only solution is to clas- 
sify pupils strictly according to abilities and qualifications, and then allow them to 
master the course of study in such time as they can do the work well. To illustrate, 
suppose there are in a certain school 80 pupils in the fourth-year grade. I would 
divide them into four divisions of 20 pupils each, classifying them strictly accord- 
ing to abilities. To one teacher I would give the first and second divisions, to an- 
other the third and fourth. To the teachers and pupils of all the divisions I would 
say : “Now, the theory upon which the course of study for the fourth year is constructed 
is that it will take one year to complete it, but if you can do the work thoroughly 
and easily in less time, why do so, and then at once begin the work of the fifth year, 
overtaking the lowest division of that class if possible.” 
This means daily promotion. Progress is constant. The first division of one 
class will overtake for atime, work with, but finally pass, the lowest division of the 
next higher class, while the lower divisions will go steadily forward, many of the 
pupils ‘‘ working up” to higher divisions of the same class. 
In schools where there are more than two teachers to a grade the classification can 
be still more thorough by having a greater number of divisions in each grade, 
SHORT INTERVALS, WITH ‘‘CROSS DIVISIONS.” 
Supt. A. W. Rankin, Superior, Wis.—For convenience, and in conformity to the pre- 
vailing custom, I assume eight grailes below the high school. I would advecate 
that these eight grades be divided into nineteen classes. That there be four classes 
or groups of not over 10 pupils each in the first grade; that the second grade con- 
tain three groups or classes with not over 12 in each group; that each grade 
above contain two classes of not over 20 each; that no two classes in a room be 
doing the same work; that each grade be assigned to one teacher; that there be 
further subdivisions or cross divisions where necessary. For instance, pupils in the 
fifth grade might be taught in one class in writing, in two classes in geography, in 
three classes in language or arithmetic. If a pupil is very bright in language, do 
not keep him with those who have not had his advantages; let him cross the hall 
from the fifth grade to the eighth and find his level; or if he is very backward in 
arithmetic, let him go down to his proper class, The nineteen classes and the cross

divisions will afford a ladder of easy ascent for ambitious pupils. In a live school 
from one-fourth to one-third of the pupils will merit individual promotion each year. 
‘THE BEST PUPILS OF ONE GRADE OFTEN BETTER THAN THE POOREST IN THE NEXT 
HIGHER. 
Supt. Edwin L. Kirtland, Holyoke, Mass.—I have frequently told our principals that 
a respectable per cent of the best scholars in any one of their grades would do better 
work than the poorest in the grade immediately preceding, and we are now debat- 
ing the matter of so changing our grading or so administering the present rules as 
to secure the advancement of those who can wisely take it. The proper classifica- 
tion of primary and grammar school students is not yet fully understood, but it is 
doubtful if any rule of classification or promotion. better than the judgment of a wise 
principal or teacher is likely to be found. Let the intervals of classification or of 
possible promotion be as short as practicable, then apply the judgment of the teacher 
to the individual case. 
SUBSTANTIALLY THE ST, LOUIS PLAN, 
Supt. C. F. Foster, Chester, Pa.—In the line of work a certain portion is laid out for 
each year, but in each grade below the seventh there are two and sometimes three 
classes at different stages of the work. There are no regular examinations, but at 
any time transfers are made up or down in the classes, according to the judgment of 
the teacher and by perntission of the superintendent. Above the seventh grade 
these transfers may also occur, but, the jump being a longer one, the cases are rarer. 
In the first and second years changes are quite common, some passing along very 
rapidly and others being detained by their inability to proceed. If a whole class is 
able to do more than the year’s work, it goes on to the work of the next grade; if it 
is dull, it moves more slowly. This sometimes changes the grade of a room, but no 
serious complications have resulted therefrom. 
RETARDING THE BRIGHT PUPILS AND NAGGING THE BACKWARD RUINS BOTH. 
Supt. C. E. Meleney, Somerville, Mass.—With year-long intervals, many pupils are 
ruined for study because they have not the chance they ought to have to progress, 
and others leave school because they dislike it on account of being constantly 
scolded and humiliated and made to think they are dunces. If they had more time 
and more sympathy and lessurging and hurrying, they would becomestudents. The 
grades should be short steps of not more than five months and less if possible, so 
that individuals may go from one to the next higher without any break in the work. 
LET EACH PUPIL LEAVE HIS WORK AS SOON AS HE MASTERS IT. 
Supt. E. N. Coleman, Le Mars, Towa.—The ideal classification would make it possi- 
ble for a pupil to bridge any mterval in the course if his ability placed him beyond 
his present class; and he should be encouraged to this end until he reaches a class 
of equals that will put him to his best that will maintain his place. In this, how- 
ever, careful thought must be had for the delicate, and equal care is necessary to 
prevent ambition for place to become stronger than the ambition to honestly merit 
that place. * * * Separate the pupils into classes so that eachmindhasa chance 
to master before it leaves a piece of work, and, also, to leave it as soon as it is mas- 
tered. * * * Under year-long intervals the progress of the class is less than the 
natural pace of the slowest would be under conditions calculated to stimulate them 
to their best efforts. It is progress at the pace of the slowest, withinterest and am- 
bition at lowest ebb. 
SHORT AND IRREGULAR INTERVALS IN KANSAS CITY. 
Supt. J. M. Greenwood, Kansas City, Mo.—Our classes are not over twelve weeks 
apart, and in most case the interval is not oversix weeks. Thereis an exception dur- 
ing the last year. The pupils are admitted to the high school twice a year, and in that case only does a pupil go back eighteen weeks if he fails to pass. The objectis 
to give the greatest elasticity in grading, and to move pupils along in their studies 
as rapidly as possible. 
BRIGHT PUPILS FAVORED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DULLER ONES. 
Supt. R. B. D. Simonson, Hannibal Mo.—Under year-long intervals the progress of the whole school would be kept down to the pace of the slowest and weakest pupils

were it not for the disposition of most teachers to givemost attention to the brightest 
pupils and thusneglect the duller ones, who either drop out or graduate speciala 
gratia, 
TEACHERS ACQUAINTED WITH BOTH SYSTEMS PREFER SHORT INTERVALS. 
Supt. F. 8. Porter, Seneca Falls, N. Y.—I have yet to find an energetic teacher 
acquainted with both the long and the short interval systems who does not prefer 
short intervals, even when it necessitates two grades ina room. It may take more 
of the teacher’s time, but the work is done with less friction and with better results. 
QUARTERLY CLASSIFICATION FAVORED. a 
Supt. H. 8. Tarbell, Providence, R. I—I would grade the pupils into quarters below 
the high school, and into half years in the high school if circumstances would permit. 
YEARLY INTERVALS TO BE ABANDONED. 
Supt. A. 8. Draper, Cleveland, Ohio.—We have one-year intervals between all the 
grades, both in the elementary and high schools. * * * It is the purpose, how- 
ever, to shorten the interval between promotions at an early day. * * * Pupils 
should be graded as closely as the circumstances will allow. 
LONG INTERVALS TEND TO REPEATED FAILURES, 
Supt. J. F. Millspaugh, Salt Lake City, Utah.—Yearly intervals tend to carry bright 
pupils into the sluggish class, and by holding dull pupils so long to familiar work 
in case of failure tend to make repetition of failure. 
REPETITION OF A YEAR NOT AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY. 
Supt. Charles E. Gorton, Yonkers, N. Y.—With the year-long intervals the slow 
pupils are pushed over too much ground, and then are held back to repeat the same 
process a second year. 
YEARLY INTERVALS LEAD THE PUPILS INTO TEMPTATION, 
Supt. I. E, Young, New Rochelle, N. Y.—The system of yearly intervals does waste 
the opportunities of the bright minds, and it does more. It virtually offers a pre- 
mium for bright pupils to plan and practice many things in the class room which 
not only demoralize the bright pupil himself, but encourage disorderly conduct in 
the slower pupils. 
B.—Tue Snort BuT REGULAR INTERVAL, 
THE SUBDIVISION OF GRADES SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE TEACHER. . 
Supervising Principal B. C. Gregory, Trenton, N. J.—I think there should be a for- 
mal half-yearly gradation and that this should be supplemented by a clear under- 
standing that the teacher is to subdivide to as great an extent as the exigencies of 
the class and her ability to deal with distinct subdivisions will admit. * * * If 
the interval is shorter than a half-year, unless the school is large, there results a 
perplexing subdivision of classes. I believe in the subdivision, but think it should 
be made by the teacher in view of the ascertained facts in the case of each pupil, 
and not in accordance with rules. Some teachers can handle several subdivisions, 
others fail at just this point. The differentiation required by law should be lim- 
ited; the teacher should do the rest, and will, if she has been trained to do so. 
Supt. Robert Gwynne, Jr., Salem, N. J.—With grading that so divides the work 
into portions that the advance is easy and sure and the development thorough, the 
nearer together the grades are brought the easier a pupil will pass through the 
course; failing once, he loses comparatively little time by reason of haying to pass 
through that grade again. With the average corps of teachers it seems to be neces- 
sary to mark the limits of the grades sharply. 
REGULAR INTERVALS THE MORE PRACTICABLE, 
Supt. R. N. Wright, Astoria, Oregon.—It seems hardly practicable yet to use any 
other than the regular promotion method, which is, in our schools, twice each year.
-P-A-G-E-348
    996 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
OPPOSED TO BOTH LONG INTERVALS AND FREQUENT CHANGES. 
Supt. William F. Fox, Richmond, Va.—The year’s interval I think too long. I am 
equally opposed to so frequent a change as to greatly unsettle things. I have found 
the semiannual advancement the most satisfactory. 
DAN 
  ER IN EXTREME MINUTENESS AS WELL AS EXTREME LOOSENESS. 
Supt. W. 8. Perry, Ann Arbor, Mich.—The more minute the classification the better 
can the instruction be adapted to individual needs. However, quite a variety of 
needs and ability is helpful. Often a slow pupil will be greatly benefited by the 
quality and high standard of work of a bright class so as to finally reach a higher 
level. Possibly there may be a danger of too close grading, even for the best instruc- 
tion, but a too loose grading is a much more common and serious danger. 
SEMIANNUAL INTERVALS COMBINED WITH THE DEPARTMENTAL PLAN. 
Supt. B. B. Snow, Auburn, N. Y.—In my report for the last school year, now in 
press, I suggest to the board the plan of semiannual promotions for all classes below 
the high school, and the trial of the departmental system of teaching, to offset in a 
measure the loss of the effect of the teacher’s individuality resulting from a frequent 
change of teachers. 
THE TERM INTERVAL WITH FREQUENT CHANGE OF TEACHERS, 
Supt. Anson D. Miner, North Adams, Mass.—In primary and grammar grades our 
course has been marked out and prescribed by terms (three terms to the year) mak- 
ing twenty-seven classes in our nine years’ course below the high school. The only 
serious objection to this plan is that it allows the pupils to remain but a short time . 
under any one teacher. 
THE SEMIANNUAL INTERVAL WITH TWO CLASSES TO A TEACHER. 
Supt. W. A. Mowry, Salem, Mass.—I think the best plan for classes in elementary 
instruction is to have two classes in one room, the one, the A class, six months ahead 
of the other, the B class. A grade would still mean a year’s work. 
HALF-YEARLY GRADES, INTERVALS, AND CHANGES OF TEACHERS. 
Supt. John Jasper, New York, N. Y.—There are fourteen grades, six primary and 
eight grammar. The time taken to complete the highest grammar grade is one yeur. 
The time required foreach of the other gradesisa half-year. The total time provided 
for the completion of the. course is seven and one-half years; the intervals between 
the classes are a half-year. 
SEMIANNUAL AND ANNUAL INTERVALS. 
Supt. E. N. Brown, Hastings, Nebr.—With us the interval in all grades below the 
high school is one-half a year, and in the high schoolitisone year. We promote into 
the high school twice a year, the first year of the course being so adjusted that pupils 
can enter at either part of the year. 
Supt. Gilman C. Fisher, Pawtucket, R. I.—Half-year intervals in the lower grades 
with thirty pupils to a room is no doubt very near an ideal. One-year intervals are 
to be preferred in the high school. 
HALF-YEAR INTERVALS WITH QUARTERLY PROMOTIONS. 
Supt. R. C. Kerr, Wallawalla, Wash.—We divide our year’s work into terms of 
twenty weeks each, with light trial examinations every ten weeks. At the end of 
ten weeks we often find bright or elderly pupils ready for the upper division, and 
they often complete the year’s work in twenty weeks, or half a year, while dull 
pupils stay a year or more in one grade. We have twenty-four studies in our high- 
school course; some pupils take four each term, or eight each year, and graduate in 
three years; others take three each term and graduate in four years. 
HALF-YEARLY GRADES WITH FURTHER DIVISION BY ABILITY. 
Supt. W. T. Carrington, Mexico, Mo.—Our pupils are in rooms graded a half year 
apart. In much of their work these may be considered one grade; in other work  
-P-A-G-E-349
  CLASS INTERVALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SON. 
they are in sections graded on their aptitude and ability along that line. We try 
to work down the individual as nearly as possible. In the primary schools there 
are eight grades, twenty weeks apart; and in the grammar schools there are four 
grades, covering thirty weeks each, the entire elementary course extending over 
seven years. The complete high-school course covers thirty-six points. Very bright 
pupils make it in three years; slow pupils take five years. Some make it in three 
and one-half, some in four, and others in four and one-half years. 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE PUPILS FINISH A GRADE IN MORE OR LESS TITAN A YEAR. 
Supt. W. L. Steele, Galesburg, Ill.—Pupils are admitted three times a year, and this 
interval between the classes is preserved to the seventh grade. For three years I 
have kept a record of the time each child spends in a grade, and the result is about 
this: Two children out of threespend more or less than a year in a grade, or, in other 
words, about 66 per cent are exceptions to the rule of a year in a grade, 
C.—THEr Yrar-LONG INTERVALS. 
CLOSE GRADING IMPRACTICABLE IN A LARGE CITY. 
Supt. Edwin P. Seaver, Boston, Mass.—Pupils should not be graded or classified more 
minutely than is implied in annual promotions. Grading by half years is too fine 
work for the administrative machinery applied to the usual material. A single 
school might grade as minutely as that, but not a whole city system of schools. 
* * * Jfaschool principal can not manage to promote bright pupils rapidly and 
dull ones slowly, under rules based on the theory of year-long intervals, by the use 
of a reasonable amount of common sense, he should be replaced by one who can. 
The whole business of promotion from grade to grade in this city is left in the hands 
of the school principals, who act, nevertheless, under the vigilant inspection of the 
supervising officials. ‘The degree of common sense shown in applying the rules of 
promotion varies in different schools, of course, but the supervisors make the neces- 
sary corrections. 
STRAIGHT YEAR INTERVALS WITH INDIVIDUAL PROMOTIONS. 
Supt. Henry A. Wise, Baltimore, Md.—Pupils are in most cases promoted at the end 
of the school year, yet promotions may be made at any time. _ Principals are required 
to place pupils in the grade in which they may be instructed to the best advantage. 
The class intervals are one year throughout the entire course. I can not see how 
the ‘‘interval between the classes” has anything to do with ‘“ securing classes of the - 
normal standard in size.” When teachers are furnished in the ratio of 1 to 50 pupils, 
if one teacher has a class of ‘normal size,” say 20, some of the other teachers’ classes 
must of consequence be of abnormal size, say 60 or more. Ina class of 50 pupils the 
instruction of a good teacher is directed to the capacity of each scholar. 
If, under the system of year-long intervals, the less mature and sluggish minds of 
the class are discouraged while the opportunities of the bright minds are wasted, it 
is not the fault of the system, but of the teacher. Bright pupils in a class with dull 
ones help the whole class without any injury to themselves. They help the teacher 
to do the greatest good to the greatest number. 
With yearly promotions for the schools generally, and with promotions at any 
time of pupils who are qualified, it seems to me the graded system affords each pupil 
as much opportunity as could be secured by a graded system under any other ar- 
rangement. 
A great advantage of yearly intervals between the grades is that the teachers know 
their pupils better and are better qualified on that account to teach each one in 
accordance with his aptitudes, advancement, and disposition. They know the 
parents also, and are able to secure their coédperation. If half-year intervals are 
better than yearly for the reasons suggested in your questions, why are not quarterly 
intervals better than either, and daily intervals best of all? 
The problem of improving the schools can be solved in no other way than by pro- 
viding well-prepared teachers, both as {o academic and professional training. 
INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION THE ONLY PROPER KUND, 
Supt. A. P. Marble, Worcester, Mass.—Classification is liable to be a nuisance. 
However close it may be at the start it will not long remain so if pupils develop indi- 
vidually as they ought. Classification is only a means to an end; but it too fre- 
quently degenerates into an end, and as such it retards the growth of the individual 
pupils. It is intended to furnish facility for individual teaching—the only good 
teaching—butit often tends unnecessarily to wholesale work. * * * All teaching

should be individual. The dull can take a narrow range, the bright can cover a 
broader field, with many related subjects. * * * The work of a school is to edu- 
cate individuals, not to stuff a class. Itis in dealing with the ‘‘class” that teachers ~ 
make a nuisance of this whole system of grading. Let the teacher consider that 
here are 30 or 40 children to be edneated, developed, strengthened, built up, inter- 
ested. Let her forget that there is such a thing as “a class.” 
BRIGHT PUPILS SHOULD NOT ADVANCE TOO RAPIDLY. 
Mr. Richard L. Carne, late city superintendent, Alexandria, Va.—It is not ‘the nat- 
ural effect of classifying with intervals of a year or more between classes that the 
bright pupils are held back and not given work enough to develop their capacity ;” 
for if a boy or girlnotably excels the class, extra studies can and ought to beassigned, 
so as to enable him or her to catch up with the class above. My experience is, how- 
eyer, that very few pupils do this, and that it is more expedient, in ordinary cases 
of excellence, to encourage the pupils to review and thus become more thorough. 
Sometimes such pupils zee so well grounded by this means that they can go ahead 
without help and are able to skip a class when school is reopened for the next year. 
Decidedly, the teacher ought ‘to expend the greater part of his time on the slow 
and less competent pupils;” it is just where his help is needed and will tell. 
This system does not “ discourage the less mature and the sluggish minds of the 
class, while it wastes the opportunities of the bright minds;” on the contrary it 
encourages the former by helping them, and gives greater opportunity to, the latter 
by enabling them to learn thoroughly, and not become superficial by too much hurry. 
Remember that as arule, children who learn quickly, forget quickly. 
Under the system of year-long intervals between classes, the progress of the whole 
school is not ‘‘ kept down to the pace of the slowest and weakest pupils;” on the 
contrary, we ‘make haste slowly.” 
THE COURSE OF STUDY CONTAINS WORK ENOUGH FOR ALL, 
Supt. W. H. Morgan, Cincinnati, Ohio.—The intervals are one year throughout the 
course. We endeavor to have the pupils as near the same average attainments as 
possible, for the reason that the number of pupils per teacher is so large as to pre- 
clude much individual instruction or specialattention, * * * The pupils advance 
with sufficient rapidity, asa general thing. * * * A proper course of study will 
afford all the work that a pupil in the public schoolsshould attempt. * * * Ido 
not think that the progress.of the school is kept down to the pace of the slowest. 
The majority advance, while probably about 10 per cent are unable to do the work 
in a manner to justify promotion. 
INDIVIDUAL PROMOTIONS REMOVE NEARLY ALL THE EVILS OF CLASSIFICATION. 
Supt. Edward Brooks, Philadelphia, Pa.—In the elementary schools, it is desirable 
to classify on the basis of one year with the privilege of advancing bright pupils 
whenever they seem qualified forsuch advancement. Preferably this advancement 
should be made about midyear without a formal examination. If this is done with 
good judgment the evils of classification can be almost entirely removed. Our first 
eight grades are graded by half years, which I hope to change in a year or two. 
HALF-YEARLY GRADES, PROMOTIONS, AND INTERVALS WITH CORRESPONDING CHANGES 
OF TEACHERS—A CHANGE CONTEMPLATED. 
Supt. William H, Maxwell, Brooklyn, N. Y.—We have fifteen grades in the elemen- 
tary schools—seven primary and eight grammar. We promote twice a year fromall 
grades, at the first of February and the first of July. Intervals of five months. In 
the high schools, we promote and graduate twice a year, as in the elementary schools, 
at intervals of five months. 
The objections to the semi-annual promotion are that the teacher has not sufficient 
time to become thoroughly acquainted with her pupils, and that the range of subject- 
matter over which she teaches is so small that she inevitably becomes narrowed in 
her educational views. I am trying to work out a plan by which the year-long in- 
terval may be used without its disadvantages. I think the last two years of the 
grammar-school course should be organized on the departmental system. 
ANNUAL INTERVALS SATISFACTORY TO TEACHERS, 
Supt. John Swett, San Francisco, Cal.—In our course the promotion of pupils from 
one grade to another is left to the judgment of the principal and the class teacher. 
Annual promotions seem to be satisfactory to the teachers.
-P-A-G-E-351
  CLASS INTERVALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 999 
DIVISION INTO CLASSES OF EQUAL ABILITY FOR CONVENIENCES OF INSTRUCTION 
ONLY. 
Supt. T. M. Balliet, Springfield, Mass.—In all grades we promote once a year by 
classes, though we make many individual promotions during the year. Hence most 
pupils remain a year in each grade. In some branches like drawing, writing, lan- 
guage, reading, singing, etc., all the pupils in a room of the same grade form one 
class. In studies like arithmetic, geography, reading in grades first and second 
(primary), the pupils of the same grade are divided into sections or classes. The 
classes, however, are of the same grade, and are not any ‘‘numberof weeks apart.” 
The annual interval does tend to discourage the less mature and sluggish minds 
and to waste the opportunities of the bright minds, but I think frequent individual 
promotions, the abolition of examinations for promotion, making the course of study 
flexible by grading the instruction pedagogically, are the remedies of the evil. Ido 
not believe in mechanical remedies in such matters. 
THE EVILS OF GRADING ARE GREATER WITIL SHORT INTERVALS, 
Supt. H. R: Roth, Marlboro, Mass.—It is our plan to have but one grade in one room 
with one teacher. New classes are formed only in September of each year when the 
schools are reopened. The reclassification of special individual cases of pupils 
among these established grades may, and does, take place at any time during the 
progress of the year. * * * My experience of sixteen years in city systems with 
different time intervals between grades is strongly in favor of the year interval be- 
tween grades, as affording the best conditions for the work of instruction, * * * 
According to my observation a teacher with fifty pupils can do more for the indi- 
vidual pupil when they are in the same grade (or class). It is not the “ year inter- 
val,” but the application of it that tends to hold back pupils or give undue time 
to slow ones. With the same administration, I believe the shorter the interval, 
when less than a year, the greater the evils so often reported. 
YEARLY INTERVALS PREFERRED TO THE SEMIANNUAL. 
Supt. John Burke, Newport, Ky.—We have tried intervals of a half year and inter- 
vals of a year in our classes. We much prefer the longer period, and are using it 
now. The intervals do not make much difference, as education is a continuous proc- 
ess, whether the intervals are long or short. 
If a pupil can go in advance of his class we find a place for him in some higher 
grade; if he is too slow, one year back does him no injury or injustice. 
Our year’s course is long enough and difficult enough for pupils of good average 
standing, and yet within the reach of all children of fair intelligence who will put 
forth the effort. On an average about 5 per cent of children in primary grades fail 
to pass, and nearly the same proportion skip one grade in the primary course of 
eight years. : 
Shorter intervals than one year shift classes too often. We tried it for eight 
years, and find now that we can use most of its advantages, and experience none of 
its inconveniences by keeping a close watch on the power of children and promoting 
when promotion is possible. 
FREQUENT PROMOTIONS LEAD TO SUPERFICIAL WORK. 
Supt. William N. Barringer, Newark, N. J.—I think annual promotions are best for 
the average pupil. Special cases should receive special attention. Too frequent 
promotions lead to superficial work, study for promotion, and not for the mastery of 
the subject. Pupils need time to mature, and should not as arule change grade 
and teacher every few weeks. 
THREE OBJECTIONS TO MINUTE CLASSIFICATION, 
Supt. M. A. Yarnell, Sidney, Ohio.—There are many objections to a very minute 
classification. First. According to Emerson’s dictum, the pupil learns more from 
his companions than from his teacher. If he is as good as the best in his class, he 
will learn only from the teacher; at least he will be without the tuition of the 
bright pupil, and will miss the spur of seeing some one beat him. Second. The slow 
section will be still slower and will never get very far ahead. Third. Frequent pro- 
motions would result in confusion that would break up any classification, or at least 
keep somebody always reclassifying. 
   
-P-A-G-E-352
  1000 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
NEW MACHINERY NECESSARY FOR MORE RAPID PROGRESS. 
Supt. L. 8. Shimmell, Huntingdon, Pa.—We do not rigidly enforce year-long intervals 
except in the high school, where branches must be finished before promotion can take 
place. As long as colleges are justified in making the brightest and dullest take the 
full course, we think high schools are. It isn’t possible to graduate a bright pupil 
in less time than the course calls for unless he skips some branches. We would 
have to put in some new machinery to turn them out any faster. 
YEARLY INTERVALS NEED NOT RETARD BRIGHT PUPILS IN A SMALL CITY. 
Supt. R. A. Ogg, Greencastle, Ind.—The yearly interval between grades is the rule 
throughout our entire system. Our schools are in four-room buildings, with two 
grades in aroom. <A bright pupil can take part of the work of the higher grade, 
and by some special help can enter the next room at the close of the year, when, 
though at first weaker than the class, he may overtake them, since he is presumed 
to have more than the average ability. Evidently not many grow discouraged, since 
17 per cent of our enrollment are in the high school, 54.5 per cent of those below the 
high school are in grades 1 to 4, and 45.5 per cent are in grades 5 to 8. 
TIME IS WASTED BY FREQUENT SIFTING. 
Supt. G. J. McAndrew, Platisburg, N. Y.—If properly managed, the advancement 
is greater where promotions are not too frequent, and the danger of “overcrowding” 
is much lessened. Time is not lost in ‘‘examinations” or whatever sifting process 
is employed to separate the good from the indifferent pupils. 
YeARLY INTERVALS LEAD TO GREATER SELF-RELIANCE, 
Supt. C. B. Miller, Nanticoke, Pa.—If the object be to lead the pupil to rely upon 
himself, I think there is an advantage in the year interval. 
  UNIFORMITY OF ATTAINMENT NOT NECESSARY FOR CLASS INSTRUCTION. 
Supt. B. M. Zettler, Macon, Ga.—It is possible, I think, to instruct with profit 
pupils in the same class who are one year apart, i. ¢., extremes of same class of forty 
pupils may be one year apart in half or two-thirds of their studies. The privilege 
of being examined for promotion at any time during the term should be allowed to 
the individual pupil on the recommendation of the teacher. 
THE FAILURES OF ONE YEAR MAY BE THE LEADERS OF THE NEXT. 
Supt. Willie D. House, Waco, Tex.—With yearly intervals the progress is measured 
by the pace of the ‘‘great average boy,” and the brightest lead as guiding stars, 
while the slowest and weakest are kept in file by momentum. If he fall outside he 
gains strength to lead next year where he dragged back this. 
PUPILS SHOULD REMAIN WITH THE SAME TEACHER TWO YEARS, 
Supt. W. N. Hailmann, Laporte, Ind.—It is desirable to keep children with one 
and the same teacher during at least two years, and let her make subdivisions, if 
need be, within her class. 
A LONG COURSE WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SKIPPING. 
Supt. E. J. Beardsley, Elmira, N. Y.—As the result of more than thirty years’ 
experience as principal of a large graded school, comprising all the primary and 
grammar grades, I have come to believe that the greatest discouragement to pupils 
comes from being put back or being obliged to go over the same grade a second time. 
I would, therefore, first determine the minimum amount of work to be accomplished 
in the entire course, then would make the time for completing it long enough for the 
very large majority of the pupils. I would then so arrange the course that those 
capable of doing the work in less time should have the opportunity of doing so. 
Supt. Charles H. Douglas, Keene, N. H.—We have ten grades, each covering 
one year, but pupils often complete the ten grades in seven, eight, or nine years, as 
for the upper fifth of the class we promote ‘doubly ” and make other promotions 
during the year in individual cases. Annual intervals with this provision of pro- 
moting the brighter pupils two grades instead of one gives good results with us.
-P-A-G-E-353
  CLASS INTERVALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 1001 
UNGRADED ROGH FOR BOTH BRIGHTEST AND DULLEST. 
Supt. G. A. Stuart, Lewiston, Me.—There should be in each building of six rooms 
one room fer special assistance, either to aid bright pupils to jump or to help slow 
ones along. x 
Supt. O, E. Smith, Des Moines (north side), Iowa.—Every building of as many as 
eight rooms should have an ungraded class or room in which to work up the strag- 
glers from a class or coach the bright pupils for advancement. 
“ALL-GRADE” ROOM FOR BACKWARD PUPILS ONLY. 
Supt. Isaac M. Wellington, Crawfordsville, Ind.—An ‘all-grade” room for the tougher 
and irregular class aids us inour work. Here only individual work is done. Of a 
thousand in average attendance for the year in the system of schools, a hundred may 
are dropped to the all-grade room, and seventy-five been returned by merit to the 
grades. ee 
EXPERIENCE OF HIGHER INSTITUTIONS FAVORABLE TO YEAR-LONG INTERVALS. . 
Supt. W. W. Cottingham, Easton, Pa.—A restraint on the progress of a school does 
not legitimately follow the adoption of year-long intervals between classes. This 
fact is fully verified by the experience of many of our best schools, and is supported 
by the policy pursued in the higher institutions of learning, where the percentage 
of slow and weak students in the respective classes is no less than that exhibited in 
the common schools. * * * 
In each of the departments composing a system of graded schools there should be 
but two classes organized, one to meet the wants of the bright and active pupils 
whose advancement is rapid, the other to subserve the interest of those of inferior 
development, whose progress is necessarilyslower. Some of the advantages derived 
from this arrangement may be stated as follows: (1) The two classes thus formed 
are taught independently of each other and share alike the teacher’s time and atten- 
tion; (2) the alternate recitations of the classes afford an opportunity for study 
during school hours; (3) the bright pupil being disincumbered in his class rela- 
tions, is free to attain the greatest possible in school advancement, while the dull 
pupil, being undisturbed by the discouragements of class comparison or criticism, 
may be led, though at a slower pace, to the attainment of a reasonable measure of 
proficiency by the use of means and methods adapted to his capacity; (4) the inter- 
val between the two classes need not necessarily be so great as to prevent an easy 
transition from one class to another when the interest of the pupil or that of the class 
renders his promotion or retrogradation necessary. 
  DIVISION INTO BRIGHT AND DULL, WITH EQUAL TIME, BUT DIFFERENCE IN COMPRE- 
HENSIVENESS OF INSTRUCTION. 
Supt. C. A. Daniels, Malden, Mass.—Every class composed of pupils of only one 
grade should be divided into two sections in every study except spelling, writing, 
drawing, music, and oral instruction. One of these sections should be employed in 
study while the other is reciting. The length of the recitation should be the same 
for both sections. Section A in each study should be composed of pupils capable of 
doing more and better work in that study than those of Section B, and should com- 
prise the majority of the class. The teacher will thus be enabled to devote more in- 
dividual attention to the members of Section B. Work suited tothe capacity of the 
pupils should be assigned to such section. Both sections will be expected to com- 
plete the part of the course of study assigned to the grade; but Section A will have 
a more comprehensive knowledge of the subject than Section B. Pupils may be 
transferred from one section to the other at any time during the year, whenever, in 
the opinion of the teacher, such transfer is deserved. 
DIVISION INTO BRIGHT AND DULL, ASSIGNING UNEQUAL TIME, BUT THE SAME WORK. 
Supt. James McGinness, Owensboro, Ky.—Each class, as soon as practicable, and 
early in the term, should be divided into two sections, one larger numerically than 
the other, each having the same amount of time for recitation and for study during 
school hours. The section of fewer pupils, while receiving the same time as a class, 
receives more time and attention individually, and thus theslower or lessthoroughly 
prepared pupils are able to catch up or keep up with the others. Provision should 
be made under this arrangement for having the pupils pass from one division to 
the other in the same room during the year, according to the character of the work
-P-A-G-E-354
  1002 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
done. There should be no stigma or reflection cast upon the pupils of the lower sec- 
tion. It might be well to designate them assections “ A” and ‘“ B” instead of upper 
and lower. 
DIVISION IN BRIGHT AND SLOW, WITH ‘‘SUPPLEMENTAL WORK” FOR THE BRIGHT. 
Supt. I. C. Olendenen, Cairo, Ill.—We have an average of fifty pupils in one teach- 
er’s charge and of the same grade. These we divide into “bright” and “slow,” or 
“A” and “B” divisions, both doing the same work, but the former having and 
requiring much less time than does the latter for class recitation. The ‘“ brights” 
are kept employed with supplemental work. 
DIVISION OF BRIGHT AND DULL PUPILS, GIVING EACH EQUAL TIME, BUT UNEQUAL 
AMOUNT OF WORK. 
Supt. James C. Harris, Rome, Ga.—Each grade—from thirty to fifty pupils—is made 
into an upper and lower section for class work and seat work, according to advance- 
ment and capacity of pupils. The upper section is expected to do more and better 
work and are more certain of promotion. Those failing of promotion are placed in 
the upper section at the beginning of the following year, but again subject to demo- 
tion to lower section of same grade. 
SUBDIVISION INTO “POOR” AND ‘ BRIGHT” IS HARMFUL. 
Supt. Leigh R. Hunt, Corning, N. Y.—I want the poor pupils to be lifted up by con- 
tact with the best. Subdivide a class with “poor” and “bright,” and the dull are 
disheartened and stay poor always. 
SLUGGISH MINDS ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE BRIGHT. 
Supt. John A. Stewart, Port Huron, Mich.—The sluggish minds will develop a depth 
of thought that will prove most beneficial to the so-called bright minds. Two heads 
are better than one, and two or more varieties of thinkers and workers will develop 
a thought better than one variety. 
AN ADDITIONAL STUDY IN A HIGHER GRADE, 
Supt. H. F. Derr, Elgin, Ill.—We have a method of promoting that takes away 
many of the evils of the “year-long intervals” of promotion. I have used it satis- 
factorily for ten years. 
When a pupil is able to do more than his class, let him take one additional branch 
in the next higher grade. If he can do this satisfactorily, let him drop that study 
in his regular grade and add a second branch in the higher grade. If he can do this 
additional work well and the regular work well, again drop the study in the regu- 
Jar grade and give him another study in the higher grade. If he can do this well 
and is good in the remaining studies of the lower grade, promote him wholly to 
the higher grade. 
This plan does not break the yearly classification, never gives the pupil more 
than one extra study, and gives every bright and strong pupil a chance to do his 
best. 
OVERLAPPING OF GRADES, 
Supt. H. L. Taylor, Canandaigua, N. Y.—My solution of the problem is to arrange 
programmes of adjacent grades so that the brighter pupils may take parts of two 
grades’ work, while the duller can, if necessary, take a year and a half to a grade, 
GRADUAL PROMOTION. 
Supt. W. R. Prentice, Hornellsville, N. Y.—In a measure we avoid the trouble that 
comes from grading by promoting at any time any pupil who is able to do more 
work, doing this so gradually that he does not skip any important work. 
ELECTIVES FOR BRIGHT PUPILS, WITH MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE DULL. 
Supt. M. A. Yarnell, Sidney, Ohio.—The problem of classification can best be solved 
in the course of study by making it flexible, ‘‘enriching” it with enough electives
-P-A-G-E-355
  CLASS INTERVALS IN CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 1003 
to keep the brightest pupil from marking time and with minimum requirements 
small enough to allow the dullest to attempt the next grade after “repeating” once. 
If the course is rich enough the brightest might “repeat” with profit. 
EXTRA COURSE OF READING FOR BRIGHT PUPILS. 
Supt. M. E. Hard, Salem, Ohio.—There is but little difficulty in promotion to 
higher grades until you reach the A grammar grade. We sometimes give the 
brighter pupils an extra course in reading to occupy their time, and they regard it 
quite an honor. 
ELECTIVES FOR BRIGHT PUPILS. 
Supt. E. Hunt, Medford and Winchester, Mass.—Bright pupils should have an elect- 
ive in the grammar grades—Latin, Freneb, or German—as we do in Winchester. 
COLLATERAL WORK OF A MORE ADVANCED CHARACTER. 
Supt. C. F. Boyden, Taunton, Mass.—In grades below the high school our ‘course 
of study” prescribes certain limits—the minimum—that must be reached. Teachers 
are encouraged and expected to give the bright pupils extra collateral, and, if pos- 
sible, more advanced work than that required by the ‘‘ course.”

EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS. 
  
I. Reports MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE OF 
THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION BY ITS COMMITTEE 
ON SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
(a) PRELIMINARY REPORT, MADE AT ger PHILADELPHIA MEETING, FEBRUARY, 
GENTLEMEN: Your committee appointed at the last annual meeting for the pur- 
pose of considering and reporting on the subject of school statistics, beg leave to 
offer the following preliminary report, setting forth the results of their studies on 
the subject, and postponing for another meeting, or for the work of another commit- 
tee, if it be your pleasure, the completion of the details of a scheme of statistics 
which will afford the data required for a comparative study of domestic and foreign 
educational systems. : 
Your committee would first call attention to the object and purpdse of collection 
of statistics, which they conceive to be the following: 
Statistics reveal the nature and efficiency of the powers-and forces involved in a 
process. Forces and powers are revealed in their results. Their results are of lit- 
tle moment, if dead results, except as they indicate what the living power has been 
and stillis. In matters of education we inquire into the aims and purposes of the 
educative process, and learn this by a quantitative study of the means employed and 
the results obtained. It is evident, therefore, at the outset, that the quantities given 
by our statistical tables can have no significance except in connection with the qual- 
itative elements involved. We pass over at once from the how many to the what 
kind. We seek, again, new quantitative data that may indicate the quality, but we 
never reach quantitative data that are significant in and for themselves. 
Your committee would suggest as the four principal heads under which school 
statistics may be grouped: Virst, attendance of pupils. Second, course of study. 
Third, teaching forces and appliances. Fourth, swpport—revenue and expenditures. 
Under these four heads they would group the following details: 
  i. 
Statistics of attendance should answer questions like the following: (a) How 
many? (b) How long? (c) Who? That is to say: (1) How many pupils in the 
aggregate? (2) How many relatively to the entire population? (3) How many. 
relatively to the population of the school age, say 5 to 21, 6 to 14, or some other 
period agreed upon? Then this item should be further defined in five items: (1) 
How many enrolled during the annual session of school? *(2) How many as. aver- 
  
* In a report made to. the National Council of Education in 1801, by W.T. Harris, chairman of com- mittee, tho question of duplicate enrollments, was discussed as follows (Proc. Nat. Ed, Ass., 1891, 364, 365) : “We have to inquire first, what is the total number of different pupils enrolled in school in the course of the year? This is the simplest of all inquiries, and yet there is great difficulty in obtaining accuracy in régard to it. for the reasons: first, inaccuraté bookkeoping by the teacher; secondly, the habit of duplicate registrations. 
«The statistics of no country or State can be considered as yet perfectly reliable in this item. Here are some of the ways in which duplicate registration comes in: “(q@ In rural districts a winter school is kept by one teacher, probably a man, and in the summer another session is kept, and by a woman. ‘The statistics of these schools are reported to the central office of the town and thence to the State without making account of the duplicate registration of pupils. ‘The summer school registers a large number of new pupils, especially of young children, but retains a good many of the winter pupils. As towns grow populous the two-session school is ‘sup- 
    
  
  planted by the continuous-term school, and one registration takes the place of two. ‘The States with rural districts which are gradually adopting the continuous-term school, therefore, frequently show a decreasein tho annual enrollment of pupils, aud seem, therefore, to be retrugrading, whereas they are 
1011

age belonging? (3) How many in actual average daily attendance? (4) Howmany 
were dropped and afterward readmitted? (5) The number of cases of tardiness. 
Under the second item of attendance (How long?) we wish the number of daily 
school sessions for the year, and the hours of a school session, the length and hour 
of recesses and intermissions. 
Under the third item of Who? we include such terms as—(1) How many of each 
sex? (2) How many at each year of age, and the average age? (3) Race. (4) How 
many born in the town or State where the school is situated? (5) How many born 
in other parts of the same nation? (6) How many born abroad? (7) Occupations 
of parents. 
II. 
Under the second of our four chief heads we should ask for statistics regarding the 
course of study, and thus determine by this grade of schools as follows: (a) Kitfder- 
garten. (b) Primary and grammar school. (c) Secondary education. (d) Higher 
education. 
We should ask very caretully as to the relations of these items to the first class of 
items, especially age, sex, and average attendance. 
The primary and grammar schools are to be distinguished from the secondary 
schools by the following tests: The introduction of algebra or of an ancient or mod- 
ern language marks the beginning of the secondary course of study. The higher 
course of study should be marked by analytic mathematics, or by logical and philo- 
sophical studies, or by advanced language studies. 
‘ Til. 
The third general head, ‘The Teaching Forces and Appliances,” includes: (1) 
Buildings and accommodations. (2) Size of schools under one principal teacher (or 
else number of pupils per teacher). (3) Number of teachers. (4) Supervision. (5) 
Means of training teachers. (6) Examinations of teachers. (7) Methods of discipline 
and instruction used by teachers. 
Ty. 
‘The fourth general head, ‘‘The Support of Schools,” includes: (1) Revenue, items 
of: (a) Receipts from State and local taxation. (b) Receipts from funds or pro- 
ductive property. (c) Receipts, if any, from tuition. (2) Expenditures: (a) For 
teachers’ salaries, including supervision. (b) Incidentals, including janitor hire, 
fuel, apparatus, and other current expenses. (¢) Permanent investments, including 
building and repairs. 
Your committee would call attention to the importance of a detailed discussion of 
the use to be made of these several items, in studying the effective forces of educa- 
tional systems, and in comparing one with another. Such discussion is not here 
attempted, but is suggested as a proper subject of a supplementary report. More- 
over, your committee have observed the prime necessity for such a definition of the 
several items as to prevent misunderstanding. A description of the best methods of 
     
  
improying the quality and quantity of their oducation by inereasing the annual term of school, and by engaging better teachers, and by actually enrolling a larger number of pupils, though not counting any of these twice. “() But there is another source of duplicate enrollment in the fact that some schools—private academies being the first to do this—count each term of the year a separate affair, and give the enroll- 
ment for each of the three or four terms first in detail and then in the aggregate, without deducting duplications, s “(¢) A third and more dangerous form of duplicate enrollment comes from enrolling twice those who are promoted from one school to another during the year; they are counted once in the primary school, for example, and again in the intermediate or grammar school to which they are transferred. This third form of duplicate enrollment used to vitiate the statistics of the large cities on the Atlantic coast—Philadelphia, in one year, for example, counting some 70,000 pupils twice in its returns, and making an aggregate of 177,000 when only 107,000 different pupils were actually enrolled. ““(d) Another cause of duplication is the neglect to make a matter of registration of the item of 
attendance of a pupil in another school within the same year, when receiving him by transfer. The constantly shifting population of a city causes this to be a considerable item. -‘*(e) Lastly, carelessness in keeping the annual register of a large school leads toa duplicate enroll- ment of many pupils who leave in the fall and return to school in the spring. ‘Their former attend- ance has been forgotton by the principal of the school. “There is need for a good device to prevent this duplicate enrollment, which vitiates all conclusions based on the item of actual school attendance. It should be required of each teacher to enter in a column after each pupil’s name the fact of attendance or nonattendance previously in the same year in any other school in the State. “Tn all large schools, where there are many teachers and many separate roll books kept, it. should be required by the principal that each teacher should keep a coluzm in which he or she write after each pupil’s name the ‘annual register number,’ for the pupils enrolled in the annual register should be numbered. This ‘annual register number! will prevent duplicate registration in the same school, and will facilitate the transfer of items of each separate teacher's roll book to the general register.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-365

keeping and tabulating the several items would also be a very useful addition to 
such a report. 
In dealing with reports, not merely reports from a foreign country, but with 
reports from different sections of the United States, your committee has been im- 
pressed with the necessity of a glossary of terms used in tabulating statistics. There 
should be a careful collation of all terms and designations used here and abroad, and 
so minute a description given of the processes of ascertaining the data under the 
several heads as to leave no doubt in the mind as to the exact meaning of each. 
Without this accurate information there can be no satisfactory comparative study 
of school systems. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

(b) REPORT MADE AT THE BROOKLYN MEETING, FEBRUARY, 1892. 
To the Department of Superintendence: 
GENTLEMEN: Your committee, consisting of the undersigned and Messrs. James 
MacAlister and George P. Brown, holding over from the last year, conclude their 
report on statistics by offering, first, a list of the items which, in their opinion, 
shouid be collected to show the workings of a school system. They have arranged 
these items in three classes. The first class includes the essential data which should 
be taken every year, and from all schools. This first list contains the essential and 
indispensable items for every annual report. The second list contains the more im- 
portant of what we may call occasional statistics, and should not be expected every 
year, perhaps, nor from all schools. A State superintendent may, for example, col- 
lect statistics one year regarding the place of nativity of pupils and parents, another 
year he may take occupations, and another year he may collect items regarding the 
preparation of the teaching force. 
In our third list we have included still less essential items, which may be collected 
at still rarer intervals. . 
In the next place, we have given a tabular summary showing in detail the items 
actually collected in the several States of the Union, and side by side with it an ex- 
hibit of the statistical items collected in the several countries of Europe. As these 
details can not be read before an audience, your committee submit the same for print- 
ing in an appendix, hoping that they will be found useful to State officers in the 
preparation of their forms and blanks for collecting these returns. 
All of which is respectfully submitted,    
W. T. Harris, 
Chairman of Committee.

TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN EDUCATION—DEFINITIONS AND FOREIGN EQUIVALENTS. 
1 (a). School age.—Age at which children are permitted free attendance at the public schools. This age varies in the different States, but 6 to 21 may be considered the representative school age in this country, being designed evidently to embrace all minors oldenongh to render schoo! instruction advisa- ble and profitablo to them. ‘The children of school age in each State, whatever that age may be, col- alectively constitute the school population of such State. Norg.—Thero are, in the foreign countries considered in this vocabulary, no terms corresponding in significance to “ school age” and *' school population,” as understood in the United States. In a pop- ular sense, however, as used in literature everywhere, ‘school age” includes the period of life from the age of 4 or 5 years to adult age, as the epoch most suitable for schooling.

graded public school course mark the period of elementary instruction, taking the child at the age of about 6 years. Elementary schools are schools in which élementary instruction is the sole or pre- dominating feature. ‘These in a fully graded course may be subdivided into primary schools (first four years) and grammar (or intermediate) schools (second four years).

A secondary school is a school whose ultimate object is to givea secondary education, and which may or may not have a preparatory course of elementary grade or pupils pursuing elementary 
studies. 
Eng. Secondary (or intermediate) instruction. The term “ secondary schools” in England is applied to certain groups of schools designed for the education of the upper and middleclasses, including endowed grammar (i.e., classical) schoois, endowed nonclassical schools, private schools, and proprietary schools. These are also known as middle class schools. They receive pupils at about the age of 8, continue them in their elementary studies, and carry them along to an age varying from’ 14 to 19, giving them an education in some cases higher, in others— especially in the ‘‘private”’ schools—not so high as is indicated by the term secondary in the 
United States, Thenine great public schools of England (Eton, Harrow, ete.), which areproperly “intermediate” schools—t. e., standing between preparatory primary schools or private tutors, and the “universities ’—receive pupils from 10 to 15, and are of higher grade than most of 
the secondary schools of the United States. Higher board schools have developed in some of 
the large cities, and correspond nearly to our public secondary schools (high schools), giv- 
ing to the children of their people an opportunity to continue their education beyond the ele- mentary grade. About 80,000 pupils pursue high school subjects in elementary schools. Ger. Héhere Unterricht (i.e., higher than that given in the Volksschulen). 
Fr. Enseignement primaire supérieur. The instruction given in the Division de grommaire of

9. Higher (or superior) instruction.—This is supposed to take the fourth epoch of four years inacom- plete course of education, secondary taking the third four years, and elementary education the first eight years. By topics and methods, the higher education i8 distinguished by taking mathematics in those branches which succeed plane geometry and elementary algebra; Latin and Greek writers that require more maturity of reflection to master, such as Horace, Livy, ‘Tacitus, Juvenal, Cicero's moral essays, Homer, Demosthenes, Plato, Aischylus, Sophocles, Euripédes, Aristotle; physics treated by mathematics; thetoric; mental philosophy; the philosophy of history. In general, the studies of higher education are conducted on a comparative method—vwith the purpose of treating each theme in the light of all branches of knowledge. A higher institution of learning is one whose ultimate object is to give a higher cducation, and which therefore may or may not have a preparatory department in which instruction is given in secondary or even elementary branches.

  1020 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
II. EXAMINATION OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF STATISTICS OF PRIMARY IN- 
STRUCTION.! 
[The word “common” (communal), as used in this article, is synonymous with “public.” An “adopted” school is a private school approved, and supported in part by the government. ] 
From the year in which the organic law promulgated in 1842? went in effect 
Belgium has been in possession of complete statistics of primary instruction and, 
since, 1845, she has published regularly the results in triennial reports, according to 
article38 of this law. 
This valuable result has been obtained without too many difficulties, thanks to an 
inspection, the manner in which it has been organized, and to the obligations which 
have been imposed upon it from the beginning. 
The inspection of schools in Belgium is conducted in two stages. There are in- 
spectors of cantons and inspectors of provinces. 
The inspectors of cantons are required to visit the schools under their charge at least 
twice a year. They have to take detailed note of the results of each inspection, and 
to consign them toa register accessible at any time to thé provincialinspector. Ac- 
cording to the terms of the law, this register should contain a statistical account of 
the number of schools of the canton and of the pupils that attend them, with in- 
dication of the methods employed in each school and of the degree of zeal and 
aptitude, of which each of the teachers gives proof. 
A ministerial circular of the 19th of August, 1843, has traced the model of a regis- 
ter for canton-inspection and has indicated the questions which the inspector should 
consider and try to solve, in order to be able to prepare the statistics and draw 
up the reports, which are demanded of him by the government. 
This register is composed of tables after a uniform model. Two pages (left and 
right) are devoted to each school. The tables are divided in three successive sub- 
divisions for each of the three years of a triennial period. Above the heading of 
the table the name of the canton is written. The information should be consigned 
to the register as follows: (1) Date of inspection. (2) Designation; (a) of the 
commune; (b) of the section; (¢) of the population of the section. (3) Teacher; 
(a) name; (b) christian name; (c) age. (4) Nature of the school. [Indicate if the 
school is common (article 1 of the law), adopted (article 3) or private (article 2).] 
(5) Indication of the method of teaching employed by the instructor. (6) Indica- 
tion of the degree of zeal and aptitude of which the teacher gives proof. (7) Total 
number of children instructed by the teacher: (a) boys; (b) girls; (c) total. (8) 
Number of poor children instructed by the teacher: (a) boys; (b) girl; (¢) total. 
(9) Observations. Asto the divers objects which should occupy a teacher in his 
visit to schools, they are mentioned in an ‘‘agenda” placed at the beginning of the 
register. They areas follows: 
I, GENERAL INFORMATION. 
(1) Into how many sections is the commune divided? (2) Designate these sec- 
- tions indicating their population. (3) Make known the number and nature of the 
schools found in each section (distinguishing them in the mamner indicated in the 
heading of the table of inspection). (4) The sections which are deprived of pri-

1 Translation of a: paper read before the International Statistical Congress (Paris, 1878), by M. Lebon, chief of bureau at the department of the interior of Belgium. 2At the time of the presentation of this memoir (July, 1878), the law of 1842 was still in effect. It has been annulled by the law of July 1, 1879. ‘The dispositions of the new law will have the effect of modifying partly the basis of statistics of primary instruction, but the facts presented in the present notice are nevertheless established. Henceforth they will belong to the domain of history; they will serve necessarily as starting point and for comparison for the statistics gathered according to the elements of the new legislation.

g These subjects of inquiry, however numerous and minute they may appear, have 
nevertheless received careful attention and there is not in all the country a register 
of cantonal inspection which has not been kept regularly and up to date. 
On the other hand the provincial inspector, who corresponds directly with the 
canton-inspectors, his subordinates, is obliged to keep a register, by means of which 
he can ascertain if the teachers of his province fulfill their obligations, and if, on 
their part, the communal school authorities execute the provisions of the law in 
paying to teachers the salaries and emoluments which are due to them, 
This organization enables the central administration to obtain in a few days such 
information as it may desire on the subject _of schoolhouses, teachers, pupils, etc. 
For example, in a circular of December 19, 1873, a complete census has been demanded,
-P-A-G-E-374
  1022 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
for the 31st of the same month, having especial reference to: (a) The number, age, 
sex, and degree of instruction of the pupils of schools properly called primary (com- 
munal schools, adopted schools, and private schools) submitted to legal inspection; 
(b) The number of pupils who attend the schools for adults, infant schools, and 
apprentice schools, principally those who are more than 7 and below 14 years old; 
(ec) Thenumber and age of pupils of institutions of secondary instruction (atheneums, 
colleges, middle schools, etc.). 
This census was taken accurately and promptly. The result of it has been pub- 
lished in a special pamphlet, which contains no Jess than 232 pages. 
The provincial inspectors are required to make annually a Eapecd upon the condi- 
tion of instruction within their respective jurisdictions. In conjunction with this 
report they have to furnish statistical tables, as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES. 
(A) Abstract of schools where optional branches are taught. (B) Statistical ab- 
stract concerning the teaching of manual training in primary schools. (C) Attend- 
ance of primary schools. 
Independently of these statistical abstracts there are others of which the data are 
supplied by the provincial administration or by the central administration, those, 
for example, that give the detailed expenses made annually by the provinces and com- 
munes for various purposes related to primary instruction, such as expenses of con- 
ferences of male and female teachers; expenses of primary school exhibitions; con- 
struction and furnishing of schoolhouses; annual maintenance of primary schools 
(salaries and emoluments of teachers, apparatus, ordinary repairs, etc.), infant: 
schools, schools of charity and apprenticeship, schools for adults, ete. The special 
abstracts furnished on these matters by each provincial governor are completed at 
the central administration, in that which concerns the state expenses, by means of 
special registers, showing expenses of inspection and supervision, the expenses of 
normal schools, salaries of officials, purchases, material, scholarships (bourses @’éude), 
ete. 
As to the special statistics of primary normal schools, they are easily compiled by 
the central administration, which has at its disposal the necessary data as to the 
number and age of the pupils, their classification, the number of diplomas granted, 
ete : 
Summing up, the cantonal inspectors can furnish the most detailed statistics in 
regard to schools, teachers, pupils, etc.; the provincial administration possesses all 
the statistical data concerning expenses incurred by the provinces and communes; 
the central administration finally is in possession of all the data necessary to com- 
plete this sum total of information as to the expenses of the state for normal schools, 
for pensions and aids, for pecuniary assistance and grants of every kind, ete. 
There is published every year by the government a detailed statement of funds ex- 
pended for primary instruction proceeding from the following sources: (1) Cash on 
hand; (2) From tuition fees of paying pupils; (3) From public and private benefac- 
tions; (4) From communal grants; (5) From provincial grants; (6) From grants of 
the state. This abstract is composed of six tables, of which the titles and headings 
are as follows:

Besides the detailed statement of the funds employed, the administration presents 
regularly, every three years according to the law, to the legislature a report upon 
the condition of primary instruction in Belgium. The eleventh volume (large folio 
of nearly 900 pages) appeared last year (1877). It contains, independent of the 
special inquiry which took place on the 31st of December, 1873, and of which I 
have spoken above, the statistical abstracts, of which the list is as follows:

the disposition of funds devoted to primary instruction by the government as well 
as by the provinces and communes, ete., for each of the years of the triennial period. 
As is to be seen, these statistics are complete, although confined to fifty-six tables; 
anumber which certainly is not excessive, if it is borne in mind that we are con- 
cerned with a scheme of statistics that will embrace all the data of which primary 
teaching is actually susceptible. 
As to the headings of each of the columns of the tables, I believe I can dispense 
with reproducing them here. The details would be too long. Let it suffice, in case 
of need, to recur to the reports themselves. 
It pertains to you, gentlemen, to determine up to what point the manner in which 
the statistical scheme as drawn up would satisfy the desiderata indicated by the 
tenth question, placed in the programme of the present international reunion. What 
I can affirm is that these statistics are kept regularly, without interruption, and 
have been published for the last thirty-three years (eleven triennial reports), which 
has permitted the central administration of Belgium to trace for this already long 
period those very complete diagrams which figure in the Exposition of the Champ 
de Mars in the special annex of education, and which have attracted the attention of 
the most competent men,

  CHAPTER XXIX. 
DISCUSSIONS OF CURRENT EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS. 
I, EDUCATION. 
The new movement in education.—G. Stanley Hall (in the University Magazine): 
The academic year which closed last October (1891) has been perhaps the most event- 
ful in all the history of education. The December conference. at Berlin, at which the 
Emperor himself made a vigorous address, marked more than anything of recent 
date a distinct advance toward a purely modern and national as distinct from medi- 
sval curriculum. Last September the English schools became practically free. This 
was the result of active efforts for many years, and when the reform is completed it 
will involve an addition of several million pounds annually to the educational bud- 
get. In June last the new French University was christened. This movement will 
place all the institutions of academic grade in France upon the basis of similar in- 
stitutions in Germany, and involve some radical reconstructions, and even some im- 
provements upon the German model. It indicates an unusual confidence in educa- 
tional reforms for France to thus avowedly copy the models of her hereditary enemy. 
During last summer a provisional draft charter for the new Albert University of 
London was drawn up and has been agreed to by most of the higher educational in- 
stitutions of that city, save the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and London 
University, which still hold aloof. This movement is also the result of long struggle 
and promises to give a fit temple of learning to the largest center of population in 
the world. In the province of Ontario, Canada, marked progress has been made in 
the movement toward the federation of universities, a movement which, if it could 
be accomplished in a State like Ohio, which has nearly twice as many as all Ger- 
many, would mark a prodigious advance. The new Stanford University, on the 
Pacitic Coast, has been opened with the brightest prospects; and another with no less 
brilliant outlook is soon to open in Chicago. Great progress has been made toward 
the reduction of the traditional four college years to three. These events are sam- 
ples from which we may divine the great deepening and broadening of educational 
interests. 
If we extend our survey from the last school year to the last several years, we 
find everywhere an advance no less than amazing. France has revolutionized her 
system of lower schools since 1874, and increased her educational budget at a rate 
with no parallel in history, building thousands. of new school houses of all grades, 
asingle lycée that cost $2,500,000, the new sorbonne costing several millions, an 
enormous medical school with clinics, hospital, ete. About 100,000 children in the 
French possessions of North Africa are now at school. Egypt has an elaborate 
school system, the annual reports of which are full of interest. Japan has been 
reconstructed and occidentalized since 1868—its year 1—by an admirable and very 
complete educational system. A London superintendent lately pronounced the 
schools of New Zealand among the best in the world, and the reports from the 
schools of that, till lately, barbarous country, show phenomenal changes. India 
has a system of both indigenous and English schools, and three universities, which 
are as full of interest as they are unique. Australia has just developed a new uni- 
versity; a new one, too, has just been opened at Tomsk in Siberia; Athens has 
lately completed a magnificent.academy building of Pentelecon marble, costing 
$1,000,000, given by a wealthy Greek merchant, Sina by name, and has a well 
equipped university, with acomplete school system; besides Sweden has developed 
the most modern system of intermediate education in the world by a recent revolu- 
tionary law. By the radical new law of 1884 the Russian universities were recon- 
structed with a design on the part of the Government to make them more effective. 
The United States now spends over $170,000,000 a year on its schools, not including 
over $10,000,000 annually spent in its colleges and universities. This is alarger sum 
_ than is spent in any other branch of the public service and is surpassed only by

pensions. The new Catholio University at Washington; the new advances and 
changes at Yale and Harvard universities; of the regents of the University of the 
State of New York; the upward movement at Columbia; the grounding of Clark 
University, the only one in the country devoted solely to graduate work; of the 
Pratt and now the Drexel Institute; the efficient work of Judge Draper, State 
superintendent of the schools of New York; the founding of new journals (The 
Pedagogical Seminary, The Educational Review, School and College, The Academy 
and Edueation), all of higher tone than existed in this country before; the Johns 
Hopkins University; the rapidly growing possibilities of education and scientific 
advance among the Government institutions at Washington, including the new Na- 
tional Museum, the Surgeon-General’s Library building, and now the new observa- 
tory. These show that our own country is not inclined to be behind in this mar- 
velous growth. * * * 
Education has gradually now become an aimost universal faith and practice. It 
is the one thing in which all people, who agree in nothing else, believe. Men differ 
in creed, in race, in culture, in party, but men and women of all ranks and stations 
unite in their faith in the power of curricularized knowledge to prevent a relapse to 
barbarism and to insure general progress and individual success inlife. Philosophy, 
theology, and the church have each at times postulated and sought to establish doc- 
trines and practices in which everybody believed, a consensus omnium gentium. Belief 
in education is this consent. It is more universal than Catholicism. It controls the 
body and soul of the growing child for more hours of every week than any other 
institution in history has ever done. Does not a consent so broad, a faith so deep, 
now give to education a peculiar religious consecration? 
The diffusion of knowledge by newspaper and book.—William T. Harris: Man is first 
a speaking animal and next a writing animal. Each word that he uses expresses a 
general meaning. Each word therefore stores up an indefinite amount of experience. 
All men may pour into it their experience and by it recognize the experience of 
others. The art of writing at once increases infinitely the possibility of intercom- 
munication, because it preserves the experience recorded for persons widely sepa- 
rated in space and far removed in time. It renders every where in some sense a here 
and every when a now. But mechanic invention comes to the aid of speech and the 
elementary arts of writing by printing with movable types. Printing and gun- 
powder are two great elementary arts both attributed to the Germanic race—the 
two wheels of modern civilization, so to speak. But the Anglo-Saxon has added 
the steam engine and the telegraph. The one makes locomotion possible to an 
increasing degree, and the other makes instantaneous intercommunication with all 
places possible. 
Armed with these instrumentalities, our modern civilization lives on a sort of spir- 
itual berderland. It looks across its frontier and is in a constant process of interac- 
tion with all other nations. The great instrument of this process is the daily news- 
paper. People are becoming from year to year a traveled people—in a short time 
the per cent of the population that has crossed the ocean has doubled. The per 
cent that has visited the Western borderland has quadrupled. But the per cent of 
people who live in constant daily interrelation with all mankind by aid of the daily 
newspaper has increased a hundredfold within a single generation. 
This single fact is the most significant one in all modern history. By a glance 
into its meaning we see to what an extent our civilization has become a constant 
miracle. 
There go to the making up of the newspaper of to-day a vast congeries of me- 
chanical and intellectual appliances. It is so complete in its instrumentalities that 
it realizes many of the conceptions cherished in the childhood of the race as mytho- 
logical fancies. Odin’s ravens, the wishing cap of Fortunatus; the cloak of invis- 
ibility, the “‘seven-league boots,” the winged feet of Mercury-—in short, all appli- 
ances whereby a then becomes a now and whereby a there becomes a here, are 
well-nigh realized in the modern daily newspaper, so far as the presentation to each 
man of the spectacle of the activity of his entire race is concerned. The conse- 
quences of this fact are momentous. It is obvious that there is an immense shrink- 
age in the importance of near events, of events that concern small transactions. 
The consequent enlargement of the views of ordinary men, who form.the masses of 
mankind, follows as a result. 
It follows also that urban life—the life of the inhabitant of the city, with its 
social advantages—penetrates the country wherever the railroad and telegraph make 
possible the daily newspaper. It follows, moreover, that the mind of the average 
citizen becomes habituated to thinking of the great individualities of the world, 
such as corporations, states, vocations, social organizations, institutions, commercial 
enterprises, national undertakings; to seeing, in short, the activity of his fellow- 
men under the form of vast processes, instead of that former narrow view of mere 
jndividual exploits of mere commonplace people.
-P-A-G-E-385
  EDUCATION. 1033 
Another consequence of this is the gradual elimination of mere local peculiarities, 
the limitations of caste and narrow self-interest, and the consequent approach of the 
ideas of each and every people—that PRTC StES in civilization and supports its 
daily newspapers—toward a common ideal standard of humanity. This is not a re- 
duction of all to one insipid standard on a lower level; it is the elevation of the. 
members of the human race to the higher level of its ideal. 
The daily glimpse of the spectacle of the human race, which our generation is be- 
coming accustomed to, combines in:one all the educative virtues of the means and 
appliances heretofore employed by the four forms of education furnished by the in- 
stitutions of civilizations, namely, the family, civil society, the State, and the church. 
In proportion as the spectacle of the whole world of humanity becomes an ade- 
quate one, and its presentation a complete one, it becomes wholesome and moral. 
The growth of prose fiction in modern times is a marvelous phenomenon that is 
not to be explained apart from the fact of the newspaper and periodical which has 
furnished the vehicle for its transmission to the public that reads it. ; 
Not only does the well-equipped daily newspaper represent on its editorial staff 
the topics of commerce and transportation, the courts, the local gossip, the tele- 
graph news, the political movements, the new discoveries in science and the useful 
arts, and the new productions in the fine arts, but it gives its department of fiction, 
in which the manners and morals of society are reflected, the virtues and vices and 
their consequences, and especially the habits of polite society. 
If we but consider it, even the so-called ‘trashy novel” has a sideof usefulness. 
It is condemned because of its description of empty trifles, the ceremonies and civil- 
ities of polite society; it expends much space in giving the outermost appearance of 
hings, and its characters are mere ‘‘ dummies,” like those which the clothier and the 
milliner use to support and display their costumes. But even these empty external- 
ities are interesting and valuable to the youth who is trying to rise from a low con- 
dition into polished society by industry and the acquirements of wealth. The boor- 
ishness of manner which hinders him in his progress of ascent is in process of removal 
through familiarity with the ways of society which he finds -described in his 
“trashy” novel. 
Whatever may be the causes of crime, whatever may be its prevention or cure, 
there is force in the argument that the tendency of stories of crime is to become more 
true to the realities, and to present the career of the criminal in its native hideousness. 
All literary art progresses toward completeness cf representation, and even the de- 
prayed taste soon tires of stories which always describe the criminal as successful 
against the law; and the moment that the history of the criminal is given with truth, 
and his deed is shown to involve itsown dreadful consequences, then even the crimi- 
nal novel becomes moral in its tone. 
There is an element of revolt against what is rational in everyone of us, as unre- 
generate or as merely natural beings, i. ¢.,asanimals. It is only as we gradually learn 
to recognize in the law a correct statement of our essential being that we become 
reconciled to it, and take sides against the violator of justice and right. Until then 
we are prone to feel interest in the outlaw, as in one who raises the banner of indi- 
vidual freedom. Liberty is confounded with license. 
It is here that we approach the question of punishment as it is involved in the 
newspaper. For not only is the newspaper infinitely great as an instrumentality 
for education and the widening of intelligence, but in its function of punisher of 
sin and crime, it is the most terrible engine yet invented. 
The urban or city civilization is a newspaper civilization, if we characterize it by 
the most important instrument that it has invented. Into the daily newspaper as 
into a magic mirror the modern citizen looks and sees the spectacle of the doings of 
the entire world. The movements of commerce; the transactions of the various 
nations in so far as these are outside of routine; extraordinary crimes and retribu- 
tions; the events of society; the doings in science, art, literature, the drama, and 
an indefinite domain of personal gossip—all these are presented to the citizen, and he 
regularly adjusts himself each morning to his world environment. 
Formerly, before the railroad and telegraph had rendered possible the daily news- 
paper, each person adjusted himself to his narrow environment through village gossip 
which he heard at the neighboring inn or at the clubs. Now, instead of village gos- 
sip, he reads world gossip without leaving his fireside or breakfast-table. 
In the past civilization each section grew more sectional, except in times of great 
wars that mingled the soldiery of different localities. In the modern civilization 
the daily newspapers of all lands have substantially the same presentation of the 
world, and reflect more nearly the same views. The newspaper is therefore a sort 
of world court, in which passing events are brought up daily for judgment. 
Under these circumstances there arises into power the majestic presence of public 
opinion, a might which controls the actions of kings, the deliberations of parlia- 
ments, and the ballots of electors. Public opinion is become the educator of nations. 
Formerly, through ignorance of the effect that overt acts might have, nations were
-P-A-G-E-386
  1034 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. . 
often precipitated into war. Now, itis easy for statesmanship to feel the pulse of 
nations in advance, and by prudent diplomacy avoid extreme issues. 
The newspaper is the organ of public opinion, and in this capacity it tries and 
“judges criminals, and it punishes all manner of sin that escapes the whip of the law. 
It rewards good deeds, and sounds the trumpet of fame before the favorites of public 
opinion. The newspaper popularizes science and literature. It has a page of fiction, 
in which the modern literary artist paints the ideals of society with halos of glory, 
or with satire and caricature. 
When each human being beholds the same spectacle beheld by all others, and 
assists all in forming the high court of public opinion, there is realized at once the 
most powerful educational means ever invented for uniting men’in thought and sen- 
timent. Even the old-fashioned village gossip was a powerful means in its way to 
eliminate from the individual his whimsicalities and idiosyncrasies. The modern 
public opinion is based on world gossip, and is far more potent for good. Mrs. 
Grundy’s opinion becomes dignified and oracular when it voices the verdict of na- 
tions. 
One consequence of this new realization of the magic mirror in which all human- 
ity is reflected is the rise of the true cosmopolitan spirit—a mutual toleration of all 
peoples. A profounder habit of considering one’s fellow-men enables us to sce the 
same humanity under strange disguises of costume and diverse language. 
By the printed page, now universally diffused and the possible possession of every 
member of society, the humblest individual has access at his own pleasure and con- 
venience wherever time and place find him, to the wisest and most gifted of his rice. 
He may penetrate by his industry during his leisure hours their deep solutions of 
the problem of life, and become himself wise like them. 
Not only the printed book affords this access, but the printed page of the news- 
paper comes more and more to serve up each morning for the people of every unban 
population, #. ¢., every city and town and every village on the railroad, a spiritual 
breakfast, with many courses; a few thoughts of the wise, a poem or two, some 
pepalar statements of the recent results of science, some pieces of biography and 
istory, and, chiefly, a complete picture of the movement of the world of humanity 
far and near—so complete a picture that from day to day the events seem to march 
forward from inception to denouement, before our eyes, with the consequence and 
necessity that we see in the dramas of Aischylus and Sophocles. Through the prose 
reality of everyday life as seen in the newspaper column there shines the great pur- 
pose of history. 
We find the printed page inits myriad forms the most potent agency for the realiza- 
tion of the high spiritual being of man in the image of God, and the most perfect 
means for the emancipation of man from slavery to his own ignorance and passions, 
and from his dependence on others for guidance and direction. He becomes less 
dependent on a fellow-man for master—one brain to govern two pair ofhands—and 
more independent and self-directive, more rational, and more participative in the 
wisdom and goodness of the human race. 
This participation has been rendered possible by the inventions which have brought 
the art of printing to what itis and by the other inventions that have facilitated 
transportation and rapid communication. 
Delayed development.—Rev. A. H. Quint, in the Congregationalist: Some natures 
start upon what may be called a visible development later than others. The schools 
are full of such cases. From some cause, perhaps from unfavorable circumstances, 
the powers were not awakened. It was like seed in a cold soil. Perhaps some 
stimulus was needed, some motive power, sufficient to awaken the energies. Some 
boys have been waiting for a wise teacher to direct them. It is unfortunate that 
the system of sharply graded schools, with all its advantages, has the disadvantage 
of depressing individuality. In the old district schools younger or slower pupils 
learned nearly as much by absorption from the recitations of the more advanced as 
from their own direct study. The graded system naturally keeps back the slower 
minds, especially by failure to allow promotion, often to their positive injury. Such 
lack stimulus, lack encouragement. Iam sure that pupils often do better by going 
on very imperfectly than they would by being kept back for continual restudy of 
the same monotonous work. Many a teacher thoroughly understands this subject 
- and adapts his work to the individual needs of pons into whose condition and 
ability he has an intuitive insight. The true teacher never despairs. 
Then, again, some minds work more slowly than others and the development at 
different stages is, of course, later. Here, again, is a defiance to any theory of 
uniformity. The machinery which would demand such uniformity is necessarily 
clumsy. Nor is slowness a cause for discouragement. It is not rapidity of growth, 
but its quality, which tells. Sunflowers grow up very rapidly, and the growth of 
white oaks in a year’s time is hardly visible. But the white oaks last for centuries. 
It is not true that college valedictorians are never heard of after graduating. But
-P-A-G-E-387
  cot EDUCATION, : : 1035 
it is often true that in the course of years many a classmate develops into a greater 
manhood than the valedictorian. Perhaps the first scholar ripened too early and in 
his brilliant exercise of powers exhausted those powers or attained his growth inhis 
youth. It would not be a fair comparison to say that the early summer fruits are 
the specially short-lived ones as compared with those of autumn, but it is true that 
youthful brilliancy may not be the strongest prophecy of solid autumn harvests. 
Nor is it a fact that men destitute of early rapid development may not come to be 
the strongest men in a mature generation. There would be no difficulty in finding 
the names of men whose early development was slow, but whose ripened experience 
has given them positions of respect and pewer. On the other hand, I recall ashrewd 
remark made regarding a particular person before his life ended at a mature age: 
“Yes, he has been avery promising boy all his life.” 
There is sometimes another reason for delay in development. It is when the person 
has not found his fitting place. Iknow a boy—no, he is a young man—who is mak- 
ing a remarkable success in everything pertaining to electricity and electrical ma- 
chinery. He never was a dull boy, but Iam sure that he would have practically been 
a failure if the tastes of his boyhood had been thwarted. _His mental development, 
aside from his mere technical knowledge, is as strong and clear as that of men in any 
pursuits. He might never have been an able lawyer, but his training in his own 
line has given him as vigorous,clear, and accurate a mind, and as good power of rea- 
soning, as is secured by lawyers, of a high grade. Sometimes such development 
waits for just the right line in life. If there be real power, there is restlessness un- 
til the true place is found. That place, for the best development, means conscience, 
object in life, tastes, and mental characteristics. Given the right opportunity, and 
such a person goes on to success. If development is not witnessed, it is fair to ask 
whether there has been the natural opportunity, so far as work is concerned. Inthe 
case of a boy, it is fair to ask whether his natura! drift has been observed; whether, 
if he is old enough, some object in life is clearly before him, in which he is to find 
stimulus for preparation; whether he is under the guidance of a teacher who com- 
prehends his fitnesses and needs; whether he is the victim of some system of ma- 
chinery as remorseless as that of a cotton mill. 
The worst method of dealing witha slow boy is to get angry and call him hard names. 
Give him a chance. Deal gently with him, A slight recollection comes to me of a 
girl in a grammar school who, I was told, could never pass the requisite examina- 
tion for promotion. I was present on the day of a kind of exhibition examination. 
I had asked to have this girl quietly pointed out to me. Questions in arithmetic 
were thrown out to the class; up went the hands of ready pupils, and the girl in 
question seemed to me rather bewildered. I concluded to try an- experiment. I 
asked the teacher to give out another problem very slowly, to repeat it after a pause, 
and said that no hands were to be lifted until I called for them. I gave a considera-

I naturally asked her for the answers. Her work was correct. Shehad been suffer- 
ing from impatient haste.   
The relation of mnemonic systems to the cultivation of power of thought.—Report of a 
committee of the National Council of Education: Your committee for psychological 
inquiry have selected for their report this year the question of mémory so far as it 
relates to schemes devised for its aid. They have considered it to be evident that © 
whatever cultivation of memory tends to the arrest of the power of rational thinking 
is to be by all means avoided. It seems, therefore, to them that some of the schemes 
of mnemonics which are advocated are to be condemned withoutreservation. Those 
which proceed upon the principle that memory is to be cultivated by association, and 
that all kinds of association are equally good, should fall under the ban, Yor in order 
to find interesting associations they suggest the search for absurd and ridiculous 
relations. The philosopher Locke has condemned such devices, and asserted that 
“the connection in our minds of ideas in themselves loose and independent of one 
another has such an influence, and is of so great force, to set us wrong in our actions, 
as well moral and natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves, that perhaps 
there is not any one thing that deserves more to be looked after.” 
Your committee think that in all cases the mind should seek essential relations, and 
particularly the relation of cause and effect and that of individual and species. Nec- 
essary connection enables the mind to make deductions, and thus it acquires a sort of 
generative memory, so to speak, a memory which can deduce or develop from given 
data the other data that stand in relation to it. It is true that this is diffieult with 
regard to certain classes of memory, as, for instance, the memory of proper names, or 
the memory of dates, or memory of words in general. 
Your committee think that the memory of dates, names, or words in general can 
and should be cultivated to some extent without attempting association of any 
kind except that of sequence. The committing to memory of fine passages from 
poets and literary prose writers certainly cultivates a memory for words without  
-P-A-G-E-388
  1036 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
detriment to thought. A memorized list of proper names, names of persons of his- 
toric note or characters in the great literary works of art, such as the plays of 
Shakespeare, the Iliad, and Odyssey—the memorizing of these names will serve the 
double purpose of being at once very useful and a means of arousing into activity 
faculties in the mind grown torpid. Also the memorizing of paradigms in the study 
of language has the effect to cultivate this memory of words and isolated items. If 
the mind thinks at all in the process of memorizing these lists of proper names and 
the important dates of history or the paradigms of grammar, it considers the deeds 
and characters of the persons named, or the events associated with the dates, or the 
logical relation of the inflections to the verbs and nouns inflected. And such kind 
of thinking as this is positive and valuable. But in case of associating in accord- 
ance with certain mnemonic rules the names, dates, and inflections with arbitrary 
and fanciful suggestions, the thinking power is set moving on wrong lines. 
If the discovery of Broca, generally recognized as the beginning of physiological 
psychology on the new basis, is to be understood in the sense that a certain con- 
volution near the base of the brain is used by the mind in recalling words and asso- 
ciating them with ideas, it would seem that a cultivation of the memory of words 
should be undertaken in later life by all people who have an incipient tendency to 
aphasia. _ If a person finds himself forgetful of names it is a health-giving process 
to take a certain portion of time in committing to memory words. If this is done 
by committing to memory new master-pieces of poetry and prose, or in committing 
to memory the words of a new language, there is profit and gain to the thinking 
powers as well as to the memory. Doubtless the cultivation of verbal memory, 
building up as it does a certain convolution in the brain, has a tendency to prevent 
local paralysis in that organ. 
This contains a hint in the direction of keeping up in the later part of life the 
faculties which are usually so active in youth. The tendency is to neglect childish 
faculties and allow them to become torpid. Butif this is liable to weaken certain 
portions of the brain in such a way as to induce hemorrhage, ending in softening 
of the brain, certainly the memory should be cultivated, if only for the health of 
the brain and the memory, for mechanical items and details should be cultivated 
on grounds of health as well as on grounds of culture. 
Your committee presents these considerations as looking towards the true solution 
of the much-vexed question of memoryin schools. Theextreme advocates of rational 
method of teaching are perhaps wrong in repudiating entirely all mechanical mem- 
ory of dates and names oritems. Certainly they are right in opposing the extremes 
of the old pedagogy, which obliged the pupils to memorize page after page the con- 
tents of a grammar “verbatim et literatim et punctuatim,” as, for instance, the 
graduates of the Boston Latin School tell us was the custom early in this century. 
But is there not a middle ground? Is there not a minimum list of details of dates 
and names which must and should be memorized both on account of the health of 
the nervous system andonaccount of the intrinsic usefulness of the data themselves? 
And must not the person in later life continue to exercise these classes of memory 
which deal with details for the sake of physical health? 
Your committee have obtained the assistance of a distinguished specialist in these 
matters of memory, Dr. Pick, of London, who is noted for his repudiation of fanciful 
methods of mnemonics and for his adoption of rational methods in their place. Dr. 
Pick has promised to open the discussion on this report by some appropriate remarks,

Childhood from a medical standpoint.—Henry Ling Taylor, M. D., in the Popular 
Science Monthly: It is natural for the young child to move about and change its 
attitude almost incessantly; in the words of Sir William Jenner, “it joys to exercise 
every muscle;” and it is equally true thatits eyes, attention, and mind should never 
be directed continuously at one object for very long. A child loves to glance at this 
object, pick up that, reach out fora third, not restlessly but wonderingly, caress- 
ingly, and joyously, just as a short time before the infant played contentedly with 
its rattle or its ring, waving it about or putting it into its mouth with endless repe- 
tition, but always without studious observation or strain of attention. I am afraid 
we often injure their small eyes and tender brains by requiring continuous repose of 
body and fixation of eye and attention on some one object, as is often done in the 
kindergarten and primary work, at the cost of ocular and nervous strain; and this 
combined with bad light and general driving may account for much of modern myo- 
pia, headache, and nervous troubles. We should advance in the education of muscle, 
eye, and brain from the general to the particular, and impose no task requiring pre- 
cision or intense application upon young children, Nature is a good schoolmistress,
-P-A-G-E-389

and her lessons are fundamental ones, no matter how much we may supplement them 
at school or university. The infant is learning fundamental lessons in the correla- 
tion of muscle, brain, and sense, through the almost incessant activity of arms and 
legs—at first without purpose, afterward in reaching, grasping, or trying to move 
about, and also when it smiles back at its mother or is quieted by her voice; so is 
the child repeating nursery rhymes, or busy with its quiet play or romping games; 
or the youth with his carpenter’s tools, or riding, swimming, or hunting, and learn- 
ing just as truly, and perhaps more truly, than the student burning midnight oil 
over Greek and calculus. Nature is never systematic in the school sense; and, how- 
ever much we may systematize, we must at the same time cultivate our pewers and 
round out our individuality by keeping in touch with so much of nature and man as 
lies within our horizon in a restful, informal way. If a man is to develop into some- 
thing more than a machine or formula, he should be encouraged from childhood to 
bring all his powers into relation with his environment and to seek a wide range of 
adjustments between himself and the outer world beyond the tread-mill round of 
special or formal pursuits which necessarily occupy much of his attention. Many 
fail to appreciate the importance of this indispensable natural culture, and endeavor 
to supplant the spontaneous by the formal. I know of a little girl whose interest in 
flowers was destroyed by an attempt to teach her technical botany at too early an 
age, forgetting that it means more to love flowers than to know botany. In another 
case the attempt was made to substitute history for a boy’s ordinary reading, with 
the result of spoiling the boy. On reaching manhood his favorite author was E. P. 
Roe. 
The true aim of education—Dissipation of energy.—L. J. Rundlett, superintendent 
of Concord (N. H.) schools: The tendency of all education should be toward the 
moral. All the force and resources at our command should centre in the formation 
of those principles that lead to the development of true manly and womanly char- 
acter. 
Education is not so much a matter of memorized matter from books. as it is a well- 
defined knowledge of what constitutes good citizenship—a courage to do what is 
right, a zeal for work, and an inclination to make the best use of one’s ability. If 
a boy has all these he possesses a good education. Society is far better off with an 
ignorant man who is well disposed, than with a college-educated man of vicious 
principles. The trouble comes not of systems, other than of systems as products ef 
“the times. In order to reform the former, we must first reform the latter. 
The river of knowledge formerly flowed in a narrow channel. Its powers lay in 
its depth, and its force was resistless. The river to-day is thinning into shallows, 
and its force is somewhat diminishing. 
It is dissipation of energy that is to be feared. In’ trying to grasp everything we 
retain nothing. This lack of concentrated thought appears in all our pleasures, in 
our business, and to some extent in the common school. Children must be educated 
younger than usual to satisfy fashion and educational demagogues. Everything 
must be taught and the work must be done in the shertest possible time. The idea 
is wrong, and the results sad to contemplate. Society, having partially lost its 
standard of matured thought, intellectuality, and the charm of home-bred common 
sense, clamors for the youth in his teens. The result is the school system is blamed 
if results are not forthcoming in the shortest time possible. The school is not at 
fault, but rather the times. 
The best education possible to those who will have no other.—Albert Bushnell Hart, in 
the Educational Review: We have two very distinct classes of pupils in the gram- 
mar schools; children who do not expect to go beyond the grammar schvols and 
children on their way to college. Of course the schools, the academies, high schools, 
colleges, and universities are all engaged in different branches of the same pursuit; 
of course they must work together. Cambridge makes careful and very expensive 
provision for the preparation of boys and girls for college. Should the city go below 
its Latin school and make any sort of special provision for future college students in 
the grammar schools? In the minds of the committee it has seemed more important 
to organize as good a course as possible for those who stop at the end of the grammar 
school. It seemed likely that an improved course would also carry children farther 
on the road toward higher education; but the motive has been the desire to furnish 
the best education possible to those who will have no other education; to make the 
people’s schools more popular because more effective, and to carry more children to 
the end of the grammar-school course. 
What makes great books great.—The Christian Union: Literature is not information ~ 
nor fact. It is specifically and distinctively life. Great books contain invaluable 
knowledge and are full of the richest specific instruction, but that which makes them 
great is neither the knowledge nor the power of instruction; itis the life which they 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  1038 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
contain. Whoever gets at their secret finds himself in contact with a deep, rich, 
inexhaustible life; for Milton did not exaggerate when he said that a great kook 
contains the lifeblood of a master spirit. Itis made great by this supreme vitaliza- 
tion, so that while Shakespeare and Dante crowd their pages with historical knowl- 
edge, with incisive comment, with the very substance of instruction, the supreme 
quality which they give is this quality of life. To come in contact with literature 
in its great works is, therefore, to bring one’s self to the very fountain of life; to 
keep one’s self in constant companionship with Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and 
Goethe is to keep one’s self in daily contact with the greatest sources of intellectual 
life. No man who knows this Shakespeare on the literary as well as on the scholarly 
side can by any possibility be a dull man or a dead man. There-is a vitality in 
Shakespeare which, if constantly communicated, gives the most obscure and narrow 
life into which it is brought breath, movement, and enthusiasm. A man saturated 
with Shakespeare would be educated if he knew nothing else. To know Homer, 
Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe in a genuine way is to give one’s own life something 
of the breadth and the movement of the four great ages of civilization represented 
by those great writers. The teacher who feels thoroughly the spell of the ‘Odyssey ” 
has more power of conveying to his pupilsan adequate idea of what the ocean means 
as a feature of the natural world, as one of the sublimest parts of nature, and asa 
means of communication between races than the man who has the most exact scien- 
tific knowledge of the whole subject. The teacher who knows his Dante to the 
heart can give his pupils a clearer notion of what the Middle Ages were in their 
essential life, their worship, reverence, wonder, and intensity than he who knows 
the whole literature of the subject without entering into the secret of it; while the 
teacher who can put his English history into the hands of his pupils because he sees it 
with Shakespeare’s eyes and realizes it with Shakespeare’s imagination will have infi- 
nitely more power than the man who has all the facts at his finger’s ends. These 
great writers are the sworn and irresistible foes of routine and deadness. They are 
full of immortal freshness of life, seen with new eyes, and reported at first hand. 
Slow-footed erudition, methodical, patient, and eminently uninspired, may sink her 
wells into them from generation to generation and yet leave them exhausted. 
Il, HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Intellectual overproduction in Germany.—Dr. Geffcken, in The Forum: Germany 
stiffers from an intellectual overproduction. All professions are overcrowded. It 
was fondly believed up to our days that the state had no more important task than 
to render the acquiring of knowledge as easy as possible, and for that purpose to 
establish many higher schools. But it was not asked whether there was room 
enough for employing men when their education was finished. Taking, for instance, 
the career of law in Prussia, we find that there are 1,851 men who have not only 
passed through the gymnasium and the university, but have already served the state 
gratis for about five years, while the annual average demand is 100. There aremore 
than 7,000 examined architects without a fixed employment; it is the same with 
engineers, teachers in classics, mathematics, ete. These unemployed forces are par- 
ticularly attracted to the great capitals because everyone hopes that with the many 
chances they offer he will find a gap into which he may jump. Men of university 
training are, almost without exception, capable only of intellectual work. _ If they 
do-not succeed in their branch they can not become tailors or carpenters; they must 
take to pettifogging, giving lessons, copying, writing for inferior papers, etc. There 
are lawyers, physicians, doctors of philosophy among those who are regularly relieved 
bythe Berlin poor board. All these men are of course discontented with the present 
state of things, and ready to join with those forces which hold out hope of over- 
throwing it. Nor are female candidates wanting in this proletariat. All those who 
give cheap lessons, write mediocre novels for low-class journals, or work for shops at 
starvation wages are swelling the army of social revolution. 
College graduates as business men.—President Seth Low, of Columbia College: As 
one who has carried his college education out into the world and tested it there, and 
who now has returned to the educational field to concern himself with the problems 
that are found there, I want to bear my testimony to the value of this thing which 
we call the higher education. It is doubtless true that the college graduate enter- 
ing upon a business career is at a disadvantage during the first few years of his busi- 
ness life as compared with those who entered business when he entered college. If, 
however, the man has a capacity for business, I venture to say that in five years, 
certainly in ten, he will find himself.more than abreast of his friend who did not go 
to college. The trained mind can master the problems of business better than the 
untrained mind, as it can master other problems better for which it has itself any 
natural capacity. Beyond that, the man himself, outside of business, will have more 
- resources, and is likely to be a greater power in the community in which he lives.
-P-A-G-E-391
  
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 1039 
When it is contended that college-bred men rarely succeed in business it is to be 
remembered that it is currently believed that 95 per cent of all men who engage in 
business sooner or later fail. It is only the select few in any department of human 
activity that conspicuously excel. It may easily be that the tastes which lead 
men to go to college are not frequently found in combination with what I may call 
rare business genius. I venture to predict, however, that should such a combination 
exist, a college education, so far from unfitting the man for a business career, would 
mae eee power in the business world beyond all his compeers who had not been 
so favored. 
Educational value of different studies.—Inspector John Leath, of Ontario: It is, I 
believe, far more difficult to reach in Latin or Greek, and especially n Greek, that 
state of proficiency in which the literary value of the language is fairly available 
than it is to reach the same state in either French or German. ‘The educational, not 
to speak of the literary value of Latin and Greek, when properly taught and given 
the necessary time, is greater than that of French and German; and assuming the 
requisite mental maturity, it is easier to become fairly versed in a science than a 
languege, either ancient or modern. But for the ordinary high-school entranté the 
science option, which attaches less importance to mere memorization and more to 
correct observation and induction, is more difficult than a language one. The prac- 
tical value, however, of French or German is greater than that of either Latin or 
Greek. So, too, in the case of a science, the educational value of which, besides, is 
at least as great for the ordinary purposes of life as that of a language; haying due 
regard of course to the fact that, assuming proper receptivity, the science is more 
readily acquired. * * * The science with fractional accuracy—for nothing else 
will satisfy the partisan—is a problem incapable, I believe, of definite solution. 
* * * But the relative value of the departments is not, I hold, a matter of prime 
importanee, so far at least as our high schools are concerned. What one department 
lacks in purely pedagogical value it makes up in greater and more available practi- 
cal usefulness; and so far as the languages are concerned, the real differentiation is 
more marked in the later than in the earlier stages of their acquisition. Most mod- 
ern and progressive universities, also, as, for instance, London and Harvard, equate 
Greek, French, German, and some science, and even so difficult a language as Arabic 
or Sanskrit. This course, we have reason to believe, has proved advantageous to the 
universities and to the general public.! 
  Unwise to crowd a four years’ eourse into three years; the Chicago plan condemned.— 
The Nation: We thinkit a grave question whether the policy here indicated is a 
wise one. We do not think that students ought to be encouraged to crowd a four 
years’ course into three years. We do not think that many young men will be able 
to do this without injury, and Chicago University, which is a coeducational institu- 
tion, encourages young women to doit. The requirement of a medical certificate isa 
confession on the part of the university authorities that such an attempt is fraught 
with danger. But thesafeguard of a “physician’s” (i. ¢., any physician’s) certificate 
is quite inadequate. * * * 
The proposed summer quarter has another side. If there are students there must 
be teachers, and it appears from the calendar that a considerable number of instruct- 
ors will be held in Chicago through the hottest months of the year. It is appar- 
ently to bea serious thing, thissummer quarter; ‘ the courses of instruction,” the cal- 
endar says, ‘“ will in general be so arranged that a student may enter a college or 
school at the beginning of any quarter.” The university is not to play at summer 
schooling; itis to berununder full pressure. Whatthat pressure is we have pointed 
out in our preceding notice. The most important courses of the “academic col- 
leges” are crowded into single terms of six weeks, by devoting ten hours a week to a 
single subject. Throughout the university, courses of less than five hours are excep- 
tional. It is a system of “‘ cram quizzes,” and every college man will appreciate the 
strain upon students and instructors. These long courses in short terms, the attempt 
to keep the university under full steam through the moist heat of a Chicago sum- 
mer, the encouragement given to the student to compress four years’ work into 
three years—the whole scheme breathes that nervous, restless haste which is one of 
‘the most deplorable features of American life; and when our universities come to 
forget that ‘‘school” means leisure, and that high-thinking can not be hurried, one 
of the last safeguards against the national vice of overpressure will be lost. 
The maturer students get the best results —A writer in Education: The object of a 
college education is by no means to get through a certain number of studies. in a 
certain time and be Jaunched in life as soon as possible. When we come to consider 
the effect of the studies pursued on the body and mind of the pupil, and to estimate

his power of absorption and assimilation; when we take into consideration the 
facts that not until 25 or 30 years of age does the body obtain its full growth 
and solidity, and that there is a very close parallelism between the mind and the 
body, we shall rather inquire how we may delay or prolong the pupil’s ised 
for his life work until his mental powers are strong and mature enough to get the 
best good from the studies which he pursues, Our own exp rience and observation 
goes to show that the maturer students in college get the best results from the 
course. 
Profs. Haeckel and Zarncke on the educational value of the classic languages, ete.—The 
following letters were addressed to Felix Adler, of New York City: 
Leipzig, April 17, 1876. 
Hicuty Honorep Sir: You have expressed the desire that I should put in writing 
briefly the views I uttered this morning in our conversation concerning the value of 
instruction in classic languages. I gladly comply with your request, taking it for 
granted that you wish only a brief statement of my yiews, not an extended argu- 
ment, for I scarcely would find the time for the latter. 
I must preface my remarks with the statement with which you are familiar, I trust, 
that Iam an advocate of modern languages and literature, especially the German, 
hence that I might have good reason not to be favorably disposed to the preponder- 
ance of the classic studies, and to wish that to the study of modern literature a 
larger scope be given. However, the contrary is the case. Iam of firm conviction 
that the cultured part of the race would repent if it should temporarily cease to con- 
sider the study of classic antiquity the chiefsource of its entire intellectual culture. 
Howeyer much we may at present be superior to classic antiquity in the separate 
sciences, in general intellectual culture, in acuteness of thought, and in ingenious 
thinking we are not. Under the influence of a religion which is able to grandly 
develop our emotional nature, but which has at all times been disinclined to barren 
criticism and the superiority of the intellect, not even the natural sciences are able 
to prevent us from falling into the errors into which all epochs have fallen that 
turned away from antiquity. Look into history and you will find that all those cen- 
turies which lost intimate contact with antiquity fell into subjective extravagances, 
despite the respectable knowledge and progress they exhibited in the natural sciences. 
The reawakening of the study of the antique world during the fifteenth century 
was the signal for a pee rau eras, of the thinking spirit, and its power has been the 
more important the more it relied upon the thoughts of the Old World, especially the 
Greek. That in the domain of art the Old World was far ahead of the present develop- 
ment of art, in noble forms, I need to mention only in passing. 
This point of view, which is in favor of the study of classic antiquity, I should 
like to term the historic one. Equally forcible is another argument, namely, the 
pedagogical. There is no better means for intellectual discipline than this thinking 
over and over again and observing the act of thinking to which we are forced by 
learning the classiclanguages. There issomething mysterious in its effect, and an ex- 
perience of many years has confirmed this again and again. I am-a member of two 
examining boards, before one of which young men appear who have been educated 
in gymnasia, that is, on a classic basis, while the other board examines young men 
lacking this basis. Now the latter surpass the former frequently in knowledge, but 
in cases where intellectual maturity comes into play, in composition for instance, 
the graduates of classical schools far surpass the graduates of other schools in such 
. a degree that it will scarcely admit of a comparison. 
This formative effect is chiefly due to the Latin language, which, on account of its 
lack of articles and its frequent lack of particles, is not only diametrically different 
from our modern languages, but teaches with what few means and with what grand 
simplicity, great things may be accomplished. Greek with its articles and wealth 
of particles enables speech to assume a great number of shades and tints; it would 
therefore seem more familiar to us. Hence the formative value of the classical study 
is based chiefly upon Latin, and I should therefore never abandon free Latin composi- 
tion. If well directed and not abused by Ciceronean phraseological tinkling, itmay 
be a most excellent means of intellectual discipline. On the other hand, the histor- 
ical value of the study of classical antiquity would seem to be found more in the 
Greek, for the Greeks were particularly productive in philosophy, art, and literature, 
while the Romans were diligent imitators of the Greeks. 
Hence it is my desire that our youth to whom the fortune is granted to acquire 
the highest and most perfect education, try to gain it at the hand of classical lan- 
guages. They may learn to read and understand Greek authors with some fluency, 
above all Homer, the tragedians, Plato and the orators; they may learn also by mas- 
tering Latin grammar and Latin style to think clear thoughts, and to cast and re- 
cast them in new forms. Young men thus intellectually trained will not repent 
having spent much time upon these subjects, time which might have been filled 
perhaps with the acquisition of knowledge and practices that would be of use at

once in every-day life. These men will be the ideal center of the nation, they will 
ennoble and deepen the entire spiritual life of their nation. 
You will find in the foregoing, condensed into a few lines, the main points of what 
a life which has not been without experiences has taught me. Accept*this hasty 
sketch as it is; willingly I should have written more extensively, but I am over- 
loaded with work of the most different kinds. I should be happy to be able to con- 
tribute a mite toward laying the foundation of culture in your continent to enable 
it to become truly productive of ideal fruit. 
With kind regards and the best wishes for your journey, 
Respectfully, yours, 
Prof. Dr. Fr. ZARNCKE, 
Dean of the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Leipsic. 
ZENA, October 18, 1876. 
Hicuiy EstreMEpD CotimaGuE: In accordance with a desire expressed by you, I 
have the honor to communicate to you briefly the views I have formed in the course 
of my university career during the last fifteen years, concerning reforms of academic 
and gymnasium instruction. ‘Thechief stress in such a reform, it seems to me, ought 
to be laid upon the fact that higher education does not somuch consist in the greatest 
possible quantity and in differentiated quality of knowledge, but in a most careful 
training of the faculty of thinking and judging. Especially in our time in which 
the extraordinary perfection of the material means of culture offered by the natural 
sciences, the refinement of our needs, the great upward tendency of the polytechni- 
eal branches, give powerful aid to practical materialism, it appears to me most nec- 
essary to call attention to the great advantages we owe to ideal means of culture, 
and to see to it that the matter of instruction which is visibly growing in quantity 
should not oppress and stifle the learner, but be mastered by him, and made service- 
able. For itis not the mass, nor the variety of knowledge, but the lucidity and 
harmony of the intellect, and the comprehension of the causal connection which is 
the highest aim. 
Regarding the significance of instruction in gymnasia, I wish to say that I belong 
to those who still sec in classical culture the best foundation for all higher scientific 
eulture. Iam specially of the opinion that a methodical study of the classic lan- 
guages (Greek no less than Latin) is indispensable for the latter, and can not bereplaced 
by a study of material things. In comparing such students who came from classical 
gymnasia with those who were educated in modern schools (Realschulen) I always 
noticed the superiority of the former, despite ‘their often defective knowledge. 
Even in the study of any special branch of science, zodlogy for instance, Ihave found 
that the former penetrate into the higher and general problems of science more easily 
than the latter. Iam therefore opposed to the admission of graduates of modern 
schools (Realschulen) to the study of medicine, and I can judge in this matter from 
my own experience. Though pupil of a purely classical gymnasium in which very 
little natural science (except a little physics, etc.) was taught, I have nevertheless 
come to the conviction that the better scientific preparation of the modern school 
student does not in any way secure hima lasting superiority in the study of medicine, 
while his undisputed inferiority in history and philology is, even in this study, of 
great disadvantage. 
With that I do not mean to convey the idea as though I wished to exclude the 
natural sciences from the gymnasia. On the contrary, I believe that they miy be 
pursued with great advantago alternately with historical and philological studies, 
although in a different manner than is now commonly done. Certainly a general 
view over the elements of natural science forms a most desirable part of all higher 
education. But to me it seems that even the lower and middle grades of the 
ymnasium, in connection with the elements of geography, the essentials of the phys- 
ical condition of the universe and our earth may be given. Later might follow the 
essentials of the inorganic natural bédies (though without special descriptive nat- 
ural history). In the highest grades of these schools the essentials of physics 
(together with the bare clements of chemistry), geology (only the main features, 
_ origin, age of the earth, and periods of creation), general anthropology (the human 
frame, races, and language affinities in connection with the history of primitive 
ages). I should think in a few lessons the first element of these important natural 
sciences might be communicated as far as is in fact necessary for every cultured per- 
son. In every one of these subjects I should lay the main stress upon the historical 
development, not upon the knowledge of facts. Mathematics I should continue in 
its place and to the present extent. : 
As far as university instruction is concerned it seems to me to be the most important 
thing that the student be not at once introduced into his special study, but be obliged 
to attend lectures of general interest for at least two semesters, especially philosoph- 
ical (history of philosophy) and historical lectures, ete. A general anthropology, 
ethnography, history of creation, etc., would be interesting alike to all faculties and

would contribute to general culture. Exclusive professional study should not begin 
till the third semester. It would be of undoubted advantage if later on the prac- 
tieal university studies (especially ths technical and administrative branches, clin- 
ical practice, etc.), at least the most special ones, be excluded from the university 
course and treated in higher special schools. With large hospitals, for instance, 
(which medical students visit after the completion of their studies) this is already 
done. The university must remain “ Universitas litterarum.” These are briefly my 
views, which, however, greatly deviate from those of most of my colleagues. Par- 
don the fragmentary nature of my letter; I am overwhelmed with work. 
Most réspectfully, yours,

The readjustment of the school curriculum.—Prof. Roland 8. Keyser, in the School 
Review: If we do not come in the course of a few years to some understanding of 
what constitutes a good high-school course, it will be because we can not interpret 
the teachings of experience. Almost every study and every method of instruction 
is on trial somewhere. The American high school has much greater freedom of 
movement than the grammar school, and it has to a large extent availed itself of this 
freedom. When, however, we are assured by those who have tried one system that 
the results are in the highest degree satisfactory, and by those who, strongly disbe- 
lieving in this system, have tried one very different, that their own results are 
almost ideal, we may reasonably conclude that the lessons of educational experience 
are very hard to read, or else that there is no great difference in methods and studies 
in secondary education. Men whose feelings are strongly enlisted in favor of a par- 
ticular system will be slow to see that it is not entirely satisfactory; while how to 
compare fairly the results of different methods is one of the most difficult problems 
of education. So much depends upon the individual himself that, under any sys- 
tem, pupils will grow up to be men and women who will play their parts in life very 
much according to their abilities. Stimulus and example count for so much, also, 
that it is better to have a poor course of study with the living force of a great teacher 
behind it than a faultless curriculum with mediocre instruction. 
In the present condition of American education there can be no great harm, indeed, 
there may be considerable advantage, in having quite a variation in the high-school 
courses designed to fit pupils directly for life. But the practical advantages of 
having a uniformity in the requirements for admission to college are very great. 
Almost every college has some peculiarities in its requirements; and when a school 
has to prepare pupils for several colleges, as most schools do, it is almost sure to 
give them a poorer preparation than if they were going to a single institution. It 
is remarkable that colleges do not have a course whose requirements for admission 
are the subjects taught in secondary schools in courses which are not classical. Col- 
leges which desire a large number of students bid for them with special or technical 
courses, or with courses whose requirements for admission are not very substantial, 
Colleges would largely increase their number of students and do real service to the 
cause of education, if they offered a course of study such that the requirements for 
admission would be the subjects ordinarily taken by students in secondary schools 
who have no definite intention of pursuing their studies further. 
In all our discussions of the readjustment of the school curriculum, it is well to 
remember that society is being constantly medified, that we are living in a period 
of rapid and often unforeseen changes, and that, as education is to fit men to live 
the life of their time, all arrangemeuts must be more or less provisional. If we aro 
seeking for an ideal curriculum we shall fail, as the wisest men in all the ages past 
have failed. A healthy discontent with our present circumstances and work is wise, 
but it is also wise not to be too discontented. 
IIL. HEALTH OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
The health of school children as affected by school buildings.—G. Stanley Hall, presi- 
dent Clark University: When a child begins to go to school the change of his envi- 
ronment is very great. Instead of constant activity, he must now sit still and keep 
still; instead of moving his hands and arms freely, the strain of effort is now focused 
upon the very few, tiny, pen-wagging muscles. The eyes, instead of moving freely, 
are confined in the zigzag treadmill of the printed line. It is no wonder, therefore, 
that the child so commonly loses weight on first entering school; that shortsighted- 
ness and other eye troubles increase almost regularly through the school period; 
that headaches, anemia, scoliosis, defects of development, if not signs of disease 
appear in stomach, heart, and lungs, and especially in the nervous system, the grad- 
ual deterioration of which is so hard to recognize (see the well-known works of 
Hertel, Key, Warner, Cohn, and others). Ifthe school is tending to physical dete- 
rioration and toward a sickly age, as certain medieval institutions are said to have _

caused the dark ages and the plagues, we ought to knowit. The school ought 
to develop a sound mind in a sound body; for what shall a man give in exchange 
for his health, or what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world of knowledge 
and lose his own health? I hold that it is not too much to say that everything 
about the schcol—building, seats, and desks, hours, subjects, and methods of study— 
should be determined primarily with a view to health, on which, especially in chil- 
dren, even morality so largely depends. * * * 
The schoolhouse, which has been called more important for the development of 
the average child than the home itself, ought to be a palace of health. ~I proceed to 
sketch, very roughly, the salient points culled partly from laws, which are far more 
detailed in Europe than here, partly from norms recommended by educational 
bodies, and partly from ideals described in various books. 
A, The site.—This should be high, dry, a natural and not artificial soil, with no 
foreign matter in it; is sometimes tested by boring; marl, lime, or sand ingredients 
being good, and clay bad. It must be remote, if possible, from liquor saloons, the 
noise of machinery, offensive or unwholesome odors, marshes, ponds, graveyards, 
dust, or any form of nuisance or danger, and the street should, if possible, be 
asphalted near it. One norm prescribes that the distance of the schoolhouse from 
all other buildings should be twice their height. 
B. Yard.—This should be inclosed by a hedge rather than a high wall, or by some 
transparent inclosure, that children may see the life of the street, and that all passers- 
by may see and be interested in the children, their play, and the school. The yard 
should be a porous earth rather than brick. Some norms prescribe three square 
meters per child as the minimum. Sheds for play in rainy days, often with glass 
roofs, are very common, especially in France. A few simple, permanent pieces of 
gymnastic apparatus are perhaps more common inGermany. In more rural districts 
school gardens containing a few medicinal plants, and even a few poisonous ones to 
be avoided, flower beds, a beehive, a tiny hothouse, and even individual beds for 
children to be responsible for, etc., are often found. 
€. Basement and walls.—All the building should be undercellared; should never 
contain water-closets; janitor’s quarters, especially pantries, should be separated 
from the rest of the cellar by tight walls; the floor should be cemented; the base- 
ment should be kept scrupulously clean and well ventilated, and more or less heated. 
Some norms prescribe a water-table all round the building, a meter wide and plas- 
tered, to prevent the ascent of ground moisture. The walls should contain plenty 
of air chambers, and be strong enough for an additional story. Steps up to the 
building should always be protected above and on the sides, or, better yet, within 
the walls. *s 
D. Floors.—The lower floor, for the youngest children, should be at least a foot or 
. two above the street level, should be of beards neither two hard nor too soft, but 
splinterless. Hamburg legislates on the cracks in the floor, which have been found 
to contain almost as many bacteria as the filth under the finger-nails of children. 
The thickness of the floor boards should bear a fixed ratio, often prescribed, to the 
distance between the joists. There should be no dry sweeping, and the floor might 
sometimes be washed with a weak sublimate. Some ideals avoid all corners and 
angles by means of curved moldings such as are sometimes found in hospitals. All 
ceilings should not only be double, but should contain sound-deadening layers. 
E. Halls and stairs.—The halls should be wide, light, well ventilated, so that not 
only clothes racks and umbrella stands can be placed in them, if necessary, and 
sometimes bookcases, etc., but that exercises may be held in them. This is, of 
course, quite ideal. The stairs should be at least ayard and a half wide, with steps 
broad and not too high, and corners not too sharp. The stairway should always be 
broken by one or two landings, never circular; should be of brick or iron, or some 
fireproof material, should have hand rails on both sides, should be light, warm, and 
ventilated. : 
F. The schoolrcoms and windows should contain no posts or pillars, should be from 
3 to 4 meters high; the walls of the room should be of some mild color—light 
blue, green, yellow, or gray. If a wood finish can be afforded, pipes for gas and 
water, and electrical and other connections, should not be covered, Some laws pre- 
scribe the proportion of length of room to its breadth as two to three, some as three 
to five. The ratio of the window surface to the floor has been regulated by many 
laws, and in point of fact has been found to range from one-third to one-ninth. 
There is little unifority as to exposures, but south and east seem on the whole pre- 
ferred. There should be no direct or reflected sunlight. Windows in front of the 
pupil are worse, those behind better, and windows on the left of the pupil are pre- 
ferred. Windows should be openable—a horizontal axis preferred—should go to 
the ceiling, and be square and not curved at the top. The héight of the top of the 
window should be at least three-fifths the width of the room. The bottom of the 
window in one norm must be 1} meters above the floor; another law prescribes a 
minimum distance of 1} meters between windows, but they should beas near together

as possible. Dr. Cohn thinks that each child should see the sky from his seat, and 
has devised an instrument to determine the amount of sky visible to each child. He 
would have a photometer used in each schoolroom, and suggests, as the norm, what 
would be equivalent to the reading of good diamond type at a distance of 10 inches. 
The door should be a meter wide, never behind the children, should open outward, 
and should have a transom. The crosspiece bearing the number of the room should 
be as high as the eye of the average child in that room. 
G. Heating and ventilation.—I am inclined to agree with the sentiment of Dr. Burn- 
ham, that whoever says that any existing system is superior to all others is either 
uninformed and crochety, or else an agent. Architects, as arule, know almost noth- 
ing of heating, and still less of ventilation. It is these matters in which false econ- 
omies are wost often practiced. Living,as wedo, at the bottomof aseaof air, where 
it takes as much force to move 100 pounds of air as it does 100 pounds of iron, we 
forget too that each day has its own problem. Many an excellent system is quite 
ineffective because not well managed through the ignorance or carelessness of a jan- 
itor. To change the air in a schoolroom completely once in every twenty minutes or 
half hour, as should be done if each child has on an average only 14 square meters of 
surface and 5 cubic meters of air space, is avery grave problem. The“ school smell,” 
and theinjury foul air works in the blunting of faculties and the deterioration of tone, 
is due not so much to the carbonic acid as to the organic matter in the air of which 
this is the index. One ideal system is heating at frequent intervals all over and 
through the floor, with gratings and pockets to prevent the ascent of floor dust, by 
a central system regulated by thermometers in each room, with electrical contact 
shutting off or letting on heat automatically—a system, however, involving great 
expense, and therefore not generally practicable. Jacketed stoves, with air coming 
directly from outdoors, are used in country schools. Open fireplaces with their 
great waste are now sometimes resorted to in despair of abettersystem. This whole 
matter is a very complex bundle of problems in physics, as yet but partially under- 
stood, and still less often well applied. 
H, Cost and school architects.—The German Government prints once in ten years 
an account of all educational buildings of all grades, each of which is described in 
tables of fifteen columns. An interesting method of presentation here found is to 
calculate always the cost of the entire building per cubic meter, per square meter, 
and per child, and also the cost of heating, ventilating, and plumbing per cubic 
meter. Educational architecture in Europe, whilenot exactly a vocation by itself, has 
an increasing number of experts, and has a vast and rapidly accumulating literature.! 
Wifhin the last decade and a half the number of buildings erected has been enor- 
mous; a single lycée, recently finished in Paris, cost nearly $2,500,000; a single uni- 
yersity building in Vienna, nearly $4,000,000; and for all grades of education the 
present might almost be called an architectural epoch, Even very special institu- 
tions, like school baths, school dormitories, eye clinics, school and university gym- 
nasia, have claborate laws or norms full of details and specifications, while the 
views of the taxpayer and the doctor, which are perhaps most opposed on the ques- 
tion of expense, are complicated and confused by the traditions of carpenters and 
the ideas of convenience by teachers. 
I. School seats and desks. —These are most important for the child. Sharp corners 
and angles must be avoided; the teacher desixes convenient visibility of as much of 
the child’s body as possible, ease and quickness of getting in and out; while the 
doctor insists on adjustability to every part of the body with severely orthopedic 
exactness. Before Barnard’s epoch-making work, which prompted a German writer 
to say that the school desk was the only contribution of America to pedagogy, seats 
sometimes ran around three sides of the room, so that the children sat with their 
backs toward the center, and must swing their feet over the seat to get out. In 
Freiburg, where many thousands of children were lately measured, the difference in 
total height, and the way that the total height was distributed between back, legs, 
etc., was found to vary. Thus, the method of marching before a scale, in the pres- 
ence of the janitor, the numbers on which designated the seat proper for each 
scholar, seemed inadequate, convenient and rapid as it is for approximating a fit for 
seats. The body should be held upright, in a healthful, symmetrical position, with 
Jeast muscular effort. Seats which favor bad positions tend to lateral curvature of 
the spine and interference with the functions of chest and stomach. The desk 
should overlap the seat by an inch or two; that is, the so-called “ distance” should 
be minus. When the lower leg is at right angles to the floor, and the foot rests 
squarely, the lower part of the upper leg should touch the seat with the lightest 
' possible contact. The distance from the seat to the floor is not the same for two 
persons of the same height, and foot rests, both horizontal and inclined, are very 
common in Europe. To get the distance from the top of the seat to the top of the 
desk, the child should sit erect, and the distance from the seat to the elbow, plus 2

inches, isa common rule. The ideal seat and desk are, of course, adjustable to fit 
each d, and children should be reseated two or three times a year. 
J. Writing.—This is the most important question of school orthopedies, and con- 
cerns especially the spine and eye. The position in writing now much commended 
in Germany is perfect uprightness of the body, both arms resting symmetrically in 
front and upon the desk about 2 inches from ‘the elbow; the copy book square and 
in the middle, no ghtly to, the right, and not obliquely to the edge of the desk 
The new vertical se s an experiment or permanently, in 
a number of places in | Ger many Wi avaria, Wiirtemburg, Bohemia), brings 
5 > line, and the Tine is a very short 
one. Paper stra nt, writing str ght is the motto of this script of 
the future, and deed of a not very remote past. It is easier and more rapid. One 
observer found that over 90 per cent of the children, when required to change from 
the old method of writing to this, straightened up the body, and when changed 
back to the old script, fell into the “cola ipsed” position, and twisted the head so 
as to keep the axis joining the two eyes perpendicular to the direction of the down 
stroke of the pen. This latter ition brings the eyes to unequal distances from 
the letters, and, some think, is distinctly productive of optical disorders. The new 
vertical script favors an engrossing pen with no skarp lines; the pen must point 
toward the elbow, which must be held one hand’s breadth from the body; the pen 
must be.grasped at a good distance from the point, the hand supported by the side 
of the nail of the little finger. The line is only from 8 to 10 centimeters long, and 
the paper must be pushed up after each line. One writer says he can always 
tell by the position of body what script is used. One of the worst positions 
ised is one wh has been introduced in some parts of this country, that 
h its right side to the desk and the left turned away almost     
    
    
    
    
        
    
       
     
  Pee strain upon the nervous centers involved. Many of our read- 
ing books are now printed in very good type, but dictionaries, atlases, and maps are 
often wretched. Cohn, and especially Javal and Sanford (see American Journal of 
Psychology, Vol. 1, No. 3, on ‘Relative Legibility of Letters” ), have made very 
careful studies of this subject. The scientific problem is, how to secure the greatest 
amount of legibility for a given surface without interfering too much with the 
traditions of type-makers or of readers. The forms of a few Yetters, like the small 
‘e,” which has a very low degree of legibility, and is confused wi th other letters at 
the least distance from the eye, are very slightly changed, as are the common rules 
of spacing, and all with great gain to the eye. The latter moves along a line ‘with 
its focus directed to the upper r half of the letters, for in English it is in the upper 
half that the letters are chiefly distinguished from each! other. The little lines in 
letters should never be less than a quarter of a millimeter in thickness. The lower 
lengths of the ‘j” and “‘y” can be slightly shortened. The line should not exceed 
10 centimeters in length, and new rules are laid down for spacing and leading. 
I have spoken of ‘but few points connected with school hygiene, and of these in 
the most sketchy and inadequate way. The subject requires a course of lectures, 
and there is nothing in all the school courses of study that should not be considered 
from the standpoint of health. Fatigue in school work brings not only distaste, 
but habits of inaccuracy and carelessness, and thus blunts the ‘‘ school conscience” 
Burgerstein has shown by elaborate experiments and careful tabulation of the kinds 
of error made in simple arithmetical operations, based on the study of a large num- 
ber of school children, that fatigue begins far sooner than was supposed, while over- 
effort brings increased speed of work, but greatly increased number and kinds of 
error. His studies are of great importance. Lakorsky thinks that the fourth hour 
is degraded in value 33 per cent less than the first hour by fatigue. 
We know now that school children grow far more rapidly in certain years than 
they do others, and that during the stationary years they are most liable to disease. 
It is possible that we may infer that during the growing years they both catch and 
originate the most new impressions and ideas, but are most e2 asily injured by strain 
and fatigue. Again, we know that growth is greatest at certain periods of the year, 
and yet again that the body does not grow uniformly in all directions at once, but 
that the energies of growth are focused now upon hands and arms and their centers, 
now upon chest and trunk, or face or sex. Other experiments are showing us what 
are the most effective hours of the day for work. We are making progress in ob- 
taining a table of normal interests of children. Just as the hand is dwarfed if too 
great strain is thrown upon it in drawing or otherwise, before its “nascent period,” 
while it would tarive and grow strong under the same strain just after, so, if anin 
terest is forced precociously, its development is arrested,

IV. KINDERGARTENS. 
Danger in half-way measures.—State Superintendent A. S. Draper, of New York: 
The kindergarten must be allied with every public school if it is to be undertaken 
at all, and it must be closely related to the public school, becausé its influence must 
permeate every department of the public-school work. The manner in which kin- 
dergartners perform their work must influence others. The work of the kindergar- 
ten must be carried through the higher departments as well. There is great danger 
of doing this thing half way. There is the greatest danger in compromising this 
matter. My light on the subject leads me to say that one of the saddest things that 
I know of in connection with our public-school work is bringing little children from 
3 to 6 years of age into a public school and not caring for them through the agency 
of a tried and experienced kindergartner who thoroughly understands the system. 
‘The worst thing any city or State can do is to undertake this thing only half w: 
It must rest on a scientific basis or it will fail. If it rests on ascientific basis it 
accomplish its purpose, it will make headway, it will bring conviction to the minds 
of all who are related to the educational system. 2s 
Iam not at all certain but that the kindergarten is an economical instead of an 
expensive addition to our public school system. Iam sure that the average child 
who goes through the kindergarten will be at 12 years of age better educated, more 
intelligent, and a better child in every respect than is the average child at 15 yea 
who does not go through the kindergarten. I know that that child will be mor 
hearted, more in sympathy with nature, more in love with his or her fellow-beings, 
a better citizen, and a stronger man or woman at the age of 21—the average child, 
I mean—than it is possible for the average child to be without this work. “[believe 
that the kindergarten work is perfectly practical, and it will produce better results 
than any other ‘depar' tment. Indeed, I am ready to say if it were a choice between * 
the kindergarten and the high school, as to which of those branches of instruction 
should go, T say the high school ought’ to goand the kindergarten should be adopted. 
       
    
     
    The introduction of the kindergarten into Boston; how the financial difficulties were over- 
come.—Supt. Edwin P. Seaver, before the department of superintendence, National 
Educational Association: There is just one way in which the financial difficulties 
can be removed, and that is by means of an object lesson long enough continued to 
convince the people that every dollar that goes into the payment for kindergarten 
instruction is a dollar better expended than any other dollar in the whole school 
expense. That practical demonstration by means of an object lesson was given in 
my city, as is well known, by Mrs. Quinecy’A. Shaw, whose labors in behalf of the 
kindergarten are well know n, and whose generous purse enabled her to carry out 
her plan ns. About fifteen years ago an experimental kindergarten was started in 
Boston, and it flourished a little, and it dwindled a little, and then it died. But it 
did not die without a resurrection. Mrs. Shaw took that kindergarten, told the 
teachers to.go on and she would pay them. Then she added another and another, 
until in the course of ten years she had established in the city sixteen kindergartens, 
well provided with able teachers whom she had taken pains to have instruc 
kindergartners the best the country could produce. These kindergartens were e 
lished in the primary school rooms. Whenever the school board decided to in 
the number of school buildings, Mrs. Shaw got a room if she could and established 
a kindergarten. Then it came to be a serious question whether the school com- 
mittee should adopt those kindergartens from the date of their establishment in the 
city and pay the salaries and other expenses. The impression still prevails in parts 
of the city where those kindergartens have been established that they were part of 
the public school system. I well remember the surprise of some of the members of 
the common council with whom I had interviews when they were informed that 
those kindergartens had been supported wholly by private charity and not at all by 
public money, except so far as the rental of the schoolrooms was concerned. They 
didn’t know it. They thought they had been supported by the public school com- 
mittee for a number of years. When I told them that it was not so, they § said there 
should not be any more difficulty in getting the money for them. - eos 
We wanted $20,000 added to our regular school appropriation in order to adopt the 
kindergarten and pay the expense of the rooms and the material for the children; 
and, although the common council thought it was in a narrow financial condition, 
that $20,000 came as easily as a five-dollar bill would come out of Judge Draper’s 
pocket if I were short of money and wanted to get home, There has been no trouble 
in getting the money since—no difficulty at all. 
The kindergarten now is the most popular part of our educational system. The 
number of kindergartens has increased from 17 to 33. They contain a large number 
of children, and they are under the instruction of skilled kindergartners—not green 
girls who are Jearning the art at the expense of the children, but skilled hands—

those who haye received instruction for a year and a half in the normal school, and 
ahalf year’s tuition in the special instructiow necessary for the art of kindergartning. 
Now, an object lesson, if it can be established and maintained long enough, will, I 
believe, convince the people in any city that the money necessary for the kinder- 
gartens should be voted it, whether any other money is voted for school instruction 
or not, 
Story of the kindergarten in St. Louis.—W.T. Harris, ex-superintendent of St. Louis 
public schools: The first practical difficulty in introducing the kindergarten is that 
of expense. In the city schools, it it is so managed that the expense per year for 
the education of the child in the kindergarten is as much as it is in the high school, 
it is a very valid objection to the development of the kindergarten. Therefore it is 
a very important question as to how to manage it so as to get the kindergarten, and 
get itin acheap way. I want to contrast the method in Boston and Toronto, and 
St. Louis and Minneapolis. The method in Boston has been that the noblest and 
wealthiest people there have pleaded for the kindergarten. Boston is the second 
city in the United States in point of wealth, and hence the question of expense is a 
very small matter to the Boston taxpayer. That, therefore, has never been an im- 
portant matter with them. When I first saw the kindergarten, I saw it in the Bos- 
ton public school. Mr, Philbrick had gone there. The whole object of that intro- 
duction was to show that the introduction could not be made. The teacher had 
twelve pupils, and the expense amounted from $50 to $60 a year per pupil. * * * 
When the kindergartners came to me in St. Louis and said they wanted it, I heard 
their reasons. The kindergarten did not take much hold of me. They said they 
wanted to utilize play. I said it could not be a very wise man who merely wanted 
to use play. Isaid you have got to show how this play does something in building 
up intellectual character in general. On observing the kindergarten and its work, I 
thought I discovered that the kindergarten of St. Louis, instead of commencing 
with play, took the child at the transition period. It takes him through the sym- 
bolical stage of its work. It is just as important a part of education as any. We 
found in St. Louis that the children who began at 4 and 5 years of age in the pri- 
mary schools were not.as progressive as those who had been one year in the kinder- 
garten, and, what is more, that the children who came in at 7 years of age would 
have less asserted development. The kindergarten certainly brought the child out _ 
in ahealthy state of mind, and in a proper receptive condition for what comes after- 
ward. His growth was looked at in a proper manner. Now comes the financial 
experiment. First, we had large, heavy tables filling up theroom. ‘These could not 
be moved when we wanted to clear the floor for the games. We had forty children, 
and we had to have another room for these games. That was two rooms that were 
taken away from the primary schools. That, of course, caused the school boards, 
who were looking to the matter of éxpense, and the question of building more schools 
to provide for 2,000 or 3,000 children a year, to shake their heads. We had one very 
well paid teacher and director, a paid assistant, and three or four voluntary assist- 
ants. : 
It takes a great many teachers for 100 pupils. Perhaps in a primary school a 
teacher can manage 80 of those pupils, whereas in the high school a teacher can 
manage about 30, while in the kindergarten she can manage 12, or perhaps 20. We 
fixed our limit at 20 for each teacher. It became obvious that the kindergarten 
must hunt up some other form of management—of school management—and we 
discovered it in the Lancasterian system. We called #% the semi-Lancasterian sys- 
tem in St. Louis, because one of our teachers for the kindergarten was from our 
normal school. We had one very excellent teacher, one who had served for some 
years, and others who were coming to a realization of the demands of kindergarten 
work through their apprenticeship. We found by paying one good salary, and a 
smaller salary to the assistants, that we could reduce the price and the cost of the 
tuition, and get it below the price and the cost to the taxpayers of the primary school. 
We cut it down, I think, to $5.40 on the total annualexpense per capita, and I think 
another year we can cut it down to something a little less than $4. That, of course, 
was so small a price for tuition that the kindergarten had solved the problem of 
expense, and we had no trouble as to the semi-Lancasterian plan. That is to be 
recommended, for some conditions. I do not think any city can successfully intro- 
duce the kindergarten unless it looks out for the method. 
We found that the ordinary 30 by 32 room is not a proper size for the kindergarten. 
You need a larger room. We made the building 60 feet long, and we put into the 
room, instead of 75 pupils, as you have in Toronto, 150 pupils, and these were alto- 
gether the best kindergartens we had in every respect. We had a splendid teacher 
at the head of them; we had a paid assistant in them, and then we had volunteers, 
That is where we got the cheapness of our rooms. Then you can haye the place 
wherein these wonderful symbolical games and plays are brought with their tre- 
mendous spiritual effect on these children. They are the best as to the matter of

expense. With regard to forenoon and afternoon classes for the kindergarten, they 
said we could not get children to come in the afternoon. The very first week, when 
we took an expression of opinion from the parents on the subject, we found that there 
were more who preferred the afternoon kindergarten to the forenoon kindergarten ; 
and we found a good many strong and enthusiastic kindergartners who were not 
only able and competent, but willing and anxious, tomanage both. We paid them, 
if they only taught one session of the day, $4; if they taught both we paid them $7. 
That was a high salary for us for that kind of work. * * * 
Thirty thousand dollars spent for the kindergarten instruction, even if the chil- 
dren do not show any advancement in the way of knowledge when they finish their 
course, if it tells in the future when they get into the other classes—I say that 
$30,000 has been well spent, and there is a great benefit derived fromit. * * * 
The kindergarten benefits the young woman in the schools. When she is just out 
of the high school, she goes to the kindergarten and acts as an unpaid assistant for 
six months ora year. That is one of the most important parts of her education. The 
kindergarten gives her an excellent opportunity for education that will serve her 
well in later years, in the way of seeing how to manage children and working with 
them in the kindergarten. It furnishes a perpetual influence for literature and art, 
and everything that will redound to the benefit of the masses of humanity. Then 
the children themselves get this social training so impressed upon them that it never 
leaves them. They take the children from the slums in some cases and have the 
kindergartens in the street. * * * 
I hold that by making the schools strong in the community you can make that com- 
munity pay for those schools. The greatest pride of my life, in St. Louis, was in mak- 
ing the city pay for those kindergarten schools. My main pointis tomake your schools 
so strong in your community that the people will be bound to support them in any- 
thing within reason. Make the parents believe in the schools as the strongest 
instrumentality for accomplishing good and giving beneficial results in the city. 
The difficulty in St.Louis we could have settled in a minute. The people of St. 
Louis could have voted more money at any time if they had been prepared for the 
kindergarten as they should have been years before it was introduced. I say, if you 
are pinched for money, make your schools so strong and valuable in your community 
that you will compel the people of that community to support them, and generously 
support them. 
V.—_METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. 
Oral vs. text-book instruction.—William T. Harris: Oral instruction is constantly 
liable to destroy the self-activity of the pupil—that is to say, the very merit claimed 
for it is the one it least accomplishes. ‘The pupil listens to the teacher’s living 
voice. The first impressions are all he gets, even if he takes notes; it requires time 
to reflect. Our first impressions of things are never the most valuable; for all sub- 
sequent observation and reflection carry us deeper, and hence nearer to the truth. 
The pupil is dragged from one point to another without fully digesting either. But 
with a text-book it is far otherwise. The book in his hand is “all patience.” It 
waits for him to consider and reconsider a difficult passage until he is ready to go on. 
The statement in the book is a studied, carefully prepared one. The author has 
spent hours in revising and correcting the defects of the one-sided statement of the 
minute. He was bound to see all properly related and subordinated—all exhaustive 
and lucid, The deference of the pupil leads him frequently to make the mere asser- 
tion of his teacher without question or demonstration, and thus allows him to be 
warped into his teacher’s whims and idiosyncrasies; it is not so with the text-book. 
The text-book has been carefully pruned before printing. It frequently happens 
that a man would blush to say before the world on a printed page what he unblush- 
ingly preaches before his pupils. But the heat of personality departs from the 
printed page, and the scientific interest increases in proportion. Prejudice gives 
place to calm circumspection. The page of the book is cool and dispassionate, and, 
if not conclusive and thorough-going, the student has his remedy in another book. 
Multiplicity of text-books has changed one mode of instruction so that every year 
there is more consultation of reference books and comparison of different views; and 
hence still another step is gained by the pupil toward independence of mere external 
authority. He shallread and compare for himself and form his own opinions, “thus 
doing his own thinking.” * * * 
But the method of teaching? The how to study? We are continually told of the 
mere memorizing of the words of a book and of its evil effect. There are, it must 
be confessed, large numbers of teachers whose teaching is little better than the life- 
less revolution of a treadmill. Their influence in keeping the profession of teaching 
at a low grade of estimation in the community can not be counteracted. Whatever 
they do is in the style of a half-learned trade. They ‘keep school,” or the “school 
keeps them,” and know nothing outside of the book—no, not even that; they do not 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
  METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. | 1049 
know what is in the book unless it is cpened before them. Such teachers are, how- 
ever, eminent in one thing, to wit, dogmatism. They crush out every spark or orig- 
inality in their pupils to the extent of their ability. Since they do not readily 
command the respect of their pupils they endeavor to excite their fear. They are 
apt to become cowardly and cruel, oppressing the weak but obsequious toward the 
powerful. These men bring odium on the very name of pedagogue. They are 
instanced by the enemies of our system as the necessary results of text-book instruc- 
tion. It is supposed by many that these are the proper representatives of what we 
consider the true standard of pedagogy. It is supposed that the American ideal of 
teaching is found in the teacher who sits behind the desk and asks printed questions 
of the pupils, one after another, and requires the literal answer as it is printed in 
the book, no variation being allowed; that no explanation is made by the teacher, 
and no pains taken to ascertain whether the pupils understand what they repeat 
verbatim. With such a view of our system it is not surprising that Europeans have 
hitherto cared but little to look into it for a deeper and truer idea. They have sup- 
posed that all the evils would vanish at once if our teachers only adopted a different 
system—the oral method. 
A moments reflection will convince one that the treadmill teacher, who ‘reads no 
more what he teaches,” would be vastly more injurious to the pupil were he not 
tethered to a text-book. To what extremities his ignorance and dogmatism would 
lead can not be readily conceived by those who are not old enough to remember the 
oldest fashioned school of this country. Those who do remember that school have 
a vivid recollection of what dogmatism was in the days before text-books had come 
into frequent use. 
The evils of the text-book system, great as they are, are not to be compared with 
those of the oral method. Even by the memorizing plan the pupil is obliged to 
concentrate his attention and arouse himseif to hard work, while by the oral method 
he does not acquire the habit of regular systematic study, even though he may foster 
brilliant, flashy habits of mind. The true mode of teaching does not rely upon the 
memory nearly so much as the object-lesson system. The recitation is consumed in 
analyzing and proving the lesson so as to draw out all its relations and implications. 
The child shall see what it is while reading a book to have every faculty awake, 
and to notice all that is contained directly and indirectly init. After the first lesson 
the pupil does not skim over the mere surface so confidently. He knows that the 
teacher will ask more of him. He learns gradually to dive for the hidden essences, 
and reproduce from the text the whole idea which lived in the author’s mind. The 
parrot repetition is checked—the good teacher will have none of it; the nooks and 
corners must be all investigated—every possible view implied in the lesson dragged 
out and discussed before the class—and thus the pupil is transformed into a student 
who possesses the alchemy to convert dead parchment into sibylline leaves; and, by 
the spell of mental discipline, to cause the old enchanter who wrought the characters 
that conceal his thoughts in the mysterious vesture of winged-words again to stand 
before him and reveal his secret. 
    When and where shall the child study ?—From a report made by a special committee 
to City Supt. W. H. Morgan, of Cincinnati: Study is the application of the mind 
to a given subject, not, as is generally supposed, simply the committing to memory 
of alesson. We might also define study as the act of acquiring knowledge orally 
(1) through the teacher’s aid, and (2) from books or the printed page. = 
In modern education some of the old terms pertaining to study have changed their 
minds to accommodate themselves to new ideas. Lesson, which was formerly a task 
to be committed, is now a teaching exercise to draw out mind. Recitation, which was 
a repetition of memory work, is now a testing exercise for intelligence. Instruction, 
which once meant information imparted in verbal form, now signifiés the act of 
throwing just so much light on a child’s difficulties as will stimulate and enable him 
to overcome them himself. * * * 
The time for study and attention should not be too rigidly fixed, invariable or 
prolonged, especially with little children. Diversity promotes interest, and calis- i 
thenics, marching about the room with songs, and frequent change of position and 
motion, should be indulged. Time-tables are often made too supremely important. 
They should never exclude any incidental instruction arising spontaneously in the 
class and involving the moral welfare of the child. A general programme is neces- 
sary, but, as Dr. Calderwood says, ‘To measure school work for all days of the year by 
the yard measure or by the clock is to deny intelligence its fit place in the school- 
room.” Slight deviation from the time-table, for wise reasons, should not be consid- 
ered a serious offense, and may be a virtue. Teachers should not be called upon to 
certify its too strict observance, nor are study and growth promoted by so doing. * * 
The child can not study when overtaxed and overworked. Burdens impossible to 
bear are placed on children—night work, day work, after-school work, recess werk, 
 
-P-A-G-E-402
  1050 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
- drudge work all the time. The system says, as Mr. Pancks says in “ Little Dorrit,” 
“You keep me always at it; you keep somebody else always at it; there you have 
the whole duty of man in a commercial community.” In vain you say, ‘‘ quality of 
+ work, not quantity.” Judgment in assigning work seems lost. Thoroughness and 
art in doing give way before the amount to be done. More subjects than can be 
dealt with intelligently are in our schools, and yet the craze for new ones continues. 
An American child is not considered a bud to ripen and mature, but to be pulled 
and torn open by every freak of added work that hobbyhorse riders can invent. 
At many points he falls prey to ill-trained, undisciplined, and unscrupulous persons 
calling themselves teachers, who pile work on him largely for their own security and 
glorification. Use the receipt—short lessons, salient points, good method, and few 
details; season and flavor for children. Devices like concert work, reading back- 
wards, driJl books, elaborate maps, etc., retard growth. * * * 
During his school life, shall the child do most of his study, if not all of it, in the 
schoolroom? The opinion is fast gaining ground with educators that very little, if 
any, home preparation should be required of pupils. The number of hours our * 
children are under a fearful strain, the taxing character upon health of their labors, 
might well be, in itself, a sufficient answer to a demand for anything further. But 
if further reason were necessary it is found in the inadequate home life of our chil- 
dren. Few can realize in their comfortable homes the deprivation, not to say desti- 
tution, of these unfortunates who frequently present so brave and smiling a face to 
us each day, We ask for exercises with paper, pen, ink, light, fire, and all the facil- 
ities of the rich where these poor ones huddle together in one room without warmth 
and almost without food, surrounded with sickness and a babel of noise. For the 
first three, and probably for all the years of elementary grades, home preparation 
should be abandoned. In grammar and high school grades home preparation is 
necessary, but it should be preceded by a habit of study in school, beginning in 
lower classes. Nothing shows the weakness of our system more than the absence 
of a time for intelligent study in school under the guidance of the teacher. Pro- 
grammes set apart a time for everything else but this essential thing. The pupil at 
a given time must be shown how to study in the presence and by direction of the 
teacher. In what does this ‘‘how” consist? It is partly in the way to analyze the 
subject, to see its prominent points, the consecutive order of thought in it, the mean- 
ing of its language, the method of finding supplementary information, etc. There 
must be a division of classes, a time set, instruction in the way to study, and a set. 
habit of study. We have too much recitation and help and too little silent study in 
school by pupils who have been prepared for it. Let the pupil show you occasion- 
ally his way of studying to see if he has acquired any. For the first three or four 
years of school life the demand for home study should be carefully made; indeed it 
would be better in some cases to abandon it almost entirely. 
    Self-teaching the grand thing.—Rousseau: I do not at all admire explanatory dis- 
courses; young people give little attention to them, and never retain them in their 
memory. The things themselves are the best explanations. I can never enough 
repeat it that we make words of too much consequence; with our prating modes of 
education we make nothing but praters. The grand thing to be educed is self- 
teaching. Obliged to learn by himself the pupil makes use of his own reason and 
not that of others. From this continual exercise of the understanding will result a 
vigor of mind like that we give the body by labor and fatigue. Another advantage 
is we advance only in proportion to our strength. The mind, like the body, carries 
that only which it can carry. 
VI. PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
Founded for the purpose of perpetuating alicnism.—Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen, in the 
North American Review: The system of paroc schools which the Scandinavian 
Lutheran churches are endeavoring to establish is directly hostile to the settler’s 
best interests, being intended as a bulwark (and most effective one) against the 
incoming tide of Americanism. For the public scho with all their defects, have 
always served asa hopper into which all the mixed alien grain is poured to be 
ground into flonr, the general quality of which is American. Parochial schools, in 
which the teachers are of the children’s own nationality and the text-books, some- 
times in foreign tongues and always foreign in tone and sentiment, can never per- 
form this service, and are usually founded for the very purpose of perpetuating alienism 
and preventing the children of immigrants from becoming absorbed in the dominant 
nationality.       
   
The problem of sectarian-schools.—The Nation: If the recent political history of Wis- 
consin and Illinois shows that the supporters of parochial schools will fight against
-P-A-G-E-403
  ‘PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 1051 
State control, it is just as stubborn a fact that the majority of the people in the 
eountry as a whole, and in every State, will, on the other hand, oppose State aid to 
their schools, This is a fact which those Catholics who are coming more and more 
openly to demand, as a right, a part of the State school fund for their parish schools, 
may as well make up their minds they have to reckon with. They may say that it 
is all an unreasoning prejudice, but they must admit thatit isa most tangible and 
formidable prejudice, one which is certain to endure for many years to come, and to 
block any attempt they may make to secure State grants for their church schools. 
We freely admit that from their point of view there is much to be said for their con- _ 
tention that they are suffering injustice. We have read many of the addresses and 
appeals which they have put forth on the subject, and have been struck by the sin- 
cerity and thorough conviction with which they argue against being taxed to sup- 
port institutions which they regard as dangerous to the eternal welfare of their 
children. Nor are we insensible to the almost incredible and heroic self-denial with 
which they, in their poverty, have endeavored to provide, independent of the State, 
a Catholic education for their youth. But, when all is said, there is noreason to ex- 
pect that they will ever succeed in getting the State to support their schools. 
‘ Nor is there any good reason to desire that they should succeed. We believe the 
principle of entire separation of church and state to be the only wise and safe one 
for this country to adopt. If it has been violated in the interest of Protestants, 
that is a reason for putting a stop to such violation, not for encouraging another 
one in the interest of Catholics. If one sect is to get favors from the state, somust 
another, and soon all government would be nothing but a confused and endless sec- 
tarian warring. For this reason it is a matter of congratulation that an effort has 
been made to break up an alliance between the Federal Government and the denom- 
inational Indian schools. The Methodist church was the first, we believe, to pro- 
nounce against the policy of grants from the National Treasury for such schools, and 
to declare its intention of taking no more. Asimilar determination, we understand, 
was arrived at in the recent Episcopal Convention. This is most encouraging, and 
marks, we hope, a reviving sense of the fundamental place and value in our system 
of the independence of church and state. 
What, then, is to be done with the parochial schools? And is there no way by 
which the Catholics can be reconciled to the public school system? It is precisely 
because the Catholics are so tenacious of their present position, and the people so 
stubborn in defence of the system of public schools as it is, that we have considered 
Archbishop Ireland’s plan of establishing a modus vivendi between the two as really 
statesmanlike. In its application at Faribault it appears to have received a tem- 
porary check through a union between extreme Catholics and extreme Protestants, 
though this is by no means certain; the new school board may not, after all, undo 
what has been done. Certainly the plan worked well for a time, if we may believe 
what Mr. John Conway, the editor of the Catholic Northwestern Chronicle, wrote 
of it in the October Educational Review. He said: 
“Tt is sustained by a splendid public opinion in the town of Faribault itself. No 
clergymen of any denomination in that town are opposed to it; Faribault’s three 
newspapers support it; the teachers in the school like it; the parents are pleased 
with the progress made by the pupils; the members of the school board are enthusi- 
astic over the arrangement. A most intelligent member of the school board told the 
writer that the children made greater progress in secular branches during the past 
year than ever before in the same period.” 
This plan, moreover, has the immense advantage of meeting the approval of the 
propaganda at Rome. The famous decision tolerari protest is only the canonical way 
of saying ‘‘fully allowed.” It is, by implication, an acknowledgment by the Holy 
See of the right of the state to control education, while it furnishes a working basis 
of agreement between Protestants and Catholics. We can not believe so broad and 
statesmanlike a plan, with such high ecclesiastical sanction, will be allowed to fail 
for lack of further trials. It has in it the promise of satisfying both parties to the 
controversy, provided they are willing to make unimportant concessions, and of 
leading to a permanent conciliatory arrangement which will take a troublesome 
question out of public discussion. The resolutions adopted by the archbishops, 
given out on Saturday last, certainly look like a guarded endorsement of Archbishop 
dreland’s plan, and a willingness to see it extended. 
VII. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Public schools vs. boarding schools.—Scribner’s Magazine: The notion is quite preva- 
lent that it is a good thing for children to go away from home while acquiring their 
education, so that they may see the world and learn how other folks live. There is 
doubtless much to be learned in seeing the world, and we would by no means depre- 
ciate the enlargement of mind which comes by travel; but the natural place for chil- 
dren is home, and their best society that of their parents and brothers and sisters,
-P-A-G-E-404
  1052? - =. EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
The teacher of a boarding school has the double office of a teacher and parent, and 
however well he may fill the former it is impossible for him to fill the latter to the 
perfection that a parent can and often does attain. The child almost knows instinct- 
ively that the love of a parent is disinterested, that his advice is without any selfis 
motive, and that his command must be obeyed. He therefore trusts his parents with 
confidence and obeys him with a good will which he is not ready to yield to 
stranger. It is the duty, therefore, of parents to keep their sons and daughters 
“together and at home till their minds are well disciplined by study, their principles 
well established, and their habits formed, and then they can safely see the world and 
profit by the lesson it teaches. The high school enables us thus to do. The young 
men and young women graduating from our high schools find the same incentive to 
action in society that they found in the school, and do not leave behind them the 
forces which thus far have impelled them. There is no such violent change as must 
occur when one graduates from a school exclusively devoted to one sex. 
  Teaching not.a function of government.—Popular Science Monthly: To our mind it 
is perfectly plain that the modern world has not yet discovered the true method of 
grappling with the educational problem, and that sooner or later it will have to revert 
to individual responsibility and individual effort for its solution. Wedo not deny 
that relatively satisfactory results may here and there be reached under the present 
» system; but any system which to a large extent prevents the special talent that is 
available for a given task from being applied to that task is fatally defective; and 
that, as we conceive, is the case with state education. The born educators, those 
possessing by nature the aptitudes and the sympathies required for educational 
work, those who could—granted, of course, proper training—redeem such work from 
drudgery and make it a true process of thought and soul development, will not in 
general take service in state directed schools, and, at the same time, they will be 
debarred, by the competition of the state, from what would be their most congenial 
employment. Such is the dilemma; and the conclusion to which it points is that some 
day we must retrace our steps, and make education the business of the family to be 
obtained as other good things are obtained—as all best things are obtained—by effort 
and sacrifice. 
VIII. RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. 
The state competent to train youth in morals—methods.—Hon. D. L. Kichle, State 
superintendent of Minnesota: The only wise policy for the state to pursue is to 
include in the public-school curriculum whatever belongs to intelligence and morals 
and to leave to the family whatever belongs distinctively to religious instruction. 
To the objection that morals can not be taught apart from religion, it may be said 
(1) that from the religious standpoint objection has been also made against the State 
teaching many other hranches, as history, natural and mental science, on the ground 
that not to teach these subjects religiously is to teach them irreligiously ; from which it 
has been concluded that the state can not as asecular institution support and conduct 
schools without making their influence tell against religion. Without refuting 
these views in argument, the state has followed the course of a practical necessity 
and made ample provision for instruction in these branches in its schools with the 
result that the objections that appeared in theory have been very generally dissi- 
pated by the experiment, so that very few people are now found who protest against 
the propriety of the state teaching these subjects. Now, as it is more important 
that our youth should be instructed in the duties they owe to their fellow men as 
neighbors and as citizens, than that they should be taught philosophy or astronomy, 
it seems reasonable that the state should be able to discharge this duty without 
damage to other interests. 
(2) It may be further said in more direct reply to those who deny the competency 
of the state to instruct and train its youth in morals, that the source, authority, or 
basis of any law or truth necessary to the welfare of the state is not a question in 
which the state is interested, or one to be settled before the state can appropriate 
it to its own use. Neither is the state bound to deny itself the advantage of sys- 
tems of truth simply because there remain questions upon which scholars differ. 
Government in its theory and history is a subject taught by the state without 
deciding what is the origin of human government or what is the basis of its author- 
ity. The sciences of light, electricity, geology, and biology, are taught notwith- 
standing the many problems unsolved and diverse theories. The body of truth 
accepted by the entire scientific world is abundantly sufficient to meet all practical 
demands of the state. 
This principle applies with equal reason to morals. Without considering the 
question of the basis of moral obligation or who are its authoritative exponents, it 
may be assumed that, whatever the source, the world is in possession of a large
-P-A-G-E-405
  RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. > L053 
of which are beyond question, and 
ization, the state may wisely incor- body of morals, the reasonableness and authority 
these truths as the common property of our civ: 
porate in its system of instruction and practice. . 
The basis of all effectual teaching in morals must be in training as distinguished 
from formal instruction. Hence the virtues of courtesy, truthfulness, self-denial, 
and the like, must be first made known to the child by example, and be developed 
in his character through those activities that, belong to the social relations of child 
life, children with children and with their elders. That this is by far the most 
important part of the teacher’s work, and without which the memorizing of pre- 
cepts will be of little account, will not be questioned. But following and based 
upon this, these experiences should be formulated into those principles and precepts 
which will have an ever enlarging application as the child’s relations and responsi- 
bilities become more extended.    
  Literature and moral training.—Presider.t De Garmo, of Swarthmore College: Moral 
training as now practically realized in the public schools rests principally upon the 
inculcation of maxims of moral conduct and their enforcement by authority. This 
system leaves a gap which literature is well calculated to fill. Under the most rig- 
orous system of authority there is still room for much moral badness that can not 
be reached by this means. A child may, for instance, be harsh, or even cruel in his 
treatment of animals or other children. He may be greedy, surly, selfish, discon- 
tented; he may be obscene in his language, and a pollution to the whole neighbor- 
hood. The traditional minister’s son often illustrates this fact. When the child 
becomes a man he may give way to one after another of a whole catalogue of vices. 
He may, for instance, become a tyrannical husband and father, a worthless or inju- 
rious citizen, and yet from infancy to manhood never suffer seriously from the retri- 
bution of violated law. An additional danger is, that when authority is relaxed, 
the habits it has established may give way, and the child surrender to the dictates 
of a bad disposition. Thus the widow’s son may become a comfort or a heart-break- 
ing sorrow to his mother. ' 
'The chief defect in our present system seems to lie in the feebleness of its influ- 
ence upon the ideals and disposition of the child. This is in many cases left to 
accident, whereas much might be done through literature in all cases. The present 
tendency to give moral lessons from little books on ethical instruction, is an exag- 
gerated form of the old method of inculcating maxims, and must be pronounced 
inadequate. It tends to a premature, abnormal self-consciousness on the part of the 
child, and does not fill the gap that now exists. 
Now, since all moral ideals are portrayed in literature in sucha form as to attract 
the sympathetic interest of the child toward the good, and to arouse his antipathy 
to the bad, since literature is also perfectly adapted to all stages and phases of mind 
from the kindergarten to the university, treating each topic as an ethical whole, 
employing the most fascinating of flights of the Preiie ui and giving the child 
the constant opportunity of passing disinterested moral judgments upon all sorts of 
situations, it is, as it seems to me, the most perfect of existing instruments for 
developing a happy, generous, unselfish disposition in children, and for giving them 
the most true, vivid, and concrete ideals of ethical conduct.   
IX. RURAL SCHOOLS, 
Need of a uniform course of study.—State Superintendent Richard Edwards, of Ili- 
nois, speaking of the course of study recently adopted for that State: The need for some- 
thing like this course of study was very apparent. Many schools appeared to be con- 
ducted with very little system as respects the work they undertook todo. Inmany the 
change from the administration of one teacher to that of another was accompanied 
by an entire breaking up of the pupil’s record and standing. The new teacher on 
entering upon his duties at the beginning of aterm had no means of determining 
the attainments already made by the pupil whom he was to teach. They were, there- 
fore, classified at haphazard. Asa result, much time was lost; many pupils going 
over the same subject several times, and others undertaking work for which they 
were not prepared. There was a lack of continuity in their progress. These evils the 
course of study, if wisely and faithfully carried out, will overcome, the teacher at 
the close of every term being able to indicate precisely the amount accomplished by 
each pupil and the point which each has reached in his progress. The new teacher 
will only need to examine the results thus indicated by his predecessor, Of course 
some sort of record of the pupils’ attainments must be made in order that this result 
may besecured. But the means of making such a record are abundant. Several 
forms have been prepared by publishers for this purpose. 
A longer school term practicable.—Superintendent A. 8. Draper, of New York: Asa 
result of the statutes increasing the minimum length of the school year from 28 to

  32 weeks, the average length of the country schools has increased from 33.4 weeks 
in 1889 to 35.7 weeks in 1890. * * 
It will be recalled by all persons familiar with our school affairs in recent years 
that there was considerable doubt expressed, in the legislature and out of it, as to 
the wisdom of the increase in the length of the school year at the time it was made, 
It is with much satisfaction, in view y of such expressed doubts, that Iam able to 
make this gratifying showing, and to assuro the legislature that less difficulty has 
been experienced during the last year in exacting thirty- two weeks of school in the 
rural districts than was experienced in preceding years in exacting but twenty- 
eight. In view of the results it is well to consider whether or not, in.a very little 
time, the school year in the rural districts might not be safely lengthened, 50 as to 
afford as much schooling to the children in the: sparsely settled districts of the State 
as is gained by the children in the cities. I have long entertained the belief that it 
is entirely practicable to maintain schools in the rural districts for thirty-eight or 
forty weeksin the year, and that we can not hope to attain results equal to those 
secured in the cities without doing so. Nothing is of more consequence to the school 
interests of the rural districts of this State than that the old idea that there should 
be a winter school for one class of pupils and a summer school for another class of 
pupils shall be abandoned, and that all pupils up to the age of 13 or 14 shall have 
the advantage of the schools for the entire year, deducting only reasonable vaca- 
tions. 
_ _ Grading in country schools.—W. T. Harris: In my opinion there is no worse evil in 
the country schools than, the classification of pupils which is attempted in many 
States under the supposition that what has proved a good thing in the very large 
schools of cities would be beneficial if partially adopted in the small schools of the 
rural districts. Hence, while most cities classify by grades of a year’s work in the 
ease of pupil’s advanced into the third and subsequent years’ work, and by hali- 
years in the work of the lowest primary divisions, the superintendent of the county 
or State thinks that he has done a great thing if he has introduced classification into 
his rural districts to such an extent as to have three or four grades where there are 
ten grades in the city. 
The important thing to be regarded in the matter of grading is the intervals 
petween classes. If the intervals are a year, as in the grammar school, whose pupils 
are aged from 11 to 13, then it is clear that each class contains differences in qualifi- 
cation which may be as great as one year’s study would produce. In the lowest 
classes of the primary grades there would be differences of a half year. This means 
that in each class where the teacher set the lessons for the capacities of the best 
pupils, those lessons were too hard for the least advanced pupils. On the other 
hand, in the classes where the teacher adapted the lessons to the capacity of the 
least advanced pupils, the best ones would not have enough to do, but would acquire 
listless habits. If the lessons were set for the average of the class, there would be 
cases of too much work for the poorest and of too little for the most advanced. 
Now, it has been shown (and one may easily verify the fact) that a year’s interval is 
too great between classes of the age under 14, and a half year too great for pupils of 
6, 7, or 8 years, The growth of the mind is too rapid at those early periods to keep 
pupils in the same class fora year without detriment to the pupils in the two 
extremes of the class; for the best get listless or indolent, losing interest in their 
work, while the slow minds get discouraged because they are dragged along after 
brilliant rivals and lose their self-respect. This is a dreadful result, as it actually 
exists in many a school famous for its grading. 
Now, when the rural schools attempt to secure some of the benefits of the graded 
system—and these benefits are gain in time for recitations and the mutual help that 
pupils of the same grade give one another by showing different points of view of the 
Jesson—the rural schools make a system of two, three, or four grades instead of ten, 
and suppose that they have really secured some of the good which the city schools 
obtain. This is, however, only a superstition. 
If an interval of one year is too great, it is evident that an interval of two or three 
years is far worse. The entire course of study is eight or nine years in the so-called 
district school. Four grades give intervals of two years, and three grades give 
intervals of about three years. The most advanced pupils in each class are likely to be 
two years or more in advance in scholastic preparation beyond the lowest of their 
classmates. These advanced ones are kept “marking time,” while the teacher is 
laboring with the struggling dullards of the bottom of the class. These are perhaps 
not dullards except because they have the misfortune to be placed in a class with 
pupils far in advance of them 
But it is supposed by some teachers that it is possible to conduct a class of this 
kind in such a manner that the advanced pupils have enough to do while the less 
advanced do not have too much. When this problem is well solved it will be found 
   
-P-A-G-E-407
  RURAL SCHOOLS. ; 1055 
that the teacher has arrived at individual instruction or has made a minute sub- 
classification within each nominal grade. 
In the ungraded school there prevails individual, instruction with little or no 
attempt to bring together pupils in their work The numerous recitations which 
this involves give the teacher only a brief time for each. Five minutes for a gram- 
mar lesson do not admit of the discussion of the grounds and reasons or of anything 
fundamental, and the teacher is liable to resort to requiring only memory work, as 
that alone can be tested in the least time. 
But in the ungraded school there is a chance for the bright and industrious pupil 
to make good progress by aid of a good text-book without much aid fromthe teacher. 
I do not consider the evils of the ungraded school to be so great as those of the par- 
tially graded schools such as are found in Iowa, Missouri, Hlinois, Massachusetts, 
and in nearly all of the Northern States. They are stiflers of talent in most eases. 
Where the teacher is very concientious and thorough the school bears heavy on tho 
slow pupils and produces discouragement and the loss of self-respect. 
What is the remedy for this waste of the best pupils by keeping them marking 
time until they lose all interest in their work? ‘What is the remedy for this waste 
of time of the slow intellects by discouragement? 
I think that the answer to this may be found in the adoption of some form of the 
Lancasterian or monitorial system—using it sparingly and under careful supervi- 
sion. The more advanced pupils may be set to instruct the backward ones to a 
certain limited degree. However, this must not be attempted except by teachers 
who are skilful and full of resources. Otherwise the process or method will fall 
into the same ruts that the old-time system fell into. We do not wish to restore the 
“pupil-teacher system” nor see a too extensive use of the monitorial system. But- 
invention has not been exerted on this line. ‘There is unlimited opportunity for 
devices which shall employ the bright pupils in making easy steps for the backward 
pupils and in testing their progress. We have seen the evils of the Lancasterian 
system in filling the ranks with poor teachers. The modified Lancasterian system, 
which I believe useful in ungraded schools, and to take the place of the mischeivous 
system of partial grading in many village schools, demands, before all, that the 
teacher shall be better than ordinary. The mere routine teacher will not serve the 
pmrposes nor have we any use forthe apprentice teacher or the half-cultured teacher 
of any kind. 
T hope that good teachers will be found who will brave public prejudice and make 
experiments along this line. 
The graded system of rural schools of New Jersey.—Abstract of a paper read before 
the National Educational Association, department of superintendence, at Boston, 
February 23, 1893, by Addison B. Poland, State superintendent of public instruction, 
New Jersey: New Jersey enjoys the distinction of being the first State to attempt a 
systematic grading of rural schools. The experiment was first tried in Camden 
County, N. J., in the year 1872, where it has continued in operation without inter- 
ruption for twenty-one years. 
The essential features of the New Jersey system of grading rural schools are the 
following: 
(1) It is a county and not a State system. Under the New Jersey school law 
county superintendents have the power, by and with the approval of trustees, to 
prescribe a uniform course of study for their respective counties. For this reason, 
among others, a uniform State system has never been adopted. It is doubtful 
whether State uniformity in grading rural schools is any more desirable or necessary 
than State uniformity in grading city schools. The latter, so far as we know, has 
never been attempted. 
(2) It prescribes a uniform course of study, consisting in general of five grades. 
These cover the whole primary and grammer-school period of the best city schools, 
together with the first two years of the ordinary high-school course. The smaller 
number of grades (five only) is considered the fundamental and saving feature of the 
system, since it can be adapted to all classes of schools—rural, village, and city—with- 
out interfering at all with local school programmes. It affords opportunity for what- 
eyer subgrades are needed to suit the local conditions or exigencies of any district. 
It enables frequent reclassification of pupils, while reducing at the same time the 
number of daily recitations. 
(3) It provides for uniform county examinations. These are held once a year. 
The questions are prepared by the county superintendent. Examinations are con- 
ducted by the regular class teacher. The papers of the highest two or three grades, 
after being marked by the principal or class teacher, are sent to the superintendent 
or his board of examiners for review. Certificates are awarded on completion of 
each grade. The diploma of the adyanced or high school course admits to the State 
Normal School and to several colleges without a reéxamination.
-P-A-G-E-408
  1056 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
  (4) It demands certain permanent records. These greatly facilitate the reclassi- 
fication of a school by anew teacher. They enable pupils removing from one dis- 
trict to another to be more easily classified. * 
The principal evils that the system under discussion aims to reach and correct are 
the following: 
(1) The short and irregular attendance of pupils in rural schools. This evil is 
overcome in a great measure by the interest aroused. The examinations, records, 
certificates, and diplomas furnish the additional incentives that are needed to create 
this interest. 
(2) The mistakes of untrained and inexperienced teachers in classifying their 
schools. These are largely reduced under the operatic of this system. ‘Teachers 
become familiar with the county system, and on going into a new school recognize 
immediately its appropriate classification. 
(3) The large number of daily recitations. Although not the primary object, still 
it has the effect of reducing somewhat the number of classes. It establishes certain 
focal points towards which the work of all classes converges. 
(4) The lack of esprit de corps. This is one of the chief evils of the ungraded 
schools. Under this system it is no longer felt. Each district regards itself as a 
component part of a larger system. Pupils become interested to sustain the reputa- 
tion of their respective schools. 
In conclusion, Mr. Poland said that the conditions which prevail in the rural 
districts are so unlike those prevailing in cities that any a priori judgment based on 
a knowledge of the latter alone should be closely scrutinized. He fully agreed with 
Dr. Harris and others, who, in their public utterances have deprecated any action 
that would tend to engraft the hard-and-fast city system of grading upon the rural 
schools of the country. ‘ 
He claimed, moreover, that the New Jersey system by its adaptability to all local 
conditions would facilitate, rather than otherwise, the frequent reclassification of 
pupils. 
  Two views of the present status of rural schools compared with the past.—C. C. Rounds, 
principal State Normal School, Plymouth, N. H.: The problem of the rural school, 
as distinguishd from that of the city and the village school, remains essentially the 
same as fifty years ago, in large sections of our country. While important changes 
and improvements have been made in centers of population and wealth, the rural 
school, very generally, is lacking still in the essential conditions of success: a fit 
school plant (house, apparatus, library), a well-planned course of study, qualified 
teachers, an adequate length of school year, regular attendance, and efficient super- 
vision. 
While thus lacking, many towns tax themselves for schools at a rate far greater 
than do cities and towns in which all these conditions are supplied, and yet can not 
raise by taxation a sum sufitciont for their educational needs without danger of driv- 
ing away all movable capital. This lack is itself a cause of increasing difficulty, 
from the steady diminution of population and resources by the drifting away of the 
_ more intelligent families in search of better educational facilities for their children. 
The rural school has slight representation in educational congresses, and in school 
reports, mainly statistical, there israrely a presentation of the bare facts regarding 
them, a 
Hon. Andrew S. Draper, State superintendent of New York: I by no means take 
the gloomy view of the rural school problem presented by the last speaker. Of 
course, there are obstacles in the way of educational progress in the country districts, 
but no greater obstacles than are to be found in the cities. It is no more difficult to 
overcome poverty in the country than it is to withstand the influences of politics in 
the cities. Take the position that the school system is a State system, and that the 
populous centers must help the outlying districts not only as to methods but as to 
means as well, and there will be progress in the country. As a matter of fact, there 
has been great progress among the rural schools in recent years. The buildings 
have been improved, and the teaching force strengthened. Indeed, the teaching 
force in the country schools is fully up to that in the cities as a rule. A photograph. 
of the teachers in any rural county of this State would compare in appearance very 
favorably with a similar representation of a company of teachers in the cities. * * * 
It seems to me that there is no occasion for the grave apprehension about the 
future of the rural schools. Under all the circumstances, they are improving as 
rapidly as the city schools. 
Make the outlying districts large enough to bring together a considerable number 
of children in the same school; if necessary, provide for carrying children to a good. 
central school, rather than carrying a poor school to the doors of the children; make 
the supervisory district smaller and provide supervision which is efficient; regulate 
the licensing of teachers so as to protect the country schools against the imposition 
of bad work; arrange a course of procedure and systematize the work; insist upon

houses that are suitable for schools and upon appliances that are necessary for 
efficient school work, and results will be attained in the raral districts which will 
be fully up to the results attained in the cities. 
The treatment of the rural school problem by Massachusetts—Hon. George H. Martin, 
agent Massachusetts board of educution: Massachusetts has attacked the rural 
school problem from three sides—the side of teaching, the side of organization, and 
the side of supervision. 
Most of the rural schools in Massachusetts are in poor towns which have been 
depleted by the set of population toward the manufacturing and railroad centers. 
These towns, too, have suffered most from the disintegrating influence of the ancient 
school-district system. The State has come to these towns with direct financial aid 
from its school fund. At various times the mode of apportioning the income of 
this fund has been changed in the interest of the poorer towns, increasing their grant, 
and withdrawing the aid from the more wealthy municipalities.. Now, no towns 
haying a valuation in excess of $3,000,000 receive any grant. The lower the valua- 
tion the larger the State grant. With the help thus afforded, the towns can afford 
to employ better teachers and to maintain their schools for a longer term. 
The second means of improvement is by union and consolidation of schools. A 
State law authorizes towns to appropriate money for the transportation of children. 
This privilege is generously used by many towns, some spending several thousand 
dollars in transportation. Small schools are being united, and the plan of bringing 
all the children of a town to a central school is growing in favor. Several towns 
have adopted it with success. 
By this arrangement the children enjoy the advantages of graded schools, in com- 
modious and well-equipped buildings. There is found to be better attendance, bet- 
ter teaching, better discipline, and easier supervision. It is the most democratic of 
school systems, giving to all the children of the town equal school privileges. 
The third and most important work for the improvement of the rural schools is in 
securing skilled supervision. By a law passed in 1888 towns having a valuation not 
exceeding $2,500,000 may unite for the employment of a superintendent of schools. 
In this union district there must be not less than 30 nor more than 50 schools. The 
district is formed by vote of the towns, and the superintendent is chosen in joint 
conyention of the school committees of the towns. ‘This leaves the schools wholly 
in the hands of the people, and meets any possible criticism of the system as cen- 
tralizing in its tendency. To these districts the State gives direct aid for carrying 
on their work. The district must raise at least $750 for salary of superintendent. 
To this the State by grant from the treasury adds $500, making a minimum salary 
of $1,250, and $500 more to be used in paying the wages of teachers. The conditions 
of the gift are such that the towns may not reduce their own appropriations. This 
bonus has acted as a strong incentive to the towns, and 117 of them have been 
brought together into uniom districts. 
The demand has brought into the work a large number of young men, practical 
teachers, many of them with normal school or college training. 
They are steadily elevating the rural schools, not only through their influence 
with teachers, but by arousing public sentiment to a more healthy interest in the 
schools. 
Now, 200 of the 351 towns and cittes of the State, containing 77 per cent of the 
schools and 84 per cent of the children, are under supervision Ren is as truly pro- 
fessional as that of the cities has been. 
Thus, tentatively, in three ways Massachusetts is trying to solve her rural school 
problem. 
The first requisite for rural schools.—State Supt. O. E. Wells, Wisconsin: The 
first requisite is closer and more intelligent supervision. No one will question 
this who has seen the revolution made by a capable superintendent even in one briet 
term. It is often said, ‘‘ As is the teacher, so is the school.” With equal propriety 
may it be said, ‘‘As is the superintendent, so are the teachers, and consequently the 
schools.” The efficient superintendent does his most effective work not by means of 
legal enactments, but by tactful leadership. His gentlemanly bearing, his scholarly 
habits, his prudent counsel, his industry and enthusiasm create conditions and direct 
efforts in ways that laws can never reach. In order that this influence may be at its 
maximum the superintendent districts should be limited in extent. Seventy-five 
schools will afford ample scope for the best available talent. If the usual terms 
could be lengthened and the salary increased to an equality with that paid to the 
principals of the city schools, the position would attract and hold capable men. 
Women as supervisors of rural schools.—Henry Barnard: I beliove in the well-edu- 
cated female as a supervisor of schools. At my suggestion a lady took charge of 
the schools of a district in Rhode Island, and accomplished wonderful results, She

went to work with the mothers, invited them to go with her, and thus impressed 
upon them the conditions. Improvements were smiggrested, anata etc., with 
good results. At the end of the second year all the children of the district were 
gathered together, and an entertainment given. The performances would comparo 
favorably with those of Providence. 
Women-as teachers in ungraded schools.—State Supt. Henry Raab, Illinois: While I 
like to see women teach in certain departments of graded schools, I think it unwise 
both for directors to employ and for women to accept places in ungraded schools, 
While I ‘believe that women when they possess the scholarship and the necessary 
training can instruct as well as men, I doubt whether they can properly govern a 
school or exert the proper educational influence over large boys and girls. We can 
not close our eyes to.this condition of things. There are certain things which women, 
because of their sex, can not do and should not be made to do. I, for one, have 
always considered it eruel-to place an innocent girl all by herself in a country school, 
there to watch over the large boys. 
X. SCIENTIFIC ALLIANCE OF NEW YORK. 
The associations forming the Scientific Alliance of New York comprise the New 
York Acailemy of Sciences, the Torrey Botanical Club, the New York Microscopical 
Society, the Linnean Society of New York, the New York Mineralogical Club, the 
New York Mathematical Society, and the New York Section of the American Chem- 
ical Society. z 
The combined membership of these societies is over 650, and includes nearly every 
person especially interested in pure science in New York. 
The first joint meeting was héld at the American Museum of Natural History, 
November 15, 1892; the meeting ‘had for its object the public presentation of the 
needs of science in New York City and the plaxs -and purposes of the council of the 
alliance.* 
The following extracts are taken from ‘the addresses made upon ‘this occasion: 
Advantages of the Alliance'to New York City and to the Scientific Societies. 
President ‘Seth Low, of Columbia College, in discussing the advantages ‘to New 
York City of the Scientific Alliance, said: There may be, and there doubtless is, a 
vast amount of scientific knowledge and interest in this great community, but it 
must have facilities for expression before it can make itself known and ‘felt, still 
more before it-can drive the motors of scientific activity along the paths of investi- 
gation and:the large service of mankind. Naturally, the cityis not wholly devoid 
of such ‘means of expression. The museums, the universities, the colleges of the 
city, as I have said, do something to fan the flame, and Between ‘them bring into the 
city probably the largest body of men whose attention turnsnaturally to such things. 
Neither is it just to leave out of the account the constant encouragement which busi- 
ness men in New York are extending to ‘those who are:endeavoring to apply practi- 
cally the results reached inthe domain of pure science. But beyond the walls-of all 
such institutions, and outside the ranks of inventors, all through the city are:men 
whose tastes and interests incline them to scientific pursuits. All these sorts of 
men have organized themselves into various scientitic societies, each after its kind, 
to listen to and discuss scientific papers. These bodies have revealed at once 
the strength and the weakness of New York in these directions. ‘They have made 
clear beyond a doubt the vast resources of the city, both in men and means. But 
they have also revealed the fact that these resources are as yet insufficiently organ- 
sieemie orn 
The Scientific Alliance of New York ‘has ‘the capacity, I think, ‘to give to New 
York the agency which the city has long needed to develop to the utmost its scien- 
tific activities in the direction of pure science. First of all, the alliance conforms 
to that fundamental truth of modern ‘scientific thought, the unity of nature. We 
reeognize that all sciences, so called, are only branches of one all-enibracing science. 
They belong together and not apart, because they are mutually interdependent. 
But this allianee needs, for the full accomplishment of its designs, a common home 
in which the different societies shall have their headquarters, use their libraries in 
common, and make available for all the periodicals and meetings of each. Such a 
building should contain accommodations for a truly great scientific library, and a 
lecture hall:that-might be turned to account for the instruction and enlightenment 
of the public. It would naturally ‘become the place where scientific men “most   
*The council is composed of the president and two other members.of-each of the organizations, and 
has advisory powers only. ‘Zhe president of the council for 1892-93 is Charles F. Cox (Grand Central Depot); secretary and treasurer, N. L. Britton (Columbia College).

  do congregate.” With anagency of thiskind atits command, adequately supported, 
it would bo but a short time before the Scientific Alliance of New York would 
awaken in the city a veritable enthusiasm for the encouragement of scientific re- 
search. It should offer the means of publishing meritorious. papers, and it should 
fit out and maintain scientific expeditions to all parts of the globe. In this way it 
would do much to make New York a benefactor of the nations, one of the cities the 
world would not willingly let die. 
The president of the Alliance, Charles F. Cox, explained the advantages that 
would accrue from it to the societies themselves: We propose to test the energy of 
these organizations by bringing them into closer contact with the restless, eager, 
busy world about them, confident that, even if the extrinsic effects produced turn 
out to be but barely appreciable, there will still proveto be intrinsic results more than 
compensating for the efforts put forth. At least the cause of science will be honored 
by our devotion, and the pursuit of pure truth will be exalted and set before the 
people as an example of the things which moth and rust do not corrupt—as some- 
thing, therefore, in this age of business and bustle which is rather to be chosen than 
greatriches. * * * We shall find that our endeavors will inevitably produce with- 
in our societies a correlative development of vigor and productiveness by which they 
will rise to higher and higher possibilities and reach ont after nobler and nobler pur- 
poses. Each determined atte mpt we make to broaden the boundaries of learning will 
at least deepen our own appreciation of knowledge. Each serious plea we put forth 
for a higher standard of education will lengthen the rule by which we measure our 
own achievement. And thus, as Emerson says, ‘every act rewards itself.” ~*  * 
Investigators of nature’s laws are not now beset.by the same sort of enemies as 
those who harassed the truth-seekers of Columbus’s time, but you men of science 
haye none the less your foes. Strange to say, the most powerful of these are your 
opponents unconsciously. They are the average mass of men about you, wholly 
devoted to selfseeking and swallowed up in the struggle for material aggrandize- 
ment. They measure knowledge by commercial standards and have put a market 
value even upon truth. Your science, in their eyes, is worth only what it will bring 
when offered in the form of dynamos, telephones, electric lighis, dye-stuffs, mining 
machinery, and other merchantable wares. These are the real materialists—the 
worshipers of the pound weight and the foot rule. It is they who are responsible 
for the current sarcasin aimed at “theorists and doctrinaires,” though they are not 
wholiy a product of our time. * * * Although this warning is not as needful as 
it used to be, and althongh it is likely to be still less necessary as time goes on, you 
disciples of pure science should fortify yoursely es in every way possible against 
these contemners of the impractical. * * 
The saying we expect to effect is not that of material substance, but rather the 
economy of time and thought. Scattered as we are over the broad field of research, 
we require facility of intercommnnication for the sake of acquaintance with one 
another’s achievements, so that what one man has done need not be done after him. 
Life is too brief to be spent in duplicating work already accomplished, and never 
were the sciences so dependent upon one another as they are to-day. In fact, all 
investigation seems to be converging upon the philosophy of the molecule and the 
atom. * * * Its no longer possible for the various branches of learning to exist 
in scattered and isolated centers. Such an arrangement is in itself unscient 
because it is both inefficient and wasteful. What we propose to do through this 
alliance is to farnish the scientific societies of New York a common ground to stand 
upon, and eventually something thaj we may rightfully call “rapid transit” for 
thought and knowledge. We shall hope to accomplish this not simply by supplying 
one organization with information of what is done in another, and so preventing the 
profitless threshing of old straw, but mainly by bringing to light those subjects upon 
which a union of forces will produce the best results. For the immediate present, 
we shall probably find the most promising ficld for concentrated effort in the pre- 
sentation of the claims of science to the consideration of the better educated portion 
of the community, with a view to enlisting sympathy and assistance in the work of 
establishing it upon a basis comparable with that of any other of the elevating and 
refining agencies upon which our people bestow an appreciative patronage, Belig- 
ion, organized benevolence, the fine arts, literature, general education, and even 
technical training, receive generous and well-merited support and encouragement. 
* * * Much has been, or is being, done for almost every sort of philanthropic 
enterprise; but as yet pure science, the science of research, has failed to share in 
this revival of liberality. Tlustrative science we see tolerably well provided for in 
this finely equipped museum, but this objective side of science should be supple- 
mentary to the more subjective side which we represent, and the two phases of one 
division of learning should go together and receive each its proportionate degree of 
patronage and support. Although our turn maj cume last, it surely will come, and 
at no very distant day.

The Need of Endowment for Scientific Research and Publication. 
Hon. Addison Brown, president of the Torrey Botanical Club, delivered the address 
upon t this subject, the essential parts of which are as follows: 
* “To keep society as regards science in healthy play,” Tyndall says, 
“three classes of workers are necessary : 
(1) The investigator of natural truth, whose vocation it is to pursue that truth 
and extend the field of discovery for trath’s own sake, without reference to practical 
ends. (2) The teacher, to diffuse this knowledge. * * * (3) The applier of these 
principles and truths to make them availabje to the needs, the comforts, or the lux- 
uries of life. * * * These three classes ought to coexist and interact. The pop- 
ular notions of science * * * often relate, not to science strictly so-called, but 
to the application of science. 
“The great discoveries of scientifictruth,” he continues, “‘ are not made by practical 
men, and they never will be made by them; because their minds are beset by ideas 
which, though of the highest value in one point of view, are not those which stimu- 
late the original discoverer. 
“Behind all our practical applications there is a region of intellectual action to 
which practical men have rarely contributed, but from which they draw all their 
supplies. Cut them off from that region and they become eventually helpless.” 
What is true in one department of natural science is, I apprehend, equally true 
in all, 
The practical men do not work at random, but upon the basis of what scientific 
research and publication have previously put within their grasp. 
Research must pave the way for invention.—It is evident, therefore, that not only the 
advancement of knowledge itself, but all possibility of any continuous advance in 
those great improvements which are to mitigate the sorrows and promote the health, 
the conveniences, and the comforts of men, is vitally dependent upon the progress 
of scientificresearch. In recent years how marvelous have these improvements been! 
Besides those that are most common and familiar to all, what miracles almost have 
been achieved through the photograph, the spectroscope, the microscope; by the 
discovery of the sources of fermentation and of putrefaction; by the discovery of 
anesthetics and the application of antiseptic methods in surgery, and in the treat- 
ment of other lesions. These latter discoveries alone have ameliorated beyond ex- 
pression the sufferings of man; they save more lives than war and pestilence destroy, 
surpassing even that regard the safety lamp of Sir Humphrey Davy—an invention 
which, at the time it was made, was said to have exceeded every previous discovery 
as a means of saving human life, except, possibly, inoculation for smallpox. 
This vital relation between the advancement of knowledge and the welfare of man 
furnishes an all-sufficient reason for the continuous and never-ending prosecution of 
original research. Of necessity the original work of discovery must always lead; that 
must always precede the practical applications. The necessity for such research 
must, therefore, continue, so long as science and human society endure. As there is 
no limit to the advance of know ledge, so there can be no limit to the benefactions it 
is capable of conferring upon mankind. The more rapid the advance, the more 
speedy the enjoyment of its fruits. In this relation alone, the need of ample provi- 
sion for scientific progress is one that addresses itself equally to the nation, to the 
State, to philanthropists, and to all who would advance the welfare of man, on the 
broadest and most enduring lines. 
Research never self-supporling.—How shall such research be maintained and ex- 
tended? The investigator of pure science does not work for profit. His discoveries 
are not marketable. ‘The law allows no patent upon a principle of nature or the dis- 
covery of a new truth. Newton could not patent the law of gravitation, nor Volta 
the galvanism of the voltaic pile; nor Ehrenberg and Schwann, the discovery of the 
widespread influence of bacteria; nor Faraday, nor Henry, electro-magnetism; nor 
Joule, his correlation of forces; nor Jackson, his anesthetics; nor Lister, his antisep- 
tic treatment; nor Koch nor Pasteur, their discoveries of the bacilli, the destruction 
of which may lead to the cure or amelioration of terrible diseases. To the practical 
men and to the inventors, on the other hand, who apply to the specific wants of men 
the truths and principles which the scientists have made known to them, the law, in 
the form of a patent, gives a monopoly of from fourteen to twenty-one years. They 
thus obtain, as a rule, a reasonable, and, in some cases, even an excessive, pecuniary 
reward. In this country alone nearly 500,000 patents have been issued; they are 
increasing at the rate of about 25,000 per year. Intheextrememultiplica ation of pat- 
ents affecting a large part of ev erything we use, the whole world, it might almost be 
said, is paying tribute to the inventors and practical men; while to the « original dis- 
coverers Who have made so much of all this possible, there is no promise e of pecu- 
niary reward. 
This is not said by way of complaint. In the nature of things, it is searcely avoid- 
able. The aims, the motives, the methods, and the genius “of the two classes of

minds, are and ever must be widely distinct. Original discoverers can not be turned 
aside from their special work to become mechanics and inventors, without infinite 
loss. Prof. Henry had one form of the electric telegraph in actual use some years 
before Morse conceived it.! But how great would have been the loss to science, 
without any corresponding gain, had Prof. Henry in 1830 turned away from pure 
science, to do the subsequent work of Morse in adapting the telegraph to common 
and valuable use! 
Research in pure science can never be made a self-supporting pursuit. It can 
never, therefore, be carried forward broadly, and continuously, and effectively, 
except through men sustained by some form of stipend or endowment. Occasion- 
ally, it is. true, men of independent fortune, like Harvey and Darwin and Lyell and 
Agassiz, have devoted themselves to original research upon their own means, and 
have accomplished most important results. But these instances are rare. Many 
other persons, too, with aptitudes and tastes for research, though not following a 
scientific career, have carried on private researches in the intervals of leisure, stolen 
from the exacting demands of professional or business life; and these have, in the 
aggregate, added no small amount to the common stock of knowledge. 
It is no disparagement, however, of these subordinate workers to say that nearly 
all the great discoveries and nearly all great advances along the lines of knowledge 
have been achieved by men who in the main have devoted their lives to the work, 
and have been supported through institutions or endowments which made this de- 
votion possible. Government appointments, profssorial chairs, or salaried posi- 
tions in scientitic institutions of some kind, have been and must continue to be, our 
chief dependence. And it is manifest that these can only be maintained by Gov- 
ernment aid, or by the bounty of private individuals. The former is mainly the ~ 
European system; the latter, in the main, is ours. There, universities are founded 
by the Government; here, chiefly by the people. 
Facilities afforded in Gerinrany.—In Germany there are twenty-one universities main- 
tained by the Government. In each of these, as Dr. Lankester states, there are five 
independent establishments in the department of biology alone, viz: In physiology, 
anatomy, pathology, zodlogy, and botany. At the head of each’ of these establish- 
ments there is a professor, with two paid assistants, making altogether about 300 for 
biological research in Germany; and he estimates about one-quarter of that number 
in the same department in England. In all the sciences, therefore, there would 
probably be found in Germany from 800 to 1,000 persons of high scientific attain- 
ments, supported by the Government in the universities, who are regularly and 
systematically engaged in the discovery of.new scientific truth. For it is there made 
both the object and the duty of the professors of natural science to carry on orig- 
inal investigations by work in the laboratory. Their positionsare obtained through 
previous distinction in such investigations; and it is for this work that their small 
but fixed stipend is paid py the Government. 
’rance.—In the College de France, also maintained by the Government, there is the 
same requirement, though with a larger salary to the professors, and with the added 
duty imposed on them fe deliver to the students about forty lectures yearly upon 
the subjects of the professors’ researches; while in Germany the professors also re- 
ceive from each student who attends their lectures a moderate fee, which serves to 
ineréase their meager stipend, as well as to stimulate their activity and usefulness. 
Under this system Germany has become the greatest school of science, and the resort 
of the whole world. 
The present United States system.—In this country the opposite system prevails. The 
colleges and universities are mainly private foundations, dependent on private gifts 
and endowments. The colleges are unwisely multiplied. All are more or less 
eramped for money. ‘This limits the number of professors and assistants appointed 
for instruction, and crowds them with routine work. The result is that in all but a 
few colleges, and in these until comparatively recently, the duties of instruction 
have left to the professors but little time or opportunity for the prosecution of orig- 
inal investigations; and these with but poor equipment and inadequate means, 
In not one of all our colleges and universities, so far as I have been able to ascer- 
tain, is there a single professorship endowed or founded, even in part, for the avowed 
object of original seientific research. Instruction, not discovery, is the only avowed 
object. It is to the great credit of American professors and teachers that, with so 
much routine work on their hands, and so little leisure for research, they should 
have accomplished by purely voluntary studies so much as is shown in their contri- 
butions to our scientific publications. 
To what is said above, perhaps a virtual exception should be made as respects our 
astronomical observations, in which, the labors of instruction being less, original 
work has been, perhaps, expected, and has been accomplished with most signal suc- 
cess. To some extent this may possibly apply to our medical schools also. And in 
        1 Smithsonian Report, 1878, pp. 159, 262.

other departments, generally, wherever time and opportunity have been afforded, 
much original work has been done by our professors; some of it of the first class. se * : 
A new system being evolved, endowment of professorial chairs.—If experience teaches 
anything, it is that no broad and general development of scientific work of the first 
class is possible, except either through independent establishments for special work, 
or else by the university system, in which professors in science and their assistants 
are first selected on account of their previous distinction in original research, and 
are then appointed to continue that work, and in the teaching of students, to trans- 
mit to them the zeal of discovery and the true methods of advance. 
It matters little whether the support of the university or of special institutions 
* for research comes from the Government or from private endowment, provided the 
provision is adequate and constant. The difficulty with us has been, and still is, 
that funds are insufficient, the means and equipment inadequate, and the time allowed 
to the professors for research insufficient. There has been too much of the school- 
master, and too little of the real professor. Too great absorption of the professor’s 
time in the work of instruction is injurious to both teacher and pupil. The most 
stimulating of teachers ishe who by daily experiment is in vital touch with nature; 
he who brings from the fires of the laboratory the warmth, the Ulumination and the 
inspiration of his own researches. 
This is now well recognized; and, so far as their means will permit, the leading 
colleges are by degrees relieving their professors of the work of elementary instruc- 
tion, so that they may the better prosecute original researches, and at the same time 
become best qualified for the highest work of instruction. This system will, doubt- 
less, demand watchfulness and discrimination. To prevent abuses, regulation and 
responsibility may have to be imposed. But it involves the appointment of addi- 
tional instructors. It requires added means. And this is indispensable as a part of 
the transition of our leading colleges to the university system. It is indispensable, 
also, if we are to have in this country any considerable systematic prosecution of 
original research. We must use existing instrumentalities and existing institutions. 
Aud all experience shows that outside of the few Government positions, and in the 
absence of special institutions for research, the professorial chairs are best adapted 
to such investigations. No greater service could be done to science than to make 
such endowments as should insure systematic and continuous research by the pro- 
fesxors asa part of the new university system. 
Endowments for the same object, and operating in the same line, might also take 
a different form, viz, the endowment of several professorial fellowships, each say, 
of $1,000 annual income; to be controlled and awarded by some independent scien- 
tific body (such as this alliance might afford) for distinction in active scientific inves- 
tigations, either within the country or within the State. I know of no more quick- 
ening impulse to original scientific research than such as would be given to it by 
those means. 
Endowment of fellowships in science.—Immediately connected with our colleges and 
universities is another field, in which additional endowments are greatly needed, 
viz, for fellowships in science for postgraduated studies. 
Upon the postgraduate workers, the future of science and the recruits for future 
teachers and professors must necessarily depend. In that view the importance of 
post-graduate endowments in science can scarcely be magnified. The great majority 
of the young men from whom all the new recruits must be drawn have little or no 
pecuniary means, After graduating, often through many difficulties, they must 
face the question of their future calling. They must consider what promise of a 
reasonable and comfortable support a life devoted to science ‘affords. If this risk 
should not deter them, still there are many with talents of a high order who would 
be absolutely unable to proceed farther in the advanced scientific studies neces- 
sary to qualify them to enter upon remunerative scientific work, or to obtain situ- 
ations as professors or assistants, except by the aid of substantial endowments for 
their support, during the three or four years more of necessary assiduous study, 
In the stress of modern life, and in the allurements towards more certain pecuni- 
ary results, nothing but such endowments can avert the withdrawal from scientific 
pursuits of many young men of high promise, whose genius and tastes and ambition 
strongly incline them to science, and who would be secured to it if this temporary 
support were afforded. 
‘The endowments of our colleges and universities in aid of postgraduate work in 
science are much less, I suppose, than is commonly imagined. I find no such sup- 
port for postgraduate work in science, either at Cornell University, at the Univer- _ 
sity of the city of New York, at Brown University, at Amherst, or even at the Johns 
Hopkins University. No statement of the endowments of the new Clark University 
at Worcester has as yet been published. Princeton, though having a hundred under- 
graduate scholarships, has but one postgraduate fellowship for science; Yale, but 
two—the Silliman and the Sloane fellowships.

SCIENTIFIC ALLIANCE OF NEW YORK. 1063 
Columbia College has two fellowships expressly restricted to science, viz: Tho 
Tyndall fellowship of $648 annually, and the Barnard fellowship of about $500 an- 
nually. Besides these, however, twenty-four general university fellowships have 
been established, of $500 each, for postgraduate study, of which eighteen are in 
present operation. About one-third of these are assigned to science; making now 
eight for science at Columbia, with probably two more in 1893 or 1894. In architec- 
ture, moreover, there are three additional noble postgraduate fellowships at Colum- 
bia, the Schermerhorn of $1,300 annually, and the two McKim fellowships of $1,000 
each, to support study in foreign travel. In the medical department, also, there are 
five valuable prizes for proficiency. 
The University of Peunsylvania has the Tyndall fellowship, before referred to; 
and, in the department of hygiene, an admirable laboratory fitted up, by Mr. Henry 
C. Lea, with a fellowship of $10,000 endowed by Mr. Thomas A. Scott, at present 
applied to original research in bacteriology. 
At Harvard, besides the three Bullard fellowships of $5,000 each, established in 
1891, to promote original research in the medical school, there are two postgraduate 
fellowships restricted to science exclusively; namely, the Tyndall fellowship of 
about $500 annually, and the income of the recently established Joseph Lovering 
fund, the principal of which is now about $8,000. There are also eleven other gen- 
eral fellowships, viz: The Parker, the Kirkland, and the Morgan fellowships, avail- 
able for promising graduate students in any branch; of which about five have been 
usually assigned to science. These fellowships give an income of from $450 to $700 
a year. .Harvard has also forty-six scholarships available for graduate students, 
varying in income from $150 to $300 each, of which about seventeen are assigned to 
science. During the last year, according to the report of Prof. Pierce, the dean, 
there were 193 applications for those postgraduate fellowships and scholarships, 
71 of which were in science. Only one-third of the applicants could receive the 
MiGs or ee 
From the above synopsis it appears that in all these colleges (and I know of no 
other similar fellowships elsewhere) there are only about twenty-six adequately 
endowed postgraduate fellowships in science. As these should be continued for at 
least three years, there is provision altogether for only about nine per year—not one- 
fourth the number required to supply the annual loss in our 150 colleges, to say 
nothing of the increasing demand, through the growth and improvements in the 
colleges themselves. As it is from such specially trained students that the great 
professors of the future must be drawn, the need of much greater éndowments for 
new recruits is apparent. * * 
Huxley is said to have once stated that “‘any country would find it to its interest 
to spend $100,000 in first finding a Faraday and then putting him in a position where 
he could do the greatest amount of work.” 
It is the postgraduate endowments that must find and retain to science the Fara- 
days of the future. 
A notable instance of the need and value of such aid is found in the recently ap- 
pointed head of a great university, who, by such endowments alone, here and abroad, 
it is said, was enabled to prosecite his studies for ten years successively, reaching 
thereby the front rank in his chosen department of philosophy. 
Services rendered by learned societies.—Another department in great need of pecuni- 
ary support is that of the learned and scientific societies. In these England is pre- 
eminent. Our own societies have endeavored to follow, so far as they could, their 
English models. The English societies have rendered to science invaluable service 
in three main lines: 
(1) In providing ample means for the publication of scientific papers, showing the 
progress and the results of their scientific work. In this every society has taken 
art. 
{2) In the direct maintenance of original research, in which the Royal Institution 
has been most conspicuous. 
(3) In the award of prizes for scientific distinction; but still more important, in 
the distribution of pecuniary aid for the prosecution of special scientific researches. 
1 Publication of scientific papers.—Of these, I regard publication as, perhaps, the 
most important; not only because it puts the world in possession of what has been 
done by investigators, but because the very fact that there are means of publication 
is one of the greatest incitements to complete and thorough original scientific work. 
Of the English societies the Royal Society is the oldest, having been chartered in 
1662. It has published 181 volumes of transactions and about 50 volumes of proceed- 
ings. For these purposes in 1881 the expenditure was between $11,000 and $12,000. 
It has property to the value of about thirds of a million of dollars, more than half of 
which is in trust funds, held for scientific uses. The income on the trust funds in 
1891 was about $17,500.!_ In 1828 Dr, Wallaston, in giving it $10,000 in 3 per cent con-

sols ‘‘to promote scientific researches,” charged upon the society “‘ not to hoard the 
income parsimoniously, but to expend it liberally for the objects named.” 
The Royal Institution of Great Britain was founded in 1779, largely through our 
countryman, James Thompson, of Rumford, Vt., afterwards Count Rumford. In 
1888 it had property and invested funds for general purposes to the amount of 
$350,000, and about $40,000 of invested funds for the maintenance of its three pro- 
fessors. | In 1887 it expended about $2,000 in publications, and it has issued about 
40 volumes.! 
The Linnxan Society, now furnished by the Government with permanent accom- 
modations in Burlington House free of rent, was founded by Sir James E, Smith in 
1788, and is devoted ‘to botany and zodlogy. Its property amounts to about $32,000, 
but it has no endowed funds for scientific investigation. For some years past its 
receipts, mainly from contributions, have been about $10,000 a year, of which one- 
half, about $5,000, is spent on its publications, which now number nearly 50 volumes 
of transactions in quarto, and as many more of its Journal. In 1888 $7,000 were 
expended in publication.? 
Next in order of time is the British Association for the advancement of Science, 
founded in 1831. It is sustained chiefly by yearly contributions. Its invested funds 
amount to about $62,000. Its income and contributions are about $10,000 annually, 
out of which it appropriates from $6,000 to $7,000 per annum for the encouragement 
of scientific investig ms, and about $1,800 annually for its yearly volume of pro- 
ceedings. Its publications now number 55 volumes.? 
The Ray Society was founded in 1844. It was named after the Rey. John Ray, 
who lived from 1628 until 1705. Haller, himself one of the greatest scientists of his 
time, writing in 1771, in the full light of Linneus’s fame, calls Ray ‘the greatest 
botanist within the memory of man.”* The society has published about 50 volumes 
of scientific works of the highest importance. Ihave not seen any statistics con- 
cerning its means or acquisitions, nor have I found any financial report of the scien- 
tifie societies of Edinburgh or Dublin. 
2. Maintenance of original research. —Of these societies only the Royal Institution 
dir ectly supports professors for scientific research. It has two laboratories, one 
chem: and one physical. ‘These were rebuilt in 1872, ‘‘in order that original dis- 
covery might be more effectively carried on.” The society was founded for the 
declared purpose of “ promoting scientific and literary research.” It has three pro- 
fessors—one in chemistry, one in physics, and one in physiology. Davy, Faraday, 
Ty2 ndall, and others who have spent their lives there, have made its annals immortal. 
. Prizes and pecuuiary aid.—In stimulating research by the appropriation of 
Ean neys for specific objects, the Royal Society “and the British Association are the 
chief agencies. Besides some of its own funds, the Royal Society distributes an- 
nually £4,000, or $20,000, granted by the Government “for the advancement of 
science.” ‘This has been done by applying it to numerous purposes; in 1891, for 
fifty-seven different scientific objects, in sums ranging from $25 to $3,000 each, not 
confined to natural science alone, but including ethnology and magnetic surveys. 
Most of the grants were in sums of about $350 or less.5 
fhe British Association has disbursed annually for the last forty years from $6,000 
to $7,000 per annum, upon the same system of dividing it up for numerous specific 
purposes, usually from thirty to forty objects yearly, the grants being in sums rang- 
ing from $995 to $1,000. The grants are called for and expended for the specifie pur- 
pose named, and. under the direction of some prominent. scientific man. cientists 
like Sir ‘William Thompson, and others of like renown, have had the administration 
of many of these grants. These have included for the last six years, save in 1890, 
the appropriation of $500 per year for a table in the Naples Marine Laboratory.® 
We have no single society in this country, save the Smithsonian, that can rival in 
importance those ‘that I have named in England. And the Smithsonian is not a 
society, but an institution, established by one man, and he an Englishman. This 
institution, b based upon the bequest of James Smithson, was founded by act of Con- 
gress of August 10, 1846. I doubt whether in any country or in any age the bequest 
of half a million of dollars has ever been followed by such beneficent results, or has 
ever so profoundly affected the life of science, in any country as the Smithsonian 
Institution has done in America during the last forty-four years of its existence. 
This has been owing (1) to the wisdom and the profound scientific insight of Prof. 
Henry, its first secretary and director; and (2) to the corps of able assistants and 
successors whom his spirit and policy have inspired. Its publications number 26 
quarto volumes of Contributions to Knowledge, 40 volumes of Miscellaneous Col- 
lections, and 44 volumes of Annual Reports. Its Contributions to Knowledge rival, 
if they do not excel, in rarity and importance the publications of any other society 
during the same period. Its expenditure in publications is about $12,500 a year.

  Jnder Prof. Henry a good deal was done in research. Under Prof. Langley, the 
present director, astrophysical research is carried on. Besides the direct scientific 
work of the institution, however, its influence has been very great, especially in its 
relations with the other departments at Washington, and as a i medium for thé prose- 
cution of other scientific enterprises under authority of Congress. Many of the 
appropriations of Congress for scientific expeditions for researches in ethnology, 
paleontology, chemistry, and physics have been due to the presence and codpera- 
tion of the Smithsonian Institution. For ethnologic researches alone during the 
last twelve years, under the administration of the Smithsonian, Congress has appro- 
priated $400,000; to paleontologic researches within the last threo years, $160,000; 
es chemical and phy: sical research, $68,000; and to astrophysical research, $10, 000. 
Besides these, there have been for many years appropriations for maintaining the 
important investigations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of the Weather 
Bureau in Meteorology; and for the great scientific work of the Naval Observatory, 
and of the various scientific divisions of the Agricultural Department and of the 
Geological Survey. Our Government has been by no means inactive in science. 
The principal American scientific associations, omitting those of comparatively 
recent origin, are the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, originally 
founded in 1744; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boston; the Bos- 
ton Society of Natural History; the Academy of Natural Sciences, and the Franklin 
Institute at Philadelphia, the latter founded in 1824 (see Journal, vol. 1, pp. 71, 
129); the New York Academy of Sciences (a continuation of the Lyceum of Nat. 
ural History); the National Academy of Science at Washington, founded in 1863; 
and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Of these the Phil- 
osophical Society has published 29 volumes of its transactions; the American 
Academy, 26 volumes of transactions and 9 quarto volumes of memoirs; the Bos- 
ton Society of Natural History, 25 volumes, at a cost of about $600 per year; the 
Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, 48 volumes of proceedings and 12 quarto 
volumes of its Journal, at an average cost of about $1,000 per year; the Franklin In- 
stitute, 133 volumes of its Journal; the New York Academy and its predecessor, about 
30 volumes of Transactions and ‘Annals; the National Academy, 3 quarto volumes of 
Memoirs and some volumes of proceedings; and the American Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science, about 40 volumes of proceedings. 
The latter society had in 1891 a ‘‘ Research Fund” of $5,254. (Proceedings 1891, 
p. 441.) None of the other societies, so far as I can find, has any fund specially de- 
voted to research or makes any specific appropriations therefor. The National Acad- 
emy and the Academy of Philadelphia have each some funds for their support, and 
the latter also the Jessup fund for students in science on which the income is about 
$950 yearly. The Philosophical Society from time to time awards the prize estah- 
lished by John Hyacinth de Magellan in 1786, an oval gold plate, ‘‘for the most use- 
ful discovery or invention in navigation or science.” One of the earliest. awards of 
this prize was for painting lightning rods with black lead. 
‘The American Academy of Arts and Sciences awards a gold and silver medal from 
a bequest of $5,000, made to it by Count Rumford, who in 1796 made a similar bequest 
to the Royal Society. In 1888 this prize was most worthily awarded to Prof. Michel- 
son, for his researches in light.! 
The Boston Society of Natural History has a general fund, of which, the income is 
about $6,000. It has also a small Walker prize fund anda ‘grand prize fund, from 
which in 1884 it awarded a grand prize of $1,000 to James Hall, of Albany, “for his 
distinguished services to science.” Italso administers the expenditure of about $2,700 
ayear for instruction in laboratory work drawn from the Boston University and $1,500 
from the Loweli fund for the instruction of teachers.? z 
From this comparison of the voluntary associations it appears that the property, 
endowed funds, and equipment of the English societies named are nearly tenfold 
greater than the American, and their publications double; while for direct original 
research our socicties maintain ‘no laboratories and no professors, as is done by the 
Royal Institution. The English societies distribute yearly from $25,000 to $30,000 for 
from sixty to seventy-five different scientific purposes, while ours make no such ap- 
propriations simply because they have no funds. To supply this deficiency there is 
need of large endowements. 
Need of a publication fund.—The publications of our societies are valuable; the 
papers have often been of a high character, rivaling those published abroad. But 
the funds available for publication are insufficient; it is always a question of means. 
There is a press and surplus of valuable scientific matter, which either is not 
printed at all or only gets printed by special subscriptions for the purpose. This 
ought not to be. After valuable original matter has been produced with great 
pains and without hope of pecuniary reward, nothing is more discouraging to future 
research than that even publication can only be had asa charity. This I know, 
from repeated personal applications, is the condition of things in New York at this

moment. It is not creditable that in a State and country like ours there should be 
practically nowhere any adequate provision for even the publication of the re- 
searches of those who work for nothing but their love of science and its progress. 
There is very great need of a considerable publication fund, in the hands of some 
scientific body, through which every valuable contribution to science, not otherwise 
provided for, might be ensured a speedy publication, after it had been found worthy, 
as in the practice of the Linnean Society, first by a critical expert in the particular 
department, and then by the Council of Publication.' 
The stimuius, moreover, to scientific research that would be imparted by the dis- 
tribution of comparatively small sums, sueh as are given by the Royal Society and 
by the british Association, would also be very great; nor is there any reason why 
the founding of professorships for the express purpose of prosecuting original 
research in our scientific societies, after the model of the Royal Institution, should 
not in time be followed by results equally brilliant and equally beneficial to man- 
kind. 
I have endeavored to point out three main directions in which there is urgent need 
in this country of pecuniary endowments, 
(1) In the relief of professors during the transition of the colleges from the 
schoolmaster system to the university system, whereby all professors in science 
shall become actively enlisted in the prosecution of original discovery as a part of 
their duties. 
(2) In providing for the fature recruits in science, by more endowments for post- 
graduate study. 
(3) By endowments of our scientific associations, both directly to promote origi- 
nal research and especially also to supply larger means of publication. * * * 
Our reliance in this country must be mainly upon private endowments and an in- 
telligent appreciation of the needs of science. ‘The National Government has done, 
and is doing, much in certain directions. But aside from the dispositions of legisla- 
tors, it is restricted by the provisions of the Federal Constitution, and by debated 
questions of constitutional right. State aid is not thus hampered; but state aid is 
difficult to obtain, to any adequate degree, on account of the previous habits, preju- 
' dices, and political training of the people. No doubt this ought not so to be. The 
state of New York ought, abstractly considered, to maintain one university of the 
first class equal in every department to any in the world. But the multiplication 
of institutions already existing, ‘local jealousies, and aversion to state taxation, 
make this now probably impracticable. 
The remedy is with the people, and through their own voluntary methods. It is 
the people who have made our Government, its institutions, its methods, and the 
great aggregate, whatsoever it is, such as we see it to-day. Wealth is rapidly 
accumulating; much of it in the hands of those who, springing from the people, 
bear the love of the community in their hearts; and when they and the people at 
large shall come to see that the cause of scientific advance and the discovery of all 
new truth are in the deepest sense their cause, responses will, I believe, come to 
every urgent need; until the work of the people, by its own methods, shall, even in 
science, be able to confront, without shame, the best work of the monarchies of the 
Old World. 
Address of Prof. H. Carrington Bolton on A Plea for a Library of Science in New York City. 
In science, as in other departments of modern thought and research, progress 
moves along two distinct lines apparently antagonistic, but, as may be easily shown, 
they are mutually helpful; these are a tendency to specialization and a growth in 
generalization. As each department of physical and natural science develops with 
prodigious rapidity, and becomes too comprehensive for the grasp of an individual 
mind, it becomes subdivided into branches dealing with a limited range of subjects, 
and, as these subdivisions continue to grow, further specialization necessarily 
ensues. This is a familiar truth, requiring no illustration beyond reference to the 
existence of seven independent societies in this Alliance, the younger members of 
which are limited to single branches of research. Parallel with this development 
of specialization, there is marked progress in the direction of codrdination and inter- 
dependence. Even in the departments of investigation seemingly far removed from 
each other, how frequently discoveries and inventions unexpectedly open up com- 
mon features. A chemist aided by a physicist, examining in a darkened room the 
flame-colors of terrestrial substances, suddenly hand over to the astronomer an in- 
strument of precision surpassing the combined powers of the telescope and the 
microscope in revealing the secrets of celestial bodies. A solar-physicist, directing 
his sensitive bolometer to the radiant energy proceeding from a tiny insect, presents 
to the biologist new and remarkable facts otherwise unattainable. What two sci-

  SCIENTIFIC ALLIANCE OF NEW YORK. 1067 
ences seemed less likely to be linked for a man’s benefit than acoustics and elec- 
tricity? To what realm of nature is the microscope limited? To further multiply 
illustrations is needless; a moment’s reflection shows theoretical points of contact 
between every one of the exact sciences which are realized in practical applications 
resulting from their coi ination. 
This linking of specialization and generalization finds its highest exemplification 
in a library, particularly in one consecrated to pure and applied science. One of 
the objects sought by the promoters of this alliance of the principal scientific soci- 
ties of New York city is the assembling under one roof of their scattered collections 
of books. This does not mean amalgamation in any degree, nor even confedera- 
tion; this is practically impossible, for several of the societies are incorporated and 
can nob surrender rights in their property. The plan, as I understand it, leaves to 
each society complete control of its own liberty, and merely provides for codpera- 
tion, each supplementing that which is lacking in the others. Before considering 
the advantages which would certainly follow such affiliation, let us briefly note the 
statistics of each society, considering them in order of their foundation. 
(1) The New York Academy of Sciences, founded in 1817, has a library of nearly 
10;000 volumes and bound pamphlets, temporarily deposited in the library building 
of Columbia College, by courtesy of the trustees. It is not amalgamated with the 
great library of the college, having separate rooms and an independent catalogue. 
The collection is almost exclusively scientific, and is valuable for its sets of Trans- 
actions of learned societies throughout the world, obtained by exchange for the pub- 
lications of the Academy. Many of these early serials are not found elsewhere in 
the city, and some nowhere in the United States. 
The library is, of course, free to members under the by-laws, and to readers in the 
college library by special arrangement. The library is in very good condition, 
which, however, would be improved by expending a few hundred dollars in binding. 
The Academy was so unfortunate as to lose its collections in natural history by fire 
in 1866, but the library was stored elsewhere, and has now reached the respectable 
age of 75 years, being the fifth in order of foundation in New York city. 
(2) The Torrey Botanical Club, founded in 1871, has no independent library, its 
collection being incorporated with the library of Columbia College. The Univer- 
sity Bulletin for July, 1892, records the securing of a fund of $1,000 for the purchase 
of books for the Botanical Library, a fund contributed by ten persons. While this 
is creditable it shows how pressing the need is for botanical literature, and the club 
might perhaps be persuaded to administer a much larger sum. 
(3) The New York Microscopical Society, founded in 1877, is incorporated under 
the state laws. It has a library of about 1,500 volumes, but it is at present difficult 
of access to members owing to cramped and inconvenient quarters; hence it is but 
little used. 
(4) The Linnean Society of New York, organized in 1878, not incorporated, has 
the nucleus of a library deposited in the American Museum of Natural History, Cen- 
tral Park. 
The collection consists chiefly of serials obtained by exchange, and of Govern- 
ment publications. 
(5) The New York Mineralogical Club, organized in 1877, not incorporated, has no 
library. It owns, however, the B.B. Chamberlain Collection of New York Island 
Minerals, and other local specimens deposited in the American Museum of Natural 
History. 
(6) The New York Mathematical Society, organized in 1888, not incorporated, 
owns a collection of about 300’ volumes, now temporarily deposited in the mathe- 
matical department of Columbia College. 
(7). The New York section of the American Chemical Society is the youngest child 
in this family, having been organized in the spring of 1892. The parent society, 
however, was founded in 1878, and has accumulated a library of 1,900 volumes and 
500 pamphlets, now deposited in the building of the University of the City of New 
York. It is, of course, open to members and those using the university library. 
These collections, brought together under one roof, would form the nucleus of 
a valuable scientific library. The weakness of some is due to youth; all, however, 
reflect the struggle for existence that pure science has sustained in this commercial 
city. The advantages that would flow from affiliation are so obvious as to make 
rehearsal almost superfluous. First, however, is the advantage of economy in ad- 
ministration, and, by avoiding duplication, securing greater results with less 
expenditure. Secondly, uniformity in disposition of the books, and improvements 
in cataloguing. And be it noted that the utility of a library is in proportion to the 
perfection of its catalogue; other things being equal, a small collection being fur- 
nished with full author and subject catalogues is decidedly more valuable than a 
library of far greater magnitude which is incompletely catalogued. Such an as- 
semblage of books, with the growth that would be stimulated by the new régime,      
   
-P-A-G-E-420
  1068 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
would form the foundation of a great bibliotheca sciertia, such as nowhere exists in 
our New World. Due appreciation of the creditable standing of several libraries 
in New York and vicinity is consistent with the statement that a scientific library 
is a great want. For general reference the Astor will long remain pre-eminent; 
Columbia College Library is growing rapidly, and its liberal regulations and fine 
appointments are a delight to scholars; the Lenox has a noble collection of treas- 
ures limited to a narrow field; the physicians, lawyers, and engineers are forming 
for themselves specialized collections of great value; the Free Circulating Library 
and many subscription libraries cater to the popular taste; but where shall investi- 
gators in the exact sciences go with an assurance of finding all desirable treatises, 
seriais and special monographs? 
Another advantage of affiliation must be briefly noted. One of the best ways of 
building up a library symmetrically is to place the selection of books in the hands 
of workers in the several branches of knowledge. This is recognized in some col- 
leges, where each member of the faculty compiles lists of works needed in his special 
field. In the associated libraries each society would naturally foster its immediate 
interests, and Jacune could be filled by the care of the librarian in chief. 
It is, perhaps, premature to consider the question of organization of the Library 
of the Scientific Alliance, but I would suggest that at first the librarians of the sev- 
eral societies might form a board and by frequent consultation secure uniformity in 
methods. Later in the development of the library a librarian-in-chief might be 
appointed to have general oversight of the whole, especially to see that gaps in the 
literature of science, not filled by the societies themselves, be closed by purchase, 
For, of course, the library of the Scientific Alliance must have an endowment, and 
one worthy of this great metropolis. 
The benefits that a library of pure and applied science would confer on the city are 
manifold. It would become the headquarters of those engaged in pure research, as 
well as of inventors and others seeking data as to the applications of science. To 
patent lawyers such a library would be invaluable. If the alliance be successful in 
securing a convenient site and a building of sufficient magnitude, I suggest further 
that rooms of moderate dimensions be provided for rental to private collectors of 
books for their personal treasures. Many persons of moderate means find the ques- 
tion of shelf-room a more troublesome one than the acquisition of books, and buy 
more sparingly for this very reason. They would be glad, however, to place their 
collections in a fireproof building contiguous to kindred or supplemental collections, 
and, maintaining their control of their private libraries, would willingly grant to 
scholars access to the same for consultation and serious research. Such temporary 
deposits might eventually become the property of the alliance, either by gift or tes- 
tamentary bequest. 
The alliance is moreover likely to add to its membership other societies pursuing 
special branches of science, and this growth must be anticipated in planning for 
the future. . 
The associated libraries of the Scientific Alliance, gathered in a suitable building 
furnished with committee rooms, lecture-hall, etc., would form for those engaged 
in scientific research a sort of exchange. Commercial and financial enterprises have 
established produce exchanges, metal exchanges, stock exchanges, and the like, and 
why should not science have its own exchange? Though the commercial aspect is 
far oved from the thoughts of those advocating this alliance, Isee no reason why 
the building sheltering the libraries should not be headquarters for those seeking 
advice from scientific men on industrial problems. 
Comparisons are said to be odious; therefore I refrain from pointing out how much 
behindhand New York City is compared with Boston, Philadelphia, and San Fran- 
cisco in the matter of accommodation for scientists. 
To ascertain the status of science in the existing libraries of New York and vicin- 
ity, I sent to sixty-eight of the principal libraries and institutions of learning circu- 
“lars making inquiry as to the number of volumes in each, the proportion of scientific 
works, and the number of scientific readers using the library. With few exceptions 
replies were received with gratifying promptness and accuracy. Eight libraries 
have not been heard from. The statistics obtained are embodied in the appendix to 
this paper, and we give here but a brief summary. 
The sixty libraries reporting have an aggregate of 1,916,000 volumes. There are 
fifteen libraries of over 40,000 volumes each. The proportion of scientific books 
varies from 5 per cent to 100 per cent, according to the scope and aim of the institu- 
tion. In the larger libraries of reference the proportion runs from one-quarter to 
one-twentieth. As the term science is differently interpreted by librarians, some 
restricting it to pure science and others embracing the applications, biography of 
scientific men, and the useful arts, no attempt has been made to estimate the total 
number of volumes that are properly classed as scientific. As but few libraries 
report the number of scientific readers, this item remains practically undetermined.

In one class of institutions a great weakness was developed by this inquiry; with 
a single exception medical colleges report ‘‘no library.” Surely in no other course 
of study i is a knowledge of literature of the subject deemed superfluous. The excep- 
tion referred to is the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary, which 
has a collection of 556 volumes, forming a small reference library for the students. | 
This was founded in 1887 by-.the liberality of Sarah M. Hitchcock, and is growing 
annually by subscriptions and donations. * *

  TEACHERS. _ 1075 
XI. TEACHERS. 
The Patterson (New Jersey) plan of raising the standard of the teaching force.—The 
school board of Paterson (Nicholas Murray Butler, president) adopted, September 
16, 1892, the following report presented by their committee of education: 
‘The committee on education have given careful consideration to the improvement 
of the efficiency of the present teaching force; since it is obvious that no course of 
study, however excellent, no new text books, however approved, and no new 
methods of teaching, however justified, can of themselves, and apart from intelli- 
gent teaching, raise the standard of the public school. It is obvious that any just 
plan of distinguishing between the many teachers who are efficient, and the few 
who are wholly or in part inefficient, must be general and impersonal, and must be 
carried out without either favor or prejudice. We have agreed upon such a plan 
and present it herewith to the commissioners with the recommendation that it be 
adopted, and the superintendent directed to carry it into effect at once: 
The certificates of all principals and teachers, having been issued to hold good 
during the pleasure of the commissioners of public instruction, to be terminated on 
June 30, 1893. 
Meanwhile the prisicipals and teachers are to be classified as below stated, the 
basis of the classification being: First, the records of the past three years now on 
file in the office of the superintendent, and secondly, a special report to be prepared 
for the purpose and completed by December 1, 1892. The teachers are to be re- 
ported on by the several principals and the superintendent; the principals are to 
be reported on by the superintendent alone. 
(A) Those who are satisfactory, both as toscholarship and as to power of discipline, 
management, and teaching efficiency. The certificates of all principals and teachers 
in Class A to be renewed without further formality from July 1, 1893. 
(B) Those whose scholarship is unsatisfactory. The certificates of all principals 
and teachers in Class B to be renewed from September 1, 1893, only in the case of 
those who pass a satisfactory examination, said examination to be held between July 
1and September 1, 1893. 
(C) Those whose power of discipline and management is unsatisfactory and who 
are lacking in general efficiency. The certificates of all principals and teachers in 
Class C to be renewed from September 1, 1893, only in the case of those who give 
evidence satisfactory to the superintendent during the present school year, of their 
ability and willingness to make good their deficiencies. 
(D) Those who are unsatisfactory both as scholarship and as to power of discip- 
line, management, and general teaching efficiency, The certificates of all principals 
and teachers in Class D will not be renewed. z 
Grading salaries according to success in teaching.—Supt. O. M. Brands, of Paterson, N. 
J.: Salaries are graded (in Paterson) after a period of probation, according to suc- 
cess in teaching. The question here arises, what shall become of such teachers as 
fail to obtain a recommendation—whose efficiency and success will not warrant con- 
scientious approval? It is true that the salary of such teacher would remain at the 
minimum—would not be increased; but ifsome teachers are indeed so inefficient, so 
unsuccessful, as not to merit the increase of salary thus provided, will their services 
to the school be more effective, more valuable, at the minimum salary? Would not 
the service of any such be dear at any price, no matterhowsmall? In short, would 
their services be desirable at all in positions in which they are unsuccessful? To 
the latter question the emphatic ‘‘No” must be accepted as the correct answer. 
Somebody disposes of the main question in the following words: “ Grading salaries 
according to success in teaching is usually a failure, and beards of education should 
thoreughly understand what they are doing befere undertaking the experiment. 
Hither a teacher is or is not qualified to teach. Of course not all have equal abili- 
ties; this can not be expected; but all teachers must eat and be clothed; the best as 
well as the poorest. If it is found after sufficient time that any teacher is indifferent 
in teaching, and inferior in government, let him (or her) be dropped and another 
put in his place; but if he is retained it would seem to be reasonable that he should 
have as good pay as others who have taught aslongas he. Teaching ability can not 
be improved by cutting down salaries. It should be cither encouragement and im- 
provement or dismissal.” 
Wherein the strength of great teachers lay.—The Christian Union: Teachers: of all 
kinds whether with the voice, the pen, or the platform, or in the press, are peculiarly 
exposed to two perils; a tendency to routine and to loss of interest and enthusiasm. 
The fight which a teacher is compelled to wage against the influence of his surround- 
ings and his profession, is a fight for life; for that which he loves when he parts with 
his vitality and becomes the victim of routine is life. The great teachers have not, 
as a rule, been men of the very highest scholarship. Theirscholarship has been ade-  
-P-A-G-E-428
        LOGG EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
quate, but their strength has lain, in a certain quality, difficult to define, but as dif- 
fusive as the atmosphere, and passing in a vital current from teacher to pupil. Thomas 
Arnold in England, and Mark H n America, although both men of eminent in- 
tellectual attainments, derived their strength as teachers from this personal quality. 
That which they gave primarily and distinctively, was not information, but life. 
Intellectual life is begotten, not by scholarship, but by life. The supreme quality, 
therefore, in any teacher, is this life-giving quality, this power, not only of impart- 
ing information and giving instraction, but of conveying that vital impulse which 
clothes the dead fact with the color and quality of life. It is the absence or loss of 
this quality which condemns many teachers to a cheerless, arid, routine life, without 
inspiration for their pupils and without satisfaction to themselves. A teacher needs 
constant contact with large inspiring ideas to offset the pressure of details.      
Special schools of pedagogy not required.The Nation: Among the professional 
schools which Chicago hopes to establish, we find not only schools of law, medicine, 
fine arts, and engineering, but also a ‘school of pedagogys.” There are precedents 
for the institution of such a school, but we are nevertheless of the opinion that it is 
unnecessary. In no scheme for training teachers is the intending pedagogue taught . 
simply how to teach; he is taught things to teach as well. But the things he is to 
teach are best taught him in the regular university courses. Give such a student 
free access to the coursesin philosophy, philology, literature, history, political science, 
mathematics, and natural science, and all that he can ask from the university in 
addition is instruction in the history and theory ofteaching. Forthis purpose proper 
courses in pedagogies are sufficient; a special professional school is not required. 
Slight confidence in pedagogy.—President Eliot, of Harvard University: The faculty 
(of Harvard) in common with most teachers in England and the United States, feel 
but slight interest or confidence in what is ordinarily called pedagogy; but they 
believe that skillful teachers should be able to give some account of their methods 
for the benefit of those who are beginning to teach; or, in other words, that experi- 
enced teachers can advantageously convey to beginnerssome of the results of their 
experience. -The faculty believe, however, that this work, to be profitable, must be 
departmental; that the accomplished teacher of Latin must show how to teach 
Latin; the accomplished teacher of chemistry, how to teach chemistry, and so forth; 
or, at least, that there must be separate teaching of the several methods applicable 
in the principal groups of subjects—languages, history, science, and mathematics, 
XII. TOWNSHIP SYSTEM. 
Results in New Hampshire.—Since 1885 the average annual length of the schools of 
New Hampshire has increased nineteen days, or about one month. This increase is 
attributed by State Superintendent Patterson to the introduction of the town system. 
There seems to be no question, says Mr. Patterson,! that this system, “adopted 
five years since, is greatly superior to that which it supplanted. In some instances 
it resulted at first in temporary personal inconveniences, but these are gradually 
being adjusted and a disposition to acquiesce in what seems for the public good is 
now prevalent. Of course it is too early to expect complete unanimity, but it isa 
source of great satisfaction that the superior merits of the system have been so gen- 
erally recognized, and that the period of doubt and controversy has passed so that 
we may at last unite in developing all the possibilities for improvement which the 
system affords. That there would be differences of opinion and heated discussion 
during the transition from the old to the new system was anticipated and inevitable. 
Changes of custom or policy always encounter such opposition. Besides, there was 
something to be said on both sides, and your superintendent, fully aware of the per- 
sonal labor and misunderstanding it would occasion, gave himself reluctantly to the 
advocacy and defense of the change only when convinced that it was his duty to do 
so.in view of the advantages it would bring to the State. A perusal of the reports 
for three or four years previous to 1885 will show that the measure was not entered 
upon without much reflection and a thorongh canvassing of the whole subject. 
Neyer for a moment have I doubted the wisdom of this law or of its ultimate success, 
for if we can gain time for prejudice and partisanship to subside the majority will 
usually support the right.”   
Maine.2—For more than twenty years the law has given to the towns of Maine the 
power to reform their school systems by the abolition of school districts. 
  
1 New Hampshire School Report, 1890-91, pp. 266-268. 
2Tn the Maine School Reports 1890, pp. 15-36, Supt. Luce makes an able and exhaustive argument in favor of the immediate compulsory abolishment of all school districts. In the appendix of the 
same SenGes, pp. 103-108, Principal A. i". Richardson, of the Castine Normal school, has a paper on the 
same subject  
-P-A-G-E-429
  TOWNSHIP SYSTEM. 1077 
Yet with all the discussion that has been had in relation thereto, and with all the 
efforts put forth by those who have recognized the pressing need of such reform, up 
to 1890, only 127 out of 502 towns had adopted the town system, or organized without 
district divisions. In 1891 the number had increased to 142. 
The experience of the towns which have adopted the town system, Supt. Luce 
says, ‘‘is in line with that of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Freed from the 
[district] system and its attendant ills, their schools have begun at once to move up 
to a higher efficiency. Indeed, somarked and immediate is the change for the better, 
that in twenty years in this State but four towns having completed the process of 
abolition, have ever returned to the old way of school management.” 
Supt. Luce is very emphatic in his declaration that the town system is adopted 
to all localities and classes of schools. ‘‘ While many persons,” says he, ‘hold to 
the theory that the unit or town system of school management is a good thing 
for the schools in some towns but not in all, that for purely rural and sparsely settled 
towns the district system is preferable, yet such theory is not backed by actual 
experience. There is no class of towns in the State that have not their like among 
the 142 towns whose schools are now managed under the town system; and among 
these towns there is not one, how rural and sparsely settled soever it may be, whose 
schools are not on the whole better and in the way of more rapid improvement than 
those in similar towns still adhering to the district system.”! 
In New York.2—For many years there has been a continued effort to present the 
advantages of the township system of schools to the attention of the people of the 
State. State Supt. Gilmour in 1877 recommended an immediate change from the 
district to the township system. Strong opposition developed to a change so radi- 
cal, and the same superintendent in 1880 proposed as an alternative a gradual change, 
making the adoption of the township system optional with the towns. Increased 
attention has been manifested in the subject during late years, which is due in a 
great degree to the thorough discussion and unanimous action of the New York 
State Association of School Commissioners and Superintendents. 
A bill was introduced into the legislature in 1890 and was referred to the commit- 
tee on public education, where it was allowed to remain rather than incur defeat 
through a misunderstanding of its provisions. 
State Supt. Draper gives his views as follows: ‘‘I have no hesitation in saying 
that it is my belief that if the township system of schools were once in operation it 
would greatly promote the efficiency, as it would more equitably distribute the cost 
of our rural schools. Whether the change would not overthrow existing relations 
and conditions, in other respects, to an extent which will render it impracticable of 
attainment is open to doubt. It is a subject of much importance, which is earnestly 
advocated by the best friends of the school system, and I bespeak for it the most 
thoughtful consideration of the legislature.” 
South Dakota divided.*—The schools of South Dakota were originally organized 
upon the district plan. “In 1883 the township plan was adopted, and nearly all the 
counties.came under its provisions. There were some so strongly wedded to the old 
system that they were excepted from the provisions of the law requiring the town- 
ship to be the unit of school affairs. Thus was inaugurated for the Territory a double- 
headed system which continues to-day in this State.- In 1887 the law was materially 
modified and the tendency of this law was toward the district system, but yet retain- 
ing the township organization. The bill for this act was one containing many new 
ideas looking toward the harmonizing of all the educational work of the Territory 
and reducing it to a very thorough system, but, like all compromises, it was weak in 
some points, and the alterations made by the legislature before it finally passed ren- 
dered it less complete and harmonious than in its original form, This is the present 
law of the State, and while it has some excellent features it needs modification in im- 
portant particulars. This law has been known as a township law and all its faults 
have been charged up to the township system of organization. Upon this, oppo- 
nents of the township system have based their arguments for a return to the district 
plan. There are now eleven counties in the State operating under the old district 
Jaw and forfy organized under the law of 1887. At the session of the legislature last 
winter, a bill was introduced for an act to establish a pure township system through- 
out the State. The bill was violently opposed by members of the legislature from 
the counties under the district system and others dissatisfied with the present law, 
. who believed its faults inherent in any township system. A prolonged and acrimo- 
nious contest was the result and in the end no legislation was obtained.”

Points in favor of the township system.'—The following, which may be said to sum 
up and epitomize the advantages of the township system of schools, was submitted 
at a mecting of the New York Association of School Commissioners and Superintend- 
ents (Batavia, January 14, 1891 
“1. The affairs of all school districts would be managed with business system, an 
advantage which now attaches to union free school districts, where a school board 
has charge of the district, holding regular meetings and having an oversight over 
school interests. 
“2, Equalization of school taxesintowns. Theinequality now prevalent would be 
removed, where one district pays $10 to $20 per capita for school privileges—no bet- 
ter than given in an adjoining district for $5 per capita. 
“3, Amore efficient, intelligent, and progressive class of school officers. Parsimony 
and extravagance would alike be controlled. As a rule boards of education are com- 
posed of the lez ading men of the community. 
“4,. All the inhabitants of a town would receive equal educational advantages at 
equal rates. 
“5, It would guarantee to all communities the school privileges now enjoyed by 
residents of union free scheol districts. 
“6, Fewer and larger schools, better wages, better teachers. Weak districts would 
be annexed to others.

ty ani usefulness to the oflice of school Sree, giving 
him less anxiety over petty details, and enabling him to supervise schools more 
systematically and intelligently. 
“9. Better facilities for grading the country schools, and establishing a uniform 
and satisfactory course of study, having in view the entire school population of a 
town. Adyaneed or high schools could ‘be established at convenient points, which 
every pupil of the town of requisite educational advancement would have the right 
to attend. The small schools would become a part of a perfected, harmonious, and 
efficient system, instead of straggling and struggling nonentities. 
“10, Cheaper and better schools, lower taxes, longer terms for less money. The 
Michigan report for 1888, p. 6, refers to a town organized under the township system, 
where the average length of term was nine months, at an expense of $13.71 per capita, 
in comparison with a town retaining the district system where the average length of 
term was four and a half months, at an expense of $14.80 per capita. 
“11. Uniformity of text-books would certainly be secured in every town. This 
would’ be very likely to extend to all the towns composing a commissioner district 
or a county. 
12, A more systematic and satisfactory method of making reports would be pos- 
sible, guranteeing more reliable school statistics, thus closing the avenues now open 
in a hundred ways for imperfect and unreliable data. 
*13, Greater dignity would attach to public education in the common schools of the 
State; public opinion would have greater respect for it, and public pride would be 
aroused. 
14, All troubles now encountered by trustees in making out or correcting “tax 
lists would be abolished; the efforts of the collector to elude the:taxpayer when fees 
are 1 per cent, and the hunt of the collector for the taxpayer when fees are 5 per 
cent, would entirely disappear. - 
“15. The question of district boundaries would no longer vex school commis- 
sioners or take their time. The matter would be entirely under the control of the 
school directors. 
“16. Cheaper text-books would be possible. They could be purchased for all the 
schools of a town at greatly reduced rates. This would solve the vexed question of 
State publication of text-books by allowing each town to purchase its own books 
where they could be obtained to the best advantage. 
“17, The present law in reference to compulsory education would be more gener- 
ally and more easily enforced. 
“18, It is the only system which will save the small country districts from extinc- 
tion. 
“19, More permanency in the teaching force of the State, a firm step toward mak- 
ing the teachers’ profession permanent. 
£20, As a result of the last point, a better and higher grade of teachers. 
“21. Better facilities for instruction would be afforded in the way of apparatus, 
books of reference, etc., and more intelligent action would be taken in reference to 
the equipment, maintenance, and preservation of school district libraries. 
“22. A general uplifting of educational sentiment throughout the State. With 
the township system, an enforceable compulsory education law, and provision for 
the professional training of teachers, our educational system would be placed twenty- 
five years in advance at one bound.”

  - res : VACATIONS. 1079 
XIII. VACATIONS. 
Are school vacations too long ?—Prof. Charles I’, Thwing, in the North American Re- 
view: The thirteen weeks which represent the normal summer vacation in college 
and school are long, altogether too long for student and teacher. The college stu- 
dent ‘suffers from so long a vacation through the loss of interest in his college 
work, Of course he forgets his learning; this is to be expected, even desired in cer- 
tain respects; but, also and more, he becomes diverted. His attention is for a whole 
quarter of the year directed to pursuits other than scholarly. His attention is also 
distracted, divided among a score of objects frivolous, serious, wise, foolish. The 
influences which touch him cease to be academic, and become social and commer- 
cial. He entersinto a life quite unlike his college life—which may itself be an advan- 
tage—but of this life he does not become avital part, which is a disadvantage. Tho 
ordering of his days becomes a disorder. His discipline is broken, He feels him- 
self to be on a vacation, and vacation is usually intellectual vacuity. If he is 
obliged, through parental command or through poverty, to take up regular work a 
larger part of the time, he should be grateful, and he finally will be. But if he is 
permitted to do whatever fancy leads him to, as he too frequently is permitted, he 
usually does nothing though trying todo a bit of everything—reading, writing, 
fishing, boating, and sharingin other diversions. The vacation becomes dissipation— 
moral, intellectual. Forces that are needed in college are not recruited. Hardi- 
endurance, concentration, pluck, grit, are not nursed through so long a period 
ivity. Laziness is the direct result of summerlistlessness. Recreation does 
not become recreation, Thestudent thinks himself to be in the garden of the lotos, 
and eating the lotos does not make a vigorous brain, The daily newspaper is the 
strongest regular intellectual fare; the hardest writing he does is acceptance of 
invitations, and the severest physival work playing tennis, 
Much in all these endeavors is admirable. If such a life the reading student 
could have for a month, it were well, but to stretch out these methods over at 
least three months is not so well. The proportions are bad. Resting is one thing, 
anda very good thing, but resting prolonged becomes rusty. Rusting eats the tool 
not used. Students, like tools, lose as much by August rest as by February wear. 
Let every student have all the rest, recreation, diversion, amusement required for 
keeping his forces in the finest condition; but he does not need one-quarter of a 
year. A healthy student, and such as I constantly have in mind, can get as much 
vigor out of two months as out of three. Eight weeks in the woods will give all 
necessary power quite as: well as thirteen. Eight weeks in the dissipating and 
charming enjoyments of society are better than thirteen for his college arms. A 
short vacation is better for a tired and healthy man than more—than a long one 
spent in laborious diversions. 
We are trying to find a way in which college men can begin their professional ca- 
reer before the age of 27. ‘‘Shortening the college course” is a bad method for 
securing this aim. The college course is none too long. Each student spends more 
than one year of his four years in vacations. He can not afford to spend so long a 
time. The college period is the only period of his life when he finds so long a pe- 
riod of rest necessary. For the young editor or merchant, minister or lawyer, thus 
to rest would prove professional suicide, or rather still-birth. By transferring five 
weeks from the vacation to the working period of the college and by a little extra 
work we might cut the college course to three years without a serious shortening 
of the time spent in study, and also without any depreciation of the worthiness of 
the course itself. 
The evils of the long vacation are more conspicuous in the common schools than 
in college students. ‘Lhese pupils are of the common people. More of them have 
parents whose purses are small than parents whose bank accounts are large. They 
spend their summers at home. 
They indulge in no outings more expensive or more prolonged than a visit to 
“Aunt Jane’s” for a fortnight. They dwellin citieslarge and small, in villages large 
and small, and in rural desolations. But wherever they dwell, under ordinary con- 
ditions, the long vacation is no more recreative to jaded energy than a short vaca- 
tion, and itis far more fraught with physical and ethical perils. Lawlessness isthe 
general condition of boys in vacation. Every wharf and mill-pond becomes more 
dreadful to every parent. Apples and melons need a closer watch. They are more 
inclined to “read” in the summer than our college men, and are possibly less in- 
clined to find their happiness in harmless pleasures. They become juvenile Bohe- 
mians. They return to their books the middle of September, not with an appe- - 
tite whetted by proper abstinence, but with a distaste created by a barbarian life. 
Every teacher knows that at least a month is required to restore classes to as good 
a working condition as was theirs at the close of school in June,

  PREFACE, 
By Artuur MacDonatp, Specialist in the Bureau. - 
There are a large number of children who may be called feeble-minded, and who 
often become destitute or degraded, and for whom it is difficult to provide. They 
are not imbeciles nor idiots, but are dull or backward in their studies; and the 
causes of these conditions are for the most part physical. Their future is very 
uncertain. They may fall under the care of good people or more frequently become 
the inmates of charitable institutions, which if they leave, as they often do, they 
are liable to become injured or abused, and, if they are girls or young women, to 
fall into disgrace and ruin. How to prevent these unfortunate cases and protect the 
feeble-minded from distress and danger has been much considered and acted upon 
by a number of societies and associations in England. Their general conclusion is 
that ‘‘ feeble-minded children should be separated from ordinary scholars in public

elementary schools, in order that they may receive special instruction and that the 
attention of school authorities be particularly directed towards this object.” 
The following report of Dr. Warner is tho first scientific investigation and the 
most important contribution to the study of abnormal children in public schools, 
and is now published for the first time by this Bureau, K 
In order to know the condition of the children in a school, Dr. Warner had two in- 
dependent reports made upon each child, one by the teachers, visitors, or inspectors, 
the other by himself, being a scientific report, based upon obgervation of each child, 
both when standing still and when making some simple movements. 
Dr. Warner says: ‘‘ The children are best observed in a large and well-lighted room, 
placed in groups of about thirty or forty, so that the observer can examine each child 
individually. The eyes of the child can be fixed by holding up some object for it to 
look at, as a silver piece on-the end of a pencil. The physiognomy of the individual 
features, the facial action and expression, eye movements, balance of head and body, 
ete., are quicklynoted. The children are then asked to hold their hands out straight in 
front of them with the palms towards thefloor. The position of the hand, etc., and as 
a further indication of the nerve system, their action and balance are noted. Then 
the palate is examined. In these stages of the inquiry children having any devia- 
tions from the normal standard are asked to wait with the teacher. The first investi- 
gation is thus completed, and the teacher is requested to present any case that he 
thinks abnormal among those that have not been selected. All children selected 
either by the examiner or teacher are retained, and the rest are sent to their class- 
rooms. 
Each selected case is now reéxaminod, and a schedule, similar to that on page xxxi, 
is filled out. A tapemeasure is frequently used to take the horizontal cireunference 
of the head. Occasionally some detailed inquiries are made or a brief mental exami- 
nation conducted, but as a rule no questions are asked of the children. The teach- 
ers enter their reports of the mental status afterwards. They generally acknowledge 
that the dull children in the school have been picked out by observation. 
While all abnormal conditions are observed-and recorded, no isolated fact, as some 
particular anomaly, can in any case be regarded as a sufficient evidence of abnor- 
mality. Thus a defective palate might be found in a bright pupil, but such a child 
would not be marked abnormal.” 
In the study of the mental condition of children the signs in physiognomy and 
craniology are not sufficient when unsupported by direct visible action of the nery- 
ous system. The neurophysiolog' side of expression is no Jess impertant than 
the anatomical. And in this report this fact is clearly shown. It will therefore be 
profitable to briefly consider some of the facts and principles brought out. 
From clinical and pathological studies of the nervous system much knowledge has 
been acquired as to the symptoms that result from lesions of certain portions of the 
brain. This makes it important, as well as interesting, to observe the conditions of 
the muscles, since their movements correspond to the states of certain nerve centers, 
Such nerve-muscular conditions can be regarded as expressions of the states of these 
nerve centers, and may be called nerve signs.! 
Now, all expression of fecling is effected by muscular action, whether it be by words, 
by facial movement or gesture, or by movements caused by voluntary muscles. Ex- 
pression may also be produced by dilatation of the pupil, erection of the hair, or dis- 
turbed action of the heart, these being due to the inorganic muscular fibers. For 
these reasons the nerve signs of abnormal children should be closely examined, in 
_ order to find definite terms by which to describe them. We judge of the state of 
the nervous system by muscular conditions, such as stooping attitude and spirit- 
less gait in fatigue. The position of the head is upright in defiance, drooping in 
shame; it is commonly held to one side in nervous women and girls convalescent 
from chorea. It is well known that in the convulsive state the hands are often closed 
with the thumbs turned in. 
In the study of abnormal children special attention has been given to the ocular 
and facial muscles, and those of the upper extremity. In health the greater number 
of ordinary movements of the eyes are probably in the horizontal plane of the axes 
of the orbits. There are many facts which indicate that the horizontal movements 
are the commonest, the least voluntary, and, therefore,-the least intellectual. Thus 
an individual in looking at an object moves the eyes by the action of the recti mus- 
cles so as to direct them toward it; this movement is more intellectual than when 
the head is turned so as to direct the eyes. A bright, healthy, and well-developed 
infant turns its eyes well in the orbits in looking about, whichis not the case with a 
dull, wasted child. 
An attempt to determine something as to the intellectuality of the different facial 
muscles was made by Dr. Warner, in conjunction with Dr. Beach of Dareth Asylum. 
The investigation was commenced upon the negative side, by observing the facial con- 
    
1It is to this view of the question, as demonstrated by the orizinal researches of the author of the 
report, that its value is principally due.—See his work ‘Mental Faculty.”

ditions in 15idiots. Asummary of the results, showing those muscles most often seen 
in meaningless action is: Occipito-frontalis, 11 times; zygomas, 8 times; corruagator 
supercilii, 7 times; depressor anguli oris, 5 times; orbicularis oculi, 3 times; grief 
muscle, 2 times. As far as these few cases go, the frequency with which these mus- 
cles, respectively, come into spontaneous action in a meaningless manner is shown. 
This may be some indication of the degree of their intellectual representation. Thus 
the grief muscle and the obicularis oculi acted much less meaninglessly than the 
oceipito-frontalis and zygomatic, and probably these former are much more expres- 
sive of intellectuality than these latter. 
If, now, we note the muscles most frequently put in action in the faces of intellec- 
tual people in expressing their mental states, we will see intellectuality most com- 
monly expressed in the frontal and middle zones. In hospital patients, also, by 
observing the condition of the frontal region and_ depression of the angles of the 
mouth, the facial appearance may often be accepted as a physical sign of the mental 
state of intellectual suffering and physical or organic suffering. 
It is possible to see how education, thoughts, and habits of thought and feeling 
affect the higher nerve centers, which canse the facial expression to alter. 
Some of the most expressive muscles are those which produce the finer movements 
of the fingers, which appear more to represent the brain conditions than the coarser 
movements. Some reasons for this are: (1) In hemiplegia from brain disease the. 
finger movements are most damaged and the last to recover; (2) finger movements 
are much-more injured by brain disease than by spinal disease. 
It is the relative tone, mainly of the flexor and extensor muscles, that is the proxi- 
mate cause of the passive positions or postures of the extremities, as the head, hand, 
spine, face, ete. As the action of these muscles indicates the state of corresponding 
nerve centers, so it is with these passive positions or postures of the individual, nor- 
mal or abnormal; for all ‘expression of nerve states and mental action is by move- 
ment and results of movement.” 
Defective expression, which refers to general facial expression apart from special 
muscular balances, has the highest pathological correlation of any nerve-sign. In 
the imbecile infant the nerve centers are wanting in spontaneity, and later in capa- 
city for codrdination, Codrdinated visible movements generally indicate codrdinated 
mental activity, while disconnected movement signifies mental confusion. 
As overaction cf the frontal museles may not only accompany cranial defects but 
be due to want of mental stimuli, it can be improved by education. 
In rickets there is a tendency to an unsymmetrical skeleton, ‘‘ unequal bilateral 
growth of the shafts of the bones, producing curvature, and in the skull producing 
bosses and deformities.” Thus, according to Dr. Warner, about one-third of the 
rachitic children he examined (Table 1,sub-Table D) presented abnormal nerve signs 
and mental dullness. Almost one-third of the children reported by the teachers as 
dull at school lessons showed abnormal nerve signs and defective development (Ta- 
ple 11). What has thus far been stated will serve as an illustration of some facts and princi- 
ples brought out in this important report, for a further explanation of which the 
reader is referred to Dr. Warner's introduction. 
It may be said in conclusion that in a clinico-pathological investigation of the de- 
velopment in relation to brain and nutrition, statistics showing the relative fre- 
quency and distribution of certain physical conditions among school children are 
necessary for finding out the causes of such abnormalities. This, as in all other inves- 
tigations, is the first rational step toward prevention.   
      INTRODUCTION. 
The state becomes heavily burdened by the defectively made portion of the pop- 
ulation, which comes into greater prominence under extensive emigration, which 
leaves with us the weak tending to pauperism, starvation, vagrancy, and crime, as well 
as a large body of “unemployed” and others capable of earning only small and varying 
wages; the field for recruiting the services is also limited. Were the children in 
this lower stratum improved, it would pave the way for social improvement, higher 
education, better and more valued wage-earning, and less social failure. It must be 
remembered that these feebly gifted children are confined to no social class, and appear 
more numerous in thenpper grades. The nation collectively is but the aggregate ofits 
components, These observations show the harm that probably arises from exempting 
feebly gifted and defective children from all education because they are unfitted to 
compete, even in school, with the average and the normal. 
It is then as important concerning a certain locality or sanitary area to know the 
average condition of the children as therate of mortality. Maldevelopment has been 
shown, as far as the facts go, to be a potent factor in predisposing to both mental 
dullness and low nutrition, two evils worth combating; it is not solely for the pur-

pose of attaining a condition of the people with a smaller percentage of badly made 
heads, palates, ears, noses, or other bodily defects, that a strong effort is called for, 
but that in remoVing the causes of such defects we may lessen the average of mental 
feebleness and low nutrition coattendant. 
The ends which it is desired to attain through State medicine are to improve the average development, nutrition, and potentiality for mental faculty, and thus to 
lessen crime, pauperism, and social failure, by removing causes leading to degenera- 
tion among the population. 
  THE PRINCIPLES EMPLOYED AND THE BASIS OF THE METHODS OF INQUIRY. 
As all expression of nerve states and of mental actionis by movement and results 
of movement, it is by logical analysis of the nerve signs corresponding to such vis- 
ible expression that we may hope to demonstrate the kinds of nerve action which 
correspond to mental states. While studying visible movement, it becomes obvious 
that certain typical postures often correspond with definite and definable physio- 
logical and pathological conditions, and might, therefore, be used in recording such 
states. This leads to the enumeration of many new clinical signs. 
In a healthy, newborn infant we find movement in all its parts while it is awake— 
that is, while its brain is in full functional activity. These movements may be seen 
in the limbs, especially in the digits, which may move separately; they are slower 
than most of the movements in adults, they are almost constant, and are but little 
under control of impressions through the senses. Such spontaneous movement is 
described under the term ‘‘microkinesis.” When the infant is about 3 months 
old we may observe some control of its movements through the senses; the micro- 
. Kinesis remains as themarked character, but the combinations of nerve centers acting 
are to some extent céordinated by sight and sound. At the age of 4 or 5 months 
further evidence of control of the centers through the senses is seen; the sight of an 
object may temporarily inhibit the movements, and this may be followed by turn- 
ing the head, eyes, and hands toward the object seen—that is, the céordinated 
movement occurs sequent to a period of inhibition of spontaneous action following 
stimulation. We infer from such observations that at birth the nerve centers act 
slowly and independently of one another, and the time and order of this action is 
not determined through the senses; at the age of 5 months their action may be tem- 
porarily suspended by external stimuli, and during the time when no efferent cur- 
rents are passing from them to produce visible movements they undergo a change, 
subsequently indicated by new and special codrdinated movements. This appears 
to be a new and great advance in the infant’s cerebral evolution. Whenavyear old, 
action well adapted by impressions received becomes very marked, and the child 
makes certain characteristic sounds on sight of certain objects; its spontaneous 
brain action becomes gradually and more and more capable of céordination. 
It appears that whereas at birth the most marked character of the nerve centers 
is the spontaneous action of individual loci of nerve tissue, in advancing evolution 
this spontaneity is not lost, but remains as the foundation of so-called voluntary and 
intellectual action becoming more controllable by circumstances. Aptitude for 
mental action appears to depend upon the capacity of nerve cells to control through 
’ the senses such impressions temporarily inhibiting their spontaneity and to arrange 
them functionally for codrdinated action. The imbecile infant does not show this 
microkinesis in the normal degree; its nerve centers are wanting in spontaneity, 
and later in capacity for coérdination. It may be shown that well-codrdinated vis- 
ible movements usually accompany well-controlled mental action, while a spreading 
area of movement not controlled often accompanies mental confusion. > 
This spontancous movement, slightly under control, is the character of healthy 
brain action of children in the infant school, so that postures are less available as 
signs among these very young children, and spontaneous movement of their fingers 
isnormal. The parts of the infant are then full of spontaneous movement; an excep- 
tion is in the eye movements, which are not frequent in many cases. One of the 
endeavors of infant training should be to encourage eye movements, then to control 
them. The postures or attitudes of the body imply balances or ratios of action in 
the nerve centers corresponding. The clenched fist or convulsive hand is common 
in fits and in tetany. These postures indicate relations in quantity of action among 
nerve centers. If we take the 2,285 (Table 2, columns 20 and 21) cases presenting 
deviations from the normal balance of the hand when held out, we find that 1,029 
(Table 13, column 3) of them presented visible defects in development also; that is 
to say, in nearly half of these cases, with unusual or defective ratios of nerve action, 
the proportioning of parts of the body was visibly abnormal. This suggests the 
hypothesis that the forces, or antecedent conditions, which caused ill-proportioning 
of the body may also have caused a tendency to ill-balancing of nerve centers. The 
converse of the proposition may be true—we have notas yet sufficient evidence, but the 
suggestion may guide inquiry—it may be found that as overaction of the frontal
-P-A-G-E-437
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITION OF CHILDREN. 1085 
muscles (Table 13, 1,616 cases) is very common with defects of the cranium (Table 
4 or 12, 2,576 cases), and overaction of the frontals is largely the outcome of want 
* of mental stimuli, further culture of the mental faculties will improve the average 
cranial development and lessen overaction of the frontals at the same time. Ifwe 
take the 5,487 cases (Table 2, column 4) with abnormal nerve signs, we find among 
them 3,071 (Table 10), or 55 per cent, who also present defects in development. Con- 
versely, among the 5,851 cases of defects in development (Table 2, column 3), we 
find 3,071 cases with abnormal nerve signs (Table 10)—that is, 52.4 per cent. Ifwe 
take cases with two defects in development, such as are given in Part 1, we see that 
they are correlated with nerve signs in percentages varying from 44.5 up to 71.8. 
The general statement that malproportioning in visible parts of the body and 
abnormal nerve signs are often coincident may be further illustrated, and such in- 
quiry may lend some support to the hypothesis that both kinds of defects may be 
due to the action of physical forces controlling quantities or ratios of vitalaction. 
In rickets there is a marked tendency to malproportioning in the skeleton; this is 
seen in epiphysial rere in unequal bilateral growth of the shafts of bones 
producing curvature, and in the skull producing bosses and deformities. This ten- 
dency to maldevelopment may affect the features and soft parts; among 196 rachitic 
children (Table 27), 15 were small in growth, and 40 presented defects of ear, epican- 
this, features, palpebral fissures, mouth, etc. This also isa condition that falls much 
more commonly upon the boy than the girl; about one-third of these malproportion- 
ate rachitic children presented abnormal nerve signs and mental dullness, In observ- 
ing conditions of development and physiognomy as indications of probable condi- 
tions of mental status—as in older physiognomical studies—the assumption is made 
that visible conditious of defect in form more or less necessarily coincide with defec- 
tive brains. Such correspondence does, dotbtless, often occur, but the generaliza- 
tion is too empirical to be applied with safety to the individual child. Here the 
observation of a number of abnormal nerve signs helps to supply the missing link, 
and observations quoted show that among children with defects in development and 
apuprEel nerve signs, one-third are reported by the teachers as dull at school 
lessons, - 
The term “defect in development” is frequently used and signifies deviation from 
the average or normal. It is not intended to assert that these signs are degenera- 
tions—the evidence derived from antique works of art shows that many are of an- 
cient date—it appears that in some classes they may be irregularities which further 
evolution, if wisely guided, may remove with their attendant evils. Among the 
2,961 Jew children (Table 26) an ancient race, uniformity of development 1s very 
marked, with 7.5 per cent of deviations from the normal, and all points in nutrition, 
nerve action, and mental status appear more regular among them than with our 
English children. When it is pointed outthat of English children 10.8 per cent, and 
of the Jew children 7.5 per cent (Table 26) present deviations from the average de- 
velopment, it is obvious the proposition may be put thus: The English children to a 
percentage of 89.2 and the Jew children to a percentage of 92.5, have evolved an 
average type. 
It is very common to see disordered conditions of the nerve system in children 
with defective construction of body—this was the case in 3,071 children (Table 10)— 
we may also see these nerve disturbances in children of normal construction of 
body—this is noted in 2,416 children; here such signs appear to result from the dis- 
order produced by special circumstances rather than from defects in original con- 
struction. In illustration, children fatigued and in the condition of chorea may be 
described. Among the signs of fatigue are the slight amount of force expended in 
movement, often with asymmetry of balance in the body; the fatigued centers may 
be unequally exhausted, spontaneous finger twitches like those of younger children 
may be seen, and slight movements may be excited by noises. The head is often 
held on one side; the arms when extended are not held horizontal, usually the left 
is lower, the hand balances in the weak type of posture, often again more markedly 
on the left side. Facial expression is lessened, and the orbicular muscles of the eye- 
de are relaxed, leading to fulness under the eyes, while the eyes themselves fix 
adly. 
Nutrition is a somewhat vague term; as applied to children in this inquiry it 
implies that the child as seen was thin, pale, or delicate looking. It is not sufficient 
evidence as to good nutrition to look at the face only; this part may be well nour- 
ished, and yet the limbs may be thin; I usually felt the child’s arms or legs. The 
most important fact noted with regard to these cases, which amounted to 2,003 (‘Table 
2, column 5), is that 1,459, or 73 per cent (Table 10), were cases presenting visible 
signs of deviation from the normal in development of the head, the features, and 
other parts. It seems then that there is a large group of children, amounting to 
nearly 3 percent of the children seen who are so far defective in make as to be usually 
of low nutrition when seenin school. This fact is more marked in the 36,000 children 
in day schools; among them 23 per cent of the boys and 38 per cent of the girls who 
     
-P-A-G-E-438
  1086 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
presented ‘defects in development were noted as of low nutrition (Table 30). It 
appears that these children are of lower general constitutional power, and tend to 
an ill-nourished condition under the stress of life, and the many causes of mental 
excitement, which, while they render them sharper mentally, militate against nutri- 
tion of the body and its tissues. That the amountof mental stimulus received by chil- 
dren does lower their genera] nutrition, seems to be further indicated asfollows: If we 
divide the 36,000 day scholars into two groups, 10,200 seen in day schools of upper 
social class, presumably well fed children, we find 5.2 per cent, of low nutrition; 
and among the 25,800 children in poorer day schools, 3.9 per cent; the only explana- 
tion to be offered is that the upper class children have more stress upon them than 
those of poorer social position. This subject will be pursued later on. 
Methods of observation and resenrch.—The methods of examining the physical con- 
dition of children seen in schools must necessarily be more limited than those used 
in the consulting room. Arrangements already exist in the reports of her majesty’s 
inspectors for determining the intellectual acquirements of school children; their 
family history and evidence as to their home life could not be obtained, and school 
managers naturally object to questions being asked of the children concerning their 
health, which if put would not be likely to elicit any trustworthy information. It 
is also impracticable to handle the children for the purposes of physical examina- 
tion. The observer must then depend mainly upon inspection, and having deter- 
mined beforehand what points to look for, he must record accurately what he sees. 
The importance of deciding on a number of physical signs for observation and 
record was appreciated before the work was commenced on a large scale. For the 
purpose of observing those finer balances and reactions of the nerve system which 
indicate neuro-mental potentialities, itis better to deal with the children in a uni- 
form manner, and not to handle them. ¢ 
The terms used in giving descriptions of children should each connote a fact seen 
and capable of verification and comparison, the essence of scientific description. 
THE SIGNS OBSERVED IN DESCRIBING CHILDREN. 
Cranial abnormalities (Table 4) appear to be the most important defects in devel- 
epment; they are the most numerous and have the highest pathological co-relation 
of any sign with ‘abnormal nerve signs,” low nutrition, and mental dulness: Boys, 
1,528; girls, 1,018; total, 2,576 (Table 12). 
The size and probable volume of the brain is a point of first-class importance, and 
the size of the cranium is in children a fair indication of the size of the brain. The 
following standard of the normal in a well-developed child ot good potentiality may 
be given: Head circumference at 9 months, 17.5 inches; at 12 months, 19 inches; at 
T years, 20 to 21 inches. This I believe to be a high-class standard of the normal, 
too high if deviations therefrom are to be considered as pathological; after 3 years 
of age 19 inches cranial circumference is too small, The figures given indicate the 
number of cases in which the condition stated was noted among the 50,000 children 
seen in this inquiry—boys, 26,884; girls, 23,1438. Defects of the cranium may be di- 
vided into subclasses (Table 4): 
Small heads: Boys, 327; girls, 738; total, 1,065. It is seen that in this group, con- 
trary to the usual rule, the defectis more common among girls. If there be no other 
defect, mental faculty may be average, but the child usually remains thin and deli- 
cate; such cases in after life may undertake good work and do it, but are more liable 
than others to exhaustion, migraine, and breakdown of the nerve sytem. At school 
these children are often delicate and irregular in attendance from ailments. 
Large heads: Boys, 257; girls, 46; total, 303. It seems probable that a large pro- 
portion of these cases resulted from rickets at an earlier period, for of the 168 cases 
of rickets with defect of cranium, 55.3 per cent were large heads. 
Cranial bosses: Boys, 495; girls, 127; total, 622. Cranial bosses are most usual at 
the site of the ossific centers of the two halves of the frontal bone; they may occur 
at the sides of the head over the parietal centers and elsewhere, as well as at the site 
of the anterior fontanelle. 
Asymmetrical heads: Boys, 84; girls, 16. These do not appear to have marked 
co-relations with defects. 
The palate is ill shapen in 1,331 children, standing next to the cranium, both in 
frequency and in a high co-relation to defectiveness. The palate was examined in 
all the children. The frequency of the various types has been given, but their rela- 
tive co-relation was not determined; there were 22 cases of cleft palate in the 
50,000. children. 
The ears were malproportioned in: Boys, 1,047; girls, 268. (Table 2.) Among 
pathological curiosities, supernumerary ears, remnants of branchial clefts, con- 
genital absence of ear, etc., are described; the adherent lobe did not appearas a 
marked defect. -
-P-A-G-E-439
  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITION OF CHILDREN. 1087 
The epicanthis was noted in 898 children. (Tables 2 and 12.) It appeared to 
have a lower co-relation with defectiveness than other signs; when associated with 
defects of the cranium, however (90 cases), the defectiveness of the group of cases 
was very marked. Defective growth in the bridge of the nose (455 cases) did not 
appear to be associated with rickets; the condition appears to be outgrown in 
many children, and its pathological co-relation is not high. Among conditions of 
the facial tissues, notes were taken of cases of: Features large and coarse, 251; pal- 
pebral fissures small, 181; mouth small, 44; bridge of nose in its soft tissue redun- 
dant, 61. It is important to note each feature separately, as the defects seem to 
have different correlative values. The epicanthis was found to a considerable 
extent local or endemic in certain districts. These defects are often associated. A 
hairy forehead, large frontal veins, and a small face under a well-made calvariam 
was found in some cases. Prognathous type was noted in 11 boys; ichthyosis in 17 
eases; congenital cyanosis in 3 boys; there were various other minor defects. 
Table 6. 
$ assis on to the description’ of “abnormal nerve signs,” (Table 13) we pro- 
ceeded to enumerate them, the number found among the 50,000 children, and to 
give their pathological co-relations. ft ! 
Expression defective: Boys, 694; girls, 474. This sign has the highest-pathologi- 
cal co-relation of any nerve sign. The term is here used to connote the general 
expression of the face as above and apart from the special muscular balances and 
action déscribed further on; a good expression may be present with abnormal 
coarse muscular action. 
Frontal muscles overacting: Boys, 1,322; girls, 1,616. Horizontal creases are thus 
formed; these muscles may often be seen working in athetoid fashion under the 
skin. The sign may appearin children at any age, and is usually mostmarked when 
they are least occupied. 
Corrugation : Boys, 199; girls, 40. This knitting of the eyebrows may be a 
“coarse” or a “fine” movement; like last sign, it may be athetoid in character, and 
the two signs often coexist. 
Orbicularis oculi relaxed: Boys, 522; girls, 343. The skin of the lower eyelid is re- 
Jaxed, puffy, and bags forward. The sign often accompanies fatigue and recurrent 
headaches. 
Eye movements defective: Boys, 798; girls, 485. The eyes may wander and-fix 
badly, or they may be too immobile, so that the child follows a moving object by 
turning the head, not by moving the eyes. Nearly half of these children were dull 
at lessons. 
The normal posture of the hands when held out to the word of command is straight, 
all parts and the fingers being in the same plane, and the hands on a level with the 
shoulders, the arms being parallel. 
Two modes of hand balance: The weak type—boys, 715; girls, 504—where the 
wrist and digits fall into moderate flexion; the “nervous” type—boys, 550; girls, ° 
516—presents flexion of the wrist with over-extension of the digits. The former 
type is common in weak children, the latter in those who are irritable, nervous, 
overmobile. - The percentage co-relations are: For the “‘ weak hand” defects in de- 
velopment, 47; low nutrition, 18; mental dullness, 38; for the “nervous hand” de- 
fects in development, 43; low nutrition, 25; mental dulness, 33. 
Finger twitches: boys, 445; girls, 261. This condition, thongh more common in 
boys, passes on to chorea more frequently in girls. : 
Lordosis: Boys, 184; girls, 279. The lumbar spine is markedly arched forward 
when the hands are held out in these cases. 
Head balance, asymmetrical: Boys, 219; girls, 319. The percentage correlation of 
this sign is high; defect in development, 61; low nutrition, 29; dull, 45. 
Among the less frequent abnormal nerve signs are: General defective balance, de- 
fective response in action, speech defective, mouth open, grinning, nystagmus, ptosis, 
tremor; these minor groups include 668 children. See table. 
RESULTS OF INSPECTION OF 50,000 CHILDREN SEEN AT 106 SCHOOLS; THE CLASSES 
AND GROUPS OF CHILDREN DESCRIBED, 
The study of the principles and methods of procedure to be employed and practice 
in making observations and in describing them was so far advanced in 1888 that a 
committee was formed by the psychological section of the British Medical Associa- 
tion, and, in conjunction with Dr. Hack Tuke, Dr. Fletcher Beach, and Dr. Shuttle- 
worth, the author made observations on 5,000 children in 14 schools and published a 
report,! with the aid of a grant from the funds of the British Medical Association. 
This first inquiry and the subsequent arrangement of cases in groups afforded valu- 
able experience, and gave many useful hints as to how the work should be farther 
. 1 See British Medical Journal, 1889, 1, p. 187.

extended; and also as to the best methods of keeping the records and the kind of 
results to be looked for. 
Following the publication of this first report a special committee was appointed by 
the Charity Organization Society, including representatives of the older committee, 
and as a result the present report has been prepared on 50,027 children seen by the 
author—boys, 26,884; girls, 23,143. 
Group I (Table 1, Subtable A), normal or average children: Boys, 21,305; girls, 
19,536. Percentages on numbers seen: Boys, 79.3; girls, 84.5. Such children are the 
average as presenting no visible defects or abnormal nerve signs and not being dull 
at lessons. 
Group II (Table 1, Subtable A), children presenting some deviations from the nor- 
mal, of whom notes were accordingly taken: Boys, 5,579; girls, 3,607; total, 9,186. 
Percentage on numbers seen: Boys, 20.7; girls, 15.5; total, 18.3. Schedules were 
filled in for each of these cases, Their varying conditions have been analyzed, and 
they will now be presented in groups or classes. 
Group III (Table 2), children presenting no defects in development or abnormal 
nerve signs, but reported as dull by the teachers: Boys, 185; girls, 134; total, 319. 
Such cases present good physical development, and a sound condition of brain as 
indicated by motoraction. It appears that the brains of these children, though capa- 
ble and healthy, had but little power for school work. It is important to differenti- 
ate such pupils from those with defective conditions. 
Group IV (Table 1, Subtable B), children feeble-minded or exceptional in mental 
status: Boys, 124; girls, 110. Of these cases, 2 were idiots; 46 imbeciles, or definitely 
mentally wanting; 12 were mentally exceptional, wanting in moral faculty, or lia- 
ble to mental attacks; 174 are entered as “ feeble-minded” or defective in meprtal 
capacity, short of actual imbecility. Probably many of them would, on further ex- 
amination, be found imbecile; some may be capable of great improvement. 
Group V (Table 1, subtable C), epileptics and children with history of fits during 
school life: Boys, 36; girls, 18; total, 54. These cases were inquired for in every 
school, and in some instances children not attending school were sent for by the 
teachers. Any case with a history or indications of fits during school life was recorded 
for what it may be worth. A list of these cases is given in Table 20. It would 
appear that most epileptic children are absent from school. Of the cases given,5 
boys and 5 girls were mentally defective. 
Group VI (Table 1, Subtable D, Table 21), children crippled, paralyzed, maimed, 
or deformed (not eye cases): Boys, 155; girls, 84; total, 239. These children varied 
greatly in brain power—some were mentally bright, others dull; they also varied in 
conditions of health. The conditions of disease. causing crippling were in various 
stages, and many of these children were capable of work and play. Five boys and 
5 girls were mentally defective.

Group VII (Table 1, Subtable E), children deaf, or partially deaf: Boys, 34; girls, 
33. These numbers do not include 51 children seen in aspecial school, of whom an 
account was given (see B. M. J., 1889). Tests for hearing were not commonly used, 
but a child found deaf was noted; there were some deaf and dumb in the day 
schools, 
Group VIII.(Table 8), eye cases: Boys, 836; girls, 637. Tests for vision and errors 
of refraction were not used, and ophthalmia was passed over; but when the eyes 
were looked at obvious defects were noted. Ophthalmia was seen in some day 
schools. There were of squint cases, 807, some requiring operation; many temporary, 
but only 276 children in all, used convex glasses; 48 used concave glasses. The 
group shows what a large amount of ophthalmic work is needed among children. 
Group IX (Table 2), children pale, thin, delicate, nutrition low: Boys, 1,030; girls, 
978. The most obvious fact concerning these children was that 733 of the boys and 
726 of the girls presented some defects in development. No inquiries were made as 
to the feeding of these children, but it may be assumed that among the upper grade 
schools and in the resident schools food was sufficient; still, the development cases 
were of low nutrition there also. Among the 50,000 cases the percentage of low 
nutrition was for boys 3.8, for girls 4.2; and among the development cases it was for 
boys, 20.2; for girls, 32.0. 
Group X (Table 13), children presenting defects in development: Boys, 3,616; girls, 
2,235. Conditions of maldevelopment form the largest class of visible defects observed,
-P-A-G-E-441
  
  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITION OF CHILDREN. 1089 
and as signs easily recognized and capable of description and classification, they 
stand prominently forward as pathological conditions characterizing portions of the 
child population. Analysis and comparison of cases shows the developmental signs 
to be of different value and importance. To demonstrate this the co-relation of each 
sign has been determined. From the point of view of estimating potential mental 
capacity, these signs are of value only in as far as experience gained in observation 
shows their average co-relation with cerebral or mental defects. The defectiveness 
in the make of a child is more strongly indicated when two maldevelopments are 
present. This was noted in 1,240 boys and 683 girls. Their co-relation was higher 
than for asingle defect—with nerve signs, 45; lownutrition, 31; dullness, 60 percent. 
Group XI (Table 13), cases presenting nerve signs: Boys, 3,413; girls, 2,074. Ab- 
normal nerve signs are largely co-related with defects in development—that is to 
say, some malproportion in the parts of the body is largely associated with a tend- 
ency to ill balance among the nerve centers. The significance of these signs varies 
in two directions; some indicate an over mobile nerve system, the centers tending 
to separate and spontaneous action, not well under control through the senses, of 
which finger twitching is the type, and a second set which indicate low-class brain 
development. These are mostly repetitive, uniform movements, athetoid in type, and 
represented by chronic overaction of the frontal muscles and repeated grinning. 
Group XII (Table 27), cases of rickets: Boys, 157; girls, 39; total, 196.

Probably more children were or had been rachitic than those registered. When 
the conditions seen in the bones left no doubt the case was registered accordingly, 
but the body could not be examined in detail under the conditions of this inquiry. 
It seems that a great character about the conditions termed rickets -is the malpro- 
portions of growth in the skeleton, especially about the cranium. It is shown that the 
palate is frequently ill-formed, and also that defects in development other than- 
cranium and palate were found i boys, 58; girls, 11; total, 69 cases. The patho- 
logical question might be raised, whether a large proportion of the cases registered 
as ‘‘cranial bones””—a subgroup of the cranial abnormalities amounting to boys, 
495; girls, 127; total, 622—were not really cases of rickets. These rachitic children 
are badly proportioned.

Group XIII (Table 11), a group of cases with defects in development, abnormal 
nerve signs, and low nutrition: Boys, 412; girls, 381; total, 793. 
Also with mental dullness: Boys, 192; girls, 157; total, 349. 
This group appears in fact to present a special class of development cases in 
which the inheritance has produced not only visible malformations or proportioning 
in the body, but also a constitutional tendengy to low nutrition, and a state of nerve 
centers ill balanced or badly acting. Such children may be said to be delicate, and 
44 per cent of them were reported by teachers as dull. These children, when dull, 
are included in the group who appear to need special care or training. 
Group XIV (Table 2, column 6), children reported by the teachers as dull in 
school: In every case recorded the teacher's opinion concerning the child’s mental 
capacity was asked for and taken down as evidence. The number of dull children 
is: Boys, 2,216; girls, 1,463; total, 3,679; their co-relations are given in full in Tables 
10, 11. Of these dull children, defects in development or abnormal nerve signs were 
found in 3,266 cases. 
Group XV (Table 31), children that eppear to require special care and training: 
It is not intended to imply that these children can not be provided for in day schools, 
but they need to be provided for, and it might be well that they should be marked 
on the school register, and their attendance and progress noted by the managers. 
The group includes ‘‘children feeble-minded or mentally exceptional. Group IV;

epileptic, cripples, and the development cases with low nutrition and nerve signs, 
who were. reported as dull mentally.” The group as thus arranged, allowing for 
overlapping cases, contains 817 children (boys, 473; girls, 344), or 1.6 per cent of the 
pees oe the number given, 165 are included on physical grounds, not being men- 
tally dull. 
Group XVI (Table 15), children presenting abnormal nerve signs without defects 
in development: Boys, 1,438; girls, 978; total, 2,416. In these cases there are no in- 
dications of defect in development to account for the nerve signs, and they appear 
to be due to other causes; they are slightly more frequent among the resident chil- 
dren and among the upper class children than in the average day schools, so that 
low feeding does not appear as a potent cause. It is probable that in this group we 
have the children of normal make who are ill trained, neglected, and overpressed by 
the stress of life. Theseseem to be the children most improvable by altered condi- 
tions and appropriate training; many are of ill balance and nervous; 39 per cent of 
these were dull.

nerve centers. The percentage of dullness among them is higher than among cither 
the ‘‘ development cases” or the ‘nerve cases.” ‘ 
Group XVIII (Table 15), children presenting development defects without abnor- 
mal nerve signs: Boys, 1,641; girls, 1,139; total, 2,780. These development cases, 
with a well-regulated nerve system, present less dullness than the last group, show- 
ing the importance of observing nerve signs. Of development cases with nerve 
signs, 43 per cent dull; of development cases without nerve signs, 35 per cent dull. 
Comparing groups of schools the percentages go against the residents as compared 
with day schools, except as to nutrition. Again, comparing schools of upper and 
lower grade, the conditions found are in favor of the lower class. Lastly, among the 
English children development defects are found in 10.8 per cent, among Jews in 7.5 
per cent, among the Irish in 20 per cent. 
CO-RELATION, OR THE RELATIONS OF PHYSICAL AND NERVE SIGNS TO LOW NUTRITION 
> AND MENTAL DULLNESS. = 
In Tables 10 and 11 the number of cases presenting each sign has been shown, and 
in the more important instances where the number of cases in which the sign was 
observed was large enough, or where the intrinsic value or interest of the sign 
seemed to call for it, the co-relation has been added, showing the number of cases 
presenting the sign who were also registered as presenting “low nutrition,” abnor- 
mal nerve signs, maldevelopments, or mental dullness, respectively. These co-rela- 
tions have been put into the form of percentages in Table 12. 
Itis not wished to represent the percentages as having an absolute value of corre- 
lation to the sign which may be applied to an individual child. The co-relation for 
some signs is probably of small value on account of the small number of cases ob- 
served, but it is given as illustrating that each physical or nerve sign has a co-rela- 
tion average with mental dullness, nutrition, ete. When the co-relationis on asmall 
number of cases the need of further observations in this direction is indicated. The 
percentage form is useful as indicating that some generalizations, drawn from large 
groups of cases apply equally to the individual signs characterizing the group. 
‘Thus defects in development have a higher co-relation with abnormal nerve signs in 
boys than in girls, but as to nutrition and mental dullness the girls suffer most. 
Asa contribution towards the etiology of defective development, we had arranged 
the 3,704 development cases seen among 34,991 children in the public elementary 
and day schools according to their distribution in twenty districts, as shown in Ta- 
ble 22. The percentage of these development cases taken upon the number of chil- 
dren seen in each district respectively is given. It is shown that the distribution is 
very unequal, being high in the western district of Kensington and Chelsea (wealthy 
district) at 12.6 per cent, and lower in the poorer schools of Islington at 7.4 per 
cent. This table also gives the percentage distribution of the principal defects reg- 
istered taken in two ways: (1) Upon the number of children seen; (2) upon the 
number of development cases. Ifsuch observations are confirmed by further experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
    
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITION OF CHILDREN. 1091 
ence, this method of arranging the facts may afford evidence upon the causes in the - 
district tending to produce defects in development and possibly for determining the 
particular kind of defect most prevalent. Observations of the 1,363 development 
cases in Poor-law schools, which are drawn from certain areas, are similarly given in 
Table 24. Table 25 has been prepared for comparison, showing conditions of the 
children in day schools for areas corresponding to the unions. In certain districts 
the ratio of boys and girls presenting the same conditions is not the average. 
As a preliminary to trying to determine the means that may be used to try and les- 
sen the physical causes of mental dullness, we have given a table of the conditions 
and group of conditions accompanying it, Table 29, and have determined, as far as 
the present work goes, the co-relative value of each sign in development and nerve 
action observed, as well as the distribution of these signs in certain areas or districts 
and in certain classes of schools and in the nationalities (Tables 26-30). The per- 
centage of mental dullness rises from 38 for development cases without nerve signs 
to 43 when both are present (Table 15), reaching 44 when the maldevelopment is ac- 
companied by low nutrition and abnormal nerve signs. 
Development cases considered in relation to sex and residence.—If we take 100 boys 
and 100 girls with defects in developaent from among the 50,000 children seen, we 
shall find many of them with abnormal nerve signs, low nutrition, and mental dul- 
ness. Following the experience gained, the following estimate may be given show- 
ing the probable results of placing them first in a day school and then in a resident 
school. z

It is thus obvious that residence contrasted with home life and day school pro- 
duces marked effects, different among boys and girls. On both sides of the resident 
school nutrition becomes higher, more markedly with the girls. Nervesigns increase 
with residence, especially with boys. Mental dullness increases with residence 
slightly, more so among the girls. ‘ 
The loss and gain from putting 100 boys and 100 girls with defects in development 
in resident schools may be represented thus: 
  
  Boys. | Girls.

Assessment of results of intellec‘ual and physical training in a school, with allowance 
for the physical condition of the children.—Having obtained a report on the physical 
condition of the children in a school, we may proceed to estimate the number of dull 
children and the number with nerve signs to be expected upon allowance for the ma- 
terial in the school. The estimate is founded upon the conditions seen and the aver- 
age experience of 50,000 children, the allowance being made upon the development 
eases and nerve cases; an allowance for low nutrition could be added.  
-P-A-G-E-444

There are two results of physical training which characterize it as satisfactory: 
(1) in cases of defective development to remove or prevent abnormal nerve signs; (2) 
in children of normal development to prevent, or at least not to produce, nerve signs. 
Thus, taking the development cases in aschool, a high percentage of abnormal nerve 
signs among them i is against the effects of the training; and a high percentage of 
nerve cases without defects in development suggests that the training is not good. 
So, also, in each case a high percentage of mental dullness shows want of adapta- 
tion of methods of teaching to the special requirements of the children. 
We may estimate as dull children:

  The work that has already been done affords a considerable amount of evidence to 
the following propositions: 
(A) It is practicable to inspect, report upon, and classify the children seen ina 
school by means of facts seen and the teacher's report. Evidence of scientific value 
ae bn obtainable of importance to the state, to education, and to philanthropic 
efforts. 
(B) The average child material in a school or district may be determined. The 
conditions of development and the nerve signs vary much in different schools; as to 
the latter, observation suggests that adapted methods of training may remove them. _ 
(C) The co-relation of visible signs with low nutrition and mental ‘dullness has in 
many cases been demonstrated. 
(D) Ill-made and feeble children tend to gravitate to the poor-law and certified 
industrial schools, and to the lower standards of day schools. The want of provi- 
sion for feeble children in day-schools, and in many cases their exemption on medi- 
cal certificates, tends to throw such cases upon the care of the state, and many become 
degraded. 
(E) Feebly-gifted children, the paralyzed, and in some cases the epileptic, may in 
many cases and in limited numbers be educated in day schools if better provision for 
them is not provided. 
Following is a schedule with ten illustrative cases:

It will be noted that each column in the accompanying tables is numbered. Below 
is a key to these numbered columns, so far as the words at the head of each seem to 
require further explanation. A column which has reference to a particular subject, — 
e€.g., 4, cases presenting nerve signs, appears in all the tables under the same number, 
EXPLANATIONS OF THE COLUMNS OF THE TABLES, AND DEFINITIONS. 
Column 1, number of children seen: In this column is entered the total number of ehildren seen in each school. Column 2, number of children noted: In this column {s entered the total number of children who, as presenting deviations from the normal, were selected from the total number of children seen (col- umn 1). Column 3, cases with defect in development: These are children which present bodily defects of various degrees of importance, which aro further classified below. (See explanations of columns 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.) Column 4, cases presenting nerve signs: In these cases the children presented somo action ov bal- ance of part of the body which indicated deviations from the normal. ‘This group is further classilied below. (See explanation of columns 13 to 24, inclusive.) Column 5, delicate, pale, or thin (nutrition low): Ta these cases there was, in consequence of an appearance of thinness, paleness, or delicacy, reason for thinking that there was low nutrition, ‘The children were not examined medically, in order to ascertain the presence of disease, and no informa- tion as to their feeding was recorded. Column 6, reported by teachers as mentally dull: In this column the teachbrs’ independent opinion is given. ‘Their opinion was in each case taken as evidence. (See note above on the method adopted in observing and noting children.) Column 7, eye cases, squints, etc., not ophthalmia: In these cases obvious defects or disease were recorded, but no tests were applied to detect errors of vision or refraction. Ophthalmia was seen in certain schools, but cases of ophthalmia were not recorded. Colunms 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12: All these are columns containing the analysis of column 3—that is, of conditions of defect in development. Column 8, cranial abnormality: This term applies to all defects in the size or form of the head. Column 8; palate defective: Under this head are entered defective palate—narrow, arched, or clefé. In certain schools, to which notes are affixed, the palate was examined in some cases only. Column 10, external ears defective. Under this heading are entered cases in which the ears were large and outstanding, dissimilar in shape, ete. Column 11, epicanthis: These are cases in which there is a fold of skin abnormally developed across the inner angle of the opening of the eyelids, giving an appearance of great width between the eyes. Column 12, other defects in developmont. ‘These were, for instance, general undersize of body, defects of nose, features coarse, mouth small, ete. Columns 13 to 24: All these are columns containing the analysis of column 4. ‘They give the analy- sis of defective nerve signs. Column 13, general balance bad: Backs bent, slouehing gait. Golumn 14, expression defective: These are cases in which there was a vacant gaze, fixed or staring; or a want of changefulness. Column 15, frontals overact: Here the frontal muscles produce horizontal creases in the forehead, which may be deep ifthese muscles overact coarsely. Sometimes the muscles are seen working under the skin in vermicular fashion, with an athetoid movement. In other cases the action is fine, produe- ing what may be called a dull forehead. ‘The overaction does not necessarily erase expression. Column 16 corrugation: Knitting the eyebrows; contracting the eyebrows. Vertical creases are thus produced. ‘They may coexist with overacting frontals. Column 17, orbicularis oculi relaxed: ‘There is a thin. muscle, the orbicularis oculi, which encircles the eyelids. ‘Its tone gives sharpness of outline to the lower lid, so that its convexity is seen. Its action is increased in laughter. When this muscle is relaxed there is a fulness or bagginess under the eyes. 
‘Column 18, eye movements defective: Some children, if an object is moved in front of them, follow it not with their eyes only, but with the head, keeping the eyes fixed. In other cases there is a rest- less wandering of the eyes. Defects of these kinds are noted in this column. Column 19, head balance weak: In the normal the head is held erect. In these cases it lolls over to one side or the other, or droops forward. Column 20, hand balance nervous: In these cases when the arm is extended forward, the wrist droops, the palm is slightly contracted laterally, the thumb and fingers are extended backward at their junction with the palm of the hand. Column 21, hand. balance weak: In this type of balance the wrist is slightly drooped, the palm contracted laterally, and the digits are slightly bent. Column 22, finger twitches: This is seen when the hand is held forward for inspection. Golumn 23, lordosis: In these cases, when the hands are held forward, an altered balance of the spine may be seen, with an arching forward in the lumbar region, whild the upper part between the shoulders is thrown back. 5 Column 24, other nerve signs: ‘These include defects such as the following: Slowness to respond to acommand, when, for instance, the children are told to hold their hands out in front of them; uncer- tainty, irregularity, or blundering in responding to such a command; defects of speech; oversmiling or grinning; openness of mouth; and tremor. Of the arrangement of the tables a word must be said. Nore.—It must not be taken for granted that the proportion of children entered in the tables as de- fective in development, etc., is the proportion which would prevail in the total child popwation of a district. From other evidence it is certain that many children thus defective are not to be found in the schools, whether public elementary or poor law. ‘To find the proportion of such children in a dis- trict, therefore, further inquiry is necéssary. ‘The tables only give the proportion of cases seen among the children attending the schools on certain dates. It must be borne in mind that apart from these very important limitations; the tables, as they stand, are rather a collection of data and illustrations of amethod of investigation than material sot forth with such necessary explanations as would justify the drawing of any large general conclusions bearing on practical administration,

    This group, though not numerous, demands attention, as they presented many de- 
fects; the following cases were registered, probably others might have been noted:

12 14 
6 8   
    
This condition appears to be more common in resident schools, only 1 boy and 2 
girls were noted in day schools. This condition appears to be independent of the 
weather, though cold may increase it and cause chilblains. The months in which 
these children were seen were as follows: March, girl, 1. July, boy,1; girl, 1. Sep- 
tember, boy, 1; girl, 1. October, boys, 11; girls,5. November, boy,4; girl,3. Among 
the boys were, cranial abnormalities, 4; defective palate, 3; ichthyosis, 1; ptosis, 1; 
mentally defective, 2. Among the girls were, cranial abnormality, 1; mentally de- 
fective, 3. 
N. B.—The number of dull children given above should probably be higher, as 4 
boys and 8 girls were in school XI, from which no reports of mental status were re- 
ceived from the teachers.   
BINARY DEFECTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR CONDITION, 
The number of binary defects registered was, boys, 1,240; girls, 683; total, 1,923. 
The number of children presenting binary defects has not been determined; some 
children presented more than two defects in development, so that their number must 
have been less than the number of cases given above; probably not 10 per cent of the 
eases had more than two defects. A fair estimate of the correlative value of combined 
defects in development may be given, as in tables adjacent.

  1104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91.. 
PILYSICAL CONDITIONS AS FACTORS IN PRODUCING MENTAL DULLNESS. 
As a main purpose in this inquiry has been to demonstrate that inspection of chil- 
dren in schools may afford a basis for estimations of their capacity for mental action 
the facts bearing directly upon this question have been summarized in the next 
table. The visible signs observed are mainly in these groups: Defects in develop- 
ment (see tables 11, 12); abnormal nerve signs (see tables 13, 14), and indications of 
low nutrition. The special value of signs of defects in development is that they are 
indications of congenital abnormality with a certain amount of probability that tho 
brain functions may not be quite up to the normal capacity. This probability is 
increased when in addition to visible defects in the development we also see abnor- 
mal nerve-signs, which are the direct indication of brain action at the time of 
inspection. Development defects appear to be factors in producing low nutrition 
of the body (and brain) even in the well-fed and protected children in resident schools 
(I-XXXIV), and in a greater degree in the day schools. It seems that when defects 
indevelopment are associated with low nutrition, the condition of development of 
body and brain is more probably associated with mental dullness. When we meet 
with cases of defect in development with low nutrition and abnornal nerve signs we 
find that 44 per cent are reported by the teachers as mentally dull.

«@ Many cases registered as ‘t Feebly-gifted ” were very low class. 
b It is probable that among those entered as ‘ Feebly-gifted mentally” some would be found, on fur- 
ther examination, to be really imbecile, and many capable of great improvement; of the imbecile cases, 2 boys and 2 girls were also epileptic.

(See columns 8 to 12 on the right hand.) It must be observed: (1) That the data -contained in the table are necessarily limited. ‘he children examined in the several areas wero com- paratively but a small proportion of the child-population of each district. (2) ‘That in order to draw inal conclusions as to the causation of defects and their distribution in various locations, a much larger number of children must be seen. orE.— Letters in first colunm refer to the groups in Table 35.

  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CONDITION OF CHILDREN. 1137 
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CONDI- 
TION OF CHILDREN. 
FORMATION OF A COMMITTEE, 
At the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography the following resolu- 
tions were passed: 
In Section IV (infancy and childhood) it was proposed by Dr. Shuttleworth (Lan- 
caster), seconded by Mr. Graham Balfour, and carried unanimously: 
That, according to the returns prepared by Dr. Warner on the fecble-minded, epileptic, ete., it would appear that an appreciable number of children, though not imbecile, are more or less defectively devel- oped in brain and body. ‘That for their training and education special arrangements aro necessary, and that in the absence of such arrangements there is grave fear of moral and mental deterioration. 
In Division II (Demography) the following resolution was proposed by Mr. Ernest 
Hart, seconded by Mr. Graham Balfour, and carried unanimously: 
That an investigation which has been made in regard to the conditions of bodily development and 
brain action in some 50,000 children indicate new and grave problems respecting the provision neces- 
sary for the care and training of those who are more or less defective in make, and also respecting the causation, in certain districts, of mal-developments which are much associated with defects of the 
brain; and that an extended scientific inquiry is desirable for the further elucidation of this subject. 
In Section IV the following resolution, proposed by Dr. Kotelman (Hamburg) on 
behalf of Dr. Ludwig Strumpell (Leipzig), Dr. F.L. A. Koch (Leipzig), Dr. mil 
Schmidt (Leipzig), Dr. Ernst Hasse (Leipzig), amended by Dr. Warner, was carried 
with one dissentient: 2 
‘That this congress do appoint a commission of persons severally conversant in: (1) Examination of the physical condition of children; (2) mental conditions and diseases; (3) education and methods of dealing with children; (4) statistical compilation of facts; whose duty it shall be to inquire into the condition of children in schools and elsewhere, and carry out the same upon a fixed plan. ‘This con- gress empowers the commission to add to their number, aud to appeal to recognized authorities or Cources for assistance if necessary. 
  The following were proposed as members of the commission, Dr. Warner being the 
convener: Dr. Kotelman, Hamburg;.Dr. Jacobi, New York; Dr. Roussel, Paris; Dr.

The committee desire to spread information as to new evidence upon conditi»ms 
of child life, physical and mental, and have addressed a letter to the Universities, 
Colleges, and other educational bodies, suggesting the desirability of establishing 
lectures upon the subject. One course of lectures has been arranged to commence 
in October, and it is hoped that others will shortly follow. The committee are also 
in communication with Washington, New York, Paris, Vienna, and Leraing-Leige.

  CHAPTER Xxx. 
FACILITIES IN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY IN THE COL- 
LEGES OF THE UNITED STATES. 
BY WILLIAM O. KROHN, PH. D. 
(Professor of psychology and pedagogy, University of Illinois.) 
INTRODUCTION. 
The first laboratory in experimental psychology was founded by Prof. Wilhelm 
Wundt at Leipzig in 1878, with very unpretentious aims and inauspicious begin- 
nings. At first he received neither patronage nor recognition from the State and 
indeed his one room was no more than a little Werkstiitte, for the psychological 
laboratory of that day was of necessity an experiment in itself. However, this little 
laboratory soon became widely known, and on account of its very novelty attracted 
many of the students of philosophy then attending the University of Leipzig. The 
value of their new experimental method so impressed these students that it was soon 
‘ carried into effect at other institutions, and happily this new movement early found 
its way to America, To President G. Stanley Hall and Dr. J.MeKay Cattell, Wundt’s 
first American students, belongs the credit of introducing the experimental methods 
of treating psychology into the American college; the first laboratory being that of 
Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore, in which laboratory somany of the teachers 
of experimental and comparative psychology in the various colleges of the United 
States received their training. From this one compatatively small laboratory at 
Johns Hopkins the number has rapidly increased to fifteen now in actual use while 
no less than ten other institutions have taken steps to secure laboratory facilities 
within a year. 
In Europe the progress of the new movement in psychology has been much slower 
than in our own country, but of Wundt’s students Miinsterberg established a labor- 
atory at Freiburg in Baden and Martins in Bonn, while G. E. Miiller at Géttingen 
has a laboratory that can hardly be excelled. The last named is in all probability 
the outgrowth of that interesting series of lectures on Medicinische Psychologieread 
by Hermann Lotze while he was professor in Géttingen, whose successor Miiller is. 
At Berlin, Heidelburg, Munich, Geneva, Bern, Copenhagen, Groningen, and Jena 
are smaller collections of apparatus which serve chiefly for the purposes of illustra- 
tion and the carrying on of “practice courses” rather than for original research. 
The limited facilities at these latter places are due rather to the poor financial sup- 
port.on the part of the State, most of the laboratories having been established by the 
professors out of their own meager salaries and limited means. The facilities at 
Paris are very good, but in all England there is as yet practically nothing in this line. 
At Cambridge a meager £100 has just been appropriated, while at Oxford only very 
recently has the matter been even discussed. On the other hand the valuation of 
the present laboratory equipment in this country is more than $30,000, much-greater 
than that of all the European laboratories put together. 
In the following description an effort has been made to place before the public the 
      actual facilities in experimental psychology at those institutions of our country so 3 
fortunate as to possess them, with a belief that many of the questions now being pro- 
pounded will find answer in such a description; and also with the hope that it will 
be demonstrated to all that psychology no longer lives upon the crumbs that fall 
from the tables of neurology and physiology, but investigates from its own point of 
view and no less broad mindedly than the other sciences,

    1140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
There is no longer need of argument for the value of experimental methods as 
applied to psychology and yet some would fain restrict the psychologist to a color 
mixer and a few models of the brain as his quota of apparatus, forgetting that nine- 
teenth-century students demand nineteeeth-century methods, and that a fourteenth- 
century psychology will no longer suffice in the American college. There was atime 
when the chemist needed little else than a spoon anda bottle for his work, buthappily | 
this is no longer the ease. 
In none of the natural sciences has there been the rapid growth that has marked 
the development of experimental psychology in the United States, for it must be 
remembered that, with but one exception, all of the fifteen laboratories now in exist- 
ence in this country have been founded since the autumn of 1888—within four years— 
and furthermore, this number is to be nearly doubled within a year. 
It is the further hope that the many doubts and misgivings with reference to the 
“new” psychology which so frequently find expression in the question: Of what 
use is a laboratory to the psychologist? will be met in the following description of 
the various laboratories and that the question itself will be afforded a sufficiently 
clear answer. 5 
The exhibit in this branch of natural science at the World’s Fair, as indicative of 
actual work done in our colleges, will surprise even some of the closest students of 
the curriculum and its modification in the American college and will further show 
as a real matter of fact that the facilities in experimental psychology in the colleges 
of the United States are nowhere surpassed in the way of advantages offered for 
original research in one of the most interesting, because one of the most fruitful 
lines of investigation open to the scientific student. 
BROWN UNIVERSITY. 
The courses offered in psychology are the following: (1) Introductory course in 
sychology extending through two terms, required of all juniors. (2) Introductory 
aboratory course with demonstration and experimental work by the students, one 
term, elective for juniors. (3) Advanced course, extending through the year, elec- 
tive for seniors and graduates, consisting of original research in the laboratory and 
seminary for papers and discussions. . 
At the date of this writing (December, 1892) the laboratory has been in operation 
only three months, and henceis not yet fully equipped with apparatus. Some pieces 
have been ordered, but have not yet arrived, e.g., chronoscope, time-sense appara- 
tus, etc. Others are in course of construction. The list will be made thoroughly 
complete for demonstrations, and every thing else will be procured as needed for 
special research. The principal instruments already procured are as follows: The 
usual apparatus for sensations of contact, pressure, temperature, smell, taste and 
position, rotation. For the muscle sense, weights, and a new apparatus for measur- 
ing extent and rapidity of motion. For hearing, tuning-forks, resonators, siren, 
sonometer and organ pipes. For vision, various pieces of apparatus for demonstrat- 
ing the mechanism of the eye, stereoscope, Holmgren’s worsteds for investigating 
color blindness; Helmholtz and Bradley’s colored papers, color-wheels and a com- 
plete set of apparatus for Hering’s experiments in simultaneous contrast, ‘‘kymo- 
graph, tambours, and electric recording signals, recording metronome, sphygmo- 
graph, dynamograph, dynamometer, pneumograph, apparatus for detecting and re- 
cording unconscious movements of the hand and Jastrow’s automatograph. Further 
apparatus is rapidly being procured and much can be constructed by the university 
carpenter and mechanic who have fully equipped workshops. 
The library has four rooms, two large ones (one of them 40 by 20 feet), one of 
which can be thoroughly darkened, and two small ones, each of which is removed 
trom noise, can be darkened, and is electrically connected with the main rooms. 
The library of the University contains 75,000 volumes. In psychological literature 
it is yet far from complete, but the defect is being remedied as rapidly as possible. 
Every thing needed for special research will be provided, 
THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
The laboratory for the department of experimental psychology had its beginning 
during the winter of 1891-92, three suitable rooms in the divinity building having 
been set apart for the purpose. Lectures are given three times a week and experi- 
mental work is carried on daily. At present the equipment includes the following 
pieces of apparatus: 3 specimen brains, 2 large models of the brain (Auzoux), 10 
small models of the brain (Leipzig), models of eye and ear, model showing eye move- 
ments (Wundt), microscopes and histological preparations of nervous tissue, 1 tone 
measurer (Appium), 1 set (13) tuning forks (Appium), 1 set (20) tuning forks 
(Kenig), 1 set (22) cylinders (Keenig), 1 set (14) resonators (Kenig), 3 color tops, 1
-P-A-G-E-493
  FACILITIES IN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 1141 
pendulum apparatus (Wundt), 1 control hammer, 1 Hipp chronoscope (new pattern), 
1 recording drum, 2 metonomes, 2 sound hammers, 2 signal bells, i electro motor, 
1set statives; Edison batteries, rheochord, Morse keys, commutators, etc. 
The arrangement of the laboratory in its present temporary location is far from 
perfection. However, improved facilities for work will be afforded in the new hall 
of philosophy, where greater amount of space, divided into convenient and well-_ 
appointed rooms, is assigned to the department of experimental psychology. 
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 
There is at present but one institution offering work in psychology, and during the 
present year three different courses are given, as follows: (1) Anintroductory course 
consisting (a) of a physiological part, devoted to the anatomy and physiology of the 
nervous system, and the sense organs, and based partly on Bernstein’s Five Senses; 
(b) a psychological part, in which is used James’s Briefer Course. ‘This is a “double 
minor,” coming five hours a week, for twelve weeks. Next quarter there will be given 
two parallel courses occupying four hours a week each, and continuing through the 
remainder of the year, viz: (2) An advanced course in psychology, a reading course 
based on James’s Principles, for those who have had the introductory course; (3) A 
laboratory course in experimental psychology, based on Dr. Sanford’s Notes. 
Most of the first appropriation of $1,000 has already been expended for psycholog- 
ical instruments, models and the like. So far the apparatus is as follows: Series of 
tuning-forks, (Kenig), differential sonometers, set of resonators (Kenig), Helm- 
holtz phakoscope, Kuehne’s artificial eye, Ewald’s pseudoscopes, Golton’s set of test- 
weights, Talrich’s models of the brain, Auzoux’s models of the brain, eye, and ear. 
Other pieces, e. g. Hipp chronoscope and Cattell’s fall-chronometer, have been or- 
dered, but have not yet arrived. 
There has been made a further appropriation of $800 for the purchase of psycholog- 
ical instruments in connection with the exhibit at the World’s Fair. This will bring 
to the University a large number of pieces of value for demonstrational purposes. 
Within a year the psychological laboratory will be in comfortable quarters in the 
new biological building which is soon to be erected. ; 
s CLARK UNIVERSITY. 
The work in psychology at Clark University embraces the allied topics of anatomy 
of the nervous system, anthropulogy, pedagogy, and experimental psychology. 
The laboratory in experimental psychology at this institution is in many respects 
the pioneer laboratory of this country both historically and pragmatically. Indeed 
it comprises nearly all the original apparatus used in the first laboratory in this 
country, that of Johns Hopkins University. 
The three rooms occupied were planned with especial care in the construction of 
the university building. The largest room occupied by the general laboratory can 
be readily transformed into a very acceptable dark-room. In this room all the gen- 
eral class work (except lectures) takes place. It is also the general aparatus room, 
well furnished with wall cases, and supplied with abundant table space, cabinets of 
drawers anda workbench. The larger part of the best apparatus have been made by 
the university mechanic. 
A very complete equipment is available to the students in the following lines of 
experimental investigation: (1) Sensations of contact, (2) temperature sensations 
(hot and cold spots), (3) sensations of pressure, (4) static sensations, e. g., recogni- 
tion of the postures of the body as a whole, (5) muscle sense, (6) joint and tendon 
senses, (7) study of bilateral asymmetry of function, (8) sensations of taste and 
smell, (9) hearing, (10) vision, (11) reaction time experiments. 
Over 300 sets of experiments are carried out during the year under the supervision - 
of the laboratory demonstrator. 
The chief apparatus is: Hipp chronoscope, two Ludwig kymographs with Cam- 
bridge interrupter and other accessories; students drum as recording apparatus; a 
well-designed wall pendulum on knife edges set in motion electrically and a very 
accurate time measurer; Wundt’s “ Zeitsinn” apparatus; control hammer; e#the- 
siometers of different patterns; a complete series of weights for experiment on pres- 
sure sense; tilting board; rotating table; Mosso’s bed: olfactometer; harmonium; 
sonometer; Helmholtz phakoscope; ophthalmotrope; plenophalmotrope; tambours; 
Duprez signals; Hering’s color mixers; battery, and motors. Mention can not be 
made of the numerous minor, and, to outsiders, seemingly insignificant pieces of 
apparatus with which the majority of the experiments are made. Twenty-five hun- 
dred dollars is a conservative valuation of the equipment at Clark. 
The following are the courses offered: 
(1) Practical course.—This consists of about 300 experiments covering the chief 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  1142 : . EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
problems of touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision, psycho-physie law, reaction times, 
association, memory, rhythm, etc. This course follows the normal course now being 
marked out by Dr. Sanford in the American Journal of Psychology, and is intended to 
give practical familiarity with psycho-physic apparatus, methods, and phenomena, 
and will occupy three afternoons a week. 
(2) Lectures on physiological psychology.—These are given thrice a week throughout 
the year. This course supplements and is concurrent with course 1. It treats of 
the history, methods, and results of modern experimental psychology and embraces 
digests of current literature. 
(8) A course of two sessions per week through the year, partly by lecture and 
partly by seminary upon instinct, dreams, hypnotism, and other topics, with demon- 
strations. The psychological parts of anthropology (myths, rites, and customs) are, 
in a measure, included in this course. 
(4) Weekly conferences devoted to lecturettes, journal club work, quizzes, and 
seminary study of selected themes in the field of psychology and philosophy. 
(5) Investigation.—Each advanced student is expected to select some promising 
topic of research, either experimental or literary, and to have something to show for 
his work before the end of the year. > 
Good literary digests in course 4, or valuable studies in course 5,may be published 
in the American Journal of Psychology, edited by the department. 
The founder of this university endowed twenty fellowships, some yielding $600, 
some $400 annually, and ten scholarships yielding $200 annually. Of the fellows, the 
past year, 8 were in the department of psychology, likewise 3 scholars. 
The American Journal of Psychology is published at Clark University, edited by 
President G. Stanley Hall. Each volume contains four numbers of about one hundred 
and fifty pages each. Besides original articles, about half the space is devoted to 
careful digests of the important literature of the field. This journal stands in the 
same relation to the psychological investigations of our own land as do Wundt’s 
Philosophische Studien and Ebbinghaus’ Zeitschrift-fiir Psychologie und Physioligie 
der Sinnesorganne to those of Germany. 
COLUMBIA COLLEGE, 
The laboratory of experimental psychology at this institution occupies four rooms 
on the top floor of the building containing the offices of administration. One of these 
rooms (about 40 by 20 feet) is used as a lecture room and laboratory for instruction. 
‘The other three roonts (each about 20 by 20 feet) are used chiefly for special research. 
One room is a dark room, for work on vision. The rooms are well lighted and are 
supplied with water, gas, and electric power. The college will remove in two years 
and in the new buildings great care will be given to the accommodation and fittings 
of the laboratory of experimental psychology. 
The collection of apparatus is probably not surpassed by any in this country or in 
Europe. Two thousand five hundred dollars have been appropriated for the collec- 
~ tion by the trustees, in addition to the apparatus which cost $1,200 now in use. The 
apparatus has been secured with a view to a complete course of experiments, such 
as is carried out by the students attending the introductory course, and with a view 
to special researches. There are this year (1892-93) six students doing special ad- 
vanced work. 
Three courses in experimental psychology are offered by Prof. Cattell: (1) Intro- 
ductory course; (2) an advanced course whose subject is altered each year; and (3) 
research work, for which the laboratory is open at all times. An introductory 
course in psychology is given by Prof. Hyslop and an advanced course by Prof. But- 
ler. Prof. Osborn gives a course on “ The Brain,” and many other courses of interest 
to students of experimental psychology are offered by the several faculties of the 
college and institutions of the city. 
University fellowships are open to the students of this department and the library 
facilities are excellent. 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY. 
The psychological laboratory of Cornell University is one year old and completely 
arranged for work. It occupies the third story of the south section of White Hall 
and contains six rooms, each room being connected with all the others by an 
elaborate system of telegraphic wires, which facilitates the carrying on of simul- 
taneous work in different parts of the laboratory. The floors are solid, an important 
feature in the adjustment of fine apparatus, and the elevation secures perfect quiet 
for experimentation. The first room is devoted to experimental work in aco: stics. 
The laboratory is especially rich in acoustical apparatus, which inclides a p-ano- 
forte, an Appium’s tone measurer (triple set), a long series of tuning forks from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-495
  FACILITIES IN EXPERIMENTAL PsycHoLocy. — 1143 
Hanau workshop, and an extensive set of the instruments made by Keenig, of Paris. 
This room is connected by a metal tube for the transmission of auditory stimuli, 
with the acoustical reacting room. 
The second’room is arranged as the reacting room in chronometrical experiments. 
The apparatus is fairly complete. It comprises two Hipp chronoscopes of the new 
construction, a kymograph of the Ludwig pattern, to which the time-sense disk has 
been fitted; the large control-hammer, recently devised by Wundt; electro-mag- 
netic hammers, and the Hipp fall-apparatus, for sound stimulation; Cattell’s keys, 
for lip and word reaction; a reading telescope (Cambridge Instrument Company) ; 
together with the usual series of simple reaction keys, commutators, bells, resist- 
ance boards, etc. A pendulum for light reactions, and a chronograph will soon be 
added to the collection. 
In addition to these instruments room No.2 contains a series of brain models, 
including the large Auzoux specimen; two Marey tambours; the Cambridge Instru- 
ment Company’s box of weights; apparatus for the investigation of the sense of 
smell; metronomes. 
Room No. 3 is arranged as the professor’s private room. Here is stored a set of 
sy chophysical and physiological diagrams, and the seminary library will be placed 
Hed for the convenience of students who are working continuously in the labora- 
tory. 
TasOm. No. 4 is fitted up as a workshop. It contains, besides bench and tool cup- 
board, the storage battery from which the electrical supply for the laboratory is 
derived. The fifth room is a dark chamber, and will serve both for optical researches 
and as the reacting room in acoustical work. An internal chamber, which is moy- 
able and still darker, can be employed for perimetric and other experiments. 
Room No. 6 is the largest of the suite. At present it has a double function. It is 
furnished to accommodate small classes; while it also contains the chronoscope table, 
and so stands in the relation of experimenting room to No. 2. Here are arranged, 
further, the optical apparatus—Krille’s large color-mixer and after-image apparatus; 
models to demonstrate the movements of the eyes (Helmholtz, etc.); three color- 
mixing tops of the new Krille pattern; two demonstration stereoscopes; a spectro- 
photometer, made by the Cambridge Instrument Company; the same company’s box 
of wool color tests; two episkotisters; a diaphragm apparatus, as used by Kirsch- 
mann, ete. To these must be added Wundt’s fall chronometer for demonstrating 
the extent of apperception. 
The collection of instruments is continually being added to, and the resources of 
the laboratory increased by the further acquisition of books and diagrams. It will, 
in all probability, be necessary before long to devote room No. 6 to experimental 
work exclusively. This term twenty-one students are hearing the professor’s course 
(advanced psychology, with experimental demonstrations), and fifteen are taking 
work in the laboratory, introductory or advanced. 
The laboratory has a special endowment, and psychology a special library fund. ~ 
The following courses are now offered: (1) Advanced psychology with experi- 
mental illustrations; (2) introduction to laboratory work; (3) reading of German 
psychology, with work of all kinds in the laboratory. 
There are three fellowships and six scholarships in the Sage school; and these are 
open to candidates offering psychology. 
DENISON UNIVERSITY. 
The instruction in experimental psychology at Denison University is in charge of 
the department of biology. The course is based on a thorough preparation in anat- 
omy and physiology, including embryology, histology, and comparative morphol- 
ogy. A term in neurology is given to scientific students in the fall of the junior 
year, and a term of physiological psychology is elective for all students in the 
winter term of the senior year. In the graduate course, a year of advanced work 
and research is provided for, distributed between psychophysics, comparative psy- 
chology, and neurology. A building in course of erection will afford room for one 
or more laboratories for this work and will be equipped with chronoscope, pendu- 
lum, myograph, and the most essential apparatus. A special course of shopwork 
in which students will construct apparatus of their own devising, will be a feature of the equipment. The present year a single term has been devoted te neurology 
and physiological psychology. 
HARVARD UNIVERSITY. 
The department of psychology at Harvard has spared neither money nor endeavor to equip its laboratory in the best manner possible, and as a result we find at Amer- ica’s oldest educational institution what is probably the most valuable collection of psychological apparatus in the world.  
-P-A-G-E-496
  1144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
In the first place it must be mentioned that there are at Harvard three teachers 
giving their entire time and effort to instruction in psychology with thirty students 
taking the practice course and a dozen more advanced men occupying themselves 
with important research. 
The laboratory occupies the upper floor of Dane Hall, the former home of the law 
school, and consists of two very large rooms (36 by 25 feet), well lighted, and also 
an excellent dark room. 
The apparatus can not be listed in detail, but is arranged in the following four 
groups: i 
(1.) Demonstration apparatus (a) such apparatus as best serves to represent the 
connection between mind and body, and their reciprocal influence upon each other. 
(b) Models and prepared tissue of the brain, nerves, and organs of sense, including 
the most expensive models of the eye and ear, as well as one showing the course of 
the nerve tracts to the brain. Also a number of wax models for use in the compara- 
tive study of the brain. This group also includes a vast number of anatomical 
charts and histological preparations together with an excellent microscope and 
accessories. All these are of course only for the purpose of demonstration and form 
no part of the apparatus for real experimental work, 
(2.) Department for the study of the psychology of the senses. There is included 
in this group a complete set of tuning-forks, an organ, harmonium, reeds and pipes, 
and resonators for psychological study of the sensations of sound, various kinds 
of color-mixers, excellent prisms, instruments for the study of the phenomena of 
after images, as well as of color blindness, and a perimeter, constituting some of the 
apparatus devoted to psychological optics. Mention must also be made of the com- 
plicated apparatus used for the study of the sensations of pressure and contact as 
well as the various forms of sensation of motion. 
(3) Instruments used for psychometric investigations. The laboratory at Harvard 
is unusually rich in apparatus of this class. Indeed it is as complete in this line as 
any laboratory can be made at this stage of the science. 
(4) The last group includes all apparatus which serves in the investigation of the 
higher mental processes, e. g., illusions of space and time, studies of memory, atten- 
tion, association of idea, and forming of judgments. This group also comprises the 
most recently devised apparatus for the study of the esthetic feelings. 
Belonging to the above four departments, the most expensive pieces of apparatus 
are the following: Model of the brain (Aeby’s and also Auzoux’s), models of the end 
coe, of sense, Kenig’s acoustic apparatus, color disks from Hering and Wundt, 
Baltze’s kymograph, registering tuningforks; Ewadd’s, Hipp’s and Miinsterberg’s 
chronoscopes and Miinsterberg’s apparatus for the study of sensations of movement. 
At the time of this writing these are the chief pieces of research in progress: 
(1) Influence of attention upon intensity; (2) localization of several simultaneous 
sound impressions; (3) investigations upon the esthetics of color and form; (4) 
discrimination time for space intervals, following Miinsterberg’s favorite method of 
Kettenreaktion; (5) association time with speech; (6) reciprocal influence of sense 
impressions; (7) influence of the mental process upon bodily fatigue; (8) fusion of 
touch sensations; (9) reciprocal action of the various volitional impulses. 
The courses offered are as follows: (1) Introduction to psychology. Three hours a 
week one-half year. (2) Beginner’s course. Three hours a week entire year. (3) 
Weekly demonstrations of the above to groups of 10 persons each. (4) Laboratory 
research. Three to four hours each day. (5) Psychological seminary. 
The laboratory also contains a well-equipped psychological library of 400 volumes. 
Prof. Miinsterberg, who was for so long located at ere in Baden, and who 
has so recently connected himself with Harvard, brought with him much of his own 
apparatus with which he made his name and reputation in Germany. This appa- 
ratus is a valuable addition to Harvard’s facilities. . 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. 
The laboratory at this university is just beginning to assume definiteness of form 
and arrangement. Indeed, it is the newest of all the laboratories in the United 
States at the time of ¢his report, the first apparatus being set up January 10, 1893. 
For present needs the quarters in the new natural history building are suffi- 
ciently ample, embracing one large laboratory room with water, gas, and electricity, 
well glazed, and having a solid floor; a dark room, with double sink and gas, en- 
trance to this room being indirect through three doors; and astore room, while there 
is a lecture room and a private research room in the main building. These quarters, 
though merely temporary, are quite above the average. 
A considerable amount of apparatus is ordered and on the way, but the best and 
most satisfactory is that constructed in the engineering shops of the university at 
very low cost, but with great skill. A complete set of charts is being prepared, 
while the best models and specimens of prepared tissue are in the laboratory.

  FACILITIES IN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 1145 
In the present class of the general course there are thirty seniors. One graduate 
student has been taking advanced work in this department. The courses are to be 
organized with a view to offering the best advantages in experimental psychology. 
The chief and most promising piece of original research now in progress is ‘‘A Study 
of the Dermal Sensations of Pressure, both simultaneous and successive.” ‘The re- 
sults include some very important facts withreference to the educability and memory 
of the skin. 
An entrée of the most generous sort into the State hospitals for the insane, deaf, 
and dumb, and the blind is not one of the least advantages enjoyed by the students 
in psychology of this university. 
A university bulletin, the publication of which is just begun, affords a desirable 
avenue for the publication of important results of experimental work. All the lead- 
ing magazines pertaining to work in this field are accessible to the students. 
INDIANA UNIVERSITY. 
The laboratory for experimental psychology in Indiana University was opened upon 
a very modest foundation in the winter of 1887~88. Gradual additions were made, 
the value of apparatus at the end of the college year 1890~91 amounting to about 
$500. The equipment did not warrant the opening of complete courses, but almost 
all chapters in experimental psychology were partially illustrated by demonstrations, 
while researches were carried out in reaction time, estimation of distance by the 
skin, successive association, and illusions of apperception. 
During the college year 1890-91 work in experimental psychology ceased during 
the absence of the professor on leave. In that year, however, provision was made 
for generous additions to the laboratory. At the present time the laboratory has in 
its possession : 
(1) Most of the standard and subordinate appliances for the study of the psychology 
of the senses. (2) For time determinations a Hipp chronoscope, Marey drum, 
Ewald chronoscope connection with a standard clock, and the necessary supple- 
mentary apparatus, such as tuning-forks, Kronecker interrupter, Duprez signals, 
and thelike. (3) Appliances, such as stethoscope, sphygmograph, phethysmograph, 
various forms of myograph for use upon animal or human muscles, together with 
tambours, recepteurs, and tambours 4 transmission, for recording results graphically. 
(4) A set of apparatus for anthropometrical tests. (5) A good outfit of tools for the 
construction of apparatus. 
Besides the courses in logic, ethics, and history of philosophy given by the depart- 
ment of philosophy, a course of one term has been given in general elementary psy- 
chology and a course of one year in experimental psychology. Provision will be 
made for advanced undergraduate and graduate work. 
Special attention has been given by the professor in charge to the literature of 
child study and to that of experimental psychology with reference to its possible 
application to the study of school children. Special courses will be opened for the 
benefit of teachers, and the research work of the department will, in the immediate 
future, turn largely in this direction. 
UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. 
At this university the following courses in psychology are offered: (1) Elementary 
psychology. Lectures on the nervous system, special senses, and localization of cere- 
bral function, followed by a course in empirical psychology on the basis of James’s 
“Principles of Psychology,” one term of five hours a week for seniors. (2) Advanced 
psychology. Lectures on the time relations of mental phenomena, with experiments 
in time reactions with the Hipp chronoscope. Lectures on attention, habit, instinct, 
expression of the emotions. Lectures on abnormal psychology, including uncon- 
scious psychosis, dreams, hypnotism, human automatism, and multiple personality. 
One term, three hours a week, for seniors. (3) Memory class. Lectures on the his- 
tory of memory theories, modern theories of retention, images, visualization, and 
amnesia. The second half of the term is given to lectures on memory training, and mnemonics, with exercises. One term, two hours a week. ° 
The equipment of apparatus is as follows: A complete set of charts, illustrating the 
cerebro-spina! system, the special senses, cerebral localization, and illusions of per- 
ception; Auzoux’s dissectible model of the brain (with hardened specimens af the 
human brain and apparatus for dissecting sheeps’ brains); Hipp chronoscope, with 
apparatus for measuring reaction and association, tune, etc.; apparatus for testing 
goay ghopbysieal law in pressure sense, vision, and muscular sense; set of Berlin 
worsteds for testing color-blindness; also ‘‘ pseudo-isochromatischen Tafeln” for the 
same purpose; rotating desks for mixing colors, wooden compasses for testing space- 
discriminative sensibility of the skin, apparatus for exhibiting contrast, after-im- 
ages, and illusions.

There is as yet no separate room for experimental psychology, nor has any origi-+ 
nal research been attempted in this department—thatis, in experimental psychology. 
‘The apparatus is only used for illustrative purposes. 
LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY. 
The abundant resources of this university have made it possible to found as good 
a laboratory in experimental psychology as money wisely expended can secure. 
While nothing can be given as yet in the way of detailed account of the facilities in 
experimental psychology at this institution, yet from the steps already taken it is 
easy to see that the laboratory now being equipped wili be such as to entitle it to a 
place in the very front rank. : 
UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. 
All students in-psychology are required to do laboratory work. The introductory 
course occupies three hours a week; one hour in laboratory during the first half year 
and two hours in laboratory during the second half year. After this year the labor- 
atory requirements will be doubled. The class in the introductory course this year 
numbers seventy, about one-third of whom are free elective students (not required 
to take any other work in philosophy). ‘Two-thirds have chosen the subject instead 
of logic or history of philosophy. One half year’s work in one of these three sub- 
jects is required of certain students. At present there are only two students doing 
special work in psychology. Additional apparatus already ordered and the further 
assistance promised will doubtless add a number of others to the list of special stu- 
dents for next year. It may be interesting to know that ten of the seventy students 
are teachers in the city schools—three hours a week being so selected as to make it 
convenient for them to attend the class. 
At present there is but one room devoted entirely to laboratory purposes. It is 30 
by 40 feet, has good light, excellent floor, and three piers from the ground. The 
small lecture room assigned to the department is often used as a laboratory when 
two rooms are needed at the same time. 
The department possesses more than $1,000 worth of apparatus, including the 
better-known standard pieces and a number of useful home-made pieces. In another 
-year there will be abundant facilities with which to perform Stanford’s experiments 
or their equivalent. In this institution experimental psychology is not taught as a 
sequence to descriptive or nitrospective psychology, but as an introduction to any 
study of mind. Some little advanced work along one or two lines is offered, and 
facilities for such work will be increased after sufficient apparatus for the introduc- 
tory course is provided. 
For a new department the library facilities in psychology are good, including 
nearly all the recent works which have been contributed to the subject by those 
specially interested in the experimental aspect of the question. The departments of 
philosophy and pedagogy now receive twenty-eight periodicals. In other institu- 
tions of learning some of these would be charged to various departments of biology 
and medicine. 
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
The laboratory at this institution was opened in 1888, and occupies three rooms in 
the biological building, of which two are in actual use. The third will be fitted up 
in the course of the current year and others will be added as needed. The rooms 
are well lighted and heated, fitted with electrical apparatus, and supplied with means 
of cutting off light and sound from experimenters. The laboratory is furnished with 
all the smaller pieces of apparatus used in the study of the simpler sensations, such 
as color wheels, spectroscope, stereoscope and slides, siren, Appium_tone-measurer, 
a very complete series of tuning-forks and resonators, perimeter, chronographs, and 
chronoscopes. The apparatus for the study of simple and compound reactions was 
constructed andarranged with especial care by Dr. Cattell, so that the experimentee is 
within reach of the experimenter’s voice, although cut off from the more distracting 
sense impressions. 
The following instruments seem worthy of especial mention: 
(1) A wheel 1 meter in diameter is so balanced on conical axles as to always be in 
a state of equilibrium. The periphery, 10 centimeters in breadth, revolves past an 
opening the size of which can be regulated. The rate of revolution-can be deter- 
mined by means of a chronoseope with which it is connected. This instrument can 
be used for mixing and contrasting colors, for determining the time required to read 
words and sentences, and in general for any experiments in which it is desired to 
expose a visual object for a short but determinate time. If used as a chronograph, it 
may be made to register accurately the one hundred thousandth part of a second.

(2) For measuring accuracy of discrimination of time and extent of motions.—A car- 
riage to be moved by the hand upon a graduated brass scale is connected with the 
chronoscope. ‘The actual time and extent of the carriage’s motion can thus be com- 
pared with the judgment of the experimentee. 
(8) For measuring accuracy of discrimination of extent and force of motions.—Resem- 
bles the preceding, but is not connected with the chronoscope, and hasan attach- 
ment by which weights may be lifted as the carriage is moved. 
(4) For themeasurement of sensitiveness to pressure.—A piston with an area of 1 square 
cm. is connected with a spring in the handle of the instrument. An index upon the 
handle registers pressure up to 15 kilograms. 
(5) For the measurement of sensitiveness to slight changes in temperature.—A metallic, 
water-tight chamber is inclosed in a black wooden case packed with asbestos. A 
point of the metal 1 mm. in diameter, and turned to the form of a hemisphere, pro- 
trudes through the wood at the tip of the cone. Ice or water can be introduced into 
the chamber, : 
(6) A dynamometer for registering force of pull up to 25 kilograms. 
(7) For measuring sensitiveness to the relative intensity of lighis.—A lamp, provided 
with a metal hood and sliding to and fro upon a graduated scale, throws a beam 
of light through a hole in a vertical plank upon a white background. <A seconds - 
pendulum, controlled by an electromagnet and bearing a blackened screen swings 
before the hole. By this means the duration and intensity of each illumination, the 
time interval between any two illuminations, as well as their relative intensity, are 
brought under the control of the experimenter. Detailed descriptions and cuts of 
Nos. 2, 3,6, and 7 will be found in a monograph on the “ Perception of Small Differ- 
ences,” recently published by the department. 
(8) For the study of themore simple wsthetic judgments.—Designed by Drs. Miinster- 
berg and Witmer. A uniform black surface one meter square is so supported upon 
an upright that it can be adjusted at any angle to the line of sight. In slots on its 
“surface run metal carriers, bearing white points or strips of linen. These are con- 
nected with a graduated scale at the rear of the instrument, and are so controlled 
that the experimenter can present at will to the experimentee points at varying dis- 
tances from each other, lines divided in varyingratios, and many simple plane figures. 
It may be used for the study of judgments as to relative size and position, as well as 
for the wsthetices of simple plane figures. 
‘The department has also in course of construction a color mixer, on which the sec- 
tors can be changed while the apparatus is in motion, and a piece of apparatus of 
simple design, for controlling the chronoscope less expensive but as accurate as 
Wundt’s control hammer, and giving a far wider range of standard times. 
The library of the university is especially well supplied with the literature of ex- 
perimental psychology, and may be regarded as fairly complete in this direction up 
to date. A sufficient fund? is provided for the acquisition of new publications as 
they appear and the filling upof lacune. Books and pamphlets needed by a student 
for special lines of research are provided by the Department. The following period- 
icals are now taken and the list is being continually extended: Zeitschrift fiir Vol- 
kerpsychologie u. vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft, Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie u. 
Physiologie der Sinnesorgane, Zeitschrift fiir wissenschaftliche Philosophie, Philo- 
sophische Monatshefte, Mind, American Journal of Psychology, Wundt’s Philoso- 
phische Studien, Philosophical Review, Revue Philosophique, Revue Scientifique, 
Annales des Sciences Psychiques, Revue d’Hypnotism, Pflueger’s Archiv fiir Physio- 
logie, and many others dealing with philosophy, ethics, ethnology, neurology, 
psychiatry, and other subjects having a less direct bearing upon psychology proper. 
Complete sets are on hand of nearly all the above-mentioned magazines. 
A course in experimental psychology is offered as an elective to undergraduates of 
the junior and senior classes and has been taken by 25 men this year. Ladd’s 
smaller textbook is used in connection with lectures and laboratory work. 
In the department of philosophy 13 graduates are taking courses in experimental 
psychology. Instruction is by lectures with collateral reading and experimental 
investigation of special problems, The following lines of work are being pursued 
by graduate students: (1) On reaction times as modified by age, education, and 
physical conditions; (2) Statistical inquiry into the esthetics of visual form; (3) 
Certain phenomena of attention; (4) Mental and physiological rhythms, 
After this year the courses in experimental psychology will be made elective for 
students of the fourth year of the course in medicine. 
Students of experimental psychology also enjoy the exceptional facilities for the 
study of physiology, neurology, and psychiatry afforded by the department of medi- 
cine. 
The results of the work carried on at the laboratory from 1888 to 1891 are em- 
bodied in the monograph recently issued by Profs. Fullerton and Cattell as No.2 of 
the philosophical series of the University of Pennsylvania and entitled ‘On the Per- 
ception of Small Differences.” Other numbers of the series will appear from time 
to time.

  1148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
WELLESLEY COLLEGE. 
The work in experimental psychology at Wellesley College was begun in the fall 
of 1891. It is, therefore, little more than a yéar old, and so far no special students 
have worked in the laboratory and the only original research undertaken is a statis- tinal pngniry into cases of colored hearing and of forms for numbers, for months, and 
the like. 
The work has, therefore, been of a general character, and its most important re- 
sult, pedagogically, is the aid which it offers toward demonstrating the value of 
experimental methods in such a general course in psychology. 
‘The laboratory consists of one large room rather unfavorably situated with refer- 
ence to quiet and to temperature. ‘There is one small room adjoining, of which use 
ae aoe made, and the dark room of the department of physics is also placed at 
isposal, 
The apparatus includes a reaction-time instrument (with attachment for measur- 
ing reading time), a “‘joint-sensation” instrument, a copy of Hering’sroof-glass instrn- 
ment (made in the Wellesley carpenter-shop), for experiment in simultaneous con- 
trast, a Wheatstone stereoscope, a Rothe color wheel, with disks (Maxwell, Talbot, 
and Fechner); apparatus for the Helmholtz and the Hering colored-shadow experi- 
ment, and for simple optical and entoptic experiments; a pressure balance, a gradu- 
ated series of weights, a home-made “ Galton’s bar,” a set of well-made metal statives 
with clamps and attachments (from Petzoldt, Leipzig), dissecting instruments, and 
various small pieces of apparatus. 
The psychological laboratory is fortunate in being able to borrow from the biolog- 
ical and physical laboratories much of the necessary equipment such as models of 
brain, spinal cord, eye, and ear; monochords, tuning-forks, and electric batteries. 
x is Pappy, also, in the codperation of carpenters and machinists, under skilled 
rection. ' 
The library, to which all the students have access, is fairly good in the line of ex- 
perimental Psychology, and is constantly improving. It contains, among many 
other useful books, Wundt, James, Stumpf, Spencer, Bain, Sully, Ladd, the mono- 
graphs of Ribot, Binet, Miinsterberg, and Schneider; and among the periodical pub- 
lications the American Journal of Psychology, the Philosophical Review, Mind, the 
Revue Philosophique, the Zeitschrift der Physiologie and Psychologie der Sinnes- 
organen, Wundt’s Philosophische Studien, and the Proceedings of the Society for 
Psychical Research. 
The following is a description of the method of the course in experimental psy- 
chology at Wellesley. This descriptionrefers explicitly to the work of the first year, 
- but there has been no important modification of the course, whose aim throughout, 
is to supplement, and in no way to supersede introspection; to lead students to ob- 
serve in detail, and to verify the facts of their ordinary experience; to familiarize 
them with the results of modern investigation, with the usual experimental meth- 
ods, and to introduce them to the important works of psychological literature. 
The first month is devoted to a study of cerebral physiology. The classwork in- 
cludes recitations, informal lectures, and some written work on the part of the stu- 
dents. The study of the brain by textbooks, plates, and especially by models, pre- 
cedes the dissection by each student of asheep’s brain. Even those students who 
most dreaded this dissecting are practically unanimous with regard to its value in 
clearing up the difficult points in cerebral anatomy. In the class-room during the 
week in which the dissection is carried on, the principal theories of cerebral locali- 
zation are discussed. 
The next six weeks are spent in the experimental study of sensation. About 
seventy experiments are performed by the students on sensations of contact, pres- 
sure, temperature, hearing, and sight. These experiments almost without excep- 
tion are selected from those suggested by Dr. E. C. Sanford in his laboratory course 
in psychology, but re-arranged with reference to the plan of the lectures and the 
class discussion. Papyrograph descriptions of the experiments are distributed to 
the students and commented upon in class before the experiments are undertaken. 
The instructor keeps daily laboratory hours in order to answer questions and offer 
assistdnce. Each student is responsible for a record of her own experiments. In 
class reports are made on the results of experiments, and recitations are conducted 
on the psychology of the different senses. The bearing of the experiments upon the 
different theories of perception is discussed. Special efforts are made to free the 
word “‘sensation” from the vague, dualistic meaning, which it often carries with 
it. Then follows a six weeks’ study of space perception with experiments. These 
experiments, of which there are more than thirty, illustrate the methods of gaining 
or at least developing, the space-consciousness. The theories of monocular vision 
are carefully studied and are illustrated by diagrams and by ‘‘ cyclopean eye” experi- 
ments. The study of the perception of depth includes an adaptation from Hering’s 
experiment, in which the subject, looking through a tube, finds that he can cor-

rectly distinguish within very small distances, whether a shot is dropped before or 
behind a black string stretched before a white background. The fact and the laws 
of convergence are studied with the aid of a Wheatstone stereoscope. 
There follows a consideration of illusions of space; and of visual space, including 
the experiments suggested by Dr. James on so-called tympanum spatial sensations; 
and others with a telegraph snapper, on the location of sounds and the sense ot 
direction. The study of the emotions and of the will is accompanied by no experi- 
mental work. 
In place of a final examination, a psychological essay is required. The subjects 
assigned are very general, and are intended as subjects for study rather than as. 
definite essay headings. The immediate topic of the paper is decided upon after” 
the study and not before it. Such subjects as association, attention, memory, imag- 
ination, the psychology of Tanguage, the psychology of childhood, the psychology 
of blindness, aphasia, animal psychology, are chosen. 
The study of the psychology of blindness is accompanied by visits to the Perkins 
Institute. Thus a student who writes on ‘The Imagination of the Blind,” bases 
her conclusions upon apersonai study of blind children. She questions the children, 
consults with their teachers and reads their compositions. Those who write on the 
psychology of childhood make personal observations on babies and little children. 
Hypnotism and dreams also receive a full share of attention. 
In connection with the work of the course a collection of statistics concerning 
colored hearing was undertaken the past year with interesting results. No new 
explanations of the phenomena were offered or discussed. 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The chair of experimental and comparative psychology was created in June, 1888, 
to be occupied by Dr. Joseph Jastrow, and at the same time provision was made for 
the establishment of a laboratory. 
COURSES OFFERED. 
General psychology.—It is the object of this course to acquaint the student with the 
problems of mental life, especially such as have a living interest and are susceptible 
of every day illustration, Observation of the intellectual operations in the student’s 
own mind is encouraged and an acquaintance with the best literature is furthered. 
Among the topics introduced are the relations of body and mind, the development 
of mind in animals; the senses as factors in mental life; the mind in disease, illus- 
trated by the diseases of language, of memory, and of personality; the experimental 
methods applied to psychic acts; the time relations of mental phenomena; mind in 
savages; practical applications, especially in the field of education. 
Experimental psychology.—Five hours a week during winter and spring terms. In 
this course is considered the relation problems of psychology to the methods of 
experiment and observations. Special attention is given to the study of the senses; 
of the time relations of mental phenomena; memory and association; mental sta- 
tistics; the psychophysic law; mental testsand standards. In the laboratory course 
each student verifies for himself the main facts treated in the course, while the more 
difficult experiments are reserved for demonstrations. Sanford’s Laboratory Course 
in Psychology is used. 
Advanced experimental psychology (laboratory course).—Six hours a week through- 
out the year. Inthis course special problems are treated and topics in the literature 
assigned. Original research and verification of important points form the main 
work. Each student takes up a special problem and prepares an account of the 
results of his work. These, when of sufficient value, are published in the American 
Journal of Psychology. One hour of each week is devoted to a consideration of the 
literature bearing most closely upon the problems under investigation. Each stu- 
dent is also expected to act as subject in other researches than his own. ’ 
Comparative psychology (fall term).—The course of mental development along th 
animal scale forms the chief topic, and in this the works of Romanes are followed. 
Some form of animal life is selected for special study, and observation is encouraged. 
The development of mental faculty in the human infant is constantly brought in for 
comparison with the animal development. 
Abnormal psychology (winter term).—The chief topics are, the criterion of the normal 
delusions and hallucinations, the chief forms of mental diseases; the diseases of lan- 
guage, of memory, of the will, of personality, dreams, hypnotism. 
Anthropological psychology (spring term).—The development of the human mind in 
the race, as illustrated by the history of human arts, customs, and beliefs. Tyler’s 
Anthropology is used as areference book, and the topics there treated may be taken 
as a fair index of the nature of the course.

1150 3 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
A philosophical club is formed, meeting fortnightly in theevening. Diseussions 
occupy a greater part of the time. Reviews of current literature are also a promi- 
nent feature in the exercises of the club. The number of students in the general 
course averages about 90 and the number doing special work varies from 6 to 12, 
but will probably increase under the group system, justinaugurated. The psy- 
chological laboratory is a pleasant room, 26} by 25} feet, well lighted from the north 
and east, A smaller room adjoining is used when needed, and closed cases furnish 
room for a greater part of the apparatus, while large and small tables, with drawers, 
give the working space required. 
- Among the pieces of standard apparatus the following might be named as typical 
‘and mostimportant: Timing—a Hippchronoscope, and metronomes, recording tam- 
bours, rotating drum, and tuning-forks. Vision—Snellen’s test type, Whéatstone and 
Brewster’s stereoscope, Hering’s apparatus for color mixture, book for exhibiting 
color contrast, Hering’s apparatus for quantitative tests for color blindness, Joy 
Jefirie’s color chart, and Holmgren’s colored worsteds. 
Anthropological.—_F &és dynamometer; apparatus for testing the sensitiveness to 
pain; scale for determining height, standing and sitting, and the span of the arms. 
Demonstration—apparatus illustrating the mechanism of the eye muscles; Hering’s 
stands for demonstrating color contrast; electrical induction coils; batteries and 
motors. 
Among special pieces of apparatus are the following: Apparatus for control of” 
the Hipp chronoscope; eleetric key used with the foregoing; the automatograph, 
apparatus for experimenting upon time, and also apparatus for determining error in 
judgment of vertical, horizontal, and other positions of lines. 
The laboratory of the university is used for three purposes—demonstrations, stu- 
dent work, and original research. As with other branches of science, students, 
when they care to do so, are started in research work very early in their course. 
The following are the subtitles of the more important results, all ef which have 
been published in the American Journal of Psychology: On the Psychophysic se- 
ries: Visual Extension, Tactual Motor Extension, The Perception of Space by Dis- 
parate Senses, On the Pressure Sense, On Just Observable Differences (Vol. 111, pp. 
43-58); The Effect of Foreknowledge upon Repetition-tunes, A Novel Optical Ilu- 
sion, Accessory Apparatus for Accurate Time Measurements, The Psychophysic Series 
and the Time Sense, The Physophysic Series and the Motor Sense (Vol. Iv, pp. 198- 
224); The Interference of Mental Processes; A Study of Zéllner’s Figures and other 
Related Ulusions, A Study of Involuntary Movements, Observations on the Absence 
of the Sense of Smell, Classification Time, Finding Time, Some Anthropometric 
Tests on Students (Vol. Iv, pp. 381-429); On the Judgment of Angles and Positions 
of Lines, On the Perception of Simultaneous Sense, Impressions. The Psychophysic 
Series as Applied to Lifted Weights (Vol. v, pp. 191-204). 
Besides amember of the standard works on psychology, the library of the uni- 
versity possesses files of several psychological journals and a number of smaller 
works on special topics. The growth of this portion of the library keeps pace with 
the growth of the library as a whole. 
YALE UNIVERSITY. 
The psychological laboratory occupies the second, third, and attic floors of a build- 
ing with a front of 24 feet and a depth of 64 feet for the first floor and 40 feet for the 
other two. In floor space it is as large as Wundt’s laboratory at Leipsic. It includes 
an office, a lecture room, a chronograph and galvanometer room, a finely equipped 
workshop with a screw-cutting lathe and tools of all kinds desired, a library and 
reading room, apparatus room, a seminary room, which is also used for research, one 
other research room, a battery room, chemical room, and a store room. 
The work done at the Yale laboratory naturally falls into three divisions—research, 
lecture instruction, and practical training. The research work has been made the 
prime object in the equipment of the laboratory, both as to rooms and apparatus. 
Six investigations are under way: (1) An e: sive research upon attention and 
the influence and interference of various sensations and ideas upon one another. In 
preparing for the measurement of the reaction time which is involved in the investi- 
gation, anew method of recording has been invented, which combines great ease 
and economy of time and labor, and at the same time does away with the sources of 
error in reading the records. (2) Aninvestigation of the rapidity of movements of 
the arm and hand carrying a pen in the various directions and under the various 
circumstances attending penmanship; a determination of the fatigue attendant on 
various methods of writing will follow. (3) The reaction time of tones asdependent 
upon pitch, intensity, and duration. (4) The time and fatigue of monocular accom- 
modation; this also has important educational bearings upon the use of blackboards 
and notebooks. (5) Electrical stimulation and sensation. (6) A mathematical and 
experimental treatment of the method of observational errors. The last two will

probably extend over two years. Another investigation of the sensitiveness of 
school children to differences in pitch and of their range of voice at various ages 
is about to be began. Possibly also a research upon the influence of unconscious 
elements upon the course of ideas will be undertaken, Instruction is given not only 
by lectures and sominaries, but opportunities for careful training are provided in 
the laboratory. The seminaries offer continual exercise in teaching various sections 
of psychology; while the workshop instruction, continual experimentation, and re- 
search provide the technical training. Ss s 
The courses of instruction may be outlined as follows: (1) Experimental and 
physiological psychology; experiments and lectures for seniors and graduates. (2) 
Laboratory course in psychology. This includes discussions and lectures by the 
students (graduates only) upon the methods of experimental psychology, their 
mathematical formation and their application; methods and standards of measure- 
ment; the mathematical and_ graphical expression of results, statistics, ete.; a 
thorough training by repeated exercises in carrying out these methods, (3) practical 
instruction in the manufacture and care of apparatus, including the elements of 
mechanical drawing, use of tools, lathe work, ete. (4.) A few lectures on laboratory 
economy. The main object of the course is to fully prepare men to take charge of in- 
» struction-in psychology. 
The large attendance of graduate students and the number of investigators at 
work have rather taxed the facilities that could be provided. There are 16 men and 
1 woman in the graduate laboratory course—an attendance exceeded in the graduate. 
department only by that on the general philosophical courses. 
All the principal psychological magazines and journals are found in the library.

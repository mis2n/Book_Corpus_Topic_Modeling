PREFACE 
[585-9 OYS are today regarded as educa- 
tional factors in the life of boys and 
| girls. New toys come into demand 
at frequent intervals in the growth 
and mental development of the child. On ac- 
count of the unfailing interest on the part of 
the pupils in toys and because of the unlimited 
educational possibilities contained in toy mak- 
ing, this work is rightfully taking an increas- 
ingly important place in the manual arts 
program in the schools. 
This book is the outgrowth of toy-making 
problems given to junior-high and high-school 
pupils. The author claims no originality for 
some of the toys. However, most of them 
have been originated or improved upon in the 
author’s classes. 
While it is entirely satisfactory to have any 
of the toys mentioned in this book made as 
individual projects, they are here offered as 
suitable group projects or production projects, 
and it is hoped that the suggested form of shop 
organization for production work as treated in    Part I is flexible enough so that the plan can 
be applied to most any shop conditions. 
The drawings of toys in Part II will suggest 
a variety of articles which may be used in 
carrying out the production work. 
Of course, the success of organizing and con- 
ducting classes for this kind of work depends 
largely upon the instructor. He must know 
definitely what he is trying to get done. He 
must adopt and pursue such methods of 
dealing with both the members of the class and 
the material as will contribute directly towards 
the desired end. 
Toy making carried on by the so-called pro- 
ductive plan, if handled properly, will bring 
out many of the essentials of an organization 
typical of the commercial industries. Together 
with its educational possibilities and its power 
to attract the attention of those engaged in 
this activity, toy making will rightfully take 
its place alongside other important subjects 
offered in a complete neessitHy course.

SUGGESTIONS 
Where the work is to be done on the so-called 
productive basis, it is of utmost importance 
that, before starting, the classes should be so 
organized as to allow the work to be carried 
on in the most efficient, progressive manner. 
The form of shop organization suggested in this 
book is recommended. However, the instructor 
may, particularly if he has had good practical 
shop experience, employ other methods of 
organization that are just as good and possibly 
even better for his particular class and the 
conditions under which he has to work. 
It is also of great importance that the 
instructor should acquaint himself with the 
processes involved in the making of each toy 
before allowing the class to begin it. This may 
be accomplished by the making of a sample of 
the contemplated project, carefully analyzing 
its different parts and arranging the operations 
in a logical sequence. This phase of the work 
may be done during class discussions and 
demonstrations at which time the different jigs 
and fixtures needed for progressive production 
may also be developed. TO TEACHERS 
The different methods of coloring toys have 
been suggested with the hope that the student 
will gain a realization of the importance of 
finishing, from both the artistic and the practi- 
cal point of view. The application of paint by 
means of compressed air is the latest develop- 
ment in the coloring of toys, and an equipment 
in the school shop illustrating the principles of 
compressed air as applied to productive finish- 
ing of toys, isa step forward in making school 
shops function as they should. 
The working drawings in this book should 
serve as suggestions. They have been so con- 
structed as to be free from unnecessary techni- 
calities, and to leave as much opportunity as 
possible for the exercise and development of the 
student’s judgment. 
It will be found that toy making offers itself 
readily to the desired co-operation and correla- 
tion with other departments in the school. For 
instance, the art department may aid with the 
designing and color scheme to be used on toys; 
the general metal shop may help in the making 
of necessary metal parts; the mechanical
-P-A-G-E-6
TOY MAKING   
drawing department can co-operate in the mak- 
ing of working drawings; the mathematics 
department can figure the costs of production, 
etc., etc. 
It is hoped that the purpose of this book is | 
not merely to set forth a few plans and draw- ings for the construction of toys, but to give 
the work the broadest possible application ; 
creating a constructive influence on the minds 
of the students, in which case'it will also act as 
a means of bringing into closer relationship their 
life outside of school with the work in school.

CHAPTER I 
Propuctive Work 
1. Suggested Plan for Shop Organization.— 
While it is entirely satisfactory to have any of 
the toys mentioned in this book made as 
individual projects, they are here offered as 
suitable group projects or production projects. 
Production work may be defined as work done 
by a class to turn out a number of similar pro- 
jects that have a marketable value, with the 
aid of jigs, fixtures, and other means of duplica- 
tion, illustrating the industrial or practical 
application to the tasks in hand, Figs. 1, 2, and 
3. This does not mean, however, that the 
school shops be transformed into a factory in 
the full sense of the word. It should differ from 
a factory in that the education of the student is 
the major part of the product, while in the 
factory production is the foremost aim. 
11 In doing work by the productive plan two 
important problems will present themselves at 
the outset; first, the time element; and second, 
industrial or practical application to the tasks in 
hand. 
A brief explanation of the plan of organization 
in one of the author’s classes will attempt to 
show how nearly these problems can be solved. 
2. Grouping of Students.—Classes are divided 
into groups of between four and six boys, with 
a boy foreman appointed at the head of each 
group. The foreman is held responsible for the 
work turned out by his boys. He is to see that 
they understand just what is to be done and 
how it is to be done. All the group foremen are 
directly responsible to the general foreman who 
in turn is responsible to the instructor. The

general foreman is to act as an inspector of 
finished work after it has received the group 
foreman’s O. K. He is also held responsible for 
the condition of the shop during his class hour. This includes looking after all material, the 
manner in which stock is put away after class, 
and adherence to all shop rules that have been 
adopted tohelpin the efficiency of shop procedure,

3. The Time Clerk and Tool-Room Clerk.— 
A “Time Clerk” is appointed to take charge of 
the time cards. He is also held responsible for 
all the clerical work that is to be done in the 
shop. 
A Tool-Room Clerk is appointed to take charge 
of the shop tool room. He is to keep check of all tools given out and taken in. His spare 
time should be devoted to the care of tools. 
If possible, each boy in the class should be 
given an opportunity to act in each capacity 
that has been created, so that he may get the 
most varied experience in shop procedure. This 
will necessitate the changing of boys from one

governed by the size of the class and the num- 
ber of hours devoted to the work. 
4. Recording Attendance.—Boys, upon enter- 
ing the shop, register their presence at the 
Time-Card Rack, Fig. 4. This is done by 
turning the time card shown in Fig. 5, so that the back side, which has the word present 
printed at top, is exposed. The time clerk then 
inspects the cards and notes those that have 
not been turned, and records the absences. He 
then fills in the date and passes the cards out 
to the boys in the shop. Toward the latter part 
of the period, a few minutes time is given the 
boys to fill in the necessary data on the time card. 
     
   
   
      
-P-A-G-E-12
PRODUCTIVE WORK 15 
The time cards are then collected by the time 
clerk and put into a box where the time cards 
of all the classes are kept. In the meantime 
the time clerk puts back into the time rack 
the cards of the incoming class. This duty is 
performed by the time clerks of all the classes, 
thereby necessitating the use of only one time 
card rack. 
5. Time Cards.—Referring to the time card 
mentioned in Fig. 5 it will be seen that the 
workman’s shop number is filled in at the top. 
Then under the heading of ‘Woodworking 
Department” are two horizontal rows of items 
which need very little explanation. Following 
are three columns headed ‘‘Operation,” ‘‘As- 
signment,” and “Time.” Below the word 
“Operation” are set down the various opera- 
tions undertaken in the woodworking depart- 
ment, with several vacant spaces provided 
where other and special operations can be filled 
in. It will also be noticed that ‘‘Operations” 
are divided into two kinds, machine work and 
bench work. The instructor’s glance at the time 
eard will tell him at once what phase of the 
work the boy has been employed in and will

help him in apportioning the work so that the 
boy is offered a varied experience.
-P-A-G-E-13
16 TOY MAKING 
  
6. Using Time Card.—For shops that are not 
equipped with the kind of machines marked on 
the illustrated card, it would be well to omit 
the names of machines in the “operation” 
column. The instructor may then fill in the 
operation whatever it may be. 
Under the heading “‘Assignment”’ and against 
the operation which is to be undertaken by the 
student, the instructor writes in the name of the 
part to be made. This is the student’s assign- 
ment and it should be read by him at the time 
he records his presence at the time-card rack 
upon entering the shop. 
In making assignments, the instructor may 
find it rather difficult to keep up with large 
classes of boys. This difficulty may be over- 
come by making an assignment to an entire 
group instead of to each boy. For example, ina 
class of twenty-five that would probably be 
divided into five groups, the instructor may 
make the assignment to the foreman of each 
group and each foreman in turn can inform the 
boys of his group as to the nature of the assign- 
ment. The boys can then enter the assignment 
on their time cards at the end of the period 
when the time spent on the job at hand is also recorded. 
The student’s shop number, name, and grade 
should be filled in by the time clerk who can 
get out a number of cards for each student in 
advance and these are kept ready for use by the 
instructor. The instructor can then mark the 
project and the job number together with the 
student’s assignment. At the same time he 
estimates the journeyman’s time and rate and 
enters them in the space provided. 
The time card in Fig. 5, is 3144 inches by 9 
inches, made of three-ply bristol board. All 
worker’s cards are printed on white colored 
bristol while those of the foremen are of blue 
colored bristol. This plan is for the instructor’s 
convenience to be able to pick out the foremen’s 
time cards at a glance. 
In the triple column under the heading 
“TIME” is provided room for the date and 
spaces in which the student can write the time 
in minutes spent on the various operations on 
that date. The triple columns on each side of 
the card allow of the cards being used for six 
days. Ifa job lasts longer than six days another 
card should be used marking them No. 1 and
-P-A-G-E-14
PRODUCTIVE WORK 
No. 2, respectively, in the space marked “Card 
No.” Both cards should be fastened and kept 
together. 
Effort should always be made to have all the 
assignments short (less than six days) so that 
the student’s record may be computed at the 
end of each week by the time clerk. 
7. Grading Students—The next four spaces 
contain in condensed form, the information 
itemized in other parts of the card. This, 
together with other information set down by 
the instructor, is the vital material sought for. 
The item A “Journeyman’s Time” is very 
easily recorded by the instructor. It is arrived 
at in the same way as in making out the estimate 
for any piece of work and can be recorded almost 
at once. The main purpose here is to set for 
the student a standard of time on which to 
work. 
The item B is the rate in points per hour, 
based on the journeyman’s time. 
The item C is the total of the student’s time 
added together from the various spaces under 
“Time.” 
Item D ‘Quality Decimal’ is the quality of 
the student’s job expressed in the form of a

decimal, with 100% as the maximum. This 
mark should be filled in by the instructor when 
the student completes his job. 
The next item, the number of points the 
student earns is found by the formula Points 
=(AXB)D 
Points earned per hour =(A XB)D 
Cc 
For example, a student receives an assign- 
ment to cut to thickness, width, and length, 
sixty chair legs. The size of the legs he is to 
get from the job blueprint. He spends 60 
minutes a day, for three days, making a total 
of 180 minutes or 3 hours. The time it would 
take a journeyman to do the same job is 
estimated at 2 hours. The rate adopted is at 
80 points per hour; the journeyman therefore 
earns A XB =2 x80 =160 Points. The quality of 
the student’s job is graded by the instructor as 
75%. The number of points the student earns 
is found by the formula Points =(A xB)D = 
(280).75 =120 Points. To find the number of 
points the student earns per hour, divide 120 
points by the number of hours it took the 
student to complete the job, which equals 
120+3=40, the number of points the stu- dent earns per hour. However, if the student 
would be graded 100%, he would earn the

same number of points as the journeyman. 
But of course, he would have done it in 
three hours where the journeyman has earned
-P-A-G-E-16
  
the same number of points in two hours. It will 
readily be seen that this scheme offers the 
student an everlasting incentive to equal the 
journeyman’s record. 
Having obtained the points on the time card 
or assignment card as it may be called, these 
are then transferred to a monthly accomplish- 
ment sheet as shown in Fig. 6, which is provided 
for all the students in all classes. 
The total number of points for each boy, 
group, and class can then be easily obtained. 
These totals can be put up in poster form 
and hung on the shop’s bulletin board, showing 
the standing of each boy, group, and class. 
It is surprising the amount of interest and com- 
petition that can be aroused; everyone working 
for the highest honors, unconsciously, with a 
competitive spirit that will bring out consider- 
able thought and effort to the matter of hand- 
ling material for maximum production. 
8. Preliminary Discussion and Preparation for 
Shopwork.—Of course, no time card or assign- 
ment-record scheme can hope entirely to elim- 
inate the necessary preliminary discussions and 
preparation. The author has found it of 
material help to meet the foremen of all the PRODUCTIVE WORK 19 
classes at hours other than their regular class 
hour and discuss such topics as “Securing 
Cooperation,” “Instructing Workers,”’ ‘‘Main- 
taining Cleanliness and Order,” ‘Records and 
Reports,” “Inspecting Work,” ‘Routing Ma- 
terial Thru Shop,” ‘Care of Stock,” ete. 
Details regarding construction and assem- 
bling should be worked out by the instructor 
beforehand, and also developed with the class 
as the work progresses. Care should be taken 
that plans are carefully made regarding the 
storage of stock and unfinished parts. 
The old saying, “‘An ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure,” is an old one, but a 
good one. 
9. Bazaars, Toy Sales, Etc.—The plan of sell- 
ing toys, that are made in the school shop, to 
the boys and girls of the school is a plausible 
one. It can very easily be accomplished in the 
form of bazaars, exhibition, , or school toy sales. 
The writer has had a number of samples of 
different toys made and put on exhibition, 
and orders taken, requiring a deposit on each 
order. These were then turned in to the shop 
department and the toys made on the produc- 
tive plan.
-P-A-G-E-17
20 TOY MAKING 
The boys in the shop would receive school 
checks, Fig. 7, for the total number of points that 
they earned for the semester. These checks 
could then be used by them towards the pur- shop. For example, twenty-four orders for 
toy milk wagons were received by a class of 
twenty-four boys. Then instead of making 
twenty-four toy milk wagons we doubled the

chasing of any of the toys that were put on 
sale; a certain number of points required for the 
purchase of different toys. 
This plan was made possible by adding on to 
the number of orders received an additional 
number equal to the number of boys in the

the boys would be able to buy with their 
earned checks.

CHAPTER II 
Couorine Toys 
10. Sanitation Emphasized.—All application of 
color to toys should carry with it a realization 
that toys are meant primarily for children and 
that all paints should therefore be free from 
poisonous compounds. 
All paints used should be of good quality so 
that it will not come off easily to discolor the 
hands or tongues of children who cannot resist 
the temptation of sticking everything possible 
into their mouths. 
11. Preparation of Surfaces—Wooden toys 
may be finished quite bright and in various 
colors. 
Before applying the color it is absolutely 
necessary that every part of the toy has been 
thoroly sanded. Where sanding is done by 
machine, care should be taken not to sand the 
wood too much. Many difficulties may arise 
from too much as well as from too little sanding. 
In hand sanding, the use of a block 2144” 314”, 
to which is glued a piece of cork, isrecommended. 
21 12. Application of Water Colors.—Toys may be 
colored by the use of different materials and by 
various methods. Kalsomine colors, opaque 
water colors, variously known as show card 
colors, liquid tempera, and letterine,—all come 
under the heading of water colors. All but the 
kalsomine may be obtained in small jars and 
ready for use. Kalsomine colors come in powder 
form in various colors and may easily be pre- 
pared by mixing with water and a little glue to 
bind the parts together. They are much 
cheaper than the ordinary forms of transparent 
and opaque water colors. They may be applied 
with the ordinary water color brushes. 
After a coat of water color has been applied 
to the toy, it may be necessary to remove the 
rough parts with very fine sand paper. Care 
should be taken not to ‘‘cut thru” when sanding. 
To preserve and protect the water color on 
the toy a coat of white shellac may be applied. 
If a more durable finish is desired a coat of 
good clear varnish over the shellac will serve the 
purpose.
-P-A-G-E-19
22 TOY MAKING   
13. Analine Water Stains.—For general finish- 
ing of toys analine water stains will produce 
excellent results. They are known for their 
ability to penetrate the wood deeply and the 
ease with which any shade can be produced. 
Water stain raises the grain of the wood more 
than any other. This makes it necesary to 
sandpaper down the raised grain until smooth 
and then proceed with the shellacking and 
varnishing until the desired results are ob- 
tained. 
In preparing analine water stains, only ana- 
lines that are soluble in water are used. Place 
an ounce of the analine to a quart of hot or 
boiling water, pouring the water over the dye- 
stuff and stirring meanwhile with a wooden 
paddle or stick. Soft water is the best. In 
about an hour the dye may be filtered thrua 
piece of fine woven cloth. As metal is apt to 
discolor the dye, it is better to use a glass con- 
tainer. If the prepared solution is too strong 
it may be diluted in more water. Use hot 
water for diluting the stain. 
The work with water stain must be done 
quickly in order to obtain a uniform coloring 
on the surface. Water stains are used a great deal where the dipping process is employed in 
the finishing of toys. A hot dipping stain is 
preferable to a cold dipping stain, first, because 
it penetrates more readily and second, because 
it dries quicker.

diluted with water. The rule is, an ounce of 
analine to the gallon of water to form a working 
stain. Or to a pint of the stock solution, as 
it is called, you may add three pints of water. 
15. Oil Stains—It will be found that quicker 
work can be done with oil stain than with water 
colors. For that reason, oil stains are also 
used a great deal as a dipping stain. In prepar- 
ing oil stains, the best mineral or earth pig- 
ments to dissolve with turpentine are Van Dyke 
brown, chrome green, burnt and raw sienna, and 
lamp black. 
16. Shellacking—There are two kinds of shel- 
lac, orange and white. The white shellac is 
orange shellac that has been bleached. The 
purpose of shellac as commonly understood is 
to give a quick coat over the stain. The thin 
coat formed serves as a protector for the stain 
and also as an undercoater for the following coat 
of varnish. In this way at least one coat of 
varnish is eliminated and a great deal of time 
saved because the shellac dries within a few 
minutes. To thin shellac use denatured alcohol. 
On cheaper toys a coat of shellac only may be 
used as a covering for the color stain. If orange 
shellac is used it will be found that it effects   
the color of the stain used. White shellac also 
produces a slight change in color and for this 
reason many working with toys will use a good 
clear varnish instead. 
17. Varnishing—Two or three coats of varn- 
ish will produce a very durable finish. The first 
coat of varnish ought not be quite as heavy as 
the succeeding coats. If the varnish is of extra 
heavy body it should be reduced slightly for the 
first coat. The best varnish reducer is thin 
varnish. To prepare this reducer, take one part 
varnish (the same varnish to be reduced), and 
two parts of turpentine. Shake these together 
well and let stand twenty-four hours before 
using. This will reduce the consistency of the 
varnish without tearing down the body as pure 
turpentine would. The first coat of varnish 
should be allowed to dry thoroly before the 
second coat is applied. 
Oil varnishes made from good hard gums, 
pure linseed oil, and turpentine, are the most 
valuable. In using turpentine to thin varnish 
care should be taken that adulterated turpen- 
tine is not used. To play the game safe it is 
advisable to use a little benzine, for it will not 
injure the varnish, but will evaporate entirely,
-P-A-G-E-21
24 TOY MAKING 
and not flatten the varnish as turpentine does. 
18. Points on Varnishing.—(1) The less varn- 
ish is worked under the brush the better its 
luster. (2) Use clean brush and pot, and clean 
varnish. See that the surface is clean before 
beginning to varnish. (3) Allow a coat of 
varnish plenty of time for drying until it be- 
comes hard. 
19. Colored Varnish.—Colored varnish is that 
in which a proportion of varnish is added to the 
pigment and thinned. The base is usually an 
earth color such as ochre, sienna, venitian red, 
Van Dyke brown, umber, lamp black, etc. 
With this the work can be done in one coat. 
This method of finishing is usually employed 
on the cheaper class of toys where it isn’t 
advisable to apply an expensive finish. 
20. Another Suggestion for Finishing —Tint a 
gallon of benzine or gasoline with chrome green, 
chrome yellow, and vermilion, ground in Japan 
until the desired shade is obtained. This 
formulae is especially good for dipping purposes. 
21. Use of Paint—Although paint can be 
bought ready prepared and in any color, as has 
been stated, it is advisable to have the students mix their own colors and choose their own color 
scheme. 
22. Ingredients of good Paint—The best 
paints are usually made by mixing together 
white lead, linseed oil, pigment of the desired 
color (colors ground in oil), and a drier. 
While white lead is sufficient as the pigment 
for white paint, a better result is obtained by 
mixing zine oxide with the white lead. These 
two substances have the convenient property 
of balancing each other’s disadvantages. For 
instance, zinc oxide has a tendency to crack and 
to peal, which is overcome by the tougher 
coating formed by the white lead. Again, when 
white lead is exposed to light and weathering, it 
becomes chalky, which fault is remedied by the 
property possessed by zine oxide, of remaining 
hard. 
The linseed oil used is obtained from flaxseed 
by pressing the thoroly ground seed. About 
twenty-three gallons of oil can be obtained from 
one bushel of the seed. By boiling the oil with 
lead oxide or manganese oxide it can take more 
oxygen from the air, and thereby its drying 
powers are increased. 
Driers are substances that absorb oxygen
-P-A-G-E-22
COLORING Toys 25 
from the air and give part of it to the oil. The 
raw linseed oil absorbs the oxygen from the air 
very slowly, but the addition of turpentine is a 
great aid in overcoming this defect. 
To insure the best results in painting, one 
must first consider the kind and condition of the 
surface to be painted, and to what use the toy 
will be put; then decide on the proper composi- 
tion and consistency of the paint. 
23. Application of Paint—In applying the 
paint to the toy the first coat should be thinned. 
This will act as a primer or undercoat for the 
succeeding coats of paint. Care should be taken 
that plenty of time is allowed between coats 
for the paint to dry thoroly. Three coats of 
paint will produce a good finish. 
24, Preparation of surface—All woodwork 
must be sanded and thoroly dry before any 
paint is applied. Care should be taken to see 
that all knots and sappy streaks shall be covered 
with a coat of orange shellac. Then apply the 
first coat. 
After the priming coat of paint is thoroly 
dry, putty up all knot holes, dents, cracks, and 
other defects in the surface with a pure linseed 
oil putty composed of equal parts of white lead and whiting. When putty is dry, proceed with 
the other coats. 
25. Tinting Materials—Formulas for making 
tints are to be followed only in a general way. 
Make some allowance for slight variations in 
the strength and tone of different makes of 
colors. Chromes and ochres vary noticeably. 
Weigh out your color and add it gradually, not 
all at once, noting the effect as you go. When 
you reach the desired shade, stop, regardless of 
what the formula calls for. Turpentine and dark 
driers will slightly alter shades. Make allow- 
ance for this. 
26. Mixing Paints.—Faulty mixing, even with 
the best of materials, is not likely to make dur- 
able paint. The important thing is to give the 
lead and oil achance to incorporate themselves 
in that close union which they always make if 
allowed to do so. The following directions give 
best results. The order is important. 
(1) Break up the white lead with a paddle, 
using only enough oil to bring it to the con- 
sistency of colors in oil. 
(2) Add your colors for tinting. Coloring 
matter added after the paint has been thinned is 
likely to break up in lumps which leave streaks
-P-A-G-E-23
26 TOY MAKING       
when brushed out. 
(3) Put in drier. 
(4) Add remainder of oil, stirring well. 
(5) Last of all, put in turpentine. 
Thinners help only the flow of the paint 
never the quality. 
To strain paint thru cheese cloth before 
using will be a safeguard against lumpy colors 
and streakiness. Paint also spreads further if 
strained. 
27. Paint Formulas—As most toys are ex- 
posed to the weather a great deal, the following 
formulas are recommended. ‘These take no 
account of tinting materials. 
(a) Priming Coat: 
25 pounds pure white lead 
1 gallon pure raw linseed oil 
1% gallon pure turpentine 
Y pint drier, free from rosin 
(b) Body Coat: 
25 pounds pure white lead 
3/8 gallon pure raw linseed oil 
3/8 gallon pure turpentine 
Vy pint drier, free from rosin 
(c) Finishing Coat: 
25 pounds pure white lead 1 gallon pure raw linseed oil 
14 pint pure turpentine 
Yy pint drier. 
One must exercise his own discretion in using 
a larger or smaller quantity of oil according to 
whether the wood is oil absorbing, as white 
pine, poplar, and basswood, or less permeable, 
as yellow pine, cypress, spruce, and hemlock. 
28. Formulas for Making Tinted Paint.— 
Any color or tint may be obtained by varying 
the addition of tinting colors. These tinting 
colors are called “colors in oil.” The colors 
should be added to the white lead before the 
paint is thinned. 
To twenty-five pounds of white lead ground 
in oil add colors in oil as follows: 
Medium Blue Slate 314 oz. lamp black 
Gray, Bluew y.G. 14 oz. lamp black

Where tinting colors are used in sufficiently 
large quantities to alter the consistency of the 
paint, add one-half as much linseed oil and 
turpentine, by weight, as you add tinting 
material. 29. Enameling—When using enamel as a 
finish for toys, care should be taken that the 
surface of the toy is in proper condition. To 
obtain good results proceed as follows: Give the 
wood a coat of shellac. Sand lightly and dust. 
The following coat should consist of part of 
white paint and one part of the enamel to be 
used. This coat should be slightly tinted with 
the finishing color, if the finishing coat is not 
white. Allow twenty-four hours for drying 
thoroly; then sand with No. OO sand paper. 
Next apply a coat of enamel of the color desired 
for the finished work. (Enamels may be tinted 
with colors ground in oil.) 
Should the enamel not work freely, add a 
spoonful of benzine to a gallon of enamel. Tur- 
pentine may also be used as a thinner for 
enamel. 
A better finish of enamel consists of two coats 
of paint before applying the enamel. This gives 
it a stronger body and of course makes it more 
durable. 
Because of its durability and for sanitary 
reasons enamel is the most desirable finish for 
toys. Its glossy finish is attractive and very 
appealing to children.

28 TOY MAKING 
30. The Dipping Method.—When a considera- 
ble quantity of toys is to be finished, the prob- 
lem to be faced will be the cost of application of 
the paint rather than the cost of the paint 
itself. The dipping process, (immersing the 
material to be covered) is found to be the most 
successful, especially in toy making, where so 
many small parts are used. 
Many of the small pieces made can be sub- 
jected to the dipping process at quite a saving 
of time and labor, with probably better results 
than where the application of paint or stain is 
done with a brush. 
The success of the dipping process depends on 
the arrangement adopted for holding the toys 
while the actual dipping is done and while they 
are drying. Here the exercise of a little ingenu- 
ity on the part of the students and teacher, will 
overcome most difficulties. 
Supposing that a number of checkers, or 
handles, or small wheels are to be stained. A 
dipping frame as shown in Fig. 8 could very 
easily be prepared. You will notice the screen 
tray (which is removable), and the tin sheet 
F . slopes towards the container. The small 
pieces to be stained can be handled in wire bas- 
wk kets with mesh just small enough so that the 
pieces will not fall thru. 
The wire basket is then immersed in the con- 
tainer and worked up and down, so that the 
liquid will penetrate and touch all pieces. It 
is then pulled up and swung over the screen 
tray, where the contents of the wire basket is 
dumped. Here, the superfluous paint will drip 
off on the tin sheet, which, because of its slope, 
will cause the superfluous paint to flow back 
in to the container. Fig. 9 shows the dipping 
frame in use. 
The screen tray can be removed and placed in 
a rack to allow for further drying. Several 
trays could then be made and arack to hold them 
could very easily be constructed. 
The paint used for dipping purposes must so 
be prepared that too much does not run off or 
too much stay on, for this is surely one way to 
spoil the work. It should be thinned to the 
right consistency and care should be taken that 
the thinners used are of the best quality. 
Where larger pieces of work are to be dipped, 
wire attachments could be devised and each 
part hung separately over the dipping frame 
until ready to be placed in a rack. If the wire

COLORING TOYS 31 ee 
attachment forms a hook on one end, it will be 
possible to hang up the toy until drained and 
dried. In removing the toy from the paint it 
should be drawn out very slowly so that the 
surface of the paint may be left as smooth as 
possible. 
Where one desires line effects on toys, these 
may be lined in afterwards with a small size 
striping brush or sign painter’s pencil. 
31. Polishing by Tumbling.—Excellent results 
in polishing large quantities of small pieces, 
may be obtained by tumbling. The material 
to be polished should be thoroly dry. The 
parts are then placed in a tumbler as shown in 
Fig. 10. Cut up paraffine wax into small pieces, 
using about one-fourth pound to each tumbler 
full of toys. Allow these to tumble several 
hours. This will distribute the wax evenly over 
the parts and produce a polished surface. 
The tumbler as shown in Fig. 10 is turned by 
hand, altho it could very easily be placed in a 
lathe, where one is available. 
32, Care of Brushes.—A suitable place should 
j be provided for brushes that are not in use. A 
tin-lined keeper is recommended. Brushes 
should be suspended so that their bristles will not touch the bottom of the keeper, and have the 
liquid in which they are kept come well up over 
the bristles, so that none of the paint or varnish 
may dry in the butt of the brush. 
33. Paint Application by Means of Compressed 
Air.—In recent years, great advancement has 
been made in the application of paint by means 
of compressed air. The early use of pneumatic 
painting equipment was confined almost ex- 
clusively to the application of finishing materials 
such as japans, enamels, lacquers, varnishes, 
etc., on manufactured products. But in the 
past few years improvements have been made 
which eliminate all of the difficulties originally 
experienced and make possible the use of this 
method for interior and exterior painting, such 
as buildings, ships, etc.; and at present, a large 
portion of factory maintenance work is done in 
this manner. Excessive fumes have been 
eliminated and all materials can be applied 
without removing the volatile thinners, solvents, 
binders, ete., thru air reduction. This is 
brought about thru the use of low pressure and 
the perfection of ingenious patent nozzles and 
other improvements.

COLORING TOYS 33 
34. Uses of Pneumatic Sprayers.—Pneumatic 
paint sprayers, or air brushes, are extensively 
used in the manufacture of toys, furniture, 
automobile bodies, sewing machines, telephones, 
electrical equipment; in fact, very nearly all 
manufactured products, as well as on ships, 
structural steel and iron work, bridges and 
buildings. 
The speed of the air brush is very great com- 
pared with hand-brush work. Usually, an air- 
brush operator will accomplish as much in one 
hour as a hand or bristle-brush worker will in 
one day; and it is possible to obtain an even 
coating, free from sags, runs or brush-marks 
and bettter results are obtained than with the 
hand brush method. A film of paint can be 
applied in one operation equal to two hand- 
brush coats, as it is not necessary to reduce 
paints by thinning as much for air brush appli- 
cation, in a great many instances, as is the usual 
practice for hand-brushing. The air sprayer 
can also reach places inaccessible to the hand 
brush, and a perfect coat can be applied over 
rough, uneven surfaces, which could not be 
obtained by hand-brushing. 
In considering pneumatic painting equipment, the most important thing to be kept in mind is 
the proper application of materials. This can 
be successfully accomplished only thru the use 
of compressed air at low pressures. By this is 
meant using only sufficient main-line air to lay 
the paint, enamel, varnish or whatever finish 
may be used, on the object. Excessive pressure 
results in fumes, waste of material and air reduc- 
tion taking place. By air reduction is meant 
the removal of the more volatile solvents, thin- 
ners, binders, etc., thru evaporation, and the 
material thus loses its adherent and coherent 
properties. 
Both types of air-brush equipment illustrated 
here require three cubic feet of air per minute 
to operate and the pressure necessary depends 
on the density, consistency or viscosity of the 
material used. For example, undercoaters, 
japans, etc.; require from twelve to fifteen 
pounds of pressure to apply perfectly; while 
enamels and varnishes take from eighteen to 
twenty-five pounds. Water stains require about 
five pounds of pressure. 
35. Construction of Pneumatic Painting Outfit.— 
A pneumatic painting outfit for finishing work 
consists essentially of an air brush, either of the
-P-A-G-E-31
34 TOY MAKING   
attached-container type or the gun-type with 
separate paint tank, and a small compressor of 
sufficient capacity to operate the air brush, 
which can be belt-driven from shafting or direct 
connected. An exhaust hood with fan, for the 
removal of fumes, is advisable where the opera- 
tion is reasonably continuous and especially 
where lacquers are used. The paint, ready for 
application, is poured into the tank; and the 
compressed air line leads to the tank with a 
branch line for air and paint from the tank to 
the nozzle of the gun type of machine; while only 
the air line is required with the attached- 
container type. 
The air hose used is 3” in diameter while 
the paint or fluid hose is the same size. The 
paint hose is made of a special compound to 
resist the action of the thinners, solvents, etc., 
used in the paint; and it is important to have 
this correct, so that the lining will not disin- 
tegrate and clog the air brush or gun. 
Fig. 11 shows a five-gallon container type. 
It will be noticed that the fluid connection is 
nearest the nozzle and that the air connection is 
at the bottom of the grip. 36. Special Attachments for Different Surfaces.— 
A cone nozzle is furnished for painting irregular 
surfaces and a fan nozzle for wide, flat work. 
Adjusting and locking the nozzle regulates the 
degree of atomization. The jets of the fan 
nozzle are depressed to prevent being knocked 
out of alignment. Final regulation of the flow 
of material is made on the back of the gun, 
independent of the pressure on the material con- 
tainer. A wide variety of adjustment is possi- 
ble with this positive regulation. 
The first pull on the trigger gives air only, 
which can be used for dusting ahead of the 
work; and as the trigger is released, the air 
valve closes last, which prevents clogging and 
dripping. When adjustments have been made 
the trigger action is the only moving part of 
the machine. Figs. 12 and 13 show the five- 
gallon container type in actual use. 
37. Cleaning Pneumatic Machines.—It is not 
necessary to take the gun apart nor disconnect 
the hose to clean the machine. Thinner can 
be run thru the device without loss by placing 
a small can of reducer of the last material used 
in the machine, and forcing it thru in the usual 
manner.

9. Spraying pressure and pressure in the 
container depends upon the density of the 
material used and the size of the surface to be 
coated. A little experimenting on the part of 
the operator will determine the best pressure to 
use. When the fan nozzle is used, 3 to 5 Ibs. 
more pressure should be applied to the material 
container and from 5 to 8 lbs. more atomizing 
or spraying pressure used. 
Fig. 14 shows a complete attached container 
which operates on identically the same princi- 
ples as the type shown in Fig. 11. It consists 
of a 114 pint container, reducing outfit, com- 
pressor, and air tank. The 114 pint container 
as shown in Fig. 15 is supplied complete with 
two fluid tips, gasket, agitator tube, cup-holder, 
hose union, and six feet of air hose. 
The reducing outfit in Fig. 16 consists of a 
regulative valve, an air gage, and an air filter, 
complete with connections and fittings. This 
outfit is for the purpose of maintaining an even 
low spraying pressure.

tight material container, raising the coating

The spraying pressure necessarily depends on 
the density, consistency and viscosity of the 
material used. 
For fine finishing work, where the quantity of 
materials used each day is not great, or where 
the colors are changed frequently, the attached 
container type is recommended. 40. Preparing Colors.—The three primary col- 
ors are red, blue and yellow. With the three 
primary colors at hand, almost every variety of 
color desirable for ordinary use can be easily 
prepared. Fig. 17 shows a color chart.

41. Economy in Selecting Material—Economic 
use of materials should be encouraged at all 
times. Toy making offers an excellent oppor- 
tunity where economy may be taught in the 
most practical way. 
Where toys are to be painted, more than one 
kind of wood may be used in the same toy and 
thereby using up small pieces of wood that 
would otherwise be called scrap. Yet, it is not 
advisable to sacrifice the strength and durability 
of the whole toy for the sake of using up a 
piece of scrap wood which weakens the particu- 
lar part of the toy where it is used. For that, 
in the long run, is not economy. 
42. Qualities of Different Woods Used.—The 
following are some of the common woods used 
in toy making. 
Maple: hard, fine grained, compact, tough, 
used for wheels, axles, handles, dowel rods, ete. 
Ash: white, strong, open grained, easily 
worked; used for bodies of coasters, wheels, 
axles, oars, etc. 
Oak: hard, firm and compact, strong and 
42 durable, hard to work. 
Birch: moderately hard and heavy, even 
grained; difficult to split, but easily worked. 
Chestnut: resembles oak in appearance, is 
much softer, moderately hard, course grained, 
not strong, but durable. 
Cypress: moderately hard, very fine and 
close grained, virtually indestructable; known 
as “the wood eternal’”’. 
Basswood: white, light, soft, tough, closed 
grained, easily worked, not strong, but durable; 
used for almost any part of a toy where much 
strength is not required: 
White Pine: very light, soft, close and 
straight grained, inferior; easy to work. 
Yellow Pine, yellowish, grain noticeable, 
harder than white pine, stronger. 
Tulip (yellow poplar): light, soft, close and 
straight grained; tougher than many woods 
equally soft, compact, not very strong or 
durable, easily worked.

Uss or Jias AND FIxTURES 
43. Value of Jigs and Fixtures.—The use of 
jigs, fixtures, and other labor-saving devices is 
an important factor in illustrating industrial 
and practical applications in the school shop. 
It is advisable to let each group of boys work 
out its own jig or fixture for the particular job 
they have on hand. 
The three most common forms of jigs are 
cutting jigs, boring jigs, and assembling jigs. 
The important reasons for the use of such 
devices are: (1) They illustrate the speed of 
output in shop work. (2) They give the 
student a good idea of machine operation. 
(3) They help in making the parts interchange- 
able. (4) They offer an opportunity for getting 
first hand information on cutting edge tools and 
their proper uses. (5) They show the boy the 
value of the use of jigs in factory work. 
The toys illustrated in this book have many 
simple operations, such as cutting stock to 
length, drilling holes, surfacing, etc., that can 
be easily done by the use of the proper fixtures. 
43 For that reason toys are desirable projects to 
be made by the productive plan. Fig. 18 shows 
the use of a jig and the miter box. 
44. Cutting Small Wheels.—A circle of the de- © 
sired size wheel may be laid out on the wood 
with the aid of a compass, and cut in the out- 
line with a coping saw or band saw. Of course, 
it would take quite a long time by this method 
to make the small wheels in large quantities and 
besides the result would not be as good as when 
the wheels are made by machine. 
45. Turning Wheels——Another way to pro- 
duce wheels is to turn a cylinder to the required 
diameter, on the turning lathe. Then cut the 
cylinder on the circular saw into required 
thicknesses of wheels desired. This method is 
recommended for quick work. 
If it is desired to round the end of wheels the 
operation can be done by leaving the cylinder 
in the lathe and applying the broad side of the 
skew chisel as shown in Fig. 33. The wheels 
may then be polished with a cloth after they
-P-A-G-E-41

-P-A-G-E-42
USE OF JIGS AND FLXTURES 45   
have been sanded and while rotating in the lathe 
as shown in Fig. 34. In sanding, use first a 
fairly course grade of sandpaper, No. 1 or 14, 
and afterwards a fine grade, No. O or OO. 
Before applying the cloth the wood may be 
varnished lightly while the lathe is not running, 
taking care to wipe off all the surplus varnish. 
The varnish will assist in giving the surface a 
fine polish when the cloth is applied. For 
further explanations of the use of the turning 
lathe, see Sec. 55. 
46. Use of Wheel Cutter.—Still another method 
of making small wheels is by use of the wheel 
cutter as shown in Fig. 19. This wheel cutter 
may be used in the ordinary bit brace. Good 
results may be obtained where the wheels are 
made out of thin, soft wood. 
This wheel cutter is known on the market as 
a leather washer cutter. If one cannot be 
obtained it can easily be made in the school 
machine shop at a small cost. Fig. 20 shows a 
drawing of a wheel cutter. 
You will notice that the blade can be adjusted 
to cut any diameter desired. 
47. Use of Coping Saw.—Where a band saw is 
not included in the shop equipment, many articles such as animal forms and small wheels 
could very easily be cut out with a coping saw. 
A saw board, as shown in Fig. 21 should be 
fastened to a table top with an iron clamp; or, a 
  Fig. 19. Wheel cutter in use 
saw board made to fasten in a vise may also be 
used. 
When cutting out the toy part, the coping saw 
should be held in a vertical position as shown 
in Fig. 22, and in an up-and-down motion,

with short fast strokes, following the outline 
carefully. Cut on the line. Do not press hard 
on the saw for the blade is very thin and can very 
easily be broken, but it should last a long time 
if used correctly. 
48. Cutting Sharp Corners—When cutting a

sharp turn in the wood with the coping saw, 
care should be taken not to twist the saw blade 
out of shape. Upon reaching the sharp turn, 
continue the up-and-down motion, but without 
doing any cutting; turn the wood very slowly 
until you have made the complete turn, then 
continue with the sawing and follow the rest of

the outline carefully. 
49. Removing the Saw-Blade from Frame.— 
To remove the saw-blade from the frame, place 
the head of the frame against the table top as 
shown in Fig. 23. Pressing down on the handle 
will release the saw-blade. When inserting 
the blade into the frame the same method may be followed, being careful that the teeth of the 
saw-blade point toward the handle of the frame. 
The blade may be put in the end or the side 
slots of the frame, using the side slots only 
when the end slots will not serve the purpose. 
50. Making Heavy Wheels.—In turning heav- 
ier wheels that are to be used for coasters, 
kiddie cars, etc., the work is done with the 
head stock only, the wood being supported by 
the screw-center chuck or face plate. 
In turning the wheel the first step is the 
scraping cut as shown in Fig. 24. This cut is 
properly made with the concave chisel held in 
such a position as to give a light scraping cut. 
Care should be exercised not to allow the chisel 
to extend too deeply, otherwise the material 
will chip with the grain. 
After the desired circumference has been ob- 
tained the surface should be worked to the 
desired form as shown in Fig. 25. This is ac- 
complished by using the lathe rest, set at right 
angles with the bed or parallel with the face 
plate. The illustration in Fig. 26 shows the use 
of the dividers in marking off the position of 
the various corrugations in the wheel that is 
being turned. The sanding should be done while
-P-A-G-E-46
USE OF JIGS AND FIXTURES 49 
the wheel is in the lathe. Use first a fairly 
course grade of sand paper and afterwards a 
fine grade, No. O or OO. 
51. Designs for Wheels.—Suggestions for 
wooden toy wheels are shown in Fig. 27. Those 
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are plain wooden 
wheels varying in design only. No. 8 and 9 
are re-enforced with zine and large iron washers. 
No. 10 shows a segment of an iron pipe fitted in 
the center of the wheel to prevent wearing 
away of material. No. 11 shows a spoke wheel. 
The spokes are made of dowel rods; these 
fitting into a hub that can easily be turned out 
on the lathe. No. 13 shows a wheel built in 
segments which is then cut out on the band 
saw to resemble a standard spoke wheel. The 
rim is 1/8” steel, fastened to spokes with very 
small rivets. 
52. Cutting Wheels on Band-Saw.—A circle of 
the required size wheel may be marked off on 
the wood with a compass, then cut in the out- 
line on the band-saw. This method will leave 
square corners and will be more or less out of 
truth with the center of the wheel. To true up 
and smooth the outside of the wheel the lathe 
attachment as shown in Fig. 28 can be easily prepared. This attachment consists of a block A 
fastened to the lathe bed with a single bolt, 
and a stop B fastened to the upper face of the 
block A. The carriage C is a loose piece the 
  Fig. 24. Making heavy wheels. The scraping cut 
same thickness as the stop B and is provided 
with a dowel rod to fit the central hole in the 
wheel. This dowel rod is so located that 
when the edge of the carriage C is tight against 
the edge of the stop D, the distance from the 
center of the dowel rod to the face of the abra-

sive material on the disk, will be equal to the 
radius of the finished wheel. 
The wood is cut out on the band saw a scant 
1/16” over-size in diameter, and is then placed 
on the dowel rod in the carriage C which is 
held flat on block A while the edge of the 
blank is brought in contact with the grinding 
disc face by pushing the carriage forward with 
the left hand while the blank ‘is slowly revolved 
with the right. This grinding is continued until 
the edges of stop B and carriage C' will remain 
in contact during a complete revolution of the wheel blank. During this grinding process, the 
carriage should be moved back and forth from 
the edge to the center of the grinding disc 
so that the wear on the abrasive material may 
be equalized.

A similar device used for chamfering the edges 
of the blanks is also shown in Fig. 28, as it 
looks when viewed from the front of the lathe. 
The preceding description will suffice for this 
as the same system of lettering has been used. 
It differs only in that block A is made to set at 
an angle of 45 degrees instead of being level.

Grinding discs may be made either of metal 
or wood. Metal is preferable but a hardwood 
dise fastened to a metal face plate will answer 
very well. There are many methods of fasten- 
ing the abrasing material to the disc but the 
most convenient way is by the use of stick belt 
dressing. The disc is coated with dressing by 
holding the stick against it as it revolves and 
the abrasive is applied before the dressing has 
set. A pair of dividers or trammels is used to 
cut the abrasive material to the same diameter 
as the disc and it should be warmed on the 
uncoated side before it is applied. It sticks 
tightly to the disc but is easily removed and replaced with fresh material in a few 
minutes. 
53. Boring Holes in Wheels.—The center holes 
in wheels may be bored with bit and brace, but 
better results are obtained if the holes are bored 
in the lathe. A drill chuck fitted to the live 
spindle and a drilling pad for the tail stock 
spindle will be required to do this job efficiently. 
The tail stock is locked fast and the wheel to be 
drilled is placed against the drilling pad and 
fed up to the revolving bit by turning the tail 
spindle feed wheel. This method will produce 
a cleaner hole and one that is square with the 
wheel face.

OPERATION OF WOODWORKING MACHINES 55 
55. Operating the Lathe.—The lathe is perhaps 
one of the most important machines used in 
toy making. It lends itself to unlimited varie- 
ties of work and for that reason is really indis- 
pensible in the shop. 
In Fig. 29 the student is preparing to take the 
  Fig. 31. The paring cut 
roughing cut in turning a cylinder. ‘This 
operation consists of removing the corners of 
the square piece and is done with the tool known 
as the gouge. After the roughing cut has been taken, cali- 
pers set to the diameter desired will determine 
the depth of the next cut, sizing cut. The

illustration in Fig. 30 shows the student per- 
forming this operation with the cut-off tool. 
When the correct dimension has been found, 
the next step in the process of turning a cylinder 
is the paring cut or finishing cut, Fig. 31. This 
is done with the skew or bevel chisel. A very thin 
shaving is removed by this operation.
-P-A-G-E-53
56 TOY MAKING   
The ends are then cut by using the cut-off tool 
as shown in Fig. 32. It is merely taking a 
slice off the end. If a very thin slice is to be 
  Fig. 33. Making convex surfaces 
removed, it is usually made by the long point of 
the skew chisel. If it is more than a quarter of 
an inch it should be sized and then removed 
by the skew. 
If it is desired to round the end of a piece or 
to produce a convex surface the operation can 
be done by applying the broad side of the skew 
chisel, as in Fig. 33. 56. Face Plate Turning—The preceding par- 
agraphs describe the process of turning when 
the piece is supported between the live and the 
dead centers. The processes shown in Figs. 
24, 25 and 26, illustrate the character of the 
work done with the head stock only when the 
  piece is supported by the screw-center chuck 
or face plate. 
The first step in face plate turning is the

scraping cut, Fig. 24. This cut is properly 
made with the concave chisel held in such a 
position as to give a light scraping cut. Care 
should be exercised not to allow the chisel to 
extend too deeply, otherwise the material will 
chip with the grain. After the desired circum-

ference has been obtained the surface should 
be smoothed with the skew chisel. 
Fig. 25 shows the student modeling a rosette, 
using the rest, set at right angles with the bed 
or parallel with the face plate. Prior to the 
modeling a shearing cut should be taken with

The illustration in Fig. 26 shows the use of 
the dividers. The student is marking off to a 
uniform scale the position of the various corru- 
gations in the rosette he is turning. TOY MAKING 
57. The Universal Saw.—The operations that 
can be performed on the universal saw are so 
many that no attempt will be made to illustrate 
them all here. But enough are given to show 
the characteristic operations involved in cross- 
cutting, ripping, and dadoing,—the three basic 
uses of a circular saw. 
  Fig. 38. Grooving, or ripping special work
-P-A-G-E-56
  
It is a more dangerous tool than the lathe and 
the guard should be kept over the saw at all 
times, except of course, in dadoing when it can 
not be used.

uses of a circular saw

work that can be done on a hand jointer depends 
very largely upon the knowledge and skill of 
the operator. It lends itself to so many opera- 
tions, that the student gains much in knowledge 
and efficiency.

The five operations shown in Figs. 40, 41, 42,

that is usually accomplished on a hand jointer 
and show something of the method by which 
the work should be done. 
The jointer is another tool where the use of 
the guard should never be omitted. 59. The Sander.—The sander is an interesting 
machine in the school shop for on it considerable 
“forming” can be done as with the lathe, altho 
its prime use is to make smooth or polish. 
In Fig. 45 the boy at the left is forming a mitre 
while the one on the right is smoothing surface.

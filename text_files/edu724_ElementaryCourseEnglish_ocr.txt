PREFACE 
This syllabus grew out of the needs of a particu- 
lar group of schools. It was found that in order 
to co-operate intelligently, a body of teachers 
requires something more explicit and, at the same 
time, more general than the brief outline courses 
of study which boards of education usually provide. 
Hence the working principles which had proved 
most important in actual practice were compiled, 
and to these were added suggestions for the various 
grades, brief bibliographies, and a series of graded 
and annotated lists of poems, stories, and other 
material. The work represents, therefore, experi- 
ence of a comprehensive and varied character, 
and is offered with some confidence as a working 
guide for teachers of elementary English. 
The book is intended primarily as a manual for 
the teacher’s desk. An effort has been made to 
indicate definitely the character of the activities 
to be carried on in the several grades, and to ar- 
range a collection of material sufficiently varied to 
meet changing conditions and so selected and listed 
as to be readily accessible. The system of index- 
ing, by which a poem or story can easily be found 
in one or more of a small number of volumes, 
which the teacher can reasonably expect to have 
v

vi PREFACE 
access to, is believed to be new, and has been found 
exceedingly convenient. 
Great care has been exercised to include only 
really good versions of the traditional stories. 
This is by no means an easy matter, for the freedom 
with which the old tales have been garbled by well- 
meaning but inartistic pedagogues is appalling. 
Truly the printing-press, especially that of the 
schoolbook house, is the deadly enemy of the 
classical literature of the folk. Cinderella in words 
of one syllable and sentences of four words is 
neither delectable nor edifying, and a strong 
animal tale like the famous Story of the Three Bears 
loses itself completely in the sentimental, kinder- 
gartenized Goldie Locks, now too widely current. 
Classics will stand the test of time, but this does 
not insure them, it seems, against the tinkering 
of education-mongers. 
It is hoped that classes in normal schools, 
teachers in institutes, teachers and principals in 
individual schools, and parents in club meetings 
may find the syllabus convenient, both as a basis 
of discussion and as a bibliography. Indeed the 
book has been satisfactorily used in these ways. 
The plan of the work forbade the elaboration of 
any topic; hence no apology is offered for the 
dogmatic tone of the suggestions.

PREFACE vii 
The lists of references make no pretense to com- 
pleteness. They are intended for general use, 
not for specialists. The latter will, no doubt, 
prefer to compile lists of their own. The most 
comprehensive and generally useful references are 
placed first. These often contain extensive bib- 
liographies, which will open the way to as wide 
and thorough reading upon the various topics as 
inclination or circumstances may prompt. 
It remains only to acknowledge the author’s 
obvious indebtedness to sundry books, pamphlets, 
and courses of study, many of which are named as 
references, and especially to the teachers and 
principals of the Chicago public schools. It was 
through their influence that the material was first 
assembled, and it is because of their kindly appre- 
ciation that the work is now offered to a wider 
audience.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION 
Twenty-five years of agitation concerning in- 
struction in the mother tongue has brought about 
one definite result, namely, that everywhere and 
unhesitatingly a large place on the daily school 
program is reserved for it. As to the efficiency of 
the instruction there is great variance of opinion. 
Few are entirely satisfied. There seems to be a 
growing suspicion that some of us have indulged in 
sentiment and fine talk about freedom and the 
unconscious absorbing of good English, at the 
expense of honest, thorough teaching. The spell- 
ing class has come back, grammar is “revived,” 
literature is “‘analyzed”—but with a difference. 
Not technique without interest or deeper educa- 
tional bearing, but technique with these, is the 
newer aim. Ground has been gained, and the way 
of further advance seems plain. 
We must turn to psychology and the scientific 
method for tangible aid in organizing our English 
work. These can provide the explanation of our 
failures and indicate the right way to our goal 
Such investigations as those of Huey and Dearborn 
into the actual process of reading, for example, 
throw a flood of light on the problem of teaching 
reading and will aid in establishing more rational 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
4 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
methods. Similar studies of the process of acquir- 
ing the oral language, of spelling, and of grammar 
are hardly less suggestive and will ultimately 
revolutionize instruction in these subjects. Formal 
discipline is yielding to the “pedagogical child,” 
but both must give way for the real boy with his 
real needs and his natural manner of responding 
to the influences about him. More and more 
the school must become typical of contemporary 
life. 
An outline of English to guide the teachers of a 
school is, in a sense, a necessary evil. If a wise 
and skilful person were to have charge of a group 
of children throughout the elementary period, she 
could provide, adapt, and devise for them better 
than any general outline could possibly. suggest. 
But such conditions are rarely found. Instead, 
classes must meet several teachers, generally a 
new one each year; the teachers of a large school 
must work in concert; and hence arises the need 
of a plan to which all agree. When such a plan 
is an evolution—grows out of the experience of 
many teachers laboring together for a number of 
years—and is criticized in the light of what has been 
done elsewhere, it is quite likely to embody much 
of the best that is known about the work planned, 
and may come reasonably near to what the one
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION 5 
ideally wise person would do if she had some of 
the children all of the time. 
But English as a subject of study does not lend 
itself readily or happily to definite outlining. The 
grading and prescription of literature, in the present 
state of our knowledge at least, is necessarily arbi- 
trary, for the most part, and may defeat the pur- 
pose of the literary study. Much great literature is 
simple and has a message for everybody. Effect- 
ive reading, moreover, depends largely upon the 
fitting mood. A genuine contact of mind with 
book is much more readily secured at some times 
than at others. At most, the course maker should 
reserve for the work of each grade a few selections 
which all children should know and which have 
unfailingly appealed to children of that age. In 
this way there is insured to each teacher a body of 
suitable material and to the children the building- 
up of a repertoire of classics upon which taste may 
gradually be formed and ideals molded. The 
winnowing which is now going on will ultimately 
determine what these inevitable selections are. 
The case of language presents even greater diffi- 
culties. Language-study is not an end in itself 
and not an object of conscious interest to little 
children. Yet to assign certain facts of language 
to certain grades is to make it appear that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
mastery of these facts, independent of their prac- 
tical uses, isthe aim. Ideally, pupils should master 
the forms of language as they require them for 
self-expression. As a matter of fact, real mastery 
is never accomplished in any other way; as witness 
the number of those who know but do not do. 
Marks of punctuation, for example, should be 
taught as the pupil’s maturing sentence forms 
demand them. On the other hand, it is true that 
sentence forms are mastered to some extent in 
learning to punctuate, provided that the pupil 
does some thinking for himself in the process. On 
the whole, specific mention of certain facts and 
principles of language in the course for a given grade 
must be taken to mean that those items of tech- 
nique are necessary to any child in the stage of 
advancement which the other work of the grade 
implies, and the teacher should make sure that 
they are positively and usefully known. Succeed- 
ing teachers should not permit such knowledge to 
grow dim. 
The word English has come to signify a group 
of studies called language, composition, word- 
study, reading, literature, grammar, and even 
penmanship. For clearness it is worth while to 
observe that only four distinct but related activities 
are involved: hearing, speaking, reading, and
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION a 
writing English. The essential purpose of these 
studies, moreover, is only twofold: to become able 
to express yourself and to understand others. In 
a large sense the aim is simply effectiveness in the 
use of the mother tongue. The reaching of this 
aim, however, is sure to involve a large acquisition 
of knowledge, growth in intellectual power, quick- 
ening of artistic and ethical perception, and 
strengthening of moral resolution. The values 
to be realized will be more fully set forth in the 
first section of the syllabus. 
Finally, it should be remarked that knowl- 
edge, enthusiasm, and a sound point of view are 
equally important. Everyone who teaches Eng- 
lish, whether to younger or to older children, should 
be and remain a constant student, both of the 
problems of instruction and of language itself. 
The teacher must preserve the student’s interest, 
and strive for the scholar’s breadth and reverent 
respect for the subject. She will hardly fail to 
love and observe her children, and to study their 
needs.

OUTLINE OF THEORY
-P-A-G-E-20

AN OUTLINE OF THE THEORY OF IN- 
STRUCTION IN ENGLISH IN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
LANGUAGE IN EDUCATION 
I. In any statement of educational aims and 
values, language must be given a large place. The 
fundamental fact is that mind grows through its 
own activity, which is aroused by stimuli in the 
environment, and that mental activity is largely 
conditioned by language. Mental development, 
therefore, is first in importance. Other values are 
knowledge, aesthetic pleasure, social power, social 
solidarity, and social advance. Language is the 
most useful of all tools. Ty 4 
II. The English language has peculiarities which 
make it both easy and difficult to learn. Inflec- 
tion, for example, is easy; spelling is difficult. 
III. The school is but one of many factors at 
work. In some respects the influence of the home 
and the street is stronger. Few rise far above the 
level of the community. 
IV. The present conditions are distinctly favor- 
able for good work in English. The importance 
of the study is now recognized, and teachers are 
making ever-increasing efforts to prepare them- 
Ir 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    12 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
selves for a task admittedly difficult. A definite, 
uniform, and settled policy as to method, and 
especially as to material, is yet to be developed. 
V. Considerable advance has been made in 
observing and recording the actual linguistic con- 
dition of pupils at the time of entering school. 
Naturally these vary widely, but the modern 
teacher is ready to make an intelligent effort to 
begin with little children at the point to which the 
home has brought them. 
VI. Learning English involves four fundamental 
processes: hearing, speaking, reading, and writing. 
The practical result is twofold: ability to express 
oneself and to understand others. To this should 
be added some knowledge and appreciation of 
literature. The material and exercises for use in 
school are commonly grouped under such heads 
as composition, word-study, grammar, reading, 
and literature. Each of these subjects deserves 
consideration in turn.

COMPOSITION—ORAL AND WRITTEN 
All effort toward expression in words is, in a 
broad sense, composition. Hence the term in- 
cludes the fragmentary and informal expressions 
heard throughout the day, as well as the complete 
treatment of a topic. All language exercises 
should look to some definite result in the daily 
activity of the pupils. The oral language deserves 
even more attention than the written, and should 
be measured by standards equally high. Neither 
oral nor written language should be permitted to 
lag behind the child’s needs nor fail to contribute 
its share to his intellectual growth. 
I. The aims of the teacher of language include 
the following: 
1. To make the free expression of ideas a pleasure 
to the children. 
(2. To arouse a desire on the part of the pupils 
keep the national language pure. 
3. To develop ideas and orderly habits of think- 
ing. 
4. To secure ease, correctness, and adequacy of 
expression. 
5. To aid the individual to overcome his special 
faults. 
14
-P-A-G-E-25
  
COMPOSITION 15 
6. To equip all with the information and train- 
ing necessary to meet the actual demands of life. 
II. Certain principles of success should be borne 
in mind: 
1. Language development is special, not gen- 
eral. To be effective, language exercises must 
present a variety of typical situations in which 
expression springs from a felt need. Formal dis- 
cipline in language does not adequately prepare for 
life. 
2. Imitation, largely unconscious, is the chief 
method of assimilation, particularly in the case of 
younger children and particularly in the case of 
oral language. 
3. Hence the strongest school influence in lan-° 
guage is that of the group to which a child belongs. 
The teacher’s task is largely that of helping the 
children to train each other. 
4. Habits of order and consecutiveness, are in- 
stilled chiefly by the teacher’s presentation, ques- 
tions, and directions. 
5. The use of good English is a habit. A judi- 
cious but persistent effort to establish it must be 
made throughout the day’s work. First, because 
the combined influence of the home and the com- 
munity often exceeds that of the school and is 
frequently vitiating; secondly, because otherwise  
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
only the stimulus of the English class will produce 
the desired reaction, while elsewhere the habit of 
using poor English will assert itself. 
6. Language is an art. Nothing but intelligent, 
eager, long-continued practice under guidance and 
criticism can bring success in it. 
7. Strong and effective motives for expression 
should be appealed to. These include: (1) the 
desire to give pleasure and profit to others; (2) the 
desire to express and support an opinion; (3) the 
desire to enjoy for oneself the mastery of an art. 
8. It is idle to speak of children’s remaining 
unconscious of form. Language is made up of 
forms. So long as pupils study forms because they 
need to use them, such study is educative and 
defensible. Isolation is indeed to be condemned. 
The idea to be expressed should, of course, be the 
chief interest. 
g. Originality springs from first-hand observa- 
tion and the free play of the imagination. Prig- 
gishness and bookish insincerity are often mistaken 
for it. 
to. Facts and principles of language and com- 
position should be taught and used—taught 
through use and when they are needed for use. 
Explicit statement should not be expected or 
required earlier than the fourth year. There is
-P-A-G-E-27
  
COMPOSITION 17 
no valid excuse for lack of thoroughness, however, 
and knowledge once gained should never afterward 
be allowed to fall into disuse. 
11. Every part or aspect of the work in English 
should be related to some or all of the others and 
as far as possible to all of the activities of the 
school. 
III. The means to be employed may be grouped 
under three heads: 
1. Impression—presenting literature by reading 
or telling, with the accompanying comment and 
discussion. This leads to wider interests, a larger 
and better word-stock, and higher standards of 
expression. 
2. Expression — conversation, dramatization, 
topical recitation, and original composition. Ex- 
pressional activity conditions all growth in lan- 
guage. 
3. Formal instruction—the criticism and correc- 
tion of oral and written language, instruction in 
the principles of composition, drill in the correction 
of errors, and exercises to establish good use in 
punctuation, spelling, grammar, and other elements 
of technique. 
IV. Systematic instruction in language, par- 
ticularly in the upper grades, requires a special 
period, which, wherever possible, should be con-
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
secutive with the period for literature in order to 
permit of adjustments in the time for written 
work and the use of one for illustration of the other. 
Such a period should be devoted (z) to the induc- 
tive study of principles and to practice in the ap- 
plication of them; (2) to the study of examples of 
effective composition in order to set up proper 
standards and to learn the methods of the art; and 
(3) to practice in expression and to correction and 
criticism, the material to be drawn from the whole 
range of the pupils’ knowledge and interests, and 
with the purpose either to increase knowledge or 
to give pleasure. The activities may be further 
specified as follows: 
1. Conversation.—This is not merely informal 
recitation. It is free exchange and actual con- 
tribution. To have it, freedom and good will 
must be established. The teacher should guide 
it, however, and prevent mere babbling. Her op- 
portunity lies in leading the children to see rela- 
tions where they have seen only facts, and in help- 
ing them to the words and idioms they need. A 
few worthy topics will be mentioned specifically 
in the outline for primary grades. 
2. Report and discussion.—Pupils should learn 
to put a matter of observation, experience, read- 
ing, or opinion clearly and effectively before the 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
COMPOSITION 19 
class. Training in speaking on one’s feet in a 
composed, pleasing, and forcible manner is well 
worth the effort necessary to secure it, and can 
hardly begin too early. Such exercises should 
often be impromptu in character. 
3. The oral story—(a) The story is naturally a 
valuable means of instruction for little children. 
It is a primitive and popular mode of thinking; it 
awakens the imagination and may train it to 
rational processes; it conveys much knowledge of 
men and things, cultivates the taste for literature, 
and exercises the ethical judgment. As a means 
of discipline in language it (x) affords training in 
unity and sequence; (2) increases and improves 
the vocabulary through the appropriation of the 
words of the author for ideas which the story has 
awakened; (3) advances facility in pronunciation 
and in the use of English idiom and the English 
sentence; (4) develops power to hold to a train of 
thought, and (5) strengthens the memory for 
imaginative details. One may add that oral re- 
production is only an aid to original composition, 
never a substitute for it, and that unless the right 
sort of stories is handled according to an effective 
plan the exercise is nearly worthless. 
6) Stories suitable for retelling by children are 
not numerous. Such stories should be (x) brief, 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  
20 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
(2) simple in structure and motive, and (3) full of 
action and imagination; (4) the language appeal- 
ing to the senses; (5) the story moving steadily 
forward; (6) each incident fully developed; (7) 
the ending definite and satisfying; (8) the appeal 
to the emotions direct and vivid. For the young- 
est children, folk-tale, carefully selected, best ful- 
fils the conditions. Later, use may be made of 
the fables, the myths and legendary stories, and, 
to a limited extent, of stories by modern authors, 
particularly stories of animals. With regard to 
all traditional stories the greatest care should be 
exercised to secure the best possible version. 
c) The telling of stories is an art. It implies a 
good knowledge of literary forms and elements and 
a lively interest in traditional literature for its own 
sake. The artistic purpose and structure of each 
story must be clearly apprehended. Such changes 
and omissions must be decided upon as presenta- 
tion to the ear may require. In the actual telling, 
the narrative must be made to live in the imagi- 
nation as a whole made up of definite literary 
units. 
d) Retelling by the children should usually be 
asked for only after repeated hearings. Only so 
can the story be assimilated and the pupil become 
able to render it as his story. The meanings,
-P-A-G-E-31
  COMPOSITION 21 
associations, and sequence of the story should be 
developed by questions and discussion, and occa- 
sionally an outline of the incidents may be worked 
out and placed before the class or written down by 
each pupil, or both. 
e) If worked out by the children themselves, 
dramatization is a useful form of reproduction in 
the primary grades, but it should never degenerate 
into a mere exercise for entertainment. This form 
of expression should gradually be replaced in 
grades above the second by the reading of “‘parts”’ 
and by the arranging of plays in writing. 
3. Learning poetry by heart.—Many of the shorter 
poems in the literature course should be learned 
by heart. Aside from the gain in appprecia- 
tion, the expressional value is considerable, par- 
ticularly if proper care has been exercised in 
making vivid the pictures and associations of 
the words and the meaning of the whole. Read- 
ing of the poems may begin even in the first 
grade, and the copying of them in books kept 
for the purpose in the third. Mere repetition 
of the words of the poem should never be per- 
mitted; memorizing and reciting should mean 
memorizing and reciting the thought, and a 
rational method of doing this should be de- 
veloped. Attention may well be directed, in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
higher grades, to the fitness of the words for their 
peculiar office. f 
4. Written composition.—This is a form of ex- 
pression which involves many factors and which 
usually offers much difficulty to the learner. Pen- 
manship, spelling, indentation, capitals, marks of 
punctuation, and a more formal structure than 
that of oral language combine to hinder a free 
play of ideas. Failure results from lack of oral 
preparation, from attempting too much, from 
improper subject-matter, and from over-insistence 
on perfection of mechanical details. Because 
exercises are long they are too infrequent and are 
not properly criticized. Finally, pupils very often 
lack interest or will not take pains. The following 
is suggested: 
a) That genuine motives for writing be brought 
into play. Letters are particularly easy to motive. 
b) That the topics chosen be such as have in- 
terest to the pupils—their work, their play, their 
fancies. The assignment should provide a defi- 
nite problem which the pupil can work out. 
c) That, generally speaking, writing be called 
for only when the topic is well in hand. In gen- 
eral, discussion, oral treatment, and blackboard 
work may well precede the attempt to make a 
permanent record on paper. Nevertheless, the  
-P-A-G-E-33
  
COMPOSITION 23 
freedom of individual effort must be preserved, 
and the value of impromptu exercises should be 
recognized. 
d) That pupils should early learn to work to a 
plan. As far as practicable the plan or outline 
should be their own, made and used by the indi- 
vidual as a guide to composing and recompos- 
ing. The connection between such outlining and 
instruction in paragraphing is close and impor- 
tant. 
e) That correction and criticism should be sys- 
tematic and progressive. Typical items should be 
made class exercises and the pupils left to make 
specific corrections for themselves. A few things 
only should be attempted at once, often only a 
single thing. Pupils should learn how to criticize 
a first draft for themselves and how to offer definite 
suggestions on the work of classmates. The 
blackboard should be utilized. Many composi- 
tions should be read to the class, sometimes by the 
teacher and sometimes by the writers. In this 
way pupils may learn to judge the quality of writ- 
ing by its appeal to the ear. 
5. Technical work.—The place of this has been 
indicated (in II, 8 and 10). It has its beginning 
in the feeling that one must do his work as well 
as possible. The method may include:
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
a) Observation of forms and usages in the read- 
ing. 
b) Copying of poetry in the literature class, and 
of letter forms and dialogue. 
c) Dictation exercises to fix certain specific 
points. Except for testing, the passage should be 
studied beforehand and compared afterward. 
The class should drill, not mark time. 
d) Blackboard exercises to present facts quickly 
to the eyes of all and to give practice in correction. 
e) Requiring pupils to use what they know. 
f) Making common errors evident to the whole 
class and correcting them by emphasizing the right 
forms and by arousing a class pride in using them. 
g) Occasional lessons in English grammar.

WORD-STUDY 
I. The term word-study is a convenient heading 
for discussion rather than the title of a subject of 
study to be pursued consecutively and independ- 
ently throughout the course. It includes oral and 
written spelling, phonics, word composition, defini- 
tion, synonyms, dictation, the use of the dictionary, 
etc: 
II. Phonics—1z. The study of elementary sounds 
should begin when a small reading vocabulary of 
representative words has been acquired. It has 
immediate application in reading but should con- 
stitute a separate exercise. 
2. No diacritics need be used. The pupils 
should gain the facts from observation and use 
them. 
3. Correct pronunciation will result from care- 
ful hearing rather than from attention to the organs 
of speech. There should be frequent drills, how- 
ever, to secure accuracy and pure tone. 
III. Spelling.—-1. Good spelling is the result of 
good pronunciation, a habit of imaging words 
accurately, and care in writing. The words most 
often misspelled are usually those which have been 
longest in the speaking vocabulary. 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
28 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
2. Oral spelling, drill on lists, grouping, the 
learning of rules, the making of word books, all 
have value. The test of actual life, however, is 
the ability to spell words correctly in their context. 
3. Spelling must have definite attention. The 
unphonetic character of English spelling, com- 
bined with the fact that, in reading, words are 
seen as wholes, makes the spelling class necessary. 
Yet it should be remembered that good spelling 
is largely a by-product. 
4. No spelling-book can wholly replace the lists 
prepared by the teacher, At most it is a guide 
andaconvenience. It should contain no markings 
or other changes in the normal appearance of the 
written or printed word. Syllabifying should 
mainly be confined to the oral exercises. 
IV. Word compostion.—1. The systematic study 
of derivation is of doubtful value in the lower 
grades. The knowledge of the pupils is too limited 
to permit of safe generalization. 
2. Nevertheless, an interest in the life-history of 
words should be aroused, and, as opportunity 
offers, useful facts as to the meaning and applica- 
tion of prefixes, suffixes, and common elements 
should be taught. 
V. Dictation —1. The most judicious discrimi- 
nation should be exercised in the matter of direct-
-P-A-G-E-39
  
WORD-STUDY 29 
ing the attention of children to words which 
they should acquire. Priggishness and affectation 
readily result from the effort to use words. 
2. But the assimilation of needed words, particu- 
larly from reading, requires attention to them. 
The learner must have a sense of their fitness and 
an occasion to use them in self-expression. 
3. Reasonable accuracy should be demanded and 
secured. 
4. Dictation should be used only as a necessary 
means to some specific end. 
VI. Use of the dictionary.—z. When the dic- 
tionary is brought into daily use, the principle of 
diacritics should be taught and the habit of 
cautious, intelligent use of the book carefully de- 
veloped. 
2. The learning of definitions from the diction- 
ary is an unprofitable exercise. The children 
might better strive to form their own. Compari- 
son afterward would then result in actual knowl- 
edge and greater accuracy.

ENGLISH GRAMMAR 
I. Grammar should be taught in the elementary 
school chiefly for its practical value, and it should 
be applied. Grammatical parsing and analysis, 
as isolated exercises, seem to bear little or no rela- 
tion to correctness in speech and writing. (See 
the account of Mr. Hoyt’s investigations.) 
II. The method of grasping the facts should be 
inductive, but the natural limitations of children’s 
minds in pursuing scientific investigations must 
be respected. The material is intangible, and 
readily baffles the efforts of immature children. 
III. Children should not be made to suppose 
that they or anyone can find a logical explanation 
for all grammatical forms or usages. Many expres- 
sions are, in a sense, illogical. History alone can 
account for many idioms of language. The at- 
tempts which are sometimes made to psychologize 
grammatical definitions and explanations violate 
the intellectual sincerity of the children and make 
them none the wiser. 
IV. Attention should be directed to the func- 
tions of the various parts and elements of the sen- 
tence and to the order and arrangement of words. 
Such work requires careful thought, and, at the 
3r
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
same time, bears directly upon reading and com- 
position. E 
V. During and after the fourth year, principles 
of grammar should be taught whenever the pupils 
can profit by them in their daily experience. How- 
ever simple the fact, it should be designated by 
the standard terminology. 
VI. The continued use of single sentences 
chosen to present certain grammatical forms, to 
the exclusion of connected discourse, is to be 
avoided. The application of grammatical knowl- 
edge is naturally to the sentence in context. The 
best of all material is that provided by the pupil’s 
own compositions. 
VII. When the members of a class see clearly 
what a certain grammatical relation is, they should 
have liberal opportunity to choose or construct 
good sentences to illustrate it. Much excellent 
practice in punctuation may accompany such 
exercises. 
VIII. A textbook in grammar should be mainly 
a collection of good examples of idiomatic English 
as it is spoken and written today. The grammar 
of Milton, Wordsworth, Thackeray, and other 
English classics may well be deferred. 
IX. Formal grammar-study should begin with 
the sentence as a whole and proceed analytically.
-P-A-G-E-43
     
GRAMMAR 33 
This is not only the order natural to the learner 
but it is pre-eminently the order suited to a lan- 
guage which is slightly dependent upon inflection. 
To begin with the learning of paradigms is a blun- 
der inherited from Latinized grammars. In no 
case should the practical needs of the class be 
sacrificed for the sake of following out the logical 
order of topics arranged by some textbook writer. 
X. Diagrams should never become more than 
clear, graphic representation of relations already 
perceived, and should never require a key.

READING 
I. Reading in the higher grades of the elementary 
school is practically a form of literary study and 
will be so considered. By “reading” is meant 
learning to read. This includes (z) the acquiring 
of a sufficient mastery of symbols and of the pro- 
cess of reading so that meaning can be gathered 
with comfort and facility, and (2) the establishing 
of sound and correct habits of interpreting the 
printed page. 
II. Too-much time is often devoted to reading 
in the primary grades. The physical strain of 
reading is considerable. The process of learning, 
moreover, can hardly be made so fruitful an experi- 
ence in itself as work in oral literature, nature 
study, and manual training. Pupils who tell 
stories, learn poetry, and converse about nature 
and other objects of experience actually make 
more and better progress than those who drill 
excessively on reading, especially in case these 
various activities are systematically related to 
reading. 
III. Both the method and the material of pri- 
mary reading depend upon one’s view of what 
reading is. Recent psychological investigation 
35
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
has thrown much light upon the matter and goes 
far to confirm the practice of the majority of pro- 
gressive teachers, who have reached their position 
through common-sense and experience. Among 
the important points are: 
1. The sentence is the unit in reading, “a simul- 
taneous and successive whole.” Many less im- 
portant words are ordinarily not in consciousness 
at all, but throughout there is a sense of relation- 
ship, an anticipation of context. Hence children 
should form their reading habit upon the sentence. 
But attention must be called to many of the com- 
ponent words if each is to become a part of the 
reading vocabulary. This must not, however, 
prevent continuity of vocal utterance. Oral read- 
ing must be by phrases, clauses, sentences, never 
word by word. Beginners should master each 
sentence before attempting to read it aloud. 
2. Reading involves a sort of “inner speech.” 
There are few who do not have at least a dim con- 
sciousness of the articulate sounds of which the 
sentence is made up. The most rapid readers are 
most nearly ‘“‘eye-minded,” least hindered, that 
is, by the individual words. Children should, 
therefore, have much practice in silent reading. 
It does not follow that practice in reading to others 
should be omitted.
-P-A-G-E-47
READING 37 
3. The process of getting the thought and ex- 
pressing it is a very complex one, involving a series 
of visual-auditory-associative-motor reactions. 
Defective organs are often the cause of slow prog- 
ress. The teacher must observe each child as an 
individual and seek to establish a well-balanced 
habit of both silent and oral reading. The need of 
eclectic method and of an abundance of suitable 
material is evident. The relation of drawing and 
writing to reading should be carefully considered. 
Finally, the physical limitations should be scrupu- 
lously respected, and every effort made to preserve 
healthful conditions. Attention is called particu- 
larly to the light upon the blackboard. 
IV. A “method” in reading which requires a 
manual of directions is an impertinence. Many, 
perhaps a majority, of the children of English- 
speaking parents make a fair beginning of reading 
at home. Every teacher of reading should con- 
sider carefully how far these informal methods of 
learning to read can be employed in school. Few 
intelligent children who see others reading will 
fail to learn, if plenty of attractive books are within 
reach. The primary school is not so much in 
need of new and carefully designed methods as of 
a better library. 
V. Reading requires a knowledge of the sounds
-P-A-G-E-48
38 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
of syllables and letters. Since the first stages of 
reading involve only the child’s spoken vocabulary, 
he should early be taught the elementary sounds 
and become able to recognize graphic word-sym- 
bols for himself. Lessons in phonetics should 
begin as soon as a small vocabulary of typical 
words has been acquired in reading. The pupil 
should observe the sound-values in familiar words 
and should learn to associate families of words 
having one or more sounds in common. The 
easier and more frequently used sounds should be 
taught first. Words should be treated as wholes 
and left unmarked, though, for convenience, com- 
mon sounds may be referred to by their standard 
names; as long or short. To build up words by 
beginning with the sound in the midst and adding 
fore and aft is to violate the psychology of reading. 
Many words do not belong to any family but 
involve unusual phonetic values, and, when met 
with in the reading, should be pronounced by the 
teacher. Great care should be exercised to secure 
correct hearing and correct pronunciation. Not 
all of the sounds of the letters can be given 
correctly in isolation by little children. The 
teacher will find extreme difficulty with many of 
them. Hence much of the practice should be upon 
words as wholes, and upon syllables.
-P-A-G-E-49
READING 39 
VI. The meaning of new words must come 
through context, assisted perhaps by suitable 
questions and illustrations. Even in the higher 
grades, the dictionary definition should be con- 
sulted only after the word has been considered 
in its place in the sentence. Drills upon isolated 
words before the study of the reading-lesson is 
begun do not assist the growth of power in reading. 
VII. Good expression in reading results mainly 
from a vivid consciousness of the meaning and the 
stimulus of an appreciative audience. An exer- 
cise in reading aloud where all have the text under 
the eye tends to become merely perfunctory and 
should be varied. No teacher is excusable for 
permitting pupils to fall into the habit of mere 
word-calling. Other forms of expression may be 
employed, story-telling and dramatization brought 
_into connection, an audience provided, and, above 
all, an abundance of interesting subject-matter 
secured. No single reading-book can possibly 
suffice for the work of any year. Three or four 
sets of different types, and a miscellaneous collec- 
tion, sufficient to enable each child to read some- 
thing for himself and tell about it, are necessary. 
An ideal of good oral reading should be presented 
by the teacher herself. 
VIII. The materials of primary reading may be
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
simple enough for beginners and yet contain 
interest and value. All the activities of the class 
may furnish reading-lessons. Simple rhymes, the 
gist of stories, dramatizations, the summaries of 
observations and conversations may be system- 
atically formed into lessons for the blackboard, 
and, where facilities are available, into lessons on 
printed slips and in little books made and illus- 
trated by the pupils themselves. Such a first 
book excels any that can be published for general 
distribution. 
IX. The best reading-books have least to dis- 
tinguish them from a child’s library book. Such 
impedimenta as word-lists, questions, section-heads 
to divide stories into lessons, printing of new words 
in black type, reviews, etc., simply bewilder the 
pupil and cause that to appear formidable which 
ought to seem easy. Clear, large type, simple 
illustrations germane to the text, and continuity 
of subject-matter are the essential features. Good 
drawings or pictures in flat colors, when artistically 
done and adequately reproduced, are probably 
the best type of illustration to be had. Next 
come clear copies of paintings, to which the lessons 
refer. Any attempt to make the child’s reading- 
book a compendium of universal knowledge is to 
be deplored.
-P-A-G-E-51
  
READING 41 
X. The reading-material in a primary book is 
seldom of interest and value in isolation. Lessons 
should be taken when the class is properly prepared 
for them and then only. This is particularly true 
of lessons dealing with social and industrial life, 
facts in nature, life in other lands, or copies of 
famous pictures.

  LITERATURE 
I. Literature has established itself as a subject 
of study in the elementary schools. The children 
of the Puritans read the Bible; the children of 
Revolutionary times read patriotic verse and prose; 
the children of the Reconstruction grew lean on 
the graded-information reader; the children of 
our own day study selections of prose and poetry 
of recognized merit. In addition to literature for 
reading, the modern course provides liberally also 
for oral literature in all grades. 
II. Literature is an art and is capable, there- 
fore, of giving aesthetic pleasure and of develop- 
ing the aesthetic sense; it provides imaginative 
experience and trains the imagination in con- 
structive and interpretative activity; it plays 
upon the finer feelings and makes possible keener 
sympathy; it embodies high ideals of life and 
conduct and sets a standard of duty; it greatly 
enlarges the reader’s knowledge of human life 
and tends to cosmopolitanism; it is a convenient 
and useful source of recreation and sometimes of 
comfort and consolation; and since it is every- 
where and always the expression and product 
of fine intelligence, it can hardly fail to promote 
43  
-P-A-G-E-54
    44 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
intelligence in those who to any degree appre- 
hend it. 
III. The method of the teacher of literature must 
ever be true to the genius of the art and to the capa- 
cities and limitations of his class. The science 
of criticism and the history of production are both 
matters of legitimate interest to the older student, 
but they have small place in the elementary 
school. The various facts which serve as the 
poetic symbols must also be held in strict subjec- 
tion. Imaginative realization of the piece—its 
sounds, words, pictures, suggestions, thoughts, 
emotions, meaning, and purpose as a whole—should 
overtop all other aims. As growing maturity 
makes it possible, to these should be added a clear 
sense of the writer’s method and of his success in 
it. The following points deserve emphasis: 
1. Literature, especially poetry, is addressed 
primarily to the ear. A faithful oral rendering 
is the most effective of all means of appreciation. 
The teacher must therefore be a good interpreter, 
and should seek to develop like power in the class. 
2. The method of all art is suggestion. The 
teacher’s work is therefore twofold: first, she 
must give needed assistance in catching the mean- 
ings which have been only indirectly conveyed in 
the selection which is being studied; second, she
-P-A-G-E-55
LITERATURE 45 
must strive to make the experience typical and 
habitual, so that, through training, the pupil may 
become able to grasp readily and pleasurably the 
meaning of whatever literature his intellectual 
development and his knowledge of life have pre- 
pared him for. 
3. Every literary work is a more or less perfect 
unity of varied parts, and unfolds in accordance 
with a plan of structure or arrangement. Whether 
pupils are made to discover this plan or not, the 
teacher should invariably be acquainted with it 
and should conduct the several lessons in the light 
ofit. It is clear that otherwise she is an incapable 
guide, that the true relation and subordination 
of parts will almost surely be obscured, and that, 
in all probability, the class will spend its energies 
on small details or in “picking out the beauties of 
literature.” 
4. Literature reflects the experience of the writer 
and must be translated into terms of the experience 
of the reader. There must be at least a “feeling 
of the meaning” of each phrase and passage, a 
certainty that a moment’s reflection would suffice 
to identify the meaning. Children are, of course, 
not conscious of their mental processes and readily 
form the habit of getting only a few vague ideas 
' from contact with a book. They must be taught
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
to bring their experience to bear and to know 
when they have really grasped the meaning. This 
must be accomplished, however, without destroying 
their naiveté and natural childish obliviousness 
of self. 
5. Too great care cannot be exercised in preserv- 
ing the genuineness and sincerity of the pupils’ 
response to the appeals of literary prose and verse. 
The child’s own judgment, to which he has come 
by his own observation, is a thousand times more 
valuable than a mature opinion put into his mouth 
by another. This does not mean that he is to be 
left in entire ignorance of literary standards, but 
merely that insincerity and sentimentality are the 
cardinal literary sins. 
6. In childhood and youth is the time for making 
permanent acquisition of a considerable body of 
poetry. Since there is no substitute for the work 
itself in the authentic language of the composer, 
to acquire means ultimately to learn by heart. 
To do so is extremely easy for younger children, 
and, if continued as a practice, need never become 
distasteful. Pupils may easily learn to recall the 
lines by remembering the structure, and the choice 
of selections and passages may largely be left with 
them. Asa matter of school policy, the memoriz- 
ing of poems beyond the child’s comprehension can
-P-A-G-E-57
  LITERATURE 47 
hardly be defended; and the reciting of “‘memory 
gems” in concert is better fitted to develop the 
lungs than to promote taste or intellectuality. 
7. It cannot too strongly be urged that the possi- 
bilities of a given selection or group of selections 
in the work of a given class be most carefully con- 
sidered. While, fundamentally, the method of 
all literature is the same, yet each selection is 
unique and presents peculiar interests and prob- 
lems. Added to this is the fact that each class has 
its own individuality. Hence, special planning 
for each study or series of studies is imperatively 
necessary. It is doubtful whether any other sub- 
ject suffers so often and so seriously from stereo- 
typed and perfunctory assignment and handling 
as literature. Pupils are given nothing to do, do 
nothing, and grow accordingly. Honest, thorough- 
going preparation on the part of the teacher is the 
remedy for the fault, and it is the least that can be 
demanded. 
8. The longer pieces, which are in place in all 
grades above the second, offer peculiarly fruitful 
opportunity for varied and effective work. The 
class must learn to carry forward the early portions, 
add meaning to meaning, keep the thread of action 
in sight, and come gradually to a comprehension 
of the whole. The teacher must mingle the 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
methods of the raconteur with those of the reader 
and the analytic student. The forms of response 
from the children should be varied and highly 
versatile. Collateral material for illustration and 
enlargement should be plentifully provided. When 
thus handled, such stories as that of Ulysses or 
Arthur become great landmarks in the pupil’s 
school life, and are not without great possibilities 
of culture for the teacher herself. 
IV. The choice of literature for children is grow- 
ing more rational. To put it simply, literature is 
coming to be recognized as literature and children 
as children. This means that versified moralizing 
and sugar-coated science must give place to genu- 
ine art, and that an earnest effort is being made to 
know and respect the interests, limitations, and 
point of view of children. Attention is called to 
the following: 
1. Simplicity of thought and structure com- 
bined with sincerity is more readily found in tradi- 
tional literature than in the work of the modern 
artist, particularly in case the modern artist sets 
out to write for children. Sophistication seeking 
to become childlike generally ends in a pose. The 
literature, especially the prose literature, of little 
children should be very largely the literature of 
the folk. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  LITERATURE 49 
2. But folk-literature reflects the crudities, 
primitive ethics, and coarseness inevitable in a 
partially developed civilization. Hence the great- 
est care must be exercised in selecting from the 
mass of such material now available the few pieces 
which are entirely fit. The wholesale editing and 
rewriting of this literature to make it harmless and 
easy to read should be decisively frowned down. 
The mantle of Andersen has so far not found fit 
shoulders. 
3. Hopeless confusion with regard to mythical 
stories seems to exist. The number of myths 
actually taught is small; the number of school 
stories called myths by undiscriminating educators 
is very great. The myths of the pagan gods have 
no place in the curriculum of the smaller children, 
and when used in higher grades should not fail to 
awaken a certain reverence for beliefs once faith- 
fully cherished. Stories of how and why certain 
phenomena of nature came to be, and stories of the 
legendary heroes of the nations may well precede 
any systematic attempt to acquaint pupils with 
the myths of the deities. Mythology, in its higher 
aspects, is certainly not food for babes. 
4. The course should include a small body of 
thoroughly good poetry which is within the chil- 
dren’s comprehension. Suitable occasion will easily  
-P-A-G-E-60
50 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
be found during any year for lyrics of nature, of 
play-time, of ideals, of fun and fancy, and of love 
of country. No little one should be deprived of 
Mother Goose, and this may well be followed by 
many of the poems in Stevenson’s Child’s Garden 
of Verses. The old favorites should be often re- 
called from year to year, brought into comparison 
with the new, and thus be made really “touch- 
stones” and a permanent possession. And, in the 
higher grades, the poems of the best-known authors 
should be grouped, and a modest attempt made to 
know the poet’s work as an expression of his life 
and interests. 
5. Mr. Scudder’s contention that American boys 
and girls should know American literature has much 
weight. The public school is the great assimilator, 
and no leavening influence can be more effective 
than the expression of the national spirit in prose 
and verse. An added advantage is the greater ease 
with which the more familiar symbols, our nature 
and our history, are interpreted. Nevertheless, 
only selections really artistic should be taught, and 
these not to the exclusion of the best and most 
suitable from whatever source. 
6. Whether certain selections are adapted to a 
particular grade or class depends much upon the 
training the class has had and upon the method 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
LITERATURE 52 
of handling. A selection can be assigned to a grade 
only on the assumption that the work indicated 
for preceding grades has been done. Again, litera- 
ture difficult for reading may often be easily 
understood when communicated orally. These 
two considerations imply (1) that teachers must be 
privileged to select material from grades below 
their own, and (2) that selections will appear in 
the lists of two or more grades. A genuine classic 
gains by repeated study—at suitable intervals and 
from new points of view. 
7. Literature-study of the right sort largely 
determines what children will read voluntarily. 
This should be one of the teacher’s cherished 
purposes, for whatever guidance most children 
receive in this vastly important matter the school 
must give. To the person really in earnest, and 
at the same time competent and tactful, numerous 
ways will readily be found to supplement the 
influences intrinsic to the class exercises themselves 
and thus to insure a substantial increase in the 
number of discriminating readers of the best. 
V. The study of pictures so nearly coincides with 
the study of literature, both in purpose and in 
method, that many teachers find it of advantage to 
supplement the one with the other. The fact that 
illustration has become so large a factor in modern
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
book-making renders this all the more desirable 
and, in specific cases, imperative. Many excel- 
lent pictures have been suggested by passages in 
literature, and many poems are but the attempt 
to say in verse what the painter had already 
expressed with his brush. Hence the possibility 
of many companion studies. But such work can 
hardly become systematic without encroaching 
upon the field of graphic art.

     THE COURSE IN ENGLISH BY GRADES 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
Formerly the idea obtained that the effect of the 
telling of the stories in the kindergarten and the 
influence of the teacher of little children through her 
speech were mainly in the directing of moral tend- 
encies and the awakening of aspiration, love, and 
reverence. Of late the conception has been broad- 
ened to include, not only all this, but also the 
unconscious communication of standards of English, 
both in the story given and in the language used in 
expression, as well as in the standards of tone, 
pronunciation, and meaning. A worthier under- 
taking for a teacher could not be imagined. She 
can acquaint the children with beautiful phrases 
and make for them ‘‘household words” of fine 
speech, at the time when they are gathering with 
quick ear, warm feelings, and wonderful speed a 
vocabulary that will be more truly their own than 
any that they may try to acquire with toil and 
effort later. She can make them lovers of whole- 
some sentiment and unconscious critics of weak 
and bloodless romance. Children accustomed for 
the first few years of their lives to the best, in their 
own literary favorites may pass through the stage 
87    
-P-A-G-E-68
   
     
58 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
of the Augusta Evans Wilson or E. P. Roe novel— 
may revel in Daring Dick or perhaps the higher 
type of melodrama provided by Henty—but time 
has proved again and again that of their own 
motion they soon become tired of it and find their 
way back to the wholesome atmospheres that are 
at one with their earlier enchantments. 
It is a truism to say that the influence that can 
be exerted in this way depends almost wholly on 
the teacher’s own personal efficiency. With older 
children literary enthusiasm and appreciation may 
be communicated where the chief instrument is 
the story, but with small children equally impor- 
tant factors are tone and language. These form 
their standards quite as much as the matter 
of the story. Hence the speech of the teacher 
should be fine and sweet. This, coupled with good 
story and good poetry and with sympathetic 
encouragement of creative effort in word-making 
and verse-making and story-making, will lay a sure 
foundation for the love of literature and of right 
habits of speaking. 
But a word of warning is timely here. All word- 
making from which any profit may come must be 
spontaneous with the children themselves. Many 
teachers make the mistake of coining words for 
the children, and there is great danger that these
-P-A-G-E-69
KINDERGARTEN 59 
may become insincere, affected, or infantile. Like 
all other creation, word-making must be spon- 
taneous and on the plane natural to the artist—a 
delightful response to experience which is welcome 
but not forced. What children want from grown 
people is real words, and above all, meanings and 
help in building general terms from concrete 
experiences. This is a most neglected field in 
English among small children, but it could be 
worked with very great profit. 
School work with the youngest ones is not yet 
well defined. There is no lack of material or 
method, but all is unorganized, and much thought- 
ful study is needed to make it of use. The fol- 
lowing points are of importance: 
1. Material—In the nursery, the rhyme and the 
picture, with a few lines of rhythmic description, 
are the best material for the little child. The short 
lyric and ballad follow these, with the short story 
of the Peter Rabbit type. Later, in the home, the 
child will enjoy many old tales that friends and 
parents will repeat for him, but at this time the 
child is at the threshold of the kindergarten, and 
should find there waiting for him the folk-tale, some 
fairy tales, many simple tales of real life, and a 
plentiful supply of good, simple verse. A very 
large part of his English here should be the gaining 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    
60 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
of names of things and of meanings of words. If 
the wholesome habit should develop among the 
children of asking, “What does that mean?” the 
teacher may feel that she has added something to 
the prospect of increasing the supply of intelligent, 
fluent speech in the world. There is no book of 
stories or poems that can be recommended as a 
whole, since those produced for the kindergarten 
are too limited or lack literary and artistic value. 
Those for the primary grades are often equally 
inartistic and many of the stories too advanced— 
so that the teacher must make her own selection. 
In the first year, fifteen stories is a good allowance; 
in the second year, perhaps twenty. Stories for 
the first year should not require more than five 
minutes in the telling; those for the second year, 
not more than ten. 
2. Method.—Stories should be repeated often, 
if they are worth while, and a new story should 
always be told twice, or at least on successive days. 
They should be told without much gesture, and 
the teacher should never request the children to 
retell the story until they volunteer to do so. Parts 
and sentences only will be given at first; after a 
while the whole story will come. 
One source of success with the kindergarten 
teacher will be the tone of her voice and her manner 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
KINDERGARTEN 61 
of speaking. Little children are remarkably in- 
fluenced by these things; hence the teacher should 
take special note of the tone and manner of speak- 
ing of those who speak well, and should constantly 
cultivate her own power in this direction. The 
first essential quality is sincerity, which is a result 
of reality and earnestness in the teacher herself. 
Then come simplicity and fulness of tone—the 
head voice used but not forced, and every sentence 
and every word given its proper value. The voice 
should not be loud but clear and distinct, and the 
teacher should speak simply and as if she felt the 
importance of what she says. 
There are several good books now in use in 
method in story-telling. These should be con- 
sulted. In verse, two or four lines are sufficient 
at first, and the children should be encouraged to 
contribute from their store. But, by and by, two 
or three verses may be learned (these should be 
thoroughly learned), and it is well to give some 
lines of stately blank verse with a refrain. Rhyth- 
mic refrain is admirable for young children. 
Above all, the teacher should study the develop- 
ment of English work in some book like Chubb’s 
Teaching of English, so that she may realize the 
scope of the subject of which her work is a small 
part and get something of the inspiration that 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
62 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
comes from feeling the sweep of a large process 
and the co-operation in a fine purpose.

THE FIRST GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
The important_aim inthis grade is training in 
oral English. In all the exercises the children 
should use clear, natural, and pleasing tones of 
voice. The pupil should, however, become able 
to write his name and some words and sentences 
from the reading-lessons. Blackboard or large 
sheets of unglazed paper with soft pencil are the 
only suitable materials. The subjects for oral com- 
position should include all the current interests 
of the children. The following are the principal 
opportunities afforded for development in spoken 
language: 
1. Conversation and report.—The topics should 
be both interesting and instructive, and each lesson 
should proceed to a definite end. The following 
groups are suggested as typical: (a) home, father, 
occupations, plays, outings, pets; (6) baker, car- 
penter, postman, and other workers; (c) Colum- 
bus Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, 
Lincoln’s Birthday, Washington’s Birthday; (d) 
plants, trees, autumn, winter, spring; (e) pictures 
of action or situation, such as the best illustrations 
of Mother Goose, and pictures of children and 
63  
-P-A-G-E-74
    64 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
animals. Large pictures are required, and only 
those havirfg at least modest claims to artistic 
excellence should be used. (See the suggestions 
on literary study below.) 
2. Story-telling—The pupil should be given a 
single, complete impression of the whole. He 
should not be pressed to attempt to retell a story 
until he i 
grasped it sufficiently to ask intelligent questions 
about it. The teacher should be mindful through- 
out of the objective point and essential structure 
of the story, and should preserve its spirit. Con- 
versation concerning the meaning of the story 
should be carefully guided. Only the shorter 
stories as indicated in the list below are suitable 
for telling by the children. Graphic illustration 
is highly valuable, both for testing and for deepen- 
ing of the impression. By the end of the year 
each pupil should be able to tell several stories, 
from beginning to end, in a manner pleasing to 
the class. (See the suggestions on literary study 
below.) 
3. Dramatization—The more dramatic: stories 
and rhymes may well be acted out. The children 
should be encouraged to arrange the simple 
“properties,” to plan the acting, and to compose 
and perfect the dialogue.   
     
-P-A-G-E-75
    FIRST GRADE 65 
4. Memorizing poetry—The literary study of 
the grade involves learning by heart. (See the 
list of poems suggested.) Oral recitation is also 
a valuable discipline in language, provided it is 
genuine expression. 
WORD-STUDY 
After a suitable stock of type words has been 
acquired in the reading, systematic study of phonics 
should begin. Simple breathing exercises should be 
provided; also practice in pronunciation of words, 
pausing slightly on syllables without exaggerated 
lip or tongue movement, in enunciation of 7, &, 
@, @, 7, 4, 6 in connection with consonants, and in 
articulation of initial and final consonants, espe- 
cially p, t, b, s, m, m, g. Jingles may be repeated 
for increasing the flexibility and strength of lips and 
tongue. Words should be treated as wholes, and 
the sounds of syllables and letters learned in their 
connection. By grouping words in families, pupils 
may easily be led to observe the sound values for 
themselves. Such lessons may well take the form 
of lively, interesting word games. Each teacher 
should have at hand a table by which the work 
may be guided and systematized. As fast as 
knowledge of the sounds of the letters grows, it 
should be employed in making out new words in
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
the reading-lessons. The naming of the letters 
leads naturally to spelling. By the end of the 
year the members of the class should be able to 
spell many common words and should know the 
alphabet. Their progress in word-study may be 
judged by their ability to hear sounds and repro- 
duce them accurately, and by their recognition of 
written and printed words. 
READING 
The first lessons should be blackboard lessons 
made up from the conversations. The teacher 
should secure continuity, sequence, and unity, and 
should keep careful account of the growth in 
vocabulary. Some word drill is necessary. Les- 
sons based upon nursery rhymes which have been 
memorized may be made very effective. Pupils 
should be ready for a book in a few weeks, and 
should have access to several attractive, easy 
readers. Most children learn to read by them- 
selves when they have something they like to read. 
A suggested list appears below. The various reci- 
tations in reading should involve a wide range of 
interests, and should employ all avenues of both im- 
pression and expression. Distinctness and appro- 
priateness in the oral rendering should be secured. 
The preparatory and collateral work necessary to
-P-A-G-E-77
  FIRST GRADE 67 
the interest and appreciation of a lesson should be 
faithfully done. Isolation is the bane of the read- 
ing work. (See the section on Reading in the 
“Outline of Theory.’’) 
LITERATURE 
The impression should be conveyed orally, 
though poems may well be placed upon the board 
for incidental reading. The teacher’s voice and 
manner in telling and reciting should serve as an 
unconscious model for the children. Such ques- 
tions should be asked as will aid the children in 
realizing the piece in the imagination. Literature 
is suggestive and indirect; the teacher’s method 
must be of like character. The test of success is 
that the pupils enjoy an experience akin to that 
of which the selection is the adequate expression. 
Their literary sincerity must in no way be violated. 
The work with a poem should generally include 
memorizing and reciting by the pupils, and in the 
case of stories, telling or dramatizing. An effort 
has been made to include in the lists of stories 
and poems below only those selections which a 
little child can understand and appreciate. It 
does not follow, however, that because he gets 
something more than sound that he should be 
expected to render all the meaning in plain prose 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
or to analyze the effect which he has received. 
The value of the story or poem can be measured 
by the interest of the children and their desire to 
make it their own.

The shorter and simpler stories are marked with an asterisk. 
Most of these are suitable for dramatization. The name appended 
is usually that of a trustworthy editor. The initials indicate the 
titles of good sources of the story, which will be found in the list

  THE SECOND GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
Oral English should receive the main stress. 
The aim should include, not only phonetic and 
grammatical correctness, but also sequence, ac- 
curacy, and holding to the point. In the written 
work, pupils should learn to form sentences and 
small groups of sentences, expressing their own 
ideas gained from the various studies. They 
should also dictate to the teacher brief composi- 
tions to be written in paragraph form on the board. 
Lessons in nature and in civic life may briefly be 
summed up, and thoughts about pictures, stories, 
and poems expressed. There is no gain, however, 
in urging children to write at length before their 
knowledge of words is sufficient to prevent a multi- 
tude of errors. The important phases of the com- 
position work are: 
1. Conversation.—As in the first grade. Special 
exercises are unnecessary; the various subjects of 
study afford ample opportunity and demand this 
treatment. Guidance should be unobtrusive but 
faithful. Bear in mind particularly the possibilities 
of language development in the studies of : (a) primi- 
tive life; (6) nature; (c) pictures; (d) literature.

-P-A-G-E-84
  74 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
“ 2. Story-telling and dramatization—As in the 
first grade. Stories previously learned should be 
referred to and retold. Stories unused in the first 
year may now be taught. Original stories should 
be invited; good pictures will readily suggest in- 
cidents. The children should retell or act out only 
the stories that are short and simple in structure, 
and should be guided in preserving the sequence 
and emphasis of the original. If the reproduction 
grows out of a clear understanding, the more of 
the language of the story the children appropriate 
the better. 
3. Memorizing.—As in the first grade. Some 
of the very short pieces may be copied. 
4. Technical work.—Secure the correct use of 
such forms as the pupils require. These will in- 
clude indentation, certain uses of capitals, and 
punctuation with the period. 
WORD-STUDY 
Simple breathing exercises and practice in pro- 
nunciation as in the first grade. Articulation of 
consonants and molding of vowels should be care- 
fully guided. Employ the knowledge of phonics 
previously gained, and carry the work forward 
according to a definite plan. By the end of the 
year the pupils should be able to make out for 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  
SECOND GRADE 75 
themselves all phonetic words in their reading 
which are already in their oral vocabulary. 
Children in the second grade should lay the 
* foundation of a good habit of spelling. Accurate 
imaging of words, correct pronunciation, and 
graphic expression are the important factors. Oral 
spelling should accompany and advance beyond the 
written work, which is still limited. The pupils 
should spell freely the words they have known 
longest and have most commonly used. 
READING 
Pupils should read for the same reason as adults, 
that is, because they are interested. If the work 
of the first year has been skilfully done and a supply 
of suitable books is at hand, they will do so. The 
business of the teacher is to relate the lessons 
properly to the other activities, and to guide the 
children in forming a sound, adaptable habit of 
reading. A daily grind through a prescribed 
reader can never accomplish this. Discriminat- 
ing use should be made of the blackboard, of 
printed slips, and of such a variety of reading- 
books as is indicated below. In the oral reading 
distinctness, appropriate expression, and pleasing 
tones of voice should be secured. Pupils should not. 
try to give thought until they have thought to give. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
LITERATURE 
As in the first grade. Favorite stories should 
be dramatized, with due care for the development 
of good dialogue; and after the poems are under- 
stood, they should be memorized and recited as 
perfectly as possible. Many of the selections in the 
first-grade list appear in the reading-books men- 
tioned for this year. Pupils will obtain both 
pleasure and profit from reading these for them- 
selves. Selections should frequently be read to 
the class by the teacher, with no attempt at formal 
instruction. A list of books containing material 
adapted to this kind of treatment will be found in 
the Appendix. Such exercises, however, must on 
no account degenerate into mere filling of time. 
(See the section on Literature in the ‘‘Outline of 
Theory.’’) 
SToRIES 
As in Grade I, the following stories are suggested for literary 
study and incidental training in composition. The treatment 
should generally consist of telling by the teacher, but a few of 
the longer pieces are better adapted to reading than telling. In 
this, certain children may be able to assist. For explanation of 
the system of indexing see the first-year list.

THE THIRD GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
The growing importance of writing must not 
cause neglect of systematic instruction in oral com- 
position. The opportunities for training include: 
1. Recitation —The pupil’s effort at any time to 
say clearly and exactly what he observes, thinks, or 
knows should be regarded as composition and 
guided accordingly, with faithfulness and judg- 
ment. The conversational attitude should be 
preserved. 
2. Oral story—Repeating of stories should yield 
place slowly to original creation. Literature, 
pictures, nature, play, and work will readily pro- 
vide suggestive interests. The teacher’s chief 
business is to lead the children to realize their 
experience and to cast it in purposeful and well- 
planned expression. 
3. Writing—The written composition will in- 
volve the paragraph (sentence-group) as a unit of 
expression. The form and use of it can be easily 
learned from the readers. The pupils should be 
taught, in a simple way, how to think out a subject 
in parts and how to place these parts in a definite 
order. They should also learn to write simple 
81
-P-A-G-E-92
82 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
  dramatizations and letters of friendship. The 
poems to be learned should be copied in a special 
book, which may be illustrated. 
4. Technical work.—Without doubt the class will 
need to know: (a) that capitals are used to begin 
each line of verse, for certain abbreviations, in 
headings and titles, in writing initials, the pronoun 
I, the exclamation O, names of the months, etc., 
as well as at the beginning of each sentence; (0) 
that each sentence must end with a period, ques- 
tion mark, or exclamation point; (c) that the 
period is used with initials and abbreviations; (d) 
that the comma is used in certain parts of a letter 
and as an apostrophe in possessives; (e) that 
margins must be observed. Mistakes in grammar 
should generally be corrected when made. Drills 
to impress the correct forms will, at times, be 
necessary, but they should grow out of the actual 
situation and will vary with each class. 
WORD-STUDY 
Systematic work in phonics should be little 
needed after the third year. The acquirement of 
the pupils entering the class should be carefully 
estimated, and a series of lessons planned to sup- 
plement and complete what has been begun. Spell- 
ing should be closely related to the study of sounds
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THIRD GRADE 83 
and to the written composition. The drill to be 
provided should be determined by the progress of 
the class, but regular lessons will always be neces- ' 
sary. Practice in correct breathing and pronun- 
ciation should be continued. 
READING 
The process of reading should be fairly mastered 
by the close of the third year. To this end, a 
variety of books and other material should be 
employed, so as to provide abundant experience 
in getting thought and in conveying it. Stress 
should be laid upon the reading to the listening 
class of considerable portions of selections by 
individual pupils and upon the reading of “parts” 
in dialogue. Special pains should be taken to put 
interesting books in the way of backward pupils, 
and the voluntary reading of all should be unob- 
trusively guided. No pupil should be passed to 
the next grade who is unable to read and study the 
books he is required to use. 
LITERATURE 
As before, including memorizing and oral expres- 
sion. The reading-books for the grade are largely 
literary and contain versions of many stories and 
poems previously listed. At least one long story
-P-A-G-E-94
| 
84 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
which is made up of successive, well-defined units 
should be taught. The following are suggested: 
(x) Robinson Crusoe. The versions by McMurry 
and Allison are helpful as to the selection and 
adaptation of incidents, but the teacher should 
know the original thoroughly. (2) The Story of 
Troy: Bryant’s Iliad as the source; Gale’s Achilles 
and Hector and Church’s Stories from Homer for 
treatment. (3) The Story of Siegfried: Morris’ 
Sigurd the Volsung, and Volsunga Saga and Wag- 
ner’s Trilogy as the sources; Ragozin’s Siegfried and 
Beowulf, Baldwin’s Siegfried, Chapin’s Story of the 
Rhinegold, Barber’s Wagner Opera Stories, Maude’s 
Wagner’s Heroines, Young’s Wagner Stories as 
suggestive versions. The story should begin with 
the sword and end with the rescue of Brunhilda.

THE FOURTH GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
As in the third grade, but involving somewhat 
larger units, more definite knowledge of principles, 
and more self-reliance in creative effort. The 
activities include: 
1. Recitation.—As before, growth in the power of 
expression should keep pace with growth in knowl- 
edge and experience. It should be borne in mind, 
also, that the habit of care in the use of language 
must be constantly stimulated or it will readily 
give way before adverse influences. 
2. Oral story.—The emphasis should be upon 
original work. A beginning should be made in 
the definite study of story structure. Certain 
stories may be outlined by the class; the knowledge 
thus gained will aid the children in ordering the 
parts of their narratives. These should grow out 
of various interests. Specific problems in story 
composition should be arranged by the teacher, 
such as the completion of a story, the filling-out of 
an outline for a story, the telling of a story sug- 
gested by the picture of an action or a situation 
or by a connotative passage in literature, the mak- 
ing of an imaginary biography, etc. 
89 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
    go ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
3. Writing —Dramatizations should from time 
to time, be written out; likewise, some of the 
shorter narratives. The descriptive element in 
narration will require special attention but should 
be handled very simply. Many observations and 
experiences, both in school and out, will deserve 
formulation. The organization of the theme into 
sentences and paragraphs should be carefully 
directed. Feeling for order and connection may 
be cultivated by means of oral presentation. The 
class should learn how to make an outline of their 
material, but they should use the device sparingly. 
Continue practice in writing and sending letters of 
friendship. Let the pupils criticize their own 
written work before submitting it. 
4. Technical work.—See the third-grade outline. 
In addition, pupils will need to know how to write 
quotations, conversation, contractions, words in a 
series, and terms of address. The correct form 
should be learned from observation and enforced 
by practice. Incidental instruction in grammar 
should be given as needed. 
WORD-STUDY 
Occasional instruction in phonics and persistent 
effort to secure good pronunciation by training the 
ear constitute one phase; oral and written spelling
-P-A-G-E-101
FOURTH GRADE gt 
as determined by the actual needs, the other. The 
teacher should aim at the formation of a good 
habit of spelling as well as at the securing of imme- 
diate results. Make the attack versatile. (See 
the section on Spelling in the ‘Outline of Theory.”’) 
READING 
The material should be mainly literary. The 
practice in oral expression should be sufficient to 
enable all to read aloud pleasantly and intelligently. 
One of the principal aims should be to teach chil- 
dren how to study a book so as to grasp its essential 
meaning. 
. LITERATURE 
As before, but with more reading by the chil- 
dren and more mature handling of the various 
interests (see Chubb, Teaching of English, chap. 
vi). One or more of the following longer works 
should be taught, as in third grade: (x) Lisbeth 
Long frock, from the Norwegian of Hans Aanrud, 
by Laura E. Poulsson. This story contains much 
of the poetry of’the simple life. (2) The Story of 
Ulysses: Palmer’s or Bryant’s Odyssey as the source; 
Cook’s (Mrs. Gale’s) Ulysses, Church’s Stories 
from Homer, Perry’s The Boy’s Odyssey, Burt’s 
Odysseus as suggestive in treatment. (3) The 
Story of Beowulf: Earl’s Deeds of Beowulf, Hall’s  
-P-A-G-E-102
    
g2 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
Beowulf in Modern Verse, or Tinker’s Beowulf as 
the source; John Gibb’s Beowulf (in the Chil-

THE FIFTH GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
Consider carefully what has been attempted in 
the first four years. Keep the balance between 
practice in speaking and practice in writing. The 
tendency to dependence upon books, likely to 
become marked in the fifth grade, should be met 
with much invention based upon experience. 
Examples of good expression should be used to 
teach method, not to provide material already 
formulated. The definite instruction in facts and 
principles which should be given is indicated 
below. (See section IV under Composition in the 
“Outline of Theory.’’) 
1. Oral composition.—In all recitations, English 
or other, pupils should be taught to say clearly 
and coherently exactly what they mean. Repeat- 
ing of stories should usually be only a means to 
more perfectly ordered original work. Much of 
the material to be written should first be presented 
or discussed orally. Carry on the work suggested 
under Oral Story in the Fourth Grade. Discus- 
sion of current events and talks about books will 
be profitable. 
2. Written composition.—There should be many, 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
almost daily, short exercises and a few longer 
Papers as occasion demands. The various subject® 
of study, together with literary composition, will 
involve all the “forms of discourse,’ but, while 
definite instruction should be given, no attempt 
at a course in narration, exposition, etc., should be 
made. All the pupils should be able to plan their 
papers, to criticize their own first drafts, and to 
make definite suggestions upon the work of others. 
In letter-writing, as well as in other exercises, it will 
be found profitable to permit the class to relate, 
describe, or explain from the point of view of 
another; for example, a character in a story or a 
person on his travels. The letter of business 
should be taught—as far as possible through actual 
transactions. Pupils should always examine care- 
fully the corrections made by the teacher, and, 
unless the work is fairly good, should rewrite. 
3. Technical work.—Correct usage in the forms 
already employed should be insisted upon and 
additional usages explained as need arises. Teach 
the use of the hyphen in compound words and in 
word-breaking, and of the comma to separate the 
parts of a compound sentence and to set off phrases 
and responsives. 
Both reading and composition will require occa- 
sional instruction in grammar. Pupils should
-P-A-G-E-109
FIFTH GRADE 99 
fearn to distinguish subject and predicate, adjec- 
faye and adverbial modifers, pronoun and ante- 
cedent, correct verb forms, inflections of pronouns, 
plurals of nouns, and correct uses of common con- 
nectives. Attention to these facts should be 
entirely a part of, and contributory to, the work in 
reading and composition. 
WORD-STUDY 
The special work of the grade is to learn to use 
the dictionary. The class should learn not only 
what can be found in the book, but also when it 
should be appealed to. (See section VI under 
Word-Study in the “Outline of Theory.”) Spell- 
ing-lessons should be made up from the words the 
class are using, but there should be an attempt to 
group also, in order to teach principles of spelling. 
In this connection a good spelling-book is a useful] 
auxiliary. 
LITERATURE 
The study of literature will provide all the prac- 
tice in oral reading that is necessary. Pupils 
should be taught how to get the thought in all the 
texts and supplementary books used. Oral litera- 
ture and learning by heart should continue. 
Assignments should be definite and suggestive. 
Provide useful collateral material. (See the out- 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
line for the Fourth Grade; also Chubb, chap. ix, 
and the references on Literature in the ‘Outline 
of Theory.’’) The following are suggested as 
available for definite class reading and discussion: 
(1) A Dog of Flanders, by Louise de la Ramée. 
(2) Some Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, by 
Howard Pyle. The teacher should know the bal- 
lads and should develop carefully a healthy point 
of view. The versions by Lansing, Buckingham, 
and Tappan should be consulted (see MacClin- 
tock, chap. viii). (3) The Golden Fleece, by James 
Baldwin. Gayley’s Classic Myths and Morris’ 
Life and Death of Jason are useful; also the ver- 
sions by Kingsley, Church, Zimmern, Cox, and 
Niebuhr. (4) Favorite Greek Myths, by Lillian S. 
Hyde, supplemented by Peabody’s Old Greek Folk 
Stories, Carpenter’s Hellenic Tales, and Zimmern’s 
Old Tales from Greece. (5) Wood Folk at School, by 
William J. Long. (6) Poetry Reader, No. 5, by 
Katherine D. Blake and Georgia Alexander. (7) 
Fanciful Tales, by Frank Stockton, edited by 
Julia Langworthy. (8) Boy Life, selections from 
Howells, edited by Percival Chubb. 
PROSE 
The material in the following list, mostly stories, is intended 
to supplement the regular reader and the longer selections named 
above. When possible, the reading should be largely by the

THE SIXTH GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
_The suggestions for the fourth and fifth grades 
apply to the sixth. All the kinds of work there 
indicated should be continued. But there should 
be an appreciable advance in maturity of subject, 
range of ideas, and handling of technique. 
1. Oral composition—Topical recitation and 
report will afford varied opportunity for growth in 
speaking clearly, coherently, and to the subject. 
The pupil should be able to make and use an outline 
composed of the main heads of his talk. The sub- 
ject-matter should include not only bodies of facts 
gained from observation and reading, but also 
explanation of games and processes, defense of 
opinions, word-pictures, incidents, stories, sum- 
maries, etc. The speaker should face the class. 
They, in turn, should be guided in making definite, 
systematic, and kindly suggestions on both the 
matter and the method of the discourse, and in 
discovering the secret of effectiveness. 
2. Written composition—Writing should freely 
and easily interchange with the speaking outlined 
above and should frequently follow it, especially in 
case the subject is not already familiar and well 
105
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
in hand. A wide range of interests should be 
involved, and the conditions under which the writ- 
ing proceeds should be wisely varied. Selection 
and arrangement of nfaterial should be learned, in 
part, from the study of good examples. Some of 
these should be outlined and summarized. Pupils 
should be able to tell in one sentence what a para- 
graph or a whole composition is about. Topical 
criticism should be practiced, both by the indi- 
vidual and by the class. Occasionally papers 
should be returned for correction or revision after 
several days have elapsed. The standard symbols 
should be used. Class choice, opportunity to 
publish, actual correspondence, dramatization for 
an entertainment, actual biography, and keeping 
a diary are among the means of providing strong 
motives. 
3. Technical work.—The knowledge of punctua- 
tion, of the use of capitals, of grammatical forms, 
of abbreviations, and of the conventional arrange- 
ment of the parts of letters and manuscripts which 
the work of previous years has required should be 
gathered up, enforced, and extended so as to keep 
pace with the maturing efforts of the pupils. Exer- 
cises in examining the pages of books and magazines 
and in dictation should be arranged, when necessary 
to fix certain facts. Pupils should be able to
-P-A-G-E-117
        
   
                                  
    
          
          
    SIXTH GRADE 107 
understand and apply criticisms made in terms of 
grammar, and they should learn how to transform, 
combine, condénse, and otherwise vary their sen- 
tences so as to say more exactly or more pleasantly 
what they have to say. 
WORD-STUDY 
Make sure that all the pupils can use the dic- 
tionary profitably. They should be able to in- 
dicate pronunciation by means of diacritics and 
to distinguish synonyms. To the various word 
exercises already indicated should be added the 
grouping of words having the same prefix or other 
common element, in order to secure a useful key 
to meanings and also to make a beginning in the 
study of word-formation. A lively interest in 
words as living things will go far to improve both 
spelling and usage. 
LITERATURE 
Appreciative oral reading, reading by the teacher, 
and learning by heart should continue. Rapid 
‘handling to enable a grasp of the meaning and 
structure of the whole should generally precede 
close study. Directive questions upon the various 
literary interests should be carefully prepared and 
assigned, so as to insure definite, purposeful work.
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
Reading or recitation should close the studies, in 
order that the spirit of the piece as an imaginative 
unit may be duly impressed. 
The sixth-grade class has read sufficiently in 
certain authors, notably Longfellow, to make it 
desirable to dwell somewhat upon his life and work 
as a whole. The pupils should be led also to 
associate pieces from various authors which are 
similar in subject or in form. The aim should be 
to organize the child’s literary knowledge and make 
it readily serviceable. 
The following are named as representative class 
studies: (1) Heidi, from the German of Frau 
Johanna Spyri, by Helen B. Dole; the story of a 
little Swiss girl. (2) The Story of the Iliad, by 
Alfred J. Church; Baldwin’s The Golden Age, 
Jebb’s Homer, Seymour’s Greek Life in the Homeric 
Age, a historical atlas, and ene or more standard 
translations should be on the desk. (3) Norse 
- Stories, by Hamilton Wright Mabie. Kearey’s 
Heroes of Asgard, Guerber’s Myths of Northern 
Lands, and Anderson’s Norse Mythology are some 
of the best references. (4) Lobo, Rag, and Vixen, 
by Ernest Thomson-Seton. (5) Tales of a Wayside 
Inn, by Henry W. Longfellow. (6) Poetry Reader, 
No. 6, by Katherine D. Blake and Georgia Alex- 
ander. (7) A Christmas Carol (shortened version),

  THE SEVENTH GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
The various activities suggested for the fourth, 
fifth, and sixth grades should be carried forward. 
The advance should appear, not only in scope of 
ideas, increased vocabulary, and more perfect 
technique, but also in a more analytic attitude. 
The fundamental laws of grammar and composi- 
tion should be clearly and simply presented, so 
as to enable the pupils to apply them in a practical 
way, both in self-criticism and in class exercises. 
The pupils hould also be able to use books of 
reference, to gather material, and, in general, to 
rely upon themselves. 
1. Oral composition.—The oral exercises should 
be as carefully planned and directed as the written. 
Extend the use of the topical outline. Aim to cul- 
tivate an ear for sentence euphony. Errors should 
often be corrected by reference to the principle 
or standard of use involved. Oral reports of home- 
reading, occasional hours of recitation or story- 
telling, and organized discussions of current events 
may be very profitable. Every pupil in the class 
should be able to speak clearly and connectedly upon 
any topic concerning which he has information. 
113 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  1147 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
2. Written composition.—Definite instruction in 
the selection and organization of material and in 
methods of treatment to secure interest should be 
given. One effective means is the analysis of 
kindred examples. Such principles as unity, 
sequence, beginning, ending, development of the 
paragraph, and choice of title should be taught and 
applied. With the outline may be coupled the 
summary and with the oral report, the written 
review or character sketch. Stories should be 
criticized as to interest, climax, dialogue, and set- 
ting; descriptions, as to vividness and point of 
view; expositions, as to plan, paragraphing, clear- 
ness, and accuracy. The pupils should be familiar 
with the standard symbols used in correction and 
should, as far as possible, find their own errors. 
There should be practice in impromptu composi- 
tion, occasionally with time limit, and in condens- 
ing several paragraphs into one. 
3. Technical work.—The reasons for adhering to 
the standard usage in matters of form should be 
given. Something of the logic of punctuation 
should be discovered. There will be need of cer- 
tain uses of the colon, the semicolon, and the dash. 
Notes of invitation and reply should be taught. 
Various topics in grammar will require some- 
what extended treatment, but grammar and com-     
                                             
           
-P-A-G-E-125
  SEVENTH GRADE II§ 
position should constitute a single course. The 
pupils should know with assurance when they 
have a sentence, they should be able to distinguish 
the larger elements and their functions, and they 
should be able to transform, combine, condense, or 
expand for euphony, clearness, or exactness. 
Special attention should be given to word-order 
and to connectives. 
WORD-STUDY 
The pupils should be taught to make sure of the 
spelling and pronunciation of new words. The 
word-lessons should be planned, in part, so as to 
exemplify certain facts and principles or to correct 
common errors. All forms of memory should be 
employed, but the writing of words in context 
should be regarded as the final test. The study 
of word-composition should continue as in the sixth 
grade. 
LITERATURE 
Attention should be directed to the artistic 
purpose and method as well as to the thought. 
The full meaning and pleasure of a book can be 
conveyed only to the reader who observes and 
appreciates the artistic elements and devices which 
have been employed. The way of approach should
-P-A-G-E-126
       116 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
be, as hitherto, through setting and the larger 
whole to relation of parts and beauty of details. 
Directive questions, varied expressional activities, 
illustrative materials, biography, and comparative 
citation should combine to render the experience 
notable and educative. It would be appropriate 
to dwell somewhat upon the lives and works of 
Irving and Whittier. 
The following are suggested as representative 
class studies: (1) Knickerbocker Stories from Irving, 
edited by Edward Everett Hale, Jr. This is No. 
23 of the Standard Literature Series. It contains 
“Rip Van Winkle,” “The Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow,” and other Dutch-American sketches. (2) 
King Arthur Stories from Malory, by Lillian O. 
Stevens and Edward Frank Allen. The version 
by Sidney Lanier and that by Dr. Edward Brooks 
are also suitable. The class should have access 
to Malory’s Morte Arthure, Pyle’s Men of Iron, 
Gautier’s Chivalry, and a collection of pictures. 
Certain passages from Tennyson’s Idylls of the King 
and the tournament chapter in Ivanhoe will be 
useful. (3) “Evangeline,” by Henry W. Long- 
fellow. (4) ‘“Snow-Bound” and other poems, by 
John G. Whittier. (5) Julius Caesar, by William 
Shakespeare. Emphasis should be placed upon 
the character of Brutus. (6) A-Hunting of the

     THE EIGHTH GRADE 
COMPOSITION 
The point of view should be the same as in the 
preceding grades. The emphasis should be placed, 
as in the seventh grade, upon intelligent self- 
direction in accordance with a few fundamental 
principles of expression. Care should be exercised 
to secure fresh and more advanced materials and 
to vary the conditions, in order that interest may 
be kept up and that genuine power and versatility 
in speaking and writing may be developed. Not 
fewer than two or three lessons each week should 
be given. Each teacher should assure herself as 
to what ability the members of a particular class 
actually possess and should plan the year’s work 
with a view to rounding out and completing the 
training which the course as a whole contemplates. 
In doing so, the practical demands of life in a 
society should be regarded as paramount to every 
other consideration. Occasional oral debates and 
frequent short written exercises are recommended. 
Certain class books, intended primarily for the 
high school, would provide useful material for both 
teacher and pupils. Such are: Lewis’ First 
Manual of Composition, Baker and Abbott’s 
r2r 
    
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
English Composition, Thomas’ Composition and 
Rhetoric, Crandall’s First-Year English Book, and 
Gardiner, Kittredge, and Arnold’s Elements of 
* “English Composition. 
GRAMMAR 
A systematic course in the English sentence, 
its parts and elements, the functions and properties 
of words, should occupy from two to four recita- 
tions throughout the year. The aim should be to 
secure first-hand observation, discrimination, ac- 
curate statement, and resulting improvement in 
study and expression. Inductive handling of cur- 
rent prose and of the compositions of the pupils 
will be far more profitable than conning a book. 
The pupils had better compile books of their own, 
using occasionally a good modern grammar as a 
reference. The work should be constructive 
throughout, and the connection between the exer- 
cises in grammar and the practice of correctness in 
speech and writing should be definitely and effect- 
ively made. The studies should be topical and 
progressively connected, beginning with the sen- 
tence as a whole. The important facts should be 
grouped repeatedly from new points of view, in 
order that they may be seen, not merely as items, 
but as parts of an organized body of knowledge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
EIGHTH GRADE 123 
Above all, glibness of analysis according to some 
formula must not be mistaken for thinking or actual 
perception of relations. (See the section on Engs 
lish Grammar in the “Outline of Theory.”) At 
the end of the year, the pupils should be able to 
explain in standard terminology the function of 
each part or element of any sentence (not idiom) 
which they can compose, and should have firmly 
established the habit of applying the standards of 
usage in self-criticism. 
WORD-STUDY 
The character and emphasis of the work should 
be determined as in the case of composition. In 
organizing the various kinds of lessons that will be 
required, such word books as the following will be 
of assistance: Frazier’s National Speller, Scheppe’s 
Advanced Word Studies, Daly’s Advanced Rational 
Speller, Webster’s New Standard Speller, the Bailey- 
Manley Spelling-Book. 
LITERATURE 
The kind of work indicated for the seventh grade 
should be continued. The typical interests in a 
variety of selections of suitable maturity should 
be simply, but clearly and definitely, presented. 
Generalizations concerning literary method should
-P-A-G-E-134
124. ELEMENTARY COURSE IN ENGLISH 
be very few, but the pupils should be able to read 
a masterpiece with some genuine appreciation of 
its literary ‘‘values.” One excellent gauge of 
taste and ability is voluntary reading. With this 
the teacher should keep in sympathetic touch, and 
from it she should determine, in part, what the 
class need and what kind of good reading they can 
most easily like. Some attention should be de- 
voted to the lives and works of Walter Scott, 
Charles Dickens, James Russell Lowell, John 
Burroughs, and Robert Louis Stevenson. 
The following are suggested as representative 
class studies. At least one from each group should 
be selected, usually the first. (x) Treasure Island, 
by Robert Louis Stevenson; Ivanhoe, by Walter 
Scott; David Copperfield (childhood and youth), 
by Charles Dickens. (2) The Merchant of Venice, 
The Tempest, by William Shakespeare; Rolfe’s 
Shakespeare the Boy and Bennett’s Master Skylark 
will be useful. (3) The Lady of the Lake, The 
Lay of the Last Minstrel, by Walter Scott; Sokrab 
and Rustum, by Matthew Arnold; Story of Chaucer’s 
Canterbury Pilgrims, by Katherine Lee Bates. 
(4) A Moosehead Journal and Other Papers (No.

plated. Only occasional use is intended, and, in 
some cases, only a few selections from a book should 
be used. The list is meant to be representative, 
not exhaustive. The volumes can be obtained 
from any reliable bookseller.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION. 
rd 
Tur present volume is an attempt to be of service 
to those who are beginning the study of our language, 
or who desire to acquaint themselves with a few speci- 
mens of our earliest literature. It has seemed to the 
author that there were two extremes to be avoided 
in its compilation—the treatment of Old English as 
though it consisted of wholly isolated phenomena, and 
the procedure upon a virtual assumption that the student 
was already acquainted with the cognate Germanic tongues 
and with the problems and methods of comparative phi- 
lology. The former treatment robs the study of its 
significance and value, which, like that of most other 
subjects, is found in its relations; the latter repels and 
confounds the student at a stage when he is most in 
need of encouragement and attraction. 
How well the author has succeeded must be left to 
the judgment of others—the masters whom he follows 
at a distance, and the students whose interests. he has 
constantly borne in mind. Of one thing, however, he 
can assure such as may care to inspect his book —that 
he has spared no pains in treading the path which 
seemed to be thus marked out for him in advance. Errors 
there doubtless are, — errors of judgment, and errors of 
fact; but for both he must plead the best excuse ever

offered for similar imperfections, that of King Alfred 
in the last sentence on page 162 of this volume. 
The selections have been made with reference to giving 
a fairly just, though necessarily incomplete, view of the 
surroundings, occupations, problems, ideals, and senti- 
ments of our English ancestors. The earlier pieces .of 
both prose and poetry are short; the longer ones that 
follow either have more sustained interest, or are sup- 
ported by their reference to preceding ones; but they, 
too, fall into natural subdivisions, partially indicated in 
the printing, so that they may be read as successions 
of short extracts. 
It may be objected that Latin and Greek have been 
too freely used for illustration. The reply to such an 
objection is twofold: that the book is likely to fall 
into the hands of some who possess at least an elemen- 
tary acquaintance with one or both of these languages, 
and that to these the disclosure of the relations involved 
in a comparison with the ancient tongues will materially 
increase their pleasure and their gain; and, secondly, that 
the book may be intelligently read, from cover to cover, 
without the slightest knowledge of either Greek or Latin. 
The passages from Bede have been taken from Miller’s 
edition ; the portion of Ailfric’s Colloquy from the Wright- 
Wiilker Vocabularies; the extracts from Wulfstan from 
Napier’s edition; the selections from Beowulf and Andreas 
are based upon the Grein-Wiilker edition of the Bibliothek 
der angelsiichsischen Poesie; that from the Judith upon my 
own edition. The originals of the others are either indi- 
cated, or will be patent to scholars.

  PREFACE. vii 
The normalization of the texts to an Early West Saxon 
basis —Cosijn’s Altwestsiichsische Grammatik being the 
chief authority for norms—will doubtless be criticised 
by some scholars whose judgment is entitled to respect; 
but here again the author has had in mind the beginner, 
for whose especial use the book is intended. If he wel- 
comes this introduction on account of its greater ease, 
and is yet not led astray by it; if, he becomes solidly 
grounded in the elements, so that further progress is 
facilitated, while yet he has nothing to unlearn in the 
future; the author will be consoled by his approbation 
for the censure of those who entertain a different opinion 
on this head. 
To the normalization of the texts exception has been 
made in the case of the poetry. For this there are two 
reasons. In spite of the greater difficulty of the poetry, 
the student should have had sufficient practice in reading, 
and particularly in parsing—the importance of which 
cannot be too much insisted upon—to proceed in the 
poetry without great obstruction from the retention of 
manuscript forms, especially as the cross-references of the 
Vocabulary will furnish him with the necessary assist- 
ance; and, secondly, the normalization of the poetry would 
sometimes have been attended with considerable uncer- 
tainty, an uncertainty which is decidedly less in the case 
of the prose. Besides, such profit as accrues to the 
student from the inspection of the irregular orthography 
of the manuscripts may, by the literal reproduction of 
the orthography, be gained from this part. 
The device noted on page 202 is presented with some

persuasion of its utility, though frankly as an experi- 
ment on which the author would gladly take, after 
sufficient trial, the judgment of his colleagues. 
The Grammar is the merest outline. Its condensation 
has been largely effected by confining the treatment ~ 
almost entirely to Old English itself, excluding all refer- 
ences to the theoretical Primitive Germanic. This method 
is accompanied with some loss; but, again, it is the 
beginner whom the author has had in view. More doubt- 
ful, perhaps, is the expediency of an empirical classi- 
fication of nouns, instead of the scientific arrangement 
according to stems; many of us have unquestionably 
found, however, that the more purely scholarly classi- 
fication occasions not a little trouble in practice, and that 
its theoretical advantages are dearly purchased at this 
stage, before there is any adequate conception of com- 
parative philology and its postulates. The author is not 
so clear with regard to the probable utility of paragraphs 
12-14, on original and derivative vowels; criticism on this 
point will be especially welcome. 
The Appendixes include illustrative matter for which 
there was no natural place elsewhere, or materials and 
hints for those who would prosecute their researches a 
little further. The first three of them carry their mean- 
ing on their face; the last is provided in order to facilitate 
the beginning of dialectic study. It— Appendix IV. — 
has cost more thought than is likely to appear on the 
surface. The dialects have as yet been but imperfectly 
discriminated ; it is easier to say what is non-West Saxon 
than what is Mercian or Kentish; the residuum of demon-

  PREFACE. ix 
strably pure Northumbrian forms in Cadmon’s Hymn, for 
example, turns out to be surprisingly small. 
Care has been devoted to the unification of the book — 
to making its parts mutually coherent; the illustrations 
of syntax are therefore taken from the texts printed in 
the Reader, and the Vocabulary contains copious refer- 
ences to the Grammar. It is hoped that this plan will 
prevent distraction on the part of the student, and con- 
duce to a nearly absolute mastery of the matter here pre- 
sented. The book ought to occupy at least a semester, 
and could readily be used for a longer time. The author 
believes that the history of the English language may 
most profitably begin with such a manual, studied under 
a competent teacher and with access to a few good refer- 
ence books. Thus used, it might advantageously be intro- 
duced into the earlier part of College courses, and perhaps 
into the better sort of High Schools and Academies. 
In conclusion, it is a pleasure to the author to acknowl- 
edge his indebtedness to Miss Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, 
graduate student of Yale University and American Fellow 
of the Association of Collegiate Alumnz, who has rendered 
material assistance in the preparation of the Vocabulary.

  PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. 
—ro- 
Tue favorable reception accorded to the first edition 
has encouraged the author, besides correcting several 
small errors, to amplify Appendix I., and to add a new 
Appendix, numbered V. The provision of a brief bibli- 
ography has been so generally welcomed that it has 
seemed desirable to append a list of books of a more 
advanced character, while retaining the former one essen- 
tially unchanged. No attempt at completeness has been 
made, but perhaps not many books of primary value have 
been omitted. The illustration of umlaut from Gothic, 
suggested by a reviewer, now constitutes Apperidix V. 
Certain teachers having expressed a wish that the 
Vocabulary should give the gender of nouns, the author 
thinks it proper to state the principle upon which the 
designation of gender was omitted. This principle was 
that the Grammar should be in constant use. The car- 
dinal use of a knowledge of the gender is with reference 
to declension; given the declension, and the gender fol- 
lows. Now the references to the Grammar under nouns 
primarily jndicate the declensions. If, then, the student 
recognizes the meaning of such references as 43, 47, etc., 
it is a proof that he is sufficiently acquainted with the 
paradigms they indicate; if not, it is a clear sign that 
he ought to refer to them, and that a mere knowledge

of the gender would not suffice. This is the author’s 
opinion, but he holds himself prepared to defer to the 
expressed wish of his colleagues, when he can believe 
that that wish is at all general among those who have 
given the book a fair trial. 
The author hopes soon to issue a small companion 
volume of exercises in Old English, designed chiefly to 
facilitate drill on inflections.. These exercises will con- 
sist of brief sentences for translation into Old English, 
based upon the successive prose selections of the Reader, 
together with an English-Old English Vocabulary. 
A final word to those who use this book — a word 
based upon experience with it: Look up carefully every 
foot-note, and constantly refer from the Vocabulary to the 
Grammar, with reference to the speedy mastery of the latter, 
supplementing this process by the committal to memory of 
paradigms.

  PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

In this edition Appendix I. has again been revised and 
amplified ; Appendix VI. has been added, as Appendix IV. 
was in the second edition; and a few minor errors have been 
corrected, 
Certain kindly critics have desired changes which would 
virtually mean the introduction of a larger element of com- 
parative Germanics, but I have not seen my way clear to 
satisfy them, for the reasons stated on p. viii; such persons 
can always find what they desire in Sievers’ Old English 
Grammar, in Biilbring’s Altenglisches Elementarbuch, or in 
my Phonological Investigation of Old English. Any curi- 
osity about the general appearance of the other Germanic 
tongues may now be gratified by a glance at Appendix VI. 
The Haercises in Old English, based principally upon the 
earlier prose texts of this book, has proved its utility as a 
means of securing grammatical drill with a comparatively 
small expenditure of effort and time, and may therefore be 
commended to teachers with some confidence.

  INTRODUCTION. 
—+o-—— 
Dialects and Periods. 
1. Old English (sometimes called Anglo-Saxon) is 
the name of the Germanic language spoken in Eng- 
land between the middle of the fifth and the middle 
of the twelfth century. Its literature extends from 
the eighth to the twelfth century, and there are no 
Old English words found in documents earlier than 
the seventh century. The principal prose texts date 
from the period of King Alfred (871-901 a.p.), or 
from that of Abbot Aélfric (pronounced Alfric), who 
flourished about the year 1000 a.p. The poetical 
pieces are mostly of uncertain dates, ranging from 
the eighth to the tenth or eleventh century. 
There are four dialects of Old English, the Nor- 
thumbrian, Mercian, Kentish, and West Saxon; of 
these the Mercian is intermediate in its characteris- 
tics between the Northumbrian and West Saxon. The 
Northumbrian dialect formed the basis of modern 
Scotch and Northern English, the Mercian of stand- 
ard literary English. The literature of Old English 
is chiefly extant in West Saxon, though the poetry, 
3
-P-A-G-E-18
  
4 INTRODUCTION. 
and some of the prose, contains forms from other dia- 
lects, chiefly from the Northumbrian. 
Since the remains of the other dialects are compara- 
tively small, West Saxon is the principal existing 
representative of Old English, and hence the two 
terms are often used interchangeably. West Saxon 
is divided into Early West Saxon (EWS.) and Late 
West Saxon (LWS.). The former is the language as 
written in King Alfred’s time, the latter as in that 
of Abbot /®lfric and his successors. A hundred years 
made some changes in the language, but rather with 
respect to syntax, euphony, and style in general than 
to the forms of words, though these also underwent 
some modification. 
In this work, the forms are those of Early West 
Saxon, which is assumed as the standard, even when 
the selections are from Late West Saxon.

Letters and Sounds. 
2. Alphabet. — The Old English alphabet has the let- 
ters of Modern English, with the exception of J, k, q, 
v, and z, and with the addition of 3 and p, both of 
which represent the modern th. Of these, 7 and v 
are never used, being represented by g (or i) and f, 
respectively; &, g, and 2 but rarely, & being commonly 
represented by ¢, ks(es) by x, g(w) by e(w), and 
z by ts. The two unfamiliar characters 9 and p are 
pronounced eth (eth in brethren) and thorn, respec- 
tively; they are used interchangeably in the manu- 
scripts; in this book 9 will, in general, stand for both. 
8. Vowels and diphthongs. — The vowel-letters are 
those of Modern English, with the addition of 2. Mod- 
ern editors employ e and ¢ to denote respectively an e 
and o which sprang from an original a (but ¢ occasion- 
ally from 0; 17, 25). The vowels may be either short 
or long. 
The diphthongs are represented by ea, eo, and ie, 
both short and long. The second’ vowel sound in 
each diphthong is scarcely heard in pronunciation, the 
first element being the one which receives the stress. 
5
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 PHONOLOGY. 
The vowel of every syllable is to be pronounced, but in 
an unstressed syllable the sound is less distinct (23). 
4. Quantity. — Long vowels and diphthongs must be 
carefully distinguished from short ones. In normal- 
ized texts, length is indicated by the acute accent (’) 
or the macron (~), placed over a vowel or the first 
element of a diphthong. For instance, OE. god is 
Mod. Eng. god, but OE. géd or god is Mod. Eng. 
good; so for, for, but for, went; beer, bare, but br, 
bier; ac, but, but ac, oak; geat, gate, but géat, 
poured ; is, is, but is, ice; man, man, but man, crime ; 
tol, toll, but t6l, tool; wende, went, but wénde, weened. 
Beginners should never fail to note whether the radi- 
cal vowel of each word is long or short, and should 
no more confound a with @ than a with y. 
The length of a syllable must be distinguished from 
that of a vowel. Every syllable containing a long 
vowel is itself long, but so is also one which con- 
tains a short vowel followed by any two consonants 
or a double consonant. In the latter case, the syllable 
is said to be long by position; in the former, by nature. 
5. Pronunciation of vowels and diphthongs. — The pro- 
nunciation of the vowels and diphthongs can only be 
mastered by ignoring their pronunciation in Modern 
English. Any modern language, or Latin or Greek as 
pronounced by the Continental method, would be a 
safer guide.
-P-A-G-E-21
  LETTERS AND SOUNDS. 7 
The exact pronunciation of the Old English vowels 
and diphthongs can be but imperfectly represented. 
The learner will not be far astray if he follows the 
pronunciation indicated in this table: —

Norr. — The true sounds of y and ¥ are most readily produced 
by placing the lips in the position for pronouncing long oo, and, 
while retaining the lips in this position, pronouncing respectively 
the i in it, and the ee in deem. 
6. Consonants. — The consonants are divided into — 
labials, w, m, p, b, f. 
dentals, r, 1, n, t, a, 9, s. 
gutturals (sometimes ‘palatals), (ng), ¢, g, h. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 PHONOLOGY. 
7. Pronunciation of consonants. —w was pronounced 
as in Mod. Eng., also distinctly in the combinations 
wr, wl; m, p, and b as in Mod. Eng.; f as f and as 
v (2). 
r and 1 were pronounced nearly as in Mod. Eng. (but 
see 21); n, t,d,as in Mod. Eng.; 9 as th in thin and 
in the ; sas s and as z. 
ng was pronounced like Mod. Eng. ng in finger ; 
when palatal (10) it resembled ng in singe. e¢ was pro- 
nounced like Mod. Eng. £, or, when palatal, like English 
ch in child, and was distinctly heard as & in the com- 
bination en; eg like dg in Mod. Eng. bridge (see 11). 
g was pronounced as gy (but see 9) and as y (10). h 
was pronounced as in English, even in the combinations 
hl, hn, hr, hw; when final, and in the combinations ht, 
hd, and bh, it had the sound of German ch, as in ach 
or in ich. hs was pronounced like Mod. Eng. x (cf. 2). 
‘When e was pronounced as &, g as g, and h as Ger- 
man ch in ach, these letters are to be regarded as gut- 
turals; when as ch in child, y, and ch in ich respectively, 
as palatals (10). 
8. Surds and sonants.— The consonants p, t, ¢, to- 
gether with f, s, © when pronounced like Mod. Eng. 
Ff, 8, th in thin, are called surds. All the other con- 
sonants, and all the vowels ‘and diphthongs, are called 
sonants. 
f, s, and 8 are surds when beginning. a syllable, or 
following a surd at the end of a syllable; they are 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  LETTERS AND SOUNDS. 3) 
sonants, that is, are pronounced like v, z, and th in 
the, when they occur between two sonants, or follow 
a sonant at the end of a syllable. To the foregoing 
rule there may be some exceptions ; in case of doubt, 
the analogy of Modern English may be followed. 
9. Spirants and stops. — Spirants are consonantal 
sounds producible by a continuous emission of breath. 
Stops are momentary or explosive. The spirants are 
f, s, 3, and h (properly also g); to f and 9 correspond 
the surd stops p and t, and the sonant stops b and d. 
10. Gutturals and palatals.— The consonants ¢, g, h, 
are gutturals when occurring before consonants or the 
vowels a, 4, 6, 0, Q, 5, u, a, y, and ¥ (and sometimes 
%). They are palatals when occurring before, and 
sometimes after, the palatal vowels 2, e, ¢, i, i, ea, Ga, 
e€0, &o, ie, ie (sometimes %); ¢ and g medially (that is, 
in the middle of a word), when they are or may be fol- 
lowed by e or i; ¢ likewise in the combination se (pro- 
nounced almost like sh); g in the medial combination 
eg; and ¢(ce, ne), g(ng) often medially and finally after 
a palatal vowel, but at least ng not always: e.g., engel, 
Englise have not ng = 7j. For the pronunciation of 
these consonants as palatals see 7. 
11. Double consonants. — Double consonants must 
not be pronounced as in Mod. Eng., except at the end 
of a syllable. When medial, each consonant is pro- 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 PHONOLOGY. 
nounced separately: sunnum as sun-num, the n’s as 
in Mod. Eng. penknife. 
Double f, when sonant, is always represented by bb, 
and double g is usually written eg. The only con- 
sonant never doubled is w. 
Effects and Relations of Sounds. 
12. Original and derivative vowels. — Of the vowels 
and diphthongs of Old English, some are original, in 
the sense of being more directly an inheritance from 
the Parent Germanic tongue, while others are deriva- 
tive, or result from modifications of those that we call 
original. 
The original vowels and diphthongs are the fol- 
lowing : — 
a, @, 2, & (sometimes), e, & (rarely), i (sometimes), 
i, o, 6, u (regularly), ti, Ga, 60 (sometimes). 
The derivative vowels and diphthongs are : — 
ze (sometimes), % (sometimes), ¢, € (usually), i 
(sometimes), Q, u (occasionally), y, ¥, ea, eo, 60 (some- 
times), ie, ie. Though ea, eo, ie when short are all 
derivatives, ie may be called a derivative of the sec- 
ond order, since it arises from one of the two others. 
13. Relation of original to derivative vowels. — The 
relations between original and derivative vowels may 
thus be shown (see 17, 18, 20, 21, 25):—

Occasionally (28, 29, 30) 2% is derived from a, 6 from 
e, i from i, 6 from o or a, & from u, ¥ from y, 
éa from ea, and &0 from eo. Rarely are o and u 
derived from e and i (26).
-P-A-G-E-26
  12 PHONOLOGY. 
Tt must be observed that not every vowel standing in 
the column of derivatives belongs exclusively there. Thus 
i, for example, is sometimes original (12). 
15. Umlaut.— Umlaut is a change effected in the 
vowel of a stressed syllable by the vowel of a following, 
usually the next following, syllable. 
There are two chief kinds of umlaut, the i-umlaut 
(pron. th'-oom'-lowt), and the u- or o-umlaut (00- or dh-). 
16. The i-umlaut.—i-umlaut is a change effected in 
a vowel or diphthong by palatalization, such palatal- 
ization consisting in an approximation of the umlauted 
vowel or diphthong to the sound of i (th). The cause 
of i-umlaut was in all cases an i or a j (pronounced like 
Mod. Eng. y) of a following syllable, but the i or j 
usually disappeared before the period of historic Old 
English, or was turned into e. When the word umlaut 
is used without qualification, i-cumlaut is to be under- 
stood. See Appendix V. 
17. Illustrations of i-umlaut.— The effect of i-umlaut

Examples are: mann (man), menn (men); lar 
(lore), lz%ran (teach); helpan (help), hilpd (helps); 
menn (man), menn (men); oxa (or), exen (oxen); 
dom (doom), déman (judge); wulle (wool), wyllen 
(woollen); briican (use), brycd (uses); eald (old), 
ieldu (age); héah (high), hiehra (higher); weorpan 
(throw), wierpd (throws); hréowan (rue), hriewd 
(rues). 
Sometimes two words are so related that y seems 
to be i-umlaut of 0, like gold (gold), gylden (golden) ; 
but in such cases the o came from an earlier u. 
The umlaut of a is generally e, but in some words 
ze is found. 
Strictly speaking, i is not the umlaut of e, but the 
phenomenon, though resulting from a somewhat dif- 
ferent cause, is virtually the same. 
18. Palatal influence. — Initial g, ¢, and se, change 
ze (from a) to ea, ® to éa, and @, e to ie; and se 
sometimes changes a to ea, & to Ga, o to eo, and & 
to 60. Examples: gef (gave), geaf; g&fon (gave, 
plur.), géafon; sceppan (create), scieppan; gefan 
(give), giefan; scacan (shake), sceacan; sc&dan 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 PHONOLOGY. 
(separate), scéadan; scop (poet), sceop; scdh (shoe), 
scéoh. Even éo from i: scéor, from seir, shower. 
In the following words, the ge represents original j 
(pron. y): geoe, yoke (orig. joc); geond, through 
(orig. jond); geong, young (orig. jung); geogud, 
youth (orig. jugud); géomor, grief (orig. jomor) ; 
géa, yea (orig. ja); géar, year (orig. jar); ge, ye 
(orig. j&). Perhaps better seceadan, gedmor, etc. 
The i found in the present stem of some weak. verbs 
(416) stands for oziginal j (pron. y), and, as g repre- 
sents this j in the words just instanced, so it often 
appears in the endings of these weak verbs, sometimes 
alone, sometimes followed by e, sometimes in one of 
these two forms preceded by i. Thus nerian, save, 
occurs also as nergan, nerigan, nerigean, etc.; the 
ind. pres. 1st sing. merie as nerge, nerige, etc. 
Wherever in or just preceding the inflectional end- 
ing of a word, ¢ or g is followed by e before another 
vowel, the. e must be understood to indicate an 
original j (pron. y), and an alternative form without 
e also exists. Thus sécean and sécan, seek; menigeo 
and menigo, multitude. Similarly, the i and g in the 
inflectional endings of nouns like here, army (44. 2) 
represent original j (pron. y). 
19. y and y for ie and ie.—y and ¥ properly repre- 
sent the i-umlaut of u and a, but are also frequently 
found for ie and ie. Sometimes, again, the latter 
  
-P-A-G-E-29
  EFFECTS AND RELATIONS OF SOUNDS 15 
are represented by i and i. Hence, in looking for 
words containing these letters, it is never safe to con- 
fine the search to any one of the three. From eald, 
old, is formed by means of i-umlaut the noun ieldu, 
age (17); but the latter might occur in a text or 
glossary as yldu. Contrariwise, on finding yldu in a 
text or glossary, it would not be safe to conclude that 
the y represented the i-umlaut of u, since, as we have 
just seen, it really goes back to ea and a. Again, 
were the word to be found as ildu, it should not be 
inferred that the i is either original or derived from 
e (17), for the reason just adduced. 
Remember that y or i, short or long, may stand for 
ie, short or long. 
20. The u- or o-umlaut.— This umlaut is a change 
effected in the vowels a, e, or i by a u or o of the 
following syllable. By it a is converted to ea, and 
e or i to eo (sometimes i to io). Examples: caru, 
care, becomes cearu; weruld, world, becomes weoruld ; 
milue, milk, becomes meoloe or mioloc. The change 
of vowel is, however, not invariable in these circum- 
stances, and, on the whole, may be regarded as excep- 
tional. : 
The explanation of this phenomenon is that the 
vowel sound of the following syllable is anticipated, 
as it were. The vocal organs, while pronouncing the 
a (properly 2) of caru (ezru), are already shaping
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 PHONOLOGY. 
themselves to pronounce the u; hence the result is 
czuru, very nearly, which is further modified into 
cearu. For weoruld the explanation is similar, but 
easier. 
21. Breakings.— Before r + consonant, 1 + conso- 
nant, and h + consonant or h final, a is regularly con- 
verted into ea, and e or i frequently into eo. This 
change is called breaking, because the one vowel is, 
as it were, broken into two. Examples: — 
a) a to ea: arm (arm), earm; ald (old), eald; 
ahta (eight), eahta. 
b) e ori to eo (io sometimes from i): erve (earth), 
eorde; elh (elk), eolh; fehtan (fight), feohtan; Piht 
(Pict), Pioht, Peoht. 
It must be remembered that the sound of e in ea 
differs materially from that of the same letter in eo 
(5; cf. 20). 
The explanation of breaking lies in the fact that 
the vowels which experienced breaking were formed 
with a position of the vocal organs quite different 
from that-concerned in the production of r, 1, and h, 
as pronounced in Old English. These consonants, at 
the time when they caused breaking, were gutturals; 
the vowels that underwent breaking were palatals 
(strictly speaking, when we say that a was broken, 
we should rather say that it was «). In the produc- 
tion of these consonants, the back part of the mouth
-P-A-G-E-31
  
EFFECTS AND RELATIONS OF SOUNDS. 17 
was chiefly concerned; in that of the vowels it was 
the forward part. Hence, in passing from the vowel 
position to that of the consonant, an intermediate vowel 
sound or glide was produced, akin in position and 
sound to the consonant which it preceded. Although 
these consonants have at present a pronunciation which 
cannot be called guttural, yet it is possible to pro- 
nounce a sentence like ‘What ails you?’ in so 
drawling a manner, especially as regards ‘ails,’ that 
this word shall have nearly the sound of duls. The 
obscure wéh-sound thus developed may be compared 
to the second element of the diphthong in ea and eo. 
Here may be adduced Shakespearian lines such as — 
Strikes his breast hard (hah-urd), and anon he casts. 
— Hey. VIII. 3, 2. 117. 
Look how he makes to Cesar, mark (mah-urk) him. 
—Jur. Cas, 3, 2, 18. 
My lord (law-urd), will it please you pass along. 
— Ricu. III. 3. 1. 136. 
In all these, metre seems to demand that the itali- 
cized words shall be pronounced as disyllabic (Abbott’s 
Shakespearian Grammar, § 485). 
22, Ablaut.— Ablaut (pron. ahp*lowt) is a prehistoric 
relation existing between the vowels of different tense- 
stems derived from the same verbal root. Thus the 
relation of 7, a, and wu, in the Mod. Eng. sing, sang, 
sung, is an ablaut relation, and so is the relation of
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 PHONOLOGY. 
7, 0, ¢ in the Mod. Eng. drive, drove, driven. In Old 
English the tense-stems of these verbs would be sing-, 
sang, sung-, sung- (104); drif-, draf, drif-, drif- (102). 
In the former, i, a, u, u stand in an ablaut relation; 
in the latter, 1, a, i, i. 
It must be observed that the verbal stems concerned 
sometimes appear in nouns and adjectives, as well as 
in verbs. Thus the vowel of the Mod. Eng. noun 
song stands in an ablaut relation with those of the tense- 
stems sing and sung. Again, in Old English, the i 
of the noun bite, dite, stands in an ablaut relation 
with the other vowels of the tense-stems of bitan, 
bite. The latter are bit-, bat, bit-, bit- (102), and 
hence the radical vowel of the noun is identical with 
that of the third and fourth stems. 
Ablaut is not to be confounded with umlaut. Um- 
laut admits of explanation; ablaut must, so far as Old 
English is concerned, be merely accepted as a fact. 
23. Stress, and the vowels of unstressed syllables. — 
The stressed syllable is the principal one, and usually 
the first one of the word, except in compounded verbs, 
and nouns or adjectives with the prefixes be-, ge-, and 
sometimes for-; these stress the root syllable. The 
laws relating to vowels hold only of stressed syllables. 
In unstressed syllables, especially in the second sylla- 
ble of trisyllabie words, the vowel is liable to pass into 
a neutral sound, often represented by e, or to disappear
-P-A-G-E-33
  
EFFECTS AND RELATIONS OF SOUNDS. 19 
altogether. When the vowel disappears, the trisylla- 
bic word of course becomes disyllabic: engel, angel, 
gen. engles (instead of engeles); héafod, head, gen. 
héafdes (instead of héafodes). Syncope, as such dis- 
appearance is termed, is most apt to occur after a long 
syllable (4). 
24. Representation of Old English vowels in Modern 
English.— The same Old English vowel letter is not 
always represented by the same Mod. Eng. letter, nor 
its sound by the same Mod. Eng. sound; yet there is 
a certain uniformity, differing in degree with different 
vowels, in the representation of both sound and letter. 
Some of the more regular correspondences are given 
in the subjoined table, though it must be understood 
that exceptions are numerous. The Mod. Eng. sound 
or letter that is first given is the commonest; the 
second is often comparatively rare. The figuration 
of the Mod. Eng. vowel sounds is that of Webster’s 
Dictionary. For details, see Mayhew’s Synopsis of Old 
English Phonology.

  CONSONANTAL LOSS AND CHANGE. 21 
25. Influence of nasals.— The nasals m and n change 
a preceding a to g. Usage is not uniform; some 
texts have a in this position, and others @. 
When a word cannot be found under a, look for it 
under Q, and conversely. 
26. Influence of w.—In cases where e or i has be- 
come eo or io (20, 21), a preceding w is apt to change eo 
to o or u, and io to u. For example, weruld (world) 
becomes weoruld through the influence of u-umlaut 
(20), and this may then become woruld.  Simi- 
larly, widuwe (widow) becomes wioduwe, and then 
wuduwe. For the o and u thus produced, y is some- 
times found. 
When 0, u, or y immediately follows w, it may be 
suspected, though it must not be assumed, that the vowel 
was once eo or io, originally e or i. 
Consonantal Loss and Change. 
27. Loss or vocalization of w.— Some words ending 
in a long vowel or diphthong originally ended in w, 
and the w is still found in the oblique cases of these 
words. Thus, nom. enéo (knee), gen. cnéowes, etc., 
and occasionally in the nominative, enéow (47. 3). 
At the end of a word, and following a short syllable 
which ends in a consonant, u often stands for original 
w, the latter having undergone vocalization in that 
position. When an inflectional syllable is added
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 PHONOLOGY. 
beginning with a vowel, the w reappears. Thus, 
nom. gearu (ready), gen. gearwes, etc. (57. 5). 
There is frequent loss of initial w in the negative 
forms of the verbs wesan, be, witan, know, willan, 
will: nzes, was not, nat, knows not, nolde, would not, 
etc. It also disappears in na(u)ht for nawiht, naught, 
eue for ewie, alive, and a few other words. 
28. Loss or replacement of g.— Before d and n (and 
before 3 in the word tidian, grant), g is often lost, 
the preceding vowel being lengthened by way of 
compensation: mzgden and méiéden, maiden; degn 
and dén, thane. Properly speaking, the palatal g, 
already in such cases pronounced almost like a vowel, 
becomes indistinguishable from i or y in pronunciation, 
and by this time its effect is simply to lengthen the 
vowel which precedes. In a similar manner, ig may 
be contracted into i, sometimes shortened to i: hun- 
grig and hungri, hungry; liged and 110, lies (from 
liegan) ; stigrap and stirap, stirrup. The above losses 
are regular only after palatal vowels (10). 
After a guttural vowel (10), after r, or (especially 
in LWS.) before -st and -3, endings respectively of 
the 2d and 3d sing. pres. ind., g frequently becomes 
h, occasionally gh: gendg and gendh, enough; burg 
and burh, city; stigd and stihd, climbs. 
29. Loss of h. — Certain words ending in h lose the 
h before an inflectional ending beginning with a vowel,
-P-A-G-E-37
  CONSONANTAL LOSS AND CHANGE. 23 
at the same time lengthening the vowel of the stem, 
if short: feorh, life, gen. féores; feoh, property, gen. 
féos. There are besides a number of contract verbs 
(101) in which an original h has been lost before 
vowels (100); geféon, rejoice, orig. gefehan. 
The initial h of certain indefinite pronouns, and of 
the various forms of habban, have, is frequently lost 
after ne, not: naiwder, nader (27) for ne ahweder, 
neither; nezefde, had not. 
30. Loss of m and n.— Before the spirants f, s, and 
5 there has been in some words the loss of an original 
m or n, with a lengthening of the preceding vowel: 
Osle, ousel, orig. amsala; iis, us, orig. uns. When the 
resulting vowel is 6, or its umlaut € (17), the origi- 
nal vowel was a (@ before nasal, 25): gos, goose, 
orig. gans; ést, favor, orig. ansti. 
31. Metathesis of r.—In some words in which a 
vowel was originally preceded by r, the r has changed 
places with the vowel. Thus burna, fountain, brook 
(cf. Scottish burn), was originally brun(n)a (cf. 
Germ. Brunnen); hors, horse, orig. hros (cf. Germ. 
Ross). 
32. Metathesis of se. — After a vowel, se frequently 
becomes es, often represented by hs or x (2). Thus 
ascian, ask (cf. Germ. (h)eischen) becomes Acsian, 
ahsian, axian (dial. Mod. Eng. aze).
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 PHONOLOGY. 
33. Change of d to t.— When d either precedes or fol- 
lows a surd (8) in the same word, it regularly becomes 
t. Thus from bindan, bind, the ind. pres. 2d sing. is 
formed by adding -st (though sometimes -est), thus, 
bindst; but, in accordance with this principle, bindst 
becomes bintst. So from iecan, increase, the ind. pret. 
8d sing. is formed by adding -de, thus, iecde; but iecde 
becomes iecte. 
34. Changes of 3 in conjunction with other dentals. — 
Whenever d or t comes to stand immediately before 
3, the combination becomes tt, which is sometimes 
simplified to t (35). Thus binded, ind. pres. 3d 
sing. of bindan, becomes bindd by elision of the e 
in an unstressed syllable (23); but bindd invariably 
appears as bint; bidd and bitd, respectively from 
bidan, await, and bitan, bite, both become bitt or bit. 
By a somewhat similar change, sd often becomes st. 
For 9s is usually found ss, which may be simplified 
to s (35). ‘ 
Suspect that t near the end of a verb may stand for 
d or 9, or be the result of contraction. 
35. Gemination simplified.— Double consonants are 
of frequent occurrence, especially before an inflec- 
tional syllable beginning with a vowel. Thus swim- 
man, swim, bedde, to a bed, etc. But gemination 
is frequently simplified, or, in other words, the sec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  CONSONANTAL LOSS AND CHANGE. 25 
ond consonant is dropped, (a) at the end of a word, 
(©) before another consonant, (¢) in certain other 
situations. Thus: — 
(a) mannes, gen. sing., but mann or man, man, 
nom. sing.; (6) ealles, gen. sing. of eal(1), all, but 
ealne, acc. sing. masc.; (¢) der, other, with gen. 
plur. ending dderra, but usually ddera, dora. 
36. Gemination pointing to original j.—In many 
words which contain a double consonant, especially 
those whose stem vowel is ¢, the stem was originally 
followed by j (pron.-y), and the consonant was not 
geminated, but single: sellan, give, orig. saljan. This 
was always the case with words containing eg, which, 
it will be remembered, is the representative of gg (11): 
secgan, say, orig. sagjan; hrycg, back, orig. hrugjo-. 
37. Grammatical change. — As between certain re- 
lated words, there is an interchange of 9 and d,s and 
r: inf. c8osan, choose, past part. coren; inf. ewedan, 
say, past part. eweden (cf. the noun ewide, discourse). 
This is technically known as grammatical change. 
Under similar circumstances, there is a like change 
between h and g, and h and w, but-owing to a partial 
disappearance of the h (cf. 100) this is less noticeable : 
sliehd, strikes (inf. sléan), slig, struck; siehd, sees 
(inf. séon), sawon (they) saw.
-P-A-G-E-40
    INFLECTION. 
Declension of Nouns. 
38. Gender of nouns.— Nouns are either masculine, 
feminine, or neuter. Names of males are masculine, 
and those of females feminine, except magden, mzden 
(28), girl, wif, wife, and bearn, cild, child, which are 
neuter. The gender of most nouns must be learned 
from the dictionary ; but all nouns ending in -a are 
masculine, and belong to the weak declension (53); 
all ending in -ddm, -els, -ere, -had, and -scipe, and most 
in -end, with names of persons in -ing and -ling, are 
strong masculines; those ending in -estre, -nes, -rieden, 
-3(a) (do), -ung, most in -u, and a few abstracts in 
-ing, are strong feminines. 
Compound nouns take the gender of their last com- 
ponent; thus wifman, woman, is masculine, because 
man(n) is masculine. 
39. Strong and weak nouns.— According to their 
declension, all nouns are either strong or weak. The 
nominative of weak nouns always ends in a vowel, 
either -a or -e, but not all nouns ending in -e are 
weak. 
26
-P-A-G-E-41
  DECLENSION OF NOUNS. 27 
40. Cases of nouns and adjectives. — Old English has 
six cases, though in general only four are distinguished. 
These four are the nominative, genitive, dative, and 
accusative; the two additional are the vocative, the 
case of direct address, and the instrumental, which is 
virtually indistinguishable from the dative, except in 
adjectives. 
The nominative is used as in English. The genitive 
is the case denoting possessor, source, or cause; its 
sign is of. The dative denotes the indirect object of 
an action; its sign is to or for. The accusative denotes 
the direct object; it has no sign. The instrumental 
denotes the means by which an action is performed; 
its sign is by. 
The instrumental of nouns is included in the declen- 
sions under the dative. 
41. Uniform case endings. — All nouns, whatever their 
declension, end in -um in the dative plural. The gen- 
itive plural always ends in -a, either appended directly 
to the stem, or with -en- (rarely -r-) interposed (43. 6); 
accordingly the genitive plural, to speak more strictly, 
always ends in -a or -ena (very rarely -ra). 
Instead of -um is occasionally found -un, -on, or -an, 
and in later Old English these endings grow common. 
42. Strong masculine endings. — All strong masculines, 
except umlaut masculines (46) and those in -u (45), 
take the following as regular endings (for exceptions
-P-A-G-E-42

see 43. 5-9; 44. 4), where — represents the form of 
the nominative singular : —

fish: —

N.V.A. fise fiscas 
G. fisces fisca 
D. fisce fiscum 
1. A very few words ending in -cg may insert -e- 
before the endings of the plural: secgeas, etc. (18). 
2. If the radical vowel of the nominative is x before 
a single consonant, this is changed in the plural to a: 
deg, day, but plur. dagas, daga, dagum. 
8. Nouns ending in h lose this consonant before a 
case ending, and in so doing lengthen the radical 
vowel or diphthong. Thus fearh, swine, but féares, 
etc. (29). If the h is preceded by a vowel, the vowel 
of the ending is lost: sedh, shoe, but nom. plur. scds, 
not scdas. 
4. Disyllabic nouns generally lose the vowel of the 
second syllable before all endings, when the stem is 
long by nature or position (4, 23), if the second syllable 
is not long by position. Otherwise the vowel of the,
-P-A-G-E-43
  DECLENSION OF NOUNS. 29 
second syllable is regularly preserved. Examples are 
as follows : — 
a. Stem long by nature, and second syllable short: 
&del, country, gen. &dles, not édeles. 
6. Stem long by position, and second syllable long 
by position: hengest, stallion, dat. hengeste, not 
hengste. 
ec. Stem long by position (vowel before two conso- 
nants), and second syllable short: dryhten, lord, gen. 
dryhtnes, not dryhtenes. 
d. Stem short by nature, and second syllable short: 
heofon, heaven, dat. heofone, not heofne. 
Occasional exceptions are found: dryhtenes, heofne. 
The retention or loss of the vowel is in part dependent 
upon the date of the particular text. 
5. In a few words there is an occasional gen. and 
dat. sing. and nom. plur. in -a: feld, field, ford, ford, 
winter, winter, sumer, swmmer, and a few others of 
rare occurrence. 
6. Nouns in -end, originally present participles (143), 
take the gen. plur. in -ra, instead of -a, and the plur. 
nom. voc. ace. in -e, or without ending, as well as in 
-as, the latter being rare. Thus nom. plur. h#lend, 
h#lende, as well as h#lendas; gen. h#lendra. 
7. A single word, bearu, grove, has the nom. 
sing. in -u, and takes w instead of the -u before all 
inflectional endings: nom. sing. bearu, gen. bearwes, 
etc. (27).

8. The noun feeder, father, frequently omits the ter- 
minations of the sing. gen. and dat.

the termination of the nom. ace. plur. 
44, Masculines in -e.— The declension of strong mas- 
culines in -e is almost identical with that of fise. The 
sing. nom. acc. voc. takes -e; other exceptions will be 
noted below. Ende, end, is thus declined : — 
SINGULAR. PLURAL. 
N.V.A. ende endas 
G. endes enda 
D. ende endum 
1. Here belong important classes of nouns ending 
in -ere (143) and -seipe, besides some others. They 
are much less numerous, however, than those of the 
preceding declension. 
2. The noun here, army, sometimes takes -g- or -ig- 
before the endings of the singular, and the same, or 
-ige-, before the endings of the plural: her(i)ges, etc. 
Two words sometimes have the gen. plur. in -ig(e)a, 
-ia: wine, friend, Dene, Danes, gen. plur. winigea, 
Deniga, Denia (18). 
3. Nouns ending in -ce may retain the -e before 
the endings of the plural: l&ce, physician, nom. plur. 
laceas, as well as lacas (18). 
4. A few masculine nouns in -e occasionally take 
the nom. acc. plur. in -e, instead of -as: wine, or
-P-A-G-E-45

winas, friend. The following are found in the plural 
only: léode (also léoda), people, ielde, men, ielfe, elves, 
and the proper nouns Engle, Angles, Seaxe, Saxons, 
Mierce, Mercians. 
45. Masculines in -u.— Here belong the words sunu, 
son, wudu, wood, me(o)du, mead, magu, boy, bre(o) go, 
prince, heoru, sword, lagu, lake, si(o)du, custom, spitu, 
spit. Sunu is thus declined : — 
SINGULAR. PLURAL. 
N.V.A. sunu suna 
G. suna suna 
D. suna sunum 
1. The ending of the nom. sing. -u (sometimes -o) 
is liable to intrude everywhere except in the dat. plur. 
and gen. sing. and plur. 
2. Besides sunu and wudu, the nouns above given 
are scarcely, found except in the nom. ace. sing. 
8. In later Old English these words begin to 
assume the endings of fise (43): gen. sunes, nom. 
plur. sunas, etc. 
46. Umlaut masculines. — Here belong fot, foot, too, 
tooth; man(n), man; féond, enemy, fréond, friend, 
(142); brddor, brother. These take umlaut of the 
radical vowel (17) in the dat. sing. and nom. voc. 
ace. plur., and have no ending in those cases. Fot 
is thus declined: —

8. Féond and fréond usually have dat. sing. 
féonde, fréonde, sometimes plur. féond, fréond, or 
even féondas, fréondas. 
47. Strong neuters. —In general, the chief distinction 
between the declension of masculines and that of neu- 
ters is in the plur. nom. ace. Where the masculine 
has -as, the neuter, if its radical syllable be short, has 
-u, or sometimes -o; if long, has no ending whatever 
(ef. 23, and especially its final sentence). When the 
radical syllable is short, the paradigm accordingly is 
(hof, dwelling): —

nietenu, - cattle, earfodu, labors, wzet(e)ru, waters, 
héafdu, heads, wundor, wonders. 
2. Occasionally the nom. acc. plur. takes -o or -a 
instead of -u. 
3. Tréo, tree, and enéo, knee, take -w before all 
case endings, and sometimes in the nom. sing.: 
tréowes, etc. (27). Nom. acc. plur. tréowu, enéowu. 
4. For a change in the radical vowel of the plural, 
see 43. 2: feet, vessel, but fatu, fata, fatum. 
5. For the loss of final h, see 43. 3: feoh, money, 
fee, gen. féos. 
6. For the loss (syncopation) of the vowel of the 
second syllable, see 43. 4: héafod, head, nom. plur. 
héafdu, not (usually) héafodu; tungol, star, nom. 
plur. tunglu, not tungolu; weeter, water, gen. wee- 
teres, not (regularly) weetres. Syncopation is, how- 
ever, less constant in the nom. acc. plur. of neuters, 
in cases corresponding to 43. 4. a. 
7. Neuters ending in -en and -et sometimes double 
the final consonant before a case ending: fen, even 
(ing), gen. ®fenes or #fennes, ete. These nouns 
retain the -e of the second syllable. 
48. Neuters in -e.— These are declined like word, 
except that the sing. nom. voc. acc. has -e, and the

1. If the -e of the nom. sing. is preceded by ¢ or g, 
the endings of the plural may be preceded by i (or e): 
ricu or riciu, rica or ricia, etc. (18). 
49. Neuters in -u.— These are declined like bearu 
(43. 7), except that they take -u in the plur. nom. 
acc., instead of -as. There are only half a dozen 
in all, and these are not of common occurrence: 
bealu, evil, gen. bealwes, etc. 
50. Irregular neuters. — The three words lamb, lamb, 
cealf, calf, &g, egg, and sometimes cild, child, are de- 
clined regularly in the singular, but take r in the plural 
before the endings -u, -a, -um: lamb, gen. lambes, but 
nom. plur. lambru. 
In LWS. the regular forms, without r, occur. 
51. Strong feminines. — Feminine disyllables ending 
in -u, and having a short radical syllable, belong 
here; monosyllables with a long radical syllable, 
and most disyllables, discard the -u of the nom. 
sing. Abstracts, though long, follow a.

Occasionally the ending -u or -o is found in the 
oblique cases of the singular and in the nom. acc. 
plural. Duru, door, has -a in the gen. dat. sing., and 
in the whole plural except the dative. Two or three 
nouns in -u take -w before the ending in the oblique 
cases: beadu, battle, gen. beadwe, etc.

dd, deed, tid, time, woruld (20, 26), world. 
2. Only rarely does the gen. plur. of long stems take 
-(e)na. 
8. Disyllables in -ung often have -a instead of e in 
the dat. sing., and sometimes in the gen. ace. sing.: 
leornung, learning, dat. leornunga. The words hand, 
hand, flor, floor, and woruld, world, occasionally make 
the same change. 
4. Disyllables syncopate the vowel of the second

5. Polysyllables in -nes, -en, -el, and -et double the 
final consonant when a syllable is added, and retain the 
preceding -e: gen. dat. acc. sing. éadmodnesse, humility, 
byrdenne, burden, etc. 
52. Umlaut feminines.— These modify the root vowel 
by umlaut in the dat. sing. and nom. voe. ace. plur., 
and often in the gen. sing., that is, change & to &, 
o to ¢,6 to é,u to y,and ato ¥. The gen. sing., and 
occasionally the dat. sing., is sometimes formed regu- 
larly, without umlaut, and with the ending -e. Para-

fringe; burg, castle, city, furh, furrow, sulh, plough, 
turf, turf; ct, cow, grit, grout, grits, lis, louse, mis, 
mouse, Driih, trough; €a, river; niht, night. 
1. The dat. (gen.) sing. of burg is usually byrig, 
not byrg. 
2. Mddor, mother, and dohtor, daughter, are declined 
like brévor (46. 1), except that médor has only the nom. 
ace. plur. médru, -a, and both may have an umlaut gen. 
sing. in LWS. (but usually médor, dohtor).

3. Sweostor, sister, is without umlaut in any case; 
it remains sweostor in every case except the gen. plur. 
sweostra and dat. plur. sweostrum. 
53. Weak nouns. — Masculines end in -a, feminines 
and neuters in -e; but the neuters may be conveniently 
disregarded, only Gage, eye, and @are, ear, belonging 
to this declension. Paradigms (moéna, moon, tunge,

1. The number of feminines thus declined is com- 
paratively small. The commonest are perhaps eorde, 
earth, heorte, heart, lufe, love, cirice, church, tunge, 
tongue, hearpe, harp, sunne, sun, nadre, viper, and 
zelmesse, alms. The masculines are, on the contrary, 
very numerous. 
2. The declension of the neuters Gage and éare 
differs from that of the feminines only in the acc. 
sing., which is like the nom. Their gen. plur. is 
often éagna, éarna. 
8. The weak feminine heofone, heaven, should be dis- 
tinguished from the strong masculine heofon. Besides 
the weak lufe, there is also a strong Iufu, love (51. a).

  38 INFLECTION. 
54. Proper names. — Native names are declined like 
common nouns, except that feminines ending in -burg 
take the dative in -e and are without umlaut. Foreign 
names are sometimes naturalized, and sometimes take 
their original case endings, but not always with entire 
consistency. The words Cent, Cert, I, Tenet, and 
Wiht are indeclinable, except that Wiht has the gen. 
Wihte. 
Declension of Adjectives. 
55. Weak and strong adjectives. — Adjectives are de- 
clined weak when in the comparative, and usually when 
in the superlative; when ordinals (except oder, second, 
78, 80); when preceded by a demonstrative; when used 
as masculine or feminine nouns preceded by the definite 
article ; in direct address ; sometimes when preceded 
by a possessive pronoun ; and: exceptionally in poetry 
in place of the strong adjective. Otherwise adjectives 
are always used in the strong form. 
56. Strong declension of adjectives. — Here it is neces- 
sary to distinguish between long monosyllables on the 
one hand, and short monosyllables (comparatively few) 
and disyllables on the other.

1. Italicized words indicate differences from the noun 
‘declension; cf. these with the pronominal declensions 
(81, 84, 85). 
2. When the radical vowel is x, it is changed as in 
the paradigm. Otherwise it remains unchanged. 
8. Disyllables take the same endings as in the para- 
digm, but frequently syncopate the vowel of the second 
syllable before an ending beginning with a vowel, as in 
€adig, blessed, gen. éadges (23; cf. 43. 4), and some- 
times conform the nom. sing. fem. to the masc. and 
neut., and the neut. plur. nom. voce. acc. to the sing.: 
halig, holy, not hal(i)gu. 
4, For the ending -u sometimes occurs -o, and for 
-um the LWS. -on, -an (cf. 41). 
5. Adjectives ending in -u (-o) change the u to w 
before vowels (27): gearu, ready, gen. gearwes, etc. 
58. Long monosyllables.— The only difference be- 
tween the declension of the long and that of the short 
monosyllables is that the ending -u of the latter is 
dropped, and that the radical vowel always remains 
unchanged. Paradigm, god, good : —

1. Adjectives ending in h drop the h in disyllabic 
forms, and lengthen the radical vowel or diphthong 
(29): Dweorh, transverse, gen. Swéores ; but héah, 
high, often assimilates the final h to a following con- 
sonant: héanne, héarra, etc. In LWS. the h is often 
changed to g before a vowel: héagum, etc. 
"2. Words ending in a double consonant usually re- 
tain this only before a vowel (35). 
59. Adjectives in -e.— These are quite numerous. 
They are declined like the short monosyllables, except 
that they always retain their -e when no other ending is 
provided, but lose it before an ending. Paradigm, gréne,

From an acc. masc. sing., like grénne, blidne, for ex- 
ample, it is therefore not safe to infer a dictionary form

In consulting the lexicon, care should be taken to distin- 
guish adjectives in -e from such as endin a consonant.

1. In LWS. -um frequently becomes -an. 
2. When, in consequence of contraction, too many 
r’s or n’s are brought together, one of them is rejected. 
Thus gearu, ready, forms a comparative gearura. This 
comparative, in turn, would form a gen. plur. gearu- 
rara. By contraction this would reduce to gear(u)- 
r(a)ra; but the three r’s are simplified to two, and the 
resulting gen. plur. stands as gearra. 
61. The present participle. — The present participle in 
-ende is not to be confounded with the noun in -end 
(for which see 43.6). It is declined like gréne (59). 
When used in the predicate as nom. or ace. it is gener- 
ally uninflected. The present participle, like the adjec- 
tive, is also declined weak. 
62. The past participle. — The past participle has the 
double declension of the adjective, both strong and 
weak. When used in the predicate it is generally 
indeclinable, or ends like the strong masculine.

Comparison of Adjectives. 
63. Regular comparison. — The comparative is formed 
by adding -ra to the stem of the positive, and the super- 
lative by adding -osta (-esta); with the latter cf. Greek 
-wctos. The final -a represents the masculine termina- 
tion of the weak adjective (60), and undergoes all the 
replacements of the weak declension. More rarely the 
superlative is found in -ost (est), which is then re- 
garded as strong. A final -e of the positive is dropped 
in comparison (e.g. Gade, easy, comp. iedra, not Iedera) 
and a radical 2 becomes a in the superlative (e.g. smeel, 
small, superl. smalost, not smeelost ; cf. 43. 2). 
64. Comparison without umlaut.— This is the usual 
mode : —

Formation and Comparison of Adverbs. 
70. Adverbs formed from adjectives. — Adverbs are 
formed from adjectives by the addition of -e, -lice, and 
-unga or-inga. Examples are: wid, wide, wide, widely ; 
swid, strong, swide, very ; 80d, true, sddlice, truly ; 
eall, all, eallunga, eallinga, entirely. Occasionally 
-unga, -inga is employed to form adverbs from other 
parts of speech. 
71. Adjectives in the genitive as adverbs. — The ending 
-es of the gen. sing. neut. is employed to form a few 
adverbs from adjectives: ealles, altogether: Owéores 
(58. 1), perversely, ete.
-P-A-G-E-59
  FORMATION AND COMPARISON OF ADVERBS. 45 
72. Adjectives in the dative plural as adverbs. — Exam- 
ples are: miclum, very; lytlum, little. 
73. Adjectives in the accusative as adverbs: — Exam- 
ples are: fyll, fully; gendg, enough. 
74. Adverbs from nouns. — From the genitive: dages, 
by day; niedes, needs; etc. From the instrumental: 
sare; sore, etc. From the dative plural: dropm#lum, 
drop by drop, ete. (cf. piecemeal). 
75. Adverbs of place. — These are of three classes, ac- 
cording as they answer the question, Where? Whither? 
or Whence? Examples are: — 
WHERE? WHITHER ? WHENCE? 
Sar Sider Sqnan 
hwer hwider hwognan 
her hider heonan 
76. Comparison of adverbs. — Adverbs from adjectival 
stems are regularly compared by adding -or for the 
comparative and -ost for the superlative. Example: 
strangor, more strongly, strangost, most strongly (cf. 
65). 
77. Irregular comparison of adverbs. — A few adverbs 
have no termination in the comparative. They are 
always monosyllabic, and have usually undergone um- 
laut. Such are bet, better; m&, mz, more; néar, 
nearer ; etc.

halb); so dridde healf, two and a half; in other words, 
the OE. ordinal indicates the cardinal from which 4 
must be subtracted. 
5. Interesting forms, which actually occur, are: 19, 
an 1%s twéntig; 39, an ls féowertig; 59, ines wana 
siextig (cf. Greek évds déovtes e’xoor) ; 450, fiftig and 
féower hund, fifte healf hund; 482, féower hund 
and twa and hundeahtatig; 100,000, an hund da- 
senda; 1,500,000, fiftiene hund diisend. Note also 
fiftiena sum, one of fifteen, ie. with fourteen com- 
panions. 
79. Declension of cardinals. — An is declined like 
god (58), but with acc. sometimes senne, inst. ne. 
When declined weak, ana, it signifies alone. Twégen 
is declined thus : —

clined : —

N.A. Srie Sréo Sréo 
G. Sréora 
D, Srim 
The cardinals between 3 and 20 are usually inde- 
clinable. Those ending in -tig are sometimes treated 
as neuter nouns (in which case they are followed by 
a partitive genitive), sometimes as adjectives, and 
are sometimes uninflected. Hund and diisend are 
sometimes undeclined, but there is also a plural of 
hund, nom. hunde, dat. hundum; and of disend, 
nom. diisendu, gen. -da, -dra, dat. -dum. These nu- 
merals are always followed by the genitive. 
80. Declension of ordinals. — All are declined like 
weak adjectives (60), except der, second, which is 
strong.

82. Reflexive pronouns. —In place of the reflexive, 
which does not exist as an independent form, is used 
the personal pronoun (81). 
83. Possessive pronouns.— Two sorts of possessives 
must be distinguished, the declinable and the inde- 
clinable. All of these are identical in form with the 
genitive of the personal pronoun, except sin, which 
is formed from a lost reflexive. The declinable pos-

sessives are min, my, Din, thy, ire, our, Bower, your, 
sin, fis, and the seldom used uncer, of us two, and 
incer, of you two. These follow the strong declen- 
sion of adjectives (57, 58). The indeclinables are his, 
his, hi(e)re, her, and hi(e)ra, their, the genitives of 
the third personal pronoun. 
84. The demonstrative ‘that.’ — The pronoun se, séo, 
det, is at once the equivalent of Mod. Eng. that 
and of the article. Like that, it is employed in a 
relative as well as a demonstrative sense, and fre- 
quently does duty for the third personal pronoun. 
The demonstrative pronouns have an instrumental 
case, as does the neuter of the interrogative hweet.

86. Minor demonstratives. — Less important demon- 
stratives are ilea, same, which is declined weak, and 
self, self, which takes both declensions. 
87. Relative. pronouns. — The office of the relative 
is assumed : 
a) by the demonstrative se, séo, dat, the reference 
being rendered explicit by the case form. 
6) by the demonstrative se, séo, det, with the parti- 
cle Se appended. 
ce) by the indeclinable Se, the reference being ren- 
dered explicit by an appended personal pronoun in 
the proper case form.  
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 INFLECTION. 
d) by the particle Se alone, representing all num- 
bers, genders, and cases, the reference being much 
less explicit. 
Illustrations of each of these modes would be: —

b) Se stan, Sone Se Sa wyrhtan awurpon. 
c) Se stan, Se hine 3a wyrhtan awurpon. 
d) Se stan, Se da wyrhtan awurpon. 
88. Interrogative pronouns. — The most important is 
hwa, who? of both genders, with its neuter hweet, 
what? what sort of a? 
Maso. Frm. NEUTER. 
N. hwa hwet 
G. hwes 
D. hwm (hwam)

Hwile, which? hweeder, which of two? and hiilic, of 
what sort? are declined like strong adjectives (57, 58). 
89. Indefinite pronouns. — The indefinites are: — 
a) an, sum, a, a certain, ®nig, any, nan, néenig, 
no, none, Ble, gehwile, cach, Seder, Ahweevder, either, 
nahweder, neither, Ser, other, swile, such, are de- 
clined like strong adjectives. 
6) Awiht, sht, anything, and nawiht, ndht, nothing,

thing, etc.) are indeclinable.

e) man (originally mann), one (cf. French on, 
Ger. man), is used only in the nom. sing. 
Verbs. 
90. Classification of verbs.— Verbs are either strong 
(92) or weak (96); besides which there are two small 
classes of important verbs, called respectively preteri- 
tive presents (124 ff.) and anomalous (1387 ff.). Weak 
verbs are in general derivative; and the stem can 
usually be detected as existing in some other inde- 
pendent word, often a noun or adjective, or the pret. 
oe tense-stem of a strong verb. 
91. The present stem.— The present stem of a verb 
is what remains after cutting off the infinitive ending 
-an or -ian (in contract verbs, -n). The radical vowel 
is the vowel of this stem; and the consonant or con- 
sonants which terminate the stem are, when such 
exist, called stem-finals. The stem as obtained above 
is one of the four tense-stems of strong verbs, or of 
the three tense-stems of weak verbs. 
92. Tense-stems of strong verbs.—Strong verbs change 
the radical vowel to form the different tense-stems, like
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 INFLECTION. 
the verbs called irregular in Modern English. As in 
Modern English the verb drive has the preterit drove 
and past participle driven, so in Old English the same 
verb has the pret. sing. draf and past participle drifen. 
However, instead of the three tense-stems of Modern 
English, there are four in Old English for strong 
verbs, the preterit being subdivided into preterit sin- 
gular and preterit plural. 
The four stems of drifan, drive, are: — 
PRESENT. Pret. SINne. PRET. PLUR. Past Part. 
drif- draft drif- drif- 
93. Forms derived from each stem.— From the present 
stem are formed the whole of the present indicative and 
optative, the imperative singular and plural, the infini- 
tive, the gerund, and the present participle —in all 
seventeen forms. 
From the pret. sing. stem are formed only the. 1st 
and 3d persons singular — two forms. 
From the pret. plur. stem are formed the whole pret. 
plur. of indicative and optative, the whole pret. sing. 
of the optative, and the 2d person singular indicative 
—ten forms. 
From the past participial stem is formed only the 
past participle — one form. 
94. Commonest forms of the verb. — From the present 
stem the form in commonest use is the ind. pres. 3d 
sing.; from the pret. sing. stem, the ind. pret. 8d sing.;
-P-A-G-E-69
  
, VERBS. 55 
from the pret. plur. stem, the ind. pret. 3d plur. 
Umlaut (17) and contraction (34) are apt to obscure 
the origin of the first of these, but not of the other 
two. Thus from standan, stand — whose principal 
parts are standan, stéd, stddon, standen —-the ind. 
pret. 3d sing. is stéd, the ind. pret. 3d plur. stdédon, 
but the ind. pres. 3d sing. stent (instead of standed). 
95. Conjugation of a strong verb.— Types are: bindan, 
bind; (for contracts) fon, seize: — 
Inprcative. Oprative. 
Pres. Sing. 1. binde; fo binde; fo 
2. bind(e)st, bintst; féhst binde; fo 
3. bind(e)%, bint; fehs binde; fo 
Plur. bindad, binde; fod binden; fon 
Pret. Sing. 1. band; feng bunde; fénge 
2. bunde; fenge bunde; fénge 
3. band; féng bunde; fénge 
Plur. bundon; féngon bunden; féngen 
Imper. Sing. bind; foh Infin. bindan; fon 
Plur. bindad, binde; fo8 Gerund to bindanne; to fonne 
Pres. Part. bindende; fonde Past Part. (ge)bunden; (ge)fangen 
The 2d sing. pres. ind. is sometimes formed in -sd. 
The 9 is derived from the di of the personal pronoun, 
the old ending having been s. This s, followed by the 
personal pronoun, became sd, which should regularly 
become st (34), but does not always. 
Nore. — The ind. and imper. (sometimes opt.) plur. binde is used 
when the verb is immediately followed by a pronoun as subject: binde 
we, not bindad we, we bind, let us bind; binde gé, not bindad ge, 
bind ye; similarly, dd wé, nolde gé.
-P-A-G-E-70
  56 INFLECTION. 
96. Conjugation of the weak verb. — Weak verbs form 
the preterit by the addition to the present stem of -de 
for the singular (ind. pret. 2d sing. -dest), and -don 
(-den) for the plural. A few verbs take -e before 
the -de, and many take -o. The vowel of the present 
stem is never changed before -ede and -ode, but in 
some verbs is changed before -de; a list of the latter 
is given in 114. 
The past participle of weak verbs is formed by the 
addition of -ed (-od, -d). 
The -d of the endings -de, etc., and -ed, is changed 
to -t after certain stem-finals (33), and is lost in other 
situations; for details see 113 and 114. Certain stem- 
finals also undergo change before the same endings; 
for details see 114. 
97. Classes of strong verbs. — Under strong verbs are 
_ included two principal divisions, according as their 
tense-stems were originally formed in one manner or 
another. Strong verbs are accordingly divided into 
Ablaut Verbs and Reduplicating Verbs. This dis- 
tinction is mainly historical, and for practical pur- 
poses need not be insisted on at the outset. 
98. Ablaut verbs. — Of these there are six principal 
classes, for which see 102-107. 
99. Vowels of the present stem.— To facilitate the 
assignment of verbs to their proper classes, the follow-
-P-A-G-E-71
  VERBS. 57 
ing table may be useful, in conjunction with 101-110. 
The Ablaut Classes are distinguished by the Roman 
numerals, and the Reduplicating Verbs by Red.

100. Contract verbs. — Contract verbs are strong verbs 
whose stem-final was originally h. This h was lost 
before vowels (29), and the preceding vowel was then
-P-A-G-E-72
  58 INFLECTION. 
amalgamated with the following. The resultant diph- 
thong (or vowel) is €o in the case of ten verbs, éa in 
that of four, and 6 in that of two. The d-verbs belong 
to the Reduplicating Class, the @a-verbs to the Sixth 
Ablaut Class, and the é0-verbs to the First, Second, 
and Fifth Ablaut Classes. 
101. Contract verbs according to classes. — Distributed 
according to classes, the contract verbs are as follows:— 
I. léon (orig. lihan), lend; séon, sift; téon, censure; Séon, 
thrive ; wréon, cover. 
Il. fléon (orig. fléohan), flee; téon, draw. 
V. geféon (orig. gefehan), rejoice; pléon, venture; séon, see. 
VI. fléan (orig. flahan), flay; léan, blame; sléan, strike ; 
Swan, wash. 
Red. fon (orig. fanhan > fdhan), seize; hon, hang. 
Of these the most important are téon, censure, Téon, 
thrive, wréon, cover; fléon, flee, téon, draw; geféon, 
rejoice, seon, see; sléan, strike, Dwéan, wash; fon, 
seize, and hon, hang. 
Téon, draw (II), should be carefully distinguished 
from téon, censure (1); and likewise séon, see (V), 
from séon, sift (1). The principal parts of téon, 
draw, are: — 
téon téah tugon (ge)togen 
of téon, censure, are: — 
téon tah tigon (ge)tigen
-P-A-G-E-73
Ee ee eee ee ne 
VERBS. 59 
But there is a tendency on the part of contract verbs 
like the latter of these (1) to assume throughout the 
forms of the former (II). 
péon, thrive (102), has past part. Jigen and Jungen. 
The imp. sing. always ends in h, and has a long 
vowel in verbs of the First, Second, and Redupli- 
cating Classes, a short vowel in the Fifth and Sixth. 
Examples: (1) téon, censwre, imp. tih; (II) téon, 
draw, imp. téoh; (V) séon, see, imp. seoh; (VI) sléan, 
strike, imp. sleah; (Red.) fon, seize, imp. foh. 
102. Strong verbs of the First Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels (normally) i, a, i, i 
Typical verb drifan, drive 
Four stems drifan draf drifon drifen 
Like drifan are conjugated all strong verbs with i in 
the present stem. Here belongs any strong verb with a 
in the first preterit stem, iin the second preterit stem, or 
iin the past participial stem. Among the more common 
are: bidan, remain; bitan, bite; ridan, ride; (&)risan, 
arise; scinan, shine; slitan, tear; stigan, ascend; swi- 
ean, abandon; (ge)witan, go; writan, write. 
Umlaut does not affect the vowel of the present 
stem (94). 
The 2d and 38d sing. pres. ind. are thus formed 
(33, 34): — 
d-stems bidan bitst, bit(t) 
t-stems bitan bitst, bit(t) 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
60 INFLECTION. 
s-stems risan rist, rist (risd) 
S-stems — snidvan snist, snid (3) 
Contracts (101) wréon wrihst, wrihd 
Others are normal drifan drifst, drifd 
The second preterit and past participial stems of the 
verbs snidan, cut, lidan, go, and seridan, proceed, take 
d instead of 3 (37): snidon, sniden, etc. Other verbs 
in 9 retain the 9. 
103. Strong verbs of the Second Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels €o or i, Ga, u, 0 
Typical verbs béodan, offer; briican, enjoy 
Four stems béodan béad budon boden 
briican bréac brucon brocen 
Like béodan are conjugated all strong verbs having 
éo in the present stem, except some contracts, and 
like briican all having a. Here belongs any strong 
verb having €a in the first preterit stem. Among 
the more common are: céosan, choose; dréogan, 
endure; hréosan, fall; (for)léosan, lose; téon, draw; 
bugan, bow. 
Stems in s, 3, and contract vowel (37):— 
céosan céas curon coren 
stodan stad sudon soden 
téon (101) téah tugon togen 
Like céosan are formed stems in s; like séodan, 
abréodvan, frustrate; like téon, fléon, flee. 
Umlaut changes the Go of the present to Ie (or i),
-P-A-G-E-75
  
VERBS. 61 
and a of the present to y, in the 2d and 8d sing. 
pres. ind.: forliest, brycd. 
The 2d and 3d sing. pres. ind. are thus formed 
(33, 34): — 
d-stems béodan bietst, biet(t) 
t-stems géotan gietst, giet(t) 
s-stems forléosan forliest, forliest (-sd) 
g-stems (28) dréogan driegst (-hst), driegd (-hd') 
Contracts (101) téon tiehst, tiehd 
Others are normal créopan eriepst, criepd 
104. Strong verbs of the Third Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels various, but all short 
Typical verbs bindan, bind; helpan, help; gieldan, yield; weorpan, 
throw ; berstan, burst 
Four stems bindan band bundon bunden 
helpan healp hulpon holpen 
gieldan geald guldon golden 
weorpan wearp wurpon worpen 
berstan berst burston borsten 
Like bindan are conjugated all strong verbs in in 
or im + consonant, besides iernan, run, beornan, 
burn, originally rinnan, brinnan. 
Like helpan are conjugated all in el + consonant, 
besides féolan, reach, which is irregular. 
Like gieldan are conjugated all in iel + consonant. 
Like ‘weorpan are conjugated all in eor or eoh + 
consonant (21. 6). 
Like berstan are conjugated derscan, thresh; bregd- 
an, brandish; stregdan, strew; besides frignan, in-

quire, which resembles it in all except the vowel of 
the present. 
The stems of weordan, become, are (37):— 
weordan weard wurdon worden 
Bregdan and frignan may drop g, and lengthen 
the preceding vowel (28): brad, frinan. 
Findan, find, likewise forms its 3d sing. pret. ind. 
as funde, which is indeed the usual form. 
Among the more common verbs are: drincan, 
drink; findan, find; (on)ginnan, begin; winnan, 
strive; limpan, happen; belgan, be angry; hweorfan, 
turn; feohtan, fight. 
Umlaut changes the eo of the present to ie in the 
2d and 3d sing. pres. ind.: wierpd. A similar change, 
though not due to precisely the same cause (17), is 
found in presents in e, which is converted to i or ie: 
hilpst, bierst. 
The 2d and 3d sing. pres. ind. are thus formed 
(33, 34): — 
d-stems bindan bintst, bint 
t-stems feohtan fiehtst, fieht 
st-stems berstan bierst, bierst 
S-stems weordan wier(S)st, wierd 
mn-stems winnan winst, wind (35, b)

Exceptional forms are the 8d sing. pres. ind. of 
bregdan and stregdan: britt, strét(t). 
105. Strong verbs of the Fourth Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels e we & ° 
i(u) 3d 6 
Typical verb beran, bear 
Four stems beran, ber, b#ron, boren u 
Like beran are conjugated teran, tear; scieran (18), 
shear; ecwelan, die; helan, conceal; stelan, steal ; 
hwelan, roar; brecan, break. 
The two irregular verbs of this class are among 
the most important in the language: niman, take, 
and cuman, come. Their stems are :— 
niman nom nomon numen 
cuman ce(w)om ¢(w)omon cumen (cymen) 
Umlaut changes the u of cuman to y in the 2d 
and 38d sing. pres. ind.: cymst, cymd. A similar 
change, though not due to precisely the same cause 
(17), is found in the presents in e, which is changed 
to i or ie: bi(e)rst, stild. 
106. Strong verbs of the Fifth Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels (normally) e, 2, ®, e 
Typical verbs sprecan, speak ; ewe¥an, say ; giefan, give ; biddan, 
request ; gef€on, rejoice 
Four stems sprecan spreec sprzcon sprecen

Four stems biddan bed bé#don beden 
geféon (101) gefeah gef#gon 
Like sprecan are conjugated etan, eat; tredan, 
tread ; metan, measure; wrecan, pursue; and a few 
others. 
Like cwedan is conjugated no other verb. 
Like giefan is conjugated gietan, get (18). 
Like biddan are conjugated licgan, lie; sittan, sit. 
Like geféon is conjugated séon, see, except that its 
pret. plur. is sAwon, and past participle sewen, segen. 
Umlaut, or a change analogous to it (17), converts 
the e of the present to i in the 2d and 8d sing. pres. 
ind.: ewid; in contracts we have ie, not ie, since the 
vowel of the present was originally short: siehd. 
The 2d and 38d sing. pres. ind. are thus formed 
(33, 34):— 
d-stems tredan tritst, trit(t) 
t-stems gietan gietst, giet(t) 
8-stems cwedan ewist, cwid 
g-stems (28) licgan ligst (list), lig’ (118) 
Contracts (101) ston siehst, sichd 
Others are normal sprecan spricst, spricd 
The vowel of the pret. sing. is sometimes long in 
verbs in et: at, mt. Imp. sing. bide (cf. 107). 
107. Strong verbs of the Sixth Ablaut Class. — 
Stem vowels (normally) a, 6, 6, a

Umlaut changes the a of the present to ¢ (), and 
the éa of the present (see 101) to ie (not ie), in the 
2d and 3d sing. pres. ind.: stent, ferst, sliehd. 
The 2d and 8d sing. pres. ind. are thus formed

Others are normal faran feerst, feerd 
The verbs like hebban are peculiar in having 
umlaut in the present stem, which causes them, in 
so far, to resemble the Weak Verbs of the First 
lass (111). Like sellan, etc., they have the imp. sing. 
in -e: hefe, swere, etc. (cf. 117). The umlaut is due 
o the fact that the stem of this group, unlike that of
-P-A-G-E-80
66 INFLECTION. 
most strong verbs, was followed by a j (16). Thus 
the inf. steeppan stands for original stapjan; were it 
not for the umlaut-causing -j-, the infinitive would 
have been stapan; and so in the other four verbs. 
108. Reduplicating verbs. — Stem vowels various. 
A peculiarity of this class —shared, however, by a 
very few verbs of the Sixth Ablaut Class (107) — is 
that the vowels of the first and fourth stems are 
identical (with two or three exceptions noted below), 
and that those of the second and third stems are 
likewise identical. The vowel (diphthong) of the 
preterit is sometimes éo, less frequently é. 
109. Reduplicating preterits in éo0.— The present 
stem has ea (rarely a), &, Ga, 6, or 6. 
Typical verbs feallan, fall; bannan, summon; cnawan, know; 
héawan, hew; flowan, flow; wépan, weep 
Four stems _ feallan feoll feollon feallen 
bannan béonn béonnon bannen 
cnawan cneéow cnéowon cnawen 
héawan héeow heowon héawen 
flowan fleow fléowon flowen 
wepan weop wéeopon wopen 
Like feallan are conjugated verbs in eal + conso 
nant, besides weaxan, grow (originally of the Sixt 
Ablaut Class, 107): healdan, hold; wealdan, gov 
ern, etc. 
Like bannan (very rare) is conjugated gangan, g 
(but usually as gan, 141).

Like enawan are conjugated verbs in Aw, besides 
swapan, sweep : — blawan, blow ; sawan, sow, etc. 
Like héawan are conjugated verbs in 6a: béatan, 
beat ; hléapan, leap. 
Like fldwan are conjugated verbs in 3: bléwan, 
bloom (not to be confounded with blawan, blow) ; 
growan, grow; spowan, thrive; rowan, row. 
Like wépan is conjugated no other common verb; 
in wépan (orig. wopjan) the stem vowel of the present 
is derived by umlaut from 6, the latter reappearing in 
the past participle. — Umlaut as in 94. 
110. Reduplicating preterits in €.— The present stem 
has a, %, or 6.» Umlaut as in 94. 
Typical verbs 1#tan, let ; hatan, call ; fon, seize 
Four stems lx#tan let léton 1#ten 
hatan het heton haten

Like hatan is conjugated lacan, jump; scadan, 
scéadan (18), separate. 
Like fon is conjugated hon, hang (8d sing. féhd, 
héhd). 
111. Weak verbs of the First Class. —'The stem vowel 
of the present always has umlaut (except that 0 some- 
times persists, i.c., does not become ie). The infinitive 
ends in -an or -ian, the latter being infrequent.

112. Weak infinitives in -an.— These take the pret- 
erit either (113, 114) in -de (-te) or (115) in -ede, the 
past participle in -ed or in -d (t). 
113. Weak preterits in -de (-te), with retention of the 
stem vowel. — Here belong verbs whose stem vowel is 
long ky nature (4), and a number in which the stem 
syllable is long by position as a result. of gemination 
(36). The past participle is formed in -ed, contraction 
  taking place in t- and d- stems. The infinitive always 
ends in -an. Simplified gemination by 35.

Like hieran are conjugated all verbs not belonging 
to any of the following divisions. 
Like fyllan are conjugated stems ending in a double 
consonant, excepting those like cyssan and settan, and 
under 114 and 115. 
Like cyssan are conjugated stems ending in ff, pp,

114. Irregular preterits and past participles. — Certain 
verbs, in other respects like those of the last para- 
graph, and whose stems end in I], ce, ¢ (me, re), or 
g (eg, ng), form their preterits and past participles 
from a stem without umlaut. In the case of the IL, 
ee-, and simple ¢-verbs, to determine, from the pres- 
ent stem, what form the past stem will assume, 
find the original vowel corresponding to the umlaut 
vowel of the present, and consider what changes, if 
any, will be caused by breaking (21). The l-verbs 
take -de and -d, the c- and g-verbs -te and -t. The 
e- and g-verbs often insert -e- before the infinitive 
ending (18). Stems ending in e and g change these 
consonants to h before the t of the ending.

The preterit and past participle of ra&e(e)an and 
t#c(e)an should properly have 4: rahte, etc. This 
does, indeed, sometimes occur, but is much less com- 
mon than the #. 
115. Infinitives in -an, with preterit in -ede.— Here 
belong two groups of verbs whose infinitives end in 
-an (exceptionally -ian). 
(a) The first group comprises the following verbs 
with stems ending in a double consonant (cf. 11);
-P-A-G-E-85
  VERBS. vel 
fremman, perform; gremman, provoke; trymman, 
confirm ; Sennan, exteiid; wennan, accustom; dynnan, 
hlynnan, resound; cnyssan, beat; sceddan, injure 
(sometimes strong); swebban, quiet; weeg(e)an, 
agitate; Yieg(e)an, receive (sometimes strong). Occa- 
sionally these verbs take an infinitive in -ian (116). 
(6) The second group comprises stems ending in 
a consonant + either 1, n, or r. This group is some- 
what irregular, occasionally haying preterits like 
hyngerde, instead of the more regular hyngrede, 
nemde for nemn(e)de, named, and efnde for efnede, 
performed. 
Typical verbs (a) fremman, perform fremede (ge)fremed 
(b) hyngran, hunger hyngrede (ge)hyngred 
Nore. — Leeg(e)an, lay, is irregular in the preterit and past part.: 
legde (léde), (ge)legd (-léd), instead of legede, (ge)leged. 
116. Infinitives in -ian with preterit in -ede. — Here 
belong a few weak verbs of the First Class. They 
have a short stem ending in r, or occasionally in 1, 
m, n, or one of the spirants. The vowel of the stem 
is usually ¢ (ie) or y. Examples are: nerian, save ; 
herian, praise; byrian, pertain; helian, conceal ; 
trymian, confirm (see 115. a). 
Three stems nerian nerede (ge)nered 
117. Paradigms of the First Class.— For the conju- 
gation of weak verbs of the First Class we may

118. Weak verbs of the Second Class. — These are 
very numerous. Many are formed from nouns and 
adjectives (cf. 90). The infinitive always ends in 
-ian, or its equivalent -ig(e)an (18). Though the 
i of an ending usually causes umlaut, it does not in 
these verbs, because of its comparatively late origin, 
the older termination having been -djon (that is, 
' -6-yon), which was incapable of causing umlaut, since 
it was -6-, rather than -j- (that is, -y-), which imme- 
diately followed the stem. 
Hence it is easy to distinguish verbs of this Class 
from verbs in -ian of the First Class (116):— 
1. Of those verbs there are but few; of these, many. 
2. Of those the vowels are always umlauted (usually 
@ or y); of these, rarely, and only when the verb was 
formed from a noun or adjective whose vowel was 
already umlauted. 
8. Of those the stem usually ends in r; of these, 
in any consonant or consonant combination. 
119. Paradigm of the Second Class. — As a typical 
verb we may select lufian, love.

143. Suffixes of masculine nouns. — The more important 
are -end, -ere, -ing, -ling, besides the originally inde- 
pendent words -ddm, -had, and -scipe. The first four

-ing (1) = ‘son of’: Adelwulfing, son of Athelwulf, 
Adaming, son of Adam. 
(2) more generally: Centing, inhabitant of Kent, 
eyning, king, pening, penny. The i sometimes 
causes umlaut, sometimes not.

-3, -du, -o = ‘-th’: hd, health, strengdu, : strength. 
This ending was originally -i0a, the -i of which

from the present stem of (usually weak) verbs: 
blétsung, dlessing, costung, temptation. 
réden = ‘-red,’ ‘-ship,’ ‘-ity’: hierdr#den, guardian- 
ship, guard. 
145. Suffixes of neuter nouns.— The two principal, -lac

  FORMATION OF WORDS. 87 
147. Composition. — Compounds are numerous in Old 
English. In this respect it resembles German and 
Greek, while Modern English has allowed this power 
of forming compounds to fall into disuse, largely 
through the influence of Latin and French. For this 
reason it would often be easier to make an idiomatic 
translation into Old English from Greek than from 
Latin; in its plastic and pictorial quality a page of 
Old English poetry suggests Homer or Pindar rather 
than Virgil or Horace, and among Roman poets the 
earlier, such as Lucretius. 
The relation of the first element of compounds to 
the second should always be noted. The first limits or 
defines the second, and for this reason takes the stress ; 
but the precise relation of the two elements is now of 
one sort, now of another. Sometimes it may be ex- 
pressed by a preposition, sometimes by the sign of a 
case, sometimes by an adjective: geers-hoppa, geers- 
stapa, grasshopper, hopper in or through the grass ; 
han-créd, cock’s-crowing ; héah-engel, high-angel, arch- 
angel ; gim-stan, gem-stone, jewel. 
Although compounds should be studied with refer- 
ence to the meaning and relation of their components, 
they should frequently be translated by a simple Mod- 
ern English word. Thus gershoppa may sometimes 
be translated by locust; gimstan should never be 
translated gemstone; and héahfeeder should always 
be rendered by patriarch or father.

SYNTAX. 
148. Object of this sketch.— The object of the present 
sketch is not to present a complete view of Old English 
syntax, even in outline, but rather to call attention to 
such peculiarities as are most likely to cause difficulty. 
Many constructions common to all the cultivated Euro- 
pean languages, especially to the inflected ones, will 
either be passed over without notice or but briefly 
touched upon. 
Nouns. 
149. Subject. — The subject of a finite verb is in the 
nominative case. For that of an infinitive, see 169. 
150. Predicate nominative. — A predicate noun (or 
adjective), denoting the same person or thing as its 
subject, agrees with it in case. Examples: ic eom 
Apollonius; det ic gewurde wedla. 
151. Apposition.— A noun annexed to another noun, 
and denoting the same person or thing, agrees with 
it in case. Examples: and wénde det héo Diana 
were, séo gyden; Arcestrates (gen.): dohtor Tes 
cyninges. 
Note hie sume = some of them.

-P-A-G-E-103
  
NOUNS. 89 
152. Vocative. —The vocative, which is identical in 
form with the nominative, is used in direct address. 
It may be preceded by an interjection, the second 
personal pronoun, or a possessive pronoun; this pos- 
sessive pronoun, when followed by an adjective, usually 
takes before the latter the demonstrative pronoun se. 
Examples: da s% Neptune; min se léofesta fader. 
153. Genitive with nouns. — The genitive is distinc- 
tively an adnominal case; that is, its principal function is 
to limit the meaning of a noun. Its sign is ef. It denotes 
various relations, not all of which can be strictly defined. 
a) Relationship: ire ealra médor. 
6) Source: sunnan and modnan léoman; dere 
hearpan swég; fremdra déo0da ungedwéernes. 
¢) Subject. The noun in the genitive stands for the 
author of the action denoted by the noun upon which 
the genitive is dependent. Example: dinra hal- 
gena earnungum,. 
d) Object. This may be known by the possibility 
of turning the noun upon which it is dependent into 
a cognate verb, when the noun in the genitive will 
become the odject of that verb; for example, in Fréan 
egesan, Fréan is an obj. gen., because, if we substi- 
tute for the noun egesa, fear, the verb fear, the noun 
Lord becomes the object of the verb. Examples: ds 
dzges liehtinge; lifes tilungum; unsceddigra 
beswicend; l#swe scéapa and néata; hyht hé#le. 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
90 SYNTAX. 
e) Cause (denoted by for): léan Dissa sw%s- 
enda. 
Jf) Characteristic: meregreotan #lces hiwes; 
tréowum missenlicra cynna; setl his meg- 
endrymnesse. Here, perhaps, belongs: werhades 
and wifhades hé gescéop hie. 
g) Specification of time: Anes mindes fierst. 
h) Specification of place: garsecges igland (Latin 
influence). 
t) Unclassified: Ore néowolnesse bradnes ; 
Jet megen lufe; J#re sprx#ce ende. 
  154. Partitive genitive.— The genitive denotes the 
whole, with words denoting a part. 
a) With nouns: unrim ceastra; fela géara; 
lythwon cwicera cynna. 
6) With pronouns: manna #nigne; hiera nan; 
hwile G6ower; gumena gehwene; hwethwugu 
swileces; sé manna. Note the peculiar anra 
gehwile, each one. 
c) With numerals: eahta fota; féower hund 
wintra. 
d) With superlatives: béacna beorhtost. Simi- 
larly, with a cognate noun, to denote eminence: 
dryhtna Dryhten. 
155. Genitive with adjectives. — The genitive is used 
to define an adjective with respect to the part or 
relation in which the quality is conceived. Such
-P-A-G-E-105
  NOUNS. 91 
adjectives are frequently akin to verbs which take 
the genitive (156), and sometimes correspond to Latin 
adjectives of inclination in -az. They may be roughly 
classified as follows : — 
a) Want: d#lléas mines rénes; idel and unnyt 
goda (154. 6) gehwilces. 
6) Fulness: berende (Lat. ferar) missenlicra 
fugla. 
ec) Desire: ®tes georn. 
d) Retentiveness: feesthafol (Lat. tenav) minra 
goda. 
e) Knowledge: wordes wis. 
156. Genitive with verbs.— The genitive is used with 
many verbs, mostly such as denote mental action, but 
also with those of cessation and refusal, and some 
others. Frequently the underlying notion is a parti- 
tive one; that is, the object is conceived as affected 
in part. 
a) Desire: frid'es wilnedon. 
6) Request: biddende minra géda. 
ce) Rejoicing: pas se hlanca gefeah. 
d) Experiment: weda cunnedan. 
e) Use: eardes briicad. 
f) Care: giemden dvs deges. 
g) Supposition or belief: ndhtes elles wéndon; 
dws geliefan.

h) Fear: ne ondr#d da 3& Zniges Dinges. 
¢) Granting: ara unnan. 
Jj) Refusal: tide forwierndest. 
k) Cessation: geswae his weorces. 
1) Awaiting: Jes wordes bad. 
m) Approaching: céoles néosan. 
n) Producing: gasta stréonan. 
157. Adverbial genitive. — Certain adverbial relations 
may be expressed by the genitive (cf. 71). Example: 
hine gewende Ss weges. 
1. The demonstrative det is frequently used in the 
genitive in various adverbial senses. Thus of time, 
des (Je) = from the time that, after, afterwards; 
of manner, = as far as, as; of cause, = for this, 
because ; etc. 
158. Genitive with prepositions. — The genitive is occa- 
sionally used with certain prepositions, such as wid, td, 
and wana. Examples: wid des festengeates; 
tO Des; Anes wana siextig (78. 5). 
159. Genitive with other cases.— Verbs which take a 
genitive denoting the thing, may also take a dative or 
accusative of the person. 
a) With dative Cncluding reflexives, 184): him 
(164. a) ne ade (156. 7) God lengran lifes; 
nolde g&é mé (dat.) wda tidian (156. 7); gé

dé (acc.) Shtes axian; hine fultumes bdon; 
v8 twéonie TXre spr#ce; merelidendum (161) 
miltsa biddan wuldres Aldor (acc.);  Segnas 
dearle gelyste (190) gargewinnes. 
160. Dative in general.— The dative denotes the 
indirect object, usually the person to or for or with 
reference to whom something is done. When used 
with verbs (164), the general notion of the verb may 
often be regarded as implying some sort of giving (or 
its opposite), if this term be employed in its widest 
sense. 
1. The dative is sometimes used for the instru- 
mental (174): cleopode micelre stefne. 
161. Dative of benefit or interest.— The sign of this 
dative is for. Examples: scipu é0w eallum ic 
wyree. Perhaps also: Sinre eordan ne rind. 
1. Akin to this is the reflexive dative (184): det 
hie him (for themselves) w%pnu worhten. 
2. Similar, too, is the dative of possession, which, 
without much change in the sense, might be replaced 
by the genitive: him féollon téaras of d%m éagum 
(so Ger. thm fielen Thriinen von den Augen); him 
men feaht on list; wulfum td willan.  
-P-A-G-E-108
  
  94 SYNTAX. 
162. Dative of deprivation.— Some verbs of depriva- 
tion (cf. 177) take the dative of the object removed, 
sometimes with an accusative of the person from 
whom. Examples: hé hine unserydde 3%m healf- 
an sciccelse; Dingum ongierede and genac- 
odode. 
163. Dative of resemblance or approach. — This is 
self-explanatory. 
a) With verbs: geflit cymd 0%m beheald- 
endum. 
6) With adjectives (cf. 165): fugole gelicost. 
164. Dative with various verbs. — Such are verbs

m) Opposing: worulde widsacan. 
n) Betraying or deserting: swicad 06. 
o) Using (are): notad crefte minum. 
165. Dative with adjectives. — The dative is chiefly 
employed with adjectives signifying dear, generous, 
useful, obedient, etc., and their opposites. Examples : 
lidwérigum éste; Gode done léofan feeder (the 
father dear to God); behéfe ic eom cyninge; 
folcum fracod. 
1. The dative of want or deprivation (cf. 162) is 
also found here: Gode orfeorme. 
166. Dative with prepositions. — The dative is by 
far the commonest case with prepositions. Examples 
would be superfluous. 
1. After the preposition on (in), certain adjectives, 
like mid and ufanweard, agree with the following 
noun, instead of being treated like nouns governing 
it in the genitive, as are their counterparts in Mod. 
Eng. Examples: on midre dre s® (so Lat. 
in medio mari, but Mod. Eng. in the midst of the 
sea); on JH¥m festene ufanweardum. 
167. Dative absolute. — A noun and a participle, not 
involved in the main construction of the sentence,
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 SYNTAX. 
may stand by themselves in the dative, and consti- 
tute an adverbial clause, most frequently of time. 
This construction is imitated from the Latin ablative 
absolute. Examples: onfangenre his blétsunge; 
disum eallum dus geddnum. 
168. Accusative after transitive verbs.— The direct 
object of a transitive verb is put in the accusative. 
Examples: hé swang Done top; ealne nordd#l 
genomon. 
1. A special case of the foregoing is the cognate 
accusative, in which the object is etymologically akin 
to the verb: libbad hiera lif. 
169. Subject accusative. — The subject of an infini- 
tive is put in the accusative. Examples: geseah hé 
sumne fiscere gan; hé gehierde Sone blisse- 
sang itipastigan. 
170. Accusative of extent.— The accusative may de- 
note extent of time or space. Example: wees se 
storm ealne Jone deg swide micel and strang. 
171. Accusative after impersonals.— Impersonals (190) 
of appetite or passion govern an accusative of the 
person suffering. Example: mé hyngrede. 
172. Accusative after prepositions. — Some preposi- 
tions always govern the accusative, others only under
-P-A-G-E-111
  NOUNS. 97 
certain circumstances. Those of the former class 
are geond, 63, durh, and ymb(e); of the latter, 
a large number that more frequently take the 
dative (166). 
1. Of the second class, on (in) is perhaps the com- 
monest representative, taking the dative when denoting 
rest in, the accusative when denoting motion towards ; 
this distinction, however, is not invariably observed. 
Examples of accusative: inéode on Det bed; in 
Oezet mynster éode. 
Exceptions to the rule are: on Sone seofodan 
deg; mid Jone bisceop. 
173. Two accusatives.— Verbs signifying to make, to 
name, to regard, and the like, may take a_ predicate 
accusative besides the object accusative. Examples: 
God hine (obj. acc.) geworhte wundorlicne and 
fegerne; God geciegde 34 drygnesse (obj. acc.) 
eordan; hwonne gesawon wé dé (obj. acc.) hun- 
grigne? 
174. Instrumental in general. — The instrumental, 
which in form is sometimes (especially in the plural) 
indistinguishable from the dative (see 160. 1), denotes 
manner, means, instrument, or material. Its sign is by 
or with. Examples: geseah blidum andwlitan; 
gestadolade strangum mihtum; gefzstnade 
folmum; gefrztwade foldan scéatas leomum 
and léafum. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    98 SYNTAX. 
This case is more common in poetry than in 
prose, where its place is often taken by mid with 
the dative; even in poetry, the simple instrumental 
sometimes alternates with the dative accompanied by 
mid, e.g. (Andreas, 320) sarewide occurs in the same 
construction as mid oferhygdum. Occasionally the 
instrumental is employed where Modern English 
would use an accusative: mundum brugdon, they 
waved (with) their hands. 
The instrumental being one of the more difficult 
cases to master, a few of its regular combinations are 
separately appended : — : 
a) With verbs of journeying and transporting, where 
its sign may almost be regarded as in: céolum lidan; 
fedmum ferian; side gesdhte. So with libban: 
dréamum lifdon. 
6) With verbs of speaking, to indicate voice or lan- 
guage (see also 160. 1): wordum cwd; ondsweor- 
odon géncewidum. 
e) With past participles, generally preceding the 
latter (common in poetry): sweordum gehéawen; 
hilde ges#ged; dOme gedjyrsod. 
d) With adjectives (generally in poetry), to denote 
in what respect, or sometimes instrumentality: fedver- 
um hrémig; ecgum gecoste; mundum fréorig ; 
synnum wunde. These last two afford the met- 
rical combinations exhibited in 217. 1—among the 
commonest in Old English.
-P-A-G-E-113
  ADJECTIVES. 99 
175. Instrumental with prepositions. — Mid, which fre- 
quently takes the dative, is sometimes found with the 
instrumental, especially in the Anglian dialect; so 
occasionally for. Examples: mid ealle; mid micle 
sige; mid Jy réadestan godwebbe; for hwy. 
176. Adverbial instrumental. — The instrumental may 
denote adverbial relations, especially time when. Exam- 
ples: sume dege; dy seofodan dxge; #lce 
géare; word stunde ahof. : 
1. It may also denote the number of times: siex- 
tiene sidum. 
2. The instrumental may denote the way: OY ilean 
wege. 
177. Instrumental of deprivation. — Some verbs of 
deprivation may take an object of which in the 
instrumental (cf. 162). Examples: madmum be- 
dzled; ®htum benx#mde. 
178. Instrumental of difference. — The instrumental 
denotes the measure of difference. Examples: micle 
lengran; OY bealdran; pon cymlicor; strengre 
eallum 0#m #rgedonum.

nouns, and to participles, when used as adjectives. 
When used predicatively, however, participles may 
be uninflected.

tion in the use of strong and weak adjectives, see 55. 
181. Adjectives as nouns.— An adjective may be used 
as a noun (see 55). Examples: 3& ymbsittendan;

Verbs. 
186. Forms of the verb.— Old English verbs are 
either transitive or intransitive. They have two 
voices, — active and passive; three moods, — indica- 
tive, optative, and imperative — besides the infinitive, 
gerund, and participles; and five tenses, — present, 
preterit, perfect, pluperfect, and future. The uses 
of these forms correspond, in general, to those of 
the same forms in other languages. 
187. Voices. — The forms of the active voice are 
given in) 95; those of the passive are formed by 
adding the past participle to the appropriate tense of 
wesan (béon), be, or weordan, become. 
188. Tenses. — Only two independent tenses are dis- 
tinguished by their stems, — the present and the pret- 
erit. The present may also be used for the future;

wise the distinctions of tense are indicated by means 
of auxiliaries, as in Modern English: the future being 
formed by the infinitive with sculan, shall (133), and

willan, will (139); the perfect and pluperfect, by the 
past participles with the appropriate tenses of hab- 
ban, have (121), in the case of transitive verbs, and 
of wesan, be (138), in the case of intransitives. 
189. Agreement.— A finite verb agrees with its sub- 
ject in number and person. Exceptions are: — 
1. When the subject consists of two nouns denoting 
essentially the same thing, united by a conjunction, 
the verb in agreement may be in the singular: sie 
sibb and ged0wrnes betweoh iis. 
2. A collective noun may take a verb in the plural: 
séo cnéoris wagon and l#ddon. 
3. A plural verb, with a predicate in the plural, 
may be introduced by a neuter singular: Sat w#ron 
engla gastas; hit Sonne wxron mine weeteru. 
Norr. — The subject is sometimes to be supplied (cf. 190): hét 
Set léoht Deg. 
190. Impersonals.— Impersonal verbs are those whose 
subject is an implied hit, ct. They are often transi- 
tive, taking an object in the dative or accusative (164. 
k,l; 171). Examples: mé Jyncd; mé hyngrede; 
swa gesxlde iu; hi hyre xt beaduwe gespéow. 
Sometimes they take two cases: pegnas gelyste 
gargewinnes (159. 5). 
191. Indicative. — The indicative has the functions 
common to it in most languages.
-P-A-G-E-117
  VERBS. 103, 
192. Optative in general.— The optative, sometimes 
called the subjunctive, is used to express an action 
or state simply as conceived by the mind. It is 
employed either in independent sentences or in sub- 
ordinate clauses. Of these subordinate clauses there 
are two principal kinds,— substantive or noun clauses, 
and adverbial clauses. Of these, the noun clauses, 
generally introduced by det, are the more important. 
Whenever the conjunction det can be translated in 
order that or so that, it introduces an adverbial clause ; 
otherwise, a noun clause. Other adverbial clauses are 
those of place, time, and manner. Less frequent are 
adjective clauses, introduced by or implying a relative 
pronoun. 
193. Optative in independent clauses. — Under this 
head falls -the use of the optative (a) to express a 
command or an emphatic wish; (6) in doubtful ques- 
tions implying a negative answer; and (c) in hypo- 
thetical sentences. 
a) Command: béo ni léoht; adl dé fornime; 
gan wé sécean. 
6) Question: hwet Donne mé fremede gedeorf 
min ? 
c) Hypothesis: sie Det du sie. 
194. Optative in noun clauses. — The noun clause 
takes the place either of the subject (or predicate 
nominative) or of the object of a principal clause.
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 SYNTAX. 
The object clause is commonest after verbs of knowl- 
edge, affirmation, command, and desire, such as know, 
say, order, wish, etc. 
a) Subject clause: ‘licad 0&6 Det Apollonius dus 
heonan fare; wén is Jet Ji geméte sumne. 
6) Object clause: gewite hwet se geonga mann 
sie; ne meahte findan hwile hiera _ forliden 
wre; ic 0€ bebéode Set Ji Tet nxnigum 
menn cyde; ic wysce det ic eft forlidennesse 
gefare. 
Nore. — Certainty is rendered by the indicative: ic oncnawe 
Set Ji eart wel gel&red. 
- 195. Optative by attraction.— This is a name given 
to the optative found in clauses following another 
optative. Examples: sprytte (193. a) séo eorde 
tréow, dzs s#d sie on him selfum; wen is det 
di geméte (194. a) sumne det DE gemiltsie; 
Desde Di geare forwite (196. f) hwem da 
gemiltsie; dt sum gestréon ic mé begiete 
(196. f), Danan ic mé Aféde. 
196. Optative in adverbial clauses.— These are clauses 
of place (where), of time (before, until, when, while), 
of manner (as if), conditional (if), concessive 
(though), final (in order that), and consecutive (so 
that). Hypothetical or indefinite character in some 
measure attaches to the optative in each.
-P-A-G-E-119
VERBS. 105 
a) Place: Set di wer gecéose der Tu self 
wille. 
6) Time: #r se deg cume; bid 69-dxet hé cume. 
¢) Manner: swilce hé cuma wre. 
d) Conditional: gif 3m ne finde nznne, wend 
Sonne hider ongéan; swa hit dé ne mislicie. 
But sometimes indicative: gif di mé geliefst. 
e) Concessive: déah Di stille sie. ; 
Jf) Final: and gesette hie on dre heofonan, 
det hie scinen ofer eordan. So with dxs-de: 
des-Je Ji geare forwite. Negative: Jy-l#s-de TE 
twéonie. 
g) Consecutive: adl 9& fornime, det Ji ne 
béo hal. 
197. Optative in adjective clauses. — Whenever a 
sentence introduced by an actual or virtual relative 
implies an element of doubt, it may take the opta- 
tive. Examples: gecéose zenne, hwilene da wille 
(hwilene is a virtual relative); swa-hwet-swa da 
wille. 
198. Imperative.— The imperative is used in -com- 
mands, sometimes with the second personal pronoun, 
sometimes without. Examples: béo blide mid ts; 
wite dt; gé efthwerfad to ciricean 
199. Infinitive. — The infinitive is construed as a 
neuter noun, the subject or object of a finite verb.
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 SYNTAX. 
When the object, it may itself have a subject noun 
or pronoun in the accusative (169). 
a) Subject (or pred. nom., 150): micel hiend and 
sceamu hit is nellan. 
b) Object: nellan wesan; hét hyre dinenne 
héafod onwridan. 
1. An object infinitive is sometimes used for pur- 
poses of specification. With verbs of motion this 
may often be translated by the present participle, 
occasionally by the infinitive of purpose (= in order 
to). Examples: cOmon lidan; gewat him gangan; 
féran gasta stréonan (purpose). 
200. Gerund. — The gerund may usually be trans- 
lated by the Mod. Eng. infinitive, in a variety of 
senses. Examples: cOmon minre dohtor td bid- 
danne; land swide feorr t6 geséceanne; 08 
éstas him beforan legde de hé him tO béodanne 
heefde. 
‘ Prepositions. 
201. Cases governed. — For the cases governed by 
prepositions, see 158, 166, 172, 175. ‘ 
1. The preposition sometimes follows its. object, or 
immediately precedes the verb, and at times is diffi- 
cult to distinguish from an adverb, or a prefix of the 
verb. Examples: de (87. c) 0% wfter axodest; de 
OU swi wel wid gedést.

203. Old English verse stichic.—Old English verse is 
rarely strophic, but almost without exception stichic; 
that is, consists of ungrouped lines, following each 
other as in Modern English blank verse. 
204. The line and the hemistich.— The line of poetry 
consists of two hemistichs, separated by the cesura. 
Example : — 
bord and brad swyrd, brine helmas. 
The hemistich may be either normal or expanded. 
A normal hemistich contains two metrical feet. Ex- 
ample : — 
céne under cumblum. 
An expanded hemistich contains three metrical feet. 
Example : — 
swidm0d sinces ahte. 
205. The foot.— A metrical foot is a portion of a 
line containing one primary stress. The syllable re- 
ceiving the primary stress may or may not be fol- 
lowed or preceded by one or more lighter or slurred 
syllables. 
108
-P-A-G-E-123
  PROSODY. 109 
Of the lighter syllables following or preceding a pri- 
mary stress, one may, under certain circumstances, re- 
ceive a secondary stress (23). A syllable which receives 
neither primary nor secondary stress is called unstressed. 
206. Stressed and unstressed syllables. — The primary 
stress nearly always falls upon a long syllable; this 
long syllable may, however, be represented by two 
syllables, of which the first is short, and the second so 
light as to admit of syncopation. The substitution of 
two such short syllables for a single long one is called 
resolution. | 
A long syllable is one which contains a long vowel 
or diphthong, or a short vowel followed by two conso- 
nants. A short syllable, is one which contains a short 
vowel followed by a single consonant (4). Long and 
short syllables, when stressed, are represented in metri- 
cal schemes by the macron, —, and the breve, v, respec- 
tively. Stressed syllables are indicated by the acute 
or grave accent, according as the stress is primary or 
secondary. Unstressed syllables, whether short or long, 
are represented by the oblique cross, x. 
The syllable which receives the primary stress is 
usually the root syllable of a word, while the lighter 
or slurred syllables comprise the terminations, enclitics, 
and proclitics; occasionally, however, the second ele- 
ment of a compound word is reckoned as a slurred 
syllable, though usually it takes a secondary stress.
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 PROSODY. 
207. Classification of feet.— The terms éambiec, trochaic, 
. ete., are used analogically, with reference to stress, and 
not, as in Greek and Latin prosody, with primary refer- 
ence to quantity. This being understood, Old English 
metrical feet may be classified as follows: — 
1. Monosyllabic: The monosyllabic foot regularly 
consists of a long syllable under the primary stress, 4. 
This foot is never found except in conjunction with one 
of the dactylic type having a secondary stress (1. A to 
1. k, 216). 
2. Disyllabic: The disyllabic foot may be either tro- 
chaic, 2x, or iambic, x 2. In the trochaic foot, the 
unstressed syllable may be replaced by a long syllable 
under the secondary stress. The dactyl formed by the 
resolution of the trochee may be called the light dactyl, 
to distinguish it from the heavy or normal dactyl, in 
which the first syllable is long. 
8. Trisyllabic: The trisyllabic foot is either dactylic, 
4X x, or anapestic, x x4. If dactylic, either the second 
or third syllable has in some cases secondary stress. 
4. Polysyllabic: If tetrasyllabic, this foot resembles 
either a first pwon, 2x xx, or a fourth pwon, x x xz. 
If it contains a greater number of syllables, it is still 
essentially dactylic or anapestic in effect, 2x xx... or 
oe X XXL, 
In any of the foregoing feet, resolution may take 
place, thus apparently increasing the number of typical 
syllables.
-P-A-G-E-125
  PROSODY. 111 
208. Anacrusis.— Before hemistichs beginning with 
a primary stress, one or more unstressed syllables may 
occur. These unstressed syllables constitute what is 
known as the anacrusis. It is rare at the beginning 
of the second hemistich, but more frequent before the 
first. 
209. Expanded hemistichs.— These are formed by pre- 
fixing a foot of the form 2x... (less frequently 4, and 
rarely in the first hemistich x2) to a regular hemistich 
of two stresses. Expanded lines are employed in pas- 
sages of peculiar elevation and solemnity, or expressive 
of unwonted agitation. The expanded hemistich has 
three stresses, instead of the normal two, since the pre- 
fixed portion differs from the anacrusis in having a 
primary stress. As a rule, the first and second stresses 
of the first hemistich, when expanded, take alliteration, 
while in the second hemistich the place of the allitera- 
tive syllable is unchanged, coinciding normally with the 
(new) second stress. Example :— 
béaga and beorhtra madma, hi bet pre beorhtan idese. 
210. Alliteration.— Alliteration is a poetical ornament 
which is a distinctive feature of Old English verse. It 
consists in the employment of the same or similar 
sounds at the beginning of two or more syllables which 
receive the primary stress. The second hemistich con- 
tains one such alliterative syllable, as a rule that which
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 PROSODY. 
has the first primary stress; the first hemistich has reg- 
ularly two, though frequently only one. The allitera- 
tive sound must be the same throughout, if consonantal ; 
if vocalic, it is usually different in the three syllables. 
Examples are : — 
a) grame gidfrecan, garas sendon. 
b) on Set degred sylf, dynedan scildas. 
c) earn @tes georn, trigfedera. 
In expanded lines, the additional foot frequently 
takes alliteration, thus removing it from one of its 
normal positions. 
211. Alliteration in relation to stress. —'The accentual 
principles observed by Old English poets in their man- 
agement of alliteration virtually reduce themselves to 
one: that the most important syllables of the most im- 
portant words should receive primary stress. It must 
be borne in mind, however, that the stress is sometimes 
rhetorical, that is, depends not so much upon the intrin- 
sic weight of the word as upon that which belongs to 
it in virtue of its relation to other words in the same 
sentence. For example, a preposition might be ex- 
pected to have less intrinsic weight than a following 
noun, yet instances occur where the preposition allit 
erates. 
One general rule is that if a noun and a verb are 
found in the same hemistich, it is the noun that allite- 
rates.
-P-A-G-E-127
  PROSODY. 113 
212. Difference between the two hemistichs.— The first 
hemistich frequently differs from the second, not only 
in the number of its alliterative syllables, but also in 
that of the unstressed syllables admitted between two 
primary stresses, or in the form of anacrusis. 
213. Rime. — Rime and various forms of assonance 
are occasionally employed by Old English poets, some- 
times for the purpose of uniting more closely the two 
halves of the same line, less frequently to associate the 
second half of a line with the first or second half of the 
following line, rarely in formulas or compounds within 
the same hemistich. 
214. Masculine and feminine rime.— Masculine or mon- 
osyllabic rime is perfect when the riming vowels are 
identical, and are followed by the same consonants or 
consonant combinations. Example (from Béowulf):— 
éode yrremod: him of éagum stod. 
Feminine or polysyllabie (usually disyllabic) rime is 
perfect when the first riming syllables are perfect mas- 
culine rimes and the following syllables are identical. 
Example : — 
scildburh sc#ron, scéotend wéron. 
There are also various sorts of imperfect rime. 
215. Kennings. — A characteristic ornament of Old 
English, as well as of early Teutonic poetry in general, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 PROSODY. 
are the kennings. This term, which is of Norse origin, 
designates those synonyms or periphrastic phrases which 
are employed to diversify the expression of a thought, 
or to avoid the repetition of the same word, usually a 
noun. Many of these are striking metaphors, but by 
no means all; some, though metaphorical in their origin, 
were undoubtedly so familiar to the poet and audience 
that their peculiar significance was overlooked, and they 
were regarded as stereotyped and convenient synonyms. 
Examples of kennings for God are: arfast Cyning, 
mihtig Dryhten, Metod, Fréa zlmihtig. 
216. Ordinary sequences of long and hort syllables.! — 
Before proceeding to examine the metrical constitution 
of the hemistich, it is desirable to consider the ordinary 
sequences of long and short syllables in Old English, 
and particularly in Old English poetry. . 
1. Long syllables followed by short or slurred sylla- 
bles. A long stressed syllable may be followed : — 
a) by a derivative or inflectional syllable: setiras 7 x 
6) by a monosyllabic proclitic: eft to LK 
¢) by a monosyllabic prefix: mdd a(réted) 2x 
d) by a derivative or inflectional syllable + a mono-

lables. In addition to the cases instanced under 1. 4 and 
i, which belong under the head of secondary stress,  
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 PROSODY. 
stressed syllables proper are here to be considered. A 
long syllable may be followed : — 
a) by a monosyllabic word: brad swyrd LOLS 
6) when a monosyllable, by the first syllable of a 
disyllabic word: dim ag(on) L4029 
¢) when a monosyllable, by the first syllable of a tri- 
syllabic word: sang hild(elé0d) LAES) 
@) when the second syllable of a disyllabic word, by 
the first syllable of a disyllabic word: (ge)gan heefd(on) 
LLG 
e) when the first syllable of a polysyllabic word (often 
a compound), by the second syllable of the same word: 
nidheard, burhléod(um) ZLCAS) 
4. Short stressed syllables followed by short or 
slurred syllables. A short, stressed syllable may be 
followed : — 
a) by a single unstressed syllable, forming with it two 
metrical syllables: eyning Ox 
6) by an unstressed syllable, forming with it the met- 
rical equivalent of a single long syllable, and capable of 
being substituted for the latter in every position: ade(le) 
eae) 
Compounds are metrically regarded, for the most part, 
as composed of two independent words, but their length, 
taken in connection with the invariability of their typi- 
cal forms, restricts the employment of certain compounds 
to particular metrical schemes. Thus, compounds like 
hildenzdran are adapted to hemistichs of the trochaic

217. Constitution of the hemistich.— There are five 
normal types of the hemistich, which may be called 
respectively (cf. 207) the 1) trochaic (dactylic), 2) 
the iambic (anapestic), 3) the iambic-trochaic, 4) the 
monosyllabic-bacchic (or -cretic), and the 5) bacchic- 
monosyllabic. Types 4 and 5 occasionally become tro- 
chaic-bacchic and bacchic-trochaic respectively. 
Every hemistich ends either in a stressed syllable, or 
in a stressed syllable followed by a single short syllable 
(exceptionally by two short syllables, as in 216. 4. 6). 
Oceasionally a greater number of unstressed syllables 
than three occur together, but without destroying the 
character of the verse as belonging to one of the fore- 
going types. 
218. Constitution of the various types. —1. The first or 
trochaic (dactylic) type is formed by the union of two 
feet like those found in 1. a to 1. gy above. Thus: — 
biddan wylle 2x|Z2x 
ewicera cynna OXx|2Zx 
ealde ge geonge 4x x|[Zx 
With anacrusis (208): — 
odve sundoryrfes KK AX | Ax. 
Occasionally, by the introduction of two consecutive 
long syllables, as in 3. e, there occur hemistichs of these 
forms : —

by the union of two feet like those found in 2. a to 2. g 
above. Thus: — 
se hyhsta d&1 %.2(*Z 
berad linde ford XXL RZ 
nu ic gumena gehweene XOX|XXG 
With extra unstressed syllables in the first foot (207. 
4):— pet hé in pet bargeteld xxxxZ|xZ 
8. The third or iambic-trochaic type is formed by the 
union of two feet like those found in 1. @ to 1. g and 2. 
a to 2. g respectively. Thus: —

and gé dom agon MERE aA

Rarely a short stressed syllable : —

zt Jam escplegan gee | GiX 
With extra unstressed syllables in the first foot: — 
pe hie ofercuman mihton KARE 
It will be observed that where two long syllables 
meet in the middle of the hemistich there is such a 
sequence as in 3. a to 3. e. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
PROSODY. 119 
4, The fourth or monosyllabic-bacchic type is formed 
by the union of a monosyllabic foot with such as are 
found in 1.4 and1.i (a). Thus: — 
megd modigre Z| x 
heled higerdfe oI aw 
ee aX QIN 
Similarly, the monosyllabic-cretic takes groups like 1. 7 
(8), 1.7, and 1. & for the second foot : — 
sang hildeleéod eae 
An example of the trochaic-bacchic type (found only in 
first hemistichs) is: — 
stOpon styrnmode Xa ee SX 
. Where two long syllables belonging to different feet 
come together in the pure type, we have various cases 
under 3, the one above being under ec. 
5. The fifth or bacchic-monosyllabic type is formed 
by the union of such feet as are found in 1. 4 and 1.7 
(a) with a monosyllabic foot. Thus: —

219. Frequency of the various types. — The relative 
frequency of the various types is indicated by their 
order in the last paragraph, though Types 2 and 3 
are not far from equal. Thus, in the poem of Judith, 
the percentages are, in round numbers, as follows, not 
counting expanded lines, which mostly belong to

THE CREATION OF THE WORLD. 
(Zlfrie’s Translation of Genesis, I.-II. 3.) 
{In the earlier pages, references will be made to the forms of 
words as they occur in the Vocabulary, whenever there might be diffi- 
culty in discovering the latter. Other references are self-explanatory. 
The student should by all means be familiar, before beginning

On the other hand, it has such undoubted Anglian peculiarities that it 
has been suggested (by Miller, its latest editor) that ‘the version may 
have been executed by Mercian scholars under orders from the king,’”’ and 
that it was possibly made at Lichfield. 
The distinction between English idiom and imitation of the Latin should 
be remarked, wherever possible. Moberly’s edition of the Ecclesiastical 
History, which contains scholarly and interesting notes, may profitably be 
compared.]

2 On the Picts the last edition 
of Chambers’ Encyclopedia re- 
marks: ‘‘ Four hypotheses have 
been formed in regard to the 
language and origin of the Picts. 
The first, started by Pinkerton 
and put by Sir Walter Scott into 
the mouth of the ‘Antiquary,’ is 
that they were Teutons, speak- 
ing a Gothic dialect; the second, 
maintained by Dr. Skene, is that 
they were Gaelic-speaking Celts ; 
... the third, due to Professor 
Rhys, is that the Picts were non- 
Aryans, whose language was over- 
laid’ by loans from Welsh and Trish; and the fourth, held by 
two of the most eminent Celtic 
scholars of the day, Professor 
Windisch and Dr. Whitley 
Stokes, is that they were Celts, 
but more nearly allied to the 
Cymry than to the Gael... . 
The conclusion to which we 
come is that the Picts, what- 
ever traces they show of a non- 
Aryan racial element, . . . spoke 
a Celtic language belonging to a 
branch of Celtic allied to the 
Cymric, . . . and that this dia- 
lect of the Gallo-Cymric stock 
was a wave of Celtic speech 
from the continent previous to 
the Gaulish which held England 
when Cesar entered Britain.”

on one of its sides is the following 
inscription : —

block, but is now in the south

Merivale of Ely has suggested 
that the words are meant for a

being elided even before a con-

(From Wulfstan’s Homilies, No. 49.) 
[Wulfstan — also known by his Latinized name, Lupus — was Bishop of 
Worcester and Archbishop of York from 1002 to 1023. This homily is one 
of those attributed to him, but, according to Napier, with insufficient 
reason, as a portion of it is found in the Blickling Homilies, the manu- 
script of which bears the date of 971.]

1 See p. 156, n. 12. 
2 This resembles the use of gin 
in Chaucer, almost as an auxiliary 
tense-sign, like do in Mod. Eng., 
the latter not being thus used in 
OE. In Chaucer it usually occurs 
as the preterit gan, ¢.g. in the 
Clerk’s Tale, 392: ‘‘til the sonne 
gan descende.’’? See Lounsbury’s 
History of the English Language. 
An interesting parallel is to be 
found in New Testament Greek, 
as, for example, Acts 1.1: ‘The 
former treatise I made, O The- 
ophilus, concerning all that Jesus 
began (jpéaro) both to do and to 
teach.”” According to Thayer, 
however (Greek-English Lexicon 
of the New Testament), there is 
in its employment always a sense 
of beginning, in'its proper mean- 
ing. 
3 Dependent, like feallan, on 
onginnad. Give the ind. pret. 
plur. 
4It would be interesting to 
know from what literary source 
these illustrations are ultimately 
derived. They remind one of Shakespeare (Rich. lIL, 1. 3. 
259-260): — 
They that stand high have many 
blasts to shake them ; 
And if they fall, they dash them- 
selves to pieces. 
Cf. also 3 Hen. VI, 5, 2. 11-15. 
No doubt many Elizabethan par- 
allels could be found; I have 
noted in Chapman, Byron’s Con- 
spiracy, Act 3, Scene 1 (p. 282 
of Shepherd’s ed.), and Byron’s 
Tragedy, Act 5, Scene 1 (Jb., 
p. 272). Perhaps the Eliza- 
bethans may have derived them 
from Seneca; cf. the Chorus in 
Act 4 of the Hippolytus, vv. 
1123-1143 ; = Hercules Furens 
201; Qidipus 8-11. Seneca 
may have caught a suggestion 
from Sophocles, though the par- 
allel is somewhat remote; see 
the latter’s Antigone, vv. 712- 
717, and Horace, C. II. 10. 
5 See 58. 1. 
® Redundant. What is din in 
Mod. Eng. (24)? Whence is the 
adverb down derived ?

APOLLONIUS OF TYRE. 
[The Old English version of the Romance of Apollonius, from which our 
extract is taken, belongs, according to Wiilker, to the second third of the 
eleventh century; according to Ebert, to its beginning; and according to 
Riese, most probably to the tenth. The original story was almost certainly 
written in Greek, probably in the third century of our era, and by an imi- 
tator of Xenophon of Ephesus. This is lost, and is only represented by a 
Latin version, which may have been made in the same century, and in 
any case not later than the sixth, by a writer of no great education, 
who introduced Christian terms and conceptions, added some things, and 
retrenched others. Over a hundred manuscripts of this Latin version are 
known, of which twelve are in England. Scarcely any two manuscripts 
agree, and the discrepancies are often great; still, for convenience, they 
have been grouped into three main classes. To the third of these, which 
is not the equal of the other two, the immediate original of our version 
must have belonged, resembling most nearly a manuscript of the Bodleian 
Library (Laud H. 39), and, at the next further remove, one of the British 
Museum (Sloan. 1619). 
The popularity of the romance is attested not only by the number and 
variety of the Latin manuscripts, but no less by the medieval and subse- 
quent translations into almost every modern language. Thus, for example, 
there is in Old French a romance of Jourdain de Blaie, the scene being 
laid in the time of Charlemagne, and the temple of Diana being converted 
into a nunnery. 
An abridgment of the Latin version found its way into the Gesta Roma- 
norum, as No. 153 of that collection. In the twelfth century the story was 
incorporated into the Pantheon of Godfrey of Viterbo, whence it was turned 
into English verse by Gower, in his Confessio Amantis (Pauli’s edition 3. 
284 ff.; Morley’s abridgment, in The Carisbrooke Library, pp. 410-431). 
From Gower it was borrowed by Shakespeare, or whoever was the author 
of the drama which passes under his name, as the groundwork of Pericles, 
Prince of Tyre; the name Pericles being perhaps adapted from the Pyro- 
cles of Sidney’s Arcadia. The scenes of Pericles which may be compared 
with our extract are the Ist, 2d, 3d, and 5th of Act II., and the 3d of Act V. 
The Old English Apollonius was edited by Thorpe, in 1834, from MS. S. 
18. 201 of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge ; and to this edition the student

is referred for the spelling and punctuation of the original. It is only a 
fragment, breaking off in the midst, and recommencing near the end of 
the tale, as we have indicated below. 
Further information will be found in Rohde, Der griechische Roman, 
Leipzig, 1876; Teuffel, History of Latin Literature, § 489; Singer, Apollo- 
nius von Tyrus, Halle, 1895 ; Zupitza’s article on the OE. i

and Riese’s edition of the Latin, which is the standard (Leipzig, 1871), and 
costs but a trifle. 
Besides the Tudor versions, there is an English translation in Thorpe’s 
edition, and another — of course not adhering closely to our text — in Swan’s 
rendering of the Gesta Romanorum (Bohn Library)].

1 Apollonius, King of Tyre, has 
fled from the cruelty and treach- 
ery of Antiochus, King of Anti- 
och, on a richly freighted vessel, 
and taken refuge with the citi- 
zens of Tarsus. Finding the citi- 
zens in extremity, on account of a 
prevalent famine, he relieves their 
necessities by liberal gifts, where- 
lupon they erect a statue of him 
in the market-place. But not- 
withstanding the gratitude of his 
beneficiaries, he finds it expedient 
to leave them, and embarks for Cyrene, on the African coast. It 
is at this point that our selection 
begins.

The infant daughter has 
grown up, and, after a variety 
of experiences, has been restored 
to Apollonius. His queen is 
priestess of Diana of Ephesus, 
and thither he proceeds, being 
warned by an angel in a dream 
to make that, instead of Tarsus, 
his next goal. At this point the

THE SIX DAYS’ WORK OF CREATION. 
(From Alfrie’s Hexameron.) 
[This may serve as a commentary on Selection I., which, it will be 
remembered, is a translation by Aélfric. Of the present work its editor, 
Norman, says (p. vii): ‘‘The treatise which is styled by Hickes in his 
‘Thesaurus’ the ‘Hexameron of St. Basil’ is by no means a literal trans- 
lation of the well known work of that father, but is partly original, and 
partly compiled from that work, and from the commentaries of the Ven- 
erable Bede upon Genesis. The author of it, from internal evidence, may 
be pronounced to be Atlfric, as frequent references are made to his homi- 
lies, and to his epistles on the Old and New Testament.”’ 
Of Basil’s (d. 379) delivery of the original Hexameron, there is a brief, 
but spiritéd, account in Villemain’s Tableau de U Bloquence Chrétienne au 
IV® Siécle (p. 116 ff.), from which we extract the following: ‘It is more 
interesting to survey him in the act of instructing the poor inhabitants of 
Cesarea, elevating them to God by the contemplation of nature, and ex- 
plaining to them the miracles of creation in discourses where the science of 
the orator who had been trained at Athens is concealed under a persuasive 
and popular simplicity. Such is the subject of the homilies which bear 
the name of Hexameron. Together with the errors in natural philosophy 
which are common to all antiquity, they contain many correct views, and 
descriptions at once felicitous and true.’’]

4 From the Greek word répvos,| 
one of whose senses is lathe 
chisel, comes the Greek, an 
hence the Latin (tornare) ver! 
meaning ‘to turn in a lathe,’ anc 1 A plural (see the verb) used 
as singular. Eastre (North. 
Eostre) was, as Bede tells us, 
the name of a goddess whose 
festival was celebrated at the 
vernal equinox; it is a deriva- 
tive of Gast (east, cognate with hence ‘to fashion,’ ‘smooth’ 
Skr. ushds, dawn), and_ this 
indicates that she was originally 
a goddess of the dawn. Bede 
adds that the passover-tide was 
so called, ‘“ Consueto antique 
observationis vocabulo gaudia 
nove solemnitatis vocantes.””

Lat. albus.

THE SONG OF THE GLEEMAN. 
(Beowulf 89-100.) 
[Hrothgar, King of the Danes, builds a spacious hall for the assembly of 
his retainers. There, from time to time, they are entertained by minstrelsy, 
— sometimes that of a professional gleeman, and sometimes improvised by 
one of the warriors, or even by the king himself (cf. Iliad 9. 185-189). 
In readitig the poetry, the paragraph of the Preface relating to the 
retention of MS. forms should be borne in mind.]

  XV. 
THE ROUT OF THE ASSYRIANS. 
(From the Judith.) 
[Of this extract Ten Brink has said (Early English Literature): “To a 
lucid, well-constructed narrative are joined epic profusion, vigor, and ani- 
mation. In the highest degree effective is the portrayal of Judith’s return 
to Bethulia, of the warlike advance of the Hebrews, of the surprise of the 
Assyrian camp, the terror of the Assyrian nobles, who dare not disturb 
their lord in his rest, and finally of the disbandment and flight of the 
heathen host.” 
The portion here given omits the discovery of Holofernes’ dead body by 
the Assyrians. It is based upon the Apocryphal book of Judith, the first 
few verses of the fifteenth chapter, especially verses 2, 5,7, and 11. For 
further particulars see my edition of the Judith. 
Attention is called to the device employed for indicating parallel or 
synonymous expressions, which have constituted one of the chief diffi- 
culties of OE. poetry. The device consists. in the enclosure between 
reference-letters of the parallel expressions, the synonyms being desig- 
nated by the same letters. For an example, see p. 204, ll. 5-7.)

SELECTIONS FROM THE ANDREAS. 
[The Andreas is a poem of about 1722 lines (the numbering differs 
according to the edition). Jacob Grimm considered it and the Elene to 
be (Preface to his edition, p. iv) ‘‘the most ancient and instructive pro- 
ductions of Old English poetry, next to the Béowulf.”’ With the help of 
Thilo, Grimm discovered (pp. xvi ff.) its source to be the Acts of Andrew 
and Matthew, written in Greek, and now published in Tischendorf’s Acta 
Apostolorum Apocrypha, pp. 132-166. Besides this poem, there is a prose 
version which may be profitably consulted, and which is to be found in 
Bright’s valuable Anglo-Saxon Reader, pp. 113-128. It is believed by many 
scholars that both these versions were made from a Latin translation of 
the Greek original, but this cannot he said to have been demonstrated, 
at least for the poem. The Greek original is discussed at length by Lip- 
sius, Die apokryphen Apostelgeschichten und Apostellegenden, pp. 546 ff. 
A portion of the Greek, corresponding to lines 235-349, is printed in 
Appendix III. 
According to Lipsius, the scene of the poem is the northern coast of 
the Black Sea; though the Old English poet had Africa in mind (ef. 1. 198), 
perhaps because the region about Colchis had by some been called the| 
inner or second Ethiopia. The Marmedonia (1. 30) or Mermedonia of our| 
text has been identified with Myrmecium, Gr. Mupujxioy, near the modern| 
Yenikale, in the Crimea. Here are supposed to have dwelt the Cimme-| 
rians of Homer, and here, in classic times, were settled various Scythian} 
tribes. Of the Tauri (Crimea was anciently the Twuric Chersonesus)| 
Herodotus says (4. 103): ‘‘ They sacrifice to the virgin all who suffe: 
shipwreck, and any Greeks they meet with driven on their coasts, in thi 
following manner: having performed the preparatory ceremonies, the; 
strike the head with a club; some say they throw the body down from 
precipice. ... The Tauri themselves say that this deity to whom the; 
sacrifice is Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon ”’ (ef. Euripides’ Iphigenii 
in Tauris, and Goethe’s Iphigenie). This reputation clung to the region| 
for Tertullian says (Adv. Marcionem 1.1): “ Pontum ferocissimas gente! 
inhabitare, parentum cadayvera cum pecudibus cwsa convivio convorantes.’| 
Nor was the evil fame of the district diminished by) the fact that Hun 
were settled here from the fourth to the sixth century, then Goths, an 
afterward Tartars.

The story of the poem, up to the beginning of our extract, is briefly 
this: St. Matthew was in imminent danger among the Mermedonians, a 
race of cannibals. In this extremity God appears to Andrew, and exhorts 
him to go to Matthew’s assistance, which, after some reluctance, he pre- 
pares to do. 
Bits of translation and interesting comments (not always correct), 
embracing much of our extract, are given by Brooke, Hist. Early Eng.

8 There is no hint of any ex- 
traordinary commotion, much less 
of a storm, in the original. Of all 
this long description there is noth- 
ing except, ‘‘ They were troubled 
because of the sea.’’? Brooke says 
(p. 416): ‘¢The storm is now de- 
scribed in words that come, one 
after another, short, heavy, and 
springing, like the blows of the 
waves, and the gusts of wind. 
We know as we read that the 
writer had seen the thing.’’ 
4 See georran. 
5 Part of Baskervill’s note, in 
his edition, is: “w#do geweette, 
the wet weeds (sails); wet with 
waters, Kemble; waves swelled, 
Grein; replebatur aquis, vadum 
madejiebat, Grimm; wdo ge- 
wette is in apposition with 
strengas.’ Wedo (with short 
z) might be nom. (acc.) plur. of 
wed, sea. But the phrase is 
obscure. 
-6 A peculiar use of standan, 
to indicate motion rather than 
rest. In Mod. Eng. this general weeteregsa stod® wedercandel sweare,? 
wégas grundon, 
strengas gurron,' 
[s7s] 
Pegnas wurdon 
sense is represented by phrases 
like ‘stand back,’ ‘stand off from 
shore,’ ‘stand up,’ ‘stand out,’ 
etc. In OE. poetry, standan 
is frequently used with ege or 
egesa (similarly in ON.); thus 
in Ps. 104. 33 (105. 38), cecidit 
timor eorum super eos: him pwr 
egesa ...stod, where the King 
James version has, the fear of 
them fell upon them. The trans- 
formation of this idiom into stand 
in awe of is interesting. - Note 
that the dative is still retained in 
this quotation, of about a.p. 1880 
(Sir FerumbrasA08): ‘+ Of whame 
men stondeS aye’ [i.e. awe]. 
However, men being eventually 
understood as nom. in such a 
sentence as the last (cf. Towneley 
Mysteries, 305 [ab. 1460]: “TI 
stand great aghe’’), in was sup- 
plied before awe, as in this from 
Lydgate (ab. 1413): ‘+ Of theyre 
lord and god to stande in awen.” 
See New Eng. Dict. s.v. awe. 
The Scandinavian influence in 
Middle English confirmed the 
idiom, and assisted in its devel- 
opment.

CORRESPONDENCES OF OLD ENGLISH AND MODERN 
GERMAN VOWELS. 
Only a selection of the more regular correspondences 
is here given. The student must not be surprised at 
the occurrence of correspondences which he cannot 
reconcile with these; profounder study will usually 
show the reason for the discrepancy. The, great 
majority of instances, however, will be found to fall 
under the following heads. The graphic representa- 
tions of the vowels, not their sounds, is all that is 
here considered, but this will be found of much 
assistance in tracing and fixing cognates.

Before h, and dental consonants

OH GO! RGOR G6 ose. o sv ci aire et ee déor : Tier. 
In tracing back the history of these vowels, many 
correspondences become clearer. Thus, take OE. 6: 
Ger. wu. The Old High German correlative of 6 is 
uo, that is, the one long vowel is diphthongized into 
two short ones. Of these it is the w which has sur- 
vived. If now we consider that the i-umlaut of 6 is 
é, and of Ger. uw is i, we shall better understand 
such a pair as gréne: griin. 
It should be observed that Ger. ei corresponds to 
OE. 4, %, and i, and Ger. aw to OE. & and éa; 
similarly Ger. 0 to OE. o and éa, Ger. wu to OE. u 
and 6, etc. Note, too, that the sound of the vowel 
in Ger. eitel, Haus, corresponds precisely to the Mod. 
Eng. sound into which the OE. vewels of idel, his, 
have respectively developed.

Then Andrew arose early, and went to the sea with his dis- 
ciples, and, when he had gone down to the sea-shore, he saw a 
little boat, and in the boat three men sitting. For the Lord 
had prepared a ship by his own power, and he himself was as 
it were a steersman in the ship; and he brought two angels 
whom he made to seem as men, and they were seated in the 
ship. Andrew, therefore, when he saw the ship and the three 
men in it, rejoiced with very great joy, and, coming to them, 
said, Whither go ye, brethren, with this little ship? And the 
Lord answered and said unto him, We are journeying into the 
country “of the man-eaters. Now Andrew, when he saw Jesus,

knew him not, for Jesus was hiding his godhead, and appearing 
to Andrew as a steersman. Jesus hearing Andrew say, I also 
am going to the country of the man-eaters, saith unto him, 
Every one fleeth from that city, and why go ye thither? Andrew 
answered and said, We have a certain little business to perform 
there, and must needs finish it; if thou canst, do us this kindness 
to carry us to the country of the man-eaters, to which ye also are 
bound. Jesus answered and said unto them, Come. 
And Andrew said, I will make known to thee somewhat, young 
man, before we enter into thy ship. Jesus said, Say what thou 
wilt. Then Andrew said unto him, We have no passage-money to 
give thee, neither have we bread for food. Jesus answered and said 
unto him, Why then do ye depart, seeing that ye neither give us 
passage-money nor have bread for food? Andrew said unto Jesus,

Hearken, brother; think not that because of arrogance we give 
thee not our passage-money, since we are disciples of the good 
God, our Lord Jesus Christ. For he chose us, the twelve, and 
gave us this commandment, saying, As ye go to preach, carry 
neither money on the way, neither bread, nor scrip, nor shoes, 
nor staff, nor two coats. If, therefore, thou wilt do us this kind- 
ness, brother, tell us plainly; if thou wilt not, declare it unto 
us, and we will go and seek for ourselves another ship. Jesus 
answered and said unto Andrew, If this is the commandment 
which ye have received and do keep, enter with all joy into my 
ship; for verily I had rather that ye, the disciples of him who 
is called Jesus, should enter into my ship, than those who give 
me gold and silver; for I am certainly worthy that the apostle 
of the Lord should enter into my ship. Then Andrew answered 
and said, Agree with me, brother, and the Lord give thee glory 
and honor. And Andrew entered into the ship with his disciples,

APPENDIX IV. 
SPECIMENS OF THE DIALECTS. 
The three best sources of information on the OE. 
dialects are Sievers’ OH. Grammar, Biilbring’s Alteng- 
lisches Elementarbuch, and Professor E. M. Brown’s 
work on Mercian. The last is in two parts — (Part I.) 
Die Sprache der Rushworth Glossen (Gottingen, 1891), 
comprising the vowels, and (Part II.) The Language of the 
Rushworth Gloss (Gottingen, 1892), comprising a con- 
tinuation of the vowels, the consonants, and inflection. 
In some respects the non-West Saxon dialects 
agree. These common features, so far as they relate 
to the vowels, have been signalized by Sievers, and 
are here extracted from § 150 of my edition of his 
Grammar : — 
1. In place of the West Saxon % = Germ. 6, West 
Germ. 4, stands the vowel @. 
2. The WS. ie, ie is wanting, and hence the same 
is true of the unstable y, ¥ (i, 1) (19). 
3. The sounds ea, eo (io), as well as their cor- 
responding long diphthongs, are not so accurately 
discriminated as in WS. In Northumbrian especially 
there is great confusion between ea and eo. Kentish 
has a preference for ia and io, the former standing 
as well for WS. ea as for eo. 
4. The sound ec is of more extensive occurrence.

  APPENDIX Lv. 251

1. Cedmon’s Hymn. 
According to Sweet (Oldest English Texts, p. 148), 
“The hymn of Cedmon is written at the top of the 
page [i.e. in the famous Moore MS. of Bede] in a 
smaller hand than that of the List of Kings which 
follows it. It is not impossible that the hymn may 
have been written later than the List [which, accord- 
ing to Sweet, was written ‘most probably in 7377], 
to fill the blank space. But the hand is evidently 
contemporary.” 
The ae is not always joined into a digraph, and 
the signs of length and of i-umlaut (e) are wanting. 
These have been supplied, together with the punctua- 
tion and the division into lines; in other respects the 
manuscript has been followed. 
The translation of the Hymn, as given by Bede 
(Hist. Heel. TV. 24), is as follows, though it should 
be observed that Bede adds, “Hic est sensus, non 
autem ordo ipse verborum que dormiens ille cane- 
bat”: — 
“Nunc laudare debemus auctorem regni celestis, 
potentiam creatoris et consilium illius, facta patris 
gloriz, quomodo ille, cum sit eternus deus, omnium 
miraculorum auctor extitit; qui primo filiis hominum 
cxlum pro culmine tecti, dehinc terram custos humani 
generis omnipotens creavit.” 
With reference to the words, “heben til hrofe,” it 
is interesting that Aleuin (Anglia VII. 7) has, “ut 
primum Creator mundum quasi domum prepararet, et 
post introduceret habitatorem, id est, dominum domus”;

Variations from the EWS. norm are: — ome OKNMIMBAAE . Final -es instead of -es: -riczes, metudes, -cynnes.

Most of the foregoing variations are due either to 
the age of the document, or are common to at least 
two of the non-West Saxon dialects. The only ones 
:

  APPENDIX IV. 253 
that seem peculiarly Northumbrian are 17, 31, and 
possibly 12. Of the rest, 16 and 25 do not agree 
with later Northumbrian (Lind.), and 22 looks not 
unlike Kentish. But 17 has that palatalization of u 
by preceding se which we find in seytir, -sc¥ade, 
seyldor, scyniga, scuia (ui as in druige for dry¥ge), 
and even shya (WS. seiia), of the Lind. Gospels. 
Til, which in Old Norse replaces OE. td, is found 
here and in Lind. Matt. 26. 31, besides being read 
in the Runic inscription on the Ruthwell Cross. 
Foldu resembles the eordu, -o of Lind. Matt. 15. 35, 
27. 45, etc., which is the regular form in these 
Glosses. 
The Hymn is as follows: — 
Na scylun hergan _hefeenrices uard, 
metudes mecti end his mddgidance, 
uere uuldurfadur; sué hé uundra gihues,

2. Bede’s Death Song. 
Of this Sweet says: “Preserved in the St. Gall 
MS. 254, of the ninth century, in the usual conti- 
nental minuscule hand, evidently an accurate copy of 
an Old Northumbrian original.” 
As translated by Cuthbert, his pupil, it runs ;:—

“Ante necessarium exitum ‘prudentior quam opus 
fuerit ne existit, ad cogitandum videlicet, ante- 
quam hine profiscatur anima, quid boni vel mali 
egerit, qualiter post exitum judicanda fuerit.” 
Its variations from EWS. are: — 
1. It has some of the peculiarities of I. 1, such as (1) godes, yfles, 
(2) ni, (3) -feeree, -hyegganne, -ignge, gaste, uuecorthe, 
(8) -snottur-, (15) tharf, (28) there, uuiurthit, thenc-, 
than, tharf, eththa, déoth-, uueorthe. 
Final -a for -e: weppa. 
Final -it for -ed (cf. 35): uuiurthit. 
Final -id for -ed: doémid. 
éi for Ie: néid-. 
€ for ®: thére. 
iu for eo (ie): uuiurthit. 
€o for Ga: déoth-.

11. hin- (otherwise almost always poetical). 
12. egg for eg: -hycgganne. 
3. i for g (ge): -ignge. VIG CRIS _

Of the foregoing only 8 and 13 are unmistakably 
Northumbrian. With déoth- may be compared éoro, 
Lind. Lk., p. 8, 1.15 (cf. Jn. 18. 26); Sostro, Lk. 22. 
1, ete. (15); Gove, Matt. 27. 64, Lk. 14. 8 (cf. Matt. 
10. 15); éoung, Matt. p. 22, 1.15. The igng (for 
gong < gang) is simply an attempt to express the 
palatal ¢ (ge); geong occurs frequently in the Lindis- 
farne Gospels, eight times uncompounded. Rushworth 
has iarw-, but not ieng (p. 253, note 10). At least 
Anglian (North. Mere.) is (9). eppa; as edda (eppa) 
it occurs in Rush. Matt. 5. 18, and in the Riddles 
ascribed to Cynewulf (44. 17).

3. The Day of Judgment. 
The text is taken from Skeat’s edition of Matthew. 
As far as practicable the readings have been con- 
formed to the norms of the Lindisfarne Gospels 
(ca. 950). But as there is often great variation in the 
spelling and endings of the same word, normalizing 
has not been attempted in all cases. Where changes 
have been made, the MS. reading is given in a note. 
The equivalent for Lat. et is nearly always repre- 
sented by a contraction, as is frequently that for vel, 
aut; these have been rendered by the usual words, 
and, odde. The second of two alternative glosses 
has been enclosed in square brackets, and so has 
occasionally a superfluous word. 
Variations from EWS. are (only the more important 
are registered): — 
1. Of 1.1: (5, but not regularly, see foot-notes), (15) alle, -saldes, 
-saldon, (21) meeht, (23) fadores (cf. 24, su); of I. 2: 
(10) gebl@édsad. 
2. Loss of final -n: eatta, drinca, befora, Sende.

II. Mercian. 
Mercian has been thus characterized by Brown (ut 
supra, Part I., p. 81, with which should be compared 
his Part II., p. 91): — 
“There is naturally much general agreement with 
Northumbrian, since both are Anglian. Variations 
from North. are in some cases approximations to WS., 
but not in all. In certain respects Mercian stands 
quite by itself; in particular — 
“1. OE. stable e [%.e. not e] is usually retained 
in Mercian, yet is more or less frequently changed 
to 2. 
“2. The o-umlaut of a scarcely occurs in WS., and 
not at all in either Kentish or Northumbrian, but is 
well developed in Mercian. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
    260 APPENDIX IV. 
“3. The u-, o-umlaut of e to eo, and of i to ‘io, eo, 
occurs at least more regularly in Mercian than in WS. 
and the other dialects. 
“Tt is true that these peculiarities give no sharp out- 
lines to Mercian, yet they sufficiently characterize it as 
a dialect, and not merely as Northumbrian modified by 
West Saxon scribes, or the reverse.” 
1. The Day of Judgment. 
The text is from Skeat’s edition of Matthew, normal- 
ized like the last. There is a difference of opinion about 
the date of the Gloss. Skeat says (ed. of Mark, p. xii) 
that it may be referred to the latter half of the tenth 
century, Brown (Part I., p. 88) would date it just before 
the decay of Latin studies to which Alfred testifies; the 
latter also infers that its origin was not near the Kentish 
border. The phondlogical and inflectional points of dif- 
ference from both West Saxon and Northumbrian should 
be noted. 
The passage is as follows : — 
And? mi’-py? cymep ponne Sunu*® Monnes in trymme 
his, and alle‘ englas mid hine, ponne® gesitep® on sedle™ 
his prymmes. And gesgmnade® béos beforan him Alle‘

once in the Gospel, and is accord-   ingly restored here; a, too, is more 
likely to occur in proclitics.

influenced.

(Part I., p. 82) is inclined to think that its Mercian 
is that of the region adjoining Kent. Sweet (p. 184) 
refers the gloss to the first half of the ninth century. 
The forms are less varied than in the last. The Latin 
is the Vulgate version, collated with that on which the 
gloss is based. 
The text is: —

The preference for the e-sound (both long and short) 
is, according to Zupitza (Haupt’s Zeitschrift, XXI. 4), 
characteristic of the Kentish dialect. Sievers remarks 
(§ 154) that a distinctive characteristic of Kentish is 
the substitution of e, 6, for y, ¥, and to some extent the 
converse.

In our reproduction of the following pieces, ¢ is 
employed only where it is found in the MSS., in order 
to avoid confusion between the theoretical and the 
MS. e. 
1. Lufa’s Confirmation of her Bequest. 
The will of which this is the concluding portion 
dates from 832. It is printed by Sweet in his Oldest 
English Texts, pp. 446-447, and by Earle, Land Charters, 
pp. 165-166. Earle adds: “This piece is given in 
Thorpe’s Analecta as a specimen of East Anglian; 
but Kemble remarked that Mundlingham is in Kent.” 
Note the e (@) for # (#%), ia (ja) for eo (€0); 
b for f is of course not peculiar to Kentish (1. 1. 30). 
The text is as follows: — 
Ic Luba, Ga3mod Godes siwen, 8as foreewedenan god, 
and Sas elmessan, gesette and gefestnie, ob minem erfe- 
lande et Mundlingham, sém hiium to Cristes cirican; and

2. The Kentish Hymn. 
The Hymn is No. 8 of Grein’s Bibliothek (II. 290- 
291). The text is conformed to that of Kluge in his 
Lesebuch, pp. 111-112.
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 APPENDIX IV. 
To be noted are the io, ia for eo (hiofen, hiafen), 
io for &0, e for w (fegere, Feder, heleda, -fest), % for 
&, i.e. & (bl#tsiad, hr2mig) and for ie (gefl%mdest), 
and especially the e for y (senna, gefelled), and é@ for 
y (alés, geréna). Standard West Saxon vowels are 
also found, and perhaps indicate a West Saxon scribe. 
With respect to consonants, the omission of the mid- 
dle one of three is noted by Zupitza as characteristic 
(enlum). The loss of final d (walden) is found 
elsewhere in Kentish (Zupitza, p. 11); but see also 
Taled4.) Ne (age, neg) for ng (cynine, cyninge; cf. 
pineg-, p. 257, 1. 12) is another mark (Zupitza, p. 13). 
The Hymn is as follows: —

  APPENDIX V. | 
I-UMLAUT ILLUSTRATED FROM GOTHIC. 
The earliest Germanic language represented by exist- 
ing specimens is the Gothic. Much the most consider- 
able part of these specimens consists of fragments of a 
translation of the Bible, or rather of the Bible with 
the exception of the Books of Kings, made by Wulfila 
. less correctly, Ulphilas), a Goth of the fourth century. 
While it would be a serious error to regard Gothic as the 
parent of the other Germanic tongues, it is undoubtedly 
true that in many respects it most nearly represents 
what we may conceive to have been the character of the 
Primitive Germanic language. In particular, the origi- 
nal vowels of stem-gndings and inflectional terminations 
are often extant in Gothic, while by the time of Old 
English they are either lost, or exist in a modified form. 
From what has been said, it is manifest that a compari- 
son of Gothic forms with those of Old English is often 
very instructive. The phenomenon known as i-umlaut, 
for example, becomes much more intelligible through such 
a comparison, as a few illustrations will render evident. 
In the revised version of 2 Cor. 10. 12, the marginal 
reading is, “For we are not bold to judge ourselves 
among’. . . certain of them that commend themselves.” 
The eee has, “ Unte ni gadaursum ddmjan unsis 
silbans,” etc. Here the English word judye is repre-

                                                            sented by the Gothic démjan (pronounced démyan), to 
which corresponds the OE. déman. Again, for OE. 
séc(e)an (114), nerian (116), the Gothic has sdkjan, 
nayan (s changing to r), as in Lk. 19.10: “Qam auk 
sunus mans sdkjan jah nasjan pans fralusanans.” 
According to 103, the ind. pres. 3 sing. of forbéodan 
is forbiet or forbiett. The corresponding Gothic form 
occurs in Lk. 8. 25: “ Hwas siai sa, ei jah windam 
faurbiudip jah watnam?” (Who then is this, that 
he commandeth even the winds and the water(s)?) 
The stem of the Gothic verb faurbiudif is biud-, which 
in OE. is represented by béod-. Umlaut is caused by 
the -~- of the ending -i/, which is sometimes retained in 
OE. as -(e)d, but frequently disappears, according to 23 
and 34. Similarly Gothic fraliusis is represented in 
OE. by forliest, as in Lk. 15. 8, where, for the “if she 
lose one piece” of the English, the Gothic has, “ jabai 
fraliusif dvakmin ainamma.”. Again, take the OE. 
hatan, of which the ind. pres. 8 sing. is h#t(t). Here 
the Gothic infinitive is haitan, and the ind. pres. 3 sing. 
haitis.. Thus, in Lk. 15. 9, “ gahaitis frijondjos” (call- 
eth together her friends). 
In Mk. 1. 16, where our version has net, the OE. has 
nett, and the Gothic nati: “wairpandans nati in marein.” 
The doubling of t is to be accounted for according to 36, 
as the Gothic stem-ending was ja. For OE. cynn the 
Gothic has kuni, as in Mk. 8.12: “ Hwa pata kuni taikn 
sdkeip?” (What would be the OE. representatives of 
taikn and sdkei/?) In Mk. 7. 85, where the OE. has 
“tungan bend,” the Gothic has “bandit tuggons.” 
Many more illustrations might be given, but these will 
no doubt suffice to render the principle clear.

SPECIMENS OF OLD GERMANIC DIALECTS. 
The chief Germanic dialects cognate with the Old 
English are Gothic, Old High German, Old Saxon, Old 
Norse, and Old Frisian (cf. Sievers’ Gram. of OF. 1, 
and my Phonological Investigation of OF.). Of these, 
Gothic is the oldest, and Old Norse and Old Frisian, 
in their present forms, the latest; the others are fairly 
contemporary with Old English. By a comparison of

d below, we gain the Germanic stems ain-, 
st, guest or stranger; siuk-, sick; kwepan, these mst the basic, unitary Germanic language 
say; others will readily be discovered by a little atten- 
tion. In general, the Gothic forms stand nearest to 
the Primitive Germanic, but some Gothic words have 
died out, or are replaced by others in the remaining 
tongues The Germanic forms of many English words 
are given in the Mew English Dictionary, with those of 
the cognate dialects, and in some cases the remoter 
ropean form.

[Though the texts of Old Frisian are of a comparatively late period, 
its grammatical condition fairly entitles it to rank with Old High German 
and Old Saxon. The extract which follows is from a paraphrase of the 
Ten Commandments which serves as a preface to a certain code of laws 
(Richthofen, Friesische Rechtsquellen, pp. 131-132). Frisian is next of kin 
to Old English among the Germanic dialects (Sievers, Gram. 1; Siebs, 
Zur Geschichte der Englisch-Friesischen Sprache, Halle, 1889.]

It is interesting, too, because a considerable part of an OE. poem, the 
Genesis, has been adapted from an Old Saxon original (see Cook and 
Tinker, Select Translations from Old English Poetry, pp. 104-105, 184-185).

of words are those of Early West Saxon, the dialectic or late forms of the

in parenthesis refer to the sections (and subdivisions) of the- Grammar. 
Semicolons are employed to separate different growps of meanings; defi-

HUDSON’S 
SCHOOL SHAKESPEARE 
For School and Home Use 
By HENRY N. HUDSON 
Author of “Life, Art, and Characters of Shakespeare ’ 
Editor of ‘¢'The Harvard Shakespeare,” etc. 
Carefully expurgated, with explan- 
  Revised and enlarged editions of twenty-three play 
atory notes at the bottom of the page, and critical notes at the end of each volume. 
One play in each volume. Square 16mo. Varying in size from 128 to 253 pages. List price of each: cloth, 45 cents; paper, 30 cents. Mailing price of each: cloth, 
so cents; paper, 35 cents. Per set, $10.00.    
     
S an interpreter of Shakespeare and his works Dr. Henry N. 
Hudson occupies an important place in the first rank of Shake- 
spearean scholars. He not only made a close study of the text, 
but, what is more important, gave great attention to the poet’s thought. 
A lover of Shakespeare and a firm believer in the educational value of 
Shakespeare’s works, he aimed at making the characters live. His 
Introductions to the plays are masterpieces of sympathetic and illumi- 
nating criticism, well fitted to supplement Shakespeare’s own writings. 
Many of the best Shakespearean scholars of the last half century have 
cheerfully acknowledged the eminent ability of Dr. Hudson as an inter- 
preter of Shakespeare. Edwin Booth once said that he got more real 
help from the original criticisms and suggestive comments given by 
Dr. Hudson than from any other work on Shakespeare. Sir Henry 
Irving, too, has stated that Dr. Hudson’s cri ms were of greater 
value to him than were those of any other Shakespearean student. The 
list of plays is as follows. 
  A Midsummer Night’s Dream Henry the Fourth, Part I_ Macbeth 
The Merchant of Venice Henry the Fourth, Part II Antony and Cleopatra 
Much Ado about Nothing Henry the Fifih Orhello 
As You Like It Henry the Eighth Cymbeline 
The Tempest Romeo and Fuliet Coriolanus 
King Fohn Fulius Caesar Twelfth Night 
Richard the Second Hamlet The Winter's Tale 
Richard the Third King Lear 
Oxtver Wenprtt Hommes: An edition of any play of Shakespeare to which Dr. Hudson’s name is affixed does not need a line from anybody to recommend it. 
Epwarp Dowprn, Professor of English Literature and Rhetoric. University of Dublin: 
Hudson’s edition takes its place beside the best work of English Shakespeare students.

THE 
BEST ELIZABETHAN PLAYS Edited, with an Introduction, by 
WILLIAM R. THAYER 
611 pages. For introduction, $1.25 
HE selection comprises Zhe Jew of Malta, by Marlowe ; 
The Alchemist, by Ben Jonson; Philaster, by Beaumont 
and Fletcher ; Ze To Noble Kinsmen, by Fletcher and Shakes- 
peare; and Zhe Duchess of Malfi, by Webster. It thus affords 
not only the best specimen of the dramatic work of each of the 
five Elizabethan poets who rank next to Shakespeare, but also a 
general view of the development of English drama from its rise in 
Marlowe to its last strong expression in Webster. This book has 
long been needed, and seems to be unanimously welcomed and 
recommended by the professors of English literature. We present 
as a specimen of their opinions the following letter. 
From Professor ALBERT S. COOK of Yale University. 
NEw Haven, May 17, 1890. 
Dear Sirs: You have done well in bringing out Thayer’s edition of 
“The Best Elizabethan Plays.” It will naturally be the book first 
resorted to by those who have gained some familiarity with Shakes- 
peare, and who wish to compare and contrast him with his great, 
though lesser, rivals. It is to this edition they will turn, because they 
can nowhere else find the same masterpieces, or so large a number of 
equally fine ones, in so cheap, convenient, and well-printed a volume, 
undisfigured by the coarseness of expression which occasionally sullied 
the pages of the original editions, and which we are less willing than 
the Elizabethans to condone, in view of the vigor and high imagination 
in which the dramas of this period abound. 
Very truly yours, 
Messrs. GINN & CoMPANY. ALBERT S. COOK.

D PREFACE 
The text is organized into three parts, as may be seen 
from a glance at the table of contents. Part I presents 
such aspects of the philosophy of education and such con- 
cepts of the modern school and its essentials as are neces- 
sary to provide the teacher with the essential background 
for working understandingly in the socialized school. 
Part II sets forth the nature of the work in such a school, 
showing how it may be effectively and adequately moti- 
vated. The major types of teaching procedures are defined 
and the principles governing their use are explained and 
illustrated, for the purpose of showing the teacher how to 
_ organize his class in a way that will secure growth through 
the normal activities of children working in a natural, 
educative environment. Part III is concerned with the 
various phases of teaching procedure which, when thor- 
oughly understood and practiced, produce a school which 
operates with economy and efficiency in promoting the 
education and socialization of children. 
Our aim has been to answer very concretely by abundant 
illustrations drawn from the actual classroom experiences 
of the best teachers those few basic questions which must 
be answered in keeping with the latest scholarship and the 
best practices. Such a basis of understanding is essential 
before any teacher may go about her daily tasks rationally 
and with justifiable hope of working originally and inde- 
pendently with her pupils toward creative ends. 
With the broader training now possessed by teachers,

they need less guidance concerning routine matters and 
fewer directions in regard to the details of teaching pro- 
cedure. Textbooks for guiding teachers must in the future 
find justification in their ability to help the teacher (x) to 
keep abreast of the latest scholarship which may bring 
improved teaching, (2) to see her daily tasks with clearer 
perspective and in their largest educative aspects, and (3) 
to proceed with. confidence in socializing her work. This 
text definitely seeks to help the teacher to an enlarged 
grasp and solution of her daily detailed tasks. 
For the point of view presented in this book, and particu- 
larly for its tested value, the authors are heavily indebted 
to hundreds of teachers with whom they have worked in 
supervisory and instructional relations. Nothing has been 
presented which was not first subjected to the criticism of 
many classes of students and teachers in teacher-training 
classes at the University of California, the Emporia Kansas 
Teachers College and at other institutions where the authors 
have taught. 
What is presented has also survived the severer test of 
actual use by well-trained teachers in many of the most 
progressive classrooms of the United States. The teachers 
in the public schools of Berkeley, California, especially in 
the University Elementary School of Berkeley, and in the 
training school of the Emporia Kansas Teachers College, 
have aided greatly in testing and improving the procedures 
advocated and the results achieved through their use. 
Our general indebtedness to writers on modern education 
and in fields tributary thereto is so great that adequate 
acknowledgment would require the listing of many names 
here. Where the obligation is specific due credit has been 
given in the proper place in the text.

  PART I 
THE BACKGROUND OF MODERN CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 
CHAPTER I 
The Need of a Clear Conception of the School’s Work 
No one can undertake successfully to do anything until 
the thing to be done—the result to be accomplished—is 
clearly and definitely in mind.) This is true whether the 
task be a simple one, such a5 preparing a meal or making 
a suit of clothes, or a complex one, such as building a state 
capitol building, drafting a state constitution, or establish- 
ing a sound financial system for the nation. 
In order to be certain that the arrangements for a dinner 
will result satisfactorily, the one in charge must know before 
planning it how many are to be served and whether the 
meal is to be a simple family dinner or one at which guests 
are to be entertained. If guests are present, the intimacy of 
the guests with the family is important, also, in determining 
how formal the table appointments and the manner of serv- 
ing shall be. These and all other details, even the most minor, 
are determined by the particular purpose of the meal. 
Likewise, before one’s tailor can advise regarding the cloth 
to be selected or the style to be used in a suit of clothes, he 
must know the use his customer expects to make of the suit 
he is ordering. All of the details of pattern, style, and finish 
will vary according to whether the suit is to be used for busi- 
ness purposes or for formal social functions.

2 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
It is evident that the more complex a task is, and the 
more permanent the result sought, the more important it 
is to define clearly just the result to be produced before 
any permanent work is done. A given amount of stone 
and other building materials may be so combined as to 
produce either a palatial residence, a beautiful cathedral, 
or a well appointed state capitol building. Before the pro- 
fessional knowledge and skill of the architect can be brought 
into successful play, however, he must determine exactly 
what he is to build and the purposes the building is to serve. 
From a detailed knowledge of what the building is to be 
used for, he can solve all questions of size, arrangement, and 
appointment. The exact ends to be served are correspond- 
ingly important in developing plans for satisfactorily solving 
problems in the fields of finance and statesmanship. 
Although, strictly speaking, a task should not be under- 
taken until the result to be produced is clearly defined, it 
is surprising to notice how many persons go about their 
work with only vague objectives in view. The writer was 
an intimate witness to the ups and downs attending the 
efforts of a brilliant young man who patented an article of 
furniture and immediately opened a plant for its manu- 
facture, before he knew in any thorough way the needs and 
problems of operating a furniture factory. One important 
reason why some pupils prepare their lessons so poorly is 
that they do not define their problems definitely. They do 
not determine upon beginning work just what is to be done. 
Instead of analyzing into definite points and problems just 
what is to be mastered, and reading to find specific and 
definite help on these problems, they open their books and 
begin to read in a “browsing” sort of way. 
If a clear understanding of the results to be secured is 
so necessary in doing even the simplest things, how much 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  THE SCHOOL’S WORK 3 
more important must it be to conceive clearly the ends to 
be attained through the elaborate process of education. 
The problem of defining these ends is rendered complex and 
difficult by reason of the fact that the process of education 
extends over many years of the child’s life. The problem 
is further complicated by the growth changes and the 
changes from other causes which take place in the child 
during the period of his school training. But because sev- 
eral different teachers will help in the child’s education 
before it is completed, it is very necessary that each have 
a clear understanding of the results public education should 
secure, so that every teacher who tries to aid in the child’s 
education may be aiming for the same results. 
It is evident, of course, that an institution so extensive 
and so expensive as the public schools could never have 
been established, nor could it have continued to exist, 
except for the fact that the public believes it can accom- 
plish certain necessary results in children better than they 
could be secured otherwise. For no other reason than that 
society wants these desirable results secured, is our public 
school system maintained and supported. Even where the 
schools are poor and the results less desirable than elsewhere, 
the people continue to support them because of the service 
they render. Poor schools can be improved and good ones 
made still better only by placing in charge of educa- 
tion in each type of system men and women who have a 
clearer vision of the results to be secured. 
What, then, are the results which our educational leaders 
believe the public schools should produce? In other words, 
what are the abilities which modern education is expected 
to develop, or which are expected to be greater than they 
would be if no formal education were provided? Stated 
still differently, what are the desirable effects in the lives
-P-A-G-E-10

of children which successful teaching may be expected to 
produce? Before anyone attempts to teach school, he should 
be able to answer in a way that is at least tentatively satis- 
factory all of these questions. His answers will constitute 
his statement of what he expects to accomplish through his 
teaching. In the light of what he expects to do, he can go 
about planning all the details of organizing his school, 
directing the various activities of the school, and teaching 
the various lines of work. 
The chapters of this book attempt to give a simple and 
definite statement of the answer which modern educational 
thought offers to these questions, and to discuss the ways 
and means whereby the school may secure the results it is 
expected to produce. 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
CHAPTER II 
The Objectives of Modern Education 
Near the close of the preceding chapter some fundamental 
questions were raised. This chapter will try to answer 
those questions so that we may have a basis for treating 
the problems that follow in the later chapters. 
We find at the outset that it is not easy to give a simple, 
clear, definite answer to these questions. Why can these 
questions not be easily answered? They are difficult to 
answer in the first place because leaders in educational 
thought differ in the terms they use to express the results 
that education should secure. This variety of statement 
may be seen by reading two or three chapters from as many 
different current writers. Such chapters as the following 
will illustrate the point: Chapter I of Butler’s Meaning 
of Education, Chapter I of Charters’ Method of Teaching, 
and Chapter I of Strayer’s Teaching Process. 
In the second place certain effects of education appearing 
in some children and desirable in all are so intangible that 
it is difficult to find the right words to express them. These 
intangible results are suggested by such expressions as: 
“ability to think with fine discrimination”; “appreciation 
of the subtle meaning and feeling in poetry, music, and 
art”’; “poise and affability in social intercourse’; ‘mastery 
of the graces.” 
It is probable, however, that the desirable results dis- 
cussed above will not be secured by teachers unless they 
5

state them as definitely as possible, and consciously seek to 
secure them. Just as surely as a little salt, a little sugar, 
a little flour, a little water, and a few cherries will not make 
a delicious cherry pie unless a competent cook puts the 
right quantities together in the right fashion; just so surely 
will a little reading, a little writing, and a little arithmetic 
fail to produce in the lives of the children the desired educa- 
tional results unless a mind conscious of the desired ends 
directs the whole process. 
Because it will be a mere accident ir schools secure the 
wished-for results if those results are hazily understood, it 
is necessary to formulate a statement of them. Only to the 
extent to which one has a clear vision of the desired product 
is it possible to gather materials and to plan methods for 
its realization. 
Where shall we first look for the answers to the questions 
raised in the previous chapter? When will the child feel 
the need of the abilities and qualities of personality which 
are improved through education? He will feel the need of 
them when he takes a place in the life and work of the 
community, and it is in the life and work of the community 
that weshallseek to find what theaimsof educationshouldbe. 
The school in which the pupil spends his early years should 
not only provide attractive, profitable work, but through 
this work he should be prepared for the life which follows. 
What, then, are the lines of ability with which the school 
should seek to equip its pupils? That question might be 
answered in various terms, but the most helpful answer for 
our purposes classifies the abilities or the phases of effi- 
ciency with which one should be equipped as: 
{ 1. Good physical development and vigorous health 
2. Necessary equipment for one’s duties and responsibilities 
as a citizen .
-P-A-G-E-13
THE OBJECTIVES OF MODERN EDUCATION 7 
3. YAbility to engage successfully in some occupation—to do 
well some kind of work 
4. The qualifications and disposition to use one’s leisure time 
profitably and wholesomely 
5. Proper moral ideals and standards 
Such an equipment a: the foregoing should enable the 
person possessing it to carry his life duties and responsi- 
bilities with satisfactory efficiency. A person who is so 
equipped may be spoken of as “socially efficient.” The 
five abilities indicated above may be briefly expressed as 
aspects or phases of the total social efficiency which educa- 
tion seeks to produce as follows:   
      
1. Vital or health efficiency 
2. Givic or citizenship efficiency 
' 3. Vocational efficiency 
4. Avocational or leisure efficiency 
5. Moral efficiency 
It will be well at this time to show briefly how essential 
each of these types of efficiency is to every person. 
It seems that it should be accepted without discussion 
that the preparation necessary for the work of the twentieth 
century should include a body sound, healthy, fully devel- 
oped, and in good tone. Until recently, however, schools 
have given almost no attention or merely incidental atten- 
tion to the health of their pupils. It was considered suffi- 
cient to teach those who remained alive and well enough 
to attend school; there was no definite provision for secur- 
ing good health and physical vigor, either among those who 
attended school or among those who stayed away. 
Even before the World War, scientific investigation had 
revealed the startling fact that seventy-five per cent of the 
more than twenty million children in the public schools
-P-A-G-E-14
    8 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
were handicapped by various physical defects. It revealed 
further that this unfortunate condition was largely unneces- 
sary, because proper care would remedy it. In the military 
training camps of 1917 and 1918, intensive attention to the 
matter of health produced wonderful results. After the 
authorities had rejected about thirty-five per cent of the 
men examined under the first selective draft, they found 
many of those accepted below the standard requisite for 
their arduous tasks. Then there came to the men in the 
camps the vaccinations, the visits to the dentist, the hike, 
the drill, and the setting-up exercises. This carefully 
directed, persistent effort to eradicate weaknesses and to 
build up the health, the strength, and the vitality of the 
men resulted in almost unbelievable gains in physical 
efficiency. 
Educators of the United States now recognize that if 
boys and girls are to be prepared adequately for the strenu- 
ous work of the coming years, they must have good health 
during the time of preparation and develop vitality and 
vigor sufficient to withstand the stress and strain of adult 
life. They recognize, too, that it is the business of the state 
to make necessary provision for keeping the pupil at his 
maximum in health and for giving expert attention to the © 
development of his physical powers. 
Only in this way will the largest results come from the 
money expended and from the efforts put forth by in- 
structors. Pupils who are not well are in no condition to 
do mental work. Discomfort or pain deflects nervous energy 
to the part affected so that one cannot give his full energy 
to other work. Want of sleep leaves a tired mind, not alert 
to all of the factors in a problem. Want of proper food 
leaves a weakened mind, unable to follow carefully any 
train of thought. Such conditions in childhood, also, bring
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE OBJECTIVES OF MODERN EDUCATION’ 9 
the pupil to the work of the world with depleted vitality 
and vigor, both mental and physical. As Ruskin long ago 
said, the people “‘themselves are the wealth” of a nation, 
not miles of railway nor innumerable smokestacks. Sup- 
pose we do know how to raise more bushels of corn to the 
acre than our fathers did; of what value is that knowledge 
if our people are too weakened to reason wisely? Knowing, 
then, that physical development and good health are neces- 
sary to the growth of our nation, to its economic advance- 
ment, to its scientific progress, and to its political achieve- 
ment, we know that adequate provision to secure good 
health and physical development is essential to the welfare 
of the nation, to its integrity and to its permanence. 
That everyone who would enjoy life must be able to do 
some kind of work, to pursue some calling, is almost as 
evident as that he must have good health. The majority 
of the children of the public schools must earn their living 
when they become grown. Even those who by some chance 
are free from this necessity will find life attractive only on 
condition that they assume some of its burdens. This fact 
should influence the school in its dealing with the children. 
Education for vocational efficiency falls properly into 
three classes: first, the guidance of each person into the 
life-work he can do best; second, the equipping of each 
with the operative skill needed in his chosen work; and 
third, fthe development of that body of vocational intelli- 
gence required to do his work well. The boy living in the 
mining camp, for instance, is familiar with that occupation, 
but may know little or nothing about any other. The boy 
brought up on the farm knows much about the plowing of 
the earth, of the sowing of the grain, of the cultivation of 
the crops, and of the harvesting of the products, but has 
little knowledge of other occupations than farming. The   
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  ro MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
boy whose home is in the city, on the other hand, may 
have some notion of what factory or office work is like, 
but has no conception of the work carried on in a mining 
camp, or on a farm. Such a knowledge of occupations is 
far too narrow to enable a boy to choose wisely his 
life-work. 
At present the schools are attempting to supplement this 
meagre knowledge of vocational opportunities by giving a 
few commercial and industrial courses. But the possibili- 
ties along this line are much greater than is ordinarily 
realized. The work of such a course should include such 
reading, such observation of industries, and such participa- 
tion in labor as will give the pupils a wide knowledge of 
eccupations. With such preparation, young people will be 
better able to decide between the mine and the factory, 
between the office and the farm. Moreover, such a knowl- 
edge of industrial conditions tends to create sympathy with 
laborers in other fields and an appreciation of their work. 
In addition to developing bodies of knowledge and skill 
of different types, the effort should be made to develop in 
each child aptitudes for particular industries, a disposition 
to work happily toward the accomplishment of some useful 
end, and a social attitude which holds an ideal of construc- 
tion rather than of destruction, and seeks not only to pro- 
cure rights for the individual but at the same time to pro- 
tect the rights of all. 
It is evident that in addition to doing acceptably and well 
some sort of work, every citizen should take an active part 
in the government and in the general affairs which concern 
his town, his county, his state, and his nation. Not only 
should he aim to vote intelligently and to obey the laws 
and the ordinances under which he lives, but as a loyal 
citizen he also should be active in all ways which he thinks
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE OBJECTIVES OF MODERN EDUCATION 11 
will make our institutions more democratic and more help- 
ful to our people. 
If we are to maintain our democratic institutions, our 
coming citizens must grow up with the capacity to under- 
stand the spirit of our laws and with the desire and the will 
to obey them. The public schools must teach and train to 
this end. 
At the same time, our schools must put forth every effort 
to develop in these young citizens independence, initiative, 
and originality—the qualities essential to leadership. As 
far as may be, each citizen should be prepared for leader- 
ship. He may be destined to become a leader in his home, 
in his club, in his church, in his community, in his state, 
or in the nation. Our nation will progress only as in each 
community there are thinking men and women awake to 
every opportunity to improve community and national life. 
The maintaining of the highest standards of government 
in a democracy is dependent upon the largest possible 
development in every citizen of those qualities which are 
essential to following or to leading intelligently. In a 
democracy the government may make such decisions or 
may take such action only as is in harmony with the thought 
and will of the majority. It is necessary then that its citi- 
zens think straight and act wisely. The responsibility for 
equipping the next generation for efficient, democratic citi- 
zenship rests heavily upon the schools. Every educational 
program, therefore, should make careful provision for ful- 
filling this duty in the most concrete and detailed fashion. 
In order to perform satisfactorily the serious work of life 
and the duties of a good citizen, one must have some leisure 
time. We are coming to recognize that the work of the 
world needs to be done joyfully. In consequence, while the 
number of working hours is generally decreasing, the number
-P-A-G-E-18
12 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
of leisure hours is increasing. Whethe. the increased leisure 
time is to be a curse or a blessing depends upon the manner 
of its spending. At one time the operators in a certain 
mining camp found that if they shut down the mine Sun- 
day, they were unable to reach their full output again before 
Wednesday on account of the drunken carousal of Sunday. 
In the interests of health, of efficiency, of morality, and 
even of work, it is highly important that every citizen spend 
his leisure time wisely. 
In order that one may spend his spare time in such a 
way that the results will be beneficial, a certain mental 
equipment is necessary. This means that the school should 
develop in each pupil such standards and prejudices as will 
lead him to choose only acceptable and wholesome recre- 
ation. His ideal must be that of a nobler self, so clean, 
so fair-minded, and so void of littleness that all that is 
unclean, or unfair, or mean is repugnant. He should have 
not only these ideals and feelings which strongly influence 
him, but also such intellectual interests and physical and so- 
cial activities, that whether alone or in the presence of others, 
he may never be without the means of entertaining himself. 
The ear has only to become accustomed to good music to 
care for the best and to reject the bad. Usually an eye 
trained to appreciate color and form is sufficient to make 
one enjoy all outdoors. Indeed, the field of leisure interests 
is extensive. It includes activities which are physical, in- 
tellectual, social, esthetic, and ethical. 
Professor Bobbitt suggests the following leisure interests:   
      
Conservation, observation of men and things, construction and 
operation of things, hobbies, sports, games, athletics, reading, 
travel, music, painting; scientific experimentation prompted by 
interest in science; the reading of history, economics, philosophy, 
science, foreign languages, mathematics, and technology, when
-P-A-G-E-19
THE OBJECTIVES OF MODERN EDUCATION 13 
prompted by love of the subject and delight in the intellectual 
experience; religious meditations and philosophic contemplation. 
While provision for training the coming citizen in the 
right use of his leisure time should be adequate, it must 
not become the excuse for retaining that subject matter 
and those activities which are in our course of study merely 
because they have been. The useless and the obsolete must 
go. The public schools, however, must make increasingly 
larger provision for those studies and activities which are 
only. indirectly of commercial value, but which provide 
recreation and add to the joy and zest of living. 
Only men who govern the thoughts and actions of their 
lives by those truths which form the basis of our civilization 
can form a constructive program for the upbuilding of a 
community or the advancement of our nation. The foun- 
dation of America rests upon the inalienable rights of its 
citizens to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. What 
is this but the second commandment, ‘‘Love thy neighbor 
as thyself”? 
The ideals and convictions which underlie all noble 
effort should become the possession of all pupils. They 
must learn what the world has come to consider right and 
wrong. It is well that in their study of literature and his- 
tory they should judge character unprejudiced by their feel- 
ings. It is most desirable that they daily practice righteous- 
ness in their dealings with their associates and in the doing 
of their work. Surely, if they act in this fashion in school, 
they will form right habits of thought and conduct; and 
habits are not easily broken. Probably the most potent 
influence in moral and religious training is the atmosphere 
of the schoolroom. For this the teacher is chiefly respon- 
sible. By her attitude toward her pupils and toward life,  
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
she creates an atmosphere which makes for high-principled 
right-mindedness. If she is scrupulously fair, if she adheres 
to the truth, if she has an understanding of the rights of 
others, there is ample opportunity in her everyday teaching 
and management of her pupils to cultivate their proper 
moral growth. These virtues are indispensable to one who 
is to be an inspiration to others. It is no less necessary that 
a teacher’s thinking be high-minded and pure. The reflex 
effects of the purity and loftiness of one’s thoughts upon 
his personality, and therefore upon all aspects of his effici- 
ency are, as yet, too little appreciated. Teaching must 
seek not only to train pupils in accurate thinking, but also 
in clean, right-minded thinking. In the final analysis, one’s 
ability to think, and the nature of one’s thinking, consti- 
tute the essence of all the effects of one’s education. As 
one ‘‘thinketh in his heart, so is he,” is a universal law 
with many and far-reaching implications. 
If we grant that these types of efficiency are essential to 
the measure of success which all men should strive to attain, 
then what are the permanent possessions the children should 
acquire as a result of their school life? Evidently they 
should have such knowledge, such habits and skills, and 
such attitudes as will enable them to respond effectively to 
the demands of health, of occupation, of pleasure, of citizen- 
ship, of morality, and of religion. 
Knowledge is essential to efficiency in any work. One 
must know what is essential to good health else he may 
undo by reason of his ignorance all that heredity and the 
care of his guardians have done for him. If one is to be 
successful he must possess accurate information for guid- 
ance in his work whether he teaches, practices medicine, 
operates a laundry, or drives an auto truck. Knowledge 
likewise increases the perception of one’s duties as a citizen,
-P-A-G-E-21
THE OBJECTIVES OF MODERN EDUCATION 15 
the pleasure to be derived from leisure moments, and the 
ability to discern the right or wrong in a course of action. 
In the discharge of its function the school, either elementary 
or high, should equip its pupils with large and exact funds 
of knowledge. 
Both experience and scientific studies have shown us that 
most of our knowledge, fortunately, is used without con- 
scious effort. If our fund of knowledge were used con- 
sciously, our thinking would be much slower. Knowledge 
should, therefore, function unconsciously. As far as pos- 
sible, we must reduce our fund of knowledge to the plane 
of habits and skills. To this end the teacher should direct 
a large part of her effort, particularly in the first six grades. 
There the teacher seeks to make automatic the fundamental 
operations in writing, reading, spelling, arithmetic, talking, 
and composing. The greater the field of activities reduced 
to subconscious direction, the larger the energy left free to 
overcome new difficulties, to grasp new problems. Accord- 
ing to Professor James, ‘‘ninety-nine one-hundredths of any 
act or thing that one may be doing at any time is performed 
automatically, by reason of the habits and skills which he 
has built up out of his past experience.” i 
If one would be efficient in his work, he needs not only 
adequate knowledge and the corresponding and appropriate 
body of habits and skills, but even more than these, he 
needs a wholesome right attitude toward his work. The 
right attitude toward work requires that one find joy in the 
work itself, that one’s primary interest be in the work rather 
than in the salary, and that one be persevering and con- 
scientious in carrying it forward. One who is dependable 
and upstanding, who differentiates as to values, discerns 
the right and wrong, and considers the welfare of others 
usually finds that these characteristics bring ample reward.

  16 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
In the light of the foregoing statement of the results 
education should produce, it seems clear that these objec- 
tives should be constantly before all who have to do with 
the shaping and the execution of educational programs. 
These objectives must guide boards of education and their 
expert advisers in providing the physical equipment of 
schools, such as grounds and buildings. They must guide 
the superintendent of schools, the supervisory staff, and the 
teaching force, in deciding upon the curricula. They must 
guide all educators in the development of methods of man- 
agement and of teaching, and in the detailed execution of 
each type of work in all grades and departments of the 
schools. How these objectives operate to determine con- 
cretely all the details of school plans and procedures and the 
execution of the same, even to the making of assignments 
and the conducting of class exercises, will be presented in 
the following chapters.
-P-A-G-E-23
CHAPTER III 
The Essentials of a Good School . 
Before any sort of business or enterprise may begin work, 
those things essential in producing the results desired must 
be determined and provided. A railway system must have 
a roadbed, rolling stock, customers to be served, and a corps 
of expert workmen and officers before it can produce the 
results for which it exists. A bank must have a suitable 
building properly equipped, a publicneeding itsservices, cap- 
ital, and expert directing heads if it is to succeed. So, also, 
must a factory,a farm, or a dairy be provided with the essen- 
tials peculiar to the work of each before success is possible. 
A school is no exception to the rule just stated. Indeed, 
it is an excellent illustration of the fact that in any enter- 
prise those things must first be determined which are essen- 
tial to securing the results for which it is to be responsible, 
as set forth in the preceding chapter. 
Before taking up a detailed discussion of any phase of 
classroom practice, it will be well to note briefly the various 
essentials which are employed by the school in its effort to 
realize the objectives of education. This brief notation will 
aid us in keeping a well-balanced view of the entire round 
of the school’s educative efforts. It is through the proper 
co6peration and the right blending of these agencies that 
the work of the school moves forward with certainty, 
economy, and efficiency in the promotion of the thorough 
education of America’s children.

18 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
The essentials in a school have been variously stated by 
different writers on education; but for our purposes they 
consist of seven, as follows: 
1. The school plant and its permanent fixtures 
2. The courses of study and syllabi, which direct what shall 
be taught and indicate the emphasis desired 
3. The textbooks, books of reference, and other supplementary 
books. 
4. The instructional supplies and equipment 
5. The establishment and maintenance of harmonious, 
mutual relationships 
6. The school’s standards of conduct and educational attain- 
ment 
7. The instructional staff 
We shall next consider the relation of each essential to 
the work of the school. The purpose here does not make it 
desirable to elaborate each essential in detail. It is only 
necessary to discuss each sufficiently to show its place in 
relation to the requirements of the school as a whole. 
It is evident, when considered fundamentally, that the 
school plant, with its grounds, buildings, and equipment, is 
not merely the place where the school does its work. It is 
a vital means or agency in the educative process. If prop- 
erly managed, it contributes greatly to the successful work- 
ing of the school. 
In the first place, the school plant should be properly 
located. The location chosen should be easily accessible to 
the community to be served. Other things being equal, a 
central location is desirable. Obstacles to safe access, such 
as streams, and railroad and street-car tracks, should be 
avoided if possible in the location of the school plant. If 
the school can be reached with ease and safety, problems 
of attendance are fewer. The school is also more apt to be
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD SCHOOL 19 
used and visited by parents, hence the relationships between 
the school and the community are increased with great 
gains to the school’s efficiency. The location chosen should 
be free from distracting noises and objectionable odors. 
The site should be in a healthy, wholesome environment, 
and as much attention as possible should be paid to secur- 
ing a beautiful setting and an inspiring outlook. 
In the second place, the school building should be so con- 
structed and appointed that it provides a hygienic place to 
live and work. Proper provision must, therefore, be made 
for heating, ventilating and lighting the building. Adequate 
provision must also be made for the disposal of sewage. 
In the third place, the building and its equipment must 
be definitely adapted to the use to which they are to be 
put. The kind of school and its correlated community 
activities must be in the minds of those who plan and equip 
the building. Indeed, each room in the building must be 
planned and equipped with reference to its particular use. 
A science room must be very different from a manual train- 
ing room. Moreover, the best plan and the best equipment 
for an elementary school are not suited to the needs of any 
other kind of school. A room which is well suited for the 
use of a third grade would not meet the requirements of a 
good kindergarten room. 
It is evident that if the physical details of a school plant 
are properly worked out, the first essential in operating a 
school economically and effectively has been provided for. 
Indeed, it is not too much to say that the school plant 
supplies the physical basis and background for the mental 
and spiritual development which the school attempts to 
bring to its pupils. 
The second essential of a school is the curriculum. It 
would be difficult to over-emphasize the vital importance
-P-A-G-E-26
20 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
of this essential of the school, as it probably determines to 
a very great extent how the time and energy of both pupils 
and teachers shall be spent. Let us note briefly here the 
more important services rendered in a school or school 
system by the course of study, reserving for detailed treat- 
ment in the next chapter the general curriculum problem. 
The best type of course of study, such as may be found 
in use in the leading city, county, and state systems, sup- 
plies guidance to the teacher in most, if not all, of the class- 
room duties which are to be performed. Such a course of 
study is a real handbook and guide to the teacher. It not 
only indicates the scope to be covered in each subject from 
grade to grade, but also suggests good methods of procedure 
and illustrates the results which should be secured. Ways 
of measuring the progress each child is making are also 
indicated. 
The difference between a good course of study, such as 
has just been described, and a poor one, which tells in the 
briefest way what is to be done, may readily be seen by 
comparing examples of the two types. 
The following quotation, from an arithmetic course of 
study issued in September, 1918, merely tells the work to 
be done by the high fourth grade, giving no suggestions or 
reference to good procedures in teaching: 
I. Reapinc anD Writinc NUMBERS.

denominator may be discovered by inspection. Reduc- 
tion of fractions begun. 
IX. Business Forms. 
Simple personal budget and accounts. 
Note: Keep problems within experience of pupils. 
The next quotation, from an arithmetic course of study for 
the high fourth grade which was issued in July, 1921, tells the 
work to be done and gives helpful suggestions to the teacher: 
Motrtrerication. Teach the remaining facts concerned with 7’s, 
8’s and 9’s.

-P-A-G-E-28
  22 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
The central topic in geography for this grade, Trans- 
portation, suggests the activities in which the number study 
may take its rise, and in which the repetitions for fixing 
facts and processes will be supplied. Among these are: 
Operating a Receiving Depot for Freight. 
Operating a Ticket Office. 
Conducting a Students’ Express Business. 
The operation of a Ticket Office would call for the study of 
mileage rates, and touch upon the method of fixing them. Time 
tables which have distances also, may be used as basis for com- 
puting fares between stations. Tickets may then be sold, and 
change made. 
If a Students’ Express Business is conducted, opportunities 
will be immediately at hand for computation with the 7’s, 8’s, 
and 9’s assigned to the grade; for example, What will be re- 
ceived for delivering 7 suit cases at $.50 each? 9g trunks at 
$z.25 each? 8 loads of furniture at $18 a load? 
Many other matters connected with the “business” will come 
up for consideration: the cost of gasoline and the amount used 
in a day, wages for drivers, rent of office, and the like. 
An activity which will furnish experience in the fundamental 
processes, is Keeping a General Merchandise Store. This activity 
is a broad one, and pupils can watch carefully the prices of 
common foodstuffs, clothing, tools, and other articles. 
Determining the profit or loss in keeping chickens, or rabbits, 
is another activity of value in this year. The following are 
typical problems which may arise: 
If a sack of corn costs $4.50 per sack, a sack of bran $2.50, 
and a sack of scratch feed $4.00, what do they all cost? 
A boy has twelve laying hens. If they lay seven eggs a day, 
how many eggs do they lay in a month? 
If the family uses four eggs a day, and sells the remainder 
at $.42 (or the market price at the time the question is being 
considered), what is the monthly income from the eggs? 
If the feed costs $4.00 a month, what is the profit?   
     
-P-A-G-E-29
THE ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD SCHOOL 23 
Similar marks of difference might be cited between the 
“skeleton” and the “helpful” course of study in all sub- 
jects. The skeleton course usually indicates just the work 
to be covered, as in the first quotation above. Sometimes 
it just states the pages of the adopted textbook to be 
covered from grade to grade, without even listing the topics. 
The helpful course, however, makes clear what work is to 
be covered from grade to grade, what results are expected, 
and what procedures it is best to use. 
In a subject such as language, history, or geography, 
three or four pages are frequently devoted, in the helpful 
course of study, to providing assistance and guidance for 
the busy teacher in order that her methods of teaching may 
be the best known. 
The third essential in the work of a school consists of the 
textbooks, supplementary books, and reference books. The 
textbook is usually the basic book in use in a given subject. 
It is used more than any other book. Each pupil of the 
school should have a copy. Supplementary books may 
be either other textbooks, similar to the adopted one, or 
books treating the same matter in a more complete way. 
Supplementary books of the latter type are usually more 
interesting than the regular textbook. They usually pre- 
sent more concrete matter and more illustrations, and are 
generally written in a good literary style. Reference books 
consist of a dictionary, atlas, encyclopedia, and other 
similar books. 
The vital relation of the book equipment of the school 
to the success of its work is so evident as scarcely to need 
elaboration. Emphasis is placed upon it here because the 
need for supplementary and reference books is so poorly 
met in many schools. This is especially true in rural and 
small town schools. Without these aids, the child’s book 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  24 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
help is limited to his textbook. This generally results in 
a narrow view of the subject and less inspiration in his work. 
How much greater, richer, and more inspiring the child’s 
opportunity is if he has plenty of other books to use along 
with his textbook! The critical period in American history 
(1873-1879) for example, is much better understood by the 
pupil if he can supplement his textbook by access to two 
or three other textbooks, and especially by reading such 
supplementary sources as Fiske’s Critical Period, Wilson’s 
George Washington, and Sparks’ The Men Who Made the 
Nation. The child’s effort in geography to gain ideas of the 
varied conditions on the earth is rendered much easier if, 
in addition to his textbook, he can read interesting volumes 
on travel, food, clothing, and shelter. Illustrations in the 
other subjects similar to those cited in history and geography 
will readily occur to the reader. 
The fourth essential of a good school consists of the 
instructional supplies and equipment from textbooks. Ex- 
cept for purposes of emphasis, the third and fourth essen- 
tials might have been presented as a single need of the 
school. 
In the best appointed schools, a great many valuable aids 
are included in the list of instructional supplies and equip- 
ment. There are globes and maps for use in geography. 
The maps may be political, physical, relief, or picture relief. 
The outline map is much used also. History requires for 
its thorough teaching a corresponding equipment of maps 
and globes, and, in addition, it requires a series of historical 
maps portraying the political changes in the country or 
countries studied. Both geography and history require also 
a great variety of objective and other visual aids in addi- 
tion to those noted, as pictures, models, and stereographs. 
Some valuable films are now available for use also. In sim-
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD SCHOOL 25 
ilar fashion, the equipment essential to teaching thoroughly 
each subject might be indicated. 
The great attention now paid to constructive work in all 
subjects, particularly with the recent emphasis on project 
teaching, makes necessary more laboratory, shop, and work- 
room facilities than formerly. From the kindergarten up 
through the grades, the children must have access to mate- 
rials such as sand, clay, wood, cement, and to necessary 
tools, if the appropriate activities in which they are engaged 
are to be truly helpful in clarifying the ideas gained through 
reading and conversation. 
The modern, properly equipped school presents quite a 
contrast to the older type of school. Whereas the modern 
school is fully supplied with such materials as are indicated 
above, a school which has not kept pace with the progress 
of the times is almost barren of such aids. Some boards 
of education still believe that a school needs no teaching 
aids, so they provide in addition to a bare room and desks 
merely a dictionary, a map of the world, a globe, and, 
perhaps, a primary reading chart. 
The school which is not adequately equipped for the 
various types of work the children are to do is as seriously 
handicapped as a factory or store would be without proper 
equipment. The best work is not possible nor is as much 
work possible without proper equipment.! 
The fifth essential of a good school consists in harmonious, 
helpful relationships within the school, and between the 
school and the community it serves. This is not usually 
listed among the essentials of a successful school. Yet 
every teacher knows it is a very important requisite. 
1 Strayer and Englehardt’s School Inventory Book provides excellent help in making 
up lists of equipment essential in all sorts of work in modern schools. See also 
chapter 14 on “‘The School Plant and Its Equipment,” in The Classroom Teacher, 
a textbook by the same authors.
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
What a great asset it is, does not ordinarily become 
evident until something happens to disturb the fine working 
relations within the school or between the school and the 
community. Sometimes the faculty harmony or the 
school and community relations become strained over the 
location of a new school building or over the school’s effort 
to raise money by giving a play, having a fair, or doing 
some other similar thing. Every teacher has noted the 
deleterious effects upon her school of such a “flurry.” 
Just as a business enterprise thrives and flourishes, if 
there is mutual understanding and confidence between the 
directors and workers in the business and between them 
and the public served, so the work of a school moves for- 
ward more satisfactorily and with larger results if there is 
mutual acquaintance and understanding between the * 
school and the community served. Only when these con- 
ditions exist is there desirable confidence and codperation 
between the school officials and the patrons. If these 
groups are working harmoniously, the attitude of the pupils 
toward the school and its work is helpful, disciplinary 
problems are fewer, and the total progress of the school is 
more satisfactory. 
There are many helpful ways of establishing and main- 
taining desirable relationships between a school and the 
community it serves. Mothers’ clubs and parent-teacher 
organizations have done much good in promoting acquaint- 
ance and codperation between home and school. Visiting 
days and school exhibits enable the school to show the 
good work it is doing with the result that the community’s 
faith in the school increases. Social occasions of any sort 
which promote the mingling of patrons and teachers make 
for the establishment of the desired relationships. After 
all, however, nothing contributes quite so much toward
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD SCHOOL 27 
good school and home relationships as genuine good work 
in the schools, with resulting fine progress and growth 
physically, mentally, and morally on the part of all the 
pupils. Such work in the school, and a cordial, hospitable 
attitude on the part of teachers toward parents is almost 
certain to create and maintain fine relationships between 
the school and the community. 
Satisfactory school standards constitute the sixth essen- 
tial of a modern progressive school. It is evident at once 
that unless proper standards are maintained from grade to 
grade in the various lines of work, the total attainment 
essential to the successful realization of the objectives of 
the school will be impossible. 
The fundamental importance of right standards from one 
stage of progress to the next, until a satisfactory completed 
product is realized in the last stage of production, is more 
evident, perhaps, in industry than in education. In in- 
dustry, the customer orders from the manufacturer a cer- 
tain product which must conform to certain definite, 
standard specifications. If steel rails for a railroad are 
ordered, every detail of measurement and weight per foot 
and chemical composition is specified. Then the manu- 
facturer determines exactly the degree of progress toward 
the finished result which must be achieved at each stage of 
the manufacture of the steel rails. Having determined his 
ultimate goal, and the standard of achievement for each 
stage, he holds every workman rigorously to doing his work 
so that the finished product may meet exactly the standard 
specifications. 
For present purposes, two types of standards will be dis- 
cussed. One has to do with the conduct of pupils and will 
be referred to as the disciplinary standard of the school. 
The other has to do with the attainments of the pupils
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
from grade to grade in the various subjects of study and 
will be referred to as the subject matter achievement 
standard. The importance of reasonably high standards 
of both types to the success of any school is clearly evident. 
The disciplinary standard of any school aims to secure 
such conduct on the part of the pupils as will promote their 
working together in helpful, harmonious relations. This 
standard must be expressed in general, descriptive terms. 
Because it cannot be indicated in terms of definite units of 
measure, we call such a standard qualitative. 
n carrying out the school’s disciplinary standard, it is 
usually necessary to decide what things may be done, what 
may not usually be done with good effect, and what things 
may be done sometimes or under certain circumstances, 
In so far as possible, these decisions should be the vest 
of talks between teacher and students in reference to how 
all should conduct themselves in the interest of the greatest 
good to all. When the conduct standards of the school 
are thus worked out with the students, they understand 
the reason for each regulation. Consequently, every fair- 
minded pupil tries earnestly to help maintain the standard. 
His conduct becomes a matter of fair play and of doing 
what is necessary to successful, harmonious living rather 
than a matter of obeying the arbitrary orders of the teacher 
in authority. 
Subject matter achievement standards, indicating defi- 
nitely the progress which is necessary in each subject from 
grade to grade, are just as indispensable in education as they 
were shown above to be in industry. Just as a purchaser 
does not say to the manufacturer, “I want pretty good 
rails for my railway,” but says, ‘I want rails which are 
exactly according to the specifications I have given you,” 
so those responsible for the results the schools should pro-
-P-A-G-E-35
THE ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD SCHOOL 29 
duce must not rely upon saying to the teachers of various 
grades and subjects, ‘You are expected to produce ‘pretty 
good’ results.” Rather, the results which are necessary 
from grade to grade must be specified as definitely as 
possible. 
In some subjects of the curriculum, it is now possible to 
indicate in quantitative terms just what standard of 
achievement should be attained from grade to grade.! The 
meaning of this statement will be illustrated from the sub- 
jects of handwriting and arithmetic. 
The objective standards for handwriting are shown in the 
following table, which indicates the speed and quality that 
has been set for each school grade in light of experience: 
AYRES HANDWRITING SCALE

Grade TE. IV VV 2VE= Vi. Vil 
Speed in letters per minute 44 55 64 70 76 79 
Quality AQ; 40.50. Sa 58 62 
By counting the letters each pupil writes per minute, the 
teacher can tell at once whether the pupil’s speed of writing 
is up to standard. By comparing the writing of each pupil 
with the standard samples of handwriting appearing in the 
scale, the teacher can readily determine whether a pupil’s 
writing is up to standard in quality. 
The objective standards which have been established in 
1A complete discussion of quantitative standards in subject matter attainment 
would not be in place here. A large list of standardized tests for use in measuring 
the efficiency of pupils may be found at the close of chapter 9 of The Classroom 
Teacher, by Strayer and Englehardt. A feature of each test is a statement of the 
achievement pupils should show from grade to grade.

Also, by testing a large number of children whose ages 
had been recorded, Professor Franzen established the age 
norms included in the next table. 
AGE NORMS

Form I or II 12.00 15.16 18.33 21.50 24.67 27.83 
Finally, another type of score has been developed for the 
same test. This is based upon the value of the score made 
by a pupil as compared with those of others in a group 
sufficiently large to produce a normal distribution of 
scores of pupils of the same age. These scores are to be 
found in the tables by Franzen,! Hamilton, and McNair. 
These various scientifically determined scores may be 
changed slightly when larger numbers of children have been 
tested. For diagnosing causes of error the following table 
for the four fundamentals has been computed from the 
results obtained in the tests:

The above illustrations indicate how we can measure 
scientifically the progress and achievements of children in 
certain subjects. The subject of testing will be dealt with 
at greater length in a later chapter. 
In other subjects such as nature study and literature we 
are compelled to rely upon general descriptive terms to 
indicate the achievement which pupils should make from 
grade to grade and at the conclusion of their study of the 
subject. Scientific experts in the field of educational re- 
search are attempting to devise tests, scales, and standards 
which will apply as accurately to these subjects as the 
tests and scales now in use apply to certain other subjects. 
The seventh essential of a good school is a carefully 
selected staff of adequately trained, professionally minded 
teachers and workers in other capacities. Just as a suc- 
cessful industrial plant must have skilled workmen each 
of whom can do accurately his particular kind of work in 
the plant, so a successful school'must have trained teachers 
and workers, each possessed of all of the essential abilities 
and qualities to secure the results expected of him. 
It is evident, of course, that the staff of teachers and 
other workers is the most important factor in making a 
school or school system successful. Whether each other 
essential of the school accomplishes what it should in the 
education of pupils depends upon the staff of workers. If 
they are skilled and capable in achieving requisite standards 
and in using the other essentials of the school to that end, 
satisfactory results are achieved. 
The blending of the foregoing factors under the skillful 
guidance of the teacher in the work of the school will be 
constantly evident in the chapters which follow. Every 
teacher should frequently “check up” his school with refer- 
ence to the satisfactory operation of these essentials.
-P-A-G-E-39
CHAPTER IV 
The Curriculum of the Modern School 
In the preceding chapter, the curriculum of work as set 
forth in the course of study was designated as the second 
essential of a good school. In that discussion, the need 
and importance of a good course of study were emphasized 
and illustrated. The more thorough and detailed treat- 
ment of the curriculum in its relations to good schoolrbom 
practice was reserved for this chapter. 
The determination of the curriculum for a school system 
is essentially an administrative responsibility. But, be- 
cause the curriculum affects so vitally the work and the 
procedures of every teacher, the authors believe that cer- 
tain basic aspects of the curriculum problem should be 
studied by teachers in their consideration of methods and 
other matters affecting teaching procedures and results. 
Accordingly, those matters of interest and value to the 
teacher will be considered here. An insight into these 
matters will enable teachers to know the work of a good 
curriculum, to appreciate the weaknesses and the reasons 
therefor in an unsatisfactory curriculum, and to take their 
due measure of responsibility in the proper modification and 
constant improvement of the curriculum of the school 
system in which they teach. 
With the above ends in view, certain questions pertaining 
to phases of the curriculum problem will be answered 
briefly but concretely in this chapter. These questions are: 
: 33
-P-A-G-E-40
  34 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
(x) What is a school curriculum? (2) What factors deter- 
mine it when it is rationally developed? (3) What should 
it do for the school it serves? (4) What progress has been 
made in curriculum development in recent years and what 
remains to be done? (5) What is the teacher’s relation to 
the improvement and success of the curriculum? 
- If the teacher has an independent working point of view 
in reference to each of these questions, he will be duly dis- 
criminating and cautious in judging and using the cur- 
riculum in their school system where he teaches. 
(1) What is a school curriculum and what should it do for 
the schools it serves? Webster defines it as ‘“‘a specified 
course of study.’”’ Charles Hughes Johnston says it is “any 
systematic and schematic arrangement of courses which 
extends through a number of years and which is planned 
for any clearly differentiated group of pupils.” 
The foregoing definitions, while serving certain purposes, 
certainly do not, standing alone, define the curriculum, or 
course of study, of a school system in such way as to indi- 
cate its great central place of importance and control. This 
may best be done, it seems to us, by turning to the second 
part of the question we are seeking to answer in this section. 
An indication of what the course of study should do for 
the system it serves will answer in a more concrete, direct, 
and thorough fashion what it is. Knowing what a course 
of study is in terms of the service it should render, will 
enable the teacher to judge it critically for the purpose of 
seeing how it should be supplemented and certain phases 
of its requirements surpassed, and at the same time cause 
him to be concerned that his own efforts shall always con- 
tribute to its improvement. 
The first thing the course of study in any subject should 
do is to point out how that subject may help pupils to be-
-P-A-G-E-41
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL = 35 
come equipped for the duties of life. The value of a sub- 
ject in training for vocation, citizenship, leisure, good. 
health, and morality should be briefly stated in concrete, 
illustrative fashion for the guidance of the teacher. A 
definite set of objectives for realization is the first step in 
good teaching. The modern course of study should defi- 
nitely remind the teacher of the goals to be sought through 
the teaching of each subject. A right start in this matter 
possesses inspirational values for the teacher and aids in ra- 
tionalizing every succeeding phase of the teacher’s procedure. 
Brief quotations from courses of study which give ade- 
quate attention to this matter will illustrate the particular 
quality of a good course of study: which we are stressing 
here. Quotations from courses in home economics, pen- 
manship, geography and nature study will be sufficient for 
this purpose. In each course, the contribution of the sub- 
ject to all of the objectives to which it ministers is fully 
set forth; but the purpose here is fully served by quoting 
from each course the views it presents with reference to 
the relation of the subject to the achievement of one or 
two of the social aims of the school. It seems unnecessary 
to quote from each course the contribution of the subject 
to each of the objectives of education. 
The home economics course says: 
Seeking, then, to aid the development of the child for social 
efficiency, the following objectives hold in teaching home 
economics: 
Health Efficiency: By teaching the relation of food and cloth- 
ing to health; the best care of the human machine; the needs 
of the body and how those needs may best be met through the 
proper choice and preparation of food; the ill effects of im- 
proper choice of food and clothing and of improper preparation 
of food; personal hygiene; household and municipal sanitation.
-P-A-G-E-42
36 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
This quotation is from a penmanship course of study: 
Penmanship contributes to the equipment of the individual 
for efficient social service through providing him with the ability 
to write legibly and rapidly with ease and endurance. The 
ability to write is essential to every individual, that he may 
record his experiences or communicate his ideas and experi- 
ences to others who are absent. It is evident that its contri- 
bution is mainly to vocational, avocational, civic and physical 
efficiency. 
The ability to write is almost indispensable in every occu- 
pation. In the course of one’s daily work, records need to be 
made, memoranda need to be dispatched, and written communi- 
cations need to be interpreted. A prerequisite to securing and 
holding almost any sort of a position is the ability to write 
and to read the writing of others. 
The ability to write equips one with a valuable ability which 
is much needed during leisure. All social correspondence, by 
means of which one keeps in contact with his absent friends, 
is essentially an avocational pursuit. It can hardly be indulged 
in by those who do not possess the ability to write. As one 
goes about his reading for pleasure, he constantly finds need for 
the ability to make notations and to record thoughts and in- 
spirations which arise in the course of reading. As one travels 
and indulges himself in those common means of pleasure and 
recreation, he finds constant need for the ability to write. 
The following quotation from a geography course exem- 
plifies the avocational value of the subject: 
The objectives of good geography teaching relate themselves 
to the general objectives of education specifically as follows: 
Dealing as it does with the relations of mutual interdepend- 
ence between the earth and man and man’s institutions, geogra- 
phy contributes in large ways to the equipment of the individual 
for efficient social service. While it contributes somewhat to all 
phases of social efficiency, its main contribution is to the avoca- 
“tional, vocational, and civic aspects of social efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-43
  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL = 37 
The contribution of geography to avocational efficiency is 
large. It provides equipment enabling one to read the news- 
papers and current magazines with intelligence and pleasure; 
it enables one to contemplate travel and do it with intelligence; 
and it also provides one with a body of interests and ambitions 
which lead to the exploration and appreciation of far-distant 
countries through reading. 
The quotations from the nature study course illustrates 
the moral and civic phases of its value: 
The Moral Aim: 
Through a knowledge of the life of animals and plants, through 
a knowledge of the powers and forces that control our earth, 
the sun, moon, and stars, the child is placed in an understand- 
ing relation with the natural world about. When the nastur- 
tiums or the beans are not watered during a dry spell and are 
found withered the following day, when the pet canary or the 
guinea pig or rabbit has not been fed and watered for a day 
or two and it is found listless and unhappy, the child will 
realize that diligence and care and doing the right thing in time 
are necessary to health and happiness and that carelessness and 
shiftlessness are wrong and result in unhappiness and some- 
times death. The consequences of neglect or wrongdoing will 
be shown concretely. There will be more sympathy and love 
for animals and plants. 
There is nothing that shows a child heedlessness better than 
the careless planting of seeds. If radish seeds are scattered 
unevenly in the furrow or a few are dropped in the space between 
the rows the seeds will sprout exactly where dropped. Thus 
the child comes to realize that it is easier to prevent mistakes 
than to rectify them. 
Through the possession of a private garden patch, or pen of 
rabbits or pigeons, the child’s sense of ownership is aroused. If 
some other child should trample the lettuce or pull out half-a- - 
dozen tender radishes or onions, in the surprise and disappoint- 
ment there will come realization of the respect that each one
-P-A-G-E-44
38 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
owes to the property of others. As a result, another child’s 
garden patch will not be so easily destroyed. 
In employing leisure hours between school dismissal and 
dinner time, to work among plants or pets, the child will be 
kept off the streets and will avoid getting into mischief in the 
neighborhood, and will be learning lessons in patience, diligence, 
steadfastness, and thrift. 
“Through a knowledge of the wonderful things of the 
world, of their mysterious forces, of the why and wherefore 
of it all, leading one to believe in an all-planning and all- 
guiding influence, religious sentiments are aroused.”’— 
Holtz. 
The Civic Aim: 
In the furthering of food production by school children on 
plots of ground considered their own, in the raising of their 
own chickens and rabbits, is aroused a sense of ownership and 
a knowledge and love for the cultivation of the soi]. In the pride 
that comes for one’s very own garden, for one’s very own animals, 
comes a pride in one’s own home surroundings, in neighborhood 
homes, gardens, and animals. This leads in time to improvement 
of a whole community and to better civic conditions. 
“Where agricultural education has been made compul- 
sory in the schools of France and Belgium and in certain 
districts of Illinois and Iowa, the young people are very 
proud of their homes and their farms, and the movement 
of population has been from the cities to the country.”— 
James Ralph Jewell, in Agricultural Nature Study and School 
Gardens, Pulletin No. 2, 1907. 
Through the effort required in cultivating and gathering crops 
and through the knowledge gained of the values of their products 
there will be engendered ideals of thrift and conservation. 
The study of the protection of the natural and native wild 
life of our state public parks, and the study of the sources of 
our water supply and their protection, lead to the realization 
of civic responsibility. '

  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 39 
The second service of the course of study is to indicate 
the total scope of the field to be covered in each subject 
by the grades concerned, and to assign definite portions of 
the total field to each grade. This must be done to enable 
each teacher to understand his definite responsibilities in 
the total undertaking. In performing this function, it will 
add greatly to the teacher’s confidence in the course of 
study if it bears evidence that its directions are made in 
the light of the latest pertinent scientific investigations and 
of the best practices in other leading school systems. 
Any course of study worthy of the name doubtless dis- 
charges this duty in some fashion or other. The most 
modern courses, however, render this service in a very help- 
ful way while others merely assign the duties in a few brief 
sentences. 
How the best type of course of study performs this duty 
will be noted briefly. In the first place, in the assignment 
of work for each grade which is expected to study a given 
subject, the most helpful type of curriculum suggests the 
relative importance of the different topics or phases of the 
subject, and about the amount of time which should be 
devoted to each. Such suggestions are made in view of 
the relative importance in social life and in the achieve- 
ment of the purposes of the school which each topic or 
phase of this subject is judged to possess. For example, a 
good course of study in history, now before the writer, says 
that four to six weeks should be devoted to the constitu- 
tional convention and the adoption of the constitution, 
while it suggests that from one to two weeks should be 
devoted to “The Development of the Northwest Territory.” 
In the second place, the good course of study suggests 
the relationships between topics and phases of the same 
subject, and how to make the transition from one of these
-P-A-G-E-46
  40 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
to another with best results. A course before the writer 
explains the connection which should be maintained in 
teaching the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of 
Confederation, and the Constitution of the United States. 
A sixth grade geography course says: 
The teacher may introduce the study of Africa by accounts 
of the experiences of Roosevelt, Stanley and Livingston on this 
continent. This will interest the children in the difficulty of 
travel, the ignorance of the natives, health conditions, and vege- 
tation. The following activities are suggested: a series of pan- 
tomimes or charades calculated to represent the experiences of 
one traveling in Africa. These might pass across the screen— 
an elephant hunt, finding of a diamond mine, the desert cara- 
vans, lives of the pygmies, etc.   
      
In the third place, a good course of study, in performing 
the second service for which it is responsible, suggests help- 
ful correlations. Bonser! quotes from the experience of 
Blanche E. Campbell to show how literature, language, 
industrial arts, and music make contributions to the fifth 
and sixth grade history assignment. The good course of 
study points out in this way how different subjects may be 
made to supplement each other. 
In the fourth place, in completing the assignment of work 
to be done, the good course of study provides, usually in 
the last year of the course, a logical or scientific outline of 
the subject. This helps to keep before the teacher the rela- 
tion of the various parts or phases of the subject to each 
other. It will probably add also to the thoroughness of the 
pupil’s understanding of the subject if he reviews the whole 
field by such a logical outline, provided it is not made 
obscure by the inclusion of too many details.

-P-A-G-E-47
  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL = 41 
The third service the course of study should render con- 
sists in setting forth in each subject what results are ex- 
pected at the close of the work in each grade. What is 
possible and desirable in this connection was rather fully 
set forth in discussing the sixth essential of a good school 
in the preceding chapter. 
Too much attention can hardly be given by the course 
of study to setting forth very fully and concretely the 
results which are desirable and possible from grade to grade. 
Space devoted to this brings definite, inspirational guidance 
to the teacher. Many of the latest, best courses quote 
extensively from the work of pupils or from teachers’ 
reports in setting forth evidences of the actual results 
achieved under classroom conditions. These courses 
quote, among others, papers written by pupils in English 
classes, summaries prepared by pupils in science and 
nature study classes, and outlines developed in the study 
of history or geography. 
The fourth thing the course of study should do is to 
indicate the procedures in teaching the various phases of 
each subject which may be expected to prove valuable and 
economic. A good course of study provides a large amount 
of helpful guidance to the teacher in planning her daily 
work. 
Most courses of study state in a paragraph or two the 
work each grade is to do in such subiects as history, geog- 
raphy, and nature study. Then, the procedure to be fol- 
lowed in doing the work assigned is suggested. These sug- 
gestions usually occupy several paragraphs or even pages. 
In the best courses, the procedures indicate dealing with 
large units of work rather than with small topics and 
detailed facts. The major problems to be solved, the im- 
portant projects to be executed, and matters to be studied  
-P-A-G-E-48
42 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
merely from the appreciation standpoint, are all definitely 
indicated. 
The following extract from a fourth grade course of study 
in geography illustrates the help a good course provides the 
teacher as to how to go about her work: 
The plan of this grade is to teach world geography through a 
study of things commonly used. This is done by tracing certain 
necessities and luxuries of life to their sources and, wherever the 
opportunity offers, using terms of world geography so that they 
become familiar. 
The things taken up in this grade are the chief things that 
we get outside of the United States. Through the study of the 
diverse products of our state, the children have become informed 
of the conditions under which many of these grow, and are led 
out into the farther regions of the earth. These will not be 
entirely strange to them because of the previous study of the 
lives of little people, i in the third grade. 
The emphasis in the work of the grade will be more largely 
on the map study and distribution of products. The project 
should start in a natural setting, the children be interested in 
the problem of tracing various articles on the breakfast table 
or garments worn by the children, to their original sources. 
Avoid a stereotyped method of procedure which develops into 
a routine very similar for all the articles taken up. Articles in 
common use which may take the children to all parts of the 
world in their study are coffee, cocoanut, dates, sugar, spiceS, 
rice, tropical fruits, silk, pottery, rubber, and hemp. 
Make a collection of various articles from the home about 
which the children would like to learn. This may be developed 
in various ways. Groups of children might set the breakfast 
table, the dinner, and the supper tables with various appro- 
priate articles and then, seated about the table, discuss the 
sources of supplies. 
Make a collection of articles, the sources of which the chil- 
dren would like to know,
-P-A-G-E-49
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL = 43 
Each child may, with the help of the teacher, find out the 
desired information and report to the remainder of the class. 
This may be turned into a game in which, after several repeti- 
tions, each child may try to give information about all the 
articles brought by his playmates. In telling about coffee, for 
example, children should be encouraged to enrich their recita- 
tion by talking of raising of crops and preparation for market. 
They may be made responsible for such questions as “Why 
we do not raise coffee near home?” They may trace the course 
of the ship that brought the coffee to San Francisco back to 
Mexico, the West Indies, Central America, through the Panama 
Canal to Brazil, to islands of the Pacific, and to Java. In this, 
the Pacific Ocean, Panama Canal, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic 
Ocean, equator and tropics, hot belt, shape of the earth as ship 
recedes from view, oceans and islands are touched. 
Other projects related to coffee industry are as follows: 
Collect pictures of coffee-growing and prepare a scrapbook. 
Write letters to coffee merchants for information, and better 
still, visit the coffee plantation by means of the baloptican or 
moving picture. The children should feel free to ask questions 
to be answered by an individual or group who appoint them- 
selves to be responsible for general information. 
Making a moving picture showing the cocoanut from the time 
it grows in the warm countries to the time we break it for the 
table affords an interesting project. 
This could include various scenes: the tree, picking the fruit, 
life on the plantation, uses of the cocoanut for food, houses, 
roofs of houses, dishes, bottles, baskets, curtains, twine, fuel 
and light, soap, sap of vinegar and liquor obtained from cocoa- 
nut. It would include the steamer on the Pacific Ocean, crossing 
the equator to Samoa, with the long, slender trees along the shores. 
Such problems might come up as “ Why the Samoan Islander has 
only one type of house,” leading to finding available materials, etc. 
For appreciation, R. L. Stevenson’s In Foreign Lands and 
selections from his Samoan experiences may be read. This sub- 
ject makes an attractive problem in sandtable construction.

Learning about the home of the date palm. Boxes of Cali- 
fornia dates and foreign dates may be compared, and different 
routes by which each came to our city traced on the map. The 
ship going after the foreign date journeys from San Francisco 
across the Pacific Ocean into the Mediterranean Sea, to the 
Nile River, up the Nile River and by caravan into the desert. 
A study of the life on the Sahara Desert will review the oasis, 
great sandstorms, reason for great heat, length of day and night. 
Other great deserts such as Arabia, Gobi, Great American 
Desert, may be pointed out. Dick in the Desert, by Otis, 
may be read and enjoyed at this time. Chapter from H. H. 
Hudson, The Little Boy Lost. 
A Pageant of Articles 
Groups of children may represent various articles over the 
world and work out some appropriate conversations suggesting 
from where they come and across what waters, leaving the audi- 
ence to guess what they are. 
Transportation Project 
This is one of the most attractive projects for children of this 
age. The way in which it is worked out can be varied according 
to the interest of the children and desired outcomes. Booklets 
may be made in which are collected the various vehicles of trans- 
portation, with a statement below of some of the routes and the 
cargoes which they carry. World maps may be drawn, in which 
the children draw or place the vehicles of transportation loaded 
with articles appropriate to the routes they are following. 
What can we send to our Foreign Cousins? Review of re- 
sources of our state. We have a surplus of some things. What 
are they? Who needs them? Why cannot our cousins raise 
these themselves? Need and dependence of one country upon 
another. 
Pageant of Countries 
Each child may be dressed to represent a country, or some 
article of apparel which is associated with a particular country.

This course devotes over five additional pages to suggest- 
ing how the work of this grade may be done. The discus- 
sion throughout is concrete, reporting what has been suc- 
cessfully done by some teacher or what may profitably be 
attempted. The section on procedures is followed by a 
bibliography of thirty-one references, helpful in the work of 
the grade, and by an equipment list. Seven definite maga- 
zine references occur in the bibliography. The equipment 
list is as follows: 
Sandtable, modeline, crayola, drawing paper, paste, con- 
struction paper, scissors, poster paper for mounting pictures, 
file, twelve-inch globe, map of the world (divisions through 
oceans rather than through continents), National Geographic 
pictures (the land, the water, the air), baloptican and slides, 
stereoscope and stereographs.

Making an Ant’s Nest 
Fill a quart jar or some larger glass receptacle nearly full, 
with the loose soil, ants, and pupe of an ant hill found in the 
garden. If possible, procure a queen ant, which is larger than 
the other ants. Scatter on top of the soil a little sugar, crumbs 
of bread and bits of meat, and small seeds like wheat. Hang 
to the inside of the jar a wad of cotton or cloth or bit of sponge 
kept moistened with water. Cover with a thickly-woven cloth, 
or screw on the cover half way. To prevent the ants from 
escaping to other parts of the room, set the jar on a stone or 
block of wood, in a bowl or deep saucer of water. Cover the 
sides of the jar with a dark cloth to encourage ants to tunnel 
through the soil. To observe, remove this cloth for a short 
while. Note their movements, the use of their feelers, jaws and 
legs, the pupz and how they are carried, the work of tunneling, 
the community life in the nest, their food and what they do 
with it. Discuss the harm done by ants in the home and in 
the gardens, and how best to get rid of them. If they have 
entered the schoolroom or are in the children’s garden, experi- 
ment in using the pastes and powders to get rid of them. Boil- 
ing water or kerosene poured into the nest will kill the ants.

Such illustrations as are used in discussing the various 
lesson types in Part II, may very properly be included in
-P-A-G-E-53
    
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL = 47 
courses of study that wish to suggest good teaching pro- 
cedures. These lesson types should be gathered from the 
best work in the school system by those who are planning 
a course of study in any subject. 
In the light of the foregoing, the curriculum may easily 
be defined in terms of what it should do as: That admin- 
istrative and supervisory device which sets forth (a) the 
value of each subject in realizing the objectives of education, 
(b) the total field to be covered by the subject and the work 
assigned to each grade, (¢) the results, both quantitatively 
and qualitatively expressed, which should be secured from 
grade to grade in teaching each subject, and (d) the pro- 
cedures suggested and recommended for use, grade by grade, 
in teaching the various phases of each subject. This phase 
of a course of study is thus seen to occupy a very controlling 
relation to the school. It probably exercises more far- 
reaching effects in determining what the pupils and teachers 
do, day by day, and with what results, than all other influ- 
ences combined. 
(2) What factors determine a curriculum when it is ration- 
ally developed? Modern educational thought agrees that 
there are two: (a) the wishes and purposes of society, (6) 
the nature and ability of the child for whose benéfit schools 
are established and maintained. We shall discuss briefly 
the relation of each of these two factors to the determination 
of the effective curriculum. 
In Chapter II, we saw that society’s conception of what 
it wishes accomplished determines the objectives of our 
public schools. These objectives have not always been the 
same as they are today. They vary and change as society’s 
conception of its problems and needs change, and as 
society’s ideals and purposes become clarified and extended. 
The wishes and purposes of society as expressed in'the 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  48 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
objectives of public education determine two things of great 
importance in curriculum making: first, what shall be 
taught (giving us the principle of selection in curriculum 
making); second, the relative value which shall be assigned 
to the things taught (giving us the principle of emphasis in 
curriculum construction). The effect of each of these prin- 
ciples, derived from an interpretation of society’s wishes 
and purposes, on the curriculum problem, will now be 
presented. 
The first of the two major factors which determine the 
curricula of schools dictates, then, the selection of the mate- 
rials to be taught and the relative importance of the various 
materials included in accomplishing society’s purpose in 
maintaining public schools. What shall be selected out of 
the total experience of the race for use by schools in the 
education of children in preparation for the duties and 
responsibilities of life is a problem as old as education itself. 
The answer to this problem has varied with each nation 
and with the different periods in the history of each nation. 
The solution of the problem determines for each nation and 
for each period in that nation’s history both what subjects 
shall be taught and what shall be the content of each sub- 
ject included in the school’s course of study. 
How the answer to this problem has changed in American 
educational history will illustrate the point under consider- 
ation. A few “high spots” in the many changes which 
have occurred will be sufficient. In the first New England 
schools, the needs of society which were dependent upon 
schools for their satisfaction were met through the teaching 
of reading and writing. The people wanted all to be taught 
to read so that each could read and interpret the Bible. In 
addition, it was thought necessary that each child should 
learn to write, in order that he might be able to keep simple
-P-A-G-E-55
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 49 
records and write his own letters. Later this New England 
school added music to its curriculum, in order to secure 
better church singing. As time went on, and the area of 
the United States increased until it finally extended from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific, the need increased for teaching 
geography, with the result that it was also added to the 
subjects taught in the schools. The extensive attention now 
given to the teaching of history began at the close of the 
Civil War and was due largely to the desire of the veterans 
of the war to have the memory of their deeds live with 
their children and future generations. Physiology was 
added most generally after it was combined with scientific 
temperance and its teaching demanded by the Womens’ 
Christian Temperance Union. During the last half cen- 
tury, the subjects taught have been rather definitely pre- 
scribed by state legislatures, by means of which the people 
carry into effect their wishes regarding what the public 
schools shall or shall not teach. 
A few years ago, it became apparent that the course of 
study had become overcrowded by the addition of many 
new subjects. As a result, the problem of the curriculum 
assumed a new aspect and became one of selecting with 
greater care than had been exercised previously those 
aspects of each subject which if taught would probably ‘ 
contribute most to fitting each child for the duties of life. 
Since it is impossible to know everything, the problem 
became one of deciding just what things out of all that 
might be taught in each subject should be included because 
of the intrinsic value of each in furthering the child’s equip- 
ment for ‘‘social efficiency.” 
While this new aspect of the problem has been quite 
largely the task of the professional educator rather than of

  50 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
upon the problem came from the dissatisfaction of the 
people with the results the schools were producing. The 
educators attacked the problem by attempting to determine 
what changes should be made in curricula in order to im- 
prove these unsatisfactory results. This action began as a 
measure of self-defense in order that the schools might not 
lose public support and by so doing retrograde. The 
progress made on the problem from this standpoint will be 
sketched when we take up the next question in this chapter. 
The second thing pertaining to curricula which is deter- 
mined by the wishes and purposes of society is the relative 
importance of the things taught in each subject. The 
greater the importance assigned to a subject or a topic by 
society, the greater is the time which schools will tend to 
assign for teaching it, and the greater is the space which 
textbooks will tend to devote to it. 
Both of these tendencies will be carried into effect unless 
more economic ways of meeting the wishes of the people 
are found. What the people always want is a satisfactory 
functional result. They leave it to educational experts to 
determine in school terms the statement of the results 
asked. If educational procedure can discover ways of pro- 
viding the desired results in the same or less time, and 
without increasing the space used in textbooks, the people 
will be satisfied and will also be glad of the savings accom- 
plished. 
This is just what improved procedures in the modern 
school have found ways of doing in such subjects, for 
example, as handwriting, spelling and arithmetic. The 
people are just as insistent as in the past upon satisfactory 
results in these subjects. It is undeniably true, moreover, 
that the results secured by current educational methods are 
far superior to those formerly secured; yet the time devoted
-P-A-G-E-57
  
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL - 51 
to teaching them is relatively much less. These better 
results are secured by reason of two things which char- 
acterize the modern school; first, it determines with much 
greater accuracy than schools formerly did just what should 
be taught in order to secure the results society wants; 
second, the methods used in teaching have been scientifi- 
cally worked out so that they produce, with greater cer- 
tainty and economy than older methods did, the results 
that are demanded. 
The principle of emphasis may add a topic or subject to 
the curriculum or diminish the attention given to a topic 
or subject. The principles of selection and emphasis are 
closely related in their operation. The fact that the people 
want more attention paid to something may lead to its 
selection for entirely new attention or for just more atten- 
tion. For illustration, the World War caused us to study 
the advantages of democratic governments as compared 
with autocratic governments. The increased appreciation 
of our own democracy which resulted has brought an in- 
creased emphasis to the teaching of the essentials of our 
American democracy and their priceless value. In some 
states, prospective teachers must now take a course in civic 
education before certification can be secured. Many new 
textbooks are giving more space than ever before to dis- 
cussing the duties of an American citizen and stressing the 
qualities essential to good citizenship. Similarly, as the 
United States has engaged more and more in foreign trade, 
the teaching of geography has responded to the need of 
teaching more about America’s exchange relations. 
It is also true that a change in the thinking of the people 
on some matter may result in reducing the attention the 
schools have been giving to a particular subject. For 
example, the teaching of German was eliminated from the
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 MODERN METHODS IN ‘TEACHING 
public sckools of some states during the World War. Also, 
owing to the growth of certain points of view regarding 
disease and its cure, much less attention is given by schools 
in general to such teaching. The emphasis is now from the 
positive side of stressing good health and the conditions 
that produce and maintain it. 
Many other illustrations of changes in emphasis which 
have come about in every subject of study will occur to 
the reader. Just as the principle of selection is necessary 
to guide in the choice of right subjects and of the proper 
content in each, so the principle of emphasis is needed to 
insure the proper proportion of attention not only to the 
teaching of each subject but also to the various phases of 
its content. 
At the opening of this section of the chapter, we noted 
that the second factor which determines any curriculum is 
the nature of the child. This factor determines three im- 
portant elements in formulating the course of study in any 
subject: first, the general order of teaching the subject; 
second, the grade placement of the content to be taught in 
the subject; third, the necessity of varying the content to 
be taught in a subject to suit the mental differences in 
pupil groups. 
In planning a course of study, we shall note briefly the 
importance of each of these elements as controlled by the 
nature of the child. 
First, the general order of developing a subject to be 
taught is determined by the mental nature of the learner. 
For example, if it were not for the fact that the child can- 
not master and understand the logical organization of the 
subject of geography, we should teach it so, starting with 
the nebular hypothesis and the relation of the earth to our 
solar system. Next in order, we would teach mathematical,
-P-A-G-E-59
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 53 
physical, and social and commercial geography. We find 
it impossible, however, to teach geography in any such 
order, owing to the child’s lack of capacity to think in any 
such fashion, due, of course, to his lack of appropriate ex- 
perience and from lack of any need for it in his childish 
efforts. The one who teaches and plans a course of study 
in geography is forced, therefore, to discover the order in 
which the subject of geography can be learned with economy 
by beginners in that subject. This order of teaching a sub- 
ject, as dictated by the learner’s needs, is called the psycho- 
logical order of the subject. To continue the geography 
illustration, we find the psychological order for the learner 
begins at practically the closing point of the logical order; 
that is, it begins with the child’s social and economic ex- 
periences at home, whereas the last thing the child learns, 
if it is included at all in his course, is the first thing in the 
logical development of the subject of geography—the theory 
of the origin of our solar system. 
Without further illustration, it may safely be said that 
makers of curricula need to organize the subject matter of 
each course in such a way that the child’s experiences and 
abilities will enable him to learn it with greatest ease and 
economy. The course of study must follow the psycho- 
logical order rather than the logical, in planning the teach- 
ing of a subject. 
Second, the grade in which a particular part or phase of 
each subject may best be taught is determined by the 
child’s way and order of learning. In arithmetic, for ex- 
ample, it is impossible to solve problems, even in simple 
mensuration, until the fundamental processes as applied to 
integers, fractions, and decimals have been mastered. 
Time must be allowed, therefore, in the early grades, to 
enable the child to become proficient in those things which  
-P-A-G-E-60
  54 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
are basic to any topic before assigning it to a particular 
grade for mastery. The grade placement of what is se- 
lected for mastery in each subject is finally determined, 
therefore, by the order in which the learner must master 
the subject and by the time occupied in taking the various 
steps in the psychological order. 
Third, the nature of the child, as it expresses itself in 
varying degrees of ability in the children who attend the 
public schools, requires planning the course of study so that 
it is sufficiently varied in content and difficulty to adapt it 
to the learning ability of each group. Dickson* covers this 
problem of curriculum-making well as follows: 
There is only one way in which the public school can ade- 
ately meet the problem growing out of ability differences in 
groups, and that is through a differentiation of courses of study 
and standards of attainment. \} The person who has lost self- 
confidence has lost the power to use effectively even that ability 
which he has. Let us, then, give the encouragement that comes 
from success in doing tasks commensurate with ability. Instead 
of thinking so much about fitting a child into an established 
curriculum, we must begin to think more about modifying the 
curriculum to fit the needs of the child. Such a policy leads 
inevitably to methods of classification which will meet the vary- 
‘ing capacities of children. Whether for the city, or the town, 
or the rural school, the principle of adjustment remains the 
same; every school, wherever situated, faces the same problem 
and must employ the same general method of solution. 
The general opinion of educators has been that the work of 
the elementary school for at least six grades, and possibly for 
eight, is fundamental and should be required of all pupils alike. 
It is our belief that this conception must change. As a result 
of the compulsory attendance laws, we must now teach many 
children of a type not formerly held in school. As our immi- 
1 Dickson, Mental Tests and the Classroom Teacher, pp. 131 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 55 
gration has increased, our school problems have been multiplied 
by difficulties due to language, customs, ideals, and environ- 
mental influences. We face the fact that our curriculum and 
our time allotments, which were originally formed for a select 
group, are not suited, even in the elementary schools, either to 
the needs or to the abilities of a large proportion of children. 
Fully 20 per cent of the children who enter the first grade 
cannot even under most favorable school conditions be carried 
through the first seven grades of the standard curriculum before 
the age of sixteen years. Our laws require these children to 
stay in school. Most of them carry the red flag of rebellion 
and discontent either openly displayed or furled up inside of a 
life chafing at requirements and longing for that birthday which 
will give them freedom or (in states with part-time laws) partial 
freedom from the bondage of school. 
Are the standard curriculum requirements of the first six or 
seven grades the ones best suited to the educational needs of 
these children for the eight or ten years they are required to 
attend school? This question has not been answered conclu- 
sively. We believe the answer must come, and that it will lead 
us to accept the mastery of a few of the essential features of 
the curriculum in the elementary grades as sufficient to justify 
us in allowing certain children to pass on to the upper grammar 
grades, to the junior high school, and even to the senior high 
school for whatever types of work they can do effectively. 
The above question relates mainly to the adjustment of 
the curriculum from the standpoint of the child whose 
ability does not enable him to keep pace with the regular 
course. The problem of the adjustment of the curriculum 
is just as great for talented, or gifted, pupils. What is done 
to meet their needs adequately is probably of greater sig- 
nificance from the standpoint of the total welfare of society. 
Curricula must, therefore, be developed with the needs 
and welfare of talented children in view, also. From some 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
56 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
standpoints, they are more neglected than any other type 
of child in the school system when we consider their actual 
needs in the interest of growth in keeping with theirabilities.1 
(3). What progress has been made in the scientific deter- 
mination of curriculum content in recent years ard what 
remains to be done? The need in this connection is not to 
present the progress achieved and the work remaining to 
be done in detail; but rather to set forth its essential features. 
The illustrations will be limited to the elementary school 
subjects. A complete compilation of the work done and 
remaining to be done, even in the elementary school sub- 
jects, would require an entire book exceeding this one in 
size. 
The first progressive step in the careful determination of 
curriculum content according to present standards con- 
sisted in the gradual acceptance of the principle that no 
content should be given a place in any subject of study 
which careful investigation failed to show was of real use 
in some important life situation. Stated positively, this 
principle holds that only those things may properly be 
included in the various subjects of the course of study 
which are found in use by people who are reasonably suc- 
cessful in their occupational duties and their life-relation- 
ships. 
In determining the content of the elementary school sub- 
jects, therefore, only those materials should be included, 
out of all which are found to be socially valuable, which 
investigations show are generally used by the rank and file 
1 Quite as important as developing differentiated curricula adapted to different 
ability levels is the use of accurate measures for determining whether each pupil 
is living up to his growth possibilities or not, in view of the opportunities which 
the school provides him. See A. J. Hamilton, “Achievement Testing in the Ele- 
mentary School,” Second Yearbook, Department of Elementary School Principals, 
p. 182 ff.; also see Franzen and Hanlon,
-P-A-G-E-63
  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 57 
of people living and working under varied conditions. In 
other words, it is generally agreed that the elementary 
school subjects should provide those socially valuable mate- 
rials for learning which will be needed for use by approxi- 
mately all of the people. ; 
This point of view was definitely expressed by the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence Committee on Economy of Time 
in their first report of 1915,' as follows: 
The significant problem then is, what can be done in the 
elementary schools of our democracy to secure that degree of 
accomplishment in knowledge, character, and skill essential to 
equip those who finish the elementary schools with an intense 
desire and the training necessary to make the greatest possible 
additional personal growth, and with the disposition and ability 
to contribute to the welfare of society. Society is still depend- 
ing primarily upon the elementary schools to furnish not only 
the tools of knowledge but also those facts, concepts, and prin- 
ciples essential in a democracy to common discussion and to the 
collective consideration of common problems. The training of 
the elementary schools must supply the requisite basis for 
“mutual intercourse, mutual understanding, and mutual sym- 
pathy,” which are absolutely essential to a successful democracy. 
It is from the point of view of insuring that the schools supply 
this common basis for conference and intercourse that the deter- 
mination of the indispensable content for each subject of study 
is of paramount significance. We must determine what the 
absolute essentials are in the equipment of our citizenship, that 
they may discuss and confer on a sufficiently high level to insure 
the progressive evolution of our democratic society. By con- 
centrating our teaching efforts upon these essentials, their thor- 
ough teaching and permanent fixation will be insured in the 
minimum time.

-P-A-G-E-64
  58 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Apparently our leaders in education agree that the function 
of the elementary school is to provide those educational oppor- 
tunities necessary to insure, with the assistance of the other 
institutions of society, the acquisition on the part of the ele- 
mentary school children of such habits, skills, knowledge, ideals, 
and prejudices as must be made the common property of all, 
that each may be an efficient member of a progressive demo- 
cratic society, possessing the power of self-respect and self- 
direction, the capacity and disposition for codperative effort, 
and, if possible, the ability to direct others in positions of respon- 
sibility requiring administrative capacity. 
The acceptance of this principle was a very important 
step, because it supplied the necessary basis for scientific 
studies. The problem of what to teach in the elementary 
school subjects has become one of finding what knowledge, 
skills, and attitudes are being used sufficiently by people 
generally in meeting successfully the duties, responsibilities, 
and opportunities surrounding them in life. Once these 
knowledges, skills,and attitudes are determined, the schools 
are warranted in requiring their acquisition as far as pos- 
sible by all children in the elementary schools. 
The second step in the careful determination of the con- 
tent to be taught in the various See school subjects 
is still in process of being taken. ¥It consists of scientific 
studies, each of which seeks to answer for a given subject 
some phase of the question, “What should be taught in 
this subject?” A satisfactory answer to this question must 
show (a) the knowledge, skills, ideals, standards, appreci- 
ations which the study of the subject should impart to chil- 
dren, in order to train them efficiently for life’s duties and 
responsibilities. It must also show (6) the materials pupils 
should master to acquire the psychological outcome desir- 
able under (a).
-P-A-G-E-65
  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 59 
The technique of conducting these studies need not con- 
cern us here. This varies greatly, of course, as does the 
value of the findings of the studies. Those interested in the 
procedures used will wish to consult the various studies! 
which are available. 
The progress which has been made to date in certain ele- 
mentary school subjects through scientific studies will be 
briefly summarized here in general terms. Teachers and 
others who are working on improving courses of study 
should go directly to these studies or to extended accounts 
thereof? for detailed guidance. 
Very satisfactory progress has been made by Ayres, 
Jones, Cook, O’Shea, Starch, Horn and others in determin- 
ing the content of the word-list in spelling which elementary 
school pupils should master. Studies to extend and im- 
prove this word-list are still under way; but the results to 
date constitute a safe guide in planning a spelling course 
for the elementary schools. 
The results from studies of what should be required in 
penmanship in the elementary schools are quite satisfactory, 
also. Freeman, Koos and others have pointed out the 
quality and speed in penmanship which are desirable in fit- 
ting children to write satisfactorily for social and commer- 
cial purposes. 
What should be taught in arithmetic to equip the rank 
and file of people for their needs in life has been very satis- 
factorily determined by Wilson, Woody, and _ others. 
Courses and texts revised in accordance with these studies 
are certain to equip children with more accurate knowledge 
and better skills in the use of arithmetic than was possible 
1 See Part I of 14, 16, 17, and Part II of 22 Yearbooks of National Society for the 
Study of Education.

-P-A-G-E-66
  60 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
when the desirable and necessary topics and processes 
were “scrambled” with many others which possessed little 
if any life-use value. 
Many studies have been conducted to determine what 
should be taught in order to equip people to speak and 
write with necessary accuracy and reasonable fluency. The 
results to date are fairly satisfactory although not quite so 
conclusive as are the results in spelling, writing and arith- 
metic. Sufficient guidance is provided in these studies, 
however, to facilitate the remaking of the elementary 
courses in language, grammar, and composition along lines 
eliminating many topics and exercises which heretofore have 
consumed considerable time without making the pupils 
much, if any, more proficient in speaking and writing. 
Indeed, such topics and exercises, in the main, tend to inter- 
fere with results rather than to improve them. 
It will be observed that the subjects of spelling, writing, 
arithmetic, and English are concerned almost wholly in the 
elementary schools with developing simple habits and skills 
needed in life situations. It is possible, therefore, to deter- 
mine rather definitely just what must be taught to produce 
these habits and skills. 
The other elementary school subjects are not concerned 
with producing merely these simple habits and skills which 
all must possess in order to live successfully. The problem 
of determining just what they should equip pupils with is, 
therefore, much more difficult. It is possible to live success- 
fully, although not so richly, without any certain, definite 
equipment of knowledge and skills which may be acquired 
from the study, for example, of music, art, and literature. 
Just exactly what the subjects of history, geography, and 
nature study provide which is necessary to successful living, 
it has thus far been impossible to determine definitely.   
     
-P-A-G-E-67
  
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL  6r 
With reference to just what should be taught in the elemen- 
tary school subjects other than the four already discussed, 
only very general progress has been reported. No results 
which are even tentatively final have been determined. 
In the field of social science, history, geography, and 
civics, some valuable guidance is provided in the results 
secured by Bagley, Horn, Rugg, Bassett, and their asso- 
ciates in these investigations. In none of these subjects, 
however, is it possible to say just what material should be 
included to the exclusion of other material. In these sub- 
jects, knowledge and attitudes are much more important 
outcomes than skills. Just what experiences and related 
subject matter are required to produce the necessary out- 
comes to meet life-needs will require much additional re- 
search and extended testing of the results secured. 
The guidance which careful scientific studies of curriculum 
materials would afford is seriously needed in all subjects in 
which the content has not been fundamentally determined. 
Some work has been done in reading! and literature. The 
field has been touched in nature study, physical education, 
home economics, and manual training, but nothing adequate 
orconclusive has been accomplished in these subjects. Music 
and art are in great need of fundamental work upon the 
problem of their curriculum content. 
Three types of curriculum change have taken place in 
those subjects in which scientific studies have led to positive 
conclusions in reference to curriculum content. In the first 
place, those materials and processes which studies show 
were not necessary, have been eliminated. Long lists of 
words have disappeared from spelling curricula, useless 
topics and problems have been dropped from arithmetic, 
1Uhl, W. L., Scientific Determination of the Content of the Elementary School Course 
in Reading.
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
and much non-essential technical matter is no longer taught 
in English courses. 
In the second place, important shifts in emphasis have 
taken place owing to our more correct information today 
in reference to the true value of subject matter in training 
for social service. This is seen in spelling, for example. 
In spelling not only were certain words dropped, but an effort 
was made to find with accuracy what the useful and needed 
words are, and how to teach them with definite precision. In 
arithmetic, also, decimals are taught in connection with 
United States money where their most common and practi- 
cal use occurs. Further, history and civics may well be cited 
in this connection. In these subjects, much more time is now 
given to the study of the problems and issues of modern 
life, while military and political matters, to which a great 
deal of time was formerly devoted, are now definitely 
minimized. 
In the third place, some materials not formerly inftudaa 
in curricula have been added because investigations have 
shown that this knowledge is needed in meeting the duties 
and problems of life. For example, ways of saving and 
investing money receive much more attention now than 
formerly in arithmetic courses. More time is given in 
English than previously to good usage in writing and talk- 
ing. Many additional illustrations of new materials added 
to the content of various subjects in recent years could 
easily be given. The provisions now made for teaching fire- 
prevention, safety, thrift, health and the like are relatively 
new and resulted, in part, at least, from the recent efforts 
to improve curricula. 
Attention to curriculum needs, that pupils may be fitted 
for life’s duties, has thus brought many new types of 
emphasis.
-P-A-G-E-69
  CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 63 
While much remains to be done to render the content of 
the various subjects as useful and valuable in the work of 
the school as it should be, yet good progress has been made 
during the past decade. It is very important, of course, 
that rapid strides should continue to be made in as many 
fields as possible, to the end that all curricula shall be recast 
until they suggest the teaching only of materials and pro- 
cesses of intrinsic social value and use. Only thus can it 
be brought about that the time and energy of pupils will 
be spent upon subjects of undoubted educative value. Not 
only is such a curriculum content productive of larger edu- 
cational results ultimately but it is easier to attract pupils 
to it when they become interested and absorbed in its mas- 
tery. That which possesses intrinsic value has constant 
immediate values for the pupils as they work with it and so 
is much easier to motivate throughout the learning process. 
(4) What is the teacher’s proper relation to the improvement 
and success of the curriculum? We shall consider the teacher’s 
relation to the improvement of the curriculum first. We 
shall then be able to see more clearly how the teacher’s 
success in executing the curriculum is dependent in a large 
way upon his responsibility for promoting its gradual 
growth and improvement. 
Current practice varies widely in amount of help sought 
from classroom teachers in improving the curriculum. It 
will be helpful in discussing this practice to note the two 
extremes in use. One practice, the older and most fre- 
quently used, takes the view that the teacher should have 
little or no responsibility for helping to make or to improve 
the course of study. Those following this practice consider 
that the course of study should be made by the superin- 
tendent of schools and his immediate associates. Another 
practice which has grown in favor, especially during the
-P-A-G-E-70
64 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
last decade, takes the view that the rank and file of the 
teaching staff should sustain a very vital and responsible 
relation to the work of maintaining a modern course of 
study. The school systems which follow this practice 
endeavor to consult as many of their teachers as possible 
on the ever-present problem of improving the curriculum. 
The gains to the course of study which may be expected 
to follow from teacher participation in its remaking become 
apparent when we evaluate the teacher’s varied relations to 
it. The teacher’s constant effort to execute the course com- 
pels him to test and judge it in actual classroom situations. 
Its weaknesses are, therefore, constantly forced upon his 
attention. What he has to do by way of supplementing and 
improving it, in order to adapt it to his various classes with 
a view to securing satisfactory results is always a problem 
with him. He thus comes to know what will work satis- 
factorily in actual situations, and sees the results which are 
possible of attainment with varying groups of pupils. He 
becomes familiar also with those procedures which will 
secure good results without undue expenditure of time and 
effort. 
It seems evident that if the teacher, who is having the 
everyday experiences just mentioned, feels his respon- 
sibility for helping to improve the course of study, he will 
be in a position to offer an abundance of helpful suggestions, 
It is impossible for a group of supervising experts, who may 
visit him and observe his work, to grasp his wealth of ex- 
perience and focus it upon the problem of improving the 
course of study. No, the teacher must function as one of 
the group responsible for the solution of this problem, in 
order that his teaching experience may exercise the influ- 
ence it should. 
Further, the teacher should know while he is having his
-P-A-G-E-71
CURRICULUM OF THE MODERN SCHOOL 65 
experiences that he is expected to remember them and bring 
them to bear in improving the curriculum. Under the stim- 
ulus of such a responsibility, he will interpret his experi- 
ences with greater care and breadth of vision than could 
be expected if he were casually invited later to review his 
experiences and suggest ways of improving the course of 
study. Teaching from day to day under the responsibility 
of judging the value of the program that he is helping to 
execute renders him increasingly thoughtful, and arouses 
his professional pride in his work. 
There can be no doubt that a proper use of the experi- 
ences of the teaching staff in improving the course of study 
produces certain very important results which cannot be 
secured in any other way, so far as our present experience 
reveals. Three results will be noted here. In.thefirst place, 
a better course of study is produced. It is inevitable that 
a plan of making the course of study which supplements 
the experience and ability of the supervisory and adminis- 
trative force with the tested experiences of the teaching 
staff, should secure a better course of study than can be 
produced by the supervisory and administrative group work- 
ing alone. The latter group is rendered no less capable by 
using the help of the teaching staff. On the other hand, it 
is both stimulated and supplemented by the tested experi- 
ence of the teaching staff. In consequence, a course of 
study thus made codperatively will be certain to bear more 
of the marks of a good course. 
In the second place, the carrying of part of the responsi- 
bility tor the course of study develops the teacher, rendering 
him in turn more capable in his work. In order to do such 
work with credit to himself, he must continually read and 
study. He must also consider carefully the relation of cur- 
ricular materials and teaching procedures to the objectives
-P-A-G-E-72
  66 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
of education and the results which must be secured to satisfy 
these objectives. 
In the third place, the teacher who has experienced the 
growth incident upon helping to develop the curriculum, is 
more certain to do his share in executing it well, thus insur- 
ing its successful operation. The fact that the teacher has 
helped to prepare the course of study gives him faith in it. 
He realizes it is the best practical result which could be pro- 
duced with present knowledge. Teachers who have worked 
to produce a curriculum know it and understand its pro- 
visions better, of course. They are, therefore, ready at once 
to put it into effect, so that it is unnecessary for the admin- 
istrative staff to hold a series of explanatory meetings 
before its intelligent use can begin. In fact, when the 
teachers have had large responsibilities in producing a 
course of study, they are proud of it and are anxious to 
demonstrate its excellence. Everybody, therefore, feels 
responsible for its success and goes to work with a will to 
insure its success.

THE NATURE OF MODERN CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 
CHAPTER V 
Socializing School Work 
In Part I, we have set forth the scope and ends of educa- 
tion. The modern conception of the essential factors which 
must be put into practice in realizing the objectives of edu- 
cation has also been discussed. 
Our attention now turns to the classroom where we must 
expect the major results of systematic education to be 
achieved. It matters not how perfectly the desired results 
of education may be conceived nor how carefully the agen- 
cies for achieving them may be worked out in theory, the 
public schools will accomplish little of value unless what 
takes place in the classrooms of the United States operates 
with directness and economy to accomplish those results. 
It is in the classroom that socially serviceable learning 
occurs, with the result that pupils acquire valuable and use- 
ful knowledge, functional habits, and desirable attitudes. 
Thoughtful efforts extending over many years have re- 
sulted in establishing certain effective methods of working 
with pupils in groups or classes. Part IT is concerned with 
presenting concretely the most acceptable classroom pro- 
cedures. The aim will be to make clear the principles to 
be observed in using each type of procedure and to indicate 
the conditions under which it should be used. 
The modern progressive classroom presents many fea- 
tures which stand in marked contrast to those which pre- 
vailed universally but a decade ago. Features which dis-

tinguish the new improved classroom from the older type 
are: (1) more definite objectives, (2) better subject matter, 
(3) improved methods of working and learning, and (4) a 
more desirable spirit. Modifying the efforts of the class- 
room from the older type to the newer results in socializing 
the school’s work. In order to clarify what is meant by 
socializing the school’s efforts, the outstanding contrasts 
between the earlier type of classroom and the socialized 
classroom will be briefly set forth in concrete fashion. 
In the first place, the socialized classroom works with 
directness and with all possible economy toward fitting each 
child to do worthily and with dispatch all of those things 
in life which it may reasonably become his duty to do. In 
the second chapter, it was pointed out that each must en- 
gage in some necessary occupation, perform his duties as a 
citizen, use his leisure profitably and wholesomely, and so 
on. The socialized school, guided by definite knowledge of 
the activities in which one must engage to live efficiently, 
tries to train each child so that he may perform these 
activities as acceptably as possible. 
The type of school which is being superseded by the 
socialized school conceived its responsibilities in more gen- 
eral terms and worked with less definiteness. It assumed 
that a general knowledge of the past and of the earlier 
achievements of the race was sufficient and that one thus 
generally equipped was ready for life’s duties. 
In the second place, the earlier type of school determined 
with less care and accuracy the content to be taught in the 
various subjects of study. Concern was not shown to select 
just the content in each subject which if taught would prob- 
ably be most serviceable to the learner in performing life’s 
activities. Almost any information which was considered 
true might be taught in the proper subject even though
-P-A-G-E-75
  
SOCIALIZING SCHOOL WORK 69 
the learner would seldom, if ever, use it. This point of 
view resulted in the teaching of much which had little 
value as we saw in Chapter IV. Many topics of no use to 
most people were taught in arithmetic. Equally useless 
things were taught in grammar. Efforts were made to 
teach the spelling of hundreds of words which the learners 
would in all probability never write. Many additional illus- 
trations will readily occur to the reader. 
VThe socialized school, however, tries to select the content 
to be mastered in each subject so that only that information 
and those processes are included which the learners should 
acquire to perform satisfactorily the activities which will be 
involved in meeting and discharging life’s duties and respon- 
sibilities. Since the pupils in meeting the needs of their 
school experiences find it necessary merely to solve simple 
problems containing small numbers, integers, and fractions, 
and since a study of the life-needs of mature people shows 
that they also find it necessary to solve only simple prob- 
lems, the socialized classroom feels responsibility only for 
training its pupils to solve simple problems with proper 
speed and accuracy. The common words which the pupils 
need to be able to spell accurately to express their needs 
in writing determine the list of spelling words which they 
try to master. It has been found by scientific investigation 
that a spelling list so determined will easily include all of 
the words which mature people outside of the school use. 
In the matter of grammar, since the great need of pupils 
in school and of people outside of school is ability to express 
themselves orally and in writing with accuracy, and also, 
if possible, with interest, the socialized school places its 
emphasis on these matters rather than on technical defini- 
tions and fine distinctions. 
In the third place, when school work is truly socialized,
-P-A-G-E-76
  7° MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
not only is the content socially valuable, as was illustrated 
above, but this content is mastered in natural, effective 
learning situations. This is quite in contrast with the 
earlier method of securing learning. By the earlier pro- 
cedure, what was to be learned was assigned from a text- 
book. What was learned from day to day depended upon 
what occurred next and next in the text in use. After page 
37 was mastered, 38 was assigned, then 39, and so on. 
The method of assigning work by pages varies as to its 
details, of course. Sometimes it takes the form illustrated 
by the following assignment of a sixth grade geography 
class: 
I want you to read very carefully pages 12 to 14 in your book, 
which deal with the products of Texas. You will notice that 
considerable cotton is grown in Texas. Why? You will also 
notice that practically no cotton is manufactured into cloth in 
Texas. Why? Where is the cotton, which is grown in Texas, 
manufactured? Why? 
‘Such an assignment is very formal and interferes with 
the pupil’s making a natural and unhampered attack. It 
requires the pupils to look up the answers to a few ques- 
tions proposed by the teacher.) Of course, such an assign- 
ment is somewhat better than telling the pupils that they 
are to study pages 12 to 14 and learn all about the products 
of Texas, Either assignment is definite; but it dictates 
the tasks in detail, supplies but small motive for the work 
of the pupils, and limits their opportunities for thinking. 
(The socialized procedure unfolds very differently. The 
work of a class is so developed that the pupils are constantly 
confronted with definite, interesting problems and with real 
needs for information and skills which they do not possess. 
What they try to master from lesson to lesson is determined 
by their successive needs.
-P-A-G-E-77
  SOCIALIZING SCHOOL WORK 71 
This point of view may be illustrated concretely by quot- 
ing from the diary of the geography teacher whose assign- 
ment on the products of Texas has just been cited. This 
diary entry, which follows, was made a year later than the 
one first quoted. It shows well the teacher’s development. 
Her notes recording her experience in teaching the same 
topic in the geography of Texas to another sixth grade class 
read as follows: 
My first effort was to launch the attack, so I said, “We have 
been studying the products of New England and we have seen 
how many things were manufactured there which were grown 
or found in the earth somewhere else. Let us see what we can 
discover about the products of Texas?” The pupils readily sug- 
gested several sources to examine, including their geography 
textbook. After a little preliminary reading one pupil said, “I 
find that cotton is grown in large quantities in Texas, but I 
haven’t found out what is done with it.” Another pupil pres- 
ently volunteered the information that cotton is not manu- 
factured into cloth in Texas. Another suggested that it is 
shipped to the Eastern states to be manufactured; others veri- 
fied this statement by finding similar information in the geog- 
raphy textbook, encyclopedia, and other sources of information. 
Finally a pupil said, “I don’t see why Texas should not have 
her own cotton mills and manufacture her own cotton.” This 
question set the problem for study, and all of the pupils of the 
class went to work to find its solution. 
The teacher’s diary quotes the summary made by the 
class of the results of their work on the problem as follows: 
The reason there are no cotton mills in Texas is because they 
do not have power to operate their mills. There are very few 
rivers. The rivers they do have do not carry a steady volume 
of water. Sometimes there is not enough water to run the mills, 
and at other times there are floods.  
-P-A-G-E-78
    72 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
They could use coal for power, but there are very few coal 
mines in Texas. The coal would be more expensive to ship 
than the cotton. 
Texas is a very good place to raise cattle, and people ought 
to raise cattle instead of putting in cotton mills. 
It takes very many people to work in cotton mills, and being 
a farming state, Texas isn’t very densely populated. 
The machinery would have to be sent a long way to be put 
into the mills, because there are very few, if any, iron mines 
in Texas. 
There are a few cotton mills in the South, but the East still 
ranks ahead. 
The ready-to-wear garments are made in the North and the 
East rather than in the South. For this reason, it is easier to 
have mills in the East than in the South. There are more people 
in the East than in the South to buy the garments. 
It is best to have our cotton mills in the Eastern states and 
have Texas do what she can best do, that is, raise cattle, mules, 
cotton, and farm products. 
In the course of the solution of the problem reported 
above, the members of the class worked very freely and 
were constantly aggressively active. They consulted the 
maps in their texts as well as the larger wall maps. They 
used the various sources of help which were available, such 
as encyclopedias, stereographs, the National Geographic 
Magazine and the like. Many questions were asked by the 
pupils, and various suggestions were made by other pupils, 
in reference to things they should do in solving their 
problems. 
The teacher worked as one of the group throughout their 
study. For example, one pupil, while working on the gen- 
eral problem during the supervised study period, told the 
teacher that he didn’t see why Texas shouldn’t manu- 
facture cotton into cloth, since it would surely cost more
-P-A-G-E-79
  SOCIALIZING SCHOOL WORK 73 
to ship the raw cotton away than to manufacture it. 
“But,” questioned the teacher, ‘““how would the power to 
run the mills be procured?” Thereupon the pupil looked 
for rivers and coal as sources of power, but was forced to 
conclude that such sources of power were wanting or not 
available to a practical extent. This is typical of the sort 
of thing the wise teacher does in most helpfully taking her 
part in aiding her pupils to learn. 
How the teacher relates herself to the pupils when they 
are engaged in study trying to solve an important problem 
is of fundamental consequence in its effect upon the total 
values the pupils should derive from the process. , Having 
successfully launched her pupils upon the study 6f a sig- 
nificant problem in the geography of Texas, the teacher 
related herself to what was going on, with the definite pur- 
pose of deepening interest, extending the study in all profit- 
able ways and insuring fundamental mastery. Her part 
was to ask such questions, make such suggestions, and give 
such guidance as would stimulate each child to do his best 
work on the interesting problem under study. 
How the socialized procedure operates in its details in 
working with varying materials and in different types of 
lessons will be set forth concretely in the chapters which 
follow in Part II. The aim in this chapter, introducing 
Part II, is merely to set forth, in broad outline, the char- 
acteristic features of socialized classroom procedure, leav- 
ing the details peculiar to each type of lesson for treatment 
in the appropriate chapter. 
The illustration from geography shows the socialized pro- 
cedure in securing the results desired when the work origi- 
nates in and is concerned throughout with mastering the 
content of a particular subject. It will be shown in the 
later chapters of this part that the problem under study, 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    74 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
or the project in process of execution, is not always con- 
fined to a single school subject. The problem or project 
may originate in a general school need, such as the need 
of celebrating appropriately Columbus Day or Independ- 
ence Day. Meeting such a general need will cause mate- 
rials to be drawn from history, music and the like, and 
will call for dramatization, good compositions and so on. 
It will thus bring rich motive to the pupils for all the work 
which is drawn from each school subject. Or, the problem 
or project may arise out of a social situation in the com- 
munity in which the school may profitably take a part, as 
the need for beautifying the part of the city from which 
the pupils come by cleaning up unsightly places and doing 
planting for decorative effects. In the successful doing of 
such a task, many subjects would contribute, and all the 
work done in each which was related to the task would be 
richly motivated. It will be clearly set forth that such 
undertakings not only possess large educative values, but 
that they produce the largest results when the socialized 
rather than the formal procedure is employed. 
the fourth place, working toward definite objectives 
through engaging in socially valuable experiences, in the 
course of which useful subject matter is mastered in natural 
learning situations, results in a spirit pervading the school 
and in influences determining the conduct of the pupils 
which are quite different from those present in the older 
and more formal type of classroom. This characteristic is 
a definite result of the features we have just been discussing 
in this chapter. But brief comment is necessary in setting 
forth this fourth distinctive characteristic of the socialized 
classroom. 
The older classroom procedure resulted in a spirit of sub- 
mission to orders and an attitude of conformity in obedi-
-P-A-G-E-81
  SOCIALIZING SCHOOL WORK 15 
ence to the teacher’s directions on the part of pupils. What 
they did and when they did it depended on outside influ- 
ences, usually exerted in the form of disciplinary pressure 
from the teacher. The exact topics to be studied, and the 
precise points to be noted, were dictated by the teacher. 
The pupils worked approximately in concert fashion in 
response to uniform directions or questions. Individual 
initiative was not encouraged, as it upset the appearance 
of orderliness. When the teacher was absent, or not assert- 
ing herself, the pupils ceased all attention to their school 
work, for they were not expected to have interesting prob- 
lems on which each pupil was anxious to work with inde- 
pendent initiative. Most of the class meeting time was 
consumed by the teacher in asking questions to test what 
the pupils had learned from their rather indifferent and 
meaningless efforts to study as directed by the teacher’s 
dictated assignments. During school hours, the pupils sat 
rather primly in straight rows. In fact, sitting quietly, 
looking straight ahead, and listening, or appearing to listen, 
were among the primary results sought. 
‘The procedure in the socialized classroom presents a 
marked contrast to the ways of working which were de- 
scribed in the preceding paragraph. In a socialized situ- 
ation, the first concern is to have work, or undertakings, 
of interest and consequence to each child going on. What 
each child does is not assigned in the sense that it is dic- 
tated. Rather, under the leadership of the teacher, the 
pupils confer on what should be undertaken next, and how. 
As a result of this conference, the next work to be done is 
launched in such a way that each child becomes responsible 
for doing something of interest to him and of value to the 
entire group because of its relation to their total under- 
takings. In the geography lesson above, while the problem
-P-A-G-E-82
a 
76 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
before the class for solution was to discover why Texas did 
not have her own cotton mills, there was no set list of ques- 
tions which each pupil must find the answer to in the order 
of their occurrence. In fact, the pupils in the class went 
about the solution of the problem very much as capable 
mature people might have worked on the same problem. 
Various sources of reference were in use at the same time. 
Some were finding out where Texas got her coal, others 
about the limited and varying water-power, others were 
learning what the people of Texas did instead of manu- 
facturing and why, and so on. 
When pupils are working with a variety of materials, 
each in his own way, they cannot remain in their working 
places in straight rows. A child may be using several 
sources of help at once, such as his geography, some stere- 
ographs, or a magazine. He arranges these so he can look 
from one to the others, using them in conjunction on his 
problem. If the map in his text is insufficient, he may need 
to leave his seat and go to the atlas or to the large wall 
map. If his sources are inadequate, he may go to the 
encyclopedias for information. Indeed, it will often 
happen that a child, while at work, will recall some- 
thing he needs on his problem that he has used in an 
earlier grade, or seen in the library, and he very properly 
goes to get it. As the pupils work, they ask questions 
of the teacher or confer with her for guidance. After 
they have been at work for a brief time, it frequently 
happens that a group of three or four who are working 
along similar lines naturally begin to work together, shar- 
ing their sources and ideas. Often the entire group will 
give their attention to discussing some question that has 
arisen, in order that further study may go forward with 
greater economy and efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-83
SOCIALIZING SCHOOL WORK 17 
During the class meeting period, the pupils bring to- 
gether the various results of the work done by individuals 
and groups, to share them with each other under the general 
oversight of the teacher. They proceed very much as a 
similar group of mature people would help each other. As 
the reports of work done on the general problem are pre- 
sented, questions are asked by both pupils and teacher to 
bring out the relation of the various contributions to the 
solution of the problem. The teacher guides the work by 
suggestions and questions to insure thorough, fundamental 
mastery. Notes are made of matters in doubt or of con- 
clusions which are not well supported. At the appropriate 
time, a summary outline bringing together the various 
points worked out is developed upon the blackboard. 
From this outline and the items noted which need further 
study, the assignment of whatever needs further study is 
agreed upon. Additional study and class meetings continue 
until the undertaking is finished. 
Under such a procedure, the doing of useless, formal 
things is absent. All are busy on matters of significance 
and concern to each pupil. Questions are not asked just 
to test whether some one knows the answer to each. When 
a question is asked, it is because some one needs the infor- 
mation sought. Nor is there any insistence upon the formal 
seating of the class, so long as each gives his attention in 
thoughtful, helpful ways to what is being done. The chil- 
dren are free to speak, asking questions or presenting state- 
ments or illustrations, without the formal direction or con- 
sent of the teacher, so long as the general principle prevails 
that it is neither good manners nor economy for more than 
one person to talk at any given time. 
Problems of discipline scarcely arise when pupils are thus 
engaged in work. Conduct is considered satisfactory if the 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  78 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
pupils work courteously, without confusion and without 
wasting their time. 
The foregoing discussion has considered the four funda- 
mental characteristics of the socialized classroom which 
were noted at the opening of this chapter, and has empha- 
sized the advantages of them over certain characteristics 
which obtain when more formal procedures are established. 
They are as follows: (1) The general and specific objectives 
sought are concrete and definite in the minds of both pupils 
and teachers.(2). Useful, socially valuable subject matter 
only is provided for study and mastery. (3) The pupils 
undertake to do only meaningful tasks and to acquire only 
such knowledge and skills as are needed in solving the prob- 
lems under study and in executing the projects under way. 
They thus work under those conditions which are most fav- 
orable to economic, fundamental mastery. (4) The spirit 
and the discipline among the pupils are similar to the spirit 
and the discipline found in any group where proper courtesy 
and good manners prevail. 
In setting forth the foregoing large, fundamental char- 
acteristics of the socialized classroom, many details of great 
importance in the education and socialization of children 
have been presented in their proper subordinate relation. 
It seems advisable now to bring these into a little greater 
prominence for the convenience of the teacher in checking 
up the extent to which she has succeeded in socializing the 
work of her school. To that end, the following detailed 
tabulation is introduced, throwing into prominence the con- 
trasts between socialized and more formal school work. 
Because of gains which follow from analyzing these con- 
trasts in different ways, the outline provides the means of 
evaluating the two types of procedure from the standpoints 
of pupil, teacher, and the learning process.

CHAPTER VI 
Motivating School Work 
As pointed out in the preceding chapter, an important 
characteristic of the socialized work of the school is the 
appeal it made to the pupils. They attack their work with 
zest. They are aggressively self-active. This fact is mani- 
fested by their fundamental questions, the various sources 
of information which they use, and the many types of inves- 
tigations which they employ. But why does truly socialized 
(socially valuable) work make such an arousing appeal to 
pupils? Why does any worth-while piece of work, or under- 
taking, appeal strongly to the person who does it with eager- 
ness? The answer is—‘‘ Because it is definitely worth-while 
to the doer; because what he is attempting to do promises 
to yield a result which he personally realizes that he needs.” 
( Any school work which is interesting, attractive, and 
appealing to those who do it is commonly referred to, espe- 
cially within the last decade, as ‘‘motivated work.” ) The 
socialized work discussed in the previous chapter was defi- 
nitely motivated work. Indeed, all school work cited for 
illustrative purposes in this book is motivated work, except 
where brief illustrations of other types of work are intro- 
duced for the purpose of contrast. So vital is the adequate 
motivation of the work of pupils to economy and efficiency 
in securing desirable educational results that it seems advis- 
able to devote an entire chapter to this essential of good 
teaching. Accordingly, we shall set forth below: (x) the 
80 3
-P-A-G-E-87
MOTIVATING SCHOOL WORK 81 
meaning of “motivation” as applied especially to school 
work, (2) the importance of motivation, and (3) how the 
otivation of school work may be accomplished. 
In the first place, then, what is meant by motivating 
school work?! Motivating school work consists merely in 
launching and guiding the pupil in his tasks so that he has 
a strong reason throughout his efforts for doing them—a 
reason so strong that it arouses in him a deep desire—yes, 
often, a longing, an anxiety, an eagerness—to do what he 
does. To motivate a pupil’s work—anybody’s work— 
requires merely that he shall see clearly and feel deeply 
that he should do it in order to acquire something he needs 
and should have. 
The simplest~€xperiences of life reveal the requisite con- 
ditions which give rise to motives for effort. A concrete 
illustration will demonstrate our point. When a child first 
gets the idea that he may receive a toy he is anxious to 
have if he writes a good letter to Santa Claus just before 
Christmas, he immediately becomes very anxious to know 
how to write the letter. The moment he ‘“‘becomes very 
anxious,” he has an adequate motive for learning how to 
write the letter. He feels an inner “urge” to try to learn 
what he does not know. He will be certain to complete 
the task if he is reasonably capable of it, provided the 
necessary motivating influences supply sufficient urge until 
it is finished. Motives for the necessary effort must supply 
stimuli until the undertaking is completed. 
(1 a task is a long and difficult one, it may be necessary _—— 
to break it up into many several smaller undertakings for 
the doing of each of which there is an adequate motive.) 
For example, a high school student body, for reasons satis- 
factory to them, set up the goal of earning the necessary 
1See Wilson and Wilson, The Motivation of School Work, chap. 2. 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  82 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
money to pay for the building of a swimming-pool as a part 
of the new gymnasium. It required many months of work, 
and a great variety of efforts, to reach their goal. While 
the original motive supplied stimulus for effort throughout, 
they found it easier to keep up their enthusiasm by reason 
of the fact that to attain their final objective they did‘many 
contributing things for each of which there were strong 
motives aside from the initial motive. These minor under- 
takings consisted of such things as a vaudeville evening in 
which a large part of the student body took part, a scliool 
play presented by the senior class, an evening of music by 
the various music classes and musical organizations of the 
school, and the like. 
2: < - Similarly, i in the education of pupils, large general goals 
requiring considerable time and effort to attain should be 
broken up into smaller intermediate contributing ends, for 
the attainment of each of which there is strong motive. Sa 
For example, the director of a school orchestra arouses in 
each of his pupils the motive to become proficient in playing 
some instrument, and in all of them the motive to become, 
let us assume, the best orchestra the school ever had. Then 
he interposes many intermediate goals of value and interest 
in aiding the achievement of the ultimate goal, such as devel- 
oping programs for special occasions, at which the pupils 
would be pleased to appear and do well. These may be 
school occasions such as school assemblies, class day, and 
commencement, or they may be occasions outside of the 
school such as a civic Christmons program, or a memorial 
service. 
The illustration of writing a letter to Santa Claus helps 
us to understand the meaning of motivation by revealing 
clearly the essential elements which give rise to a motive. 
The elements are of two kinds: intellectual and emotional.
-P-A-G-E-89
MOTIVATING SCHOOL WORK 83 
There was present a realization of need—an intellectual 
element. . Following this, there was a desire to satisfy the 
need—an emotional element. The combination of the two 
results in a motive. If it is sufficiently strong to set aside 
the contending motives for doing other things which are 
always pressing for attention, a decision is reached to at- 
tempt the satisfaction of the need. Action is thus launched 
and work begins. 
In the second place, now, how important is it to find 
ways of adequately motivating the work of pupils in school? 
There is no way to answer this question finally at this time. 
No measures have been taken to determine how much less 
time a class of known ability will require to do a piece of 
work under the influence of adequate motives than they 
would require if such motives were lacking. Nor is it known 
how much more thoroughly pupils learn if urged by ade- 
quate motives. But that there are gains in speed and 
thoroughness when learning isactuated byadequate motives 
is quite evident. 
That adequate motives for effort are a potent force in 
human progress is also rather easy to demonstrate. If we 
seek to understand man’s many achievements during his 
rise from barbarism to civilization, the basic explanation is 
to be found in the great motives which have urged and 
impelled him to persistent action and effort. 
An illustration will make this point clear. Within the 
last century, the handicap of space to intercommunication 
on the earth has been largely removed by means of the 
telegraph, telephone, and wireless. The time required for 
travel has also been greatly reduced by the application of 
greatly increased motive power to the means of travel on 
land and water, and in the air. All regions of the earth 
have been penetrated by explorers—the cold as well as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
84 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
hot, and regions under the surface of the water and the 
earth as well as great heights. Marked progress has like- 
wise been made against the ravages of such dreaded dis- 
eases of man as yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, 
typhoid, tuberculosis, and smallpox. To make this illus- 
tration complete would require the listing of all of man’s 
forward steps and conquests since the days of savagery, 
for each step forward has resulted from his persistent 
efforts under the urge of actuating motives. 
It is evident, of course, that every step of progress has 
cost efforts, strain, struggle, and persistent hard work. If 
we ask why men applied themselves and did these things, 
we find but one adequate explanation—they were urged 
and impelled by those stimulating, inspiring motives which 
arose out of a realization of the need for each conquest 
made. In our own times the persistent urge of imperious 
motives still holds men to the task of trying to complete 
countless unsolved problems. 
/- The importance of adequate motives for effort is evident 
' not only in the great achievements of the race but also in 
the everyday work and affairs of men. They continually 
experience the stimulus and urge of strong motives in the 
work they do. Five large groups of motives will be noted. 
(r) The motive of commercial gain, the desire to acquire 
property, urges men to work hard that they may succeed.) 
With those who amass great wealth, it sometimes seems to 
be the dominant life motive. 
(2) The motive of personal growth stimulates men to great™ 
efforts that they may grow in resourcefulness, forcefulness, 
and power. To attain this end they study and travel at 
great expense, sacrificing time and energy. 
(3) The motives arising out of one’s relationships inspire 
him to put forth efforts to carry worthily his responsibilities
-P-A-G-E-91
  MOTIVATING ne WORK 85 
pout TROO 
to his family, his lodge, his civic associations. / This is a very 
dominating motive, requiring often great sacrifices. Evenlife 
itself may be given in defense of one’s family or his country. 
(4) The motives arising out of our feelings of obligation 
impel us to efforts to achieve something to discharge our 
obligations./ Any worthy alumnus of a college feels obli- 
gated to accomplish something of value in life in order to 
discharge in part the obligation he feels for the contribution 
made by the college to the fulness of his own life. In a 
similar way, we feel impelled so to live and work as to satisfy, 
in some measure, at least, the obligation we feel to the 
Church, and the State. 
(5) Then, finally, there are the great humanitarian mo- 
tives arising ftom the natural tendency of every normal 
human being to serve and to help those in need. /Such 
motives immediately move us to undertake even hazardous 
measures of relief if our fellow men are suffering, or if human 
life is endangered, as may be seen when a community is 
stricken by a great fire, disastrous flood, or a deadly epi- 
demic. The great relief measures conducted throughout 
the world by various welfare organizations, notably the 
American Red Cross, are made possible by the impelling 
motives arising normally from the human tendency to serve 
where needs exist. 
_ It is under the actuating, driving power of one or more 
of the motives just discussed that mature men and women 
go about their daily work. If a person finds that his daily 
tasks are not richly motivated, that his work is drudgery 
to him, he begins to seek a change in his duties, in order 
that he may work under the inspiring influence of adequately 
impelling motives. With this primary purpose controlling 
them, many men and women make complete changes in 
their occupations.  
-P-A-G-E-92
      
TEACHING      
  MODERN MEI 
  If adequate motives for é are so vital to happiness 
and success among mature men and women, how much more 
necessary must they be to boys and girls of school age, who 
are less trained and experienced in holding themselves to 
tasks solely from the standpoint of duty. 
Common-sense observation indicates rather clearly that 
the need of adequate motivation is greatest in the child’s 
earliest years. Every observant parent and teacher has 
noted how faithfully a child applies himself to the doing of 
anything, either at work or at play, for which he has 
sufficient motive, and how he avoids or shirks anything 
which makes no appeal to him. That which he feels no need 
for, sees no value in for himself, he has no motive to do or 
possess. On the contrary, he will work long and hard at 
anything which has significance or meaning to him by 
which he can realize some desired end. 
This principle, as we have noted, is manifest both in 
play and work. A child will exert himself for hours, even to. 
the point of exhaustion, playing some game of interest, such 
as baseball, football, blackman, or hide-and-go-seek. The 
pleasure he experiences in the activity is a sufficient stimulus 
to call forth all of the effort necessary. Likewise, he will 
apply himself faithfully ii work to secure a sufficiently 
desired result—it may be the earning of money for a bathing 
suit, or it may be the building of a shelter for his pet 
rabbits. It matters not just what the work is. So long as 
he is realizing some need or accomplishing some purpose, 
his motives are sufficient to insure compietion of the task. 
The need of adequate motives for doing school work is 
clearly just as great as the need of adequate motives for 
doing any other type of work. That such motives may be 
operative, the work that the pupils do must be meaningful 
and significant tothem. They must feel a need of the result
-P-A-G-E-93
Pen i ee nee Se ORS Nn ESR ee 
MOTIVATING SCHOOL WORK 87 
the school work will produce and must appreciate its value 
to them. 
The acceptance of this principle and point of view by 
teachers will do much to guide them in the elimination of 
work and requirements which are meaningless and useless 
to pupils and which can not, therefore, be adequately 
motivated. 
A vast amount of work which cannot be fundamentally 
motivated because it is not only meaningless to pupils 
but also intrinsically useless to anybody, still finds place 
in the schools. These tasks are really not work; they are 
drudgery, because the pupils do not and can not see meaning 
or sense in them, nor good reasons for doing them. For 
example, pupils are often assigned long lists of miscellaneous 
words to look up in the dictionary. They are asked to note 
the meaning of each word, its syllabication and its diacritical 
marking, and then use it in a sentence. Evidently such 
work is drudgery, for until the meaning and pronunciation 
of a word are familiar to a pupil, it is a lifeless, useless thing 
tohim. All the work he may do uponitin isolation, by using 
the dictionary, merely bores and disgusts him, and ac- 
complishes no end reasonable to the child. Solving long 
lists of problems that do not produce any solutions which 
he needsor which are of any value to him is likewise disgust- 
ing drudgery. In the same category, also, must we place 
the parsing of words, the drawing of maps, filled with 
many details, to mathematical scale, and the memorizing 
of long lists of unimportant dates in history. 
The foregoing consideration of the importance of motive 
in work shows not only that adequate motives for effort 
have actuated the achievements of the race, but that they 
are indispensable to thorough-going work by anyone. They 
are so essential to application and success that mature
-P-A-G-E-94
88 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
  people sometimes change their work to insure the stimulus 
of adequate motives. Such motives are surely even more 
necessary to study and fundamental mastery on the part 
of the immature youth in the schools than for older 
persons. 
It remains, now, in the third place, to show how the work 
of the schools may be adequately motivated as a prerequi- 
site to thorough, certain, and economical mastery. This 
will be set forth briefly and concretely in the remainder of 
this chapter. 
The adequate motivation of all, or practically all, of the 
work pupils should do in school may be accomplished if 
two considerations are sufficiently observed. 
First, schools should endeavor to have pupils learn only 
things and processes which are of use and value in life situa- 
tions. Motives for mastering all of those things possessing 
a life-value are fairly easy to discover. Most things for 
which the rank and file of adults will have need are also 
needed in some relation and to some degree by boys and 
girls of school age; or if not, their life-use can at least be 
understood easily by pupils. Such understanding on the 
part of the pupils may be used by the teachers to provide 
large motivating values. 
As has been mentioned before, one reason teachers find it 
_ difficult to motivate much of the work of the schools is 
\ 
  | that they are required by the course of study and the text- 
books in use to teach a great deal of material which is of 
no use to anyone either in childhood or adult life. ) Most of 
the work done in any subject from the technical, dgenitional 
standpoint possesses little or no life-use value. Pupils 
should learn to use accurately those technical terms in each 
subject which are essential toeconomy in writing and speak- 
ing; but to require the mastery of the technical definition
-P-A-G-E-95
  MOTIVATING SCHOOL WORK 89 
of each is largely useless waste. Parents do not think of 
requiring their children to learn the technical definition of 
each article of furniture in the home, and yet, as rapidly 
as there is need for it, children learn to speak with accuracy 
of the chairs, beds, dressers, rockers, and the other furniture, 
just from the daily experiences of life. In similar ways, 
they should learn to use the common technical terms em- 
ployed in arithmetic, geography, composition and grammar, 
and all other subjects in the curriculum. It is not possible 
to motivate the learning of useless things in any genuine 
or sincere way. The learning of these things is necessarily 
largely drudgery. 
On the other hand, the learning of all of those things 
for which pupils have need, or for which they see they will 
have need later, is easy of motivation. In this list are 
included the ability to spell useful words, to use simple, accu- 
rate language in speech and writing, to figure all ordinary 
problems, to employ the useful facts and principles of 
geography, history and science, and to write legibly. 
Second, all matters and processes mastered by pupils 
because of their use should be learned, in so far as possible, 
when the pupils need touse them in some concrete situation. 
If it is found impossible or impracticable to provide such an 
immediate need for something that thinking people gen- 
erally agree should be taught because it will be needed in 
adult life, or because it must be learned in order that some- 
thing else of value may be taught, then the pupils should 
be led to understand these reasons for its mastery. Thus 
they will experience the largest measure of motivation pos- 
sible under the circumstances. 7 For example, some arith- 
metic combinations for which no immediate pupil-need 
appears may have to be taught in order to equip the pupil 
with a complete mastery of other number facts which
-P-A-G-E-96
  go MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
experience shows are necessary in life. Likewise, for similar 
reasons, it may be desirable and economical to teach certain 
words in spelling, some facts of geography, history, science, 
music, and so on, without waiting until a specific need 
appears for teaching each item. But in such cases the 
motivating effect of an actual need for the rest of the series 
will be sufficient to render meaningful the mastery of the few 
items for which actual need did not appear. 
[Bes experienced teacher who has sought to guide 
il learning from the standpoint of teaching those things 
or processes for which his pupils have a definite conscious 
need knows that any class has more actual needs in any 
given period, be it a week, month, or semester, than the 
school can possibly supply in the time available for meeting 
them. The wise teacher, therefore, guides his class to work 
upon satisfying those needs which he believes to be the 
most important from the standpoint of the child’s complete 
education and socialization. Such guidance of the class by 
the teacher will also result in completing those bodies of 
work for which the grade has been made responsible by the 
course of study, provided always that the course of study 
is well graded and specifies for learning only those materials 
and process which have a life-use. 
Typical needs, while varying with classes as to the way 
in which they present themselves, are easy to discover and 
tabulate. They may be expressed in termsof school subjects, 
or in terms of the pupil’s need to participate in activities. 
Expressed in terms of school subjects, pupils need to 
spell, to write, to express ideas orally and in writing, to 
figure, to sing, to draw, to chin a bar, to make a sled, to 
sew a dress and the like. This list may be extended to cover 
each kind of need that may be supplied by each of the 
various subjects of study.
-P-A-G-E-97
  MOTIVATING SCHOOL WORK or 
It becomes clear, however, when one considers the reason 
for each need expressed in the form used in the preceding 
paragraph, that needs may be more fundamentally stated 
in terms of typical activities—things the pupils need to be 
able to do. The writer has set forth such a list of needs 
elsewhere,! so they will be stated here merely in summary 
fashion. These needs are to earn money or acquire prop- 
erty; to enter a contest for results, a reward, or an honor; 
to play successfully; to make things; to entertain; to share 
with others; to promote a favorable attitude toward oneself 
on the part of others; to grow, personally; to accumulate 
things of value; to extend one’s power and influence over 
other things and people; and to prepare for a life occupation. 
The various activities the pupil should master in school will 
contribute toward fitting the child to do one or more of 
these things. The specific need which pupils may be 
striving to meet at any time, it will be found, is some aspect 
of one or more of the types of needs listed above. 
The essentials in fundamental motivation, the need and 
importance of it, and the means of accomplishing it have 
claimed our attention in this chapter. In view of the con- 
siderations set forth above, it should be clear that it is easy 
to find ways of motivating all proper school work, and that 
the gains in learning under such a stimulus are so great that 
all formal, routine methods which merely impose book- 
tasks upon pupils should be dispensed’ with. Teachers who 
employ such a procedure will find their pupils at work 
always under the impelling, inspiring influence of adequate 
motives.

CHAPTER VII 
The Problem Method of Learning 
The solving of a problem is a real-life activity as old as 
mankind. The ever-present ability of the human being to 
face rationally his many new situations, to use his reasoning 
powers in helping himself and others, has always been one 
of his distinguishing characteristics. He has progressed up- 
ward through the ages by using his brain to the end of 
overcoming obstacles and of meeting other types of diffi- 
culties. The history of the race consists of a countless 
number of successful and unsuccessful efforts to solve all 
sorts of problems. Ages ago man succeeded in making the 
first cunning capture of the small edible animals, lost and 
won battles with the more ferocious ones. Today he has 
conquered practically all external obstacles and is turning 
his attention with renewed vigor to the problem of conquer- | 
ing himself. 
Daily we face a procession of problems which must be 
solved—physical, vocational, avocational, civic, and moral 
in nature. The number of these problems is multiplying 
rapidly with the continually increasing complexity of so- 
ciety. Child life as well as adult life is crowded with 
activities involving both simple and complex problematic 
experiences. Even the crossing of a busy city street has 
become a serious problem, for it includes coping with 
crowds of pedestrians, avoiding congested vehicular traffic, © 
and understanding many very necessary municipal regula- : 3 X
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 93 
tions. Hence if we as teachers are going to contribute 
towards making children socially efficient at all times, we 
must begin at the time these children first enroll in school 
to guide their activities into channels requiring the solving 
of real and essential problems of life. 
That we may discriminate clearly between problem solv- 
ing and other types of natural attacks in teaching, it is 
necessary that we define now what we mean by problem 
solving. (Solving a problem is a purposeful act leading to 
the removal of a perplexity, or to the elimination of some 
other difficulty, through a process of reasoning It differs 
fundamentally from project procedure, in the manner that 
the learner responds; the latter involves construction, crea- 
tion, or both, by means of concrete materials, while the 
former is essentially a mental activitye 
A common example of the problem procedure may be 
seen in the wise settling of a quarrel between two boys. 
The teacher interrupted them in the school yard and took 
them aside, together with other boys who had witnessed 
the quarrel from the beginning. She led the boys into a 
presentation of all the details which had given rise to the 
quarrel and then dismissed all but the principals in the 
fight. They then discussed, under her guidance, what was 
wrong with their actions, the effect upon themselves, upon 
other children, and upon the school. Finally they arrived 
at a decision not only about this quarrel but also about 
what their future conduct in similar situations should be. 
In the teacher’s clever guidance of the boys’ thinking, she 
had presented to their minds the problem: ‘‘What is good 
conduct on the playground?” Surely this problem arose as 
a felt need, a real difficulty to be met. The boys were led 
to see their quarrel as an act affecting not only themselves 
but also a much larger civic group. They determined,
-P-A-G-E-100
  94 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
through an analysis of incidents which caused the quarrel, 
why it was wrong for them to fight. Then they reached a 
decision concerning the fight they had had and what they 
should do if the same conditions or incidents should arise 
again. Hence we have in the settling of the quarrel an 
illustration of a problem and also the technique for solving 
it. An intensive study of this problem discloses the prin- 
ciples of proceding in the solution of any problem. These 
principles are outlined below. 
(1) Before a problem can be solved it must be under- 
stood by all who are involved in it. Thus the problem 
should first be clearly defined. A problem becomes mean- 
ingful and purposeful to each pupil only, when he has a 
clear conception of what he is undertaking, and how it 
affects himself and others. When his interest is keenly 
aroused his resulting activities in turn become meaningful, 
important, and definite. These activities are then seen as 
the necessary experiences which lead toward a desired goal 
and in doing so produce a result which overcomes the felt 
difficulty. 
An example of the need for clearly defining a problem 
may be seen in the work of an architect. When he is 
planning a house, he does not ask himself, ‘‘What about the 
roof?’’, and then proceed to draw one. Instead he develops ° 
a more careful and detailed statement of his problem: 
“What kind and pitch of roof is necessary for this house so 
that (a) it may be in keeping with its surroundings, and 
(b) it can withstand the heat of the summer, and shed the 
rains, support the heavy snowfalls, and keep out the cold of 
winter?’ The statement of the problem in this careful and 
detailed way clearly defines it so that an economic and 
efficient solution may be reached. 
(2) Knowing, now, just what his problem is, the architect
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 95 
begins solving it by thinking over his past experiences in 
planning houses for somewhat similar situations. This ex- 
emplifies the next step in our teaching procedure, also. 
Having clearly defined a problem needing solution we 
must take stock of all information gained in the past which 
has a bearing on the solution of the new problem. Similarly 
the child must be led to ask himself the questions: (a) 
“What experiences have I had that were similar to the 
present one?”’, and (b) “Are they sufficient for solving this 
new problem?” It is the business of the teacher to guide 
the pupil in raising and answering these two questions. 
In this manner the child learns to make use of those ele- 
ments in his past experiences which are common to the 
present one and which will prove a source of help in meeting 
the felt need. While doing this he will have become cog- 
nizant of his own shortcomings and the necessity of securing 
or acquiring information he at present lacks. 
(3) This leads him directly to his next step in the solution 
of the problem. He must discover and collect all informa- 
tion that will be of use to him. 
In this series of activities the teacher will be most valuable 
as a director, guide, and counsellor, He should create an 
environment of books and other materials which will con- 
tain as far as possible the essential information needed by 
the pupil. Through thoughtful suggestions and careful 
questioning he can lead the child to find additional materials, 
and through thoughtful guidance he can inspire and en- 
courage him to organize purposively this information. The 
pupil, under this type of teacher direction will progress 
economically and efficiently. The possibility of failure will 
be minimized. The subject matter and experiences will 
be real and essential to desirable mental growth. These 
statements are not intended to imply that the teacher is to
-P-A-G-E-102
96 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
do the pupils’ work, however. The child, as the learner 
under this type of teaching, will feel, think, and act inde- 
pendently, and thereby grow in a way undreamed of. 
(4) As soon as the pupil has acquired all of the available 
data which is more or less essential to his purpose, he must 
analyze and evaluate it, compare and contrast, discard the 
useless, retain the really essential, and finally determine the 
relative importance of the data retained. This process may 
be inductive, deductive, or both, depending upon the 
nature of the problem attacked. An explanation and dis- 
cussion of the two types, induction and deduction, is 
included at the close of this chapter. : 
In this phase of problem solving, the intellectual develop- 
ment of the teacher may often tend to lead him into a too 
extensive participation in the child’s activities. Frequently, 
the teacher must remind himself that the pupil is the learner. 
» His own part in problem solving continues to be the same 
as in the preceding step. He should give the child wise 
guidance, thoughtful counsel and sound leadership, to the 
end that all essential information be utilized in the interest 
of effective learning, but he should allow the child to do 
his own thinking. 
(5) As_soon as the pupil has collected and organized, 
analyzed and evaluated, all of the data, he is ready to 
reach a conclusion. Until he has attained this point, his 
judgment should have been suspended. He should have 
the scientific point of view in regard to his data. A deci- 
sion should be reached only after considering all the 
important evidence, and it should be impersonal. The 
decision should be, not necessarily what he would like it 
to be, but what it must be, if based upon the evidence. 
Having carried on the necessary activities, and obtained 
the essential experiences, the pupil is then ready to make
-P-A-G-E-103
THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 97 
willingly and earnestly his response to the situation. In 
almost every case where thoroughness and thoughtfulness 
have characterized his progress toward a purposeful end, 
his choice of responses will be satisfactory. However, some 
complex problems require almost as complex answers. Then 
he may still need the counsel of his teacher in making a 
decision. This will be needed rarely, because under the 
latter’s guidance the pupil will complete his undertaking». 
(6) He will be led to verify his conclusion in order that 
he may substantiate the correctness of it. When this has 
been done, he will have acquired from his experiences the 
desirable outcomes in terms of new essential knowledge, 
some improvement in skills, thedevelopment of better habits, 
and more wholesome attitudes. From the standpoint of his 
complete socialization, therefore, he will have become better 
equipped as a socially efficient person. 
The problem, then, is solved by the pupil when he (1) has 
a clear conception of it; (2) recalls old experiences which 
may help in its solution; (3) acquires, out of new experiences, 
the additional information essential to determining the best 
reaction to it; (4) critically evaluates and manipulates these 
data to make them serve his needs, and, supplementing 
them, corrects his tentative conclusion; (5) arrives ata 
conclusion; and (6) checks it against the problem to deter- 
mine the correctness of the response to be made. 
“What are good problems for children to solve in the 
classroom? How do these problems arise?”, teachers ask. 
The first question can be answered readily. Any problem 
that meets a real life-need of the pupils is a good problem, 
and the more vital the need appears to be, the greater is the 
justification for solving it. Therefore, the teacher must 
analyze all problems from two standpoints: (1) how mean- 
ingful and purposeful the problem is to the pupils; (2) how   
     
-P-A-G-E-104
98 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
essential the experiences are, and how valuable their most 
apparent outcomes will be in producing growth of the 
children from the standpoint of social efficiency. 
The answer to the second question, “How do problems 
arise?’’, is not so easy to give. Problems arise in almost 
every life-situation, and in all fields of subject matter. 
Frequently they form the major phase of a life-situation, 
and at times minor aspects of it. They grow out of present 
and future needs created through past experiences. Hence 
the problem generally is a statement, in understandable 
form, of an actual felt need. It is met and solved by the 
series of experiences making possible a rational mastery of 
the situation. The problem may be introduced into the 
class by a pupil or a group of pupils. It may be raised by 
the teacher. Many times it will grow out of the combined 
activities of teacher and pupils. In any case it must appear 
to the pupils to be something of purposeful, meaningful 
consequence. They must see and attack it as their own. 
The account of the quarrel and its solution under the 
teacher’s guidance illustrates how all three codperatively 
raised a problem which the boys accepted as their own, to 
be solved by them. The examples following not only illus- 
trate practical applications of the principle of problem 
solving to classroom situations akin to life, but also indicate 
how the problems may arise in various ways, how they 
become the pupils’ own center of interest. In some cases, 
the resourceful teacher accepted problems raised by the 
children; in others, she tactfully led children to raise prob- 
lems; while in still others, she ingeniously guided them into 
accepting, as their own, problems which she had raised for 
them because she was cognizant of certain needs unknown 
to them, but which they would later meet. In the final 
analysis it will be found that the selection of a problem to
-P-A-G-E-105
oom THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 99 
be solved is in general a codperative undertaking involving 
pupil and teacher. The former faces a recognized need; 
the latter recognizes the educational advantages involved 
in its solution. The origin of a problem is relatively unim- 
portant; but its acceptance by all as vital and important 
isa prerequisite to its effective use as a basis for learning. 
“ Some examples of the practical application of the prin- 
ciples of problem solving to child learning, which have been 
selected from records of observed classroom activities will 
now be given. These examples indicate how varied the 
nature of the’ problem maybe, and how varied the adap- 
tation of good procedure becomes under the guidance of a 
careful, thoughtful teacher. These examples constitute, 
also, material evidence of the adaptability of the problem 
method of learning to children of any age or grade. 
The pupils in the high first grade were observed by the 
writer when attacking a problem in nature study. They 
had decided to plant and raise some flowers for window 
boxes. Members of the class had written letters to the 
principal and to the supervisor of nature study requesting 
the most obvious equipment and materials needed. When 
the flower pots, window boxes, and bulbs had arrived, the 
pupils wanted to plant the bulbs right away. Their tactful 
teacher guided them into a discussion of the planting and 
growing of bulbs until they had raised the problem: ‘(How 
can we raise beautiful plants from our bulbs?” In the 
chapter on “The Assignment,” a stenographic report of 
this phase of the problem has been included. 
When the pupils understood that they were confronted 
with a real problem, they recognized the necessity of solving 
it. With this in mind they contributed to the thinking 
of the class such information as they had already acquired 
from their experiences outside of school. They found out,
-P-A-G-E-106
eee 
100 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
also, how and where they could get additional information. 
The teacher then furnished them with books which con- 
tained simple accounts and stories involving information 
about planting and raising flowers. These were read by 
(a) individual children who were held responsible to the 
class for oral reports; 
(6) small codperating groups selected according to their 
comparable reading ability and the seeming difficulty of 
the reading material; 
(c) the teacher, who supplemented her oral reading with 
necessary explanations when the accounts were too difficult 
to be understood by the pupils. 
The information obtained from other persons was devel- 
oped into simple compositions which were preserved by 
writing them on large sheets of paper fastened together into 
charts. The supervisor of nature study accepted an invita- 
tion to talk to the class about the various phases of planting 
and caring for bulbs. Every suitable source of information 
was consulted by the children. 
All of the data thus gained were used later in their com- 
position work, which the children eagerly undertook. Each 
pupil made a scrapbook entitled ‘‘How to Raise Beautiful 
Plants from Bulbs.’”’ As in the statement of the problem, 
so the title represented what the children accepted as the 
best wording proposed by any member of the class. In 
these scrapbooks they preserved their own individual or 
composite accounts of planting and raising flowers. 
In solving their major problem—how to raise beautiful 
plants from bulbs—many minor problems of course arose. 
When the children had solved each of these minor problems, 
they assembled in order the materials dealing with each 
phase of the major problem, and pasted these materials in 
their scrapbooks under appropriate titles. After carrying
-P-A-G-E-107
THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING | tor 
out the activity determined upon as the answer to a minor 
problem, they concluded the section of their scrapbook 
dealing with it by writing a statement of what they had 
done and what had resulted from their work. Each state- 
ment was illustrated by their own drawings. 
In this manner they raised and solved the following minor 
problems; 
1. What kind of soil do we need for our bulbs? 
2. How shall we obtain the things we need for good soil? 
3- How must we prepare the soil? 
4. What is the right way to plant the bulbs so that they 
will grow? 
5. Why must the planted bulbs be kept in a cool dark place 
for a while? 
6. What care do the plants need while they are growing? 
Carrying out the projects implied in the solution of these 
problems and keeping a careful record of them in their 
scrapbooks constituted the series of experiences which led 
to the final solution of the major problem. When the 
results of their activities finally appeared, the children were 
able to explain very thoroughly how to raise beautiful plants 
from bulbs. 
—— The children of another class, a sixth grade, had under- 
taken the project of making a historical and geographical 
floor map of Europe. They had discussed and determined 
to their satisfaction what particular types of monuments 
and geographical and historical structures would be essen- 
tial to give the best possible picture of the history and 
geography of Europe. They agreed to include miniature 
representations of the largest cities, seaports, and capitals 
of the various countries. Rapidly Liverpool, Glasgow, Paris, 
London, Brussels, Stockholm, Petrograd, and many other 
cities appeared. Then an obstacle arose. One group of
-P-A-G-E-108
102 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
children who had assumed the responsibility of determining 
what cities of Russia should be included had disagreed over 
the proposed inclusion of Moscow. The chairman of the 
committee presented to the rest of the class the perplexity 
in the form of a question: ‘Is Moscow of sufficient impor- 
tance to be given a place on our floor map?” This became 
a real problem for the whole class to solve. 
In order that they might determine wisely the answer to 
this question, the children compiled a list of the significant 
historical, geographical, and other essential features which 
should form the basis for judging the importance of a city. 
They applied the criteria to several different kinds of cities 
which had been placed on the map, and proved to their 
satisfaction that these rightfully belonged there. They found 
that some were great manufacturing cities, others were great 
commercial centers, and so forth. Then they took up the 
question of Moscow. Soon they found out that they did 
not have sufficient information about the city to arrive at 
a fair conclusion. They agreed also that the committee 
on Russian cities had not made as careful a study as the 
subject seemed to require. The various geography and 
history textbooks, atlases, the encyclopedias, and magazine 
articles were distributed among the members of the class. 
All selections about Moscow were read and the information 
recorded. 
When the reading had been completed, the important 
data were listed on the board by one of the pupils, as each 
member contributed the information he had discovered. 
Next, this material was grouped under the various points 
which were to be used as bases for determining the impor- 
tance of Moscow.. The final summary built up in the class 
indicated that Moscow (1) had been and continued to be a 
great center of political power in Russia, (2) was the center
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 103 
of an immense region producing a large quantity of market- 
able materials, (3) was the point at which a number of roads 
and railroads met, (4) maintained a great center of com- 
mercial exchange. Therefore, the pupils decided that the 
city was sufficiently important to be given space on the 
floor map. SN S. 
Another sixth grade geography class was studying India" 
The pupils had recently arrived at a decision as to what 
they thought the United States ought to do about the 
Philippines. While the teacher was explaining a new assign- 
ment to this class, one of the pupils volunteered the infor- 
mation that some of theinhabitants of India wereadvocating 
independence fromBritishcontrol. Another pupil toldabout 
reading a newspaper article which argued that India should 
not have its independence. 
“Can we debate that?” asked another pupil. 
“Would you like to do that?” asked the teacher. 
“Yes,” enthusiastically replied the class in chorus. 
Immediately the pupils began their preparations for the 
debate. They concluded their preliminary discussion of 
the subject with the statement which was to be debated: 
“Resolved, That India should be allowed an independent 
form of government.”’ Two debating teams of four pupils 
each were selected from among the members of the class 
who had not participated in the last two debates. Each 
team selected its own leaders, and the remainder of ‘the 
class elected a chairman and a secretary for the meeting 
at which the debate was to be held. Also three “critics of 
performance” were selected. Then the pupils who had not 
been assigned any specific duty organized as a judging 
committee, electing one of their number as chairman. 
These preliminaries were expeditiously arranged, and the 
teacher called the whole class together.
-P-A-G-E-110
104 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
“What help can we who are not on the debating teams 
be to the debaters?” she asked. The responses which she 
received consisted of offers to find and turn over to the 
debaters helpful material such as newspapers, magazines, 
and textbooks pertaining to the subject of the debate; 
offers to interview, if possible, travelers or natives of 
India who could furnish first-hand information; and the 
resolution “not to accept as final any decision until every- 
thing is known about the subject.” This preparation 
resulted in activities which kept the pupils alert in finding, 
reading, and distributing materials and at the same time 
fair-minded, by withholding a personal decision in regard 
to the merits of the question until the debate had been 
concluded. The proposed debate became such a center of 
keen interest to them that its influence reached out and 
permeated their homes. 
On the day of the debate many parents came to attend 
the class meeting at which the debate was held. Earnestly 
the teams presented the evidence, pro and con, while the 
members of the judging committee made lists of the points 
presented. When the debaters had finished, the judges 
carefully checked and paired the points and reached a 
decision based on the merits of the arguments presented. 
In the meantime the critics discussed the debate and pre- 
pared a series of reports upon the method of presentation 
by the various debaters. The chairman of the judges 
rendered the decision. Then the three critics of the per- 
formance presented their helpful suggestions and frank crit- 
icisms so that the whole class, as well as the individual 
debaters, could profit accordingly. 
How a third grade had undertaken and attempted to 
solve a civic problem is indicated in the following letter 
written by a member of the class:

Dear Mr. Kyte: 
The traveling ladder is not being used right because the chil- 
dren are tackling each other. So our room was discussing it. 
We think that what we have been doing is going to help. We 
sent Claire and Carlton to the rooms from first grade to sixth. 
They asked the children if they would stop tackling each other. 
If you think that will help send an answer. 
Yours truly, 
Tatty TAYLOR 
Low Third. 
How the interest and effort of the pupils was maintained 
over a period of many months in solving a problem was 
observed in a fifth grade class. The teacher had read to 
them a story of Pilgrim life. In the course of the discussion 
which followed, one of the pupils asked, ‘Why do our fathers 
work in large places of business while the Pilgrims did most 
things at home?” Of course, finding a satisfactory answer 
required many weeks of study. The question was written on 
the board and never erased until the final conclusion was 
reached. A variety of activities was carried on with this 
theme permeating them. Many minor problems were dis- 
cussed and solved. Some of the essential information be- 
came understood through the execution of projects by 
various individuals and groups. Other material was ob- 
tained from travelers who were invited by the class to 
speak to it. Some very important facts which continually 
recurred were drilled upon. Hence, in the activities, all 
types of teaching procedures were utilized to the end of 
solving the major problem. 
Examples of the minor problems solved in the course of 
finding the answer to the larger one are as follow:
-P-A-G-E-112
106 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
1. What were the physiographical and climatic conditions 
encountered by the Pilgrims, which affected their daily life? 
2) Why was the Colonial family practically a self-sufficient 
industrial unit? 
3. What conditions and factors in North America led to the 
expansion westward? 
4. What changes resulted in American life because of the 
movement? 
5. Why did cities develop rapidly in the new world after 1800? 
6. How did the inventions of Whitney, Fulton, Morse, Bell, 
and others, affect home life and the industries? 
7. Why were there such rapid changes in American social and 
industrial life, especially after 1870? i 
If the reader answers just the few questions included above 
he will realize that the outcomes from the activities included 
an insight into the evolution of industrial life and its inevi-. 
table effecton the home and family life, with theassimilation 
of a considerable amount of related information and con- 
ceptions. When these had been acquired by the pupils they 
were able to solve the major problem. They assembled all 
of the information into an organized whole out of which 
the final solution naturally emerged, Their complex but 
correct answers to the major problem were illustrative of 
thorough learning, culminating in highly desirable outcomes. 
It was pointed out elsewhere in this chapter that the 
fourth step in the solution of a problem involves an induc- 
tive or deductive process. In many drill experiences, also, 
the one or the other occurs, but only as a phase of a larger 
activity. For example, when pupils discover a need for the 
ability to add fractions, inductive thinking becomes a part 
of the drill procedure. They learn that 14” and “1g” 
can be added together when the latter is changed to its 
equivalent, “24.” Also, the sum of “1g” and ‘1¢” can be
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 107 
obtained after “14” has been changed to ‘‘2¢.” A series 
of similar drill exercises culminates in knowledge of, and 
skill in applying, the principle of addition of fractions. 
Having achieved the immediate end of the inductive drill 
lesson, the pupils utilize their new accomplishment in 
continuing the desired activities. 
So much has been written on the subject of inductive 
and deductive thinking that teachers are not only familiar 
with the processes but generally have over-estimated their 
value, important though their place in natural learning is. 
In concluding this chapter on the problem method of 
teaching, only a brief resumé of the essential elements to 
be observed with respect to the place and use of induction 
and deduction in learning are included. 
Inductive thinking is a process of forming general con- 
clusions, general conceptions, principles, rules, or laws, from 
a study of particulars. In other words, induction is a 
mental activity in which the learner analyzes and evaluates 
a mass of data, to the end that a correct generalization may 
be reached. It requires reasoning from a series of detailed 
premises to a general conclusion. The examples of develop- 
ing the rule for addition of fractions and of solving the 
problem, ‘‘When should a city be considered very impor- 
tant?” previously cited, illustrate the application of induc- 
tive thinking in teaching procedures. 
Also, the fifth grade pupils’ solution of the problem 
dealing with the evolution of industry exemplified the place 
and nature of inductive reasoning in a natural child activity. 
In order to determine why modern Americans are so inter- 
dependent, while their ancestors were not, the pupils had 
to determine and understand the large number of significant 
developments in our nation’s history, each of which con- 
tributed to the growth of interdependency. No correct
-P-A-G-E-114
108 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
general conclusion was possible until all specific factors had 
been considered. The illustration also indicates one of the 
most important points that teachers must keep in mind 
when their pupils are reasoning upon a given set of facts 
with a view to reaching a general conclusion. The children 
must be shown that nofinal judgment is possible until all the 
facts affecting a conclusion have been carefully considered. 
Inductive thinking occurs in school work in situations 
where pupils need to find out the general meaning of many 
particulars. For example, the Parent-Teacher Association 
of a certain school offered first and second prizes for the 
construction of the best and the second best bird-houses 
respectively. The pupils entered into the contest with great 
interest. In their elementary science classes they set them- 
selves the task of finding out how to make good bird-houses. 
Their discussions, questions, and comments may be sum- 
marized as follows: First they tried to learn what kind of 
houses birds like to live in. Some pupils who had previously 
made bird-houses gave their experiences. One boy stated 
that he made a beautiful bird-house, painting it in bright 
colors, but he couldn’t get any birds to live in it. Another 
boy said that he had a bird-house made out of bark, 
without paint, and thata little wren lived in it every summer. 
Another boy said that he didn’t paint his bird-house but he 
had stained it to keep it from rotting, and no birds lived 
in it. 
On the basis of these and similar experiences, the class 
decided that a good bird-house should be just as nearly as 
possible like the natural homes of birds. Then questions 
were asked regarding the location of bird-houses: where 
food and water should be placed, whether cats and dogs 
should be kept by people having bird-houses, whether bird- 
houses should be in sunny or in shady places, and whether
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE PROBLEM METHOD OF LEARNING 109 
different kinds of birds need different kinds of houses. The 
discussion led the pupils to observe a number of good bird- 
houses, after which they drew certain definite conclusions 
regarding good bird-houses. Finally, with these conclusions 
in mind, the work of making bird-houses began. 
An analysis of the learning process involved in thinking 
inductively will disclose that the teacher should direct 
the children’s activities so that they (1) are ready, i. e., 
prepared, for the experience, (2) are able to analyze their 
assembled information, (3) have the ability to evaluate 
particular data, and (4) may feel confident that all steps 
have been taken which are essential to arriving at a satis- 
factory general conclusion. 
Deductive thinking is a process of reaching specific con- 
clusions or particular decisions by applying accepted general- 
izations, principles, rules, or the like. That is to say, deduc- 
tion is that phase of a total learning situation in which some 
detail is understood or interpreted by applying a previously 
learned definition or conclusion.. It is a process of reasoning 
from a general view or principle to some new particular which 
is to be understood. The conclusion reached depends for its 
accuracy upon the correctness 6f generalization which is ap- 
plied in understanding or interpreting the new particular, 
This type of thinking by the pupils occurred in the sixth 
grade solution of the problem “Is Moscow of sufficient 
importance to be included on our floor map of Europe?” 
The generalization consisted of the pupils’ conception of the 
essential points by which they could determine how impor- 
tant any city is. In checking up Moscow’s claims to impor- 
tance they evaluated them in terms of these points. By 
deduction they arrived at the conclusion that Moscow 
was an important city and therefore gave it a place on their 
floor map.
-P-A-G-E-116
  IIo MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
As in the process of induction, deductive thinking of 
children should be directed by the teacher so that they 
are ready (1) to undertake the activity, (2) to analyze 
carefully their amassed data, (3) to evaluate it critically. 
They (4) should feel confident that all steps have been taken 
which are essential to arriving at a satisfactory specific 
conclusion. 
The reader should refer to the steps in solving a problem 
in order to note again the place of induction or deduction 
in teaching procedures. It is especially essential for teachers 
to remember that neither process is complete in itself. 
Inductive or deductive thinking leads to a point where a 
conclusion may and should be reached and then checked up 
with respect to all information at hand, to determine its 
correctness, When this has been done, the result reached 
becomes valuable to the individual.

CHAPTER VIII 
The Project Method of Learning 
The word “project,” as applied to teaching, had its 
origin in connection with the activities introduced into 
classroom procedure when manual training, home economics, 
and agriculture were added to the school curriculum. It 
“was applied to the planning and completing of some 
activity which was primarily manual in nature. Such 
undertakings as planting, cultivating, and marketing a par- 
ticular crop; planning, preparing, and serving a meal; and 
planning and building a bird-house, were designated as 
projects. 
Students of method in recent years have adopted this 
term as applying to a certain teaching procedure, but with 
its adoption they have introduced various conceptions and 
definitions of it. Some consider the project method as an 
all-inclusive concept for any acceptable teaching procedure; 
others have retained its original meaning, with the excep- 
tion that it has been extended to include constructive 
activities in subjects other than those just mentioned; 
while still others have formulated different concepts which 
are varying degrees of compromise between the first two. 
At present there are some thirty different connotations. 
Wherever the term “project method of learning” appears 
in this text, it signifies that type of purposeful act which 
requires for its completion the construction or creation of 
an objective piece of work. It differs from the problem 
. Tit
-P-A-G-E-118
  112 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
manner of accomplishing an end. (The solution of a problem 
is an abstract process of reasoning to a conclusion—a pro- 
cedure based on abstract thinking. The execution of a 
project is a rationalized concrete production of the end 
sought—a procedure involving material doing as well as 
thinking. When an individual is determining how to write 
a play worthy of production he is solving a problem. When 
he is writing a play to be produced he is executing a project. 
Hence the project method of learning is a purposeful act 
involving the construction or the creation of a material 
product to the end of overcoming an obstacle, a perplexity, 
or some other type of difficulty. 
This natural and meaningful procedure, like the problem 
method, employs reasoning as against memory; emphasizes 
child activity in motivated situations through meaningful 
and essential experiences, instead of employing a passive 
reception of artificially imposed and uninteresting facts. 
It culminates in a meaningful conclusion which may, 
generally, be expressed as a principle, rather than in the 
completion of so many pages of a textbook. The project 
method of learning is being utilized if children are making 
toys, scrapbooks, posters and the like; dramatizing a story, 
an historical incident, an industrial or civic activity and so 
forth; reproducing on the floor or in the sandbox such scenes 
as an event in history, a neighborhood park, an ideal 
garden, an industry; or constructing large geographical and 
historical maps, miniature models and similar material 
products of thinking and doing. 
The steps in the execution of a project are almost identi- 
cal with those determined for the solution of the problem. 
The difference lies in the inclusion of the concrete produc- 
tion in the former type. Therefore, the steps may be stated method of learning presented in Tesi chapter, in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE PROJECT METHOD OF LEARNING 113 
as follows: (1) The pupil must clearly understand why he 
is undertaking the project so that he will have a real 
purpose in beginning it. (2) He should recall his past 
experiences to determine whether or not they can assist 
him in his new effort. (3) He must find and collect addi- 
tional information which will aid him also. (4) All of this 
data must be organized and assimilated by the pupil so 
that he may arrive at the point where he can decide upon 
a plan. (5) When he has found a plan which seems satis- 
factory he constructs or creates that which he set out to 
produce. (6) The process of testing consists in putting 
the product to use in meeting the original purpose. 
Since the procedure is so similar to that of problem 
solving the expansion of most of the principles governing 
the execution of a project is. unnecessary. The reader can 
readily apply the principles set forth in the previous 
chapter to the steps in the project method of learning. 
In so doing it is important to keep in mind certain essentials 
which are characteristic of good project execution, Briefly 
stated they include the following points: 
(1) There must be a real human interest in it for the 
pupil. It should originate with him or be accepted by 
him as his own in answer to a felt need. 
(2) He must see adequate reasons for putting forth his 
best efforts. The project should be within the range of his 
understanding and its values should be appreciated by him. 
(3) He should experience natural activities in natural 
situations. The experiences should be real and occurring 
in an environment similar to that found in life outside of 
the school. 
(4) A good educative project should be broad in scope 
so that enrichment and enlargement of experience is pos- 
sible throughout. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  114 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
(5) The child must be availing himself of useful knowl- 
edge; that is, the project should be based upon sound edu- 
cational purpose. 
(6) Throughout the activity, the effort and the product 
resulting from it shall be the child’s own. In the execution 
of a project the pupil must be the one required to do the 
thinking, feeling, and acting. 
(7) The project method of learning should result in out- 
comes or successes either judged or measured largely by 
objective standards of achievement. 
In the execution of a project, the length of time required 
and the scope of subject matter covered vary considerably. 
Some projects are of momentary duration. When a boy 
scout finds that he needs a stake to fasten a loose rope of 
his tent, he quickly fashions it. On the other hand, he 
may be one of a group who wish to build and furnish a 
small clubhouse. The first project requires only a few min- 
utes for completion; the second, many months. A fifth 
grade class constructed a series of posters depicting the 
evolution of the American Flag. The activities required 
comparatively few hours of actual effort on the part of the 
pupils. The same class carried on a series of activities for 
over a year and a half, its interests centering around the 
building, ornamenting, furnishing, and landscaping of a 
miniature hotel and grounds. These four examples serve to 
illustrate the fact that the time element in the execution 
of a project is a variable based upon the nature of the 
activity. Just as long as the children are interested, and 
are making considerable effort which involves profitable 
experiences and progress in terms of desirable outcomes, 
the activity should be permitted to continue. 
These examples also serve to illustrate the fact that the 
execution of a project may involve a single field of subject
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE PROJECT METHOD OF LEARNING | 11s 
matter, several fields, or many fields. The first mentioned 
was a manual training project. The third required study 
and experience in reading, history, and art. The second 
and fourth examples consisted of a series of activities lead- 
ing directly into practically every subject of the elementary 
school curriculum. 
As already indicated, the project may involve the efforts 
of one pupil or of a group of pupils or of all of the members 
of aclass. All of these kinds of activities should be encour- 
aged so long as the individuals or groups are working whole- 
heartedly. That teachers can apply the principles of the 
project method of learning to pupil activities is exemplified 
in the following illustrations observed in various classrooms 
and grades. 
The sixth grade pupils of a city school found out that a 
considerable sum of money had been set aside by the Board 
of Education for enlarging and equipping the playground. 
Land was to be purchased, cleared, and prepared for this 
purpose. But no definite plan existed for the playground. 
These points were raised under the direction of the teacher 
and led to the decision on the part of the pupils to draw a 
plan, which was to be recommended to the superintendent. 
Early in their activities a member of the Park and Play- 
ground Commission appeared before the class at their 
request and expressed his appreciation of what these pupils 
were undertaking and promised that the plan which seemed 
most satisfactory would be accepted. 
The project led to a study of budgeting the amount of 
money available for a reliable civic project. Finding out 
the cost of additional land and of labor in making it a 
part of the playgrotind unit, computing the increased areas, 
theoretically fencing the property, and surfacing the new 
area, exemplify the type of arithmetic attack. These ex-  
-P-A-G-E-122
eee 
116 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
periences involved a study of decimals, a review of fractions, 
measuring and computing irregular areas and volumes, 
using a number of tables and solving many arithmetical 
problems. 
The children obtained first-hand experience in civics as 
public servants; planning the playground meant planning 
for others, especially children younger than themselves. 
Also they found it necessary to study and discuss bonding, 
taxation, and the duties and functions of various city offi- 
cials. The study of playground needs also necessitated 
understanding the correct uses of various types of appa- 
ratus, and a knowledge of wholesome playing and the 
reasons for recreation. 
All of these studies were made possible through reading 
about playgrounds, physical education, and so forth. Con- 
siderable correspondence was carried on between the class 
and individuals who could assist them in obtaining this 
information. Many oral discussions arose, especially when 
the question of placing play equipment was considered. 
The pupils found it necessary to keep a record of their 
activities in order that they might have at hand, when 
needed, all of the essential information which would help 
them to make a correctly scaled map. 
When all of this essential preliminary study had been 
completed, each pupil constructed a map of what he con- 
sidered an ideal arrangement of the playground, the cost 
of which would be within the amount of money available. 
All of these proposals were organized into an exhibit. They 
were criticised and discussed until the five best were deter- 
mined upon by the pupils. Then they invited the super- 
intendent, of schools, the Board of Education, and members 
of the Park and Playground Commission to hear their 
recommendations. The meeting wasa very inspirational one.   
     
-P-A-G-E-123
THE PROJECT METHOD OF LEARNING 117 
The children explained how they had undertaken the study 
and gave a complete account of their activities as evidence 
of how thoroughly they had carried on the project. They 
concluded the program by presenting to the officials the 
five plans, pointing out the features of each and showing 
how any one of them met the requirements of a good 
playground. 
In a class of younger pupils a fourth grade decided that 
they would like to make a large map. They wanted it to 
be so large that it would require half of the floor space of 
a classroom. When they had succeeded in finding such 
space available they undertook the project of reproducing 
the history of California on the floor map. 
They constructed an outline of the state of California. 
Blue chalk was used to mark out rivers, lakes, bays, and 
the ocean, while mountains were sketched in brown. A 
careful checking up with the geographies dealing with Cali- 
fornia resulted in an excellent reproduction of the most 
important physiographical features. 
On this map the children reproduced by means of models 
the romantic story of California. As this story was read 
and discussed, the progress in the historical account was 
marked by the gradual placement of models on the map. 
For example, Drake’s treasure ship, The Golden Hind, 
sailed into Drake’s Bay and an “Elizabethan coin” was 
nailed on a past as proof of English discovery and claims. 
Spanish galleons sailed along the coast and into the bays. 
Cabrillo’s grave was marked by a miniature soap ‘‘head- 
stone.”” Wherever the ships stopped, Indian traders bear- 
ing hides, cloth, etc., came to the shores and could be seen 
taking away beads and other trinkets. Father Serra’s long, 
slow journey was marked by models of missions in which 
the activities of mission life were depicted. An adobe patio
-P-A-G-E-124
118 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
was built in the center of a large Spanish ranch. Such 
important historical buildings as the Customs House at 
San Jose, Fort Ross, and Sutter’s Fort were modeled. The 
appearance of ‘‘Sutter’s Mill,” with gilt beads in the stream 
near by, was followed by a series of prairie schooners and 
immigrant trains representing various stages of the gold 
rush to California. Near the new Donner monument stood 
a reproduction of the crude Donner Party hut. The tree 
in which Fremont slept and the building at Sonoma flying 
the Bear Flag were constructed and properly located on 
the map. The battleship Oregon steamed proudly out of 
San Francisco Bay on its membrable trip to the Atlantic. 
During the year in which this project was carried on 
almost every conceivable kind of material was brought to 
the class and was used in constructing different types of 
models. During the time that the map was being made, 
and after its completion, the children planned talks and 
wrote stories about their map or phases of it. The follow- 
ing is an example of one of these accounts by a pupil of 
the class: 
Our Catirornia Map 
Our class has a map of California on the floor of an unused 
room. The map is about twenty feet long and about six or 
seven feet wide. 
We are working now on the Donner party. We have put in 
the emigrants’ wagons going to Sutter’s Fort for help. Sutter 
was a very kind man. He had lots of land and very good crops. 
The mountains which the Donner party traveled over are 
done in brown and white chalk, and the lakes are done in blue 
chalk. I made Fort Ross; it’s a little above Drake’s Bay. To 
make Fort Ross I folded some paper into the shape I wanted it. 
Then I cut a little door and drew the windows. Next I put the 
towers in.
-P-A-G-E-125
THE PROJECT METHOD OF LEARNING 119 
Pupils from other schools, and older visitors, were in- 
vited by the children to hear about their map. 
This project might have been worked out in paper on a 
wall map or by developing the important historical events 
into a series of pictures which would form a frieze for the 
room. The sandtable might have been used to show suc- 
cessively an Indian village, a pueblo, a mission, a mining 
camp in 1849, the constitutional convention, the city of 
San Francisco in the 50’s, and the San Francisco Bay 
region of the present. 
A project in a second grade had its origin in the trans- 
ferring of a pupil. A popular member of the class was 
leaving to take a trip around a considerable part of North 
America. He had promised his classmates that he would 
write to them frequently, while they in turn promised to 
mail letters to him which he would receive at various points 
on his trip. The activity grew into a much larger one. One 
of the pupils suggested that they take a trip around the 
world instead of just going around part of North America. 
This was accepted and plans made accordingly. The pupils 
read all of the books on child life in other countries which 
could be obtained. They invited speakers to tell them about 
child activities as they had seen them in the course of their 
travels. Scrapbooks were made for each country “visited.” 
These books contained pupils’ drawings, individual draw- 
ings, and compositions, as well as some copies of composite 
work which was done. In the half year the pupils studied 
child life in twelve countries. 
A fifth grade class had received six sets of puzzle maps 
of the United States. The pupils enjoyed working in com- 
peting to see who could assemble the map most quickly. 
The interest became so keen that it led to an expressed 
desire to make a very large puzzle map. This became the 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
120 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
center of interest for some time. The size of the map was 
determined upon, and the scale for enlarging from a school 
map worked out. Each pupil was assigned one or two 
states to draw and cut out. He was also assigned to various 
committees, consisting of groups of pupils who were respon- 
sible for contiguous sets. When the patterns were com- 
pleted they were tested and found to fit very poorly. This 
unsatisfactory result, they decided, was due to the fact that 
they had not codperated with each other as they should. 
A new set of patterns was made. These were found to be 
very satisfactory and the final map was then constructed 
out of cardboard. 
The class decided that this map could be made to help 
them understand their geography better. The members 
examined the various types of maps furnished them and 
found that their greatest need was one that would depict 
the products of the United States. They discussed ways | 
and means of making their puzzle map serve this purpose. 
Their need was met by gluing on to the various states the 
actual products or pictures of the products most common 
to them. If they could not find pictures to cut out or 
products to be glued on to the map they drew their own 
pictures to paste on. When this activity had been com- 
pleted they reassembled the map and used it to study the 
various industrial regions, which could then be clearly 
visualized. 
The principal of a certain school had received a number 
of complaints from the neighborhood about the careless- 
ness of the pupils in the neighboring playground. The 
principal called a meeting of the school to discuss the 
matter. In the course of the meeting the pupils suggested 
that they organize a Junior Park Commission, not only for 
the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the undesirable
-P-A-G-E-127
       
    THE PROJECT METHOD OF LEARNING tat 
eports but also for undertaking a program of construc- 
ively helping to beautify the park. Several meetings were 
eld to perfect the organization of the Junior Park Com- 
mission and to plan its program of work. For a number of 
lyears this commission has functioned until now it is an in- 
stitution of the school and the community. 
A thrift contest had been inaugurated in a school system. 
Various ways of interesting pupils in an all-inclusive thrift 
movement were planned and carried out. Essay contests, 
poster contests, and talks on thrift are examples of how 
this educational work was carried on. A fifth grade class 
studied thrift by writing a play. This was called “The 
Money Family.” The theme of the play suggested ways 
and means of preventing waste and of saving money. In 
another school, pupils of the same grade composed and pre- 
sented a similar play entitled “Ethel and Her Savings 
Bank.” 
The above illustrations indicate the wide variety of at- 
tacks possible when. the—project~method of learning is 
utilized. The reader will readily recall many examples out 
of his own experiences. They include plays and pageants, 
the making of booklets, sandtable presentations, the making 
of maps, the drawing of pictures and posters, and the con- 
structing of models. In carrying on many of these activi- 
ties children will utilize a wide variety of materials. Wood, 
cloth, clay, soap, paraffin, paper, and even stones, twigs, 
and other things found on the way to school find a place 
in various projects.

CHAPTER IX 
The Appreciation Lesson 
We are living in an age of highly specialized occupations, 
which in turn has resulted in keen, strenuous competition 
in nearly every vocation or profession. This condition 
tends to magnify our conception of social efficiency until in 
some quarters too much stress has been placed on its voca- 
tional phase. As time elapses this tendency will probably 
increase rather than decrease in the minds of the American 
people. Therefore, it is essential that the teacher main- 
tain a broad conception of the aims of education if he is 
to insure the rising generation of school children a con- 
tinuous and properly balanced growth in each of the vari- 
ous phases of social efficiency. This kind of growth should 
include due attention to avocational efficiency, which is 
oftentimes much neglected. To this end we must make 
certain that our pupils acquire a deep and lasting appre- 
ciation for the highest and noblest forms of art, literature, 
and music. 
In developing right attitudes, ideals, and standards in our 
pupils—which can be accomplished if their interests and 
' desires are only for the inspirational best—we must utilize 
more than we have in the past the teaching procedure which 
is most adaptable to our purposes. This is the appreciation 
lesson, the purpose of which is to provide the highest forms 
of artistic, musical, or literary enjoyment or satisfaction to 
the learner, through an inspiring experience in which he 
122
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 123 
assumes the role of listener or observer—becomes the audi- 
ence. This procedure includes such activities as enjoying 
a story or a poem, hearing a singer or a symphony orchestra, 
appreciating a picture or a bit of scenery, or listening to an 
inspiring talk on travel or some historical event. 
Because of the very nature of the appreciation lesson, it, 
is one of the most important educational means at our dis- 
posal for influencing and transforming the attitudes, ideals, 
and standards of children, Appealing to the aesthetic 
emotions by presenting the beautiful, the harmonious, and 
the idealistic in music, literature, or art is just as much 
our educational business as directing children’s activities 
into channels which provide vicarious vocational experi- 
ences or mastery of the “three R’s.” 
Each social group consists of three kinds of people; 
namely, creators, interpreters, and listeners. The appre- 
ciation lesson is the one type cf teaching procedure in which 
the larger part of the class, a social group, participates as 
listeners. In many instances the whole class constitutes an 
audience. The experience the pupils are gaining while so 
engaged must grip them for its own sake. In all cases this 
experience is based on the motive of entertainment and 
therefore must give pleasure and may besides lead them 
into something beyond its immediate motive. 
The activities which may be included in the appreciation 
lesson are as follows: 
1. Enjoying the beauties of a masterpiece of art and lis- 
tening to an inspirational address on the achievement of the 
artist’s ideal which is illustrated by the particular painting, 
sculpture, or other work of art which is being enjoyed. 
2. Listening to good music rendered by soloists, orches- 
tras, bands, and so forth. 
3- Enjoying the oral reading of the finest literary selec-
-P-A-G-E-130
  124 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
tions and masterpieces in the fields of poetry, fiction, 
drama, biography, history, and accounts of travel and of 
scientific discoveries. 
4. Hearing a talk upon his country by a foreigner, or 
one by a traveler upon a foreign country or upon interest- 
ing or unfamiliar parts of our own country. 
5. Visiting a museum, art galleries, a historical monu- 
ment, wonders of nature, and other sources of artistic, his- 
torical, or antiquarian interest. 7 
Since the appreciation lesson is utilized to modify atti- 
tudes, by inculcating hight and standards, we must 
familiarize ourselves with. good procedures which are to be 
followed in employing*this type of lesson, and must under- 
stand the principles of presentation underlying it. In 
Hayward’s ‘The Lesson in Appreciation” is quoted the 
following from the educational drama, Flachsmann als 
Erzieher: 
Your literature lesson was particularly good. Superb. Just 
superb. I never thought a real lyric could be brought home to 
a child. I see it can be done. You did not tear or hack the 
poem. You first carefully prepared the mind and mood; you 
got the soil ready for the poem, within the children, and then 
you raised the whole living plant, rootlets and all, and planted 
it straight in the children’s hearts. Not first in their heads. 
That was a solemn moment. There was the true consecration 
of art. . . . You could hear their hearts throb. I must confess 
to you mine throbbed too. I, too, was your scholar. . . . When 
you stopped, all the children gave a “Ha!” I gave one too. 
This quotation illustrates very well many of the prin- 
ciples to be kept in mind. The influence of such a lesson 
upon the pupils should be threefold. (1) They should 
acquire a wholesome respect for the masterpiece or subject 
presented and interpreted. (2) They should feel a desire
-P-A-G-E-131
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 125 
to penetrate more deeply into its meaning. (3) They 
should appreciate the contribution that it makes to the 
improvement of the individual and of society. The respon- 
sibility of awakening the interests of the pupils, developing 
their discriminating tastes, improving their intelligent lis- 
tening, and opening up to them the means of keener enjoy- 
ment of the better things of life, rests with the teacher. 
Therefore, the principles underlying the successful pre- 
sentation of an appreciation lesson must be thoroughly 
understood and carefully followed. They include: (1) 
thoughtful, intensive preliminary preparation on the part 
of the teacher; (2) his genuine enthusiasm; (3) careful pre- 
liminary preparation on the part of the pupils; (4) an im- 
pressive introduction of the subject; (5) an interesting pres- 
entation throughout; (6) the adjustment of the treatment 
to meet the levels and needs of each individual; and fre- 
quently (7) the creation of new sources of interest in the 
pupils. 
x. Hence, the first important principle of which the 
teacher must be cognizant, is the necessity of making his 
own preparation for the lesson a thorough one. Every- 
thing that has to do with the subject selected must be mas- 
tered. Even the life and thoughts of the artist or other 
person responsible for the material must be studied as in- 
tensively as possible. Then and only then can the teacher 
face his audience of pupils filled with his subject. 
2. If he expects to exert a deep and permanent influence 
upon the pupils his own enthusiasm must be genuinely 
evident. The subject must give him even more satisfac- 
tion and pleasure than he can hope to instill into his group 
through the lesson itself. 
3- The teacher must have prepared the pupils for the 
lesson. This preparation includes the building-up of an  
-P-A-G-E-132
126 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
apperceptive background in them, a foundation of knowl- 
edge upon which can be erected the structure of new mate- 
rials. There must have been created an interest in and 
desire for the lesson. Such technical material as will con- 
tribute toward a better understanding and can be treated 
previous to the lesson should be presented. In taking the 
precautions mentioned the teacher is applying the laws of 
learning treated in a previous chapter. Too much can 
hardly be said about this introductory step—the previous 
preparation of the class. 
4. The fourth principle brings us to the threshold of the 
appreciation lesson. The teacher’s opening remarks should 
develop in the pupils a mind-set, a pointed interest, which 
will make possible a powerful impression through the thrills 
and climax to follow. There are a variety of ways of creat- 
ing this immediate interest. 
The following examples will serve to illustrate some ap- 
plications of this principle. A foreigner’s description of 
his own country is rendered more interesting if he dresses 
in his native garb and surrounds himself with materials 
characteristic of his native land. The presence of a bowl 
containing goldfish insures immediate interest in hearing 
about them. Careful, artistic organization of the setting 
for a painting to be discussed—a harmonious color scheme, 
the use of contrast or some other device—attracts attention 
to the picture. An introductory sketch of the events in 
the life of Francis Scott Key will make an audience which 
is to listen to the ‘Star Spangled Banner” moreappreciative. 
5. The presentation must be in simple clear-cut English; 
the treatment should be organized so that it will be a natural 
and continuous unfolding of the account, interpretation, 
etc. This is the fifth principle to be kept in mind. It im- 
plies among other things that the appreciation lesson must
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 127 
be divorced from technique—“ You did not tear or hack 
the poem.” A digression into systematic analysis and - 
formal teaching of technique will prove fatal to the pur- 
poses of the appreciation lesson. Of course, with an 
advanced group an appreciation lesson might be concerned 
with technique—the structure of a poem, the art of the 
painter, and the like. 
6. The sixth principle is that the teacher must take into 
account the varying degrees of development of the aesthetic 
sense or interests of the pupils. The wide differences in 
the education and leisure interests of the parents, the 
home environment, travel, and similar factors affecting 
development enter into the situation. Also, the appreci- 
ation lesson must provide for continuous growth of the 
aesthetic sense in the pupils. Stagnation or stultification 
of interests must be avoided. 
7. Finally, the teacher should direct the emotions and 
interests which have been aroused in the pupils into chan- 
nels of purposeful activity, thus enabling them to profit by 
the application of the law of effect. 
In concluding the statement of principles, one further 
question which teachers raise needs answering—‘ When 
should the appreciation lesson occur in the presentation of 
subject matter?” It should be used, largely, whenever a 
deep appeal to the emotions is desired. Hence, the lesson 
may be introductory to a new situation, or it may be the 
conclusion of an old one. At times it will constitute an 
intermediate unit in a series of experiences. Often it will 
be a complete unit in itself. The important consideration 
to be kept in mind is that the procedure should be utilized 
when any learning situation will be economically and 
profitably enhanced by its use. 
The seven principles listed above will be expanded and
-P-A-G-E-134
  128 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
illustrated in the following pages which deal further with 
the place and use of the appreciation lesson in such fields 
as art, music, literature, history, and science. 
Very few of the children with whom we come in contact 
during our years of teaching will ever develop into great 
painters or sculptors. Surely, therefore, our purpose in art 
instruction should not be to develop superlative artistic 
skill. Only in so far as art serves our common needs are 
we justified in teaching it. 
When we are planning or selecting clothes, or a home, sat- 
isfaction is our guiding principle. This involves a consid- 
eration of appropriateness, attractiveness, beauty, and 
other qualities of design, color, and composition. The 
arrangement, furnishing, and decoration of our rooms, 
offices, homes, and public buildings require intelligence and 
appreciation of the artistic. In fact, everything that we 
create or construct out of materials should reflect the appli- 
cation of good art principles. Hence, the study of art in 
our schools should aim at the inculcation of the best tastes, 
a love for the truly beautiful, and a desire to improve per- 
sonal appearance and surroundings so that they approach 
the highest standards and ideals. 
Then, too, if we have been taught to appreciate the works 
of great artists, we have at our command another profitable 
and enjoyable way of spending our leisure time. How a 
great masterpiece can influence the lives of many people is 
evident in the almost countless interpretative uses that we 
see made of Rodin’s great statue, ‘The Thinker.” 
Since good taste and an appreciation of the artistic are 
such desirable qualities, they should be developed in our 
children throughout the period of elementary school train- 
ing at least. But if we are going to modify the attitude 
of our children toward art we must provide them with situ-
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 129 
ations which will bring them in contact with the best in 
painting, sculpture, drawing, and architecture. Pictures of 
the greatest achievements in these fields, reprints, or photo- 
graphs, may be used as the basis of appreciation lessons. 
But whenever possible the originals should be visited. The 
utilization of similar pictorial materials to illustrate facts 
in history, geography, and nature study, will be found to 
stimulate interest and appreciation in these subjects. His- 
tory, and the meaning of patriotism, will be made more 
real to them by such an activity as listening to an inspiring 
interpretation of ‘‘The Spirit of 76” or of French’s picture, 
“The Minute Man.” Niagara Falls, the Colorado Canyon, 
New York Harbor, ocean liners, and other works of man 
and wonders of nature are merely empty, meaningless 
words to most children unless they see and understand 
pictures of them. The city boy will obtain a realistic con- 
ception of the country and country life, and an appreciation 
of it as well, through pictures. On the other hand, city life 
will be better understood by children in rural districts when 
they see it depicted in paintings or in good photographs. 
The value of the appreciation lesson and its method of 
presentation can best be illustrated by an account of an 
appreciation lesson observed in a classroom. 
For several weeks the members of a sixth grade class had 
been collecting pictures from newspapers and magazines 
_ which gave evidence of the influence which the art of the 
past and present was having on attractive advertising. The 
pictures were classified and filed so as to present in historical 
sequence the original art creations partly or wholly used in 
these pictures. This material was used in various ways by 
the teacher as a basis for directing further activities. The 
particular lesson observed by the writer was based on the 
sculptures by Rodin. :
-P-A-G-E-136
130 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
All of the pictures obtained by the pupils which showed 
the influence of Rodin’s sculptures were studied with the 
purpose of finding out what thoughts they expressed. 
These thoughts were then tabulated and kept, to be used 
later, to see if the pupils could identify by means of them 
a picture of the statue that had been used as a basis for 
the advertisement. A period was set aside in which the 
class planned to play this game. But before the time 
arrived the teacher announced that she had obtained a 
very large picture of one of the most famous of Rodin’s 
statues, and asked the class if they would like to have her 
participate in the game by attempting to find all of the 
interpretations she could of this one statue. To this the 
pupils agreed. 
When the time came for making the presentation of the 
picture, the teacher first told the dramatic story of Rodin’s- 
life. When she found that the class was deeply touched by 
her account of the experiences that colored his master- 
pieces—the severe struggles and rebuffs that the artist 
faced, his indomitable courage and perseverance, and his 
final recognition—she presented to the class a very large 
picture of ‘‘The Thinker.” She then related some of the 
criticisms that it first received, and showed how these criti- 
cisms were replaced in later years by more constructive and 
appreciative ones. She concluded her talk with a very con- 
fidential and spirited interpretation of what the great 
statue meant to her. The silence which reigned in the class- 
room during her talk and after its conclusion was very 
expressive of the influence it was having on the children. 
Turning from this picture to others she began to draw out 
individual reactions to them. The “game” was a game 
no longer. For the rest of the period the pupils earnestly 
and thoughtfully discussed the several pictures.
-P-A-G-E-137
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 131 
Music in the elementary schools should function in very 
much the same way as art. The educational purpose of the 
teacher should be to appeal to the feelings of her pupils 
through music appreciation. If our past efforts, colored by 
a thoughtless tendency to make accomplished singers out 
of all children, have created the desire for much of the popu- 
lar music we hear today, then it is high time that we turn 
our attention to developing listeners who will demand better 
music. We must create situations for the enjoyment of 
good music. 
The children’s lessons in music appreciation should lead, 
first, to an acquaintance with the sources of good music— 
a knowledge of composers and interpreters; and secondly, 
to an enjoyment of and love for good music. ‘The pupil’s 
first acquaintance with a beautiful song should be made 
through hearing the song sung in a beautiful manner; it 
should never be through a series of symbols printed in a 
book or chalked on a blackboard. His second acquaintance 
with a song should be made in the same way, and his third 
also. After that it matters little what happens. He will 
have learned to love the song and his love will be hard to 
destroy.” (Hayward, The Lesson in Appreciation, page 133.) 
In one of the new modern courses of study a committee 
of teachers has compiled a list of suggestions for developing 
appreciation in good music. This list includes the following: 
1. Making use of school piano for programs given by a number 
of the class, a recital by members of the school piano class, a 
group of numbers by visiting artists, listening to -accompani- 
ments of songs. 
2. Giving selections on Victrola. 
3. Inviting an artist to come to school and give a program. 
4. Attending concerts by soloists, clubs, oratorio societies, 
choirs, opera companies, bands, symphonies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
132 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
5. Classes singing for each other in the same school. 
6. Schools singing for other schools. 
7. School bands or orchestras playing for own school or for 
other schools. 
8. Singing or playing for those at home what has been learned 
at school. 
9. While pictures of operas are on the screen and a child tells 
the story, music is played on the piano or Victrola; or members 
of the class have made a series of large pictures of the opera 
studied, and groups of children sing; selections learned, with or 
without dramatization. 
One example of these activities, observed recently, 
occurred as part of a school program. In it one of the 
classes presented as its number “‘ The Star Spangled Banner.” 
The number opened with the class assembled on the plat- 
form supporting a large American flag. One of the pupils 
told very briefly about Betsy Ross and the making of the 
first American flag. Then a second member of the class 
told about the experiences of Francis Scott Key. When 
the account had reached the incident in the composer’s life 
that made possible one of our great national songs the 
whole class sang it, thus concluding the number on the 
program. It was evident to the writer, that “The Star 
Spangled Banner” meant a great deal more to the whole 
audience because of this presentation of it. 
Another example of how effective the appreciation lesson 
may be made in the field of music was noted at a sym- 
phony concert presented for the children of a school system. 
One of the artists expressed to a member of the school 
department his personal feeling of dissatisfaction at per- 
forming for the children, because of the reception that audi- 
ences of school children had given the orchestra elsewhere. 
The music supervisor of the city remarked to the artist
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 133 
that he would in all probability be happily surprised by 
his audience. 
Throughout the whole program intense interest was 
apparent and quiet was broken only at the intermissions, 
by enthusiastic applause. This died down quickly when- 
ever encores were played. As soon as the concert was over, 
the artist approached the music supervisor and expressed 
his great pleasure and the sincere willingness of the mem- 
bers of his orchestra to play again for such a responsive 
audience. He then asked how it happened that these chil- 
dren were so different from the others for whom the orches- 
tra had played. The supervisor explained that during the 
weeks preceding the concert the children all over the city 
had made a very careful study of the organization of a sym- 
phony orchestra. The number and arrangement of the 
instruments had been discussed, and in some schools models 
made and arranged. Moreover, all of the selections, which 
had been carefully chosen because of their adaptation to a 
youthful audience, had been studied in advance. There- 
fore, when the children were assembled for the concert an 
appreciative interest had been thoroughly aroused, and 
consequently the program was keenly enjoyed. 
The appeal that literature makes to people is as old as 
literature itself. Almost all adults who read regularly or 
frequently have acquired an interest in literature that rests 
upon appreciation. The individual who has learned to 
enjoy the best from the pens of our great writers lives that 
which he reads. He understands, and, understanding, appre- 
ciates human kind and human affairs. The fact that 
he pursues this reading interest during his leisure time, and 
his growing attitude of sympathy and interest in his fellow 
men testify to his development as a thoughtful reader. 
The growth of this type of person is accomplished through
-P-A-G-E-140
134 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
activities involving the reading or hearing of inspirational 
stories. These activities should be begun far down in the 
grades. The more we turn to this type of presentation of 
literature the greater will be the number of children and 
adults who will read and enjoy good literature. 
The use of the story by a resourceful third grade teacher 
will serve to illustrate how the telling of an appropriate 
story may become a good teaching procedure. Her class 
had become interested in Holland, especially in the geograph- 
ical conditions which influenced the life and activities of 
the little Dutch children. The canals, towboats, windmills, 
dikes, and typical Dutch homes had been discussed. At 
this point the teacher told her class that she knew a story 
about a very brave little Dutch boy who lived near the 
dikes and asked whether or not the pupils would like to 
hear about him. A period was set aside by the class for 
this purpose. 
Previous to this time the teacher had studied thoroughly 
the story which she proposed to tell to the class. When 
the story hour arrived she related smoothly and with con- 
siderable expression the story of “The Little Hero of 
Haarlem.” So fascinating had been her dramatic presen- 
tation that on the following day the children begged her to 
tell the story again. This she did, and concluded by asking 
them if they would like to tell the story to her on the third 
day. Then followed a discussion as to how they could best 
do this. The group finally agreed upon a suggestion by one 
of the children to work out the story in the sandtable. Then 
followed the discussion and organization of the groups. By 
the next day there were completed in the sandbox three 
scenes: (1) the two children at play near the dike that was 
leaking; (2) the heroic effort of the boy checking the leak; 
(3) the arrival of help.
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE APPRECIATION LESSON 135 
An excellent example of reading for appreciation was 
observed in a beginning first grade class. About five weeks 
after the new term had begun the teacher felt that most 
of the group were ready for a primer. One afternoon she 
distributed the books without comment and permitted the 
children to leaf through the books. She found that they 
were not only looking at the pictures, but were also busily 
engaged in finding words that they knew. Soon many of 
the children turned to the first page and began reading the 
story appearing there. The teacher walked around the 
room, stopping to help individuals with words that were 
proving too difficult. 
During the days that followed, the children progressed as 
individuals, silently reading “The Little Red Hen,” and 
the other stories in the book. From time to time the 
teacher checked up with each child to see that he was really 
reading this first book understandingly. For study pur- 
poses she selected a second easy primer on the basis of simi- 
larity of vocabulary with the first one. This teacher had 
wisely fostered the children’s appreciation of reading in the 
first book by treating it throughout from the point of view 
of a medium for enjoyment and not as a task. The chil- 
dren’s love of this book and of others read in a similar 
manner was conclusive evidence of the value of beginning 
reading for appreciation with the very first book put in 
the hands of the children. 
Any teacher can think of countless other instances of 
appreciation lessons involving either story-telling or read- 
ing which illustrate the value of the appreciation lesson in 
these types of activities. Therefore it is unnecessary to 
include many examples here. 
The use of the appreciation lesson in the social studies 
and natural sciences can be illustrated by a variety of
-P-A-G-E-142
  136 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
examples. <A study of the Egyptian pyramids by a sixth 
grade class will serve to illustrate one excellent presenta- 
~=tion. Shortly after this class had begun a study of Egyptian 
history the teacher told her pupils about a close friend of 
hers who had spent considerable time traveling in Egypt 
and who had made a collection of pictures and slides while 
there. The teacher asked the children if they would like 
to invite this traveler to come to the school and tell them 
something about Egypt. After the children had decided 
what they wanted most to know about, they wrote letters 
to the teacher’s friend requesting her to tell them about 
the pyramids. 
The resulting illustrated lecture contained a great deal 
of first-hand information about the traditions and life of 
the ancient Egyptian peoples. By means of slides, the 
traveler was able to present very clearly the purposes, 
meaning, and uses of the pyramids. How profitable this 
appreciation lesson was to the pupils is evident from the 
following account by one of the children: 
A Trip To A PyRAMID 
When you go into a pyramid you have to go up a little path- 
way, which is built in the stone. It is only a foot wide, so that 
you have to put one foot in front of the other. This little path- 
way gets to be nine feet high. When you come to the entrance 
you have to get down on your hands and knees, for it is only 
three feet high. You go down this little passage for some way 
till you come to one that goes up, but the one that you have 
come down still goes down. When you get to the bottom of 
this one nothing is in this room. It was made to fool robbers. 
In order to get to the king’s chamber you have to get across the 
one that goes down. In order to do this the-guide takes you 
upon his back and jumps it. When you get across, it is very 
much easier to walk, for it is twenty-eight feet high. After you
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE APPRECIATION LESSON 137 
go along this for a little way you come to a little passage that 
goes off the main one. At the end of this is a chamber they 
call the queen’s chamber, but it was for a very dear friend of 
the king. If you keep on going along the passage that is twenty- 
eight feet high you come to the king’s chamber. 
Going up from the king’s chamber there are two air shafts, 
eight feet square. They are made to bring air into the room. 
Above the king’s chamber are four or five air chambers. They 
were put there to keep it from falling. 
In another class the children were studying about China. 
They wrote letters to a very well educated Chinese in their 
city inviting him to come to their class and tell them about 
life in China. The teacher presented their letters to this 
man and explained to him that he could make his talk most 
valuable to the children if he would tell them about the life 
of the Chinese child in his home, in school, and at play. 
She also suggested that if he had the toys and other objects 
of interest in the lives of Chinese children he might use 
these to illustrate his account. The effect of this careful 
planning was apparent when the talk was given. For over 
an hour the children listened with interest to the speaker’s 
account of child life in China and afterward they asked him 
questions for over a half hour. 
Careful preparation of a lesson in nature study will illus- 
trate the educative value of the appreciation lesson in this 
field. An aquarium and stand were placed in a classroom. 
Before the goldfish could be put into the aquarium it was 
necessary to make thorough preparations. Under the 
direction of the teacher the children studied about goldfish 
and also visited other rooms where aquaria could be found. 
Gravel, leaf-mold, soil, water plants, and the like were next 
collected. On a Certain day the supervisor of nature study 
came to the school and very carefully assembled all of the  
-P-A-G-E-144
1384/. MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Alfa materials for the aquarium, at the same time ex- 
plaining in detail what she was doing and why. From the 
time she put in the first materials until she finally had the 
fish swimming in the aquarium, the children watched and 
listened to everything she did and said. The aquarium 
has been a continuous source of interest ever since. 
A study of the various illustrations of appreciation les- 
sons which have been discussed in this chapter will disclose 
that the principles previously set forth as governing this 
type of procedure have been applied. These principles may, 
therefore, be used as a basis for judging the soundness of 
the procedure being followed. Another series of standards 
which overlap these and which add to them somewhat from 
the point of view of child participation may be found in 
How to Teach by Strayer and Norsworthy. These stand- 
ards are as follows: 
It is of primary importance that the teacher bring to the 
dass an enthusiasm and joy for the picture, music, poetry, 
person or achievement which he wishes to present; 
Children must not be forced to accept nor even encouraged 
to repeat the valuation determined by the teachers; 
Spontaneous and sincere response upon the part of children 
should be accepted, even though it may not conform to the 
teacher’s estimate; 
Children should be encouraged to choose from among many 
of the forms or situations presented for their approval those 
which they like the best; 
The technique involved in the creation of the artistic form 
should be subordinated to enjoyment in the field of fine arts; 
Throughout, the play spirit should be predominant, for if the 
element of drudgery enters, appreciation disappears. 
The above standards, together with the principles gov- 
erning the appreciation lesson, will simplify for the teacher 
her problems in making this type of lesson effective.

CHAPTER X 
The Drill Lesson 
The one type of teaching procedure which has been the 
most frequently employed by teachers is the drill lesson. 
But it is a most difficult teaching procedure to carry out 
correctly and because of this fact it has been greatly mis- 
used. Perhaps this last fact has led extremists in method 
to advocate its elimination from modern teaching pro- 
cedure upon the assumption that it is a non-essential type 
of attack when learning activities are intensively and ex- 
tensively motivated. 
Their contention that the solution of problems, the exe- 
cution of projects, and the participation in appreciation 
lessons constitute sufficient experiences to insure thorough 
comprehension and adequate learning, ignores the primary 
principle of repetition or recall in learning. Scientific inves- 
tigations of learning prove cot vely that in many in- 
stances economy of learning is secvred through drill. 
In the experiments by Wallin and by Winch conclusive 
evidence was obtained showing the need for more than 
incidental teaching of spelling. The investigations of Cook 
and O’Shea and of others indicate that direct instruction 
in spelling is necessary. Freeman’s statistical study dis- 
closes that pupils who had specific and directed practice in 
writing, were able to write decidedly better than those who 
had not. In the laboratory experiments in reading by Gray, 
he found that speed drills increased the rate of reading with- 
139 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
out appreciably changing the effectiveness.. Peters con- 
firmed these conclusions in other experiments. Thorndike, 
J. C. Brown, and Donovan independently conducted experi- 
ments involving drill in arithmetic, and each has reported 
that the groups exposed to drills showed marked improve- 
ment in skill and speed. Similar evidence has been found 
in experimental and statistical studies in the subject matter 
of other school subjects. All experiments point to (r) the 
need for drill, and (2) the economy of learning which results 
when sound processes of drill technique are employed. 
Even though we did not have scientific evidence to prove 
the need for drill, the experiences of everyday life involv- 
ing the varied activities of many persons are indicative of 
need for essential drill as a natural learning activity. When 
a new office-employee finds she must operate an unfamiliar 
type of computing machine, she recognizes at once that her 
general efficiency depends considerably upon the skill she 
may develop in using it. Therefore, she practices on it in 
her spare time until she has acquired a sufficient degtee of 
proficiency. The stenographer who recognizes that her 
employer and his business require the use of a vocabulary 
different from any in her previous experiences, knows that 
success in her new undertaking is more certain if she masters 
this new vocabulary. She compiles a list of the new words 
which occur frequently, and their corresponding steno- 
graphic symbols, which she writes repeatedly until they 
are firmly fixed in her mind. 
The laborer who daily wields a pick trains and develops 
the muscles of his body so that they will automatically per- 
form his work, with economy of time and energy. The 
successful manager of a large business, with its innumerable 
and varied demands upon him, organizes and follows an 
economical program of business routine. By so doing he   
     
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE DRILL LESSON 141 
conserves his time and strength for dealing with the un- 
usual but important matters which arise. In life-activities, 
essential skill is developed, uecessary habits are forme, and 
important facts are mastered through sufficient purposeful, 
intensive drills. In this way, the desired responses, of 
whatever nature, become automatic and consequently 
effective. 
When school life is organized as a series of real-life experi- 
ences, situations requiring drill inevitably arise. Rapid and 
accurate use of the multiplication combinations is acquired 
only by intensive drill and abundant repetition of these 
combinations in examples. Legibility and reasonable ra- 
pidity of handwriting are developed by carefully planned 
and thorough drills in penmanship. The successful and 
rapid knitting of a sweater is possible only when the various 
essential movements of the fingers and arms have been 
habituated. Just as there should be specific and directed 
practice on the fundamentals of arithmetic, in penmanship, 
or in needlework, so drill is necessary in learning to read 
rapidly, understandingly, and critically; in acquiring 
fluency and accuracy in oral and written expression; in 
forming hygienic habits of living, and in mastering other 
similar habits and skills. 
The real problem of the teacher, therefore, is not how to 
eliminate drill, but rather how to make drill lessons econom- 
ically and efficiently productive of desired ends. These out- 
comes include €he formation of right habits) the acquisition 
of desirable skills, and other requisite automatic responses 
to frequently recurring situations which will contribute to 
the development of a socially efficient person. Thus drill 
becomes a learning process which furnishes the automatic, 
essential, and recurring responses necessary in the interest 
of economy. Its purpose is to develop in an individual the
-P-A-G-E-148
  142 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
essential habits and skills which need to be used frequently 
in recurring situations. 
In addition to understanding the nature and place of 
drill in natural learning, the teacher must determine when 
and how to guide pupils into drill activities. The laws of 
learning apply to the drill lesson as well as to the other 
procedures. (1) The pupils must be ready for a drill lesson 
if efficient lear is to be the result; that is, the under: 
taking must promise satisfaction to them. (2) There must 
be interest and effort on their part throughout the activity 
or activities which provide drill. (3) In fixing and strength- 
ening a bond, habit, skill, or whatever other automatic type 
of response is being formed, the effect must bring satisfac- 
tion to the learners. 
The application of these laws of learning to drill pro- 
cedure may be expanded in terms of guiding principles 
which teachers should follow. . 
1. There must be sufficient motive actuating the pupil 
to render him anxious to form the habit or acquire the skill, 
or other automatic response. This is the step of motivation. 
2. He must have a correct idea of just what he needs to 
do and how he needs to doit. This is the step of focalization. 
3- He should exert a maximum of interest, effort, and 
attention during the acts of repetition. This is the step of 
repetition. 
4. His greatest effort should be centered on the most 
difficult parts. This is the principle of relative emphasis. 
5. The drill lesson must provide for adequacy and accu- 
racy of responses including all materials which essentially — 
and rightfully affect the desired bond being formed. No 
exceptions to the correct response should be allowed. 
a6: Repetitions must be provided over a period of time 
with gradually lengthening intervals between drills. 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE DRILL LESSON 243) 
7. The extent to which the learning is carried should be 
in keeping with the need that the pupil has for it outside 
of school. 
When teachers understand these principles thoroughly 
and practice them consistently and constantly in conduct- 
ing drill lessons, effective learning occurs. To assist 
teachers to acquire a clear conception of the principles, 
they will now be explained. 
1-"The first concern of the teacher is to see that pupils 
understand why the particular result to be gained through 
a drill lesson is necessary. In their activities they encounter 
situations in which they can continue their self-directed 
efforts more economically if they possess certain habits or 
skills. 
When children of the second grade play store, for example, 
they soon discover that they need to know how to add and 
subtract to become good ‘‘storekeepers”; that they must 
»be able to read if they are to be able to classify or find their 
“goods” “by means of the labels on them; and that they 
must be able to spell correctly in dealing with “customers.” 
Consequently, such pupils welcome the opportunities 
afforded by the teacher for drill on what they know are 
essential elements, until they reach modern standards of 
proficiency in learning. Such children know why they are 
undertaking a drill, see a definite use for the habits, the 
- skills, or the mastery of facts involved.” Withythese objec- 
tives clearly in mind and the need for them apparent, the 
_ children desiré very much to master them. Besides knowl- 
edge of the ends sought, insight into errors, and recognition 
of the time when the material learned is to be reproduced, 
an additional incentive to practice has been found in the 
effect on children of knowing the scores they achieve. 
The drill lesson, therefore, must be undertaken in answer 
xy Seite aa 
2 WS. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
to a felt need, a real and personal interest which makes 
instinctive appeal for mastery. To be functional to the 
pupils it must be motivated—purposeful and meaningful. 
The teacher must feel certain that the learning will be 
economical from the point of view of forming bonds whose 
values can be justified by immediate or real-life needs. 
2. When it becomes evident that the child understands 
and appreciates the need for drill, the teacher must guide 
him to see clearly just what he is to master and precisely 
how he should proceed in order to do his work effectively. 
He must not attempt drill work on something beyond the 
possibility of reasonably efficient mastery. It would be 
absurd to lead a class of third grade girls to attempt to 
develop skill on a sewing-machine in order that they might 
satisfy a desire to make a house-dress. But this of course 
would be a justifiable drill procedure in the sixth grade. 
This close adaptation of drill material to the individual 
child’s ability and needs is necessary to insure a clearer 
and fuller understanding on his part of just what he is to do. 
Also the pupils must be given explanations or directions 
sufficient to enable them to know exactly how they are to 
proceed. When the upper grade girls learn to sew on the 
machine they must know how to control the stitcher, hold 
and move the cloth without pulling it under the needle, 
and follow guides such as chalk marks and other directions 
essential to proficient machine sewing. In many drill les- 
sons it is worth while to conduct explanations even to the 
point of actually providing practice for the pupils until 
they become familiar with the procedure desired. 
3--Knowing what to do and why he is to do it, brings 
the pupil to the situation of drilling on that which he is to 
master. He undertakes his study voluntarily. It is essen- 
tial that the nature of his initial effort continue unchanged
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE DRILL LESSON 145 
throughout the drill. So long as his interest, effort, and 
attention are adequately motivated by his original purpose, 
this appeal should be utilized. However, in a series of 
drill lessons which extend over a long period of time it is 
often necessary to find additional motives. In so far as 
possible these should be as natural as the original one. 
For example, competing against his own record holds a 
pupil’s attention wonderfully well. Appeals to other play 
interests are valuable. The only safeguard to be observed 
in motivating drill is to make sure that the game or device 
provides for economical use of time and effort in the achieve- 
ment of the cereus rt as ends sought. Vari 
pup interest | minimizes the element of fatigue. Care 
must be ee somes constantly in the various 
drill exercises whatever is being habituated. There must 
be no doubt in the mind as to precisely what it is that is 
to be learned. When the young child learns to know red 
as a color distinct from some other, he is shown more than 
one red.object. He is shown red clothes, red houses, red 
automobiles, red roses, and so on, all of which appeal to 
his interest. Through such a series of experiences he learns 
to associate the word red with its appropriate color. Cor- 
rect form in letter-writing becomes automatic when pupils 
have actually written correctly many letters for various 
purposes to different persons. The many situations requir- 
ing them to repeat, in these exercises, a certain form com- 
mon to all of them, develops skill in using that form. At 
the same time, the different situations provide variety and 
new interest. The same amount of drillon a single type-form 
provided by the teacher will produce considerably inferior 
results.” 
Someone has said, “‘Secure zeal, interest, and concentra-    
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
tion of attention with short, snappy drills.” All drill exer- 
cises should be characterized by uninterrupted and inten- 
sive maximum effort for comparatively short periods of 
time. Ten minutes spent on different types of drill pro- 
duce better results than fifty minutes marked by inter- 
ruption, fatigue elements, and the like. Rarely should 
a drill exercise on a particular subject, for children in the 
elementary school, exceed fifteen minutes. Scientific 
evidence upon this point has established this limit to a 
high degree of reliability. We can therefore accept it 
with confidence. 
4. If the average teacher is told that she should not 
require pupils to drill on that which they know, she will 
remark “Of course not; who does?” Still, common prac- 
tice is marked by just such waste of effort. For instance, 
children who are drilling on the multiplication table of 
seven, taking each multiplication combination in order over 
and over again, are wasting considerable time. Some of 
the combinations of seven are more difficult than others. 
Some are more difficult for certain pupils than for others. 
Not infrequently, however, each child is required to repeat 
“Seven two’s are fourteen” as often as “seven eights are 
fifty-six.” 
Often spelling lists which children are studying contain 
many words which pupils are able to spell correctly before 
they meet these words in such lists. Occasionally all the 
pupils of the class may be found studying a word which 
practically everyone spells correctly, and they devote as 
much time to studying it as they do to one which is very 
difficult to all but a few. The reader is not to infer from 
these examples that pupils should not practice all the ele- 
ments involved in a drill. The need for doing this is ex- 
plained under the next principle. Most of.the time and
-P-A-G-E-153
THE DRILL LESSON 147 
energy of pupils’ drill, however, must be utilized to elimi- 
nate the difficulties or obstacles. The analysis of sources 
of error or weaknesses of pupils provides both teacher and 
pupils with the information which makes it possible to 
place the stress in learning on actually determined needs. 
With this in mind, a pupil should keep a record of his diffi- 
culties for individual study. The teacher should also com- 
pile a record of the common mistakes and needs of his class 
which should be included in its drill lessons. 
{onporaniy for individual practice on individual needs 
iSincluded in a good drill lesson. Besides drill on the very 
common general difficulties, pupils should practice to over- 
come their own particular ones. The child whose spelling 
lesson is perfect should give attention to other types of 
difficulties. The pupil who has failed to spell certain words 
correctly should study only those he has misspelled. Each 
pupil, therefore, is meeting his own and to some extent 
self-determined needs in this program. 
In a second grade class, careful observation of this sound 
procedure was noted. A list of twenty words had been dic- 
tated to the pupils to spell without their having previously 
studied them. The papers were collected and the mis- 
spelled words corrected by the teacher. Next she wrote 
the words on the board, arranged in order according to the 
number of times each word had been misspelled. Each 
child was informed of the ones he had missed and these 
were the words to which he was expected to give his atten- 
tion during the spelling study period. The children who 
had not made any errors in spelling took out their readers 
and began studying a lesson which had been assigned pre- 
viously. The following section of a chart indicates how the 
teacher prepared herself to make the drill lesson in spelling 
thoroughly functional.

  THE DRILL LESSON 149 
The first column contains the list of words in the order 
in which the teacher was to write them on the board. After 
these she placed on her chart the types and the number of 
misspellings. The third column contained her judgment as 
to the means of correcting the misspellings. The final 
column contained the memorandum notes of the way she 
proposed to obtain correct spellings in the cases where 
errors had been found. At the bottom of her chart the 
eight correctly spelled words were listed with the comment 
that intensive study on them was to be eliminated. 
Teachers should make use of the scientifically assembled 
and organized drill materials now available. For example, 
the Courtis Practice Tests in arithmetic provide effective 
means for discovering and overcoming the weaknesses in 
pupils’ use of the fundamental operations. If the directions 
for using these tests are followed carefully by the pupils 
they will learn more economically and efficiently than they 
will by means of the unscientific drill lessons planned 
hastily, perhaps, by a teacher. These tests conserve the 
teacher’s energy, too, by obviating the necessity of spending 
time to plan and write out drill lessons—time which can be 
utilized to better advantage in constructive work. Another 
example of economy in using drill materials is to be found 
in the graded lists of minimally essential spelling words 
such as are found, for instance, in the Ayres list. In using 
this material as well as any other in drill lessons, however, 
teachers must be sure that the children are experiencing 
meaningful and purposeful activities, that their interests 
are naturally and normally motivated. 
3 When the relative difficulty of various elements in a 
series such as occurs in the multiplication tables has been 
ascertained, the program of drill should be organized to 
include every member of the series. It is essential not only
-P-A-G-E-156
  150 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
to include “‘eight seven’s are fifty-six” and “seven eights 
are fifty-six,” but also to include these same combinations 
in a number of examples; e. g., “723 x 8,” “57 x 8,” and 
“28 x 7.” The whole of a poem must be memorized as 
well as those parts causing greatest difficulty. Writing a 
whole sentence correctly as well as mastering the particular 
structural or other difficulty in it is essential to fluency in 
written expression. 
In drilling on any one or all of the parts of a sequence, 
accuracy of response is very essential. If a series of repe- 
titions includes an error, that error becomes more thor- 
oughly fixed thereby. To eliminate it will require a greater 
effort than was necessary to have formed a first correct 
response. For instance, if a pupil has habituated ‘“‘seven 
and five are eleven,” he has to unlearn this mistake as well 
as master the correct response, “‘seven and five are twelve.” 
When a pupil frequently uses ‘I have went” this bond 
between “went” and “‘have”’ must be broken and the correct 
bond between “gone” and “‘have” substituted and habitu- 
ated in the expression ‘‘I have gone.” The failure of teachers 
to insist on accuracy of response in drill, because of the 
seeming energy expended in so doing, will eventually lead 
to the necessity of someone else’s expending a still greater 
amount of energy to eliminate these errors, at the expense 
of additional learning which such energy should be pro- 
ducing. 
6.“Scientific investigations disclose that the desired 
amount of skill, the formation of a habit, or the retention 
of information depends upon repetitions which are decreased 
in extent, over increasingly lengthened intervals. In order 
that pupils may subconsciously learn to spell a certain word 
accurately, they may be compelled to drill intensively on 
that word—perhaps two or three times the first day, once   
      
  
      
   
-P-A-G-E-157
THE DRILL LESSON I51 
or twice the second, once the third; then again at an interval 
of two or three days; once the following week; again a 
month hence; and so on, until correct spelling becomes the 
sole response when the word is written. Similar studies 
have disclosed the need of planning drill cycles over a 
period of several years in order to fix some of the very 
fundamental elements frequently recurring in life-situations. 
Spasmodic drilling has been found ineffective in the light 
of the automatic responses produced. Over-learning at the 
beginning, with subsequent ignoring of any further drill has 
also proved unsatisfactory. Hence teachers should seek the 
most scientific information in planning their initial and sub- 
sequent drill exercises so that over-learning and under- 
learning are avoided. 
7. The educational value of subject matter, the real life- 
need for certain habits, skills, and other types of automatic 
responses must govern the teacher’s judgment in deter- 
mining to what extent permanent fixation is desirable. 
Each drill situation requires this thoughtful checking. 
Obviously, if children are going to need, for a short time, 
skill in drawing a certain design, drill to the point of an 
acceptable product is necessary, but when the desired end 
has been achieved and use has been made of the skill, further 
drill on it should not occur. 
When a pupil in any elementary grade has achieved the 
accepted standard in penmanship for his grade, drill for 
proficiency in penmanship beyond this standard should not 
be given. The time and effort thus saved should be utilized 
upon real needs. Over-learning is as wasteful, in fact, of 
time and effort as under-learning is kn/wn to be. 
A very common example of attempts to attain a desired 
standard, at the expense of underdevéiopment in another 
phase of the same subject, is to be fourd in reading. Many 
\

  152 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
pupils are drilled almost to perfection in oral reading—in 
fact, to such a point that their rate and comprehension are 
seriously affected. The writer visited a third grade class 
whose teacher had won an almost enviable reputation 
because of the ability of her pupils to read orally. The 
Principal of the school boasted of the ability of this class 
in sight reading. Fifth grade readers which these children 
had never seen before were given to them. In turn each 
child opened his book, was told the place where the last 
pupil had stopped reading, and began. The regularity and 
ease of oral sight reading was astounding. At the-close of 
the performance the writer requested the privilege of ask- 
ing the children some questions. This was granted him: 
Just as expected, scarcely a child in the room gave evidence 
of having remembered or understood anything that he had 
read. Perfection in the mechanism in oral reading had been 
obtained at the expense of critical reading and thought- 
getting. The latter ends are more essential to life-needs. 
On the other hand, the one accomplishment which all of 
the children were developing is needed by very few indi- 
viduals in the realm of natural living. 
One of the best guides to determining desirable standards 
of achievement is the scientifically developed standardized 
test or scale. If the standards in these are accepted for 
pupils and classes, a considerable amount of over-learning 
and under-learning as well, will be eliminated from our 
schools. This sul ject is expanded in the chapter on scien- 
tific tests and their use and therefore needs only passing 
mention at this tinte. 
Not only should real-life and scientifically determined 
standards be kept in mind when the drill lesson is being 
efficiently developéd, but each of the products of such a 
lesson should find a place in the succeeding activities of

the children. When such uses or applications occur in 
pleasurable and satisfying situations, we are applying the 
law of effect to the learning process. 
The evidence that drill lessons become natural child 
activities and effective learning experiences under wise 
teacher guidance is to be found in almost any modern 
course of study which has been codperatively developed by 
teachers. Many recent articles in educational magazines 
testify to the way in which children’s interest and efforts 
in drill exercises have grown out of real-life situations which 
require some skill, habit, or other automatic response in 
the interest of economy of time and effort. Hence, only a 
few illustrations need to be included here so that the reader 
may have them at hand to study with respect to how the 
drill principles are applied in the classroom. 
The pupils of a fourth grade had undertaken an activity 
which required considerable letter-writing. When the first 
set of letters had been written, they were submitted to a 
committee of the class to select the best letter. When 
their choice was made, it was found that a new pupil who 
had entered the class for the first time that day was the 
winner of the honor. One of the older members of the 
class objected, on the ground that this pupil had not been 
in the class long enough to have become a member of it 
from the point of view of competing in the undertaking. 
The chairman of the committee replied that it was by far 
the best letter and therefore should be selected as such. 
The teacher took advantage of the situation to ask why it 
was the best. The members of the committee volunteered 
the information that it was (a) very neat, (b) well arranged 
and spaced, (c) very good in legibility, and (d) very satis- 
factory in its language. After a discussion of the latter 
phase, the question of legibility was again raised, and the
-P-A-G-E-160
  154 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
need for neatness, good arrangement, and proper spacing 
of a letter was debated. 
As a result of seeing the need for better penmanship, a 
plan for improving handwriting was developed in the class. 
The children learned how to score their papers on the Ayres 
scale for measuring handwriting. Each pupil made for him- 
self two charts on which he was to keep records of his im- 
provement. One was used for recording monthly scores in 
both speed and quality, as determined by the teacher, on 
the standard test. The other was used for recording weekly 
scores in quality, as determined by the pupil, on one paper 
selected by vote of the class from the regular work of the 
last two days in the week. The pupils were encouraged to 
compare other specimens of their work with those on the 
scale at spare times. A large chart was drawn on the board 
and graphs constructed to show how the poorest, best, and 
average scores in quality improved in the monthly tests. 
Drills were provided and the written work in other subjects 
was frequently checked for penmanship. Practically every 
child showed marked improvement in penmanship in less 
than six months. 
Ability to locate on an unlettered map of the United 
States the regions producing wheat, corn, rice, sugar, cotton, 
various fruits, lumber, coal, gold, iron, cattle, and so forth, 
‘was acquired by the members of a fifth grade class who 
seemed to obtain considerable enjoyment out of playing this 
game which they had invented. They would choose sides 
and compete by answering such questions as (1) “I bought 
wheat from ——?” (2) California is famous for ——?” 
(3) ‘“What do Iowa and Ohio produce in common?” (4) 
“Where are the great lumbering industries to be found?” 
A score of right answers was kept on the basis of the in- 
ability of one pupil on a side to respond correctly, plus
-P-A-G-E-161
  
THE DRILL LESSON 155 
evidence that the questioner on the other side knew the 
correct answer. This game required accuracy of question- 
ing and of response from all concerned. 
Another teacher of the same grade obtained drill on the 
same subject matter through a series of equally resourceful 
drill exercises. The pupils had constructed in sections, by 
states, a large map of the United States. They decided to 
convert it into a product map. Newspapers, advertising 
matter, and old magazines were searched for pictures which 
could be pasted on the maps. Some pupils drew and cut 
out of paper pictures which they needed but could not find. 
The products themselves, such as cotton, wheat, rice, corn, 
matches and copper wire, were obtained and glued to the 
map. Each child was held responsible for one or more 
states. Every day the pupils who had succeeded in finding 
considerable new material would hold up each article or 
clipping and ask who needed it. Others would answer, giv- 
ing the name of the state. This activity afforded competi- 
tion both in finding material and in recognizing where it 
came from in order to obtain it from the finder. Since a 
particular article is generally a product of more than one 
state, pupils had to be alert in order to be the first to claim it. 
The concluding example illustrates good silent reading 
drills using the blackboard. The first grade teacher asked 
her pupils if they would “like to play the game of having 
some one do something.” Clapping of hands indicated how 
much it appealed to the children. They came forward one 
at a time and whispered to the teacher. After she had 
written on the board each sentence that had been whispered 
to her, she called on some other pupil to act out what was 
written. The rest of the children eagerly watched to see if 
the response was correct. Some of the sentences written 
were as follows:
-P-A-G-E-162
  156 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Play you are a kitty. 
Run like a rabbit. 
Play you are milking a cow. 
When the children showed the least signs of tiring of the 
game, the teacher wrote on the board the names of ten 
children in the class. Turning to the pupils she said, “You 
are to put a line under the name of the pupil that this ap- 
lies to.” Then she wrote a question on the board. After 
a short pause she called on a child who answered by draw- 
ing a line under the name of the child to whom the question 
applied. Some of the questions were: 
Who has a yellow dress? 
Whom do I see with a black ribbon? 
Some one has a red and black sweater. Who is it? 
I see a girl with very black hair. Who is she? 
A third type of drill exercise used by this teacher is illus- 
trated by the action sentences she wrote on the board: 
Put a book on the chair. (Calling on some pupil.) 
Please give a book to Helen, Barbara. 
Another type was introduced when the teacher put a list 
of words on the board, such as laugh, with, come, run, sing, 
to, jump, play. She announced that she was going to select 
several pupils to write on the board all of the words to be 
found in the list which told ““what a boy can do.” Three 
children were selected while the rest watched closely the 
performance which followed. When each had finished the 
others discussed the answers. 
This variety of exercises included a number of drill ele- 
ments, but throughout thought-getting was constantly 
present.  
-P-A-G-E-163
  CHAPTER XI 
Natural Child Activities in the Classroom 
In each of the four preceding chapters, one major type 
of procedure was defined. Also, the principles to be ob- 
served in using each one as an effective means of promoting 
growth in pupils were presented. Illustrations from natural 
child activities occurring in classrooms were given to indi- 
cate the conditions under which a particular type of pro- 
cedure may be used and to exemplify how the principles 
are applied in learning. In every instance, it was apparent 
that the laws of learning were observed. 
At any given time, some one procedure is operative in 
anactivity. It is equally true, however, that total, effective, 
and economic learning occurs when a variety of procedures 
are intermingled in a series of normal, natural experiences. 
In life, particularly in the normal activities of mankind 
in the business world, we find innumerable illustrations of 
this fact. For example, a secretary seeking employment is 
confronted frequently with the problem of deciding upon 
one of several opportunities available. Having selected that 
one which seems to be the best, she is exposed to a series 
of appreciation lessons. She is told what will be expected 
of her, what responsibilities she is to have, the types of 
duties that she is to perform, what relationship will devolve 
upon her, and so forth. Next, she undertakes a series of 
projects and faces many problems to be solved. Letters of 
a specific nature have to be written; files are to be organized 
157
-P-A-G-E-164
  158 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
and maintained; and dther needs of the firm must be en- 
countered and dealt with satisfactorily. She soon encoun- 
ters experiences which contain new and constantly recurring 
phases. Certain information peculiar to the business needs 
tobememorized. Strange words appertaining to the business 
are frequently used by her employer in his correspondence. 
A few new types of office machines are in the office. To 
be an efficient member of the staff, she drills to memorize 
the vocabulary, to form the new habits, and to acquire the 
necessary skills. This series of natural activities consti- 
tutes an organized program of learning in which the various 
types of teaching procedure are utilized in securing indis- 
pensable growth. As each new situation is encountered, 
after successfully coping with the last, the secretary turns 
to that type of procedure which affords her the most 
economic way of learning and doing. 
The natural activities of adult life illustrated by the 
experiences of the secretary have their counterpart in child 
activities in a rightly conducted classroom. The purpose 
of this chapter is to illustrate to the reader how natural 
child learning may be guided in a classroom through a 
variety of teaching procedures, the basis of their selection 
being the economic and effective achievement of desirable 
outcomes. The solving of problems, the execution of proj- 
ects, participation in appreciation lessons, and the mastery 
of drill lessons are woven into a continuous series of real 
activities in a natural environment wherever child growth 
is occurring normally. 
“But when shall I lead pupils to change to another type 
of procedure than that which they are following?” the 
teacher asks. Her problem of selecting procedures is some- 
what analogous to that of the carpenter in using correctly 
his saw, hatchet, chisel, and plane. All are used to cut
-P-A-G-E-165
  NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM _ 159 
wood. In many instances, the same product can be ob- 
tained by using any one of the four. However, effective- 
ness in producing the desired result determines for the car- 
penter what tool he shall use. If a stake or wedge will 
produce the desired result, he does not resort to the slow 
process of shaping the object with his saw. Neither does 
he use his plane or chisel. Instead he obtains a satisfactory 
product very quickly with his hatchet. Oftentimes he faces 
cutting problems that only one type of tool can be used to 
do. When he is required to fit a rafter into place, or needs 
a particular width of board, the saw provides him with 
the most effective way of meeting his needs. If a small 
square hole has to be cut in a board or a close-fitting joint 
made, the chisel is used. If a smooth surface is required, 
the carpenter uses his plane. 
In other situations, he needs more than one tool to 
achieve his ends. For example, a small piece of flooring 
has to be so shaped that it will fit closely between two 
other pieces of flooring and be flush with a small projecting 
tile of the fireplace. The carpenter uses his saw to obtain 
the right length of board. Then, with his hatchet, he chops 
off the tongue of the piece which cannot be worked into 
the groove of the fastened board. He lightly planes the 
edge to insure a smooth surface essential to a close fit. 
Finally he chisels a right angle notch in one end of the 
small board so that it will fit around the projecting corner 
of tile. Thus all four tools are brought into use before the 
piece of flooring can be adequately and correctly prepared. 
Just as the skilled mechanic selects his tools according to 
the economic uses and ends sought, somust the teacher select 
hisprocedures, materials, and child activities according to the 
natural interests, normal economic efforts, and important 
outcomes which characterize socially efficient child growth.
-P-A-G-E-166
  160 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
We have seen in previous chapters that activities involv- 
ing the solving of problems or the execution of projects 
result primarily in the acquisition of useful knowledge. 
The information given consists largely of principles, gener- 
alizations, concepts, and particular views or conclusions 
based upon accepted general principles. It was pointed out 
that the drill lesson develops habits and skills, and other 
kinds of automatized responses, and that the appreciation 
lesson most often inculcates in the individual such results 
as ideals, standards, desirable prejudices, appreciations, and 
desires. Further recapitulation of the relation of type les- 
sons to outcomes is not necessary here. This reminder will 
suffice to assist the reader to recall other points. 
In addition to the need for a variety of procedures in the 
course of a series of natural activities, it is essential to the 
development of a socially efficient person that his experi- 
ences lead him into all of the fields in which essential sub- 
ject matter is to be found. Classroom activities which are 
marked by wise teacher guidance include experiences in the 
“three R’s,” the social studies, natural sciences, manual 
activities, physical education—in fact, the curriculum of 
many subjects treated in Part I. 
Hence, variety in a unified series of activities (1) requir- 
ing the use of the various types of teaching procedures in 
the interests of effective learning and (2) insuring rounded 
development through experiences in all of the subjects of 
the curriculum, characterizes natural child learning. In 
other words, natural, normal growth of children occurs in 
natural situations where normal interests lead to purpose- 
ful activities. Resourceful teachers guide the interests and 
efforts of their pupils so that all types of teaching pro- 
cedures are unified into a continuous series of essential edu- 
cative and natural experiences. There is, therefore, an over-
-P-A-G-E-167
  NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 161 
lapping of procedures or a subordination of one type or 
more to a particular type where normal learning conditions 
are maintained. 
For example, if a project is undertaken, minor projects 
and minor problems arise in the course of its execution; 
not infrequently appreciation lessons are utilized in con- 
nection with it; often the need for developing a skill or 
forming a habit is discovered in it by the pupils, and drill 
lessons, motivated accordingly, result. Again, when a large 
problem needs to be solved, the necessary information is 
acquired and assimilated by solving many minor problems, 
executing minor projects, enjoying appreciation lessons, and 
drilling on commonly recurring responses to needs. In other 
situations, activities involving problem solving or project 
execution grow out of interests created by means of an 
appreciation lesson. Sométimes a project grows out of an- 
other project or a problem. 
The greater the variety of effective procedures employed, 
the more interested the pupils become and inevitably the 
richer will be their experiences. In the course of the year 
the multiplicity of interwoven procedures will incorporate 
all of the essential subject matter prescribed for a grade. 
This presumes that the resourceful teacher is carefully 
checking up the progress of her class from time to time. 
Natural activities are permitted to continue as long as they 
are promoting the normal growth of the pupil. When they 
cease to do this, other natural activities are brought into 
use under wise leadership, so that continuous development 
is maintained. 
How natural activities are carried on in a classroom is 
illustrated in the following examples observed in various 
grades. 
The children of a sixth grade were given the opportunity
-P-A-G-E-168
  162 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
of taking complete charge of a school garden plot. The 
offer was accepted by them, and the project of growing a 
crop of vegetables to be marketed was undertaken. After 
writing their letter of thanks to the principal, they entered 
into a discussion which produced a large number of prob- 
lems to be solved. One of the first problems was “What 
shall we raise?” The solution of this problem required an 
extensive study of the vegetables commonly grown in the 
neighborhood, an understanding of the nature and produc- 
tivity of the soil in the school yard, and a knowledge of the 
right time of planting various vegetables. 
Some of the information was obtained by consulting 
books on gardening. Letters requesting pamphlets were 
written to florists, state agricultural officers, the agriculture 
department in the university. Speakers were invited, 
eagerly listened to and questioned. The supervisor of 
nature study, a very successful truck gardener, and a pro- 
fessor of agriculture contributed inspiration as well as 
information. Many letters of thanks had to be written and 
sent. This first series of activities ended with the decision 
to raise potatoes, lettuce, and carrots. 
“How much of each kind shall we grow?” and ‘‘What 
amount of seeds do we need?” represented the next types 
of questions to be answered. Consequently, the plot was 
measured and its area found. The cost of seed was obtained 
by a committee sent to the florist. The class decided to 
divide the plot into three sections. In one half of the area, 
potatoes were to be grown; in one third of the other half, 
lettuce; and in the remaining sixth, carrots. The follow- 
ing examples of additional problems which grew out of the 
children’s needs are indicative of the information which 
they had to acquire in meeting them and arriving at 
conclusions.
-P-A-G-E-169
  
NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 163 
1. Should the plot be divided into three long strips, three 
wide strips or in some other way? 
2. What differences in planting each type of crop must be 
taken into account in planning the division of the plot? 
3. What differences in caring for each type need to be con- 
sidered also? 
4. How must each plot be prepared and what effect will the 
preparation of it have on the arrangement? 
5. How can we be assured of a good potato crop, or lettuce 
crop, or carrot crop? 
6. How can we prevent the water from getting from the let- 
tuce patch into the potato patch? 
7. What insect pests attack the several vegetables and how 
can their attacks be prevented? 
8. How shall responsibilities be distributed over all of the 
members of the class? 
9. What was the total cost in labor and materials for planting 
and raising the crops? 
to. What was the cost per member of the class? 
11. How can the crops be marketed most profitably? 
12. What was the total return from the vegetables sold? 
13. What was the amount of gain per pupil? 
14. What was the per cent of gain on the investment? 
15. How can we use the profits wisely? 
16. What important needs of the class and of the school can 
our money meet? 
These problems indicate the scope of the project and the 
inevitably wide variety of experiences growing out of it. 
In order to solve the problems, many different types of 
activities were carried on. Some of the problems were 
solved directly out of the previous experiences of the chil- 
dren. Others involved very extensive learning situations. 
Under the wise guidance of the teacher, the pupils were 
led into many educational channels requiring the study of
-P-A-G-E-170
  164 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
arithmetic, language, spelling, nature study, civics, and 
many other subjects of the curriculum. 
, The executing of projects, exposure to appreciation les- 
sons, and motivated drill exercises constituted a series of 
activities just as essential to the purposes of the children 
as the solving of problems. They organized the class into 
a stock company. Officers were elected and committees 
chosen. Each pupil, the teacher, and the principal were 
allowed one share of stock in the company. For his share 
each person paid the sum of five cents and received a cer- 
tificate. The cost of undertaking the project was found to 
exceed the amount thus raised. An additional small amount 
was borrowed from the school fund to meet the necessary 
bills incurred. This loan was to be refunded when the crops 
were sold. Also, interest at five per cent per annum was 
to be paid to the school fund for the use of the borrowed 
money. Account books were planned, made and kept. 
Minutes of the meetings of the “Company” were kept and 
read. Reports of committees were heard and discussed. 
Such persons as a student of entomology, a gardener, and 
a business man addressed the ‘‘stockholders.” Drills on 
letter-writing, spelling, decimals, percentage, simple book- 
keeping, and the like grew out of the actual needs of the 
class. 
Another sixth grade class obtained very similar experi- 
ences in beautifying the kindergarten grounds. This was 
also true of another class which planned, built, operated, 
and kept a record of their activities in a model back yard. 
The following record of the construction of a floor block 
house in a kindergarten is illustrative of good teacher guid- 
ance of natural child interest and activities into prolonged 
efforts productive of desirable learning. One child arrived 
at school shortly after the new school term had begun and 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 165 
announced his intention of building a house. The teacher 
discussed it with him and suggested the possibility of get- 
ting other children to help him in his undertaking. Imme- 
diately, the child sought helpers and- collected a small 
group who expressed a desire to join in the “building.” 
Soon a group was busily engaged in building a house. 
The first product consisted of four bare walls enclosing a 
single room. In it, the group of children “played house” 
day after day, adding furniture as they found need for it, 
using dolls for “children,” making dishes out of clay, table- 
covers out of cloth and so on. In time, the one room be- 
came equipped as a living-room, bedroom, and kitchen. 
The “children” slept between pieces of cloth spread on the 
floor near the kitchen stove and the dining-room table. A 
piano stood near the pantry shelves. 
After this type of activity had continued for more than 
a week, the teacher called this group of children and the 
other members of the kindergarten together. A serious 
discussion and criticism of the playhouse followed. This 
proved to be a valuable appreciation lesson upon the home 
and its use. The purpose of the various rooms, their appro- 
priate furniture, their decorations and their essential con- 
veniences were unfolded. The desire to build a “bigger and 
better house” grew out of this tactful guidance and discus- 
sion. Also, a much larger group became interested in the 
second undertaking. Practically all of the children were 
ready for the activity. 
The one-room house was demolished and the materials 
put away. The pupils went home that noon with the inten- 
tion of finding out just what rooms they would need to 
have and what furniture belonged in each. The next day 
the new activity was entered into in earnest. 
_ It required weeks of codperative effort by groups of chil-
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
dren to erect the new playhouse and to furnish it. This 
large project required of the pupils the solution of many 
problems and the execution of many projects. Need for 
drill became very evident also. First, there was the plan- 
ning of a living-room, a bedroom, and a kitchen. Every 
kind of material which the children obtained proved adap- 
table to some purpose. In the living-room chairs, a table, 
a davenport and a piano were constructed of blocks; a vase 
was made of clay, and painted, and fresh flowers were kept 
in it; paper window-shades, a table-cover, and pictures 
were made; pieces of cloth were made into cushions, cur- 
tains and rugs. Similar materials were used to furnish the 
bedroom with beds, chairs, tables, dressers, covers, runners, 
curtains, rugs, and shades. The kitchen floor was covered 
with paper, upon which a simple square design had been 
crayoned to represent linoleum. Furniture was constructed 
out of wooden blocks; dishes and kitchen utensils were 
modeled in clay. 
Many interesting problems arose in the course of con- 
structing and furnishing the house. For example, the plan 
of the house had to be determined. ‘What room should 
be in the front of a house and what one in the rear? Why?” 
Also, ‘‘How different should the curtains be in different 
rooms?” ‘The differences of the various rooms had to be 
discussed in the light of this problem. The conclusions 
reached led to a satisfactory plan of draping the windows. 
White curtains with blue overdrapes were cut out, sewed 
and hung in the living-room; white curtains trimmed with 
blue, in the bedroom; and plain blue ones, in the kitchen. 
The hanging of the shades raised the problem of why we 
should have large open windows in the sleeping-room. 
When the house was completely furnished, front and rear 
yards were added, porches built and walks laid. Trees,
-P-A-G-E-173
NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 167 
plants, and a lawn sprang up in front of the house. A truck 
garden and a chicken yard were constructed in the rear. 
For many weeks, the house and its yards were used as a 
play center. Many of the activities of the family were en- 
acted, such as giving a dinner, receiving visitors, holding a 
birthday party for the “children,” decorating for Hallow- 
een and gathering vegetables. Once a week the house was 
thoroughly cleaned and put in order. The work of vari- 
ous members of the family and of the community were imi- 
tated. The teacher guided the children in their dramatiza- 
tions so that the best in home and community life was 
experienced. 
During this time need was felt for counting, careful paper 
cutting, drawing and other activities requiring drill exer- 
cises for improvement. Songs about the home and family 
life were learned and poems memorized. Such stories as 
“The Three Pigs” and ‘Brownies at Home” were told or 
read to the children. Pictures of fine homes and rooms 
were collected and a scrapbook entitled “‘Good Homes” 
made. The interest of the children did not wane until prep- 
arations for the Thanksgiving holidays were begun. 
The pupils of a third grade had undertaken the study of 
many lands by gathering the information for a scrapbook 
which they were writing and illustrating. It was given the 
title, “How Children Live and Play in Many Lands.” 
Each chapter of the book represented a country. In reality 
it became the material evidence that the class had solved a 
series of problems about each country; e. g., “How is the 
life of the Italian people affected by its geographical fea- 
tures?” The class program had been followed to a point 
where the Asiatic countries and those of southern Europe 
had been studied. The last chapter completed was entitled 
“French Boys and Girls at Home.”  
-P-A-G-E-174
  168 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
An invitation to a traveler recently returned from Hol- 
land had resulted in a fascinating account of how Dutch 
children worked and played. The following day the pupils 
listened to the teacher read the story of the heroic boy who 
checked the leak in the dike. ‘Hans Brinker” was read 
during the story hour. These appreciation lessons preceded 
the raising of the problem: ‘‘Why are Dutch children so 
brave, independent, thrifty, clean, and kind to strangers?” 
The information sought would also help to solve the pro- 
blem: ‘‘What are the geographical influences which affect 
the life of the Dutch people?” 
Many books on Holland were read, geography textbooks 
consulted and maps studied. The pupils reproduced in the 
sandtable a scene showing the dikes and lowlands, the canals 
and ditches, the truck gardens and dairies, and so on. 
“The Dutch Twins” was read and dramatized. In a 
variety of ways the pupils obtained and assimilated the 
information essential to solving their problem. About the 
time that they had completed the chapter in their scrap- 
book, “Chapter VITI—Hans and Katrinka of Holland,” 
they were ready to solve their problem. They had acquired 
such information as follows: 
1. The sea affects the lives of the people. 
a. It provides Holland with cheap and easy transpor- 
tation. 
b. The steady winds from it aid manufacturing. 
c. The continual struggle to maintain the dikes has 
influenced the character of the Dutch people. 
2. The many canals form a network of waterways. 
a. Transportation and communication is afforded by 
them. 
b. Irrigation is practicable and economical. 
3. The soil has been very rich.
-P-A-G-E-175
NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 169 
a. Farming is carried on in small units. 
b. Grazing is also an agricultural pursuit. 
4. Holland is very thickly populated. 
a. Hand labor is available. 
b. Many skillful trades have been developed. 
When this data had been organized the pupils drew a 
correct conclusion to their original problem. 
The fourth example is illustrative of how one type of 
procedure grows out of another when a teacher directs chil- 
dren’s activities so that they are purposeful experiences. An 
elementary school was equipped with a library of many 
books. The children were anxious to get into it, but 
teachers and principal agreed that the situation should be 
utilized as an educational opportunity. 
A series of appreciation lessons was planned and carried 
out, motivated for the sixth grade pupils by the thought 
that they could learn to manage the library for the school. 
The principal spoke to the class on “Right Conduct in a 
Public Library,” concluding his talk by leading the class to 
discuss the subject. The class invited the librarian of the 
children’s department of the public library to speak to them 
on phases of library work which would help them in their 
purposeful undertaking. Thehead librarian spoke to theclass 
also, concerning the technical phases of library work. 
Problems to solve and projects to execute were listed and 
a program of procedure developed. The children worked 
out a simple decimal system for classifying the books. The 
duties of a librarian were listed, and a schedule of library 
assignments planned to include every sixth grade pupil sev- 
eral times during the term. Some of the problems which 
would require solution were: (1) ‘What pupils in the school 
should be permitted to use the library?” (2) ‘What regula- 
tions are needed to govern the right use of the library?” (3)
-P-A-G-E-176
170 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
“How can we protect the books against misuse?” To dis- 
cuss these problems, a meeting of the school was called and 
various sixth grade pupils presented the problems and led 
the discussion of them. 
After the meeting, rules for the library were discussed in 
class again and sets ofrulesdrawnup. These were submitted 
to the other classes in the building who in turn reported back 
their criticisms and recommendations. When an accept- 
able draft was finally compiled, another school assembly 
was called. The rules were read, explained, discussed, and 
then adopted. They were as follows: 
RULES FOR THE LIBRARY 
Rule 1. The library will be open from 8.30 until 3.30 every 
school day. 
Rule 2. The library is for every child in the school who wants 
to use it. 4 
Rule 3. Each child may have two cards, one for non-fiction 
and one for fiction. 
Rule 4. There will be a librarian from the sixth grade who 
will help any child to find books. This librarian will also keep 
the library in order and see that all rules are obeyed. 
Rule 5. There must be perfect silence in the library. If any- 
one makes unnecessary noise, he will not be allowed to use the 
library for two weeks. If he keeps on being noisy, he may not 
come into the library for the rest of the term. 
Rule 6. Books may be kept for two weeks. If they are kept 
longer, a fine of one cent a day must be paid. 
Rule 7. If books are soiled or torn, a fine of ten cents must 
be paid. 
Rule 8. All books lost or defaced must be paid for. 
The reader can surmise readily the number of problems 
which arose after the library was opened. Many meetings 
were held, letters written, books kept in repair, disciplinary
-P-A-G-E-177
  
NATURAL CHILD ACTIVITIES IN CLASSROOM 171 
cases dealt with, and a system of keeping track of the books 
devised. The weaknesses of this system resulted in a series 
of activities. The original plan projected by the sixth grade 
pupils for keeping track of books taken out failed. The 
causes of its failure were listed, and ways of eliminating 
the weaknesses discussed. A new system was devised and 
explained to the other pupils in the school. Other weak- 
nesses were discovered and a third system developed and 
put into operation. Each revision resulted in meaningful 
language experiences and purposeful drill in penmanship, 
as well as civic activities and the like. 
In the above illustrations it is obvious that the teachers 
are subconsciously answering such questions as listed below. 
1. Does the activity provide for natural interests and pur- 
poses on the part of the pupils? 
2. Have the experiences fundamental educative values? 
3. Is the natural interest of children being sustained? 
4. Is the particular type of procedure being followed at present 
providing for economic and effective learning? 
5. Into what new channels for introducing new functional sub- 
ject matter can the pupils’ activities be guided? 
6. How can the environment of the classroom be improved 
so as to provide for pos enrichment and enlargement of 
experiences? 
These and similar questions will be treated in greater de- 
- tail in Part IIL, which deals with how to maintain efficient 
learning conditions.

THE ORGANIZATION OF CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH MODERN METHODS 
CHAPTER XII 
Planning the Work 
In Part I, the authors have developed the educational 
» elements in the background of classroom procedure essen- 
"tial to a clear understanding of the objectives, functions, 
d outcomes of teaching in the modern school. Part II 
‘contains an analysis of several teaching procedures, and of 
" the principles of learning underlying each type of procedure 
together with an adaptation of each procedure and its 
related principles of learning, in the classroom, to the normal 
interests and activities of children, showing in this way 
how learning takes place as a normal, natural, functional 
process. In Part III, the concluding division of this book, 
there are presented various aids to teachers in organizing 
and directing child learning so as to insure economy of time 
and effort of @sconcerned. 
The subjects treated in the chapters of Part III are ar- 
ranged in the order that experience usually brings them to 
| the teacher in the course of a year’s work.) As the begin- 
ning of a semester or a new school year approaches, the 
teacher must turn his attention to planning the work, first 
for, and secondly, with his class. This planning must pro- 
vide for the continuity of growth of the individuals and of 
the group.” Next, he must consider the organization of his 
program to insure a fair distribution of time in the interest 
of a well-rounded development of the pupils. Then, from 
172
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  PLANNING THE WORK 173 
time to time, he must (a) plan assignments for and with the 
pupils, (6) train them to study effectively, (c) guide and 
stimulate them through questionings, and (d) plan reviews 
which will unify and establish relationships between the 
experiences and materials. At certain times he will have 
occasion to use visual aids and also scientific tests. These 
two practical aids to the educational process are presented 
in the last two chapters. 
Upon an assignment to a new class, in beginning a new 
term’s work, or in introducing some new unit of subject 
matter, the teacher has to make definite plans. How can 
this be done so that his teaching may become most effective? 
What important factors and elements enter into such plans? 
How can they be put into practice? These questions are 
typical of the many which arise and call for an answer at 
this time. There is a reason for such thoughtful queries on 
the part of the teacher. A not inconsiderable measure of 
his success during the new period of pupil learning will be 
due to the carefulness and soundness of the preliminary 
planning. 
The many problems related to lesson-planning by the 
teacher fall into four large divisions. Each of these deals 
with an essential step in the efficient planning of the work. 
The four important steps are as follows: 
1. The teacher shou!.. acquire a thorough knowledge of 
the prominent factors, elements, and differences which enter 
into the nature and characteristics of the individual pupil, 
and of the class, and which indicate the degree of readiness 
for the educational experiences involved in the new work. 
2. He should determine the essential subject matter to be 
utilized in the new experiences, so that the outcomes essential 
to the desirable development of the pupils will be achieved. 
3- He should make preliminary plans for using various
-P-A-G-E-180
  174 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
normal procedures, or natural activities, which might be 
employed in the classroom in order to provide the experi- 
ences necessary for effective growth. 
4. He should consult with the class and plan codperatively 
with it the activity or activities to be pursued. 
The remainder of this chapter will expand each of these 
four points, employing actual illustrations to show how 
teachers have used such a program with profitable results. 
1. In preparing to work with a class, considerably more 
is necessary than learning the names of the pupils, ascer- 
taining their promotional status, determining their ages, 
and writing down their addresses. Every class is a unique 
cross-section of our exceedingly complex American life. The 
teacher who has made the greatest success of his work has 
recognized this fact and, therefore, has faced each class 
realizing that it provided a truly new experience. 
The teacher must learn what his pupils need, what 
resources they have upon which-he can draw in meeting 
these needs, what handicaps he must help them to over- 
come, what rate of progress he can expect of each individual, 
and what types of enrichment seem to be needed. This 
knowledge can be acquired by taking stock of (1) the com- 
munity, especially as it is represented in the class, (2) the 
parents and homes of the children, and (3) the children 
themselves. The totality of data thus accumulated will 
indicate any marked differences or likenesses in the group. 
Many teachers have been prone to overlook very signifi- 
cant factors about the communities in which their pupils 
“»live—factors which are exerting a powerful influence in the 
‘ children’s lives, and are creating dominant educational 
needs. Table I on the following page contains a few of 
the variable elements illustrative of some significant com- 
munity differences.

School communities A, B and C were selected at random 
‘from the same city. One needs but stop and think of some 
general characteristics of a semi-urban, or of a rural com- 
munity to realize other great differences not represented in 
the three vastly unlike communities presented in this table. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Geographical factors, traditions, and the like, inevitably 
introduce new problems in planning the work. A brief 
analysis of the illustrations will suffice, however, to indicate 
how the teacher should proceed. 
On the basis of this data alone it is obvious that three 
teachers assigned to fifth grade classes in the three re- 
spective communities’ schools would have to make very dif- 
ferent plans. Teacher A has to plan for pupils who come 
from distinctly American homes occupied primarily by 
native-born, English-speaking people of the white race. 
This decidedly American community is the residence dis- 
trict for well educated and highly successful professional or 
business men. The atmosphere of their homes is one of 
refinement and culture. Many books and magazines com- 
prise an important part of the supplementary educational 
material available to these children. The families are 
small. The parental aim for the future of these children 
includes the highest type of elementary and secondary edu- 
cation, as well as the further advantages of university 
training. 
Teacher C, on the other hand, planning for pupils who 
have reached the same school grade, must take into account 
very different factors. The pupils come from the homes of 
the foreign born. The parents are mainly non-naturalized 
Italians, Portuguese, and Slavs, who live among peoples of 
their native countries, speak their native languages and live 
according to their native customs and traditions. Most of 
the fathers are employed as unskilled laborers. Many of 
the mothers are also working. Very little, if any, good liter- 
ature or Americanizing material finds its way into their 
homes. The families are large and the educational oppor- 
tunities of most of the children are confined to a few years 
in school. Not infrequently, these parents try to take their  
-P-A-G-E-183
  PLANNING THE WORK 177 
children from school so that they may work and contribute 
to the support of the home. 
The pupil common to Teacher A is the uniquely excep- 
tional one in Teacher C’s school, and vice versa. The gen- 
eral backgrounds, interests, views on life, needs, problems 
and aspirations differ vastly. A course of study can only 
serve as the point of departure in the teaching of each of 
these two groups. All that can be considered in common 
consists of a core of minimal essentials and some similar 
types of child interests and activities, around which vastly 
different programs must be constructed. 
Teacher B has a more difficult program to construct, per- 
haps, because of the greater complexity of the community 
she serves. Her pupils come from city homes of almost 
every description. The pupils are descendants of different 
races, and of peoples from many lands. The adults have 
diversified citizenship interests, different industrial points 
of view, and a precarious financial outlook. In addition to 
the few parents representing each extreme in home condi- 
tions, there is a larger group of skilled mechanics, small 
store owners, and business executives. This group is in it- 
self complex, educationally and otherwise. 
Each of these teachers, then, must make very different 
plans for a term’s work in the same school grade, solely 
because.of the marked differences in these three communi- 
ties in the existing influences, interests, activities, and pos- 
sibilities, all of which are reflected in the lives of the chil- 
dren. Much that has been indicated concerning the factors 
of community differences applies to the effect of the homes 
and the parents on the teacher’s program. Of course, the 
problem here is largely that of discovering the individual 
differences in a class which result from home conditions. 
A study of the parents unfolds to the teacher a basis for
-P-A-G-E-184
  178 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
understanding the interests, attitudes, pleasures, activities, 
and educational development of the individual children in 
a class. One illustration will serve to indicate the value of 
utilizing the information which can be obtained about the 
home and the parent. 
In the class located in Community B, one pupil is the 
son of a university graduate and successful attorney. The 
boy’s mother also graduated from a college. Every com- 
fort that one might want is to be found in this home. 
There is a very large collection of books to which new pub- 
lications are frequently added. One professional magazine, 
one dealing with home economics, one scientific journal, and 
several literary journals are received regularly. Both father 
and son collect stamps as a hobby. All three persons in 
the home are good musicians. Very expensive and well 
selected paintings adorn the walls of the various rooms. 
Another pupil in the same class is the son of a book- 
keeper. The father completed two years of a commercial 
course in high school and later, while working in an office, 
attended night school in a business college to study book- 
keeping. The child’s mother is a high school graduate. 
Their modest home contained the essential furnishings and 
nothing more. Because of the child’s interest in reading, 
the one magazine subscribed for was a well-known boys’ 
magazine. The library in the house consisted of books 
which had been received as birthday or Christmas presents. 
The families of both of these boys were American born. 
But even though their parents happened to have common 
religious affiliations, political party interests, and fraternal 
memberships, the educational needs of the two boys dif- 
fered widely. 
Suppose the subject of science and the materials dealing 
with it were being planned. The teacher would have to
-P-A-G-E-185
    
PLANNING THE WORK 179 
supply learning opportunities in the case of the latter boy 
which were already enjoyed by the former. At the same 
time she would have to find ways of enriching still further 
the learning of the more fortunate pupil. Different reading 
material constitutes one of the points of variation for these 
individuals. This is only one of many similar problems of 
meeting the needs of individuals from different homes. 
Doubtless many others will occur to the reader. 
In addition to the differences due to the influence of dis- 
similar communities and homes, there are differences due 
simply to the nature of the individual pupils. Not infre- 
quently twins vary widely in intelligence, in interests, in 
rate of progress in school, and in physiological development. 
How much greater will be the differences in pupils from 
different families, although the children may be in the same 
grade in school. 
The table showing the strongest and weakest sections of 
a class, presented in the chapter on the subject of scientific 
tests, illustrates clearly the fact that each pupil is a unique 
individual. Another illustration of this point is to be noted 
in the various items of the table on the following page. 
An inspection of this table will readily disclose how vastly 
different the three children are, in spite of the fact that all 
are to begin seventh grade work at the same time and, pre- 
sumably, in the same class. Nevertheless, if each pupil is 
to learn effectively, differences in terms of their individual 
needs in the various subjects must be provided for, if pos- 
sible, in the teacher’s program. Further evidence of the 
necessity for so dealing with every class need not be in- 
cluded here. It is sufficient to note in passing that the same, 
or even greater, variation exists in nearly every class and 
grade, and needs to be taken into account.

to plan a program adapted to it. By means of a series of 
studies, which do not require a very great time to make,, 
the teacher is able to determine what experiences these! 
pupils have in common. The course of See fot the pre- 
vious grade will indicate this in a general way. What the 
new experiences shall involve indudes the essentials set 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
PLANNING THE WORK 18r 
forth in the course of study for the present grade, together 
with the essentials of previous grades in which these pupils 
as individuals or comparable groups have been found lack- 
ing. This information will indicate to the teacher what 
general outcomes and standards she should seek to achieve. 
But departures must be made from the course of study in 
terms of individual needs and even of class needs, in order 
that each child may continue to grow in an all-around way. 
Having completed this phase of planning his work, the 
teacher is able to undertake the third step. 
3. The third step in planning the work consists of think- 
ing through various types of child activities which might 
be utilized as a means of affording the pupils such experi- 
ences in the classroom that the desired learning will occur. 
Natural child activities involving normal child interests 
must form the basis of every learning process. When these 
are combined with the essential subject matter into a series 
of experiences, learning in the classroom will be effectively 
achieved. The various chapters in Part II contain so many 
illustrations of these types of activities that repetition here 
is not necessary. When tentative plans of how the children 
might like to undertake the study of the subject matter— 
by solving problems or executing projects or the like—have 
been made, ‘the third step will have been completed. 
4. The teacher is now ready to undertake the fourth and 
final step in planning the work. This is an activity in which 
the pupils have a definite part.” In determining the plan 
of work to be followed, especially in the upper elementary 
grades, teachgr_and pupils should discuss the actual needs 
to be met. [ine children should understand their own 
strength andUheir own weaknesses in order to appreciate 
their individual reid Th average child is interested in 
his own progress. He gains the greatest satisfaction out of
-P-A-G-E-188
  182 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
success. His interests and ambitions enter into many of his 
activities outside of school and they should find a place also 
in the classroom. Se 
The plan of work must therefore include the subject 
matter which each individual needs to study, and also that 
which the class as a whole must learn. In addition, the 
group must agree upon some activity, or activities, which 
will afford the experiences in which the children express a 
desire to engage, and which at the same time can be directed 
by the teacher into the channels of learning he has deter- 
mined upon as essential to growth. It isa safe rule to follow 
the most popular bent of the pupils, if their proposal has 
sufficient elements in common with any one of the tentative 
activities thought of by the teacher previous to meeting 
the class. 
A principle discussed at length in the various chapters on 
procedure needs to be recalled and applied to the planning 
of the work. |The activity which is to be employed in the 
classroom must be one which the children will undertake 
readily and with enthusiasm.) Therefore, it must be one 
which they have suggested, or one which the teacher has 
suggested and they have agreed to adopt as their own. 
Only when one of these two situations has been developed 
will adequate motivation be present. 
The length of time and the amount of energy required 
in planning the work are not so great as they may appear 
to be from the foregoing explanation of the procedure. 
Even if they were much greater, the resulting economy of 
time and effort for both teacher and pupil during the ensu- 
ing term would justify the careful planning. One of the 
major sources of the difficulties in which teachers frequently 
find themselves has its inception in the inadequacy of pre- 
liminary planning. Thoughtful planning makes possible the   
     
-P-A-G-E-189
  
PLANNING THE WORK 183 
sound teaching of the children through carefully selected 
and evaluated activities. Some illustrations of how plans 
have been developed by teachers in various grades will now 
be given. 
A teacher of a sixth grade located in a city community 
not so highly select as Community A and yet decidedly 
American in complexion and interests, carefully followed 
the steps already discussed in planning a term’s work. 
Some of the factors she noted about her class will serve to 
illustrate how she developed the plan to be followed. 
Although the community was decidedly native American, 
there was a sufficiently large number of foreign born whites, 
some of whom were not naturalized, and were in need of 
specific attention from the point of view of Americanization. 
Some few children from these latter types of families were 
in her class. The occupations of the fathers were varied, 
and the range of the children’s interests was consequently 
wide. The individual\pupils presented variability even 
greater than that apparent in the three cases presented in 
Table II. Among the subjects which these pupils had 
studied previously, in the fifth grade especially, were: ele- 
mentary history of the United States; the geography of 
North and South America; spelling of words selected from 
the Ayres’ List; composition, involving paragraphing and 
the simple connected story; and the reading of several 
school readers and a number of biographies. 
According to the course of study for the sixth grade, the 
class was to study the background of early American his- 
tory. In geography, the continents in the Old World were 
to be studied, with special stress on Europe. In spelling, a 
minimal list of words was prescribed, most of which were 
in the Ayres’ List. The boys were to begin their second 
year of manual training, and the girls their second year of 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
184 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
home economics. The same general type of language work 
as was done in the fifth grade was to be continued in the 
sixth grade. 
The teacher decided that a large part of the subject matter 
of the various subjects could be developed in a scrapbook, 
to be prepared and kept by each child, and that a floor map 
of the Mediterranean region could be worked out. Writing 
and presenting a series of historical and geographical plays 
would offer a third type of work. With these tentative 
plans in mind, she took up the further planning of the work 
with the class. After a discussion of the needs of the pupils, 
and an understanding of what they should learn in order 
to complete the work prescribed, she asked them how they 
would like to carry on the new term’s work. It soon became 
very evident that what these pupils wished to do most of 
all was to write and present a pageant. This they decided 
to call ‘‘Progress.” 
Then definite planning began. “After much discussion 
and study,” reported the teacher, “‘it was decided that this 
pageant should comprise the following: (1) Dialogue 
(Dramatization), (2) Costumes, (3) Stage scenery, (4) 
Music, (5) Dancing.” 
As the pupils studied the various subjects, they devel- 
oped the pageant. This meant planning the work in manual 
training, home economics, art, history, geography, language, 
and reading so that these subjects would contribute to the 
‘activity constituting the major interest of the class. Need 
for spelling, penmanship and other drills grew out of the 
work. Some of these needs were specific ones determined 
for certain individuals, while others were found to represent 
difficulties which most of the class had to overcome. 
The evidence of the success resulting from careful plan- 
ning is found in the teacher’s report:
-P-A-G-E-191
  PLANNING THE WORK 185 
The whole project grew into a much bigger piece of work than 
was ever intended at its inception. From time to time new ideas 
were introduced and new departures from the original plan were 
attempted. Instead of being completed in one term, a whole 
year was required to finish the entire pageant. . . . It is my 
sincere conviction that they (the pupils) never could have gained 
the knowledge that they did with greater appreciation or 
enthusiasm. 
“The Progress of Civilization,” as the pageant was called, 
finally was presented to several audiences because of the 
general community interest that it had aroused. 
Sometimes a teacher may find that her tentative plan- 
ning will have to be modified considerably more than the 
sixth grade teacher just cited had to modify hers. A case 
in point was that of a second grade teacher who had planned 
that the term’s work should consist of a study of primitive 
child life through a series of dramatizations or similar activi- 
ties. When she was ready to discuss the plans with her 
class, she was surprised to find the children uninterested. 
One of her former pupils had recently transferred to a city 
across the continent. Before leaving he had told the class 
about his proposed trip through the Panama Canal. Because 
of this the interest that had been aroused in the class cen- 
tered around traveling. After much discussion the teacher 
found her class ‘‘set” on taking an imaginary trip. After 
all, the purpose of studying primitive child life is to con- 
tribute to a better understanding and appreciation of home 
and family life. Would not an imaginary trip to the homes 
of children in foreign lands serve this same purpose? The 
teacher decided that it would, and so plans were made for 
taking the imaginary trip. The planning and resulting 
activities involved valuable educational experiences in read- 
ing, language, spelling, art, music, nature study, arithmetic,
-P-A-G-E-192
  186 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
folk-dancing, civics, and the geography centering around 
child life in many lands. Many minor plans grew out of 
the major one. Some of these were: planning a series of 
geography booklets, planning a number of sandtable rep- 
resentations, and planning a world’s fair. 
The same geographical subject matter was used by a 
third grade teacher as a core in planning similar work. She 
discussed with her class what this second grade class was 
attempting to undertake. After several days had elapsed, 
she again raised the subject. This time she found her class 
well informed of what the second grade pupils were doing. 
Not only was there an enthusiastic desire on the part of the 
third grade pupils to begin similar activities, but they were 
ready with a wealth of new ideas for undertaking the 
activity. 
How a fourth grade teacher developed with her class a 
plan for studying nature study by utilizing a nearby park — 
illustrates how a resourceful teacher plans extensively and — 
then takes advantage of opportunities as they arise. Among | 
a series of tentative plans which she had made for various 
fourth grade classes in the school, she had always listed this 
particular type of study, with such suggestive ways of car- 
rying it out as reproducing the park in miniature in the 
sandbox, making a paper drawing of the park on which 
was to be located the various trees, plants and the like, and 
writing a booklet entitled, ‘What We Have in Our Park.” 
Soon after the opening of a certain school, the principal 
received a communication from the park commission de- 
ploring the way in which the pupils in the neighborhood 
had misused the park and playground. The same com- 
munication had been sent to all the other schools. The 
fourth grade teacher obtained the letter from the principal 
and asked one of the pupils in her class to read the com-

munication to the others. Then followed a discussion which, 
to her surprise, culminated in a suggestion that the class 
form itself into a “Junior Park Commission” to assume 
responsibility for striving to improve conditions at the 
neighboring park. This was agreed upon. The resulting 
plans involved a series of activities that included and went 
far beyond all of the subject matter that the teacher had 
long hoped to incorporate into a similar class activity.

  CHAPTER XIII 
The School Program 
In connection with planning the work of a school, which 
was discussed in the preceding chapter, the teacher faces 
also the problem of determining the relative amount of 
time which should be devoted to each of the various sub- 
jects—one of many factors which enters into the making 
of a school program. First of all the teacher must deter- 
mine in the plan of work what would seem to be a reason- 
able amount of subject matter to be treated during a term! 
Then provision must be made in the program for each of the 
subjects of varying relative importance among which the 
subject matter is distributed. Furthermore, some subjects 
which are considered of approximately equal educational 
value, require varying amounts of time for mastery because 
of their very nature. In such instances the factor of relative 
difficulty is prominent, and in addition the nature of the 
class, its strength and weaknesses, collectively and individ- 
ually, increases the necessity for a careful and specific dis- 
tribution of time. 
On the other hand, there is a fixed limit to the total 
amount of time available. The school term consists of a 
definite number of days, each of which contains a definite 
number of hours during which the teacher may work with 
his class. Within the time limits thus rigidly set, the dis- 
tribution of time for each subject must be made. The mak- 
ing of the school program, therefore, must proceed simul- 
188   
     
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE SCHOOL PROGRAM 189 
taneously along two lines. In other words, the problem of 
program making assumes a twofold aspect and its solution 
must be in terms of both. ‘The time allotment of all subject 
matter to be included must be planned._in the light of what 
is to be accomplished during the term or in some other fixed 
amount of time, and at the same time a daily schedule must 
be organized, so that economic procedure will be assured. 
Of course, each of these two types of schedule needs to be 
modified from time to time according to the variations in 
progress by the class and by individual pupils. 
Courses of study ordinarily offer some guidance to 
teachers in the matter of planning a program for accom- 
plishing the term’s work., In modern school systems, 
teachers are aware, of course, that the suggested distribution 
of time is for guidance only. Variations must be made in 
terms of particular situations. No class ever presents the 
average situation which such time allotments are planned 
to meet. 
The reader can readily appreciate this fact from the evi- 
dence accumulated by Holmes in his study of the programs 
of representative cities! The data disclosed that the dis- 
tribution of time for the various subjects, throughout the 
country has not been determined with any degree of reli- 
ability. Extreme variations were very marked. For ex- 
ample, he found that the weekly time allotment for third 
grade music varied from 15 minutes to 75 minutes, and, 
more startling than this, that the weekly allotment forsecond 
grade reading varied from 120 minutes to 374 minutes. . 
What standard is the teacher to follow in the distribution 
of time among the various school subjects if such marked

variations occur in different systems? It is true that if at 
a particular time, say the present school year, the average 
of a fairly large number of representative programs were 
obtained, the effect of such extremes as might occur would 
be modified considerably. The average of a large number 
of distributions in the allotment of time may be assumed 
to be a reliable guide. Such a program can be derived from 
the investigations of Holmes. Table III contains the dis-

lion’s share of attention.” He found, also, that the greatest 
variations in time allotments occurred in these subjects. 
This study was made in 1914. Since that time marked 
changes have been introduced into the field of elementary 
education, owing to the scientific determination of what to 
teach, where to teach it, and how to teach it. The recent 
changes in the programs of many progressive elementary 
school systems would now modify considerably the aver- 
ages presented in Table III. One of the most outstanding 
progressive, modernized school systems, in planning its new 
courses of study to include the accepted results in educa- 
tional investigations, thinking, and practice, modified these 
averages as indicated in Table IV. In all probability, this 
program is one of the best guides for a teacher to follow, 
when conducting his work according to the procedures pre- 
sented in this book. 
A comparison of the distributions of time in the two 
tables will disclose to what extent the total’ allotment has 
been reduced in some subjects and how the time thus gained 
has been redistributed among the others. This modification 
was due to the fact that natural activities of children were 
to form the basis of learning in the classrooms. Hence, sub- 
ject matter was given emphasis according to the place it 
had in these activities, and to its functional values in life 
situations. This type of program, too, was planned to meet 
such school conditions as (1) three teachers per grade, (2) 
two teachers per grade, (3) one teacher per grade and {4) 
two teachers for six grades, as the classroom situations 
varied from large urban to rural school types. 
After the new time allotment had been tested in practice 
for approximately two years, the teachers in many instances 
departed from it. | Not infrequently these variations in the 
time schedule weré“due to the teacher’s understanding of
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE SCHOOL PROGRAM 193 
her particular problem and her ability to make the modifi- 
cations necessary to meet it. One illustration will serve to 
indicate the desirability of such a procedure after careful 
study of the specific situation. 
A sixth grade teacher in one of the schools was following 
a program which contained several marked deviations from 
the general one. For instance, she was allotting thirty min- 
utes less per week to arithmetic and twenty-five minutes 
more per week to reading. These variations, she explained, 
were made to meet the essential needs of her class. By the 
application of intelligence tests she had found her class to 
consist very largely of pupils of very superior mentality; 
there were also a small number of normal intelligence and 
two who were slightly below normal. 
At the close of the previous term, the results in a stand- 
ardized arithmetic test had showed that almost all pupils 
were achieving up to capacity. Their mastery of fractions 
was exceptionally good. Hence, practice exercises at inter- 
vals, together with problems raised in the classroom, were 
the only continued experiences necessary for desirable future 
growth in arithmetic. With the exception of a small group, 
the same condition existed with respect to reading achieve- 
ments. 
‘After the pupils had entered into their new activity—the 
project of determining a satisfactory budget for a family of 
five—their earnest attack on the drill work in decimals and 
percentage had produced such a facility in this work that 
effective arithmeticlearning wasaccomplished in less allotted 
time than was generally provided and required. 
On the other hand, although books were plentiful in the 
children’s homes, the types of books holding the place of 
prominence in these homes were not very desirable from the 
point of view of style and content. The’influence of these
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
books upon the tastes of the children had become so marked 
that the teacher felt something needed to be done to counter- 
act it. Therefore, she took most of the time saved from 
arithmetic and allotted it to reading. With the increased 
time of the reading period, she planned to direct the pupils’ 
selection of reading material from a library codperatively 
built up in the classroom. Having adequate time to super- 
vise this reading, she was developing their literary tastes. 
When it was pointed out to her that a time would prob- 
ably come when this extra time would not be needed any 
longer for reading and, at the same time, would not be re- 
quired for the arithmetic work, she replied that she expected 
that condition to exist soon. In fact, she hoped that such 
a situation would arise very soon, because she wanted to 
transfer the extra time allotment to the language period. 
She felt certain that in their compositions her pupils were 
not expressing themselves in keeping with their ability, even 
when writing upon subjects of real interest to them. Extra 
time upon this work would enable her to secure the desired 
language improvement in her pupils. 
When the teacher has completed his time distribution by 
subjects, he is ready to undertake the second phase of pro- 
gram making—the daily schedule. Before this can be organ- 
ized with any degree of satisfaction, certain factors in the 
interest of economy of time and effort must be investigated 
by him. Inevitably, they center around the needs of the 
pupils. Almost all of the factors may be grouped under 
three general problems, as follows: 
(1) What provisions must be made for effectively organ- 
izing into a program the study, recitation, and recreation 
time of the pupils? 
(2) In what order shall the various subjects be presented 
so as to provide for most efficient learning? 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
THE SCHOOL PROGRAM 195 
(3) How shall the program be organized so as to provide 
adequately for both individual and class needs, interests, 
and capacities? 
The solution of any one of the three problems cannot 
safely be made off-hand by the teacher, and yet this is what 
occurs very frequently. Hence, at the end of a school day, 
many teachers complain of being ‘‘worn out.” This con- 
dition can be largely avoided by properly solving the prob- 
lems fundamental to daily program making. 
In organizing the daily classroom activities, it is well to 
keep in mind the fact that there must be variety even in 
unity. Although the greater part of a school day is devoted 
to pupil activities which contribute to the solution of some 
large problem or to the execution of some large project, 
continuous work upon it without change is fatiguing. On 
the other hand, too long a period of play will result in an 
idle waste of time. Therefore, play, study, and recitations 
must be alternated in a program so as to avoid fatigue, pro- 
crastination, and monotony. 
In turn, each of these classroom means of development 
must be considered with respect to its nature, functions, 
and usages. These aspects of the study period have already 
been discussed and therefore do not concern us now. One 
point, however, should be kept in mind very conspicuously 
in program making. (Whenever possible, study periods 
should occur in the schedule at such times as teachers are 
free at least in part to supervise the pupils thus engaged. 
Otherwise, studying may result in a very considerable waste 
of time. In the chapters on the assignment, on the planning 
of the work, and on questioning in particular, much has 
been said about the recitation. But some supplementary 
points should be considered which apply more directly to 
our present problem. Teachers are prone to provide too 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
K 
  196 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
much time for recitations at the expense of thoughtful study 
and work, self-effort, and reasoning on the part of the pupils. 
Recitations are generally either too numerous or too long. 
They result in much talking by the teacher, and little inde- 
pendent initiative by the child. Many easily avoided dis- 
ciplinary problems arise out of these situations. 
he recreational periods, especially the recesses, should 
occur frequently enough to eliminate fatigue from the class- 
om efforts of both teachers and pupils. However, the 
intervals between such periods should be sufficiently long 
to insure productive effort on their part in work, study, 
recitation, or whatever other activity is carried on in the 
classroom. The teacher who is most successful with his 
pupils will provide in his own schedule frequent opportunity 
for being with and observing his pupils during some of their 
play periods. By so doing he becomes much better ac- 
quainted with their natures.. 
‘The various subjects of the curriculum must be given the 
same thoughtful attention as the manner of utilizing them 
in learning situation3, Some subjects are more confining 
than others. Reading and arithmetic periods illustrate this 
fact. Other subjects may be presented so as to provide 
relaxation. This is particularly true of music, folk-dancing 
and group gamese Some scheme of alternating these vari- 
ous types of subjects must be provided. 
Again, though subjects vary in their content, their consec- 
utive sequence may prove unsatisfactory for other reasons. 
It is a very easy matter thoughtlessly to arrange a group of © 
subjects so that the pupils remain seated too long. Reading, 
spelling, and written composition presented in this con- 
secutive order’would have this undesirable effect. The fre- 
quent use of the rod in our old-time schools resulted, in 
part, from following this type of program.
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE SCHOOL PROGRAM 197 
Careful thought on the part of teachers will lead them to Ns 
refrain from teaching penmanship immediately after a recess 
period. It may quiet the overheated, hard-playing boy, 
but as a writing lesson it will prove a failure. In fact, the 
condition of most pupils after a play period is such that they 
are physically unfit for any exercise involving writing. 
Some subjects need not be included in the schedule every 
day. The amount of time allotted to them per week is often 
such that it would not be economical to attempt to include 
them in small daily units. This is especially true of manual 
training, home economics, and other handcraft subjects. In 
the same way the time for history, geography, and nature 
study may be so allotted as to occur only on certain days of 
the week. Physical training and music should find a place 
on the daily program largely because of their recreational 
aspects. Definite provision must also be made daily for 
drill subjects or drill phases of subjects. They require only 
short intervals of time for presentation, but, as was pointed 
out in the chapter on the drill lesson, frequent repetitions 
are necessary to insure thorough mastery of the material 
involved. Penmanship, spelling, mastery of the combina- 
tions and fundamental operations of arithmetic, and the 
correction of physical defects are in this group. 
The daily program must provide opportunity for the class 
and forindividual members to meet their respectiveneedsand 
carry on their activities. Since codperative effort centering 
around a natural activity governs good classroom procedure, 
provision must bemade for class conferences, discussions, and 
unitedeffort. The opening exercises, planning the day’swork, 
making assignments to groups, dealing with school problems, 
and developing various phases of the major activity of the 
class require the time and attention of the whole class. 
Adequate time should be allowed for the opening exer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
198 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
cises, so that they may be made interesting and inspiring, 
and so aid in unifying the class. To a large extent, the 
attitudes of children toward their class and its activities 
throughout the day are influenced by what occurs during the 
first ten minutes of the morning session. The truth of this 
can be tested by any teacher who will try the experiment of 
exposing his class to Grieg’s “‘Ase’s Death” on a given day 
and to Sousa’s ‘‘The American Patrol,” the next. 
If the daily program of the class is organized to-be as 
similar to normal life schedules as possible, the pupils will 
turn naturally from the conclusion of the opening exercises 
to the next order of business of the school day. They will 
be interested in checking up the progress that has been 
achieved on that which has been holding their attention. 
It is necessary to determine what can be undertaken next. 
Hence, the various assignments can be developed, and the 
day’s work will soon be well under way. 
Since individual differences in every class are so great, the 
schedule for each day must provide time for meeting indi- 
vidual needs. Study periods, drs, and recitations should 
be planned so that the child whether of superior, normal or 
subnormal intelligence will be able to make progress in keep- 
ing with his capacity. How a teacher should go about doing 
this is well illustrated in the chapter on the use of scientific 
tests. 
If the above factors are kept in mind, the teacher will 
develop a daily schedule that will serve as an excellent guide 
in aiding him to make the most of the school day. How 
effectual such programing may become is illustrated in the 
daily schedule of a certain fourth grade teacher. Her pro- 
gram, together with the comments of a supervisor whom 
she had asked to spend the day with her, will prove helpful 
to others. It isincluded in the chart on the following page.

-P-A-G-E-208
  202 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
discussed in the chapter on the drill lesson. The application 
of other principles set forth in previous chapters will readily 
occur to the reader. 
The writer had occasion to discuss with a rural school 
teacher the making of a daily program which would be in 
keeping with the utilization of modern educational pro- 
cedures. ‘Can it be accomplished effectively in rural school 
situations?” she was asked. 
“Well, I am attempting to do it with my class,” she 
replied. “I have the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades—twenty- 
one pupils in all. They are constructing that large map of 
the world over there in the corner of the school yard. The 
fourth grade pupils are responsible for the historical and 
geographical material dealing with our state, and with the 
relation of our state to the rest of the world. The fifth 
grade group is studying the history of the United States 
and the geography of the Americas. Of course, our country 
is not isolated from others and, therefore, the pupils find 
it necessary to learn how othercovftttries aye concerned with 
our national life. The sixth grade pon working out 
the backgrounds of American history and the geography of 
Europe. These are interrelated with our own\history and 
geography. Often when the whole class is working to- 
gether, I wonder if I could teach without having all of these 
groups together. 
“The various activities these three grades can carry on 
together are numerous. For example, I plan to hold all 
study periods of the three classes, in reading, geography, 
history, and language at such times as I can be free to super- 
vise them. All pupils will be studying geography at the 
same time. Also, many of the re Tecitations-in-geagraphy and 
history occur with the three grades participating in them 
from various angles. I try to make these periods ones in
-P-A-G-E-209
THE SCHOOL PROGRAM 203 
which the pupils are striving to do good work in oral com- 
position. You can see how easy it is to carry on the drills 
in arithmetic, penmanship, and spelling for all three groups. 
Spelling, after all, is largely a problem of individual needs. 
If I have to so plan for one group, it is just as easy to extend, 
the planning for the whole class, and all pupils can study} 
or take dictation at the same time. Art, music, nature study 
and other subjects we have also been able to organize so 
that any one of them may be profitably undertaken by the 
three grades at the same time.” 
“But do you not have to treat all of the pupils in a grade 
as if they were very much like average children of that 
grade?” 
“Oh, no,” the teacher replied. ‘Two of my so-called 
fifth grade pupils will be ready to undertake seventh grade 
work next term, while two in the fourth grade will enter 
the sixth. There are others who may be able to profit by 
higher grade placement, but I am not sure of them yet. 
The gains of these pupils have been made possible through 
the opportunities for individual adjustments which the pro- 
gram permits. For instance, one of the pupils rapidly 
caught up with the class above his own through the drill 
exercises in the various studies and his efforts in the many 
group activities of two grades.”

CHAPTER XIV 
The Assignment 
The assignment is that phase of the process of learning 
through natural activities which deals with answering the 
question: ‘‘What shall we do next?’ Our lives are marked 
by a-continuous series of experiences or adjustments grow- 
ing out of attempts to respond satisfactorily to this question, 
which involves the facing of a new situation. 
Before we can attempt to meet a given situation econom- 
ically, we have several decisions to make. First of all, we 
must determine whether or not we should undertake the 
activities required in meeting the situation. If there are 
adequate reasons for doing so, we must clearly define what 
they are. Next, we must plan what we should do in order 
to achieve the ends ivolved in these purposes. Then we 
must decide how to proceed most efficiently to accomplish 
our purposes. Finally, we must understand what use to 
make of the experiences thus gained. These are the steps, 
the elements, therefore, which govern the making of an 
assignment. 
When we stop to analyze these elements, we find that 
they are very similar to the principles which should guide 
in planning the work codperatively as presented in Chapter 
XII. This is just what should be expected, since the assign- 
ment merely carries out in detail what was blocked out in 
general in the planning of the work fora given period. In 
fact, planning the work is really making an assignment of 
204 ,
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE ASSIGNMENT 205 
considerable magnitude. Its formulation provides the basis 
for developing a series of more specific assignments. Upon 
the successful carrying out of these depends the success of 
the larger plan. ; 
Hence, the purpose of the assignment is)to further the 
pupils’ growth by aiding them to gain (a) a thorough knowl- 
edge of what they should undertake in order to carry on 
their activities effectively and () a clear understanding of 
how to think and act with economy of time and effort in 
the attainment of their goal. For example, the second 
grade pupils referred to in the chapter on planning the 
work, determined upon certain specific assignments requir- 
ing the effort of each pupil or of various groups. When they 
understood what they were to do and how to proceed, the 
sugcessful attainment of their purposes contributed to the 
success of their imaginary trip around the world. 
A proper observance of the standards governing the as- 
signment depends upon one’s knowing the essentials of a 
good assignment. These essentials may be discovered by 
noting the marks of strength and weakness in, different 
types of assignments. At least three types in use by teachers 
are easily distinguishable. : 
The most common type occurring in the classroom is the 
least common type found in life. Generally it is introduced 
and completed by such instructions as: ‘For the next time, 
study pages 17 to 26,” or “Study chapter eleven in the 
text.” Not only does this assignment require that the 
pupil discover for himself what he is expected to do and 
how he should proceed, but it also fails to provide him with 
a source of interest for engaging in whatever activity is 
necessary. Undoubtedly, the purposelessness, vagueness, 
and extreme difficulty of such assignments often account 
for the fact that the pupil appears in class unprepared. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
206 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
The second type of assignment is exemplified by the fol- 
lowing instructions: “Tomorrow we will discuss the topic, 
‘The Exports of South Africa.’ You will find it treated in 
your geographies on pages 122, 123, and 124,” or, “Write 
an original letter inviting your friend to an imaginary party. 
There is a model on page 176 in your language book.” 
Although this is a more intelligible kind of assignment, it 
does not grow out of an effort to guide pupils in realizing 
natural purposes. It gives them only a hazy notion of 
what is wanted. Consequently, the task is nearly always 
too difficult to be performed satisfactorily except by the 
most gifted pupils. 
The third type of assignment possesses the following char- 
acteristics, which distinguish it from the other two. (z) It 
is made codperatively by the pupils and the teacher, ~ 
the definite purpose in their minds of meeting some thok, 
oughly understood need or needs. (2) Specific directions‘; 
are worked out so that all pupils understand what'they are ~ 
expected to do in making their contributions to the major 
activity forming the basis‘of the assignment. (3) How to 
proceed has been discussed sufficiently for all to know what 
methods will be most economical for them to employ in 
carrying out the assignment. (4) Each pupil has acquired 
an insight into what will constitute a satisfactorily com- 
pleted assignment. 
This desirable third type of assignment is well illustrated 
in the following one developed by a teacher in conference 
with a sixth grade class:    
TEACHER: “We have summed up our reports and know what 
information we have obtained. What have we decided to do 
next?” (Pause.) “John?” 
Joun: “Find out more about what each person said in the 
last council meeting and what arguments were used.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THE ASSIGNMENT 207 
Tracuer: “Why do we need that information?” (Pause.) 
“Mary?” 
Mary: “We need to know because it has to do with the argu- 
ments for and against building a tunnel.” 
Tracuer: “What else have we to do to get information for 
our debate?” 
Puri: “We should read the engineers’ reports. They are 
full of points, too.” 
Teacuer: “Is there anything else we can do?” (Pause.) 
“Harry?” 
Harry: “Study the sections in all of our geographies which 
tell us what products are sent from the regions which will bene- 
fit by the new transportation route.” 
ANotHER Puptt: “The sections, also, will help us to decide 
for ourselves whether or not the amount of products is great 
oe for the state to make such a large expenditure.” 
“Tracuer: “Yes, and the two suggestions indicate what we 
‘must do after we get our information. Can we do more than 
eT that” 
Port: “Yes, we can arrange the’arguments for and against.” 
Teacuer: “Why?” 
Same Purr: “So as to know what arguments we have for 
our side, and what arguments for the other side which we will 
have to find answers to.” 
Teacuer: “That is correct. Is there anything else to do?” 
(Pause.) “John?” 
Joun: “Make our outlines covering all of the points we have 
found.” 
Treacuer: “Yes.” (Pause.) “Is there anyone who does not 
understand what he is to do?” (Pause.) “Then you may 
begin studying. If you need help, I will come to your desk 
when you raise your hand.” 
In this stenographic report, all steps essential to 
securing natural, economic effort on the part of the pupils 
during study are included. The teacher guided the pupils’
-P-A-G-E-214
  208 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
thinking and discussion until a very definite assignment had 
been developed. 
1. Obviously, there were many real reasons for undertak- 
ing the work. The pupils were gathering information, co- 
operatively, for a debate with representatives from another 
class. The specific assignment was made to provide guid- 
ance for gathering additional information from new sources. 
Even old sources were to be reviewed, so that undiscovered 
data which they contained would be recorded for use. Each 
pupil understood and appreciated why it was important to 
do accurately and thoroughly the studying which was neces- 
sary to satisfy the known needs of his class. Each one was 
being given an opportunity to contribute to the class proj- 
ect, through doing his work well. 
It is evident that the teacher had guided the pupils into 
a thorough understanding of why the specific assignments 
were made. Their class loyalty, their desire to compete 
with another class, their keen interest in making contribu- 
tions to their side of the debate, had aroused them to exert 
satisfactory effort. The undertaking they had planned 
would be attacked vigorously because of their intensive 
interest and serious purpose. 
Whenever the process of solving a problem, executing a 
project, or planning an essential drill lesson is well moti- 
vated, the pupils will be ready to work for some time and 
with good effort. The motives will be sufficient to affect 
their attitudes, which will in turn give added impetus to 
their work. ‘Hence, every assignment should provide for 
definite understanding and appreciation by the pupils of 
the purpose involved in it, 
2. The illustration indi¢ated, also, the need for planning 
carefully what specific activities were to be carried on. 
There were certain studies for the pupils to complete before 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
THE ASSIGNMENT 209 
the next class discussion. By questioning the pupils, the 
teacher led them to determine what subject matter was to 
be gathered, and from what sources. This participation by 
the members of the class helped them to develop consciously 
a definite knowledge of what activities would afford them 
the most help. 
Pupils who determine in similar ways that which is to be 
studied or thought out, will enter into the activities very 
willingly. In fact, the pressure of the enthusiastic group 
upon any member who attempts to shirk his share of the 
work’ proves a very effective remedy. Rather than arouse 
the displeasure of his classmates, he will make an effort 
to study. 
3. The assignments which the pupils worked out co- 
operatively involved a thorough understanding of how they 
were to prepare for the next reports and discussion. They 
knew why they were to recall past experiences and review 
a phase of their work which would give them additional 
information, also. They developed methods. for obtaining 
other data from the new sources available. The discussion 
indicated 4 definite plan for organizing the information 
acquired. 
Analysis and criticism would constitute aspects of this 
work. The method of testing the material was simple but 
relevant—to find out whether or not it contributed to “the 
arguments for or against.” 
4. When the third step was completed, the pupils knew 
what final step needed to be taken. Their assignment pro- 
vided that the information they obtained was to be organ- 
ized into an outline. It would serve as a basis for making 
the new reports and for discussing the value of the contri- 
bution. This assignment, therefore, provided for a definite 
use of the accumulated materials.  
-P-A-G-E-216
210 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Teacher and pupils alike understood what was expected. 
The former was in a position to direct the study of the 
latter, while they in turn, knew why, what, and how to 
study. 
Two additional examples of good procedure in making 
assignments will supplement the above illustration and make 
clearer the considerations which a teacher must have in 
mind when applying the principles of this phase of teaching 
and learning. They will serve to show, also, that the 
teacher may more nearly realize her own purposes and plans 
by encouraging pupils to make their own assignments, with 
the result that they make a natural attack in doing their 
work. 
The pupils of a high first grade had decided that they wanted 
to raise some flowers for a new window box which they had 
received. In response to their letter requesting bulbs, they 
obtained from the supervisor of nature study, enough to fill their 
box. After they had written their letter of thanks, the follow- 
ing discussion took place: 
Tracer: “Now that our letters are finished, what shall we 
do next?” 
Frep: “Plant the bulbs.” 
Mary: “We haven’t any dirt.” 
Gtapys: “T can get some from home.” 
James: “We can dig some in the lot across the street.” 
Tracuer: “Do you think that we will need anything besides 
earth to make our plants grow the best that they can?” 
A NumBer oF CuILpren: “Water.” 
Guapys: “And fertilizer. My daddy just bought some for 
our flowers.” 
TracueEr: “Do you know why your father bought fertilizer, 
Gladys?” 
Grapys: “Yes. He told me it would make our flowers grow 
better.”
-P-A-G-E-217
  
THE ASSIGNMENT 211 
Myrtte: “My big brother always piles up the dead leaves 
in fall and saves them until now. He calls it a com— something.” 
Teacuer: “A compost.” 
Myrtte: “Yes, that is it—a compost. He mixes this with 
the earth in his vegetable patch. He says it makes them grow 
better.” 
Henry: “We used manure in our patch.” 
Tracuer: “There are many ways of making the soil better, 
then. Before we can plant our bulbs what must we do?” 
SEVERAL Puptts: “Make a compost.” 
Oruers: “Get some fertilizer.” 
Tracuer: “We can’t get the leaves now to make a compost. 
Myrtle, tell us again why your brother has it now?” 
Myrtte: “He saved the leaves in the fall.” 
Tracuer: “Also, some of our class have told us different 
things to do. What do you think we had better do first of all 
before we begin to plant our bulbs? Think carefully. Let me 
see how many can think of a good answer. Raise your hands 
so I can see when you are ready to answer. What must we do 
first?” (Pause, during which many hands were raised.) “James, 
you were ready first.” 
James: “Find out what is good to plant the bulbs in.” 
Teacuer: “That is good. Mary?” 
Mary: “Shouldn’t we find out what is the best?” 
Crass: “Yes! Yes!” 
TEACHER (to class): “You seem to think Mary’s answer is 
better than James.” 
Crass: ‘Yes.” 
Tracuer: “Charles, what do you want to say?” 
Cuartes: “I think Mary’s answer is better. It will help us 
to get started. But what are we going to do next? Don’t we 
have to know all about growing the plants?” 
Tracuer: “Class, what do you think?” 
(A number of responses accepting Charles’ suggestion.) 
Teacuer: “Then before we can be sure that we will have fine
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  212 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
flowers, we will have to learn all about how to plant and grow 
them. Shall we do this?” 
Crass: “Yes.” 
TracuER: “What have we to do now? Anyone.” 
Frep: “Find out the best way to grow our flowers.” 
Tracuer: “Do you think Fred is right or wrong, class?” 
Crass: “Right.” 
Teracuer: “Can you think of ways that we can find out what 
we need to know?” 
Responses: “Ask people who know.” 
“You read to us.” 
“Read it ourselves.” 
“Have Miss P—— come to tell us.” 
SEVERAL Puptts: “Oh, let’s do that.” 
TEACHER: “But we ought to know something about the plant- 
ing and growing first so that we can ask questions. I think all 
of the suggestions are good. I have found these books which I 
am sure you can read. On my desk are some that I will gladly 
stead to you. Also, we can find out many things we want to 
know from other people.” 
Then followed the assigning of tasks and the distribution of 
books, marking the beginning of the serious undertaking. 
“How can we raise beautiful plants from our bulbs?” was 
printed on the blackboard by the teacher and remained there 
during the time that the children were solving their problem, 
and carrying on the projects which grew out of it. 
The next illustration is from a third grade experience. 
The children of a third grade had completed their reading 
of several stories dealing with life in Holland. One group 
had read Campbell’s ‘‘The Story of Little Jan, the Dutch 
Boy”; another group had finished reading Cary’s ‘‘The 
Leak in the Dike,” which was found in a supplementary 
reader; and a third group had completed the reading of 
Perdue’s “Jacob and Katrina.” The teacher had been read-
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE ASSIGNMENT 213 
ing Dodge’s Hans Brinker to the class, during the story 
hour. Many reports and discussions had resulted from 
these activities. 
When the teacher felt that the children had, through this 
series of appreciation lessons, developed a keen interest in 
Holland and had also acquired a considerable knowledge 
of that country, she led her class into a discussion, which 
culminated in the following assignment: 
Teacuer: “Do you think that the Dutch children are as 
happy as you are?” 
(A difference of opinion was expressed.) 
Tracuer: “I am going to ask those who think that the 
Dutch children are not as happy as we are to tell us why not. 
When you are ready to answer, please raise your hand.” (Pause.) 
(A number of children gave various answers.) 
Tracuer: “Now those who think otherwise may answer.” 
(Many answers given. A general discussion followed and the 
conclusion was reached that Dutch children are as happy as 
American children.) 
Treacuer: “We were led to think differently about their hap- 
piness because of the difference in the way they live and the 
way we live, as Jane suggested a while ago. Why do you think 
that they need to live, play and work so differently from us?” 
(Pause.) “Jane?” 
Jane: “One reason is that they have so little space in which 
they can play. Another reason is that the frozen canals all 
over Holland become real playgrounds.” 
Tracuer: “Can anyone else give additional reasons?” 
(Pause.) “Mary?” 
Mary: “The Dutch people have to watch the dikes all of the 
time and repair them so that they will not get drowned. The 
‘children have to learn to look for leaks and tell somebody 
right away.” 
Teacuer: “John, your hand was raised.”
-P-A-G-E-220
  214 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Joun: “There is so little land and so many people on it that 
they have to use every bit of it carefully. They have to be 
very thrifty.” 
Grorcr: “They are thrifty in lots of other ways.” 
(Other answers given to the same question.) 
Harry: “Miss T——, can we—I mean, may we—make a 
Dutch scene in the sandbox like we did when we studied about 
the French children?” 
(Considerable enthusiasm shown by the class.) 
Teacuer: “How many would like to do this?” 
(Almost every hand raised.) 
TrAcuER: “Do you remember what we had to do first in 
order to make our French scene a very good one?” (Pause.) 
“Jack?” 
Jack: “We found out all of the things we could from the 
books we read.” 
Exizasetu: “We read some other books, too. I saw some 
new books about the Dutch on our reading table this morning.” 
Tracuer: “James Whitney?” 
James W.: “We collected many pictures.” 
TracueEr: “Fred?” 
Frep: “We used the sets of pictures in the folders and the 
stereographs, too. We wrote our own play about’the ‘French 
Twins’ and played it. I would like to do that again. Is there 
a ‘Dutch Twins’ book?” 
TEACHER (picking up a number of books from the reading 
table): “Yes, Fred, here is a book called The Dutch Twins and 
another one called The Dutch Twins Primer. We can dramatize 
these stories very easily, if the class wants to do so.” 
(Enthusiastic clapping and expressions of approval.) 
Tracer: “How shall we begin our work for the sandbox 
scene and for writing our plays?” (Pause.) “Mabel?” 
Maset: “Each of our groups should take a set of the new 
books to read and study.” 
Tracuer: “Ethel?”  
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE ASSIGNMENT 215 
Erne: “We must get the information out of our other ones, 
too.” 
Harry: “Use the pictures and collect new ones, too.” 
Tracuer: “As we are working, we must try to find other 
ways and other things to help us. Shall we select our books 
now?” 
(Class is evidently eager to begin at once.) 
Teacuer: “We are going to hold Jane’s group responsible for 
reading and finding out the helpful ideas in The Dutch Twins 
Primer.” (Set passed to Jane.) “George, your group will enjoy 
studying for us this story about Our Little Dutch Cousin.” (Set 
to George.) “Harry, your group can find out for us a lot of new 
things in The Dutch Twins; Fred, will you give particular atten- 
tion to the possibility of dramatizing the story?” (Set to Harry.) 
“Elizabeth, here is a story about a little Dutch girl for your 
group, Marta in Holland.” (Set taken.) ‘Helen, there are 
many interesting things about the Dutch in the first two stories 
in Smith’s Holland Stories. Suppose your group reads them.” 
(Books taken.) “Gregory, your group should look for some 
strange things about the Dutch people in the next two stories— 
three and four.” (Books taken.) “Whenever a group has fin- 
ished, I will help it find other new material. Some+of the books 
that one group has been assigned, I am sure others will want 
to read, also. 
“We must remember to review all of the reading about Hol- 
land we have covered during the past week or so. Every one 
of us should do this. It will require us to set aside a part of 
our reading and geography periods. Let us start our review by 
beginning with the Dutch story on page 66 in Perdue’s Child 
Life in Many Lands. What other ones do we need to review?” 
(Pupils enumerate the list and teacher writes the specific ref- 
erences on the board.) 
Tracuer: “This list of numbers which have been written 
above the review work, you will notice, refers to the stereographs 
and slides. All of them are about Holland. Then you should 
study carefully the many pictures in your books. They will give 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  216 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
you a number of ideas, also, which you can work into the sand- 
box scene and use in your designs for stage scenery and cos- 
tumes.” (Writes on board under general assignment, “Study all 
pictures carefully. Make notes about them.’’) 
TEACHER: “It is just about recess time. After recess would 
you like to begin reading the new stories?” 
(General agreement.) 
Teacuer: “Allright. When you return to the room, assemble 
in your respective groups, get your books from your captains, 
and begin reading.” 
If the reader analyzes these examples of effective assign- 
ments, he will note several things which characterize them. 
First, he will note that the resourceful teacher chooses his 
leads from the responses of the pupils, and guides their plan- 
ning into the channels which will involve some type of ex- 
perience productive of the ends he has determined upon as 
essential to growth. He seizes upon the natural interests 
and the normal activities which the discussions of the chil- 
dren indicate are uppermost in their thoughts. At the same 
time, he is careful to lead them into undertaking something 
that has been developed through their own thinking, mak- 
ing sure, however, that the assignment is definitely and 
clearly understood by all. 
Second, the teacher is reasonably certain that the diffi- 
culty of the assignment is in keeping with the capacity and 
achievement of the various children participating. The 
actual distribution of materials to be read was made by the 
teachers with this in mind. Also, to insure that an assign- 
ment can be executed by all, helps must be provided for 
some that others would not need. 
Finally, the teacher must determine when an assignment 
is to be made. This is one of the most difficult aspects 
involved. Whenever possible, the assignment should grow
-P-A-G-E-223
THE ASSIGNMENT 217 
out of a recitation and be developed so that the pupils can 
begin studying soon afterward. Then their interests will be 
thoroughly aroused and their efforts will be correspondingly - 
greater. Such assignments, too, are generally made with- 
out haste, because of the sufficient time the teacher finds 
available. It is very essential that sufficient time be taken 
in developing a good assignment. Less time may be pro- 
vided for recitation or study, but the assignment should 
never be hurried or incomplete. More important than any 
other item in learning is a clear understanding of what is 
to be learned, how it should be learned, and why it should 
be learned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
) CHAPTER XV C7 
Training Pupils to Study 
Training pupils to study is a comparatively new educa- 
tional responsibility. From the first establishment of 
schools, teachers have understood that they are responsible 
for equipping their pupils with a certain amount of knowl- 
edge, and for rendering some of that knowledge into habit. 
It is only in recent years, however, that schools have begun 
to recognize their responsibility for training pupils in right 
methods of study. Very limited progress has been made 
thus far in the development of a technique for training 
pupils to study. 
Studying may be defined as what one does to learn. It 
consists in acquiring the ideas and experiences of others with 
the object of adding to one’s ability to do things. 
\The object of developing in pupils the ability to study is 
to render them able to work alone—to make them capable 
of learning independently of teacher help. The teacher who 
has trained his pupils to study effectively has done one of 
the greatest things possible for them. Knowledge, skills, 
and appreciations are all valuable, but most valuable of all 
is the ability to study independently, and with confidence 
that the results achieved will be reliable. One who knows 
how to study knows how to form habits, how to break up 
wrong habits, how to gather and evaluate data, how to 
draw correct conclusions therefrom, and how to test the 
validity of data and conclusions. )

  TRAINING PUPILS TO STUDY 219 
The guidance needed by teachers in training their pupils 
to study may best be supplied, perhaps, by answering the 
following questions which crystalize the difficulties that con- 
front the classroom teacher when he turns his attention to 
the discharge of this duty: (1) How may a teacher best go 
- about training his pupils to study? (2) What things must 
pupils be able to do well in order to study effectively? (3) 
What conditions are necessary to good studying? (4) 
What devices and detailed procedures of use in thorough 
study should pupils be trained'to employ? (5) What should 
be the relation of the teacher to his pupils during the study 
period? Each of these questions will be treated in order 
below. 
(1) How may a teacher best go about training his pupils to 
study? The experience of successful teachers indicates con- 
clusively that pupils may be most thoroughly, satisfactorily, 
and economically trained to study by ‘having them use 
proper and thorough study procedures constantly in their 
work from gradg to grade. It is a clear case of learning to 
do by doir (From time to time the pupils should be 
directed in lyzing and noting what essential things they 
do when they study well. By this process of analysis and 
reflection, the pupils may rationalize for themselves the 
essentials in good studying. 
Learning which takes place by the natural procedure con- 
tinually employs the essentials of good studying. This was 
illustrated over and over again in Part II. Learning can 
take place only by reason of good studying under such a 
procedure. This methoc of study eliminates the rule and 
domination of textbooks By this procedure, the textbook 
takes its rightful place of ffording one good source of help 
when the pupils are studying. yt Thorough learning, upon the 
basis of natural activities, isgood evidence that the pupils’     
   
-P-A-G-E-226
    
220 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
study activities have complied with the requisites of good 
studying. 
(2) What things must pupils be able to do well in order to 
study effectively? 'To discover the essential steps employed 
in good studying, one merely needs to note what he does to 
secure satisfactory results in any natural learning situation. 
he things done vary somewhat, of course, according to 
whether his learning procedure involves (a) problem solving, 
(0) project execution, (c) drill, or (d) appreciation. The 
details, the emphasis especially, vary with the procedure 
used and with the complexity of the undertaking. 
(a) Analyzed experience reveals that the following steps 
are inherent in the study involved in an educative situation 
requiring problem solving: 
1. A problem of significant importance requiring solution is 
determined upon. If the problem is sufficiently significant to 
the pupils, the motive for its attack and mastery will be adequate. 
2. Data pertaining to the solution of the problem should be 
gathered from all conveniently accessible sources, such as text- 
books, supplementary books, encyclopedias, excursions, labora- 
tory experiments, visual materials, magazines, people, and the 
like. 
3. Data gathered from any source are supplemented from every 
other reasonable source and also by the pupil’s own constructive 
thinking. 
4. Judgment is continually exercised in considering what to 
do and how to proceed in solving the problem; the soundness 
and worth of the data gathered must be constantly judged. 
5. The data gathered which are deemed pertinent to the situ- 
ation must be organized in order to focus it upon the solution 
of the problem. 
6. Judgment as to the correct cotietain of the problem must be 
held in suspense until all data are collected and carefully evaluated. 
7. As the solution of the problem moves forward, those things
-P-A-G-E-227
TRAINING PUPILS TO STUDY 22 
which are likely to be needed in future situations should be 
memorized. Such memorizing as should have been done, but 
which was not done while the solution was under way, should 
be given the necessary attention after the solution of the prob- 
lem is completed. 
8. A conclusion is reached in reference to the solution of the 
problem; if the conclusion seems correct, the problem is con- 
sidered solved. : 
g. The conclusion reached, or the plan determined upon, is 
applied if possible. If the conclusion is an abstract result which 
it is not practicable to apply, the final result is checked back 
against the best-known authorities. 
Each of these steps was so fully and so frequently illus- 
trated in Part II, where each learning procedure was ana- 
lyzed in detail, that further illustration seems unnecessary 
here. The reader is, therefore, referred to Part II for con- 
crete illustrations of each of the steps taken in studying. 
Two results which should be secured from these activities 
in the process of problem solving are worthy of mention. 
Each pupil should do each of the things involved in the 
solution of a problem with such independence of thought 
and action as will be calculated to preserve his own indi- 
viduality. From continued experience in working thor- 
oughly and logically in the solution of problems, good study 
habits and good procedures in doing any piece of work, 
should be built up and fixed in the pupil. 
(6) In project execution, the steps in study are essen- 
tially the same as in problem solving. In the eighth step 
in the project, the conclusion is the plan decided upon for 
carrying out the project. Study up to that point was di- 
rected to finding out how to do the thing the pupils decided 
in step one to do. Step nine, application, consists in put- 
ting into use or operation the plan decided upon.

222 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
(c) In the process of learning through drill, the skill to 
be acquired is first definitely decided upon. If the need 
for it is sufficiently apparent, the pupil’s motive in working 
to acquire the skill will be adequate. Second, the learner 
gets clearly in mind just what he must do to acquire the 
needed skill. Third, he practices until he possesses the skill 
sufficiently to use it. Memorization enters in here. Fourth, 
he makes use of the skill or applies it. In the drill procedure, 
all steps do not appear with the completeness that they 
appear in problem solving and project execution. 
(d) Learning by the appreciation procedure does not ordi- 
narily involve studying alone by the pupil in the same sense 
that it occurs in problem, project, and drill procedures. 
This type of procedure is used, when pedagogically em- 
ployed, because it is believed that the problem to be solved, 
the question to be answered, or the need to be satisfied, can 
be better cared for by this procedure than by either of the 
other three. This may be owing to the largeness or the diffi- 
culty of the undertaking or tothe limits of time. The proce- 
dure starts, asusual,with a conscious need on the part of the 
pupils. Thedataareusually all gathered and presented, how- 
ever, by the teacher. A conclusion-is desirable and is often 
reached, but it is not forced, nor is an application required. 
The foregoing brief summary of how the study activities 
vary with different learning procedures will serve to em- 
phasize the teacher’s responsibility for training his pupils 
in the use of each procedure. It should ever be borne in 
mind, as has been noted, that it is much more important 
that the pupils acquire good methods of working than 
that they acquire extensive knowledge and skills. 
(3) What conditions are necessary to good studying? There 
are several conditions which should obtain in order to secure 
good study efforts. We shall discuss them briefly.
-P-A-G-E-229
  TRAINING PUPILS TO STUDY 223 
First, as has been implied in answering the first two lead- 
ing questions in this chapter, the pupils must have a. sig- 
nificant question to be answered, an important problem to 
be solved, a baffling difficulty or obstacle to be removed, 
or a need of real consequence to be satisfied, Only when 
such a condition exists is the first requisite for thorough 
study present. In fact, outside the school, in the world 
of affairs, no one studies in the sense of searching about 
and investigating unless this first essential in study 
obtains. 
Second, what is to be attempted, and how it is to be 
@done during the study period should be definitely indi- 
cated by the assignment. For the details of how the assign- 
ment should be made and of its essential features, the 
reader is referred to the chapter on The Assignment. 
Third, there should be a definite time for study. It is 
quite as important for the pupil to have a definite time to 
study each subject—a time that he can rigorously observe 
—as it is for the teacher to have a definite time, that can 
be adhered to faithfully, for meeting each class. School 
programs should be constructed so as to give regular and 
adequate study time in so far as possible. Of course, a 
part of the study time of older pupils must be arranged by 
them, to occur outside of school hours. But this outside 
schedule should also be a definite one, and should be faith- 
fully and rigidly observed. 
Fourth, all distracting influences should be eliminated as 
far as possible.! A quiet study room in which there is no 
talking or other disturbance is very desirable. If another 
' class is reciting in a room where pupils are trying to study, 
a situation which is very disturbing, except to those who 
have excellent powers of concentration, is created. Eco- 
nomic considerations often make it impossible for schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  224 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
to provide study conditions free from such distracting influ- 
ences, but whenever possible they should be avoided. 
Fifth, the physical conditions of the room should be so 
favorable that the pupil does not find it necessary to try 
to change them. The temperature should be right—68° to 
70° F. The light should be adequate, but not too intense. 
The air should be kept pure by changing it gradually. A 
table and chair, or a desk and seat, of the right size and 
height, should be provided for each pupil. 
(4) What devices and detailed procedures of use in thor- 
ough study should pupils be trained to employ? ‘There are a 
number which help greatly. Each may seem of small im- 
portance; but when all are combined, their proper use con- 
tributes greatly to economy and efficiency in study. 
First, {the pupils should be trained to understand the 
mechanics of a book and make use of the helps and econo- 
mies of time which it offers. The index, table of contents, 
and paragraph headings are all intended to make the help 
the book offers easy of access. Pupils should not only 
know what these mechanical features are for, but they 
should make use of them. 
Second, they should know and use reference sources in 
the interests of economy and thoroughness in study} The 
dictionary, encyclopedia, magazine index and library cata- 
logue are sources to which the pupils should become accus- 
tomed to go for help. 
Third, materials needed as study moves forward should 
be at hand. These include notepaper or cards of suitable 
size, well-pointed pencils of two or three colors, a suitable 
eraser, pins or clips for fastening together notes pertaining 
to the same topie, and the like. 
Fourthj the pupil should arrange about himself all helps 
to be used in studying so that he can make use, when neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
TRAINING PUPILS TO STUDY 225 
sary, of several of them at once. He should be able to look 
from the book which is occupying his main attention to the 
map or maps which he may need to consult, and to dis- 
cussions by other authorities of the same topic which he is 
studying in his basic book. 
Fifth, aes pupil should study himself to find out when 
and under what conditions he works best! He should know 
at what time of the day he can study a certain subject 
with the most satisfactory results. Some pupils find it best 
to do their difficult work first. Others do better if they 
“warm up” on easy work, doing the difficult work later. 
The pupil should also learn whether brief periods of rest 
promote economy and thoroughness of work. 
Sixth, one’s mental attitude during study should be so 
controlled that good results are possible. From the moment 
study begins, the pupil should address himself seriously to 
what he is to do. He should try to prevent his mind from 
wandering and other interests from creeping in to divide 
his attention. It is usually a good idea at the beginning 
of study to review the larger points which are related to 
the new things to be mastered. As study goes forward, 
the pupil should stop at intervals to think over what he is 
reading, with the object of gathering its essential meaning 
and of organizing it at least in his mind. In this connection, 
he would do weighing and evaluating. As study progresses, 
it will often be found that much reading has to be done 
to gather just the needed points. In the interest of economy, 
the pupil should train himself to “skim” those pages in his 
reading which seem to offer little of the help he needs. 
Seventh, /there are a number of mechanical things which 
the pupil should be trained to do as he studies—especially 
if he owns his basic books. Some of these are: underscoring 
important or key expressions; annotating in the margin as
-P-A-G-E-232
  226 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING ~ 
he reads; making notes of thoughts or ideas suggested by 
his reading; summarizing in the form of notes the essence 
of his reading; and outlining more or less fully as study 
progresses. 
Eighth, thinking of applications and uses of the things 
one is mastering is an aid in study} He may keep lists of 
questions regarding matters not clear to him which he 
wishes to ask about or to look up further. He may think 
of uses for the knowledge and the ability and skills which 
he is acquiring. 
(5) What should be the relation of the teacher to her pupils 
during the study period? The teacher’s answer to this ques- 
tion is of great importance because of its effect upon her 
practice. 
Negatively stated, the teacher should not be a “crutch” 
for her pupils during the study period. She should not do 
for them what they can and should do for themselves. The 
pupils should not be allowed to feel that the teacher is a 
convenient device to be used by them as a means of light- 
ening their work in study. On the other hand, the teacher 
should not sit by and allow the pupils to stumble along to 
a greatly delayed success, or as often happens, to a waste- 
ful, discouraging failure which might have been prevented 
by timely wise counselling and guidance. 
Positively stated, during the study period, the teacher 
should guide and inspire each child to go about his work 
to the best of his ability and in keeping with the essentials 
of good study as set forth above. He should help each 
child to develop the plan of working which is best for him. 
He should guide each child, as need arises, and keep before 
him what he is to accomplish during the study period. 
Instead of doing the pupil’s thinking for him when he 
meets difficulties, the teacher should make suggestions 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  TRAINING PUPILS TO STUDY 227 
which will enable him to solve his own difficulties. Often 
a single apt question properly put will start the train of 
thought or the line of investigation needed to render the 
pupil’s own study successful. 
Pupils who work from grade to grade, obeying and con- 
forming to the laws of learning through natural procedures, 
and who adhere to the essentials of good studying as set 
forth in this chapter, are certain to become independent, 
virile thinkers. The main object of guiding the pupils’ 
study activities is to insure that each shall become a real 
student or investigator—one who can undertake a problem 
proposed for solution and, by careful, thorough study, fol- 
low it through, step by step, to a sound conclusion.
-P-A-G-E-234
  CHAPTER XVI 
Enriching Learning Through the Use of Visual Aids 
In directing the learning of children through normal 
activities, the teacher will find that visual materials are 
necessarily used very extensively. Almost every experi- 
ence that the pupils participate in will involve, directly or 
indirectly, some sort of visualization. Since the seven- 
teenth century, when Comenius produced his ‘Orbis 
Pictus,” the extent to which teachers have been turning to 
visual materials as instructional aids has been increasing, 
For generations, children have been studying more or less 
profusely illustrated books. In the last few decades, there 
has been introduced into the classroom a wealth of other 
materials—sets of pictures, maps, charts, globes, exhibits, 
stereographs, and slides, and recently the film has rendered 
some service of value. In recent years, some school systems 
have maintained distributing centers for supplying the 
teachers in their schools with such visual instruction mate- 
rials as could be obtained. 
With the introduction of so many visual aids into the 
classroom, it seems strange that until recently none of our 
school systems have undertaken careful investigations as 
to the value and correct use of this educational material. 
It is only within the last few years that scientific investi- 
gations and experiments have been undertaken with these 
significant problems in mind. To date very few facts have 
been produced. However, with the impetus that the 
228
-P-A-G-E-235
  
  ENRICHING LEARNING—USE OF VISUAL AIDS 229 
motion picture has given to the use of visual materials— 
even to the point of producing a new type of extremist, the 
claimant that visual aids are the cure for all educational ills 
—scientific study of visual materials will continue until a 
better understanding of the way in which they should be 
used has been developed. 
While the scientist in education is studying the various 
problems dealing with the place and use of visual materials 
in the classroom, we are confronted with the problem of 
determining how to use, to the best of our ability the many 
sorts of visual aids that we have. In the chapters dealing 
with the various types of procedure, we have seen that 
reality and concreteness are essential in the classroom. The 
various illustrations brought out that visual materials were 
used whenever they were needed and because they were 
needed. The important thing to note in these illustrative 
lessons is that the visual aids used became an integral part 
of the class work because they made a positive contribution 
to economy and thoroughness in learning. 
The opposite of this last principle must also be kept in 
mind. Exposure to visual material and nothing more is 
not educative. Mere picture-viewing which does not lead 
to purposeful effort has no more educational value than the 
reading of a book without some significant, definite aim or 
purpose in mind. 
The writer observed a teaching situation in which this 
type of exposure was used. The boys of a certain school 
were assembled in the auditorium to be exposed to six reels 
showing the manufacture of an automobile. Surely such a 
subject has exceptional educative values for the boy of 
today. He knows a great deal about the automobile and 
undoubtedly, with wise guidance, can be led to learn a good 
deal more about it which will be valuable to him. Hence,
-P-A-G-E-236
  230 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
the motive for the picture can be justified. How was it 
accepted? 
The classes crowded into the building with evident antici- 
pation of seeing a “movie,” in much the same spirit as if 
they were going to a “thriller” in the local theater. During 
the first few reels they watched the pictures with consider- 
able interest. Two motion-picture machines were used so 
that no time would be wasted. In spite of this fact a rest- 
lessness developed. The waning of interest became very 
noticeable. Rapidly it approached a climax, when it be- 
came evident that the picture would require a little time 
beyond the usual closing hour of the school. Shortly before 
this time arrived a continual stream of boys began seeking 
their respective teachers, asking to be excused. The last 
reel was run with a large number of the boys leaving or 
returning to their seats, another group watching the results 
of their classmates’ efforts to get out, and a small number 
still interested in the films but greatly disturbed by the 
others. 
Such a condition of affairs will always arise in the wrong 
use of any type of visual material. The boys had not come 
to the picture with a definite purpose in their minds other 
than that of being entertained. Any one of many motives 
could have been developed by the teachers which would 
' have made the showing of these pictures a valuable educa- 
tional device. But because this showing of the pictures was 
aimless, and led to no subsequent effort, what might have 
been of great educational value was only a waste of time. 
Not infrequently, teachers make the same mistake in 
using pictures with their classes. Many a child has studied 
the reading matter of a profusely illustrated history text- 
book without getting any value from the illustrations. 
“But they are in the book where he can see them over and
-P-A-G-E-237
ENRICHING LEARNING—USE OF VISUAL AIDS 231 
over again,” is often offered as probable proof that even- 
tually he will profit by merely seeing them. One needs only 
to attempt to recall what pictures hung in any one of the 
classrooms in which he sat for some one hundred and sixty 
days or more to realize how absurd such a contention is. 
How, then, are we to use visual aids in the interest of 
economy of time and effort in learning? For a period of 
two years, a committee of teachers and principals in the 
Berkeley, California, public schools studied intensively the 
problem of visual instruction in an attempt to answer this 
question. They gathered information ‘from all possible 
sources, in reference to (1) the various sorts of materials 
which might be used in visual instruction and (2) any 
results which had been secured from the use of such mate- 
rials.” (Berkeley, California, Public Schools, Elementary 
Schools Monograph, No. 7, ‘Visual Instruction.”) 
In concluding the statement with respect to the place 
and value of visual instruction, this monograph says: 
While there are no exact measures as yet of the advantages 
to be secured from the proper and successful use of visual aids 
in teaching, enough is known to justify large faith on our part 
in the results which will surely follow from their use. However 
great the advantages and savings may prove to be from the use 
of visual instructional materials, no one should consider that 
they are proposed as offering any “royal” road to learning. 
While all means of education which add to the pupil’s interest, 
economize his time, and increase the efficiency of the learning 
process should be brought into modern school procedures, it 
should always be borne in mind that it is fundamentally impos- 
sible and quite undesirable to set aside, or to eliminate the neces- 
sity for actual work on the part of the pupils. All that educa- 
tional means can do is to make problems and the work attempted 
in their solution more meaningful to the pupil and to provide 
more means and sources of help in their solution. Visual mate- 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  232 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
rials are of value in stimulating thinking, in clarifying the 
factors involved in the solution of a problem, and in rendering 
more thorough the mastery attained. 
Not only will the use of visual instruction materials not elimi- 
nate work, but it will not set aside the proper and sensible use 
of textbooks and libraries. Rather, visual materials will provide 
stimulus to go to textbooks and library sources of information 
for such help as the visual materials themselves cannot give. 
The study carried on by the committee led to the follow- 
ing conclusions as to the types of service that visual aids 
can be made to render in the learning process. 
First—Visual aids are valuable as a means of introducing 
new subject matter. 
Second—Visual aids are necessary in the preparation of as- 
signed work in the execution of a project . . . to solve some 
problem, explain some difficulty or enrich some phase of the 
lesson. 
Third—Visual aids are also valuable in reviewing a series of 
lessons or experiences in a concrete, connected way. 
Fourth—Visual materials are invaluable as a means of fas- 
cinating, wholesome entertainment. 
It is evident that the first three uses . . . occur in serious 
classroom work. The fourth use should occur less frequently 
and would ordinarily not grow out of or be related to the regular 
classroom work of the pupils. It does not meet a real need, how- 
ever, in discharging its function of training for the right use of 
leisure. 
In organizing the treatment of procedure the committee 
had in mind the same conception of what constitutes visual 
instruction materials as is held by the writer. Anything 
that makes a sensory appeal is to be considered a visual 
aid, whether it is the excursion, the chart, the graph, the 
map, the diagram, the picture, the globe, the model, the 
stereograph, the slide, or the motion picture.

ENRICHING LEARNING—USE OF VISUAL AIDS. 233 
From the foregoing, the reader will readily see the answers 
to the question which was raised with respect to how visual 
aids can be used effectively and economically. These an- 
swers may be summed up under three heads, which consti- 
tute the three principles which should govern the use of 
visual instruction as a phase of our procedures. The prin- 
ciples are as follows: 
(x) There must be a careful preparation of the class by the 
teacher or under her guidance before the visual aids are used, 
in order that genuine interest may be aroused and meaningful 
needs felt. 
(2) The pupils must understand thoroughly that the visual 
materials presented afford the means of meeting their felt needs. 
(3) The teacher must direct the pupils’ interests and efforts 
growing out of the exposure to the visual aids, into activities 
which provide adequately for the review of the materials and 
the new uses to which they are to be applied. 
Of course, this is nothing more or less than the applica- 
tion of the laws of learning—readiness, exercise, and effect. 
The pupils will have in mind definite purposes which they 
desire to accomplish; they will be ready for the experience 
involved in the presentation of the visual materials; and 
they will utilize this experience, to accomplish with success 
and satisfaction their original purpose. In this way their 
learning will have become enriched and effective. - 
The teacher’s technique must be just as thoughtful and 
purposeful whether she is using moving pictures, slides, 
flat pictures, or other visual education materials. It is not 
improbable that through such careful adherence to sound 
educational procedure she will find that visual aids ‘will 
supply some of the intermediate steps in the grasping of 
large conceptions” on the part of her pupils. (Editorial by 
Bagley,in Visual Education Magazine, January, 1923.) The
-P-A-G-E-240
    
234 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
enrichment of children’s experiences by means of visual 
aids will be evident in any of the types of natural attack in 
teaching. The solving of problems, the execution of proj- 
ects, the use of appreciation lessons, and the motivation 
of drill become productive of better outcomes as a result 
of the thoughtful introduction of visual materials. 
Some concrete examples of teaching through visual aids 
illustrate the practical application of these principles. The 
first case illustrates the correct use of the motion picture 
as an aid to enriching learning in the execution of a project. 
The pupils of a sixth grade class were studying Africa. In 
order that they might construct a floor map of it, they were 
consulting a large collection of textbooks, books of travel, 
the National Geographic Magazine, and a variety of other 
materials which they had obtained. While they were in the 
midst of their activity, the pictures filmed in Africa by the 
naturalist H. A. Snow were advertised as a coming feature 
by a local moving-picture theater. The resourceful teacher 
turned the attention of her pupils to this possibility of get- 
ting at first hand some important information about Africa. 
She visited a theater in a nearby city where the picture was 
being shown and took notes of its educational possibilities. 
These she used as the basis for discussion with the children 
so that when they saw the picture they would have in mind 
some very definite, meaningful problems which the produc- 
tion would materially help them to solve. With this ade- 
quate preparation for an appreciation lesson, the class at- 
tended the special morning show for school children. 
The afternoon geography period was given over to a dis- 
cussion of the picture, as a beginning of the activities involv- 
ing review. In this first review even the materials read in 
books and elsewhere were introduced and criticised in the 
light of the morning’s experiences. During the next few
-P-A-G-E-241
  ENRICHING LEARNING—USE OF VISUAL AIDS 235 
days compositions were written about the pictures, illustra- 
tions were drawn, models made, and other similar activities 
were carried on. Thus the materials from the pictures were 
assimilated and utilized by the pupils, through a series of 
interesting projects requiring repetition of subject matter. 
Another sixth grade class enriched its learning by means 
of a second type of visual aid. The members were studying 
Egyptian history, having in mind the solution of the prob- 
lem: ‘‘What constitutes the essential historical information 
which will show Egypt’s contribution to the progress of civi- 
lization?’’? This problem needed to be solved before the 
pupils could continue their project—the writing of a pageant 
depicting the progress of civilization. With this definite 
need in mind, they planned a trip to the museum to see the 
Egyptian mummies and other ancient relics of this early 
civilization. Under the teacher’s guidance the pupils devel- 
oped a program, listing the objects they were to study and 
what they wanted to find out from first-hand observations. 
This involved careful planning, to the end that the essen- 
tials, even to important details, would not be missed. The 
children organized themselves into groups, to each of which 
they assigned special responsibilities. These were natural 
activities for them in the light of their interests and pur- 
poses. Therefore, their excursion to the museum presented 
to them an exceptional opportunity for enriching their ex- 
periences and increasing their knowledge by a real experi- 
ence—exposure to materials representative of the life and 
customs of the ancient peoples. 
The visit required the whole of one school day. Teacher, 
pupils, and many of the parents spent a fascinating time in 
the one small section of the museum. There was little evi- 
dence of any desire on the part of anyone to go elsewhere 
during the time spent in the building. Discussions, expla-
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
nations, and questionings were indulged in, similar to those 
which adult research students would have carried on in the 
same situation. For some time thereafter this experience 
served as a basis for much oral and written composition 
involving a review of Egyptian life and customs. All 
through the remaining periods spent on the study of Egypt 
the influence of the visit to the museum was very marked 
in the thinking, acting, and feeling of the children. Its 
influence was noted in the contributions it. made to their 
major project in such activities as the writing of a section 
of the pageant dealing with Egyptian history and geography, 
the making of the necessary stage scenery, the designing and 
making of appropriate costumes. The products of these 
purposeful experiences were concrete records of the desir- 
able outcomes attained. 
The use of slides by the children of a fourth grade class 
illustrates how these enrich learning when, first, careful pre- 
paration, secondly, meaningful exposure, and thirdly, pur- 
poseful follow-up or review activities are observed in using 
them. The class was studying about the missions of Cali- 
fornia. The special responsibility of one group in the class 
consisted of developing and presenting reports on mission 
life to the rest of the pupils. This group went to the audi- 
torium and examined carefully a collection of slides. They 
read the accompanying descriptions. The businesslike dis- 
cussions which followed led to the selection of a limited 
number of good slides. Then these children planned their 
series of reports. Several times during the course of these 
activities, the teacher joined the group and gave the pupils 
the benefit of her suggestions and criticisms. The whole 
performance proved so interesting to me that I sought an 
opportunity to see it carried to a conclusion. 
When these children reported to the class, actually using 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  ENRICHING LEARNING—USE OF VISUAL AIDS § 237 
the baloptican in rendering their appreciation lessons ef- 
fective, the other members listened and observed with in- 
tense interest. The questioning and discussions which fol- 
lowed the presentations were sufficient proof of the enrich- 
ment in learning that had occurred. 
A similar procedure by second and third grade children 
using stereoptican pictures and stereoscopes in reporting to 
their classes, which were taking imaginary trips around the 
world, presented corroborating evidence that the develop- 
‘ment of a good technique in the use of visual aids inevitably 
enriches and enhances learning. 
It is possible for anyone whose interest in children’s learn- 
ing leads him to observe their activities where natural situ- 
ations are maintained in the classroom, to add many exam- 
ples similar to those presented. Undoubtedly some occur 
to the reader at this moment. Therefore, it is unnecessary 
to continue at length the presentation of concrete evidence 
of how visual aids may enrich learning. In conclusion but 
one more example will be cited. It is introduced because it 
exemplifies this type of teaching where very young children 
are concerned. 
The pupils in a kindergarten had planned the project of 
building and furnishing several stores, using Patty Hill 
blocks for this purpose. The teacher led her children to dis- 
cuss the various kinds of stores which contribute in large 
measures to the comfort and welfare of the home—the gro- 
cery, the bakery, the hardware store and the like. In con- 
cluding this discussion, she planned with the class a series 
of visits to the stores near the school. 
Before these excursions were begun, she went to every 
store and made mental notes which she felt would help her 
in guiding the children to obtain the best returns from their 
trips. She discussed the proposed visit of her class with
-P-A-G-E-244
238 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
each of the storekeepers until she felt that most of them 
had acquired a sympathetic attitude with what she was at- 
tempting to do for her children. Her visits convinced her 
that these business men and women could contribute mate- 
tially to make the lessons very effective. ‘Just before the 
children started on each excursion, the teacher worked out 
with them some questions which she planned that they 
should discuss when they returned to the kindergarten. By 
this careful preparation she stimulated their observation. 
The stores that the children built afterwards, and the activi- 
ties dramatized in them showed plainly how valuable visual 
aids become to young children, when careful planning accom- 
panies their use. 
Every teacher in every class can obtain the same results 
when she observes the laws of learning in making use of 
visual materials. The learning of her children will be greatly 
enriched through their use if she provides them with: first, 
an opportunity to prepare adequately for the program of 
exposure to visual materials; secondly, the wise guidance 
during their exposure which will make it a purposeful and 
meaningful one; and thirdly, the opportunity to carry on 
activities after the experience, by way of review, which will 
involve the utilization of the content gained from the mate- 
tials. The outcomes achieved will be sufficient proof to her 
that learning has been enriched through the use of visual 
aids.

CHAPTER XVII 
Questioning 
After an exhaustive and critical study of questioning as 
a phase of schoolroom practice, Dr. Romiett Stevens ex- 
pressed the opinion that “eight-tenths of the school time « 
is occupied with questions and answers.”! While the best 
modern practice would hardly accord the question and 
answer so large a part of the school time, yet it has and 
must always have, a large place in teaching. For this 
reason, and because of the ends it serves, questioning occu- 
pies an important place in the teaching process. It is desir- 
able, therefore, that teachers be skilled in the proper and 
effective use of questions. 
It is necessary, at the outset, to distinguish between the 
natural and the formal, or teaching, question. A natural 
question is one asked, either in school or out, by a person 
who wishes for himself the information or advice his ques- 
tion asks. A formal, or teaching question, is one asked by 
the teacher as a means of furthering the educative process 
in which he is guiding his pupils. Usually the teacher who 
asks a question knows the answer and so is not asking it to 
secure for his own use information or advice. 
The somewhat limited place of the purely natural ques- 
tion in teaching is apparent at once. Many questions asked 
by the teacher will not be natural; but those asked by the 
1Stevens, R., The Question as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction. (Teachers 
College, Columbia University, 1912.) 
239
-P-A-G-E-246
    240 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
pupils should be natural. Of the two thousand questions 
asked in the twenty stenographically reported lessons 
studied by Dr. Stevens there were but thirty natural ques- 
tions. Most of these were asked by the pupils, such as: 
“Can you have rhyme in blank verse?” ‘‘Can’t the am- 
monia vapor turn back into a liquid?”” The teachers’ ques- 
tions were natural when they were inquiring as to the pro- 
gress of pupils on assigned duties./ It must be borne in mind, 
of course, that Dr. Steven’s study was made before the nat- 
ural procedure in teaching, such as is advocated in this book, 
had come into general use. A similar study now, because 
of the many modern, progressive schools, would probably 
yield quite a different result. 
The more nearly the school secures child learning through 
using natural procedures such as are employed outside the 
school, the greater will be the use of natural questions. 
When pupils and teacher are planning together as co- 
workers how to attack and master some phase of history 
or geography, the teacher’s question is a natural one 
when she asks: ‘‘Of the ways proposed for doing this work, 
which do you prefer and why?” As such work proceeds, 
also, many of the questions asked by the teacher are quite 
as natural as those asked by the pupils. The best type of 
teaching—that which aims to guide and direct learning in 
the most effective ways—makes large use of the natural 
question. 
The formal, or teaching question is a definite schoolroom 
tool which has its use and place in furthering economy of 
learning. It is an economic means of enabling the teacher 
to out whether a pupil possesses the knowledge upon 
which the next topic or problem is based. It is, also, a 
means of recalling experiences which are related to a new 
experience or idea which the teacher wishes the class to
-P-A-G-E-247
QUESTIONING - 241 
grasp. For example, in the study of American history, as 
each new aspect of our territorial expansion appears, a few 
well-put questions will cause the pupils to recall such pre- 
vious knowledge as will assist in the mastery of the new 
aspect of the question. This type of question is a means, 
also, of deepening investigation and thinking. It is, more- 
over, used by the teacher to display before the entire class 
the final results of each pupil’s study and thought. It may 
also be used as a means, before finishing the work in a given 
subject, of causing the pupils to think through their experi- 
ences in a large way, organizing, clarifying, and deepening 
the results and conclusions of their own work. The more 
natural _the procedure used in promoting learning, the less 
formal will the questions tend to be. To the extent that 
questioning can depart from the formal type and employ 
the natural question, will the learning situation be co- 
operative, rich in motive, and filled with inspiration for the 
pupils. 
Whether the questions used in promoting learning be 
natural or formal, good questions have certain character- 
istics, and certain standards govern the use of such ques- 
tions in teaching. With these every teacher should be 
familiar. If anything like eight-tenths of the class time of 
the school is consumed with questions and answers, the 
largest possible guidance is needed by teachers so that their 
questioning may be as efficient as possible. 
The teacher should realize the difference between ques- 
tions asking for facts and questions seeking reasons. He 
should appreciate the difference in the value of these two 
types of questions. 
Fact questions test the memory. They are “who,” 
“what,” “when,” and “where” questions. A pupil knows 
the answer to such a question or he doesn’t know it. He
-P-A-G-E-248
  242 MODERN METHODS IN-TEACHING | 
can’t combine things he already knows to determine the 
answer to such a question. 
Questions seeking reasons call for reflective thinking. 
They ask the “how” or “why” of a thing or situation. 
They stimulate to further reading, inquiry, and investiga- 
tion. They give experience in understanding relationships. 
They require the kind of thinking which is largely employed 
in solving the difficult questions and problems which arise 
outside as well as inside the school. : 
The reader will recall that one of the school illustrations 
of problem solving exemplified how a class undertook prac- 
tically a whole term’s work in American history in an effort 
to answer the “why” question raised by one pupil with 
regard to the changes in American home life. Consider, 
also, the examples of a good assignment in an earlier chapter 
containing many “why” and “how” questions. 
Educational investigations show that teachers ask many 
more fact than reason questions. An investigation con- ° 
ducted in a certain school revealed that only 139 reason 
questions were employed to 622 fact questions. Dr. Stevens 
did not summarize her results from this standpoint, but an 
examination of the lessons reported stenographically in her 
entire study reveals a great preponderance of fact questions. 
There is large reason to beliéve that a study of good social- 
ized teaching now would show a marked numerical increase 
in the questions asking for reasons. 
It is of some value, also, to classify questions as ‘pivotal 
and developmental. A pivotal question is a comprehensive 
one which goes straight to the heart of the matter under 
consideration. It neglects details for the time being. In 
planning a new educational experience with his pupils, the 
teacher is concerned to make sure that five or six, let us 
say, large points are understood. These may be brought 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  QUESTIONING 243 
into prominence by means of five or six pivotal questions 
which should serve a double purpose. In the first place, 
they should provoke thought on the part of the pupils in 
the direction of the proposed experience, and secondly, they 
should provoke thoughtful and pertinent questions by the 
pupils, which when answered will in turn contribute to the 
understanding of the educational experience. The teacher 
should always utilize these questions as much as possible. 
By so doing the interest and alertness of the class are 
encouraged. 
The developmental question is useful in getting pupils to 
relate one detail to another in order that their proper mean- 
ing and significance may be seen. The skillful use of the 
developmental question may lead pupils so to relate details 
as to enable them to solve the problem stated by a pivotal 
question. A few years ago, much more than now, we hope, 
the use of this type of question was carried to unreasonable 
lengths. It should be used to secure careful, related think- 
ing, looking to the reaching of conclusions which are clearly 
possible, and for no other purpose. It must be frankly rec- 
ognized that some things would better be told or looked up 
in an authoritative source. Questioning to evolve them is 
wasteful of time and destructive of good habits of thinking. 
Questions of a certain sort are properly regarded as objec- 
tionable. Generally speaking, direct, leading, and alternat- 
ing questions are to be avoided. 
The direct question expects “‘yes” or ‘‘no reply. It 
is of little value, because it may be answered usually with 
little thought or knowledge. Too often, the answer is a 
guessed response and nothing more. This is obviously true, 
for the child soon learns to appreciate that if his first answer 
is wrong, the second one will be correct. This type of ques- 
tion has other objectionable features. It is one of the two in
-P-A-G-E-250
  244 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
types which directly exposes pupils to the effect of making 
a wrong response. It sets up a bond which must later be 
broken. Sometimes this is not so easy todo. Again, it may 
leave the pupil with a confused impression of which answer 
was right and which wrong, for some time after the question 
was asked. : 
However, this type of question has its place in learning, 
when it is so stated that the response will not be forthcoming 
until considerable thinking has taken place. ‘Do you think 
that the type of leadership which Andrew Jackson brought 
to bear on internal politics was very essential at that time?”’ 
is a question which will require careful weighing of evidence 
before a pupil can respond. He may be asked to defend his 
position and therefore must give careful thought to the ques- 
tion before answering. 
The leading question is so put that it clearly suggests the 
correct reply. It is possible to formulate a fundamental 
question so that pupils can read out of it the one answer 
involved. The question “Was Washington’s manceuvering 
around Yorktown, which resulted in Cornwallis’ surrender, 
influential in the ultimate success of the American cause?” 
may seem like a complicated one, and it is, but the answer 
to it is obvious. The pupil does not need to think over the 
information he possesses in order to answer it correctly. It 
requires practically no more mental effort on his part than 
when he answers the question, “Is the tiger a wild animal?” 
The alternating question is likewise almost valueless, for 
it limits the answer to one of two possibilities. ‘Has a 
plant-eating bird a long slender beak or not?” is a question 
with all of the same undesirable characteristics as the one, 
“Has the plant-eating bird a long slender beak?” The 
same weaknesses can be noted in the question, ‘Which crop 
is of the most worth to California, prunes or oranges?” If,
-P-A-G-E-251
  QUESTIONING 245 
however, a question of the latter type is such that the pupils 
choose sides with the object of each side’s honestly defend- 
ing its position in debate, in the hope of arriving at a true 
decision, then it has value. Hence, when the alternative 
answers possible give rise to a debatable issue, and that 
issue is used as a basis for a series of thoughtful activities 
resulting in a correct conclusion, the type of question pro- 
ducing this experience is worth while. 
Whatever type of question is used, there are certain char- 
acteristics which always distinguish a good question. It 
will be worth while to point these out briefly. All of these 
characteristics are essential if questioning is to fulfill its 
real function in the educative process; viz., that of guiding 
the pupil’s thinking and activity into educative channels, 
and inspiring him to achieve to his full capacity. 
In the first place, a good question should be clear and 
single in its purpose, so that it is easily understood by the 
pupils. The question which is vaguely understood will pro- 
duce unreliable responses. ‘“‘What about the Louisiana pur- 
chase from the French?” is a question, for example, which 
will call forth a variety of answers containing right responses 
and yet, from the point of view of the questioner, be wrong. 
Perhaps the best response from the observer’s judgment was 
that of the child who answered the teacher, “I don’t know 
just what you want.” The teacher then reworded the ques- 
tion, stating it as it should have been stated originally: 
‘‘What new policy was established by the United States in 
the purchase of the Louisiana Territory?” 
An examination of the last question will disclose many 
of the qualities of a good question. The question is definite, 
concise : and complete. It is, therefore, clear to the listener 
just what is is wanted by the questioner. Eighth grade pupils 
who have studied United States history to this point in the
-P-A-G-E-252
  246 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
rise of the nation should be able to answer this question. 
The vagueness of the first, however, would challenge even 
a specialist in this particular field of American history. 
A good question should, in the first place, be adapted to 
the experience and ability of the pupil. Otherwise it will be 
vague to the one questioned. Such a condition arises when 
the question asked is not within the range of a pupil’s 
ability and achievement. How essential it is to take pre- 
cautions to insure that the question is within the compre- 
hension of the pupil is very evident in all intelligence tests. 
Only questions involving the degree of comprehension which 
the individual has attained should be asked. Correct an- 
swers to the question, ‘‘What’s the thing to do, if you find 
that your house is on fire?” are given by a very large 
number of children, six years or more old. Five-year-old 
children, or younger ones, do not answer this question very 
well, because it is not yet within the range of their experi- 
ences and ability. On the other hand, they will respond 
readily to the question, ‘‘What must you do, when you are 
cold?” Therefore, we must ask only those questions which 
are within the range of the pupil’s ability and development, 
if we are interested in obtaining correct responses. 
In the second place, a question should be briefly and con- 
cisely stated. ‘This makes for ease of understanding, and 
renders the question comprehensible to pupils of vary- 
ing degrees of intelligence. Brief questions, also, avoid 
waste of time. It takes less time to state them and less to 
interpret them. They render the teacher less talkative. 
In the third place, a good economic question is related 
closely and intimately to the purpose and interests actuating 
the pupils at the time. This is necessary if they are expected 
to give the question their undivided attention, with resulting 
thoughtful effort. One of the examples of a good assign- 
   
-P-A-G-E-253
QUESTIONING 247 
ment indicates how pupils in the first grade will answer and 
even ask questions thoughtfully and with a great deal of 
interest when they deal with some activity which has caught 
their attention and which they are anxious to undertake. 
Through questions skillfully introduced by the teacher, the 
pupils were led to assemble information obtained in their 
previous experiences, to determine where they could find 
additional data, to make definite plans to carry out their 
project, and to begin on various assignments which would 
help them to solve the many problems involved in it. 
The fourth characteristic of a good question has to do 
with how it is presented to the group. Since questioning 
is for the purpose of guiding the entire group, each question 
should be so put that all the pupils are required to listen, 
understand, and try to think the answer. This result may be 
best secured by stating the question clearly, and then paus- 
ing, to give all the pupils time to organize their thinking, 
before calling upon one of them to answer. The reader 
will see many obvious reasons for following this formula. 
As has already been noted in distinguishing fact and reason 
questions, care should also be exercised in questioning so 
to put the question as to stimulate and require thought. 
Asking, ‘“What makes Chicago a great city?” does not 
make nearly the demand for careful thinking that is made 
if the teacher asks, ‘‘What do you think are the important 
factors which have helped to make a great city where 
Chicago is located?” The first appeals to the memory, 
while the second stimulates the pupil to think carefully and 
to reason accurately. The effects of good questioning mani- 
fest themselves likewise in the thoroughness with which 
pupils express the results of their efforts in a given subject. 
Not only is it important to formulate questions in the 
way described above; the manner and attitude of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
| 
248 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
teacher in asking a question has much to do with its effect- 
iveness. The teacher should put no question which she does 
not feel a genuine interest in asking. Then she should 
listen with real interest and seriousness to all worthy efforts 
to answer it. When possible, the teacher should ask pupils 
for pertinent information which might ‘come out of their 
individual experiences and which she might, thérefore, not 
possess. Such natural questions exercise all of the good 
effects on the pupils which have been pointed out in pre- 
vious paragraphs. Whatever procedures the teacher may 
use with economy to enable the pupils to feel and appre- 
ciate that they are partners with the teacher in the problem 
or project under way will exercise great influence in deep- 
ening their interest and efforts. 
The remaining points to be made regarding questioning 
may be best stated, perhaps, in terms of procedures to be 
avoided, as follows: 
First, do not repeat a question after it has once been 
properly stated and heard by all. If a teacher makes a 
practice of repeating her questions, she will soon create a 
very undesirable atmosphere of inattention in which careless 
answers on the part of the pupils soon appear. 
Second, teachers should not repeat the answers which 
pupils make to questions—largely for the same reasons that 
questions should not be repeated. The first correct re- 
sponse of the pupil is placed at a premium when it is not 
repeated. The person in any walk of life who has formed 
the habit of repeating the statements of those with whom 
he talks is considered an uninteresting conversationalist. 
If the teacher, who follows this practice is similarly consid- 
ered by pupils in her class, she has only herself to blame. 
Third, do not frame questions in the language of the text- 
book, or read questions to the class from a list printed in  
-P-A-G-E-255
QUESTIONING 249 
the textbook. Such questions are usually not adapted to 
the unique needs of the pupils nor to the special require- 
ments of the situation in which they are working. They 
are likely to mechanize the pupils’ efforts and produce super- 
ficial results. 
Fourth, do not call upon pupils in any fixed order, such 
as the order of seating or the alphabetical order. Such a 
practice is not good for several reasons. It is mechanical 
rather than rational. A pupil should be called upon for 
some good reason apparent in the situation and often to all 
or several members of the class. One essential of a good 
manner of questioning, as noted above, is that it shall 
require each pupil to look upon the question as a personal 
one that he is expected to think about and answer. 
Fifth, do not call upon a few pupils for practically all of 
the responses. Certain bright pupils are always ready to 
respond. The temptation to use them unduly is sometimes 
great. So doing enables the work to move with apparent 
smoothness and dispatch. But such a practice is very un- 
wise, because its results are not a true index of the progress 
of the class and because it is discouraging to those who are 
called upon but little. Justice and fairness require that the 
work and opportunities to respond should be distributed as 
evenly as possible among all tlie pupils. In fact, it is part 
of the teacher’s duty to plan questions which are within the 
range of comprehension of the less gifted children. If such 
children are to feel that they have a worthy part in what 
is going on, they must have opportunities to recite success- 
fully, thus being stimulated to their further best efforts and 
to a proper self-confidence. 
Sixth, do not do too much questioning. Develop other 
ways than questioning of securing effort on the part of 
pupils and progress in the work. Many evils arise from toe 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
250 MODERN, METHODS IN TEACHING 
much questioning. In the first place, it produces a highly 
strung nervous tension on the part of pupils and teacher, 
whereas there should be natural and normal conditions for 
thinking and reflection. From her observation of one hun- 
dred recitations in six subjects, Dr. Stevens derived data 
from which the following table is constructed:

This table shows that on the average, questions were put 
at the rate of about two per minute of the actual teaching 
time (about thirty-five minutes) in a forty-five minute reci- 
tation period. With such speed, deliberate senting and 
careful reasoning are impossible. 
In the second place, so much questioning means that the 
teacher rather than the pupils is doing most of the work 
and thinking, whereas this situation needs to be reversed, 
if pupil growth is to result. In a one-page stenographic 
report of a history lesson, the teacher used 444 words while 
the pupils used but 82 words. In a three-page stenographic 
report of a chemistry recitation, the pupils spoke but 113 
words. In the entire twenty stenographic lessons, it was
-P-A-G-E-257
QUESTIONING 251 
found that the teacher did 64 per cent of the talking while 
the pupils, collectively, 20 to 40 per class, did but 36 per cent. 
In the third place, questions cannot produce the results 
expected from them when they are put at such rapid-fire 
rate. Only mere verbal memory and the most superficial 
thinking are employed. Reflective thinking and careful 
reasoning are wholly impossible. 
In the fourth place, such speed in questioning makes 
impossible any adequate opportunities for the pupils to 
express themselves with care or completeness or for the 
teacher to give the pupils training in good expression. The 
answers, quoted below, from the stenographic report of an 
English lesson, made for Dr. Stevens, shows the limited 
opportunities for expression which these pupils had: 
“Five.” 
“On the second syllable.” 
“T don’t know.” 
“Too choppy.” 
“Flashes.” 
“By flashes was the darkened wood lighted.” 
“T think ‘The darkened wood by flashes was lit up’.”” 
“No, too many syllables in the first part.” 
“Blinding to sight.” 
“Can you have any rhyme in blank verse?” ‘ 
“Too many syllables.” 
“That is a rhyme.” 
“No, I don’t think so.” 
“Three out of five.” 
“Four out of five.” 
“Ves.” 
“Rain? and ‘twain’ a rhyme.” 
“When he started to draw the circle.” “c Yes.” 
“Very good.” \
-P-A-G-E-258
  252 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
During the first twenty minutes of this recitation, pupils 
expressed themselves forty-seven times in brief answers 
similar to those just quoted. Three answers occupied a few 
words more than one line, and one answer occupied two 
lines. No answer required more than one sentence. By 
actual count, during the first twenty minutes of this lesson, 
the teacher was doing 85 per cent of the work while the 
pupils, collectively, did but 15 per cent. 
It must be evident from the foregoing that questions 
should be so regulated in number and in the speed with 
which they are asked that the following qualities may char- 
acterize pupil’s answers to them. 
An acceptable answer must (1) be an adequate response 
to the question asked; (2) be as purposeful as the question; 
(3) represent the best effort of which the pupil is capable; 
(4) be well expressed—clear, concise, definite, and complete.  
-P-A-G-E-259
CHAPTER XVIII 
The Review 
The review as a type of teaching procedure assumes new 
meaning to the teacher who is guiding his class to learn 
through natural activities. The concept of the term 
“review”? in this chapter is the same as that in general use. 
The review involves the recalling to consciousness of such 
knowledge, habits, skills, and attitudes as have been 
acquired through past experiences, and their reorganization 
to meet some new felt need. It may occur in almost every 
phase of the learning process, from the first codperative 
planning of the work in the classroom to its completion. 
Hence, the review may be an integral part of the planning 
of the new activities to be undertaken by the pupils. It 
is, very generally, a phase of the modern assignment. 
Frequently, the efforts of pupils while studying must in- 
clude it. Invariably, it constitutes a significant aspect of 
each procedure. It is an important aspect of the work 
involved in solving a problem or executing a project. 
It is the best foundation upon which the performer builds 
his appreciation lesson if his audience is to be interested. 
Surely, economy in drilling, memorizing, or developing a 
skill requires that the learner utilize the review in order to 
determine his own shortcomings and so place the practice 
emphasis on the discovered weaknesses. These phases of 
the review were presented in considerable detail in Part II, 
and therefore need not be repeated here. 
253 a  
-P-A-G-E-260
254 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
The function of the review is implied in the preceding 
paragraph. It is to provide the pupil with the means for 
reorganizing familiar materials from a new point of view, 
and for establishing relationships between hitherto unre- 
lated experiences and their unrelated outcomes. This in- 
volves the expanding and fixing of essential outcomes—the 
products of past experiences—through new experiences re- 
quiring their recall and use. The most important experi- 
ences must be repeated, utilizing new subject matter when- 
ever possible. Hence the review is a means of relating the 
old to the new so that growth will be natural, gradual, and 
efficient. 
In making the review a functional aspect of teaching 
technique, the teacher must keep in mind certain purposes 
which it fulfills. The most important are as follows: (1) 
Effective reviewing will help the pupils to reorganize sub- 
ject matter and activities from a new point of view, so that 
they may acquire a better understanding of the former, and 
greater returns from the latter. (2) It is a means of secur- 
ing interest in some new phase of subject matter and direct- 
ing the children’s activities into new channels of experience 
in which they will find need for utilizing it. (3) It is the 
tool in the teaching procedure by means of which the 
teacher can uncover to the pupil his strength and weak- 
nesses, what essentials he needs to fix better, what new 
ones he needs to acquire and how he can help himself in 
his future work through the gains he has already made. 
When so used, the review places the teacher in the eyes of 
the pupil as one who is a valuable guide rather than a 
harsh judge. 
The discussion of the pupils and teacher in the sixth 
grade lesson cited in the first chapter of Part III, with 
respect to the planning of a pageant, illustrates these points. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  ‘THE REVIEW 258 
In the course of planning what to do, the children learned 
what had not been done sufficiently well in the previous 
year and therefore needed their further attention. The 
past experience of each group was shared with others, and 
out of it all a new plan was evolved. 
The purposes of the children did not differ greatly from 
those of the teacher. The review furnished them with 
sound motives, interests, and purposes for undertaking a 
series of activities. Conceived in their true perspective, by 
means of the review, the real value of these activities, from 
the point of view of work aswell as of play, became apparent. 
In conducting the review work of the class, whether it is 
written or oral, the teacher should be guided by several 
principles. Perhaps there is no other time in the learning 
process when it is so important for the teacher to have 
uppermost in his thinking the laws of learning. These laws 
have been restated so many times in the development of 
the principles which apply to the various teaching pro- 
cedures that their repetition at this time is unnecessary. 
The reader will readily make the application to this par- 
ticular phase of teaching procedure. 
“A review of the outcomes which have been acquired 
through past experience provides the means of relating 
\\ them to future learning. It develops new aims on the part 
/ of the pupils, prepares them for embarking upon new experi- 
| ences, and creates for them a true perspective of their new 
\ learning. This principle is very well illustrated by the 
account in Chapter X of how the kindergarten children 
demolished and rebuilt their floor block house. The new 
activity grew out of the old, the pupils profiting by their 
past experience and by their knowledge of the accepted 
standards of what constitutes an orderly house. New ideas 
obtained from home had to be related to the old ones in     
   
-P-A-G-E-262
256 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
order that the right kind of house might be constructed the 
second. time. 
By carefully guiding the review, the teacher will be able 
to determine what desired educational results have not yet 
been assimilated or mastered. A fourth grade review, 
which involved an explanation by the pupils who had con- 
structed it, of a floor map of their native state, led the 
teacher to see that they had failed to learn as they should 
have in what ways their own state was dependent upon 
other states and upon the rest of the world. Hence she 
knew that the pupils needed to undertake a third activity 
especially involving this aspect of geography. The review 
was utilized to point out to the class their serious short- 
coming. The result of the discussion which followed was 
the decision to make geography booklets entitled “Our 
State and the Rest of the World.” 
This example also illustrates another principle to be 
kept in mind. The review should deal with relevant 
material. In general, details of lesser importance should be 
omitted. In this way the essentials will be raised to 
greater prominence. 
At the conclusion of any unit of work, there should nearly 
always be a review. But when the review is used in this 
way, for the purpose of examining pupils, it is not so ef- 
fective a learning tool as it becomes when it is used to form 
the basis of a new series of experiences. The best type of 
review, then, is that which is a natural activity growing out 
of a preceding natural activity. How the review can be 
made a natural activity is exemplified by the work of the 
second and third grade children who had taken an imag- 
inary trip around the world and studied child life in many, 
many lands. When the class had completed the trip, the 
teachers felt that there were many good reasons for review-

ing the essentials of the information involved. The pupils 
and teachers, therefore, planned a miniature world’s fair 
which required not only the making and decorating of 
booths for the various countries, and the planning and pre- 
senting of a program, but also the writing and presenting 
orally of a series of reports. The last-mentioned activity 
constituted the children’s own explanation of their previous 
activities to the superintendent of schools and the members 
of the board of education, who were the special guests at 
the fair. Two of the pupils’ reports will illustrate the use 
of the review as a normal effort in child experiences. 
In preparing the guests for the appreciation of the pro- 
gram, one of the boys reported as follows: 
Our SPEAKERS 
We have had several people come to school to talk to us. 
While we were in China, Dr. Wong of the University of Cali- 
fornia came to talk to us. He told us about the queer schools 
in China. The children have to turn their backs to the teacher 
when they recite. 
While we were in India, Miss Bentley came in and gave us a 
talk. She talked to us a whole hour, and we could have listened 
longer. 
While we were in Italy, Miss Hartwell happened to visit our 
room. She told us how the little children of Rome are taught 
to beg. She said that one day a beggar boy came up and begged 
for money. When she refused to give him anything, he opened 
his eyes and ran away laughing. 
While we were in Germany, Mrs. Howard of the High School 
came and talked to the whole school. She told us about the 
old castles on the Rhine. She also told us about the clock at 
Strassburg. She brought with her many lovely pictures. She 
sent us some little French dolls to look at. 
While we were in Sweden, one of our teachers in this school, 
Miss Kinell, came in to talk to us. She told us about Christmas

258 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
in Sweden. Instead of a Santa Claus they have—I bet you 
can’t guess—a goat. 
We have been enjoying our whole trip very much. 
A second pupil made the following report: 
Nature Srupy 
As we went from one country to the other we found many 
kinds of climate. We found very cold weather in Alaska, but 
in India and Egypt we found just the opposite—very, very 
warm. We found many of the same kinds of wild flowers on 
our trip as we have at home. Our California poppy is a beau- 
tiful orange color, but in France it is red. We had fun learning 
about the different kinds of trees in each of the countries. We 
also learned about the different animals in each country. 
In the chapter on the project method of learning, the 
illustration taken from a sixth grade activity, the planning 
of a playground, shows the use of the review in a series of 
reports summarizing the work and findings of the pupils. 
Such a review was very valuable because of the added 
motive of actually recommending a playground plan which 
was to be followed in equipping the school’s playground. 
Such a motive as they had was far superior to what would 
have been true if the review had taken the form of merely 
“cramming” for an examination. 
Throughout the book many examples of good ways of 
using the review have been included. The reader will recall 
many others which he has seen or experienced. Additional 
examples are therefore not needed here. 
In conclusion, one question which teachers frequently 
ask needs to be answered. ‘‘When shall I set aside time 
for review?”’ This question, of course, applies to the more 
general type of review in which there occurs a summing-up 
of the most important values obtained from a unit of com-

pleted work. When the material is of such a nature that 
automatization of it is essential, and this has been accom- 
plished through drill lessons, repetition should occur in new 
experiences at frequent intervals of increasing length. 
When the review consists of an application of that which 
Kas been gained through ’a series of activities, the impor- 
tance of the experience or of the subject matter involved 
is the only basis upon which to determine when, and how 
much time should be set aside. Whenever the teacher feels 
that unification of experiences or essential subject matter 
is necessary, taking time to direct a review in the class 
in any of the ways suggested will be justifiable. The teacher 
should remember that the review which tests her own 
teaching, as any good review does, is valuable to the pupils.

  CHAPTER XIX 
Scientific Tests in Education and Their Use 
In comparatively recent years the field of education has be- 
come a center of scientific research. Efforts in this direction 
have been productive of marked achievements in the sound 
understanding of (1) what the fundamental purposes underly- 
ing teachingare, (2) what should be taught in order that learn- 
ing shall contribute to progress and development, and (3) 
whatmethods should be followed so that learning will be most 
effective and economic. Until science had contributed to the 
solution of these problems, teachers were forced to trust to 
opinion based largely upon guesswork as to what they should 
teach, how they should teach, and why they should teach. In 
elementary education particularly this uncertainty and blind 
groping is being replaced by scientific data which deal directly 
with the why, what, and how of that education which con- 
tribute to the development of a socially efficient person. 
The time has arrived when it is essential for every teacher 
to acquire an understanding of scientific methods in educa- 
tion and an appreciation of the valuable assistance which 
these methods can render in removing many of the obstacles 
which he faces. In a considerable part of his work he may 
now rely upon scientific data for understanding what he is 
doing and ‘checking up the achievement of his pupils. He 
has at his command scientific means of diagnosing the needs 
and shortcomings of pupils and therefore does not have to 
trust, as formerly to vague and unsatisfactory opinion. 
260
-P-A-G-E-267
    SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 261 
Probably tlie field of scientific research most important 
to teachers is that of scientific tests and measurements. 
The experts in educational research have been for some 
years contributing partial and accumulative answers to three 
questions which teachers have always raised. These ques- 
tions may be stated as follows: 
1. How can we determine the native ability or inherited 
intelligence of the children in our classes? 
2. How can we determine their educational needs and the 
progress each is making in meeting them? 
3. To what extent are our pupils achieving up to their capac- 
ity? ‘ 
In their efforts to answer the first question Binet, Terman, 
Goddard, Yerkes and others have constructed scales for 
measuring the intelligence of human beings by means of 
individual examinations. These educational scientists rec- 
ognize frankly that we do not know what intelligence is but 
that we do know what it does. Hence in the analogous 
sense that we do not know what electricity is, but recognize 
its attributes and through this knowledge make use of it, 
the psychologists have developed the testing of intelligence 
into an educational means. 
We know that practically all human beings have memory, 
are able to reason, adjust themselves to new situations, 
acquire knowledge, and develop comprehension. By deter- 
mining to what degree an individual has these qualities we 
are able to establish an index of his mental development. 
With this in mind the psychologists have formulated a large 
number of questions, problems, and situations. By the use 
of this material in the careful study of children and adults 
of varying ages, experts have determined the age degree of 
ability required for satisfactory responses. The elements 
which it was found measured most accurately age units of
-P-A-G-E-268
262 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
ability were selected and grouped according to their scien- 
tifically determined values. These were organized into 
scales for measuring the mentality of individuals. The use 
of these new measuring sticks makes possible an under- 
standing of the native intelligence upon which we have to 
build an educational program in the classroom. 
Through study and practice in the use of these intelli- 
gence tests under the direction of experts who understand 
and use them properly, teachers can become proficient in a 
very short time in administering these tests. Facility in the 
use of this scientific tool adds to the efficiency of the teacher 
because he is thereby better enabled to cope with the per- 
plexing educational problems presented by the individual 
differences of the children in his classroom. He can obtain, 
by testing, a record, or index, of the actual differences in 
mental capacity in different children. For example, if he 
were testing a third grade he might, and generally would, 
find in his class three or more children 8 years of age chrono- 
logically. Although these children have lived the same 
number of years, their mental development may be quite 
different. The tests may show that Pupil A has the men- 
tality of a 6-year-old child, Pupil B the mentality of an 
8-year-old, and Pupil C the mentality of a 10-year-old. 
The mental age of A therefore is only 75 per cent of his 
chronological age, while that of B is 100 per cent, and of 
C, 125 per cent. These percentages or quotients are desig- 
nated the Intelligence Quotients of these children; that is, 
the Intelligence Quotient of an individual is the ratio of his 
mental age to his chronological age. 
Having determined these quotients for all of the children 
in his class, the teacher has at hand the scientific informa- 
tion which enables him to classify his pupils into compar- 
able mental groups. He has an index of what achievement
-P-A-G-E-269
SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 263 
and rate of achievement he may expect each child to ap- 
proximate. In planning for the progress of the various 
individuals he has the data which indicates the normal rate 
of progress of each in terms of his mentality. The class 
divisions made by means of mental testing are more accu- 
rate, more meaningful, and more reliable, and the progress 
to be expected of each pupil can be predicted or foretold 
with almost scientific accuracy. 
The time and energy required to give an individual test 
to each of the children in a regular classroom, valuable 
though the results may be, are very considerable. The devel- 
opment of group intelligence tests, first by Otis and later 
by Thorndike, Whipple, Haggerty, Terman, Yerkes, and 
others has made possible an economic procedure for measur- 
ing intelligence. Such tests as the National Intelligence 
Test, Army Alpha, and Terman Group Intelligence Tests 
are acceptable for testing large groups of children at the 
same time. Some of the group intelligence tests which have 
been produced and marketed are not very reliable however. 
Therefore, the teacher should seek authoritative advice in 
selecting a group intelligence test. 
When a test has been selected and applied to a class it 
has been found advisable to measure by an individual test 
the extreme cases; i.e. the ones about which the teacher 
still feels doubtful. In general this amounts to testing by 
means of an individual intelligence test approximately the 
highest 10 per cent and lowest ro per cent of the class. 
In attempts to answer the second question (what are the 
needs of children and how well are they being met?) authors 
have marketed literally hundreds of educational tests. The 
purpose of these has been to measure the actual achieve- 
ment of children in the subject matter of various school 
subjects. Courtis, Ayres, Thorndike, Starch, Monroe,  
-P-A-G-E-270
  264 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
Buckingham, Charters, and many other experts in educa- 
tional research have devised tests and scales in efforts to . 
measure the amount of knowledge retained and skills devel- 
oped in the use of materials in arithmetic, reading, spelling, 
and other subjects. For example, Professor Thorndike has 
constructed a scale for measuring the visual vocabulary or 
the word knowledge which children have acquired at various 
ages and in various grades. Woody and McCall have 
devised two forms of a test for measuring the achievement 
of pupils in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi- 
sion. The handwriting scales by Thorndike and by Ayres 
have been constructed so as to contain specimens of pen- 
manship ranging from very illegible to very legible exam- 
ples with which any person’s writing may be compared and 
scaled accordingly. Similarly scientific means for measur- 
ing rate and comprehension in silent reading, the attain- 
ment of children in spelling and progress in other sub- 
jects which teachers desire to know about have been 
provided. 
The giving of these tests is a very simple process which 
teachers can learn very readily. Simple instructions are 
provided for the teacher so that he can test his class and 
score the results. Also the instructions to be givén the chil- 
dren are formulated into simple statements and directions 
which are to be followed without deviation by the teacher 
in using the tests. 
All tests have been planned and constructed to provide 
~means for evaluating the achievements of a child by com- 
parison with hundreds, or thousands, of other children of 
his own age or grade. The average of the scores made by 
the children of a grade in all types and kinds of schools is 
set up as the standard for the test?- When the average score 
has been found by giving the same test to a large number 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  
SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 265 
of children of the same age, this average of the scores is 
the scientific index of attainment which is called the norm. 
These two types of scientific score values, the standard for 
grade scores and the norm for age scores, provide concrete, 
numerical measures with which the achievement of any 
individual may be compared. 
The teacher can see readily the value of using these types 
of measures determined for an educational test as illus- 
trated in the following example: For the Woody-McCall 
Arithmetic Test in the mixed fundamentals the grade 
standard for the finishing fourth grade has been found to 
be 18.5. The age norm for the average child who has just 
become to years of age is 18.3. Pupil A, who is about to 
finish the fourth grade, is 1014 years old and has scored 19 
on this test. Apparently he is not achieving quite as high 
a score as the norm for the average child of his own age. 
However, he is attaining results up to the standard estab- 
lished for the grade he is finishing. Therefore, in this sub- 
ject the teacher has a scientific basis to support his judg- 
ment that Pupil A should be promoted. On the other hand, 
Pupil B who is the same age as Pupil A and in the same 
class scored, let us say, 15.8 on the Woody-McCall Test. 
The standard score for the finishing third grade is 13 and 
the ‘norm for 9-year-old children is 15.2. Hence, Pupil B 
scored far below the standard and norm for his grade and 
age respectively. Hence he is not ready to make the same 
progress as Pupil A. Pupil C, 10 years of age and in the 
same class, scored 20.9. The standard for finishing the fifth 
grade is 24 and the norm for 11-year-old children is 21.5. 
Therefore, Pupil C is not only ready for promotion to the 
__low fifth grade, but could be prepared easily to take his 
place in a still higher grade. A similar analysis of the 
achievements in the other subjects based on the results:
-P-A-G-E-272
  266 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
obtained by using educational tests would prove very 
valuable in solving many of our classroom problems. 
The most serious problem which the teacher must face 
in selecting an educational test for use in his class is that 
of obtaining the best. Some tests are very good and others 
very poor. Therefore careful selection must be the guiding 
principle in deciding upon a test. Teachers should raise cer- 
tain questions such as are discussed below with respect to a 
group of tests and select the one which meets most satisfac- 
torily the requirements set up. If the following five questions 
cannot be answered in the affirmative with respect to a test 
the teacher should seriously question its scientific validity. 
1. Has the test been validated? That is, does it measure 
what it purports to measure? The author of a test must 
submit scientific evidence to show conclusively that in de- 
veloping his test he has controlled or checked up his testing 
situation so that the sole product of his test is the measure- 
ment of the specific thing measured. For example, the 
author of a test in measuring comprehension of silent read- 
ing must be able to prove that he has measured comprehen- 
sion in silent reading and not the ability of children to solve 
puzzles, to adjust to complicated reading situations, or to 
rely on native ability. 
2. Does the test provide for objectivity of measurement; 
that is, if the group of children were able to erase from their 
minds the experience of taking the test under one person 
and were given an opportunity to take it again under the 
direction of a different person, would the results be the 
same? In the author’s answer to this question he must 
show that the instructions to a test, both for giving and for 
scoring, are so simple and explicit that the difference in the 
results obtained when given by different individuals will be 
a negligible quantity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 267 
3. Isthe test reliable? That is, will it give the same result 
if given a second time in the same situation under the same 
circumstances? The author of a test must submit evidence 
that any form of the test will give the same results as any 
other form, all other conditions remaining the same. He 
must be able to show conclusively by means of scientific 
evidence that there is no reason to doubt that children will 
attain the same result tomorrow as they have achieved 
today if they could be placed in the same situation and 
under the same circumstances. 
4. Has the test been graded, or better still, scaled? Has 
the difficulty of each section of the test been determined by 
an actual test of large numbers of children and these parts 
arranged so that they appear in an ascending order of diffi- 
culty from easiest to most difficult? This requires the maker 
of a test to determine mathematically score values for each 
element or part of a test and to provide a sufficient number 
of parts so that the easiest one can be answered correctly by 
practically every child in the class and the most difficult one 
can be answered by almost none. Also in the time allowed 
for giving the test the poorest child will have achieved a 
measurable result and the best child will not have completed 
the test. When these conditions have been met, the achieve- 
ment of every member of the class can be ascertained. 
A graded test becomes a scaled one when score values for 
the test are mathematically related. On a scaled test an 
accomplishment of 8 is equal to twice as much as an accom- 
plishment of 4. Also the difference between scores 5 and 6 
is comparable to the difference between scores 7 and 8 or 
any other two consecutive scores. Not many of the edu- 
cational tests have been so scaled, but grading, that is, 
ranging from easiest to most difficult, has been resorted to 
in a large number of cases.   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  268 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
5. Has the test been standardized? This can have been 
done only by giving the test to a large number of repre- 
sentative children. On the basis of their attainments, 
standards for the grades which they represent, and norms 
for the ages of these children, can be established. 
After requiring that a test be so constructed that it is 
validated, objective, reliable, scaled, and standardized, the 
teacher may find several such tests which are satisfactory 
in these respects. In order to determine the one he should 
use he should analyze them to see first how applicable they 
are to the situation he proposes to measure; secondly, how 
interesting they are; that is, what appeal they will make to 
the children; thirdly, how many forms of the same test 
exist in case one or more additional tests are to be made; 
and finally, how diagnostic each test may be. 
The last factor mentioned requires a study of the possi- 
bilities of tabulating the series of elements measured to 
determine strengths and weaknesses in the specific subject 
measured. For example, a test in addition is more diag- 
nostic if it contains examples of different addition combi- 
nations, such as bridging the tens, single column addition, 
and carrying with and without broken columns, than if it 
measures only column addition involving carrying. This 
may not always be essential. Therefore, it may deserve 
only secondary consideration in selecting a test for use. 
In reviewing the questions which have been raised as to 
what constitutes a good educational test, the purposes and 
values in educational tests as such are readily seen. They 
provide means for diagnosing the strengths as well as the 
weaknesses of individual pupils, classes, schools, and even 
of school systems. Hence they indicate to the teacher 
what improvement of the child is the most needed, and 
where the least effort needs to be directed. The teacher has
-P-A-G-E-275
SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 269 
for his guidance a mathematical index of the achievement 
in his class or of individual pupils by means of which he 
can compare their attainments with those of others of the 
same age or grade in the subject measured. He is also able 
to determine how much more stress, or less, needs to be 
placed on this particular subject. Therefore, the educa- 
tional tests are valuable in determining scientifically (1) the 
readiness of pupils for promotion, (2) the classification of 
children into comparable groups of achievement in each 
specific subject, and (3) the additional achievement these 
groups need to make. 
The third question involving the relation of a child’s 
achievement to his ability has been receiving attention 
only in the last few years. The most valuable scientific 
progress in this field has been made possible by the work 
of Franzen. By determining the mentality of the child and 
his achievement in a specific subject, Professor Franzen has 
obtained a quotient which he has called the accomplish- 
ment quotient of a child with respect to the educational 
subject in which he was tested. For example, if a boy in 
the fifth grade was found to have a mental age of 10 years 
and a spelling age of 9 years on the Ayres Spelling List, 
his spelling accomplishment quotient was 90. Hence he 
was only attaining go per cent of what it would seem reason- 
able to expect or demand of him. 
Two additional cases will illustrate how valuable this 
type of scientific measurement can be to the teacher. In 
a fifth grade in a certain school Pupil X who was 12 years 
of age was found to have the mentality of a 10-year-old. 
In the Thorndike-McCall Test for silent reading a score 
indicated that he had the reading ability of a child 914 
years old. The quotient of his mental age and chronological 
age indicated that he had an intelligence quotient of 83. The  
-P-A-G-E-276
  270 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
quotient of his reading age and chronological age indicated a 
reading quotient of 79. Therefore, when these two quotients 
were related, Pupil X was found to have a reading accom- 
plishment of 95 per cent of what might be expected of him. 
Hence he was practically reading up to his ability and 
though over age could not be pressed to improve any 
faster than he was progressing. 
On the other hand, Pupil Y in the same room was 10 
years of age and on an intelligence test was found to have 
the mentality equivalent to a 13-year-old child, and on the 
reading test established a reading age of 11 years. His in- 
telligence quotient was therefore 130, and his reading quo- 
tient 110. But his reading accomplishment quotient was 
not 85. Hence, Pupil Y though doing much better than 
Pupil X or even what his own chronological age seemed to 
indicate as possible, was in reality achieving only 85 per 
cent of what his ability or general intelligence disclosed him 
capable of doing. 
All these examples serve to illustrate how the individual 
differences of children may be accurately determined by an 
expert in educational research and the information be made 
available so that teachers can cope with the individual dif- 
ferences found. The following table has been included to 
indicate how mental and educational tests aid in classify- 
ing the children into groups of comparable mental units. 
Group I constituted the highest division which a teacher 
of the low fifth grade determined upon as testing and for 
which he felt justified in planning a rapid progress program. 
Group II constituted the weakest section of the same class, 
for which he had to provide a suitable program. 
In using scientific measurements in an actual classroom 
situation the teacher should take advantage of every factor 
that he can bring to bear on his problem. In addition to 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 271 
relying upon mental and educational tests he should deter- 
mine the progress of the individual members of his class, 
the age for the grade, health conditions, and home environ- 
ment. These modify occasionally the decision which a 
teacher will make or the procedure he will follow. The 
most important values which a teacher can obtain from the 
use of scientific tests, therefore, consist in their contribution 
of serviceable materials toward the solution of the prob- 
lems involved in the diagnosis of children’s needs, their 
classification, and their promotion. 
The examples just cited are indicative of how intelligence 
and educational tests assist in determining the promotion 
of pupils according to individual natural rates of progress. 
Having determined the general intelligence and present 
achievements of any individual or group of mentally com- 
parable individuals, it becomes a relatively easy matter for 
the teacher to determine the next steps which provide ade- 
quate opportunity for progress. Similarly, having deter- 
mined by scientific means which pupils in a class have ap- 
proximately the same mentality and achievement in most 
subjects, the teacher has little to worry about with respect 
to how well he is classifying his children into comparable 
groups. Also the same data afford a means of checking 
up the strengths and weaknesses of each child or of each 
group and therefore make possible provision to take care 
of scientifically determined needs. 
Groups I and II in the table illustrate a situation in 
which the teacher has faced all three of these problems. A 
comparison of the two groups will disclose how well the 
children had been classified into comparable units. Within 
the possible limits of the class each group consisted of chil- 
dren of comparable mentality and comparable achievement. 
The two groups present a marked contrast, the first being 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  272 MODERN METHODS IN TEACHING 
marked by high mentality and superior achievement and 
the second by low mentality and inferior achievement. 
Having classified the pupils the teacher’s next problem 
was to determine promotional possibilities. The program

for Group I became one of providing for ‘progress more 
rapid than normal. That for Group II was one of bringing 
it up to a place where normal promotion was possible and 
also justifiable in the interest of the normal group.

SCIENTIFIC TESTS AND THEIR USE 273 
Pupil 4 in Group I and Pupil 6 in Group II illustrate 
cases in which diagnosis was applied. In the first case the 
pupil was evidently ahead of her group in reading but 
behind in arithmetic. An examination of her arithmetic 
tests disclosed that the low score in arithmetical reasoning 
as well as in the mixed fundamentals was due to inaccura- 
cies. A careful study of the inaccuracies revealed by the use 
of the Woody-McCall Arithmetic Test disclosed that this 
particular pupil was not sure of her multiplication combi- 
nations. Hence the teacher had at hand the information 
he needed in order to provide for correction; and it was 
easy to see where the time could be obtained from the 
pupil’s program so that this correction could be economi- 
cally and effectively provided. In the case of Pupil 6 the 
reverse situation was encountered. This pupil was doing 
good work in arithmetic fundamentals but in arithmetical 
reasoning and reading she had fallen far below her group. 
A study of the results obtained by the use of the Thorn- 
dike Vocabulary Test indicated that the source of her 
trouble was a limited knowledge of words, and the necessary 
corrective measures were accordingly applied. A later series 
of tests disclosed a great improvement in achievement both 
in arithmetical reasoning and in reading. 
The above examples are illustrative of many common 
classroom problems in promotion, classification, and diag- 
nosis which teachers have been able to solve by utilizing the 
results obtained from the employment of scientific tests.

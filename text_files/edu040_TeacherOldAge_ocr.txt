  INTRODUCTION 
By Davip SNEDDEN 
Commissioner of Education for the State of Massachusetts. 
Tue calling of the public-school teacher is not 
yet, in America, a profession. But everywhere 
the earnest friends of education are striving to 
transform teaching from a temporary and often 
casual employment into a vocation exhibiting 
something of the systematic preparation, the 
stability, the progressiveness, and the dignity of 
a profession. 
Some of the means that have been found help- 
ful in improving the professional status of the 
teacher are: professional training, both before 
and during service; state certification; more per- 
manent tenure; skilled supervision; promotion to 
higher rank or salary on the basis of merit; and 
more attractive financial compensation for work 
done. 
Many educators and other students of social 
economy now believe that the systematic provi- 
sion of retirement allowances for superannuated 
or otherwise incapacitated teachers will operate 
v

  INTRODUCTION 
in a variety of ways toward making teaching a 
more attractive and a more serviceable calling. 
Confessedly, many factors in the situation are 
yet obscure, for we know little that is conclusive 
about the problems of social psychology involved. 
Experience shows that no public employment 
will resolutely dismiss faithful servants who have 
become incapacitated, if these possess no re- 
sources to fall back upon. But in no other field, 
probably, is it so hard, as it is in the public-school 
service, to find minor positions which aged and 
broken workers can take up, without sacrificing 
their self-respect; and certainly it would be hard 
to find a department in which the ailing or 
decrepit worker can_do greater harm, than in 
the schoolroom where, perhaps, twoscore eager, 
restless children, with all t their possibilities of 
malformation of mind a and cl haracter, must spend 
precious years “of their lives. It is, therefore, of 
the titmost importance that the teaching service, 
which has now nearly five hundred thousand 
employees, and on which is expended nearly 
$500,000,000 annually, should be enabled to 
ere and satisfactory retirement_to

INTRODUCTION 
ers, no matter what their financial circumstances 
may be; practically, and humanly, they do not, 
and will not, do so. 
Another object contemplated in a teachers’ 
retirement system is to give to those still in the 
active period of their service a sense of security, 
and opportunity for undivided attention to the 
calls of the profession. Teachers in general, and 
especially those most capable of single-minded 
interest in the service, are, for temperamental 
and other reasons, at a disadvantage in making 
investments, except such as yield lowest returns. 
There can be little doubt that society will gain 
by any successful attempt to render the teacher 
more secure as to her future and less preoccu- 
pied with the worry of business affairs during 
active service. The realization of such a condi- 
tion will also weigh with those persons who have 
most to contribute to the profession of teaching, 
and will encourage them to enter and to remain 
in this calling. 
In all civilized countries the principles of com- 
pulsory social insurance are finding application in 
public and in private employment. Many care- 
ful students are convinced that inevitably social 
insurance will soon prevail universally. The 
teaching profession is seemingly one of the forms 
vii
-P-A-G-E-8
  
  INTRODUCTION 
of employment to be soonest considered in this 
respect. 
Two fundamental principles lie at the bottom 
of social insurance. The first is that by each 
individual, or on his behalf, during the period 
of life when he is capable of producing more 
than a bare subsistence, provision shall be made 
compulsorily against one or more of such future 
contingencies as death, accident, disease, super- 
annuation, and unemployment, whereby his 
productive power is stopped or reduced to the 
possible harm of himself or those dependent 
upon him. The second is that the making of this 
provision shall be required and, under some cir- 
cumstances, assisted by the collective will speak- 
ing through the State, which will also guarantee 
the secure investment and conservation of the 
contributions made by the individual. 
From the standpoint of these principles of 
social economy which underlie social insurance, 
the conditions surrounding the teacher’s profes- 
sion which seem to justify proposals for a retire- 
ment system actually differ in degree only, and 
not in kind, from the conditions surrounding 
other public and private callings. In the present 
rapidly developing demand for more efficient 
public education, it is, of course, socially expe- 
viii
-P-A-G-E-9
INTRODUCTION 
dient that everything possible shall be done to 
encourage the most capable people to enter upon 
teaching as a career, to give to it all the training 
and devotion possible, to follow it with undivided 
interest, and to retire willingly when their effec- 
tiveness shall have become impaired. Hence, 
the widespread popular interest in teachers’ 
retirement systems at the present time in al- 
most all educationally progressive states in the 
country. 
In enacting legislation for teachers’ retirement 
systems there is a peculiar need of statesmanship 
of a high and far-seeing order. In few other 
fields is there so great danger that immediate and 
individual considerations will obscure the larger 
issues involved. It is said that old teachers are 
too poor to make contributions; that teachers are 
not paid what they are worth; that teachers, not 
yet old, but in broken health, should be enabled 
to retire on a fair allowance; that retirement 
allowances should be sufficient to maintain the 
accustomed standard of living; that teachers 
should not be compelled to retire until they 
themselves think they have become inefficient; 
—these, and a hundred other incidental and 
conflicting considerations, are liable to over- 
shadow the main principles involved. Quite 
ix

  INTRODUCTION 
naturally, in view of the history of pensions, the 
“straight pension” from the State is the first 
goal of the teacher’s efforts. But as to-day 
viewed by the best students of social insurance, 
the “straight pension” from the State is like the 
unwise charity which suggested the parody “It 
is twice cursed — it curseth him that gives, and 
also him that takes.”’ In the estimation of the 
writer, at least, there is imminent danger in the 
disposition of teachers’ organizations to advo- 
cate the principle of the non-contributory retire- 
ment allowance — the so-called “straight pen- 
sion.” Surely nothing will serve better as an 
index of the professional character of teachers 
and their organizations than their ability to rise 
superior to special and temporary interests 
where proposals to found a lasting system of 
social insurance for teachers are under considera- 
tion. Vested rights seem to accrue dangerously 
fast here when once legislation is enacted, and it 
is long and slow work to undo the effects of a bad 
system once established. 
The principles and laws described in Mr. 
Prosser’s monograph have been developed only 
after prolonged study and experimentation. 
That so extensive a presentation is possible at 
the present time indicates the complex develop-

ment of the subject. It is certainly to be hoped 
that Mr. Prosser’s careful work will receive its 
due consideration from those engaged in the 
future in promoting legislation for teachers’ 
retirement systems.

THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
I 
PRESENT EXTENT OF TEACHERS’ PENSIONS 
AND ANNUITIES? 
TEACHERS’ annuities and retirement allowances, 
supported wholly or partly by the public, have 
been extensively developed in European countries 
‘during the last quarter of a century. All the 
states of the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, 
Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Bel- 
gium, France, together with Italy and Great 
Britain, pay annuities to teachers of elementary 
schools. All of these countries, with the addition 
of Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Russia, provide 
pensions of one kind or another for teachers of 
secondary education. 
The schemes of these nations differ widely as 
to the way in which the annuity is supported, its 
1 Throughout this discussion the word “annuity” is used to 
describe the retirement allowance purchased in part or entirely 
by the contributions of the beneficiary; “pension” to describe 
the allowance purchased entirely by those of the public; “re- 
tirement allowance” to include both “annuity” and “pen- 
sion.” 
I

amount, and the conditions as to age and length 
of service under which it is granted. In some 
countries the cost of these allowances is met en- 
tirely by the public, and in others in part by as- 
sessments upon the teachers, the former being 
the more frequent plan. The contribution of the 
public is met in some cases by the state, and in 
others by the joint support of the state and the 
local community, the latter being the usual prac- 
tice. The annuity paid upon retirement varies 
from ten to one hundred per cent of the last salary 
earned by the beneficiary, the average minimum 
allowance being usually about one third and the 
average maximum about two thirds of the teach- 
er’s wage at the time of retirement. The number 
of years of service which the teacher must give 
before he becomes eligible to an allowance be- 
cause of disability is usually ten, and the age at 
which he may be required to withdraw from the 
service and accept the annuity or pension is in 
most countries sixty-five years. 
Protection is usually afforded against old age 
and incapacity. In some countries, notably in 
Germany, a part of the claims of the beneficiary 
are transferred to the wife and children. Mem- 
bership in the scheme is confined to those who 
are in some way connected with the profession of 
2
-P-A-G-E-15
  
    TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
teaching. Distributions are made in the form of 
annuities, and never in the form of lump sums. 
The withdrawal equity, whereby the teacher se- 
cures the return of at least a part of his own con- 
tributions, is recognized in all the funds that are 
supported partly by dues. In general the allow- 
ance of the teacher is larger when the support is 
joint, and a marked tendency in the later schemes 
has been to require partial support of the annuity 
by the beneficiary, in keeping with the spirit and 
practice of compulsory insurance against old age 
and invalidism. 
Almost everywhere in Europe the state sys- 
tems of teachers’ retirement allowances are 
strengthened by schemes of certification stand- 
ardizing the qualifications which the employees 
of the public schools must have on entering the 
service. In this way many of the unfit are elim- 
inated, who otherwise might be attracted to the 
work by the pension or annuity. Realizing that 
the retirement allowance succeeds in its purpose 
only as it is able to attract and hold competent 
teachers in the schools, laws and administrative 
regulations have been passed which insure per- 
manent tenure to the capable instructor, and 
work toward securing the dismissal of the incom- 
petent.
-P-A-G-E-16
  HE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
e the results are necessarily difficult to 
‘'e, the prevailing belief in European na- 
3 that retirement allowances for teachers 
are a good business investment, because they 
have improved the teaching service in the schools 
more than would an equal expenditure in any 
other way, while at the same time thrift has been 
promoted, compulsory saving has been advanced, 
and the state has protected itself, to some extent 
at least, against the social burden of supporting 
some old teachers at the close of their period of 
usefulness in the classroom. 
Retirement allowances for teachers, like those 
for every other class, are, practically speak- 
ing, innovations in this country. The schemes 
through which they are supported and bestowed 
are not only of a variable type, but also experi- 
mental and imperfect. The areas in which these 
systems are in operation are almost negligible in 
comparison with the territory in which no teach- 
ers’ retirement schemes obtain; yet, from the 
standpoint of the population and the number of 
teachers affected, the growing prevalence of an- 
nuities and pensions to worthy teachers is start- 
ling to those who have never had the statistics 
placed before them. 
Twenty-three states have legislated, toagreater 
4
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
or less extent, upon the question of teachers’ re- 
tirement allowances, nine of which, having a 
population of almost twenty-three million people 
and employing upwards of seventy thousand 
teachers, have complete state retirement systems 
covering every public-school teacher within their 
boundaries. Nineteen of the largest cities in the 
country, having more than one ninth of our total 
population and employing one twelfth of our 
entire force of public-school teachers, support 
teachers’ retirement ventures of varying type, 
created and regulated by state enactment. More 
than thirty-five per cent of our population en- 
joy the educational benefits to be derived from 
such funds, while thirty per cent of the entire 
teaching force of the public schools of the United 
States have the opportunity to protect them- 
selves against one or more of the five great risks 
of life. 
As has been pointed out, state-wide teachers’ 
retirement systems have been set up by ten states, 
— Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New 
York, Virginia, Arizona, Vermont, Maine, Mass- 
achusetts, and California. All of these, save 
Maryland, Rhode Island, Arizona, and Maine, 
which have pension schemes supported entirely 
by the state, are ventures in compulsory insur-

  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
ance, the beneficiary being required to support the 
fund, in part at least, by dues. When this com- 
pulsory insurance for teachers was inaugurated, 
membership was made optional for those already 
in the service and obligatory for all those entering 
the service after a given date. No distinction is 
made between old teachers and new teachers as to 
either dues or annuity, save in New Jersey, where 
the new teachers are assessed two per cent of their 
salary, while the dues of old teachers range from 
two to three per cent on a sliding scale based on 
years of service. 
In all of these state systems, the benefits are 
limited to those employed as teachers, usually 
including supervisors and superintendents. Vir- 
ginia and Maine do not cover county or city 
superintendents. In Maryland, New Jersey, 
Rhode Island, New York, and Maine, teachers 
in state normal schools are included in the 
scheme. Nowhere are employees of the schools, 
other than those engaged in teaching or the super- 
vision of teaching, recognized. Everywhere the 
tendency in the legislation has been to provide a 
retirement allowance for all persons employed 
in the profession of teaching by schools sup- 
ported at public expense. 
Maryland, Rhode Island, Arizona, and Maine 
6
-P-A-G-E-19
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
give entire support to their schemes through ap- 
propriations from the state treasury made from 
time to time when necessary. New York assesses 
dues of one per cent on the salary of the teachers, 
meeting the remainder of the expense out of the 
state treasury supplemented by gifts, donations, 
and legacies. Virginia, with a similar plan, limits 
to five thousand dollars the annual appropriation 
to be made by the legislature, if any appropria- 
tion is necessary; and Vermont, to ten thousand 
dollars. New Jersey has a system of retirement 
allowances for teachers whereby the beneficiary 
practically supports a state annuity and the state 
pays a pension; the commonwealth paying the 
administrative expenses of the system, leaving 
the teachers to maintain the annuity fund by an 
assessment upon salaries ranging from two to 
three per cent, supplemented by gifts, donations, 
legacies, and the interest of such invested funds. 
Maryland gives a straight pension of two hun- 
dred dollars per year. All the others base the re- 
tirement allowance in some way on the teacher’s 
salary at or about the time of retirement. In 
New Jersey the state system calculates annuities 
on the basis of sixty per cent of the average an- 
nual salary for five years preceding retirement. 
This annuity must not be less than two hundred 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
and fifty dollars nor more than six hundred and 
fifty dollars. Local pension systems supported 
entirely by the communities of New Jersey pay a 
retired teacher a pension equal to fifty per cent 
of the average annual salary during the last five 
years of service. New York, Rhode Island, and 
Virginia provide annuities equal to fifty per cent 
of the average annual salary for five years pre- 
ceding retirement. 
New York sets a minimum of two hundred 
dollars, below which the annual allowance may 
not go, and no teacher can receive an annual 
amount of more than four hundred dollars. 
Rhode Island restricts the maximum allowance 
to five hundred dollars. Virginia pays four hun- 
dred dollars in the case of ordinary teachers and 
five hundred dollars for principals. Maine pays 
a flat pension of two hundred and fifty dollars 
for thirty-five years’ service, two hundred dollars 
for thirty years’ service, and one hundred and 
fifty dollars for twenty-five years’ service in the 
state. In Arizona the state board of education 
may pension any teacher who has served in the 
state twenty-five years. The amount is fixed at 
six hundred dollars. Massachusetts guarantees a 
minimum retirement allowance of three hundred 
dollars. All retirement allowances are annual 
8
-P-A-G-E-21
  TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
amounts instead of lump a and are distrib- 
uted quarterly. 
In general, it may be said that only Virginia 
attempts to cover the two great risks of old age 
and disability. Maryland and the state annuity 
scheme of New Jersey protect against disability 
only, by retiring the teacher who becomes dis- 
abled or incompetent: in Maryland, after serving 
twenty-five years in the schools of the state and 
reaching the age of sixty years; in New Jersey, 
at any time after the expiration of twenty years 
regardless of the age of the beneficiary. The 
local pension scheme of New Jersey safeguards 
the old age of the teacher by providing for his 
voluntary retirement after thirty-five years of 
service in the state; Rhode Island enables teach- 
ers to retire voluntarily after reaching the age of 
sixty if they have given thirty-five years of total 
service, of which twenty-five were devoted to the 
state; Virginia affords an opportunity for volun- 
tary retirement after twenty-five years of service 
with involuntary retirement after twenty years. 
No provision is made by any of the states for a 
partial participation by a teacher who becomes 
disabled for any reason while in the service at the 
close of five or ten or even fifteen years of em- 
ployment. Only those who remain in the service, 
9
-P-A-G-E-22
    THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
escaping accident and retaining good health for 
the full period required by the law, are permitted 
to benefit by the annuity or pension. In the pen- 
sion schemes of Maryland and Rhode Island the 
teacher who retires before completing the period 
of service and reaching the age required by law 
has, of course, no right to any withdrawal equity 
or return of any contributions, since he has made 
none; but there is no recognition of this equity in 
the annuity schemes supported practically wholly 
by the teachers in New Jersey or in part by dues 
in Virginia and New York. 
New Jersey and Arizona make no requirement 
concerning the personal character or record of 
the beneficiary. In Maryland, in Maine, in the 
state annuity scheme of New Jersey, and in Ver- 
mont, he must be incapacitated in order to re- 
ceive benefits; while in Virginia he must be dis- 
abled if retired after twenty years of service, or 
he may retire voluntarily after twenty-five years. 
In the other states the conditions of retire- 
ment are length of service and age. Maryland 
requires the beneficiary to be sixty years of 
age and to have completed twenty-five years of 
service within the state; Rhode Island, sixty 
years of age and thirty-five years of service, 
twenty-five of these being in the state; the New 
10
-P-A-G-E-23
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND. ANNUITIES 
Jersey state annuity system, no age, but at least 
twenty years of service in the commonwealth 
before becoming incapacitated; the New Jersey 
local pension system, no age, but thirty-five 
years of service within the state, twenty of which 
must have been spent in the work of the district 
supporting the allowance. The annuity begins 
in New York upon disability after fifteen years 
of service; the teacher may retire voluntarily 
without disability at the close of twenty-five 
years of service and benefit by the fund. Massa- 
chusetts requires at least fifteen years of service 
prior to July 1, 1914, and thirty years’ service 
from teachers entering the service after that date. 
Teachers must be sixty years of age, or over, at 
time of retirement. 
The state pension systems of Maryland, Rhode 
Island, Arizona, and Maine, carried on entirely 
at public expense, are controlled entirely by the 
public through the state board of education for 
each commonwealth. Virginia alone fails to give 
the teachers who contribute to a state annuity 
scheme any voice in its control and administra- 
tion, the management there being likewise in- 
vested in the state board of education. In the 
New Jersey state annuity system the joint repre- 
sentation of the teachers and the public is secured 
Il  
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
through a board of trustees of the retirement 
fund, composed of nine members, five of whom are 
elected by the teaching membership of the fund in 
annual convention, and four of whom represent 
the public, appointed by the governor. The state 
annuity fund of New York is administered by a 
retirement fund board consisting of five members, 
appointed by the commissioner of education, 
three of whom must be members of the teaching 
profession and one of whom must be a woman. 
Some states have passed what might be called 
permissive laws, allowing cities and towns to 
set up local pension schemes for the benefit of 
their own schools and teachers. In 1908 Massa- 
chusetts authorized all cities and towns other 
than Boston, if the voters approve at popular 
election, to pay pensions from public funds, and 
Boston has a retirement allowance system regu- 
lated by state law. Pennsylvania authorizes 
cities in the second and third classes to establish 
retirement funds, and apparently to appropriate 
public money therefor; and Minnesota provides 
that, in cities of over fifty thousand inhabitants, 
funds for retirement may be raised in part by 
taxation. 
In Ohio the board of education of any district 
may establish a pension fund; participation is 
12
-P-A-G-E-25
  
  TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
optional with teachers, and the funds are to be 
derived in part from salary deductions and in 
part from the appropriation of from one to two 
per cent of the gross receipts of the said board 
from taxation. California and Utah have retire- 
ment laws which are similar, inasmuch as they 
are local and voluntary in their application, and 
are based largely upon assessments, the only pro- 
vision for contribution from public funds relat- 
ing to certain amounts forfeited by teachers for 
absence, etc. In Colorado, districts containing a 
school population of over one thousand may es- 
tablish public-school teachers’ retirement funds, 
and may levy therefore taxes not exceeding one 
tenth of a mill. 
In addition to these there are local pension 
funds in twenty of the leading cities. Some of 
these, authorized by law, are supported entirely 
by the public, some jointly by the state and the 
teaching force, but most of them principally, if 
not entirely, by the assessments of teachers for 
their own mutual aid associations. 
These annuity schemes present the same wide 
differences as to methods of support, the amount 
of premium and annuity, and the conditions of 
retirement and participation which characterize 
the state pension systems already described. The 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
assessments paid by the teachers range from one 
to three per cent; the annuity in most cases is 
small, being usually from two hundred to three 
hundred dollars; the number of years the teacher 
must spend in the work is usually large, thirty 
to thirty-five years; and the age at which retire- 
ment upon the pension may take place, high, 
sixty-five to seventy years. Teachers leaving the 
service before retirement are usually not given 
a return of any part of the amount which they 
have contributed as dues. 
General character of present schemes for the 
insurance of teachers in America 
We have not had teachers’ retirement allow- 
ances in this country long enough to be able to 
estimate, in any conclusive way, at least, their 
results upon the work of the schools and the pro- 
fession. The progress which the movement has 
made would seem to indicate that the American 
people are being rapidly committed to the idea. 
While this is true, it must at the same time be 
acknowledged that not only are the present 
schemes of teachers’ insurance experimental and 
imperfect, but they have frequently been the 
outcome of hasty and ill-considered action. It 
is doubtful whether many of them will result 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
    
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
in the best good of education and of the teachers 
themselves. 
Most of these retirement systems have been 
entered into without any accurate knowledge as 
to what the insurance would cost and whether 
the support provided would float the venture 
properly so as to safeguard contributions and 
insure the expectancies of members and the 
claims of beneficiaries. In only a very few in- 
stances has the expert advice of the actuary been 
secured as to whether a plan was sound and sol- 
vent before its adoption. Some of the schemes 
established within the last five years have al- 
ready been declared by actuaries of repute to be 
insolvent, and therefore unable to meet the claims 
upon them certain to come. The result will be in 
such cases that, unless additional legislation is 
enacted, many teachers will fail to receive the 
protection which they expect, and in the contrib- 
utory ventures will lose the benefit of the dues 
or savings they have been required to invest. 
In all the American schemes, both old and 
new teachers have been provided for in the same 
law and fund, a practice which has resulted in 
retirement systems not properly adapted to the 
conditions of either, and therefore not produc- 
tive of the best good to the schools in which they 
15  
-P-A-G-E-28
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
serve. The dominant purpose has usually been 
to make arrangements for the immediate retire- 
ment, upon some kind of an allowance, of those 
who, through age or incapacity, were no longer 
able to discharge properly the duties of the class- 
room, thus affording, through a gratuity more 
or less meager, a means whereby school authori- 
ties could without embarrassment and criticism 
retire old and faithful employees on superannua- 
tion allowances. 
Where the retirement fund is supported in part 
by the contributions of the teacher, it has been 
customary so to arrange the plan that teachers 
already in the service receive full annuities, but 
pay dues, usually at the same rate as new teach- 
ers, only for the time they remain in the service 
after the adoption of the scheme; while at the 
same time young teachers withdrawing from the 
service to take up other work are made to pay 
for the protection of those remaining in it, by 
forfeiting all the assessments they have contrib- 
uted. 
Where the contributory principle has been 
recognized, assessments have usually been made 
upon the teacher for the avowed purpose of help- 
ing to pay the expense of the venture and not as 
a vital feature of a plan of social insurance. The 
16

  TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 
idea of compulsory saving is seldom mentioned, 
and even less frequently followed out consist- 
ently. There is no logical relation in most in- 
stances between what the teacher pays and what 
he receives. 
Nowhere is there, as in the Massachusetts 
retirement system for state employees (1910) 
and in the Massachusetts retirement system for 
teachers (1913), a return to the teacher of an 
annuity purchased by his own accumulated sav- 
ings which the state has withheld as dues and 
an additional pension given by the state as a 
reward for thrift, exactly equal in amount to the 
annuity. On the contrary, payments by the 
teacher are practically everywhere regarded not 
as deferred payments of salary invested for his 
benefit by the public as employer, but as pre- 
miums in an insurance benefit to be received by 
him in case he remains faithful to the service for 
a required time, to be forfeited entirely by death 
or by withdrawal for any cause. 
Taking all the American attempts to deal with 
the question of teachers’ allowances, it may be 
said, however, that their evolution, their ten- 
dency, as is shown more especially in the later 
schemes, is toward joint support by public and 
teacher; state rather than local maintenance and 
17

support; compulsory saving on the part of the 
beneficiary; the recognition, to some extent at 
least, of the right of the member to a return of 
his own contributions; dues graduated, within 
certain limits at least, according to salary; an- 
nuities, up to a reasonable point at least, given 
in proportion to dues; public support in encour- 
agement of individual saving; and in the con- 
tributory schemes joint control and management 
by the public and the members. Nowhere else 
has there been any American system for the re- 
tirement of public-school teachers based squarely 
on accepted principles of compulsory social in- 
surance such as have been carried out in the 
Massachusetts retirement system for state em- 
ployees and in the Massachusetts retirement 
system for teachers (1913).

TEACHERS’ ANNUITIES AS PART OF A 
PROGRAM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE 
Tur cause of teachers’ pensions has of late 
years gained additional support from the grow- 
ing recognition that, after all, they are only one 
phase of the world-wide movement toward the 
social insurance of all workers against the great 
risks of life. Here again the Old World has 
blazed the way. Practically every European na- 
tion has passed some legislation safeguarding a 
part of its workers at least against one or more of 
the risks of sickness, accident, disability, old age, 
and death. In every one of these countries, with 
the single exception of Holland, which as yet has 
only adopted the idea of compulsory insurance 
of industrial workers against sickness, teachers’ 
annuities of one kind or another have in most 
instances preceded, asa forerunner or entering 
wedge, a wider social program of legislation for 
the protection of other and larger groups of 
workers; while in other instances insurance for 
the teacher has paralleled similar legislation for 
other classes of citizens. 
19
-P-A-G-E-32
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
Almost everywhere in Europe voluntary insur- 
ance, designed primarily for the benefit of wage- 
earners, but open to every one, is made safe and 
cheap by public management and subvention, 
being sustained by the premiums of the insured 
and grants from the state. Its counterpart would 
occur here, should a state offer to receive and in- 
vest contributions from its citizens, supplement 
these with small appropriations from the legisla- 
ture, and guarantee a certain annuity when in- 
firmity, old age, or death overtook the insured. 
In the early schemes for the protection of 
teachers in many European nations, as has al- 
ready been pointed out, straight pensions were 
given as a gratuity or bonus by the state without 
the payment of any dues or assessments, whereas 
all the later ventures provide for the joint sup- 
port by the public and the schoolmaster. This is 
the pronounced drift on the other side in all re- 
cent laws relating to old-age or disability insur- 
ance. Even Germany, after having granted pen- 
sions to teachers entirely at public expense, has 
in recent years based her entire program of social 
insurance upon the idea of the compulsory as- 
sessment of all who were to be protected by the 
numerous successive and progressive laws which 
have been adopted. 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
  
ANNUITIES AND SOCIAL INSURANCE 
_ Five out of the eleven leading European coun- 
tries have set up compulsory and, of course, con- 
tributory insurance schemes for large numbers 
of wage-earners, and three others are soon to 
adopt the same idea; whereas, on the other hand, 
only three countries have adopted old-age pen- 
sions supported entirely by public funds, and 
these have not only limited the benefits to a 
mere pittance, but restricted their enjoyment to 
the needy, the crippled, and the diseased. We 
shall probably witness a spread of old-age pen- 
sions, as a new and wise form of protection for 
the indigent, to other lands on both sides of the 
Atlantic, but probably not for self-supporting 
classes of our citizenship, whether employed in 
private or public service. In all European coun- 
tries the pension or annuity scheme of the teacher 
is carried on as an enterprise by the state as em- 
ployer, separate and apart from the compulsory 
insurance systems for the protection of other 
classes of workers. 
The membership of the insurance schemes 
against old age and invalidism varies in differ- 
ent countries. Austria protects office employees 
and minors; France, seamen, minors, all working- 
men and salaried employees; Germany, all wage- 
earners and employees with yearly wages up to 
ar
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
five hundred dollars, and small employees and 
houseworkers; Norway is now considering a 
plan covering all working men and women, irre- 
spective of income. This is the pronounced drift 
in all European legislation on the subject. 
The spirit and the tendency of European so- 
cial insurance are best shown in the complete 
system for the protection of workers which Ger- 
many has worked out, by assessing employers for 
the entire support of the annuities for accident 
and for the partial support of those for old age 
and disability. The principles are asserted, both 
that the cost of these risks is a legitimate over- 
head charge against the business, the same as 
insurance against fire and repairs for wear and 
tear upon plant and machinery, and that a busi- 
ness profits indirectly by the moral effect of these 
safeguards upon the wage-earner. 
By assessing wage-earners for the support of 
the fund protecting them against old age and 
incapacity, the principle is asserted that work- 
ingmen, for the sake of their own welfare, 
should be required to protect themselves against 
the uncertainties of life and provide for their 
failing years. By making it possible to retire 
the aged worker when he has outlived his effi- 
ciency, the principle has been asserted that the 
. 22

state must in some equitable way make ] 
sion for his retirement when, after he has p 
the limit of efficiency, his retention in indi 
means an economic waste to society and a handi- 
cap to the industry in which he is employed. 
By requiring all classes of wage-workers to pay 
something to the support of their own protec- 
tion, the principle is asserted that the state, in 
order to promote the thrift of its people and 
preserve itself from the burden of the indigent, 
must encourage thrift, stimulate and safeguard 
savings, and secure continuous faithful service 
to industry and to the nation. 
No American state thus far has established 
any general system of old-age pensions or annu- 
ities. i eration in several states 
: “special _pension_schemes_ for ‘certain ‘tain classes of of 
public employees,._chiefly -_policer nen, firemen, 
and. school-teachers. There is no soheme; now in 
xistence or in prospect, making general provi- 
sion for old-age pensions or insurance. Indeed, 
Massachusetts is the first state to authorize a 
comprehensive investigation into the pension 
and insurance question through a state commis- 
sion, which reported to the legislature on the rst 
of January three years ago. In the United States 
the question of retirement allowances has hardly 
23 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
as yet received any serious attention from legis- 
lation, while in Europe it has been the subject of 
repeated investigation and extensive legislation. 
At the same time there has been a steady de- 
velopment of industrial insurance. The frater- 
nal organizations and the trade unions have con- 
tributed also some share toward the solution of 
this problem. The pension systems for certain 
branches of public service, to which reference has 
already been made, have assisted further toward 
this end. 
The essential difference between the United 
States and countries in which compulsory insur- 
ance has obtained a foothold has been the ab- 
sence in this country of recognition of any need 
for this form of protection for its inhabitants, and 
particularly for those nearest to the border-line 
between economic independence and economic 
dependence. In certain instances, however, we 
have adopted the compulsory principle in our 
own legislation. Laws are daily being enacted, 
miscalled socialistic or paternal, which on closer 
analysis are found to be no more than an expres- 
sion of intention on the part of the state to safe- 
guard the welfare of all citizens, irrespective of 
their economic status. 
‘Fundamentally, no more than this has been 
24
-P-A-G-E-37
  ANNUITIES AND SOCIAL INSURANCE 
done in Germany and other European countries 
which have introduced compulsory insurance. 
These have recognized that there are risks in life 
common to all workingmen, against which it is 
impossible for the individual alone to make pro- 
vision. Only by the transfer of this risk from the 
shoulders of the one to the backs of the many 
and by placing the burden of cost where it should 
rest, even though this involve the industry itself, 
can equilibrium be maintained. Where we, after 
an observation of a century, and England, of 
several centuries, have grudgingly admitted the 
desirability of protection through insurance and 
through legislation and have permitted individ- 
uals to avail themselves of the benefits of it, 
Europe, as typified by Germany and her sister 
states, has boldly declared the urgent need of 
this protection, not for the few but for all of its 
working population, and by legislation has re- 
quired its workingmen to partake of it and its 
employers to bear their just share of the cost. 
What Massachusetts has done with social 
insurance 
Massachusetts has been one of the first of the 
states to deal with the protection of workers 
against the risks of life in various ways. The

  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
Report of the Massachusetts Commission on Old- 
Age Pensions, in 1910, pointed out that previous 
laws had already opened the way for pensions 
for various public employees. By referendum 
vote, any city or town may pension firemen for 
permanent disability incurred in the service; any 
fireman who has served twenty years and who is 
sixty-five years of age or who is incapacitated for 
service may be pensioned; policemen disabled in 
the discharge of their duty may be retired on 
half-pay, and twenty years of service with dis- 
ablement for any cause entitles them to pension, 
tegardless of age. 
Widows and children of firemen and police- 
men killed in the service receive pensions to the 
amount of not more than three hundred dollars 
per year. Any judge, who has reached the age 
of sixty years, has served fifteen years, and is 
incapacitated for further service, may retire on 
one-half salary; veterans of the Civil War, no 
longer able after ten years in the public service 
to discharge their duties, may be retired on half- 
pay; any prison officer may be retired on one 
half the last rate of compensation paid him when 
he is sixty-five years of age and has served twenty 
years, or when he is disabled in the service, or 
has rendered thirty years of faithful service. 
26
-P-A-G-E-39
  ANNUITIES AND SOCIAL INSURANCE 
In 1908, by chapter 498 of Acts and Resolves, 
cities and towns were authorized to establish pen- 
sion funds for teachers in the public schools. Any 
city or town accepting its provisions shall estab- 
lish a fund for retiring teachers, made up of such 
revenues as may be diverted to that purpose. 
The school committee may retire any teacher of 
sixty years of age, incapacitated for service, on a 
pension not to exceed one half of his last com- 
pensation, and in any case not exceeding five hun- 
dred dollars. In the same year a pension system 
for teachers in the public day schools of Boston 
was established by chapter 589, under which the 
school committee of Boston was required to es- 
tablish immediately a permanent school pension 
fund. 
An appropriation of five cents for each one 
thousand dollars of the valuation of the city is 
authorized to meet the expenses of the scheme. 
- Any teacher who is incapacitated for efficient 
service may be retired at any time; those who 
have reached the age of sixty-five years or who 
have been in the service for thirty years, twenty 
of which have been in the public day schools 
of Boston, receive a pension of one hundred 
and eighty dollars, the amount of the pension 
for those of lower age and shorter service being 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
proportionately less. In 1913 the General Court 
enacted a state compulsory insurance act for 
teachers, which is later discussed in detail. 
By the Savings Insurance Act of 1907, Massa- 
chusetts is definitely committed to an experiment 
with voluntary insurance under public adminis- 
tration. 
Upon the recommendation of the Commission 
on Old-Age Pensions, made in 1910, the legisla- 
ture passed an act providing compulsory instruc- 
tion in thrift in the public schools of the com- 
monwealth; authorized employers and employees 
to carry on codperative retirement annuity or 
pension systems; permitted cities and towns to 
set up retirement schemes for their own em- 
ployees; and established a retirement plan for 
the employees of the commonwealth; and in addi- 
tion to this, passed a Workingmen’s Compensa- 
tion Act to take the place of the old Employers’ 
Liability Law. 
The retirement system now in operation for 
state employees contemplates practically that 
the beneficiary shall make certain contribu- 
tions, which invested at compound interest shall 
after a certain period make available an an- 
nuity, and that the state shall come in to sup- 
plement this with a pension of equal amount. 
28
-P-A-G-E-41
  ANNUITIES AND SOCIAL INSURANCE 
Under these circumstances, therefore, the retire- 
ment allowance practically amounts to the pro- 
ceeds of a system of compulsory insurance 
against old age or incapacity to which the state 
contributes as much as the beneficiary, and the 
retirement allowances themselves are graduated 
largely according to the salaries paid beneficia- 
ries, and therefore according to the contributions 
which each makes to the support of his own an- 
nuity. 
It is significant that Massachusetts, which has 
placed practically all its employees under civil 
service provisions with a permanent tenure of 
position, is the only state which has yet estab- 
lished an annuity plan for them.

  Ill 
THE QUESTION OF TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT 
ALLOWANCES IN THE LIGHT OF SOCIAL 
INSURANCE PRINCIPLES 
In view of the trend of legislation and the 
growth of public sentiment in this country for 
social insurance, it seems clear that retirement 
allowances here should not be dealt with merely 
as an effort to provide protection against the 
risks of life for the members of a worthy profes- 
sion or for a group of employees in the public serv- 
ice, but as one phase of a widening program of 
insurance for all workers. No state is now ready 
for such a program in its larger aspects, but it is 
evident that retirement allowances are here and 
now demanded for the teaching service by an 
increasing number of the friends of the public 
schools. We are now facing the question: Shall 
a state-wide system of annuities for teachers be 
established ? 
In considering the idea of teachers’ retirement 
allowances, three different interests or points of 
view need to be kept in mind. There is, first, the 
attitude of the teacher interested in the question 
30
-P-A-G-E-43
  
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
whether pensions or annuities of this, that, or 
the other kind will be for the good of the profes- 
sion to which he belongs. The public, as an em- 
ployer anxious for the welfare of its schools, is 
asked to support a retirement system on the plea 
that it will better the work of the schools. The 
state should look upon the idea of pensions or 
annuities for educators as one form of social 
insurance which, whatever else it does, must 
encourage saving, promote thrift, and insure 
adequate protection against old age and disa- 
bility. 
If the teachers of any state advocate any sys- 
tem whereby the state or the community is ex- 
pected to make contributions to a retirement 
system, they will do so primarily with the ulti- 
mate good of the profession in view. The ulti- 
mate good of the teaching profession is governed 
almost wholly by considerations of the efficiency 
of that profession in performing its services to 
society; consequently nearly all of the problems 
affecting teachers’ retirement allowances come 
back ultimately to the fundamental one: How 
and in what ways will a particular proposal react 
upon the efficiency of the profession as a whole? 
For this reason it is advisable that the prob- 
lem of providing retirement allowances for new 
31
-P-A-G-E-44
  
THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
teachers hereafter entering the profession and for 
those already in the service should be considered 
separately and be met by different measures. In 
this way it is possible to lay aside temporarily 
special considerations that arise with reference 
to teachers who have already given many years 
of service to the schools. 
- The state could easily insist on a retirement 
system for teachers hereafter entering the serv- 
ice, but it would be inexpedient to make such 
provision compulsory with regard to teachers 
now in the service. A contributory feature in a 
retirement system would not work a hardship 
to teachers hereafter beginning work, since they 
would face such an assessment at the time of 
employment; but it might in some cases operate 
as a hardship to teachers who have already for 
many years been employed in public schools. 
Sound policy would require that teachers here- 
after entering the service and expecting to share 
in the benefits of a retirement system should not 
only be certificated by the state, but the gen- 
eral character of their work from time to time 
should be passed upon by state authorities. It 
is much easier to deal with legislation affecting 
tenure in the case of new teachers than in that of 
old. All of these problems are exceedingly com- 
32
-P-A-G-E-45
    
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
plex as applied to teachers now in the service, but 
relatively simple if considered in connection with 
those who may hereafter elect to enter the pro- 
fession of teaching. 
Principles upon which a retirement allowance 
should be based 
Whatever may be the claims advanced by 
those who favor retirement allowances for them, 
teachers as a class have come to realize that the 
only argument which will avail with the public 
and secure legislation in their behalf, is that the 
protection given the teacher through annuities 
will better the work of the public schools. It 
goes without saying that an overwhelming ma- 
jority of the teachers of the country view the 
question from a professional standpoint and de- 
sire only such legislation as will be for the good 
of the profession and the improvement of the 
service. In what specific ways may we expect the 
operation of a retirement system to improve the 
efficiency of teachers? By attracting and hold- 
ing more desirable men and women in the profes- 
sion; by guaranteeing in a way the future of those 
engaged in it, thus creating an attitude of mind 
favorable to good work; by the timely with- 
drawal of those who have given full service and 
33
-P-A-G-E-46
    THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
are no longer able to meet the demands of the 
schoolroom. 
The European experience shows that teach- 
ers’ retirement allowances have accomplished 
these results far better than if many times their 
cost to the public had been applied to an increase 
in wage. Teachers’ retirement allowances are in 
a sense deferred payments for services, which 
justify themselves as a wise business investment 
on the part of the state. In addition, it seems 
probable that annuities holding the beneficiary 
longer in the service would insure a more per- 
manent staff of teachers and tend to increase 
the length of the tenure of employment, a move 
in the direction of a wider civil service in the 
profession. 
There is danger in some quarters to-day that a 
few of the over-zealous friends of teachers’ an- 
nuities may, forgetting their real justification, 
support arguments as to retirement allowances 
which, if not false and misleading, do not go to 
the real merits of the question. 
It is sometimes urged that teaching is an un- 
derpaid profession. This statement, however, 
must be examined always in the light of stand- 
ards under prevalent conditions. The teachers 
in the city are paid much better salaries than 
34
-P-A-G-E-47
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
those in the country, but living conditions in the 
city are more costly than those in the country. 
Teachers in the Western States are as a rule paid 
better than those in Eastern States, but in the 
West there is a relative scarcity of people seeking 
to enter this calling, whereas in the East there 
seems to be usually a considerable surplus of 
available candidates for positions. 
Those employing teachers assert that there is 
a constant scarcity of those who have had ade- 
quate training or approved experience, and those 
towns paying the highest salaries claim that they 
find it most difficult to procure people reach- 
ing the standard of excellence which they desire. 
Obviously, then, if teaching is underpaid, it is so 
relatively, not as contrasted with the supply of 
candidates available at any given time, but as 
determined by the standards of employment 
which prevail. The so-called “disappearance” 
of men from the teaching profession is not due 
to the fact that the same men find better em- 
ployment elsewhere, but rather it is due to the 
fact that the rise of the standards of profes- 
sional quality demanded render it less and less 
possible for communities to obtain the type of 
man desired. 
The increased cost of living in recent years is 
3D
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
sometimes urged as an argument in aid of teach- 
ers’ retirement allowances. This argument again 
fails to recognize that the increased cost of living 
affects practically all classes of workers, and per- 
haps in equal degree, although it seems probable 
that salaries do not keep pace with the upward 
trend of prices as adequately as do the wages 
of the skilled workman. Teachers’ salaries have 
advanced in recent years, but whether they have 
advanced proportionately to the compensation 
given in other callings is a fact that is not yet 
proved. It may be assumed that conditions of 
competition operate in teaching as well as in 
other fields, and certainly the increased cost of 
living, as contrasted with the compensations of 
teaching, do not seem to operate in such a way as 
to bar the entrance of people to the calling of 
teaching. 
It is often argued that, because the state has 
encouraged certain specific types of compensa- 
tion for retirement in the case of particular 
groups of employees, thereby a precedent has 
been established for a similar system for teachers. 
This claim ignores the fact that the state may 
have been mistaken in setting up a particular 
system of compensation for retirement. All, in- 
cluding teachers, are under a certain obligation 
36
-P-A-G-E-49
Se en ee 
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
to see to it that any action taken in the future is 
along lines that are fundamentally right. 
It is also frequently urged that teaching is a 
calling imposing greater hardship and liability 
of earlier breakdown than other callings. This 
may be true for certain classes of workers, but 
anything like scientific evidence in its favor is 
still lacking. Such callings as those of the nurse, 
physician, and the various trades sometimes lead 
to as early incapacity as teaching. 
- From the standpoint of general policy those 
who seek to promote teachers’ pensions will do 
well to treat the entire question of teachers’ re- 
tirement allowances as a venture in the field of x 
compulsory social insurance, whose underlying 
principles are, as has already been intimated, 
that all persons should be required by law to in- 
sure themselves against the various contingen- 
cies of life, and that the employing authority 
should, in all cases where the annuity operates for 
the benefit of his business, be required to con- 
tribute in part to the cost of maintaining it. 
It is true that the time is not ripe to discuss 
teachers’ retirement allowances in terms of a 
comprehensive scheme of compulsory insurance; 
if it were, then protection against the risks of 
sickness, accident, disability, and death, as well as 
oF  
-P-A-G-E-50
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
against old age and incapacity, must be afforded; 
provision for the early retirement of teachers for 
disability must be made; teachers must be re- 
quired to take out insurance for the protection 
of those dependent upon them in case of death. 
Jnasmuch as the retirement allowances for teach- 
ers on account of incapacity due to old age or 
disability are being rapidly adopted in this coun- 
try, we can deal with them in terms of compulsory 
insurance and apply to them the principles and 
standards of such insurance which have gained 
common acceptance only by regarding the whole 
matter of teachers’ retirement allowances as 
an experiment in compulsory insurance. Will it 
be possible to approach the question from the 
triple, yet common, standpoint of the welfare of 
the worker, the efficiency of the teaching pro- 
fession, and the protection of society against 
poverty and dependency ? 
The teacher should contribute to the support of 
his own retirement allowance 
A part of the expense of the retirement allowance 
should be borne by the beneficiary. The Massachu- 
setts Commission on Old-Age Pensions (1910) de- 
clared this principle to be fundamental and vital. 
The State of Massachusetts has applied it in the 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
present retirement system for its employees. 
The same commission reported strongly against 
the noncontributory pension for public employ- 
ees because of the heavy expense of such a pol- 
icy, holding this objection to be an especially 
weighty one “in view of the large increase of 
public expenditures and public indebtedness in 
Massachusetts during recent years,” and because 
such an expense would be needless, since “public 
employees can well afford to pay at least some 
part of the cost of a retirement system”; and 
holding further that any noncontributory pen- 
sion must exert a depressing effect on wages, a 
demoralizing reaction on character, and a disin- 
tegrating influence on the family. 
The commission declared that “a policy which 
threatened social consequences of so sweepingly 
harmful a character is not one that the state, the 
county, the city, or the town as an employer can 
afford to sanction,” and that “the dubious pol- 
icy of noncontributory pensions should not be 
encouraged by the example of the municipality 
or of the state.” After pointing out that the 
straight pensions supported by the public in the 
state have usually been given to those employed 
in occupations involving an unusual degree of 
danger, devotion, and sacrifice, the report de- 
3D  
-P-A-G-E-52
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
clares that, “whatever may be done in the 
future toward the extension of pensions, provi- 
sions for all classes of public employees should be 
on the contributory basis.” 
Experience shows that the noncontributory 
pension for teachers is usually not large enough 
to afford an adequate protection against old age 
and incapacity. The tendency in those state sys- 
tems which have given pensions, like those of 
Maryland and Rhode Island, is to reduce the 
heavy expense of public maintenance by grant- 
ing an allowance too small to afford even a mini- 
mum of comfort to the beneficiary. On the other 
hand, in those states like New Jersey and New 
York, where the teachers pay dues toward the 
support of their own protection, the annuity is 
sufficient to insure them against want and de- 
pendency. 
The contributory principle is best for the wel- 
fare of the teacher, because it guarantees inde- 
pendence in old age and makes it possible for 
him to protect adequately those dependent upon 
him. It should be applied by the state as the em- 
ployer seeking to better the service, since retire- 
ment allowances will accomplish good results in 
the improvement of the service in proportion as 
they afford an adequate protection against the 
40
-P-A-G-E-53
    
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
failing years of life. When the state takes hold 
of the retirement system, it should require the 
worker to pay toward the support of his annuity, 
not only to encourage thrift and promote saving, 
but also to make it certain that in his last days 
he may not become a burden on society. 
That part of the annuity which comes from 
the dues paid by the teacher adds, of course, noth- 
ing to his total wage directly. The withdrawal 
equity should always be recognized whereby the 
teacher, upon withdrawal before legal retirement, 
has returned to him his own contributions, to- 
gether with reasonable interest. Then state 
compulsion and management of his contributions 
toward his own annuity does benefit him during 
his working period, by forcing him to make pro- 
vision for the future, by developing a spirit and 
habit of thrift, by securing for him high-class in- 
surance at the lowest possible cost, by guaran- 
teeing the solvency of the insurance scheme, and 
by developing a security of tenure of position 
that grows measurably with the increase of his 
equity in the insurance attached to the business. 
The operation of compulsory insurance under 
these conditions is such as to preserve in the high- 
est measure the self-respect of the worker, and 
to better, rather than impair, the prestige and 
41

  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
standing in public opinion of the profession or 
calling he follows. 
Aside from moral and social considerations, it 
makes little if any difference in the long run 
whether the public or the teacher pays the cost 
of the retirement allowance, or in what proportion 
each contributes. This is particularly true in the 
case of those hereafter entering the profession. 
In setting the wage and bargaining with a new 
employee, the school authorities will, either 
directly or unconsciously, take into considera- 
tion the cost of the public contribution to the 
retirement allowance as a real though somewhat 
vaguely defined part of his total wage. In this 
way the concession of public support would be- 
come a factor in each new wage adjustment as 
certainly and as potently as any other portion of 
his wage compensation. 
On the other hand, the new teacher facing 
employment soon comes to look upon his total 
actual salary as made up of a current salary 
received from month to month, a deferred sal- 
ary composed of amounts withheld from his own 
earnings and invested as savings for him, and 
deferred payments for service in the form of 
public contributions toward a retirement allow- 
ance, to be received at some time in the future, 
42
-P-A-G-E-55
  
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
for continuous, faithful service. The immediate 
placing in operation of a retirement system 
operates to diminish the salary of the bene- 
ficiary, but in the long run this is not the case. 
After a system of this sort has been in operation 
for some time, the deduction from the employee’s 
salary would so operate as to be largely a nominal 
affair. 
Withdrawal equity and annuity 
The withdrawal equity of the teacher in his own 
payments toward his annuity should be recog- 
nized. When he retires from the profession for 
any reason, dues withheld from his wage should 
be regarded as deferred payments invested by 
the state for his benefit. He is as justly entitled 
to the present worth of such a saving as if it had 
been deposited by him and invested by a say- 
ings bank; otherwise the state cannot defend a 
program of compulsory insurance as a means of 
promoting thrift, encouraging saving, and safe- 
guarding old age. Young teachers who may not 
and usually do not remain in the profession ought 
not to be mulcted or penalized, even to the ex- 
tent of the smallest part of their savings, for the 
benefit of those who do. The recognition of this 
equity will operate to preserve that mobility of the 
43
-P-A-G-E-56
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
teaching profession that has proved so desirable 
on the whole to the American schools, since 
teachers shifting from one position or state to 
another would not be deterred by the prospect of 
the complete loss of their payments. 
Annuities only should be used in making pay- 
ments for any cause to the beneficiaries of the 
retirement system. Asa venture in social insur- 
ance the scheme must have due regard for the 
protection of the beneficiary against old age and 
dependency. Payments of the total amount, in 
the form of a lump sum representing the present 
worth of the claims of the beneficiary, are highly 
objectionable, because there is danger, and in 
many cases every probability, that the money 
will be lost either through unwise investments or 
unwise expenditures of one kind or another. How- 
ever able some may be to take care of their own 
money, the state must protect against losing their 
savings those who are less capable of making in- 
vestments. The principle of annual distributions, 
paid, say, in monthly or quarterly installments, 
should be applied both to the accumulated sav- 
ings of the teacher and to the pension added 
by the public. When a teacher has served long 
enough to become a risk on the funds, payments 
after withdrawal for any cause should be in terms 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
of annual amounts certain to continue at least 
until the death of the beneficiary. 
The Retirement System for Massachusetts State 
Employees is sound in principle 
Most of the general features of the state re- 
tirement system of Massachusetts for its own 
employees represent the best ideas in compul- 
sory social insurance of to-day, and might well 
serve as a model in principle in any proposed 
plan of annuities for teachers. The present state 
scheme is comprehensive, being open to all those 
in the service of the commonwealth, and is obli- 
gatory upon those hereafter entering its work. 
The civil service laws, as has already been pointed 
out, set up what amounts to a plan of certifica- 
tion which prevents the employment of the in- 
competent and insures what is practically per- 
manent tenure of position during good behavior. 
Upon withdrawal from the fund for any reason, 
all the accumulated savings with interest com- 
pounded at three per cent are returned to the 
beneficiary or to his legal representative, either 
in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity, the 
state in no case withholding or seeking to profit 
by the contributions of the membership. 
The contributory principle is carried out by 
45  
-P-A-G-E-58
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
making the members, through dues, save for the 
support of their own annuities and by guarantee- 
ing that the state will give up a full withdrawal 
equity, for disability, or at the close of the full pe- 
riod of service, a pension equal in amount to the 
annuity. Savings are required in proportion to 
income, the dues or assessments being graduated 
on the basis of the salary earned. Thrift and 
capacity to save are rewarded, and differences in 
previously acquired standards of living are rec- 
ognized by making the retirement allowance de- 
pendent upon the contributions and therefore 
really graduated by the customary earnings of 
the beneficiary. 
Asa venture in social insurance, an attempt 
is made to insure a decent competence for old 
age by making two hundred dollars the smallest 
allowance given at retirement, the minimum 
contribution from the salaries of members being 
set at a sum sufficient to yield during the work- 
ing period of the beneficiary an annuity which, 
together with an equal pension by the state, 
will amount to that sum. Since the retirement 
system is not interested in rewarding savings 
beyond the reasonable limits necessary in order 
to promote thrift, to make membership attrac- 
tive, and to safeguard the closing years of life 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
  
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
against penury and dependency, the annuity of 
the beneficiary, whatever his salary may be, can 
never be larger than that earned by the accumu- 
lated savings of more than seventy-eight dollars 
per year, which is the maximum dues required or 
permitted. 
The risks to be covered in a plan of retirement 
allowances for teachers probably should not be 
more than those undertaken in the system for 
the employees of the state in Massachusetts, 
which are, generally speaking, old age, incapacity 
resulting from old age, and disability due to any 
cause after ten years of service. There is, in addi- 
tion to these, an insurance, in a sense, against the 
death of the member, which is provided in two 
ways. When his demise takes place while still in 
the service, the accumulated savings due him are 
paid in a lump sum to his estate. At full retire- 
ment, the beneficiary can elect either to receive 
an allowance for the number of years during 
which he lives, or an annual amount for a fixed 
and certain number of years, which upon the 
death of the beneficiary would be paid to his 
legal representatives for the unexpired time. 
It seems clear that, in case the latter plan is 
chosen by the retiring member, the annual allow- 
ance would be less than in the former. It will, of 
47  
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
course, be necessary to publish for the informa- 
tion of members the exact amounts and differ- 
ences between these two schemes through care- 
fully prepared actuarial tables. Through their 
representatives on the State Retirement Fund 
Board both the state and the members have a 
voice in the administration of the plan, and the 
management of the venture is under the close 
inspection and supervision of the State Insur- 
ance Commissioner. 
These forms of protection seem to go as far as 
any scheme of compulsory insurance should at 
the present time. It is doubtful whether it would 
ever be possible or wise to include much more in 
any one system and fund. Even in Germany, 
where wage-workers are required to protect 
themselves against sickness, accident, disability 
due to accident at any time from the outset in 
any employment, and even against unemploy- 
ment, the state schemes have usually undertaken 
no more than insurance against old age and in- 
capacity, and under certain conditions, death, 
using other schemes and plans, usually of a pri- 
vate or semi-public character, to secure the com- 
pulsory insurance of its citizens against the other 
risks of life. 
48
-P-A-G-E-61
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
Membership, Certification, and Tenure 
Membership to be comprehensive. In the retire- 
ment system adopted, all persons should be in- 
cluded who are regularly employed, either as 
teachers or otherwise, in all of the schools of the 
state supported and controlled by the public. 
Every argument for a retirement allowance for 
teachers supports equally well the proposal that 
all others regularly employed in any capacity by 
the schools, such as clerks, bookkeepers, steno- 
graphers, engineers, and janitors, should be ad- 
mitted to membership in the same scheme. An- 
nuities for their benefit will be just as effective 
in raising the self-respect of the worker, pro- 
moting thrift, requiring saving, and safeguarding 
against the risks of old age and disability, as 
those for instructors in the schoolroom. 
Retirement allowances for employees other 
than teachers will be equally wise as a business 
proposition from the standpoint of the public, 
since there is no reason why they should not re- 
sult in the betterment of the service by attract- 
ing, holding, and retiring at the proper age, desir- 
able men and women serving in positions where 
good work is just as necessary to the efficiency of 
the school system as in the actual teaching pro- 
49
-P-A-G-E-62
THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
cess. It is equally necessary that the state should 
require the clerk and the engineer of the school 
building, as well as the teacher, to safeguard 
themselves against old age and dependency. As 
a venture in social insurance it would be both 
an unjust discrimination and confusing to pro- 
tect teachers with retirement allowances and 
neglect all others engaged in the same business. 
Certification of all new teachers by the state edu- 
cational authorities is necessary if the public is 
to secure the best results from the money which 
it gives for the support of a system of retirement 
allowances for them. Pensions or annuities of 
any kind are certain to prove even more attrac- 
tive to the incompetent than to the competent 
instructor. Any betterment in the economic con- 
dition. of workmen always brings a rush of the 
unfit, as well as the fit, to the work. Usually in 
the competition between them the wage falls to 
the old level and the good workmen are driven 
from the field. In any work or business where 
competition in the output of the worker is ab- 
sent, standards and measures of efficiency are ill- 
defined and administration is popular instead of 
expert and professional, as is sometimes, at least, 
the case with our schools; the inefficient but pre- 
tentious and self-seeking worker is very likely to 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
be chosen and remain permanently in the serv- 
ice to which he has been drawn by the conces- 
sion of a retirement allowance, thus defeating its 
large purpose of bettering the profession. 
All successful attempts to improve the effi- 
ciency of the schools by bettering the economic 
condition of the teacher should go hand in hand 
with direct selecting agencies, cutting off the rush 
of the incompetent to the field. It is equally true 
that to raise the qualifications workers must 
have before entering any occupation will avail 
but little unless at the same time the work is 
made, through increasing the wage or some other 
concession like that of a retirement allowance, 
sufficiently attractive to draw to it those who are 
able to meet its entrance requirements. Teach- 
ers’ annuities and retirement allowances in any 
state where the absence of proper selecting agen- 
cies operates to fill the schools with poor teachers 
are worse than useless, since their only effect 
would be to perpetuate the reign of the unfit. 
Legislation in behalf of teachers’ annuities of 
any kind should go hand in hand with move- 
ments raising the standards of proficiency in the 
profession and eliminating the unfit. Among the 
direct selecting agencies that might be used to 
accomplish this purpose are medical examina- 
SI
-P-A-G-E-64
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
tion of teachers, more effective supervision, more 
effective administrative selection of teachers, 
and higher standards of certification. The time 
is not ripe for a medical examination as a condi- 
tion of entrance to school work, although doubt- 
less some day it will be required. Supervision 
and administration will better the teaching serv- 
ice in the state in proportion as they are im- 
proved by the efforts of local authorities every- 
where. 
The absence of adequate state systems of 
certification for teachers has thrown the respon- 
sibility upon the community for passing upon 
the qualifications of its teachers. There is no 
fixed or general standard of experience, prepara- 
tion, or schoolroom success recognized for the 
different kinds of teaching positions. Through- 
out the country the whole matter is in a chaotic 
condition. Communities having a high degree of 
civic spirit and responsibility secure good teach- 
ers. Communities lacking these qualities are 
satisfied to secure and retain poor teachers. 
While the complaint is frequently made, un- 
doubtedly with more or less truth, that there are 
not enough good teachers to go around, the fact 
remains that communities willing to pay for good 
teachers invariably secure them. Obviously one 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
way to get good teachers is to make it impossi- 
ble for poor ones to obtain positions. A state re- 
tirement system should raise the general level of 
teaching efficiency throughout a state, and expe- 
rience has demonstrated that before teachers are 
intrenched in their positions by a pension system 
and tenure law, the quality of service should be 
safeguarded by an adequate certification plan. 
The great strength of the retirement system for 
state employees in Massachusetts lies in the fact 
that it combines with the retirement allowance an 
entrance examination to a position which elimi- 
nates the incompetent and sets up a civil service 
that insures a permanent tenure of position. 
Legislation providing teachers’ annuities should 
be supplemented by a law authorizing a system 
of certification for all the teachers protected by 
the retirement system, and the measure should 
be drawn in such terms as to leave the state edu- 
cational authorities free, not only to change their 
standards through the years to meet the chang- 
ing conditions, but to adapt their standards of 
requirements from time to time to the different 
kinds and character of teaching positions to be 
filled. 
Some form of legal tenure of position for every 
teacher must be guaranteed in some way in order 
a
-P-A-G-E-66
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
to secure the full benefit of a retirement system. 
What form such a tenure law should take is still 
a debatable issue. New Jersey is the only state 
having a tenure-of-office law guaranteeing per- 
manence of position during good behavior and 
efficiency. In his report on the East Orange 
schools, Professor E. C. Moore comments on the 
workings of the New Jersey tenure-of-office law 
as follows: ‘There is one other feature which 
does not yet, but will in time, tend to lower the 
efficiency of the schools. I refer to the state ten- 
ure-of-office law. Security in office during good 
and efficient service is something which all in- 
terested in the public schools pray earnestly for, 
but lodgment in office for life is quite another 
matter. It is practically impossible to prove pro- 
fessional incompetency in court; and places 
where teachers can appeal to the courts for final 
review of adverse action against them by boards 
of education, and are practically never dismissed, 
have poor schools. Such tenure of office is good 
for the clerk, but bad for the work. They should, 
of course, have the right to demand a public 
hearing, but it should be conducted by the 
board of education, not by a court. The best 
kind of tenure of office is that which an enlight- 
ened public demands and insists upon for its 
54
-P-A-G-E-67
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
teachers. Both teachers and people are unfor- 
tunate in having any other kind.” 
On the other hand, there can be no doubt that 
there are many places where the tenure of posi- 
tion of the teacher is uncertain and dependent 
upon the fortunes of politics, or the caprice or 
prejudice of one kind or another of school au- 
thorities and of the public. In such places, it is 
useless to expect annuities to work for the better- 
ment of the service and the welfare of the pro- 
fession. The conclusion is that some form of ten- 
ure must be provided that will safeguard the 
interests of both the pupils and the teachers. It 
seems probable that a public conscience, awake 
to the necessities of a retirement system for 
teachers, would develop a public sentiment that 
would support the principle of tenure during effi- 
ciency and good behavior, and then find a way 
to guarantee the efficiency. The highest success 
of a retirement system requires standards of cer- 
tification, approval of work performed, and cer- 
tainty of continued employment. 
State and not local support should be given 
State and not local support should be given the 
retirement allowance. It seems to be admitted 
without debate that public support and manage- 
55  
-P-A-G-E-68
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
ment of teachers’ annuity ventures are necessary 
to their success. The debatable question, if any, 
is whether the public should deal with the retire- 
ment problem through the state or through the 
cities and towns operating the schools in which 
the beneficiaries are employed. For the state to 
carry on a system of annuities for the benefit of 
those who are not directly employed by it, but by 
local communities, is a departure from the trend 
of the steps already taken by some of the states, 
in dealing with teachers’ pensions and annuities. 
Fifteen states permit towns and cities to pension 
teachers. Why should these states and the states 
having no laws for teachers’ pensions be urged 
to maintain a state system of annuities for the 
teachers employed by local communities, and how 
shall the proposal be justified ? 
While it is probably possible to grant allow- 
ances to teachers out of the treasury of a large 
city in such a way as to serve the best interests 
of its schools, municipal systems of pensions or 
annuities have never succeeded in meeting a 
state-wide need. In Massachusetts, for example, 
the present law permitting towns and cities to 
pension their teachers has not been a successful 
solution of the problem. Though the act has 
been in force about five years, only eleven out 
56
-P-A-G-E-69
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
of three hundred and fifty-four cities and towns 
have accepted its provisions. There is no indica- 
tion that any considerable portion of the teach- 
ers of the state would ever receive the benefit of 
the statute. 
Where allowances have been made under mu- 
nicipal systems, they have usually been so small 
as to afford an inadequate competence for old 
age, thus defeating in large measure all the pur- 
poses of the legislation. The main intent usually 
is to give school committees a more satisfactory 
way out in retiring old teachers. It is possible 
that the moral and social effect of the gratui- 
ties or concessions granted may not be for the 
final welfare of the individual or the permanent 
good of the profession. Such schemes are not 
based on sound principles of social insurance, and 
at best can only be regarded as a temporary ex- 
pedient and a forerunner of a more comprehen- 
sive plan. 
Even if a city here and there should grant 
an adequate pension to the superannuated in- 
structor, the educational benefit to the state as a 
whole would be small if not questionable, since 
the result would probably be simply to enable 
the schools concerned to attract and to hold a 
few desirable teachers, as against other cities 
OY
-P-A-G-E-70
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
and towns. Were every community required to 
grant retirement allowances, supported entirely 
out of the local treasury, to those who have by 
long years of faithful service acquired some claim 
to its bounty, teachers would practically be 
obliged to spend their lives in one school system 
in order to profit by the gratuity, thus destroying 
the mobility of the teaching profession, which 
has been one of the largest, if not the largest 
source of initiative and growth. It is equally 
true that under present conditions, owing to the 
mobility of teachers, their insecurity of tenure, 
and other circumstances that need not be dis- 
cussed here, a retirement system maintained out 
of public funds, in whole or in part contributed 
by the locality, can be effective only in the larger 
cities. 
With the recognition of the soundness of the 
principles of contribution and withdrawal equi- 
ties as features of retirement allowance systems, 
local pension systems for all the cities and towns 
of the state become at once impracticable, and 
a state system becomes necessary as the only 
proper way to deal with the question. With joint 
support on the part of the teacher and the com- 
munity, every town and city in a state would be 
required to carry on a savings-bank account with 
58
-P-A-G-E-71
    
RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
each member of the teaching force, to invest his 
earnings profitably and yet safely, and to guaran- 
tee his accumulated savings; a service which it is 
certain that, generally speaking, only the state, 
dealing with the problem on a larger scale and 
equipped with the larger resources for invest- 
ment furnished by a state-wide teaching force 
and, possibly, by legislative appropriations, 
would be able to render to the best advantage. 
There is a large measure of truth in the claim 
that although teachers may be paid their salaries 
out of local funds, yet both in law and in fact 
they are, in more senses than one, state employ- 
ees. There is no other local enterprise which the 
state has attempted to regulate by legislation 
so much as the public schools. From whatever 
source they are paid, the state looks to teach- 
ers as their agents to fit the children of every 
city, hamlet, and remote country place for useful 
and intelligent citizenship. The mobility of the 
teaching profession shifting from one position to 
another, the interchange of pupils between local- 
ities, the interest of every community in the re- 
sults of the education given in every other place 
as well as by its own schools, make the ques- 
tion of the efficiency of the teacher a matter of 
state-wide concern, and justify the state in doing 
59  
-P-A-G-E-72
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
anything necessary for the betterment of the pro- 
fession which cities and towns are unable to do 
properly. 
Recognizing the semi-state character of the 
service of the teacher, all the Western Common- 
wealths have from the first used the income from 
the large permanent common-school funds which 
they are so fortunate as to possess, to pay a large 
part of the salaries of the men and women serv- 
ing in local public schools. It seems clear that all 
over the country it will be necessary for the state 
in the future, with its large resources as a wider 
taxing unit, to give larger financial aid to the 
cause of education; adjusting inequalities in local 
burdens; aiding struggling communities; stimu- 
lating new forms of education like industrial 
training, household arts, and agricultural train- 
ing; doing the things which the local community 
is unable to do; doing things for the betterment 
of the teaching profession and the work of the 
schools, like the certification and retirement of 
teachers: all of which require a larger outlook, 
collective action, and also central administration 
of a kind which only the state and not the local 
community can bring to bear. 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
    RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
Cost of the proposed plan 
The cost of any proposed plan for retirement 
allowances, in view of the far-reaching financial 
responsibilities involved, should be known within 
reasonable limits before it is adopted. Teachers 
who are required to become members upon en- 
tering the profession should know definitely both 
the amount of the dues which they are required 
to pay, and the return which they are to receive 
from the investment made and from the pension 
contributed by the state. This is more necessary 
in ascheme for the employees of the public schools 
than in the case of the present retirement sys- 
tem for state employees. The membership will, 
finally at least, be larger, more widely scattered, 
and in the employ of cities and towns rather than 
that of the state operating the venture. 
In order that the prospective members of the 
retirement allowance scheme may have this in- 
formation, tables should be prepared showing by 
years the cost to the members according to their 
salaries, the present worth of accumulated sav- 
ings, the amount of the annuity and} the amount 
of an equal pension to which the beneficiary is 
entitled upon withdrawal for disability or at the 
close of the full period of service required. The 
61  
-P-A-G-E-74
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
effect of this will be to put teachers in possession 
of as much, if not more, information before en- 
tering this compulsory insurance venture than 
they would have in taking out a policy with any 
standard insurance company. 
The state should bear the cost of the adminis- 
tration of the venture. A state retirement fund 
board, to serve without pay, ought to have an 
executive secretary to carry out its rulings. A 
man competent to do this work properly should 
certainly receive a salary of not less than thirty- 
five hundred dollars per year. In addition, there 
would probably be office rent, certainly office 
expenses, and the cost of clerical and actuarial 
service. 
Animportant and difficult question is the prob- 
able cost to the state of any retirement system 
it may undertake. The state is entitled to know 
this roughly, at least, before any law is enacted. 
Obviously only an approximation can be given. 
The number of teachers in different age groups 
can be ascertained, but it cannot be predicted in 
the present state of our statistical knowledge 
how many of them will remain in the work of 
teaching long enough to become pensionable. 
We can say there are so many teachers in the 
state between seventy and sixty years of age, so 
62
-P-A-G-E-75
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
many between sixty years and fifty, and so on; 
7f the ratio continues as it has in the past, the 
cost in any given period will be a certain maxi- 
mum sum that can be roughly worked out. The 
cost for a period twenty or thirty years hence 
cannot be so well predicted. Nobody can fore- 
tell the economic development of any state, how 
many children then will be in school, or the num- 
ber of teachers required to teach them. 
It is certain, however, that if past experience 
is duplicated by future developments, the initial 
cost will be the smallest, and will gradually in- 
crease, reaching a maximum at the time those 
teachers compelled to enter the retirement sys- 
tem reach the age of retirement, from thirty to 
forty years after the date of the inauguration of 
the system. The Report of the Massachusetts 
Board of Education on Teachers’ Retirement 
Allowances (1913) suggests a fairly satisfactory 
method of approaching this problem. 
It is difficult to estimate the amount of the 
‘cost at that time. We do not know what the 
’ population of any state will be, or the number of 
school children, or the number of teachers. It is 
impossible to predict the industrial and economic 
conditions upon which the matter of teachers 
remaining or not in the service may so largely 
63
-P-A-G-E-76
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
depend. It is impossible to forecast the effect of 
the retirement system in holding teachers in the 
work. 
It must be remembered, as has already been 
pointed out, that there is every probability that 
the contribution by the public to the support of 
the teachers’ retirement allowance is, after all, 
only a deferred payment and, therefore, a part of 
the teacher’s total wage. Many believe, as has 
also been shown, that this concession on the part 
of the public plays a part in each new wage read- 
justment with the teacher, and in this way be- 
comes an actual though deferred part of the com- 
pensation. To the extent to which this is true 
the cost of teachers’ retirement ventures is in the 
long run no real burden upon the public. The 
effect would be simply to shift the expense of a 
part of the teacher’s salary from the local to the 
state treasury. 
For reasons that have already been discussed, 
if the contributions of the public represent, as de- 
ferred payments, an increase in wage, then the 
state has simply come to the aid of the commu- 
nity by adding to the wage paid out of the local 
treasury an extra bonus or gratuity justifiable 
as being necessary for the good of the teaching 
profession, and as a good business proposition, 
64

because it will probably yield better returns in 
making the teacher’s position attractive than the 
same amount of money spent in any other way 
for the same purpose. To this must be added the 
social returns to the state through the encourage- 
ment of thrift, the enforcement of saving, and 
the protection of a group of workers against 
the two great risks of life, old age and incapac- 
ity, that have always been such a large social 
burden. 
Conclusion as regards teachers hereafter entering 
the service 
A. Retirement allowances for teachers are a 
wise investment of public funds, because 
they make possible improvement in the 
service not generally obtainable without 
them by — 
1. Opening the way to retiring incapaci- 
tated teachers without hardship. 
2. Making it possible to — 
(a) Attract better talent into the serv- 
ice. 
(®) Hold the best that enter the serv- 
ice. 
(c) Encourage those in the service to 
more efficient work. 
65  
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
. Retirement allowances for teachers admin- 
istered as social insurance are a wise invest- 
ment of public funds because — 
(a) They tend to promote thrift. 
(0) They tend to make employment more 
stable. 
(c) They free the state from the possibility 
of supporting a number of indigent, 
superannuated people. 
. A retirement allowance for teachers yet to 
enter the service should carry with it cer- 
tain obligations on the prospective bene- 
ficiaries. Among these are compulsory par- 
ticipation, compulsory withdrawal age, 
acceptance of the principle of certification, 
and some form of legal tenure of position. 
The obligations on the state are, to con- 
tribute at least one half the retirement 
allowance, to safeguard the savings of the 
teacher by limitation of investment, to 
guarantee to pay established withdrawal 
equities, and to pay definitely ascertained 
annuities. 
. Ina complete system of retirement, old age 
should be recognized as a cause for per- 
manent retirement; disability should be 
recognized as a cause for temporary retire- 
66
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
ment; invalidism should be recognized as 
a cause for temporary or permanent retire- 
ment. An equitable plan for insurance 
against these risks of life should be worked 
out. 
E. The administration of the retirement sys- 
tem should rest jointly upon the teachers 
and designated state officials. 
Conclusions as regards teachers now in service 
Every argument for retirement allowances for 
teachers yet to enter the service applies with 
equal, if not greater, force to teachers already in 
service. In the administration of a plan for re- 
‘tirement, however, certain departures from the 
principles heretofore laid down must be made if 
justice is to be done to all. For example, par- 
ticipation should be voluntary rather than com- 
pulsory, and the age limit of service should not 
be forced upon teachers not desiring to avail 
themselves of the benefits of the system. Further- 
more, while the state may well enforce an assess- 
ment that will produce one half the retirement 
allowance in the case of teachers yet to enter the 
service, such an assessment would be unjust if 
applied to many teachers now in the service. 
In the administration of a plan for teachers 
67
-P-A-G-E-80
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
now in service, applying sound insurance princi- 
ples so far as possible, three groups of teachers 
appear for special consideration: — 
ie 
2. Teachers under thirty years of age might 
well enter the retirement system on the 
same terms as teachers yet to enter the serv- 
ice, as it is possible for them to make suffi- 
cient contributions to pay one half of a re- 
spectable retirement allowance at age sixty 
and beyond. 
Teachers sixty years of age and upwards 
can make very little contribution to a re- 
tirement system. It should be expected 
that the state would virtually’ pay these 
people a straight pension, and a minimum 
sum should be fixed by law. 
. Between these groups lies the group, ages 
thirty to sixty, and they present a great 
variety of problems. Those nearest thirty 
can make contributions which will produce 
substantially one half of an equitable retire- 
ment allowance. Those teachers nearest 
sixty can make less. It would seem just, 
therefore, that these teachers should be as- 
sessed a definitely fixed percentage of their 
salary and allow these contributions at com- 
pound interest to purchase at retirement 
68
-P-A-G-E-81
  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
whatever annuity they will. Then the state 
should contribute enough to make up a de- 
finitely guaranteed retirement allowance on 
the basis of a pension for service prior to the 
time when the law went into effect.
-P-A-G-E-82
  IV 
CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODEL RETIREMENT 
LAW 
THE Seventh Annual Report of the Carnegie 
Foundation (1913) enumerates certain essential 
and fundamental principles in an equitable 
teachers’ pension system, as follows: — 
(a) Compulsory participation and contribu- 
tion on the part of all who enter the service. 
(6) Retirement annuity earned by the contri- 
bution plus an equal pension from the 
state. 
(c) Withdrawal equity in case of death, or 
permanent withdrawal. 
(d) A central unpaid administrative board 
with a paid executive. 
The suggestions for an old-age retirement law 
hereafter made conform to these principles. 
In the same report, the Carnegie Foundation 
proposes a method of payment of annuities for 
disability with which we cannot agree. It says: 
“There is one modification of this simple scheme 
which would add little to the expense, but which 
would cover practically all that a pension system 
7°
-P-A-G-E-83
  A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
for public-school teachers should at this time at- 
tempt to do, that is, the payment of a propor- 
tionate pension for a given length of service in 
case of disability. For example, a state might 
well afford to pay, after fifteen years of service 
and of contribution, an agreed-upon proportion- 
ate pension to the teacher who had broken down 
in its service.” 
An examination of the financial aspects of the 
situation demonstrates that such a scheme is both 
inadequate and hazardous. The report says the 
average salary of a teacher in the United States is 
slightly less than five hundred dollars; and, fur- 
ther, that the old-age retiring allowance should 
probably be about fifty per cent of the salary at 
time of retirement. This gives us two hundred 
and fifty dollars as an average retiring allowance 
at age sixty. Now assume that the teacher retires 
after fifteen years’ service on a “proportionate 
part” of this allowance, and we arrive at the pos- 
sibility of retiring allowances of one hundred and 
twenty-five dollars or less per annum. 
If disability includes (as it should) invalidism 
and disabling accidents, temporary and perma- 
nent, no further discussion is needed to show that 
such an amount is hopelessly inadequate to meet 
the needs; and it should be perfectly obvious that 
7°
-P-A-G-E-84
  
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
the solution is to be found in compulsory disability 
insurance, adjusted to the occupational risks of 
teaching, and charging a sufficient premium to 
guarantee reasonable protection. Disability due 
to old age and disability for invalidism and acci- 
dent are two separate propositions, and to deal 
with them in one measure in such inadequate 
financial terms is inviting “guesswork legisla- 
tion” that will jeopardize the whole plan of old- 
age insurance. 
In the following suggestions regarding a retire- 
ment law, the scope of that law is limited entirely 
to an old-age measure. Before passing to that 
discussion, it might be well to indicate certain 
facts regarding disability insurance anda method 
of determining the occupational risk of teaching. 
We are assured by actuaries that no statistics 
are available to determine with any degree of 
accuracy the occupational risk of teaching. It is 
evident that this risk, while it may be greater 
or less than some other occupations, differs. For 
example, teaching school offers a different sort of 
risk from that of working with high-speed ma- 
chinery. We are also told that the premium rate 
charged for health and accident insurance by 
commercial companies is greater than probably 
needs to be charged for such occupations as that of 
72
-P-A-G-E-85
    A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
teaching. This, however, is largely guesswork. 
No one has yet made an investigation to deter- 
mine the occupational risk, and it would be 
highly desirable for some organization having 
funds at its disposal to undertake such a study. 
The average teaching life in the United States 
has been computed to be between six and seven 
years. As this period of employment is usually 
during young womanhood and manhood, the 
total health risk should be less than for other 
occupations that attract people for longer years 
of service. One actuary estimates that a small 
annual premium, perhaps five dollars, paid by all 
teachers in a state on a mutual insurance basis, 
would enable such a body of teachers to pay 
very satisfactory annuities for totally disabling 
sickness or temporary or permanent disability 
due to accident. If such be the case, statistics 
should be collected from which an actuary can 
compute the occupational risk and determine an 
adequate premium rate to cover it. It is possi- 
ble that in the case of permanent disability, the 
state should supplement, after a definite term of 
service, the insurance so raised. But such a fund 
should be separate from the old-age pension 
fund. 
To collect such statistics would be a compara- 
73
-P-A-G-E-86
THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
tively easy task. For example, it should be possi- 
ble to go back, say forty years, in the records of a 
normal school and follow the vital history of each 
member of the graduating classes for five suc- 
cessive years. Such an inquiry would include, in 
addition to the vital statistics, such information 
as the length of teaching period, reason for with- 
drawal, date of reéntrance, length of subsequent 
service, if any, and the time lost for sickness 
during teaching periods. 
Some such set of figures should be collected for 
graduating classes dating back, say from twenty 
to fifteen years. It should be possible, from rec- 
ords of city schools, to ascertain the same body 
of facts for two five-year periods, following out 
the life history of each member of the teaching 
staff between certain dates. A body of material 
could thus be collected from which an actuary 
could determine the occupational risk and pre- 
mium rate. 
To sum up, then, disability and old age being 
entirely different risks, a complete plan of insur- 
ance should comprehend at least two distinct 
measures. It will be better to proceed on sound 
principles, and since at this time the data for 
drafting a law covering an equitable insurance 
scheme against disability are not available, the 
74
-P-A-G-E-87
  A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
subject should be approached first from the 
standpoint of old-age insurance, but with the ex- 
pectation of completing the scheme as rapidly as 
possible by the addition, in a separate measure, 
of a disability law. 
Characteristics of a model old-age retirement law 
I 
It is becoming recognized more and more that 
in such far-reaching and important legislation as 
that proposed for retirement systems, the section 
following the enacting clause should be devoted 
to defining accurately important terms used in 
the act. The proposed act, providing for a retire- 
ment system for public-school teachers in Mass- 
achusetts, contains thirteen definitions. Massa- 
chusetts statutes overlap and in some particulars 
are apparently inconsistent, so that this number 
need not necessarily mean that every state would 
need so many. In popular writing, the terms 
“annuities,” “pensions,” and “retirement allow- 
ances”’ are indiscriminately used. These are ex- 
amples of terms, the meaning of which should be 
precisely indicated as used in the act. In some 
states the laws are not clear as to exactly what is 
a public school. A high school or an industrial 
school may or may not be a public school within 
75
-P-A-G-E-88
  
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
the intent of existing law. A careful study of the 
statutes and judicial decisions is essential in 
framing a new statute so as to cover just what 
is intended. Attention to this important matter 
will doubtless prevent much future litigation. 
rr 
‘A date for the establishment of the retirement 
system should be set far enough in the future to 
allow sufficient time to organize the necessary 
administrative machinery. 
Tit 
Regardless of any local pension plans that may 
be in force at the time of the adoption of a state- 
wide act, a date should be fixed, after which all 
teachers entering the service in the state must 
become members of the retirement system. It 
should be provided that all local systems will in 
time cease to operate. 
All teachers in service at the time when the 
act takes effect should be permitted to become 
members of the state system regardless of any 
expectancy they may have in a local system, but 
provision should be made that at no time after 
retirement shall a person be in receipt of both a 
state and a local pension. 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
Careful provision should be made, however, 
for reimbursement out of the state treasury to 
towns and cities continuing to pay pensions un- 
der local systems to teachers in service who do 
not elect to become members of the state system. 
A provision should be inserted that teachers 
who neglect to join the retirement system on the 
specified date may become members of the retire- 
ment association thereafter by paying an amount 
equal to the amount, with interest, they would 
have paid had they become members in the be- 
ginning. 
IV 
A retirement board should be established. 
This should be an unpaid board, but should em- 
ploy a paid expert secretary as its executive. Its 
membership, duties, and the method of filling 
vacancies should be carefully defined. It is sug- 
gested that the official heads of the three state 
departments of insurance, banking, and educa- 
tion should represent the state on this retire- 
ment board. Three members should be elected 
by the prospective beneficiaries from their own 
membership. These six should elect a seventh 
member, who should be neither a teacher nor a 
state official. 
Broad powers should be vested in this board, 
77
-P-A-G-E-90
    THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
such as power to fix the annuity tables, power to 
prescribe and enforce administrative orders upon 
school officials and members of the retirement 
association, and power to enforce any by-laws 
adopted to carry out the intent of the law. 
v 
The method of raising funds should be very 
carefully prescribed. The necessary funds are: 
(a) expense fund; (0) pension fund; (c) annuity 
fund. 
The expense fund is the amount necessary to 
pay the administrative expenses of the system; 
it should be entirely supported by the state and 
should be appropriated at each session of the 
state legislature on estimates furnished by the 
retirement board. 
The pension fund is the amount of money nec- 
essary to pay pensions under the act. It is the 
state’s contribution to the system, and should be 
appropriated at each session of the legislature 
rather than by building up an enormous sinking 
fund in anticipation of future demands. 
The annuity fund is the amount contributed 
by the teachers with compound interest upon 
the same. It is raised by assessments upon the 
teachers’ wages. It should be within the powers 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
of the retirement board to establish an assess- 
ment rate within fixed percentages of the salary, 
say four to seven per cent. There should be no 
difficulty about leaving this flexible, since the 
members of the association should have half the 
representation upon the board and should be in 
a position to respond readily to the wishes of the 
members. 
There should, however, be a fixed minimum 
assessment below which no teacher should pay; 
and a fixed maximum above which no teacher 
should be permitted to pay. This minimum 
should be an amount sufficient to provide, ac- 
cording to accepted annuity tables, whatever 
annuity it is desired to pay at a fixed age. For 
example: thirty-five dollars deposited annually 
for thirty years will, at compound interest at 
three per cent, pay an annuity of approximately 
one hundred and fifty dollars at age sixty years. 
It is possible, then, to place this system upon a 
sound insurance basis. Thirty annual contribu- 
tions of one hundred dollars will yield at regu- 
lar interest (three per cent) an amount sufficient 
to produce an annuity of approximately five 
hundred dollars at age sixty. 
As has been pointed out before, while a thirty- 
five dollar annual assessment may look large to 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
many teachers, this cost may rapidly be shifted 
over upon the community employing the teachers 
and no permanent diminution of wages will follow. 
In fact, it may be expected that wages will in 
some school systems, at least, rapidly respond to 
this necessary increased expense to the teacher. 
Provision should be made that teachers may 
pay assessments during the entire time of their 
service, providing that they may not contribute 
an amount in excess of the amount necessary to 
produce an annuity of five hundred dollars at 
the age of sixty. 
Vi 
The time and method of paying retirement 
allowances should be carefully prescribed. For 
example, if sixty years is taken as the age for 
voluntary retirement, then seventy may well be 
taken as the age for compulsory retirement. The 
teacher should be definitely guaranteed that the 
amount which he has contributed, with com- 
pound interest thereon, will produce a definitely 
fixed annuity. The state should pay an equal 
amount ina pension. At this point it is desirable, 
especially in the case of men who may have de- 
pendent families, to give an option between re- 
ceiving a definite annuity and a smaller annuity 
80
-P-A-G-E-93
  A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
with a certain guaranty of insurance. Such 
phraseology as the following covers this: — 
An annuity of less amount, payable in quar- 
terly payments, as may be determined by the 
retirement board, with the provision that if 
the annuitant dies before receiving payments 
equal to the sum of his assessments with regu- 
lar interest, the difference between such pay- 
ments and the amount of his contributions, 
with regular interest, shall be paid to his legal 
representatives. 
This option is given by insurance compa- 
nies, and the annuity so fixed by one company 
amounts to 78-108 of the total annuity due. The 
difference is virtually the premium on a paid-up 
insurance. 
One of the most difficult sections to construct 
is one putting a teacher in service on an equality 
with teachers yet to enter the service, that is to 
say, so that past service may receive from the 
state compensation equal to that provided for 
future service. We have here a situation involv- 
ing teachers who have from one to thirty years to 
serve; teachers who have served varying num- 
bers of years in the state; some who can make 
contributions sufficient to produce a respectable 
81
-P-A-G-E-94
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
annuity, others who cannot. So far as the pen- 
sion goes (the state’s contribution), all teachers 
should be on exactly the same footing. The fol- 
lowing phraseology shows how such a situation 
may be met: — 
Any teacher in service when this act takes ef- 
fect who shall have become a member of the re- 
tirement association, and who shall have served 
fifteen years or more in the public schools of the 
state, not less than five of which shall immedi- 
ately precede retirement, shall be entitled to re- 
ceive a retirement allowance as follows: — 
(a) Such annuity as his contributions may 
earn, 
(b) A pension equal to the annuity. 
(c) An additional annual pension to such an 
amount that the sum of this additional 
pension and the pension mentioned in (6) 
shall equal the pension to which he would 
have been entitled had he paid thirty as- 
sessments on his average yearly wage for 
the fifteen years preceding his retirement 
at the rate in effect at the time of his re« 
tirement. 
(d) A clause should be added guaranteeing 
that if the total retirement allowance 
82
-P-A-G-E-95
  ‘A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
under (a), (6), and (c), is not, say three 
hundred dollars, the state shall provide a 
further pension sufficient to make a total 
retirement allowance of three hundred dol- 
lars.   
      
Under such a plan, every teacher retiring, 
whether he retires immediately after the act takes 
effect or serves for a series of years, is guaranteed 
three hundred dollars. He pays assessments so 
long as he may remain in service after the act 
takes effect. His annuity is guaranteed, and his 
pension is on the same basis as if his pension 
were reckoned on future service. 
VII 
Provision should be made for the return of all 
assessments, with interest thereon, in case the 
teacher withdraws for any cause prior to becoming 
eligible to retirement. It is contended by many 
people that if this withdrawal takes place after 
ten years of service, the amount should be repaid 
in the form of an annuity in order to safeguard 
the invested savings of the teacher. In case 
a teacher withdraws and dies before receiving 
the amount of his contributions, the difference 
should be paid to his legal heirs. 
83
-P-A-G-E-96
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
VII 
Provision should be made exempting the an- 
nuity fund from taxation, attachment, or assign- 
ment, and all funds that are invested in personal 
property should be exempt from taxation. 
x 
The duties of local school officials in executing 
the provisions of the act should be formulated 
with great care. For example, it should be the 
duty of the school officials — 
Te To notify every applicant for a teaching 
position of his duties and obligations under 
the retirement act. 
. To certify to the retirement board the 
names of all teachers in their employ to 
whom the act applies. ‘ 
. To notify the retirement board of the em- 
ployment of new teachers, removals, with- 
drawals, changes in salary. 
. To furnish all information required by the 
retirement board in the discharge of its 
duties. 
. To deduct, as directed by the retirement 
board, from the salary due each teacher, all 
84
-P-A-G-E-97
  
» A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
amounts’ due as contributions to the an- 
nuity fund. 
6. To keep careful records as required by the 
retirement board. 
x 
The treasurer of each town or city should for- 
ward to the state treasurer all amounts due as 
deducted by employing school authorities. The 
state treasurer should be the custodian of the 
annuity fund, should invest it, and should be 
obliged by law to furnish to the retirement board 
an annual statement of the condition of the an- 
nuity fund. The state treasurer should also, on 
order of the retirement board, pay all pensions 
and annuities. 
xI 
In many states, the question of absorbing 
local pension systems into a state system will be 
a vexing one. A great amount of discrimination 
must be exercised in order to preserve the rights 
of all prospective beneficiaries of local pension 
systems, on the one hand, and local taxpayers, 
on the other. The method of taking over local 
retirement systems by the New York state sys- 
tem is an example of unfortunate legislation. 
85  
-P-A-G-E-98
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
Suffice it to say that actuaries have declared the 
New York state retirement system as absolutely 
bankrupt, and the law in crying need of amend- 
ment. Sections similar to the two following will 
go a long way toward solving the difficulty: — 
Whenever a town or city retires a teacher 
after the adoption of this act, and pays such 
teacher a pension in accordance with any pension 
system previously authorized by law, and the 
school officials of said town or city certify under 
oath to the retirement board to the amount of said 
pension, said town or city shall be reimbursed 
therefor annually from the state treasury; pro- 
vided that no such reimbursement shall be in ex- 
cess of the amount, as determined by the retire- 
ment board, to which said teacher would have 
been entitled as a pension had he become a mem- 
ber of the retirement association under the pro- 
visions of this act. 
On or before (here insert a date) of each ses- 
sion of the legislature, the retirement board shall 
present to the legislature a statement of the 
amount expended previous to the preceding first 
day of December by cities and towns in the pay- 
ment of pensions under the provisions of the 
preceding paragraph, for which such cities and 
86 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  A MODEL RETIREMENT LAW 
towns should receive reimbursement. On the 
basis of such a statement, the General Court may 
make an appropriation for the reimbursement 
of such cities and towns up to the first day of 
December. 
By means of such provisions the rights of all 
parties are protected, and by a provision to the 
effect that all new teachers must become mem- 
bers of the state system and not the local system, 
the principle of state pensions is guaranteed, 
and it will only be a limited number of years 
when all local pension systems will be wiped out 
and a complete state system set up. 
XII 
A date should be set after which local pension 
schemes, if any exist in the state, shall become 
inoperative for teachers entering the service. - 
XI 
Some court should be specifically authorized, 
as having jurisdiction in the first instance, in case 
of dispute between a beneficiary and the retire- 
ment board.
-P-A-G-E-100

GETTING LEGISLATION * 
Ir will be apparent to those who have read thus 
far that the problem of teachers’ pensions is by 
no means as simple as it was thought not long 
since, and no campaign for legislation should be 
undertaken without serious study of all the fac- 
tors involved. It is of vastly greater importance 
than simply relieving the schools of a few out- 
worn teachers, and the time has arrived in the 
development of such legislation when we should 
approach the subject with certain well-ascer- 
tained facts and principles in mind. Much of 
this legislation heretofore has been hasty and 
ill-considered, and some of it has been in effect 
long enough to show that the anticipated bene- 
fits do not accrue; hence, in some states there is 
already a demand for amendment and changes 
of various sorts both in local and state plans. 
The ideal method of legislation would be the 
enactment of two separate measures — one ap- 
plying to teachers in service on a certain date; 
1 See also, ‘Teachers’ Pension Legislation in Massachusetts,” 
W. I. Hamilton, School Board Journal, August, 1913. 
88
-P-A-G-E-101
    
GETTING LEGISLATION 
the other applying to teachers entering the serv- 
ice after that date. So far as is known this 
method has never been followed in this country, 
but from now on it should receive careful con- 
sideration. There is a clear line of demarcation 
between the two groups of teachers mentioned, 
and certain provisions can be made affecting new 
teachers that would be neither equitable nor just 
in the case of teachers already in service. Con- 
tributory systems can be made compulsory 
for teachers entering the service as one of the 
terms of such service, but in the case of teachers 
already in service participation should be vol- 
untary. 
As a further illustration it may be pointed out 
that new teachers can be required to teach a 
sufficient length of time to guarantee a reason- 
able annuity yielded by their own contributions, 
whereas in the case of teachers already in the serv- 
ice, some of whom should be retired at once, the 
state may expect to pay a larger proportionate 
share of the retirement allowance than it would 
for new teachers. In many of our states, equities 
in existing pension systems have been built up by 
teachers now in service which they do not wish 
to give up; whereas in the case of new teachers a 
way should be found to require all new teachers 
89
-P-A-G-E-102
    
THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
to enter the state system, and this means the ulti- 
mate abandonment of all existing local systems. 
It should be anticipated that no new system 
will be inaugurated that will not be financially 
sound and provide definitely ascertained annui- 
ties. It has already become evident that certain 
local systems do not meet these conditions, and 
from every standpoint it would be far better for 
teachers in those places to seek a method of par- 
ticipation in a sound state system. 
Opposition to this plan for two laws is almost 
certain to develop. Teachers fear that a legisla- 
ture will enact a law costing little or nothing for 
its execution until after a long period of years has 
elapsed, but might not be willing to enact an- 
other law providing for them on an equal finan- 
cial basis, calling for immediate expenditure. 
Favorably disposed members of the legislature, 
fearing the opposition of forces arrayed against 
all forms of state pensions, frequently will mani- 
fest a desire to deal with the questions in one 
measure. 
There will be less difficulty in states in which 
local pension systems are little developed, as in 
these states all that is necessary is the education 
of the public to the support of sound social in- 
surance principles. There will be more and more 
go
-P-A-G-E-103
  GETTING LEGISLATION 
opposition as local pension systems may extend; 
and when certain vested rights are built up 
through a long term of years, the absorption of 
local pension systems into a sound state system 
becomes an extremely difficult and complicated 
question. Indeed, it is not clear that it has yet 
been successfully done in this country. 
The New York state system is an unfortunate 
example of an attempt to pass a satisfactory law 
providing for all teachers in the state, at the same 
time catering to certain prejudices, more or less 
well considered, on the part of many teachers 
already provided with pensions from local sources. 
This experience clearly indicates the necessity for 
a different method of procedure. 
The writer does not undertake to lay out a 
program that will fit all the states not now pro- 
viding teachers’ pensions. Such effort would be 
useless, as local conditions make a vast deal of 
difference in dealing with any question of legis- 
lation. While no complete statement can be 
made, certain facts can now be regarded as estab- 
lished; and it is urged that when any legislation 
is projected, it shall be with the idea of providing 
a sound and equitable system for all teachers 
entering the service on and after a fixed date 
and the immediate or gradual abandonment of 
gi
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
all local systems. With this principle in mind any 
necessary adjustments can be made for taking 
care of teachers now in the service. 
Only one method can be followed which will 
bring about this result, namely, the securing of a 
unanimous public sentiment; and the public in 
this case includes at least the teachers pro- 
vided with pensions under local schemes, other 
teachers not provided with pensions, prospective 
teachers, and all the citizens of the state inter- 
ested in social welfare. Public sentiment must be 
aroused to recognize that the pension provided 
by the state tends to the ultimate good of all 
the schools of the state, whereas local pension 
systems may perpetuate certain already existing 
inequalities in the public-school system. The 
support of a method that will secure this unani- 
mous public opinion indicates a degree of profes- 
sional spirit greatly to be desired in the teachers 
of the country. 
If it is proved to be impossible to pass two 
separate bills, old teachers and new teachers 
should be dealt with in separate sections of the 
one bill; and there should be a clear line of de- 
marcation in the provisions affecting these teach- 
ers, even at the expense of repetitions, and the 
provisions affecting each group should be clear 
g2
-P-A-G-E-105
  
  GETTING LEGISLATION 
and distinct so as to avoid confusion in the minds 
of legislators, the public, and the teachers af- 
fected. When such a bill has been drawn, with 
the experience we now have there can be no ex- 
cuse for not submitting the same to an actuary, 
who will be able to state to a close approxima- 
tion the amount allowed each teacher under its 
terms, and pass upon the financial soundness of 
the proposed scheme. 
As pointed out in a previous paragraph, there 
is bound to be a growing amount of difficulty 
in merging local pension systems into the state 
system, because in many states these local sys- 
tems authorized by law have grown to consider- 
able magnitude. It is always difficult to win to 
new things those who already have fixed rights 
in the old. It is the inevitable tendency on the 
part of the holders thereof to let well enough 
alone and to look with suspicion upon the new. 
Furthermore, in many sections of the country, if 
not in all, there is a formidable amount of local 
pride, and a great faith in local autonomy, along 
with considerable distrust for centralization. 
It is difficult, and perhaps impossible, to state 
in terms of dollars and cents the exact amount of 
annuities or future financial benefits under such 
a plan as has been proposed herein, while many 
93  
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
existing plans provide for flat pensions. The 
apparent security of local pensions has proved 
unfounded under several existing plans, but wher- 
ever it exists, one can count on opposition to the 
plan herein proposed. It has been demonstrated 
that it is impossible in some sections of the coun- 
try to get teachers now in service willingly to 
abandon their local plans and come into a state 
system. 
Since local pension systems generally develop 
first in large cities, an attempt to force all teach- 
ers into a state system is likely to develop an 
undesirable antagonism between the teachers of 
those cities and the teachers elsewhere in the 
state. There is always the fear on the part of 
many taxpayers that they may be doubly taxed 
for the support of both local and state plans. 
This opposition can be disposed of by a proper 
system of reimbursement. 
Participation in a state system and abandon- 
ment of local systems should not be insisted upon 
to the detriment of other important interests, 
but if in the preliminary period we can clear the 
ground by unanimous agreement that all new 
teachers must come into a state system, and all 
local plans must then gradually be abandoned, 
we have greatly simplified the difficulties in 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
GETTING LEGISLATION 
getting satisfactory legislation. We should go 
further wherever possible and open the way for 
teachers already in service anywhere in the state 
to enter the state system, because any pension 
system based upon sound insurance principles 
succeeds in proportion to the number of people 
in it. 
Furthermore, without such a provision there 
will always be the question of the status of teach- 
ers who begin teaching under the provision of the 
state system and then at a later period go to some 
city supporting a local system. Such a situation 
is now found in the State of Massachusetts, where 
Boston teachers are, at their desire, excluded from 
the state system. It is not clear what will be the 
status of a teacher who serves fifteen or twenty 
years outside of that city and then enters the 
service of the Boston public schools. 
It would seem that there is no sound argument 
for the permanent exclusion of any group of 
teachers from the operation of a state law. No 
municipal pension law is so liberal that its finan- 
cial benefits should not be duplicated by the state 
Jaw, when the municipal plan is sound. Some of 
them are not. Even so good a system as that 
of New York City has been supposed to be has 
reached a point where the secretary says, in his 
95
-P-A-G-E-108
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
latest annual report, “It is time our pension law 
was rewritten on sound actuarial lines.” With 
proper care there is every likelihood that the 
state system will be sound and permanent; 
whereas many local systems are temporary and 
expedient, and up to date have been looked upon 
as a method for relieving the schools of certain 
outworn teachers rather than as a large problem 
of social insurance. 
Approaching the whole problem broadly, how- 
ever, after an organization has been effected and 
a public sentiment developed that will support a 
state teachers’ pension system, it would seem 
advisable for a commission to be appointed that 
will study the problem scientifically and in the 
light of all available information. In all prob- 
ability, such a commission, if given sufficient 
time, could work out, in states where there are 
local pension systems, a merger scheme that 
would be satisfactory to the local communities 
on the side of taxation and provide justly for all 
teachers concerned. 
It would be well for such a commission to re- 
port in advance of bringing the pension bill be- 
fore the legislature; but if such a procedure is 
not followed, definite provision for such scientific 
study should be made in the proposed law. It 
96

GETTING LEGISLATION 
might be possible to provide for a state board of 
retirement, having power to make such adjust- 
ments as are necessary, subject to the approval 
of the governor. While such provision could not 
pass in many states because of local prejudices, 
there is a growing tendency to legislate with more 
care and more accurate knowledge than hereto- 
fore. Wisconsin has given us splendid examples 
of this tendency. There is the further tendency 
to legislate in broad general terms, leaving the 
working-out of details to responsible boards and 
commissions. 
It is inexpedient, and probably in the end it will 
prove impossible, to have two kinds of pension 
systems for teachers in operation simultaneously 
in any state. Doubtless for some time we shall 
continue to have the attempt made. It cannot 
be too strongly urged, however, that a beginning 
should be made in any legislation hereafter by in- 
sisting that all new teachers entering the service 
must enter the state retirement system regard- 
less of the operation of any local system. With 
this provision insisted upon, we might then have 
a number of local systems in process of merging; 
that is to say, some teachers in any town or city 
will be prospective beneficiaries of the local sys- 
tem and others of the state system. The teachers 
Sh 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  THE TEACHER AND OLD AGE 
under local systems will gradually work out of 
the service by resignation, death, and retirement, 
and at the close of say thirty years we can expect, 
in any state where this sort of adjustment is 
made, the full operation of a complete state sys- 
tem. 
While the merging process thus indicated is 
going on under the system of taxation prevailing 
in most states, no town or city should be ex- 
empted from taxation to maintain the state sys- 
tem, inasmuch as some of the teachers in every 
town and city in the state would be prospective 
beneficiaries of the plan. It should be borne in 
mind, however, that since many teachers for 
some years will be under a local system, some 
method of equitable reimbursement therefor 
must be worked out, and up to date it would 
seem that the Massachusetts system (see section 
13) proposes the most satisfactory method.
-P-A-G-E-111

SraTE teachers’ pension systems are sure to become 
the rule rather than the exception in this country. 
Nine complete state systems are now in existence, 
four of which were set up during the legislative year 
1912-13. In Connecticut a law was put through the 
legislature but vetoed by the governor. In Michi- 
gan a law was defeated by a narrow margin in the 
senate. In these states, and in at least four others, 
campaigns are now under way looking toward the 
passage of laws at the next session of the legislatures. 
In view of these facts, and also because sufficient 
experience has already accumulated to render cer- 
tain general statements possible and safe, the writer 
considers that this discussion would be incomplete 
without the presentation of the draft of an act for 
the establishment of a teachers’ retirement system 
actually in existence. For this purpose the Massa- 
chusetts Act (1913) has been selected. President 
Pritchett, of the Carnegie Foundation, has pro- 
nounced this “the best and most carefully considered 
law for teachers’ pensions yet proposed in this coun- 
try.” It conforms more clearly than any other to 
the principles heretofore discussed in this study, and 
on the whole marks a step forward in this sort of 
legislation. There are, however, certain defects and 
“danger points” in the law. These, as well as some 
a9)  
-P-A-G-E-112
  APPENDIX 
points of excellence, are briefly discussed in the 
footnotes to the text of the law. 
It is to be hoped that this old-age measure may be 
supplemented by an equally good measure providing 
for retirement for disability before age sixty years. 
The legislature of 1911 directed the Massachusetts 
Board of Education to investigate the matter of 
teachers’ pensions and report on the same, but failed 
to provide any funds for the research work neces- 
sary before any adequate report could be made on 
the health risk, or disability risk, of the teacher. The 
board wisely confined its efforts to the field of an old- 
age pension, in which there are sufficient data and 
experience to justify the enactment of a law.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT 
SYSTEM 
SEcTION 2. A teachers’ retirement system shall be 
established on the first day of July, nineteen hun- 
dred and fourteen. 
TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION 
SEcTION 3. A teachers’ retirement association shall 
be organized among the teachers in the public schools 
as follows: — 
(z) All teachers, except those specified in para~ 
graph (3) of this section, who enter the service of 
the public schools for the first time on or after July 
first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, shall become 
thereby members of the association. 
(2) All teachers, except those specified in para- 
graph (3) of this section, who shall have entered the 
service of the public schools before June thirtieth, 
nineteen hundred and fourteen, may at any time be- 
tween July first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, and 
September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and four- 
teen, upon application in writing to the commis- 
sioner of education, become membersof the retirement

association. Any teacher failing to do so may there- 
after become a member of the retirement board! by 
paying an amount equal to the total assessments, 
together with regular interest thereon, that he would 
have paid if he had joined the retirement associa- 
tion on September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and 
fourteen. 
(3) Teachers in the service of the public schools of 
the city of Boston shall not be included as members 
of the retirement association.” 
STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT BOARD 
SECTION 4. (1) The management of the retirement 
system is hereby vested in the teachers’ retirement 
board, consisting of seven members: the insurance 
commissioner for the commonwealth, the bank com- 
missioner for the commonwealth, the commissioner 
of education for the commonwealth, three members 
of the retirement association and one other person. 
Upon organization of the retirement association the 
members thereof shall elect from among their num- 
1 This is obviously an error, the context requires “associa- 
tion” instead of “board.” 
2 This violates the principle heretofore laid down (11, page 
76, also page 95) that all local pension systems should ulti- 
mately be absorbed into a state system. The Boston act gives 
part pension for disability prior to age sixty-five years; the 
state act does not recognize disability before age sixty years as 
cause for retirement. The Boston teachers were unwilling to 
surrender this right, and in order to get any legislation, this 
provision was necessary.

ber in a manner to be approved by the insurance 
commissioner, the bank commissioner and the com- 
missioner of education, three persons to serve upon 
the retirement board, one member to serve for one 
year, one for two years and one for three years, and 
thereafter the members of the retirement association 
shall elect annually from among their number in a 
manner to be approved by the retirement board one 
person to serve upon the retirement board for the 
term of three years. The seventh member of the re- 
tirement board shall be elected annually by the other 
six to serve for the term of one year.’ On a vacancy 
occurring on the board, a successor of such person 
whose place has become vacant shall be chosen in 
the same manner as his predecessor to serve until the 
next annual election. Until the organization of the 
retirement association and the election of three rep- 
resentatives therefrom, the insurance commissioner, 
the bank commissioner and the commissioner of edu- 
cation shall be empowered to perform the duties of 
the retirement board. 
(2) The members of the retirement board shall 
serve without compensation, but they shall be reim- 
bursed from the expense fund of the retirement asso- 
ciation for any expenditures or loss of salary or wages 
which they may incur through serving on the board. 
All claims for reimbursement on this account shall be 
subject to the approval of the governor and council. 
3 This would have been stronger if provision had been made 
for appointment of the seventh member by the governor, in 
case of failure to elect after a reasonable time. 
104
-P-A-G-E-117
  APPENDIX 
(3) The retirement board shall have power to 
make by-laws and regulations not inconsistent with 
the provisions of this act; and to employ a secretary 
who shall give a bond in such amount as the board 
shall approve, and clerical and other assistance as 
may be necessary.* The salaries shall be fixed by the 
board, with the approval of the governor and council. 
(4) The retirement board shall provide for the 
payment of retirement allowances and such other 
expenditures as are required by the provisions of 
this act. 
(5) The retirement board shall adopt for the re- 
tirement system one or more mortality tables, and 
shall determine what rates of interest shall be estab- 
lished in connection with such tables, and may later 
modify such tables or prescribe other tables to repre- 
sent more accurately the expense of the retirement 
system, or may change such rates of interest, and 
may determine the application of the changes made. 
(6) The retirement board shall perform such 
other functions as are required for the execution of 
the provisions of this act. 
CREATION OF FUNDS 
Section 5. The funds of the retirement system 
shall consist of an expense fund, an annuity fund and 
a pension fund. 
(1) The expense fund shall consist of such amounts 
4 This is an awkward construction, although the meaning is 
probably clear.

as shall be appropriated by the general court from 
year to year on estimates submitted by the retire- 
ment board to defray the expense of the administra- 
tion of this act, exclusive of the payment of retire- 
ment allowances. 
(2) The annuity fund shall consist of assessments 
paid by members of the retirement association, and 
interest derived fom investments of the annuity 
fund. Each member of the retirement association 
shall pay into the annuity fund, by deduction from 
his salary in the manner provided in section nine, 
paragraph five, of this act, such assessments upon 
his salary as may be determined by the retirement 
board. The rate of assessment shall be established 
by the retirement board on the first day of July of 
each year after a prior notice of at least three months, 
and shall at any given time be uniform for all mem- 
bers of the retirement association, and shall not be 
less than three per cent nor more than seven per 
cent of the members’ salary :> provided, however, that 
when the total sum of assessments on the salary of 
any member at the rate established by the retire- 
ment board would amount to more than one hun- 
dred dollars or less than thirty-five dollars® for any 
5 Objection has been raised to this provision. The claim is 
made that the power to fix the assessment rate should not be 
vested in the retirement board. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries 
have a fair representation on the board, there is small danger 
of any unjust or arbitrary misuse of authority. 
6 Thirty payments of thirty-five dollars each will produce 
an annuity of one hundred and fifty dollars at age sixty 
years. Since the pension equals the annuity, every teacher

school year, such member shall in lieu of assessments 
at the regular rate be assessed one hundred dollars 
a year or thirty-five dollars a year as the case may be, 
payable in equal instalments to be assessed for the 
number of months during which the schools of the 
community in which such member is employed are 
commonly in session. Any member of the retire- 
ment association who shall for thirty years have paid 
regular assessments to the annuity fund as provided 
herein, shall be exempt from further assessments; 
but such member may thereafter, if he so elects, con- 
tinue to pay his assessments to the fund. No mem- 
ber so electing shall pay further assessments after the 
total sum of assessments paid by him shall at any 
time have amounted, with regular interest, to a sum 
sufficient to purchase an annuity of five hundred dol- 
lars at age sixty;’ and interest thereafter accruing 
shall be paid to the member at the time of his retire- 
ment. 
(3) The pension fund shall consist of such amounts 
retiring under the terms of the act is practically guaranteed a 
minimum retirement allowance of three hundred dollars. See 
also Section 6, (5). 
7 The amount necessary to yield an annuity of five hundred 
dollars at age sixty years will yield very nearly seven hundred 
and fifty dollars at age seventy years. Hence it will be possible 
for teachers paying the maximum assessments (one hundred 
dollars per annum) for a long term of years to retire on an al- 
lowance of fifteen hundred dollars if they continue in service 
until age seventy years. As an offset to the possible tempta- 
tion to remain in service too long for the sake of building up a 
larger equity, provision is made in Section 6, (1), for retirement 
after age sixty years by the school committee.

PAYMENT OF RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES 
SEcTION 6. (x) Any member of the retirement as- 
sociation may retire from service in the public schools 
on attaining the age of sixty years, or, at any time 
thereafter, if incapable of rendering satisfactory serv- 
ice as a teacher, may, with the approval of the re- 
tirement board, be retired by the employing school 
committee. 
(2) Any member of the retirement association, on 
attaining the age of seventy years, shall be retired 
from service in the public schools. 
(3) A member of the retirement association after 
his retirement under the provisions of paragraphs 
numbered (x) or (2) of this section, shall be entitled 
to receive from the annuity fund, as he shall elect at 
the time of his retirement, on the basis of tables 
adopted by the retirement board: — (a) an annuity 
payable in quarterly payments, to which the sum 
of his assessments under section five, paragraph (2), 
with regular interest thereon, shall entitle him; or,*® 
8 This option is an important feature from an insurance 
standpoint. While it cannot be stated accurately in dollars 
and cents, since it is not known what tables the retirement 
board will adopt, this smaller annuity amounts to about 78-108 
of the full annuity due. The remainder is retained as a pre-

(b) an annuity of less amount; as determined by the 
retirement board for the annuitants electing such 
option, payable in quarterly payments, with the pro- 
vision that if the annuitant dies before receiving 
payments equal to the sum of his assessments under 
section five, paragraph (2), with regular interest, at 
the time of his retirement, the difference between the 
total amount of said payments and the amount of his 
contributions with regular interest shall be paid to 
his legal representatives. 
(4) Any member of the retirement association re- 
ceiving payments of an annuity as provided in para- 
graph numbered (3) of this section shall, if not ren- 
dered ineligible therefor by the provisions of section 
twelve of this act, receive with each quarterly pay- 
ment of his annuity an equal amount to be paid 
from the pension fund as directed by the retirement 
board. 
(5)® Any teacher who shall have become a mem- 
mium, insuring to the heirs the unpaid balances in the annu- 
ity fund. The objectionable feature in this option is the cut- 
ting down of the pension, since the law provides a pension 
equal to the annuity received, paragraph (4). This should be 
amended. 
® This paragraph dealing with teachers now in service is on 
first reading particularly complicated, but careful study will 
show that it fits into the other provisions of the law in a con- 
cise but effective manner. Briefly, it means that a teacher’s 
retirement allowance may be made up of four parts: — 
(a) The annuity yielded by his contributions. 
(6) A pension equal to (a). 
(c) A prior service pension based on what he would have 
received had the act been in force when he entered service.

sion to which he would have been entitled under the 
provisions of this act if he had paid thirty assess-

preceding his retirement and at the rate in effect at 
the time of his retirement: provided, (1), that if his 
term of service in the commonwealth shall have been 
over thirty years the thirty assessments shall be reck-

ice and as drawing regular interest until the time of 
retirement; and further provided, (2) that if the sum

shall be paid to him in four annual instalments. 
10 The withdrawal equities provided for in this section are 
thoroughly sound. Teaching is a short-lived profession. The 
average teaching life in this country is about seven years. Re- 
taining any portion of the teachers’ contributions, as is done in 
most of the teachers’ pension plans now in existence, is build- 
ing up an insurance fund for a few old teachers, largely at the 
expense of the vastly greater number of young teachers who 
will never become pensionable.

(3) If such withdrawal shall take place after ten 
annual assessments have been paid the amount so 
refunded shall be in the form of such annuity for life 
based on the contributions of such member, together 
with regular interest thereon, as may be determined 
by the retirement board according to its annuity 
tables, or in four annual instalments, as such member 
may elect. 
(4) If a member of the association withdrawing 
and receiving payments in accordance with para- 
graphs numbered (2) and (3) of this section, shall 
die before the amount of such payments equals the 
amount of his contributions to the annuity fund with 
regular interest, the difference between the amount 
of such payments and the amount of his contribu- 
tions with regular interest shall be paid to his legal 
representatives. 
(5) Any member of the retirement association 
who shall have withdrawn from service in the pub- 
lic schools shall, on being re-employed in the public 
schools, be reinstated in the retirement association 
in accordance with such plans for reinstatement as 
the retirement board shall adopt." 
(6) Ifa member of the retirement association shall 
die before retirement, the full amount of his contri- 
butions to the annuity fund with regular interest to 
the day of his death shall be paid to his legal repre- 
sentatives. 
11 While it may be good policy not to legislate in advance of 
known conditions, this provision opens the way for some differ- 
ences and possible litigation.

TAXATION, ATTACHMENTS AND ASSIGNMENTS 
Section 8. That portion of the salary or wages of 
a member deducted or to be deducted under this act, 
the right of a member to an annuity or pension, and 
all his rights in the funds of the retirement system 
shall be exempt from taxation, and from the opera- 
tion of any laws relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, 
and shall not be attached or taken upon execution 
or other process of any court. No assignment of any 
right in, or to, said funds shall be valid. The funds 
of the retirement system, so far as invested in per- 
sonal property, shall be exempt from taxation. 
DUTIES OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE |? 
SECTION 9. (1) The school committee of each town 
and city in the commonwealth shall, before employ- 
ing in any teaching position any person to whom this 
act may apply, notify such person of his duties and 
obligations under this act as a condition of his em- 
ployment. 
(2) On or before October first of each year the 
12 No penalty is attached for nonperformance of the duties 
prescribed in this section. States having any considerable 
amount of money to disburse as aid for schools will do well to 
make the receipt of such money contingent upon the proper 
discharge of these as well as other duties prescribed by law. 
Compared with most other states, Massachusetts distributes 
little and lacks this effective method of control. Experience in 
Massachusetts justifies the prediction that considerable trou- 
ble will arise in enforcing the provisions of this section, which 
can be avoided in many other states.

school committee of each town and city in the com- 
monwealth shall certify to the retirement board the 
names of all teachers to whom this act shall apply. 
(3) The school committee of each town and city 
in the commonwealth shall, on the first day of each 
calendar month, notify the retirement board of the 
employment of new teachers, removals, withdrawals, 
changes in salary of teachers, that shall have occurred 
during the month preceding. 
(4) Under the direction of the retirement board 
the school committee of each town or city in the 
commonwealth shall furnish such other information 
as the board may require relevant to the discharge of 
the duties of the board. 
(5) The school committee of each town and city 
in the commonwealth shall, as directed by the retire- 
ment board, deduct from the amount of the salary 
due each teacher employed in the public schools of 
such city or town such amounts as are due as con- 
tributions to the annuity fund as prescribed in this 
act, shall send to the treasurer of said town or city 
a statement as voucher for such deductions, and shall 
send a duplicate statement to the secretary of the 
retirement board. 
(6) The school committee of each town and city 
in the commonwealth shall keep such records as the 
retirement board may require.

specified in such voucher to the secretary of the re- 
tirement board. 
(2) The secretary of the retirement board shall 
monthly pay to the treasurer of the commonwealth 
all sums collected by him under the provisions of 
paragraph (r1).

shall be in the form prescribed by the retirement 
board and approved by the insurance commissioner. 
MEMBERSHIP IN OTHER RETIREMENT ASSOCIATIONS 
SECTION 12. (1) No person Tequired to become a 
member of the association, under the provisions of 
paragraph (r) of section three of this act shall be 
entitled to participate in the benefits of any other 
teachers’ retirement system, supported in whole or 
in part by funds raised by taxation, or to a pension 
under the provisions of chapter four hundred and 
ninety-eight of the acts of the year nineteen hundred 
and eight, or chapter five hundred and eighty-nine 
of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and eight, 
as amended by chapter six hundred and seventeen 
of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and ten. 
(2) No member of the retirement association shall 
be eligible to receive any pension as described in sec- 
tion six of this act, who is at the time in receipt of a 
pension paid from funds raised in whole or in part

and eighty-nine of the acts of the year nineteen hun- 
dred and eight, as amended by chapter six hundred 
and seventeen of the acts of the year nineteen hun- 
dred and ten, or of any other act providing pensions 
for teachers, providing that this paragraph shall not 
be construed as applying to the Boston Teachers’ 
Retirement Fund Association. 
REIMBURSEMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS !% 
SECTION 13. (1) Whenever, after the first day of 
July, nineteen hundred and fourteen, a town or city 
retires a teacher who is not eligible to a pension under 
the provisions of section six, paragraph (4) of this 
act, and pays to such teacher a pension in accord- 
ance with chapter four hundred and ninety-eight of 
the acts of the year nineteen hundred and eight, or 
chapter five hundred and eighty-nine of the acts of 
the year nineteen hundred and eight, as amended by 
18 The method of reimbursement here provided is modeled 
on the law for reimbursement for industrial schools. It was 
doubtless the best method for getting legislation in 1913, but 
since, in connection with Section 15, it permits the indefinite 
continuance of local pension schemes, it can be commended 
only as a workable compromise. Such compromises have to 
be made in the initial stages of social welfare legislation and 
are justifiable as temporary expedients rather than permanent 
solutions. Other states will do well to study carefully the work- 
ings of this plan in Massachusetts.

  APPENDIX 
chapter six hundred and seventeen of the acts of the 
year nineteen hundred and ten, and the school com- 
mittee of said town or city certifies under oath to the 
retirement board to the amount of said pension, said 
town or city shall be reimbursed therefor annually 
by the commonwealth: provided, that no such reim- 
bursement shall be in excess of the amount, as deter- 
mined by the retirement board, to which said teacher 
would have been entitled as a pension, had he become 
a member of the retirement association under the 
provisions of section three, paragraph (2) of this 
act. 
(2) On or before the first Wednesday of January of 
each year, the retirement board shall present to the 
general court a statement of the amount expended 
previous to the preceding first day of July by cities 
and towns in the payment of pensions under the pro- 
visions of the preceding paragraph, for which such 
cities and towns should receive reimbursement. On 
the basis of such a statement, the general court may 
make an appropriation for the reimbursement of such 
cities and towns up to such first day of July. 
JURISDICTION OF COURT 
SEcTIoN 14. The superior court shall have juris- 
diction in equity upon petition of the insurance com- 
missioner or of any interested party to compel the 
observance and restrain the violation of this act, and 
of the rules and regulations established by the retire- 
ment board hereunder.

APPENDIX 
REFERENDUM AND REPEAL 
SECTION 15. Upon the petition of not less than five 
per cent of the legal voters of any city or town that 
has adopted chapter four hundred and ninety-eight 
of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and eight, 
this question shall be submitted, in case of a city, to 
the voters of such city at the next city election, and, 
in case of a town, to the voters of such town at the 
next annual town meeting, and the vote shall be in 
answer to the question to be placed upon the ballot: 
“Shall an act passed by the general court in the year 
nineteen hundred and eight, entitled ‘An Act to 
authorize cities and towns to establish pension funds 
for teachers in the public schools,’ be repealed?” 
and if a majority of the voters voting thereon at such 
election or meeting shall vote in the affirmative, said 
act shall be repealed in such city or town. 
SrctTIon 16. Somuch of chapter four hundred and 
ninety-eight of the acts of the year nineteen hundred 
and eight as authorizes its submission to the voters 
of a city or town for acceptance after the passage of 
this act is hereby repealed.!4 
SEcTION 17. This act shall take effect upon its 
Passage. Approved June 19, 1913. 
414 This refers to the permissive act of 1908, allowing towns 
and cities by referendum vote to pension teachers. Although 
in 1913 it had been adopted by eleven communities, it was 
found to be an unsatisfactory method of retiring teachers even 
in those places, and entirely unworkable in many sections of 
the state.

The Wisconsin Teachers’ Pension Law of rgr11 has 
not been discussed in this monograph, because of the 
uncertainty that prevails regarding the final outcome 
of that act. The writer is informed that “a strong 
effort is being made for the repeal of the law.” 
When the system was established, all teachers 
except teachers in the city of Milwaukee were per- 
mitted to join the retirement association. On and 
after June 12, 1911, all new teachers were compelled 
to join. There is no requirement as to age, but 
twenty-five years’ service, eighteen of which must 
134

have been in the state, are required for retirement. 
A teacher may retire if incapacitated any time after 
eighteen full years’ service in the state. Quarterly 
payments are made on an annuity at the rate of 
$12.50 per year for each year of service, not exceed- 
ing $450. Teachers of less than ten years of service 
pay one per cent of their salary into the annuity 
fund. Teachers of over ten years’ service pay two 
per cent. The state annually adds, from the school 
mill tax, ten cents for each person of school age in the 
state. The fund may be augmented by gifts, legacies, 
and accumulated interest. Management is vested in 
a board of five trustees, consisting of three members 
elected by prospective beneficiaries, the state treas- 
urer and the state superintendent of instruction. 
No retirement age is prescribed. The annuity con- 
stitutes a service pension. If the teacher withdraws 
from service, he receives one half the amount paid 
in. No provision is made for any refunds in case of 
death,

PREFACE 
The judge, in awful ermine, on the bench; the 
jury, glowering, in its box; the prisoner, THE BOOK, 
in the dock: enter in humility, the attorney for the 
defense, THE PREFACE. 
“What excuse for existence has the prisoner? ” 
thunders the judge in tones that make the culprit’s 
leaves shake. 
In cringing deference, the attorney for the de- 
fense falters, “‘ None, your lordship, none, but . . .” 
Such is the scene that many prefaces suggest. 
This preface, however, is different—and quite 
shameless. It says, merely, that the title “ Debat- 
ing for Boys” carries its own statement of its reason 
for being. Boys like to debate; debating will do 
them good. This volume is a simple, unpretentious 
manual designed to help boys to debate efficiently 
—to get from the most manly of all sports, and a 
royal sport it is, all of the pleasure and profit it has 
to offer. The book is designed, first of all, as an aid 
to the boy himself —in home, club, school, church 
— and, also, as an aid to the father, club director, 
teacher, clergyman, all, in fact, who are his friends 
and advisers.

  DEBATING FOR BOYS 
CHAPTER I 
WHY BOYS SHOULD DEBATE 
For two reasons I am going to discuss with you 
the theories of debating. 
In the first place, the debate of the boys’ club, 
of the school society, or of the city lyceum, is the 
same in form and method as the debates in legis- 
lature or Congress. Any lad who is trained to de- 
bate, who knows his subject, who is logical and 
direct, who is frightened neither at his own voice 
nor of his opponent’s ability, will later in life be able 
to meet an opponent in the larger halls of the capital. 
He will find it no different in Washington than it 
was in the village school—his audience will be 
larger and his judges different but the rules govern- 
ing his thought and its expression will be the same. 
In the second place, when he is effectively trained 
in debate, he is also completely equipped for the 
more informal thought and discussion which is his 
daily habit. When from his study and practice of 
debating, he knows something of logic, something . |

of the ordinary rules of evidence, something of the 
organization of an argument, he will be impatient 
and intolerant of weak and jointless talk, even in in- 
formal discussion. Every one has overheard in 
crowds talk which has passed for argument but has 
been as formless as a jelly-fish — merely talk. It 
began nowhere and ended nowhere. So I propose 
to discuss debating because it will prepare you 
for the highest responsibilities which may be placed 
upon you, while at the same time it will equip you 
for the everyday duties of active boyhood and later 
manhood. 
Purpose of Debating—Remember then that de- 
bate is simply the spoken argument presented for- 
mally ; what is its purpose? 
The answer is, not to beat the other side, but to 
get at the facts. 
Now in some games, although of course it is of 
prime importance that the contest be manly and the 
sport clean, there is a distinct value in the strife 
itself and victory is sought for its own sake; the 
element of right or wrong does not enter into the 
question at all, There is no right or wrong to it. 
But in debate the purpose is not to win at any cost; 
not to confuse the opponent, nor to trick him, but 
to win by absolute strength of argument — to pre- 
sent such argument as will show the facts. In de- 
bates the truth is wanted—not necessarily the 
decision, the victory. For the purpose and object of 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
WHY BOYS SHOULD DEBATE 5 
debate is to determine upon some course of action, 
to arrive at some decision; it is a poor sort of victory 
which secures a decision at the expense of facts. 
For example, suppose that you are a Boy Scout 
and that your patrol has decided upon a hike to Mt. 
Rainier. The first question to discuss and settle will 
be the best route to take. Jack Prentice may know 
the way absolutely, but may not be nearly so fluent 
a talker as Frank Gordon, who with very little 
knowledge of the proposed hike, could easily silence 
poor Jack in the discussion. 
What will be the effect of Frank’s victory, if he 
gains it? If Jack is made to look ridiculous in dis- 
cussion, if he loses his presence of mind and so 
stammers over his statements that his fellow Scouts 
lose patience and take Frank’s more fluent speech 
for fact and adopt his proposed route, what will it 
all avail if they take the wrong road? Will it 
not be a hollow victory in the end? And will his 
victory add to Frank’s reputation, although his fel- 
lows may be very willing to admit his cleverness? 
Will not that very cleverness make them all the 
more unwilling to trust his future arguments, when 
they remember this failure? 
- Qn the other hand what about Jack? Is our only 
feeling toward him one of sympathy? No, he 
should have trained his powers, he should have 
early “ found himself” so that he would not fall 
an easy victim to mere cleverness. In other words,
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 DEBATING FOR BOYS 
Frank is responsible for the use he made of his 
powers, and Jack is responsible for the use he did 
not make of his. If the patrol got caught off the 
road on the hike, I imagine they would blame both 
Frank and Jack about equally. 
Debate Must Lead to Action.—Now you may not 
at first see the parallel between a debate on the best 
route for a proposed hike and a general debate on 
conservation, forexample. Both, however, are really 
governed by the same rules and their purpose and 
object is the same. In the plans for your hike, you 
proposed to do something, to go somewhere; if the 
question of conservation is up for discussion it is 
with some definite end in view, not simply as an 
excuse for general talk about it. The discussion 
which does not lead to a definite plan of action is 
not truly argument. If after your audience, 
whether it is your patrol, your debating club, or 
later your legislature, has listened to you, it says 
* What a fine speech!” you have failed. The audi- 
ence should be convinced to the point of action. 
Demosthenes said to his rival, “ When the Atheni- 
ans listen to you they say ‘ What a fine speech!’ 
When they hear me they say, ‘ Let’s go fight against 
Philip.’ ”’ So any argument, and debate, must con- 
vince the hearers that the facts are as claimed, that 
the deductions based upon these facts are sound and 
that the course advised is correct. Finally and 
supremely, it must lead somewhere; it must have a
-P-A-G-E-15
WHY BOYS SHOULD DEBATE 7 
definite plan to propose and must lead the hearers to 
follow that plan. 
Benefits to the Individual.—If, then, the purpose 
of debate is to get at the facts and to determine the 
proper action to be taken with reference to those 
facts, what are the benefits of debate to the debater 
himself? They are many and varied. 
Training in Self-Control.tIn the first place, 
there is the training in self-control which comes to 
the debater. Sometimes one can face a physical 
emergency with fortitude when he shrinks from a 
situation which calls for no physical pluck at all. 
Only a few years ago a famous Harvard football 
player who had been the mainstay of his team in 
many a scrimmage actually fainted away when he 
first attempted to take part in a debate. When he 
was revived he was so disgusted with himself that 
he insisted on trying again, and he did, after a 
fashion, go through his part in the debate. Morti- 
fied at his failure, he persisted in as strenuous a 
course in his debating class as ever had been imposed 
upon him by his football coach. He won, and be- 
came one of Harvard’s star debaters. You see, the 
physical self-control he had acquired on the gridiron 
was not available to him in debate; but it is the skill 
in debate which is now helping him in after life— 
not necessarily his football prowess. 
Training to Meet Emergencies.— You will learn 
how to meet emergencies if you become skillful in
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 DEBATING FOR BOYS 
debate. Most of us can frame a fair argument if 
we can sit quietly down and think it out with no one 
to bother us. But to be able to control and com- 
mand your resources so that they are ready for 
quick action — that is a different ability — an abil- 
ity that work in debating will give you. If Jack 
has studied out his question he may be able 
to give a very strong argument for it. But suppose 
Frank is there to ask Jack questions or to suggest 
measures contrary to those he is advocating. Jack is 
likely to lose in his argument unless he has so pre- 
pared himself that Frank’s counter arguments have 
already been considered and provided for. You 
will see that it is not enough to have arguments — 
you must have them ready for use. It is a good 
deal like a camping equipment; it will not aid you in 
the woods if it is packed away at home. This pre- 
paredness, as far as argument is concerned, debating 
will teach you. 
Knowing — Not Doing.— You know education 
is a process of preparing a man to get the most out 
of himself and the most out of life. In many cases, 
however, a boy knows a great deal but can do but 
very little. I have known boys who could tell you 
all about the various methods of signaling since 
Gideon trained his troop of warriors; yet, if you 
should ask these boys, they couldn’t actually send 
the simplest message. They know, but they can not 
do. Now the training in meeting emergencies
-P-A-G-E-17
  WHY BOYS SHOULD DEBATE 9 
which debating gives a boy, lays the emphasis on 
quick decision, but above all on quick decision that 
means action. 
This training in self-control which practice in 
debating gives is invaluable in after life. When 
the boy, for instance, is after a job, if he has self- 
control he will be able to face his possible employer 
with courage and to put up the front he is entitled 
to show. The timid boy, however, will probably 
be unable to present his claims in a fashion that 
shows their merit. Many other such cases will 
occur to any of you. 
Debating Forms Habits of Correct Speech.— 
Next to its value in training for self-control, prac- 
tice in debating is valuable in the formation of cor- 
rect habits of speech. I do not mean the “ fine 
writing ’”’ we recognize so easily, which .is some- 
times beautiful but more often only funny. I mean 
that direct English which aims to say certain things 
in the simplest fashion and in the fewest words. 
Never to use a long word when a short one will ex- 
press the exact meaning, never to use a foreign 
word or a word of foreign derivation when a plain 
Saxon word will do—a few such rules as these 
will soon form a clear clean style, and no drill 
equals the debate for the recognition of this style 
or its opposite, huge bombastic statement. 
Haven’t you noticed how much worse a poor sen- 
tence sounds than it looks? It is like comparing
-P-A-G-E-18
10 DEBATING FOR BOYS 
cannon balls with toy balloons—they may look 
about the same size and may have the same general 
appearance but to use them — well, I would rather 
juggle with toy balloons than with cannon balls but 
the cannon balls would surely be the more reliable 
in an argument; which do you think would carry 
the most weight? 
You surely recognize a clear exact style when 
you hear it, and you surely recognize slovenly care- 
less speech when you hear it. Now you can’t in 
debate have a clean clear style if you haven’t a 
clean cut incisive argument—if you haven't. 
thought your subject through. And on the con- 
trary, your very work thinking your argument out 
will strengthen your style and simplify your speech. 
Matters so ordinary as grammar and pronunciation 
will unconsciously correct themselves when you hear 
your own voice either gracing or disgracing your 
thought. Your vocabulary will be enlarged, your 
diction clarified, and, on the physical side, your ar- 
ticulation will be clearer and more distinct; you will 
learn to stand squarely on both feet and not wander 
aimlessly about or sway as if blown upon by con- 
tending breezes. You see, if you think a moment, 
that every one of these things, so important to you 
whether as boy or man, is drilled into you by prac- 
tice in debate. 
Debating Means Constructive Thinking.— In the 
next place, not only is practice in debate invaluable 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
WHY BOYS SHOULD DEBATE 11 
in acquiring self-control and correct habits of 
speech, but also it teaches you to organize your own 
powers; it drills you in constructive thinking. In 
much of your school work, you learn and recite the 
words of others—either of teachers or of text- 
book writers. But if a subject for debate is pro-' 
posed, you must think it out yourself. For ex- 
ample, if some such question is proposed for your 
debate as: “‘ Is the conservation of the timber supply 
of the United States wise?” you at once must by 
your own independent thinking prepare your argu- 
ment. Your teacher or other friends will aid you but 
you must work it out yourself. You will first ask 
yourself what you mean and what is meant generally 
by “ conservation ”’ ; you will then ask where and how 
much the same policy has been tried in other coun- 
tries, why it should be tried here and what results 
may be reasonably expected to follow the policy 
here. You catalogue the reasons for and against 
the proposed policy and weigh the moral questions 
involved, if any. You limit the question within its 
proper bounds — in short you build up the structure 
of your argument much as you would build a signal 
tower. You see that your foundations are properly 
laid and that every upright and brace is properly 
placed and jointed. 
Debaters Can Detect False Reasoning.—Then 
when you have found yourself, when you have ac- 
quired mastery of yourself, of your manner and of
-P-A-G-E-20
  (2° DEBATING FOR BOYS 
your argument, practice in debating has an addi- 
tional value still greater. You will learn to recog- 
nize sound reasoning wherever you hear it and will 
detect the false with equal ease. Without conscious 
effort on your part, you will apply to the casual 
argument as you meet it, to the public address, to 
the written article, to the newspaper editorial, those 
standards by which you have built up your own ar- 
gument. It will be difficult for you to overlook 
inconsistency and false reasoning, for your mind 
will have become accustomed to exact and clear 
thinking — your habits of mind will have become 
standardized, as the factory expert would say.

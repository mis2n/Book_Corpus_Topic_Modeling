FOREWORD 
I should never have thought of writing 
this book had I not been urged to do so. 
For years it has been my privilege to lec- 
ture before teachers’ institutes and associa- 
tions. One of the lectures that has seemed 
to have special value is entitled Personality. 
At the request of friends who have heard 
the lecture I have enlarged its scope and 
am giving it to the public. 
Its matter is old; so is the multiplication 
table. But there are always the young 
among us, to whom the common wisdom of 
the world is new. To such I trust this book 
may be of some service. 
I desire to express, my obligation to Prof. 
C. E. Patzer, of the Milwaukee Normal 
School, for reading the book in proof.

THE 
PERSONALITY OF THE TEACHER 
CHAPTER I 
THE TONE OF THE SCHOOL 
‘‘All Gaul is divided into three parts,” 
are the famous, words with which Cesar 
begins his Commentary on the Gallic Wars; 
words famous because they have been the 
introduction of generations of boys and girls 
to Latin literature. By changing a single 
word, this famous sentence is a good intro- 
duction to my theme, The Tone of the School. 
The sentence will then read, ‘‘ All psychol- 
ogy is divided into three parts.’? These 
parts are called intellect, sensibility, and 
will—or, knowing, feeling, and willing. This 
simply means that all our mental operations 
may be classified under these three heads.

12 The Personality 
Now, like ancient Gaul, these provinces 
of psychology are not everywhere equally 
explored and known. There are, to be sure, 
broad, well-paved highways running through 
them which are easily traveled; but these 
soon change to dirt roads and these in turn 
to bridle-paths and trails; the trails soon 
become less clearly marked, and the traveler 
finds himself at last in the gloom of the 
forest of primeval ignorance. If you will 
examine any text on general, psychology you 
will find that much more space is given to 
the treatment of the intellect than to sensi- 
bility and will; and the reason for it lies in 
the fact that we know more about the 
intellect. 
We have a considerable knowledge of 
sensation, perception, memory, imagination 
and thinking; but our knowledge of the great 
provinces of sensibility and will is most un- 
satisfactory. Feelings of joy and sorrow, 
love and hate, liking and aversion, defeat 
and victory, depression and buoyance, glad-

ness and sadness, not to mention a score of 
less definable moods, take possession of our 
spirits. These emotional states are most 
difficult to trap and study. They are ex- 
tremely elusive. They are like the Irish- 
man’s flea, when you put your finger where 
they are, they are not there.. Dr. G. Stanley 
Hall has called the feelings the Darkest 
Africa of Psychology. 
Our limited knowledge of the great field 
of the sensibilities is no measure of their 
importance. hey are in fact the most 
fundamentally potential elements in our life. 
Touch an open clam and note how quickly 
it will close. Touch a caterpillar and observe 
how quickly it will curl up. No thought, no 
imagination, yet there is most definite and 
appropriate action. Sensation and action 
are immediately related. Action is auto- 
matic. Itis ‘‘Tetch an’ go,’’ as Uncle Remus 
puts it. This isa characteristic of all animal 
behavior. To be sure, the higher animals 
have a rudimentary type of reasoning, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
14 The Personality 
even with the highest forms Uncle Remus’s 
characterization largely will hold good—it is 
“Tetch an’ go.’? Now, what guides this 
automatic action, so far as it is guided at 
all, is a feeling of pleasure or pain. A pleas- 
urable feeling means to the animal health 
and life; a painful feeling, unhealth and 
death. 
Feeling is then the first guide to action, 
but it is clear that it is not a very safe guide. 
A worm may taste good to a fish, but there 
may be a hook hidden within it. The cheese. 
smells good to the mouse, but there is a trap 
to avoid. When no thought guides action, 
action must often be harmful and destruc- 
tive; so gradually, in response to the law of 
evolution, animal forms which paused before 
acting came into existence. This gave a 
place for memory of past experiences and 
for thought as to what action would be best. 
As ages passed by, animals with greater 
power of inhibiting action came into exist- 
ence and more and more memory and 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
    
Of the Teacher 15 
thought intervened between sensation and 
the act. 
In all animals below man, feeling is yet 
the supreme guide to action. With man 
reason is supposed to sit on the throne and 
direct conduct, and yet-.we have only to 
examine ourselves a bit to discover that 
after all, with us, as with the lower animals, 
feeling is the mainspring of conduct, Our 
loves, our hates, our likes and dislikes, our 
joys and sorrows, and our less definable emo- 
tional states, are the hidden springs, often 
unsuspected, of our behavior.) Why did you 
not go to church on Sunday? You did not 
have a new hat. Why did you remain away 
from the party last week? Miss H.   
was 
there, and you dislike her. Why did you 
refuse an introduction to Miss L——? You 
do not like her father’s politics. Why do 
you dislike Mr. Brown? You don’t know 
why, but you don’t like him. The sole 
answer to the why of many of our likes and 
dislikes is in the quaint stanza: 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  
16 The Personality 
  I do not like you, Doctor Fell, 
The reason why I cannot tell; 
But this at least I know full well, 
I do not like you, Doctor Fell, 
Thus we see our conduct, from the mat- 
ter of attending a party to the matter of 
worship, is dominated by our feelings. If 
we look a little closer we shall find that an 
object or an idea has no power to make 
us act till a feeling is associated with it. A 
dish of fruit has stood by you for hours 
as you read and you have not touched it, 
but suddenly you reach out and take an 
apple. A slight feeling of hunger has made 
the apple an object of desire. Feeling has 
attached itself to the object, apple, and you 
act. A desire is an object or idea to’ 
which a feeling of a certain type has 
attached itself.. If we carefully study our 
actions, we shall find that they are impelled 
by various kinds of feelings, such as desire 
and aversion. |The sharp difference between 
the conduct of man and the conduct of 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
Of the Teacher 17 
  animals lies in the fact that superior intelli- 
gence and conscience influence our feelings, 
i. e. help determine what is desirable and 
what is not. Our behavior and animal be- 
havior are alike in this, that both have their 
mainspring in feelings and emotions. That 
feeling is necessary to initiate action is 
known to the orator, the poet, the preacher, 
the actor, the artist. 
If we adults are so largely controlled 
in our daily conduct by the state of our 
feeling, how much more is it true of child- 
hood. The child is near the animal stage 
of life; he is a creature of feeling; his 
power of reflection and of self-control are 
relatively weak; he is a plaything of ‘‘moods 
and tenses.’’ As a result, the emotional 
character of the environment in which he 
is placed has supreme control over his con- 
duct, and this leads us directly to our theme, 
The Emotional Tone of the School. 
The most vital and determining quality 
of a school is its tone or. atmosphere— 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  
18 The Personality 
  the spirit which pervades it. You may 
strike the same note on a tin pan that a 
violinist sounds on his instrument, but what 
a difference in quality! Yet the difference 
is no greater than may be noticed between 
two schoolrooms presided over by teachers 
of different temperament but equally well 
disposed. 
Now the emotional tone of the school 
has a direct relation to the intellectual work 
of the school—the getting of knowledge and 
power by the children. A proper attitude 
towards one’s task quickens every faculty. 
The eyes are keener, memory more tena- 
cious, thought more alert and sure-footed 
and the imagination stronger-winged when 
we feel in sympathy with our work; and on 
the other hand all our soul-powers droop 
and fall, weak-kneed and nerveless, when 
we have no heart in our task. 
I have seen schools where the air was 
charged with intellectual ozone and even the 
dullest pupil felt the vivifying influence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  Of the Teacher 19 
Every one was intense and alert to the busi- 
ness of the hour. Everything was worth 
while. There was no need of fireworks nor 
birches nor caustic tongue to keep the chil- 
dren at their work. Boys killing bumble 
bees were never more eager and absorbed 
than were these children in arithmetic and 
geography. Under such conditions the mind 
leaps joyfully to its labors. Fellow teacher, 
you have known such days and even such 
weeks. Have you not sometimes, perhaps 
too frequently, experienced days and weeks 
of the opposite character; days when in- 
tellectual enterprise was dead; when all the 
imps of mischief seemed to have entered into 
the minds of your children; when the very 
atmosphere of the schoolroom seemed instinct 
with idleness, mischief and rebellion? Even 
your best and most trusted children caught 
the contagion of idleness and unrest. “On 
such days little progress was made. One 
week of school when the right tone pervades
-P-A-G-E-18
    
20 The Personality 
the atmosphere is worth a month when the 
spirits of sloth and mischief are abroad. 
Tone and Moral Growth 
Important as is the emotional attitude of 
the child towards his reading, writing and 
arithmetic, a thousand fold more important 
is his attitude towards the problems of right 
and wrong he has to meet. | You may spank 
the table of 9’s into a boy’s mind, and you 
may even spank the golden rule into the 
boy’s memory, but you can’t spank the golden 
rule into his heart, and unless it is in his 
heart, it is useless as a-principle of action. 
The secret of the moral training of | 
dren is to get them to want to do the right. 
‘Once make right conduct an object of desire, 
a thing to be sought, and the moral safety 
of a boy or girl is assured. The right 
must be made attractive. I do not mean by 
this that the deed itself must be attractive, 
but the doing of it must seem to the boy’s 
moral nature more desirable than the not
-P-A-G-E-19
    
Of the Teacher 21 
doing. A boy may hate a task in grammar 
and yet he may feel that he would rather do 
this disagreeable task than weakly and sneak- 
ingly ‘shirk it. 
{ That person is a great moral leader who 
can maké the right seem beautiful and 
worthy of supreme effort. Jesus had such 
power in a supreme degree. Beecher, 
Brooks, Spurgeon, Wesley had such power. 
Such men are great moral energizers. They 
quicken the moral purpose and steady the 
wills of all who come within the radius of 
‘ their influence. It is not what such men 
say,—it is more the atmospheric condition 
that they induce which works moral regen- 
eration. It is not. the rules of conduct 
which a teacher lays down for her children / 
| 
that will save them,—it is rather the ideals | N: 
of conduct which she leads them to love and 
desire, for life is not guided by the cold 
concepts that we hold in memory, but by , 
the warm pulsing sentiments and emotions / 
that live in the heart.

22 The Personality 
Influence of Environment on Conduct 
Enthusiasms, as well as the measles, are 
infectious. It seems impossible for the 
average human being to resist the contagion 
of examples and ideals whatever their char- 
acter. A friend of mine, upright and singu- 
larly free from vices, on aecount of his 
business, spent part of his time in a quiet, 
moral, church-going city and part in a town 
with less exacting standards. He confessed 
to me that the change from one place to the 
other always brought on a moral readjust- 
ment. The very atmosphere induced a moral 
change. When in Rome it was so easy to 
do what the Roman did. 
The psychology of the mob is simply the 
psychology of suggestion and imitation. It 
sweeps reason and conscience from the 
throne and puts the scepter in the hand of 
passion. Professor Ross in his ‘‘Social 
Psychology’? has shown that many of the 
extravagant religious revivals, so-called, 
were due not so much to depth of conviction 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
    
Of the Teacher 23 
as to emotional susceptibility. Many a war 
has been fought because governments were 
reluctantly swept on by the passion of the 
populace. <A financial panic is often brought 
on by the same cause. Fads and fancies and 
fashions in dress and manner and thought 
pass over the country affecting and infect- 
ing all classes of people more or less, because 
of human susceptibility to suggestion. 
This law of susceptibility is a blessing 
as well as a curse, for though it gives us the 
mob, it also gives us revivals of morality, 
honesty and decency. We should recognize 
this law and utilize it in our work and teach- 
ing by creating a school tone that will stimu- 
late every good impulse in the heart of 
childhood. 
Necessary Elements 
But what should the tone of the school be 
like? Can we be more specific in describing 
it? For the sake of our younger brethren 
in the profession let me try. In the first
-P-A-G-E-22
    
24 ‘The Personality 
place, the tone of the school should be one 
of mutual respect and affection between 
teacher and pupils. Socrates once sent a 
boy home to his father with the message, 
“T can teach him nothing, he does not love 
me.’’ Many another teacher might well do 
the same, for there can never be the best 
moral and intellectual results in a school 
where the teacher is disliked. Severity and 
force can never stimulate the mental ener- 
gies so well as kindness and genuine regard. 
It is my observation that students gen- 
erally do the most work for the teachers 
whom they like.)) When a pupil forms a dis- 
like for his teacher his work is likely to fall 
off and he is inclined to spend his time in 
mischief or sulking rather than upon his 
lessons. He will neglect his tasks just to 
tease and vex the teacher. Once let a recon- 
_ Giliation take place and regard supplant ill- 
will, and there comes a transformation in 
his attitude towards his work. His percent- 
age comes up with a bound, and the lessons
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  Of the Teacher 25 
  which he shirked before he now takes hold 
of with earnestness and avidity. School 
boards are right in not retaining a teacher 
who has lost the good-will of his pupils, for 
good-will is essential to good work. 
I am aware that there are. enough excep- 
tions to this rule to lead some one to chal- 
lenge my position. There is Miss Easy, who 
is sweet and lovable and who never fails to 
win the affection of her pupils, but she is 
lax in discipline, uncertain in scholarship, 
and generally slow and indefinite in her 
teaching. She wins love but does not impart 
learning. And there is Miss Stern, who cer- 
tainly is not lovable, and if loving, no one 
has made the discovery, who never has the 
affection of her pupils, but in spite of that 
fact. secures most admirable results. She 
imparts learning but does not win love. 
Now certainly Miss Stern is a better teacher 
than Miss Easy. Possibly here is a choice 
between two evils. May we not avoid both 
by finding a teacher who not only wins the 
Pfam,  
-P-A-G-E-24
    
26 The Personality 
  
affection of her pupils but effectively teaches 
the subjects of the curriculum? 
The Tone of Cheerful Industry 
The tone of the school should be one of 
cheerful industry. In all ages men have 
thought it should be a place of industry, but 
only in our day has it come to be generally 
believed that the industry should be cheer- 
ful. The old-time theology made heaven 
hard to win, and the old-time school made 
knowledge hard to gain. The child went to 
school to prepare for life. He must study 
the things he would use by and by. If they 
were difficult and repulsive, no matter, they 
were needful, and the hardship of mastering 
them would toughen him for life’s exigencies. 
Then came the awakening :—Pestalozzi and 
Rousseau and Froebel and their disciples 
proclaiming that the child has a right to 
his life now; that to-day is worthy of con- 
sideration; thatte-merrew—is—built on to- 
day; that a child’s life should be happy even 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
    
Of the Teacher 27 
  
in school; that such a childhood is ; + best 
preparation for useful manhood. 
A teacher who cannot make the —i0ol a 
pleasure to children is not a succéss; he is 
wrong or someone else is wrong. It may be 
the superintendent is exacting more work 
than can well be accomplished. It may be 
the texts are beyond the comprehension of 
the children. That some one is blundering 
is beyond doubt. There should be no place 
in an American school for a gloomy, un- 
happy childhood. In pleading for a happy 
childhood I am not pleading for an idle one. 
The school is a place for industry; there are 
things to be done; but these things can be 
best done in a school where a joyful eager- 
ness spurs the children on. 
The Tone of Victory 
The tone of the school should be one of 
victory. The school should be a place where 
children fight and win intellectual and moral 
battles. It must not be a place of intel-

1 and moral defeats. ‘‘I have taught 
years in the schools at L——,’’ said 
=———ht teacher to me the other day, ‘‘and 
30 » never yet had a class pass the 
  nation sent out by the superintend- 
The Again some one had blundered— 
ascher or superintendent. ‘‘You cannot 
@nduct a successful school on a regimen of 
failures,’’ said Dr. B. A. Hinsdale, years 
ago, and it will always remain true. We 
have but to compare the relative effects of 
defeat and victory in our own lives to see 
the significance of Dr. Hinsdale’s statement, 
but if further evidence is needed it may be 
had with little seeking. 
The most hopelessly defeated man in all 
the world is the one who has lost confidence 
in his ability to make a winning fight. Did 
you ever study the faces of men in a city 
rescue mission? They do not appear so 
much hardened as hopeless. These men 
have fought many a desperate battle to 
shake themselves free from their evil habits,
-P-A-G-E-27
  
   Of the Teacher    
   
   but they have met with so many defeats 
they at last have lost all confidence in ti3 
power to reform, and it is next to impos 
sible to make an appeal strong enough to 
arouse them to effort. ‘‘It is no use,’’ they 
say. And if under special pressure they re- 
solve to make one more fight for manhood, 
there is lurking in the fringe of their con- 
sciousness the feeling that they will fail 
‘again. They have formed the habit of 
failing. 
Now all this is relevant to teaching and 
training children. The most careless ob- 
server of children has noticed how elated 
they are with victory and how depressed by 
defeat; he has noted that they like to play 
games in which they are successful and 
usually dislike games in which they are un- 
successful; he has observed that victory 
stimulates to new endeavor while defeat 
tends to discourage effort. All this means | 
that the emotional attitude of children 
strongly influences their wills and conduct.
-P-A-G-E-28
  
     
    The Personality 
‘no use’’ spirit gets into boys and girls 
ell as into men and women, and no more 
estructive spirit can take possession of a 
human soul. It should not be allowed to en- 
ter, and if it has gained possession it must 
be driven out at any cost. 
Some teachers delight in humiliating 
children by exposing their ignorance and 
stupidity and by emphasizing their mistakes 
and shortcomings. Such procedure develops 
a ‘‘don’t care’’ or a ‘‘no use’’ attitude of 
mind which paralyzes effort. Think of 
Napoleon’s addressing his army just before 
a battle in the spirit in which some teachers 
speak to a class on assigning a lesson. The 
greatest military genius of his age knew the 
value of an esprit de corps which would not 
admit the possibility of defeat. The school 
should be a place wherein intellectual and 
moral victories are won by children—weon 
by fighting—but won. A school where the 
children are meeting more defeats than vic- 
tories is no place to train American citizens
-P-A-G-E-29
    
  Of the Teacher 31 
  to win in the struggle of life to which they 
are destined. 
The tone of the school is, then, of su- 
preme importance, for it inevitably exerts a 
silent but mighty influence on the develop- 
ing boy or girl. It is a power for good or 
ill which should not be ignored by any one 
responsible for the education of childhood. 
It is all the more potent because it is silent 
and unobtrusive. When the children whom 
we now teach have become men ‘and 
women, and the text-books which they study 
have been put by and forgotten, when the 
days of their childhood and school have 
become to them a memory only rarely re- 
called, when the precepts of life which we 
so faithfully taught have entirely faded from 
their recollection, there happily may still 
remain as a silent yet regnant influence in 
their lives those attitudes of mind and ideals 
of life which were unconsciously nourished 
by the moral and intellectual tone of the 
school.

PROBLEMS FOR THE TEACHER 
Study yourself and note to what extent your 
moods affect your conduct. 
What effect has your interest or lack of interest 
in a subject upon the amount of work you 
can do in a given time? 
How does your interest in a subject affect your 
teaching it? 
Compare the general influence upon their chil- 
dren of two homes radically different with re- 
spect to tone or atmosphere. 
Note the difference in tone and spirit in your 
school on different days. 
Observe the effect. of these different conditions 
on the work of the pupils. 
Study the causes which produced the different 
conditions in tone. 
Study the value of scolding and driving as com- 
pared with encouragement and enthusiasm as 
means of -getting children to do good school 
work. 
Note the effect of defeat and victory ’in the lives 
of your pupils. Experiment to test the effect. 
Study the power of children to hold themselves 
to disagreeable tasks. 
Note the causes which produce unprofitable 
moods in yourself. In your pupils. f

CHAPTER II 
PERSONALITY 
In the preceding chapter I tried to set 
forth the supreme importance of the tone of 
the school in the intellectual and moral edu- 
cation of children. The next logical step 
is to discover, if we can, what is the domi- 
nant factor in the tone of the school. If 
the tone or atmosphere of the school is so 
potential in the success of teacher and pu- 
pil, we should know how it may be deter- 
mined and controlled. 
Twenty-five years after his graduation, 
a man revisited his alma mater. Though 
much was changed, much remained as of old. 
There was the river where he and his chums 
had so often bathed and boated; there was 
the athletic field where they had won vic- 
tories and met defeats; and there was the
-P-A-G-E-32
    
34 The Possgattinn 
dormitory; and up yonder the window of the 
room where he had lived four happy college 
years. Here were the laboratories in which 
he had resolved chemical compounds and 
traced the circulation in root and leaf. Old 
memories awakened. The names and faces 
of classmates came thronging back. And 
yet he was not stirred as he had expected 
he would be. Something seemed lacking. 
There was a far-awayness to it all. The 
scenes about him did not seem vital and 
personal. He entered the laboratories, and 
in the corridor unexpectedly met his favorite 
teacher of twenty-five years ago. A thrill 
of pleasure shot through his heart and with 
a handshake that bridged a quarter of a 
century the whole scene. changed. It became 
alive. The past was again present. As he 
left the laboratories he said within himself, 
‘‘Had I failed to see Professor K- my 
visit would have been a disappointment; 
after all, men, not campus and buildings, 
make a college.’’  
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  
Of the Teacher 35 
  The Teacher Is the School 
The college alumnus was right,—the 
teacher makes the school. The late Profes- 
sor Payne of the University of Michigan is 
responsible for the statement that eighty- 
five per cent of the value of a school lies 
in the teacher. The buildings, laboratories, 
libraries, and all other physical equipment 
count but fifteen percent. It is the teacher 
that makes all these worth while. 
Bishop Spaulding of Peoria thus sets 
forth the supreme value of a teacher: ‘‘The 
teacher is the school. What the soul is to 
the body, what the mind is to the man, that 
the teacher is to the school. A good teacher 
will find or devise good methods and will 
employ them with discernment, dealing with 
each pupil as an individual Soul, unlike any 
other that exists or has existed. His very 
presence commands attention, solicits inter- 
est and suggests thought. He is-alive and 
he awakens life. His pupils learn to feel 
that it is good to be where he is, and they 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  36 The Personality 
follow him as gladly as though he led them 
into the balmy air of spritig along the flowery 
banks of limpid streams.’’ 
‘“What shall I have my child study?”’ 
asked an anxious mother of a wise friend. 
“Tt matters not so much what she studies 
‘as with whom she studies,’’ was the saga- 
cious answer. 
In ancient days, before there were per- 
manent universities with splendid buildings, 
with endowments and scores of professors, 
achools centered around individuals. Hager 
minds sought out the man with a great mes- 
sage and attached themselves to him, some- 
times quite against his desire. In this way 
men gathered about Socrates, drawn by the 
richness of his wisdom and the nobility of 
his life. They were not sent to him for 
instruction,—they came. After a similar 
fashion students flocked to Alcuin, the great 
teacher of the Court of Charlemagne, and 
three hundred years later to Peter Abelard 
at Paris. Dr. Thomas Arnold made Rugby

the most famous boys’ school in all England, 
and Agassiz made Harvard the most re- 
nowned school of biology in America. 
Our own experiences confirm this view of 
the value of the teacher. Recall the years 
of your school life which were most fruit- 
ful of good, and then recall the years that 
yielded the most disappointing returns. 
‘What made the difference? Certainly not 
the schoolroom, nor the furniture, nor the 
maps on the walls, nor the books with which 
you studied. Nor yet was it your classmates, 
nor yourself. The difference lay in the 
teacher. “We may rightly measure our edu- 
cation not by the number of years we have 
spent in the school but by~the number 
of stimulating, suggestive, and inspiring 
teachers it, has been our good fortune to have 
known.

perience is trustworthy, the teacher makes

the school. We solve the question of good 
schools, then, when we solve the question of 
good teachers. This brings us face to face 
with the inquiry as to what constitutes a 
good teacher. What are the elements of 
character that, combined, make a man or a 
woman a successful guide and leader of 
childhood? This is a most practical and 
searching question for every one who is, or 
aspires to be, a teacher. Let me attempt to 
answer it. 
Importance of ‘Personality 
Should you ask a thousand superintend- 
ents what is the one fundamental and basic 
qualification which they look for in the 
teachers they employ, ten hundred of them 
would reply, ‘‘Personality.’? They might 
use different terms, but they would mean 
the same thing. Should you ask a thousand 
superintendents the most frequent cause 
for the failures of teachers, ten hundred 
would reply, ‘‘Lack of personality.’? Should
-P-A-G-E-37
  
Oe ee en 
Of the Teacher 39 
you ask the presidents of normal schools 
what type of students is the most hopeless 
material out of which to make teachers, they 
would unanimously reply, ‘‘The type which 
is lacking in personality.’’ “Personality is 
the keystone in the arch which spans the 
chasm of defeatJIt is the parent germ out 
of which evolve all other necessary quali- 
ties; it is the element, possessing which, all 
other good qualities are increased, and lack- 
ing which, all other good qualities are mini- 
mized and rendered ineffectual. 
In his charming booklet on ‘‘Unconscious 
Tuition,’’? Bishop Huntington has the follow- 
ing passage on the unconscious power of 
personality: 
“My “purpose here is simply to show 
that some of the deepest-and most power- 
ful impressions are made on our minds, inde- 
pendently of any spoken or written words, 
by influences, by signs, by associations be- 
yond any speech. And this point lies close 
to my argument. You know the remark
-P-A-G-E-38
    
40 The Personality 
they used to make about Lord Chatham, that 
everybody felt there was something finer in 
the man than anything he ever said. We 
are taught and we teach by something about 
us that never goes into language at all. I 
believe that often this is the very highest 
kind of teaching, most charged with moral 
power, most likely to go down among the 
secret springs of conduct, most effectual for 
vital issues, for the very reason that it is 
spiritual in its character, noiseless in its 
pretention and constant in operation.’’ 
_ Some personalities have the power of 
awaking all the sleeping imps of evil in 
boys and girls. Their presence invites mis- 
chief and rebellion, and the very means they 
adopt to repress disorder breeds more dis- 
order. It is a constant warfare between 
them and their pupils. This is no exaggera- 
tion. Numbers of students who enter the 
normal school with which I am connected 
admit that such was their attitude toward — 
many of the teachers in the grades and in
-P-A-G-E-39
    
Of the Teacher 41 
the high schools. Unfortunately these cross- 
grained personalities do not seem to know 
the cause of their trouble, but think it lies 
in the natural depravity of childhood instead 
of in themselves. 
I recently had an application for a posi- 
tion from a teacher of fine preparation and 
considerable experience, I wrote to a wise, 
open-minded normal school president, with 
whom she once taught, asking about her per- 
sonality. ‘‘She is simply impossible,’’ he 
replied. ‘‘She cannot get along happily with 
colleagues:nor pupils.’’? I have no doubt this 
person could draw up a general indictment 
against superintendents, normal school presi- 
dents and children. To her, humanity is 
sadly out of joint? 
Inspiring Personalities 
Happily there is another type of teacher, 
much more common, whose personality calls 
into activity all the good brownies in chil- 
dren’s hearts. Where such men and women
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  42 The Personality 
are it is easy to do well. They inspire order, 
system, industry and love of knowledge. 
Worthy ambitions spring up in even stub- 
born and rebellious natures under the light 
and warmth of their presence as flowers come 
forth from the cold earth under the genial 
rays of the spring sun. 
The great teachers of history have been 
men of inspiring personality. The secret of 
the power that Socrates had over the hearts 
and lives of men is revealed to us in the 
tribute Xenophon, one of his illustrious dis- 
ciples, paid to his dead master. ‘‘Of those 
who knew what sort of man Socrates was,’’ 
said Xenophon, ‘‘such as were lovers of vir- 
tue continued to regret him above all other 
men, even to the present day, as having con- 
tributed in the. highest degree to their 
advancement in goodness. To me, being - 
such as I have described him, so_pious that 
he did nothing without the sanction of the 
gods; so just, that he wronged no man, even 
in the most trifling affair, but was of service
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  
Of the Teacher 43 
in the most important matters to those who 
enjoyed his society; so temperate, that he 
never preferred pleasure to virtue; so wise, 
that he never erred to distinguish better 
from worse, needing no counsel from others, 
but being sufficient in himself to discrimi- 
nate between them; so able to explain and 
settle such questions by arguments; and so 
capable of discerning the character of others, 
of confuting those who were in error and of 
exhorting them to virtue and honor—to me, 
I say, he seemed to be such as the best and 
happiest of men would be.’’? To know such 
a man as Xenophon has described, to be 
under the influence of his life and the in-. 
spiration of his thought, whether in a univer- 
sity with modern equipment or on a rock 
by the roadside, would be a cause of grati- 
tude to heaven. 
It was equally true of Arnold that_his 
power lay in his splendid manhood. Dean 
Stanley, a Rugby boy, who has given us the 
best history of the famous Rugby school, de-  
-P-A-G-E-42
  
    
44 The Personality 
clared, with some exaggeration no doubt, 
that he could put all that Arnold taught him 
into a little notebook; and yet the boys 
trained at Rugby were winning honors at the 
universities. Of Arnold, Dr. Percival says: 
‘“‘His influence was stimulative rather than 
formulative, the secret of his power consist- 
ing not so much in the novelty of his ideas 
or methods as in his commanding and mag- 
netic personality and the intensity and 
earnestness with which he impressed his 
views and made them—as a prophet makes 
his message, a part of the living forces of 
his time.’”? But Socrates and Arnold are 
no exceptions. It is as true of the little 
woman in an isolated district of Montana 
as of them,—that her most effective influence 
for the unfolding of the minds and hearts 
of her pupils will flow from that hidden 
spring which we call ‘‘personality.’’ 
Can Personality Be Developed? 
But having concluded that personality is 
the basic qualification of a successful teacher,
-P-A-G-E-43
    
Of the Teacher 45 
have we really made much progress? Have 
we said anything to make clear to any young 
person ambitious to become a teacher what 
steps must be taken to reach the coveted 
goal? I fear not. The writer remembers 
well as a young man, a novice in the pro- 
fession, how helpless and almost hopeless 
he felt after listening to an address on 
‘‘personality’’ by a noted educator. He 
exalted personality, but did not say of what 
it consisted or how it might be acquired or 
developed. Indeed, his view plainly was 
that, like genius, it was inborn, or, like the 
grace of God, descended from heaven— 
small comfort to one who did not think him- 
self a genius or a special favorite of the 
Deity. 
If personality is inborn, if good teachers 
are such ‘‘by the Grace of God,’’ if leader- 
ship cannot be developed through conscious 
and conscientious effort, then it is useless 
to take much time in discussing it with 
teachers and would-be teachers. The only 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  46 The Personality 
thing to do is to apply the test of a brief 
trial to candidates for teaching, and reject. 
those who do not show that they have been 
endowed with a heaven-born gift. If, on the 
other hand, leadership can be developed, if 
by taking thought we may add to the 
stature of our personality, then it is worth 
our time to endeavor to learn of what it con- 
sists and what are the laws of its growth. 
The writer believes that what we call person- 
ality may be developed, and that it will be 
fruitful to inquire into its nature and the 
condition under which it unfolds. 
Of course, something cannot come out of 
nothing. There must be in the person the 
possibility of growth. There must be the 
germs of character or character will not be 
evolved. Persons differ in their original en- 
dowment. Some are natural teachers, others 
are not. Geniuses are rare. Not enough 
can be found to supply the schools. Most 
schools must be taught by persons of average 
éndowment\ who have through study and ex-

perience and conscientious effort, developed * 
the one, the two, or possibly the three talents 
nature bequeathed them. ‘‘The door of 
hope’’ is shut to but few. " 
But what is personality? Of w 
is it made? Can we get at its co t 
parts? Can we resolve it into its elements 
as we resolve the white light of day by pass- 
ing it through a prism? In the succeeding 
chapters I shall make the attempt to answer 
these questions. ¢ 
PROBLEMS FOR THE TEACHER

like to be with them, or do you naturally avoid 
them when possible? 
2. Which do you like better, boys or girls? Why? 
3. Do you feel inclined to dislike mischievous chil- 
dren? Dull children? Why? 
4, Try to describe how you felt when you thought 
the teacher disliked you.

  CHAPTER III 
SYMPATHY 
Our present problem is to find the ele- 
ments of personality, which, united in an 
individual, make him a successful teacher. 
Fundamentally, teaching is leadership. It is 
essentially the art of stimulating and guid- 
ing the activity of another person’s mind. 
You cannot inject an idea into a pupil’s men- 
tal circulation as the doctor hypodermically 
injects drugs into the blood. The only thing 
that you can do is to lead him to center his 
attention on the idea which you wish him to 
get, by arousing his interest in it. There 
your power stops, and the pupil’s mind must 
do the rest. The teacher’is then an energizer 
and a guide. He arouses and directs the 
mental activities of his pupils. ; 
In this respect he is like all great leaders 
of men, for the leaders of men have done
-P-A-G-E-48
  
    50 The Personality 
precisely this thing,—they have aroused and 
directed the mental life of their followers. 
If we can discover the elements of person- 
ality in the great leaders of the race, we shall 
undoubtedly hit upon the qualities which 
are essential to a good teacher. Can we 
find common qualities in such diverse charac- 
ters as Jesus of Nazareth, Moses, King 
David, Julius Caesar, Gladstone, Lincoln, 
which gave them power over men and make 
them stand out in history as great leaders 
of humanity? I think we can. 
It goes without demonstration that we 
cannot control and manipulate a machine un- 
less we understand it. The automobile is 
tractable and easily managed by an expe- 
rienced driver, but to the novice it is a 
sullen and incorrigible demon of destruction. 
We have all sat in wonder and admiration 
at a trained animal show. Here were great, 
clumsy elephants, treacherous polar bears 
and fierce lions and tigers performing incon- 
ceivable tricks at the crack of the whip. By
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  
Of the Teacher 51   
what secret power was the trainer able to 
bring these fierce natures under his control 
and make them amenable to his will and 
order? Should you ask him he would reply 
that the primary source of his power is an 
understanding of animal nature. Every ani- 
mal is an individual and the trainer must 
know the peculiar traits and characteristics 
of each. Some men never can acquire an 
insight into animal psychology just as some 
men can never comprehend an intricate 
machine. 
Sympathy Gives Insight 
Now, leadership of men demands insight 
into human nature precisely as the control 
of animals rests on insight into animal 
nature. This insight sympathy gives. The 
word ‘‘sythpathy’’ comes from two Greek 
words and literally means ‘‘to suffer with.’’ 
It stands for the ability to put yourself in 
the other man’s place; to enter into his feel- 
ings; to understand and’ share his joys and  
-P-A-G-E-50
s   
  52 The Personality 
his sorrows, his difficulties and perplexities, 
his victories and defeats, his hopes and 
aspirations. 
In his inspiring book, ‘‘The Life that 
Counts,’’ President Samuel V. Cole has the 
following to say of the value of sympathy: 
‘“‘Human sympathy is a priceless possession 
in anybody’s life. For the highest service 
as well as for the highest culture it is indis- 
pensable. It is an element in all leader- 
ship; unless one feels with others he can 
never understand them or exert’ much in- 
fluence over their lives. Not what we possess 
in separateness and isolation but what we 
possess in common, or are able and willing 
to share, gives us power and usefulness 
among men. The greatest benefactors of 
the race have been men of great sympathies. 
With the spirit of caste or exclusiveness they 
have had no lot or part; there is not a snob 
or a Pharisee among them.’’ 
A man lacking sympathy never becomes 
a popular leader no matter how honest, intel-
-P-A-G-E-51
  
Of the Teacher 53 
ligent and well-meaning he may be. He may 
command the respect but he cannot win the 
hearts of the multitude, and they will turn 
from him to a man less worthy who knows 
the way to their affections. The remark- 
able hold which the character and teachings 
of Jesus have upon the hearts and imagina- 
tions of men of all creeds to-day is due not 
more to the purity of his life than to the 
sympathetic insight with which he entered 
into the experiences of humanity. He knew 
the, heart’ of man. 
Sympathy the Basis of Tact 
Sympathy is the basis of that most valu- 
able and: much-to-be-coveted ‘quality which 
we call tact. Tact’ is the ability to adjust 
one’s self to the peculiarities and idiosyn- 
erasies of mankind, and is indispensable to 
any one who has to deal with humanity. The 
historian Lecky. has put the following dis- 
eriminating evaluation upon tact: 
“Tt is certainly not the highest of human  
-P-A-G-E-52
    
54 The Personality 
endowments, but it is as certainly one of the 
most valuable, for it is that which chiefly 
enables a man to use his other gifts to ad- 
vantage, and which most effectually supplies 
the place of those that are wanting. It lies 
on the borderland of character and intellect. 
It implies self-restraint, good temper, quick 
and kindly sympathy with the feelings of 
others. It implies also a perception of the 
finer shadings of character and expression, 
the intellectual gift which enables a man to 
catch those more delicate notes of feeling to 
which a coarser nature is insensible.’’ 
Put tact and talent side by side in a con- 
test for position and power involving the 
favor of men and nine times out of ten tact 
will win. We cannot resist the charm of a 
person who is always agreeable, neither can 
we resist the repulsion of one who has a 
genius for making himself disagreeable. The 
greatest achievements in statesmanship and 
diplomacy are more likely to be accomplished 
by a man of moderate abilities accompanied
-P-A-G-E-53
  
  
Of the Teacher 55 
by tact than by sheer genius. It is said that 
at his death King Edward VII of England 
was the most influential person in Europe, 
despite the fact that the sovereign of Great 
Britain is theoretically barred from having a 
part in shaping the policies of the Empire. 
The influence of Edward came through his 
good sense and unfailing tact. The diplo- 
matic success of Franklin at the court of 
France during the American Revolution was 
quite as much a triumph of courtesy and tact 
as of learning and statesmanship. 
Tact vs. Personality 
There are persons who despise tact as un- 
manly and ignoble and quite unworthy of a 
frank and courageous nature. They ‘‘speak 
their mind’’ and ‘‘tell people what they 
think.’? They want people to know where 
they stand. .They pride themselves on their 
courage and honesty. They plant both feet 
squarely on the first article of amendment 
to the federal constitution, which guarantees
-P-A-G-E-54
    
56 The Personality 
freedom of speech. Such people go through 
life needlessly hurting and bruising, cooling 
their friends and heating their enemies, de- 
nied an opportunity to do the larger and 
better things in the great world’s work, and 
usually, if they are persons of abilities, 
cherishing the conviction that they are not 
appreciated and honored according to their 
deserts. Who has not known such unfor- 
tunate lives? ; 
Let us distinguish between tact and syco- 
phancy. Tact is not toadyism. It is not 
weak compliancy to the whims, prejudices 
and impositions of others. It is not trick- 
ery, subterfuge nor flattery. These are 
justly contemptible in any man. If you 
would study one of the noblest and inspiring 
examples of tact in dealing with great men 
and a great and sensitive people in a stu- 
pendous crisis, study the life of Abraham 
Lincoln. The consummate skill with which 
he managed such diverse and antagonistic 
temperaments as Stanton and Seward and

made them work in harness has rarely if 
ever been surpassed, while at the same time 
his bed-rock honesty and clear-eyed frank- 
ness can be challenged by none. From such 
a study you will come with a clearer concep- 
tion of what tact is and with a higher appre- 
ciation of its value. 
Opportunities for Tactfulness 
Teaching is a calling that deals with hu- 
man nature and for that reason the teacher 
must be a person of infinite tact. In the 
first place, he must adjust himself to the 
varieties of temperament represented by 
his superior officers. Some are unable to do 
this. They are always at outs with some- 
body. I have known teachers who were 
never able to get the co-operation of the 
school boards in the furnishing and equip- 
ment of their schools. Somehow they always 
had ‘‘stingy’’ officers. Yet these same 
officers proved very liberal to the succeed- 
ing teacher. I am suspicious that the dis-
-P-A-G-E-56
    
    
ee 
58 The Personality 
position of the teacher was contributory to 
the ‘‘stinginess’’ of the board. 
Probably nowhere is tactful diplomacy so 
needful to the teacher as in dealing with 
the parents. Here is a field of endeavor 
that would test the diplomatic skill of a 
Franklin or a Lincoln. The parents must be 
won or the teacher is certain to fail} The 
welfare of the child demands that school 
and home shall work in harmony. But how 
difficult the problem: here is Mrs. Brown, 
whose children must never be punished, and 
here is Mr. Jones, who wants his boy 
spanked twice a week; here is Mrs. Davis, 
whose ‘‘Jimmie’’ is picked on by the other 
boys, and here is Mrs. Smith, who insists 
that her Mary must be promoted though she 
has been absent half the time during the 
year and has utterly failed in her work. But 
why particularize? ‘We all know the nu- 
merous tales of woe. Now, I submit that 
here is ample scope for tact, but tact of the
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  Of the Teacher 59 
Lincoln and Franklin brand is equal to the 
situation. 
Tact will recognize the heart of the 
parent desiring the best for the child; it will 
recognize the parents’ right to call at the 
school and talk matters over; it will frankly 
and kindly listen to the parents’ view of the 
ease; it will as kindly and frankly present 
the teacher’s side. Nineteen times out of 
twenty tact will win; for courtesy, kindli- 
ness and sincerity are all but irresistible. 
As I write these lines my mind goes back 
many years. I see a young man who is 
teaching his first school standing at the win- 
dow at the close of the day, watching the 
determined stride of a woman coming up 
the walk. He had disciplined a boy that day 
and the youngster’s mother was about to pay 
him a visit, as had been predicted. She had 
a reputation for ‘‘calls’’ on the teachers. A 
campaign of defense was swiftly planned. 
There was a knock:at the door. The teacher 
opened it and with his most gracious smile
-P-A-G-E-58
  oO... The Personality 
and cordial handshake welcomed the visitor. 
She was asked to take a seat. A most de- 
lightful conversation followed, in which the 
teacher took the lead. ‘The topics were 
various, but finally the important matter 
was reached and talked over in a frank and 
kindly spirit and the lady, thanking the 
teacher for his interest in her boy, took her 
departure. From that day her family, in- 
cluding her husband, were the teacher’s 
loyal friends. 
The same plan will not always win. A 
trout fisherman needs more than one kind 
of bait if he would fill his creel day after 
day. It is tact that detects what bait is 
suited to the taste of the various disposi- 
tions comprehended in the genus parent. 
Again let me insist that tact is not cheap 
and insincere diplomacy that shuns issues 
that should be faced; it is rather an insight 
into human nature which avoids needless 
controversies and meets all necessary ones
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Of the Teacher 61 
  so open-mindedly, fairly and wisely as to 
dispel any ill-will in opponents. 
Sympathetic Insight Necessary 
But the great work of the teacher is with | 
childhood. He is a ‘‘fisher’’ of children. He 
must catch them. This is a primary con- 
dition of success. Usually if he catches the 
children he will catch the parents. In deal- 
ing with children he fails utterly if he has 
not the insight which sympathy gives. Lack- 
ing this insight, all his other qualifications 
are relatively ineffective, for he cannot 
utilize them. He is like a novice before a 
machine; he does not know what levers to 
pull and what valves to turn. He is a dis- 
connected battery; the energy in his soul 
cannot flow from him to the mental machine 
he is endeavoring to control. 
Says Dr. Dutton of Columbia: ‘‘I have 
the presumption to say that the first requisite 
to a successful school is that the teacher 
know her pupils, that she know each indi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
      
62 The Personality 
vidual as such. How many times has this 
been said, and yet how many teachers have 
a blurred vision which enables them to see 
the school only in the mass, amd lack that 
perception which recognizes the infinite 
variety of temperament and disposition 
there represented.’’ There is no average 
child. Every child is an individual and must 
be dealt with as such. Each mind has its 
own peculiar set of frictions, says Profes- 
sor Palmer; and a teacher must have the 
intuition to discover these frictions and deal 
with them individually. 
It is beyond controversy that at this par- 
ticular point the schools are most subject to 
criticism. Here is where they fail most. 
Our city system deals with children enbloc; 
they are taught ‘‘by grades’’ and are pro- 
moted ‘‘by grades’’; ‘‘the grades’? are 
often, almost always, too large; and the 
backward child, the gifted child, and the 
‘peculiar’? child are lost in the mass. The 
number of classes which the country teacher *
-P-A-G-E-61
  
Of the Teacher 63 
  has to conduct daily makes the problem of 
individualizing quite as difficult in the coun- 
try as in the city. Against these adverse 
conditions the teacher must take up arms 
and stoutly fight for the rights of the in- 
dividual boy and girl. He must study his 
children as minutely as the trainer studies 
animals, if he would render to each the serv- 
ice which each has a right to expect. 
In his ‘‘Ideal Teacher,’’ which every one 
should read, Professor Palmer has beauti- 
fully described the function of the teacher. 
“Most human beings,’’ he says, ‘‘are con- 
tented with living one life and delighted if 
they can pass that agreeably. But this is 
not enough for us teachers. We incessantly 
go outside ourselves and enter into the 
many lives about us—lives dull, dark and 
unintelligible to any but an eye like ours. 
And this is imagination, the sympathetic 
creation in ourselves of conditions which be- 
. long to others. Our profession is therefore 
% a double-ended one. We inspect truth as it 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  
64 The Personality 
tises fresh and interesting before our eager 
sight. But that is only the beginning of 
our task. Swiftly we then seize the lines of _ 
least intellectual resistance in alien minds 
and, with perpetual reference to those, fol- 
low our truth till it is safely lodged beyond 
ourselves. 
‘‘Hach mind has its peculiar set of fric- 
tions. Those of our pupils can never be 
the same as ours. We have passed far on 
and know all about our subject. For us it 
wears an altogether different look from 
that which it has for beginners. It is their 
perplexities which we must reproduce and— 
as if a rose should shut and be a bud again— 
we must reassume in our developed and 
accustomed souls something of the inno- 
cence of childhood. Such is the exquisite 
business of the teacher, to carry himself back 
with all his wealth and knowledge, and 
understand how his subject should appear to 
the meager mind of one glancing at it for 
the first time.’’
-P-A-G-E-63

Dr. H. Clay Trumbull, for years editor

nent to our work as teachers that the word 
teacher could be substituted wherever the 
word parent occurs. 
‘““A child needs sympathy hardly less 
than he needs love; yet ten children are 
loved by their parents where one child has 
his parents’ sympathy. Every parent will 
admit that love for his children is a duty, 
but only now and then is there a parent who 
realizes that he ought to have sympathy 
with his children. In fact, it may safely be 
said that among those children who are not 
called to suffer from actual unkindness on 
the part of their parents there is no greater 
cause for unhappiness than the lack of pa- 
rental sympathy. And, on the other hand, 
it is unquestionably true that in no way can 
any parent gain such power over his child  
-P-A-G-E-64

for the shaping of the child’s character and 
habits of life as by having and showing . 
sympathy with that child. 
‘““How the child ought to feel is one 
thing. How the child does feel is quite 
another thing. The parent may know the 
former better than the child does; but the 
latter the child knows better than the parent. 
Until a parent has learned just how the child 
looks at any matter, the parent is incapable 
of so coming alongside of the child in his 
estimate of that matter as to win his con- 
fidence and to work with him toward a more 
correct view of it. To stand off apart from 
the child and tell him how he ought to think 
and feel may be a means of disheartening 
him, as he finds himself so far from the cor- 
rect standard. But to stand with the child 
and point him to the course he ought to 
pursue is more likely to inspire him to hon- 
est efforts in that direction, until he comes 
to think and to feel as his parent would 
have him.
-P-A-G-E-65

Of the Teacher 67 
  ‘<Still more does a parent lose an oppor- 
tunity for good to his child if he fails to 
have sympathy with his child in that child’s 
weaknesses and follies and misdoings. It is 
in every child’s nature to long for sympathy 
at the point where he needs it most; and 
when he has done wrong or has indulged 
evil thoughts, or is feeling the force of temp- 
tation, he is glad to turn to some one 
stronger and better than himself, and make 
confession of his faults and failures. If, as 
he comes to his parents at such a time, he 
is met with manifest sympathy, he is drawn 
to his parents with new confidence and new 
trust. But, if he is met unsympathetically, 
and is simply told how wrong he is, or how 
strange it seems that he should be so far 
astray, he is turned back upon himself to 
meet his bitterest life struggle all by him- 
self; and a new barrier is reared between 
him and his parents that no parental love 
can remove, and that no parental watchful-

ness or care can make a blessing to either 
child or parent.’’ 
As we read these paragraphs it comes 
with new meaning, ‘‘Except ye become as 
little children,’? and. the resolve is born 
anew to bring to our work as teachers that 
sympathy which shall open to us the holy 
of holies of the child’s love and confidence. « 
Sympathy a Source of Joy 
Sympathy is the seed of perpetual joy in 
teaching. ‘‘How can you endure the teach- 
ing of elementary Greek year after year?’’ 
asked a man of a friend of mine, who was 
one of the best teachers I have ever known. 
“‘Bless your soul,’’ replied the teacher, ‘‘I 
do not teach Greek, I teach boys and girls.’’ 
Years glided by and still he taught with all 
the fire of his youth. Love of knowledge is 
not a permanent source of joy in teaching— 
indeed, it has the tendency, sooner or later, to 
disqualify one for that vocation. The more 
one knows the more difficult and uninter-

esting it is to deal with the ignorance of 
untrained minds, unless one has a perennial 
interest in such minds. Those who lack this 
love for childhood tire of teaching as soon 
as the novelty wears off and tend to be- 
come cold and harsh and joyless. They are 
the nagging, scolding, sarcastic teachers. 
They teach to live, while the true teacher 
lives to teach. 
To the true lover of childhood’ every 
mind is a new problem in life, a riddle to 
be solved, an unknown country to be ex- 
plored; and to watch the unfolding of the 
powers and capabilities of the soul is a 
privilege and a joy. It is this that tempts 
the best teachers into the profession and 
keeps them there. They would not change 
their calling for double the salary. They 
teach for the same reason that an artist 
paints or a poet writes—‘‘for the joy of the - 
doing.’’ 
The sympathy which I am discussing 
must be distinguished from mere senti-

mentality. It is not emotion and gush. It 
is intelligent, calm and self-possessed. It 
sees the evil as well as the good in every 
child. It can be severe when severity is de- 
manded, but always and everywhere it will 
have faith that goodness is stronger than 
evil, and with this enlightened and abhid- 
ing optimism it confidently and joyfully 
labors on.

CHAPTER IV 
SINCERITY 
If we again carefully reflect upon the 
personalities of the great men I have men- 
tioned, we shall discover that another vital 
and dominating element in their character 
is sincerity. Says Carlyle: ‘‘But of a 
Great Man especially, of him I will venture 
‘to assert that it is incredible he should have 
been other, than true. It seems to me the 
primary foundation of him, and of all that 
ean lie in him, this: No Mirabeau, Napoleon, 
Burns, Cromwell, no man adequate to do any- 
thing, but is first of all in right earnest about 
it; what I call a sincere man. I should say © 
sincerity, a deep, great, genuine sincerity, is 
the first characteristic of all men in any way 
heroic.’’
-P-A-G-E-71
  
  Of the Teacher % 
Sincerity as Purpose, 
Sincerity with Carlyle is moral earnest- 
ness and depth of conviction. He holds that 
no man can long lead men and be a fraud 
and hypocrite at heart. The courage, forti- 
tude, strength of purpose and willingness to 
suffer which are found in all great leaders 
and which all leadership demands are vir- 
tues which do not grow in the soil of hypoc- 
risy and deceit. A man may be wrong, may 
be selfish, may not always be true and hon- 
est in his methods and~means, and still be 
supremely sincere in the work he undertakes 
to do. His soul and body are dedicated to 
its achievement. Judged from this point of 
view, Napoleon and Mahomet were sincere. 
Of Mahomet, Carlyle exclaims: ‘‘A false 
man found a religion! Why, a false man can- 
not build a brick house. If he does not know 
and follow truly the properties of mortar, 
burnt clay, and what else he works in, it is 
no house that he makes, but a rubbish-heap.’’ 
This whole-souled loyalty to a cause, this
-P-A-G-E-72
    
74 The Personality 
consecration to the work of life, is a tremen- 
dous power for achievement. If the lives of 
great men teach us anything it is the value 
of loyalty to our work. ‘‘Have a work to 
do,’’ they call to us down the centuries, ‘‘and 
be loyal to your work. Believe in it. Give 
your heart to it. In serving it you will save 
yourself. It is a thousand times better for 
a man that he honestly and heartily serve a 
wrong cause than no cause at all.’”’ Sin- 
cerity of purpose is fundamental to success. 
Nothing is of greater moment. Like love, 
“it beareth all things, hopeth all things, be- 
lieveth all things, endureth all things.’’ 
“‘This one thing I do,’’ cried Saint Paul— 
cries every man and woman who is doing 
anything worth while in this world. 
Nine-tenths of the failures of life are due) 
to a lack of devotion to the work in hand, 
to a vacillating, indifferent, flippant atti- 
tude towards life. Such an attitude of mind 
saps manhood. It makes the moral mus- 
cles flabby. It turns a man adrift like a

a 
o 
chip on the ocean. Too many are unvwill- 
ing to pay the price of victory. They for- 
get that the victories which they hope to 
achieve to-morrow must rest on the toil and 
self-denial of to-day. Men do not gather 
grapes from thorns nor figs from thistles. 
This applies just as truly to the teacher in 
District No. 9 as it does to the founder of 
a religion or the leader of a party. The 
basis of leadership, and teaching is leader- 
ship, is the same in every occupation. 
The teacher has a cause to serve. That 
cause is the training of boyhood and girl- 
hood, the making of manhood and woman- 
hood. To this cause he must be loyal. He 
must believe in its dignity. He must see 
in his work the good of all the world. He 
must throw into his work his whole soul. 
He must be willing to deny himself for it. 
He must have ‘‘a deep, great, genuine sin- 
cerity.”’ One lacking such sincerity has no 
place as a teacher of children. 
     
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  
76 The Personality 
Sincerity Gives Courage 
Courage is, it seems to me, a natural 
outgrowth of sincerity. A sincere man can 
never be a coward. Sincerity excludes 
cowardice as light excludes darkness or as 
heat excludes cold. Sincerity looks clear- 
eyed and calm-browed at danger of whatever 
sort. It is not afraid of ridicule, nor hate, 
nor defeat, nor death. The martyrs of his- 
tory from Socrates to Hampden have been 
men and women, yes, and children, of un- 
shakable sincerity and loyalty to the truth 
as they saw it. 
Teachers need courage to live up to 
their highest ideals; to withstand the temp- 
tation to go in the line of least resist- 
ance; to part with companions when they go 
wrong; to turn their backs upon pleasure 
when it beckons them away from the plain 
duties they have assumed; to work that they 
may better serve the children whom they 
teach; to keep faith in word and deed with 
all the obligations of life. The teacher needs
-P-A-G-E-75
    
Of the Teacher 17 
courage to frankly face and honestly weigh 
adverse criticism. Too few can do so. It is 
human nature to consider a critic an enemy. 
We are angry and resentful with those who 
oppose us or else we lose heart and give up. 
Hither course is proof of weakness. Na- 
poleon said he learned more from his ene- 
mies than from his friends. Friends discover 
our excellencies, of which we are quite apt 
to be aware; but our ‘‘not-friends’’ discover 
our shortcomings, to which we usually shut 
our-eyes. It is just as necessary for us to 
know the latter as to know the former. A 
teacher should cultivate the habit of bravely 
and candidly considering every adverse re- 
port that comes to him concerning his work. 
They are very often a source of great profit. 
If they have no foundation they may’ be 
dismissed and steps may be taken to correct 
the wrong impression. If, however, there is 
good cause for the adverse criticisms, we 
should be most thankful they have been 
made. ,
-P-A-G-E-76
    
78 The Personality 
The significance of courage in an effective 
life has been so well stated by Doctor Cole, 
whom I have quoted once before, that I shall 
venture to quote him again: 
‘Our virtues, and in fact about all the 
powers we possess, require the backing of 
courage to make them effective. Loyalty, 
honesty, sympathy, conviction of right, high 
ideals, knowledge, skill—these are worth no 
more than old lumber in a person’s life un- 
less he has courage enough to put them to 
use. , We fail oftener than anywhere else at 
the point of courage. Many a man sees what 
he ought to do but he lacks the will power 
and willingness to endure the necessary dis- 
comfort; that is to say, he lacks the courage 
for doing what he sees he ought. Some lives 
seem so well equipped, yet so fruitless of re- 
sults, that they remind us of a beautiful 
armory in which you find a splendid array 
of weapons but no hand to wield them.’’ 
In the preceding chapter I said that 
‘sympathy with the young was a source of
-P-A-G-E-77
  
  
Of the Teacher 79 
perennial joy in teaching. I did not say con- 
stant and continuous joy. A perennial 
flower is not always in bloom. There come 
days to every teacher when he tires in the 
work, possibly of the work; days when 
even the eager faces of childhood or youth 
become wearisome and their joyous laughter 
awakens no answering smile. Body and 
mind are weary. In such hours the world 
calls. Then it is that from the deep reser- 
voirs of sincerity and high purpose he drinks 
strengthening draughts of courage and forti- 
tude to bear the burdens of the hour. 
Sincerity as Moral Integrity 
But sincerity, as I am using the term, 
means more than it did with Carlyle, more 
than whole-hearted devotion to a cause. In 
its broadest significance sincerity stands’ for 
integrity of character, for genuine moral’ 
worth. To say of a man that he is sincere 
should mean not only that he has a worthy 
object in view and is earnest in its pursuit, 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
      
80 The Personality 
but that he is sound and reliable in all the 
relationships in life. It should mean that he 
is honest; that he is truthful; that he is 
trustworthy; that he is kindly and chari- | 
table; that he is a good member of society. 
Such sincerity we find in Moses, Wash- 
ington, Gladstone, Lincoln. Such sincerity 
we see in Dr. Thomas Arnold, President 
Hopkins, Dr. W. T. Harris, Horace Mann 
and other great teachers and educators. 
_ Such men despised deceit and all under- 
handed methods of gaining their ends. They 
loved the truth and lived the truth. Men 
grew nobler from association with them. 
They were trusted because they were not 
only wise but true. 
The world forgives mistakes but it is slow 
to forgive deceits. We pity and pardon 
Othello for the murder of his innocent Des- 
demona, but we scorn treacherous Iago, 
whose revengeful cunning awakened in the 
guileless Moor the jealousy which prompted 
the deed. We respect Governor Hutchinson
-P-A-G-E-79
  
Of the Teacher 81 
for his open and manly opposition to the 
action of the colonies in their conflict with 
Great Britain, but we have no respect for 
Benedict Arnold, who, in a mean spirit of 
revenge and greed, betrayed the cause he 
had so ardently championed. 
The one supreme quality we demand in 
our friends is sincerity. We cling to one 
who is true, we turn from one who is false. 
A man who is not morally trustworthy can- 
not hold the allegiance of his fellows. He 
may successfully play the hypocrite and con- 
ceal his real character for a time and thus 
hold the captaincy among men, but sooner 
or later his mask will be torn from him and 
his followers will desert him in disgust and 
anger. And even should he, by unusual 
cleverness, hold power throughout his life, 
the searching and unerring judgment of 
succeeding generations will detect his moral 
unsoundness and deny him a place on their 
roll of honorable remembrance. 
In no one is integrity of character more  
-P-A-G-E-80
    
82 The Personality 
to be sought than in a teacher. To no one 
is this virture more needful for success. 
Neither cleverness nor craftiness can take 
the place of simple, straightforward, down- 
right honesty of heart. It is the bed-rock 
of a teacher’s character. If he have not this, 
all his other talents are worthless. 
There are some teachers who disbelieve 
this in spite of history. They seem to think 
that craft is a safe substitute for character, 
and deceit for decency. They spend more 
energy in perfecting the schemes to conceal 
their real character than would be necessary 
to make them worthy. Sooner or later their 
deception is discovered and they are repu- 
diated by society as unworthy of confidence 
and trust. It seems unthinkable that a 
teacher should be other than upright and 
true, and it is an honor to the profession 
and a credit to the moral sentiments of 
humanity that so few prove to be unworthy. 
Instinctively society refuses to tolerate as a 
teacher anyone who is not pure and upright.
-P-A-G-E-81
  
  
Of the Teacher 83 
Sincerity the Mother of Justice 
Sincerity, in the broader sense, is the 
mother of justice. One of the virtues which 
we look for in parent and friend, in judge 
and juror, and no less in the teacher, is a 
keen sense and a high ideal of justice. Jus- 
tice to all has ever been cherished as one 
of the noblest of American ideals. It is the 
pole star by which every great American 
statesman and jurist steers his course. The 
great world problem is to bring about such 
conditions that every human being shall have 
a just and fair share of the blessings of life. 
We rank governments according to their 
ability to make effective laws guaranteeing 
equal justice to all classes and conditions of 
their population. 
You will recall the typical representation 
of the spirit of justice, a figure blindfolded, 
holding in one hand a pair of balances and 
in the other a sword, the symbol of power. 
The blinded eyes signify that justice in the 
administration of rewards and punishments
-P-A-G-E-82
    
84 The Personality 
is blind to all distinctions between friend and 
foe, kin and stranger, and that the deeds of 
all will be impartially weighed and requited. * 
‘We respect and honor laws and courts and 
judges so far as they are true to this ideal, 
and we repudiate them and rebel against 
them when we believe them false to this 
conception. 
Justice is as much an ideal of American 
childhood as of American adulthood. In his 
earliest years, if a child has playmates, he 
is made aware that there are rules of the 
game which he must obey if he is allowed 
to play. To be ‘‘fair’’ is to childhood what 
to be ‘‘just’’ is to the adult. If you listen 
to a group of children at play you will hear 
repeated appeals for ‘‘fairness.’’, ‘‘He does 
not play fair’’ is ground enough for putting 
a companion out of the game. Few stronger 
appeals can be made to a boy than that to 
his sense of fair play. 
The children take this keen sense of 
justice into the schoolroom. They are alert
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Of the Teacher 85   
  
in watching and weighing the acts and words 
of a teacher. They are quick to detect the 
slightest partiality or favoritism or the 
absence of square dealing with any member 
of the school. The teacher who is just has 
a moral hold upon his pupils that nothing 
else will give. The teacher who is pronounced 
‘‘unfair’’ has lost his leadership. The chil- 
dren proclaim their verdict ‘‘fair’’ or ‘‘un- 
fair’ in their homes, and the reputation of 
the teacher is made for good or ill throughout 
the entire neighborhood. 
The teacher is under the same obligations 
to be just as is the judge, and, at the same 
time, the possibilities of being unjust and 
the temptation to be unfair are perhaps 
greater. The judge stands in an impersonal 
relation to the laws which he interprets and 
applies. He did not make them, and his per- 
sonal dignity and honor are not involved if 
they are broken. Moreover, he is not per- 
sonally interested in the individuals who may 
be involved in the case before him. <A judge 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
    
86 The Personality   
  
would not be allowed to preside in the trial 
of a case if it were known he had any per- 
sonal interest in the matter. Not so with the 
teacher. His personality is involved in every 
rule violated and every offense committed. 
He is the legislator, the executive and the 
judge. The three functions of government 
which society has so carefully and specifically 
separated and lodged in three independent 
but codrdinate departments of government, 
are vested in him. He is a despot, a tyrant, 
in the original sense of the terms,—that no 
one shares with him the responsibilities of 
government.) Herein is his danger: 
Violation of Justice 
There are three particulars in which a 
teacher is likely to violate the principles of 
justice. \First, he is in danger of being par- 
tial in dealing with his pupils. In every 
school there are children whom nature and 
training have made very attractive, and 
there are others who have been favored by
-P-A-G-E-85
  
Of the Teacher nog 
  
neither nature nor family environment; there 
are the bright pupils and the dull pupils; 
there is the straight-grained, pliable, adjust- 
able type, and there is the crooked, gnarled 
and inflexible type. A person must be more 
than human not to respond to the winsome- 
ness and attractiveness of the favored ones. 
Yet the teacher must be so well established 
in the principles of justice and impartiality 
that no one will be able to detect the slightest 
difference in the treatment of these various 
types of pupils; at least the difference in 
treatment should not favor those to whom 
the greater blessings have already been given. 
The fact that the pupils are looking for the 
teacher to show favoritism should put him 
especially on his guard. 
The second danger threatening the teacher , 
is the tendency to identify himself with the \ 
rules of the school and to consider every 
infringement of the rules as a_personal 
offense against him. “‘T am the rules,’’ he 
is tempted to say, ‘‘and the child that breaks 
<
-P-A-G-E-86
  
88 The Personality 
  a rule shows disrespect to me.’’? This atti- 
tude is wrong. The teacher should keep him- 
self apart from the rules and treat them, so 
far as possible, as the judge does the law,— 
as wholly impersonal. By so doing he will 
be less inclined to develop ill-will or grudges 
against the ‘‘bad boy’’ who cannot keep the 
rules of school or home. A teacher is lost 
who begins to cherish grudges. 
A third and most serious mistake which 
a teacher is likely to commit is to fail to look , 
at_all questions of misdemeanor and lapses _ 
of conduct from the pupil’s point of view. 
A jury gets both sides of the case carefully 
and painstakingly presented to it by wit- 
nesses and attorneys for the plaintiff and 
for the defendant, and the judge gives’ the 
law which applies. The jury is then called 
upon to render a verdict. To the teacher 
falls the hard task of being the attorney for 
both sides in the controversy, the judge and 
jury as well; as such, he must know how and 
what the offender, and often the school in j 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  
Of the Teacher 89 
general, think about the matter. His side 
looms up large and it requires a ‘high sense 
of justice and a good degree of imagination 
to look at the matter from the children’s 
point of view. 
We teachers must constantly remind our- 
selves that our pupils do not and cannot look 
at matters of discipline from our point of 
view. What seems just to us may, and often 
does, seem unjust to them. There are but 
few of us who cannot recall instances in our 
school life where we honestly thought the 
teacher wholly wrong and unjust; and in 
some, if not all cases, we hold the same 
opinion to-day. No doubt the opinion of 
our school-days was wrong in some cases, if 
not all, but our experience should lead us to 
do our best to get the point of view of our 
pupils, for our reproofs and punishments lose 
much of their moral value if our pupils 
believe them to be unjust. 
Here is where sympathy and sincerity 
codperate. Sympathy enables us to get the
-P-A-G-E-88
    
90 The Personality   
pupils’ point of view, and sincerity of heart 
gives the unchanging purpose to deal justly. 
I know of no words which are more fitting 
to close this discussion than the following 
from David P. Page on ‘‘The Spirit of the 
Teacher’’: 
‘Perhaps the very first question that the 
honest individual will ask himself as he pro- 
poses to assume a teacher’s office, or to enter 
upon preparation for it, will be, ‘What man- 
ner of spirit am I of?’ No question can be 
more important. I would by no means 
undervalue that degree of natural talent, of 
mental power, which all justly consider as 
desirable in the candidate for the teacher’s 
office. But the true spirit of the teacher, a 
spirit that seeks not alone pecuniary emolu- 
ment, but desires to be in the highest degree 
useful to those who are to be taught; a spirit 
that elevates above everything else the nature 
and capabilities of the human soul, and that 
trembles under the responsibility of attempt- 
ing to be its educator; a spirit that looks upon
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  
Of the Teacher 91 
gold as the contemptible dross of earth, when 
compared with that imperishable gem which 
is to be polished and brought out in heaven’s 
light to shine forever; a spirit that scorns 
all the rewards of earth and seeks the highest 
of all rewards,—an approving conscience and 
an approving God; a spirit that earnestly 
inquires what is right, that dreads to do what 
is wrong; a spirit that can reverence and 
recognize the handiwork of God in every child 
and that burns with the desire to be instru- 
mental in training it to the highest attain- 
ment of which it is capable; such a spirit is 
the first thing to be sought by the teacher, 
and without it the highest talent cannot make 
him truly excellent in his profession.’’

CHAPTER V 
DYNAMIC KNOWLEDGE 
If we have been right in our analysis, so 
far, sympathy and sincerity are two elements 
of character in a leader. But they alone do 
not constitute a commanding personality. 
They will insure a tactful and trustworthy 
man, who will be capable to the extent of his 
abilities, but his abilities may be slender. 
Leadership can no more stand on these two 
qualities than a stool can stand on two legs. 
There is needed a third element of character 
to lift a man above his fellows and qualify 
him for the captaincy among them. This 
element is intellectual rather than emotional 
or moral. To possess this quality a person 
must have what, for want of a better term, 
I shall call ‘‘dynamic knowledge.’? What 
sort of knowledge this is will appear as we 
proceed.

94 The Personality 
Leaders Have Dynamic Knowledge 
Great leaders have been men of superior 
intellectual power. In fact, I think with 
many, if not most of them, this characteristic 
impresses us first. What element of charac- 
ter comes first to your mind as you think of 
Bismarck, Gladstone, Webster, Alexander 
Hamilton, Chief Justice Marshall? I fancy 
that with most it will be the intellectual big- 
ness of these men. They were mental giants. 
They are like the occasional peaks that rise 
solitary and alone above a mountain range. 
I never look at the face of Webster, 
Gladstone, or Bismarck,—stern, rugged and 
seamed with thought as a mountain peak is 
searred by torrents,—without a thrill of awe 
akin to that which steals over me when I look 
at the Jungfrau or the Matterhorn. 
When the Greeks would represent the 
_ great Zeus, the father and king of gods and 
men, their highest conception of ruler and 
leader, they made a noble statue seventy feet 
high of gold and ivory. They crowned his
-P-A-G-E-93
  
Of the Teacher 95 
head with a mass of curly hair, a symbol of 
strength. A curly beard covered his face. 
In his left hand was a statue of winged vic- 
tory. In his right hand he held aloft a cluster 
of thunderbolts. From his face, stern yet 
benignant, there looked forth justice, wisdom 
and strength. Lacking any one of these 
attributes, Zeus could not have been ‘‘king 
of gods and men.’’ 
Nature of Dynamic Knowledge . 
Now, the intellectual quality of which I 
have been speaking is not covered by the 
word knowledge as it is commonly used. It 
does not mean mere acquaintance with facts. 
It means quite as much the ability to use 
facts. It means knowledge that is not only 
usable, but used. ‘‘Knowledge is power,’’ 
is an oft-quoted adage. It has enough truth 
in it to justify its existence. In fact, 
it is wholly true if we make the word suffi- 
ciently inclusive. If, however, knowledge 
means information merely, if it connotes 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  
96 The Personality 
facts shorn of the dynamic element which 
puts them to work, then the ancient adage 
is wholly false. An accumulation of knowl- 
edge that is not put to use is not power; it 
is as dead as a door nail, which Dickens 
opined was the deadest piece of ironmongery 
in the world. ‘ 
Such knowledge comes as near . being 
power as the stuffed specimens in a museum 
come to being animals. ‘‘Hyes have they, 
but they see not; they have ears, but they 
hear not, neither speak they through their 
throats.’? Facts are tools. They are worth- 
less until put to work. The multiplication 
table is the most useless and helpless thing 
in the world until some one comes along and 
puts it to doing something. We have heard 
much sickly sentimentality about knowledge 
for knowledge’s sake, art for art’s sake, cul- 
ture for culture’s sake. What a delightful 
museum of stuffed animals they would make! 
Knowledge, art and culture do not exist 
for themselves, but for humanity. They are
-P-A-G-E-95
ee 
Of the Teacher 97 
in the world to make it a better place for 
human beings to dwell, and they fail of their 
mission if they do not do this. They are 
dynamic elements of society, making always 
for a higher ideal. 
The intellectual strength which we find 
in leaders has clearly, then, two elements: 
~ knowledge of facts, and the ability to put / 
this knowledge to work,—that is, executive 
ability. They complement each other. One ° 
without the other is ineffective. The best 
informed physicians are not always the best 
practitioners; the best read lawyers are not 
invariably the ones who get the big cases; 
the honor man in college may never be heard 
from after commencement day. A man must 
have more than a chest full of tools; he 
must have ability to use them. On the other 
hand, a skillful surgeon without a knowledge 
of anatomy, or a great lawyer without a 
knowledge of law, is an impossibility. 
Dynamic knowledge is knowledge which 
has in it power for accomplishment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  98 The Personality   
Dynamic Knowledge Gives Confidence 
Dynamic knowledge gives confidence to 
the leader. He believes in himself because 
he knows. With what seeming recklessness a 
skilled surgeon cuts and mutilates the human 
body! What is the basis of his confidence? 
An exact and minute knowledge of human 
anatomy. He knows the exact location of 
every organ and nerve and blood-vessel. He 
knows where and how deeply he may cut. 
It is reported that General Grant at the close 
of a council with his generals, at which all 
had advised against advance, quietly said, 
‘“We shall move forward at daybreak.’’ His 
superior insight into the science of war gave 
him confidence to go contrary to the advice 
of his generals. Columbus’s heroic course 
in sailing west even after his most trusted 
officers advised returning, has been called a 
sublime act of faith. True; but faith, not in 
luck, nor yet in God, but in his own conclu- 
sions based on the many evidences that there 
was land in the west. He had knowledge, not 
sight knowledge, but thought knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
Of the Teacher oD 
  
Iam aware that there is a confidence born 
of conceit and fed by ignorance. ‘‘Fools 
rush in where angels fear to tread’’ has the 
experience of the race behind it. I have 
known many relatively inexperienced teach- 
ers to apply for positions that only persons 
of large preparation and wide experience 
could fill. But we need not concern ourselves 
with this species of confidence except to 
avoid it. If it is given work to do it even- 
tuates in failure. Confidence that is calm, 
straight-visioned, courageous and successful, 
springs from knowledge that is sound and 
workable. 
A leader’s knowledge breeds confidence 
in others. A few years ago I took my son 
to a doctor of whom I knew but little, for 
an examination of his throat. <A slight opera- 
tion seemed necessary. I went with some 
doubt as to the doctor’s ability. As I watched 
him deftly handle his instruments and with 
confident precision go through the various 
steps of the operation, my doubts vanished.

His knowledge and confidence inspired con- 
fidence in me. A single betrayal of ignorance 
on the part of a leader makes his followers 
suspicious of his abilities. Let the evidences 
of ignorance multiply and suspicion ripens 
into conviction of his incapacity. 
We, as a race, are like an army invading 
a strange and unsettled country of forests 
and rivers, of deserts and morasses, of moun- 
tains and plains. The scientists, statesmen, 
philosophers and poets are the scouts and 
pioneers who are pushing into the unknown 
regions, blazing trails and making roads for 
the main army. We follow one of these 
scouts so long and so far as his trail seems 
safe and his knowledge sure. But when his 
trail leads us into morasses and swamps, or 
up against impassable mountain barriers, or 
when he begins to doubt, to hesitate, and to 
take the back track, we lose confidence in him 
and turn to some other guide who gives better 
assurance of leading us safely on.

Dynamic Knowledge a Necessity 
Now, as I have before asserted, the 
Lec or is a leader. To the children he is 
world of knowledge; and that he m ay lead 
‘successfully and expeditiously, with the least 
waste of time and energy to the pupils, he 
must know the To put it differently, 
that he can put_ e use here and now. ‘There 
are three factors : in_the school problem: 
knowledgé, the teacher! and the child; and. 
the first two exist for the last. The teacher, 
then, must be able to use 
way to stimulate the m : 
pupils. ‘‘One of the qualifications of an ead 
teacher,’ says Professor Palmer, ‘‘is the 
ability to invigorate life through learning.” 
That is what Socrates did. That is what 
Arnold and Agassiz did. That is what every 
great teacher has done. That is what every 
teacher should do. 
Now, how impossible is this task to one     
-P-A-G-E-100
  
  
102 The Personality 
who has not the ‘‘learning,’? who has a 
meager preparation for his work, and con- 
sequently no large bank account of accumu- 
lated knowledge against which to check! 
A great teacher, like a great merchant, must 
have a large deposit of capital against which 
he may draw in case of emergency. Too 
many are like the junk-man who must make 
a deposit before he can check out fifty cents. 
Such a teacher is like Mother Hubbard’s cup- 
board, ‘‘bare,’’ and the pupils, like the good 
mother’s dog, remain hungry. 
That thousands of children in America, 
in both our common schools and high schools, 
are going to relatively empty cupboards day 
after day, is a lamentable fact. This must 
be true as long as misses of seventeen, not 
yet through high school, are allowed to under- 
take the important task of teaching. We 
would disapprove of so immature a girl 
becoming the physical mother of one child, 
but we absurdly allow her to become the 
intellectual and spiritual mother of a score
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  
Of the Teacher 103 
of children. Nothing would put added life, 
power and efficiency into our schools like 
a pronounced advance in the intellectual 
requirement for teachers. 
Knowledge represents the accumulated 
wisdom which the race has gathered on its 
long and toilsome journey through the ages. 
Whatever of science and invention, of litera- 
ture, and art, of government and religion, 
humanity has found beneficial and contribu- 
tory to its well-being, it has preserved and, 
through the home, the church, the school, and 
other agencies, is passing over to the on- 
coming generations. The school is the special 
institution which society has created and 
supports as a means of assisting the child 
to acquire enough of the accumulated know]- 
edge of the race to enable him to be a helpful 
member of society. The teacher is the agent 
for bringing knowledge and the child together. 
In order to be an effective agent he must 
know and understand both the child and the 
knowledge. He must be able to use knowledge 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
    
  
104 The Personality 
in such a way as to stimulate and inform the 
mind of the child. 
Poverty of Knowledge 
This poverty of knowledge, this leanness 
of resources, is a fruitful cause of failure in 
controlling a school. If the teacher does not 
invigorate and direct the life of his pupils 
somebody or something else will. ‘‘Satan 
finds work for idle hands to do’’ is good 
theology, for the teacher at any rate. It isa 
daily contest between Satan and the teacher, 
with the odds in favor of Satan in too many 
cases. Satan never lacks in resources. He 
always has something interesting to suggest. 
Alas, not so with many teachers. They are 
bankrupt. They are like a young man of 
limited preparation who called at my office 
a few years ago for advice, for he was having 
difficulty in managing his school. In order 
to get some light on the situation I let him 
do the talking. Finally he said, ‘‘One thing 
I have determined,—I shall make them be-
-P-A-G-E-103
  
Of the Teacher 105 
have, if I don’t teach them a thing.’’ I sug- 
gested that he try to lead them to behave by 
teaching them something; that he forestall 
Satan by finding something interesting for 
idle hands and minds. 
Here is the secret of controlling a school. 
Pupils who have had an inspiring recitation 
in which the teacher has opened up to them 
new regions of knowledge and quickened their 
desire to go up and possess the land, and 
who have been sent to their seats with definite 
things to do to conquer the new country, will 
not be idle or mischievous. The tactful and 
resourceful teacher never has any trouble in 
discipline. His keen eye detects unrest and 
disorder while it is yet formless, as the expe- 
rienced mariner detects the approaching 
storm in a few gusts of wind and a few 
stray clouds. A new story, a question about 
birds or weather, or trees, or no matter what, 
and the energies of the school, which were 
beginning to flow in wrong channels, are 
diverted to right ones. ‘‘Invigorate life 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
    
106 The Personality 
through learning,’’—what a fine statement of 
the great work of the teacher ! 
Character of Knowledge Required 
Knowledge, we have said, gives a leader 
confidence in himself and leads others to have 
confidence in him. This applies to the teacher 
as truly as to a general or a statesman. 
A teacher who feels that he has a mastery 
of the day’s lessons, who knows what he is 
to teach and how he proposes to go about it, 
comes before his classes with a confident and 
not an apologetic air. He is delighted to 
come up against the difficult places; he loves 
the tangles; the hard problems which make 
the pupil surrender are his opportunity. He 
is master. He has the assurance and free- 
dom which come from mastery. The pupils 
feel that he is master. They respect his 
knowledge and skill and cheerfully accept his 
leadership. 
But the teacher’s knowledge should go 
beyond the demands of the text taught. It is
-P-A-G-E-105
  Of the Teacher 107 
  this ‘‘beyond’’ knowledge, this knowledge 
plus, which really measures his bigness and 
fitness. He should know more about geog- 
raphy and history than the school books con- 
tain, and he should open this larger world 
to his pupils. Many pupils think that the 
sum total of knowledge is contained in the 
school texts. Years ago, when I was teaching 
college history, students just entering would 
sometimes ask me if they must take history 
over. ‘‘I had a fine teacher and used such 
and such a text,’’ they would say, ‘‘and my 
mark was good.’”’ Invariably my reply was, 
*‘Go to the library, find the history alcove, 
look over the books there and bring me a list 
of the ones you have read.’’ It was effective. 
They were willing to ‘‘take history over.’’ 
Dynamic Knowledge Reduces Waste 
Dynamic knowledge in the teacher reduces 
the waste in education. In one respect the 
school is like a manufacturing plant. The 
business of a factory is to turn out a finished
-P-A-G-E-106
    
  108 The Personality 
product with the least waste of time and 
material, and analogously the business of the 
school is to turn out its product, efficient 
men and women, with the least possible loss 
of time and material. This means with the 
least waste of the pupils’ time in school and 
the loss of the fewest number of pupils from 
school until they are prepared to be helpful 
members of society. 
That there is an enormous loss of pupils 
from the schools before they are fitted for 
efficient citizenship is known to all who have 
considered the matter. It is safe to say that, 
taking the entire country into account, not 
more than one-half of the children who enter 
the first grade finish the sixth. Sickness and 
death account for part of this frightful loss. 
The economic necessity of the home takes out 
a large number, and the greed of parents 
who want to make money from their chil- 
dren’s labor removes more. Lax compulsory 
attendance laws and more lax enforcement 
account for much of this evil. But there is
-P-A-G-E-107
  
  
Of the Teacher 109 
still another fruitful cause of this waste of 
the golden years of childhood, and that is the 
lack of such teaching as would make school 
attractive and practical. 
Many children, especially boys, are un- 
happy and dissatisfied in school because the 
work does not appeal to them. The fault lies 
largely in the teachers. They do not know 
enough about the practical things of life 
They are limited to what the text-books con- 
tain, and too often they are not masters of 
the texts. The material taught is abstract 
and bookish. It does not smack of the con- 
erete and real. It has little relation to the 
life which the boys are living now. The 
natural result follows: the boys, who by 
nature love to do real things instead of 
thinking about abstract ones, cannot ‘‘con- 
nect up’’ with school work, and leave as soon 
as possible. 
The teacher who can connect the history 
and civics of the school with the city govern- 
ment, the town meeting, state and national  
-P-A-G-E-108
    
110 The Personality 
elections, the Panama canal, the irrigation of 
arid lands, and other events of current inter- 
est; who can relate arithmetic to the meat bill 
and clothing bill of the household, or to the 
buying and selling on the farm; who can 
make geography explain the breakfast table, 
the crops raised on the farm, and the railroad 
over which the crops are shipped, is a teacher 
whose knowledge is dynamic. He will get a 
tenacious grip on the interest of the boy as 
well as the girl, and will reduce to a minimum 
the number who leave school because it does 
not appeal to them. 
The schools not only lose children too 
early, but to an alarming degree waste the 
time of children in school. Did you ever con- 
sider the loss of time due to lax and ineffect- 
ive methods in the passing of classes?) An 
expeditious teacher will change classes in 
half a minute. I have seen teachers take 
three minutes for the same operation. In 
half of the schools of the country most of 
the recitations are from ten to twenty
-P-A-G-E-109
  
  
Of the Teacher 111 
minutes long. Here is, then, a possible loss 
of from one-fifth to one-third of the time 
given to a majority of the classes. 
‘We must add to this waste due to lack of 
precision in the passing of classes, the loss 
of time, too common, in getting into the real 
work of the recitation. Have you not seen 
teachers who skirmished for a third of the 
recitation period before they came in striking 
distance of the lesson? There was a lack of 
that definiteness and directness which comes 
from certainty as to what is to be done and 
how it is to be accomplished. Nebulous 
knowledge of what is to be taught and in- 
effective methods of management and of 
teaching are the prime sources of waste in 
school. 
It is conceded by American educators 
that a boy of sixteen who has been educated 
in the schools of Germany is equal in attain- 
ment to the average boy of eighteen trained 
in the American school. This loss of two 
years is due largely to the superior prepara- 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
    
112 The Personality 
tion of the German teacher. Practically one- 
fifth of the teachers in America every year 
are doing their first teaching. Many of these 
have had limited academic training, and still 
more have had no professional training in 
the methods of managing a school and teach- 
ing the various school subjects. Under these 
conditions it is no wonder that there is a 
painful and disheartening loss of time and 
money in public education. Public opinion 
should be aroused on this matter. Teachers ° 
and parents should combine to bring about 
conditions which will insure trained teachers 
for the schools and sufficient pay to tempt to 
the profession the most’ capable men and 
women. 
In conclusion let me say that it is impos- 
sible to over-emphasize the value of dynamic 
knowledge in the personality of the teacher. 
It is not everything, but it is the element most 
lacking in the teachers of America. As a 
class, teachers are genuine in character and 
kindly of heart and faithful to their duties.
-P-A-G-E-111
  
Of the Teacher 113 
They do their best. They lack in knowledge 
that is broad, exact and vital, and in skill 
that is sure and expeditious. They need 
higher ideals of the preparation which a 
teacher should have. They are too easily 
satisfied with their attainments. They have 
not yet seen clearly the moral wrong done 
to boys and girls when they are robbed of 
the golden opportunity of childhood and 
youth through the inefficiency of the school. 
Dynamic knowledge is power to achieve, and 
such power is an essential element in the 
personality of the teacher.

CHAPTER VI 
GOOD BREEDING 
Besides the basic virtues which we have 
been discussing, there are other attributes 
of personality which, while not so vital to 
worthiness of character, are nevertheless 
essential in one who essays to be a companion 
and teacher of the young. Among these are 
those evidences of good breeding which 
appear in the personal manner, the dress, 
the speech of a person, and in his recognition 
of the amenities of life. 
These things have a commercial value 
which few young men and women recognize. 
In my experience as head of a normal school 
T have received hundreds, of letters of inquiry 
from school boards and superintendents con- 
cerning candidates for position; and the four 
qualifications usually insisted upon in a 
teacher are character, scholarship, ability to
-P-A-G-E-114
    
116 The Personality 
teach, and refinement in manner and dress. 
The best positions can be had by no other 
sort of person. I ‘have known many young 
men and women who have failed to secure the 
positions that character and general ability 
clearly qualified them to fill, because they 
lacked refinement in dress and manner. 
I have advised young people to give up their 
purpose to teach, simply because they lacked, 
and, I believed, would never be able to 
acquire, the social refinements necessary to a 
teacher. 
Personal Appearance 
. Aman: or woman who has a good bearing, 
who dresses appropriately and whose general 
appearance is pleasing, has a decided advan- 
tage before a superintendent, a school board, 
or a school, over one who is lacking in these 
particulars. A man who is careless about 
his personal appearance, whose linen is 
soiled, whose shoes are not polished, whose 
clothes are untidy, whose general appearance, 
from finger-nails to shirt front, gives evidence
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Of the Teacher 117 
of his disregard for the standards which 
cultivated society sets up for a gentleman, 
need never look for great advancement in 
the teaching profession. And it is equally 
certain that_a woman who makes personal 
application for a position in ‘‘gloves that 
once were white’’ or in gloves of any color 
that_once were whole, or in any attire _be- 
speaking a serious lack of taste, has taken_ 
great chances of wasting her time and money. 
No teacher should be conspicuous either for 
the neglect she gives her personal appear- 
ance nor for the over-attention she puts on it. 
One extreme is quite as objectionable as the 
other. To dress appropriately is an art which 
should claim the attention of every young 
man and every young woman, and especially 
of those who are. teachers or are preparing 
to become teachers. 
Good Form in Letter Writing, Etc. 
It should also be observed that many per- 
sons make written applications to school
-P-A-G-E-116
    
118 The Personality 
officers and superintendents, and that social 
and business forms regulate such correspond- 
ence quite as much as custom regulates dress 
and etiquette. To be able to write a letter 
of application that shall in a modest way 
state what a school officer needs to know 
about a candidate, and that in stationery and 
composition conforms to social standard, is 
no mean accomplishment, as anyone knows 
who annually reads scores of letters from 
applicants for positions. An ‘‘exhibit’’ of a 
collection of letters of application would be 
interesting and instructive both as to what is 
excellent and what should be avoided. 
I recently received a letter of application 
from a woman of unusual scholarship and 
experience; moreover, her testimonials were 
uncommonly strong; but her letter was writ- 
ten on a nondescript piece of stationery, in 
2, careless and untidy manner, and I gave 
her no consideration. Another energetic and 
enterprising young woman, a graduate of »
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  
Of the Teacher 119 
  
college of good repute, recently wrote me 
about as: follows: 
“Am a graduate of X College. Have 
studied Expression under Professor Y——. 
Have coached winning speakers. Think I 
could interest you.’’ She did not have an 
opportunity to ‘‘interest’’ me, as I have no 
time for candidates who omit the subjects   
from their sentences. A teacher should be 
as careful to send her letter of application 
in appropriate attire as she would be to 
appear in appropriate dress if she made a 
personal application. 
Observance of Social Forms 
Of equal, or perhaps of greater impor- 
tance than personal appearance, are personal 
manners. To be well-mannered stamps one 
as a gentleman or a lady, and to be a gentle- 
man or a lady, in the true meaning of the 
terms, is worthy the ambition and effort of 
every one. The difference between a com- 
munity of savages and a community of cul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  
120 The Personality 
tured people does not lie wholly in the latter’s 
intellectual superiority, but fully as much in 
its respect for the gentle courtesies and 
refinements of life. Many estimable people 
are totally regardless of even’ the most 
obvious social forms. I have known admir- 
able teachers who did not think it worth while 
to return calls, to send acceptances or regrets 
in reply to formal invitations, to give heed 
to be prompt when guests at a dinner, or to 
make ‘‘party calls’’ afterwards on a hostess. 
To be remiss in such social courtesies is to 
cause comment and to reflect on one’s good 
breeding. Young men are especially sinners 
against the rules of social etiquette. They 
are often quite oblivious of them, or they look 
upon them with a species of mild contempt, 
as something quite beneath the attention of 
a strong, independent manhood. This atti- 
tude of mind is wholly wrong and limits the 
possibilities of anyone who holds it. Society 
will not and should not tolerate a boor. A 
person who has so little regard for culti-
-P-A-G-E-119
    
Of the Teacher 121 
vated society that he will not attempt to 
qualify himself to become an agreeable mem- 
ber, should not expect much consideration, 
and certainly should not be a teacher. I am 
not pleading for snobbery or foppery, but 
for culture and refinement in men and women. 
Good English 
If one should give heed to his manners 
and dress, much more should he give heed to 
his speech. It would be difficult to over- 
estimate the importance to a teacher of a 
command of English that is at once correct, 
effective and graceful. <A great thought or 
a fine sentiment in slovenly English is like 
a genius in soiled linen; our attention is 
attracted from the thought to its garb as 
from the genius to his clothes. I have one 
perpetual and bitter quarrel with slang, and 
that is because of its tendency to impoverish

slang and correct English, and too often they 
become skilled in the wrong one. 
Be sure your sin will find you out; you 
cannot use slang and slovenly English in 
daily conversation without paying the pen- 
alty. The goblin of habit will get you. At 
the very moment when you desire to appear 
at your best your speech will betray you. 
How many times have I seen young men and 
women humiliated (at least they should have 
been) by using slang in company where such 
language was most inappropriate! Many 
times the teachers in normal schools are 
compelled to criticise the use of slang on 
the part of practice teachers. I have known 
students, and high school graduates at that, 
who were withdrawn from practice teaching 
because of their inability to use good English. 
Slang expressions kept creeping into their 
conversation in the schoolroom. The goblin 
of habit caught them. On the other hand, 
few characteristics of a teacher are more 
quickly noticed by a good superintendent 
\
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Of the Teacher 123 
than his ability to use good English; and as 
I have already said, this ability counts for 
promotion. 
Even were it otherwise, I should still put 
in a plea for our noble language and urge 
upon every teacher the duty of preserving 
to future generations its dignity and its 
- beauty, undiminished and uncorrupted. Our 
mother tongue is one of our great inherit- 
ances. It is a priceless treasure. It is 
incomparable as a medium of expressing 
every shade of human thought and emotion. 
It proved equal to the genius of a Shake- 
speare and a Milton, a Thackeray and a 
Webster, an Emerson and a Tennyson. 
This language, which more than any other 
‘seems destined to become the world lan- 
guage, it is the especial duty of the school to 
keep pure and uncorrupted; but the schools 
will fail in this responsibility if the teachers 
are slack and indifferent in their use of their 
moter tongue. To be a master of good 
Zizglish should be a goal of daily effort.

The Voice 
Possibly you have heard a great artist’ 
sing a noble production in a foreign language. 
You did not understand a word, but you were 
enthralled by the beauty and power of her 
( wonderful voice. of all instruments of 
expression, the human voice is the most* 
‘ wonderful., We feel its possibilities when 
we hear a great singer or a great actor, but 
anfortunately we are too often neglectful of 
its value in common life. In America very 
a little attention is given to the speaking voice, 
even in normal schools. , This is a great mis- 
    
  take, and its results may be seen in almost 
any schoolroom. 
I have seen teachers who would have been 
“quite ideal had it not been for an unfortunate 
voice. I recall a delightful young woman, 
attractive in personality, charming in her 
. relation to children, effective in handling-both 
subject-matter and classes, whose work was 
marred by a sharp voice pitched several 
intervals above the normal. This one defect  
-P-A-G-E-123
  Of the Teacher 125 
was such a serious handicap that I would 
not give her a place in a school under my 
charge. The harsh, strident voice with a 
suggestion of the cicada, the loud, metallic 
voice typical of the old-style stump orator, 
the weak, vanishing, ineffective voice which 
does not carry conviction, are other types 
common in the schoolroom. (The difficulty of . 
. controlling a school is greatly augmented if 
‘the_teacher’s voice) has no authority and 
resolution in it. 
The unpleasant quality in the American 
voice has been often commented on both by 
foreigners afid Americans who are familiar 
with the rich tones of the English women. 
The difference has been charged by some to 
climate, but I think it due rather to imitation, 
Children acquire tones of voice quite as they 
learn language, through imitation of what 
they hear. The English child has better 
models than has the American child. Where 
the difference between American and Eng- 
lish voices originated I am unable to say. To  
-P-A-G-E-124
  126 The Personality 
offset the results of imitation, schools for 
training of teachers should give more atten- 
tion than they are now doing to training the 
voices of those who are to serve as models 
for the young. The burden of improvement 
lies with them. A teacher should be able to 
detect and assist in correcting unfortunate 
qualities in the voices of children; she at 
least should not be a ‘‘horrible example’’ of 
what should be avoided. 
It may seem to some that I am over- 
emphasizing what in reality are relatively 
insignificant items. Are social conventionali- 
ties and language and voice so very essential, 
after all, in the personality of a teacher? 
They certainly are, and for two very good 
reasons, in addition to the purely commer- 
cial ones which I mentioned at the opening 
of the chapter; first, they are refinements of 
life which the young should acquire. All 
right-minded parents want their children to 
possess them, and society in general desires 
its members to have them. They are social
-P-A-G-E-125
  Of the Teacher 127 
  and economic assets to anyone who acquires 
them. They are therefore accomplishments 
to which a child has a clear right, and con- 
sequently should be taught in the school. 
Tnconscious Influence 
The second reason why the teachers 
should possess these refinements lies in the 
manner by which they are most effectively 
taught by the teacher and taken on by the 
child; namely, through the unconscious life 
of the teacher and the unconscious imitation 
of the child. The tendency to imitate is one 
of the striking characteristics of children. 
It is one effective means of their adjustment 
to the world. They start life with no lan- 
guage, no manners, no methods of dealing 
with the situations they meet; but nature has 
given them the imitative instinct. They are 
unconsciously the keenest observers and the 
cleverest mimics, and, chameleon-like, easily 
take the color of their surroundings. Observe 
a group of children at play at ‘‘keeping  
-P-A-G-E-126
  
128 . The Personality 
house’’ or ‘‘keeping school’’ or ‘‘going call- 
ing’’ or ‘‘tea party,’’? and note how they 
reproduce the niceties of manner and voice 
which they have seen in their elders. Silently, 
as flowers drink in the dew, children absorb 
the manners of speech and behavior which 
they hear and see. Some things may be 
taught by rule and precept, but true refine- 
ment of character comes best by contagion. 
It is silently and unconsciously taken in. 
I am not saying that direct instruction in 
manners and morals has no value, for I 
believe it has, but I am saying it will have 
little value if not reinforced by the daily 
unconscious life of the teacher; while, on the 
other hand, a refined teacher will infuse her 
ideals into her children though no word of 
precept be spoken. ‘‘It is worth the hour 
to be in her class in the presence of her 
charming and refined womanhood,’”’ said a 
student of a certain teacher of literature. 
‘One lasting benefit I got from his class was 
an appreciation of beautiful English,’’ said 
‘
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Of the Teacher 129 
another student of a teacher of psychology. 
Says Bishop Huntington: ‘‘Still another of 
the silent but formative agencies in education 
is that combination of physical signs and 
motions which we designate in the aggregate 
as manners.”” 
What I said of the way by which children 
acquire speech and manners is true of adults. 
We were once children. We are still children 
in that we are yet influenced by our sur- 
roundings. But we teachers are now old 
enough to determine to a considerable degree 
what elements in our environment we shall 
appropriate and what reject. I say ‘‘to a 
considerable degree,’’ for we are not omnipo- 
tent in this respect. 
Cultivation of a Critical Attitude 
The first step toward self-improvement in 
speech and manner is to cultivate a critical 
attitude toward ourselves and others. Our 
habits tend to become unconscious, and we 
must forcibly drag them before our conscious-
-P-A-G-E-128
  
130 The Personality 
ness for inspection. Or, to put it differently, 
we must keep the searchlight of consciousness 
playing upon our habits of dress and manner 
and speech, lest we fall into unfortunate prac- 
tices. And we must also be observant of 
others in these regards, for unless we become 
sensitive-minded in these particulars we are 
lost. 
Let me, however, throw in a word of 
caution against over-doing. One can become 
a disagreeable faddist in this direction as in 
any other. I have known people to miss the 
uplift of a lecture because the speaker said 
‘“‘each one should do their duty’’ instead 
of ‘‘each one’ should do his duty.’’? It was 
such a faddist who at the close of a sermon 
by Henry Ward Beecher called Beecher’s 
attention to some errors in speech of which 
the great preacher had been guilty. ‘‘Young 
man,’’ said Beecher in reply, ‘‘when the Eng- 
lish language gets in my way it stands no 
chance.’’ It was a just rebuke. We must be 
careful not to let the spots on the sun blind 
us to its brightness.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
“Of the Teacher 131 
Practice 
The second rule of procedure is to practice 
good manners and good English. Let no 
opportunity go unimproved. Opportunities 
are always ours. Our daily life and inter- 
course offer ample scope. We need no special 
occasions. A person who in the common and 
ordinary situations of life unfailingly strives 
to be refined in manner and speech, will be 
ready for occasions when they come; and it 
is just as certain that one who is neglectful 
of these matters in daily life will fail at the 
critical moment. 
“Most of us catch better than we 
can learn,’’? says Professor George Herbert 
Palmer in his monograph on ‘‘Self-Culture 
in English,’? and consequently he advises 
every one who is striving to improve his com- 
mand of language to associate as much as 
possible with those who are masters of good 
English. What Professor Palmer says re- 
garding the acquisition of language applies 
equally well to all refinements of character.
-P-A-G-E-130
    
132 The Personality 
One should expose himself as much as pos- 
sible to the contagion of good breeding. 
Lacking opportunities to associate very 
muctvith persons of culture and refinement, 
one is driven to the alternative of procuring 
manuals of good usage in oral and written 
speech, and in social forms, and of making 
a study of them much as he would of history 
or literature. Fortunately, many household 
journals very commonly taken throughout 
the country contain from time to time 
admirable suggestions relative to the topics 
discussed in this chapter. 
‘What we want in the nation we should 
put into the schools, and what we want 
in the schools should be in the teachers. 
We teachers cannot escape being taken as 
models, however much we desire it; the laws 
of human nature forbid. Nor would we wish 
to be without influence over our pupils. 
Teaching would be robbed of its joy and its 
glory were children unresponsive to the 
influence which radiates from the teacher’s

personality. This being so, every teacher 
should be animated by a quenchless ambition 
to be in manner and speech as well as in 
scholarship and character a not unworthy 
example to his pupils. 
1. PROBLEMS FOR THE TEACHER 
From your observation would you say that, in 
general, people give too little or too much at- 
tention to refinement in manners? 
Did you ever break up a habit of using incorrect 
English? How? 
To what extent have you acquired the dictionary 
habit ? 
Are you sensitive to incorrect speech in others? 
Make a list of the most common errors in Eng- 
lish made by your pupils. 
What special measures are you taking to correct 
them ? 
Can you write an invitation? An acceptance? 
A letter of application for a position? Can 
your grammar grade pupils do so? 
Observe the amount of slang used by your com- 
panions; by yourself. 
What special means are you using to give your 
pupils command of spoken English?

CHAPTER VII 
GROWTH IN PERSONALITY 
We have completed our analysis of per- 
sonality. It might have been more minute. 
Enough, however, has been said to indicate 
the main lines of strength that make efficiency 
in leadership. A man who has the insight 
into human nature which sympathy alone can 
give, who has the sincerity of character which 
insures uprightness of life and tenacity of 
purpose, who is rich in dynamic knowledge 
which translates itself into work, cannot fail 
to win leadership. He will be a leader in 
spite of his desires to the contrary, for the 
world is looking for just such men. Such are 
the personalities out of which the best teach- 
ers are made, for, as I have said before, 
Vteaching is leadership. 
And now we have come to the last vital 
question, can such a personality be devel-
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  Of the Teacher 135 
oped, and if so, how? I said at the outset 
that unless personality could be developed 
there would be little or no value in continuing 
the discussion. I also said that I am a firm 
believer in the possibilities of growth in the 
qualities that make strong and efficient man- 
hood and womanhood. 
Heredity 
We must, without question, recognize the 
limitation set by heredity. In giving us our 
physical and mental endowments, nature sets 
boundaries beyond which we may not pass. 
She limits our height and our weight; she 
sets restrictions on our strength and our 
fleetness. In a like way she prescribes our 
mental powers. We all have a_ limited 
capacity for memory, for thought, or for 
emotions. In short, we are finite, not infinite. 
We are human beings, not gods. ‘‘One star 
differeth from another star in glory,’’ so also 
does one mind differ from another mind in 
‘capacity and power. We occasionally see 
\ 
i,  
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  136 The Personality 
gigantic intellects just as we occasionally see 
gigantic bodies. We occasionally also see 
dwarfed minds as we see dwarfed bodies. 
We are not, however, so much concerned with 
these extremes, which are exceptional, as we 
are with the great mass of humanity that 
lies between these extremes. The young man 
and the young woman of average ability are 
the ones to whom I am speaking, though 
what is to follow is applicable to every 
human mind. 
I have said that nature has set limits 
beyond which we cannot pass. Some people 
there are who seize upon this fact as an 
excuse for making no effort whatever. They 
lay the blame for all their littleness and 
meanness to heredity. ‘It’s in the blood,” is 
their justification for amounting to so little. 
“T am naturally quick-tempered,’’ or, ‘‘My 
father could not memorize dates,’’ or, ‘‘Our 
whole family lives for a good time,’’ are 
samples of the excuses we hear in palliation 
of weakness and inefficiency.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Of the Teacher 137 
Now, I am willing to maintain that 
heredity has done quite as much for most 
of us as we have done for ourselves. Who 
will contend that he has lived up to his best? 
Few teachers will assert that they have been 
as studious as they might have been, or as 
genuine as they should have been. There is 
nothing gained by mourning the fact that we 
have but one talent while another has five. 
The glory lies in making our one talent grow 
to five by the right use. Let us put away our 
useless lamentations over our heredity and 
get to work to make the most of what we have. 
“Act well thy part, there all the honor lies.” Zs 
Desire as a Condition of Self-Improvement 
And now to our problem, how to develop 
character. In the preceding chapter I gave 
some suggestions concerning self-improve- 
ment in. matters of speech, dress, and man- 
ners. It is my purpose in the present chap- 
ter to treat the subject in a more general 
way. The primary condition of  self-
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  
138 The Personality 
improvement is a robust desire for self- 
improvement. We found in Chapter I that 
feeling is necessary to action. Until we 
genuinely feel a want for an object there is 
little likelihood of our working to obtain it. 
Let us at once distinguish between a desire 
and a wish. They are no nearer kin than 
an oak and its shadow. The one is substan- 
tial and will float a human life; the other is 
mere form without substance. A wish never 
leads to action. We wish we were million- 
aires, the President of the United States, a 
famous singer or a celebrated writer, but we 
never expect to be, and make no effort to 
become, such. On a winter’s morning we 
wish we were up and dressed, but the room 
is cold_and we turn over and take another 
nap. (i is easy to wish for character and 
learning and wealth; it indulges our senti- 
ments and costs no effort. Wishing is as 
near as some people ever come to doing any- 
thing really worth while. I dare say they 
flatter themselves that this pale, sickly,
-P-A-G-E-137
  Of the Teacher 139 
nerveless wishing to be worthy and efficient 
is evidence of virtue, but they are self- 
deceived. It is as useless in the battle of 
life as the gilt on a soldier’s sword. Desire, 
on the other hand, is dynamic. It is charged 
with energy. (Desire gets up in the morning 
and goes to work, while wish takes another 
nap. Desire is the seed of which purpose is 
the flower and achievement the fruit. The 
initial step in the salvation of ourselves or 
another is a whole-hearted, robust desire for 
noble living. 
Desire, however, is only the beginning; to 
be of value it must work itself out in action; 
and action, to be effective, must be guided 
by intelligence. But where are we to get the 
intelligence that is equal to the great preb- 
lem of human destiny? I am sure that we 
all at times wish that there were formulas 
for solving the problem of human life as 
there are for resolving cube root and finding 
the volume of.a sphere. Human life would 
be so much easier. But it is an idle wish; 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
    
140 The Personality 
there are none, and it is fortunate indeed for 
our happiness that this is so. How hum- 
drum and utterly wearisome and unendurable 
existence would be were it not for the almost 
infinite possibilities that life contains. Let 
us be thankful that a kind Providence has 
not doomed us to a life of mathematical 
certitude. There is some risk in life as it is, 
some chance that we shall miss the mark on 
account of poor guns or poor marksmanship; 
but there is also the glorious possibility of 
hitting the ‘‘bull’s-eye.’’ 
Although human nature is not solvable by 
the law of mathematics, it is not for that 
reason beyond the realm of law. It is indeed 
under law—but biologic law, the law which 
governs all life. Now, while biologic laws are 
not so precise and exact as the laws of mathe- 
matics, they are sufficiently definite to enable 
us to lay down general rules for self- 
improvement, and I shall venture to state 
and discuss the most important of these rules.
-P-A-G-E-139
  
Of the Teacher 141   
Self-Examination 
The first essential for self-improvement 
is self-examination. It is evident we must 
know ourselves before we can take any 
rational step towards self-culture. A man 
should take an honest inventory of his abili- 
ties, physical, mental and temperamental, in 
order that he may know his weaknesses as 
well as his capabilities. This self-analysis 
is often difficult and disagreeable, but the one 
who has not the courage to make it is lacking 
in one of the essential elements of success. 
In his ‘‘Map of Life,’’ Lecky, the author of 
the ‘‘History of European Morals,’’ has the 
following paragraph on the wisdom of self- 
examination: ; 
“Of all the tasks set before man in life, 
the education and management of his char- 
acter is the most important, and in order that 
it may be successfully pursued it is necessary 
that he should make a calm and careful sur- 
vey of his own tendencies, unblinded either 
by the self-deception which conceals errors 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  
142 The Personality   
and magnifies: excellencies, or by the indis- 
eriminate pessimism which refuses to recog- 
nize his powers for good. He must avoid the 
fatalism which would persuade him that he 
has no power over his nature, and he must 
also clearly recognize that his power is not 
unlimited. Man is like a card player who 
receives from nature his cards—his disposi- 
tion, his circumstances, the strength or weak- 
ness of his will, and of his body. The game 
of life is one of blended chance and skill. 
The best player will be defeated if he has 
hopelessly bad cards, but in the long run the 
skill of the player will not fail to tell.”’ 
There are persons whose opinions are 
eminently’ worthy of consideration, who do 
not favor this sort of moral bookkeeping, on 
the ground that its tendency is to develop 
a morbid habit of self-examination which 
defeats the end it seeks. Our moral growth, 
they say, is like our physical growth—best 
accomplished when we give the least atten- 
tion to it. The way to develop one’s character,
-P-A-G-E-141
Of the Teacher 143. 
this view maintains, is to forget one’s self 
in laboring for a worthy cause. Not the in- 
ward look but the outward look should be 
the rule. The late Edward Everett Hale 
formed the Helping Hand society for young 
people on this philosophy, and gave them this 
motto: 
“To look up and not down, 
To look forward and not back, 
To look out and not in, and 
To lend a hand.” 
There is much truth in this view of 
character-building, for there are natures that. 
are morbidly subjective, whose eyes are con- 
stantly turned inward, watching their moral 
machinery to see how it is running,—giving, 
indeed, so much attention to the machine that: 
there is little left to give to the work which 
the machine is intended to do. Now, since 
our moral natures are not so nicely adjusted 
and so exact in their operations as a Swiss 
watch, these super-introspective people find 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    
144 The Personality   
ample cause for concern over their short- 
comings. Adolescent boys and girls of a. 
deeply religious temperament are perhaps 
especially inclined to morbid introspection, 
and for such the helping hand motto is the 
thing. But men and women in general can 
ill afford to drift on into life and through 
life without the habit of seriously taking 
stock of their natural capabilities and ten- 
dencies, and also of the success that the 
years bring in the development of the essen- 
tials of an agreeable and useful character. 
Many a knotted and twisted personality 
could have been avoided if honest self- 
examination had been made a habit of life. 
Since we have but one life, we should make 
it measure up to its largest possibilities. 
However, when it comes to the matter of 
choosing a calling there can be no debate as 
to the value of honest self-examination to 
determine our capabilities and limitations 
for any particular vocation. Each calling 
makes its special demands and this is strik-
-P-A-G-E-143
  
  
Of the Teacher 145 
ingly true of the professions that deal with 
human nature. One should not attempt to — 
be a teacher unless he has satisfied himself 
that he possesses the qualities of mind and 
heart that fit him to be a companion and 
teacher of childhood and youth. What 
these qualities are it was the mission of the 
preceding chapters to set forth. A misfit at 
raising potatoes, selling merchandise, run- 
ning a machine, trimming bonnets, or 
making dresses involves loss to but few, 
possibly only to one, and is easily remedied; 
but a misfit in a schoolroom means loss to 
many and for some pupils at least is not 
remediable. 
The Power of Ideals 
VA second rule for growth in personality 
is the selection of definite ideals for which 
to strive. ‘‘The most important fact in a 
man’s life is his ideals,’’ says Lecky. ‘‘If 
you know the ideals of a man you have ob- 
tained a true key to his nature. A man 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  
  146 The Personality 
with high ideals, who admires wisely and 
nobly, is never wholly base though he may 
fall into great vices. A man who worships 
the baser elements is in truth an idolater 
though he may have never bowed to an 
image of stone.’’ ‘‘As a man thinketh in 
his heart, so he is,’’ is the ‘‘law and the 
prophets’? of character building. Not the 
precepts of conduct which we may learn 
but the ideals of life which we cherish will 
determine ‘the nature of that life edifice 
which we call character. 
Ideals tell us not so much what a man is 
to-day as what he will be to-morrow. 
Change is the law of the universe. Nothing 
remains the same. Even the ‘‘changeless 
hills’? change. A human being is not sta- 
tionary—not for an hour. His body and his 
mind are constantly undergoing modifica- 
tions. His character is making hourly. 
The ideals which he cherishes, whether 
consciously or unconsciously, are determin- 
ing whether the change in his character is 
for good or ill.
-P-A-G-E-145
    
Of the Teacher 147   
Franklin’s Plan for Self-Improvement 
We attain few desirable things in life 
for which we do not make a conscious and 
hearty effort. The prizes of the world are 
not indiscriminately bestowed by Dame 
Fortune, but are won by intelligent and con- 
tinued striving, often against the most dis- 
heartening odds; and this applies to the 
prizes of character as well as of wealth, po- 
* sition or learning. If we knew the soul his- 
tory of the great men whom we call geniuses 
we should be surprised to learn through 
what toil and struggle, through what defeats 
and heartaches, through what despondencies 
- and despairs many of them wrought out 
their successes. A few have given us 
glimpses at their inner history. Benjamin 
Franklin was one of the more fortunate of 
our great men. His life had little of the 
tragic that I have suggested as often an 
accompaniment of genius, but he achieved 
his greatness not by good fortune or chance 
but by thoughtful and patient effort. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  
  148 The Personality 
his autobiography, written in his old age, he 
tells us of the method that he devised as a 
young man to develop his character and 
abilities. He made a list of the virtues, in 
all thirteen, which he thought were de- 
sirable, and systematically set about to cul- 
tivate them. He ruled a book with seven 
vertical spaces, one for each of the virtues 
he proposed to cultivate. 
In order to concentrate his attention on 
a single virtue at a time, he devoted a week 
to the careful practice of each of the thir- 
teen virtues in succession, while at the same 
time he also made a daily record of his suc- 
cess in practicing~the éther virtues by 
putting a little black dot in the proper 
space for each failure. This plan of exami- 
nation he carried on more or less regularly 
for several years. Of his scheme he says: 
“It may be well my posterity should be in- 
formed that to this little artifice, with the 
blessing of God, their ancestor owed the 
constant felicity of his life down to his
-P-A-G-E-147

seventy-ninth year in which this was 
written.’’ 
Few will be inclined to adopt Franklin’s 
plan for self-improvement in its entirety, 
but no one can afford to live without at 
least an occasional ‘‘taking stock’’ of his 
progress in building his character. One may 
form some estimate of the trend of his life 
by frankly and specifically answering for 
himself such questions as the following: 
What person or character is my ideal? 
What is my conception of a successful life? 
What value do I put upon truth, honesty, 
and virtue? Does the world owe me a living 
or do I owe the world a service? Am I look- 
ing for work or for ‘‘a job’’? Am I eagerly 
ambitious for self-improvement or am I 
easily content with my attainments? Am I 
whole-hearted in the work I am doing? Am 
I securing results which warrant me in con- 
tinuing in my work? Am TI steering my 
course by fixed stars, or am I drifting at the 
mercy of wind and tide? 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    
150 The Personality 
  
Let us be honest and firm with ourselves. 
Let us also be just and hopeful. Pessimism 
never saved a man, but courage and opti- 
mism have saved millions. We shall not 
reach perfection, nor did Franklin. He 
says, ‘‘I was surprised to find myself so 
much fuller of faults than I had imagined; 
but I had the satisfaction of seeing them 
diminished.’’? Franklin’s satisfaction may 
be ours if we strive as wisely and unre- 
mittingly as did he. 
Selection of Environment 
A third rule for growth in personality 
is the selection, so far as we may, of such 
environment as will keep before us the 
highest ideals of life and stimulate us to 
their attainment. ’ Our ideals have a dual 
origin. They are the offspring of our tem- 
perament, tastes and talents, native or ac- 
quired, and of our environment. The former 
determine what elements we shall select and 
appropriate from the -latter.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
Of the Teacher 151 
Master and dog appropriate different 
elements from their surroundings although 
they are passing together down the same 
street. The master, because of the nature 
of his physical ‘senses, lives in a world 
largely made up of sights and sounds. He 
guides his conduct by the things he sees and 
the sounds he hears. He makes little use of 
his sense of smell. The sign ‘‘Danger’’ 
leads him to look warily about for the source 
of possible harm. The honk of an automo- 
bile causes him to halt or hasten. On the 
other hand, the dog at his heels moves in a 
world of odor, for nature has endowed him 
with a keen sense of smell. He sees and 
hears, but his actions are controlled not 
more by his eye and his ear than by his 
nose. He does not see the sign ‘‘Danger’’ 
which challenged his master’s attention, but 
he catches the odor of a bone by the road- 
side and longs to steal away and test its 
value. Master and dog standing on the same 
square yard of soil are, because of their dif- 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  
    152 The Personality   
ferent powers and capacities, in very 
different worlds. 
It is also true that two men standing on 
the same square yard of soil may be, on 
account of their unlike heredity, in vastly 
different worlds. Imagine Shakespeare and 
Newton strolling together on the seashore. 
Newton, endowed with mathematical genius, 
might find in the ceaseless rise and fall of 
the tides phenomena for the application of 
his law of gravitation, while Shakespeare, 
gifted with poetic insight, might see the 
exquisite play of light and shadow, hear the 
majestic organ music of the deep, and store 
up imagery that would later find expression 
in immortal verse. Granting, then, that our 
temperament and capacities are the mother 
of our ideals, our environment is their 
father. It is environment that stimulates 
and gives direction to inherited capabilities. 
Environment determined that the Spartan 
youth should turn his talents toward war, 
and that the Athenian youth should direct
-P-A-G-E-151
  
Of the Teacher 153 
his toward commerce or art or philosophy. 
Environment took Robert H. Lee into the 
Confederate army and Ulysses S. Grant into 
the army of the Union. To a like degree, 
environment has determined our calling or 
is now deciding whether we shall be 
butchers, bakers, candle-stick makers; or 
doctors, lawyers, or teachers. Since we 
are denied the privilege of choosing our an- 
cestors, and through them our temperaments 
and talents, it behooves us to be wise in se- 
lecting, so far as we may, the other parent 
of our destiny, our environment. 
Influence of Human Association 
Now the most potent factor in our en- 
vironment is our human associations, and of 
these the home is the most important. Our 
homes have put their indelible stamp upon 
our lives. Our religion, our politics, our 
attitude toward the deep concerns of life, 
our ambitions, have been to a very large 
degree given to us by our home associations.
-P-A-G-E-152
  
154 The Personality 
The influence of our homes has been weak- 
ened or intensified by the personalities 
that we have met outside of the home 
circle. Our teachers, our friends, our 
chance acquaintances, have all contributed 
their part in furnishing our ideals and 
stimulating us to their attainment. For- 
tunate, then, is the man or woman who has 
been blessed with a good home and inspiring 
friends. 
It must be borne in mind, however, that 
our characters are not made, but are being 
made; and that we are still under the law of 
environment and subject to the give and 
take of associations now and here. We live 
in the present tense. Our past friends and 
associations have done their work for us, be 
it good or ill. We are to-day in the hands 
of our present friends and our present asso- 
ciations; these, and our friends and associa- 
tions of to-morrow, we may choose, and in 
so choosing, largely determine the courses 
of our lives. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  
  
Of the Teacher 155 
In this choosing one rule at least should 
be held inviolate, and that is to form no inti- 
mate friendships with persons of decidedly 
lower ideals than our own. He who violates 
this rule puts his moral future in jeopardy. 
On the contrary, it should be a steady pur- 
pose with us to associate as much as may be 
with persons who are our superiors in wis- 
dom, character, and experience. 
It is said of Lincoln that in his early 
manhood he was constantly seeking oppor- 
tunity to meet men who were noted for in- 
telligence and capacity. He made it his rule 
to hear every noted speaker who came in the 
vicinity of his home, and usually he man- 
aged to meet him and hold conversation with 
him. These men he could call his school- 
masters, for he practically had no others. 
Without question he owed no small part of 
his future success to this persistent effort 
to come under the influence of the wisest and 
strongest men of his time. His example in 
this particular is worthy the emulation of  
-P-A-G-E-154
  
  156 The Personality 
every ambitious and aspiring man and 
woman. 
It is well that every young person have 
older friends as well as young friends; for 
the wisdom and point of view which age and 
experience alone can bring is a good correct- 
ive for the impulsiveness and inexperience of 
youth. The writer can say with truth that 
to no companions of his own age, and he had 
good ones, is he so much indebted for the 
ideals which have been most fruitful in his 
life as he is to the mature friends of his 
young manhood. 
The Influence of Books 
Second only to our human associations 
in effect upon our characters is our reading. 
Books are almost living personalities. They 
are so intimate and speak to us so directly 
and at the same time so unobtrusively that 
we are often not aware of the influence 
they are having on our opinions and actions. 
It is therefore of vital importance what
-P-A-G-E-155
  
Of the Teacher 157 
books we read, for the books we read will in 
great measure determine our intellectual 
growth and the vigor and strength of our 
characters, 
The temptation constantly besetting us is 
to read the light fiction of the day found in 
the novel and the story magazine. It may 
be frankly admitted that most of this is en- 
tertaining and much of it is not unwhole- 
some, and that a teacher must sometimes 
read for recreation; but excessive reading 
of contemporary fiction is destructive of 
both taste and ability for literature that is 
strong and stimulating. The time that 
many persons spend in reading fiction 
would, if wisely spent, make them the best 
informed members of their community. 
I know a man who for thirty years has 
been a great devourer of books, and who 
to-day has nothing to show for the time 
spent. His reading has given only tempo- 
rary pleasure like a game of cards or an 
evening at a theater. If one-fourth the time  
-P-A-G-E-156
      
158 The Personality 
he has spent with books had been given to 
systematic reading of practical value he 
would to-day be an authority. Some there 
are who may not suffer much in their life’s 
work from over-indulgence in light reading, 
but not so the teacher. He must be intel- 
lectual. His knowledge must be wide, deep 
and vital. He must be strong,—and not 
strength but weakness lies in the direction 
of contemporary fiction. 
Reading to be effective must be sys- 
tematic. A very satisfactory way is to take 
American history, or birds, or Italian art, 
or any of a score of subjects that are en- 
lightening, and devote a year to its study. 
By continuing such a policy for a series of 
years a wide field of topics may be covered. 
Unless one has a definite program he is 
bound to fritter away his time and energy 
with small results. Here is a field to test 
our initiative and pluck. To begin and to 
stick to it—that is the thing. 
‘‘But,’? says some one, ‘‘I do not enjoy
-P-A-G-E-157
  
Of the Teacher 159 
such reading.’? That excuses no ‘teacher. 
Teachers may not always follow their own 
‘‘likes.’? They must follow ‘‘oughts.’? But 
the saving fact is our intellectual tastes (like 
our tastes for foods) can be cultivated. Let 
no one who has learned to like olives or 
strong coffee or any of a score of modern 
dishes deny his ability to learn to like books 
that deal with practical and vital things. 
Nibble at these books as persistently as you 
did at olives and your nibbles will become 
bites. 
; Participation in the Community Life 
I shall venture to suggest as a fourth 
rule for development of character such 
participation in the activities of one’s com- 
munity .as is consistent with a proper 
amount of study and reflection. There 
are two ways of participation—first, through 
keen and intelligent interest in the work 
and enterprises carried on in the community ; 
and second, through actual service. 
An intelligent man once said to me of 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  
    160 The Personality 
his normal school president,—‘‘He was 
the wisest man I have ever known. He could 
tell you how to plaster a cistern, kill slugs 
on a cherry tree, construct a dynamo or or- 
ganize a bank.’’ This knowledge did not 
come from actually doing these various 
things, but from an active interest in the 
life of the community where these opera- 
tions were going on. He was a curious and 
open-minded student in the great school of 
practical life, and the mason, the electrician, 
the gardener and the banker, and, in fact, 
every man he met was his teacher. This 
practical knowledge cost him no money and 
little effort. He accumulated it through the 
daily activities of his busy life. His fresh 
air strolls, his social calls, and his business 
transactions all offered opportunities for 
learning something new. He was respected - 
and honored by citizen and student and his 
name is alive to-day in the state where he 
lived and worked, although he has. been 
dead many years.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  
Of the Teacher 161 
This man had no unusual opportunities. 
He met the common people of a relatively 
small community as you and I are meeting 
them daily, but he met them with an eager 
mind, hungry for new truth in whatever 
form and from whatever source. Contrast 
this attitude of mind with that too common 
indifference toward community life which 
makes it possible for a person to teach in a 
farming district and not know growing po- 
tatoes from growing beans, nor a disk har- 
row from a corn planter; or to teach in a 
manufacturing center and not know its 
chief products and the processes of their 
manufacture. 
Some women teachers may think such 
knowledge of industry and business unneces- 
sary, if not unbecoming. The: best, brainiest 
and most successful women I have ever 
known in public school work have been the 
best informed on just such matters. They 
had dynamic knowledge. They knew the 
practical life of their communities and had 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  
    
162 The Personality 
an intelligent and active interest in their 
activities. They could teach boys as well as 
girls. 
But, as I have already indicated, another 
method of participation in the community 
life is through actual service. The teacher 
ean not do the work of the mechanic or 
banker; he has his own individual field of 
labor, but there are common interests in 
which many if not all of the people of a 
community join. The church, the social and 
literary clubs, the farmers’ clubs, the lecture 
courses, are some of the social institutions 
he may wisely serve. He should be ready to 
do his part in any special enterprise 
that calls for community action. But it 
is his special function to further the educa- 
tional interests of his city or district. He 
should resolve to make the school a feature 
of the community worthy of recognition. By 
means of special day programs, parents’ 
’ clubs, school gardens and other enterprises
-P-A-G-E-161
  
Of the Teacher 163 
legitimately educational, he may increase 
the school sentiment among his patrons. All 
this should be directly related to the prac- 
tical school program. 
Such participation in the life of the 
practical world as I have indicated is the 
best means of gaining, first hand, vital 
knowledge, the surest way of making the in- 
formation which we get from books dynamic 
and the most effective method of acquiring 
skill and power in leadership. The efficient 
teacher is never a mere book worm; he is 
an alert, active, socially-minded and helpful 
‘member of his community. 
Whether we look at the problem of 
human character from the standpoint of 
history, of observation of our fellow-men, 
or from our own personal experience it is 
borne in upon us that a worthy character 
is not a gratuitous gift of God; nor is it a 
chance product of fortunate circumstances. 
On the contrary, it is an achievement 
attained only through intelligent, courageous
-P-A-G-E-162
    
164 
  The Personality 
and continued effort. While it is not pos- 
sible to all to the same degree, it is possible 
to all to some degree. To achieve such a 
character for himself, and to assist others 
to achieve it, should be the supreme ambi- 
tion of every human life. 
10. PROBLEMS FOR THE TEACHER 
To what extent are we responsible for our suc- 
cesses or failures ? 
Are our moral capabilities as much influenced 
by heredity as are our intellectual ? 
What led you to become a teacher? 
Is the influence of our ideals over-emphasized 
in the text? 
Are we always conscious of our ideals? How 
may we become conscious of them? 
What do you think of the wisdom of forming 
friendships with persons of low ideals for the 
sake of helping them? 
Have you received your greatest inspiration 
from persons or books ? 
Make a list of the books that have been of spe- 
cial help. 
Make a list of the items you know about the 
practical life of your community. 
Do you believe that personality can be developed ?

CHAPTER VIII 
THE JOY OF LIVING 
Logically the material in this chapter 
should have been distributed among the pre- 
ceding chapters and this book end with 
Chapter VII, but logic had to yield to 
effective treatment. We teachers learned 
years ago that frequently good logic is not 
good pedagogy. Being a teacher, I bow to 
Queen Pedagogy rather than to King Logie 
and offer this chapter on The Joy of Living. 
Happiness is the universal quest. It is 
the goal of the world’s seeking and striving. 
The amoeba in its drop of water, the tiger 
in its jungle, the baby crying for the moon, 
the society devotee at the ball, the toper at 
his glass, the ascetic in his cell, the scholar 
in his library, the saint at his devotions, are 
all seeking the same end—happiness. 
Whether happiness is the legitimate goal  
-P-A-G-E-164
  
  166 The Personality   
of human effort or simply the reward 
offered for reaching the goal makes no prac- 
tical difference in this discussion, and I shall 
leave that question to the philosophers. This 
is certain, that the desire for happiness is 
part and parcel of our natures as much as 
our appetite for food, and that, like the 
appetite for food, the desire for happiness 
must be guided and controlled by reason and 
conscience, or misery rather than happiness 
will ensue. The most tragic wrecks of life 
have come from seeking happiness in wrong 
directions. 
Happiness, like fruit, is of many grades 
and qualities, and we must choose with dis- 
crimination if we would not be disappointed. 
It is of some importance to some of us to 
be able to select the apple of quality, but 
it is of supreme importance to all of us to 
be able to choose the pleasure of quality, 
for we pass this way but once, and if we 
pluck the wrong fruit we cannot return to 
correct our misjudgment. Fortunately for
-P-A-G-E-165
  
Of the Teacher 167 
us we are not journeying through unknown 
regions. Untold generations of men and 
women have passed this way. They have 
marked the trees whose fruit is wholesome 
and life-giving and also those ‘‘whose mor- 
tal taste’’ brings death and woe. We have 
the experience of the race to guide us in our 
legitimate seeking for happiness. We have 
but to turn the records and read. As an 
elder brother who has often perused the 
record, let me venture to interpret its mes- 
sage to those who have been less long on 
the way. 
It requires only a limited acquaintance 
with the world to convince us that one of the 
most fruitful sources of happiness in life 
is good health, and that one of the chief 
causes of human misery is ill health. There 
is no family circle on which the shadow of 
physical suffering does not fall. Sickness 
and disease follow our footsteps from the 
cradle to the tomb; they lie hidden in our 
work and in our pleasures; they go with us
-P-A-G-E-166
    
168 The Personality 
from our homes in the morning and return 
with us at night; they are associated with 
the most sacred duties and obligations of 
life. Look about you and count the people 
within the radius of your knowledge who 
are missing the joys of living because of ill 
health and you will be astonished at the 
number. Fortunate is the man who reaches 
his fortieth birthday without having some 
physical ailment saddled upon him which 
limits his usefulness and diminishes his hap- 
piness; and the situation is worse with 
respect to woman. 
In the struggle for business or profes- 
sional success nothing is of greater impor- 
tance than the ability to do hard and 
continuous work. The man who does six- 
teen hours of effective work while his com- 
petitor does eight has his rival hopelessly 
beaten. Only a rare genius can achieve 
without sustained effort. The great charac- 
ters of history have been men and women 
of splendid physical endurance. Charle-
-P-A-G-E-167
  
Of the Teacher 169 
  
magne, Napoleon, Washington, Bismarck, 
Gladstone, are the type of men who become 
world leaders, and they all possessed re- 
markable ability for arduous. and prolonged 
toil. The struggle for existence into which 
we are thrown is no place for weaklings, 
whether of mind or body. Life is like a 
Marathon race which all must enter. Some 
barely start before they fall out hopelessly 
beaten; others run a quarter or a half at 
a high rate of speed, and then collapse and 
retire; still others, knowing their limita- 
tions, take a slow pace which they are able 
to maintain to the finish; while a few, en- 
dowed with both speed and endurance, out- 
distance all competitors, and win the honors 
and the rewards. 
But health is not only a condition of 
material success, it is almost as necessary 
to the development of a sound and whole- 
some personality. The relation of mind and 
body is subtle and intimate. We are not a 
body and soul, or a body and mind, which-
-P-A-G-E-168
    
170 The Personality 
ever phrase one prefers, but we are a body- 
soul, or a body-mind. Body and mind are 
but two phases of that unity which we call 
human life. In this world at least they 
exist together and are mutually dependent. 
There is scarcely an hour of our waking 
lives that we are not reminded of the inter- 
relation and inter-play of our mental and 
physical natures. 
A headache ruins our book; bad air 
spoils the play; a tight shoe kills the ser- 
mon. The mind is helpless against such 
bodily conditions. On the other hand, the 
body responds to mental states. Grief takes 
away our appetite, shame. causes us to blush, 
fear makes our hair stand on end, and joy 
quickens our heartbeats. 
Since our moral and religious ideals and 
our wills are but phases of our mental lives, 
it follows that they too are influenced by 
the state of our bodily health. This is es- 
pecially true of children and youth whose 
habits of conduct are not yet established.
-P-A-G-E-169
  
Of the Teacher 171 
  
That hunger, fatigue and sickness pervert 
the happy disposition of childhood, every 
parent and teacher knows. That they per- 
vert the naturally kindly nature of parents 
and teachers, every child knows. Bad di- 
gestion and loss of sleep have ruined the 
happiness of many a household, and killed 
the joy in many a schoolroom. 
The question of health is of greatest im- 
portance to the teacher. Impaired health 
means added effort and reduced usefulness. 
It is pathetic to see a teacher struggle on 
day after day, held by necessity to his work 
long after his efficiency is impaired and 
the joy of the work is gone. But the teacher 
is not the only sufferer. His pupils, too, 
suffer. They not only suffer intellectual 
loss from the: reduced efficiency of the 
teacher, but they lose the inspiration and 
the gladness that flow from a teacher who 
has abundant physical energy. 
In a previous chapter I spoke of self- 
examination as one of the first steps toward 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
    
lie, The Personality 
growth in personality. Nowhere is this 
more important than in the care of health. 
We should early learn our limitations, and 
should so order our lives as to eliminate as 
far as possible our danger points. Perhaps 
there is no direction in which intelligence 
and a firm purpose will count more. The 
matter of food, sleep, exercise and attitude 
of mind are the fundamentals. To learn to 
like what we should eat, to so regulate our 
work and our pleasures that we shall get 
the sleep which our natures require, to se- 
cure the amount of fresh air and recreation 
which is necessary, and to adjust ourselves 
to the world so that we shall see beauty and 
goodness in it, are prime considerations. 
This program is possible to most teachers, 
and it should be adopted in youth, ‘‘ While 
the evil days come not, nor the years draw 
nigh when thou shalt say, ‘I have no pleas- 
ure in them.’ ’’ ; 
Monotony is an arch enemy of health and 
happiness. You have heard of the Maine
-P-A-G-E-171
  
Of the Teacher 173 
farmer who exclaimed when his wife became 
insane: ‘‘I can’t see why Jane went crazy. 
She hain’t had no excitement, for she hain’t 
been to town for fifteen year.’’ Monotony is 
found in more states than Maine, and in 
more occupations than farming. Many a 
teacher has made its acquaintance. One of 
the weapons with which to fight it is the 
‘fad,’’ using the term in its unobjectionabie 
sense. It is a fine thing for every teacher 
to have some interest outside of his profes- 
sion which will divert his mind and stimu- 
late his enthusiasm. 
One of my most delightful acquaintances 
is a man of fads. The first time I saw him 
he was accompanied by two beautiful Eng- 
lish setters. He was then a dog fancier. I 
found him also an ardent angler. He was 
an expert with fly and rod, and I caught 
the infection. Circumstances led me to 
ehange my residence so that I lived in a 
different state. When some years later we 
met on the trout stream for a summer’s 
fish, I found him an enthusiastic ornitholo-
-P-A-G-E-172
    
174 The Personality 
gist and an authority on the birds of his 
section. He also had become a skillful taxi- 
dermist, and his collection contained some 
of the finest mounted specimens I have ever 
seen. His next fad was botany, and he soon 
was the best informed man in his section 
of the state on the flora of that region. At 
present he has lost his heart to gardening, 
and when I visited him two summers ago 
he showed me with pride his gorgeous beds 
full of the choicest varieties of flowers that 
may be grown in his latitude. 
This man, whose profession keeps him 
in an office many hours of the day, has 
found time to become acquainted with the 
great out-of-doors. He never lacks topics 
of interest, and no one spends an hour with 
him without learning something of value. 
He has converted me to the belief that every 
person should cultivate fads, and start 
young enough in life to form the habit. The 
difficult thing in life is to find joy in our 
labor. It is so easy to lose the zest and
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  Of the Teacher 175 
  spirit which we had at the outset and to 
settle to the humdrum pace of the dray 
horse, doing our work as a mere matter of 
habit. A fad is a counter weight to this 
tendency. It offers us something new, fresh 
and stimulating, and not only opens new 
fields of effort and knowledge but, best of 
all, it feeds the flames of our enthusiasm 
and keeps it from dying. 
Health, however, is no guarantee of hap- 
piness, although the lack of health is a pro- 
lifie source of misery. Happiness is psycho- 
logical. It is a condition of mind and may 
exist in spite of physical conditions. Some 
of the most unhappy, cross-grained, misery- 
making characters I have ever known never 
had a sick day, while, on the other hand, 
some of the sunniest dispensers of joy and 
happiness scarcely ever were free from 
pain. It is of prime consideration, then, 
what habits of mind we cultivate and what 
attitude we assume toward the world. Per- 
haps no habit of mind is more fruitful of
-P-A-G-E-174
    
176 The Personality 
happiness than an attitude of genuine and 
hearty appreciation of the beauty and bless- 
ings of life. In spite of its drawbacks, we 
are in a world of beauty and wonder. Un- 
fortunately our eyes and ears are oft- 
times too dull to see the beauty and catch 
the music; but to him whose mind is open 
and sympathetic sources of delight are 
everywhere. 
The world of Nature about us has been 
a perpetual fountain of instruction, inspira- 
tion and joy to the choicest spirits of the 
race. ‘‘My heart leaps up when I behold 
the rainbow in the sky,’’? sang Wordsworth. 
Fortunate is the man whose heart so leaps 
up, for he has found one of the great 
sources of human happiness. One who has 
learned to love nature need not leave his 
dooryard to find objects of interest and 
pleasure. The daisy, the daffodil, the cloud,. 
the spring rain, the golden sunset, the snow- 
storm, the autumn leaf, the robin and the 
bluebird, are not exclusive; they visit
-P-A-G-E-175
  
  
Of the Teacher 177 
humble homes; they are common to city 
and country; yet these simple and common 
objects have inspired some of the most ex- 
quisite poems of our language, and have 
made the names of Burns, Wordsworth, 
Shelley, Emerson and Keats immortal. 
Nature, as I have intimated, is not 
partial; she paints her canvases and dis- 
courses her music for all. King and slave, 
poet and peasant are alike to her. You and 
I may enjoy her as much as a millionaire 
or a prince. Do you remember Breton’s 
“Skylark’’? Fortunately it hangs in many 
schoolrooms. A peasant girl, barefooted 
and coarsely clad, sickle in hand, is on 
her way to the field for her day of toil; 
the wild, rapturous melody of a skylark 
bursts on her ear and she stands enchanted, 
her homely features transformed and beau- 
tified with joy as she gazes up into the 
sky, where the lark ‘‘singing still dost soar, 
and soaring ever singest.’’ ‘‘Merely an art- 
ist’s fancy,’’ some dyspeptic replies. ‘‘What

charm has a lark’s song for one doomed to 
menial toil? More likely the girl would be 
brooding over her unhappy lot.’’ 
Possibly, but not necessarily. The art- 
ist has shown us not only what may be, but 
what often is. Last summer I listened with 
the keenest pleasure to an office girl’s story 
of a Sunday forenoon which she had re- 
cently spent in the meadows in search of a 
bobolink’s nest. Here was a girl who for 
six days was chained to a desk, but she 
had learned to love birds and in the open 
air, under the glorious June sky, with the 
fresh winds from the blooming clover blow- 
ing about her, she had spent half a day in 
winning from the merry songster his pre- 
cious secret of where his ‘‘nest and his 
nestlings’? lay; and the joy of that fore- 
noon had lingered with her and gladdened 
her office hours for days. 
To appreciate nature, one must know 
something about nature. Unfortunately too 
many men and women have not enough
-P-A-G-E-177
  Of the Teacher 179 
knowledge of the objects of nature about 
them to either understand or enjoy. They 
are like a gentleman I once met who classi- 
fied all birds as sparrows or crows. It is 
such ignorance of nature that deprives so 
many of a pleasure which lies at their doors 
and along their pathways. The person who 
understands and loves nature, to whom the 
note of the first robin, the smile of the first 
violet, the odor of orchard, the music of the 
insect orchestra, the falling of autumn 
leaves, the crystalline beauty of the snow, 
are objects of interest and joy, has a source 
of happiness that is unfailing from youth 
to age. 
We should appreciate not only nature 
but also human nature. The larger part of 
our happiness or misery comes from our 
human: associations; and which shall be the 
greater, our happiness or our misery, de- 
pends largely on the attitude we assume 
toward our fellows. The cynic and mis- 
anthrope see nothing but selfishness and 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  
  180 The Personali-y   
greed or weak sentimentality in human con- 
duct. It is inconceivable to them that a 
man should do good from a pure love of 
mankind. When they hear of a seemingly 
noble and disinterested act they immediately 
begin to search for the selfish motive that 
promoted it. Finding none, they classify 
the man who did the deed as an impractical 
sentimentalist. This attitude of mind one 
should shun as he would the plague. 
To one who has the insight to see and 
the heart to appreciate, human nature is a 
constant source of happiness. We read 
Shakespeare, Dickens and Thackeray and 
marvel at their wonderful delineations of 
character. We fancy they must have lived 
in a somewhat different world from ours, 
and were extremely fortunate in the people 
whom they met, for we have found among 
our friends and acquaintances no such char- 
acters as they portray. The trouble is with 
us; we do not see with the insight of a 
Shakespeare or a Dickens. My high school
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  
Of the Teacher 181 
  
pupils were surprised to find thirty species 
of trees where previously they had seen but 
four, and we should be astonished to dis- 
cover in common humanity a Hamlet, a 
Becky Sharp, an Alice or a Macawber, but 
they are there. 
You need not go outside of your neigh- 
borhood to see as sincere, noble and un- 
selfish men and women as live in the pages 
of drama and novel. You may not have 
to go beyond your own home. The sacred 
story relates that on the evening of the 
day on which Jesus rose from the grave 
two of his disciples were journeying to a 
village a little distance from Jerusalem, and 
Jesus joined them on the way; but ‘‘their 
eyes were holden’’ and they did not know 
him. At their invitation he became their 
guest at supper. : ‘‘He took bread and blest 
it and broke it and gave it to them. And 
their eyes were opened and they knew him 
and he vanished from their sight.’? So we 
journey along the highway of life with our
-P-A-G-E-180
  
    
182 The Personality 
eyes ‘‘holden,’’ and we fail to see the divine 
in the strength, courage and love of a 
father, the patience and devotion of a 
mother, the high-minded loyalty of a brother 
or sister till they vanish from our sight. 
The happiest lives that it has been my privi- 
lege to know have had the wonderful power 
of seeing in everyday men and women 
characters worthy the pen of a Shakespeare. 
Such power it is worth our while to 
cultivate. 
There is not only a happiness which 
comes from appreciating our fellow men, 
but there is also a joy which comes from 
serving them. How startling and para- 
doxical are some of the teachings of Jesus! 
They seem wholly at variance with the 
laws of human nature. Take for illustra- 
tion his declaration, that it is more blessed to 
give than to receive, and the parallel state- 
ment, that he who would be greatest of 
all should be the servant of all. Such 
principles of life seem to be in direct oppo- 
a
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  
Of the Teacher 183 
  
sition to the laws of happiness. And it is 
true that to our. superficial thinking a life 
of leisure seems more desirable than a life 
of labor, and to be served seems more de- 
sirable than serving. If we had our choice 
between these alternatives I fear we should 
choose leisure and being served, and yet to 
do so would be a grievous mistake. If the 
experience of humanity teaches any lesson 
it teaches this,—that the best qualities of 
a human soul are not developed in an atmos- 
phere of ease, and that happiness flees from 
the one who directly seeks it. The virtues 
which are the glory of human nature are 
not born of ease and pleasure, but come 
from toil and struggle. Intelligence, indus- 
try, fortitude, courage, sympathy and love, 
are not hot-house products; they develop 
on the storm-swept heights of human action, 
and they perish when deprived of the moun- 
* tain air that nourishes them. 
Great characters are the fruit of great 
struggles. The person who shirks hard-
-P-A-G-E-182
  
  
184 The Personality 
ship and service soon becomes a weakling as 
well as a coward. 
This is the great message which George 
Eliot voices in Romola: ‘‘There was a man 
to whom I was very near,’’ said Romola to 
Lillo, ‘‘so that I could see a great deal of 
his life, who made every one fond of him; 
for he was young and clever and beautiful, 
and his manners to all were gentle and kind. 
I believe when I first knew him, he never 
thought of anything cruel or base. But be- 
cause he tried to slip away from everything 
that was unpleasant and cared for nothing 
else so much as his own safety, he came at 
last to commit some of the basest deeds— 
such as make men infamous. He denied his 
father and left him in misery; he betrayed 
| every trust that was reposed in him, that he 
might keep himself safe and get rich and 
prosperous. Yet calamity overtook him.’’ 
With instinctive insight, humanity puts its - 
crown of honor and love upon the heads of 
men and women who have not lived for them-
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  
Of the Teacher 185 
  
selves alone but for the race. Moses, Soc- 
rates, Washington, Lincoln, and most of all, 
Jesus, are enshrined in the hearts of. man- 
kind, not primarily because of their genius, 
but because they used their mighty gifts for 
the welfare of their fellowmen. Their lives 
verify the declaration of Jesus, that to be 
/ great, one must serve. 
Now the beautiful harmony of life is re- 
vealed in the fact that the service of which I 
am speaking has its reward in the deepest 
and purest joy known to human hearts, and 
in the further fact that such service and joy 
are possible to all. Few of the children of 
men can be great or wise, but all may be help- 
ful. There is scarcely a day of life’s journey 
that does not afford an occasion to show some 
kindness to a fellow traveler. Opportunity 
for such service knocks alike at the door of 
the palace and the cottage. In this respect 
mankind are equal. Such service is the glory 
of humanity and marks man’s highest ascent 
toward the God-inspired ideal which beckons 
him on. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
    
186 The Personality 
The joy of service is the supreme compen- 
sation of the teacher. Teaching offers but 
limited opportunity for distinction and less 
opportunity for wealth, but no calling is 
richer in possibilities of joyful service. To 
appreciate this, one must have a vision which 
takes in the whole scope of the work of the 
school from the kindergarten upward. <A 
teacher in a single elementary grade may feel 
that her work is unimportant and empty of 
permanent results because she touches but a 
small fraction of a child’s life. But she can- 
not judge the value of her work by looking 
at it in isolation. It must be viewed as part 
of the whole process which takes the child, ig- 
norant and helpless, and trains his hand, his 
head and his heart to bear a useful and hon- 
orable part in the great work of the world. 
In this process every stage is important and 
its tremendous significance may be seen in 
the final result: For such service, heartily, 
conscientiously and effectively rendered, no 
salary that a teacher may or should receive 
   
-P-A-G-E-185
  
Of the Teacher 187 
  
is compensation. His larger and richer re- 
ward comes from his association with the 
buoyant, hopeful, eager and potential lives 
of childhood and youth and from the con- 
sciousness that through these lives, whom it 
is his privilege to teach, he may have some 
part in making the world wiser, happier and 
better. 
The happiness which comes from service 
is multiplied many fold, if there is in our 
hearts a faith that our labor is not in vain. 
Nothing so stimulates and sustains human ef- 
fort as a confident belief that the effort will 
not be empty and fruitless. No man would 
plant if he did not expect a harvest. No per- 
son can teach who does not have faith that 
his work will be productive. The teacher 
must be an optimist. No clouds of doubt must 
obscure his sun. He must believe that the 
possibilities of knowledge, goodness and 
helpful service are inherent in every boy and 
girl. He must believe that the human race 
has limitless capacity for improvement and
-P-A-G-E-186
  188 The Personality 
that its present attainment is farther from 
its final goal than it is from the age of the 
cave-man. He should believe that an. In- 
finite Wisdom and Beneficence whom we call 
God, has so shaped the laws of the universe 
that knowledge is mightier than ignorance 
and goodness mightier than evil. He must 
see in the education and training of child- 
hood and youth the mightiest social agency 
for human progress and he must conceive of 
himself as part of that agency. Such a view 
of life will make teaching somewhat more 
than a means of livelihood, and a teacher 
something more than a wage earner. As the 
sunlight falling upon a landscape transforms 
and beautifies the common and unlovely ob- 
jects, glorifying stick and stone and brier and 
weed, so such a faith in the inherent worth of 
the individual and in the enlarging future of 
humanity transforms the common duties of 
the schoolroom and gives them significance 
and value reflected from the ultimate future 
towards which the universe moves.

PROBLEMS FOR THE TEACHER 
So far as your observation goes, to what extent 
is ill health responsible for human unhap- 
piness ? 
To what is so much ill health due? Where lies 
the remedy? 
From your observation, is there often direct 
connection between physical weakness and 
ill temper and even vice? Cite instances. 
Compare various occupations of men and women 
with respect to monotony. 
Give a list of books which you would recom- 
mend to one who desired to become acquainted 
with birds, trees and flowers. 
How many birds can you identify by sight? 
By song? How many trees can you identify? 
Make a list of the fads or interests which you 
have known people to follow. What is yours? 
Is teaching more trying to health than are other 
occupations ?  
-P-A-G-E-188

9. To what extent can one cultivate an interest in 
and an appreciation of his fellow-men? 
10. What is your ideal of a happy life? 
11. Does our great danger lie in too much or too 
little idealization of life and life’s work ?

SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 
DspartMENT oF Pusuic Instruction, 
Orrice or State SupERINTENDENT, 
Nasuvitiz, Tenn., Dec. 15, 1891. 
To His Excellency, Joun P. Bucnanan, Governor of Tennessee: 
Sir—In compliance with the school-law, I have the honor to 
submit the annual report of the Department of Public Instruc- 
tion for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. 
When [ entered upon the duties of the office of State Super- 
intendent, on the 26th day of April, 1891, the schools of full 
terms were approaching the end of the scholastic year, and the 
schools of short terms were already closed. 
It thus devolved upon me to gather and compile statistics of 
the work which had been completed mainly during the term of 
my predecessor. These statistics justify me in congratulating 
him and the State on the progress which has been made. 
The period of the year had arrived when the office is crowded 
with active and pressing duties: The collection and compila- 
tion of statistics for the closing year; the distribution of forms 
and supplies, and the organization of schools for the approach- 
ing new year; the examination of applicants for normal scholar- 
ships and for cadetships at the State University; the organiza- 
tion of summer Institutes for teachers, and the visiting of 
schools at their closing exercises. The labor of the office, 
which is always onerous at this season, was greatly increased 
by the necessity of changing many of the school-forms and 
supplies to adapt them to the requirements of the new school- 
law. This mass of work, together with the immense corre- 
spondence which it entailed, could not have been performed — 
without the assistance of a permanent clerk, for which office 
the Legislature wisely made provision, at its last session. 
_ The value of educational statistics, as a record of the past 
and as a guide to the future, will not. be questioned by thought- 
ful men. To be valuable, it is important that they be accurate - 
and reliable. In collecting these statistics, I have encountered 4
-P-A-G-E-13
pecen ho tees 
the difficulty which has been pointed out by all my predeces- 
sors, that of obtaining accurate reports from the county officers. 
A majority of the County Superintendents have shown com- 
mendable zeal, and have promptly forwarded to this office ac- 
curate and complete reports. Hrom a number of counties the 
reports were inaccurate and defective, and necessitated lengthy 
correspondence in order to procure the necessary corrections 
and amendments. From some counties, no reports at all could 
be obtained until after repeated and urgent appeals. At length, 
however, after much delay, and for the first time in the history 
of the State, reports have been obtained from every county in the 
State, although a few of these reports are incomplete. 
The educational statistics have thus attained accuracy in 
some of the tables, and a reasonable degree of completeness. 
This result is largely due to the zeal and assiduous labors of the 
clerk of the department, Mr. J. 8. Buchanan. 
The school-law needs amendment, in order to secure greater 
promptness and accuracy in the reports of district and county 
officers. 
The following summaries show the condition of the public 
schools of the State:

The total increase in scholastic population, as compared with 
the previous year, is 8,127. Of this increase, 7,234 is found in 
the white population, and 893 is found in the colored popu- 
lation. |

The white population has increased in the ratio of 1.4 per 
cent., and the colored population in the ratio of one-half of one 
per cent. 
The white scholastic population for the present year is a little 
less than 75 per cent. of the total, and the colored population is 
a little more than 25 per cent.

The total increase of pupils enrolled is 63,238. Of this num- 
ber, 52,724 are white pupils and 10,509 are colored. Thus, the 
enrollment of white pupils shows an increase over the enroll- 
ment of the previous year of thirteen per cent. The enroll- 
ment of colored pupils shows an increase of eleven per cent. 
Of the total number enrolled, seventy-eight per cent. are white 
pupils, and twenty-two per cent. are colored pupils. 
The statistics of attendance are not so accurate and reliable 
as,those of enrollment. Many County Superintendents have 
complained that the registers have been so loosely kept by the 
teachers that they furnish no means even to estimate the aver--
-P-A-G-E-15
    pe iS 
age daily attendance. It is urged upon county and district 
officers and upon teachers to give in future more careful atten-' 
‘tion to the records. "The Superintendents of seventeen counties 
failed to report the average daily attendance. The reports for 
these counties are supplied in Table II., when possible, from the 
report of the previous year, and in other cases by estimating 
the, average attendance to be seventy per cent. of the enroll- 
ment, as shown by the records of the previous year. The 
method used in each case is noted at the foot of the table. 
From the compilation of the county reports, it appears that 
the increase in the average daily attendance is 41,053. This 
is an increase of fourteen per cent. over the previous year. 
The increase in the average daily attendance of white pupils is 
29,970, being an increase over that of the previous year of 
thirteen per cent. The increase of the average daily attend- 
ance of colored pupils over that of the previous year is 11,- 
083. This increase is more favorable than that of the white 
pupils, being eighteen per cent. 
The number of pupils enrolled in the several branches of 
study needs but little comment. The increase keeps pace with 
the general increase in enrollment. The increase in the num- 
ber enrolled in elements of agriculture, however, deserves no- 
tice. When this branch of study was added to the public 
school curriculum, mainly through the exertions of Dr. T. B. 
Harwell in 1879, the teachers were not’ prepared to co-operate 
in its introduction, and it remained for several years almost a 
dead enactment on the statute book. 
In 1883, four years after the enactment, the number enrolled 
in Elements of Agriculture was ouly 369. 
The increasing popularity and usefulness of this branch of 
study during the last few years, demonstrates the wisdom of 
making a beginning in the right direction. 
The school-officers are urging the matter at Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes, and the teachers are preparing themselves to give instruc- 
tion in this useful branch of study. The report of the year end- 
ing June 30, 1890, shows the enrollment in Elements of Agricult-
-P-A-G-E-16
  ure to be 2,772. ‘The above summary for the Aa year sho 7s 
this enrollment to be 4,484, an increase over the previous year — 
of 1,712.

The increase in the number of teachers employed is 839. In 
the employment of white teachers, the main increase over the 
previous year is in the employment of males, 273 more males be- 
ing employed and 68 more females. In the employment of 
colored teachers, the females have gained 29, while the males 
have lost 26. 
The increase in the number of schools taught is 457, of which 
384 are white schools, and 73 colored schools. There is algo 
an increase of 94 school-districts. : 
The increase under the three remaining heads in the above 
summary are gratifying signs of progress. 270 additional 
graded schools, and 106 additional consolidated schools were 
established in the districts. The number of schools controlled 
by city boards was increased from 117 to 188, a gain of 71.

  The above summary of the official acts of County Superin- 
tendents shows an increased activity in school-work. Forty- 
two more County Institutes were held than during the previous 
year, 1,112 more teachers attended, and ‘the aggregate number 
of days of continuance exceeded the aggregate of the previous 
year by 146. The Institute-work of the year is highly credit- 
able to the County Superintendents and to the teachers, and es- 
pecially so when it is remembered that this work is mainly vol- 
untary, and, except in a few instances, is a tax upon the private 
incomes of the Superintendents and teachers, no provision for 
the expenses of County Institutes being made by the State or 
the county. It furnishes an example of enthusiasm and devo- 
tion to the public service which deserves public recognition and 
public gratitude. ;

-P-A-G-E-19

The above summary, as compiled from the reports of the 
several counties, seems to indicate a decrease in two important 
items. The number of “schools visited” is 287 less than for 
the previous year, and the number of “ public addresses de- 
livered by County Superintendents ” is 324 less. This apparent 
decrease, however, is explained by the fact that a large number 
of the Superintendents were elected in January, 1891, about the 
middle of the school-year, when many of the schools had closed. 
Many of these newly-elected Superintendents found no records 
to show the work of their predecessors, and included in their 
reports only their own official acts. Had the visits and ad- 
dresses of their predecessors been included, the summary would 
have shown an increase instead of a decrease. 
Out of 9,108 applicants examined, 8,264 were licensed, and 
844 were rejected. During the previous year, 8,916 applicants 
were examined, of which number 7,824 were licensed, and 1,092 
were rejected. _ It is to be hoped that these statistics indicate an 
improvement in the qualifications of the applicants rather than 
a laxity in the examinations of the last year. 
In addition to the County Institutes, a report of whose opera- 
tions is included in the above summary, there are two other 
useful appliances for the improvement of teachers which have 
been used in several counties, viz. : 
Teacuers’ Ruapine Crrcies, AnD Treacuers’ Liprary Assocra- 
TIONS. 
These associations are entirely voluntary in the several coun- 
ties or cities, and there is no general State system. It thus 
happens that no report of their operations has been required, or 
provided for in the forms sent out from this office. Thus, 
through no fault of the county officers, this department cannot 
present a statistical report of their work, or even a list of the 
counties and cities in which they have been organized. ~ 
It may be stated, however, that they have not been estab- 
- lished so generally or thoroughly as their importance demands.
-P-A-G-E-20
es eee 
In Bedford and Knox Counties, they have been in successful - 
operation for several years, and have accomplished useful re- 
sults, for which honor is due to Superintendents Allen and 
Ford, and to the teachers of their respective counties. 
Through the active exertions of several of our best Superin- 
tendents, aided by the intelligent zeal of the teachers and 
friends of education, reading circles and libraries have been or- 
ganized in a few other counties and cities. It is a source of re- 
gret that a complete list cannot be presented. 
Special reports have been received from the city of Nashville, 
and from the county of Hamilton, showing the organization of | 
teachers’ libraries and reading circles. These reports are 
given in full in Appendix G, and may be of use to the Superin- 
tendents and teachers of such counties or cities as may desire to 
emulate the laudable example.

crease over the expenditures of the previous year of $423,707.29. 
Of this expenditure $288,652.71 were spent for school-buildings 
and sites, fixtures, furniture, and other miscellaneous expenses 
for the comfort and improvement of schools, being an increase 
of $103,283.81 over the expenditures for the same purposes dur- 
ing the previous year. ;

      The above summary shows a decrease in the number of pri-

decrease in the number of teachers employed of 61. There is, 
however, an increase of pupils enrolled of 2,659, and an increase 
in average attendance of 1,592. The statistics of private schools 
are not accurate. There are no means of obtaining reports 
from them except through their courtesy. Many of them re- 
fuse or neglect to report, and the county officers are compelled 
to make estimates. 
So far as they approach accuracy, their statistics would seem 
to indicate that while the number of private schools is dimin- 
ishing, their grade is improving; that they attract a larger num- 
ber of pupils who have completed the course of the public 
schools, and are seeking higher education. Another cause of 
increase in the attendance upon private schools is due to the 
fact that they are attracting a larger patronage from other 
States. This is especially true of the best college preparatory 
schools, and of the schools for females. 
- The cost of tuition in private schools differs but, little from 
' the cost of the previous year, being three cents less per pupil, 
per month.

The following facts, disclosed by the statistics of the year, are 
evidences of the steady growth of the public school system: 
1. The schools were taught an average of ten days longer 
than ever before. 
2. The number of pupils enrolled was 63,233 more than ever 
before. 
8. The average daily attendance of pupils was 41,053 greater 
than ever before. 4 
4. Four hundred and fifty-seven more schools were taught, : 
and 339 more teachers employed, than ever before. 
5. The estimated value of school-property increased $344,- 
489.09. 
6. One thousand one hundred and twelve more teachers at- 
tended County Institutes than ever before. 
7. The school-revenues were $387,135.91 more than ever 
before. 
8. The enactments of the Legislature were more favorable to 
the-schools than ever before: 
(1) In improving the system by judicious legislation. 
(2) In making an appropriation for State Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes. 
(8) In increasing the appropriation for normal instruction. 
9. The action of the County Courts was more cordial and 
liberal than ever before: 
(1) In making appropriation for the benefit of schools. 
(2) In paying more liberal salaries to the County Superin- 
tendents. 
10. The increase in the number of high graded corporation 
schools was marked. 
11. The increased zeal and activity of the County Superin- 
tendents are shown in the record of their official work in sta- 
tistical table No. 6, and in the fact that reports were made by 
every County Superintendent in the State.

Earty Epucation in TENNESSEE. 
The hardy pioneers who settled Tennessee brought with them 
their old English ideas. The institutions which they founded 
were like themselves—English in type, amended to fit the wil- 
derness. They were a heroic race, and acted, in the obscurity 
of the wilderness, parts fit to adorn the theater of the world. 
Yet, they did not covet glory, and seemed all unconscious of 
their title to the gratitude of posterity. They furnished a nota- 
ble example of the words of Metternich, “Those who make 
history do not write history.” They manifested for records an 
indifference almost amounting to contempt. They did not seel< 
to write their deeds on the page of history, but they lived, li¢- 
erally, in the hearts of their countrymen. 
Yet, they left behind them evidences not designed for the 
public eye—their private letters and diaries, and a few official 
documents. These prove the literary culture of their authors. 
Such of their history as has been rescued from oblivion has been 
gathered from scattered sources and from tradition, and has 
survived rather by its own inherent powers of life than by the 
efforts or design of the actors. But enough has come down 
through authentic channels to fill us with admiration for the 
virtues of our ancestors. .* 
These pioneers were not only men of action. Many of them 
were men of culture, and they brought with them refined wives 
and children. In such a community it would be safe to assert, 
even without direct evidence, that education would not be 
wholly neglected. 
The home school, which has always been a potent factor in 
Southern education, undoubtedly laid the foundation of educa- 
tion in Tennessee. Of this home school, which often went be- 
yond elementary instruction, the mother was usually the teacher, 
and the father was assistant at such times as his active duties 
would permit. The home school was often taught by the old 
grandmother, or the maiden aunt, or the elder daughter. Some- 
times a private tutor was employed. These home schools pre- 
served no records, and are unnoted in educational statistics. 
We know of their existence by incidental allusions and by reli-
-P-A-G-E-24
a3 
able tradition. Some of them were grand schools, and yet 
were not always called schools. Some of the men whom these 
schools molded to greatness would say they “ had never been to 
school.” 
“The first school in Tennessee,” says Mr. Phelan, “and, in 
fact, the first literary institution founded in the great Missis- 
sippi Valley, was founded by Samuel Doak.” In 1788 this in- 
stitution was incorporated by North Carolina as Martin Acad- 
emy, and in 1795 became Washington College, in Salem, Wash- 
ington County. 
The first incorporated institution of learning in the State was 
Davidson Academy, in Davidson County... This institution was 
incorporated by North Carolina in 1785, subsequently became 
Cumberland College, later on became the University of Nash- 
ville, was rendered famous under the long administration of Dr. 
Philip Lindsley, and is now The University of Nashville and 
Peabody Normal College. 
It is unnecessary to enumerate the institutions which began 
to spring up in various portions of the State. It is sufficient to 
say that they were all modeled on the old English plan. Such — 
insufficient aid as they received from the State of North Caro- 
lina was applied to building and improvements. They were 
conducted as private schools, and relied for support on tuition 
fees. 
When Tennessee became a State, in 1796, her hands were 
tied by a singular complication, and she was unable to give aid 
to her schools. What aid had heretofore been extended to ed- 
ucation by North Carolina was derived from the proceeds of 
the sale of the public lands. Tennessee, when admitted as a 
State, found herself the only State whose public lands were the 
property of the United States. \ 
Tennessee was the first State erected out of a Territory intoa 
State. The United States had not adopted the wise and liberal 
policy, now so well detined, for the admission of new States. This. 
policy was not developed until the admission of Ohio, in 1802.
-P-A-G-E-25
Ea Io 
The circumstances connected with the admission of Tennessee 
are explained in the following extract from an address which I 
had the honor to deliver before the Department of Superintend- 
ence of the National Educational Association, at Washington, 
March 8, 1889: 
“North Carolina, in 1790, ceded to the United States the 
‘sovereignty and territory of all lands’ within the present limits 
of Tennessee. In 1796 Tennessee was admitted as a State, but 
the United States retained the title to the public lands. In 
1802, Thomas Jefferson, then President of the United States, 
_had the satisfaction to sign the enabling act for Ohio, the first 
State carved out of the North-west Territory, thus conveying 
to the infant State in 1802 the first fruits of the educational 
seed which was planted by the benevolent wisdom of those who 
framed the ordinance of May 20, 1785. 
“Tt was not until 1806, ten years after its admission as a 
State, that a similar provision was made for Tennessee, in the 
cession act of Congress, which act likewise bears the signature 
of Thomas Jefferson. By this act the United States ceded to 
Tennessee the public lands to which the Indian title had been 
extinguished. Provisions were made for the benefit of educa- 
tion sin:ilar to those made in the case of Ohio, but differing in 
one important particular. In Ohio, and in the other States 
carved out of the North-west Territory, the sixteenth section in 
each township was designated and conveyed direct to the in- 
habitants of the township. The admirable system of United 
‘States surveys definitely located the grant, and the title was 
vested. Tennessee, which had been admitted ten years before 
its land cession, had not been reached by this system of 
surveys. The township and section could not, therefore, be 
designated, and Congress did not vest title in the inhabitants of 
a township or district. The provision was in the following 
words : : 
“<«And the State of Tennessee shall moreover, in issuing 
grants and perfecting titles, locate six hundred and forty acres 
to every six miles square in the territory hereby ceded, where 
existing claims will allow the same, which shall be appropriated 
for the use of schools for the instruction of children forever.’
-P-A-G-E-26
Eons 
“This provision imposed a duty on the State, but failed to 
vest title in the subordinate civil division. Tennessee had no 
series of civil divisions of six miles square corresponding to the 
township. The grant was not, thus, definitely located and 
vested. In the meantime much of the land had been taken up 
by valid claims, and, with the rapid stream of immigration 
which poured in, the squatter preceded the surveyor. Many 
acts were passed by the Legislature to protect the school-lands, 
but from the vague nature of the grant, and possibly from the 
failure to appreciate its value, the opportunity to utilize it was 
lost. 
“ Another provision of the same act of Congress, however, 
was turned to better advantage. This provision required the 
Legislature to set apart 100,000 acres for the use of two col- 
leges, and 100,000 for the use of academies, one for each county, 
said lands to be sold for not less than $2 per acre, and the pro- 
ceeds to be invested in funds for the uses aforesaid. To pro- 
tect these lands, the State attempted to construct legislative en- 
actments to serve as a fence against the squatter. The result 
was numberless lawsuits, and finally the loss of much of the best 
land. Most of it, however, was saved, and the proceeds applied 
to the purposes of the grant. The college funds were applied 
to the erection and partial endowment of two colleges, one of 
which is now the State University, at Knoxville, and the other 
the Peabody Normal College, at Nashville. The funds of both 
these institutions have been supplemented by private subscrip- 
tions and subsequent donations. In addition to these, a num- 
ber of colleges and universities have been established and en- 
dowed by the various religious denominations of. the South- 
western States, and located in Tennessee. From this cireum- 
stance Tennessee derives the name of the ‘ University State of 
the South.’ Many of these are excellent institutions. One of 
them, having received a munificent donation, has adopted, in . 
honor of the donor, the name of Vanderbilt University. 
“On September 13, 1806, twenty-seven academies were in- 
corporated, one in each county, and were made recipients of the 
academy fund. The fund was supplemented in most of the 
counties by private subscription, and was barely sufficient for
-P-A-G-E-27
een ae 
building purposes. In most cases, however, good and substan- 
tial structures were erected, which are still standing, and some 
of them are now public high schools. In addition to these, a 
number of academies were established by private donations, 
by social orders, and by religious denominations. All of these 
institutions were, in the past, maintained by tuition fees. Very 
few of them were endowed. Some of them were called colleges, 
but they have rarely attempted to perform college work. They 
have really been county high schools. The assumption of the 
name college, however, has misled a few of these institutions to 
misconceive their true functions, and has exposed many excel- 
lent institutions to unmerited ridicule. It should be remem- 
bered that the name college was applied to institutions of sim- 
ilar grade by no less authority than Thomas Jefferson. 
“Tt thus appears that the history of education in Tennessee 
forms no exception to the general history of Southern educa- 
tion. Our ancestors maintained academies, colleges, and uni- 
versities, but neglected and undervalued primary and common 
schools; or at least left them to private enterprise, and devoted 
legislative attention to the top of the educational edifice.” 
From 1806 to the present time, scarcely a session of the Leg- 
islature has passed without some enactment for the benefit of 
education. he early statutes are full of acts incorporating 
academies, seminaries, and colleges. These acts use the words 
“encourage and support” education, instead of the language of 
the present law, “establish and maintain.” Some of these acts 
are little more than statutory exhortations. Most of them are 
directed to the preservation and sale of the public lands, and 
the distribution of the proceeds among the several counties. 
In 1827 a general law was enacted to consolidate all school- 
funds into one common school-fund “appropriated to the en- 
couragement and support of common schools forever.” 
. In 1829 a general law was enacted which may be regarded as 
the germ of the present school-system. This law provided that 
each County Court should elect a County Board of School Com- 
missioners, who should have the general control of the schools 
and school-funds of the county. They were empowered to di- ; ?
-P-A-G-E-28
i — 27 — 
vide the county into school-districts, and to appoint five trustees 
for each district. The trustees were empowered to control the 
schools and school-funds of the district. They were required 
~ to make annual reports to the Commissioners and the Commis- 
sioners to the Legislature. 
The distribution of the annual fund is shown in the following 
extracts from the law of 1829: 
“Sxo. 9. The interest arising on the moneys hereby appropria- 
ted, the tax on the twelve and a half cent lands and the one 
cent lands, and any other tax, fines, or contributions directed 
by law to be paid to said Commissioners, arising in the county, 
shall be, and is hereby, considered a fund for annual distribution 
among the schoo}-districts.” 
“Sxc. 10. The Common School Commissioners shall appor- 
tion and divide the annual school-fund raised as aforesaid for 
distribution, to the several school-districts, which are entitled 
‘to a share by complying with the requisitions of this act, in 
proportion to the number of children in each school-district, 
between the ages of five and fifteen years, including both 
sexes. 
“Suc. 11. Any school-district laid off as directed by this act, 
before it shall be entitled to receive any part or portion of the 
annual fund for distribution, shall, by some evidence satisfactory 
_ to the School Commissioners, show such Commissioners ‘that 
such district has provided a comfortable school-house, and the 
Trustees of said school-district shall give bond to said Commis- 
sioners, in the name of the chairman, conditioned that such 
sum so raised by the district, as also the amount of the annual 
school-fund they may receive, shall be faithfully and honestly 
applied to the support of a free school in said district; and it 
shall be the duty of each Trustee in every district, to open and 
keep a subscription paper and solicit and receive donations, which 
shall be appropriated to the support of the school of the 
district.” 
Two provisions of this law are of interest, as they show that 
our forefathers devoted thought to two matters which are now 
‘
-P-A-G-E-29
eS 
agitating educational circles. One of these sections provides, in 
a mild form, for “free text-books.” The other squints towards 
“ compulsory education.” 
I quote them below: 
“Sxc. 23. The Common School Commissioners in each county 
may expend the sum not exceeding twenty dollars annually of the 
annual school-fund in the purchase of school-bcoks and writing 
paper, which they shall distribute to the several districts accord- 
ing to the supposed necessities of the districts, and which shall 
be given by the Trustees to those children whose parents are 
unable to purchase books for them. 
“Sec. 24. It shall be the duty of the Trustees of the several 
school-districts, so far as practicable, to induce all children 
within the district, under the age of fifteen years, to be sent 
to school, and no distinction shall me made between rich and 
poor, but said school shall be open and free to all.” 
The quotations above given are sufficient to point out the 
radical defect of the law of 1829. It created county and dis- 
trict officers to manage a school-system, but failed to provide a 
school-system for them to manage. The law was framed to en- 
courage schools and not to establish them. It contained, how- 
ever, several good features, and it had one excellent effect. It 
commissioned a number of the best citizens of each county as 
school-officers, and brought vividly before them the inefficiency 
of the law, and the necessity for an organized public school sys- 
tem maintained by an adequate fund. Amendments were made 
to this law from time to time, but none adequate to cure its in- 
herent defects. 
In 1834 the constitutional convention assembled, and the 
school-fund, which had been consolidated by the act of 1827, 
was put upon a permanent basis. 
The following constitutional provision reflects honor upon 
its framers: 
“ Kuowledge, learning, and virtue being essential to the pres- 
ervation of republican institutions, and the diffusion of the 
,
-P-A-G-E-30
79g 28 
opportunities and advantages of education throughout the dif- 
ferent portions of the State being highly conducive to the pro- 
motion of this end, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly, 
in all future periods of this government, to cherish literature 
and science. And the fund called the ‘common school fund,’ 
and all the lands and proceeds thereof, dividends, stocks, and 
other property of every description whatever, heretofore by law 
appropriated by the General Assembly of this State for the use - 
of common schools, and all such as shall hereafter be appropri- 
ated, shall remain a perpetual fund, the principal of which shall 
never be diminished by legislative appropriation; and the in- 
terest thereof shall be inviolably appropriated to the support and 
encouragement of common schools throughout the State, and for 
the equal benefit of all. And no law shall be made authoriz- 
ing said fund, or any part thereof, to be diverted to any other 
.use than the support and encouragement of common schools. 
And it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to appoint a 
Board of Commissioners, for such term of time as they may 
think proper, who shall have the general superintendence of 
such fund, and who shall make a report of the condition of 
same from time to time under such rules, regulations, and re- 
strictions as may be required by law.” * * * 
The above provision is repeated in the Constitution of 1870, 
with the omission of the clause requiring the appointment of a 
board of commissioners, and with an additional clause appro- 
priating a poll-tax of $1 on each taxable poll to the use of 
schools, and adding, also, the following clause: 
“No school established or aided under this section shall allow 
white and negro children to be received as scholars together in | 
the same school.” 
In 1835 an important amendment was enacted, which gave 
the system the outward appearance of greater symmetry and 
unity, and was a step towards a State system. The office of 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction was created, and 
also a State Board of Commissioners, of which the State Su- 
perintendent was president. In 1836 Robert H. McEwen was 
elected State Superintendent, and was directed to “report a
-P-A-G-E-31
Mi BQr 
plan for organizing a system of common schools to the next 
session of the General Assembly.” 
In 1837 Superintendent McEwen made a report, which, in- 
stead of presenting a plan for organizing common schools, was. 
devoted to showing reasons why such a system should not be 
organized. 
The following extracts, selected from various portions of 
his report, show his personal views, and also furnish contem- 
poraneous evidence of the condition of the school-system, and 
of the public sentiment : 
“Tn the discharge of the duties of his office, the State Super- 
intendent has directed his attention in an easauie! manner to- 
the fund called the common school fund, which he found in a 
scattered, and some of it in a very precarious condition; and 
_ the collection-of a portion of it has been and will continue to 
be attended with very great difficulties.” 
He states the total amount of this fund so far collected andin- 
vested to be $310,346.15, and continues: 
“ When we cast our eyes upon the map of the State, and con- 
sider its geographical extent, its number of counties, its scat- 
tered population, and number of schools that will be required 
to make them accessible to all, we are persuaded that no fund 
which we have now or can fe to command for many years to. 
come, is at all adequate to the support of any system of com- 
mon schools to be organized independently of individual co- 
operation. We must, therefore, legislate, IF WE LEGISLATE AT 
ALL UPON THIS SUBJECT, with a view to the means within our 
power; and to lure and to call into action, individual efforts, in 
this department of education. All, then, that can be reasonably 
expected of the Legislature at this time, is to devise the best 
system of common schools, suited to our situation, and by a 
conditional appropriation of the fund subject to be, appropriated, 
assist in putting them into operation, * * * 
“The appropriation should be upon condition that each district 
erect at some suitable place, a comfortable school-house, with
-P-A-G-E-32
enc sy ae 
the usual furniture, and raise a net sum of money for the sup- 
port of the school, equal, at least, to that apportioned to the 
Gistiict.. * 
“ Public schools sustained exclusively by public funds, have seldom 
been known to succeed well for any length of time. It is with them 
as it is with banks; individual interests must be blended, and 
they should predominate.” 
After alluding to the academies and colleges, their excellent 
work and high reputation, he adds: 
“ All, therefore, have proportionate claims to the countenance 
and patronage of the Legislature. And there is no subject 
which can come before them more worthy of their attention. 
To think, therefore, of establishing a system of common schools, 
from which any practical good is to result, to the neglect of 
higher seminaries of learning, is altogether visionary.” 
He concludes his report as follows: 
“For example, let one-third, or a portion of the profits and 
interests aforesaid, be appropriated to each of the grand divis- 
ions of the State for the endowment or use of colleges, another 
for the use of academies, both male and female, in the different 
counties, and the remaining portion in such manner as that the 
same may be annually distributed among the common schools 
throughout the State; all under such regulations and restric- 
tions as may be deemed expedient, one of which, in relation to 
higher institutions, should be that nothing shall be charged for 
tuition for those who will agree to become teachers in the com- 
mon schools, and keeping in view the principle of associating 
individual effort with public munificence.” 
~The message of Governor Newton Cannon is far more fayor- 
able to the organization of a school-system. I quote from this 
able document as follows: 
“T have ever considered it the duty of the Legislature to 
cherish literature and science, and to support and encourage 
common schools throughout the State, and have pressed its con- 
sideration upon the General Assembly during its last regular
-P-A-G-E-33
BAGO. Be 
session in two different messages. * * * Some contend that 
we should begin by patronizing to the extent of our means our 
colleges and academies; others believe the wiser policy to be the 
encouragement. to the same extent of common schools, with a 
view to the diffusion of knowledge among the community at_ 
large. My own opinion has ever been in favor of the latter, 
but I believe that our present institutions are highly defective.” 
Governor Cannon then presented an argument in favor of in- 
dustrial training which reads like the best essays on manual 
training from the most progressive educators of the present day. 
I cannot forbear to present a short extract, as follows: 
“Tt cannot be doubted that the powers of the mind are, in a 
great degree, dependent on the soundness and vigor of the body. 
* * * Hence, it may be safely assumed that in order to in- 
sure the greatest degree of mental power, that of the body 
should be developed and increased by a well-directed course of 
exercise, commencing at an early age, and regularly continued 
to full maturity. * * * Hence, according to the opinions 
I entertain on the subject, any system of education, to attain 
the highest practical degree of human power, whether mental 
or physical, as well as the discipline necessary to the proper 
regulation of that power, must combine with it habitual labor 
and industry.” 
The report of the legislative committee on education em- 
bodies the views urged by Superintendent McEwen, and: rec- 
ommends a division of the funds between colleges, academies, 
and common schools. They unite their testimony to that of 
Superintendent McEwen as to the utter inefficiency of the com- 
mon school system, but present a much more roseate view of 
the future. 
They set forth that the permanent school-fund of which Su- 
perintendent McEwen reports that $310,346.15 had been col- 
lected, would amount by the sales of the Ocoee lands to $1,500,- 
‘000 or more. 
I quote from the report as follows: 
“The interest would amount to nearly $100,C00 per annum if
-P-A-G-E-34
ae So 
the capital were properly invested, and this sum would be am- 
ply sufficient for the support of a system of common schools, 
founded upon the plan which has succeeded so well elsewhere, 
of a partnership between State munificence and individual en- 
terprise and liberality.” 
They recommend that $600,000 of surplus revenue be made 
a permanent academy fund, and the interest used for the benefit 
of academies, and that $300,000 of surplus revenue be made a 
college fund, the interest to be annually divided between three 
colleges, one in each grand division of the State. 
I quote again from this report: 
“ By the bill which accompanies this report it will be per- 
ceived that it is proposed to connect these three divisions of ed- 
ucation in one grand whole, appropriating to each a sum which 
will be amply sufficient, it is believed, for the establishment of ane 
efficient and liberal system.” 
The report concludes as follows: 
“Tt may not be ascribed to heated fancy to affirm that the very 
passage of this bill will exert an instantaneous and powerful 
influence throughout the length and breadth of Tennessee, 
* * * * and that it will kindle our entire population to 
ardor in the cause of education.” 
In estimating the sum of $100,000 to be sufficient for main- 
taining common schools, the committee doubtless meant that 
this sum, being a much larger contribution than the State had . 
heretofore made, would stimulate the several districts to pro- 
vide sufficient means. The law, however, as passed by the 
Legislature at this session, does not contain the features which 
the committee describe in their report. It is entitled “An Act 
to establish a system of common schools in Tennessee,’’ but does 
not differ materially from former laws. It contains among 
_others, u provision to empower the commissioners to collect 
from parents and guardians who have sent children to any pub- 
lic school, a fund sufficient to meet any deficiency that may be 
incurred in the salary of teachers, and which the public fund is 
inadequate to defray.

In 1839 the legislative committee of investigation found the 
entire school-fund to be $1,399,800.98. The committee reports 
that this fund had been badly managed, and recommended 
means to improve its management. They say: 
“The Legislatures of our State have long and perseveringly 
engaged in the difficult business of accumulating a valuable 
fund for purposes of education. But in spite of all their efforts, 
it has been time after time plundered by a thousand hands.” 
The friends and opponents of public schools agreed in one 
point—the utter inefficiency of previous systems. 
In 1844 the Legislature passed a law abolishing the office of 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction and devolving the 
duties upon the State Treasurer, which change took effect 
March 1, 1845. ¥ 
At the same session, 1844, an amendment was enacted, 
which being ambiguous in its terms, was construed and 
amended in the following year. This enactment prohibited 
any county from receiving its annual share of the school-fund 
until the county should raise by local taxation an amount equal 
to its distributable share from the State. It was the intent of 
this statute to stimulate each county to local taxation. It failed, 
however, to produce any marked effect. The State school-fund 
was so small-that the distributable share of each county was 
insignificant. Besides, there was no real public school system. 
The school-money, when received by the counties, was, in 
. nearly all of the districts, distributed among the private schools, 
in the ratio of their enrolled pupils, and was used as a credit on 
the tuition of those who were willing to accept it. It thus 
came to be regarded as a sort of charity fund. 
Public sentiment did not demand a public system. The peo- 
ple were attached to their private schools. All their antece- 
dents and traditions led them to view private schools with con- 
fidence and faver. They distrusted the efficiency and economy 
of a public system of free schools, and the failure of the efforts 
to maintain such a system without adequate funds had not 
tended to remove their prejudices.

’ ’ 
In 1848 an illustration was placed before the eyes of the peo- 
ple of the State which gave the first object lesson of a publie 
system. An efficient system of public schools was established 
in the city Nashville, the successful operation of which blazed 
as a beacon light in education. 
These schools have grown in efficiency and reputation to 
the present time. Under the administration of their able and 
progressive superintendent, Mr. Z. H. Brown, they are recog- 
nized as an ornament to the “Athens of the South.” 
From the time of their establishment to the present they 
haye been an important factor in stimulating, throughout the 
State, an increasing sentiment in favor of public schools. The 
example was followed by the cities and by a few of the counties: 
No efficient general system, however, was established by the 
State until 1867. 
The law of 1867 was entitled “An Act for the reorganization, 
supervision, and maintenance of common schools.” It contained 
many excellent provisions. It provided for the election of a 
State Superintendent, and was the first enactment which placed 
the office of State Superintendent upon an efficient footing. 
This law introduced three features which the former school-sys- 
tems of Tennessee had lacked—county supervision, adequate 
funds for the maintenance of the schools, and power to regulate 
the system. 6 
The statistics for the year ending October 7, 1869, show that 
the total scholastic population of the State was 418,725; the 
total number of schools was 3,903; total number of pupils en- 
rolled was 185,845. The report shows that the average annual 
amount expended for each of the two years embraced in the re- 
port was: For salaries and expenses, $299,641.16; for building 
school-houses, $425, 000. These statistics are sition to ex- 
plain what the Legislature of 1867 meant by entitling their act, 
“An Act for the maintenance of schools” instead of an act. for 
the “encouragement and support of schools.” , 
This law of 1867 was an efficient law, and it was efficiently
-P-A-G-E-37
eS 
& ' 
administered by the able State Superintendent, Gen. John Eaton. 
Yet, it was enacted in advance of popular sentiment and was 
not sustained by the people. No institution, however good, can 
thrive in this country unless it is engrafted in the affections of 
the people. 
» Thus, the law of 1867 was repealed in 1870; but the seed 
had been sown, and in a few years sprung up and bore good 
fruit. 
PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN 1873. 
When the Legislature assembled in 1873, evidences of a strong 
popular sentiment in favor of an efficient system of public 
schools came from all portions of the State. This sentiment 
was met by a strong counter sentiment of skepticism on the 
part of many, and of active opposition on the part of some of 
our best and ablest men. Finally a public school bill, drafted 
and recommended by the committee of the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation, was enacted, with slight amendment, and is now 
known as the “Act to establish and maintain a uniform system 
of public schools.” 
This act, together with its subsequent amendments, has estab- 
lished and maintained a permanent system of elementary public 
schools, steadily improving in efficiency and growing in popular 
favor. The system can hardly be called “uniform,” although 
it is beginning, under the recent amendments, to approach uni- 
formity and symmetry. 
Our system is a mixed system. The law partly commands, 
partly permits, and partly suggests. The system partakes of 
the features of a State system, a county system, and a district 
system. The State exercises a general supervision, contributes 
annually to the school-revenues the interest on the permanent 
school-fund, which, in 1873, was less than $90,000, but which 
has now increased to $150,000, a poll-tax of $1 on each taxable 
poll, and a property-tax of fifteen cents on each $100; pre- 
scribes certain regulations for the counties and the districts, 
grants certain discretionary powers, and suggests certain meth- 
ods of administration.
-P-A-G-E-38
Brees 
Each county exercises county supervision through its Super- 
intendent, and is empowered through its County Court to sup- 
plement the revenues by a levy on polls, property, and _privi- 
leges, not to exceed the entire State tax for all purposes. 
Each district exercises supervision and control through its 
directors, who are invested with large discretionary powers in 
the use of the school-fund and in the management of the schools. 
In the law as originally enacted, the district was empowered to 
levy an additional tax either to increase the length of the school- 
term or to extend the course of study. This portion of the law 
was pronounced unconstitutional by the courts, and was subse- 
quently repealed. The Constitution of the State does not per- 
mit a subordinate civil district to levy a tax. This power is 
limited to the General Assembly, the County Court, and the au- 
thorities of the municipal corporation. Thus, one important 
link in the general plan of the school-system was broken, and 
the power of providing for the introduction of the higher 
branches was lost to the districts. 
In 1885 the General Assembly, at its extra session, repaired 
this broken link as far as the Constitution would permit, and 
took the only step in its power to provide for local taxation. A 
law was passed empowering municipal corporations to levy ad- 
ditional taxes and to establish “graded high schools.” Thisen- 
actment was eminently wise, and has led to important results. 
Graded high schools are now in efficient operation in all of the / 
cities and in many of the towus. The rapid development of 
these corporation schools during the last four years is largely 
due to the active exertions of my predecessor, Hon. Frank M. 
Smith. It is to be hoped that every municipal corporation in 
the State will hasten to make use of this privilege. 
The successful operation of the corporation schools has pro- 
duced the effect to maké the country districts feel still more 
keenly the lack of the power of local taxation. Demands came 
to the General Assembly, at its last session, from many portions 
of the State, and these demands were strengthened by the me- 
morial of the State Teachers’ Association and the recommenda- 
tions of the Public School Officers’ Association.
-P-A-G-E-39
a ll 
The General Assembly sympathized with these demands, and 
yet, was restrained by the fear of “impairing the efficiency of ele- 
mentary instruction, which is and always must be the foundation 
of every good school-system.” A general system of secondary 
schools could not be provided without additional revenues. 
No power could he given the school-districts to levy a tax, and 
the County Courts already possessed all the power which the 
Legislature could bestow. To permit the elementary schools 
to be ruined by diluting them with an influx of higher 
branches without providing for additional teaching force was 
not to be thought of. 
' The solution of the problem was rendered still more diffi- 
cult by the unequal progress and the differing educational con- 
ditions of the several counties. Some of the counties had 
availed themselves of the privilege, provided by law, of supple- 
‘menting the school-reyenues by county taxation, and had gone 
to the extreme limit of the law. Some of these counties, whose 
dense population and large amount of taxable property yielded 
ample revenues, were maintaining elementary schools of full 
terms, and could afford to establish secondary schools, and 
maintain them in efficiency. Other counties of sparse popula- 
tion and possessing but a small amount of taxable property, 
although levying the maximum rate of tax, could maintain 
their elementary schools only for shoit terms, in some cases 
not more than three months, Other counties, and among them 
‘some of the most opulent counties, had never levied a tax 
sufficient to render their elementary schools efficient. Upon 
the whole, the educational report for 1890 showed tbat ele- 
mentary schools had been maintained in the State only eighty- 
six days, on the average, and that much was yet lacking to 
render the élementary system complete. 
The action of the General Assembly was wise, progressive, 
and conservative. Amendments were adopted permitting the 
introduction of secondary education in districts whose revenues 
are sufficient to maintain it, without forcing it upon districts 
which are not ready for it, or cannot maintainit. At the same 
time, an important step was taken towards bringing the 
school-system into symmetry.

Tur AMENDMENTS oF 1891. + 
These amendments, although enacted during the school-year 
ending June 30, 1891, could not be put into operation until the 
organization ofthe schools of the new year, beginning July 1, 
1891. They constitute a step in the direction of a complete 
system of education. The State was maintaining a system of 
elementary schools, a State university, a normal college, and 
institutions for the benefit of unfortunate classes. In addition 
to the State institutions, there are in Tennessee a number of 
colleges and universities endowed by religious and benevolent 
associations, and by private munificence. 
Thus, ample facilities, both public and private, have for many 
years been afforded for collegiate education. Facilities steadily 
improving in efliciency, are provided for elementary education 
in the public schools. A wide chasm is left open between the 
elementary school and the colleges. 
There are many good academies and private schools, and a 
few schools especially adapted to prepare pupils for college. 
The framers of the school-luw of 1873 attempted to bridge the 
chasm by making use of these private schools and academies. 
They provided for what they styled “consolidated schools,” and 
empowered the Directors to make contracts of consolidation 
with the authorities of “academies, seminaries, colleges, or pri- 
vate schools, by which the public schools may be taught in such 
institutions; Provided, That the branches of study designated 
in” the school-law “shall be taught free of any charge in such 
consolidated schools; And provided further, That the authority 
of the County Superintendent, District Directors, and other 
school-officers over those studying such branches shall beas full 
and ample as in the ordinary public schools.” 
This provision of law was, perhaps, the best that could be 
made at the time. The State was passing from a private school 
system to a public school system. The school-revenues were 
insufficient to maintain even the elementary schools, and totally 
inadequate to provide for secondary education. 
Tke private schools and academies afforded the means to | :
-P-A-G-E-41
— 40 — 
' 
adopt- a temporary expedient by which secondary education 
could be, at least, fostered and encouraged. Many of these 
consolidated schools have done excellent work, and deserve 
commendation. Yet it needs no argument to show that they 
can never supply the connecting link of a complete public sys- 
tem. ‘They are not so distributed as to be accessible to the mass 
of pupils who need secondary instruction. They are depend- 
ent upon private enterprise, varying in character and adminis- 
tration with the individual views of their teachers or founders, 
and they cannot be modeled to fit any definite place in a gen- 
eral system. They cannot supply free tuition. 
The amendments contained in Chapter 132, Acts of 1891, 
provide for two classes of schools, designated respectively pri- 
mary and secondary. The establishment of primary schools is 
required, the establishment of secondary schools is permitted, and 
the course of study for each is prescribed. Provision is also 
made for grading the schools and for granting State certificates 
to those who complete the course of the primary schools and 
State diplomas to those who complete the course of the second- 
ary schools. A further discussion of. the features of these 
amendments, together with the text of the law and the regula- 
tions adopted in pursuance thereof, will be found in Circular 
No. 1, issued from this office June 8, 1891, and submitted with 
this report as an exhibit. 
Errect or tHe AMENDMENTS oF 1891. 
Secondary Schools.—These amendments could not go into ef- 
fect during the year ending June 30, 1891, and hence the statis- 
tics of the secondary schools cannot enter into this report. Yet 
the time fixed by law for the publication of the annual report 
reaches so far into the new year that an opportunity is afforded 
to note some of the effects of the law. 
In its original form the school-bill provided as follows: “In 
every secondary school two or more teachers shall be employed, 
consisting of a principal and one or more assistants.” This 
clause was amended, on the passage of the bill, to stand as it now 
reads in the law: “Every secondary school shall consist of a
-P-A-G-E-42
ie aa es 
principal, and when necessary an assistant or assistants may be 
employed.” 
The original mandatory provision was intended to protect 
the primary education and the little children, by preventing 
the introduction of higher branches of study into schools 
which did not employ sufficient teaching force to perform the 
work properly. It was feared by many friends of the bill, 
and I was among those who participated in the fear, that the 
withdrawal of this limitation would amount to a general and 
horizontal extension of the curriculum. It required but a reso- 
lution of the Directors, declaring all schools of the district to 
be secondary schools, and the door would be open to a flood 
of “higher branches,” which would inundate their course of 
study, and destroy their efficiency. 
The experience of the current year has proven these fears to 
be groundless, and has shown that the confidence which the law 
reposed in the Directors has not been misplaced. Reports, 
filed in this office, September 18, 1891, from seventy-eight 
counties, show that out of 5,846 schools of the current year, 
5,375 are primary, and 471 are secondary. Thus only eight per 
cent. of the schools of these seventy-cight counties are second- 
ary. It is not probable that the returns from the remaining 
eighteen counties will materially change this ratio. It thus 
appears that our people understand something of school man- 
agement, and are in no hurry to ruin their own schools by the 
rash introduction of secondary branches before they are pre- 
pared to meet the additional expense. ? 
Grading.—The effect of the provision for grading the school- 
course is also salutary. Nearly all the schools of the State are 
now graded, in the meaning attached to the term by the Ten- - 
nessee statute, which differs somewhat from the pedagogical 
sense of the word. Previous statutes had designated certain 
branches of study to be taught in the schools, but had made no 
provision for regulating the course of study in these branches. 
The supervising officers were entirely without authority, and 
the District Directors had authority only under the general 
power conferred on them to manage theschools. This authority
-P-A-G-E-43
ea eee 
‘ 
was rarely exercised by any one, and the matter was generally 
left in the hands of the teacher. Many of the teachers were in- 
experienced, and needed some general guide to regulate the 
course of study. Besides, in the frequent change of teachers in 
the same schools, and the changes of pupils from one school to 
another, the lack of some recognized plan of classification 
caused great trouble and confusion, and deprived many pupils 
of the opportunity to pursue a consecutive course of study. 
Hon. A. S. Draper, the able and distinguished State Superin- 
tendent of New York, demonstrated by actual figures the in- 
stability of the teachers’ profession.. He gathered statistics 
from the several school-districts, and presents them in tabu- 
lated form. Pa 
Tf{e thus comments on them: 
“Tt is here shown by actual official reports from more than ~ 
ninety per cent. of all the districts in the State, that in more 
than half of these districts reporting, the teachers have never 
taught in the same school but a single term, and that in almost 
four-fifths of them the employment of the same teacher has not 
extended beyond a single year.” 
No similar statistics have ever been gathered in this State; 
but, if such be the case in New York, where the public school 
system has been so long in operation, better results could not 
be expected in Tennessee, whose school-system is not yet nine- 
teen years old. With such demonstration of the instability of 
the teacher’s employment, the necessity becomes more apparent 
to secure some degree of stability in the school itself; so that a 
fixed order and a consecutive course of study may be pursued 
by the pupils, notwithstanding the change of teachers. The 
Legislature provided “grading” as the remedy, employing the 
term to mean that the course of study shall be divided into 
clearly defined parts, called grades; that these grades shall be 
arranged in consecutive order, and the pupils shall be assigned 
to these grades according to their respective advancement, and 
shall complete one grade before passing to another. 
The way had been paved before the passage of the law, by
-P-A-G-E-44
elegy S’ 
the exertions of my predecessor aided by the active co-opera- 
tion of many of the County Superintendents and District Di- 
rectors. : 
Many counties had discovered the advantages of grading the 
schools, and had secured them by voluntary agreement be- 
tween the Directors at a general meeting. Many years will yet 
be required to render the grading accurate and complete, but 
marked effects have already been produced in improving the 
organization and management of the schools. 
Certificates and Diplomas.—The certificates and diplomas pro- 
vided for in the law of 1891, will be productive of much good, 
if judiciously awarded. There will be a strong temptation to 
award them as a matter of course. If such a policy is pursued, 
they will soon cease to be esteemed, and will rather tend to 
bring reproach upon the school-system. The official circular 
issued from this office, containing the laws in relation to them, 
and the regulations made in pursuance thereof, will be found 
in Appendix B. i 
Tur System Not Yur Compete. 
While an important step forward has been taken; our public 
system is not yet complete. The primary school term is still 
too short in many of the counties, and the average duration of 
schools throughout the State should be greater than 96 days. ~ 
The chasm between the schools and colleges is not yet 
closed. The establishment of secondary schools is still not 
mandatory, but only optional with each district. Their course 
of study is framed not so much for the benefit of those who are 
preparing for college as for the benefit of those who are 
preparing to omit college. The latter constitute by far the ma- 
jority, and their needs demand more urgently the tender con- 
sideration of the State. The secondary schools, although not 
especially designed to be preparatory schools, and although 
their course of study does not entirely bridge the chasm, will 
afford to many pupils the means of traveling far on the road to 
college. Their course, except in the omission of linguistic
-P-A-G-E-45
sre Ag cae 
studies, reaches nearly to the requirements of the freshman 
class. 
A bill, known as the high school bill, giving each county the 
option to close entirely the chasm between the school and 
the college, was prepared in accordance with the reeommenda- 
tions of the Public Sehool Officers’ Association, was recom- — 
mended for passage by the Committee on Education of the 
House, and passed two readings in both branches of the Gen- 
eral Assembly, at its last session. This bill empowered the 
County Court of each county to levy a high school tax, to lay 
off the county into high school districts, and to establish high 
schools with acomplete curriculum, including classics and modern 
languages, and reaching every requirement for entrance into 
college. The Committee on Education, however, although fa- 
voring the passage of the bill, became convinced that the Gen- 
eral Assembly was not yet ready for this step, and the bill was 
not pressed to final passage. We must be content, for the pres- 
ent, with the secondary schools; and we shall have cause for 
congratulation if we can make them complete and thorough. 
Manuva TRarnine. 
_ Very little has been done in Tennessee in the way of intro- 
ducing manual training in the public schools. The school-law, 
. prescribing the course of study and providing that no other 
branches shall be introduced, practically prohibits ityexcept by - 
a very liberal construction. The city schools, however, are ex- 
empt from these limitations of the law. 
Except in the schools of the city of Nashville, no effort has 
been made in this direction, so far as I am informed. The 
schools of Nashville, during the past year, have introduced a 
_ system of drawing and manual training, which is producing 
good results.» The Peabody Normal College and the Watkins 
Institute Night Schools have begun the work of manual train- 
ing, so far as the introduction of “drawing.” In the State 
Normal College, however, the instruction in drawing looks 
rather towards training in the fine arts.
-P-A-G-E-46
BS geu 
The State University, at Knoxville, and the Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity, at, Nashville, have excellent schools in manual training, 
including the teaching of drawing, and practical instruction 
and work in the mechanic arts. 4 
The Tennessee Industrial School is doing admirable work in 
manual training. Very few other institutions for the education 
of white students have given this important subject any atten- 
tion. The universities and colleges for the education of colored 
youth, almost without an exception, have established excellent — 
departments devoted to manual training, which are in success- 
ful operation, and are aided by the Slater Fund: 
The introduction of some features of manual training, cer- 
tainly the introduction of drawing, into the rural schools must 
come in the near future. There are, however, many difticulties 
in the way. Neither the teachers nor public sentiment are yet 
prepared for it. This, however, should not deter us from 
making a beginning. { 
It would have been well for the State if the wise reeommen- 
dation of Governor Newton Cannon had been heeded in 1887, 
and the beginning had been made then. Manual training is 
especially needed in the schools of the South. With the grow- 
ing development of the varied industries of Tennessee should 
come a vigorous training of the minds of our children in the 
direction of the mechanic arts, in order to fit them to be the © 
leaders in the great expansion of our material resources, and to 
make our native population the wealth-producers in the coming 
era of prosperity. 
This instruction in the mechanic arts does not mean the 
teaching of a trade any more than our present course of study 
means the teaching of a profession. It would not be possible, 
certainly it would not be wise, to convert our present schools 
either into professional schools of law or medicine or into work- 
shops for teaching trades. But as our schools now serve to 
prepare the mind and taste for acquiring professions, so they 
may be eniarged to prepare the mind and taste for the mechanic 
arts. We should send the whole child to school, mind and
-P-A-G-E-47
SG = 
body. Both should be developed. The curriculum should be 
enlarged, with a view to training the hand and the eye, and to 
bringing all the physical organs into obedience to the mind. 
The activity of the child should be directed to mechanical 
knowledge, invention and skill, and his taste cultivated. Such 
a course of training will give a completeness to his education 
which will promote alike his intellectual, moral, esthetiv, and 
physical development. 
The enactment of an amendment to the school-law at the 
next session of the General Assembly, permitting and encour- 
aging the introduction of drawing in the public schools, and 
also permitting additional manual exercises, but not making 
them compulsory, would open the door to the introduction and 
gradual development of a course of training which would be 
useful and honorable alike to the children of the rich and the 
children of the poor. 
Privats ScHoons. 
  It is difficult to obtain accurate statistics of private schools. 
An incomplete list of such institutions will be found in Table 
XI., Appendix A. 
A sketch of the origin, growth, and general characteristics of 
the academies, seminaries, and other private schools of Tennessee 
has been given elsewhere in this report. Their present organi- 
zation does not differ materially from that previously described. 
One important change, however, may be noted in their work. 
A larger number than heretofore are narrowing’ the curriculum 
within definite bounds, and are assuming more the character of 
college preparatory schools. They vary greatly in organization 
and scope, but, in general, work harmoniously with the public 
system. : 
- Many of them have united with the public schools under con- 
tracts of consolidation, by which the department of the school 
which includes the elementary branches becomes a public 
school, and the pupils are admitted free of charge, while the de-
-P-A-G-E-48
Ao 
partment which includes the higher branches retains its 
autonomy as a private school, and is maintained by tuition fees. 
Other private schools operate independently of the public sys- 
tem, and are maintained by tuition fees. A few of these are 
» aided by small endowments. 
Co-education of the sexes is the exception rather than the rule 
with the private institutions. 
The academies for males generally include a classical course, 
even those designed to prepare boys for business rather than for 
college. 
There are a few strictly preparatory schools. Several of 
these are schools of great excellence and reputation, whose 
courses of study are complete and thorough, and whose certifi- 
cates of proficiency are worthy of acceptance by any college in 
_ the United States. 
Femate Epvucarion. 
Tennessee is well represented in the line of private institu- 
tions for female education. Asa general rule these schools are 
the outcome of private munificence, sometimes of a single indi- 
vidual, oftener, of the combined liberality of an intelligent com- 
munity. Some of them are under the fostering control of re- 
ligious bodies, whose members have contributed to their es- 
tablishment, yet none are managed in a narrow sectarian spirit. 
These institutions offer very valuable facilities for the scholas- 
tic training of girls and young women. They present, as was 
to be expected, great diversity imsuch points as the extent of 
the curriculum, the thoroughness of the instruction given, the 
qualifications of the teachers, and the adequacy of equipment 
for the work of education. Many of these institutions present 
only a very moderate academic course of instruction, but as 
they are conveniently located and offer cheap rates, they supply 
a positive need of the country. Others show courses quite ex- 
tensive for institutions of their class, covering the substantial 
branches of education with comparative fulness, and offering 
also the finer accomplishments of female culture. A few of
-P-A-G-E-49
Le Aan 
these institutions give evidence of progressive, thorough, and 
comprehensive work in the field of liberal education, reaching 
a high grade of scholarship, and offering, in one conspicuous in- 
stance at least, the privileges of university training for young 
ladies. 
There has been a steady and gratifying improvement in the 
growth and in the outcome of the higher institutions for women. 
The stimulus tf competition has led to the employment of bet- 
ter teachers, and this has reacted favorably, both upon the stand- 
ard of scholarship and upon the methods of discipline and in- 
struction. 
In all these schools sentiments of the purest morality are in- 
eulcated, mingled with those sanctions of religion which con- 
stitute at once the basis and the aim of the highest and the 
most enduring character. 
Hrener Epucatron. 
Tennessee does not lack for colleges and universities. A 
general sketch of their origin and growth has been given else- 
where. A list of these institutions, and a portion of their sta- 
tistics will be found in Table XI., Appendix A. 
‘ Many of these colleges and universities are doing useful work, 
notwithstanding the inadequacy of their endowment funds, 
‘Others have large endowments, or State aid, and are enabled to 
employ full faculties, to provide all modern appliances, and, in 
addition to maintaining literary departments of very high order, 
to keep in successful operation departments of law, medicine, 
theology, pharmacy, dentistry, engineering, pedagogics, art, 
manual training, business education, etc. 
There are also a number of special or technical institutions 
operating independently of the literary colleges and universities. 
Among these may be mentioned the Nashville School of Fine 
Arts-and the business colleges located in Memphis, Nashville, 
Chattanooga, and Knoxville. 
All these higher institutions, perhaps without an exception,
-P-A-G-E-50
AO 
are growing in efficiency and prosperity. The work of the 
present year is the most successful in their history. The growth 
of the public school system has been felt in the increased at- 
tendance at the colleges, while the facilities which the colleges 
offer for higher education so near at home, have stimulated the 
development of the public schools, and elevated the standard. 
Strate Iysrrrurrons. 
In addition to its institutions for charitable purposes, such as 
asylums for the insane, ete., which do not come within the pur- 
view of this report, the State maintains, in whole or in part, 
four institutions which are partly charitable and partly educa- 
tional, and two which are strictly educational. Some of these 
are maintained or aided by the State by annual appropriations, 
and some by the interest on invested funds, donated by the 
State, or held by the State as trustee. Sketches of these insti- 
tutions will be found in Appendix F, and it is unnecessary here 
to do more than state a few facts with regard to them. 
The University of Tennessee.—Since its reorganization under 
Dr. 0. W. Dabney, this institution’ has been greatly improved. 
Its curriculum has been extended, its faculty enlarged, and its 
attendance increased. New buildings have been erected, and 
the old buildings re-modeled. Apparatus and appliances have 
been provided, and its facilities are those of a first-class State 
university. During the past year,in addition to other improve- 
ments, the establishment of the Teachers’ Department is a val- 
uable contribution to the educational interests of the State. 
This department is conducted under the direction of Hon. Frank 
M. Smith, formerly State Superintendent of Tennessee. It af- 
fords an opportunity to the teachers of the State to perfect 
themselves in those branches of study in which they. may be 
deficient, and to acquire some knowledge of the history of edu- 
cation, and the theory and practice of teaching.

Irefer. The university is organized in three departments, as 
follows: 
(1) The Peabody Normal College, which is maintained by appro- 
priation from the Peabody Fund, the University of Nashville, 
‘and the State of Tennessee, is controlled by three boards, whose 
harmonious co-operation is rewarded by the present prosperous 
condition of the college. .The benefits of this college are not 
confined to the State. It is, perhaps, better equipped for im- 
parting higher normal instruction than any institution in the 
United States, and in addition to its scholarships it offers free 
tuition to all the States aided by the Peabody Education Fund. 
(2) The Medical Department of the University of Nashville and 
Vanderbilt University is the oldest medical college in the South- 
west, and is the property of the University of Nashville, being 
conducted under the joint authority of the two universities. It 
has enjoyed a long career of usefulness and prosperity. 
(8) The Montgomery Bell Academy was founded in 1867 by the 
bequest of a public-spirited citizen, whose name it bears. The 
fund for its establishment was bequeated to the Trustees of the 
University of Nashville, to found an academy to prepare boys 
for college. It is under the management of Professor 8. M. D. 
Clark as principal, has a faculty of eight teachers, and is thor- 
oughly organized, graded, and equipped, being maintained by 
the interest on its endowment-fund of $50,000, and by tuition 
fees. 
The Institution for the Deaf and Dumb partakes of the nature 
of a charitable institution and of an educational institution. 
The useful and benevolent work of this institution, and the 
methods of mstruction employed, are set forth in the sketch 
prepared by its able principal, Professor Thomas L. Moses, and 
which will be found in Appendix F. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind.—This school is doing a 
noble work. Professor 8S. A. Link, its devoted superintendent, 
has done much to bring it to its present state of excellence. He 
has given especial attention to improving its educational feat- 
ures, as may be seen by reference to his report in Appendix F.

Watkins Institute was founded by the bequest of Mr. Samuel 
Watkins, of Nashville, who left by his will a fund to the State 
of Tennessee as trustee for the benefit of laboring men. The 
State accepted the trust, and appointed a board of commission- 
ers to manage the property conveyed, which is valued at 
$200,000. 
The income is devoted, in accordance with the provisions of 
the will, to aiding the Tennessee Historical Society, and the 
Howard Library, and to maintaining courses of public lectures, 
and free night schools. 
The night schools have been established for more than five 
years, and are open to all citizens of the State, subject to the 
necessary limitations of space and discipline. 
These schools are efficiently conducted under Superintendent 
H. C. Weber, and are doing a useful work, a work for which 
there is no other provision. 
Tennessee Industrial School.—This school was_ originally 
founded, -in 1885, by the munificence of Col. E. W. Cole, of 
Nashville, was subsequently donated ‘to the State, and was ac- 
cepted in 1887. Its purpose is defined by law as follows: “The 
object and purpose of said corporation being to receive, care 
for, and promote the welfare of children who would otherwise 
probably become lewd, base or criminal.” 
The State makes an annual appropriation for the support of 
this institution. It 1s to be regretted that illness has arrested 
the work of Superintendent Kilvington while engaged in the 
preparation of a sketch setting forth the objects and adminis- 
tration of this institution. 
In Appendix F will be found the law of 1891, governing the 
-admission of children, and a summary of the attendance. 
Epvucation oF THE CoLoRED PEOPLE. 
There is no State in the Union which affords better opportu- 
nities for the education of the colored race. Three institutions
-P-A-G-E-53
hs 
    po 
at Nashville—Fisk University, Roger Williams University, and 
Central Tennessee College and similar institutions in other 
parts of the State, are maintained by large endowments, and are 
aided by the Slater Fund. They afford to colored students 
ample facilities for acquiring collegiate education, and for train- 
ing in the mechanic arts. They attract students from other 
States and from Africa. 
The State makes an annual appropriation of $3,500, to pro- 
vide normal scholarships for colored pupils seeking to prepare 
themselves as teachers, and, in addition, affords colored students 
free tuition as cadets in the State University, where they are 
separately instructed in the university department of the Knox- 
ville College. 
The public school system provides for the instruction of col- 
ored pupils in separate schools of grade, efliciency, and dura- 
tion equal to the schools for whites. 
The statistics of the year show that the scholastic population 
‘of the colored race is about twenty-five per cent. of the total, 
that the number of colored pupils enrolled is twenty-two per 
cent. of the total, the average daily attendance of colored pu- 
pils is twenty-two per cent. of the total, the number of colored 
teachers employed is twenty-one per cent. of the total, the 
number of schools for colored pupils is twenty-two per cent. of 
the total, the number of weeks given to the State Institutes for 
colored teachers was thirty-two per cent. of the total number 
of weeks for which State Institutes were held. It thus appears 
that all the ratios by which the operations of a system may be 
tested—pupils enrolled, average daily attendance, number of 
schools established, teachers employed—continue each year to 
approach more nearly the ratio of scholastic population, and in 
spite of all obstacles have now reached three per cent. of that 
ratio, except in the ratio of teachers employed, in which the 
employment of a few white teachers in the colored schools 
causes that ratio to fall one per cent. behind the others. 
The length of time for the duration of the schools is the same 
for both races. The ratio of weeks given to instruction in In-

stitute work reaches ten per cent. beyond the ratio of scholastic 
population. ¥ 
State TracusErs’ Institutes. 
Since the establishment of the public school system in 1873, 
the “ Teachers’ Institutes” have been a potent agency in the 
hands of the State Superintendent. The testimony of my pre- 
decessors has been uniform as to the value of these useful ap- 
pliances. They have served not only the purpose of educating 
the teachers (reaching what the normal school cannot reach, 
the teachers already in the field), but they have served a pur- 
pose even more valuable, because it reaches deeper: they have 
been educators of public sentiment. Teachers, however skillful 
and well informed, cannot create or perfect a public school sys- 
tem. They cannot make laws. They cannot provide appli- 
ances and revenues. 
My predecessors have all felt the necessity of addressing the 
Institutes, not alone to the teachers, put also to the people. 
The Tennessee Institutes may be characterized as “ Popular In- 
stitutes.” 
In localities where the public system has long been in suc- 
cessful operation, the popular features are not so important. 
In communities where the public system is young and unma- 
tured, it is necessary to reach the people as a preliminary step 
to improving the teachers. 
It has been the aim of all my predecessors to use the Insti- 
tute to accomplish two purposes, viz.: To improve the teachers, 
and to engender public enthusiasm. A brief review of the 
work of these Institutes will more fully illustrate their inflnence. 
They were established at the wise suggestion, and maintained 
by the benevolent support, of the Peabody Education Fund. 
The first two State Institutes in Tennessee were held on the 
‘same day, July 20, 1874; one at Shelbyville and one at Cleve- 
land, under the direction of Hon. John M. Fleming. During 
the summer of 1874, ten Institutes were held in the State. The
-P-A-G-E-55
BAS 
total attendance was estimated at 600 teachers and 5,000 citizens. 
The large attendance of citizens in contrast with the small at- 
tendance of teachers is a sufficient testimony to their popular 
character. One effect of these Institutes was to save the 
school.law from repeal at the next session of the Legislature. 
Another effect was the improvement of the teachers. Superin- 
tendent Fleming comments, in his report, on the value of these | 
pioneer Institutes. 
_ The work was taken up by his successor, Hon. Leon Trous- 
dale, who used the Institute as a strong lever to move public 
sentiment during his entire administration of six years—the 
longest administration of any State Superintendent. In con- 
ducting these Institutes, Superintendent Trousdale so com- 
pletely won the confidenée of the people and so inspired the edu- 
eators of Tennessee, that he has ever since been known as ‘the 
Nestor of the public schools,” and the school-system has been 
regarded as a permanent.institution. 
During the first year of his term of office, the Peabody Board 
applied its appropriations for Tennessee to the establishment of 
the State Normal College, and withdrew the aid which they had 
previously extended to Teachers’ Institutes. Superintendent 
Trousdale found himself deprived of pecuniary means to carry 
on the Institute work. After appealing in vain to the Legisla- 
ture to make an appropriation for “these useful appliances,” he 
turned his attention to the difficult feat of carrying them on 
without money. How he accomplished this may be seen by 
reference to his reports and circulars. He organized a system 
of voluntary State and County Institutes, whose successful oper- 
ation exceeded even his own sanguine expectations. In 1877 
the general agent of the Peabody Fund was induced, by the ur- 
gency of Superintendent Trousdale, to appropriate a small sam 
from the Peabody Fund. 
The Institutes continued to be conducted on the peripatetic 
and popular plan until 1881, doing the work of diffusion as it 
can be done in no other way; improving the efficiency of the 
teaching force by going to those who needed help; guarding
-P-A-G-E-56
rs 
- the public school system, and planting its interests deep in the 
hearts of the people. 
Tn 1881 Superintendent Trousdale was succeeded by Dr. W.8, 
Doak, who was the descendant of a long line of ancestors eminent 
in the educational annals of the State. Dr. Doak made the effort 
to elevate the standard of Institute work to a higher plane, and to 
direct it more exclusively to the professional training’ of teach- 
ers, though not entirely omitting the popular Institutes. Se- 
lecting a delightful summer location at Knoxville, he established 
a general Institute for the State. This Institute was main- 
tained by appropriations from the Peabody Fund, and from the 
University of Tennessee, was taught by a complete and able 
faculty, had the use of all the grounds, buildings, and appliances 
of the State University, and was empowered to offer to teachers 
the inducement of a State certificate. It held four annual ses- 
sions, each continuing one month. It was, undoubtedly, in 
point of professional excellence, the best Institute ever held in 
the State. It failed, however, to reach the great body of teach- 
ers. They were not yet ready to seek such instrumental- 
ities for improvement. It was found also that theagency which 
had served so useful a purpose in arousing popular sentiment, 
was again needed in the field. 
The lamented death of Dr. Doak before the expiration of his 
term of office caused no change in the affairs of the Knoxville 
Institute. The work was taken up and continued by his suc- 
cessor, Professor Crawford. } 
In 1883 Hon. Thomas H. Paine came into office. The pro- 
fessional value of a central State Institute had been demon- ~ 
strated, und the lack of the peripatetic Institutes was beginning 
to be felt. Superintendent Paine’s views may be gathered from 
the following extract from his report for 1884: 
“Now, realizing that the highest welfare of the State is bound 
up with its schools, and having seen how inadequate and unsat- 
isfactory many of them are on account of inefficient instruction, 
discipline, and general management, I have deemed it my duty, 
after much reflection, to suggest legislation on this matter,
-P-A-G-E-57
BB Z 
making a small appropriation to be drawn on requisition of the 
State Superintendent (as other expenses of this department are), 
for the support of Institutes. If we could have one good In- 
stitute in each senatorial district of the State, for the benefit of 
both white and colored teachers, for a period of one month, 
judiciously and intelligently conducted, in which the faculty and 
graduates of our Normal College and other able and experienced 
educators could bring their instruction to bear upon the great 
body of our teachers scattered through the various counties, we 
should see, I apprehend, a marked improvement of our schools 
of every grade throughout the State. The sum of $5,000 per 
annum, economically used, would’ meet this expense for both 
white and colored Institutes. Then, with one grand central 
Institute at some eligible place in the State, or one for each 
‘grand division of the State, to be held for one month in mid- 
summer, such as we have a right to believe the Peabody Fund 
would support, I have no doubt all would at once be regarded 
with public favor as an important adjuvant of our educational 
system, and as essential to its continued elevation and prosper- 
ity. Especially would I recommend that the County Courts be 
authorized by law to make appropriations for Institute purposes 
in all counties where they are inclined to do so.” ' 
This recommendation seemed to meet the general favor of the 
Legislature. A bill was introduced, approved by the committees 
on education, passed one house, and only failed by the dilatory 
feeling which pervades legislative assemblies on questions where 
the sense of the people has not been tested. 
Superintendent Paine, finding that the appropriation from 
the Peabody Fund was not sufficient to maintain the compre- 
hensive system which he had recommended, determined to re- 
turn to the peripatetic plan, and to “ put the Institute on wheels,” 
as he pointedly expressed it. During the remainder of his ad 
ministration, he made excellent use of the popular Institutes, 
distributing them widely over the State. His judicious man- 
agement and personal popularity contributed to render them 
powerful agencies for good. Nothing has contributed more to 
the growing popularity and development of the public school 
system. t

My immediate predecessor, Hon. Frank M. Smith, continued 
the same general plan which had been adopted by Superintend- 
ent Paine, throwing into the work his well-known energy and 
organizing ability. In fact, he had long been an efficient Institute 
worker under former Superintendents, and much of the success 
of former Institute work was due to his active exertions. 
At its session of 1891, the General Assembly, for the first 
time in the history of the State, made an appropriation for 
holding Teachers’ Institutes. This appropriation of $1,500 
made by the State, and the sum of $2,000 contributed by the 
liberality of the Peabody Education Fund, afforded the oppor- 
tunity to make the Institute work of 1891 more complete than 
the work of any previous year. These Institutes were held 
mainly during the months of June and July; a few of them 
were held later. Thus, only a portion of their work falls prop- 
erly inthis report. In order, however, to avoid a year’s delay 
in reporting their operations, and in order to collate their sta- 
tistics as a whole, I have included all of them in the present re- © 
port. Statistical tables, showing their location, organization, 
enrollment, and cost, together with the reports of the several 
conductors, will be found in Appendix D. 
Twenty-four State Institutes were held during the year 1891; 
of which eighteen were for white teachers and seven were for 
colored teachers. The total number enrolled in the Institutes 
for white teachers was 2,692, and in the Institutes for colored 
teachers was 618; making a total enrollment of 3,310. The en- 
rolled members are classified in the table under two headings. 
The heading “Teachers,” includes only those engaged in the — 
active work of teaching. The heading, ‘School Officers and 
Citizens,” embraces persons preparing themselves to teach, Su- 
perintendents, Directors, Trustees, and citizens who are in some 
way connected with education, or who took suflicient interest 
in the Institutes to enroll themselves as members, and to attend 
regularly. 
In addition to the enrolled members, many citizens at- 
tended the meetings as visitors, especially at the night ~ 
lectures, and on the Farmers’ and Directors’ days. The attend-
-P-A-G-E-59
ee 
ance of visitors varied greatly at the different Institutes, at 
some places being small, and at other places numbering almost 
the entire population of the vicinity. In several cases, the con- 
ductors failed to report any estimate of the visitors. As nearly 
as I can ascertain, the average number of visitors at cach Insti- 
tute for white teachers was about 200, and at each Institute for 
colored teachers about sixty. It-is thus estimated that the 
total number of white visitors was about 3,600, and the total 
number of colored visitors about 360; making the total attend- 
ance of visitors about 8,960. Adding the total number of vis- 
itors to the total number of enrolled members, it appears that 
the State Institutes for the year 1891 reached directly about 
7,270 people. I shall not attempt to estimate their indirect in- 
fluence. 
They were conducted in. accordance with the general pro- 
gramme given in Appendix D, and the reports of their respect- 
ive conductors may be found in the same appendix. 
Institutes ror Wuite THaAcuers. 
I was fortunate in securing the services of an able and expe- 
rienced corps of Institute workers, most of whom had been 
trained in many years of honorable service, and all of whom 
evinced energy, skill, and fidelity. 
The first Institute in West Tennessee was held at Memphis, 
beginning June 8. It was conducted by Hon. Thos. H. Paine, 
whose administration for four years as State Superintendent is 
récognized as an important factor in the development of the 
school-system, and especially in the development of Institutes. 
His experience, thus matured, was invaluable, not only at Mem- 
_ phis, but also at the three other Institutes which he held, res- 
pectively at Brownsville, at Purdy, and at Savannah. 
Two other Institutes were held in West Tennessee; one at 
Covington and one at Martin. These were conducted by Prof. 
A. L. Purinton, of the Peabody Normal College. This is the 
first Institute work done in the State by Professor Purinton, 
although he has done valuable work in other States. It was 
work of high order, and deserves unqualified commendation.

The first Institute in Middle Tennessee was held at Tullaho- 
ma, beginning June 8. The conductor, Capt. A. D. Wharton, 
of Nashville, is a teacher of ripe scholarship and extended rep- 
utation, being a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. 
He has long been prominently connected with the summer | 
schools of Monteagle, serving as principal and instructor, and 
he is widely known as one of the best teachers in the State. He 
also conducted the Institutes at Centreville, Columbia, and 
Franklin. His management of these Institutes was eminently 
successful and satisfactory. 
Two other Institutes were held in Middle Tennessee, one at 
Springfield and one at Cookeville. These were conducted by 
Capt. C. 8. Douglass, Superintendent of the schools of Gallatin. 
He is a veteran Institute conductor, trained under my prede- 
cessors, and has no superior in his peculiar tact for rendering 
an Institute cheerful, practical, and instructive. is Institute 
at Cookeville registered the largest attendance in Middle Ten- 
nessee. 
Two Institutes began on the same day in East Tennessee, 
June 22. The one at Huntsville was conducted by Prof. H. A. 
Edwards, of Celina, a young man, who had bnt little previous 
experience. Expecting to act as assistant instructor, he found 
the work of conducting the Institute suddenly thrown on him 
by the absence of Professor Bachman, who had been appointed 
as conductor. Je labored under the additional disadvantage 
of having no assistant. Notwithstanding all this, he made the 
Institute one of the most useful and instructive which was held 
in the State, and evinced commendable qualities as an organizer 
and an instructor. 
All the other summer Institutes in East Tennessee, held res- 
pectively at Kingston, Benton, Dandridge, and Rogersville, were 
conducted by Prof. T. C. Karns, of the University of Tennes- 
see, who has, perhaps, participated in more Institutes than any 
worker in the field. He was elected the first Superintendent of 
Knox County under the law of 1873, and entered upon a career 
of Institute.work which has continued unbroken through the 
administrations of all the State Superintendents to the present
-P-A-G-E-61
° 
eigqee 
time. His work is always excellent, and his reports, running 
back for eighteen years, are full of valuable suggestions. 
An additional Institute was held at Rogersville Junction, be- 
ginning October 28, and continuing two days. This Institute 
differed from the others in length of term and in organization. 
Its organization is more fully explained in the report of its con- 
ductor, which will be found in Appendix D. 
My predecessor, Hon. F. M. Smith, had been unable, from 
the pressure of other duties, to give-me the aid of his experience 
and reputation in the summer work. By his approval and sug- 
gestion, the teachers of the four counties maintaining the joint 
Institute at Rogersville Junction requested that it should be 
converted into a State Institute. It gave me great pleasure to 
comply with this request, and the Institute, under Hon. Frank 
M. Smith as conductor, notwithstanding its short session of two 
days, accomplished useful and valuable work, and was one of 
the most pleasant and enthusiastic Institutes of the year. 
The conductors above named were sustained by an able corps 
of assistants, nearly all of whom were trained experts, and all 
of them deserve high commendation. For their excellent work 
at their respective Institutes, I return my thanks to Prof. A. 
L. Purinton, Mr. Wicliffe Rose, Mr. P. A. Lyon, Prof. J. E. 
Bailey, Mr. H.C. Weber, Mr. Wharton S. Jones, Mr. M. Rose, 
Mr. T. P. Thomas, Mr. C. 8. Brown, Mr. P. H. Manning, Su- 
perintendent M. R. Abernathy, Mr. R. E. Crockett, Miss Julia 
Doak, Mr. W. K. Abernathy, and Prof. W. M. Graybill.

The work of the Institutes for colored teachers was also ex- 
cellent and useful. 
At Covington two Institutes were in progress at the same 
time, one for white teachers and one for colored teachers. 
Both Institutes were under the management of the same corps 
of teachers, whose work has already been alluded to. The 
work of Mr. G. W. Perkins at Chattanooga, Messrs. J. C. Cobb 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
Le 
and B. J. Campbell at Knoxville, Messrs. B. A. J. Nixon and 
J. Batte at Clarksville, and of Messrs. A. R. Merry and D. F. 
Rivers at Jackson, evinced zeal, skill, and fidelity, and will do 
much towards improving the education of their race. At Lew- 
isburg, Prince Momolu Massaquoi, a native African prince, .° 
took part in the work. His peculiar and interesting history, his 
modest demeanor, and his powers'of eloquence, made him an 
object of interest, not only to his own race, but also to the 
white people of the vicinity. 
Suaaustions Ruearpine InstrruTys. 
The experience of the past teaches that the Institutes should 
be put on a permanent foundation, and regulated by law. In 
organizing a complete system, all the valuable features should 
be retained. We cannot afford to eliminate the popular 
features or the professional features. We need a class of Insti- 
tutes to do a higher grade of professional work, but we cannot 
afford to give up the peripatetic Institutes. 
In view of these considerations, I respectfully renew the 
recommendations of Hon. Thomas H. Paine, made in 1884, and 
given in the extract from his report quoted above. This plan 
contemplates that the State Superintendent shall hold annual 
Institutes in the several senatorial districts, to be in session for 
two or three weeks ; that he shall also hold annually in each grand 
division of the State one central Institute of high professional 
grade, to be in session for one or two months, and to be under 
the management of a complete faculty. Superintendent Paine 
estimated that such a system would cost the State about $5,000. 
With the assistance which is now given by the Peabody Fund, 
and which we have every reason to believe would be increased 
rather than diminished in aid of an efficient system, and with 
the further assistance from colleges in which the central Insti- 
tutes may be held, such as has been heretofore given by the 
University of Tennessee, it is safe to say that an appropriation 
from the State of $5,000 per annum would be sufficient. This 
sum taken from the school-fund would not diminish the length 
of the schobl-term one minute, and would not be felt by the 
children in lessening their school privileges in any way; but it
-P-A-G-E-63
—62—_ 
would be powerfully felt in improving the organization, in- 
struction, and management of the schools, and in the general 
elevation of the system. I am convinced that its use in this 
form would do the children more good than in any other form 
in which it could be spent for their benefit. 
To complete this system, I recommend that a regular course 
of reading and study, in connection with the central Institutes, 
and somewhat on the plan of “university extension,” be pro- 
vided for the teachers of the State through the medium of the 
State Superintendent’s office. Many of our teachers need im- 
provement in scholarship. Complete courses of instruction 
eannot be given during the short term even of the central In- 
stitutes contemplated in the above recommendations. The 
course of study in the summer Institutes should be made sys- 
tematic and progressive in accordance with the suggestions of 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry, general agent of the Peabody Fund, and 
should then be supplemented by a systematic and progressive 
course of reading and study underjudicious guidance, and reg- 
ulated by correspondence during the intervals between the ses- 
sions, and the results should be tested by thorough examination 
at the meeting of the Institutes.. This work should be further 
stimulated by granting State life diplomas of different grades 
to those attuining proficiency in the examinations. If the 
standard should be made high and kept high, the possession of 
a State life diploma would be valuable to the holder, and any 
teacher in the State might well be ambitious to obtain it. 
To secure these valuable results, I recommend the enactment 
of a law to establish and maintain a permanent system of Teach- 
ers’ Institutes, to prescribe a course of reading and study for 
the teachers of the State in connection therewith, and to pro- 
vide for State diplomas or certificates to teachers under the reg- 
ulations of the State Superintendent; and I further recommend 
that an additional clerk be employed in this office, at a salary 
sufficient to secure the services of a competent man, who shall 
discharge the duties connected with Institutes, examinations, 
and teachers’ courses of reading and study. s

The Tenneseee State Teachers’ Association is the oldest State 
educational organization. It was founded in August, 1867, and 
has exercised an important influence on the educational affairs 
of the State. In fact, it may be said to be the father of the 
present public school system. Its last meeting was held at

vention of school-officers was called together by Hon. John 
Eaton, and met at Nashville, November 13 and 14, 1867. A 
similar convention of school-officers was called by Hon. John 
M. Fleming, and met in Nashville in 1873. Both these conven- 
tions assembled upon the call of the State Superintendent, and 
no permanent organization was effected in either case. No - 
other meeting was held until 1888, when the public school of- 
ficers of the State assembled at Nashville upon the call of Hon. 
Frank M. Smith. A permanent organization was effected, and 
the association has ever since held annual meetings. 
The convention is eminently practical in its work, and has 
been useful alike to the Superintendents and the teachers. 
Its last session, held at the State Capitol, December 8, 9, 10, 
1891, with Hon. F. M. Smith as its president, was the most suc- 
cessful meeting in its history. 
The proceedings will be found in full in Appendix E. 
The Association of Tennessee Schools and Colleges held its fourth 
annual session at the South-western Presbyterian University, at 
‘Clarksville, November 5 and 6, 1891. 
This association first assembled upon the call of Vanderbilt 
University, and met at Nashville in 1888. As at first organized, 
its membership consisted of the several colleges of the State, 
each institution being represented by delegates. Representa- 
tives of the leading preparatory schools were present by invita- 
tion, but were not entitled to membership, the association being 
known as the “Association of Tennessee Colleges.” The meet- 
ing for 1889 was held at the University of the South, at Sewanee, 
and the meeting for 1890 at Cumberland University, at Lebanon. 
ss en 
At its last meeting in 1891, the name was changed as shown
-P-A-G-E-66
es , 
above, its membership was enlarged to include the schools en- 
gaged in preparing for college, and its organization was made 
more complete and permanent. 
As now organized, its sphere of usefulness is extended, and 
it is prepared to enter on a work greatly needed in the State 
_ —that of bringing the schools and colleges into harmonious co-- 
operation. The influence of its last meeting is already felt in 
the State. A committee was appointed, consisting of represent- 
atives from schools and colleges, of which Prof. W. M. Basker- 
vill, of Vanderbilt University, is chairman, to recommend a 
course in English for the schools of the State. ‘This committee 
has prepared an able and valuable report, which is printed with 
the proceedings of the association, and is commended to the 
careful consideration of teachers and school-ofticers. It will be 
found in Appendix E. 
The Southern Educational Association did Tennessee the honor 
to hold its annual meeting on her soil, July 8, 9, 10, 11, 1891. 
Several hundred representative teachers of the Southern States 
assembled at Lookout Mountain, and spent four days in dis- 
cussing educational matters, and in social intercourse. Every 
one of the fifteen Southern States was represented. The Asso- 
ciation was welcomed by Hon. Robert L. Taylor, ex-Governor 
of Tennessee, for the State, and by Mr. H. 8. Chamberlain for 
the city of Chattanooga. Responses were made by Hon. Josiah 
H. Shinn, president of the association, and by prominent edu- 
cators representing each of the Southern States. 
The papers and discussions which followed were practical, 
valuable; and able. No report of these addresses and discussions 
having been received at this office, it is impossible to present 
even a synopsis. The topics discussed were directed largely to 
questions peculiar to the conditions existing at the South. The 
following extracts from the constitution will explain the raison 
@etre of this association: 
“ PREAMBLE. 
“ Wuernas, The cause of education in the South is incum- 
bered by problems that exist in no other section of the Union, 
D—S, P. I.
-P-A-G-E-67
\ — 66 — 
-and as the workers in this field believe that by organization 
they may benefit the cause of education, especially in the South, 
and cheer one another amid the difficulties that surround them ; 
“TuerEFore, Without antagonism to any other association, 
we organize an association under the following 
‘¢ CONSTITUTION : 
“ArricLe I. Name.—This organization shall be known as 
‘The Southern Educational Association, and it shall hold an 
annual meeting at such time and place as shall be selected by 
the Executive Committee. 
“Articce II. Object_—The object of this association shall be 
to promote the cause of education, especially in the South. 
“Articie III. Membership.—The membership of the associa- 
tion shall consist of white persons, divided into two classes, ac- 
. tive and honorary. The active membership shall consist solely 
of teachers and friends of education engaged actively in pro- 
moting the cause of education in the South. Honorary mem- 
bers may be elected from any part of the Union, and shall have 
all the privileges of active members, except that of holding of- 
fice and;voting’? * * * °*

The Peabody Board of Trust has rendered invaluable aid and
-P-A-G-E-68
— 67 — e 
‘ 
encouragement to education in Tennessee ever since the estab- 
lishment of the public school system in 1873. 
During the past year it has contributed liberally to the sup- 
port of the Peabody Normal College and to the teachers’ In- 
stitutes. The distinguished general agent, Hon. J. L. M. Curry, 
has paid two visits to the State during the year, and has added 
to the value of the pecuniary contributions of the Peabody 
Fund by the useful suggestions which his extended experience 
has so well qualified him to make, and by the inspiration of his 
eloquent addresses. 
The cordial interest of the Peabody Board in the Normal 
College was agreeably manifested in the previous year by the 
visit of a committee of its members. It was especially grate- 
ful to the friends of the college and to the educational public to 
receive during the present year a second visit from Hon. Ruth- 
erford B. Hayes, ex-President of the United States, a distin- 
guished member of the Peabody Board, and president of the 
Slater Board. 
The aid which the Slater Board is extending to the colleges 
for the education of colored students is judiciously directed to 
the encouragement of manual training. The visit of ex-Pres- 
' ident Hayes drew especial attention to the work which the in- 
stitutions aided by the Slater Fund are doing in training the 
colored youth to skill in the mechanic arts. 
ConcLusIoN. 
I take this occasion to express my thanks to all my associates 
in the work of education for their cordial co-operation. The 
County and City Superintendents, the County Courts, the 
county officers, the District Directors, and the teachers, have 
all united in the effort to improve the schools. 
Their cordial assistance has not only filled me with personal 
gratitude, but has also been an invaluable aid to the discharge 
of my Official duties. The discharge of these duties has been 
rendered still more pleasant by the co-operation of the colleges
-P-A-G-E-69
eh 
and private schools. The authorities of these institutions have 
manifested sympathy with the work of the public schools, have 
taken part in teachers’ meetings, and have contributed largely 
to their value. 
It is a pleasant duty to testify to the liberality and wisdom of 
the General Assembly in its legislation in favor of education at 
its last regular session. Its educational acts not only reflect 
honor upon the individual members of the body, serving as 
evidences of their fidelity to the best interests of the people, but 
they also stand as witnesses of the growing attachment of the 
people of Tennessee to the public school system. 
The railroads of the State have extended favorable terms to 
the teachers in attendance upon Institutes and associations. 
This liberal concession to the cause of education deserves pub- 
lic acknowledgment. 
The powerful aid of the press has been given freely and cor- 
dially to the vause of education. The great daily papers whose 
‘issues travel over the entire State and beyond its boundaries, 
and county papers, whose influence is local yet powerful within’ 
their respective limits of circulation, alike deserve the thanks of 
the educators and of the children. 
It affords me sincere pleasure to acknowledge my obligations 
to my predecessors, Hon. Leon. Trousdale, Hon. Thomas H. 
Paine, and Hon. Frank M. Smith, for the aid they have given 
me in counsel, information, and encouragement. 
My official connection with the State Board of Education has 
been rendered a source of pleasure by the uniform courtesy of 
its members. My thanks are especially due to the energetic 
and genial secretary, Prof. Frank Goodman, whose unselfish 
devotion to the interests of education has gained him ae af- 
fectionate esteem of the educators of the State. 
The interest which your Excellency has always manifested in 
the cause of education needs no testimony from me. It is a 
part of the public records, and is known to all the people of the
-P-A-G-E-70
—69— 
State. I cannot close this report, however, without expressing 
to you my thanks for your uniform courtesy and kindness in 
connection with my official duties, and for your wise counsel 
and cheerful encouragement. 
I have the honor to be your obedient servant, 
W. R. GARRETT, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

CIRCULAR OF INSTRUCTION. 
NOE 
Stare or TENNESSEE, 
DspartMENt or Pusiic INstRUCTION, 
Nasuvitiz, Tenn., June 8, 1891. 
To the Honorable County Courts of the Several Counties of Ten- 
nessee, and to the School-officers of the State: 
Dear Strs—This Circular of Instruction is issued in accord- 
ance with the following provision of Chapter 132 of the Acts 
of the General Assembly for the year 1891: 
“Suc. 3. It shall be the duty of the State Superintendent to 
have printed and distributed to the school-officers of the State’ 
and to the County Courts of the several counties, appropriate 
forms and instructions for carrying into effect the’ provisions of 
this Act.” 
The public school-system of Tennessee is a mixed system. It 
partakes of the features of a State system, a county system, and 
a district system. The General Assembly, the State Superin- 
tendent, the County Court, the County Superintendent, and the 
District Directors all have their respective functions to perform. 
In order to prevent confusion and to secure a vigorous admin- 
istration of educational affairs, harmonious co-operation is nec- 
essary between the State, county, and district officers. In this 
spirit of co-operation, I shall cheerfully assume all the respon- 
sibility which properly attaches to my office, exercising promptly 
and fully all the limited powers which are conferred on me by 
law, and carefully refraining from any encroachments on the 
powers or prerogatives of the County Courts or the county 
school-officers. It is made one of my duties to offer sugges-
-P-A-G-E-119
a Gye 
tions on all general matters of school administration. In dis-. 
charge of this duty, I respectfully invite your attention to the ~ 
following suggestions: 
I. TO THE HONORABLE COUNTY COURTS. 
I. Your attention is especially called to the provisions of 
Chapter 166 of the Acts of 1891. 
This Act empowers your Honorable Courts to lay off the sev- 
eral counties into school-districts, to create new school-districts, 
and to change the lines of existing school-districts. This power 
is full and complete, and concurrent with the power of the Gen- 
eral Assembly. This power extends to all school-districts. 
There is a class of school-districts which have been heretofore 
created by special Acts of the General Assembly. ‘These are 
known as legislative districts. These districts stand on no 
higher plane than any other districts of the county, and are 
subject to your jurisdiction. You can change them whenever 
you deem that the public interest requires it. .The practice of 
establishing legislative districts has never been a wise policy. 
The County Court is, of all tribunals, the nearest to the people, 
and the’ best judge of local affairs. While the General Assem- 
bly still retains concurrent powers in the formation of school- 
districts, it is to be hoped that this power will not hereafter be 
exercised, and that the whole matter will be left in the hands of 
the County Courts. A 
II. Your attention is also respectfully called to the provisions 
of Chapter 132 of the Acts of 1891, and to the “ Suggestions” 
and “ Regulations” of the State Superintendent to the school- 
officers for carrying the same into effect, and your co-operation 
is confidently and cordially invoked. 
An examination of the law will clearly reveal its purpose. It 
was intended to make provision for permitting the higher 
branches to be taught in schools which need them without 
forcing these branches into schools which do not need them, or 
which cannot maintain them. It was also intended to improve
-P-A-G-E-120
ee 
all the schools of the State, and to render their work more uni- 
form and accurate by grading the course of study. These are 
the two leading features of the statute. 
Tt was not intended to make any revolution or even any im- 
portant change in the school-system of the State. The law re- 
quires no new school-houses to be built, creates no new boards 
of directors, provides for no separation of school-funds for dif- 
ferent classes of schools. The present simple machinery is re- 
tained, to which we are all accustomed. The law continues the 
confidence heretofore reposed in the County Courts, the County 
Superintendents, and the District Directors; leaves them, as it 
found them, with wide discretion, and even increases their 
powers. 
Tn order to accomplish the results above mentioned, the Gen- 
eral Assembly has adopted the following simple plan : 
It provides for two classes of schools, designated respectively, 
Primary Schools and Secondary Schools. (See Sec. 1, para- 
graph 1.) 
A Primary Scuoor differs in no respect from the schools as 
they are now organized, except as follows : 
1. The geology of Tennessee and the elements of agriculture 
are omitted from the course. 
2. The history of the United States is required to contain the 
Constitution of the United States. . 
3. Elocution, or the art of public speaking, is permitte1 to be 
taught, but is not required. . 
4, History of Tennessee is required to be taught. 
In order to make one of the present schools a primary school, 
the Directors need do nothing more than to pass a resolution 
designating the school as a primary school, and directing the 
teacher to follow the course of study provided by law- and the 
system of grading prescribed by the County Superintendent. 
(See Sec. 1, paragraph 2.)
-P-A-G-E-121
Boel 
A Sxrconpary Scnoou includes a primary school. It is a pri- 
mary school with three additional grades, in which the higher 
branches are taught. In order to convert one of the present 
schools into a secondary school, the Directors pass a resolution 
designating the school as a secondary school, and directing the 
teachers to follow the course of study provided by law and to 
observe the grades prescribed by the County Superintendent. 
It will readily be seen that while the State has levied no ad- 
ditional tax for the purpose of teaching higher branches, yet 
these’ branches cannot be taught properly without additional 
expense. In accordance with the recommendation of the Goy- 
ernor of the State, and recognizing the demand for the intro- 
duction of higher branches in many of the schools, but at the 
same time heeding the wise caution contained in the Governor’s 
message, “to guard against impairing the efficiency of elementary 
instruction, which is, and always must be, the foundation of every 
. good school system,” and availing themselves of the fiexible char- 
acter of our school-system, the General Assembly passed the 
Act of 1891. This Act grants the county school-officers all 
necessary powers, but leaves the exercise of these powers en- 
tirely to their discretion, and leaves to the wisdom and liberal- 
ity of the County Courts the entire responsibility and privilege 
of providing what additional ways and means may be needed 
for the establishment of secondary schools. 
It is thus necessary that cordial co-operation should exist be- 
tween the County Courts and the school officers. The direct- 
ors are dependent upon the County Courts for funds necessary 
to carry the law into successful operation. County Superin- 
tendents are requested to take the proper steps for bringing the 
directors and the members of the County Court into consulta- 
tion. I respectfully and urgently request the Honorable County 
Court to reflect carefully and maturely on the following sug- 
gestions: 
1. The law suggests, but does not require, that two or more 
teachers -be employed in every secondary school. I strongly 
_ recommend that no secondary school be ‘established with’ less 
than two teachers. I offer this recommendation upon my own
-P-A-G-E-122
ae 
personal experience as a former County Superintendent and a 
former teacher in county schools, and upon the uniform testi- 
mony of competent educators. One teacher cannot perform 
the work of teaching all the branches embraced in the course 
of the secondary schools. It is not the number of pupils which 
consumes the time of the teacher so much as the number of 
classes. The secondary school embraces nineteen branches of 
study, and is organized into eight grades. If each grade shall 
have four recitations, there will be thirty-two recitations per 
day in the school, in addition to other school exercises. This 
is a task which one teacher cannot perform. Some portion of 
the work must be neglected, and experience has shown that this 
neglect is sure to fall on the younger children—just where it 
ought not to fall. A few advanced pupils will occupy the 
- larger part of the thoughts and time of the teacher, and the 
younger children will be crowded out of an elementary educa- 
_ tion. Just so surely as the attempt is made to force one teacher 
to spread himself over the extensive course of a secondary 
school, just so surely the elementary instruction in that school 
will be ruined. I deem it my duty as a public officer to offer to 
all school authorities this solemn warning: “Jf you have a good 
primary school, do not spoil it by converting it into a poor secondary 
school.” 
I am fully in sympathy with the movement to elevate the 
standard of the public schools, Our public school-system is 
the means upon which we must rely for the education of the 
children of the State. Where it is weak we must make it 
strong. We must watch its growth, and provide the means for 
its development. I hope to see such a growth and such a de- 
velopment that every child in the State can be afforded, in his 
own district, the advantages of a thorough secondary education, 
but we must proceed by judicious steps. We must not destroy 
the foundation in:putting on the superstructure. In many 
counties, the foundation is already laid broad and deep, and it 
is time to build on it. I therefore recommend the Honorable 
County Court to consult with the County Superintendent and 
the District Directors, and to provide such means as may be 
needed to put secondary schools into successful operation, and
-P-A-G-E-123
Seg 
I recommend the District Directors to establish secondary schools 
where the public interest requires it, provided the funds at their 
command will enable them to employ two teachers in the school. 
Where the directors find that a secondary school is needed, but 
where they have not funds sufficierit to establish it, I recom- 
mend them to present a petition to the County Court, setting 
forth a statement of the case and an estimate of the cost. 
III. The attention of the Honorable County Court is also re- 
spectfully called to the provisions of the above cited Act of 
1891 in reference to the grading of schools. Former laws pro- 
vided that certain branches of study should be taught in the 
schools, but failed to lodge with the school-officers any author- 
ity for regulating the course of study. It thus happened that 
an unskillful or unscrupulous teacher could so organize his 
school that certain branches of study would be practically placed 
beyond the reach of the younger pupils; for instance, there 
would be only one class in arithmetic in the school. Pupils not 
sufficiently advanced would be compelled either to omit the 
study or to go into a class for which they were not prepared 
and from which they derived no benefit. Similarly with other 
branches of study. Besides, pupils going from one school to 
another would find a totally different plan of organization, and 
would be placed at great disadvantage. In order to cure this 
evil and to secure a uniform course of study throughout the 
county, the General Assembly wisely made provision for grad- 
ing the schools.. (See Sec. 2, paragraph 1.) 
To put this system of grading into operation, new and re- 
sponsible duties are placed on the County Superintendent. He 
must prepare the forms of grading, must have them printed 
and promulgated, and must visit the sehools to see this reform 
enforced. TI take this occasion to call the attention of the Hon- 
orable County Courts to the importance of this office. The 
County Superintendent is the head of your county system of 
education, and should be the right hand of the Court in reaching 
out over the county to execute your benevolent enactments in 
favor of the education of your children. In many counties the 
provision for his remuneration has been so inadequate, that L
-P-A-G-E-124
ee 
reget to say that some Superintendents have been tempted to 
reward poor pay with poor service. In many counties, however, 
the Superintendents have shown a spirit of noble self-sacrifice, . 
spending a large portion of their meager salaries in maintain- 
ing County Tnstitutes, in postage, printing, and other necessary 
expenditures for which the Court had made no provision. 
These are necessary public expenses, and essential to the faith- 
ful discharge of the duties of the office. I deem it my duty as 
a public officer, whose heart is in the cause of education, to say 
with profound respect, but very earnestly, to the Ionorable 
County Courts that it is not wise or just to throw these expenses 
upon the private resources of your school-officers, and I re- 
spectfully urge you to make suitable provision for the necessary 
printing, postage, correspondence, and other office expenses of 
the County Superintendents. I rely upon the kind considera- 
‘tion of the Honorable County Courts to pardon the liberty 
which my earnest interest in the elevation of our educational 
system prompts me to take in appealing to them for liberal ac- 
tion in supplying the school-ofticers with the means of improy- 
ing the schools in the following respects: 
1. In extending the length of the school-term. 
2. In paying sufficient salaries to secure the services of good 
teachers. 
3, In elevating the standard by establishing secondary schools. 
4. By providing sufficient remuneration to the County Super- 
intendent to enable him to devote his time to the important 
duties of his oftice. 
Il. .TO SCHOOL OFFICERS. 
I. CLASSIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. 
1. The classification of schools is placed, by law, entirely in 
the hands of the District Directors. They must provide for pri- 
mary education. They may provide for secondary education. 
2. In districts which contain but one school the Directors will 
comply with the law by designating the school either as primary
-P-A-G-E-125
es pO pace 
or secondary. They must designate it as one or the other. If 
they designate it asa secondary school the law is complied with, 
because the secondary school includes the primary, the first five 
grades in each being made, by law, identical. (See Section 2, 
paragraph 1.) i ; 
3. In districts which contain more than one school the Di- 
rectors may make all primary, all secondary, or some primary 
and some secondary. If only one secondary school is established 
for white children, every white child in the district of proper 
age, who can stand’ the required tests of scholarship, has the 
right to be admitted to one of the three higher grades of the 
school, because every child is entitled to equal school privileges. 
If one secondary school is established for colored children, a 
similar rule applies. 
4. If more than one secondary school for whites is estab- 
lished, the Directors may make suitable regulations for dividing 
the attendance, but every white child in the district having the 
requisite qualifications of scholarship is entitled to be admitted to 
one of the three higher grades of one of these secondary schools. 
The same rule applies if more than ‘one secondary school be 
established for colored children. 
5. In either class of schools it is the duty of the Directors to 
provide equal school privileges for all the children of the dis- 
trict. Asa general rule all the schools of the district, primary 
and secondary, white and colored, should be maintained an 
equal number of days. If one school-house should burn down 
or fall below the minimum number of pupils, or if for any 
eause the Directors should be compelled to close it, they should 
assign the children of that school to attend some other school 
of the district, or otherwise provide for them. 3 
6. I have been called on to decide several cases where Direct- 
ors have apportioned the money of the district between the 
» several schools, assigning to each school its pro rata share ac- 
cording to the ratio which the number of children assigned to 
that school bears to the total number in the district, and run- 
ning each school so long as this fixed sum meets the expend- 
itures. I do not consider this rule legal or just. I do not think 
the matter has ever been decided by the courts, but all of my 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
— 13— i ‘ 
predecessors have held, and I concur in the opinion, that all the 
children of the district are entitled to equal privileges and an 
equal number of days’ schooling. The Directors of the district 
draw school-money. This money is paid to them,on the ratio 
of scholastic population. There the analogy ends. The chil- 
dren are not entitled to draw money. They draw school-days. 
The true rule to secure to all the children equal school privil- 
eges is to maintain all the schools of the district an equal num- 
ber of days. This question becomes more important in the es- 
tablishment of secondary schools. It would be manifestly 
unjust to cut down the school-term of secondary schools on ac- 
count of their being more expensive. 
7. The attention of Directors is especially called to the pro- 
vision of Section 2 of the Act above cited. “ But they (the Di- 
reetors) shall have due regard to increasing the length of the 
school term for the benefit of the district by limiting the num- 
ber of schools, and they shall not waste the school-funds by 
unnecessary multiplication of schools.” If the Directors of a 
district should have a fund of $1,350, and should decide to main- 
tain three schools each, at a cost of $50 per month, they will evi- 
dently be able to maintain them nine months. If a strong press- 
ure should be brought to bear by dissatisfied localities, and the 
Directors should so far yield as to establish nine schools, a simple 
calculation of arithmetic will show that the children of the dis- 
trict will receive only three months’ schooling. On the other 
hand, if the three schools are so located that the children can- 
not attend them, it will be of no advantage to them for the 
district to provide nine months’ schools. There is but little 
doubt that much of the school-money has been wasted by an 
unnecessary multiplication of schools, and Directors are urged 
to weigh this matter carefully and to consider the general in- 
terests of the whole district. In many districts, by discontinu- 
ing one or two unnecessary schools, enough money may be 
saved to employ the additional teacher to establish a good sec- 
ondary school, which would be sufficient to provide for all the 
advanced pupils, and would greatly improve the educational in- 
terests of the district. 
8. Section 33, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, in reference to
-P-A-G-E-127
See 
the consolidation of public schools with academies, colleges, or 
private schools is not affected by the Act of 1891. . Directors 
still have power to consolidate either a primary or a secondary 
school with an academy, college, or private school, subject to 
the same regulations as heretofore, except that the provision 
with reference to branches to be taught free of charge applies 
to Section 31, as amended by the act of 1891. In case of such 
consolidation with a primary school, all the branches enumer- 
ated in the course of study in the primary school must be 
taught free of charge. In case of such consolidation with a 
secondary school, all branches enumerated in the course of 
study of the secondary school must be taught free of charge. 
II—GRADING. 
In view of the widely varying conditions of the different 
counties, the State Superintendent deems it best to leave the 
system of grading the schools and promoting pupils through 
the several grades to the discretion of the County Superintend- 
ents, subject to a few general regulations given below. The 
following suggestions are offered for the consideration of 
County Superintendents : 
1. Every County Superintendent is advised to consult the Di- 
rectors and teachers of the county on the plan of grading the 
schools, 
2. A grade is a division of the school-course. It is usually 
understood’ to embrace a course for one year, or what is equiv- 
alent to a course for one year. Where schools are maintained 
for short terms, it may require two years to complete one grade. 
The law provides that there shall be five grades in every pri- 
mary and eight grades in every secondary school—the first five 
grades in each being identical. A grave difficulty in preparing 
a complete system of grading is presented by the inequality of 
the school-terms. Superintendents are recommended to pre- 
pare the grading as if all the schools taught a full year’s course, 
and, if necessary, to subdivide each grade into parts, so that 
schools whose terms ‘are too short to complete a grade in one 
year can complete certain aliquot parts of the grade. It may
-P-A-G-E-128
  5 
be well, also, to indicate in each grade such portions as may 
be condensed or omitted by schools of short terms. 
8. The following general plan of grading is suggested for 
schools of full terms. It will not suit all schools, and is offered 
merely as a skeleton guide. Each County Superintendent must 
be the judge of the grading of the schools of his county :

Ill. REGULATIONS. 
The following regulations are adopted : 
_ 1. The County Superintendent shall grade the schools of his 
county in accordance with law, and shall promulgate the same 
to the school-officers and teachers of the county, and to the 
County Court, and shall report the same to the State Superin- 
tendent on or before July 1, 1891. : 
2. The grading shall embrace five grades for the primary 
schools and eight grades for the secondary schools, and shall 
be accompanied with regulations for the promotion of pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
eS oe 
through the several grades, and by suggestions for a time sched- 
ule for the daily school-work for each class of schools, respect- 
ively. ; 
3. In making the grades for the schools, the County Super- 
intendent shall provide for a course in orthography, reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, to extend through the first six grades, 
and a course in grammar, or language lessons, and geography, 
to extend through the first. five grades, and shall make proper 
provisions for teaching in the primary school course the history 
of Tennessee and the history of the United States, containing 
the Constitution of the United States, and shall also make pro- 
vision for permitting the teaching of elocution and vocal music. 
In arithmetic, the portion which relates to commercial arith- 
metic, including all the applications of “percentage,” except 
“interest,” shall be omitted from the primary school grades, and 
shall be included in the sixth grade, and taught therein in con- 
nection with book-keeping. The County Superintendent may 
also omit from the grades of the primary schools such other 
portions of arithmetic as he may think proper to transfer. to the 
sixth grade. The County Superintendent shall also, in making 
his grades, provide for the teaching in the sixth grade, in ad- 
dition to orthography, reading, writing, and arithmetic, the 
subjects of book-keeping and rhetoric, or higher English. The 
rhetoric, or higher English, may. extend through two grades. 
Algebra shall extend through the seventh and eighth grades. 
All. other provisions for grading the course are le{t to the dis- 
eretion of the County Superintendent, provided that the schools 
shall be so graded that the first five grades of the primary and 
secondary schools shall be identical, and that all the branches 
enumerated in the course of the secondary schools, but not enu- 
merated in the course of the primary schools, shall be included 
in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. 
4. The forms for the examination and license of teachers are 
changed. All other forms heretofore in use will be continued 
until further notice, and, where needed, will be corrected to 
adapt them to the recent amendments in the law. 
5. Hereafter, no decision will be rendered from this oftice on 
any question of law or school administration arising in any
-P-A-G-E-133
NOR eee 
county until after the same has been submitted to the County 
Superintendent, and an opportunity given him to express his 
opinion thereon. While the State Superintendent is ready at 
all times to give any information in his possession, and to treat 
with due respect all communications addressed to him, yet it 
would be manifestly unjust and discourteous to decide upon any 
matters arising within the jurisdiction of a competent officer 
without his knowledge and without, affording him an opportu- 
nity to investigate and pass upon the matter. Correspondents 
are, therefore, notified that all communications received at this 
office, requesting the decision of the State Superintendent on 
county matters or questions of school-law, will be promptly an- 
swered, provided the same be accompanied by the written opin- 
ion of the County Superintendent. When not so accompanied, 
they will at once be referred to the County Superintendent for 
his opinion. 
6. For reasons which will be readily understood, it has been 
adopted as an inflexible rule of this office to decline to sign any 
letters of general recommendation to be used in Tennessee, in 
favor of applicants for the position of teacher in the public 
schools, or in favor of text-books or school-supplies. If, how- 
ever, any school-officer desires such information on the merits 
of applicants, or such other information as may be in possession 
of this department, a private letter of inquiry will receive 
prompt attention. : 
7. County Superintendents will appoint Directors, in case of 
vacancies, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 146 of 
the Acts of 1891, and in cases of failure to elect, in accordance 
with Section 16, Chapter 25, Acts 1873. 
. 
In conclusion, I take this occasion to express to the members 
of the Honorable County Court and to the school-officers of the 
State my earnest desire to serve them officially and personally, 
and I invoke their active co-operation in the work of promot- 
ing the cause of education, the interests of which have been 
committed to our joint care ie the State of Tennessee. 
Very truly yours, 
W. R. Garrerr.

REGULATIONS. 
In accordance with the laws above cited, the following regu- 
lations are prescribed for examining and licensing teachers: 
I. Diplomas from Normal Schools.—Diplomas issued by insti- 
tutions operating under authority of the State Board of Educa- 
tion exempt the holder from examination, and are not subject 
to the limitations prescribed for certificates issued by County 
Superintendents. These institutions are the Peabody Normal 
College, at Nashville, and the Teachers’ Department of the 
University of Tennessee, at Knoxville. Holders of diplomas 
from other institutions are not exempt from examination by 
the County Superintendent. 
IL, Teachers’ Certificates—(1) In compliance with the de- 
cisions of the courts, and in conformity with the change in the 
“ school-laws made by the General Assembly at the session of 
1891, nétice is given that all certificates heretofore issued by 
County Superintendents will be void after June 30, 1891. Cer- 
_tificates expiring previous to June 30, 1891, may hi renewed to 
“that date on the old forms.
-P-A-G-E-136
Sis 93s 
(2) After June 30, 1891, certificates can be issued only on the 
blank forms herewith provided, and shall be awarded only to 
those who have attained the required standard at an examina- 
tion conducted by the County Superintendent, or under his 
authority and direction, and will expire on June 30 of the cur- 
rent school-year. | 
(3) There are two classes of certificates, designated respect- 
ively, “ Primary” and ‘‘Secondary,” and there are two grades 
of each class. 
(4) No applicant shall receive a second-grade certificate of 
either class until he shall have attained an average grade 
of 7 in an examination on all the branches included in the cer- 
tificate; nor a first-grade certificate until he shall have attained 
therein an average grade of 83. 
(5) No applicant shall receive a certificate of any grade until 
he shall have passed an examination in the theory and practice _ 
of teaching which shall satisfy the County Superintendent that 
the applicant is capable of managing a school. No grade of at- 
tainment is prescribed for the examination in asic and prac- 
tice of teaching. 
(6) No certificate shall be awarded to any person known to 
be a person of immoral character. ~ 
(7) In issuing certificates, the County Ragemnedene shall 
note on the stub the number of ‘the certificate, shall fill all the 
blanks for recording the grades, and shall preserve all stubs, 
filing the book containing them as a record in his office. 
- LIL, Renewals.—After June 380, 1891, no certificates can be 
renewed except upon the forms herein prescribed. First-grade 
certificates of the prescribed form may be renewed at the option 
of the County Superintendent. Second-grade certificates of the 
prescribed form cannot be renewed more than once. 
IV. Examinations for Certificates.—(1) Every County Super- 
intendent is required to hold one annual examination and not 
less than three other stated examinations in each year for 
the purpose of examining applicants for teachers’ certificates. 
The annual examination should be held during the last week of
-P-A-G-E-137
Lie eA nee 
° 
June, or as early as possible in July of each year. The other 
stated examinations should be held at some designated time and 
place, which should be publicly announced. County Superin- 
tendents are not required to examine applicants at any other 
time or place. Y 
(2) All examinations for teachers’ certificates shall be held by 
the County Superintendent, or by some person or committee 
appointed by him and acting under his authority. 
(8) The examination papers of each applicant shall be graded 
in each branch of study, and the grade of each shall be marked 
thereon, and also recorded in the stub of the certificate-book. 
The examination papers, together with a certified copy of the 
questions, shall be filed in the office of the County Superin- 
tendent as a matter of record. ° 
SUGGESTIONS. 
It is the purpose of the above regulations to provide for 
more accurate methods of examining teachers and awarding 
certificates, to place all applicants for certificates on an equal 
footing, and to relieve County Superintendents from much 
- local embarrassment and unnecessary labor. The State Super- 
intendent, therefore, assumes the responsibility of prescribing 
regulations which experience has shown to be necessary. 
Conditions, however, vary so greatly in different counties 
that it is not deemed wise to hamper County Superintendents 
with tuo many regulations. The following suggestions are of- 
fered for the consideration of school-officers : 
1. The renewal of second-grade certiticdtes and the employ- 
ment of second-grade teachers should be discouraged as far as 
possible. Second-grade teachers should be urged to improve 
their scholarship; and if they fail to do so, they should be 
dropped from the schools, and their places suppled with first- 
grade teachers. The school-officers are intrusted by law with 
the duty of regulating the light which shall flow into the minds 
of the children of the State. We must not falter in the dis-
-P-A-G-E-138
ae 
charge of this duty. We cannot have good schools under in- 
competent teachers. 
2. Much inconvenience is caused to County Superintendents 
and school-officers by having certifigates expiring, and demand- 
ing renewal, at all periods of the year. It not only makes un- 
necessary and sudden demands upon the time of school-ofticers, 
but also renders it difficult to adhere to any systematic plan of 
examination. It is much better to have all certificates expire 
at once with the end of the school-year. While some trouble 
and confusion will arise in making the change, everybody will 
soon become accustomed to it, and will find it more convenient. 
In order to avoid any present confusion, County Superintend- 
ents are recommended to renew all old certificates to June 30, 
1891. In cases where it is important to hold the annual exam- - 
ination before June 30, go on with the examination, but do not . 
issue the certificate until July 1,1891. If the certificate is 
needed for use before July 1, 1891, issue it until June 30, 1891, 
and renew it on July 1. It is intended that the certiticates 
herein prescribed shall be used to begin with the schools for the 
year beginning July 1, 1891. 
8. Each County Superintendent may prescribe the time and 
place of his annual and stated examinations for teachers. The 
following plan is suggested : 
(1) Hold the annual County Institute so as to close on or 
about June 30 in each year. Follow this at the same place 
with the annual teachers’ examination of two days’ duration. 
Issue certificates July 1. ; 
(2) Holdregular monthly examinations on the first Saturday 
of each month, except the month in which the annual exami- 
nation is held, at the county seat, in the court-house, or at some 
convenient and well-known place, so that these examinations 
may become matters of public notoriety. Positively refuse to 
examine teachers at any other time or place, except in cases of 
emergency, when the public interest requires it. Applicants 
will soon become accustomed to this, and will conform to it, 
and the County Superintendent will be enabled to establish a 
system of regular periodical examinations, which will save 
much time and labor, and will secure better results.
-P-A-G-E-139
ee GA 
(8) Mode of Conducting Examinations.—At the annual exam- 
ination, appoint one or more competent assistants, who are not 
applicants for certificates, and who are otherwise disinterested. 
Select, in preference, competent Directors. Devote the first 
day to the branches embraced in the course of the primary 
schools, and to theory and practice of teaching. Select a build- 
ing which contains two rooms, either adjoining or convenient 
to each other. Conduct the written portion of the examina- 
tion in one of these rooms under the supervision of one division 
of the examining committee, and the oral part in the other 
room, under the supervision of the other division of the com- 
mittee. Adopt the following schedule: 
Written EXAMINATIONS. 
FIRST DAY. 
8 to 9:30 a.m. Arithmetic (the portion embraced in the first 
five grades). 
9:30 to 10:30 a.m. Grammar (including a short composition). 
10:30 to 11:30 a.m. Geography. 
Recess from 11:30 a.m. to 1 P.M. 
1to2p.m. History of Tennessee. 
2to 3 p.m. History of United States, with Constitution. 
3 to 4 p.m. Theory and practice of teaching. 
Place the questions on the blackboard or distribute them in 
printed slips. Give out the questions in the different branches 
separately, about five questions in each. Close the examination 
in each branch at the expiration of the time allowed for it on 
the schedule, and promptly take up all papers. Let all appli- 
cants who finish their papers before the expiration of the alloted 
time hand them in to the examiners, and pass into the other 
room for oral examination. The last question in grammar 
should consist of five or six topics for composition, out of which 
each applicant shall select one topic, and write a composition of 
not less than ten lines. This composition should be used as the 
test in grading upon orthography and writing. Notify each 
applicant to state, on a separate slip, whether application is 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
py a 
made for a primary or secondary certificate, and to hand in the 
same with the first examination papers. ‘ Ss 
ORAL EXAMINATIONS. 
FIRST DAY. 
Each applicant, having finished his papers, or being unoc- 
cupied at any time during the day, may pass into the room set 
apart for oral examination. Only one applicant should be ad- 
mitted into this room at a time, and the conductors should ar- 
range forthe applicants to stand the oral examination at con- 
venient times through the day. 
Tn the oral examination, each applicant should be tested and 
graded on reading and on the theory and practice of teaching. 
The two grades on theory and practice—one given on the written 
examination, and the other on the oral—should be combined, 
and the average thereof should be the applicant’s grade on . 
theory and practice of teaching. This grade is not combined 
with the others, and does not enter into the scholarship average. 
It must be recorded on the stub. 
The examiners should also, in the oral examination, test the 
applicant on elocution, or the art of public speaking, and on 
his ability to teach vocal music, but no grades should be as- 
signed in these branches. 
The division of the examining committee who occupy the 
room for oral examination may occupy vacant time in grading 
such papers as have been handed in. 
SECOND DAY. 
The examination for the second day is entirely written. One 
division of the examiners may conduct the examination in one 
room-; and the other division, in the other room, may attend 
to averaging grades and to issuing certificates to those entitled 
to receive them. Those who are not applicants for secondary: 
certificates need not stand the examination of the second day.
-P-A-G-E-141
cage 
Applicants for secondary certificates will continue their exami- 2 \ nations as follows: 
8:00 to 8:30’A. M. Urata (continued, and, averaged with 
first day’s examination in arithmetic). 
8:30 to 9 a.m. Book-keeping. — 
9 to 10:15 a.m. Algebra. 
10:15 to 11:30 a.m. Geometry. 
11:30 to 12 a.m. Elements of agriculture. 
12 tolp.m. Recess. 
1 to 1:30 p.m. Geology of Tennessee. 
1:30 to 2:30 p.m. Natural philosophy. 
2:30 to 3:30 p. M. Physiology. 
3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Rhetoric or higher English. 
In arithmetic, book-keeping, elements of agriculture, and 
geology of Tennessee, give two or three questions each. In 
other branches give five questions each. 
An applicant may be entitled to a first-grade primary certifi- 
cate, and to a second- -grade secondary certificate. In such case, 
issue both certificates. Issue two certificates to the same person 
in no other case. 
Montuny Examinations. 
The monthly examination ‘should continue one day. “It 
should be conducted on a plan similar to the annual examina- 
tions. It must be more brief. Fewer questions can be given, 
and less time allowed. 
4. Every secondary school ineludes a primary school. In a 
district where only one school is established, it may be either 
primary or secondary. The Directors of a district are not com- 
pelled to establish secondary schools. County Superintendents 
' are advised to encourage the establishment of secondary schools 
in districts where the pupils are prepared by previous element- 
ary training, and need instruction in higher branches, and 
where the Directors are able and willing to organize the school 
‘properly by employing two or more teachers.. They are ad- 
vised to use their influence to discourage the establishment of
-P-A-G-E-142
— 29 — 
“secondary schools where such schools are not needed by the 
children, and where the Directors are unable or unwilling to 
employ two teachers. The work embraced in the course of 
study of a secondary school cannot be properly performed by 
one teacher. Just so surely as the attempt is made to force one 
teacher to perform all the work of a secondary school, just so 
surely some part of the work will be neglected, and this neglect 
will fall on the younger children. Urge the Directors not to 
spoil a good primary school by converting it into a poor sec- 
ondary school. 
_ 5. Hints. (1) An examination is as much a test of the exam- 
iner as of the examined. 
(2) Make the examination just. 
(8) Do not make it consist of catch questions. 
(4) Do not make it too easy. 
(5) Do not permit any preasure to force you to issue a cer- 
tificate to a person who is unfit to teach school. 
(6) Good common sense, natural tact, and a love of children 
should go far to outweigh minor defects of scholarship in an 
applicant, but nothing can outweigh either ignorance or lack 
of common sense in the teacher.

CIRCULAR No. 3 
State or TENNESSEE, 
DepartMent oF Pustic Instruction, 
; Nasuvitie, Tenn., June 30, 1891. 
To School-officers : 
In the establishment of corporation schools, the question is 
presented as to the division of the school-funds between the 
corporation and the remainder of the school-district from which 
the corporation school was taken. This question has been sey- 
eral times referred to me for decision. I have no judicial pow- 
ers, and cannot render a decision in the case. I give my opinion 
below : . 
1. In all cases where the Trustee has apportioned money pre- 
vious to the establishment of the corporation schools, the power 
of the Trustee has been exhausted, and he cannot make a reap- 
portionment. 
2. The corporation has a right to demand from the Directors 
of the district its share in the unexpended balance of the 
school-fund in the hands of the Trustee to the credit of the 
district at the date of the establishment of the corporation 
schools. i 
8. This balance should be ascertained by a settlement of the 
accounts of the district at said date, and all debts incurred by 
the district previous to that date should be deducted from the 
amount to its credit in the hands of the Trustee. 
4. The Directors of the district, after ascertaining this bal- 
ance, ought to issue a warrant to the Trustee in favor of the 
proper authorities of the corporation for the share of the cor- 
poration, making the division in the ratio of the scholastic pop- 
ulation ascertained by the school-census of June preceding. 
5. All school-funds which come into the hands of the Trus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
            
    shment of the corporation schools should be — 
the Trustee as to apportion the ratable share 
on, and the same should be paid direct to the 
ities of said corporation.

REGULATIONS. 
CERTIFICATES. 
A sufficient number of certificates, signed by the State Su- 
perintendent, will be deposited with each County Superintend- 
ent. These certificates will be held by the County Superin- 
tendent, as custodian, for the use of his county, and régularly 
accounted for in his report. They shall be issued to pupils of 
the county completing the course of the primary schools, in 
accordance with the above cited law, and in the following form: 
1. The teacher of each school shall, during the last week of 
his school-term, or at some proper time, hold an examination 
of all pupils of his school completing the primary school course, 
and applying for certificates. This examination shall be con- 
ducted in writing by the teacher, subject to the general regula- 
tions of the County Superintendent, and shall embrace all the 
subjects required by law to be taught in the primary schools. 
All pupils of the school who shall attain an average grade of 
75 per cent. or more in all the branches, and not less than 60 in 
any branch, shall be entitled to a certificate. 
2. The teacher shall grade the examination papers, and shall 
mark the grades on each paper and in each branch of study, _ 
and shall make out the averages. He shall promptly forward 
all examination papers to the County Superintendent, together 
with a list showing the names, in full, and the grade of each 
applicant. 
3. The County Superintendent may review the examination 
papers, and shall do so in cases of controversy, and shall file 
them as records in his office. He shall then enter in his record-

ers and Directors, shall deliver the certificates to the pupils en- 
titled to them. f 
DIPLOMAS. 
The regulations above given for issuing certificates are pre- 
scribed for issuing diplomas, except that diplomas shall be 
awarded only to those?pupils who complete the course of study 
in the secondary schools, The examination for diplomas will 
be held only in secondary schools, or in consolidated schools 
which teach the secondary branches. 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 
The diplomas and certificates’ are expensive. They are 
printed by order of the General Assembly, and their cost is paid 
out of the school-fund. They have been made handsome and 
attractive, so that pupils who receive them from the State of 
Tennessee may preserve and cherish them with pride. 
They should be issued only to those who deserve them, and 
not given out as a matter of course to all applicants. The 
Superintendents are made the custodians of these marks of 
merit which the State awards to the pupils of her schools, and 
itis our duty to see that they are bestowed only upon those 
who, in receiving honor themselves, will reflect honor upon the 
State. 
It is recommended that certificates and diplomas should be 
~ awarded in public, and with appropriate ceremonies. The day 
set for awarding them should be made the occasion for the 
gathering of the Directorsgand patronsand friends of the school: 
The County Superintendent should be presentvif possible.. The ~ 
pupils should learn a lesson of patriotism, and should feel that 
the State of Tennessee, in her halls of legislation, does not for- 
get her children.

State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Hon. W.R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—Inclosed. please find statistical report of the Chat- 
tanooga city schools for the year ending June 30, 1891. 
Our system of schools is divided into primary, grammar and | 
-high-school departments. Forty-one graduated from the high 
school department at the close of the scholastic year, in May. 
The schools are popular, and a manual training school-has 
been projected and will be in operation during the school year 
of 1891-92. The new building also for the high school and 
_ Second District will be occupied, and we expect an increase of 
attendance over any former year.

- Dear Sir—In compliance with your request, we take pleas- 
ure in submitting the following aggregated statistical and finan- 
cial report of the graded schools of this place. Weare, as yet,
-P-A-G-E-167
—12— 
but in our infancy, our organization dating but four years back, 
and still our friends seem to he highly gratified with the prog- 
ress that has been made in so short a time, and are ever ready, 
by their hearty co-operation and liberal indorsement, to second 
our every exertion in placing our schools among the best in the 
State. The seriously adverse public opinion in the very begin- 
ning of the system, we are pleased to state, has been almost en- 
tirely eradicated, and harmony, good-will, aud a thorough ap- 
preciation has been substituted. 
We have two new modern brick buildings, fully equipped 
with the best school-furniture, well heated, and easily venti- 
lated; splendidly located, and, I might say, for convenience, 
comfort, and beauty, will favorably compare with those of any 
other town of similar’size in the State. Our teachers, in both 
the white and colored schools, are alive to the profession, and 
are doing faithful, energetic, and progressive work. We have 
adopted, as’we think, the best text-books on the market, and 
with close attention to good authority on school-management, 
we are striving to place our schools in the front. I am author- 
ized in stating that the graded system with us is an accom- 
plished fact. 
Too much cannot be said in hovor of the splendid Board of 
Education under whom we have been called to work. Indi- 
vidually and collectively, they are broad, liberal, and attentive, 
and are ever ready to respond to all reasonable demands of the 
people and necessities of the school. Through their progress- 
ive liberality, our eight grades, in its curriculum, assumes the 
proportions of a high school, and pupils who carry off from 
Main Street school a certificate of graduation are well prepared, 
we think, for the usual avocations of life. 
The report furnished you is taken from our last annual re- 
port, and both the enrollment and average attendance is not so 
Jarge, and will. be much short of our next, for we are having a 
steady and solid growth all the while. 
The graduating class for this year is much larger than here- 
tofore, although so many high school studies have been added,
-P-A-G-E-168
. — 13 — 
. 
which clearly shows a marked improvement all along the line: 
Diplomas are issued with special care, as no pupil can receive a 
certificate until the full course has been. completed and four 
thorough examinations for each year have been passed creditably. 
Tn conclusion, would say that each year of experience in the 
work more thoroughly impresses us with the splendid ad- 
vantages to be derived from the graded system; that it is not 
only the cheapest for the people, but, under its influences and 
teachings, a higher order of intellectual attainments and a bet- 
ter state of civilization can be more easily secured. It has 
already taken a strong hold upon the Southern people, and is 
manifesting its presence in the richest and choicest blessings, — 
and we think that it needs no prophetic inspiration to foretell 
for it throughout our entire country a grand and glorious 
success.

Dear Str—Inclosed find report of our schools. I substitute 
part of the report of our treasurer (Disbursements and Lia- 
bilities) in place of part of ee blank, as the headings are 
different. 
Our schools are in excellent condition. Our greatest need 
now is a new school-building, which we hope to have before 
the beginning of another year. All our buildings are full:

Hon. W. R. Garrert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, ~ 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith transmit the annual report of the 
school of Pulaski. The city school continues large and prosper- 
ous, as you will see. There is little or no opposition to it now. 
In our municipal elections heretofore, we have always had an 
anti free school ticket. At the last election we had no anti
-P-A-G-E-181
AGT 
ticket, and the question of “anti or what not” was not raised. 
I think this speaks volumes for the growing popularity of the ° 
school. Our numbers are increased almost daily. Enrollment 
for present session is now 898. How is this for Pulaski?

Dear Sir—I inclose report as full as I can make it. I have 
only to say that the report of the committee of my Board of 
“Directors for last year shows a gain in attendance—average 
daily—of over 53 per cent. during the past four years in white 
schools; that the corps of teachers has been increased from six 
to ten, and that while we have all necessary text-books, and those 
the best, their cost has been reduced over fifty per cent.

Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I send you herewith my report of the schools of 
Anderson County for the year ending June 30,1891. It is as 
accurate as circumstances will permit. In reviewing the work 
of the past year, I am glad that I can see certain and sure evi- 
dences of progress in the right direction. The enrollment was 
larger than ever before. The average attendance was much 
larger. ‘The progress of the pupils was more rapid. The 
school-term was longer. There was more interest manifested 
by pupil, teacher, and patron than ever before. We are going 
forward. Yes; but not as rapidly as we might. We have good 
teachers, but they would be better if the Directors would de- 
mand better teaching. We have some good houses, but we 
could have all good houses, if the Directors would build them. 
We could have better supervision, of the County Court would 
pay for it. We could have a longer term, if the County Court 
would make sufficient appropriation. 
Besides evidences of progress enumerated above, I wish to 
mention the facts that most of our teachers read school journals, 
and that we have resolved to establish a teachers’ circulating . 
library. Respectfully submitted, 
KE. L. Fosrer, 
Superintendent.

Dear Str—I have forwarded my annual statistical report of 
the public schools of Bedford County for the scholastie year 
ending June 30, 1891. 
Inclosed herewith find a report of institutions of learning 
other than public schools. Besides the schools included in the © 
two reports here referred to, about forty subscription schools 
were taught during the long vacation of the public schools. 
These subscription schools employed about fifty teachers, en- 
rolled about 1,700 or 1,800 pupils, and continued in session, 
most of them, five months. 
The school-work of the county is in excellent condition in 
every respect, and has been fully explained in previous written 
reports, to which you are respectfully referred. 
Very respectfully, 
J. H. ALLEN, 
Superintendent.

Hon. W. R. Garrert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Duar Sir—I take pleasure in submitting to you my seventh 
annual report of the schools of Bradley County, and to report 
a continued improvement along the line. We held our annual’ 
Normal for white teachers at Chatata in July; all the teachers 
of the county in attendance but five. Several teachers from 
other counties, among the number Prof. W. Calkins, of Chat- 
tanooga; Prof. T. L. Bryan, editor of the Headlight; Prof. 
  Mee
-P-A-G-E-190
pes 2 1 tes 
Kelso, of Monroe County, and ex-State Supt. Frank M. Smith. 
Of all the Normals held, this was pronounced the best we have 
ever had in the county. The colored Normal was held at Cleve- 
land, all the teachers attending; each continued one week. 
Our Directors’ meeting was held last June, at which time I 
advised Directors to seat the houses with good comfortable 
desks. We have several new houses with poor seats. 
We hold Institutes in the county each month, and find it 
creates considerable interest among teachers and people. 
We have four secondary schools in the county. We have 
prepared a grade, but find it difficult to get teachers to adopt it. 
They say that irregularity, and a failure to procure necessary 
books in the country, and the poor system heretofore of allow- 
ing some students to pursue only one study, makes it difficult 
to grade. We can begin with the little ones now and be able 
to miake it a success in a few years, and then will have a better 
system. " 
I think the old law ought to be re-enacted, requiring at least 
the Superintendent to sign all orders on the Trustee for money, 
except the order of teachers; by this means our counties would 
save much money. For each year the Directors in some coun- 
ties are imposed upon by some school-furniture agent, with 
shoddy material, at exorbitant prices. Let us have the law 
passed, and by so doing much can be saved. 
Respectfully, 
M.R. M. Burky, 
Superintendent.

Dzar Str—I have the pleasure of submitting to you my first 
annual report for the year ending June 30,1891. I think this
-P-A-G-E-191
CURE 
report very nearly correct. I could not give the number in 
each branch, as the teachers failed to make out their abstracts. 
I have visited, graded, and addressed all the schools of my 
county. I have visited a few of the schools twice. I think 
most of the schools are in a prosperous condition. 
While the educational work of Campbell County for the past 
few years has not been crowned with that success so much de- 
sired by enthusiastic educators, yet it has moved along smoothly 
and in a progressive manner. Our school-fund is not sufficient 
to support our schools as fully as they ought to be. I hope our 
Honorable County Court will supply the deticieney by levying 
an additional tax. 
I think there is a manifestation of a growing interest in the 
public schools of our county, not only on the part of the teachers, 
but the Directors and people generally are being stirred up on 
the subject of education. Yours in school-work, 
Amon GRoss,

Hon. W. R. Garner, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Dear Sir—I herewith transmit to you my report of the publie 
schools of Cannon County. A failure on the part of some of 
the Directors to make reports at the proper time has delayed 
my report. Iregret this very much. 
Iam glad to say that the progress of schools in this county, 
as compared with last year, is much better. Much interest has 
been manifested in our schools by our people, but the fund of 
this county is too small to run schools beyond three months in 
the year.

The present system of free schools is more satisfactory to the 
friends of free education than any system we have ever had. 
Our annual Institute was well attended by the teachers of the 
county, and much good done. ' Respectfully, °

think is accurate. If not, I cannot help it, for I have done my 
best. I have labored hard in order to give you a good report. 
1am glad, indeed, to see our population and attendance better 
than last year. I think the people are becoming more inter- ° 
ested every day. I am doing my best for the young and rising 
generation, and I expect to continue. We are holding our 
meetings monthly, known as Carroll County Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, besides our annual Institute, and I find much benefit de- 
rived from it. I will close by wishing you and the cause of ed- 
ucation success. Yours truly,

stances over which I had no control. (I have only been Super- 
intendent since March 30, 1891.) 
We need an additional school-tax in this county, as the 
school-term is too short to have a very beneficial effect upon 
schools. If we desire a more useful class of citizens, we must 
make them more intelligent by-education.. In order to do this, 
we need a tax sufficient for six months’ school each year. 
Iam making an effort to elevate the standard of teachers, 
also the ideas of the school-officials and citizens of our county. 
Out of fifty-one schools I have succeeded in getting six ab- 
stracts. I hope to be able for a fuller and more worthy report 
by the close of the next school-year.

Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public. Instruction,

Dear Srr—Inclosed herewith please find my first annual re- 
port for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. Our schools 
are in a prosperous condition compared with what they were 
three or four years ago. We have had better attendance than 
ever before. Our teachers are doing more and better work, and 
much credit is due my honored predecessor, Prof. White, in se- 
curing better teachers. We have good Institutes, attended by 
nearly all our teachers. We have more school-districts than 
are necessary, caused by so many large streams flowing through 
the county. I have tried to carry out your instructions in every 
respect. We have two good colleges at Henderson, which are 
doing much good in furnishing teachers for the public schools. 
T visited nearly all the schools in this county, gathering statis-

Dear Srr—I am sorry that I am not able.to give you a full 
report, but, with all papers received, this is the best I can do. | 
Last year there was no report at all from this county. 
Our Normal Institute, which was the first in the county for 
years, was held the second week in July. It was rather poorly 
attended, but did a good work. 
There has been considerable progress in our schools, but there 
certainly is room for improvement yet. Some of our best 
teachers have retired, owing to poor inducement in the way of 
salaries. : 
With best wishes for the cause of education, I am, 
Very respectfully,

Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Dear Str—After much trouble and vexation, on account of 
some of the Directors of this county failing to make their re- 
: Gis) P.1.—Ap. C.
-P-A-G-E-195
gee 
port to me at the proper time, I herewith submit to you my ~ 
annual report for the year ending June 30,1891. 
While our schools have not attained that degree of perfection 
which they might have done, yet they have reached a condition 
of improvement far exceeding that of former years, and are 
now starting, unshackled, to a new era of success. 
However, we have some people in this county who are not 
enthused upon the subject of education, and who, in a great 
’ measure, fail to discharge the duty which they owe their chil- 
dren; yet I hope the time will come when the scales will fall 
from their eyes and they will be able to see themselves as others 
see them. When this oceurs, the children of this county will 
receive the full benefit of its public schools. 
There are in this county thirty-one hundred children between 
the ages of six and twenty-one years—as bright-eyed boys and 
girls as ever inhabited any county—and out of this number 
only two thousand and forty-six have been enrolled in the 
public schools of the county, leaving nine hundred and fifty- 
‘four who have, unfortunately, been kept out of our public 
schools this year; and of the two thousand and forty-six en- 
rolled we have a daily attendance of only sixteen hundred and 
twenty-eight. These are facts; the picture is appalling, and 
should be sufficient to arouse all careless parents to an honest 
discharge of parental duty. Our free school system will never 
be productive of that amount of good intended by its framers 
until the people become fully alive to the importance of send- 
ing their children regularly to these gratuitous institutions of 
learning, which have been erected and maintained by a charit- 
able and patriotic people. 
We have forty-six schools in this county, and while I have 
spoken of the disadvantages under which our schools have 
labored, I would not be understood to mean that the public 
schools in this county have been a failure during the past year,’ 
for, as heretofore said, they are annually improving, and I 
believe that the public school officers of the county can, by a 
proper discharge of their duties, work an improvement in the 
future which will far exceed that of the past.
-P-A-G-E-196

I have visited every school in the county, and spent two 
hours in each school, in which I have expressed myself boldly 
and freely upon the subject of non-attendance, taking the posi- 
tion that no man has a moral right to raise his child in igno- 
rance and force it into society wholly unprepared for the great 
conflicts of life, and that he would be responsible to his country 
and his God if he failed to properly educate the child committed - 
to his care. ; 
We have held four Institutes this year, which were reasonably 
well attended, and the teachers of the county came to the front 
and gallantly performed their duty, for which they have my 
thanks and hearty co-operation as long as I am permitted to be 
their humble officer. { 
’ In conclusion, I would say I have Jabored honestly and con- 
scientiously to elevate the standard of education in this county. 
How well or how much I have succeeded I cannot now tell, but 
sincerely hope that the fruits of my labors, if not gathered im 
_ this year, will be gathered in years to come.

Dear Srr—I have the honor to transmit to you my annual 
report of the public schools of my county for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1891. My report is near correct. In 
some cases, where Directors have failed to report, I have had to 
approximate, but such cases are few indeed. 
I can say with great pride and pleasure that the educational 
work in Cocke County is on a boom. Our teachers are taking
-P-A-G-E-197
  ies . 
a greater interest than any year before, and they deserve much 
credit for the interest and energy they have displayed in their 
school-work. A goodly number of the young men and women 
of the county, realizing the importance of good schools, have 
gone to work, with an earnestness never before manifested in 
our county, to qualify themselves properly for school-work; and 
in ashort time, a few years at most, we will have as good 
schools as any other county in the State. 
I find that our Teachers’ Institutes have aroused public senti- 
ment on the subject of popular education. We have about six 
of these meetings every year. I have visited all the schools in 
the county, and some of them twice. I found nearly all doing 
exceedingly well. The Directors are taking more interest than 
heretofore. I have done all in my power to advance the cause 
of education in my county, and I feel that my labors have not 
been in vain, but my efforts have been crowned with reasonable 
success. In every department of our school-work we are 
pleased to note a sure and steady progress. The future pros- 
pects are bright for the children of Cocke County. We 
are having longer school-terms this year than heretoforein all 
the school-districts of the county. 
Our colored schools are progressing very well, too. We have 
some very gooil teachers among the colored population of our 
county. They are creating quite an enthusiasm for education 
among their own race. We are very proud to make this report. 
Respectfully, 4

If there is any thing left out that I can fill, I will take great 
pleasure in doing it. 
~ My predecessor failed to leave me any record of his work, so 
I could not embody that. Neither did the Directors and teach- 
ers furnish a record of grading, as should be handed me on the 
abstracts. That is the reason these are not filled out in my 
report. 
Iam most thankful to you for granting me so much time. 
Next year I will do. my best to get in my report by October 1.

Duar Str—I herewith hand you my third annual report of 
the schools of our county. This report has been delayed on 
account of the failure of the District Directors to make their 
reports on time. : 
TI can trathfully report that our public schools are being bet- - 
‘ter taught, better disciplined, and are productive of more real 
_ benefit to the children of the county than they were a few years 
ago. This is the natural outgrowth of teachers’ meetings and 
the circulation and reading of school-literature. Some of our 
teachers are well up in a knowledge of the text-books, and are 
studying and discussing the best methods of teaching the entire 
public school curriculum. We have a regular monthly meeting 
of teachers. At most of these meetings we have very interest- 
ing and profitable exercises.
-P-A-G-E-199
ic 7 al 
As yet, very little progress has been made in grading the 
schools of our county. A few of our teachers, however, have 
undertaken to grade their schools, and have succeeded reason- 
ably well. We expect to continue to push this work until all 
our country teachers properly classify and grade their schools. 
We have for several years had an adopted series of text-books, 
covering the curriculum as it was previous to the amendment 
providing for the establishment of secondary schools. We have 
been troubled very little about changes in text-books. Our 
Directors have not classified their schools either as primary or 
secondary, but in some few schools they permit the secondary 
branches taught. We expect at an early day to call a meeting 
of the Directors for the purpose of classifying the schools as 
primary and secondary, and to provide for the adoption of text- 
books for the secondary schools. 
The school-districts in our county are no longer identical with 
the civil districts. Of the former, we have forty-eight; of the 
latter, only fifteen. This increase of school-districts necessi- 
tated the appointment of a great many Directors. Whether so 
many districts are best for our schools, time and experience will 
prove. 
‘We have several very good private schools. Prof. M. Rose, 
' with two good lady assistants, is teaching a most excellent 
school at Bell’s Depot. This school is now in its fifth year, and 
is doing a noble work for the children of that town and com- 
munity.. Gadsden has a good school, with Prof. Barton as 
principal, assisted by two competent teachers. The people of 
_Alamo and vicinity think they have the best school in the 
county. Of this school Perey McDonald is principal, assisted’ 
by R. E. McCain and Miss Mamie Henderson. The Maury 
City school is succeeding very well under the management of 
Prof. Cooksey, formerly of Bedford County. If you were to 
eall at the Johnson’s Grove school, of course you would find 
Miss Mollie Worrell in charge ‘of ‘the same school where she 
has been at work for two years. These are all good'schools, in 
which first-class teaching is done all along the line, from the 
primary to the best collegiate course.

We need more money for our public schools, and a law regu- 
lating the attendance of teachers at Institutes. The law ought 
to compel them to attend and do their part of the work or for- 
feit their place in the schools. 
Permit me to suggest that we would like to have the ques- 
tions for examination of teachers for certificates prepared by 
the State Superintendent or by the State Board of Education, 
and furnished in printed form to the County Superintendents, 
together with legal times for holding examinations. This 
would secure uniform work by the County Superintendent, and 
regularity and promptness on the part of teachers. Would it 
not be well for the proper committee, at coming convention, to 
look after these matters ? 
Hoping that our schools may make rapid progress under 
your wise dispensation as Superintendent, I am

Dear Srr—This, my first annual report, is respectfully sub- 
mitted, sincerely regretting its incompleteness and delay. The 
many obstacles in the way of obtaining the needed information 
were impossible for me to overcome. 
T held a summer institute, beginning June 30, continuing one 
week, with Prof. W. N. Billingsley as conductor. Sixty-five 
teachers were in attendance; also, three District Institutes, 
which were well attended by the teachers and school patrons of 
the vicinity. Every school in the county has been visited this

year. Two conventions of school-directors were called and con- 
ducted with interest. We are encouraged to hope that another 
year will find our school-work in such shape that uo delay or 
incompleteness shall be reported. Respectfully

Dear Str—I herewith transmit you my statistical report for 
the year ending June 30, 1891. I hope my being behind two 
days will put you to no inconvenience. It is quite an under- 
. taking to collect materials for one of these reports. At best, the 
statistics are only approximately true. 
The schools of this county are in good condition. We have 
more money than ever before, but not enough yet, Give us an 
abundance of money, and we can have as fine schools as can be 
found in the world. Backed by plenty of money, auy system 
of education will work well. Davidson County has reason to 
_ be proud of her schools.

Dear Smr—I herewith send you my annual report for the 
scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. It has been my pleasure
-P-A-G-E-202
pase yy. by Ages. 
to visit nearly all the schools of Decatur County this summer. 
While we have some excellent school-houses and some noble 
teachers in our county, I ami constrained to confess that in- 
competent teachers and rude and ill-supplied school-rooms are 
great barriers in our educational progress. A great many of 
our teachers are young men, with but little experience as 
teachers, though some of them manage their schools extremely 
well, and I predict for them a bright future. My motto is, 
“Better school-houses, better teachers, and longer schools.” 
One bright prospect for progress is that most. of our teachers 
expeet to attend school some this year. Our Directors have 
purchased more school-apparatus than usual. About one-half 
of our schools are supplied with maps and charts. 
I called a convention of all the Directors in the county to 
meet on the eighteenth of last July. Quite a number of Di- 
rectors met, and after some interesting discussions it was agreed 
that the convention meet annually. At this meeting a com- 
mittee was appointed to examine and select text-books for our 
secondary schools. 
Another interesting feature of our work was a public exhi- 
bition of the school-work of our county. The teachers did 
not take as much interest in this as they might. About one- 
eighth of the schools presented specimens of their work, among 
which were papers that were a credit to any boy or girl. 
I think we will have but few secondary schools for some time. 
We hope to have all our schools worked into the graded system 
in the near future. Respectfully, 
B. A. Tucker, 
Superintendent.

Dear Srr—I beg to here submit to you my first report, for 
the year ending June 30, 1891. 
Tam sorry to say to you that our schools are not what they 
should be. This report is covering the former Superintendent’s 
work, in part. Many items that this report calls for can’t be 
given, as there is not even a line to show what was done in this 
oftice for the year 1890, therefore, all this report I collected by 
a vast amount of labor to myself. If there is any thing 
left out that must be given, I will take pleasure in collect- 
ing it for you. I promise you hereafter to be able and ready to 
furnish you with any information desired, as I’m becoming fully 
acquainted with the work of my county, and promise you a 
success in my schools, if duty performed will bring it. 
You will find the papers of the examination held by me at 
Smithville, Tenn., for DeKalb, August 1,1891. 
In obedience I remain yours,

Duar Str—Inclosed you will please find my first annual re- 
port for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. In submit-, 
ting it l wish to say that we have made some progress. Our 
schools are not perfect by any means, nor do we, as teachers, 
feel that we have reached the acme of our profession. Our 
heart is in the work, and each day’s experience convinces us 
that there is still more to be learned. Active measures have
-P-A-G-E-204
a AQ oes 
been taken and means will be provided (I hope at an early date) 
for the grading of every school in the county. 
Teachers’ Institutes have been very well attended, and books 
on theory and practice of teaching can be found in the hands 
of most of my teachers. We have more and better school- 
apparatus than ever before, substantial and commodious build- 
ings going up, and something near uniformity, though not © 
a complete adoption, of texts. Directors respond very readily 
to the calls of public meetings. 
For further particulars my report will speak. In conclusion, 
we wish to thank you for services already rendered, and promise 
you to so labor another year that not one, but all, may say, 
“She hath done what she could.”

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—Inclosed you will find my first annual report of the 
public schools of Fayette County for the year ending June 30, 
1891. This report isnot so neat, complete, or accurate as it should 
be, for having been appointed to this office only last January, and 
my predecessor not turning over to me any papers from which 
I could gain any information as to his official work, and as the 
clerks of our school-districts are extremely careless in the dis- 
charge of their duties, made so, perhaps, by the indifference of 
past Superintendents, who have not made such demands of 
them as the law requires. I am sorry to state, and yet itis 
true, that little or no interest has been taken in the welfare of 
our public schools by either the officers or citizens of the county. 
I know that this indifference could be removed, and go ex-
-P-A-G-E-205
  Eg 
pressed myself, and having said so, I tried to exemplify the . 
declaration in-its fullest meaning by throwing all my energy 
and enthusiasm into the work. Great earnestness is, I think, 
the most necessary qualification for a successful Superintendent, 
for if he goes at his work with apathy or reluctance, the Di- 
rectors, teachers, and pupils will go at their work in the same 
way. A languid and creeping Superintendent will never have 
lively and progressive schools. He must warm and vivify the 
people with his own zeal and energy. If the Superintendent 
places a low estimate on his duties, it may be expected that all 
will do likewise. His success will be measured by the value he 
attaches to his duties, and the amount of energy, enthusiasm, 
and learning he brings into his work. I think that my labors 
have to some extent, been crowned with success, for I find that 
those who opposed a free school system, now strongly favor 
the same. We have also reduced the number of schools in this 
county to nearly one-half. Instead of 124, we will, from this 
time, have about seventy. We have also established about seven 
secondary schools, which will continue free to all-the children 
of the district ten months. - All our schools will hereafter aver- 
age five, instead of three, months. Our County Court will raise 
the tax for school-purposes at its next January term, as the 
people now seem to be in earnest, and realize that the day of 
private schools is a thing of the past, and know the importance 
of fostering our free school system as the principal bulwark of 
our republican liberties. 
Believing that the rapid increase of popular intelligence is 
calling for a more varied and critical culture on the part of 
teachers, and that they should make themselves equal to the de- 
mands of the hour. I therefore gave them a rigid, thorough, 
fair, and impartial examination, and could grant only twenty- 
one first-grade certificates out of 149 examined. We have too 
many who are teaching merely as a temporary expedient, and 
not as a permanent Occupation. We want men and women 
who have consecrated their lives to this noblest of all profes- 
sions to take charge of our public schools. If Superintendents 
would all be strict in their examinations, we doubt not that it 
would soon create a healthy revolution in our public schools,

establishment and support of more normal methods for the 
preparation of teachers. Yours truly,

Fentress County. 
Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashvilie, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Inclosed you will find my first annual report, for 
the scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. . I do not claim that 
‘this report is correct, as the Directors have been very slow in’ 
making their reports; however, I promise you a correct report 
next year. 
Tam prond to say that the cause of education is gradually 
advancing in the County of Fentress. During June I employed 
Prof. A. H. Roberts, of Alpine Institute, to conduct a county 
normal, at Jamestown, which proved a decided success. Forty- 
four teachers were in attendance. Ihave also succeeded in or- 
ganizing a monthly Teachers’ Institute, which bids fair to do 
good work for the teachers of the county. I have, by diligent 
work, iriduced the Directors to adopt a uniform series of text- 
books, to go into effect the first of July, 1892. There will be, 
beyond a doubt, a Masonic institute erected at Allardt, in this 
county, which will greatly uplift the cause of education in 
Fentress County. 
Allow me to say in this, my first report, that there is no 
cause for discouragement in the progress of our county; and, 
while our schools are very far from being what I and every true 
lover of education desires, still there is much improvement i in 
every department of our work for the last year.
-P-A-G-E-207
ayo 
I have used every effort possible to upbuild the schools of 
Fentress County since I was honored with the office of County 
Superintendent, and I do not claim a complete success. I feel 
that the schools will do better work than ever before.

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dzar Srr—l herewith submit my annual report of the public 
schools of Franklin County for the scholastic year ending June 
80,1891. I think it is as nearly correct as it is possible to 
make it from the reports and statistics I have been able to 
gather. I have labored very hard to get our Directors and 
teachers to make out their reports at the proper time, but have 
not fully succeeded in getting all to do this yet. Iam glad to 
say, however, that I think there is considerable improvement in 
_our schools. Owing to physical disability, 1 have not done the 
official work that I would have done. 
In conclusion, I will say we need longer school-terms, and 
the county superintendent paid a salary that will justify him in 
devoting his entire time to the business.

Hon. W. R. Garret, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—Find within my report for the school-year begin- 
ning June 30,1890 and ending June 30,1891. I regret very 
much to submit a report so incomplete, but, as Directors are so 
negligent about making their reports, I cannot do better. 
I was elected Superintendent at the January term of court, 
1891. From some cause or other, the opinion crept into this 
county that a Superintendent was not needed, hence school-offi- 
cials grew careless about discharging their duties, and schools 
have not advanced as rapidly as they should. The interest is 
increasing, and prospects for better schools are more favorable. 
As the trustee could not make an accurate report of the re- 
ceipts and expenditures of the school-funds, that part of the re- 
port is left blank. If possible, I will get the receipts and ex- 
penditures and send them to you, if it will not be too late. The 
Superintendent who preceded me received $500 a year; my 
salary is $300, and, in addition, Iam allowed to charge $1 for 
each teacher examined. Will spare no efforts to make my next 
report what it ought to be. Respectfully submitted,

Dear Srr—I herewith submit my second annual report for 
the Giles County schools. It affords me most intense gratifi- 
cation to be able to truthfully say that our schools are gradually 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
Sa Ne 
improving. The law in regard to the grading of schools has. 
been complied with. Examinations have been more rigid than 
heretofore, and consequently a better class of teachers are now 
in charge of our schools. 
T held a Teachers’ Institute in June for one week, and it was 
an unusually successful one. I feel very much encouraged by 
the interest manifested by all the teachers and patrons. While 
our schools might be improved upon, I am fully convinced they 
are up to or above the average, and I am proud to state they 
are steadily improving in every way. 
We have a uniform system of text-books, which is itself a 
great advantage, and where our greatest difficulty lies is in the 
fact that our tax levy is insufficient for a proper support of the 
schools for a sufficient length of time. We hope to overcome 
this soon, however. Very respectfully, 
Merritr Esuick, JR., 
Superintendent. 
GRAINGER County 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Six—In submitting my first annual report, 1am glad 
to inform you that Grainger County school-officers and patrons 
are awakening, and a brighter day is dawning. We have had 
many difficulties to meet and overcome before we could advance 
as we should, but many of these have given way, and we are 
coming to the front with accelerated movement. A diversity 
of text-books existed in every school almost in the county, and 
my first official work was to call a meeting of the Directors and 
take steps necessary to enforce uniformity of text-books in 
all the schools, a work that must be done in order that the 
school-fund and the time of the pupils will not be wasted. A. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
DEES a 
circular, showing the work of the meeting, was sent to school- 
officers and patrons throughout the county. Directors and 
patrons, with few exceptions, went to work, and we have elimi- 
nated hundreds of the old books from the schools, supplying 
them with the adopted series, thus enabling us to grade the 
schools in obedience to law. 
This reform required much intense work, which met with 
some opposition, honest opposition, for want of investigation ; 
*but we will fight on until the argus-eyed monster of text-book 
diversity ceases to impede our schools in the march of progress. 
Twenty-one schools have been graded, and many others ready 
for grading to present ‘report. Grainger never had a graded 
school until this year. We adopted the “Southern Teachers’ 
Report to Parents” for use in our graded schools, and at the 
end of each month the patrons affix their signature with new 
inspiration. 
In my Normal programme, I announced that certificates 
would not be issued to non-attendants, and that wide-awake and 
thoroughly competent teachers were wanted. The incompetent 
applicants failed to get certificates—some who had been teach- 
ing for years. I did this to protect the patrons and to stimulate 
the teachers to better qualify themselves. As a result, our Nor- 
mal was largely attended, and conceded to be one of the best 
ever held in the county. We were assisted by such eminent 
educators as M. B. Astor, of Greene, and 8. J. Ledgerwood, of 
Union. We will ever hold them in grateful remembrance. 
I have visited every school in the county, some twice. Will 
visit most all twice during the year. Addressing the school on 
every visit seemed to inspire the teacher and students, and the 
patrons, who came out frequently, with new zeal. I find modern 
methods of instruction: 
Lhave visited every Director, with few exceptions. I have 
exerted myself to impress them with the responsibility of their 
positions, and the importance of discharging their duties as de- 
fined by law. It gratifies me to note the improvement the

Directors have made by giving more personal attention to the 
schools than formerly. Indeed, they are the important factors 
to promote the interest in public schools. 
Our teachers are attending our county and local Institutes, 
and keeping pace with the current educational thought of the 
day. To those who so efficiently assisted me during the trying 
circumstances of grading, etc., Iam greatly indebted. 
Among other things, we have quit dismissing for “ fodder,”* 
abandoned teaching in churehes; are building good houses, 
buying globes, maps, and other necessary apparatus, paying 
good salaries, encouraging neatness, cleanliness, accuracy, and 
good manners, 
Our terms, this year, will average ninety days. Our County 
Court is getting more liberal, and manifesting a better interest. 
All of these things are marking a new era in our educational 
work. In making my report, and in general results, I am in- 
debted alike to the County Court, the Directors, teachers, and 
patrons. 
Thanking you for the interest and zeal that characterizes 
your official work, and hoping that every county in the State 
will catch an educational inspiration from her sister counties,

It is my purpose to execute your plans; however, I shall need 
your aid and assistance in this much needed work. Oheer us 
occasionally with your presence. We had an excellent Insti-

Rowan, M. A. Bales, T. S. Rankin, L. McWhirter, and others.

The lectures were pleasing and profitable. I am largely in- 
debted to Hon. A. H. Pettibone, Prof. M. H. Monroe, and Rey. 
Oscar Haywood for the success of the Institute. The young 
ladies of Greeneville deserve special mention, especially 
Misses Mattie Mitchel and Mary Trim, for the grand enter-

lawyers, two editors, and six ministers. I wish you could have

The school-fund is gradually increasing, giving us longer 
terms, better buildings and equipments, and a higher grade of 
teachers. i 
Grundy County greets you this year with the most efficient 
corps of teachers of which it has ever been her lot to boast. My 
first object has been to make the examinations practical and 
thorough, and then to license only teachers who are competent. 
Tconsider no one thing a greater injury to our schools than 
that of an unqualified person being licensed to teach in the 
same. 
The patrons are more interested in the work of the schools 
than for many years. This is easily accounted for. I have 
been holding District Institute meetings monthly, assisted by 
energetic teachers, who are putting forth every effort to make 
‘the educational work a success. Hence, we are rapidly coming” 
to the front. What we need, to make our schools what they 
ought to be, are more good buildings well furnished, a better 
set of District School Directors, aint a few more first-class 
teachers. 
Tn closing this report, permit me.to say that your wise coun- 
sel, from time to time, has aided me greatly in prosecuting’ the 
work. :

my efforts to have my report correct, it is only approximately

teachers this year than for the past few years. The normal 
work was very satisfactory. Among those who delivered ad-°

ter condition than at present. 
Through your kindness the colored teachers were favored 
with a State Normal Institute, which was held in June, con-

The annual Institute for white teachers was held at the court- 
house, June 29 to July 3, inclusive, conducted by Prof. Arnold 
Tompkins, dean of DePauw University Normal School, of In- 
diana. One hundred and twenty-five teachers were present. 
Among the visitors enrolled, { take pleasure in mentioning 
Superiutendents W. E. Stephens, Rhea County; D. A. Tate, 
Marion County; J. W. Cardwell, Loudon County; J.D. Camp- 
bell, James County. The Institute, though a week shorter 
than usual, was one of the most interesting and protitable Nor- 
mals ever held in the county. Our monthly meetings, both 
white and colored, which we consider indispensable, have been 
well attended, and incalculable good has resulted therefrom. 
We have nine secondary schools, with from two to six teach- 
ers each, except one, which has only one teacher at present. 
Seventeen pupils have graduated during the year. The exam- 
inations for graduation have all been held by the Superintend- 
ent, and no one has been allowed to pass who failed to make a 
general average of at least 80, or fell below 50 in any branch. 
About a year ago the teachers voted unanimously to estab- 
lish a teachers’ circulating library, and the committee appointed 
to devise plans, ete., has named January 9, 1892, as the day 
when the library will be formally opened with paul exercises. 
Before closing this report I desire to speak of the exposition 
of school-work, held at the court-house last December. The 
plan, briefly stated, was as follows, viz.: 
Karly in July the teachers decided, unanimously, to have an 
exposition in December, and the Superintendent was appointed 
a committee of one to select suitable paper for exclusive use in 
preparing exposition work. Legal cap was selected for class- 
work, and German drawing paper for map-drawing. The Di- 
rectors, in convention in July, agreed to furnish paper to the. 
amount of one quire per pupil. which they did. 
Nearly all the schools went to work in earnest, and, on the 
19th of December, a grand display of actual class-work was to 
be seen at the court-house, which offered an excellent oppor- 
tunity for teachers to compare methods and select the best.

The following editorial from the Chattanooga Sunday Times, 
of December 21, will give an idea of the interest manifested : 
“This county, ever to the front in new enterprises, is the first 
in the State to hold a school-exhibition. Last Friday two rooms 
in the court-house presented busy scenes. Walls and tables 
displayed the work of the school-children of Hamilton County. 
Throngs of visitors came and went the entire day, testifying to 
the deep interest taken by our people in educational matters. 
The Superintendent and his able corps of teachers greeted the 
visitors and explained the exhibit. Under Superintendent 
Huffaker’s wise and careful supervision, the Hamilton County 
schools take high rank. The exhibition was a decided success, 
a movement that means greater interest in svhools by each and 
every citizen, more earnest efforts on the part of teachers, and 
better work by pupils.” 
So much pleased were the teachers with this effort, that they 
have decided to hold an exposition next year in connection with 
the annual Institute.

Duar BE Fnclooad herewith ‘ibe tind my annual report 
for the year ending June 30,1891. I cannot boast of its cor- 
rectness or promptness, because it has been quite an endeavor 
upon my part to secure the information contained therein, but 
it pleases my mind to say that the progress has been gleaned 
in this county which has been prayed for so long. 
The length of the public school term is now all that the 
people in general can congratulate themselves for, and upon
-P-A-G-E-217
eo 
the slope or summit of some hill, or on the pleasant plain or in 
the cool valley of every neighborhood is seen the mighty stamp 
of hope—new school-houses, blackboards, maps, charts, and 
globes. 
T have taken special care to visit the schools in every neigh- 
porhood, both white and colored, and have found as busy corps 
of teachers as I care to find. Although my time was much 
limited, I have done what work I could while with them. 
There are more first-grade teachers in the county than ever 
previous to this year. This result owes its origin to the found- 
ing of another permanent college in the State, in this county, 
_ two years ago. 
You are aware that the result of my summer labor is not 
contained in this report, but you aré further informed that the 
hope of our schools is not shut up in the narrow walls of the 
log cabin or the mind of the puny teacher. It is in the home 
by the wayside, and I poast that the teachers of this county 
have gone in a solid phalanx into every neighborhood of the 
county and instilled into hundreds and thoussadl of hearts, 
through the Institute work, ideas they had never gleaned before. 
In conclusion, I must say that the public school system has 
done for many a noble-hearted lady and gentleman what they 
could not do for themselves, and will make many others tramp 
the rostrum of a university or a Peabody and sing sweet deliv- 
erance in an early dawn of “our public sclrool system.”

Denar Str—It is a source of pleasure, in submitting my third 
annual report, to be able to show éonsiderable progress during 
the year. 
With a few exceptions, our schools have been well managed, 
and taught after approved methods. Our teachers, as a class, 
are conscientious men and women, who are striving to improve. 
As an evidence of this, the majority are taking educational 
journals, and endeavoring to grade their schools. 
The State Teachers’ Institute you were so kind to grant us, 
was a success in attendance and results. We were very sorry 
indeed that you could not be with us. Our teachers were well 
pleased with the conductors, Hon. T. H. Paine and Prof. P. H. 
Manning. Their earnest labors will long be appreciated by the 
teachers of Hardin County. At the close of the Institute I held 
my annual examination, and issued sixty-three certificates. 
The Colored Normal Institute was well attended. The col- 
ored teachers, with some exceptions, are doing excellent work, 
_ We have a few teachers who are creating some enthusiasm for 
education with their race. : 
At the Directors’ annual meeting a uniform system of text- 
books was adopted for primary and secondary schools. 
Since the date of my last report,.three new school-houses 
have been built, and several districts have furnished their houses 
with better apparatus. 
T have visited uearly all the schools, but sickness prevented 
my visit to some before the terms closed. The pupils and 
teachers manifested pleasure in my visits and talks to the 
schools. ‘ 
You will notice in my report the daily attendance is better, 
our school-terms are longer, and compensation of teachers 
greater this vear than last.
-P-A-G-E-219

Since I have been in the office, I have enjoyed the co-opera- 
‘tion of teachers and the County Court in trying to build up our 
school-interest. Of course, we have made some mistakes, but 
we shall endeavor to avoid a repetition, and go to meet the de- 
mands of next year with renewed energy, and the hope that our 
State Superintendent will honor us with a visit.

Dear Srr—I herewith inclose you my annual report for the 
year ending June 30, 1891, which is as near correct as I can 
make it, but I must confess that to make a full and absolutely 
correct report is the next thing to an impossibility in my county, 
for the simple reason that a full and correct report cannot be 
obtained from the District Directors; but I hope that my report 
will come up to the average. The schools in my county are in 
a very prosperous condition, and, seemingly, every body taking 
a wonderful interest in them, the result of which is, our people 
are seeing the need of public.schools more and more every day. 
The Normal School for Hawkins County convened on July 
20, 1891, at the Synodical College chapel. I was assisted by 
Profs. Graybill and T. C. Karns, of the University of Tennes- 
see, and Miss Julia Doak, of Nashville. Very respectfully,

Hoy. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instructions 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I herewith transmit my annual report for the 
year ending June 80, 1891. There have been no schools in 
session since my election (January, 1891). The schools for the 
year were taught during the summer and fall of 1890, and 
while I have traveled over the county to get statistics, I have 
fonnd nothing upon which I can make a satisfactory report. 
The teachers failed to prepare abstracts, consequently the Di- 
rectors cannot give the desired information. In January I 
called the Directors of the county together, and organized them 
into an educational board. They adopted a uniform series of 
text-books and graded schools and rules for the government of 
schools. ‘These have been printed and given to the teachers of 
the county, and I feel confident that during next year our 
schools will be a unit in text-books, graded schools, and school- 
work generally. 
In June we were favored with a State Normal, conducted by 
yourself, Captain Paine, Superintendent of the Public Schools 
of Jackson, Tenn., and Professor Rose, of Bells, Tenn., and 
though it was not as well attended as we had hoped, yet it has 
awakened an interest in public schools that had not hitherto 
existed in the county. I am satisfied that.another visit from 
you and your popular conductors will call together a full at- 
tendance of teachers and the public generally. 
I believe the County Court is beginning to see the absolute 
necessity of longer schools and the great importance of edu- 
cating the boys and girls attending our public schools, and are 
anxious to do what they can to increase the public school fund. 
I hope to be able to give you a report as nearly perfect as 
possible next year. Respectfully submitted, 
W. A. TANNER, 
Superintendent.

extremely sorry to say that it has been next to impossible to 
obtain District Clerks’ reports. I have written to them, talked 
with them, and notified them through the county paper more 
than once, and they have promised to respond, but less than

Your instruction, “to visit the various districts,” would be 
the only way to secure the statistics, and how can I do that on 
a salary of $150? I will receive less than fifty cents per day 
now for my official services. 
Tam still at work notifying the clerks, and if I can obtain

Henry County that our educational interests are advancing. A 
large number of our teachers are well qualified, and are doing 
good work. When I was returned to office, I was somewhat 
alarmed over the condition of things, but I have caused a re- 
action to take place, and now the public school interest is on

I called a meeting of the School Directors of the county on 
July 11, at which meeting we adopted a uniform series of text- 
books for the secondary course for the county, 
T held our County Institute in July, which was well attended 
by both teachers and citizens of the town and surrounding © 
country. We were assisted by Prof. M. Ross, of Bells’ High 
School, and Prof. T. A. Mitchell, of Manlyville High School. Our 
Institutes have done more to arouse the teachers to a sense of 
their duty than any thing else. A goodly number of the young 
men and women of the county, realizing the importance of good 
schools, have gone to work with an earnestness never before 
manifested in our county to qualify themselves properly for 
school-work. The best men of the county approve of your new 
mode of examination of teachers. I have used every effort 
possible to advance the schools of Henry County since I was 
inducted into the office of County Superintendent, and, while 
I do not claim a complete success, I feel that the schools are in 
a condition to do better work in the future. Respectfully,

Duar Srr—Please find inclosed my second annual report of 
the schools of Hickman County. Iam indeed sorry that I have 
been obliged to withhold my report until this late hour. I am 
also sorry that a portion of this report is not strictly correct. 
Owing to the sickness of myself and family, 1 have been un- 
able to visit the schools of the county as I had desired, and 
some of the Directors having failed to make their reports, I 
have been obliged to approximate in a few instances. How- 
ever, I believe you will find this report very nearly correct.

Ge ie, 
During the latter part of June, Professors Wharton and 
Weber conducted a State Institute in our county town. This 
was probably the most successful Institute ever held in this por- 
tion of the State. 
These two gentlemen rendered themselves very popular while 
in our midst. We followed this with a County Normal,.which 
proved to be very successful. I want to say just here that I 
believe that we, as County Superintendents, can accomplish 
good in no way better than by working diligently for a State 
Institute, and then following it up with a good, lively Count 
Normal. : 
Valuable work was done in these Institutes by Profs. Wade 
and Loggins, of the Dickson Normal, and by Prof. Haynes, of 
Lewisburg, and by Miss Barthenia Nance, of Charlotte, Tenn. 
Many of our local teachers also rendered us good service. 
A Normal for the teachers of color was held in July, which 
resulted-in much good. All our teachers were strengthened by 
these meetings, and I am satisfied that the good accomplished 
will never be realized in this life. We were very much disap- 
pointed by not having your presence. 
The schools of Hickman County are in a better condition 
than ever before. While several of our schools are as yet. un- 
graded, our teachers are being aroused on this subject, and I be- 
lieve that in the near future that this important step will be 
taken. 
Iam, very truly,

Dear Str—In submitting my first annual report of the public 
schools of Humphreys County, am pleased to state that the 
scholastic population and daily attendance have increased. 
We need longer schools, more and better school-houses, a 
uniform series of books, and fewer school-districts. I have 
found several teachers who did not know in what district they 
were teaching. Have endeavored to show the Directors the in- 
consistency of this subdividing districts. We have taken steps 
toward adopting a uniform series of books. We have a few non- 
progressive teachers ; however, the majority are good workers. 
The M’Adow Seminary, under the supervision of Prof. W. E. 
Miller, is moving on nicely. 
Iam aware of the fact that there are some of our counties 
in advance of Humphreys in educational work; however, I feel 
safe in saying it is not the worst county in the State. ; 
Very truly, 
Miss Nannig A. Scorr,

Ton. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I herewith. submit to you my annual report for 
the year commencing July 1, 1890, and ending June 30, 1891, 
of the public schools of Jackson County, Tenn. You will 
please notice that the scholastic population given in my report 
is 5,407. This is the population for 1891, but the population
-P-A-G-E-225
: SEO), 
for 1890 is 5,215. The cause of this is that there appeared a 
mistake in the population of Jackson County, in the State 
_ apportionment last year, and this time I thought best to give 
it for both years. We have the best interest, both with teachers 
and pupils, ever manifested before in Jackson County, and this 
year I have tried to arouse the parents and tax-payers, and also 
the Justices of the Peace, but I fear that I have not accom- 
plished much; and yet, here lies the strongest arm of scholastic 
power. 
My examination was close, and without partiality, fear, or 
favor, and I was rewarded only in selecting efficient teachers 
and with persecution for my honest efforts for the greatest good 
of the children of my county. 
I tried to get the Directors of Jackson County to adopt a 
series of text-books last year and failed, but this year I have 
succeeded in this matter, and the effect of the same is very 
visible for good, and it is the most satisfactory work of my 
superintendency, both with teachers and pupils. Some few 
parents have complained, yet I think that by next year there 
will not be a dissenting voice, and that they would not have it 
otherwise, by any means. 
By licensing those who merited an average on all the branches 
prescribed by the school-law, I think that I let in few who were 
not qualified to teach, but it appears to me that any one should 
merit an average in each branch. We now need more money, 
better houses, less schools in the county, and the standard of 
teachers elevated in efficiency and price. We have new School 
Directors, and it has been very hard to get up the reports, but 
I think that my report is very near correct. 
Your obedient servant, 
Hyram Puarris,

Dear Str—I herewith submit my third annual report of the 
public schools of James County, for the scholastic year ending 
June 30,1891. My tardiness in making my report is due to 
tardiness of trustees and clerks in making their reports. 
My report is as nearly correct as I can make it, for my prede- 
cessor never required or insisted on full reports, therefore, I . 
found nothing scarcely in the office from which to report. Our 
“schools ‘are doing well, and the teachers are live men and 
women, and work with a will. 
Last June we held a five days’ Normal for teachers, and em- 
ployed the services of Prof. B. F. Jones, who did: much toward 
‘inspiring the teachers. On visiting the schools, I find the 
teachers practicing the latest methods, and obtaining good 
results. 
You will observe that my predecessor reports for this county 
twenty-three first-grade certificates last year, while I report 
only fifteen. This is no proof that we are retrograding, but 
rather advancing, for we have the same teachers this year with 
second-grade certificates that last year held first-grades. You 
will also notice that the Superintendent of Bradley reports 
several first-grades this year; but I have had the task of exam- 
ining one of his teachers this year, and I find that I can give 
only 65 on same studies where he had 90 or 95. Thisis the 
reason there are no more first-grades reported from my county. 
My Directors pay teachers holding second-grade certificates 
from my examination this year more than they paid first-grades 
last year. I find that practical but rigid examinations inspire 
teachers to prepare themselves, and, knowing they must, they 
prepare themselves. 
I do hope there will be a law binding Directors to do their of- 
ficial duty, pay them for their work, and fine them for not at- 
8s, P.1—Ap. C.

tending to their work. A person must be paid if he does his 
work well. 
We pay good salaries for competent teachers. * * * * 
We have as yet only one secondary school in the county, but 
will establish three more some time this month.

Denar S1r—I herewith submit to you my first annual report 
for the scholastic year ending June 30,1891. A failure on the 
part of some of the Directors to make their reports on time has’ 
delayed me in making this report, which I hope may not give 
you any inconvenience. I have had some extra trouble in get- 
ting reports from teachers and Directors. I have visited every 
school in the county, both white and colored—some of them 
two and three times—give brief talks to each school, with very 
few’ exceptions. I have held five Institutes—three for the 
whites, and two for the colored. They were all well attended, 
Superintendent Frank M. Smith was present at one of our In- 
stitutes, and his talk was very fine. 
The Peabody Normal was held in Maury Academy, June 29 
to July 4, 1891. The State was represented by Prof. T. C. 
Karns and Miss Julia A. Doak. The State Normal was a 
grand success in every respect. I am indebted to you for said 
Normal, and am very sorry that you were not present. I feel 
that your presence would have added much interest to the occa- 
sion. Prof. Karns will forever occupy a fresh place in the minds

of our teachers. Miss Julia A. Doak did some excellent work. 
We are all very proud of such a talented woman. She was 
formerly an East Tennessee girl. She was liked very much by 
all the teachers, especially the young men: 
May God speed the day when the patrons of Jefferson County 
will be aroused on the subject of education and help to raise 
our public schools to a higher standard.

usual. Taking the schools as a whole, they are getting along 
in a very satisfactory manner. The graded system is getting

Dear Str—I submit this, my annual report, for the fiscal 
year ending June 30, 1891, of the public schools of Knox 
County. The public schools of Knox County are in a pros- 
perous condition, and are doing a grand work toward educating 
the masses of the people. The terms of school are from seven 
to nine months in the country districts.   
NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
The Normal Institute for white teachers convened at Knox- 
ville, in the public hall, of the .court-house, on July 13, 1891, 
lasting one week. There was an enrollment of two hundred, 
teachers, with an average attendance of one hundred and 
seventy-five. [ was assisted in the Institute work by Hon. F. 
M. Smith, late State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and 
Prof. T. C. Karns, of the University of Tennessee. There 
were quite a number of prominent teachers, both from the city 
and county schools, who made valuable and interesting sugges- 
tions to the Institute on subjects pertaining to school-work. 
We feel that this was the most enthusiastic Institute that Knox 
County has ever had. 
The State Normal Institute for colored teachers convened at 
the same place on July 22, 1891, the Knox County Colored 
Teachers’ Institute meeting in connection with the same. The 
Institute was conducted under the supervision of the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by the County 
Superintendent of Knox County, and Professors J. 8. Cobb 
and B. J. Campbell, the latter two being colored. The attend- 
ance was large, twelve counties of Hast Tennessee being repre- 
sented. The colored teachers of Hast Tennessee are doing 
much toward elevating their race. 
THACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
We have held quite a number of Institutes in the county for
-P-A-G-E-230
seas 
the teachers, Directors, and patrons of the schools, all of which 
were well attended. We feel that this is an excellent way to 
get the people interested in the cause of education. Here all 
_ can-meét on a common level and discuss. plans best suited to 
the various communities. 
I desire to say that the only thing necessary for Knox County 
to have a public school system second to none, is for the people 
to take the interest that they should, and I believe will, in the 
education of their children. 
I have examined and recommended for an appointment to a 
free scholarship in the University of Tennessee eighteen young 
men, three of whom were colored, who receive a free scholar- 
ship in the Knoxville Colored College. I also, in accordance 
with the law and instructions from the State Superintendent, 
held a competitive examination for a scholarship in the Pea- 
body Normal College, at Nashville, Tenn. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
We have established in Knox County eight secondary schools, 
and have adopted a uniform system of text-books for the same, 
and have had printed and distributed a “ course of study and 
rules for the government” of those schools. 
The Knox County Teachers’ Circulating Library is in a 
prosperous condition. We have placed in the library three 
hundred volumes, consisting of all kinds of books essential to 
_ general information. The library is a new feature in connec- 
tion with the public schools of the county, and is doing much 
toward raising the standard of the teachers. : 
The scholastic population of Knox County 4s 23,424, an in- 
crease over last year of 1,629.

Duar Srr—In conformity to my duty under the law, I here- 
with submit my annual report of the schools and school-mat- _ 
ters of my county. You will remark an improvement in some 
particulars, and falling off in others, in comparison with last 
year. I call your attention to the item of “cost of tuition per 
pupil per month.” This present year it is 57 cents; last year it 
‘was 70 cents; but, on the other hand, the enrollment in propor- 
tion to population is much less, and the “average daily attend- 
ance” is a slight. falling off, from last year. 
On the whole, I think we can feel hopeful. The Directors of 
my county, with the exception of two districts, have classified 
the various schools, and we shall have three or more secondary 
schools in the county. Iam also grading the schools as fast as 
possible, and expect to systematize the grading and. perfect it. 
Ihave not received any blanks for diplomas, nor any instruc- 
tions from you relative to how these shall be issued.
-P-A-G-E-232
There has been a falling off of at least twenty-five per cent. 
of school-revenue, on account of the Trustee not having au- 
thority to collect earlier. Would thank you for a reference to 
that matter in your general report. 
Very respectfully, 
L. Dowraupson,

Hon. W. R. Garret, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—Please find inclosed my annual report. I should 
be delighted could I give so satisfactory and encouraging a re- 
_ port as . am sure many others will do. 
We are badly deficient in enthusiasm and educational in- 
terest. In proportion to scholastic population, the enrollment 
is out of all reason. The average attendance is even worse. 
This is a very large county, containing eighty-one schools, the 
supervision of which consumes my entire time from the middle 
of July until the first of October, hence my delay in forwarding 
my report. 
Whilst our schools are not such as we desire, yet there is a 
gradual and steady improvement in many. One great disad- 
vantage under which we labor is the number of teachers who 
are teaching as a stepping-stone to something else, or as a 
means of obtaining a little cash between the laying-by of crops 
and gathering the same. We need a school-fund sufficient to 
employ ‘professional teachers who have fitted themselves for the 
work. Until we can give such employment for at least five or 
six months during the year, we can never hope for the desired 
improvement in our schools. I really think there should be 
some other test than that of scholarship in the examination and
-P-A-G-E-233
eee Re 
grading of teachers. Many who stand the best examinations are 
the poorest teachers, aud many feel no further interest than to 
successfully stand the examination and obtain the certificate. 
After. numerous calls for teachers’ meetings, we have never 
had-more than a dozen at any one meeting, and the larger 
number of them were those engaged regularly in teaching. 
There are many teachers in the county, who have taught the 
public schools during the summer for the last two or three 
years, who have never attended a teachers’ meeting. I think 
we need a better paid Directory, and there would be more in- 
terest taken in the schools on their part, for I notice that the 
schools are best in those districts where the Directors take most 
interest. 
Have made but poor success in grading schools. How can I 
do so, when teachers tell me they have not time? As to secon- 
dary schools, none have been established in the county. Except 
in the town and villages, there are not enough pupils in any 
one school to justify their establishment, and, as the former 
schools already have the advantage in teachers, length of term, 
etc., I have not insisted on the former being made secondary 
schools. Really, we are not ready for the Jacobs bill, * * 
How can we expect to prepare pupils for the high schools with 
only three months’ tuition during each year? Weshould have 
a uniform system of text-books, and their use enforced in the 
schools. I do not see how it is ever to be accomplished until 
the power to do so is delegated to other than District Directors, 
for a large majority in this county confess themselves incompe- 
tent to make a selection, for their thought and attention are 
directed in another channel. 
Hoping to be able to make a more favorable report another 
year, I remain, Yery respectfully yours, 
Mrs. L. A. Watkins,

Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dersr Sir—I sent you a short time ago my first annual report 
of the public schools of Lawrence County. ‘In making this re- 
port, I do not wish to be understood as thinking that our 
schools have reached a state of perfection, for such is impossi- 
ble. I am very glad to say that our schools are progressing 
rapidly. : 
We held a County Institute at Lawrenceburg during the 
summer, which lasted six weeks, and the teachers were greatly 
encouraged. Monthly meetings are held in many of the dis- 
triets by the teachers and Directors. The great need in our 
public school system is more money, so that we can have longer 
schools and better houses. We trust the day is not far distant 
when the opportunity of obtaining a gond, practical education 
shall be placed in the hands of every child in Lawrence County 
and the State of Tennessee. I trust the members of our County 
Court will stand by the schools nobly in the future, as they 
have ever done in the past. ' 
May God speed the day when the people of Lawrence County 
will view this subject in, its true and important light! 
Respectfully, ‘

You will see that I only report twenty-three schools in 
county. . This was the number we had prior to July 1, 1891. : 
We now have about twenty-six. 
I think you will find this report as near correct as it is pos- 
_ sible to make it from the meager and imperfect reports received 
from Directors and teachers. 
Iam glad to be able to state that I think our teachers are 
working harder.and doing more efficient work than they have 
ever done in the past. 
Our Normal Institute was favored with better attendance, and 
all seemed more interested in the work than they had hereto- 
fore, but there is much to be done in our county yet before our 
schools are what they ought to be. ‘ 
It seems that it is impossible to get all of our Directors to 
make their reports at proper time. We have visited every dis- 
trict in the county,since July:1, and in some had to assist in 
taking scholastic enumeration in order to get it at all. 
_ All of which is respectfully submitted,

We are making progress in educational work. I held an 
Institute during the month of June, which was well attended 
and much good accomplished. The last week of the Institute 
was conducted asa State Normal by Thomas H. Paine, of Jack- 
son, and P. H. Manning, of Nashville. They did very effective 
work, and the teachers were thoroughly satisfied with their 
work. 
Beginning with the first Monday in June, 1892, I will hold a 
month’s Institute. A large attendance is anticipated. 
At the present stage of public school advancement, I know 
of no better means of awakening an interest among teachers, of 
quickening their asperations, and of stimulating them to more 
effective and thorough work than the Institute. 
' ; Very respectfully, 
M. R. ABERNATHY, 
Superintendent. 
Monteomery County. 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Please find inclosed my annual report of the 
schools of Montgomery County, and permit me to say that the 
majority of schools in this county are up with the times; and, 
with wide-awake Directors and teachers, we expect to keep step 
‘with the leading counties of the State. 
The County Institute, which was held at Clarksville last 
July, was well attended, and much interest was manifest. The 
State (colored) Institute, held at the same place, was a success 
also. The white teachers have organized the Montgomery 
County Educational Association, and meet monthly. We con 
sider these meetings very important, as an effort is being made 
}
-P-A-G-E-237
ee : 
to grade the schools; and, in order to do this, it becomes nec- 
essary to hold such meetings. 
Last summer the Directors adopted a uniform series of text- 
books for use in the primary and secondary schools, and the 
same “course of study” is expected to be carried out in. every 
school. 
About ten secondary schools have been established and are 
now running under favorable circumstances, and we are glad to 
know that nearly every one has two teachers. 
Some new school-houses are being built on modern plans. 
These are on lots bought and deeded to the School Directors as 
school-property. Many old houses are being furnished with 
the best desks in the market. We hope the time will soon 
come, when school and church-property will be separate. 
Please allow us to say we heartily indorse the recent changes 
in the school-laws. Many teachers are now aspiring to higher 
positions than that of “teacher in a primary school,” and we 
shall expect a better grade of teachers in a few years. * 
In some districts, where too many schools have been run, an 
effort is being made to consolidate, in order that the term may 
be lengthened; and it is hoped that this, tco, will prove suc- 
cessful. °

While our schools are not, by any means, perfect, and the 
people are not taking the interest in school-work that they 
should, yet we are pleased to report that sure progress has 
been made in Monroe County. With some exceptions, the 
schools have been well managed and well taught. The average 
salary paid teachers is very low, hence, many of our older and 
better educators emigrate, and a large number of our schools 
are taught by young and inexperienced teachers. This defect 
may soon be remedied, as our Directors are becoming more lib- 
eral in their views concerning salaries. The majority of our 
schools are as yet ungraded, but our teachers are working for a 
more systematic classification that will result in the grading of 
our schools: Time is required for a work of such importance. 
The great hindering cause to a more rapid improvement is the 
lack of sufficient school-funds. 
There has been no trouble on the question of text-books. 
The adopted course is being used in all parts of the county. 
Text-books for use in the secondary schools will be adopted by 
the Directors at their next semi-annual meeting, October 6, 
1891. 
Our Normal Institute continued five days, and much interest 
was shown by the eighty-five or ninety teachers present. I was 
assisted by Profs. Geo. W. Huddleston, Hiwassee College; J. 
P. Hicks, Morganton High School; J. C. Hicks, Bolivar Acad- 
emy; T.’L. Bryan, Sweetwater City School; J. M. Clemmer, 
Oak Hill School ; and W. L. Lawrence, Esq. Several Teachers’ 
Institutes and educational meetings have been held in different 
portions of the county, and have been reasonably well attended. 
Acting on the suggestion of the State Superintendent that it 
is better to have good primary schools rather than poor second- 
ary ones, no secondary schools’ have been established, few dis- 
tricts having sufficient funds to run a good school of the higher 
grade. 
The Teachers’ Head-light, a sixteen-page educational journal, 
published at Sweetwater, Tenn., by Prof. Thos. L. Bryan, is 
doing good work. Although it has been established only about
-P-A-G-E-239
Sa 
one year, it has readers in many States, and has a subscription- 
list of seven hundred. 
The Monroe Democrat of September 30 says: “From all in- 
dications, the free schools of Monroe County are in a very 
flourishing condition, and are more Prospero than they have 
ever been before.”

Duar Str—Inclosed you will find my annual report for the 
year ending June 30, 1891. 
This report is as near correct as I can make it with the sta- 
tistics that I have beforeme. The financial report may not be 
correct altogether. Our ex-Trustee reported $304.57 on hand 
at the beginning of the year; the present Trustee does not know 
how it was disposed of, but thinks it was paid to teacher; in 
‘that case, it is correct. 
You will see that I have not reported on grades. Last year 
was the first year of grading in the county. Some teachers 
graded their schools, others made no effort to grade, so I can- 
not report correctly on grading, and have left it off altogether. 
Our people are well pleased with the new law providing for a 
graded course of study. I think by the close of the year our 
schools will be very well graded, and giving better satisfaction 
than ever before. We adopted the graded course of study you 
prepared, and have had no trouble to get the teachers of the
-P-A-G-E-240

: county to adopt it and grade their schools accordingly. So far, 
our schools are moving along very well. 
I think I can see the dawning of a bright future for Meigs 
County, which I hope to see light up every nook and corner, 
and raise the people up to the height for which the public 
school system is intended. 
May great success attend your every effort, and the public 
schools be raised to a greater height under your administration 
than ever before.

on account of getting a report from the Trustee and some of 
the Directors. It is as near accurate as I can make it from 
what I have received. There seems to be a lack of interest on 
the part of some of our Directors. I cannot get them to make 
a full report of all work. 
We held two Normal Institutes this year, one for white and 
one for colored. They were moderately well attended, and 
considerable interest taken in them, both by teachers and 
prominent educators. 
The schools throughout the county are in a very good con- 
dition. They will run this year between four and five months, 
on an average.

one hundred and fifty Directors, instead of thirty-six, and fifty

Since I was elected County Superintendent, which was the 
first Monday in last January, I have endeavored to do allin my 
power to promote the school-system in my county. The first 
step I took towards progress was to organize a colored teach- 
ers’ association, which enthused them very much, and I can see 
already that a great deal of good is resulting from it. After 
this, I organized the white teachers of Macon County. We 
meet once a month, discuss methods of teaching, courses of 
study, ete. We have very large crowds at these meetings, and 
everybody seems to enjoy themselves very much. Everybody 
is inclined to think that these meetings will accomplish a great 
deal of good among teachers of the county. We have music on 
these occasions, and the neighborhood generally turns out well. 
The places where we have met, the people are always hospitable, 
bringing with them baskets of delicious victuals, and invite 
everybody to partake with them, consequently you can see that 
these associations tend to get up an interest in the way of 
education.

Dear S1r—Inclosed you will find my annual report. I have 
had some difficulty in getting up the necessary papers to make 
my report, and, owing to the failure or neglect of County Su- 
perintendent or Directors, teachers were not furnished with 
“abstracts,” consequently they could not make their report. 
Our Trustee has failed to report to me, and says he has no 
itemized account by which he can. Now, after all this failure 
on the part of Trustee and school-officers, I cannot have a cor-
-P-A-G-E-244
go 
rect report as the law directs. By the perusal of all the books 
of the Superintendent and the reports of the punctual Directors, 
Iam able to make a reasonable report. As I do not have the 
Trustee’s report, my estimate of the financial condition of the 
county may not be accurate. In case this is so, I shall inform 
you as soon as ascertained. 
Our schools, with a few exceptions, are good, and moving on 
nicely. . 
We held an annual Normal Institute, in the month of July, 
which was conducted by Prof. D. R. Case, the well-known ed- 
ucator of our county. Not all of our teachers were present, 
but the number that attended manifested a great interest, and, : 
at the’ close, a semi-monthly Teachers’ Association was organ- 
ized, which has been largely attended, and I think a great deal 
of good accomplished. 
One of the greatest impediments in our school-work, is in- 
competent, short-sighted, prejudiced School Directors. The 
Legislature ought to enact some law, by which Directors shall 
be forced to make a full and correct report, and receive fees for 
their official work. 
I trust they may be more prompt in the future.

Tam glad to report that our schools are in a most healthy 
condition. The public schools of Obion County, I feel assured, 
were never in a more thrifty and prosperous state. This state 
of affairs is due, in no small degree, to the two Institutes held 
in this county the past summer. Our teachers are better qual- 
ified in every respect. They are more confident, more bold, 
and more enthusiastic. 
The Institute for white teachers was held at Union City, and 
" was conducted by Prof. W. C. Barnhart, a well-known and 
enthusiastic educator, of Peoria, Ill. There were fifty-eight 
teachers in attendance. The exercises were very animated 
throughout the session of ten days. 
Hi. 8. H. Bawkins, of River, Tenn., conducted the Institute 
for colored teachers. There were twenty-eight in attendance, 
and Professor Bawkins assures us a most lively interest was 
manifested. 
I must not omit to say that the members of our County 
Court are becoming aroused to the necessity for better equipped 
teachers. They gave evidence of this interest at the January 
term of the court by making an appropriation of one hundred 
dollars for Institute purposes. 
T have visited most of the schools in the county, and have 
tried, in the best way I knew, to encourage them, and to instil 
into them a new life and a renewed effort in the direction of a 
more perfect educational system. 
We hope to have the Hon. W. R. Garrett with us at no dis- 
tant day to talk to our people about educational matters. If 
he could find time to make one or two addresses in each county 
in the State, we think great and lasting good might be accom- 
plished. At any rate, we hereby extend to him a most cordial 
invitation to visit Obion County at his earliest convenience, to 
talk to our people about public schools and how to make them 
the most successful and profitable.

Dear Sir—I herewith transmit to you my first annual report 
of Overton County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. 
I think my report is nearly correct. I have endeavored to 
make it as nearly so as was in my power. 
I have finished my first round of ‘visitations. I find nearly 
all of our teachers doing better work than has been done in 
this county any previous year. I am glad to be able to state 
that there has been more interest manifested by our people and 
School Directors than ever before. Many of our teachers are 
now well qualified to do good work, and those who are not so 
well qualified are waking up to the fact that they must go to 
work and qualify themselves or be left, and let others teach. 
Our schools are all graded, and our teachers have generally 
tried to carry out the plan of grading as best they could. 
Theld a County Normal at Livingston, commencing June 29 
and continued two weeks, which was well attended by the 
teachers, and was in every respect a success. Prof. A. H. Rob- 
erts, our principal instructor, did excellent work. He is the 
best Normal teacher in, the mountain counties. 
We have a teachers’ association organized in this county, 
which meets the first Saturday in each month. 
We have not yet secured a uniform series of text-books for 
this county, but think we will have by the first of July, 1892. 
Besides the public schools in this county, we have the Alpine 
Institute, under the supervision of Profs. Bowden and Roberts, 
and the Overton Academy, under the supervision of Prof. | 
Williams. 
I heartily indorse the wise consideration of our Legislature 
in having our public schools graded. I think it a reform in the 
public school system of Tennessee that will do much good.

“ — 92 — 
The teachers also seem well pleased with the graded system. 
Teachers in this county have met with some trouble in grading 
schools where pupils had been carried in some branches and 
other branches left untouched, but we think that this year’s 
work will greatly relieve us of those troubles, and we look with 
bright anticipation for better results next year than we have 
ever had in this county.

Dear Str—I have the honor to transmit herewith my annual 
report for the year ending June 80, 1891. This report is nearly 
correct—as much so as I can make it from the returns of the 
Directors, and from notes taken from visitatians to every part 
of the county. 
\ 
It gives me pleasure to state that our schools\are a greater 
success this year than any previous year. A majority of our 
teachers have enlisted in the noble work of educatipn, heart and 
soul, and have determined to maintain the dignity of the pro- 
- fession regardless of obstacles thrown in their way.      
    I wish to thank you in the name of Putnam Cofinty for the 
the State Institute. The State was represented by} Capt. C. 8. 
Douglass and Prof. Lyons, assisted by Profs. S. 1B. Yeargan,
-P-A-G-E-250
uO 
Huff, Thompson, Boone, Gross, and others. The Institute was 
a great success in every respect. I am thankful to you for the 
Institute. We were much disappointed on account of the ab- 
sence of our State Superintendent. Captain Douglass has en- 
shrined himself in the hearts of our people. Prof. Lyons will 
ever occupy a fresh spot in the memory of our teachers and peo- 
ple. These men did noble work for our teachers. 
After the State Normal, the County Normal lasted one week. 
It would be tedious to give the names of all who took part 
in this week’s work. It was indeed a hive of working bees; 
such earnest efforts, such hearty good will and social feeling! 
All left the Normal enthusiastic, determined to persevere in the 
great work of education. 
I have visited nearly all of the schools in the county. I 
found nearly all of them doing exceedingly well. In every de- 
partment of school-work we are happy to note progress. I[ 
have held six Teachers’ Institutes. They have accomplished 
much good. Our people throughout the county are mani- 
festing much more interest than ever before. I feel sure that 
Putnam County is gaining ground in educational interest.

been required to keep abstracts, and in some districts I find no 
registers. Where this happens I find it impossible to get a 
complete report. When I catled for the District Clerks’ reports, 
many of them did not know that they were required by law to 
make such report. : 
I am gratified to note the improvement in the teachers of 
this county. I think they are beginning to realize that they 
must qualify themselves thoroughly or be left behind by others 
who are more ambitious. They are making greater effort than 
they have ever made before. The Directors are paying better 
salaries than they have for a few years past. I think that 
Roane County in a few years can boast of as good a corps of 
teachers as any county in the State, and our schools will be 
among the best. 
The State Normal Institute, which was held in this county 
during the last week of June, I do not hesitate to say was a 
success, and did much and lasting good for the teachers. The 
examinations were well attended and the result satisfactory. 
We have regular monthly meetings, in which the teachers take 
great interest. They also have irregular meetings in the several 
districts.

Dear Sirn—Herewith find my fifth aunual report for Robert-

connection with the year’s work. We formulated and published 
a graded course of study to go into effect at the beginning of
-P-A-G-E-252
  Oe 
the year, and insisted strenuously upon the schools all being 
graded accordingly. But the teachers met with so many stub- 
born difficulties that only twenty-five schouls are reported 
graded. We hope to complete the grading this year. 
There are some things encouraging in the report. The aver- 
age attendance is better. The length of the school-term has 
increased. So has the average compensation of teachers. The 
increase in the school-fund is gratifying. 
The late amendments to the school-law are generally ap- 
proved by our people. 
Our public schools are growing constantly in interest and 
usefulness, and in popularity with all classes of people.

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith send my first annual report, which I 
have based upon estimates from statistics returned. You will 
find a considerable decrease in many tabular items from last 
year’s report, but I have avoided flattering estimates, and made 
close calculations of facts, believing such to be the purpose of 
these school-statistics. The only apology I have to make for 
this seeming great decrease in enrollment, average attendance, 
value of property, etc., is that the schools are really in a far 
better condition than they have been any time in the past, with 
yet very great room for improvement. 
Lam trying to raise the standard of school-work by rigid 
written examinations for teachers, by insisting upon fewer

schools more centrally located, with better grades and longer 
terms. The regular summer Institutes and monthly meetings 
for both white and colored have been kept up, with an excellent 
attendance of teachers. 
Let me congratulate you upon the success of your untiring 
efforts in securing the passage of that grand secondary school 
law, which will prove the salvation of the State in its free 
school interests, if you can only get the co-operation of County 
Courts and Superintendents. In conclusion, let me say that I 
am heartily in the work, and shall ever be at your command.

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Under a separate cover I mail you my third an- 
nual report of the public schools of Sevier County for the 
scholastic year ending June 80, 1891. 
I am very much pleased with the educational work in this 
county the past year, though it has been somewhat similar to 
that of last, with a marked degree of improvement in the sys- 
tem of classifying and grading the schools. 
Theld a two weeks’ Normal Institute at H. C. and N.Acad: » 
emy, assisted by Profs. J. H. McCallie, W. 8S. Bryan, D. G. 
Emert, and J. F. Sharp. The Institute was very well attended, 
and much interest manifested in the educational work. Our 
monthly teachers’ meetings have been very interesting and 
profitable, educating the masses and molding the public mind 
in favor of a higher and a more thorough education. 
Our Directors’ meetings have been very well attended, and 
much good done in the way of establishing and putting into 
operation a more thorough system for the efficient management 
of the public schools of the county. In compliance with the 
late school-law, requiring country schools to be classified and 
graded, a course of study and rules of government have been 
  | . 
    
    adopted for the primary and secondary schools of the county, 
the good results of which are clearly visible in a majority of the 
schools, and by our next report we expect to be able to report 
all the schools of the county well classified and graded. We 
We have sixty-seven frame school-houses, very well furnished 
with blackboards, charts, maps, etc. Since the date of our last 
report we have built six good frame school-houses at a cost of 
$1,621. I am proud to be able to report the number of log 
school-houses decreasing each year. We have only fifteen log 
houses—one for each district, lacking one. 
Murphy College, which was being built at the time of my last 
report, is now nearly completed, and will be ready for occupancy 
by the first of the year.

Hoy. W..R: Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dpar Str—It affords me much pleasure to report that the 
year 1891 has been a year of substantial progress in our schools. 
As compared with 1890, the record of the year shows decidedly 
greater advancement on the scholastic and intellectual side, as 
well as in the matter of providing new buildings. 
The material changes which have been made in the curricu- 
lum of studies, will have a tendency to elevate our county pub- 
lie schools to a still higher grade of usefulness. Since the es- 
tablishment of high schools in the county, we are able to give 
our children not only an elementary and intermediate instruc- 
tion, but also a higher education to those who may desire it. 
The State Normal, which was held in this city last June, con- 
ducted by Capt. Thomas H. Paine, assisted by Prof. A. L. Pur- 
ington, was decidedly the most successful ever held in Shelby 
County. 
At the close of the State Normal a County Institute was held, 
followed by a teachers’ examination. Profs. W. 8. Jones, J. B. 
Williams, W.8. Watson, of this city, and Prof. J. T. McCleary, 
of Minnesota, were with us during our meetings, and the valu- 
able ‘assistance which they gave us contributed greatly toward 
making our Institute.a profitable one.

ising.

Hon. W. R. Garrurr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit this, my third annual 
report, of the schools of Smith County. The school-interest in 
this county is steadily growing. We have not so large an en- 
rollment as last year of the scholastic population, but more en- 
rolled in the schools and a better average daily attendance. 
Our teachers, generally, are well qualified and are doing good 
work. They attend our monthly meetings well and take an 
active part in every thing that is calculated to advance the cause 
of education. 
We have had a uniform system of text-books in use in this 
county for four years, and the Directors, on July 6 last, re- 
adopted the same, excepting history, for another period of four 
years, commencing September 1. 
In compliance with the new school-law and your instructions, 
Lhave prepared a form for grading the schools of this county, 
which I confidently believe will be adopted by the teachers and 
successfully put in execution. 
This report has been delayed a little, but it is hoped its accu- 
_ racy will compensate for the short delay. 
Respectfully, 
J. G. Brown, 
Superintendent.

Hon. W. R. Gaprert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith submit to you my annual report for 
the year ending June 30, 1891. “Taking into consideration our 
many disadvantages, I think our schools are doing remarkably 
well. 
Our Normal Institute, held at Dover in July, conducted by 
Capt. C. 8. Douglas, of Gallatin, Tenn., was a complete success. 
Captain Douglas did noble work, and the teachers attending 
felt that they had received an educational feast. This is the 
first Normal Institute that Stewart County ever had, and the 
teachers feel that they have been greatly benefited by.it. A 
Teachers’ Monthly Institute was organized early in the spring, 
which is yet in good working order. Quite an interest is 
being manifested in these meetings. Our Institutes have done 
much to arouse intelligent thought in teachers, and to awaken 
public sentiment in favor of education. 
I have visited nearly every school in the county since I was 
elected County Superintendent, last January. Most of this has 
been since June 30, as my report shows. I found most of the 
schools doing good work. 
I have called two meetings of the Directors for the purpose 
of adopting text-books, but nothing has been done. I think at 
our next meeting they will make an adoption. 
The future prospects for the schools of Stewart County are 
brighter than they ever have been. 
Respectfully, 
J. C. Fowzzr,

Hon. W. R: Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
* Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor of transmitting herewith my an- 
nual report for the year ending June 30, 1891. 
Iam pleased very much to be able to report to you that our 
schools are in a prosperous condition. The attendance this 
year thus far is much better than any previous year in the 
history of our schools. The new school-law has had its bearing 
upon our teachers, and I find among them a resolution to im- 
prove their scholarship. 
We have fourteen secondary schools, and pad much trouble 
in securing teachers for many of these schools. Our Directors 
in July adopted text-books for use in both our primary and 
secondary schools. The schools of the county have been graded. 
They are rapidly growing into popular favor, and educational 
interests at this time appear to be much brighter than at any 
time in the past. We have four well-established high schools, 
which run from eight to ten months, besides a number of pri- 
vate schools. Our school-property has been very much im-- 
proved in the last few years. Rapidly is the old log-house giv- 
ing way to the neat frame or brick building. Many of our 
schools have been furnished with the latest improved desk, 
and from five to cight hundred dollars’ worth of charts and 
maps have been placed in our schools this year. 
I employed Profs. W. B. Gale, N. B. Sherfy, and H. D. 
Sproles to assist me in a two-weeks’ County Normal. The in- 
terest taken by teachers, Directors, and the people was indeed 
encouraging. The names of seventy-six teachers were enrolled, 
and the daily attendance of teachers averaged from sixty to 
sixty-five. Prof. D. S. Burleson, of Milligan College, spent 
two days with us, gave us an instructive lecture, and took much 
interest in our Normal work. 
On Directors’ day, Prof. J. W. Repass, of Blutf City, gave us 
an excellent lecture on “Our Common Schools the Hope of our 
"10's. p.1.—Ap. C.
-P-A-G-E-259
— 104 — 
Country.” Prof. Venable, of Sullins College, was with us on 
the last day, and offered our teachers greetings. The Teachers’ 
Institute in this county is well organized and will do good work 
this year. 
My scholastic report shows a falling off of forty-eight. This 
was due to correct enumeration. In the past, in many instances, 
Directors crossed district lines, thereby enumerating children 
twice. This year they: have enumerated according to law, which 
accounts for the result as above stated.

Dear Sir—In submitting to you my first annual report of the 
‘schools and educational work in my (Unicoi) county, I am 
glad that I am able to say the educational prospects are 
brighter for my county than ever before. 
Lheld the Normal the latter part of last July, which was the 
largest and best attended of any Normal ever yet held here. 
Every teacher in the county, except two, were in attendance, 
and great interest was manifested. 
‘When I was elected to the office of Superintendent last Jan- 
uary, there was not a college or even an academy in the county. 
To secure one or both of these within the limits of my county 
was my. first aim. A few of ‘my predecessors in office had 
labored to accomplish this, but the lack of the co-operation of 
the people, and the failure to secure competent teachers wrought 
a failure in every instance. But, knowing that opposition and
-P-A-G-E-261
— 106 — 4 
difficulties are always overcome by a determined and persistent 
effort, I, at the Normal, again made an effort to build up an 
academy at Erwin that would offer an academic education to 
the youths of Unicoi and adjoining counties. And I succeeded ; 
for now we have a first-class academy at Erwin, with competent 
teachers and a large attendance. This, of course, is of inesti- 
mable value to the youths of our section, thereby placing within 
the reach of all our youths the benefits of an academic edu- 
cation. : 
Lam further glad to say that the schools all over the county 
“are doing good work, and the old-time methods and teachers 
are giving way to modern and approved methods, and live, 
competent, and energetic teachers. But still there is room for 
improvement, and we mean to avail ourselves of every oppor- 
tunity to improve our schools. Our motto is, “*Onward and 
Upward.”

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—I herewith transmit to you my first annual report 
of public schools of Van Buren County for the scholastic year 
- énding June 30, 1891.. The report is not correct, but nearly 
so. It is very difficult to get the Directors to do their duty, 
and.a failure on their part will cause me to fail. I think the 
schools are improving in Van Buren, but not as they should do. 
We have had four Institutes up to this date, and expect to 
have them as long as the teachers will attend. 
The people in general are taking more interest in education 
than they have heretofore. é 
Respectfully, 
W. J. Worruineton, 
Superintendent.

Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
» Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—The grading system has greatly improved our 
schools. All of the better class of teachers have graded their 
schools according to the scheme prepared by myself. It has 
aroused new interest, each teacher striving to do more than 
his neighbor. 
The extension of the curriculum will. cause many of our 
young teachers who had completed the course to re-enter school 
and better prepare themselves for the responsible positions they 
are to hold. Our teachers ate nearly all young men and women 
who are striving to secure a better education than their pre-
-P-A-G-E-263
  Loe 
decessors. The consequence is, that we have a far superior _ 
class of teachers to those employed four years ago. The stand- 
ard is constantly rising. i 
Our Directors are more careful in regard to those they em- 
ploy, seeking better teachers in each instance. They also make 
their reports more promptly than ever before, but not so well 
yet as they should. 
The adoption of a uniform series of books has added more 
to our schools than any thing else. The new series of books 
has been introduced in more than half of our schools this 
year, and will be in the remainder next year. 
Each teacher secured the introduction and exchange price, 
and ordered their own books. This proved to be a success; no 
patron failing to take the books, and a sufficient supply too. 
Prof. H. B. Evans was chosen chairman of our Institute, and 
Miss Maude Terrill, Miss Ada Thurman, Prof. John Hopkins, 
M. B. Terrell, Prof. John Clark, and E. B. Etter were chosen 
leading teachers. Prof. J. G. Mealows was chosen to deliver a 
lecture each day on plan and.importance of grading schools. 
All but five of our white teachers were in attendance at the 
Institute during the week. 
A written examination for one and a half days was oe at 
the close of Institute. 
We have twelve secondary schools in our county, many of 
which are well conducted. 
I think the advice of the State Superintendent, not to spoil a 
good primary with a poor secondary school, should be closely 
adhered to. 
I would be glad to see the time when each house in my 
- county would be a separate district, and thereby discontinue so 
many small schools that cannot be discontinued as long as all
-P-A-G-E-264
PETO9 
the schools in the district are run the same length of time. 
This had a good intention, but a bad effect in my county. It 
caused many small schools to be established that should never 
have been. Z ; 
Our school-money is in a reasonably good condition. Teach- 
ers only having to wait until February for about one month’s 
services.

Dear Str—I have the pleasure and honor to submit my third

along the line during the past year. We are having better 
teachers, better houses, better furnished houses, and, seemingly, 
the people generally are taking more interest in our public 
schools than ever before. Under our present school-law our 
boys aud girls can secure a very good, practical, business edu- 
cation. “We have this year twenty-five per cent. more school- 
money than ever before. The future has in store for the old 
county of Washington plenty of money. Inside of four years 
Iam almost sure we will draw $4 per capita. We will get this 
year $2.50. The Jonesboro graded schools are among the best 
in the State. Washington College is doing good work. She © 
sends out some bright young men and ladies. The graded — 
school at Fall Branch is doing excellent work. Johnson City 
is behind with school-buildings. Johnson City, inside the cor-

Dear Str—I_ herewith submit my annual report for the 
scholastic year ending June 30, 1891. Our schools have made 
fair advancement for the past year. We had a very good Nor- 
mal Institute this summer. About forty teachers were en- 
rolled. The Institute-work proper lasted four days, then came 
the examination of applicants for certificates. 
We have visited nearly every school in the county, and have 
addressed each of them. Our schools are not all graded. We 
failed to get the new. school-law and forms for grading until 
some of the schools were commenced ; consequently, I failed to 
get some of the schools graded. We have several good men 
and women teaching, who are doing noble work and creating 
an enthusiasm for education wherever they teach, but we still 
have some who are not keeping pace with others who are more 
alive to the cause of education. The greatest hindering cause, 
however, is on account of the insufficiency of the school-fund, 
and, in some localities, the school-houses are not well adapted 
for the use of schools, and in some instances they are wholly 
unfit for use at all; but Lam proud to state that, with regard to. 
school-houses there is a decided improvement in every part of 
the county. Every thing considered, I feel proud to say we® 
have had a prosperous school-year, and the public school is 
growing more and more into favor every year. The school-

* Dear Str—Please to find inclosed my annual report of the 
schoel-work of Weakley County for the year ending June 
30, 1891. 
Some of our teachers have graded their schools, and in such 
localities I tind the attendance better, and consequently progress 
greater than last year. I am fully determined to make a strong 
effort to have enforced the law demanding our schools to be 
graded, and feel confident of the hearty co-operation of our 
Directors. 
The teachers are improving their schools; Directors are much 
more prompt to duty, more carefal of the law; parents are tak- 
ing greater interest. I am proud of a constant improvement 
all along the different departments. 
The County Association was somewhat neglected last spring, 
_ owing to circumstances over which I had no control; but again 
we are in working order, and a great, interest is manifesting. 
The Association has done a vast deal of good for the cause of 
edneation in our county by improving our teachers and calling 
the attention of Directors and people to the work. 
The State Normal did a great work for our teachers. Dr. 
Purinton enshrined himself in the hearts of our people. Prof. 
 
-P-A-G-E-267

Dear Str—I have the honor of submitting to you my first 
annual report of the schools of White County. I think my 
report is accurate. Our Directors responded promptly in al- 
most every particular. When one would not report promptly, 
I went and got the report myself. : 
‘While our schools are not all that they should be, they are 
far better than they were a few years ago. The school-interest” 
in this county is growing steadily each year, and is gaining a 
stronger hold on the affections of the people than ever before. 
‘While poor in money, we are strong in energy, and I believe no 
county in the State has, as a whole, a more enthusidstic corps 
of teachers than White. 
We held a two weeks’ summer Institute at Doyle College, 
beginning June 22. This Institute was well attended by all the 
White County teachers, and we had some with us from other 
counties. We enrolled 103 teachers at this meeting. 
We probably pursue a different plan in conducting our Insti- 
tute from most counties in the State. In the early spring, at
-P-A-G-E-268
ets ee 
  our monthly County Institute, we decide when and where we 
will hold our summer Institute, and appoint a committe on pro- 
- gramme, which selects teachers in our county to treat the vari- 
ous branches required to be taught in the public schools, and’ 
also others to deliver lectures on some subject relating to prac- 
tical school-work. f 
Almost every one who is honored with a place on the pro- 
gramme comes forward and responds to the very best of his 
__ ability. 
While this may not be the best way, we think it a better plan 
than to send off and get some theoretical teacher, and pay him 
about $200 to talk to us about some fine-spun theory which he 
nor no one else can ever practice. j 
At the close of the summer Institute, we held atwo days’ 
examination, which showed considerable improvement on the 
part of most of our teachers. We hold monthly County Insti- 
tutes during the entire year, which are well attended by all the 
progressive teachers. : 
We also have a Directors’ organization, which meets annually 
in the month of June. 
While our per capita is yet small, it is increasing regularly, 
being $1.75 this year, which is more than it has ever been be- 
fore. 
  Our greatest needs are more money and better houses. In 
some communities we still find dilapidated old buildings, that 
should have been torn down years ago. And these are the 
places where you still find the “ old fogy keeping school.” 
° 
I advise the Directors to build new houses with the public 
money, if the people will not build them themselves. 
We have erected five neat framed buildings this year, and 
will strive to continue this work till every community in the 
county has a neat, comfortable school-house. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
ie 
We have also been having too many schools. We have 
plead with the Directors to reduce the number, and have suc- 
ceeded in cutting them down from seveuty last year, to sixty- 
two this year. 
We have “ gone slow,’ as you advised us, on the secondary 
schools, because we have not sufficient funds to run our primary 
schools as long as they should be. There is not a teacher in 
America that can spread himself over every thing, from the 
chart to geometry; consequently, if we establish secondary 
schools, we must employ two teachers, and that cuts the term 
down one-half, which would make it so short that neither pri- 
mary nor secondary pupils could do any good. We have but 
one secondary school in the county. We have one other great 
drawback, irregular attendance, and we believe nothing short 
_of a “compulsory law” will remove the evil. We long to see the 
day come when every child in the grand old “ Volunteer State,” 
from the Smoky Mountains on the east to the Mississippi on 
the west, will be in school under the care of a competent in- 
ttuctor, for we believe Jas. Madison never uttered a greater 
truth than when he said: “A nation without an education is 
but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce, or both.” 
We have several good private schools which run ten months 
in the year, and are doing much toward raising the standard of 
education in our county. Doyle College, Dibrell Normal Insti- 
tute, Onward Seminary, Walling, Jett’s Institute, Findlay’ s In- 
stitute, Roger’s Chapel, River Hill Academy, Jones’ Seminary, 
and a host cr others too numerous to mention, ae in successful 
operation. 
We have visited all the schools in the county, except two; 
one of them was stopped for “fodder pulling,’ and the other 
was out before I could get there. In closing this report, permit 
me to return to you my sincere thanks-for kind instructions, 
which I tried to follow to the best of my ability.

Duar Str—My report for the year ending June 30, 1891, ac- 
companies this. I have endeavored to have it correct, hence 
the delay. Having been elected at the April term of the 
County Court, I have labored under some disadvantages in 
getting up this report, as I have had but little to do*with the 
schools of the county for the last scholastic year. * 
Good crops and plenty of money are as essential to good 
schools as to other interests. The failure in crops last year 
caused a depression in all branches of business, and the schools 
suffered in the same respect. 
It is highly gratifying to me to state to you that the County 
of Williamson affords an opportunity to every boy and girl of 
obtaining a good primary education. I um doing my best to 
get them to take advantage of the liberal offer. f

_ Hon. W. R. Garrurr, Slate Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
_ Dzar Str—Inclosed you will find my report. I have been 
_ forced to approximate a part of it, viz., the “Private School 
Report.” Ihave done every thing in my power to render it 
accurate. It is needless to say that I have worked hard in ob- 
taining the facts necessary. 
Our schools have been working under the graded system this 
fall. We have adopted the grading prepared by you as our 
‘standard. : ;

Linclose a report to me from my worthy predecessor, Prof. 
C. L. Hayes, which will show you how our school-work was 
outlined for the year, and which please file as a part of this 
report. 
Yours truly, 
H. R. Bircuett, 
Superintendent. 
> “Lupanon, July 21, 1891. 
“ Prof. H. R: Birchett, Superintendent-elect, ete. : 
“Duar Srr—In surrendering to you the office of Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction for Wilson County, pursuant to 
my resignation and your election on the 7th inst., I beg leave 
to tender a short report of the work as I have “begun it, to- 
gether with my best wishes for your success in carrying it for- 
ward. Permit me also to thank the public generally, and the 
Institute especially, for the unanimous support they have 
given me. 
“During my term of office, I have endeavored to benefit the 
schools of the county in every way possible, especially in the 
following: 
“1. By conducting the work of my office in a business-like 
way, arranging all papers and records according to a definite 
system. 
-“2,. By recommending teachers, solely for merit, to the posi- 
tions T believed they could fill with most credit to themselves 
and the county. 
“3. By endeavoring to make my certificates. true indices of 
the qualifications and ability of the holder, regardless of fear 
or favor. 
“4. By issuing a supplementary certificate in connection with 
the regular one, stating the number of days the holder was in 
attendance at the summer Institute, and also the interest taken 
- by him, in order that the live teachers might have something 
to show their, Directors, and that the Directors, too, might be 
protected from impositors. 
“5. By organizing a aE Association, which meets in
-P-A-G-E-272
te 
the court-house monthly, on the second Saturdays, at 10 a.m. 
sharp, for the discussion of live questions, such as the new 
school-law, the text-books we need, ete. The interest in this 
has grown rapidly. 
“6. By holding examinations in different parts of the county, 
for the accommodation of those inconvenient to Lebanon. 
“7, By making Saturday a regular office day, and advertis- 
ing it as such. 
“8. By making the Lebanon Democrat the official organ of 
communication for reaching the teachers and people. 
“9. By co-operating with teachers and Directors until a uni- 
form series of text-books has been adopted for use in the secon- 
dary schools to supplement the list already adopted for use in 
the primary schools. 
“10. By requiring all teachers to. have a reasonable knowledge 
of the newly-adopted primary study of history of Tennessee, 
instead of taking the mere average, in order that I might give 
an impetus to this subject, which I regard as of so much im- 
portance; also, by giving a course of instruction in the Insti- 
tute on this subject. d 
“11. By having a course of instruction given in the Institute . 
which was intended to pave the way for the graded course of* 
study which you will doubtless have adopted soon. 
“12. By holding a summer Institute which did not spend its 
time in discussing meaningless ‘ points,’ but did work, as Prof. 
Bowling said, which ‘the teachers could carry with them into 
their school-rooms.’ My success in this, however, was due very 
largely to the services of three of Tennessee’s best teachers, 
viz.: Prof. T. P. Brennan and Miss Maggie Nicholas, of Nash- 
ville, and Prof. F. M. Bowling, A.M., of Watertown. 
. A

: : 
“Tn conclusion, I beg leave to say that statistics for the last 
fifteen years show a remarkable growth of the school-system; 
still it is very imperfect, and is likely to remain so until the 
State takes the whole matter in charge and provides the means 
for its support and clothes its officials with more definite pow- 
ers; in a word, until it is centralized more.

“ You will find that our white teachers are above the average 
for the State, and that the colored teachers, owing to the in- 
fluence of the great schools of Nashville, are as good as you 
will tind anywhere in the South outside of the cities. 
“As the statistics are not all in, I turn over what I have 
gathered in their unfinished form. 
«“ Yours very truly, 
“Onupurne L. Hayes, 
“ Retiring Superintendent.” 
In addition to the annual reports above set forth, most of the 
County Superintendents, in accordance with law and the regu- 
lations thereunder, have prescribed regulations for grading the 
schools, for examination and promotion of pupils through the 
several grades for their respective counties, and have sent 
copies of the same to this office. In the majority of cases the 
County Superintendents, being provided with no fund for 
printing, have announced these regulations at teachers’ meet- 
ings and through the columns of the county papers. Some 
‘County Superintendents have had their regulations printed in 
circular or pamphlet form, which have been received at this 
office and filed as records, as follows:

AFTERNOON. 
2:00 to 2:10. Opening exercises. 
2:10 to 2:50. Primary methods. 
2:50 to 3:30. Practical teaching. 
3:30 to 4:00. Musical and calisthenic exercises. 
The sessions at night will be devoted to musical exercises and — 
addresses on educational or literary topics by distinguished 
speakers. 
Farmers’ aNd Directors’ Day. 
One day of the Institute will be set apart and designated 
as Farmers’ and Directors’ day. On this occasion it is hoped 
that the people will attend in a body during the entire day. 
Hon. Lb. G. Godwin, Commissioner of Agriculture, has made 
arrangements to be present, either in person or by representa- 
tive, for the purpose of discussing agricultural topics. 
A special programme will be announced, and the exercises 
will be devoted to the consideration of teaching agrieulture, 
and to the geology, the geography, the history, and ‘the educa- 
tional condition of Tennessee. The school-laws will be dis- 
cussed, and it is especially desired that every Director and 
school-officer will be present. 
TEACHING. 
The “selected lessons in mathematics’’ include specimen les- 
sons in arithmetic, algebra, and plane geometry, and are de- 
signed to illustrate methods of teaching that portion of mathe- 
matics embraced in the course of the public schools under the 
laws of Tennessee. 
The “ selected lessons in science” include specimen lessons in 
the branches of science embraced in the public school course, 
and are likewise designed to illustrate methods of teaching. 
Especial attention will be given to exemplify methods of 
teaching geography and history, which are, perhaps, more im- 
perfectly taught in the schools of the State than any other
-P-A-G-E-282
ea eyes 
branches of study. The arts of drawing maps and of molding 
in sand are easily acquired. While skill in their use comes only 
with practice, the teachers can obtain at the Institute such in- 
struction as will enable them to empler in their schools these 
valuable aids to their work. 
“Primary methods”? embrace specimen lessons in the methods 
of the primary grades. In these grades the highest skill of the 
teacher is needed, and an intimate knowledge of child-nature. 
“Professional teaching” will embrace the discussion of 
psychological and educational principles; the purpose and 
methods of institutes ; general principles of school supervision ; 
organization, management, and economy of schools; industrial 
and manual training; the Tennessee school-law, etc. 
Work. 
The work of a teachers’ institute is directed to the methods 
and principles of teaching, rather than to instruction in the 
subject-matter ef special branches of study. In the short space 
of one or two weeks it is impossible to do more than to supply 
the hint—the valuable hint, upon which the ingenuity and 
native intelligence of the teacher will lead him to improve. 
While much may be learned from the conductors, their 
instruction is by no means the only source of improvement. 
Teachers will gain much from each other by discussing among 
themselves the topics introduced by the conductors. They 
will gain still more by making the hints received at the Institute 
the hasis of a course of reading, investigation, and reflection. 
While the exercises of the morning and afternoon sessions are 
professional, and especially designed | for the teachers, yet the 
public is cordially invited to be present. It is believed that all 
school-officers, parents, and friends of education will find these 
professional exercises interesting and instructive. 
The people are parties to education. They should attend 
when the interests of their children are considered, and lend to 
the discussion of educational questions .the sunshine of the 
public presence.

I—INSTITUTES FOR WHITE TEACHERS. 
TuttaHoma InstIvTUTE. 
Hon. W. R. Garrert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dzar Str—I beg to report that the Institute at Tullahoma — 
was duly held at the dates appointed, June 8 to 19, inclusive. 
Mr. Rose, Mr. Lyon, Mr. Bailey, and I were present at all 
meetings, and Superintendent Livingston, of the public school, 
was also there, and rendered much service. I cannot speak too 
highly of his services and those of President Hoover, both of 
whom entered heartily into the work. 
The attendance at the opening session was twenty-five, and 
at the first afternoon session, forty; aftewards it varied from 
fifty to one hundred and twenty during the day sessions. There 
were six lectures delivered at the night sessions, one by your- 
self, and the others respectively by myself, Mr. Rose, Mr. 
Bailey, Mr. Lyon, and Dr. J. B. Cowan, of Tullahoma; there was 
also a musical and elocutionary entertainment, given under the 
direction of Prof. Bailey. The night meetings were largely at- 
tended, and appeared to gratify and please the people. 
The gentlemen appointed to assist me did their full duty, 
were more than competent to do so, and won golden opinions 
from the teachers and the people who were so fortunate as to 
hear them. I think the Institute won its way into the admira- 
tion of the people, and it closed its sessions amidst the heartiest 
plaudits of praise and congratulation. It was a success and did 
good. ‘ Very respectfully, f 
A.D. Wuarton,

JENTREVILLE INSTITUTE. 
Hon. W. R. Garret, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srtr—The State Teachers’ Institute, held here this 
week, closed to-day after a most successful session. The at- 
tendance at the opening session—the morning of the 22d inst. 
—was thirty-six, in the afternoon of that day, seventy-two, a 
majority at both sessions being teachers. There have been 
present at every meeting since from eighty to one hundred and 
thirty persons, a majority always being teachers. I am reliably 
informed that nearly every teacher in Hickman County has been 
present. There were three public meetings held at night, 
one of which was a musical and literary entertainment. The 
other two were addressed by Prof. Wade, of Dickson, and 
myself. 
The tone and spirit of the meeting have been fine all the way 
through, and I have been. ably assisted by Prof. Weber, Miss 
Nance, County Superintendent Jarratt, and Secretary Keyes. 
On yesterday, 25th inst., a mass-meeting was held at the 
court-house, addressed by Major T. J. Ogilvie and a farmers’ 
institute was organized, consisting of thirty-two members. 
Much interest was manifested. In the afternoon the school-law 
was discussed most spiritedly for some two hours or more. 
Iam more than pleased with the outcome of the meeting 
held at this place. Assurances are abundant on every hand as 
to the good that has been accomplished. 
Very respectfully, 
A. D. Wuarton, 
Conductor.

Cotumpia Institute. 
Hon. W. R. Garret, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Duar Sir—The State Teachers’ Institute, commencing on the 
29th inst., has just come to a close this day. The opening 
session was with an attendance of twenty-five, and this increased 
with the succeeding sessions until it numbered some eighty 
persons, about two-thirds of whom were teachers. Prof. T. B. 
Kelley very cheerfully and most ably assisted Mr. Weber and 
myself in carrying out the programme, every part of which was 
presented from time to time to the public. I think the Institute 
won upon the good opinion of the people as its sessions con- 
tinued. Coanty Superintendent Miller presided over the 
meetings. 
The Institute, I believe, did much good. 
Very respectfully, 
A. D. Wiarton, 
Conductor. 
Institutes aT SPRINGFIELD AND COOKEVILLE. 
Hoy. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Duar Str--We, the undersigned, appointed by you to con- 
duet State and Peabody Institutes during the summer of 1891, 
do most respectfully submit the following as a report of the 
work done under our supervision. 
' In obedience to your instructions, we reported at Springfield, 
June 22, and found Supt. Ruffin just closing a county institute, 
which had been in session for two weeks. We were glad to 
find the Superintendent, with quite a host. of good teachers, 
ready to engage in the State work, and willing to assist in_
-P-A-G-E-289
—14— G 
every way possible to make the meeting not only profitable to 
the teachers, but entertaining and beneficial to the people. 
In the very beginning we were determined not only to fol- 
low your programme strictly, but to resolve the Institute into 
a first-class school as far as possible, and see that the works was 
thoroughly illustrated on the blackboard. The curriculum of 
both the primary and secondary schools, as preseribed by the 
State law, was taken up and handled by apt and experienced 
teachers. We had a good attendance from the citizens during 
the day, and at our night sessions were greeted with large 
audiences. 
During the Institute a farmers’ and Directors’ meeting was 
held. Quite an assemblage was present, and was addressed by 
Congressman Washington and Major Ogilvie. Both of these 
gentlemen were especially strong and forcible in discussing the 
near and true relationship existing between the educational and 
agricultural interests. A mass-meeting was called for Thurs- 
day night to awaken, if possible, an interest in the building up 
of a system of graded schools. This was largely attended. 
Strong speeches by representative men were made, and we have 
since been assured that good seed has fallen in good ground. 
Among the many good workers who were with us, we take 
pleasure in thanking Profs, Corkran, Hughey, Borthic, Wilson, 
West, Roach, and the efficient Secretary, M. E. Moore, together 
with Misses Johnson and Carlisle, for their good work and 
valuable assistance. We would also remember in kindness the 
ministers of the various churches, who lent us their aid and in- 
fluence in the work. More than sixty teachers were present, 
and five counties were represented. 
COOKEVILLE. 
* Our second Institute was held at Cookeville, a live and 
picturesque village of Putnam County, at the terminus of the 
Nashville & Knoxville Railroad. This county is blessed with a 
wide-awake, conscientious, and thorough-going Superintendent, 
W. A. Carr, who, assisted by such men as Jere Whitson, W.
-P-A-G-E-290
    SS he 
_ W. Smith and Prof. Yeargen, knew not how to fail in any 
laudable undertaking. On our arrival We were extended a 
joyous welcome, both by teachers and citizens. Homes were 
provided for all and every comfort supplied. A grand success 
was assured from the very beginning. The Washington 
Academy, a large and roomy building, was crowded every day. 
There were in attendance one hundred and two teachers, and 
eight counties represented. 
' Here we endeavored, as usual, to make the Institute typical 
of a first-class school-room. Our work was especially class- 
work, and every thing demonstrated upon the ‘board. We cer- 
tainly were very fortunate in having quite a sufficiency of the 
very best material of institute workers. History by topical 
methods, geography by map-drawing and sand-molding, 
mathematics (primary and advanced) illustrated upon the 
board, geology, physiology, elements of agriculture, ete., and, in 
truth, the entire curriculum of the primary and secondary 
schools were handled, we are glad to say, by men and women 
of large experience and splendid attainments. Pedagogics was 
fully discussed day after day by C. 8. Douglass, as also method 
of conducting classes in writing, opening and closing school, 
calling and dismissing classes of the various recitations. Every 
thing moved in strict order and perfect time. 
Theré seemed to exist a commendable rivalry among the in- 
structors, all striving most methodically and most professionally 
to discharge the duties assigned them; this enthusiasm ex- 
tended not only throughout the long list of teachers, but citi- 
zens alike became deeply interested in the development of the 
subjects brought before the Institute. 
In the discussion of school management a very doubtful 
question arose, viz.: as to the authority of the teacher to ad- 
minister corporal punishment, and whether or not ‘the pupil 
was under the jurisdiction of the teacher en route to and from 
school. For the benefit of the Institute, we invited General 
Morgan, a lawyer of State reputation, and Mr. Puckett, a young 
lawyer of much promise, to appear before the Institute and read 
and discuss the law upon this very much disputed question. 
12 s. Pp. 1.—Ap. D. 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
Lil ee 
Their decision, rendered in cogent‘and practical lunguage, was: 
“That the teacher could inflict reasonable corporal punishment, 
and that the authority of the teacher over the pupil to and from 
school was co-equal with that of parent.” This decision met 
with the hearty approval of the Institute. 
Our exercises were interspersed with splendid musie by the 
teachers; and a class of calisthenics was taught by Miss 
Phillips and Prof. Lyon during the meeting. 
Every night during the week a literary feast was given the 
people, in the shape of recitations, declamations, addresses upon 
appropriate literary topics, and vocal and instrumental music. 
And right here we would remember, in gratefulness, General 
Morgan, Mr. McClain, Profs. Thomson, Yeargan, Lyon, Misses 
Freeze, Morgan, Mrs. Smith, and others, who did so much to 
make these entertainments pleasant and profitable. 
One day was devoted to’the organization of a Farmers’ Insti- 
tute and a meeting of the School Directors. This was certainly 
a memorable day, and, from the interest manifested by the peo- 
ple, will have its telling effects. The farmers were addressed 
by Major Ogilvie, Assistant Commissioner of Agriculture, in 
a strong and masterly speech, and. C..S. Douglass followed in a 
speech to the Directors, upon the relation of Director, teacher, 
and parent. Nearly every district in the county was well rep- 
resented. f 
Among the many accommodating and competent workers, we 
would thank most sincerely Profs. Yeargan, Thompson, Gore, 
Boone, Upton, Davis, [Juff, Misses Phillips, Quarles, and oth- 
ers, for the good work done in the Institute. The very compe- 
tent secretary, W. W. Smith, deserves the kind remembrance 
of every one present, and the efficient and polite Superintend- 
ent will not soon be forgotten. 
With this Institute our work closed, and we feel it our duty 
to say that the State Superintendent was most fortunate in the 
selection of suitable points for these meetings, and that much 
good has been done. We will be pardoned for suggesting that 
’

hereafter the Institute should continue at least, two weeks, and 
then be followed by a County Institute of one week; that 
théy should be held upon the frontier locations, as our larger 
towns and cities do not enjoy or need them. We are very 
grateful to Captain Garrett for his valuable suggestions and 
wise counsel given us when we entered the work, and trust that 
we have not been treacherous to the high trust commiited to our 
care, or forgetful of the important wotk assigned us.

Dear Str—Onr Institute at Huntsville, Scott County, Tenn., 
was considered by all a splendid success. The attendance in- 
creased till the close. The last week we had a very large at- 
tendance of teachers, some few from adjoining counties. The 
attendance of patrons and school-boards was not as large as 
was desired, but it was reasonably good through’ the entire ses- 
sion of two weeks. Our work was strictly professional 
’ throughout, and we managed very successfully to create an en- 
_ thusiastic interest in all, both teacher and patron. That all 
considered themselves benefited was obvious, as they were pro- 
fuse in their expressions of gratitude. 
Scott County has reasonably good schools, but itis our opinion, 
and the unanimous verdict of all concerned, that our work has 
given an impetus to the schools that will last long and do much 
good. 
We very gratefully acknowledge the valuable assistance of 
Prof. Clemens, Rev. Mr. Lord, Miss Ryal, the worthy County 
Superintendent, Prof. Cross, and others. :

Institutes at Kineston, Danpripce, Bunton, AND RoGERSVILLE. 
Hon. W. R. Garrert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
’ Dear Srr—I have the honor to report the following in re- 
gard to my work in the Peabody State Institutes of Tennessee 
during the summer of 1891. 
In obedience to your instructions, I held Institutes of one 
week each at Kingston, Dandridge, Benton, and Rogersville. I 
was very ably assisted in this work by Miss Julia A. Doak, of 
the Peabody Normal College, at Nashville. Prof. W. M. Gray- — 
bill, of Rogersville Synodical Female College, also rendered ef- 
ficient service as instructor in the Rogersville Institute. At 
each of the three places first named, a County Institute of one 
week was held immediately following the State Institute. At 
the last-named place (Rogersville), a County Institute of one 
week preceded the State Institute. In accordance with your - 
arrangement, Thursday was taken as “ Farmer’s Day” in all the 
Institutes, and given up to the discussion of agricultural topics. 
It may be well also to state that, in consequence of the new law 
establishing secondary schools, the method of teaching several 
higher branches was discussed in all the Institutes. 
Our first Institute was opened at Kingston, on June 22. It 
had been well worked up by the County Superintendent, Miss 
Lucy Smith. The morning session was held in Rittenhouse 
Academy, but, owing to a lack of sufficient room, all subse- 
quent meetings took place at the Methodist Episcopal Church, 
South. Prof. Frank M. Smith, principal of Teachers’ Depart-  
-P-A-G-E-294
  SG eee 
ment at University of Tennessee, and ex-Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, presided at the first sessions, aud gave im-, 
portant talks on the public school law and the method of licens- . 
ing teachers. Mr. John H. Fritts acted as secretary. We 
were assisted at this place by Prof. Wilford Caulkins, of Chat- 
tanooga, who lectured on “ Numbers;” Miss Jessie House, of 
Harriman, on “ Kindergarten Culture;” and Principal 8. D. 
Lucas, of Rockwood, on ‘Physiology and Hygiene.” ‘Presi- 
dent John Dickey, of Roane College, and Rev. 8S. W. Gage, of 
Rockwood, spoke on “Moral Training.” <A public meeting 
was held on Wednesday evening, at which State Superintendent 
W. R. Garrett addressed the citizens of Kingston on the sub- 
ject of “Town Graded Schools,” the object being to secure the 
establishment of such schools in the place. Superintendent W. 
D. McFarland, of the Harriman schools, gave a lecture on 
“Natural Science,” on Thursday, which was ‘Farmers’ Day.” 
Addresses were also delivered by Messrs. Paul F. Kefauver and 
'R. L. Watts, of the University of Tennessee—the former on 
“ Agriculture,’ and the latter on “ Horticulture.” About thirty 
farmers were present. Four County Superintendents were 
present during the Institute. Six Directors werein attendance. 
The teachers numbered seventy-seven and the visitors eighty- 
four. The number of principal lectures delivered was twenty- 
three. 
DANDRIDGE. 
The next Institute was held at Dand:idge, beginning June 
29. County Superintendent D. C. Hill presided, and H. M. 
Rankin acted as secretary. Mr..M. N. Garrett assisted us with 
a lecture on “ Music in the Public Schools.” Mr. H. M. Rankin 
spoke on “Orthography,” and Mr. Jones M. Hicks on “ Num- 
bers.” ' Principal M. B. Aston, of Maury Academy, lectured at 
various times on “ Physics,’ “History of Tennessee,” and 
“Physiology and Hygiene.” Miss Sue Livingston talked on 
“Calisthenics,” and gave a practical demonstration. Rev. M. 
H. Monroe led on “Orthography ” and “ English Grammar,” 
and Mr. Gammon on “Penmanship.” Mr. R. L. Watts, of the 
State University, lectured, on“ Farmer’s Day,” on “ Horticulture 
in East Tennessee for Pleasure and Profit.” The farmers were
-P-A-G-E-295
  also addressed by Mr. W. 8. Smith, Assistant Commissioner of 
Agriculture, on “ General Farming.” At the close of his address, 
Mr. Smith organized an Institute for permanent work. - About 
seventy-five farmers were present. Three evenings were occu- 
pied by public lectures. Mrs. A. L. Billheimer spoke on “ Mis- 
sionary Life in Africa.” Rev. Carter Helm Jones, of Knoxville, 
delivered a very able lecture on “Education.” J.C. Park, of 
Greeneville, spoke on “Matters in General.” The number of 
teachers present at this Institute was fifty-two; the number of | 
visitors, 316. , 
‘ BENTON. 
We opened the Institute at Benton July 20, with County | 
Superintendent A. H. Matlock presiding, and J. C. Rymer 
secretary. Principal J. C. Woods, of Benton High School, 
Prof. Wilford Caulkins, of Chattanooga, Prof.'T. L. Bryan, of 
Sweetwater, Mr. W. G. Massey, of Ducktown, Principal M. R. 
M. Burk, of Charleston High School, J. W. Blankenship, of 
Arkansas, L. 8. London, of the Knoxville schools, and J. V. 
Rymer, of Felzerton, rendered valuable assistance. ‘ Farmers’ 
Day” at Benton was quite a success. Assistant Commissioner 
of Agriculture W. 8. Smith spoke on “ The Relation of Farmer 
and Teacher.” He then organized a farmers’ institute for fut- 
ure work. Mr. Paul F. Kefauver, of, the State University, Dr. 
Copeland, and ex-Senator Fout spoke on agricultural subjects. 
On Tuesday evening T. L. Bryan, editor of “ The Heud-light,” 
delivered a popular lecture on ‘Home Training.” ‘The number 
of teachers at this Institute was forty ; the number of farmers, 
120; and the number of visitors, 150. 
ROGERSVILLE. 
The Institute at Rogersville convened July 27, and was or- 
ganized with Prof. W. M. Graybill in the chair and Miss Lida 
A. Wright secretary. Prof. Graybill was also one of the regular 
instructors. ‘Farmers’ Day” was well attended. About 
seventy-five farmers were present. Paul F. Kefauver and R. 
L. Watts, of the State University, spoke on agricultural sub- 
jects during the morning. State Superintendent Garrett also
-P-A-G-E-296
: —21— 
lectured on United States history. In the afternoon, W. L. 
Nesbit, late conductor of farmers’ institutes in Pennsylvania, 
lectured on “The Restoration of Wornont Soils.” W.S. Smith, 
Assistant Commissioner of Agriculture, lectured on. “ General 
Farming,” and organized a farmers’ institute. Hon. D. G. 
Godwin, State Commissioner of Agriculture, then addressed 
the meeting. “ Farmers’ Day” closed with a well-prepared 
paper by Col. James W. Rogan. A popular address was de- 
livered on Thursday evening by Hon. W. R. Garrett, State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, on “ History, and Meth- 
ods of Teaching it to Students.” About seventy teachers were 
present during the week. The visitors were estimated at 150. 
In all these Institutes our main effort was to teach the teach- 
ers how to do better work in their schools. They were to more 
carefully adjust their instruction to the mental capacity of their 
pupils. The necessity of the teacher’s understanding fully the 
laws of intellectual development was insisted upon. Miss Doak 
dwelt more especially on the teaching of history, geography, 
and mathematics, while I directed my efforts mainly towards 
primary methods and school management. Miss Douk’s most 
excellent work in sand-moulding deserves special commenda- 
tion. Her work was everywhere received with much favor. 
At all points we were met most cordially by local educators 
and citizens, to whom we are greatly indebted. While the at- 
tendance was generally good, we recognize that it might have 
been much better had you not wisely located the Institutes in 
places where there was the greater need. While much remains 
, to be done, we all cannot but recognize the great good effected 
by the Institutes of previous years. A knowledge of better 
methods is being diffused through all the schools. Every county 
now has its Institute. The work is becoming almost exclu- 
sively professional in character. The great point now is to send 
out the very best conductors and trained leaders for the county 
Institutes.

T. C. Karns, 
State Institute Conductor.

Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Institutes held at this place under your direction, which work 
closed this day. 
In the Institute for white teachers were enrolled :

         Average attendance of teachers. - 66 
Average attendance of visitors (about)... 
    Total average attendance (about).. 
In the Institute for colored teachers there were enrolled 54 
teachers ; average attendance, 43. The secretary of this Insti- 
tute failed to distinguish between male and female, and to keep 
_ any record of school-officers and visitors. The average attend- 
ance of this last class I judge to have been about eight. 
The white Institute held three evening sessions—one ad- 
dressed by the State Superintendent, one by Prof. Thomas, one 
by the conductor and others. The attendance ut the first was, I 
should think, 125; at the second, 60; at the third, 200. 
The second day of the Institute was devoted to the farmers, 
and denominated “ Farmers’ Day.” Addresses in the forenoon 
were made by Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of 
Schools, and the Rev. Mr. Sullivan, of Covington. In the 
afternoon a Farmers’ Institute was organized by Dr. Godwin, 
State Commissioner of Agriculture, and a short address to the 
farmers was made by the conductor of the Institute. The at- 
tendance of farmers was small, but the interest awakened seemed 
to be very considerable.
-P-A-G-E-298

Valuable assistance in the conduct of the Institute was ren- 
dered by Prof. Holmes, Capt. Hall, Rev. Mr. Sullivan, and Judge 
Byars, of Covington, by Prof. Williams and Mrs. Thomas, of 
Bolton College, and especially by Prof. W. 8. Jones and Prof. — 
Williams, of Memphis, both of whom spent a full day with us, 
and gave exceptionally able lectures—Prof. Jones upon botany 
and mathematics, and Prof. Williams upon English pronuncia- 
tion. 
My regular assistants in conducting the Institute were Prof. 
T. P. Thomas and Prof. Brown, of Vanderbilt University. It 
is a great pleasure to me to be able to say that their work was 
of a rare order of excellence, and that they devoted themselves 
with untiring energy to the work of the Institute. 
To J. A. Cotten, Esq., County Superintendent of Schools, 
too much praise cannot be given for the wisdom and enterprise 
with which he made every arrangement for the accommodation 
and successful work of the Institutes, and for the dignity and 
ability with which he presided over that one for the instruction 
of the white teachers. He is one of the best officers of his 
class whom it has been my privilege to meet, and Tipton County 
is signally fortunate in his appointment to his office. 
Speaking generally, I think I may venture to say that the 
Institutes were successful in their work, and that they will not 
seriously suffer by comparison with even the excellent Institutes 
held in this county in the last few years. 
Yours very truly, 
A. L. Purinton, 
Conductor.

My assistant, Mr. R. E. Crockett, of Union City, Tenn., 
proved himself’ a workman of a high order, and I have nothing 
but words of warmest praise for his style of institute lecturing. 
Mrs. Evans, the Superintendent of this county, impressed me 
as a most intelligent and excellent officer. Unfortunately, the 
Institute was deprived of her presence during about one-half 
of its session, owing to the dangerous illness of her husband. 
Special mention ought to be made of the assistance given 
by Professor Williams, of Martin. He arranged every: local 
detail in a manner which left nothing to be desired. 
Two evening sessions of the Institute were held, one on 
Monday, addressed by Professor Crockett, attendance about 
125; and one on Wednesday, addressed by the conductor, 
attendance about 200. 
The other evenings of the week were so occupied by local 
meetings of special interest that it was thought unwise to 
attempt any meetings upon our part. 
Thursday was “ Farmers’ Day,” and in the afternoon a number 
of farmers were present. The lectures of that afternoon were 
specially directed to scientific and agricultural topics, and to
-P-A-G-E-300
Ngai 
subjects involving a discussion of the mutual relatious of the 
schools and the farming popniation. 
In general, I think I may safely say that the Institute ac- 
complished some work of real value, and that it was considered 
quite successful by those who attended it, and by the com- 
munity at large. ' 
Yours truly, ‘ 
A. L. Purinton, 
Conductor. 
InsvitutEs AT Mempuis, BrownsviLun, Purpy, aNp SAVANNAH. 
Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—By your appointment I conducted four State 
Institutes during the month of June, one at Memphis and one 
at each of the following places: Brownsville, Purdy, and 
Savannah. These Institutes were each continued one week. 
At Memphis I was associated with Prof. A. L. Purinton, of 
the Peabody Normal College, who had also been appointed by 
the State Superintendent. Miss Nellie O'Donnell, the efficient 
County Superintendent of Shelby, had every thing in perfect 
readiness for the work when we reached the city, and to her 
untiring energy and active co-operation is due much of the 
success which was attained. We were quite fortunate at Mem- 
phis in securing the services of Professor MeLeary, of Minne- 
sota, who is Institute Conductor for that State. His lectures 
were interesting and highly mstructive, All were delighted 
with him. ! 
Professor Williams, of Bolton College, was also with us dur- | 
ing the week, and rendered good service. It is needless to say 
that the work of Professor Purinton was of a high order, and 
gave full satis‘action. Prof. Wharton 8. Jones, of Memphis,
-P-A-G-E-301
age 
was present during the week, and did much work. There were 
in regular attendance about one hundred teachers. 
BROWNSVILLE. 
At Brownsville, Profs.’ M. Rose, of Bells, and W. 8. Jones, 
of Memphis, were my associates on the part of the State. The 
work of both these gentlemen was greatly appreciated by the 
teachers attending. Professor Tanner, County Superintendent 
of Haywood, and Professor Crowder, of Brownsville, and 
others took an active part in the work, and rendered much 
service. The attendance was not so large as in Memphis, but 
the interest was very encouraging. 
Professor Tanner, the County Superintendent, in his report 
to me says: 
“Many of our best citizens, who heretofore have been in- 
different’ and regarded as opposed to public schools, are now 
among the most enthusiastic advocates. I think a new era has 
dawned in school-interest in our county, and we are all more 
hopeful of success than ever before. The people are beginning 
to discuss it earnestly, and are already demanding an increase 
of tax for school-purposes.” { 
PURDY. 
At Purdy we found a large number of teachers, over one 
-hundred, in anxious waiting for the organization of the State 
Institute. Prof. M. R. Abernathy had just closed a County In- 
stitute of three weeks’ duration, and, as might have been ex- 
pected under the management of this most excellent school- of- 
ficer, it had proven a decided success, and all conditions were 
therefore most favorable for us. Prof. P. il. Manning, of 
Montgomery Bell Academy, under your appointment, was as- 
sociated with me at this Institute, as he also was the next week, 
at Savannah, and at both places his work was highly com- 
mended. As an evidence of the success which attended the 
Institute at Purdy, I submit the following special report of 
Superintendent Abernathy :
-P-A-G-E-302

‘“« Purpy, Tenn., Aug. 17, 1891. 
“ Hon. Thos. H. Paine, Savannah, Tenn.: 
“My Dear Srr—In reply to your request for a special report 
from me of the State Normal Institute held here in June, I am “ 
pleased to say that it was the most satisfactory and profitable 
educational meeting ever held in the county. I had inaugu- 
rated a month’s Institute, beginning the first Monday in June, 
and this had been in progress three week before the State Nor- 
mal began. The effect of the work done was to prepare the 
teachers for a proper appreciation of the splendid work pre- 
sented by the specialists during State Normal week. The at- 
tendance was full, the enrollment being one hundred and seven. 
The special features of the Institute, such as vocal music, es- 
says, recitations, and evening lectures, were hardly susceptible 
of adverse criticism. 
“To State Superintendent W. R. Garrett, P. H. Manning, 
and yourself personally, for your most excellent management 
of the Institute, I tender the grateful acknowledgments of the 
teachers of McNairy County. 
“Very respectfully, 
“M.R. ABERNATHY, 
“ County Superintendent.” 
SAVANNAH. 
We were assisted at Savannah by Prof. J. A. Hanna and 
Prof. Cox. These gentlemen contributed much to the success 
of the Institute, while Miss Bessie Moore, the County Superin- 
tendent was ever ready and anxious to aid us. The attendance 
here was large, and the interest good, both with the teachers 
and citizens of the town. A prominent feature of all these In- 
stitutes was the work of Farmers’ Day. At Brownsville, Purdy, 
and Savannah, Assistant Commissioner of Agriculture, Mr. 
Flat, was with us, and at each place organized a Farmers’ In- 
stitute. On these days we undertook to make our work appro- 
priate to the occasion, and the farmers present seemed to enjoy 
it very much. 
I desire to say that at all these Institutes I was much grati-
-P-A-G-E-303
og. 
fied at the success which attended them, and Iam quite sure 
the local authorities of each will bear me out in the statement 
that much good was accomplished. Your plan of connecting 
a County Institute with those held by you is a most excellent 
one. It is almost equivalent to a State Institute for double the 
time they are held, because the work of the State is taken up” 
by the county where the former leaves off, and is carried on for 
another week on very much the same plan. This was done at 
each place we visited, except at Savannah, where, on account 
of the State Teachers’ Association being in session the next 
week, and the teachers desiring to attend, the County Institute 
was postponed until after the return of the county teachers from 
Lookout Mountain, where the State Association was held, but 
it has since been held, and [ am advised by the County Super- 
intendent that it was quite interesting. 
It is proper that I should add that your presence with us at 
Memphis and Brownsville; and the excellent and well-timed 
address you made at each place, tended largely to enhance the 
interest of the Institutes, and caused us the more to regret that 
you could not be with us at Purdy and Savannah. 
I am unwilling to close this report without acknowledging 
the active co-operation of the citizens at the various places 
where these Institutes were held, and I desire to tender thanks 
to Hon. Dorsy O. Thomas, of Brownsville, and Hon. D. W. 
Herring, of Purdy, for the excellent address of Mr. Thomas at 
Brownsville, and Mr. Herring at Purdy. 
For further information in regard to our work, you are re- 
ferred to the reports of the County Superintendents where 
these Institutes were held. In all this work, the friendly sug- 
gestions you made and the invaluable aid of your counsel and” 
encouragement are gratefully acknowledged. 
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, 
: Tuomas H. Patne,

Hon. W. R. Garner, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
‘Duar Str—In accordance with your directions, a State In- 
_stitute was held at Franklin, Williamson County, Tenn., 
December 28-31, inclusive. I was assisted in its conduct by 
Messrs. Bailey, Weber, Buchanan, and Keyes. County Super- 
intendent Miller, as president of the Institute, did all in his 
power to render it asuccess. Superintendent H. B. Wallace, of 
the Franklin public schools, provided a place of meeting, and 
encouraged us by his interest and presence. 
The asual Institute topics were discussed, morning and after- 
noon, during the four days’ session, and, I trust, to the profit of 
those in attendance. While the number of those present was not _ 
as large as hoped for, yet, considering it was during the holiday 
season the sessions were held, with both teachers and pupils more 
inclined to enjoy the vacation rest than to work, on the whole 
the meeting may be regarded as a success, the attendance at 
several of the sessions numbering between sixty and eighty. 
On the whole, however, I do not think it advantageous to 
hold Institutes during the Christmas festivities. 
I feel greatly indebted to the gentlemen associated with me 
for their active interest and zeal’ in the conduct of the Institute ; 
and we are all under obligation.to yourself, sir, for your pres- 
ence and address at the commencement of our sessions. 
I remain, with respect, your obedient servant,

_ Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—The Joint Teachers’ Institute of the counties ot 
J] Hawkins, Hamblen, Cocke, and Greene was held at Rogersville
-P-A-G-E-305
— 30 — 
Junction, Tenn., Friday and Saturday, October 23 and 24, 1891, 
with the following officers: Frank M. Smith, Chairman; E. M. 
Wright, J. R. Cox, W. F. Dykes, D. W. Boyer, Executive 
Committee. 
This Institute has been in existence for several years, and has 
held annual meetings in ‘the month of November. It has here- 
tofore been a voluntary association, and has been conducted 
under the control of an Executive Committee composed of the 
Superintendents of the four counties above named. It has be- 
come very popular in upper East Tennessee, and has been well 
attended, not only by the teachers of the counties interested, 
but has also attracted visitors from other portions of the State. 
Its growing popularity and usefulness led the Executive Com- 
mittee to make application to the State Superintendent to place 
it on the permanent footing of aregular State Institute, to be held 
during the fall of the year, retaining its name and organization 
and conforming to all requirements of a State Institute. 
This application was favorably considered by the State Su- 
perintendent. The chairman was appointed conductor, and 
the members of the Executive Committee assistant conductors 
of the State Institute, except that in the absence of Superin- 
tendent Boyer, of Cocke County, Prof. W. M. Cary was tem- 
porarily appointed in his place... * 
The meeting of the Institute for the present year was emi- 
nently useful and successful. The attendance numbered 117, of 
which about 100 were teachers. For more exact statistics I 
refer you to the report of the Secretary, which will be duly 
forwarded to your office. 
The following programme, which was issued in circular form 
and distributed in advance of the meeting, was carried out, ex- 
cept in a few particulars which you will tind noted in the secre- 
tary’s report:

Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : i 
Dear Srr—In accordance with your request, we submit the 
following summary of the Colored Teachers’ State Normal just 
closed. * 
The Normal opened Monday, June 22, at the public hall of 
the court-house in Knoxville, Tenn., with Prof J. C. Ford, 
County Superintendent of Public Schools, assisted by J. 8. 
Cobb, as conductor, and B. J. Campbell, assistant conductor, 
and thirty-five teachers in attendance, which reached fifty be- 
fore the close. 
The printed programmes furnished by you were used. as a 
basis, with such slight modifications as the circumstances seemed 
to demand and justify. 
It is believed by all in attendance that much real good will 
be the immediate result of the session just closed. The work - 
was satisfactory. Forty certificates were issued, of which 
twenty-five were first-grade. Twelve counties were repre- 
sented. 
Regretting your absence, we thank you for the interest man- 
ifested. With hopes for the continued progress of the cause of 
education, we remain 
‘Most truly yours, 
Josuua 8. Cobs, 
Conductor,

Institute at CHATTANOOGA. 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: i 
Dear Str—I have the honor herewith to submit to you a re- 
port of the Colored State Normal Institute, held at Chatta- 
nooga, Hamilton County, Tenn., June 1-10, 1891. 
The attendance of teachers was unusually large. More than 
seventy teachers were enrolled during the session. Several 
lectures were delivered. The day meetings were largely at- 
tended. The work of the Institute was thorough, and instruc- 
tion was given in all of the branches taught in the public 
schools of Tennessee, and the general methods and principles 
of education. In this work, I had the able assistance of Hon. 
H. D. Huffaker, Prof. G. A. Newman, Rey. E. J. Carter, Hon. 
H. N, Willis, Rev. J. E. Smith, and Rey. 8. J. Harris. 
The great success which attended the Institute was due ina 
very great measure to the efforts of the County Superintendent, 
in having a well-arranged programme. It is a pleasure again 
to be able to state that everywhere the white ministers and 
teachers gave warm encouragement to the work. 
While the number of teachers who attended the Institute was 
small, compared with the whole number of teachers in the 
State, yet I think the “little leaven” has been thrown into the 
whole body of teachers of that section, and the public generally 
has received new life in educational matters. 
Respectfully, 
G. W. Perkins, 
oe Conductor.

INSTITUTES AT LEWISBURG AND CLARKSVILLE. 
Hon. W. KR. Garret, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. - 
Dwar Str—In compliance with your instructions, we began 
the work of the State Institute for colored teachers on Monday, 
June 15. 
LEWISBURG, 
Mr. D. M. Collins, County Superintendent, gave us great as- 
sistance and encouragement, and aided all in his power to make 
the Institute a success. 
We assisted all we could in the County Institute. In the ses- 
sions of the day we devoted all of our time in going over the 
public school studies and in discussing the best methods of 
teaching, making primary methods a specialty. 
We have had teachers from Nashville, Pulaski, Columbia, 
Shelbyville, Knoxville, and from all the adjacent counties. 
Our educational meetings have numbered from one hundred 
to one hundred and seventy-five. Our enrollment of teachers 
is fifty odd. Weare glad to report that Teachers’ Normal In- 
stitutes are growing more and more in favor with the people. 
We found a large majority of the teachers laboring to tit them- 
*selves to do better work in the school-room. We feel that these 
Institutes are strong incentives to all the teachers to better fit 
themselves to do more thorough work. 
CLARKSVILLE. 
On Monday morning, June 29, at nine a.M. we arrived in 
Clarksville, and found the Superintendent of Montgomery 
County, Mr. P. L. Harned, and a good many teachers, awaiting 
our arrival. We began the work of the Institute, and to our 
surprise we were informed that there had never been a Colored 
Institute in the county prior to this, either State or county. 
We found the teachers earnest, alive, and eager to take hold of 
the methods which we presented. The assistance rendered us

by the County Superintendent, Mr. P. L. Harned, was invalua- 
ble, for he was with us in person, and presided as chairman of 
the méeting. ; 
The Institute numbered more than forty teachers. Our daily 
attendance was about thirty-nine. These came from the sur- 
rounding counties and Kentucky. 
At night we had educational meetings, the last of which was 
held in the court-house. At all of these meetings we lectured 
on educational subjects. 
The people expressed themselves as pleased and encouraged 
to do more for education than heretofore. 
Feeling that we have done a little good for the cause of pop- 
ular education, we have the honor to subscribe ourselves,

Dear Strr—In accordance with your instructions, I hereby 
respectfully submit the following brief report of the State Nor- 
mal Institute for colored teachers, held at this place from June 
22 to July 4, inclusive. 
The Institute was held in the new public school building, the 
use of which was kindly tendered us by the city Board of Edu- 
cation. The number of teachers enrolled was ninety-eight, rep- 
resenting the counties of Madison, Henderson, Hardenian, 
_ Chester, and Gibson. Mr. D. F. Rivers, the associate conduc-

ea." Seal 
tor, and myself, endeavored to carry out your instructions 
fully as to the manner of conducting the Institute, and the gen- 
eral verdict is that it was the most pleasant and profitable meet- 
ing of the kind ever held here. All seemed to enter upon the 
work with enthusiasm, and the interest continued unabated 
throughout the two weeks. 
In addition to the work done by the conductors, valuable in- 
struction was given in orthography by Mr. N. C. Cleaves, of 
Lane Institute; in primary methods, by Miss M. A. Benson; in 
calisthenics, by Mrs. Dora King, both of the city schools; rd 
in school management, by Mr. C. N. Calloway, of Tuskegee 
(Ala.) Normal and Industrial School. The night meetings 
were large and enthusiastic. Interesting papers were read, and 
two able lectures were delivered by Dr. M. V.:Lyak, one on- 
“Ventilation,” and the other on “ The Food we Eat.” 
The following resolutions were unanimously adopted at the 
close of the Institute : 
“Wuereas, The State Superintendent has granted a Teach- 
ers’ Institute for the Western Division of the State of Tennes- 
see, in the city of Jackson ; and, 
“ Wuereas, The County Superintendent has shown interest 
in us; and, 
“Wuernas, Able al willing workers have been appointed 
to manage the work; and, 
“ Wuereas, The Board of Education of the city of Jackson 
has granted gratuitously the use of the public school building, 
and the churches have thrown open their deors to us; there- 
fore, be it 
“1. Resolved, That we, the teachers of West Tennessee, ex- 
tend our gratitude to Hon. W. R. Garrett, Superintendent of 
Public Instruction for the State of Tennessee, for so favoring us. 
“2. Resolved, That we offer our thanks to the County Super- 
intendent, Thomas H. Drake, for his presence and timely ad- 
vice; and to the earnest, efficient, and scholarly conductors of 
the Institute, Profs. A. R. Merry, A.M., and D. F. Rivers, A.B.

  Public School Officers’ Association. 
The Tennessee Public School Officers’ Association met in the 
Senate chamber, Tuesday morning, December 8, 1891. There 
was a large attendance and a most gratifying degree of enthu- 
siasm manifested. 
At 10 o’clock President Frank M. Smith called the Associa- 
tion to order. Elder R. Lin Cave offered prayer, asking divine 
blessing and guidance upon all the educational institutions of 
the State. 
Secretary Frank Goodman read the following telegram : 
“Merropotitan Horst, Wasuineton, D. C., Dee. 7, 1891. 
“ Frank Goodman, Secretary Public School Officers’ ern 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
“Dear Sir—Express my regrets to the Association, at not 
being able to be present. I heartily approve, and am ever 
ready to co-operate with any organization ‘that will aid in any 
way advancing the cause of education. 
“My Adjutant-general, Mr. Norman, will Pepreeg ne me in 
welcome the Association to Nashville. 
“Jno. P. Buchanan, 
“ Governor.” 
Adjutant-general Norman was than introduced and made a 
short and happy address of welcome. 
GENERAL NORMAN’S WELCOME. 
“Tt affords me great pleasure to witness this assemblage of 
people so deeply interested in the educational welfare of Ten-

nessee. Ido not appear before you in my own behalf, but as 
the representative of the Executive of your State. 
“TJ desire to say to you in the outset, that the cause of edu- 
cation has no truer friend anywhere, than it has in the person 
of John P. Buchanan, the Governor of your State. It has 
been his desire and earnest endeavor, upon every occasion, to _ 
lend all the aid in his power to the advancement of the noble 
cause of education, and I am glad and proud in his name to 
welome you this morning, the machinery and the propelling 
power of the educational interests of Tennessee, to her capital. 
I extend to you a thrice hearty welcome to it, and trust, in the 
name of the Executive, that you shall have a profitable sitting. 
“Tn addition to that, I desire to say when I look upon the 
faces before me I feel proud that so many of you are ready to 
interest vourselves and work for the advancement of the educa- 
tional interests of Tennessee. Captain Garrett, when I witness 
the interest that you seem to take in the cause of education, I 
am persuaded that it doth not yet appear what the State of 
Tennessee may be. When I see the interest that is manifested 
init, I feel that a bright future lies before us as a people, and 
if this is an index of what is to come, I trust and believe that 
, the future of Tennessee, educationally, will be one of the 
grandest of any State iu this Union of ours. 
“T desire to assure you again that the Executive of the State 
is in hearty sympathy with you in any movement, or in any 
thing which you may do that will forward the cause of educa- 
tion. He stands ready at any time, and at all times, to lend all 
the aid in his power to assist you in promoting our educational 
welfare; and, to you, Mr. President, and to every member of 
this Association, I bid a most hearty welcome to our State capi- 
tal, and say again that you have the sympathy of our Executive. 
“Though he is absent, his best wishes are with you, and I 
again extend to you a hearty welcome to our capital, and trust 
that whatever you may do may be done in such a way as to ad- 
vance our educational interests; that harmony may prevail, and
-P-A-G-E-322

that the outcome of your meeting may not only be seen to-day, 
but that it may grow and increase in depth and strength until 
it shall not only reach this generation, but generations which 
are to follow. Again, Mr. President, I welcome this Associa- 
tion to the capital of our State.” 
SUPT. BURKE’S RESPONSE. 
Superintendent M. R. M. Burke, of Bradley, in response to 
the address of welcome, said: 
“« As ships meet upon the pathless ocean, exchange words of 
greeting, and then pass on, so we have met to-day. 
“There is no grander mission than that which calls us to- 
gether on the present occasion, the mission of devising the best 
plans and methods for the propagation and the advancing of 
public education. The question of popular education com- 
mends itself to every citizen of this great commonwealth. It 
is fraught with interest to all. It has for its object the prepara- 
‘tion of citizenship. Without citizenship the stability and per- 
manency of our republican institutions are endangered, and 
true citizenship is attained alone through the education of the 
masses. 
“We rejoice in the educational advancement made in our 
State during the last years under the will and efficient leader- 
ship of our worthy chairman. Among other things which he 
inaugurated, was the meeting of County Superintendents and 
public school officers of the State, and, though this Association 
is yet in its infancy, we can even now see much good that it has 
accomplished. It has been said by an editor of one of our 
school journals that when the County Superintendents were 
called upon in this Association to represent their counties, that 
each would begin by saying: ‘Iam glad to have the honor to 
represent the grand old county of so and so.’ 
“Mr. President, ladies and* gentleman, we should rejoice in 
the fact this morning that we are Tennesseans; that we are 
14s, P.1.—Ap. E.

residents of the Volunteer State, a State that is noted for the 
number of eminent men that she has sent forth to the councils 
of the nation, men whose influence has been felt in every State 
of the Union; men who have risen by effort and exertion from 
obscurity to the highest offices in the gift of the people. Hast 
Tennessee is proud of the name of Andrew Johnson, Horace 
Maynard, and other eminent men who lived and died in the 
service of the people. No country beneath the sun has better 
natural facilities for the development of an intelligent people 
than Tennessee. 
“Tn addition to her mineral wealth, her clustering forests, 
wide and fruitful valleys, and charming waters, in addition to 
her bright and picturesque towns and flourishing cities, in ad- 
dition to her schools and patriotic people, she possesses a cli- 
mate so equable that thither one may flee from the scorching 
rays of a summer sun or the fierce blasts of a northern winter; 
her mountains are the lordly abodes of the coolest breezes in 
the hottest days, and her waters are as cold as if born amid 
eternal snows. Among the hills and mountains have been 
reared men of lofty bearing and giant intellects—men who have 
gone forth as representatives of a great and powerful people. 
The hills of Tennessee are to-day full of intellects which to 
grow great need only to be educated. The great demand of 
this day is for men pure in heart and life, and with educated in- 
tellects to step forth into the great conflict between right and 
wrong and save the people of Tennessee from ignorance and 
vice. I say ignorance and vice, because they are twin sisters, 
and wherever one lives the other dwells. 
“Tt affords us much pleasure to-day to meet in this beautiful 
-city—a city fraught with so many historical memories, the birth- 
place of so many eminent men, the home of so many illustrious 
characters, the resting-place of such men as Jackson and Polk, 
whose fame was not confined to the limits of this fair city, nor 
the borders of this grand old State, but whose influence was 
felt throughout this broad republic, and acknowledged across - 
the great waters; a city rich in all the natural resources, and 
that has been rendered far more so by the magic hand of prog-
-P-A-G-E-324

ress and civilization ; a city far farmed for the enterprise of her 
citizens; the city of schools and all things else that character- 
ize the life of an enlightened and Christian people. 
“We feel honored in being welcomed to the hospitalities of 
your city by the representative of the Chief Executive of the 
State, who, in his first message to the General Assembly of the 
State, said ‘that education is the only safeguard for our free 
institutions, and that common sense teaches that a government 
of the people requires the people to be educated.’ 
“Weare glad to say that Tennessee has a Governor who rec- 
ognizes the importance of an educated people, and whose best 
energies are being used in advancing the interest and bettering 
the welfare of the whole people.” 
President Smith then delivered the annual address, as follows: 
PRESIDENT’S ANNUAL ADDRESS, 
“Tam glad to meet so many of you at this, the fifth annual 
meeting, and to say that it has a larger number in attendance 
than we have ever had before at our morning session, which 
teaches me that we are growing in interest and in usefulness. 
Reference was made by one of the speakers, giving me the 
credit for the organization of this association. I think now 
that you should know a little something about it. I do not 
claim that this originated with me. Upon the contrary, the 
first impression upon my mind came from my immediate pre-- 
decessor, Hon. Thomas H. Paine, who is with us to-day, and I 
recall very well the conversation I had with him and the sug- 
gestions that he gave, because’I went in council with him im- 
mediately after my appointment. One of the suggestions that 
he made was the permanent organization of the County Su- 
perintendents, and he said he was satisfied that the time had ar- 
rived when such an organization could not only be perfected, 
but would live and do good work in the State. I had a con- 
sultation with Captain Garrett, our present Superintendent, 
then connected with the public schools-as an Institute Con-
-P-A-G-E-325
12 Pustrc Scuoot Orricers’ Association. 
ductor, and upon his advice and assurance of hearty co-opera- 
tion, backed by his knowledge of the affairs of the State, 
caused me to believe the organization would live. Also from 
correspondence with a good many of the County Superintend- 
ents of the State, who had been some time in the work, and 
who pledged me their earnest support, the convention was 
called. Hon. John M. Fleming, the first State Superintendent 
under our new school-law, enacted in 1875, called a convention 
of County Superintendents, which met in this city, and the 
only one present that I know of, who was at that meeting, is 
our present State Superintendent, at that time Superintendent 
of Schools in Giles County. Therefore, I, as State Superintend- 
ent, was simply following along the line that had been mapped 
out and well prepared, and which enabled me to take hold of 
the work and push it along, and the result of this organization 
is the outgrowth of that. This organization, of course, is the 
growth of what was done before. I want to say to you, that I 
want each of you to meet Captain Paine. I want you to know 
him and take him by the hand. This may be a strange address 
as President—I have had twelve months to prepare this address 
—but I want you to meet him and know him. Two of those 
who have held this position have crossed over the river, and it 
will not be long before the rest of us follow; but I want you to 
become acquainted with those who have been the official head 
of the public school system in the State. 
“As to some of the results of this organization, I wish to 
speak for your encouragement. I know what it has done, be- 
cause 1 had some knowledge of the school-work of the State 
of Tennessee before being called to the position of State Super- 
intendent. Thad assisted Col. Trousdale, Superintendent Doak, 
and Capt. Paine in Institute work, and through them had vis- 
ited various portions of the State, and understood the school- 
system as then existing.- I want to say to this organization of 
County Superintendents that I have seen the greatest results 
growing out of it. The County Superintendents come here and 
discuss questions and interchange opinions just as earnestly as 
you will find the members of the Legislature doing, and a 
County Superintendent will say, ‘ The constituency that I rep-
-P-A-G-E-326
    Pusirce Scuoon Orricers’ AssocraTtron. 13 
  
resent will not stand any thing of that Kind.’ Finally, when a 
resolution is adopted by this Association it seems to have some- 
thing of a binding force, and each member falls in with the ma- 
jority, and goes home from the meeting and puts this theory 
into execution. 
“Tam glad to say this morning that almost without a single 
exception, this has been.thecase. There are some things I wish 
to mention, and especially the text-book question, which has 
been very troublesome. I have found that it has given a good 
deal of trouble in parts of this State. Many of the County 
Superintendents do not know exactly what their authority is in 
regard to adopting a uniform series of text-books, or how to 
put them into the schools after they have been adopted. They 
come here and confer with those who have been successful in 
securing a uniformity in their counties. A uniform series has: 
been adopted generally throughout the State, and that question 
settled. The text-book question would’ not now. be mentioned 
in our legislative halls were it not for a few fellows who must 
talk about something, and have run out on all other questions. 
The amendment enacted by the last General Assembly was the 
direct result of the efforts of the State Teachers’ Association. 
One County Superintendent reports fifteen secondary schools in 
‘his county. How many schools must have been established 
throughout the State? 
“ This is the work of this Association, and I mention it that 
you may select for your committee on public school law, good, 
solid, clear-headed men, who will confer with each other and 
with the State Superintendent, so that we may continue to 
grow in that line and improve the law. We have simply to ask 
it at the hands of the Legislature and we will receive it, when 
we stand together, and that is exactly what we have been doing. 
The committee appointed at Knoxville last year met here in the 
office of the State Superintendent in connection with Captain 
Garrett, and we had no trouble in securing just the legislation 
we wanted. The only opposition that was made came trom fel- 
lows who had introduced bills anticipating this. They knew 
what was wanted, and what was coming, and had introduced
-P-A-G-E-327
14 Pusuic Scoot Orricers’ Association. 
bills directly along the same line, but when this came up from 
the joint committee from the Public School Officers’ Associa- 
tion, they opposed it simply because it was not the bill they in- 
troduced—that is all. When that little opposition was brushed 
out of the way, we had fair sailing. It is not necessary to men- 
tion these things. I shall be before you at another time and 
talk to you. For some time I had been an officer in one or 
another capacity connected with the State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, at Knoxville. A year ago you did me the honor to call 
me to this, the highest position within your gift. Ihave dis- - 
charged the duties as best I could, and at the close of this As- 
sociation I shall surrender my position. I shall give tomysuc- 
cessor all that it is within my power to give, and trust I shall 
have the pleasure of meeting with you from time to time and 
from year to year. 
“Now, this injunction I wish to lay on you, and I know well 
it will be granted before I make it. It is this: ‘Give to Capt. 
Garrett the same loyalty in carrying out the suggestions he 
shall make that you have always given to me.’ In not a single 
instance in the State of Tennessee have I called upon a teacher, 
public or private, for his co-operation that it was not cheerfully 
granted, and the same, of course, of County Superintendents 
and school-officers. I ask thé same loyalty and co-operation 
for him, and I know that you will give it without asking it, but 
simply call your attention to it. 
“ When the work of this Association shall have been com- 
pleted, take home with you what you shall gather here, and put 
it into your respective counties and put it into practice there. 
Let your watchword and cry be upward and onward, and, as .I 
said awhile ago, the future of this State, if we all the time look 
to the best interests of education, is something that we cannot 
now divine. We do not know—I cannot tell. I have seen 
wonderful growth in education in Tennessee since 1873, but 
what it will be in the next number of years corresponding with 
that number, I cannot tell. I bid you God speed. I hope to 
meet with you often, and work with you and assist you at all 
times.” [Applause.] :

President Smith then requested State Superintendent Garrett 
to make certain announcements. 
Superintendent Garrett said: 
3 . 
“The President and Executive Committee, in making ar- 
rangements for this meeting, have arranged for the meeting of 
the various committees, at 2:30 o’clock. ‘The plan of the Ex- 
ecutive Committee I think eminently wise. The committees 
are assigned subjects covering the work of the meeting. When 
these committees are large and the members live in different _ 
portions of the State, they find it impossible to have any com- 
munication with each other, and the work is thus thrown on 
the chairman. It is the desire of the Executive Committee that 
each report presented to us shall be the work of the entire com- 
mittee. It has been decided to assign rooms in which the sev- 
eral committees may meet at leisure, during the afternoon, and 
perfect their reports. Through the kindness of the Superin- 
- tendent of the Capitol, arrangements have been made for a'sep- 
arate room for each committee.” 
He then announced the rooms in which each committee 
should meet, and the time of meeting of each. 
President Smith.—“ We will now proceed with the roll-call 
by counties.” 
Superintendent Huftaker—‘< Mr. President, before we begin 
that, I want to make a motion that we begin at the other end 
of the list. It has been customary to take it turn about, and 
last year we began at A, and I move that we now begin at Z.” 
Motion lost, 13 voting in favor of it and 21 against. 
Secretary Goodman.—“ Mr. President, in this connection I 
desire to suggest that if the Superintendent from any county is 
not present, any one present from that county may represent 
him. Our usual custom has been to have one representative 
from each county. I would say further that Miss Pattie Ma- 
lone cannot be here until tomorrow. Miss Harper is present, 
and is associated with her as a teacher, and I suggest that she

represent Sumner County, and also be added to Miss 0’ Don- 
nell’s committee.” 
Ordered by the President, that Miss Harper represeut Sum- 
ner County, and also meet with Miss O’Donnell’s committee. 
Prof, Frank, of Elizabethton, and W. E. Thompson, of 
Unionville, were added to the Committee on Examinations and 
Promotions.

The roll by counties was then called by Secretary Goodman, 
and interesting five-minute responses, relating to the growth, 
improvement, and future educational progress, were given by 
the following County Superintendents : 
Mr, J. H. Allen, Superintendent of Bedford: 
“T hope you will pardon my embarrassment at this moment. 
The soldier at Waterloo did not march to that disastrous conflict 
and world-famed defeat with greater reluctance and with darker 
forebodings than I enter these bragging matches of the Public 
School Officers’ Association. Extreme modesty may, in a 
measure, account for this; but, in the language of the Teachers’ 
Head-light, of Sweetwater, ‘I am glad to have the honor of 
representing the grand old county of’ Bedford in this Associa- 
tion. Mr. President, while I desire to frankly confess that mine 
is not the only county in the State, your Jong and intimate re- 
lationship with the public schools and the public school system 
of Tennessee, has taught you long ago, that it is the ‘ onliest.’ 
“It is the one county in the State that enjoys the distinction of 
having had the first teachers’ meeting for mutual improvement; 
the first County Instituté, and the first county organization of 
Public School Directors in the State. It is the only county in 
the State that can claim the honor of having collected and worn 
out a professional library for county teachers. It is the only 
county that has run a teachers’ reading. circle for six years, and
-P-A-G-E-330

has held meetings regularly the first Saturday in each month 
during that time, with only three exceptions. It is the only 
county in the State that has run a County Normal Institute for 
seven years, without the slightest disturbance, lagging of inter- 
est, or evidence of retrogression, and that, too, without want- 
ing, asking, or receiving financial aid from any source what- 
ever. It is the only county in the State that dropped the third 
grade certificate before it was ordered done by the State Super- 
intendent. It is the only county in the State that has not al- 
lowed an educational enterprise to die on its hands since 1873, - 
and it is the only county in the State that has organized sixty 
secondary schools in the year 1891. Besides that, Mr. Presi- 
dent, Bedford County claims an undivided interest in the 
Waterbury that the Teachers’ Head-light recommends ‘should 
be worn by the daddy of the secondary school bill?” 
Superintendent M. R. M. Burke, of Bradley: 
“Mr. Chairman, I shall enter upon my eighth year of super- 
vision of the schools of Bradley County next June. We have 
a scholastic population of 5,633; have an enrollment of 3,070, 
and daily attendance of 1,905. Expended last year $13,454. 
We have forty white and ten colored schools, including two 
city and four secondary schools. We have a uniformity of 
text-books. We have a County Court that favors public 
education. They levy a tax of 15 cents on the $100. 
Our school-term is about five months. We have two an- 
nual Normals each year, one for whites and the other for the 
colored. Wehavea monthly Institute during the autumn. Our 
teachers attend the annual Normal. They are above the 
average in qualifications, and take the Head-light and Southern 
Teacher, which accounts for their qualifications. Some of them 
take other journals. We have forty new school-houses, built 
within the last six years, with an increase in school-property 
from $7,000 to $35,000. Weare having them seated with good 
desks as we find means to'do so. We are preparing to have 
them all graded. We are not what we want to be, but are get- 
ting there as fast as our financial ability will let us.”

Superintendent J. R. McDonald, of Crockett: 
“T do not know that I have any thing to say about Crockett 
County. It is a small county in West Tennessee. We have a 
scholastic population of about 6,000. We have about forty-eight 
districts. We have adopted the civil district system, as recom- 
mended by our former Superintendent. Our County Court has 
made about forty-eight school-districts and fifteen civil districts. 
Each of these has one white school in it. The School Directors 
_ of the white districts have supervision over the colored schools in 
their territory. We have twenty cents on the $100 levied. We 
run our schools, [think, about four months. I think the average 
this year does not come up to that. We have been engaged in 
regulating the new school-districts. This was rather out of the 
harness, and we have not done as well this year as in former 
years. 
Superintendent Smith.— You levy twenty cents?” 
Superintendent McDonuald.— Yes, sir; we levy twenty cents 
in addition to the State tax. ‘The County Court levies twenty 
cents on the $100.” 
_ Superintendent Smith.—That makes thirty-five cents, and 
four months’ school?” 
Superintendent McDonald.—* Yes, sir; you must understand 
that our county is not so rich as some counties. We have tol- 
erably fair schools, but when we come to employ our teachers 
we find that we have not sufficient money to run our schools as 
long as those counties that are larger. That is the trouble in 
Crockett County. We have no large towns in our county. 
They are all small places of not more than 800 inhabitants. 
Bell’s Depot is the largest and best town in the county. Our 
taxable property in the county does not exceed more than one 
million and a half, and when you put twenty cents on the hun- 
dred dollars we have not money enough in our county to run 
our schools longer than four months, and not near as long as 
they ought to run.”

“Our schools are mostly primary. We have some good schools. 
We have a splendid one at Bell’s Depot, and also a splendid sec- 
ondary school at Alamo. It was started last summer, and has* 
two good under-teachers. We have a good school at Jackson 
Grove, and at other small places in the country. There isa 
splendid school under the supervision of Prof. Cook, of Bed- 
ford County, a splendid teacher, in our locality. In his school, 
the higher branches are taught. I think that we are on high 
ground, : 
“From the present outlook, I think we have reason for en- 
couragement, and that within the next twelve months we will 
have our schools better organized and have more system in our 
organization. Our teachers are better educated. I am satisfied 
of this fact—there is no possible doubt about it. Our teachers 
are passing better grades in examination, which I attribute to 
the interest thatthe present State Superintendent has mani- 
fested in our county. I know that what you did for our county 
while Superintendent has helped us greatly. We are under ob- 
ligations to our last two Superintendents, especially for the judi- 
cious way in which they treated our county. ‘To Capt. Garrett 
also we are indebted for one of the best Peabody Normal Insti- 
tutes [ have ever attended, and one that lasted a week last year. 
In 1890, at Bell’s Depot, we spent about a week in a Normal 
Institute, and since that time we have been meeting monthly. 
We havea programme of teachers’ Institute work, and we discuss 
subjects. Here is one trouble—I do not know whether other 
counties have it or not. Some of our teachers, I might say, 
need just a little advancement in their knowledge of the text- 
books, though a spirit of study is alive in our county as never 
before, and I think within the next twelve months or two 
years at least, our county will be up with the others along that 
line.” ; 
Mrs. Alice E. Graves,.Superintendent of Cumberland: 
“Tn an assembly composed of such long and time-honored 
servants, and in the senatorial hall of the great State of 
Tennessee, it is calculated to take away from one that cool

quality which would enable her to say. carefully what she would 
like to; but when I recall the need I have for information 
and knowledge, it gives me courage. Cumberland County, as 
you know, is one of the rural counties of this State. We have 
no large towns in our county. Our county town is a small one. 
I can claim for ourselves very little of what Bedford County 
claims. One thing, however, we have. We levy a tax of 60 
cents on the $100, so far as [ have heard. 
“We held a Normal School or Institute one week, conducted 
by Prof. Billingsley, from which I found many seeds growing 
as I visited the schools throughout the county afterwards. It 
created a great deal of interest throughout the county. My 
people whom I represent feel that it is the beginning of a new 
era in educational work. Our county is just recovering from 
the ravages of the war; but after a time, when we have more 
money, our people will look more after the schools, although 
they realize their lack now, and are very anxious to give the 
Opportunities to their children. Our County Court has not 
been very mindful of our welfare. At the time this question 
was brought up, our County Court had made independent dis- 
triets, not knowing it had no right to do so, Then it found 
that it was wrong at the time I took the office, and it recalled 
its past action and made the school-districts and civil districts. ’ 
identically the same, leaving me the duty of appointing s¢hool- 
directors. 
“Our schools started out this year with much better pros- 
pects, and, as I took great care in selecting parties for these ap- . 
pointments, I believe they were more judicious than those who- 
- were elected. That, of course, was no credit to myself. The 
number of days of school for each school was more general 
than ever before, but, right in the beginning of the term, at the 
October term, the County Court made every district,in the 
county independent. We have a number of schools from that 
action that will not receive any more than $19, or $20 at most, 
of the appropriation for the schools of the county. No school 
can be carried on with good results with that amount of appro- 
priation—which has caused more labor and confusion for me. 
1 intend to make the best of it, and do the best I can.”
-P-A-G-E-334
  Pusuic Scuoot Orricers’ Association. 21 
Captain Garrett——“ By these schools made independent, you 
mean the schools were made separate ?” 
Mrs. Graves.‘ Yes, sir, with three separate Directors.” 
Captain Garrett.-‘‘ How many districts did that make ?”’ 
Mrs. Graves.— Fifty-three. I went into one district, when 
I was visiting the schools, and visited the school in the district, 
and asked the distance to the next, and they told me it was two 
miles. The Director said: ‘You may think it is three miles, 
but I believe it is two miles, measured.’ Well, I found in that 
school thirteen pupils, and in the next one, eleven. Iasked the 
distance to the next, and they said one mile. I went there, and 
found nine pupils, each school running two months. Here 
were three schools, that would have made one good strong 
school of six months. Ihave not appointed Directors for those 
districts. I have withheld that action, thinking that, perhaps, , 
at the January term I could have that changed. I shall make 
an effort to have but one school in’ that district. 
“The Presbyterian Church at Martinville had a school, and 
with their assistance, united with the public school money, we 
have a secondary school, and one that is doing good work. At 
Pleasant Hill we have a school formed in the same way. They 
have a fine building and a good corps of teachers. There are 
five teachers in that school. It is a secondary school. We 
have a secondary school of three months at Hiwassee. We 
have a school at Crossville, and I have great hope for that 
school, for the reason that they have taken the grade recom- 
mended by the State Superintendent, which we have adopted 
as our grade for that county, making that the foundation. We 
expect to make that school an academy and add an additional 
course as often as called for, and make that the central school 
for that county, to which the pupils of the county. will be ad- 
mitted as the advanced course in their respective schools. 
“Have the Directors the power to declare the schools either 
primary or secondary? I found many teachers teaching sec- 
ondary branches, and extending the time from 7 o’clock in the 
morning until 5 in the afternoon, in order to complete the work.
-P-A-G-E-335

22 Pusiic Scuoot Orricurs’ AssocraTIon. 
We have tive secondary schools in.that county, but, with the 
exception of three, none have more than one teacher. My own 
_ school is a secondary school. I have forty pupils and quite an 
extended list of branches, from A BC on up. It will be a long 
time before our public schools, with the exception of those 
mentioned, will be able to afford more than one teacher. I 
found the people ready to assist me in every way, except with 
reports. I felt that when I came to this meeting with a bad 
report, it might be attributed to neglect, but it was unavoidable. 
I did not know until last week that the president would call 
upon us for reports; and, when I went into the office and asked 
for the books and papers pertaining to this matter, I was told 
that my predecessor had none. A report was handed to me 
about two weeks ago without a word. I have a good deal to 
learn, however, and hope, another year, to be in better 
standing.” 
W. Mac Fuqua, Superintendent of Davidson : 
“T have had the honor of attending all the meetings of this 
body, except the last ove, and in looking over it I see but few 
familiar faces. Many changes have been made, so far as Super- 
intendents are concerned. I want to say that we have thirty 
school-districts in Davidson County. Nashville constitutes the 
-first district, and we have twenty-nine rural districts, and in 
the twenty-nine districts we have 128 schools, and in that 128 
schools we have fourteen secondary schools. We had thirteen 
when I reported here, and they are doing most excellent work. 
The rest are primary. I want to say, too, that I have written - 
seventeen secondary certificates only, all to white people, and 
twelve first-grade and five second-grade to colored people, who 
applied, not for the secondary examination. Of the 128 schools 
over which my jurisdiction extends, since the 24th of August, 
I have visited 125; and in making these visits I have met 4,064 
pupils actually in the school-houses. 
“J wish to say, in regard to this secondary school law, this 
new law, that I have some misgivings on the subject. One
-P-A-G-E-336

question, I think, will cause us a little trouble, and that is the 
grading. I would be glad to have the suggestions of the State 
Superintendents on this subject. The pupils will not all get in 
the first of August or the first of September, in any given 
school. For instance, a boy enters the first of the term and 
goes on for a time, and has to stop to dig potatoes, or help 
gather some crop; when that pupil comes back, where will you 
put him? If he has started in and continued eight or nine 
months, and then drops out for two months at the beginning of 
the next term, where will you put him? He is getting along 
well at school; will he be advanced with his class, or will he 
have to be put back ? 
“Our County Court levies 10 cents and our State 15 cents, 
which gives most of our districts money to run eight or eight 
and one-half months. They averaged nearly nine months this 
year. 
“ Now, fellow-Superintendents, I want to say one thing, and I 
do not think I will be wrong in saying it. I hope we will take 
some action, and recommend something of this kind to the Leg- 
islature to get them to take some action. That is, I hope the 
Legislature will pass a law giving County Superintendents the 
power to compel teachers to attend teachers’ meetings and In- 
stitutes. [Applause.] I wish to God we had that power abso- 
lute in our hands; but our hands are tied. We have a reason- 
ably good attendance by white teachers, but we have a remark- 
able attendance at our colored teachers’ Institutes. You may 
call the Institutes—call the meetings—every month, and we 
have a fine attendance. The trouble is to get the white teach- 
ers to go. I would to God that we had power to run them in. 
Suppose I issued that order, and am met squarely and am asked 
for the law, my authority, as has been intimated to me, what 
would be done then? Where am I placed? Let us recom- 
mend something on this point to the next legislature, and I 
think I voice the sentiment of every County Superintendent in 
this convention when I say what I do: Let us have some way to 
force these fellows in. They know too much now, and do not 
think it is absolutely necessary. If they will give us this kind
-P-A-G-E-337

of a law, we will teach them a lesson, or our successors will. 
{Laughter.] You know, elections are strange things. 
“JT have not any thing more to say. We are in a reasonably 
good fix. I want to say that the last log school-house in 
Davidson County has disappeared. I do not mean to reflect 
upon the log school-house. It has done its work. Some of the 
best men in our State have had no advantages for education 
except those furnished by the little log school-house on the 
hill.” 
Superintendent E. W. Brown, of DeKalb: 
“T do not know that my voice will hold up to make the © 
statement that I desire to make. At the same time, this is not 
the first time that I have had the privilege of meeting with this 
body directly. In the voice of those who have preceded me, it 
affords me pleasure. This is the first year that I have worked 
in this place. Indirectly, I have been connected with the work 
for some years, working and assisting as best I could in the 
work as a private worker. I came into this office in January. 
Lam not here to censure those that have preceded me, but I 
am here to say that when I came into this office I did not find 
it in the condition I hope it will go out of my hands in. My 
report is in a bad shape, and had I depended on a written re- 
port made up from what was turned over to me, I would have 
had none, for there was nothing turned over to me. When 
called upon to furnish you a report, as it was my duty to do, I 
had to tush through the county in any way and in all ways to 
obtain the information you demanded at my hands, and I did 
so. I will not grumble at my county. I have no right to do 
so, because when I have attempted to do my duty, the others 
are equally ready. 
“My first effort in the county, as soon as I got things ar- 
ranged, was to call a County Institute, and we had a summer 
Institute for the examination of teachers, but I do not consider 
this the time to do the county work. As early as February 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
   
  Pustre Scuoon Orricers’ AssoctaTton. 25 
“we called a teachers’ meeting in DeKalb County, to give them 
some shape and arrange for the Institutes as best we could, 
Since that time we have had regular County Institutes, moving 
from point to point. At first these were not well attended. 
Idid not anticipate one annoying fact, and that was that no 
Superintendent before had called such a meeting, except for the 
purpose of examining teachers, but these were all of the right 
type. I employed these as special solicitors to go and tell the 
other teachers to attend the meetings, and we organized the 
teachers of the county. The next time not only the teach- 
ers but the people attended the Institutes, and since that time 
we have had Institutes such as had not been in that county 
before. Ido not claim it for myself, but I stand along with my 
brother teachers, and we are going on in that work the best 
_we can. 
“T have to-day, I believe, 6,740 children connected with the 
schools, and we have expended this year $8,749. These children 
represent eighty-two schools, conducted by 108 teachers. I be- 
lieve we have too many schools in that county. I have en- 
- deavored to consolidate them. Iwant to draw from you all I 
ean. I want to bear the knowledge into my county, and there 
- sow the seed which will produce good fruit.” 
W. G. MeMillan, Superintendent of Dickson: 3 
“Tam glad to meet you in this hall and say that I represent 
upwards of 5,000 children in the schools of Dickson County. 
Our schools there are upon rising ground. While our financial 
condition is not as good as we could desire, still we have at 
Edgewood, Cloverdale, and Dickson schools of distinction. 
“One of the greatest troubles I have is to get the Directo 
to employ the right kind of teachers—those'who are capable of 
_ doing the work properly. There are a good many who do not 
go so much on qualifications. While the schools of Dickson — 
County are growing and improving, there is still room for them 
to-grow and do more’ good.” ©

J. W. Baker, Superintendent of Gibson : 
“This is the first time I have had the privilege of meeting 
with this body, and, in the language of the Hast Tennessee 
Sweetwater Head-light, ‘I am proud to represent old Gibson.’ 
She has always taken a front stand in the cause of education. 
We have 14,637 as a scholastic population in Gibson, and about 
71 per cent. of that number is enrolled in the schools. Our 
school-term is. about 105 days, or four and one-half months 
during the year. About 58 per cent. of the enrollment is in 
average daily attendance. I find this difficulty with our school- 
term, however: We have two months during the summer, and 
the remaining three months during the winter. Of course the 
schools stop during crop gathering time, and thereby they lose, 
I think, the greater part of the time spent, inasmuch as they 
go only two months in. the summer and stop; and when they 
start on the three months term in the winter, they barely have 
time to review what they did in the summer’ and get oust a 
little beyond, thereby losing a great deal of time. 
“Tn regard to primary and secondary schools, I was called 
upon to report the number according to the manner in which 
the Directors had declared the schools either primary or sec- 
‘ondary, and necessarily had to report twenty-five secondary and 
one hundred primary schools. That took incorporated schools 
in, Since then I have learned there are 135 schools in all. In 
some districts where we have from one to eight pupils who 
were competent to study algebra, or thought they were, the 
Directors declared that school a secondary school in order to 
accommodate from one to eight pupils, which necessarily has 
thrown a good deal of work upon the teacher in that school. 
The teachers there are organizing a teachers’ association, in 
which there is a good deal of interest manifested. The teachers, 
during the time I have been in office, I think, have held three 
Directors’ meetings with a view to adopting text-books for the 
primary and secondary schools. One thing in regard to text- 
books: I think it is the duty of the Directors to memorialize © 
the Legislature to appoint a school-book commissioner for the 
State, similar to that for the State of Missouri. I hope that

while the Superintendents are here discussing various matters, 
this will be discussed and brought up, so we can see what we 
can do with them in order to get the books to the people on 
better terms. 
“T visited about forty-five schools during the summer and 
fall, before the summer term closed. In visiting these schools 
I found this difficulty—that the teachers could not get the nec- 
essary books in order to grade them. In some of the schools 
I took hold of the work and graded them myself. In some 
_ schools the people were able to get the books necessary and in 
others they were not—they were just too poor. Our County 
Court levies a tax of 45 cents on the $100 and the poll-tax goes 
into our school-money during the year. We get about $2.50 
_per capita, making an aggregate of about $36,500. One thing 
aggregates to our county, and that is that the people build the 
_ school-houses, or the greater number, themselves, and thereby 
save the public money for the education of the children. This 
is one noble thing in Gibson County. We have had several 
excellent school-houses built in that way.” 
; President Frank M. Smith.—A good many of you are ac- 
quainted with Mr. Baker, County Superintendent of Gibson 
County. Mr. Baker is totally blind. He was educated at the 
Tennessee School for the Blind in this city, and was elected 
County Superintendent of his county, and is doing excellent 
work there. Two of the boys at the University of Tennessee, 
__who were class-mates of his there, frequently inquire of me to 
know how he is getting along, as they desire that Mr. Baker 
shall be successful. We want the people in this State to un- 
derstand and to know that a man who is blind can be County 
Superintendent of Public Schools or of any thing else. They - 
can be prepared to fill any position in life. Iam glad to say 
that Mr. Baker is doing very well indeed.”

County this year. You are well aware that the new schobdl-law 
brought about two changes, both of which I have endeavored 
to meet. In the first place, the schools are required to be 
graded. To do this it was necessary to adopt a uniformity of 
text-books for the schools. I called together. the Directors of 
the county, and, with the aid of the teachers, succeeded in getting 
_ a uniform series of text-books adopted for three years, and then 
I graded the schools. My examinations have been rigid. I have 
quarterly examinations and then monthly examinations. I ad- 
here to that strictly, and have it generally understood that the 
examinations will be held at those times. At first I was threat- 
ened, and told that they would compel me to hold examina- 
tions. 
“We have 115 primary schools and twenty-one secondary 
schools. The County Court has not yet laid out the county 
into school-districts. They seem to be afraid to undertake it, 
but I think they are fully alive to the interests of the public 
schools, from one fact; they are disposed to increase the County 
Superintendent’s salary under the new school-law. One dis- 
trict in the county has no secondary school yet, and one district 
has two. We have a school-fund of something over $24,000. 
Ten cents on the $100 is the tax levied. On the whole, I think 
I can report the schools of the county in ‘better condition than 
ever before.” 
Hi. D. Huffaker, Superintendent of Hamilton: 
“Tn looking over the educational field for the past five years, 
I am proud that I was in the organization of the Public School 
Officers’ Association of Tennessee, and that I have been per- 
mitted to attend all the meetings of that body. I consider it 
one of the most important factors in the educational work in 
Tennessee, and one which will do more for the public schools 
of this-State than any other organization within its borders. 
It is indeed gratifying to note the rapid advancement and im- 
provement in the cause of education throughout this broad 
land of ours, and I am pleased to say, fellow County Superin-

  _tendents, that Hamilton County has tried to keep pace with the 
foremost ranks of the educational van of the day. The most 
important event of the year in Hamilton County was its ex- 
position of school-work, which took place at the court-house 
on the nineteenth of last December. The exhibits consisted 
chiefly, I might say exclusively, of the actual work of the. 
children in all the county schools; and besides that, we had a 
book department, where the teachers deposited various profes- 
sional works. We are glad we held this exposition, as teachers 
had an excellent opportunity of comparing methods and select- 
ing the best. The teachers are now preparing for an exposition 
to be held during the annual Institute next year, to which I 
now take the opportunity of inviting you. : 
“The average monthly salary of teachers in Hamilton County 
_ last year was $44.62, having a term of 133 days. We have 
established a circulating library, known as the Hamilton County 
Teachers’ Circulating Library. This movement began about: 
ayear ago. It was hard work and required a strong effort, but 
we have now begun arrangements to open the library formally, 
with public exercises, on January 9. We have ten secondary 
schools, nine white and one colored. I have discouraged the 
idea of having secondary schools where we could not have more 
than one teacher. I do not approve of this mixing and crowd- 
ing of primary and secondary schools together with only one 
teacher. I would much rather have a, good primary than an 
inferior secondary school, and therefore I have recommended, 
following the suggestions of Captain Garrett, and have estab- 
lished no secondary schools in that county where we cand not 
have more than one teacher.’ 
Mrs. ©. H. Jackson, Superintendent of Hancock: 
“T can say that the public schools in Hancock County are 
doing moderately good work. For. the last few years the 
schools of Hancock have been steadily and slowly increasing, 
and I flatter myself that they are to-day better than they have 
been heretofore. I think they are increasing, and I think the

people are awake to the. interests of education. We have in 
Hancock County seventeen school-districts, with a scholastic 
population of 4,661. We have fifty-one schools, four of which 
are secondary ; two colored schools, both of which are primary ; 
a good corps of teachers, and I think our, schools will do well. 
I have visited each school in our county once, some of them 
twice, and some of them more than twice. I feel that I have 
made the visits profitable financially in dividing the county into 
Institute districts. We have arranged to hold Institutes in 
each district at regular intervals. We also joined in the In- 
stitute held October 30 and 31, at which Captain Garrett was 
present. I feel encouraged at the success of our schools. Our 
‘teachers are wide-awake. We have a good corps; they are 
availing themselves of all educational privileges, are doing very 
good work, and I think in the near future our schools will -be 
better than they are now. The school-term in Hancock County 
ranges from three to four and one-half months. We have some 
high schools in the county doing good work and running ten 
months each year. I can say, in conclusion, that Iam glad to © 
be here at this meeting. This is my first time to be at a public 
school officers’ association of the State of Tennessee. I am 
_ glad to represent Hancock County. I am glad to represent 
her boys and girls here, and that we can report progress.” 
W. F. Dyke, Superintendent of Hawkins: 
“We meet together at this Public School Officers’ Associa- 
tion, and congratulate ourselves. at the end of another year’s 
work. We have good schools in my county. Our people are 
very much interested in the cause of public education. The in- 
telligence of our teachers is a matter of pride; indeed, they. 
know so much that it makes us careful. We have 115 primary 
and six secondary schools, and a good County Court; a court 
that is alive to the cause of education and that does its best for 
every child in the county. I know with what disadvantages 
children in the country have to labor and struggle for an edu- 
cation. ;

“We have in the county of Hawkins 8,891 children, and we 
have reason to feel interested in and proud of the intellectuality 
of those children. We have much to be thankful for this year, 
as it has been a very eventful one. I-congratulate you and 
felicitate myself that I am in the midst of such a band of men 
and women. I congratulate Prof. Wm. Graybill and T. C. 
Karns that we can meet and talk of what we have done for that 
county and for the various counties in the State. We congrat- 
ulate Superintendent W. R. Garrett, Hon. Frank M. Smith, 
and our honored Governor, Johu P. Buchanan, on what they 
have done toward extending and increasing the responsibility 
of the profession to which we are bound to give our allegiance.”

W. A. Tanner, Superintendent of Haywood County: 
“Tt is under peculiarly embarrassing circumstances that I ap- 
_ pear this morning as the representative from Haywood County. 
eye   It has been abreast with her sister counties in this great and im- 
portant work of public education. 
“Very early in the year I had nerve enough, under the cir- 
cumstances, to call together our County Directors for the pur- 
pose of organizing themselves into an educational board to 
adopt a uniform series of text-books to enable the teachers to 
grade the schools, and also rules for the government of the 
schools. This they arranged early in the fall term, and it was 
placed in the hands of the teachers of the county, and, while 
we have been unable to perfect this plan under the circum- 
stances, yet I feel confident, from the interest I have seen man- 
ifested, that during the next year our county will be a unit on 
text-books, and will have graded schools. Another thing that 
_ gave impetus to our schools was a visit from our worthy State 
Shperintendent. Before this time, the people hardly knew there 
was such a thing as a State Superintendent. They knew of 
him, but that was all. But he came down there and awakened 
an interest. Since his visit, we have been able to hold two In- 
stitutes in our county, and at the close of one we organized a 
teachers’ association, which has been meeting regularly the last

Saturday in each month, and, be it to the credit of the ladies 
whom I have the pleasure of looking upon to-day, a large per 
cent. of the attendance at these Institutes has been ladies, and 
from this I judge that our future teachers will be ladies. Iam 
satisfied they will. We expect to raise the standard of qualifi- 
cation, and we have so notified our teachers, and I am delighted 
to see the interest that is manifested in improvement by these 
teachers. 
“Our colored Institutes have also been organized, and they 
are largely attended. So soon as their terms of school were out, 
as a general thing the colored teachers have entered those 
schools we denominate secondary schools. We have a few of 
these in our county. We have sixty-seven schools altogether, 
most of which are primary. We have only four that I legiti- 
mately term secondary schools. I think, sir, that we are on 
upward ground, and I am satisfied of this from the fact that 
they had cut the Superintendent’s salary down to about what 
it had been, and I am now ereditably informed that they are 
going to raise it one hundred per cent.—our County Court is 
going to do it. 
“T have done the best that I could under the circumstances. 
I have aroused an interest in the schools of my county, some- 
thing that has never been done there before, by visiting all the 
schools in the county. In fact, I was introduced to the chil- 
dren in the schools in this way: ‘ Children, let me introduce 
you to the County Superintendent. I am sure you never saw 
one before.’ And they said: ‘Yes, we never saw one before.’ 
I have visited many of the schools the second time, and have 
really created an interest that has not heretofore existed. 
“ We have a scholastic population of 9,200. Average num- 
ber of days taught during the summer and fall months, ninety © 
days. The teachers’ salaries average $30 a month. I have en- 
deavored, as best I could, and brought before my Directors, 
last Saturday, a plan by which I hope we can give more interest 
to these schools. 
“We have twelve civil districts and thirteen school districts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-346

 Thave made an estimate, and submitted it to the Directors, of 
the number of schools that would be ample for each district, 
which seems to be satisfactory, and I think we are going to 
concentrate, and have fewer and better schools, better teachers, 
and more money to pay the teachers.”   
_W. B. Vancleave, Jr., Superintendent of Henry : 
“Tam glad to be present with you to-day, and I am glad to 
have the privilege and honor of representing old Henry in this 
- noble body of teachers and school-officers. I am glad I can 
* report progress all along the line. We have a better grade of 
teachers than ever before. Our schools, in Henry, open in 
‘July—the second Monday in July—and run until the first 
Monday in December. We have them graded. Part of them 
were graded early and part late in the season. We have a 
scholastic population of 8,235, a gain of fifty-eight. Our money 
for this present year is $17,580.55. We have been able to run our 
schools a little more than five months this year. ‘They are not out, 
_ and we do not know exactly how long they will run. We had two 
Institutes in July. They were both successful, and were the 
first ever held in the county. We had a white Institute by 
Prof. Rose, at Bell’s Station. It was a great success, and was 
well attended, both by Directors and teachers. Most of the 
people and citizens there belong to the Methodist Church, and 
they asked us to do like the Methodists do—appoint a place for 
the next meeting before you break up this one. If you do, we 
- wantit appointed here. The oldest citizens living there, and 
_ the entire people living there, talk it up all the year, and have. 
become thoroughly enthused; and the Directors say to their 
teachers, ‘We want you to go to the Institutes.’ The Institutes 
are largely attended, the teachers are determined to increase © 
their usefulness, and every thing is progressing all along the 
line. Our Directors have taken a great deal more interest than 
  _ ever before. They inquire of me who are the best teachers. 
: We have, as stated by the Directors, twenty-two secondary and 4 
ninety primary schools, 112 in all, and 112 teacliers, and a great

many more applicants. -I think old Henry is going to come up 
to the front. : 
“T must say, tffat T am glad to hear the representative from 
old Bedford boom up that county. That is my native county. I 
' want to say, that I have been in the school-work for over forty- 
eight years, and I have taught the third generation in the 
neighborhood where I live.” 
Miss Nannie Scott, Superintendent of Humphreys: 
“As this is my first opportunity to meet with this body of 
public school officers, it is scarcely necessary for me to say — 
that Iam glad to be present. I will not try to boom Humphreys 
County. While it is not on top of the educational line, we are 
trying to get there. How long it will be I do not know, but I 
hope it will not be very long. 
“ We have a scholastic population of 4,178. I believe there 
are about seventy-five schools. We have not, as yet, established 
any secondary schools. LI issued, I believe, about eight first- 
grade secondary certificates. We could have about five good 
secondary schools in our county, and hope to establish them 
next year. Iam sorry to say Humphreys is one of the counties 
in which we have not a uniform series of text-books. It is also 
a county in which the civil districts are subdivided into school- 
districts. We have fifteen civil districts and fifty-two school- 
districts. Each school-district has three Directors, making 
156 Directors, which gives me more trouble than any thing else. 
I have found in the schools this year teachers.who could not 
tell the District they were teaching in. One gentleman re- 
marked, in substances that he would be glad if we could force | 
the teachers to attend the Institutes. We have enough of 
teachers, and have hada better attendance this year than hereto- 
fore, but there have been only fifty-two teachers present at the 
Institutes. We have held five Institutes from April to Sep- 
tember. Out of about 100 teachers, we have had but about 
fifty-two present. Our schools are not what we would like for

them to be, but the educational interest is greatly increasing, 
and I trust that next year I shall be able to give in a report 
showing that we have a uniform series of text-books, and that 
our'districts are not divided as they now are. I shall do all in 
my power to advance the cause, ” 
J.C. Ford, Superintendent of Knox: 
“We do not claim that distinction for Knox County that the 
gentleman does for Bedford. The features connected with our 
- school-system and school-work in Knox County, it is essential 
that we have money for the forwarding of the same, and so with 
our Normal Institutes, and all the other features connected 
with our work. We have not that high distinction that the 
- gentleman speaks so eloquently of in Bedford County. It takes 
   dollars and cents to build up the school-work in the county of 
Knox. It is also. a part of the history of our county that dol- 
lars and cents are the cause, in part, or the reason for the ad- 
vaneement of our schools, because we have a sufficient school- 
fund to have a good term each year. We have a fund of about 
$23,000, including the city of Knoxville. 
“Our schools are doing very well in Knox County. We | 
have not yet established very many secondary schools. 
We have 140 schools in our county. We have established 
ten secondary schools, two of which have been established 
since I made my report to the State Superintendent. I concur 
with the gentleman from Hamilton County in the establishment 
of secondary schools. I am in hearty sympathy with the 
movement for the establishment of secondary schools. I be- 
lieve, unless we can have more than one teacher in every 
school, it is not best to establish secondary schools in the 
county. “ 
“There is another thing I desire to notice, because I propose 
to conclude in three minutes; and that is the teachers’ library. 
We have established a teachers’ circulating library in the 
county of Knox. It is established imthe County Superintend-

ent’s office. We have now 400 volumes, to which the teachers    have access. I feel that this is one of the best.movements we 
  have made, for this gives the teachers access to this school- 
library. The library has been open since August 1. It is build- 
ing up with our school-work, and we are all proud of it. We 
do not boast of bringing about that result without money. We 
are not similar to Bedford County in that respect, because it 
takes money to build up school-work; and our school-library 
cost us about $400. It cost us that with the exception of some 
books that were given us, about $50 or $75 worth. These 
books, I desire to say, belong to the library exclusively, and 
are not iadividual property, but belong to the Knox County 
Teachers’ Circulating Library. We have over 100 volumes on 
pedagogy. ft 
“There is one other thing that I want to mention, but it will | 
be discussed further on at length and more ably than I could if > 
I would. It isin connection with the public school interests of 
Knox County and of other counties in Tennessee. Jt is the 
Teachers’ Department at the University of Tennessee. I desire — 
here to insist upon each and every County Superintendent in 
the State of Tennessee insisting upon their teachers to attend _ 
the Teachers’ Department of the University of Tennessee. It 
is true it is in the Eastern Division, and in Knox County, but 
it is also true, in my opinion, that it is one of the best schools. 
for preparing teachers in the South. In my opinion, it pos- 
sesses facilities superior to those of any other school in East 
Tennessee, in the entire State of Tennessee, and in the South 
generally. 
“T want to say, in conclusion, that there is still room for im- 
provement in the county of Knox. There are a great many 
things that we have not done, and a great many things that we 
will have to. do. We have a good system of schools there. We 
are laying the ground-work there, and, in doing so, we shall 
strive each year to make our success greater and our work more 
efficient.” 
Capt. Frank M. Smith.—“ Ever since that county organized a.

  they have also held Institutes in each district throughout the 
county each year. There never has been a year that these In- 
stitutes have not been held. We have called on the County 
Court, from time to time, and have received. liberal appropria- 
tions to carry on this Institute work. I also know, that in 
_ Giles County there were three Teachers’ Institutes held in that 
county, and also one in each civil district in the county. Of 
course I speak of these things that when we claim credit that this 
county is the only county in the State that has done such and such 
work, I desire to place it upon record, so that we may be very 
familiar with the county in which we live, and can be familiar 
with the counties in other parts of the State.” 
Superintendent Allen.— “I want to say, in connection with 
your remarks, that we have a record of a County Teachers’ 
_ Association as far back as 1866, and I have it from a responsible 
_ man, that the teachers organized on a small scale for mutual 
_ benefit, an Institute in that county, long before that organiza- 
tion out of which the Bedford County Teachers’ Institute 
_ grew.”

present school-law. We had nothing until after 1873. 
“Tam requested now to pass to Madison County. We will 
hear from Hon. Thos. H..Paine, in regard to the school-work 
in Madison County.” 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine: 
“Tt is unnecessary for me to say that Iam glad to meet with 
_ you and renew my acquaintance with many of you that I knew | 
in the years gone by. I congratulate you upon the opportunity 
_ you have of again meeting together and discussing these ques- 
_ tions in which we all feel a deep interest.

feel it my duty to respond to the call of the county, as you so 
kindly pass*certain counties to come to Madison in view of the 
fact that I will be engaged this afternoon. I will state, like 
the representatives from other counties, that I am able to see 
that great improvement is being made in Madison County. I 
am glad Drake is not here, because he is a modest fellow, and I 
do not believe he would indicate the real work that has been 
done since you were down there. He would think you would 
regard him as egotistical. But probably it may be that the 
progress is the result of the fact that we were so far back, so 
far in the rear, five or six years ago that a little work shows up 
well. I want to say to you that the rural schools are moving 
up in Madison County. We have quit going back to Gibson to 
see that the work is well done. We used to do that. 
“So far as the city schools are concerned—by the way, I see 
my friend Abernathy here, who passed a few hours in our 
schools yesterday. I will give him the other minute of my    
time to report of the city schools. I want to report that Super-" — 
- intendent Drake would have been glad to be with you, but cir- 
cumstances over which he had no control prevented him from 
attending.” 
Superintendent M. R. Abernathy : 
“T was in Jackson yesterday for about two hours, and I took 
Occasion to visit the South-western Baptist University and go 
through it, and also the public schools of which Captain Paine 
is Superintendent. I visited several large halls and many of 
the recitation-rooms, and I must say that it is a model school. 
I dare say that for discipline and thorough work, there is not a 
better school in the United States.”

AFTERNOON SESSION. 
Roll-call by counties was continued. 
M. R. Abernathy, Superintendent of McNairy: 
“J have nothing documentary in my report. I had just sat 
down to write a few points. We are doing very well in Mc-. 
Nairy County, and expect to do better. We have sustained 
Teachers’ Institutes in McNairy County ever since 1869, and 
regard the success of our schools in the county as largely due 
to the Institutes. We have kept the meetings up regularly in 
different portions of the county. Some seven or eight years 
ago State Superintendent Paine, together with Captain W. R. 
Garrett, Prof. A. P. Bourland of the Peabody Normal College, 
and 8. A. Mynders, educated at the university at Knoxville, 
held an Institute of one week in the county. It was liberally 
attended. Later Captain Frank M. Smith held an Institute of 
one week in our county. Last year I was able to hold an In- 
stitute of one month. I did not consult the Directors or any- 
body else about it, but announced that I would hold an Insti- 
tute of one month. Captain Garrett wrote me later, and asked 
_ me what I was doing about Institutes, and upon what fund I 
‘was relying to defray the expenses of same, and I wrote him 
that I relied upon my own personal pocket-book. He then sent

  me Captain Paine and P. H. Manning, of Montgomery Bell 
Academy, who held the last week of the month. We had a 
very large attendance. I find one thing in the way of public 
school education in the county, and that is in reference to the 
second-grade certificate. One of the reasons I came here was | ~ 
to get an expression from the County Superintendents in at- 
tendance in reference to that, and to encourage the State Super- 
intendent to eliminate the second-grade certificate. It is detri- 
mental to the success of the schools of the State, and-it is bet- 
ter that the schools should not be taught at all than taught by 
a second-grade teacher. 
“Again, I want to say that there has been warning enough to 
teachers for them to begin to prepare themselves to pass a sat- 
isfactory examination to obtain a first-grade certificate. At the 
proper time, I want to introduce some measure before this as- 
sembly in reference to Institutes. By all means encourage In- 
stitutes and the interest in Institute work. I wish we could 
make attendance at the Institutes, by statutory act, compulsory 
upon the teachers, and favor encouraging the Legislature to 
make an appropriation of money for the purpose of sending 
out vigorous men to talk to the people. Get men like Captain 
Garrett and Prof. A. P. Bourland to talk to the people and in- 
terest them in this work, and you will not need compulsion. 
P. L. Harned, Superintendent of Montgomery : 
‘““T represent to-day a county that is among the leading coun- 
ties of the State in public schools; one that has 11,300 pupils 
between the ages of 6 and 21, and one that has school property 
worth more than $50,000. Of these 11,000 pupils, there is an 
enrollment of more than 6,000, with a daily attendance of about 
4,000. We have in Montgomery County 107 schools and 128 
teachers. I want to say that the school-work in. Montgomery 
County is more satisfactory than it has ever been before. Our 
attendance this year is better than it has ever been—I suppose 
on account of such favorable weather. Another reason why we 
      have better schools in my county is on account of my predeces- |

_sor’s rigid examinations, forcing men who have been teaching 
in that county to leave the county and go to other fields of la- 
bor. Our grade of teachers is better, and our outlook generally 
is good, yet there are many things we might have that would 
improve our schools, and I think the time will come when many 
of these will be had. My first work last spring was to call a 
meeting of the Directors of the various districts to meet at 
Clarksville, and organized Montgomery County Educational 
Association, or rather Board, and, at your suggestion, we con- 
. sidered and adopted a uniform series of text-books. We, at 
_ that time, had no uniformity of text-books. We had quite a 
multiplicity of text-books in the county. This, I think, will 
help a great deal. We also prepared a graded course of study, 
in accordance with the instructions issued by our worthy State 
Superintendent, and many of our schools are being graded now. 
“As to our secondary and primary schools. We have estab- 
lished few secondary schools because we have endeavored to 
have two teachers for every secondary school, and we have only 
so much money in the county to run the schools with, and not | 
enough to have more than one teacher for many of the schools. 
Our County Court is taking steps for the improvement of our 
schools, I think, and, while that, perhaps, might do more for 
the advancement of education in our county, yet all the mem- 
bers of the County Court are not together on this point. Ido 
not think the matter has been properly presented to them, and 
they will doubtless be closer together when it is. 
  j “Last summer we called the teachers together in a Teachers’ 
Institute. It was well attended. Our State Superintendent 
‘sent some conductors to Clarksville to conduct the Normal In- 
stitute, and this, | think, was very beneficial to the teachers. 
Then our Deanty Institute for white teachers was well at- 
tended, and continues to meet. We have been holding Insti- 
tutes regularly throughout the county. At first these were not 
well attended. However, we have been meeting, and I think 
our attendance now is better. than it was in September. We 
expect to continue these meetings, and expect great results in 
” future. While Montgomery County has a school-term of

“ There are two things that render it embarrassing for me to ; 
respond to this meeting. It seems to come at a time when, a 
from all ocular demonstrations, the word “ honor” has dropped 
into innocuous desuetude. It is embarrassing to me again, 
should I allude to the progress in my county, lest I should seem 
to be casting a reflection on. my illustrious predecessor. It is 
embarrassing again, that our county does not number like some 
other counties we have heard, that claim to be among the ban- 
ner counties of the State. Our scholastic population is 8,633 ;. 
of this number, 4,458 are of Hamitic descent, and 4,175

lastic enumeration. The per cent. of attendance is about sev- _ 
enty-five of the enrollment. A few years ago we had County — 
Institutes, and took quite an interest in them. However,when 
the constitutional amendment was presented to the people of 
Tennessee, the teachers of the county, instead of giving their 
attention to the Institutes, turned out to make speeches in favor 
of the constitutional amendment. They were so overwhelm- 
ingly defeated that they have not, until last May, decided to — 
bring themselves to the front. They are now holding their In- 
stitutes, and meeting monthly. We held a Normal, the first — 
time in the history of the county, last July. These Normals — 
or County Institutes have been reasonably well attended. At. 
these meetings they are not looking so much into the matter of — 
facts in learning, as into the whys, wherefores, and, especially, — ‘ 
the hows. We have come to the conclusion that it is not — 
enough to know—to be acquainted with the facts and with 4 
science—but to know how to let others become acquainted with | 
these facts in the sciences. We regard education as a mental

  "growth, as a development of the character, and as the modus 
_ operandi by which the mind is developed. In regard to teach- 
ers attending Institutes, will say that I do not think we can 
compel them to attend. At the same time, I would urge upon 
them the importance of attending these Institutes. The ques- 
tion is, Why don’t you compel the teachers to attend the Insti- 
tute? The Superintendent, by calling for expressions, and 
gathering up from every soarce, makes this remark: ‘That 
time will properly adjust this matter, and feels that it will not 
take much time in this progressive age in which we live. 
_ They will soon be laid upon the shelf of oblivion, as specimens 
of an extinct age, because of their non-progressiveness.’ So, I 
do not know that I'am for leyislative enactment to compel 
teachers to attend the Institutes. I urge upon them to attend, 
and the time will come when they will be compelled to attend 
them, because the age will demand different things from us in 
~ the future, to what it has in the past. The time is coming | 
'when we must prepare ourselves for this work, or it will be 
taken from us and given into other hands.”   
  
  J.E. Ruffin, Superintendent of Robertson: 
“JT am glad to report that the schools of Robertson County 
are doing good work. We have good schools, and there are 
_ more children in the schools to-day than ever before. I think 
they are growing gradually every year in interest and useful- 
‘ness, and in favor with the people. The greatest trouble we 
have met with, is in grading our schools. However, appreciat- 
ing the importance of that, we are working steadily to that end, 
and we hope to succeed. 
      
    
      
       “We hold regular monthly Teachers’ Institutes in term time. 
During the vacations we hold two Annual Institutes of three 
_ or four weeks, one for white and one for colored teachers. Our 
County Court, for three years past, has levied twenty cents on 
the $100. The schools run from five to six months each year. 
he improvement is notable in the public school system in our 
unty. It is increasing in popularity with the people, and I~

believe the majority of the people would iliiiitil 
enough to run the schools longer than thahahiitubt 
   N. D. Overall, Superintendent of Ruthaayejnave

Raina wn “The county I represent comes sixth, L bi 1eve, 1 
population among the counties of Tennessee, and, if we take 
our schools into consideration, she is in the front in the way of 
education. I do not believe in a great number of schools. I 
am sorry to report that Rutherford County has so many 
schools. I hope that what I say I shall be able to say to the 
point, something that may have some meaning about it. There 
are two features I want to lay stress upon in reference to my 
county. One idea is that we ought to have fewer schools and 
better ones, and the other idea.is that our examinations should 
all/be in accordance with the request of our honored Superin- 
tendent. In representing my county, I shall try to represent it 
just as itis. We have done much in the way of improvement 
since the secondary school law was passed, that law which, I 
think, should be an honor and should cast honor upon our last 
Legislature, because J consider it the grandest act that Legis- 
lature passed.

“ We have a scholastic population of about 15,000; about 125 
primary, and about twenty secondary schools, united with the 
high schools, as they are called. We have secondary schools, 
many of them, because they are united with the high 
schools. These high schools have been built up, and we 
sustain a good list of them every year. I would prefer 
seeing this list of schools—145 in number—only about 100, 
and nearly half of them secondary schools. Our county 1s 
a case where they have departed from the civil school-dis- 
trict. We have our county divided up into school-districts. 
Ithink we have too many school-districts, it would be better’ 
if we had a smaller number of districts and a graded, or sec- 
ondary school, in every district in the county. 
“We held a summer Institute last summer. White attend- 
ance, eighty to one hundred. -The colored Institute had in at-       
-P-A-G-E-358
   
     Pusiic Scuoon Orricers’ AssoctaTIon. oo Ap   
  endance about eighty-five; and, as some one has remarked, in 
our county the colored teachers have been better in their at-— 
tendauce at the Institutes than the whites. After the Institute 
work was over, I ‘held an examination there and had quite a— 
number of applicants; in all, having issued near 250 certificates 
—quite a number of them ladies. I began by following the re- 
quest of our State Superintendent, and held these examinations 
once a month. Of course, at first we had a great deal of com- 
plaint, but after the teachers found that I meant business, they 
fell into line, and were ready at the first of the month. Now 
_ J think the teachers regard it as the better plan. 
  “Text-books have been adopted, both in the primary and, 
secondary departments. Our scholastic days taught last year, 
would average about four and one-half months. We have fif-. 
teen cents levied by the County Court, in addition to what is 
levied by the State. Last January we had some of the magis- 
trates there, who were very earnest in their endeavors to have 
the office of County Superintendent suspended ; and, if not, to 
reduce it as low as possible. However, with the aid of the sec- 
ondary school Jaw and the school Institutes, and the interest 
that is being manifested in school-work, we may be able to get 
the County Court to give us an additional tax in the near fut- 
ure, that will very much assist us in our school-work. One 
thing I do want to lay a good deal of stress upon, and that is, 
that we demand of our teachers that they attend the Peabody 
Normal, the Teachers’ Department of the University of Ten- 
nessee, at Knoxville, and other State Schools. If we had our 
_ teachers interested in preparing themselves thoroughly, as these 
schools propose to prepare them, they would do something that 
- would greatly aid us in our work; and I would that we could 
get more of our teachers into such schools.” 
Mrs. Thaxton, Superintendent of Sequatchie: \ 
  “We have in Sequatchie County a scholastic population of 
_ 1,177. Our schools are in a very good condition.. They have 
| _ continued longer the present year than they did last year. I 
have visited all of them and some of the private schools: We 
      
-P-A-G-E-359
    46 - Pustiic Schoot Orricers’ AssocraTIoNn. 
  
have adopted a uniform series of text-books. We have had In- 
stitutes, though they have not been very well attended. We 
have a good normal school in the county, where teachers 
can prepare themselves for secondary school work.” 
oC: Fowler, Superintendent of Stewart : 
“For the first time, I have the pleasure of meeting with this 
Association, not so much for the purpose of representing our 
county as for the purpose of receiving information that will, 
better enable us to do more for the schools of our county in the 
future. We have many disadvantages to contend with. Our 
county is composed of twelve civil districts and fifty-four 
school-districts, with a scholastic population, I believe, of 4,864. 
We have fifty-four white and sixteen colored schools. Early 
last spring we organized a teachers’ monthly meeting, which 
has been in progress and doing very good work. They are’ 
well attended. Last. July, Superintendent Douglass, of Gal- 
latin, Tenn., came down and held a Normal Institute for one 
week, which was the first thing of the kind ever held in the 
county. We think it did great good—not only that the teach- 
ers seemed to take a great interest in it, but the citizens also— 
and at its close a resolution was adopted asking the State Su- 
-perintendent to give us a, meeting and a State Normal in 
Stewart next year, and we have the promise of it. I have vis- 
ited nearly every school in the county, and found the schools to 
be doing well. While I cannot say to you that the schools in 
Stewart County are the best in the State, we’ feel that we are 
making progress, and that the prospects for the schools in 
Stewart County are brighter than they have been before.” 
' Miss Dora Harper, representing the Superintendent of Sum- 
ner County: 
“T was not expecting to be called upon to represent our 
county. Miss Malone was not able to attend to-day, but thought 
she would be able to come down to-morrow. Of course I can-

not give you an official report. This last summer we had an 
Institute—a two weeks’ Normal Institute—and I found quite a 
A change in the teachers attending this Institute and those at- 
tending Institutes four or five years before. I think one trouble 
~ in our schools is the change of teachers, aud I think one cause 
of that is that we have nof sufficient money to enable teachers 
: to prepare themselves for the work. In the country schools 
ourterms are short. Next summer our Superintendent con- 
- templates having an Institute of two months held in the county 
_ by which the teachers can prepare themselves better for the 
work. Our Superintendent regrets very much that she could 
not be with you.’ 
          
    R. L. Jones, Superintendent of White; 
“T am like the preacher on his first sermon. I appear before 
you for the first time in life to represent White County. Iam 
proud to have the honor to represent it, and proud to say that 
s it has been represented in the association of public school 
"officers ever since its organization. Superintendent Billingsley, 
one of the most energetic teachers of the State, was present at 
_ its organization, and was present at every meeting up to this 
one; andit is with much pleasure, though great embarrassment, 
_ that I represent White at this, the fifth annual meeting. We 
held in White County last year monthly meetings, which were 
wellattended. We held a two weeks’ summer Institute in the 
_ month of June, which was well ‘attended, enrolling one hun- 
4 dred and three teachers. This is more teachers than can get 
employment in White County. I doubt very much whether 
there is another county in the State that enrolls more teachers 
at its Institutes than it can give employment to during the 
summer. We also have a Directors’ organization, which meets 
annually in June, and at this organization we discuss the needs 
_ of the schools. Most of the Directors of White County have 
agreed among themselves to employ no teacher unless he attends 
the summer Institute, and that is all the legislation we need. 
_ Wehaye no trouble in White County in getting our teachers 
) attend the Institutes in full force.

“ We have a scholastic population of 4,950. On the question 
of secondary schools we have gone slow, from the fact that we 
have not the money to establish the secondary schools. While 
they are good in the rich counties where the per capita is $3 or 
$4, I believe their organization in the poor counties, where it is 
only $1 or $1.75, will do more harm than good, because there is 
no teacher in America who can spread himself over every thing 
from. A B C’s to geometry. When you organize secondary 
schools you ought to employ two teachers, and that would cut 
down the length of the term at least one-half. Our schools in 
White County run eighty-eight days. We have eighty teachers 
at work in our county at a salary of only $31.25. Our'per cap- 
ita in the county this year, though small, is better than some 
time ago. We have $1.75, and a few years ago the per capita 
was less than $1. One other thing we attempted to do was to 
reduce the number of the schools in White County. I do not 
think Superintendent Smith ever told a greater truth than 
when he said the organization of so many schools had done ~ 
more to retard their progress in some localities than could be 
repaired in a life-time. I reduced the number of schools from 
seventy to sixty-two, and hope next year to have fewer schools 
in the county than this. 
Secretary Goodman.—“ Mr. Chairman, there are several Su- 
‘perintendents who have notified me that they will be herein~ 
the morning ; and if the committees do any work this evening, 
_it is time they were getting at it, and, as’ we will have to take 
up the roll-call in the morning, I move an adjournment, so the 
committees can get together and discuss their subjects.”

J. A. Miller, Superintendent of Williamson : 
“This is my first time in this body, and 1 am here to repre- 
sent Williamson County. I claim no superiority for William- 
son County, but equality in many respects. We have a good 
system of public schools, and they have been better attended 
_ this fall than for several years, owing to the fact that we have 
been blessed with bountiful crops. Good crops and plenty of 
money are as essential to the success of the public schools as 
any other business in life. While we are blessed with good 
schools, I have labored continuously to make them better; and, 
gentlemen, I begin with the teachers to improve the schools. 
You must first improve your teachers. I have endeavored to 
improve all the teachers, and have given them to understand 
that they must be qualified before they can get my certificate to 
work as school-teachers. I have advised my Directors in the 
county to employ none but stout, able-bodied men and women, 
_ from the fact that I do not think any delicate, sickly individual 
ean teach school successfully. “No individual who cannot con- 
_ trol himself car control others, and I do not think it possible 
for a weak individual, who is constantly suffering with some 
malady of some kind, to control himself. 
“TJ have endeavored to create an interest in the public schools 
in my county and in my people, knowing that every school was 
composed of four different factors—the fathers and mothers of 
the children, the children themselves, the teachers, and the 
school-officers—aud it is necessary, to make a success of the 
schools, to have the co-operation of all these factors. I have
-P-A-G-E-363
  50 Pustic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTIoN. + 
talked to the children in every school in the county, and have 
tried to encourage them in all their efforts at learning; to stimu- 
late them tostudy and to be thorough in every thing they study; 
to have the moral courge to lock their teachers in the face, 
when they do not understand any thing, and tell them they do 
not understand it, and to insist upon an explanation. My 
_ county affords every child in the county, regardless of color, a 
_ good primary education, and I am endeavoring to get every one 
to take advantage of it; for I conceive it is a fact that intelli- 
gence is power, as labor is capital, and it matters not how well 
equipped our children may be to tight the battles of life, the 
schools will tax them to the fullest extent, and prove to them 
the intrinsic value of attending them. 
“T am authorized by the people of Franklin and the county 
of Williamson to extend to each and every one here present; 
teachers and every one interested in the cause of education, an 
invitation to meet with us in Franklin on December 28 to 31, 
inclusive, at the State Teachers’ Institute. I would be glad to 
see you. 
“Tt is needless to say to you, gentlemen, that I am happy to 
be with you, and for many reasons, one thing in particular; 
I have met here an old class-mate, whom I have met but.three 
times since we left school, in 1858, and that is Thos. H. Paine. It 
carries me back to my boyhood days. We had a large class, 
and he and I are the only two remaining that I know of now.

population of 10,419. Out of this number, 7,000 were enrolled 
e public schools this fall. We have 131 schools, and we 
employ 148 teachers, at an average salary of $36 per month. 
The average length of our school-term is four months, and the 
average cost of tuition per month per pupil is eighty-five cents. 
Our Directors are men of more intelligence than formerly, and 
they watch the school-interests of our county better than ever 
before. Our teachers are mostly young men who are live, act- 
ive, energetic, and full of zeal for the cause. We are doing 
every thing we can to improve our teachers. We held a Teach- 
_ ers’ Institute of ten days’ duration, and we have held a monthly 
meeting for the improvement of our teachers. We believe that 
the intelligence of our Directors and the improyement of our 
eachers means the success of our schools. Our primary schools 
are progressing finely, and our secondary schools remind me 
very much of an anecdote I had told me relative to Dr. Price’s 
school for young ladies here in this city. It was said that a 
“country man was in Nashville for his first trip, and was looking 
atthe large buildings, and would inquire of every one he met, 
‘What is this large building?’ So, he finally came along the 
street close up to Dr. Price’s school; he accosted a stranger, 
and said: ‘Here! what is this building?’ He was told that it 
_ was Dr. Price’s High School. He gazed up at it, and then said: 
‘Twill be plagued if it ain’t a high school!’ So, this is the 
_ way with our secondary schools. They are not only good, but 
very good. Our Directors are doing every thing they can to 
enforce the new school-law. It does not give satisfaction in 
every ‘respect, but we think that some aan results will come 
from this new school-law. What we want in our county is not 
_ for the ‘Legislature to place her fingers upon our County Court 
districts, but to give us more money. What we want is more 
money, that we may be enabled to continue our school-term 
onger. Now, we have had some little! trouble in our county 
over making legislative school districts. We believe these 
- school-distriets ought to be under the supervision of our County 
Court. It isa local matter, and we think our people right there 
know a great deal more about our interests, what is for our best — 
nterests, than the Legislature. is

-P-A-G-E-365
? 
52 Pousnic Scuoon Orricers’ AssocraTIon. 
  have visited 116. I believe, upon the whole, that the schools 
of Wilson County will compare favorably with those of any 
other county in the State. In fact, when Wilson County comes~ 
to compete for a valuable scholarship with her sister counties, 
like she did this year, she generally comes off victorious, as she 
did in the contest for the Peabody scholarship this year. We 
are always sure of success in Wilson County.” 
Miss Nellie O’ Donnell, Superintendent of Shelby : 
~The public schools of Shelby County steadily improve in 
numbers, efficiency, and prosperity; and, with the additional 
accommodations which have been made in our buildings in the 
past five or six months, we will be sure to find things greatly 
improved. Our School Directors have met us in our efforts in 
regard to secondary schools; hence, we have twelve high schools 
for white children, and three for colored children. I think the 
children of Shelby County have their full share of benefits 
from the public school system, and to a great extent are avail- 
ing themselves of those benefits. 
“Our scholastic population is 44,000. We have eighteen 
civil districts and nineteen school-districts, and over 200 schools, 
146 of which I have visited this year. Our average school-term 
is eight and one-half months.” : 
J.C. Price, Superintendent of Macon: 
“JT happened to very bad luck day before yesterday—got 
wrecked on the stage coming down here. I was here two years .

bly as is here this morning. I feel that I ought to be here. I

which I had the honor to be the first president. Aside from 
this, and the purpose of the Association, of course, there is a 
delicate and kindly interest attached to it. I am glad to know 
that the teachers of the State of Tennessee, and of the South, no 
longer stand secondary as an order or as a profession: Iam 
glad, Mr. President, that the time is present when pedagogy, or 
the teacher’s profession, is known as a profession, and not as an 
avocation. Iam glad, Mr. President, this morning, that I see 
people here from over the mountains of Hast Tennessee, and 
that Isee them from West Tennessee, and from Middle Tennes- 
see, denoting harmony of purpose and a determination to carry 
forward the work in which we are engaged.

The State needs it. I believe I have been over the State from 
one end to the other, or nearly so, in the last twelve years, in 
Institute work, and I think we need it; and I think our present : 
President is up on that point. Sumner County stands right up. — 
to the front. We have elected a lady as County Superintend- _ 
ent, and she is in her buggy every day, driving over hills and 
dales and meeting the people, and performing her work well. 
There is no use to say that women County Superintendents do _ 
not do good work. She is the next best Superintendent to me _ 
in the State that I know of. [Laughter and applause.] Iam ; 
sorry she is not here to-day. She invited Mr, Trousdale and 
myself to make speeches to her school. I got up a great big 
speech. I did not write it, but I thought it over and took ~ 
notes, and had a big, very fine speech, and Mr. Trousdale did | 
the same thing. When we got there, after the children got — 
through with their exercises, I was called upon, and got up and j 
made a fine speech, and Mr. Trousdale came after me and made 
a better. Miss Pattie Malone followed him, and she beat both — 
of us. That is just what she did,'and that is the reason I say ‘ 
she is a fine Superintendent; and Sumner, Mr. President, is 
right in the front. She always indorses the State Superintend- _ 
from beginning to end, and you know it, Captain Garrett. ‘ 
“We are establishing secondary schools throughout the — 
county, and our graded schools, as you know, Mr. Chairman, — 
are in good shape. I attribute this success to the ladies under _ 
my charge doing the work in charge of the school. Now, in 
conclusion, for I want to be heard, and am going to be heard ~ 
again, I say that I am glad to see your countenance here. You * 
look well. Ithink two of the most successful and happiest — 
women I know of are Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Douglass, and you 
think so too. Iam glad to see the melancholy countenance of 
my friend Goodman, but he doesn’t mean any thing by that at | 
~ all. He is a good man and a good secretary, and the most — 
modest man we have ever had. Ta

see that our people are in the work.’ [Applause.] 
  D. C. Hill, Superintendent of Jefferson : 
   I hisa surprise to me to be here. I had made arrangements 
to come, but, on account of the sickness of my brother, thought 
it would be impossible to be here until Monday, so that [ have 
no speech prepared to make to you this morning. I can tell 
you little about the-schools of Jefferson County, as this is my

deal about the schools all over the county. I was a teacher 
four years before I was elected County Superintendent. I-sup-

but, I want to say that while they are getting along so well, I 
am not satisfied with the public schools of Jefferson County. 
" Iknow they can be made better. There is room for improve- 
ment. The greatest lack I find in the county, is to get the 
~ patrons of the schools to take an interest in them; and if there 
is any member of this convention who can tell me how to get 
the patrons worked up so they will take an interest in the 
schools, I will be more than obliged to him for it. Jefferson 
- County, as President Smith is aware, has sixty- -three school-’ 
districts. It is a disadvantage to our county, and has been for 
years. I succeeded in getting President Smith to meet with 
our Court at the October term, and they changed the school- 
districts and made them idehtigaly: the same as the civil dis- 
icts, and I think it will add to the success of the schools of 
the county. It will enable us to establish secondary schools, °

and raise the standard of our schools to a higher and better 
grade than at present. The schools of Jefferson County are in 
number eighty-four, and I am glad to say that I have been to 
every one of them since school opened in August, and some of 
them two or three times. I have made short talks to most of 
the schools during the school-year. Up to the present I have 
held five Institutes, three for whites and two for colored teach- 
ers. I find that the colored schools of our county, so the 
teachers tell me, have been’ neglected to a great extent. They 
tell me they never have had a County Superintendent of our 
county to meet with them before at their Institutes, until this 
year. I told them if they wished to organize an Institute and 
meet once a month, I would always try to be with them. They 
have held a few Institutes, and I wish to say in this connection 
. that the per cent. of attendance on their Institutes has been 
better than that of the whites. Our Institutes have had fifty 
per cent. better attendance this year than heretofore. I find 
that the colored people of our county are complaining .a great 
deal, and I think it is the duty of the County Superintendents 
to look after their interests as well as the whites.” 
President Smith : 
“We have with us this morning perhaps the only Superin- 
tendent of city schools who has been longer in the harness in 
that line in the State of Tennessee than any other man in the 
State—H. D. Wyatt, Superintendent of the city schools of | 
Chattanooga. Iam glad to introduce him to you, and shall be 
glad to hear from him.” 
H, D. Wyatt: 
“As has been said, lam here from the city of Chattanooga. I 
do not represent all of Hamilton County. Mr. Huffaker does 
that.- I come from that city which has become a household 
word all over the South. Mr. President, behold Chattanooga, 
as she sits in the shadow of Lookout Mountain, a gem on the 
beautiful southern shore of the Tennessee River. Education-

ally, we have eleven schools—four primary, four grammar, and 
three high schools—and all her children have the privilege of 
education from the primary grade to the higher studies, includ- 
ing Latin, German, physics, and higher mathematics. We also 
have had a full-fledged and equipped manual training-school 
for six years. We have also one regular six years full course 
of study. We also have three divisions from the grammar and 
high school grades which take training, but have no regular 
work for them. We hold teachers’ meetings, and we meet with 
them. Of course, the colored and white teachers meet sepa- 
rately. We have been holding two meetings a month in each 
_ division this fall. We have a regular programme of work, in- 
cluding pedagogy, arithmetic, current history, and other topics 
that may come up. We have in connection with our schools a 
regular teacher of music, drawing, etc. So you see, Mr. Pres- 
ident, that educationally we are in the work to stay, and I know 
that our schools are popular. I like to refer to this, and com- 
pare them with those of other cities in Tennessee. If I were 
notin Nashville, I might speak of Chattanooga as the great 
railroad and future center of the South, but as I am in Nash- 
ville, I will not say that. But in regard to the enrollment in the 
public schools, there is not another State in the South that will 
compare with the State of Tennessee. You can make your own 
comparison, and,*if you will go into our schools, you will find 
it as] have, who have made the comparison. I like to speak 
of these things, because the people in the North and West do 
not think we have any schools. You can go through Ohio 
and Indiana and those States up there, and in cities of the same 
size you will not find the same enrollment we have in Chatta- 
nooga in our public schools, or as we have had in the last ten 
or fifteen years. I speak of this to show you that the schools 
are booming in Chattanooga. We have the record. I can give 
you the figures, and you can look at them and see if I am cor- 
rect. 
“Tam glad to meet with you this morning. Possibly you 
_ may hear from me a little later on, as I am on a committee.” 
Superintendent M. R. Abernathy.— If in order, I would like 
to introduce a short resolution. It is as follows: 
17s. p.1.—Ap. E. 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  58 Pusuic Scuoon Orricers’ AssocraTIon. 
  
“<*Resolved, That it is the sense of the State meeting of the 
public school officers of Tennessee, now in session at Nashville, 
that the State Superintendent be requested to discontinue s sec- 
ond-grade certificates.’ ” 
President Smith.—‘ That would properly go to the Commit- 
tee on Resolutions. Let it be referred to the Committee on 
Resolutions. 
“ We have with us the Superintendent of city schools of Pu- 
laski, Mr. A. S. Abernathy.” 
Mr. Abernathy : 
“TJ was not aware of the fact that City Superintendents would 
be called on for three-minute speeches, or would have had my 
wife write me one before I left home. I am glad, for one 
time, that I am a school Superintendent. I am glad, too, to 
say that I hail from a queen city. Iam sorry, too, that I can- 
not say that I hail from Lookout Mountain or the beautiful 
city of Chattanooga; but I am glad that I can say I hail from 
the city of Pulaski, in which there is an established city school. 
I will say just here, for the County Superintendent failed to 
speak of the fact, that I am not here to blow my own horn, but 
Iam the best City Superintendent in Giles County. I do not 
not know what I can talk to you about, unless I talk to you of 
my school. 
“«Twenty-odd years ago we had a school in Pulaski known as 
Giles College, under the able management of three of the most 
distinguished educators of the South. Giles College havin 
been first raised to honor, name, and fame that will long live in 
the hearts of the people of Giles County, but in the midst of 
her prosperous and successful career, that child of destiny, our 
public school system, came sweeping south and borrowed from 
Giles College her faithful captain, and placed him as County 
Superintendent of Giles County public schools. Like the far- 
sighted man he has always shown himself to be, he caught the 
inspiration, and has struggled onward and upward until to-day — 
he stands as our beloved and respected State Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-372
  Pusiic Scnoon Orricers’ AssocraTION. 59 
  
Next, this child of destiny came to Pulaski to select another of 
her venerable and respected teachers in the person of Col. C. Y. 
Rogers, and placed him at the head of one of the best schools 
of this beautiful and famous city of schools. . The last of these 
three distinguished educators was one whose delicate relation- 
ship to myself forbids my pride in speaking of him. He was 
my father, the last one left to the old college, who took the 
Superintendency of Giles County, the place vacated by our gal-— 
lant Captain. So yousee that Giles College, after a struggle of 
eight or ten years, withereth and dieth, and, while that deli- 
ceately-nurtured child does not live, it has been born again and 
rechristened under the name of the City School of Pulaski. I 
am proud, as one of the pupils of those able educators, to be 
here to represent her 449 of the brightest and happiest children 
in this beautiful Southland, now drinking inspiration at the 
fountain. Nine competent teachers are there now to give them 
instruction. So, Iam proud to say that I hail from Giles County. 
Tam glad to say that we, in our humble way, are trying to fol- 
low in the footsteps of those able educators who have gone be- 
. fore. Weare here to do what we can for the public school 
system. We are with you with our might and main.” [Ap- 
plause. | : 
Mr. Charles, Superintendent city schools of Columbia: 
“T came here for the first time to meet with this Association, 
and as a stranger to you all. I came from that beautiful little 
city only forty or fifty miles away—a little city that seems to 
‘me to have more business for its size than any other I have ever 
see. I went North after spending my boyhood in East Ten- 
nessee, in old Hawkins. I went into the North-west, and was 
there sixteen years. I think our secretary will remember a 
Joke they had on me at Toronto last summer, that some of them 
liked better than I did. I hunted up the Southern head- 
quarters, and, if I am not mistaken, our secretary introduced 
me as the prodigal son returning home. 
“Tam glad again to be numbered with the citizens and edu- 
cators of Tennessee. I have been in Columbia only a short

time, and cannot say a great deal ot the schools. So far as the 
schools of the county ate concerned, I am, comparatively speak- 
ing, unacquainted with them at all. I tind there is among the 
teachers of Columbia a spirit of co-operation, and, while in my 
stay in the North-west I have acquired some ideas that do not 
exactly harmonize with the teachers of the South, we are get- 
ting along, so far as I am able to see, smoothly and nicely, 
without a great deal being said about the public school work. 
I will state here that when a remark was made not long ago 
that I did not hear much said about the public schools, I was 
informed that I should consider myself fortunate at not hearing 
about them; that if they were going well, I would not hear 
about them, and that if’ they were. not going well, I would be 
likely to hear it. There is a reading-course I see among the 
teachers that is telling on the advancement of the children. 
We have those in the schools who defend this course. 
“Mr. Chairman, I want to call attention to one thing that 
I have met at Columbia, and, so far as I have been over the 
different places in the State, it seem to be prevalent in the State. 
A thing, if. right, I hope to harmonize, but which I cannot see 
is right, so speak against it. 
“There seems to be a feeling that the girl-pupils are angels— 
I have no objections to that whatever—but that the boys have 
all the meanness there is in the world. Now, Mr. Chairman 
and Superintendents, I do not know how you find it among 
your pupils, but I find them so strongly filled with this idea 
that they do not rise to the point they would if they realized 
that people expected something of them. I do not know how 
you find it, but I do know that at our last teachers’ meeting I 
became so aroused on this subject that I spoke in very strong 
language, and I said, from the way we hear these girl-pupils 
spoken of as angels—and I have no objections to that at all— 
they will grow up, and granted that these little demons—that is 
the language’we sometimes hear used in regard to the boys— 
will grow up, these girls must select their husbands from among 
these boys. Now, if this be true, I believe they ought to be put 
on an equal footing, and as much expected of the boy; and the
-P-A-G-E-374
    
boy given to understand that there is as much expected of him 
as of the girl. I did not expect to speak of this, but this is one 
of the things that has taken hold of me since my work com- 
menced there, and if I am wrong, I hope to be harmonized. I 
do not remember this to be so when I was a boy, growing up in 
East Tennessee, and I hope it is not so in other towns. I hope 
it will be removed, and that the boys will come to feel and to 
know that the teacher expects as much of him, in purity of life, 
as he expects from the girls.” 
President Smith : , 
“ We have with us some educational journalists, and I intro- 
duce to you the representative of the South-western Journal of 
Education, Mr. D. G. Ray.” 
Mr. Ray : 
“Tam sure the President means it as a kindness to us pro- 
fessional newspaper men, but I do not know what to say to you. 
I have no personal claims to press upon you—I am not en- 
gaged with the business interests of the paper—and I know not 
what to say to you. I will simply say this. If you and your 
teachers need a journal of education, and I am sure you will 
agree with me that you do need a school-paper, I believe 
the South-western Journal of Education is the best paper you can 
get in the State. I[ can say this, because I have no pecuniary 
interest in it. However, as the President insists that I talk to 
you, I should like to have you think of this journal as much as 
possible. ‘This is the only interest I have in it—that it is the 
best in the State. It needs no argument to an intelligent County 
Superintendent, that his teachers should read educational pa- 
‘pers. I believe I want to say one thing further. I do not be- 
lieve that the educational journal is the most valuable to the 
school-teacher, which devotes all of its attention to methods in 
teaching. I do not believe that. I believe the field of the 
school-journal is altogether in that line, but it appeal to his un- Pusitc Scnoot Orricers’ ASsocraTION. 6L ae

derstanding and to his intelligence. If I were to branch out a 
little further, I would say that I do not have the greatest possi- 
ble respect for so much of the methods in school-work. I be- 
lieve first and best is a liberal education, and I do not believe 
that a teacher who does not know what to teach, can ever learn 
how to teach. 
M. R. Abernathy : 
“T desire to say in regard to the South-western Journal of Hdu- 
cation, that I have been a careful reader of that paper ever since 
‘its inception. It has been a steady growth, and, in my estima- 
tion, it is a most excellent journal—-the best I have’seen, either 
South or North. I will say this, that it is the best journal of 
education I have ever seen, and it is growing better from week 
to week. I think it is pre-eminently the best journal in the 
South, at least.” 
Prof. Smith : 
“JT take pleasure in introducing to you Superintendent 
Bryan, of the Sweetwater city schools, and also editor of the 
Teachers’ Head-light.” 
Mr. Bryan : 
“JT had better commence my Sweetwater speech before I 
commence my Head-light speech. I want to say that I do not 
come to this Association to be a stumbling-block in the way of 
sinners, nor to sit in the seat of the scornful. I sometimes 
think that was a prudent, good old man who could find some- 
‘thing good about everybody, and would say something good 
about everybody. The boys thought they had him bothered 
one day when the worst man in the community died, and went 
to report it to him, to see what he would say. He said: ‘I am 
sorry to hear of that ; he was such a good whistler.’ Iam go- 
ing to fallinto line with this Association—the press and the pub- 
lieschools of Tennessee. Isee that they are good whistlers. I

assure you I despise grumblers, but I am forced to believe, with 
the facts and figures before us in this Association, that we are 
overestimating just where we are in educational institutions in 
this State. It is one point for a few of the leading educators of | 
the State to meet here and discuss questions and pass resolu- 
tions; it is quite another thing to get into the actual work. 
Look into the rural districts, where they are teaching for their 
victuals and clothes-making and mending, and a horse to ride 
on Sundays—this is quite a different thing to go into those dis- 
tricts and see the schools. How true it is that in many respects 
we are the grandest State in the Union. We can boast of our 
resources. It has been said that the neigh of the iron-horse 
can be heard in almost every home in the State. We are build- 
ing cities almost in a day, and unlocking the iron treasures of the 
mountains—just as soon as we can form a syndicate, we are go- 
ing to have these things at our command. I say, materially we 
are a great State, and we have iaany things educationally that 
we can hoast of. Here is your Vanderbilt, that reaches out to 
China, and whose influence is felt all over the land. We have 
a grand monument at Knoxville. It is on a hill, and can never 
be hid, and you will continue to feel its influence on and on. 
Here is the Peabody Normal College, grinding out teachers al- 
most at the rate of one a minute. We have many female col- 
leges and seminaries in our State—at Knoxville, Chattanooga, 
and Memphis, and the city schools of this place and others you 
might mention—and from all this it appears that we are march- 
ing on to greater victories. 
“Our object here to-day is to look after the great body of 
children of Tennessee who depend upon the public schools for 
their educational future. I regard the great inefficiency of our 
public schools as due to the fact that it is left mainly to the 
County Courts to say just how much rations the child shall eat 
intellectually, and they say they shall have just so much. We 
have plenty of members of the County Courts who will go to 
heaven, but you had better meet some of them here. It is left. 
to them to say just. how much money shall be levied. With 
the facts aud figures before us, they say just enough to run the 
schools an average of four months in the year, with the average
-P-A-G-E-377
64 Pusuic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTIon. 
  
salary of the teachers $30 a month. We sometimes fuss about 
the standard grade of our teachers. I tell you you cannot buy 
any thing but a Texas pony with $30. I tell you it is money 
we need. When we get money, then you get good teachers. 
When you get money, you get good houses and furniture. We 
will not be troubled about these things when these counties all 
have plenty of money. One Superintendent says money is no 
longer an object with him. It is not, because he has plenty of 
money. It is with us, because we have not. I tell you that 
the hero of the future will be the man or woman who will se- 
cure more money for the public schools of Tennessee. I. feel 
that this is what is needed in order tu make our schools a great 
success. 
“One other point I will mention here and now, and that is 
this: In the face of these facts and figures, which cannot be de- 
nied, a few of the solons of this State have established what we 
call the connecting link. They have established a system of 
secondary schools. This is the best thing that has ever been 
done to draw the money from the primary schools and from the 
children of the State. Inasmuch as this arrangement has been 
made in the State of Tennessee, the Teachers’ Head-light stands 
opposed to it from the very beginning, and I want to let you 
know exactly where we stand. I say it is our duty, in the sight 
of God and for the children of the State, to look after the chil- 
dren first. At Knoxville, where they have a good school sys- 
tem, and have had for twenty years, they are in good shape. 
Over among the mountains, where the school-term averages 
four months, and the teachers’ salary $30, they now establish 
secondary schools and draw out of this money. I claim that it 
is an injustice to the children of the State of Tennessee that 
such arrangements have been made, unless we had more money. 
I do not suppose this will hurt any thing for about twenty 
years, as it has taken twenty years to understand the present 
law, and this will not go into effect until about 1911, I believe, 
the way I have figured it. 
“There is one other point I want to mention, and then I will 
come to the Head-light proper. There was a kind of a breeze 
started from the Great Lakes, which has been gradually spread-
-P-A-G-E-378
      Pusiic Scoot Orricers’ Association. 65 
ing over the South. A great reform movement. A great reform 
in educational work. Grand ideas of progress. That breeze 
says we must rule our schools in the South by love, and have 
allthe new methods. It don’t matter if a little child comes up 
crying and fighting, and calling the teacher names, the teacher 
must not punish that boy, but just kiss him and love him a lit- 
tle. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this may sound like play~ 
house talk to you, but I tell you the time has come, that when 
a boy needs a genteel thrashing, and gets it, the matter gets 
. into the newspapers as a tragedy, and gets into our courts as a 
great violation of the law. I regard it as a fact that a great 
many of our reforms, as we call them, have done nothing but 
deform our system here in the South. 
“Mr. President, you can mark that speech number one. 
“Tam glad to have the honor to come from the grand old 
town of Sweetwater and to represent the Teachers’ Head-light. 
Tam going to talk the matter over with you from a business 
point of view, and then you can choose. The speaker who has 
just preceded me has shown you some of the benefits of a jour- 
nal of education. I will not discuss that. Any teacher that is 
any account is going to take an educational journal, and will 
take more than one journal. I will not stop to discuss that 
issue. I know a great many teachers, especially of this Asso- 
ciation, who consider themselves no ‘ two-fers,’ as you call them, 
who feel that they cannot take any thing but a New England 
journal of education, published away up there where they 
nearly freeze to death. It is all right tor you to take that- 
You ought to take that, but you ought not to stop with that. 
You ought to take a home paper, which will present things to 
you as they are here in the State. I have been talking with 
the representative of the Southern Teacher, and wanted to get 
an opportunity to talk with the South-western Journal repre- 
sentative, but did not, until just now. I want to present this 
matter to you, but we cannot get along without the support of 
the County Superintendents. We cannot afford not to have 
the Superintendents support us. We want to get the papers 
introduced into your counties. We have been sending a few of 
you sample copies, but it is a great expense to us to keep you
-P-A-G-E-379
66 Pustic Scuoot Orricers’ Association. 
  
up on sample copies the whole year. [Applause.] Just one 
other point. Here is what we want to do. We want all of 
you to take it. We know you are burdened with a great many 
papers, and we are going to put it down on a basis where you 
can afford to take it. That is the only way to get our papers 
advertised. I have made arrangements with Professor Huff- 
aker, but have not with the South-western Journal of Education. 
The price of the Head-light is 75 cents a year; the Southern 
Teacher $1 a year. Huffaker and I, with our warm hearts, 
broad views, and great sympathy and love for the teachers, - 
both men and women, have decided to put the two papers to 
you at 50 cents each, $1 for the two. NowTI am ready to pre- 
sent the matter to you in a business way. I have just received 
a proposition from the representative of the Sowth-western Jour- 
nal, and I am ready to put the matter to you in this way: We 
want you to give us your names and addresses, and we want 
you to pay us for the paper now, if you have money enough to 
pay your hotel bills and get home too; but, if you have not, 
you can pay for it when delivered We know you are good for 
it when we get it. Iam ready to make you this proposition. 
If you want all three of the papers, you can have the Head-light 
and Southern Teacher at 50 cents each and the South-western 
Journal of Education at 75 cents. If you only want the first 
two, you can have them for $1, or the Journal alone for 75 
_ cents. Each of the others at 50 cents. This is plain enough for 
‘a man with a wooden head to understand it. Even Burke un- 
derstands that. I want to say that my friend Burke is a good 
man. I want you all to take it, teachers and pupils; every- 
body, regardless of politics or previous condition of servitude.” 
[Laughter.] 
Prof. Smith : 
“We also have with us the representative of the Southern 
Teacher, Superintendent Huffaker. We shall be glad to hear 
from him.” 
Superintendent Huffaker: 
“«T do not know that I object to this call. I am glad to have
-P-A-G-E-380
    ‘Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTIoN. 67 
  
the opportunity of speaking to you. I have been with you five 
times, and have never said any thing of the Southern Teacher. 
Five years ago, when I began this as a county paper, I did not 
expect it to go out of the county. It has grown until now it 
reaches about twenty-two States and a few territories. Iseldom 
ask anybody to subscribe for my paper, as I feel that it should 
stand or fall upon its own merits. I want the support and co- 
operation of all Superintendents and teachers. Iam glad Su- 
perintendent Bryan made his speech. If any of the teachers 
want to take the Southern Teacher, and have not the money at 
the time, we shall be glad to send it, to be paid for when con- 
venient. If you will help the Southern Teacher it will help you. 
In unity there is strength. I appeal to the teachers of this 
Association to maintain the journals of the State, and help make 
them better. As they grow better, the interest in public educa- 
tion will increase.” 
E. M. Wright, Superintendent of Greene: 
“Tam here in the interests of Greene County. In Greene 
County, at this time, we need more money, we need better 
teaching, and we need better school-houses. We need longer 
school-terms, and we need better accommodations in school- 
houses; in fact, we need a great many things, though we are 
making considerable progress in educational work, and are do- 
ing reasonably well. But I do not think the schools of Greene 
County will ever be what they ought to be until we have afund 
sufficient to procure the best brain in the market and place it 
in our schools, and hold it there. We are getting along very 
well in our county with our Institutes. We have monthly 
meetings, and they are growing day by day. Our last Institute 
enrolled something near 200. Mr. Chairman, I will say further 
that public sentiment is decidedly favorable to public education. 
We mean to make our schools better. I desire to tell you this 
morning that I have been making head-quarters, for the past ten 
weeks, in the saddle. I am just out of the saddle, and meet 
with you in the interests of the public schools and the cause of 
public education.”

“T know Superintendent Bryan very well, and know that he 
speaks out what he thinks, but Iam not willing that the re- 
marks he made in regard to the ‘connecting links,’ as he sees 
fit to call the secondary schools, shall pass unnoticed. I, there- 
fore, ask the Committee on Resolutions, if they see fit, and, if 
they do not, some one else to introduce a resolution either in- 
dorsing or opposing this ‘ connecting link,’ as it has been called 
—the secondary school. I take this time to say that I am 
heartily in favor of the secondary school, and I know there are 
others. However, we will not discuss that question. I am not 
willing for it to pass without having an expression from the 
teachers and County Superintendents.

some knowledge of the ‘ Hermitage,’ Andrew Jackson’s home. 
These items of information may give you something you do not

Superintendent Paine: 
“T want to say that we have with us this morning a gentle-

a County Superintendent or a State Superintendent, yet he is

_ great. We have aschool of about 160 pupils, and have engaged 
in our school three teachers. I think that in the near future 
we will have a city school. As has been said, our school ranks 
in work with the city schools. Ourschool ranks second to none 
in West Tennessee. We have three teachers, and our school is 
graded. We have a music class (and that, of course, would not

going on nicely, and is well paid for, on the subscription plan. 
We pay our assistants $50 a month. I just mention this to 
show you that the people in our town want good work and they 
cave perfectly willing to pay for it. I came here this morning 
not expecting to be called upon to represent my school in any

“The Superintendent from Jefferson County has asked a

arouse an interest among the people of the county. I will sug- 
gest this answer. It was given me by Hon. Jas. R. Deason, 
former Superintendent of Gibson County. When I was first 
elected to the office, I stepped into his office one day, and asked 
_ him concerning his method of creating an interest among the 
people. He is devoting his time to the law. He scratched his 
head and said: ‘TI have forgotten all about what I did do, but 
_ one thing I do know that will arouse an interest in public 
schools. You get a horse and cart and go out among the peo- 
_ plein the country, and talk school to them.’ So far as I have 
_ carried his suggestion out, I have found it to work admirably.”

Superintendent Burke.—“As the Chairman of the Committee

The motion carried, and the report of the Committee on Free 
Text-books was taken up and unanimously adopted, as follows :
-P-A-G-E-386
  Pusric Scuoot Orricers’ ASsocraTION. 73 
  
“Report or Commrrren on Free TxExt-Books. 
It is presumed the object of this committee is to report | 
whether or not the State should furnish text-books to the pupils 
who attend the public schools of Tennessee free of charge. 
It is not deemed necessary in this report to give all of the 
reasons for reporting adversely upon the subject of free text- 
books in the public schools of the State. 
. We have a system of public schools in the State. While we 
do not regard it as perfect, yet, through this system, much is 
being done toward educating the mass of the people; nor is it 
expected to solve this vexed question of text-books. 
Next to the teacher, the text-book stands in closest relation 
to the advancement of our schools. The text-book is to the 
school what machinery is to a complete industrial process. 
Some of the many reasons for Tennessee not having free 
text-books are: That there is not a sufficient school-fund pro- 
vided by the State to have free schools, much less free text- 
books. Let the State furnish school-books, and our schools and 
school-system would wither and fall to the ground. Especially 
would it be so in those counties of the State whose people have, — 
by a systematic course of taxation, established a magnificent 
school-fund, and are building and fostering a mighty system of 
public schools, in which are being educated the rank and file of 
the people—the people of the country—the bone and sinew of. 
the land, upon whose education and culture depends the pros- 
perity and advancement of the Church and State. 
Free text-books means inferior text-books, which we do not 
want. It is not true that all new books are equally meritorious, 
and may, therefore, be used with equal advantage. 
There are the same differences in text-books as in other 
literary productions, and their use will meet with correspond- 
ing success. Some text-books are exceedingly good, others in 
the same proportion bad, which gives space for all shades be- 
18 s. p.1.—Ap. B.

tween the extreme. It may be said, in reply to this, that a 
good teacher should be able to give instruction from any text- 
book, or even without one. This, in a measure, may be true; _ 
but, as it is a fact that pupils derive the greater part of their in- 
formation from books, hence the necessity for having the best. 
Text-books become old. We live in an advanced age, great 
discoveries in science are being made, and the boundaries 
of human knowledge are ever enlarging. 
What we need is not free text-books, but competition in text- 
books, and we have that. The prosperity of our schools as a nation 
is due, in a great measure, to the enterprise and liberality of 
American publishers, who have fostered and almost created the 
authorship of text-books which are a credit to our age and 
country, for it is a fact that the school-books of our country 
have no superior. Competition drives poor books from the — 
market. ¢ - : 
Then, again, we'do not want free text-books, because we 
do not need them. The people of Tennessee are not paupers. 
They believe in a system of free schools, but they also believe 
in the policy of helping themselves—that which is not worth an 
effort, a sacrifice, is not worth possessing. Tennesseans are not 
so poor that'they need, expect, or ask the State to furnish their 
children books. Living, as they do, in a State that has such.

posed of a people who are characteristic for their pluck, energy, 
and enterprise, endowed with strong intellect, brave and coura- 
geous; whose forefathers have contributed largely toward shap- 
ing and forming the structure upon which rest, our nation— 
with our people, and with our resources, do we need free text- 
books? ‘

The report of the Committee on Examinations and Promo- 
tions was next taken up. 
‘The report, after some discussion by Mr. H. D. Wyatt and

adopted, as follows: 5

: Report oF Commirrer oN EXAMINATIONS AND Promotions. 
Mr. Prestpenr—Your Committee on Examinations and 
Promotions offer the following for your consideration : 
  One of the most important movements yet made toward giv- 
- ing the children of Tennessee the degree of mental and moral 
training that the times and responsibilities of citizenship de- 
mand, was made by our last Legislature, in extendiny and 
grading the course of study for the public schools of the State. 
The law was the result of an urgent demand from almost every 
section, and it has been received with the evidences of apprecia- 
tion and approval that can reasonably be expected of a consid- 
erate and favored people. 
    _ The slow but steady growth of’ public opinion in the interest 
of free and general education, as a matter of economy, as well 
as of necessity, has at last placed within easy reach of each 
responsibilities of life, and for safe and intelligent citizenship 
ina free government. Scholastic training, sufficient to prosper 
and protect the interest of the individual, the homie, and the 
government, has been provided for by establishing a system of 
free education, with a broad and strong foundation. The sub- 
jects to'be taught have been named, their order of precedence 
fixed by authority, and provisions made for the system’s sup- 
port. : 
: 
  The foundation is welllaid. With judicious management and 
the constant strengthening that growing experience will give, 
we have the utmost confidence in the final success of the system ; 
butif left as it is, and especially without improvement in the 
  child in the State a good practical education. Such an educa-— 
tion, at least, as qualifies for the average individual duties and”

manner-of application, it can but “drag its weary length” from 
term to term, while the children vainly hope and strive to real- 
ize the full measure of wealth treasured for them by the State. 
Evidently, all essential preparatory steps are not yet taken. 
Some of the most important preparation for effective work is 
yet to be made. As teachers and school-officials, we are much 
in need of a more complete and clearly defined method of doing 
the work assigned us. We need greater unity of opinion as to 
- what, when, and how to do, that we may secure the best results 
in the shortest time and with the least unnecessary labor and | 
expense to the average person interested. At the very founda- 
tion of success on this line of advancement lies the question of 
promotion—a question that cannot be overlooked, lightly 
treated, or overestimated by any school or system of schools 
that aspire to a creditable degree of excellency as such. The 
importance of it cannot be too strongly urged or too well un- 
_ derstood. Right promotion is the key with which the success- 
ful teacher unlocks the store-house of knowledge to his pupils. 
It is the strongest lever with which the strongest teacher work. 
But while this is true, wrong promotion is effecting the charac- 
ter and efficiency of every school in the State. It is an evil and 
constant trouble with which every teacher is familiar, and one 
from which any true teacher will seek relief through any plan 
that carries with it the hope of success. But important and 
troublesome as this part of the teacher’s work is, it is widely 
-and sadly neglected. Many of our public school teachers are 
giving the subject no thought at all, while our most prominent 
and trusted educators are disagreed to the extent of involving 
the very extremes of the question. The inattention of the one 
grows out of an underestimate of the teachers’ responsibility, 
and the disagreement of the other is the result of conflicting 
opinions as to what constitutes an education. If we could 
once agree as to what the teacher is and what an education is, 
we would have reached an easy and satisfactory solution of 
many of the vexing problems of school-life, and, among the 
rest, the problem of promotion. But, as circumstances are, no 
general rule of passing from grade to grade, or from subject to _ 
subject, is understood, respected, or in force in either the public — 
or private schools of the State. We all agree that the child
-P-A-G-E-390
‘ a 
Pusiic Scuoon Orricurs’ Association. ey 
who studies is entitled to promotion at some time and in some 
way; but just when and how that promotion is to be made has 
taken the form of a very perplexing question; a question on 
which we cannot agree, perhaps, for years to come. 
In view of these facts, and because each known method of 
promotion has, perhaps, some objectionable feature, and has 
been severely criticised by intelligent critics, we believe that it 
is impossible to formulate a plan that will exactly adapt itself 
to the case of each child, or satisfy each teacher in any system 
of schools. But because a plan fails to do this is not sufficient 
reason for regarding it as impractical or unjust. Americans do 
not deal with things or with each other in that way. Some sort 
of general plan of promotion, whether it ¢an be made satisfac- 
tory to all or not, would surely be better than no plan at all in 
a system of schools that employs teachers ofsuch varying com- 
petency as those employed in our public schools. Interested 
and responsible persons should agree upon such a plan, and that 
_ plan should go to each public school in the State as an official 
document from the office of the State Superintendent; and 
County Superintendents and District Directors and teachers 
should give their hearty co-operation to render it effective. 
We do not care to outline the plan further than to say that 
promotion should be positive proof that the subject or grade 
passed is fairly understood, and should be made in such a way 
as to convince the pupil that he is taking an important and cor- 
rect step. It would be better to leave the child at home, with- 
out the pretense of learning, than teach him that education 
does not necessarily mean knowing something, being able to do 
‘something, and to tell something. We realize that there is, 
perhaps, an imperceptible, an inexplainable growth in educa- 
_ tion; but the cause and effect of that growth are not and should 
not be hidden. © 
But what can we dare to say of examinations as a means of 
promotion for the future? They have long been employed for 
this purpose, and have generally been regarded as a reasonable, 
safe, and sufficient test of the pupil’s standing in his classes and 
in the subjects reviewed; but more recently they have been’ se-

verely criticised, and very liberally discounted as a test of 
scholarship, and some have gone so far as to assert that it is un- 
wise, as well as unjust, to examine at all for promotion. There 
is a demand now for an education. that cannot be “marked by 
percentages” or discovered by “ examination tests.” 
Examiners are petitioning school-boards, in behalf of the 
children, that “ the great day of examination” may be abolished. 
Numerous reasons for such petitions are given, but we pause to 
ask: Has any one offered a safer and better plan? Are the 
popular criticisms on examinations well founded and well sus- 
tained? Is it true that pupils may have learned and not be 
able to tell? That the mind may be developed by study, with- 
outa perceptible increase of' knowledge of the subject studied ? 
That timidity and anxiety often drive bright pupils to failure, 
while ignorance and indolence reward themselves with neat 
and correct examination papers? Do examinations necessarily 
lead to the “cramming” method of teaching? Or to an “ ab- 
normal strain of the memory at the expense of the reasoning ~ 
powers?” If the truth requires an affirmative answer to these 
questions, the inefficiency of examinations as a meats of pro- 
motion is established, and it is our duty to join the procession 
in search of something better. But weare not convinced. We — 
believe that the examination should be continued in its present 
use, that it is an approximately correct test of scholarship, and 
that it is cheerfully taken by the pupil who is prepared. for it. 
When it fails to promote, as far as scholarship is concerned, 
. promotion is out of order or the examiner is in fault, and the 
constant dread of this work that is so prevalent in our schools, 
is all traceable to one of two causes—a lack of experience or a 
lack of preparation. The daily recitation possesses every test 
and terror, and even more than need go into the dreaded test of 
the “great day.” . 
The written examination is especially useful to the learner, 
whether he seeks promotion or not; and such exercises should 
be encouraged and practiced in every school. Assoon as pupils 
have learned to write a legible hand, they are prepared to take 
written examinations in the grade to which they belong. Such 
  =s 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  Pusirc Scuoot Orricers’ ASSsocraTION. 19 
  
exercises will interest and encourage, besides teaching to do by 
doing, to think by being forced to think, and to tell by telling. 
With the proper encouragement and care on the part of the 
teacher, the papers thus prepared will soon begin to give a cor- 
rect idea of scholarship, and may be made the basis of -pro- 
motion. 
. But should promotion depend entirely on the grade gained 
by examination, regardless of the extent and character 
of the examination? We think not. When examina- 
tions are held for the purpose of promoting, the dbject is not 
to determine whether the mind can be misled or con- 
fused on the subject or grade considered; but the questions 
should be selected with a view to proving that the pupil has a 
reasonably clear conception of the grade he seeks to pass. 
“Test questions” and “catch questions” are out of placein such 
exercises. They lead to the loss of self-confidence and confi- 
dence in the teacher, without which success is impossible. The ~ 
_ examiner isin an unfortunate attitude if the examined doubt 
his being just or competent. 
But, in addition to examination papers, other things may be 
considered in making promotions. The age of the pupil is 
very important, and especially with those who possess quicks 
and apt minds. Bright boys and girls are objects of special 
pride and interest in all schools; but they seldom escape serious 
and lasting injury as the result of rapid progress. The successes 
‘that crown their efforts in the beginning enthuse parents and 
- teachers, and they are hurried on as rapidly as their accomplish- 
ments, compared with others, will justify, and by the time they 
haye reached the third grade they are dealing with subjects be 
- yond their years. The next step brings them to the much- 
dreaded “ stand-still’’ in school life. The mind becomes con- 
fused and blunted, and confidence in self destroyed. 
    Bright pupils are dangerous material in the hand of ambitious 
_ teachers. Would correct statistics prove that ten per cent. of 
_ them survive the errors of promotion? Can this great State of 
ours afford to have one of them sacrificed on the altar of unen- 
viable ambition ? 
     
     
-P-A-G-E-393
80 Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ Assocration. 
Again, age may be considered because one of more mature 
years may be able to do more work without injury to himself, 
and may then maintain a respectable standing in the succeeding 
subject or grade, notwithstanding the imperfections of his ex- 
amination papers, which are sometimes the result of disad- 
vantages. In such cases, the examiner is not only justifiable, 
but in duty bound to promote. No pupil should be denied such 
advancement as can be made without injury to his best 
interests. 
The class record and the record made in monthly and quar- 
terly examinations may have due weight in forming conclusions 
on proficiency and right to advancement. Sometimes trivial 
but uncontrollable circumstances seriously affect the character of 
examination papers; but the anxious and watchful teacher, true 
to the most sacred duty of his high calling, will not leave the 
unfortunate one to the mercy of circumstances and overlook the 
successes with which his past record abounds. Such a course 
would lead to evident injuries for which no teacher can dare to 
become responsible. No weakness of a teacher is more hurtful 
or inexcusable than his failure to give credit for successes, when ~ 
the pupil’s character and highest interests are at stake. 
* Again, if the teacher can, he should acquaint himself with the 
previous advantages or disadvantages of the candidate for pro- 
motion, and these may go to his credit or discredit, as cireum- 
stances require. Sometimes superior ability contending against 
disadvantages fails to accomplish all that might otherwise be 
required and expected ; while, on the other hand, inferior minds 
with superior advantages may gain promotion that they cannot 
sustain. The idea is that the teacher must have a correct 
knowledge of the pupil’s attainments, of his ability to do, and 
of the character of the work to which he seeks advancement, 
and that promotion must be made on this knowledge. 
But, after all that has been said, if the ends to be attained by 
examination and by promotion have been well studied and un- 
derstood ; if the questions have been wisely selected and with a 
view to reaching these ends, and if the exercises of the exami- 
' nation have been faithfully superintended by the examiner, he

will have little else to do-than that of impartially grading the 
papers. The necessary exemptions from the general rule will 
be of little consequence in the way of success, when compared 
with the present deplorable condition of affairs on this line, and 
especially in our public schools. 
Then, we recommend that the State Superintendent, either 
alone or with such assistance as this Association may suggest, 
be requested to prepare and distribute a plan of promotions for 
use in the public schools of the State; that it be accompanied 
with such suggestions and instructions as may lead to more ex- 
tensive, earnest, and uniform thought on this very important 
part of the teacher’s work.

Report oF THE CoMMITTEE oN County EpucatTionaL ConvEN- 
"TIONS, EXPosirioNs, AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
Your Committee on County Educational Conventions, Ex- 
positions, and Associations beg leave to submit the following 
report: 
I. EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
Realizing the great importance of unity of thought and ac- 
tion on the part of Directors, patrous, and teachers, and feeling 
that this can be obtained only by a definite understanding as to 
what is needed to promote the interests of public education in 
the community or county, we desire to urge the holding of edu- 
cational meetings, and suggest the following plan: 
1. The Directors of each county shall be organized into a Con- 
vention of School Officers, which shall meet at least annually, 
and discuss the many important matters pertaining to their of- 
ficial duty. 
We favor alaw allowing Directors one dollar per day for their 
attendance, to be paid on the order of the County Superin- 
tendent. ‘ 
2. The Directors of the various districts, in connection with 
the teachers thereof, shall call public meetings of the citizens 
from time to time, have recitations, music, ete., by the pupils, 
and educational addresses by influential citizens of the district 
and others. 
II. SCHOOL EXPOSITIONS. 
Fairs and expositions, displaying the agricultural and manu- 
facturing products of our State have done much to stimulate 
improvement all along these lines, and the time is now here 
when expositions of school-work play an important part in the 
educational world. Such exhibits will do much toward encour- 
aging neat and systematic work on the part of teacher and 
pupils, and, at the same time, mould popular opinion in favor 
of education for the masses. We therefore recommend that 
expositions be held in all the counties, and suggest the follow- 
ing plan, which has been successfully tried in this State: 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  ; 5 
Pusuic ScHoot OFrFicEers’. ASSOCIATION. 85 
  
1. Explain the importance of the matter to your teachers, 
and, if possible, secure the hearty co-operation of all. 
2. Select a uniform grade of paper to be used~by all pupils — 
preparing material for the exposition. (We suggest a good 
- grade of legal cap and German drawing paper.) 
3. The exhibit should include review or examination work, ” 
actual class-work, map-drawing, oD at professional books 
on teaching, etc. 
4. The work of the term should be preserved, and, at the 
close, a public exposition held, inviting Directors, patrons, and 
the public generally to inspect the same. 
_ 5. The exhibits of the various schools should be taken to the 
annual Institute and placed together, thereby forming a county 
educational exposition, which should remain open during the 
term of the Institute. Tables should be placed around the 
walls of the exposition-room, on which should be arranged, by 
- districts, all written work, while the exhibits in drawing should 
be displayed on the walls of the building. 
We further recommend that a committee of nine be appointed 
from this body to co-operate with other committees which may 
be appointed to secure a State exhibit for the World’s Colum- 
bian Exposition, in 1893. 
Ill. ANNUAL NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
We heartily indorse the holding of annual Normal Institutes 
for the special training of teachers, as is now done in nearly all 
the counties of the State. ‘The annual examination of teachers 
should be held at the close of the Institute, but no one should 
be examined who has not attended at least three days. 
We recommend liberal appropriations by County Courts for 
the support of these meetings. 
IV. MONTHLY MEETINGS. 
We also recommend that monthly teachers’ meetings he held 
in all the counties, continuing two days—Friday and Saturday

without loss of salary, provided they attend both days, but not 
otherwise.

SECRETARY GOODMAN’S RESOLUTION. 
Wuergas, At the recent meeting of the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation at Chattanooga, July 8 and 9, 1891, President Whar- 
ton S. Jones, in his annual address, recommended that suitable 
provisions be at once begun to have the great State of Tennes- 
see properly represented at the World’s Fair at Chicago in 1893 ; 
and, 
Wuereas, The committee having under consideration Presi- 
dent Jones’ address, recommended, and the Association unani- 
mously approved, the President’s recommendation, and the 
sympathy and support of the Association was pledged to co- 
operate in all measures tending to secure a proper representa- 
tion of this State in the World’s Fair; and, 
Wuerzas, The State Board of Education, at its meeting De- 
cember 8, appointed a committee to represent the board in co- 
operating with a committee of the State Teachers’ Association, 
the public school officers, and commercial organizations in se- _ 
curing for the State of Tennessee an adequate representation of — 
the educational interests at the World’s Fair; and, 
Wueraas, The committee report on County Expositions, etc., 
clearly shows by citing actual experience that creditable exhibits 
of educational work in county and district schools have been 
and can be made; therefore, 
Be it resolved, That the following committee of five be ap- 
pointed to represent this Association in co-operating with a 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-398
      
Pustic Scuoot Orricers’ Assocration. 87 
  
similar committee of the State Teachers’ Association and com- — 
mercial organizations, to the end that the district and city pub- 
lic schools may be properly represented in the educational ex- 
hibit at the World’s Fair: W. R. Garrett, of Nashville; H. D. 
Huffaker, Chattanooga; F. M. Smith, Knoxville; C. 8. Doug- 
lass, Gallatin ; and Miss Nellie O’ Donnell, of Memphis. 
Resolved further, That this convention of public school officers 
deems it to be the sense of the educators of Tennessee— . 
1. That the educators of the State will take pride and pleas- 
ure in preparing an educational exhibit for the World’s Colum- 
bian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, which shall reflect honor - 
upon the State. 
2. That it would be unjust that the pecuniary expense of the 
transportation and display of the educational exhibit should be 
thrown upon the teachers and school- officers. 
8. That it is inexpedient to attempt to raise a fund for defray- 
ing the expenses of the educational exhibit of Tennessee by 
voluntary subscriptions from teachers and school-officers. 
4, That the Committee on Educational Exhibits, appointed 
by this Association, be instructed to memorialize the Tennessee 
Commission for the World’s Columbian Exposition, setting 
forth the willingness of the educators of the State to prepare 
an educational exhibit, and their unwillingness and inability to 
provide for defraying the expenses of the transportation ‘and. 
display of the same. 
The clause of the report in reference to County Institutes 
was then discussed, as follows: 
Superintendent Allen : 
“Since Mr. Huffaker asks it, I cheerfully ‘pardon’ him for 
recommending that the annual County Institutes be supported 
by appropriations by the County Courts. While I have 
strenuously opposed such @ course, both in practice and in this 
Association, as wrong in principle and hurtful in effects, I do 
not consider it unpardonable in Mr. Huffaker to modestly sug- 
_, gest again that it be done.
-P-A-G-E-399

“The paragraph in the report which recommends an Institute 
of two days in each month, and that teachers be paid for their 
time while attending, is inconsistent and wrong. It practically 
reduces the number of school-days in a month to nineteen, and 
pays the teacher for twenty. The law will not permit this loss 
of time to the children. Nor will it sanction the appropriation 
_ of money, collected to educate the children, to the different 
_ purpose of giving to the teacher such qualifications as he is posi- 
tively required by law to bring to the profession. The work 
that Mr. Huffaker seeks to have done is very important, and 
should not be neglected; but his plan for doing it is un- 
necessarily expensive, besides being illegal. I have calculated 
for my own county, and find that this Institute will cost us $100 
a day, or $2,400 a year. Of course, we are not going to pay it, 
-or recommend that others do it. But, if I could believe that 
such a motion would be entertained, I would move to amend 
this report by substituting for the two days’ Institute a teach- 
ers’ reading circle, or a course of professional reading, with 
monthly meetings for discussion.” 
. Superintendent M. R. Abernathy.—“ Mr. President, I would 
like to ask if that is the result of the report of the committee— 
that the teachers are to be paid for their time while attending 
the County Institutes each month?” 
The President—“T understand that the committee recom- 
mends two days each mouth, and one of these days, of course, 
is a school-day, Friday and Saturday being the days; and that 
the teacher be paid for Friday, one day out of each month, 
while attending the Institute. The committee has made that 
report.” 
Mr. Allen.—‘I move to amend the committee’s report by 
substituting for the two days’ monthly Institute, a teach- 
ers’ reading circle, or a course of professional reading, with — 
monthly meetings for discussion.” 
Captain Douglass.—“ I move that we lay the amendment on 
the table.” \ 
Superintendent Allen.— It is in lieu of the two days’ Insti- 
tute to be held each month. It wiil not interfere with your an-_ 
  ’ oie

~ nual Institutes, but comes in place of your two days’ monthly 
Institutes.” 
_ The President.—“ Superintendent Allen’s amendment is of- 
fered in lieu of the recommendation of the committee of the 
two days’ monthly Institutes.” 
Superintendent Douglass.—“ Should not that be worded as 
Superintendent Allen means? Do you mean it to do away 
with the two days’ Institutes?” : 
_ Superintendent Allen.—“ Yes, sir.” 
. “The President.—* What is the pleasure of the Association in 
regard to this amendment?” 
Captain Douglass.—“ I move that it be laid on the table.” 
Prof. Goodman.— I second that motion.’ - 
Superintendent Allen.— If in order, I would like to say the 
reading circle can be made to do precisely the same work that 
the monthly Institute would do. Ido not propose to do away with 
_. the work of the monthly Institute, but to do away with the un- 
necessary expense recommended by the committee ; -besides, the 
members of the circle have a month to study this work, they 
are gathering at home a professional library, and thus do away 
with the necessity for a circulating library; at the same time 
. they are building themselves up faster in this way, and ona 
higher grade of work than in the Institute. It is cheaper, too. 
, Imust insist once more, that we have no right to be spending 
the money of the children upon men and women whom the law 
‘says must come to the school-room prepared and qualified to 
teach.” 
    ' The President.— The question is now upon the motion of 
_ Superintendent Douglass to table the amendment.” 
The motion was then put, and the amendment was tabled. 
Superintendent Nelson.—<I wish to offer, in lieu of Mr. 
Huffaker’s two days’ Institute, a motion that it be one day each 
month, without any pay for-the teacher.”

Superintendent Baker.—<I move that the amendment be 
adopted.” 
Superintendent Huffaker.—‘A number of years in practical 
school-work has taught me that these meetings are very im- 
portant, and I regret very much to see the opposition to this _ A 
movement. Iam forced to believe that the gentlemen who op- 
pose this measure, do so merely from the fact that they have not 
tried it. We often oppose things with which we are not famil- 
jar. The association in Hamilton County was organized in 
1882'in my school, with about a dozen of us present. From 
that time to this we have held monthly meetings. Wedo not — 
    meet monthly all the year, but for three montls—September, — 
October, and November—we meet Friday and Saturday at dif- 
ferent places in the county. I want to say that in the plan of 
school-work in Iamilton County, I heartily indorse the two 
days’ Association. ' It has done more to build up the schools of 
Hamilton County than any thing we have ever had. In this 
way we meet the people and talk about these things. By this. a 
means we have done more to mold popular opinion in favor of 
public education- than we could have done in any other way. 
“If it is right to appropriate a fund from the, treasury annually ae 
to hold a number of County Institutes and annual Institutes 
throughout the State, why is it not right to appropriate money 
to defray the expenses of one day, if they accomplish the same 
thing? One is as important as the other. They are on iden- 
tically-th same principle, and the one in close proximity to the 
other. They are different parts of the same work.” 
Superintendent Stephens.—“ I desire to say that it appears to 
me should we pass such a resolution as this—I understand we 
are not making law at this time—it will give an impetus to 
those counties that desire a two days’ Institute, and those that 
desire to meet only on Saturday can continue to hold only on 
Saturday, as in the past, and it will not have any effect on them 
-- whatever. If they desire to take it, they may have Friday to 
attend the Institute. © We mean to urge upon the proper officers 
not to make any reduction in their salaries. We do not mean 
_ it to be understood that we pay the teachers to attend, but to 
Jet them know that the Institutes are held, and that their sala-

ries will not be deducted for that one day in the month, because 
they have gone to the Institute. This is to apply only to those 
teachers who do attend the Institute. This may be prudent, 
but those who do not attend the Institute—they are to go ahead 
in the school-room in their work.- It seems to me that it is 
important for no county to hinder such a thing. It is not the 
number of days a teacher is in the school-room that accom- 
plishes the most good in one month, or the number of days in 
-one school-room, but it is the amount of work properly done. 
One teacher can do as much good in a school-room in one day 
as another can in a week. If the teachers, by meeting together, 
can prepare themselves for better work, and do more in nine- > 
teen days in a mhonth than they can in twenty days without 
_ meeting: together, they should do so. The pupils get rested. 
They are recuperated physically, and are better prepared to 
work the nineteen days. If the meeting together as teachers 
does not accomplish any good, and if the teachers are not ben- 
elited by meeting, I see no reason why we should meet at all.’ 
Isee no reason why we should meet in Institutes and County 
Normals, or why we should hold public school officers’ associa- 
tions if we get no good from our meeting together. By their 
coming together very great good will be accomplished. The 
different teachers in the county will meet together, and they 
will get suggestions and thoughts from each other, which they 
will carry home with them, that will be profitable to them. It 
will not cost a great deal, and at the same time they will get 
   enthusiasm, spirit, strength in the work, which they will-carry 
home with them. In some counties it is a difficult matter for 
the teachers to.leave their homes and go to:the place where the 
Institute is to meet and return the same day, and Saturday is 
_ the Jast day before Sunday, and they need to be at home on 
Saturday evening a little before night, to get ready for Sunday. 
Some of the teachers live some distance, and if they go to the 
Institute and then have to go home the same day, they will have 
no time to spend at the Institute. It seem to me we ought to 
let those counties that want two-day Institutes have them, and 
those who want only the one day, let them hold their Institutes 
that way. 
Superintendent Overall——“TI think when Superintendent 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  92 Pustic Scuoon Orricers’ ASsocraTIon. 
Huffaker’s resolution is re-read a large number of the Superin- 
tendents will heartily concur in that resolution, because we 
have all experienced great drawbacks in holding one-day Insti- 
tutes on Saturdays. Ihave tried it, and I know a number of 
other Superintendents who have tried it. Ihave met numbers 
of teachers from my county in town on Saturday, the day the 
Institute was held, who would say, ‘I will go to the Institute a 
while if I get time.’ They came to town on that day on busi- 
  ness, and they are going to transact that business first. ‘More- 
over, all the teachers you can get to attend the Institute on that 
day are not able to give the work that attention it deserves, and 
I realize that the one-day Saturday Institutes do not carry out 
the purpose we desire. Supérintendent Huffaker’s resolution 
makes it obligatory upon the teacher to attend both days, and 
his salary is not deducted. He is not required to make up the 
lost time. He is just required to teach nineteen days, instead 
_ of twenty, and receives his full salary. Superintendent Huft- 
“aker will please read that part of the report of the committee.” 
The report of the committee was read by Superintendent 
‘Huffaker, as requested. 
Superintendent Nelson._‘I desire to ask Superintendent 
Huffaker a question. If he proposes to make these two days 
compulsory, and, in case a teacher is not present both days, is 
his pay for Friday deducted?” 
Superintendent Huffaker.— No, sir.” 
Superintendent Nelson.—“I will withdraw my motion, but I 
see this point, Mr. Chairman. If we have a two ‘days’ Institute, 
meeting Friday and Saturday, nine-tenths of our teachers will 
meet Friday and draw their pay, and Saturday they will go on 
about their worldly affairs. If you will make it compulsory 
to attend both days, I will withdraw my amendment in lieu. 
That is my objection, and I hope every member hears my ob- 
jection. If you will make it compulsory both days, I will with- 
draw my amendment.” 
Superintendent Huffakon —“It is the duty of the County 
Superintendent to look after this, and keep a record of apre

teachers who attend Friday and go home on Saturday, and 
when it is found that they have not attended, he will ask the 
Directors to deduct pay for that day from their salary. Thisis. 
intended to bring them to the Institute and keep them there 
during the entire session. Whenever a teacher fails to attend 
two days there, he loses his day’s work.” 
‘The President.—“ Mr. Nelson requests that the teacher be 
required to attend both days or make up the time.” 
Superintendent Huffaker.“ I accept that amendment.” 
Superintendent “Abernathy.—“I do hope this assembly ne 
teachers and school-officers will vote against that resolution. I 
live in a county where we have sustained Teachers’ Institutes 
for twenty years, and I can say that last year we had a volun- 
tary attendance of the teachers for one month, during the month 
of June, and McNairy is not one of the counties that is on top. 
The day you begin to hire the teachers to attend the Institutes, 
that day they are doomed. Make it voluntary for the teachers 
who desire to prepare themselves more thoroughly for their 
work, and do not hire them to attend the Institutes. Rather 
petition your Legislature to make an appropriation of money to 
pay a capable man to go out and lecture and hold Institutes 
of two weeks. If you will do that, it will not be very long 
until every county in this State will hold a month’s Lustitute. 
I took it upon myself, without consulting any one, to hold a 
month’s Institute. On the first day I enrolled twenty, and the 
next week had about fifty. Superintendent Garett wrote me 
a letter to know what I was going to do about an Institute, and 
out of what fund I expected the expenses of same to be paid, 
and I wrote ‘at my own expense,’ and then he sent mesome 
: help; and you will always be helped, if you will put your a shoulder to the wheel and push. I oppose this resolution, and 
Thope you will all vote against it. Itis wrong, and I hope you 
will all see it.” 
Superintendent Overall— I do not see that this is hiring 
teachers to do this work. ‘When the Institutes are held on Sat- 
urday, they do not have time to do the work, and doit well. If 
this report is adopted, we cannot cause this system to be put in

operation, because it will depend upon the Directors whether 
this is done or not, and we cannot force the Directors to-do it. 
The County Superintendent will have to advise the Directors, 
and get them to have it put in operation. Before this can 
finally be putin operation, the County Superintendent will have 
to impress upon the Directors the great advantages they are ; 
gaining, and show them how a teacher can do more work in 
nineteen days, with the help gained at these meetings, than he 
canin twenty without it. Ifthe Directors will co-opérate with 
him, and require the teachers to attend these meetings, then 
you can make this a success. So far as its being obligatory 
upon the teachers to attend, that is a question for the Directors. 
By having the two days, we accomplish more work in the way 
of enlarging our ideas as teachers. If we hold only one day, 
Saturday, we will find that we cannot accomplish much real ad- 
vancement.” ; 
Superintendent Wright.—“T want to say on this subject that 
we have a better attendance of the Greene County teachers 
than in any other county in the State. We invariably hold two 
days, and the Directors pay the teachers for one of these days, 
which, I think, is right. I see no reason why there should be 
any objections to this resolution. I am for it, and I shall vote 
for it.” . : 
Supérintendent Graves —“ The teachers need to be taught. 
I have found it best to make the Directors so interested in the 
work that they make the request themselves that all teachers 
and applicants for positions as teachers shall attend the Insti- 
tutes before they employ them as teachers: In holding District 
Institutes, I have been obliged to hold but one day, because on 
Friday I have been unable to attend myself. I know that in 
the State of Pennsylvania no teacher .can be employed who 
does not attend both County and District Institutes. In New 
York, the teacher’s salary goes right along a whole week while 
attending the Institute. No deduction is made. Ido not know 
how it is in other counties, but in Cumberland County we need 
such a rule for teachers to attend the Institutes, and I would 
like a strong resolution.” 
Superintendent Huffaker—“[ do not want to occupy your

. time, but I want to make an explanation. Superintendent Ab- 
ernathy misunderstands the proposition. He speaks in regard 
‘to the annual Institutes, and this favors monthly meetings. 
This resolution strongly recommends what lie favors. It goes 
still further—it recommends monthly me-tings. My friend 
Allen argues it from a money stand-point. - I hold that it is not 
amatter of dollars and cents. This ‘resolution means tliat the 
teachers shall meet together this one day, only teaching nine- 
teen days out of the month, and, by thus meeting together, 
shall become familiar with the work of each other, better pre- 
pared to teach, and shall do better work than by teaching the 
full twenty days, and not getting this valuable information. 
’ This is the only question in it. It is not a matter of dollars 
and cents. The question is whether we can get better and more 
efficient work from our teachers by their attending the Insti- 
tute this one day and only teaching nineteen days or by their 
teaching the full twenty days. If they can do more in the 
nineteen days, then we ought to adopt this resolution.” 
Superintendent Allen.—“TI believe, sir, that the teacher ought 
to know that he ought to be prepared to do this work. I am 
not opposed to the workings of the resolution. I am not op- 
posed to the additional strength that the teacher would receive 
from this point, but I do oppose the way of obtaining that ad- 
ditional strength. It is too expensive—unnecegsarily expensive. 
Mr. Hutiaker states that my objection to it arises from igno- 
rance of the plan, never having tried it. Heis mistaken about 
that. Institutes of that character have been run in our county 
some eight or ten years. We know just what isin them. For 
_ the same reason I might say that perhaps he objects to the res- 
olution in regard to a reading circle upon the plan I suggested. 
Possibly he never tried that. I feel assured we shall receive a 
good deal more benefit from a reading circle, if properly con- 
ducted, than from the two days’ Institute, leaving the money- 
question out of it altogether. I believe that the teachers who 
attend these Institutes and receive pay for it, or pay for the 
time they are in them, will be the teachers, in nine cases out of 
ten, who do not need the help of the Institutes as bad as those 
who do not go. Those teachers who most need the help of the 
Institute work are a class who are least apt to be there. This ee

plan proposes hiring them, as Superintendent Abernathy says, 
‘to attend these Institutes, which, I think,is wrong. Instead of 
paying them for it, as has been suggested, we have a right to 
demand this additional strength of the teachers. Let them 
bring it into the schools. It has been suggested that those of 
us who are opposed to this resolution are throwing ourselves in 
the way of other counties. This resolution is in the way of my 
county. Teachers who have been brought up in the counties 
which fayor this, come into our county, and feel that they ought 
to enjoy the same privileges and receive the same pay as they 
have done in other places.’ 
Superintendent Douglass.—“I understand Superintendent 
Allen to want these teachers to teach five days in the week and 
then go and hold the Institutes on Saturday for the benetit of 
the children, and get no pay for it. I understand that the only 
day in the week the teacher has to attend to his little business 
which naturally belongs’ to himself is Saturday. He is working 
at the paltry sum of $1 or $1.50 a day. This man shall be 
brought up there on that day to organize an Institute. He 
must put in that day working for that school. Does my friend 
not understand this? Does he not know it? He is one of the 
best Superintendents in the State. Does he not know that there 
are a great many young teachers starting out who have nothing 
to bade them, and need this help? A number of boys and girls 
are employed—for you cannot keep the Directors from employ- — 
ing them—they will employ them, and give them $25 or $30 a 
month. I have been at work organizing the schools of Sumner 
County for years. When I went into the county some of the 
teachers only received $20 a month. I am glad. to say that 
many of them received $50 when I closed my work there. One 
day intwenty—-one day for what? As these gentlemen have 
well said, it is to be given to Institute work. Not so much how 
to work percentage and how to work interest, and this method 
and that method, but how to govern the school. This is a big 
thing in the public school system. Iam sure no Superintendent 
who understands this, and will think of it, will refuse the paltry _ 
sum of $2 or $2.50 a day to the teacher. A lawyer can get $100 
or $150 for drawing a brief, and a doctor $100 to $150 forasingle — 
case or visit; when you ‘come’ to the teacher, receiving this

paltry $2 or $2. 50 a fae for attending the Institute, he is op- 
posed'to it. What on earth is he thinking about? The idea is 
ridiculous. From the dignity and worth of our profession, I 
take it that a good teacher deserves as much for his work as a 
doctor or a lawyer. One day out of twenty—five hours in your 
school, and you say that the teacher must come there on Satur- 
day; the poor, god-forsaken fellow, who has nothing in the 
world, perhaps, but a house, and has a wife depending on him 
to make a living, and who wants to get up his wood—this poor 
fellow cannot have Saturday. You live in the city, I suppose? 
Ido. When I lived in the country, I used to black my shoes 
every month; now, I have them blacked every morning, and 
sometimes wear a standing collar. He has a house and a hog, 
and he wants to get up his wood, and get ready for Sunday, 
and you want him to go to the Institute on Saturday, and do 
not want to pay him for it—$1.50. You have just got the 
eS wrong pig by the ear this time—there is no doubt about it 
       
    atall. Iam in favor of the suggestions of that committee, that’ 
once a month we have an Institute, on Friday and Saturday, 
and Iam in favor of the Directors paying them for that day. 
_ My Directors would do that, for they always backed me.” 
Superintendent Abernathy. eae you in favor of paying a 
man to go to church?” 
Superintendent Douglass.—* No; I leave the Lord to pay 
him for Sunday. Let the Directors pay for Friday. Now, I 
want this school-body here—this body, this organization of 
public school officers—which has done more work than any 
meeting We have ever had before, to send out broad and liberal 
recommendations. Do not cramp your State Superintendent. 
He must have the co-operation of the teachers and of the Di- 
rectors. Superintendent Garrett can and will help you in this 
work. Do notcramp him. It is not merely that a-man can 
work so much interest—the learning of methods is worth all 
the balance. It is not to learn to do this work that the Insti- 
_ tutes are held—the working of a little compound proportion 
and a little of this or that. That idea is utterly absurd. When 
4 the Directors in this or that particular place want a teacher, the 
qu tion will be: ‘Can you give us one? We want a man for 2

our school. We do not know how to conduet it ourselves. 
Please give us some information to run this school. This is 
what will be the result of this Institute work.” 5 é 
-Superintendent Abernathy.—“I just want to say that it is 
not the $1.50 that enters into the consideration in this question. 
It is simply the fact that you start out with the idea that you 
must pay the teachers to atiend these Institutes. When Super- 
intendent Garrett, or any other State Superintendent, attempts 
to call An Institute, the teachers will demand pay for attending 
it. If he wants a State Institute held, the teachers will refuse 
to attend it, because they cannot get pay for it. Besides that, 
the people do not pay either their doctors, lawyers, or ministers 
to prepare themselves for their professions, and we do not pro- 
pose to pay the teachers. It is not the $1.50 in it, but‘it is the 
tendency of it.” 
The President.—“ The question is now upon the adoption of 
‘the report of the committee as amended by Prof. Goodman.” 
The report was adopted, Superintendent R. M. Abernathy 
voting “No.” : 
The President then introduced Superintendent Z. H. Brown, 
of the Nashville city schools. :

together where they can exchange experiences, and there is a 
great deal more in that than you get out of books, Aman _ 
may stand a fine written examination and get the highest per 
eent., but when you put him to work he will be an utter failure. 
We have cases of that-kind in our schools now. These meet- 
ings, in my judgment, do more good than all the other things 
together. We get more good out of our meetings when we 
come together than from any other source. Weare constantly tae 
changing our corps of teachers, and I suppose that is the case 
everywhere. An influence is brought to. Year upon thie Board 
of Education, and they are influenza to’ introduce into the 
pene Bicols teachers wholly unprepared for the work. Teach- 
ers’ meetings afford the only way we have of preparing them. 
They all come together, and have instruction and get/ideas from 
older teachers, and go back to their respective places benefited. 
Tregret very much that I could not be with you yesterday, but 
was so situated that it was not possible. I want to say before 
_ taking my seat, that I would like the Superintendents to feel at 
liberty to visit the public schools of Nashville, in a body or 
alone. You will find the doors open, and you will be welcome. 
I want to say another thing. I have never seen a District Di- 
rector in my life that did not want to be judge of the teachers’ 
affairs and of his intelligence. I do not judge my teacher by 
what he says, but by what he is able to do. I want to say that 
Tecan go into your school-house, and you need not be there, and 
J can tell what kind of a man youare. The impression is made 
from the surroundings. It is not whether you are a scholar— 
though this is a most important thing. Ido not believe that 
any teacher ought to be permitted to teach at all until after he 
has first stood a test of scholarship. After you add to that 
good, practical sense, experience and observation, you can be 
made a good teacher. 
“T want to repeat again that I would be glad to see any of 
you in the public schools while you are in the cify. You need 
not have the least fear that the public school system is going to 
pieces because there may be little jars in the workings of it.

ing on. It is not in the power of one or two individuals to de- 
stroy a system of so much importance. We may make mis- 
takes, but time will rectify them.” 7 
The President.—“ The next thing on the programme is the — f 
Peabody Normal College. It gives me great pleasure to intro- 
duce to you Dr. Payne. We will now have his report.” 3 
¥ 
        
                         
   
      The report of Dr. Payne, on Peabody Normal College, was 
* presented, as follows: 
‘ 
Ruvort or Commicten on Prapopy Norman CoLiEer. 
The Committee on the Normal College very respectfully plea @ 
genta brief report) as follows : , 
The entire enrollment for the last college year was 422, and 
of this number, 216 were’from Tennessee. The net gain in at- 
tendance over the preceding year was 63. This year, the total 
number of registrations up to Dec. 1 has been 418. 
These figures not only indicate a gradual and wholesome _ 
growth, but point to a period, probably near at hand, when the a 
membership of the college must be limited to a specific number, 
say 500, or when some addition must be made to the resources. 
of the college in the way of new class-rooms and addjtional in- 
structors, 
The growth of the college has really been larger than the figures 
quoted indicate, for the higher standard for admission has pre- 
vented the entrance of many who would have been admitted 
under former conditions. One of the most wholesome indica 
tions is the growth of the higher classes. For example, the — 
baccalaureate class numbered 18 in 1888-89; 23 in 1889-90; | 
_ 42 in 1890-91; while at present it numbers 50.   
In turn, this growth in the number of candidates for Bache- 
lor’s Degrees indicates that there is a pronounced tendency in — 
the college to extend the period of study from two years to 
three, and even four years, for there is now a class of six who ; 
are candidates for the Master’s rate hate

oo hs longer period of residence.makes it possible for students 
to attain sounder scholarship and a more thorough professional 
knowledge; and these two attainments are essential to the main 
purpose of the college, which is to recruit permanently the 
teaching profession of the South. 
_ Tennessee’s.quota of scholarship students has been increased 
to thirty-three—one to each senatorial district. All these dis- 
tricts are now represented in the college save one—the twenty- 
sixth—which sent no candidate to the competitive examination 
held in July. Soon after the opening of the present session, 
the Senator from this district was requested to nominate a can- 
 didate, but, for some reason, failed to do so, and the State Board 
of Education has recently filled this vacancy for the present 
year. This procedure is wholly contrary to the established 
usage, all other appointments having been made for two years; 
but it is the desire of the State Board to have every district 
represented in the college, and so there has been reserved an- 
other chance for this unrepresented district for the year 1892-3. 
With practical unauimity, the last session of the General As- 
sembly raised the annual appropriation for the college from 
$10,000 to $15,000. This was not only a timely response to the 
_ growing needs of the school, but is a proof to the Peabody 
Board of Trust that Oo cesee is glad to act a liberal part in 
the maintenance of the Peabody Normal College. 
The incidents connected with the recent visit of ex-President, 
Hayes and Dr. Curry to the college expresses as forcibly as facts 
can the hearty co-operation of the three governing boards— _ 
University, State, and Peabody—in fostering the se of this 
professional school. Among these boards there i is perfect con- 
cord, one aspiration, one purpose. = : 
The whole spirit of the school is that of helpfulness to every 
legitimate educational interest. It rejoices in the prosperity of 
eyery good school, and counts the gain of every other as anead- 
_ yantage to itself. It has need of help, and desires to give help. 
It has much to do to become what it ought to be, and its ambi- — 
tion is to co-operate with the other elements of our public

Report of Committee on School Journals and School Litera-

mously adopted by the Association, as follows: ’

ERATURE, 
Your Committee on School Journals and School Literature _ 
beg leave to submit the following: 
These terms are exceedingly comprehensive, but supposing 
the committee on programme desired to restrict us to such pa- 
pers, periodicals, and books as are peculiarly fitted to prepare 
the teacher for efficient work, we so restricted this report. _ 
or 
        Whether published through disinterested benevolence, for — 
sample copies, or otherwise, the cry of scarcity cannot be raised 
with regard to sehool-journals of various names. The times 
made the demand and they came forth, ready and willing to be 
immolated upon the pyre of popular favor. Although largely 
products of recent beginning, yes they have attained and main- 
tained sutlivient respect to make it no longen necessary to ob- — 
serve Campbell’s injunction, “ Be not the first to take up the 
new,” so far'as concerns the diligent and painstaking reading 
of the same. Mistakes can be made in this, as in other classes 
of literature, in selecting. \ 
Among the many school-journals published in the United 
States and elsewhere, we desire to make favorable mention of 
the three published in our own State: Zhe South-western Jour- — 
nal’ of Education, published at Nashville; Southern Teacher, 
Chattanooga; and The Teachers’ Head-light, at Sweetwater. —

ished in the State, but these, possibly, do not come under the 
scope of this report, ; 
  We urge the teachers and public school officers of the State — 
to take and carefully consult one or more, good school-journals 
of their choice; for in these may be found many helpful hints 
_ and suggestions in their line of work. The pages of such litera-_ 
ture serve as fallow ground in which is sown choice seed to ger- 
minate and grow in the walks and lives of the progressive 
- teacher and school-officer. On these pages new theories and 
  new methods—and these are largely the fad of the age along 
the line of school-work—are put upon exposition, and old and 
tried ones are kept burning upon the altar of memory. The 
- teacher is thus prepared to protit by the experience of others— 
to emulate their good works and shun their blunders. By get- 
__ ting asuggestive hint here and there, his tact is prepared for 
greater emergencies, his activity quickened, and hei is urged on 
ato better work. 
We heartily commend to teachers many of the books pub- : 
lished on teaching, school management, psychology, and kindred 
subjects. The teacher needs to prepare himself for the great 
work and great possibilities before him, and not only prepare 
himself, but keep abreast with the improverhents pertaining 
to his profession.

Vice- president Garrett took the cher. and announced: “The 
next thing on the programme is the Teachers’ Department of 
the University of Tennessee, which will be ‘presented to you by 
Hon. Frank M. Smith.” 
The report from the Teachers’ Department of the University 
of Tennessee was presented by Prof. Frank M. Smith, as fol- 
lows : 
Report or tHe TEeacners’ Department or THE UNIVERSITY OF _ 
TENNESSEE. 
I desire to call your attention simply to the Teachers’ Depart- 
ment of the University of Tennessee—what we are doing, and. 
what,we propose to do—so that you may thoroughly under- — 
stand us. 
  First, the Teachers’ Department of the University of Tennes- 
gee does not, in any way, conflict with the Peabody Normal — 
College. If I thought for a moment that it would affect the 
usefulness of that institution I would sever my connection with 
it. I know it is not the desire of the Trustees of the University 
of Tennessee or of Dr. Dabney, the president of that institu- 
tion, or of myself, principal of the Teachers’ Department, to do — 
any thing that will in any way draw from that institution. ey 
Upon the contrary, we stand by it as firm as it is possible for 
any thing in the world to be supported. That is my feeling, 
and that is the feeling of Dr. Dabney. I make this statement 
‘because the question has been asked me «as to whether or not 
this department at the University of Tennessee would not in- 
jure the Peabody Normal College. Upon the contrary, to quote _ 
the language of Dr. Payne in substance, he says: “If Lhadthe _ 
power of Bismarck, I would establish three normal colleges— 
one in the western division of the State, one in the middle 
division, and-one in the eastern division.” These are his feel- 
ings. Furthermore, that you may know that we are in perfect 
-accord, Dr. Payne may be considered, to a certain extent, a 
member of its faculty. While not elected, still he is to hold, 
» .semi-annually, a course of lectures of one week each at the in- 
-stitution which I have the honor of representing to you. — 
         
-P-A-G-E-416
Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ Assocration. 
    
_ I will say, further, that Captain Garrett, your State Superin- 
tendent, and his successor in office, whoever he may be, will be 
requested to deliver a course of lectures of one week annually 
in that institution. Captain Garrett has consented to do so, 
but the time has not yet been fixed. That will be part of the 
work in that institution of Captain Garrett and his successor. 
Now, we come to the scholarships. I may say that we have 
no scholarships in the sense of the scholarship in the Peabody 
Normal College. The requirements necessary to enter the 
Teachers’ Department of the University of Tennessee are that 
the young men must have a certificate of qualification from 
the County Superintendent. We require this, and shall not de- 
part from it. He must state that he intends to make teaching 
a profession. We require this pledge of him when he comes. 
He is then entered upon the roll as a member of the Teachers’ 
Department, and begins work. There is no expense attached 
to it in the way of tuition-fee whatever. The tuition is free. 
It is free to him so long as he remains in this department, and 
he can still go on higher, 'if he desires, after he completes the 
course in that department without any tuition. I say this as 
regards young men, you will notice, but I say that the doors of 
this institution are open to young men and young women alike. 
Now, why is there any qualification ? 
First, we may say that the University of Tennessee is a pe- 
culiar institution. It is in the city of Knoxville, but so remote 
from it, you may say (because the grounds are so large), that it 
is better for the students attending it to board at the college 
hall, where we have ample provisions for young men, but none 
for young-ladies ; so, if young ladies come, they must neces- 
sarily board in the city. If they should come, they would be 
received upon the same terms young men are received. They 
have nothing in the world to do but come up and take the 
- course. That is all that is necessary. 
We hope in the near future that we will be able to erect a 
building upon the grounds of the university that will give ac- 
commodation to young ladies equal to those now given to the 
young men. For the present we have not the money. We

asked the last Legislature to give us the money for the purpose 
of erecting this building, and they did not see proper to do so; 
but so soon as the public opinion in the State of Tennessee shall 
say to the Legislature—I am a great believer in this thing 
ealled public opinion—shall say to the Legislature and to the 
County Courts to make this appropriation, you may pnt it 
down that it will be done. We did not receive the appropria- 
tion because the Representatives know what the people want, 
and it is not worth while to grumble at your Represeutative in 
the matter of appropriations if he fails to vote as you think 
proper. In ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the reason 
why he votes that way is because a majority of his people 
want it that way. So with the County Court. When the 
County Court fails to levy a tax that the County Su- 
perintendent feels ought to have been levied, he may 
know that the court represents the public sentiment, and he 
must work up the public sentiment. When public sentiment 
reaches the proper point to secure the appropriation for the 
purpose of erecting a building or buildings, we shall have evi- 
dence of that public sentiment. The Peabody Normal College 
_was established, strange as it may appear, giving the State 
Board of Education the authority to control the school, but it 
should not be any expense to the State. The school has been 
established, and after six years the State appropriated $7,500; a 
few years later, $10,000, and last year the appropriation was in- 
creased to $15,000; and there is no individual living who will 
ever see the time that appropriation will be withdrawn from 
that institution. It is here, and as it grows older and stronger 
‘it will receive ample support from the State of Tennessee. 
Public influence backs it; they know what it is, and there are 
very few men can ever come to the Legislature that will raise 
their voices against it. 
The Teachers’ Department! of the University of Tennessee 
was opened last February, and I had been elected to take charge 
of it when my term as State Superintendent expired.. We had 
nineteen teachers enrolled, and sixteen stayed there during the 
entire term. I wiil say that the sessions will begin annually in 
February and close in June. The term is two years, each term
-P-A-G-E-418
        Pustic Scoot Orricers’ Assocratron. Oe 
of five months beginning in February. It is intended for these ‘ 
teachers all to be in the field at work, Of these nineteen teach- 
ers, the sixteen who made their stay during the entire term were 
employed without any trouble, and, from the reports I receive, 
they will be back with us next year. From their correspond- 
ence they say they will be back. One young man says: “I do 
not know what to do. I am employed at a salary of $70 a 
month. Before [ only received $30. I am employed for ten 
months, and have two teacher assistants. I shall not come back 
to your institution for another term.” I wrote him, advising 
him to stay for awhile. He can stay for a few years, and then 
come back and complete his course. With this exception, the 
report comes that those who were with us last year will be with: 
us agaln. ° 
I may say further, that I had a number of offers for young _ 
men to take permanent places, but I did not feel that I could ” 
recommend them, because they had not reached that point 
where I felt it was safe to recommend them for permanent. 
places. The course of study—I have some circulars here which: 
will give you that in full. Iam often asked the question as to 
whether young men can come there for one term, and receive a 
life certificate. I answer that question, and say, No. It is 
governed by the State Board of Education and the Board of 
Trustees of the University of Tennessee, and the requirement 
is that the young men must be there two terms of five months 
each. For the present, I say it is absolutely necessary. Again, 
Tam asked the question as to whether a teacher who isan A.B. 
of some other institution and has taught for five or six years, 
whether a life scholarship will be given him as an uouvrary de- 
gree, a mark of distinction. Answering that question, I. say, 
No; because the Trustees of the University say, No, and it is_ 
not the purpose of this institution to do any cheap finishing. 
This course of study must be completed before he can receive 
this life scholarship, and he must pass a satisfactory examina- 
tion. His class standing must be good, and his written exam- 
ination must be saticfactory, when the faculty of the University, - 
of Tennessee will pass upon it. That is what he must do. He 
cannot come there and pass along in a slipshod way, and re-

ceive a certificate at the close of the school. No certificate will 
be granted, except to those worthy of them. This is different 
from the course in the Peabody Normal College in some re- 
spects. After attending these two years of five months each, 
the pupil, passing a satisfactory examination, will be given a 
certificate, which exempts the holder from the examination nec- 
essary to teach in the schools of the State of Tennessee. An- 
other exception attached to it is in the way of tuition. There 
is none whatever. The circulars give you full information on 
this point, and I say to you that it means exactly what it says 
in the item of expense. The figures as given here show what 
will take a young man five months in that institution. Again, 
I say we are not competing with anybody. It is done for the 
benefit of she teachers, giving them an opportunity to take this 
course of two years of five months each, and we welcome all 
the young men who wish to come to us to take this course. 
The pupils must come there, receiving their tuition free, upon 
the recommendation of a County Superintendent of the State 
of Tennessee, provided he is past fifteen years of age and well 
qualified to enter the course of study as laid down in the cata- 
logue. 
The Teachers’ Department of the University of Tennessee 
will open on February 4 next. Any further information that 
may be necessary, I shall be glad to furnish you by correspond- 
ence, 
The report was received and unanimously adopted. 
President Smith resumed the chair. 
The President.—“ Next on our programme is the Tennessee 
School for the Blind. We will now have the report from Prof. 
Link.” 
Prof. Link.—“T shall not detain you many minutes, only to 
thank your body for giving me this opportunity to call your at- 
tention to the Tennessee School for the Blind, which is a State 
school, supported entirely by the State, and is for such children 
as cannot be educated at other schools. I should be glad to ex- 
press my approval of what I have heard here in this meeting, 
 
-P-A-G-E-420

‘and my very great interest in the publié schools of the State, — 
but will only take time to say that you have in your counties 
numbers of persons who cannot be educated at home who might 
be educated there if they once had a start, so they could study 
—would know how to study and would know how to learn, 
when their lessons were read to them by other persons. They 
are not likely to profit by that! until after they have learned how 
to study for themselves; and we have au institution here in this 
city which is ample for a larger number than has ever attended 
it, though for the last two or three years we have had the full — 
number for which the Legislature has made any appropriation, 
and we are now really full. until somebody leaves. We could 
hardly take more than one or two more pupils now. 
“JT will say that the Legislature has never refused, however, to 
- extend the proper aid to the pupils who attend, and would do 
more, if more pupils were likely to attend. The conditions are 
these: The pupil must be blind, or so nearly so as not to be 
able to be successfully educated at the public schools of Ten- 
nessee, and he must be of such health and character as would 
entitle him to admission into other schools, and he must be be- 
tween the ages of 7 and 17. Pupils entering before they are 17 
may be retained until they have passed the ordinary school age. 
We have the highest limit 17 from the fact that if they should 
wait beyond that age, and only remain until they are 20 or 21, 
the advantages would be slight; and then the fingers are so 
hardened after that age, and different habits are formed or not 
formed, that are in the way after that age, that it is only here 
and there a pupil would be benefited to any great extent when 
they enter after the age of 17 or 18. This was what was 
thought by those who had the school in charge at the time that 
regulation was made. Now, there are a large number of such 
children in the State—much larger than you think. It would 
be a surprise to some of these Superintendents if I should read 
the names of the scholars from their counties. There are a few 
Superintendents who know of such children, but there are quite 
a number who do not know of such children in their counties. 
‘This class of children are kept at home more than any other, 
and often near neighbors hardly know what the trouble is.

‘They know the children do not go to school*‘and do not go 
about much, but hardly know the reason. . The census shows a 
much larger number than we have room for. I suppose, of 
course, an examination of that list would show a number that 
would not be entitled. You will find them in your counties, 
most of you, if you will inquire when you are passing around 
among the schools, and we would be glad to have you commu- 
nicate with us in reference to any such children. We would 
make room for them, and take them just as soon as possible. 
“ While I have your attention, let me give you an invitation 
to visit the institution during your stay in Nashville, at any 
‘time you may wish to do so. Our doors are always open to the 
people of our State, and, during your stay in Nashville, we 
should be glad to have you visit the Tennessee School for the 
Blind. I thank you for your attention.”

THIRD DAY—Tuourspay, Duc. 10. 
The Association was called to order by the President, and 
opened with prayer by Prof. Thompson, of Bedford. 
Superintendent Allen acted as Secretary pro tempore. 
The President.— “ The next thing on our programme is ‘ The 
Public School System of Tennessee,’ by Superintendent Gar- 
rett. I now have the pleasure of introducing to you Hon. W. 
R. Garrett, Superintendent of Public Instruction.” 
Superintendent Garrett : 
“Mr. President, this is the first time, since I have had the 
honor to be in office as State Superintendent of Tennessee, that 
Ihave been able to gather my family together and to confer 
with its members from all parts of the State. I have not pre- 
pared a written address, but I feel satisfied that you do not de- 
sire any formal speech. This is a working body, and we have 
come together for work. It is a source of very great pleasure 
to meet so large an assemblage. I request the Secretary to in- 
form me how many counties are represented.” 
The President It is the largest gathering we have ever 
had.” i 
Superintendent Garrett.—* We sometimes have larger as- 
semblages, made up mainly of local attendance, but I have never 
known such a representative educational body gathered to- 
gether from all sections of the State. This is no ordinary as- 
sembly, and it speaks volumes, fellow Superintendents, it 
speaks volumes for the progress of education in the State, to 
~ see that, upon their meager salaries, and over such a broad ex- 
_ tent of territory as Tennessee stretches, the public school offi- 
cers of the State have come together to consult on educational 
matters. When I see this interest in the cause of education re- 
flected from the teachers’ eyes and hear it in their voices, I feel 
renewed confidence in the work which I have undertaken,

“Tt is a source of congratulation that our retiring President, 
in closing his connection with the Association with which he 
has been so long and so intimately connected, and of which he is 
the founder, shall find assembled such a body as this. It is also 
gratifying to note the presence of two ex-State Superin- 
tendents, each of whom has performed his allotted part in the 
progress of education, to the satisfaction of the educational 
masses of the State. 
“T listened with pleasure when, in his opening address, 
President Smith alluded to the short history of the organization 
of this body. He told you that it did not originate with him 
alone; that he was not the first to recommend it, and that 
our first State Superintendent, Col. Fleming, had called to- 
gether a similar body. He related his consultation with Super- 
intendent Trousdale and the retiring Superintendent, Hon. 
‘hos. H. Paine. He described their co-operation in Institute 
work, showing that his own work was the culmination of that 
of Ws predecessors, and a link in the regular chain of succes- 
sion, one Superintendent taking up the work as another left it 
off. So may our work in the future follow the law of healthy ~ 
growth. 
“Tet us glance at our public school system as itis now. In 
the first place, is our system perfect? Please reflect on this 
question. Is our Tennessee system of public schools a perfect 
system? If itis not a perfect system, wherein does it lack? 
Do we need any more laws? [Is it lacking in administration ? 
Do we need a more complete administration of our educational 
affairs? If we do not need law, and do not need administra- 
tion, what do we need? Do we need more money, or do we 
need a better administration of the fund we already have? If 
there are faults in the law, where are the faults? If there is a 
fault in the administration, where is that fault? Is it in the 
State part of the administration, in the county part, or is itin - 
the district part ? 
“Our system, as we all know, is a mixed system. It partakes 
of the nature of a State, county, and district system, and these 
several parts must work in harmony, like the machinery of a
-P-A-G-E-424
   Pusiic ScHoon OFFicERS’ ASssocrATIoN. Ba as: 
watch. No one part can go on unless the others perform their 
work. We have come here mainly as representatives of the 
State avd county administrations. We have comparatively 
few representatives from the district administration, where most 
of the power lies. The Superintendents can advise and recom- 
mend, but have comparatively little power. There is another 
question, and I ask you to consider it, not just for the few mo- 
ments while I am speaking, but to make it a daily considera- 
tion—I might say a life-time consideration. If our public school 
system is not perfect, can we make it perfect? What can we do 
to improve it? If we want to improve it, and if we have made 
up our minds to improve it, the State of Tennessee is strong 
enough, and the people of Tennessee are intelligent enough, 
and the school-ofticers have power enough—if our systemis not 
perfect, I say they have power enough to make it so. 
“Our system is not what it ought to be. It has faults. ‘Is it 
not wiser and better, instead of complaining of any faults it may 
have, to put our shoulders to the wheel and see that these faults 
are cured? The public school system is the system upon which 
the great mass of the people of our country must rely for the 
education of their children. I rejoice that the sentiment is 
spreading wider and wider over the State to rely upon it as the 
great medium of education. We should study and work to 
make it strong where it is weak. Tennessee can do it, and it is 
our duty to study the system, and guide it to a complete devel- 
opment. 
. “The next question that comes to us is: ‘What is the wisest 
and best way to go to work?’ Shall we do it all of a sudden, 
or shall we improve by progressive steps? Shall we employ 
some educational philosopher to devise a perfect school-law and 
_ have the next Legislature to put the new plan into operation ? 
Our old mother State, North Carolina, while a colony, con- 
cluded to establish a perfect system of laws, and thought the 
best plan would be to employ a great philosopher, whose name 
filled the world with the reputation of his wisdom. So they 
employed John Locke to write them a code of laws, and trusted 
to him to prepare them something better than the world ever 
saw before. The code was prepared and enacted, and when it
-P-A-G-E-425

went into operation one voice of remonstrance arose from every 
part of the land, and the code of the great philosopher was re- 
pealed, 
“ The people sometimes err, and so do allindividuals. Yet I 
place more confidence in the joint wisdom of all the people of 
the State than in the wisdom of any one man. Great public 
institutions cannot spring, like Minerva, ready grown from the 
brain of Jove. They must gtow. They must grow like the 
vine. They must be trained and pruned. 
“Tn guiding the development of our educational system, let us 
prune off the faulty branches, and aid the growth of the healthy 
branches. It is, perhaps, best to give attention to one or two 
points of improvement at a time, instead of attempting to make 
too many changes at once. I will now name two points, to 
which IT invite your attention, and in which I ask the co-opera- 
tion of all the school-officers throughout the State. 
“First, we need a change in the financial management. Iam __ 
now engaged in the preparation of my annual report, which is 
founded upon reports from the several counties. I regret to 
say that the reports so far regeived show a looseness in the finan- 
cial management of many counties. This is not the fault of the 
County Superintendent alone. The County Superintendent is 
not the financial officer. The school-fund does not pass through 
his hands. He knows nothing about it but what he acquires 
second-hand from the report of the County Trustee. The law 
requires no report from the Trustee until the end of the school- 
year, at which time he is required to make a fianancial report 
to the County Superintendent. The State Superintendent re- 
ceives the financial report from the County Superintendent. 
Experience shows that this system of financial reports is de- ~ 
fective. I think the law ought to be changed so that the Trus- 
tee shall render more frequent reports to the County Superin- 
tendent, and shall also report direct to the State Superintendent. 
“ Yet, taking the law as it now is, I think that the County Su- 
perintendent can do much to improve the accuracy of financial 
reports. It is hardly just to hold an officer responsible for the
-P-A-G-E-426
Pustic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTron. 115 
     accuracy of reports which he can receive only at second-hand, 
and for the management of a fund over which he can exercise 
no control. In addition to this, many County Superintendents 
are not accustomed to running finances. Many Superintend- 
ents are in the habit of confining their attention to the profes- 
sional part of the work. 
“ Yet itis your duty to give close and constant attention to the 
financial management. Even though you have no power to 
control the finances, yet you are inspecting officers, and it is 
your duty to inspect. The law reqnires you to report the finan- 
cial condition, and you are entitled to require such reports, and 
to make such examination of the finances as may be necessary 
to the faithful discharge of your duty. In any case where the 
County Trustee shall fail to make proper reports, or where 
there is any reason to suspect a mismanagement of the school- 
fund, it is your duty to report the matter to the County Court. 
It would, perhaps, do but little good to reportit to me, as I could 
aid you only by advice; yet, if any of you should prefer to re- 
port any such matters to me, I will use every means in my 
power to secure investigation and remedy. In securing sys- 
tematic financial management and accurate financial reports, I 
ask the co-operation of every school-officer and the co-opera- 
tion of County Trustees.

  “Tinvite your attention next to the recent changes in the 
school-law, in reference to grading and to secondary schools. 
Reports from seventy-eight counties show.that the number of 
primary schools in those counties is 4,794, and the number of 
secondary schools 423, the total number being 5,217 in the 
seventy-eight counties. Reports from other counties are com- 
_ ingin. I have not yet completed thelist. This makes eight per 
_ cent. of the schools secondary schools. You may say that in 
the State of Tennessee the ratio of the secondary schools to the 
total number is 8 per cent. I believe that is a very healthy 
sign. Pein ea a leet i ee eae 
“When the last Legislature assembled, there was much dif- 
ference of feeling among the members of the Legislature. 
Mee of os members came to the Legislature instructed by - 
  
-P-A-G-E-427
116 Pusiic Scuoon Orricers’ AssocraTion. 
  
their constituents, and reflecting the sentiments of their people. 
Some of them came with the idea that the public schools did 
not teach enough branches of study, and thought the law ought 
to be so-amended as to allow each school to teach what it 
pleased, without any limitation. A strong effort was made to 
change the school-law, and it came very near being so changed 
as to abolish all limitation over the curriculum of the schools. 
There was another element that did not go quite so far, but who 
favored introducing into the schools additional branches— 
mainly those branches which at present are enumerated in the 
secondary schools—and they desired to have those branches. 
taught in every school. There was another element, and quite 
alarge one, that favored no change at all. The Legislature 
finally compromised the whole matter, and enacted the present 
law. 
“Let us consider the question of grading the schools, and ~ 
take an example for illustration. Let us take a town in which 
there are 300 children to be educated, and let us suppose that 
all these children are going to school. Let us suppose that no. 
system has been introduced, and no limitations are placed. 
Each teacher teaches school as he pleases, gets all the pupils he 
can, and goes uhead for himself. Let us see what would be the 
result. You go into one school, and there are probably ten 
pupils in it, and in another there are probably twenty-five, and 
in another you may find 50, ete. In order that we may esti- 
mate it better, let us suppose that there are ten schools in the 
town and thirty pupils in each school. Let us examine one of — 
these schools. You will find pupils, as the college men say, 
from A BC to A. B. Some are studying Latin, some Greek, 
some higher mathematics, and some little fellow will come in 
with a book his grandfather studied, and say his parents want 
him to study it. I know something about such schools, for E 
have tried to teach such schools myself. I blamed myself that 
I did not accomplish much, but experience has taught me that 
it was not my fault, but the fault of the system. Let us see 
now what can be done in such schools. I want some of you to 
make the calculation. I hope you will spend a little time on 
this, and that yon will do a little of the thinking, and make the 
 
-P-A-G-E-428

calculation forme. On an average, how many recitations ought 
the pupils to make a day? Some of you answer?” 
The President.—“ I think a pupil. ought to make about four 
recitations a day.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—* Now, how long should an average 
recitation be?” 
A member.—“ Fifteen minutes to half an hour.” 
Superintendent Garrett.— Let us carry this further. Let us 
go into this school of thirty pupils, and let us suppose there are 
scholars from A B C’s up through the ’ologies, and suppose — 
they are so divided that you cannot put any two together in a 
class. Here are thirty pupils that ought to make four recita- 
tions apiece per day, and there are no two that can be put in a 
class together. Some one.of you make the calculation, and tell 
me how many recitations that teacher would have per day.” 
A member.—“ One hundred and twenty.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“ Now, then, in that school the 
teacher will have 120 recitations, which one gentleman says 
should be half an hour in ‘length. Some one of you tell me 
how many hours that teacher will be required to teach?” 
A member.— Sixty hours a day.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“Some one said fifteen minutes 
was enough for a recitation. That would be thirty hours. Can 
-any teacher do this work? Now we begin to sce what grading 
means, what classification means. The object of grading the 
schools is to bring the work within the teacher’s grasp. Then, 
it would take from thirty to sixty hours per day to teach a 
school of this kind, if you could not make any classification. 
“Of course, some imperfect classification would be made, but 
no system would-be introduced which could remedy the defects. 
Let us now suppose that the people begin to pay some atten- 
tion to their educational system, and begin to say to each other: 
‘We find that, for some cause, our schools are imperfect, and 
education in our town is all in a mess.” They create a board
-P-A-G-E-429
  ous 4 
Poustic Scuoot Orricers’ Assocration.     
of education to control educational affairs. The board selects 
a competent superintendent and employs, let us say, the same 
ten teachers. They build a school-house, and put ten rooms in 
it, and place their 300 children at school in this house. The 
superintendent organizes ten grades. He puts the little begin- 
ners into one grade, naming it the first grade. He selects the 
teacher who is best suited for primary work, and places her in 
charge of the first grade. Let us go into that room, and exam- 
ine its organization. 
“We find thirty pupils in two divisions of fifteen each. All 
_are at the same stage of advancement. One division recites 
while the other division is occupied with work at the seats. If — 
thirty minutes is consumed in each recitation, the two divisions 
will recite in one hour. If each pupil makes four recitations a 
day, the work is done in four hours. No pupil is neglected. 
The instruction which suits one suits all. Each pupil receives. 
its full share of the teacher’s attention. The little children do 
not have to wait hours at a time while the larger pupils are re- 
citing. They can be kept busy, the recitation and the seat- 
work alternating at regular intervals. The teacher can do bet- 
ter work, not being required to jump from one kind of work to 
another, and to spread from the first reader to trigonometry. 
The teacher’s mind and heart keep in tune to primary work. 
Does not such an organization bring the work within the reach 
and compass of the teacher, so that far better results will fol- 
low?) 
“JT do not mean to recommend the plan of grading that I 
have sketched above all other plans. In primary work, it would 
be better to have the recitations shorter—say fifteen minutes— 
and more frequent. I have sketched the plan simply for illus- 
‘tration. Let us now look at the other grades, and suppose that 
there are thirty pupils in each grade. Let us go into each 
room. We find asimilar order. In each room the pupils are 
so classified that the instruction which suits one suits all. - The 
teacher can conduct the recitations with ease, and each teacher 
is assigned to the grade for which he is best fitted. 
“T have so far supposed that ten teachers will be required for 
the instruction of the 300 children, but the work can be done

by alessnumber. Every consideration of efficiency and econ- 
omy urges the establishment of graded scHools in our towns 
and cities. : 
“Tt may be argued that while such a system is suited to the 
towns and cities, it cannot be applied to the country schools, for 
the reason that the country children cannot be collected to- 
gether in large schools. This is partly true. Yet the country 
schools can be graded in that sense of the word which our 
school-law attaches to the term. 
“Former laws provided that certain enumerated branches 
should be taught in the public schools, but failed to prescribe any 
regulations for the course of study in these branches, or to give 
eal idents any power to regulate the course of study. 
The result was that each school was a law to itself, and no com- 
mou standard could be reached, even in the district. It was en- 
tirely in the power of the teacher, if he saw fit, to have but one 
class in arithmetic in his school, into which pupils of all stages 
of advancement should be forced. In many eases, each pupil 
would have a different text-book, and there would be as many 
classes as text-books. Pupils going from one school to another 
would be placed at great disadvantage, and every change of 
teachers was a revolution. A reform was certainly needed to 
regulate the course of study in the enumerated branches. To 
accomplish this purpose, the last Legislature provided that 
every primary school shall be organized into five grades, and 
every secondary school into eight grades; so that each branch, 
    and subdivisions of each branch, may be located in the school 
course, and a place provided for each pupil suited to his stage 
of advancement. The grading of the schools of each county 
was placed in the hands of the County Superintendent, under 
_ the general regulations of the State Superintendent. 
“There can be no difficulty in grading the course of study in 
the country schools. There is no difficulty in dividing the 
course of a country primary school into five grades, or a secon- 
dary school into eight grades. The difficulty is found in pro- 
viding means to have these grades properly taught. In a 
country school where from thirty to sixty pupils are collected, 
it is often impossible to employ more than one teacher. Can 
   
-P-A-G-E-431

this teacher perform the work of teaching the five grades? It 
is no easy task; yet it can be done better when the school is di- 
vided into five grades than when it is ungraded. The work of 
the country teacher is the most difficult of all school-work, yet 
it can be done. He must teach more hours per day than the 
city teacher, and must resort to some lapping of grades, and 
other expedients to bring the work inside of seven hours. 
“We certainly cannot teach more than five grades. One 
teacher cannot perform the work of teaching a secondary 
school. The course of the secondary school embraces eight 
grades, and necessitates not less than thirty-two recitations. 
This work, no one teacher can perform properly. Some part 
of the work must be neglected, and those who are familiar with 
the schools of Tennessee know where that neglect always falls. 
It falls on the little children. Even the competent teacher is 
tempted to neglect the little children. _His thoughts and his 
sympathies are with the higher work. His reputation is in the 
higher work. A few advanced pupils take up the most of his 
time, and the little ones, just at the time of life when they need 
the guiding hand and constant care, are left to gather crumbs 
of instruction and scraps of attention.” 
The President—* That is very true.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“I felt it my duty to appear before 
the legislative committees, and to call their attention to these 
facts, and say to them, ‘ Whatever else you do, secure to us the 
primary education. Throw around the public schools such 
limitations as will protect the little children.’ Representatives 
of several counties urged, ‘ We do not want to neglect the little 
children; but why is it that, in order to protect other counties, 
you will not allow our counties, when we are ready for higher 
education, why will you not let us go ahead? We do not ask 
you to pass a law saying that the higher branches shall be 
taught in every school in the State, but let us have them in our 
counties.’ In order to meet these arguments, a law was framed 
to establish two classes of schools; one called primary, for the 
Jower branches, and the other secondary, in which the higher 
branches might be taught. It was deemed best to leave it to 
the discretion of the Directors to establish primary and second- 
-, ~~
-P-A-G-E-432
  Pusuic Scnoot OFrricers’ ASSOCIATION. 121 
  
ary schools according to their judgment of the needs of their 
communities. Iam free to confess that I feared that in many 
places the Directors would use this discretion to untie the limita- 
tions of the law, and would make all the schools secondary. I 
am happy to state that the Directors have used their power 
wisely, and have made only eight per cent. of the schools 
secondary. 
“T think it would be better if the law had remained as it was 
originally written. The bill, as first prepared, required that 
there should be not less than two teachers in each secondary - 
school, a principal and an assistant. It was amended to read, 
“The Directors may employ, when necessary, two teachers in 
each secondary school.’ 
“Task the co-operation of all Superintendents to guard the 
primary education ; to see that the foundation shall not be in- 
jured in putting on the superstructure. Let us jointly urge 
upon the Directors never to establish a secondary school with- 
out two teachers. Let us point out to them, that it is not the 
number of pupils, but the number of classes that consumes the 
time of the teacher; that no one teacher can properly do the 
work of a secondary school. Let us present this at the Insti- 
tutes, and at all educational gatherings. 
“T am a warm friend of secondary schools, and I was an ad- 
vocate of the amendment to the school-law which created them. 
Let us establish them judiciously, and not permit them to be 
used as a lever to overthrow primary education. It would bea 
good thing to have a secondary school at every man’s door, but 
the school revenues will not permit it. I have desired many 
good things in this life, but I could not pay for some of them. 
If I were disposed to be rhetorical or sensational, I could, per- 
haps, entertain you by painting some of the enticing things I 
have wanted. Possibly I might touch a sympathetic chord in 
the hearts of all who hear me me. In this life, we must limit 
our wishes by our means. In many districts, where the school- 
fund is not sufficient to establish additional schools, and where 
there are no means of increasing the fund, there is a demand 
for instruction in the higher branches. There is a strong temp- 
21s. p.1.—Ap. E.
-P-A-G-E-433
122 Pusiic ScHoot Orricers’ Association. 
  
tation to declare all the schools secondary, and thus attempt to 
meet the demand without increasing the expense. Many of the 
citizens will demand it, and cannot understand why it is re- 
fused. 
“A judicious County Superintendent may sometimes solve 
such u problem. He may find that there are, say six schools in 
the district, when five, or even four, would be sufficient. Ie 
may suggest that one or two of the schools be discontinued, so 
as to release a fund for the employment of an additional teacher 
in one of the centrally located schools. This school may be 
converted into a secondary school for the entire district. Some 
inconvenience would, of course, be caused to some of the pupils 
by being compelled to go a greater distance to school. But 
lesser considerations should yield to greater. Under our pres- 
ent laws and with our present revenues, I do not see any other 
way in which such a school-district as I have described can in- 
troduce higher education without injuring primary schools. 
Such an arrangement would certainly improve education in the 
district. It would be better than having no instruction in higher 
branches, and it would be better than destroying the efficiency 
of the primary schools. 
“Just in such matters as this the influence of a good County 
Superintendent may be beneficially felt. Our public school sys- 
tem is yet in its infancy. The people in many districts have 
not learned fully the best use to make of it. I have great con- 
fidence in the good sense of the people of Tennessee. The 
economy of school-management has not been sufliciently 
brought to_their attention. When these matters are clearly 
brought before them, their native good sense will lead them 
aright. The people of each district will see that the educational 
interests of the district are all in the same boat—that they must 
work together to a common end. 
«“T will relate an incident that occurred in my experience as_ 
a County Superintendent in 1873: I visited a district in which 
the Directors had a fund sufficient to maintain three schools for 
nine months. After consultation, they decided that three 
schools would amply supply the needs of the entire district.
-P-A-G-E-434
_Pusiic Scuoon Orrrcers’ Association. 123   
The teachers were employed, and the schools opened. At once 
a clamor arose. A portion of the patrons of one of the schools 
demanded the right to send to a teacher of their choice. They 
insisted that they paid taxes, and demanded an additional school 
for their teacher. The Directors yielded, and placed the addi- 
tional school a short distance from the other school. Demands 
followed from other neighborhoods. On my next visit, I found 
nine schools in that district. A simple calculation of arithme- 
tie will show that a fund which will maintain three schools nine 
months, will maintain nine schools only three months. Thus, 
the children of the district were made to suffer by the injudi- 
cious use of the school-funds. 
“T mention this incident to show the importance of the ecb- 
nomical and judicious use of the present funds. In order to 
secure this judicious administration, it is necessary that these 
things should be explained to the people. They should be pre- 
sented clearly and boldly, but respectfully and cordially. Here 
is the field for the County Superintendent. 
“TJ will allude, in conclusion, to one other matter. In many 
counties, the County Superintendent has no separate office. T 
recommend every Superintendent to urge the County Court to 
provide him a separate office, and facilities for preserving school- 
records and supplies. It costs the State a considerable amount 
of money annually to provide registers, diplomas, certificates, 
and other school supplies. These supplies, and the records of 
the office ought to be carefully preserved. Many of the newly 
elected County Superintendents have complained that their 
predecessors left no records. I hope that none of these will 
give their successors an opportunity to make a similar com- 
plaint. 
“Tn reference to the certificates required by law to be awarded 
to pupils completing the primary school course, and diplomas 
to those completing the secondary school course, I have issued 
a circular, to which I invite your attention. I have deposited 
with each County Superintendent as many of these diplomas 
and certificates as 1 judged would be sufficient for the present 
year, I will send, upon the requisition of any County Superin-
-P-A-G-E-435

tendent, as many more as he may need. I ask the co-operation 
of all Superintendents in seeing that they are awarded only to 
those who merit them, and upon written examination. They 
are sent to each Superintendent in blank, and should not be al- 
lowed to go out of his office until they are issued, with the 
blanks properly filled, to those entitled to receive them. The 
written examinations upon which they are awarded, should be 
filed in the office of the Superintendent, and preserved as 
_records. I ask your co-operation to make these diplomas and 
certificates valuable testimonials, which shall not be issued as a 
matter of course, but shall be awarded only upon merit. 
“T have been notified that several Superintendents desire to 
ask me questions in reference to points of school-law. I will 
take pleasure in answering to the best of my ability.” 
Superintendent Allen.—* How long would you recommend 
the preservation of official papers?” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“‘During the Superintendent’s 
term of office, and to be handed over to his successor.” 
Superintendent Abernathy.—‘ You send out these blanks 
with your name signed to them, to the County Superintend- 
ents?” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“I deposited a small number of 
them with the County Superintendents. My name is signed to 
them in blank. It would be impossible for me to sign them 
otherwise.” 
Superintendent Abernathy.—< One thing I would like to 
know. We. have a few secondary schools, but I think that 
probably a large proportion of our children will never be able 
to attend secondary schools, and I think every boy and girl 
ought to know something of the laws of health, and of his goy- 
ernment. Would it be a violatiow of the law, or not, to insert 
these two studies in the primary schools—physiology and civil 
government?” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“ The law provides that certain 
branches shall be taught, and no others, and, of course, when it
-P-A-G-E-436

comes to a question of the law, the law speaks for itself. In a 
primary school, if the teacher, as a matter of exercise, chooses 
to say any thing on these points informally, I suppose there 
would be no objection; but so far as the law speaks, I think it 
‘is the spirit of the law to protect the primary schools from the 
introduction of such branches as conflict with primary work.” 
Mr. Baker.—‘ Has the County Superintendent to pass upon 
the papers sent him before issuing the certificates, or are they 
graded*by the teacher who makes the examination ?” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“ You will find printed instructions 
in the circular. If a teacher reports the examination of a pu- 
pil, and sends in his examination papers with a list showing 
how he was graded, I would take his examination, unless the 
matter was questioned or some reason given to the contrary, or 
unless the grading was absurd. The only controversy that is 
likely to occur is when the party claims that he has not been 
fairly examined or that he has been refused examination. You 
can review the examination papers and confer with the teacher, 
but you cannot force him to sign. The law says the certificate 
or diploma shall be signed by the State Superintendent, the 
County Superintendent, the teacher, and the Directors, and if 
any party cannot, upon his own judgment and conscience, sign 
it, nobody can make him, unless it be the courts, and I do not 
think that any court has power to make him.” 
Superintendent Stephens.—* In our county, we have what 
we call consolidated schools. We have had the Directors de- 
clare these schools secondary schools, giving free tuition to 
those who were entitled to it. We have been accustomed to 
giving this free tuition to the primary grade, and to charge 
tuition to those in the higher grades. I do not know whether 
these are really secondary schools or not. They are continued 
on, and some of the pupils are charged tuition, and some are 
not. The tuition is charged to all those incladed in the second- 
ary grades.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“T should rule that every school 
that is not declared a secondary school is a primary school.” 
Superintendent Stephens.—* The Directors consolidated with
-P-A-G-E-437
126° Pusure Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTion. ’ 
  
the trustees of these schools in this manner, and in this way 
we get all the tuition that comes to these schools for the public 
fund, and this gives the pupils the advantages of the studies 
taught in the secondary schools, and makes the school-term 
much longer.” ‘ 
Superintendent Garrett.—* That question has been presented 
to me in several forms. As a general rule, I take the law to be 
this: The law says the Directors shall establish primary Schools, 
and may establish secondary schools. It makes it the duty of 
the Directors to declare every school either primary or second- 
ary. Under these circumstances, where a school,is not de- 
clared to be secondary, prima facie it is a primary school. 
Where a contract is made with the teachers of a private school 
or academy to teach the public school branches, these branches 
constitute the public school part of the consolidated school, 
and must be taught free of charge, and are as much under the 
control of the public school authorities as if no such consolida- 
tion had been made. The question arises, then, if the Directors 
make a contract of consolidation with such a school without 
specifying whether the public school is primary or secondary, 
is it consolidated as a primary or a secondary school? If it is 
consolidated as a primary school, the branches included in the 
primary schools shall be taught free, and, if as a secondary 
school, the brauche’ included in the secondary schools shall be 
taught free. I would think, in the absence of any designation 
by the Directors, that the school is consolidated as a primary 
school, because some definite action is required by the Directors 
to make a school secondary. As to whether it is a wiser policy 
to make a school primary or secondary before consolidating it, 
is, of course, a matter for the judgment and discretion of the 
Directors. As a general rule, I think it would be better to con- 
solidate as a primary school, because the school would run 
longer on the same amount of money.” 
Superintendent Miller—<It has been the practice in my 
county for a number of years for the Trustee three times a year 
to make settlement with the teachers. This makes it a hard- 
.ship upon the teachers. They have to wait so long for their
-P-A-G-E-438
Pusiic ScHoot Orricers’ AssocraTIon. 127 
  
salaries, and the money is lying there idle in the bank. I want 
some information as to how to change that.” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“ The law, in substance, provides 
that as soon as the Trustee receives any fund he shall report 
the same to the County Superintendent and to the Directors of 
each school-district. He then holds the share of each district 
subject to the order of the Directors, and he has no right to re- 
fuse payment to any teacher presenting him a warrant properly 
drawn. He has no authority to designate fixed and remote 
dates for paying warrants. It is his duty to pay them when 
presented at his office. I would draw his attention to the law, 
and if he failed to comply with it, I would report the matter to 
the County Court.” 
Superintendent Miller.— Our present Trustee is a nice gen- 
tleman. This has been the custom of our former Trustees, and 
he is only following in their footsteps.” 
“Superintendent Garrett.—‘He will then, of course, be 
ready to comply with the law.” 
On motion, Superintendent Garrett’s address was received, 
and ordered published with the proceedings of the Association. 
The President.— The next thing on the programme is the 
report of the Committee on Amendments to the School Law. 
We will now have their report.” 
Superintendent Paine——‘‘ Mr. President, the Committee on 
Amendments to the School Law has had under consideration 
different points connected with this subject. We have had two 
very interesting and harmonious sessions, and, after considering 
the matter, the Committee has decided to make the following 
report: 
“They fully appreciate the difficulty in getting work of this 
kind indorsed by so many persons as are here present, and the 
still greater difficulty of getting it properly before the Legisla- 
ture. As Superintendent Garrett has well said, it is a difficult 
matter to make a law—a good one. I may say that the Com-
-P-A-G-E-439

mittee thought it best not to ask too much, and undertook to 
shape something for your consideration that they thought 
would be regarded by the Legislature as not being unreason- 
able; because we go on the general idea that if we go to that 
body to do any thing, it must be made to appear to them that it 
ought to be done, and will be a benefit to the general system. 
We have not, therefore, asked very much. The report of the 
Committee is as follows:” : 
Report or THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS To THE ScuooL Law. 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention to recom- 
mend the following amendments to the school-law: 
1. That the County Courts of the various counties be pro- 
hibited from making school-districts without consent of the 
County Superintendent. 
2. That it shall be the duty of the County Superintendent to 
approve all warrants for school supplies. 
8. That the County Superintendent be required to keep a 
book of finances, in which shall be recorded all orders signed by 
him. : 
4. (a) That a County Board of Education, consisting of five, 
with the County Superintendent an ex officio member, be es- 
tablished in each county of the State, said board to be appointed 
by the County Court. That it shall be the duty of said Board 
of Education to audit all accounts of the County Trustee in 
reference to the receipts and disbursements of the school-fund ; 
regularly to inspect the same, and to see that all school-moneys 
of the county are properly applied and accounted for, and, in 
case of any misapplication of the school-fund by any of its offi- 
cers, it shall be the duty of said Board to report the same to the 
County Court. 
(6) It shall be the duty of the County Board of Education to 
regulate all matters pertaining to the question of selecting text- 
books for the county, and they may adopt a uniform series of 
books which shall be used in the schools of the county. It 
shall further be the duty of the Board to prescribe general 
regulations for the schools of the county not inconsistent with
-P-A-G-E-440
Pusiic Scuoon Orricers’ Assocration. 129 
  
the provisions of the school-law. They shall have power to fix 
the minimum number of pupils to a school, and where the at- 
tendance of any school shall fall below said minimum, it shall 
be the duty of the Directors of the districts in which said school 
is located to at once stop the school. 
5. That the County Court shall set apart, in the court-house, 
an office for the use of the County Superintendent exclusively, 
in which shall be kept all records of the County Superintend- 
ent; said records to be handed down to succeeding County Su- 
perintendents as matters of record. 
6. That the State Superintendent be empowered to enforce 
regulations which he may make, as provided by law. 
7. That Section 45, Chapter 25 of Acts of 1873 be so amended 
as to require the Trustee to make a financial report to the State 
Superintendent of all receipts and disbursements of the school- 
fund, said report to be made by Sept. 15 of each year, and that 
in case of the failure to make such report, that the State Super- 
intendent shall report the same to the October term of the 
County Court for investigation. 
8. That it is the sense of this convention to recommend that 
some provision be made in order that all children of the 
county may receive equal benefits of the school-fund (that is, 
equal number of days), as contemplated by the Constitution of 
the State.

The report of the committee was unanimously adopted. 
The President.—“I have received two letters from Dr. Dab- 
ney, of the University of Tennessee; one on the first day of the 
session, saying that he would be here if he was able, and 
another, later, saying that it was impossible for him to be here,

as he was confined to bed by sickness. He sends as a substi- - 
tute a gentleman long connected with the public school system 
of Tennessee, and the first’: County Superintendent of Knox 
County. Iam glad to have the pleasure of introducing to you 
the substitute of Dr. Dabney, Prof. T. C. Karns. He will re- 
port for the University of Tennessee.” 
Prof. Karns.—* As we are pressed for time, I am glad to say 
that the report I have to read to you is not a very long one. 
Dr. Dabney told me that the matter he had to communicate was 
largely such as he had communicated before, and it would not 
be necessary to repeat it.” 
The report is as follows : 
Tue University or TENNESSEE. 
GrntLEMEN—We desire most sincerely to thank the State Su- 
perintendent and the County Superintendents who have co- 
operated with us in carrying out the State law with regard to 
the appointment of students to free scholarships in the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee. Our State Superintendent did his part very 
efficiently, and a large majority of the County Superintendents 
put forth special efforts to fill the vacancies this year. For the 
information of new Superintendents, it is well to recall the 
method of making these appointments. It is given in Sections 
327 to 829 of the Code. : 
The State Superintendent issues notices to the County and 
City Superintendents in the month of May of each year, re- 
quiring them to hold examinatious of candidates for appoint- 
ments in their respective counties or cities, and giving direc- 
tions as to these examinations. 
The County and City Superintendents are required to give 
public notice, and to hold such examinations as may be neces- 
sary during the month of June. From the list of candidates 
found qualified and numbered in the order of merit, each State 
Senator and Representative can appoint two young men to 
scholarships in the University. State Senators and Represent- 
atives can appoint other persons not on this list, but in doing so
-P-A-G-E-442
Pusiic Scuoot OFFicers’ ASssocration. 131 
  
they take the responsibility for their preparation. The students 
thus appointed must be at least fifteen years of age, and pre- 
pared to enter regular collegiate classes as described above. 
Senators and Representatives are requested to make their ap- 
pointments subject to these competitive examinations of appli- 
cants by the County or City Superintendents of public schools. 
In order that no worthy young men who pass these exami- — 
“nations may fail to get the advantages of the University, the 
president of the University is authorized by law to appoint 
such qualified candidates to any vacancies which may remain to 
be filled in any county or district on the tenth of August of each 
year. Candidates for these scholarships should address the 
president of the University, giving the county, age, and quali- 
fications, or see their County Superintendents. 
As requested by this Association, the State Superintendent 
had prepared and sent out this year printed questions and in- 
structions for holding these examinations. Notices were pub- 
lished in a good many of the State and county papers, and the 
examinations appear to have been held regularly in at least 
a majority of the counties. In other counties they were held 
at irregular times, and the names sent directly to the president 
of the University. 
We think it is not the fault of the State Superintendent and 
the County Superintendents that this method does not work 
satisfactorily and accomplish all that the law intended it should 
accomplish. After trying it thoroughly, it is plain that it does 
not secure as many or as good students for the University as it 
was supposed it would. After all of the efforts put forth this 
last year, only about twenty-five of the County Superintendents 
secured and reported any students for scholarships. These 
twenty-five Superintendents examined and recommended fifty- 
two young men, an average of a little over two apiece. A 
number of Superintendents reported that the examinations 
were advertised, but that no candidates appeared. A large 
number never reported at all. Scholarships, either from Rep- 
resentatives and Senators or from the president of the Univer- 
sity, were issued to all young men so recommended. A much
-P-A-G-E-443
132 Pustic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTION. 
  
larger number appeared at the University at the opening of the 
session to stand the examination there. As the president is 
authorized to issue scholarships to all who apply for them after 
the tenth day of August and can stand the necessary examina- 
tion, all those found qualified were admitted. 
Altogether, seventy-two new students appeared at the Uni- 
versity, were examined, and admitted. A large number of 
those who obtained scholarships through the County Superin- 
tendents have not appeared yet. Perhaps they will at the 
opening of the second term, as a good many of them are teach- 
ers in the common schools, and propose to enter the Teachers” 
Department. Altogether, through the efforts of the County 
Superintendents, Representatives, Senators, and the president 
of the University, who issues appointments only upon the con- 
dition that the students pass the examinations of County Super- 
intendents or at the University, there were issued to old and 
new students together, 299 scholarships. 
Up to date this session, 163 of these have appeared and en- 
tered. Several who reported for examination at the University 
were found deficient, and returned home. Not quite half of 
- those recommended by County Superintendents have reported 
up to date. It appears, therefore, that these examinations play 
but a small part in influencing students to come to the Univer- 
sity. A great majority of the students who enter here come 
directly to the University of their own accord, and pass their 
examinations on the spot. I will not undertake to account for 
this, but will only remark that the County Superintendents who. 
advertised and held examinations seem to have had good suc- 
cess. Probably if all of them would put forth as good efforts 
as the twenty-five mentioned above, they could do equally as 
well. If each one of our one hundred Superintendents would 
send us two students from his county, there would be at least 
200 students in the academic department of the University of. 
Tennessee, instead of 163, as at present, and the number coming 
voluntarily would run this total up very considerably. 
It is certainly worth considering whether there are not seri- 
ous defects in this system of holding examinations which might
-P-A-G-E-444
Pusuic Scnoot Orricers’ Assocration. 133 
  
be remedied. If this is the best that can be done, it would ap- 
-pear that the game is hardly worth the candle, and the whole 
system might as well be abolished. We propose, however, with 
the co-operation of the State Superintendent, to test the sys- 
tem more thoroughly next year, and then to recommend the 
next General Assembly either to modify or to abolish it. It 
will be time enough to consider and discuss what shall be done 
at the meeting of this Association a year from now; but, in the 
meantime, we ask every County Superintendent to assist us in 
making a thorough test of the method, and in considering what 
changes, if any, need to be made in it. Let us have your most 
earnest and effectual co-operation this next year, and see if the 
present law can be made to work satisfactorily. - If it cannot, 
then let us have your advice, based upon the experience which 
you shall have accumulated, as to what shall be done in the 
premises. 
We are greatly gratified to be able to report success and prog- 
ress in every department and in connection with every interest 
of the University. 
The vacancy in the chair of agriculture has been filled by the 
election of Major Charles F. Vanderford, recently Secretary of 
the Bureau of Agriculture. The term of service of Lieutenant ~ 
Gayle having expired, his place was filled by the appointment 
of Lieutenant L. D. Tyson, of the United States Army, to be 
professor of military science and tactics. The University suf- 
fered a great loss in the death of the distinguished jurist and 
dean of its law department, Judge Thomas J. Freeman. Oc- 
curring so soon after the establishment of this department, 
which is scarcely a year old, this was a terrible blow to the 
school of law, which promised to be very popular and useful. 
His place was filled by the election of Judge Henry H. Inger- 
soll, dean of the law department, and Prof. Geo. E. Beers, pro- 
fessor of law. Though they were only able to take hold of the 
work late in the year, I am pleased to say that the law depart- 
ment is going forward with every promise of success. Dr. 
Geo. F. Mellen, Ph.D., of the University of Leipsic, was elected 
to fill the i py estobhishad chair of Greek and French, and 
entered upon pus duties at the opening of the current session.
-P-A-G-E-445

A new chair of physics and electrical engineering has been es- 
tablished, and will be filled at the opening of the next session. 
There are now fifteen different schools in our academic depart- 
ment, each in charge of a full or associate professor. These 
professors are assisted by seven assistants and instructors. The 
law department has two professors and nine lecturers. The 
Teachers’ Department, under the direction of Prof. Frank M. 
Smith as principal, has the services of the entire academic staff 
in carrying out its course of instruction. Prof. Smith, who is 
present with you, will explain the workings of this department 
to you. . 
The elegant new Science Hall is now nearly completed. It 
has taken along time to bring this superb building to comple- 
tion, but it is all the better on that account. It will add very 
largely to the facilities of the University for teaching chemistry, 
physics, and civil and mechanical enginvering. It also contains 
what we have long needed, a large assembly hall for public 
lectures, commencemeut exercises, ete. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association and -Gymnasivum 
Building, erected by the efforts of the students, and opened in 
September, this year, has proved a very great advantage to 
them. It contains parlors and reading rooms for social and 
literary purposes, a splendidly equipped gymnasium, baths, 
lockers, and other conveniences. An instructor in physical 
culture is employed in connection with the gymnasium, and 
regular classes have been organized in this subject.” 
We append statistics showing the actual attendance up to 
date. You will recall that the Teachers’ Department does not 
open until the beginning of the second term, and that we al- 
ways receive Jarge numbers of old and new students at that 
time from that growing class of young men who teach during 
the fall in our public schools. 
In conclusion, gentlemen, we thank you on behalf of the 
University for your interest and co-operation in the past, and 
_ ask your assistance in making a thorough test of the present 
method of county examinations during the coming year.

‘Professor Karns.—‘“I represent Dr. Dabney, and would say 
that the facilities for educating a great number of young men, — 
a much larger number than we now have, are good. We would 
like to have the co-operation of every county and of the State 
Superintendent. This institution belongs to the State, and the 
whole State should reap the benefits of it. It was established 
by the general government, and the work is being pushed more 
vigorously now than ever before. The attendance has increased 
since Dr. Dabney came there. He has increased the number 
largely, and I think that by the end of this year he will make 
the number larger than ever before. Still there ought to be a 
great many more, and, by the help and co-operation of the 
public school officers all over the State, we hope to have this 
number largely increased. If any questions are to be asked, 
and there is time to answer them, I shall be glad to answer 
them fully.” 
Superintendent Abernathy.—* I would like to make a state- 
ment, and then ask a question. I went out this summer for 
the purpose\of making an examination for a scholarship in the 
University of Tennessee, and the party who intended going 
was told that it was the practice of that institution to haze new 
students, which prevented him from going. I find this senti- 
ment throughout the country, and do not know whether it is 
true or not. I have been told that now, under the management 
of Dr. Dabney, it is not practiced. I would like to know how 
this is.” \
-P-A-G-E-448
Pusric Scoot Orricers’ Assocrarion. © 187 
  
The President.—* We have in this room one of the pupils 
of that University. I do not know whether he was hazed last 
year or not. Superintendent Harned is here, who is a member 
of our organization. We would be glad to know what he has 
to tell about the boys.” : 
Superintendent Harned.—‘I do not think any thing was 
done by the boys. As to myself, nothing happened to disturb 
me. Iam glad to say so.” 
Superintendent Abernathy.—“ Were you hazed?” 
Superintendent Harned.—*< No, sir!” 
The President.—“I want to make the statement that I do 
not believe there is an institution on earth where occasionally 
some of the boys will not try some kind of a trick, and when 
a new pupil comes in they will occasionally try him by some 
kind of a prank. So far as hazing is concerned, nothing of 
this kind is done at the University. Sometimes the boys may 
gather together and go to a new student’s room or play some 
trick on him, but when any thing of this kind comes to the 
knowledge of the faculty they stop it. I believe there was a 
case where one boy was sent away for carrying a thing of this 
kind too far, but that is being broken up now in this country. 
Before Dr. Dabney came the institution had not had a president 
for a number of years, and the school had gone down greatly. 
After Dr. Dabney came that kind of thing was broken up. He 
has tried very hard to improve the morals of the school; and 
while there may occasionally be special cases of pranks being 
played on students that I do not know of, if it is done, it is 
done privately. The morals of the school are as good as those 
of any school of the kind in the country. To show you how 
the morals of the school have improved under the present man- 
agement, the students have built, largely at the expense of 
themselves, a Young Men’s Christian Association building, at 
a cost of $5,000, and have an assembly-room and reading-room. 
A large number of the boys belong to this Association and at- 
tend the meetings.” 
Superintendent Tanner.—*I know a young man who has 
22 s. p.1.—Ap. E,
-P-A-G-E-449
138 Pusiic ScHoot Orricers’ AssocraTIoN. 
  
been in that school, and he is a model young man. He tells me 
emphatically that the moral tone of this institution is good.” 
The Presideat.—“ I will ask Mr. Harned how many young 
men in the Teachers’ Department are coming back well 
pleased ?” 
Superintendent Harned.—“I do not know.” 
The President. ate ean is that all will be back, 
with one exception.” 
Superintendent Paine.—*I move that the very able and full 
report just read by Prof. Karns be received.” 
The report was received by the unanimous vote of the Asso- 
ciation. 
The President.—“I take the liberty of introducing to you, 
under the head of our three-minute addresses, a gentleman well 
known to all of you, and one fully identified with the school- 
work of this State. I refer to Dr. G. W. F. Price, president of 
the Nashville College for Young Ladies. He is with us, and I 
want to hear his voice in this meeting.” 
Dr. Price.—“* Mr. President, there is not a body of people — 
in the world whom I meet with greater satisfaction and per- 
sonal pleasure than the members of this body. I claim no 
fitness for addressing you, beyond the fact that Iam one of that 
company of martyrs to the public good known as ‘the teach- 
ers. We are expected to know more than anybody else in the 
world, from the daily affairs of life to the universal geography 
of the world; the calculations which determine the times and 
the seasons, and from that sweeping on down through the en- 
tire list. We are expected to know more, and we are held in a 
more responsible relationship to the public than any other class 
of citizens. In making this broad assertion, I do not except 
even the sacred desk, though I myself very unworthily exercise 
that function. I do not except that, for the teacher who knows 
his duty and performs it conscientiously is truly at the same 
time a teacher of righteousness as well as a teacher of the 
‘
-P-A-G-E-450
  Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ Assocration. 139 
  
sciences, and you hold within your grasp an absolute influence 
on the destinies of this country. You are shaping the moral 
nature of the country. The teachers of this country have a 
power that is not surpassed by that of any other class. How 
often has this been shown in the experience and observation of 
the gentlemen whom I address! 
“You have seen a boy, by his teacher’s influence, brought 
out from himself and from his surroundings; from the influences 
of his home, possibly, and made a cultured and refined citizen. 
This has been done by the noble efforts of the teacher in the 
school-room. The influence there exercised overcomes the in- 
fluences that have surrounded him in his associations and in his 
home. The teacher’s influence stimulates all the finer sensi- 
bilities of his nature and lifts him above his surroundings, and 
makes him as God intended him to be, a noble man. Therefore 
- I say to you that I believe your power and influence are not 
even surpassed by that of the sacred desk. In speaking to a 
gentleman of this city (Dr. Smith) I said to him, ‘1 have the 
advantage of you. I speak to an audience at my own school, 
and I can compel them to sit still and make them listen to me. 
Ican command them as my household. Once a week you ad- 
dress your public assembly, and they are uneasy and restless, 
and you cannot hold their attention, possibly for a single hour. 
In the school-room we have the pupils under our command.’ 
“Excuse me if I transgress the limit of three minutes. I am 
delighted to meet you always, and anxious to see you at my 
house, the Nashville College for Young Ladies. I have been 
able to secure the friendship of the teaching profession through- 
out the State, and have received many testimonials from the 
teachers of the State indorsing the work that we have done. 
Weare trying to do the highest possible work for our young 
ladies, and I want you, if there is at any time in your com- 
munity a young lady who has been struggling for a higher 
education, and who is seeking for an opportunity to obtain it, 
to remember the Nashville College for Young Ladies.” 
The President.—“I know you will pardon me for introducing
-P-A-G-E-451
140 Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ ASSOCIATION. 
  
to you a gentleman—his name is Smith. I take pleasure in 
introducing to you Dr. Smith, of Greene County.” 
Dr. Smith.— “I am certainly very much embarrassed at being 
called upon just at this juncture, and especially to follow such a 
distinguished gentleman as the one who has just addressed you. 
Had I been called upon before this, perhaps I might have been 
able to entertain you for three minutes much better than I will 
now be able to do. But I know that an apology is a poor horse 
to ride in company. While from my sentiments, and in my 
life-work I am a school-man, I am a very sick man just now, 
and have been since Monday morning; still I represent what I 
regard as the banner county of East ‘Tennessee, Greene County. 
I am at a loss just now to know what to say, as my county has 
been represented by my friend, E. M. Wright. I do not know 
what he has said, but knowing he is a modest man naturally, 
and will not do himself justice, I will say that if you want to 
attend the best schools in all East Tennessee—not upper East 
Tennessee, but in all East Tennessee—visit Greene County. | I 
know Prof. Huffaker and others will sustain me in that. If he 
does not, I will have to refer you to my distinguished friend, 
Prof. Karns, and to Superintendent Douglass, of Gallatin, who 
will bear me out when I say, if you want to attend the best In- 
stitutes and Normals in the State, you have only to come to 
Greeneville. Weare in running order in East Tennessee, and 
Greene County is the banner county of the State. While we 
have these fine Institutes in our county, still we have not the 
money we need. In my judgment, we do not need better super- 
intendents, but we need more money. We need the salaries 
raised, and we need the salaries of our teachers raised. Our 
officers understand this, and I tell you that I am not laying too 
much stress upon this. The presiding officer understands this, 
and he knows I am not putting too much stress upon it. When 
Capt. Smith was presiding officer, he came up to Greeneville. 
We wrote to him that we wanted him to come there and ad- 
dress our County Court. At the conclusion of his speech, they 
raised the salary of our County Superintendent, and have been 
raising it all the time. Now, I only want to ask, in conclusion, 
that Superintendent Garrett, when he comes in January, if he
-P-A-G-E-452

talks to our County Court, we want the salary of Prof. Wright 
raised, so as to enable him to be in the saddle 365 days in the 
year.” 
‘The Executive Committee submitted, through Miss Nannie 
Scott, a report recommending that the following be elected 
officers of the Association for the ensuing year: President, W. 
H. Payne, Nashville; Vice-president, Thos. H. Paine, Jackson; 
Secretary and Treasurer, Frank Goodman, Nashvilie. Execu- 
tive Committee: H. D. Huffaker, chairman, Chattanooga; E. 
M. Wright, Greeneville; Miss Nellie O'Donnell, Memphis; A. 
8. Abernathy, Pulaski; Chas. 8. Douglass, Gallatin. 
These officers were elected. 
The President.—“I have the pleasure of introducing to you 
Dr. Payne, who has been unanimously elected President of this 
organization for the ensuing year.” 
Dr. Payne.—“T will say that this honor was wholly unex- 
pected by me, but I will accept the trust, and perfcrm the 
duties of the position to the best of my ability. I have spent 
about twenty years of my life in school-work and in the profes- 
sional work, and have a natural liking for men and women 
working in this field. It is a field that I have studied to a con- 
siderable extent, and I have found that we can all find places to 
work in. So far as I can learn as to the condition of things in 
Tennessee, we have an abundance of work to do. Sometimes 
we think that matters are in a very rude shape, and desire to be 
in places where all parts of the machinery are in better running 
order. For my part, Iam glad I am in a place where there is 
a great deal of work to do, and I feel that that place suits me 
best where I can do this kind of work. I am grateful for the 
opportunity of attending this meeting. I have learned a great 
many things. I shal] strive, being your public servant for the 
coming year, and so far as I have ability, I shall use it to ad- 
vance the interests of this Association and of the State of Ten- 
nessee. I have been a resident of Tennessee only a few years, 
but I love the State with all my heart. I feel that it is a great 
honor you have conferred upon me, and I shall serve you to the 
best of my ability.” :

The President.—“ Superintendent Paine, it affords me pleas- 
ure to announce to you that you have been elected Vice-presi- 
dent of this Association.” 
Superintendent Thomas H. Paine.—“TI have listened to-day 
to the discussions with a great deal of interest, and have done 
what little I could to add to the interest of these exercises. It 
never occurred to me at all that my name would be placed in 
nomination for any position. I came with the expectation of 
rendering any service I could, and, like my distinguished name-* 
sake, I shall assume the position, and do all that is in my power 
to advance the interests of this Association.” 
The President.—“ Professor Goodman, it is with peculiar 
pride that I announce to you that you have again been elected 
Secretary and Treasurer of this Association for the ensuing year.” 
Professor Goodman.— The next thing on the programme ‘is 
—Professor Allen will make my speech for me. In the future, 
as in the past, when I get a little more age and experience, I 
hope to do better. I will try just as hard for you, and will do 
any thing I can that will add to your pleasure and enjoyment, 
and also to your profit. This work is my picnic, being here 
associated with old acquaintances and school workers. A1- 
though my time, day and night, is engaged for every hour I 
ean possibly endure—still it is work—the work of education 
and the association with educators. That is my vacation, is 
my picnic, is my happiness.” : 
The President.—‘ Superintendent Huffaker, I announce to 
you that you have been re-elected Chairman of the Executive 
Committee.”

Superintendent Huffaker.—“As I could not make my speech 
at the proper time, I do not know that I have much to say, but 
Lenter my protest. After serving once as chairman, I feel a 
tendency to draw back from the work, and I do trust that my 
weak arm may be strengthened by the strong arm of this noble, 
faithful, and intelligent body. Ishall endeavor to discharge my 
duty, and [ trust that the next meeting may be better than we 
have ever had before. I thank you very much.”

Report of Committee on Resdlutions was read by Chairman 
Overall, as follows: 
Report or THE ComMirrEs on Resouvutions. 
. Resolved, That we express our appreciation of the hearty wel- 
come so eloquently extended to this meeting of public school 
officers by Gen. H. Il. Norman, as the representative of Gov. 
Buchanan, who so earnestly advocates the great cause of edu- 
cation. i 
2. That we accord the highest praise to the last Legislature 
for its action in the passage of the secondary school law, the 
grandest work of its deliberations. 
3. That we give State Superintendent Garrett our heartiest 
¢o-operation in his earnest effort to put this law into operation. 
4. That State Superintendent Garrett and his efficient clerk, 
Prof. J. 8. Buchanan, have our deepest gratitude for the kind, 
accommodating and hospitable manner in which they have 
looked after our every interest. 
5. That we return our heartiest thanks to Dr. G. W. F. 
Price and all those who contributed to that most charming and 
edifying entertainment given in honor of this convention. 
6. That we extend our thanks for the following invitations: 
From Supt. Weber, to visit the Watkins Night School; from 
President Liuk, to visit the Blind School; from City Superintend- 
ent Brown, to visit the city schools; from President Cravath, to 
visit Fisk University, and from Prof. Kilvington, president of 
the Cole Industrial School. 
7. That we take pleasure in acknowledging the many and 
valuable favors shown us by the city papers, the hotels, and the 
railroads. 
8. That our thanks are herewith tendered that indispensable

9. That we commend the courteous and impartial ruling of 
President Frank M. Smith, and herewith take occasion to bear 
testimony to his past earnest and efficient labors towards the 
advancement of the public schools of Tennessee, labors that 
were so successful as not only to win the approval of this con- 
vention, but the heartiest praise of our entire populace. It is 
with the deepest regret that we give him up as he now severs 
his connection with public school work, and assure him that our 
most heartfelt interest goes with him to his great school work 
at Knoxville.

Committee. 
- President Smith.— Let me state that I have not.severed my 
connection with the public schools of Tennessee. I am in a 
public school—a public free school.” 
Professor Goodman.—“In this connection I would like to 
make an announcement. The proceedings of the State Teachers’ 
Association are here for distribution. Some have been fussing 
at me for not getting them out sooner. As secretary, this 
morning I received by express the proof-sheets of the minutes, 
which were sent to the parties fully two weeks ago for correc- 
tion. Had I waited for their return, the proceedings would not 
now be published. These parties will doubtless blame me for 
not waiting longer, and I shall expect you to stand by me in 
my defense. The State Teachers’ Association is a valuable 
assistant to this organization in procuring legislation, and in 
many other ways. There are a great many opportunities for 
these two organizations to benefit each other. On yesterday 
the Executive Committee of the State Teachers’ Association 
decided to hold the next meeting at Tullahoma, and we want 
that to be the largest and best meeting we have ever had. Su- 
perintendent Huttaker, President of that association, is here, 
and doubtless has some announcements to make in regard to it 
before we adjourn.” : 
Superintendent Huffaker —*I want to ask every County
-P-A-G-E-456
Pusuic Scuoon Orricers’ AssocraTion. “145, 
  
Superintendent to go to work in earnest to, bring a large dele- 
gation to that meeting. We want, if possible, to have the 
largest assemblage in Tullahoma that has ever met on an oc- 
casion of the kind in the State. I mean to work with all my » 
might from this time on till the meeting of the Association. 
We want to have a grand meeting of the teachers of the State.” 
Professor Goodman.— ‘In this connection I wish to make 
my acknowledgments, and return my thanks to my assistant 
secretary, Miss Dora Harper. The full reports we have had in 
the American have been due to her assistance.” 
President Smith.— “In surrendering my official station, and 
turning this gavel over to my successor, I desire to return my 
sincere thanks to the public school officers. for the honors con- 
ferred upon me. For almost twenty years I have filled some 
official position in the State of Tennessee, in connection with 
the public schools. Now I retire as an officer, and I surrender 
this gavel, I know it is going into good hands, chosen by the 
unanimous voice of this Association. To you, Dr. Payne, I say 
—giving you this gavel, and giving with it the authority of the 
Association—may the blessing of God rest and abide on you and 
the organization over which you will preside.” 
President W. H. Payne here took the chair. 
Dr. Payne.— “I suppose it is not necessary for me to again 
express my sincere thanks for the courtesies extended to me by 
this body, but I desire to reply to the hearty reception by the 
retiring president of this body. I love him heartily for his 
great consideration, large heart, and generous impulses. He is 
a man who has devoted himself unreservedly and untiringly to 
the educational interests of this commonwealth, and this com- 
monwealth will never outgrow the impress left upon it by the 
direction of his wise head and great heart. I accept very hum- 
bly this responsibility, and speak the truth when I say that my 
highest ambition is to give you my best service during the com- 
ing year.” 
Superintendent Thomas H. Paine.—“ Mr. President, I have 
been thinking during the past few moments of a little bit of
-P-A-G-E-457
146 Pusiic Scuoot Orricers’ AssocraTIon. 
  
history. In 1875 I,had the honor to occupy the chair you now 
occupy—I think it was the same chair; I know it was in the 
same position—not, however, sir, in the sume capacity that you 
-do. I occupied it as president of the Senate of Tennessee.. I 
want to say to you, sir, that no act of mine during the sitting 
of that body, which was composed of able and distinguished 
men—many of them our best lawyers and citizens—no act of 
mine gave me so much pleasure as that of placing my name 
to the bill that created the institution over which you now pre- 
side, the Peabody Normal College, and I hope and feel sure that 
you will add to this institution, and to this body, a growth and 
development similar to that which you have added to that in- 
stitution to which I have alluded.” [Applause.] 
The President.—“ This Association is now about to adjourn. 
Has the State Superintendent any communication to make be- 
fore the adjournment?” 
Superintendent Garrett.—“<I have no communication to make, 
except to acknowledge, sir, the courtesy of your invitation, and 
to return to this Association my thanks, my cordial thanks, for 
their kind expressions and for the tender of their co-operation. 
I know how little a single officer can accomplish when not sus- 
tained by the active exertions of his associates, and by the sym- 
pathy of the public. I feel how strong is the arm of this body 
of school-offivers representing the educational interests of all 
portious of the State. I accept the offer of co-operation as no 
idle courtesy. J take it to heart, sir. I feel cheered by the hope 
that our joint exertions may uplift the public school system to 
a higher plane of efficiency. 
“But, fellow-members, while I feel grateful for your co-oper- 
ation, let me beg you to go further. Let us also invoke the 
co-operation of all others connected with the system: the mem- 
bers of the County Courts, the District Directors, the County 
Trustees, and, last but not least, the people themselves. 
“What we have done here is an invaluable part of the work, 
yet it is not all. It is but the planning of the campaign. The 
vigorous execution of these plans remains to be performed- 
Let us not falter or forget; let us move forward steadily, firmly,

tirelessly to the performance of our respective duties with 
_ brave hearts and cool heads. Let us correspond with each 
other, communicate with each other, cheer each other. Let us 
feel ‘the touch of the elbow.’ 
“As we perform our respective tasks in this labor of love, 
this up-building of the educational interests of the State, let us 
constantly remember that education, like all other institutions 
of this country, can thrive only when it takes root in the affec- 
tions of the people. Let us bend all our efforts to plant the 
love of education deep in the popular heart. Let us so work 
that when we meet in our next annual session and grasp each 
other’s hands in friendship, we may also grasp them in congrat- 
ulation on the progress of education. 
“Mr. President, I stated that I had no communication to 
make. It now occurs to me that no committee has been ap- 
pointed under the resolution requesting the State Superintend- 
ent to prescribe regulations for the examination and promotion — 
of pupils through the several grades. It was suggested in the 
resolution that a committee of this Association be appointed to 
aid in this work if desired by the State Superintendent. I do 
desire such a committee very much. It will be a difficult task 
to prescribe regulations for the examination and promotion of 
pupils through the several grades of a system of schools vary- 
ing so widely from each other in organization, length of term, 
and other conditions. I shall need the counsel of our wisest 
and most experienced members. I respectfully request the ap- 
pointment of such a committee before the adjournment.” 
President Payne then appointed the following committee to 
_ ¢o-operate with the State Superintendent in preparing a system 
of examinations for promoting pupils through the several grades 
of the public schools: Hon. Leon Trousdale, Hon, Thomas H. 
Paine, Hon. Frank M. Smith, Supt. J. H. Allen, Supt. H. D. 
Huffaker. 
The Association then adjournd.

TENNESSEE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS 
AND COLLEGES. 
The fourth annual session of the College Association of Ten- 
nessee was held at the South-western Presbyterian University, 
beginning Thursday, Noy. 5, at 11 a.m. 
There were present: Chancellor Payne, of the University of 
Nashville; Profs. Baskervill and Kirkland, of the Vanderbilt ; 
Buchanan and Grannis, of the Cumberland; Deaderick and 
Massie, of the South-western Presbyterian, and Capt. Garrett, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The preparatory 
schools were represented by Profs. Wallace, Mooney, and 
Webb. 
The meeting was organized by the calling of Chancellor Payne 
to the chair. Prot. Nicolassen was elected Secretary. 
The minutes of the last meeting were read, as a basis for the 
work of the present session. 
The discussion of English was taken up and carried on in a 
very instructive manner by quite a number of members. Be- 
fore this was concluded, the Association adjourned to meet 
again at 7:30 p.m. At the appointed hour the discussion was 
resumed. 
A committee, consisting of Profs. Baskervill, Wallace, and 
Bourland, was appointed to co-operate with Capt. Garrett in 
preparing an outline of English study in publie schools for pub- 
lication in his next report. 
A report was then read from Prof. Smith, secretary of the 
Executive Committee. Upon his recommendation the follow- 
ing resolutions were adopted : g 
First.—That preparatory schools as well as colleges, be con-
-P-A-G-E-463

sidered members of the Association, whose name shall be 
changed to the Tennessee Association of Schools and Col- 
leges. The institutions now recognized as members are Knox- 
ville, Vanderbilt, University of Nashville, Sewanee, Cumber- 
berland, South-western Presbyterian, Montgomery Pe Wal- 
lace’s, Wall & Mooney’s, and Webb’s. 
Second.—That the following offices be established: President 
(elected for one year), Secretary (for five years), and Executive 
Committee, consisting of the President, Secretary, and three 
otHers, to be chosen annually. 
A committee of three was chosen—Profs. Kirkland, Mooney, 
and Massie—to make nominations for these offices. This com- 
mittee reported, nominating Dr. Paine as President, Prof. C. 
F. Smith as Secretary, and Profs. Nicolassen, Wiggins, and 
John Webb as the other members of the Executive Committee. 
‘The report was adopted. 
The subject of the A. B. degree was called up, but no lengthy 
discussion was had, in view of the fact that there is such a 
variety of opinion on the subject. 
A committee, consisting of Profs. Kirkland, Payne, and 
Nicolassen, was appointed to prepare subjects and select leaders 
for the next meeting. This committee reported as follows: 
First.=“The Harmonizing of the Study of the Classical 
Course in Preparatory Work:” Prof. John Webb. 
Second. —‘ Prose Composition in Preparatory Classical 
Work:” Prof. Kirkland. 
Third.“ Place and Amount of Formal Grammar in English 
Study:” Profs. Bourland and Mooney. 
Fourth —* Relations of the Fitting Schools to the Universi- 
ties:” Profs. W. R. Webb and Wallace. 
This report was adopted. 
The final session was held at ten o’clock on Friday morning. 
The University of Nashville was selected as the next place of 
meeting, and the time chosen the first Thursday evening of 
November, 1892.

The Executive Committee was directed to prepare a form of 
organization, to be presented at the next meeting. 
The Superintendent of Public Instruction was recognized 
ex officio as a member of the Association. 
Preparatory work in Latin and Greek was discussed at some 
length. 
The minutes were then read and approved, and ordered to be 
permanently recorded. y 
Before adjournment the following resolution was adopted : 
“That as a body we tender our cordial thanks to our kind 
hosts at Clarksville for their entertainment of our body.” 
The Association is making steady progress, this being the 
most satisfactory session ever held. Itis hoped that by narrow- 
ing the subjects of discussion and appointing a separate leader 
on each topic, still more valuable results may be reached. It 
is probable that steps will be taken to publish the reports that 
shall be presented. 
Report or Commirrex To Frame a Course or Stupy In ENGiisu 
FOR CHILDREN BerweEen THE AGES OF SEVEN 
AND FIFTEEN YEARS. 
The committee appointed by the Association of the Schools 
and Colleges of Tennessee to frame a course of study in 
English for children between the ages of seven and fifteen, 
beg leave to present the following report. In many places 
it is only suggestive, for in all educational matters large dis- 
cretion must needs be left to the teacher, and no teacher in 
the schools ought, by his training and equipment, to be so fully 
prepared to exercise his discretion as the teacher of English. 
In a course of English for children of this age, three ends or 
objects should be kept in view. It should be the teacher’s aim 
tomake the pupils skillful in speech, skillful in composition, 
and fond of reading. As will be seen in the report, special at- 
tention is called to pronunciation and spelling. Slang, vulgari- 
ties, and bad English should also be carefully removed from a 
23 s. p.1.—Ap. E.
-P-A-G-E-465

child’s mouth. . Along with this goes the acquisition of a vo- 
eabulary. With new words come new ideas and expansion of 
mind. For many children the teacher is, in respect to pronun- 
ciation, correctness and purity of speech, and the acquisition of 
a vocabulary, the only guide and almost the only help. 
The study of English grammar is specially recommended. 
While we do not accept the theory that it teaches us to speak 
and to write the English language with propriety and correct- 
ness, we neverthelegs believe this study to be indispensable. Let 
us accept the definition of the distinguished Frenchman, M. 
Ch. Marly-Laveaux: “Grammar directs us to the study of 
words considered with regard to their nature, with regard to 
their form, and with regard to their usage,” and we shall get a 
clearer conception of the purposes and uses of this study. 
First.—W ith regard to their nature. The nature of words is 
a larger and more philosophical way of describing the doctrine 
of the parts of speech. A mechanical teacher will allow a child 
to learn the names, “noun,” “ adjective,” etc., by rote, but the 
true teacher will not. If the parts of speech are learned “by 
the outward semblance rather than by the inward sense,” the 
mind remains unenlightened. The Latin grammar favors this 
inattention, this mechanical and formal recognition. Take the 
little word “the,” for instance. Sometimes it is an article, again 
it is an adjective, and still again it isan adverb. In this, as in 
many other instances, external form helps not at all. The child 
is compelled to think and to reason, and when the doctrine of 
the parts of speech is thoronghly understood, the person, 
whether pupil or teacher, has become largely acquainted with 
the science of thinking. This part of grammar, properly taught, 
is a study in the region of psychology. 
Second.—With regard to their form. Fortunately most in- 
flections have disappeared in English. In the minds of some— 
especially of teachers of Latin and Greek—grammar would 
chiefly signitiy diagrams of declension, conjugation, schemes of 
case, tense, mood, and the like. We would caution teachers to 
avoid this confusion, and to reject all books that, by ecpying 
the classical grammars, give such false notions in the teaching 
of English. For instance, one grammar will increase the num-
-P-A-G-E-466
TENNESSEE AssocraTION oF Scnoots anp CoLtEGus. 155 
  
ber of verb-inflections from six to two-hundred and seventy-two. 
There are inflections enough left to perplex the child’s mind, 
but by using good books the facts of English inflection can be 
so arranged and classified as to make them easy to learn, and 
easy to remember. While historical grammar is not presented 
as a study in this course, yet it is of such importance to a thor- 
ough understanding of the language, that no teacher of English 
should neglect it. Not only the forms, but most of the idioms 
of the language can be explained or satisfactorily accounted for, 
only by the history of the language. Every English teacher 
should know historical English grammar thoroughly. 
Third.—With regard to their usage. This embraces both 
syntax and grammatical analysis. Under the employment. of 
words, or the manner of their usage, will naturally fall every 
combination that is possible, from the shortest phrase to the 
longest paragraph. It will not do, however, to oppress the 
child’s mind with the niceties and subtleties of syntax. To go 
into these would simply bewilder the mind. Avoid, also, so- 
called parsing as much as possible. This belongs chiefly to the 
‘classical languages, and is an excellent exercise where it prop- 
erly belongs. But there are many English sentences, perfectly 
good idiomatic English, too, which cannot be parsed. They 
can be explained, accounted for historically or by usage, but 
they cannot be parsed. Jere comes in the work of logical 
analysis. 
The English language, it has been said, has come to be the 
most purely logical of all forms of human speech. To teach 
the analysis of English sentences aright is to teach the laws of 
human thought and the science of correct thinking. As in 
another place we found the study of grammar entering the 
domain of psychology, so here we tind it entering the domain 
of logic.~ Avoid diagrams and all mechanical appliances that 
deceive the eye and blunt the perceptions. The purpose here 
is to lead the mind on, step by step, from the simpler relations 
of subject and predicate, object, etc., to the fixing of the logical 
force of each connective, subordinate, and co-ordinate, and of 
the relation in thought of sentence to sentence. The memory 
will help, but the relation of word to word, phrase to phrase,
-P-A-G-E-467
156 TennusseE AssocraTION oF ScHooLs AND COLLEGES. 
clause to clause, sentence to sentence, and paragraph to para- 
graph can be determined only by the most careful and pains- 
taking reasoning. No diagram will show these relations. 
In regard to composition we would make one suggestion and 
give one caution. These can be best presented in a couple of 
paragraphs from one of the best teachers of English that 
America has produced: “#rom my own far-off childhood,” 
says. he, “I can well remember the cruelty and the silliness of 
the method then used—the method of so-called original com- 
position! ‘The Cow,’ ‘The French Revolution, ‘The Char- 
acter of George Washington,’ ‘Moonlight,’ ‘ The Steam Engine,’ 
such were the subjects assigned us for a composition to occupy 
a page of that appropriate paper called foolscap. No facts were 
given us, no thought suggested, no method taught. The com- 
positions that we wrote were things so painful to write, things 
so useless, and even so hurtful, when written, as to vex me now 
in recalling them.” 
“Our rule, on the contrary, should be first to give the facts, 
and then to require the form of expression. In practice I have 
found it works well, with my lowest class, to tell them some 
short and pointed story, and to require each child, in his own 
‘way, to write down the story from his memory of the facts. 
Each version will, of course, be different ; and by comparing the 
versions with one another, and with the original, much may be 
learned. Asa higher stage in the same exercise, certain facts, 
as statements of accounts, bills, receipts, etc., may be furnished, 
and the pupils required to state the given facts in correct 
epistolary form. By this means, the practical art of letter- 
writing, with its conventionalities of address, signature, and 
business expression may be easily taught. As the skill of the 
class becomes greater, you may increase the length and diffi- 
culty of the passage to be rendered. Striking scenes from 
history, brilliant passages from fiction, may be read before the 
class; and the effort to reproduce them by memory and in 
writing, will not only greatly strengthen the memory, but will 
lead to some skill in composition, to the discernment of hlunders, 
and to the habitude of correct expression. At a late stage, a 
class thus trained may be set to work at original composition.

With a good rhetoric in hand they may try their skill in deserib- 
ing objects that they have seen, or in narrating events that 
they have experienced. As the last stage, in the form of short 
essays, they may be trained to put arguments together in cor- 
rect and careful exposition. But it is the first law of all sound 
teaching in composition, that the acquisition of facts and the 
formation of thoughts, should always precede the attempt at 
literary expression.” 
But the most important object in the teaching of English is the 
formation of the habit of reading. Our language is abundantly 
rich in the best books for youthful minds, and it is now generally 
admitted by all sound educators that interest can be kept alive 
and a desire to read implanted only by the perusal of many 
books. Hence, we suggest the abandonment of readers after 
the third grade. The objections to the customary series of 
readers are, in our opinion, well founded. The selections are 
brief and fragmentary, and hence incapable of fixing and hold- 
ing the attention. “Robinson Crusoe” and “ Gulliver’s Trav- 
els” will do more to inspire a love for good literature than a 
whole series of readers. We therefore would urge teachers to 
give their pupils the best English classies—tales of travel and 
adventure, biographies of great men, simple poems. All the 
books mentioned in this course can be got in cheap, handy, and 
well printed editions. Several publishing houses—notably, Ginn 
& Co., of Boston—are making a specialty of classics for chil-- 
dren. 
The teacher, we think, should read much with his class. Of 
all the time allowed to English teaching, let him give at least 
one-half to class-reading. Each unfamiliar word should be ex- 
plained, each allusion or reference to nven and events should be 
made plain. Let the meaning of each passage be brought out 
by close questioning or by translating into simple words and 
easier constructions. A child thus taught to read will soon be- 
gin to read good books out of school-hours. As a little girl of 
eight said, after reading “ Grimm’s Fairy Tales,” “It gives me 
such pleasant things to think about.’ The habit of reading, 
when once formed, is apt to remain. One book leads to an- 
other, and among bright, clever students the example is con-
-P-A-G-E-469

tagious. An old teacher once said that characters of students 
are influenced far more by their reading than by their studies. 
«They study what they must, they read what they love.” Ifa 
teacher can influence and control this love, he will in truth be a 
success. : 
FIRST GRADE. 
Spelling.— Words to be spelled orally, by syllable, each 
syllable to be pronounced s+parately, and the word to be pro- 
nounced when finished. Cultivate agreeable tones in this and 
all other exercises. 
Reading should receive much attention. Children of this and 
other low grades should read twice a day in class, Use three 
or more first readers, and review each book twice. Attend to 
pronunciation, emphasis, inflection, modulation, and fluency. 
Before each recitation test the pronuiciation of new and diffi- 
eult words. Encourage pupils to lvarn how to spell each new 
word that they meet in reading. Question on the subject-mat- 
ter of each lesson. Tlave pupils memorize choice poetical se- 
lections. 
Grammar.—No formal study of grammar. Correct mistakes 
as they are made. Explain the use of the principal marks of 
punctuation and of capitals. Composition should be taught 
orally by having a pupil stand and, with book closed, reproduce 
in his own words what he has read. This exercise is of great 
importance. 
SECOND GRADE. 
Spelling.—Oral, as in first grade. More difficult words. 
Reading.—Use several second readers. [lave pupils read be- 
fore the whole school now and then. Question on the subject- 
matter. Memorize poetical selections. Reading develops the 
minds of young children better than any other branch of ele- 
mentary instruction. So read, read, read! The following books 
will be found suitable for use in this grade: Johonnot’s “ Book 
of Cats and Dogs” (American Book Co.); ‘Seaside and Way- 
side,” No. 1 (D. C. Heath & Co.). 
Grammar.—No formal study of grammar. | Continue the in-

struction suggested for the first grade. Pay constant attention 
to oral composition. Have pupils form sentences making state- 
meuts, asking questions, giving commands. These sentences 
should be written and corrected. 
THIRD GRADE. 
Spelling.—As before, oral and written. 
Reading.—Third reader, with supplementary readers. Criti- 
"cise the reading carefully. Read in concert occasionally. Mem- 
orize poetical selections. Always question on the subject-mat- 
ter. The following books are suggested: Scudder’s “ Fables 
and Folk Stories” (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.); Ruskin’s “ King 
of the Golden River” (Ginn & Co.); “Seaside and Wayside,” 
No. 2 (D. C. Heath & Co.); Johonnot’s “ Friends in Feather and 
Fur” (American Book Co.); “Those Dreadful Mouse Boys” 
(Ginn & Co.); “Onr World Reader,” No. 1 (Ginn & Co.); An- 
dersen’s ‘Fairy Tales,” first series (Ginn & Co., Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.). 
Grammar.—Language lesson may be begun. Written and 
oral reproduction of stories read, with correction of mistakes. 
When a composition is required of young pupils, always furnish 
the material for it by telling or reading them a story. When , 
young they cannot be expected to originate. 
FOURTH GRADE. 
Spelling.—Oral and written, as before. 
Reading.—Discard the readers and read books. Memorize 
select passages, giving preference to poetry. ‘‘Andersen’s 
Fairy Tales,” second series (Ginn & Co., Houghton, Mifflin & 
€o.); Kingsley’s ‘‘ Water Babies” (Ginn & Co., Macmillan & 
Co.); Hawthorne’s “Little Daffydowndilly,” ete. (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.); Edgeworth’s ‘“ Waste Not, Want Not” (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co.); ‘‘Seaside and Wayside,” No. 4 (D. C. 
Heath & Co.); “Our World Reader,’ No. 1 (Ginn & Co.); 
“Robinson Crusoe” (Ginn & Co.). 
Grammar.—Language lessons continued. Written and oral 
reproduction in class of stories read. Compositions weekly.
-P-A-G-E-471
160 Tennessee Assocration or ScHoons AND COLLEGES. 
  
A useful exercise is to read aloud a passage that has been pre- 
viously assigned and have the pupils write it exactly as it was 
printed. Spelling, punctuation, and the correct use of words 
can be taught in this way. Letter-writing. 
FIFTH GRADE. 
Spelling.—Oral and written, as before. 
Reading.—Memorize poetical selections. Kingsley’s “Greek 
Heroes” (Ginn & Co., Macmillan & Co.); Hawthorne’s “ Won- 
der Book” (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.); Longfellow’s “ Chil- 
dren’s Hour,” ete. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.); Church’s “Stories 
of the Old World” (Ginn & Co.); Martineau’s “Peasant and 
Prince” (Ginn & Co.); “Arabian Nights” (Ginn & Co.). 
Grammar.—A. text-book should now be used. What is here 
learned should be applied in the reading lessons. Written and 
oral reproductions in class. Compositions. Letter-writing. 
Continue dictation exercises as suggested for the fourth grade. 
SIXTH GRADE.

PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Hon. W. R. Garrett, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
é Nashville, Tenn. : 
The following is a brief report of the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege for the academic year 1890-91: 
ATTENDANCE. 
The whole enrollment for the last year was 422, a net gain of 
63 over the enrollment for the year 1889-90. The number of 
students enrolled from Tennessee during the year 1890-91 was 
216, a net gain of 13 over the enrollment for the preceding 
year. The gradual increase in attendance during the past. four 
years may be seen from the following table: 
             Year. Tennessee Students. Whole Enrol'ment.

During this period the standard for admission has been 
raised from year to year, and each year applicants have been 
rejected who would have been admitted the previous year. 
Attendance at such institutions is subject to fluctuations that 
cannot be foreseen, put if the gradual increase in membership 
shall continue, the time is near at hand when more room must 
be provided or a limit set to the number who will be received. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
While appropriating the same yearly amount for scholarships 
($22,800), the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, one 
year ago, reduced the value of a scholarship from two hundred 
dollars to one hundred dollars and the student’s railroad fare
-P-A-G-E-479
ge 
from his home to Nashville and return. Under this new ap- 
portionment Tennessee would have been entitled to 26 scholar- 
ships; but by special arrangement this number was increased to 
33, one for each senatorial district in the State. Some of these 
districts were already represented by scholarship students, and 
to fill the vacancies in the districts not then represented, com- 
petitive examinations were held in July of last year. From 
the twenty-sixth district there was no applicant, and after 
waiting for two months from the opening of the college year 
for an applicant, the State Board of Education appointed a 
student at large to fill this vacancy for one year. The list of 
scholarship appointees, as it stood on October 1, 1891, is as 
follows:

tion for Tennessee. 
STATE APPROPRIATION. 
The last General Assembly, with practical unanimity, raised 
the annual appropriation by the State from ten thousand to 
fifteen thousand dollars. This larger sum was found to be nec- 
essary in view of the larger outlays required for the running 
expenses of the college. The annual sums now expended by 
the three boards are in round numbers as follows: State Board, 
$15,000; Peabody Board (salaries and scholarships), $35,000 ; 
University Board, $3,600 in salaries and repuirs, and the free 
use of buildings and grounds whose value is not less than 
$150,000. If Tennessee were to maintain a normal school as 
other States maintain them, her annual outlay would be at least 
$30,000. 
CO-OPERATION. 
Under ordinary circumstances the management of a school 
by three boards having independent powers would be anoma- ; 
lous and full of danger; but in the present instance, the spirit 
of co-operation is so hearty and generous that this union in ad- 
ministration is productive only of strength and harmony. Be- 
sides the general satisfaction which all feel in the growth and 
prosperity of an institution whose influence is so beneficent and 
far-reaching, the State Board finds a generous return for its ex- 
penditure in the liberal education of two hundred of Tennessee’s 
most promising youth; the Peabody Board secures the profes- 
sional education of its one hundred and eighty-four scholarship 
x
-P-A-G-E-482
one 
students, who will recruit the teaching profession of the South 
from year to year; and the University Board finds gratification 
in the fact that the life and traditions of this venerable seat of 
learning are maintained, and that the sons of some of its pat- 
rons have the privilege of studying where they received their 
own education. 
PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION. 
Teaching, like law, medicine, and theology, has processes, 
principles, doctrines, and a history peculiarly its own, and these 
must be studied and known before the work of education can 
be undertaken with the promise of high success. Without this 
professional knowledge, teaching becomes mainly an empirical 
art, and remains without the inspiration and direction of the 
best thought of the day. Normal schools are as essential to 
the prosperity, elevation, and safety of communities as medical 
colleges, law schools, and theological seminaries; and they 
should be established in larger numbers, for the teaching pro- 
fession outnumbers any other. It is believed that the course of 
professional instruction in this college is more extensive and 
thorough than in any other institution on this continent. It 
comprises the study of education as an art, a science, and a 
history, and covers a period of five years. The purpose is to 
illustrate the art of teaching by all the lights that can come 
from current practice, from educational science, and from the 
history of educational thought and systems. 
THE MODEL SCHOOL. 
The work done in this school is the necessary complement 
and counterpart of the professional instruction which students 
receive in method, doctrine, and history. This is a school of 
twenty-five children, whose ages range from six to eleven years, 
and is desigued to represent the best current methods of primary 
instruction. It is not a school taught by students in search of 
experience, but by an accomplished teacher who has attained 
proficiency in her art by study and practice. Actual experience 
in teaching cannot come till the student has a school of his own, 
a schvol for which he is personally responsible, and one whieh
-P-A-G-E-483
a 
taxes his learning and skill for terms and years. The only safe 
substitute for this real experience is the observation and study 
of work done in a good school, and it is this service that the 
Winthrop Model School proposes to render the students of the 
Peabody Normal College. 
EMPLOYMENT. 
In nearly every case those who have been graduated from 
this college tind ready opportunities for employment; and its 
diplomas, especially those conferring the higher degrees, are 
passports to the better places in the teaching service. Appli- 
cations for teachers come to the college from places near and 
remote, and to many of these no favorable response can be re- 
turned. There is a growing demand for teachers who can do a 
superior quality of educational work, and facts prove that a 
professional course of study of sterling quality is a wise invest- 
ment of time and money. $ 
AIM. 
Four distinct aims are kept in mind in the management of 
this school: 1. To create and foster a love for intellectual im- 
‘provement. 2. By precept and example to set before its stu- 
dents an attractive conception of the teacher’s vocation. 3. To 
provide students with a thoroughly good academic training. 4. 
To create a high degree of professional skill by means of an 
extended course of professional instruction. « It is assumed that 
a teacher should know much more than he expects to teach; 
that this knowledge should be of the best quality and of wide 
extent; and that, in addition to accurate scholarship, there 
should be that special or technical knowledge which is needed 
for the practice of a special art. 
THE FUTURE. 
It is the avowed purpose of the Peabody Board of Trust to 
found a college for the professional education of teachers, supe- 
rior to any that now exists on this continent; an institution 
which shall hold the same relation to the teaching profession of
-P-A-G-E-484
ee eae 
the country that the great centers of medical science hold to 
the medical profession of the country; an institution which shall 
maintain the best traditions of the teaching art, which shall culti- 
vate a rational science of human training, and which shall dis- 
seminate whatever is truest and best in method and doctrine. 
It is confidently believed that nothing more than the continued 
co-operation of Tennessee is needed in order to secure to the 
Peabody Normal College whatever endowment is necessary for 
the equipment and maintenance of such an institution. It is 
certain that a school of this character will be founded some- 
where in the. South, and, at present, all probabilities point to 
Nashville as the place of its permanent location. A great 
school of permanent value requires time in which to establish 
its policy, to create wholesome traditions, and to perfect its 
working organization. In each of these lines of growth there 
yet remains very much to be done. Perhaps the most that can 
be safely said is that a fair beginning has been made, and that 
the future is full of promise. Respectfully submitted, 
WittiaM H. Payne, President.

UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Hoy. W. R. Garrerr, Superintendent of Public Instruction of the 
State of Tennessee: 
Srr—In response to your request, I have the honor to sub- 
mit the following report on the condition and progress of the 
University of Tennessee during the year ending December 
20, 1891. 
I desire, in the first place, to thank you most cordially on be- 
half of the University, for your warm interest and kind en- 
couragement in all our efforts, and especially for your zealous 
co-operation in the execution of the law with regard to the ap- 
pointment of students to free scholarships in the Academic De- 
partment of the University. As the University of Tennessee 
forms the cap-stone of our public educational system, as at 
present organized, it is proper that the State Superintendent 
should be, ex officio, a member of its Board of Trustees. The 
Act of our last Legislature which made him a member of the 
boards of our State institutions was not needed in the case of 
the University, as the State Superintendent has been a member 
of this board ever since the institution was 1made the State 
University, and incorporated into the State system of public ‘ 
schools. We hope that as the State system of public schools 
grows stronger, the relations between it and the University will 
grow more intimate. 
ORGANIZATION. 
The organization of the University remains essentially the 
same as reported last year. It is only necessary to mention the 
new schools established, a few additions made to the Faculties, 
and some slight changes in the course of study. :
-P-A-G-E-491
Secs 
The Academic Department is divided into the Collegiate De- 
partment and the University Department. The Collegiate De- 
partment forms the college of agriculture, mechanic arts and 
sciences, and offers six courses of study of four years each, as 
follows: Literary-scientific course, lLatin-scientifie course, 
course in agriculture, course in civil engineering, course in 
mechanical engineering, and course in chemistry and mining 
engineering. In our last report there were seven courses of 
study, but the chemical and mining engineering courses being 
very much alike, were consolidated into one. The University 
Depariment offers courses for the graduate degrees of M.A., 
M.S., and Ph.D., and the professional degrees of C.E., Min.E., 
and Mech.E., with elective courses for special students. The 
growth of this latter department is quite gratifying. Although 
the number matriculated in it is not great, the grade of work 
being done is constantly improving with the numbers. There 
were twenty-seven post-graduate and special students last ses- 
sion, including the professional teachers in attendance here ; and 
during the fall term of the current session three members of the 
last graduating class entered for their advanced degrees. Con- 
nected with this department is a Teachers’ Department, of 
which we will speak in more detail later. 
The professional Departments of Law and Dentistry and 
Medicine remain the same. 
Important steps have been taken during the year to place the: 
Industrial Department of the University for colored students 
upon a much better basis. This will be discussed later. 
ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT. 
The Academic Department comprises fifteen schools, each in 
charge of a professor or associate professor, with one or more 
assistants wherever necessary. With the opening of the fall 
term this year the instruction was regularly begun in five new 
schools, the increased work at the University having made it 
necessary to divide a number of schools already in existence. 
The work hitherto done in the two Schools of Ancient Lan- 
guages and Literature, and of English, Modern Languages and
-P-A-G-E-492

Literature, respectively, was distributed into one School of 
Latin Language and Literature; one of English and German, 
and one of Greek and French. At the same time a separate 
School of History, Philosophy, and Pedagogics was created. 
The School of Pure Mathematics was separated from that of 
Civil Engineering, and the School of Mechanic Arts was sepa- 
rated from that of Mechanical Engineering. A School of 
Physics was also established, but owing to the delay in the 
completion of the building containing its laboratory, the elec- 
tion of a professor of physics was postponed for one year. In 
the meantime the work in the School of Physics has been 
divided out between three other professors. It is expected that 
this professorship will be filled in the spring or summer of 1892, 
and that work in the new laboratory, now rapidly approaching 
completion, will begin in the fall term of the session of 1892-93. 
The schools of instruction in this department are now arranged, 
and the professors and instructors are distributed as follows: 
1. School of Latin Language and Literature, with one pro- 
fessor and one instructor. 
2. School of English and German, with one professor and one 
instructor. 
3. School of Greek and French, with one associate professor. 
4, School of History, Philosophy, and Pedagogies, with one 
associate professor. 
5. School of Pure Mathematics, with one associate professor 
and one instructor. 
6. School of Civil Engineering, with one professor. 
7. School of Physics. 
8. School of Mechanical Engineering and Draughting, with 
one professor. 
9. School of Mechanic Arts,. with one professor, one in- 
structor, and one foreman. 
10. School of General and Analytical Coe enys with one 
professor and one instructor. 
11. School of Organic and Agricultural Chemistry, with one 
professor.

The work in the Teachers’ Department is done in these same 
schools. This department has a separate principal, who gives 
instruction during the spring term of each year in the theory 
and practice of teaching, the organization and management of 
schools, courses of study, grading schools, supervision, ete., with 
practical instruction in the methods of teaching the common 
school branches.

STATE SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The State has established 275 scholarships in the Collegiate 
Department of the University, which secure the appointees 
free tuition. It seems necessary to repeat again the method of 
appointment to these scholarships. This is, briefly, as follows 
(see the Code, Sections 327 to 329): 
The State Superintendent issues notices to the County and 
City Superintendents in the month of May of each year, re- 
quiring them to hold examinations of candidates for appoint- 
ments in their respective counties or cities, and giving directions 
as to these examinations. 
The County and City Superintendents are required to give 
public notice and to hold such examinations as may be necessary 
during the month of June. From the list of candidates found 
qualified and numbered in the order of merit, each State Sen- 
25 s. P.1.—Ap. F,
-P-A-G-E-497
} 
OA 
ator and Representative can appoint two young men to scholar- 
ships in the University. State Senators and Representatives 
can appoint other persons not on this list, but in doing so they 
take the responsibility for their preparation. The students thus 
appointed must be at least fifteen years of age, aud prepared to 
enter the regular collegiate classes. Senators and Representa- 
tives are requested to make their appointments subject to these 
competitive examinations of applicants by the County or City 
Superintendents of public schools. 
In order that no worthy young men who pass these examina- 
tions may fail to get the advantages of the University, the pres- 
ident of the University is authorized by law to appoint such 
qualified candidates to any vacancies which may remain to be 
filled in any county or district on the tenth of August of each 
year. Candidates for these scholarships should address the 
president of the University, giving the county, age, aud quali- 
fications, or see their County Superintendents. 
We think it is no fault of the State Superintendent or the 
County Superintendents that this method does not accomplish 
all that it was intended toaccomplish. The State Superintend- 
ent had prepared and sent out this year printed questions and 
instructions for holding the examinations, and notices were 
published in many of the State and county papers, calling at- ~ 
tention to them. The examinations appear to have been held 
regularly in at least a majority of the counties, but after all the 
efforts put forth, only about twenty-five of the Superintendents 
recommended any applicants for scholarships. Twenty-five Su- 
perintendeuts examined and recommended fifty-two men. A 
number of the Superintendents reported that the examinations 
were advertised, but that no candidates appeared. A large — 
number did not report at all. Scholarships were issued, either 
by Representatives and Senators or by the president of the 
University, to all the young men recommended. <A larger 
number appeared at the University at the opening of the session 
to stand the examination there. As the president is authorized 
by law to issue scholarships to all who apply for them after the 
tenth day of August and show themselves to be properly qual-
-P-A-G-E-498
  S08 
ified, scholarships were issued by him to nearly one hundred 
new students in addition to the above. Altogether, through 
the efforts of the County Superintendents, Representatives, 
Senators, and the president of the University, appointments 
were issued to the full number of 275. Some of those who 
sought and obtained scholarships in different ways have not yet 
appeared at the University. It is possible that they will do so 
at the opening of the second term in February. A considera- 
ble number who reported for examination at the University 
were/fuund deficient. 
It appears from this that the majority of students desiring to 
enter the University prefer to put off the examination until they 
come to the University at the opening of the session, and take 
their chances for a scholarship. It is possible that if the 
scholarships were harder to get, as they certainly will be after 
this year, more young men would attend the County Superin- 
tendents’ examinations. On the whole, however, experience 
seems to teach that this complicated system of County Superin- 
tendents’ examinations might just as well be done away with. 
All applicants could then be examined either at the University, 
or at different points through the State, when all could have an 
equal chance. It appears clearly that applicants prefer this 
plan, and that the results obtained under the old system do not 
justify the trouble it gives the County Superintendents. 
: ‘ 
This suggestion is submitted at this time for your considera- 
tion. We think that if we do not have better success next year 
than we had last, we ought to ask the next General Assembly 
to modify the method in some way. The scholarships might 
still be distributed as they are at present, i. e., according to the 
number of Representatives and Senators from the different 
counties. 
HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The system of high school scholarships which was established 
in 1889 promises to work well. Eleven private high schools 
and nineteen public high schools were listed, in accordance with 
the rules then adopted. Each of these schools, whether in
-P-A-G-E-499
                                                                                      
  
  
  
          
          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Y, M, ©, A, BUILDING,

Tennessee or outside, are permitted to recommend students for 
admission, and are allowed to appoint one of their graduates or 
proficients to a free scholarship, good for four years, or until 
graduation. These thirty schools recommended the past year 
seventeen students for admission and scholarships, and they all 
proved well prepared, and are making good progress. When 
this sysem is better understood and appreciated, as it will be 
hereafter, we believe it will bring us a large number of well- 
prepared students. 
APPRENTICESHIPS. 
The apprenticeships are all eagerly sought for, and have 
proved a great assistance to worthy young men of limited 
means. There are twelve of them, which enable their holders 
to earn about $100 a year. They are distributed among the 
different departments of the University. 
FELLOWSHIPS AND INSTRUCTORSHIPS. 
The four fellowships established last year and the four in- 
structorships which existed before, have also answered a good 
purpose. They give assistance to post-graduate and advanced 
students, who will improve the opportunities thus offered. One 
of the fellowships is held by a graduate of the University of 
1890, and the three others by graduates of 1891. They have all - 
entered upon post-graduate courses of study, and which they 
are pursuing with zeal and success. The instructorships are 
worth from $600 to $900 a year, and the fellowships $200 per 
year. 
YOM. a0. As 
The Young Men’s Christian Association building and gymna- 
sium has proved of great comfort and profit to the students. 
It is managed by the association of the University. They 
maintain a reading-room and a regular course of lectures in 
addition to the usual social and physical advantages. The 
building contains parlors, offices, a large assembly-room, bath-— 
rooms, a gymnasium, game-room, and room for a bowling-alley. 
It is equipped with the best furniture and apparatus. Sys- 
tematic instruction in physical culture is given by a graduate of 
Princeton College, who holds a certificate from its excellent

physical department. The students are organized in two classes, 
and each one is instructed three timesa week. The gymnasium 
is open every afternoon for voluntary exercise and practice. 
Athletics at the University are under the direction of the Stu- 
dents’ Athletic Association and the supervision of a committee 
of the Faculty. Great interest is taken in base-ball, foot-ball, 
and other field sports, for which ample space and facilities are 
provided. 
; SCIENCE HALL. 
The new Science Hall building is almost completed, and will 
certainly be occupied during the second term of the current 
session. It contains a large public hall, President’s offices, 
laboratories for chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and geology, 
and the drawing-rooms and lecture-rooms of the Department 
of Engineering. 
PUBLIC LECTURES. 
A course of twenty-two public lectures on literary and scien- 
tific subjects have been announced for the winter and spring of 
1892. The State Superintendent and the president of the Pea- 
body Normal College have both consented to give lectures in 
this course. Hach of these distinguished gentlemen will also 
spend a week at the University during the spring term for the 
purpose of lecturing before the Teachers’ Department. 
ATTENDANCE ON THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT. 
It is impossible to give at this date any intelligent statement 
with regard to the attendance during the current session, as it 
is now only three months under,way. The attendance on the 
Academic Department during the session ending June 18, 1891,

DEGREES AND HONORS. 
At the Commencement in June, 1891, the following degrees 
were conferred: The degree of Bachelor of Science upon 
Messrs. Nicholas Ford Brent, of Kentucky; James Dickason 
Hoskins, of Tennessee; Oscar Jones, of Tennessee; Charles 
Chilton Moore, Jr., of Kentucky; William Napoleon Price, of 
Tennessee; and Edwin Montgomery Wiley, of Tennessee. The 
degree of Bachelor of Arts upon Messrs. Franklin Casper, of 
Michigan; Wallace Clift, of Tennessee; and Frank Beckam 
Powers, of Kentucky. ’ 
Faculty scholarships, awarded for highest stand in class, were 
given to the following: Freshman class—L. HE. Holmes, of 
North Carolina. Sophomore class—C. A. Moore, of Tennes- 
see. Junior class—S. T. Neely, of Kentucky. 
Fellowships were conferred upon Edmund MeMillan Davis, 
B.A., 1890, candidate for degree of M.A.; James Dickason 
Hoskins, B.S., 1891, candidate for degree of M.S.; Charles 
Chilton Moore, Jr., B.S., 1891, candidate for degree of Min. E. ; 
William N, Price, B.S., 1891, in agricultural course, candidate 
for degree of M.S. , 
The Allen Prize Medal in Mathematics was awarded to Al- 
fred N. Treece, of Tennessee. 
LIBRARY. 
As much progress has been made in the library as was possi- 
ble under the present conditions. For want of a better build- 
ing the library has been crowded into two small rooms, which 
are wholly unsuited to its uses. As soon as the new buildings 
are completed it is proposed to provide better accommodations 
for the library. We ought to have a separate fire-proof build- 
ing for the library, reading-rooms, seminary-rooms, and offices.
-P-A-G-E-504
Mer uns 
In spite of the cramped quarters, however, many valuable addi- 
tions have been made during the year, and the arrangement of 
the books has been considerably improved. The students take 
a greater interest in the library and reading-room than they 
have ever done before. The reading-room is supplied with the 
best current literature, and also with the leading scientific, tech- 
nical, and professional journals pertaining to the different depart- 
ments of work carried on in the University. It is regularly 
used by the students and the faculty. 
The extensive improvements made in old South College dur- 
ing the past vacation have given the schools of languages and 
pure mathematics fine lecture-rooms, with individual lecture- 
room chairs, with tablet arms for writing, the best blackboards 
for tale, ete. This has increased the interest in, and success of, 
the work in the schools of Latin, Greek, Modern Languages, 
Mathematics, ete., very much. 
The statements that follow with regard to the different schools 
are condensed from the reports of the professors in charge. 
The attendance upon them is that forthe week of December 20. 
I. SCHOOL OF LATIN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. 
This school is in charge of the dean of the college, Prof. 'T. 
W. Jordon, with Instructor P. L. Cobb as an assistant. The 
Freshman class is taught in two sections; the Sophomore, 
Junior, and Senior classes in one section each. The Freshman 
class meet their instructor five hours per week; the Sophomore 
three hours per week; the Junior five hours per week; and the 
Senior three hours per week, throughout the year. There are 
seventy-five students in attendance upon this school; forty-one 
Freshmen, twelve Sophomores, fifteen Juniors, and seven Sen- 
iors. These students have made very satisfactory progress dur- 
ing the year. Their professor reports that there is not a single 
indifferent or idle man in the school, and that a large majority 
are earnest and successful. A great improvement has, therefore, 
been made in the character of work done and the standard of 
requirement for promotion and graduation. Several students 
are taking post-graduate work in Latin.

ERO) 
If. SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN. 
At the close of the last session the former chair of English, 
“ Modern Languages and Literature was divided so as to transfer 
French to one chair and history to another. Dr. OC. W. Kent 
has charge of the school. This chair recognizes at present only 
English and modern high German, but the experience of a few 
months fully confirms the wisdom of the changes made. The 
work in the school is now much more satisfactory to the pro- 
fessor and to the students than it was under the old organization. 
1. English.—Under the new arrangement, the work of the 
classes will be as follows: 
The Freshman class study rhetoric and composition under In- 
structor Davis. The Sophomore class give their attention to 
English literature the first term, and English literature in 
America and the history of the English language during the 
second term. The Junior class study the principles of written 
discourse, versification, and poetry for about two-thirds of the 
session, A brief introduction to English philology occupies 
the remainder of their time. The Senior class in English study 
the leading representatives of English prose during the first 
term, and drama, with some representatives of Elizabethan 
drama during the second term. ‘Iwo advanced students are 
pursuing special work in literature and style, and are tracing 
the development of literary thought and expression in America. 
In all of these classes the outside reading has been more gen- 
eral and greater in quantity than ever before, and, in all, the 
es-ay writing has been of a higher general average. ‘he recent 
additions to the library have greatly aided this. work. t 
2. German.—Instruction is given in German for two years in 
the college course. The beginning class has made fair progress 
this session, while the second year class is accomplishing more 
than it has ever done before. Several of its members are doing 
work outside of that regularly assigned, and several expect to 
continue work in German another year at least. 
Owing to the division of labor mentioned above, the nature 
of the work in this school is better, and the standard higher,
-P-A-G-E-506
         9a 
than heretofore. The way is now clear for still further im- 
provement. 
Ill. SCHOOL OF GREEK AND FRENCH. 
This school was established at the opening of the current 
session. 
1. Greek.——In view of the fact that Greek has been entirely 
elective in the courses of study for some years, and that we had 
noseparate professor for it, the establishment of this school was 
somewhat experimental. Some difficulties and discouragements 
were to be expected. The demand tor Greek heretofore had 
been very slight, and the organization, therefore, of three classes 
with a total enrollment of twenty was entirely satisfactory. 
The manifest interest and steady improvement of every mem- 
ber of these classes gives assurances of permanent success. 
Instruction is given at present from text-books, and, to a 
limited extent, by formal lectures. Besides grounding the stu- 
dents in the forms and syntax of the language and insisting 
- upon accurate oral and written translations of the author read, 
the effort is also kept constantly in view to train him to depend 
upon his own resources; to give such aid and information as 
will excite iftterest and increase the desire for additional knowl- 
edge, and to encourage inquiry into the history, the customs, 
the religion, and the literature of the age in which the author 
under consideration lived. 
The Greek lecture-room was well equipped at the opening of 
the session with the best seats, blackboards, and wall maps. 
The recent accessions to the library will contribute much to 
increase the interest of the students and the efficiency of their 
work, 
2. French.—Provision is made for two classes in French in 
the regular college course. The total enrollment in these two 
classes was thirty-five this session.. The work done by the 
students is, upon the whole, satisfactory. Except in the atten- 
tion paid to pronunciation and conversation, the method of in- 
struction in French is quite similar to that employed in the 
study of Greek.

IV. SCHOOL OF HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND PEDAGOGICS. 
The enrollment in this school during the current session has 
been 102. Of these, fifty-four have studied general history, in 
the Freshman class; twenty-six English, in the Sophomore 
class; nine psychology, in the Junior class; and thirteen polit- 
teal economy, in the Senior class. The Freshmen will study the 
elements of government next term, after completing general 
history. The Sophomore class will complete the history of 
England and then take up special topics in this line. They are 
required to give the results of their investigation in the form 
of addresses and debates, and they thus come to think with 
originality and vigor, and retain, for practical purposes, what 
they learn. The class in psychology have done good work. 
One of the best results of their study is the acquisition of power 
to think on abstruse and difficult subjects. They are aided in 
studying the subjects from every legitimate stand-point, and are 
enabled to embrace all the facts of latest research. 
The work in political economy has been of an equally prac- 
tical character, and the progress of the class commendable. 
There are two post-graduate students in this school, one of 
them working in metaphysics and the history of philosophy, 
and the other doing advanced work in political economy and 
the constitutional history of England and the United States. 
Only one chart has been purchased for the use of the school 
this year. The library affords all of the most needed books of 
reference. 
Vv. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. 
Work in this school has been unusually satisfactory, attribu- 
table, in part, to the handsome new recitation room, with its 
perfect equipments, and to the better preparation of the new 
students. Five separate classes are instructed in this school, 
one of them being divided into two sections. The work is 
done by one professor and one instructor. A total of 130 pupils 
was enrolled in it this session. The Sophomore class in en- 
gineering is the largest in our history, and quite a number | 
entered the class at the opening of the session, being well pre-
-P-A-G-E-508
  Me ng 
pared for it. This class will this year complete trigonometry 
and conic sections, and have two months to devote to calculus. 
The Junior class will finish calculus in the first term, and will 
have the second term for more advanced work in mathematics. 
Both in the Sub-freshman and Freshman classes the work of 
the year is divided between algebra and geometry, the greater 
portion being given to the study of algebra. The attendance 
has been regular, with few exceptions. 
VI. SCHOOL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. 
As we expect to move this school, at an early day, into new 
quarters on the top floor of the Science Hall, only small addi- 
tions have been made to its equipment during this year. It is 
expected, however, that material additions will be made as soon 
as the removal is accomplished. 
Twenty-six students are enrolled in this school, divided be- — 
tween three classes. The Sophomore class studied leveling 
and land-surveying; the Junior class in civil engineering 
_ studied preliminary surveys, soundings, location, and construc- 
tion of railroads; the Junior class in mechanics studied ele- 
mentary mechanics ; the Senior class in civil engineering studied 
the “railroad spiral,” investigations of the changes wrought by 
water in weight, dimensions, strength, ete., of timber, made a 
review of a bridge recently erected in this city, ete.; the Senior 
class in mechanics studied stresses, both graphically and analyt- ° 
ically, in roofs and bridges. The students have done well, al- 
most without exception. 
VII. SCHOOL OF PHYSICS. 
Owing to delay upon the building containing the laboratory 
of physics, this school was not organized at the opening of the 
current session, as was expected. The work in physics, which 
extends through three classes, has been distributed, therefore, 
among the other professors. The new laboratory, with seven 
handsome apartments, is nearly complete at this writing, and 
will be thoroughly equipped before the opening of the next 
session. _

VIII. SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND DRAWING. 
A full set of handsome drawing-tables was secured for this 
school last spring. Owing to the growth of the classes, a room 
in South College was taken and fitted up for instrumental draw- 
ing, while the free-hand drawing was left in the old room in the 
mhechanical building. Large, well-lighted apartments are pro- 
vided for this school in the new Science Hall, and we expect 
that it will be removed thence in the early spring. _Work in 
this school has gone on regularly, in accordance with the an- 
nouncement in the catalogue. All of the classes are larger than 
ever before. 
IX. SCHOOL OF MECHANIC ARTS. 
The manner in which the students have applied themselves 
and have shown improvement in their work in mechanic arts 
during the past yeur, gives us encouragement for its future. 
The number taking the work is considerably larger than it was 
a year ago. 
Since the last report, « considerable number of tools and sev- 
eral new machines for both wood and iron working have been 
received and put in place. Of these the principal ones are two 
engine lathes, milling-machine, shaper, universal grinder, seusi- 
tive drill, and portable forge, all for iron-working, and a wood 
mortising-machine. In addition to these, several hundred dol- 
lars worth of smaller tools and appliances, such as standard 
drills, taps, reamers, and mandrils huve been added to the 
equipment. Every thing added, both machines and tools, comes 
from the very best houses, and nothing of a cheap quality has 
been allowed to go into the building for use. 
The old twenty-five horse-power Straight Line engine has 
been replaced by a forty horse-power engine of the same make, 
and the electric-lighting plant has been improved by replacing 
the one hundred and eight light dynamo by a three hundred 
and sixty light dynamo, and the addition of a switch-board for 
the various circuits leading to the different buildings. One cir- 
cuit, entirely separate from all the others, leads to the Science 
Hall, to be used for carrying a current for experimental worl: 
in physics and chemistry. By the use of the switches either or 
   
-P-A-G-E-510
Sey 
_ both of the two dynamos can be made to operate any or all of 
the cireuits. The dynamos are made by the Edison General 
Company. 
Our next great need is a foundry for iron and brass. This 
would complete the department and put it in condition to dg- 
pend entirely upon itself for complete construction of machin- 
ery. 
Instruction is given in wood-working, with both hand and 
machine tools, pattern-making, forging, tool-dressing and tem- 
pering, iron-working aud complete construction of machines, 
such as lathes, planers, engines, dynamos, and electric motors, 
the machinery made not being mere toys, but such as is placed 
on the market to day. All work, except forging, is done from 
drawings, there being a regular series of exercises which the stu- 
dent must perform before undertaking the expert work which 
completes the course in Mechanic.Arts. Next year drawings 
will also be used in the blacksmith-shop. 
X. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY. 
This school is about to move into its large and commodious 
laboratories in the Science IIall. On the first floor are located 
the metallurgical and assaying laboratories,.preparation and 
dark rooms; on the second floor the qualitative and quantita- 
tive laboratories, balance-room, office, store-room, and private 
laboratory; also an open porch for the generation of acids and 
offensive gases. These laboratories are all very large, well 
lighted, and thoroughly ventilated by stacks eighty feet in 
height. They will be supplied with all the modern conveni- 
ences. The reduction, as well as the cupelling furnaces, will be 
of the newest and best designs. 
Work in this school has gone on in full accordance with 
previous announcements. The classes have grown steadily. 
XI. SCHOOL OF ORGANIC AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 
The course of study in this school remains the same as here- 
tofore. The instruction begins in the junior year with organic
-P-A-G-E-511
eS S ia 
chemistry, followed by agricultural chemistry. It will be 
equally benefited by the removal to the new laboratory. <A 
laboratory course in agricultural chemical analysis is given to 
those who desire to become agricultural. chemists. 
e XII. SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
So much misunderstanding exists with regard to the aims 
and methods of a course of «instruction in agriculture that an 
explanation of the entire course at this institution is given 
here. All the subjects taught in the course are mentioned in 
order to show their relations. 
The course of instruction in the School of Agriculture is 
-both theoretical and practical—theoretical only so far as it 
embraces that sort of purely scientific research which results in 
proven truth, and practical only so far as required for the pur- 
pose of illustration.. It is not intended to teach methods, since 
these may and do vary under varying conditions; but so to 
teach principles that they may be thoroughly comprehended in 
their application to the practical work of the farmer. 
The graduate who has honorably won his degree as a Civil 
or Mechanical Engineer, is not on that account immediately 
trusted with the control of important and expensive operations; 
but it is always and everywhere demanded that such an educa- 
tion must precede active work in these professions. A graduate 
of the agricultural course is not for that reason alone a capable 
farmer, but he is vastly better fitted for his vocation, and can 
enter upon his life-work with the greatest possible certainty of 
success. 
' The farmer must have a broad knowledge of the whole round 
of the natural sciences, and enough of technical skill to be able 
. to work with his own hands, or to intelligently direct others, in 
the many kinds of handicrafts required in the multiplied and: 
diverse operations of husbandry. Nor must he neglect that 
liberal education in general literature, history, and social and 
political economy which will fit him for the duties and respon- 
sibilities of life. To this end, the general plan of the course in
-P-A-G-E-512
  — 39 — i 
agriculture has been carefully considered, so that the student 
shall have, throughout his entire scholastic work, as full and 
liberal opportunities as those who take any other course, 
Academic or University. 
In the Freshman year, algebra and geometry are completed, 
and the studies embrace English, general history, elements of 
government, drawing, elementary physics, physiography, shop- 
work, and military tactics. 
In the Sophomore year, agriculture, chemistry, botany, trig- 
onometry, land-surveying, shop-work, and military tactics, with 
an elective in languages, literature, or history. 
In the Junior year, agriculture, organic and agricultural 
chemistry, botany, physics, physiology, a elementary zoology, 
with an elective in languages, literature, or history. 
In the Senior year, agriculture, horticulture, geology and 
mineralogy, zoology, entomology, political science and ethics, 
philosophy, and an elective in languages or literature. 
Students in agriculture are regularly instructed in the design, 
the methods, and the results of the laboratory and field-work 
of the Experiment Station, and are given opportunity to par- 
ticipate actively in many of its operations. The work of the 
station is both scientitic and technical, seeking by original in- 
vestigations to ascertain facts upon which general principles 
may be founded, and avoiding any attempt to prove or disprove 
particular theories. The advantages of such practical as well 
as scientific illustrations as are afforded by the station are of 
great value—indispensable, in fact—for thorough education i in 
this course. 
GEOLOGY. 
Instruction in geology is temporarily attached to this school. 
Students in the teachers’ course, and such others as desire it, 
study the geology of Tennessee in the spring term. This is a 
course of lectures and recitations, and is intended especially to 
prepare public school teachers to give the instruction required 
in the secondary school course. 
26 s.p.1.—Ap. F.
-P-A-G-E-513
B40 ve 
The Senior class study mineralogy and geology systematically, 
meeting twice a week throughout the entire year, and making 
numerous excursions into the neighboring country. Instruction 
is given by lectures and text-books, and is accompanied by lab- 
oratory work, with exercises in drawing sections, determining 
faults, ete. 
XIII. SCHOOL OF BOTANY AND HORTICULTURE. 
Material additions have been made to the already admirable 
equipment of this school. The herbarium and other collections 
are constantly growing. 
The course begins the second term of the Sophomore year 
with a general study of the structural botany. The determina- 
tion of species of phanerogams from the local flora, and the 
collection and preparation of specimens for the herbarium, are 
taken up. Text-books: Gray’s Lessons, Gray’s Manual of Bot- 
any, Chapman’s Southern Flora. 
Continuing the course in the Junior year, the first term is 
devoted to histological botany or the study of the minute anat- 
omy of plants and of vegetable physiology. This work neces- 
sitates the use of the compound microscope, and instruction in 
handling this instrument and in the use of microscopical re- 
agents is given. During the second half of the Junior year 
systematic botany is studied from types illustrating the chief 
groups of the vegetable kingdom, beginning with the lowest 
forms. Some time is given to the identitication of species of 
thallophytes, and laboratory work in the investigation of the 
fungous diseasés of plants is carried on as time permits. 
Special students and post-graduates are provided with facilities 
for prosecuting advanced work in systematic botany, in the 
study of grasses, vegetable histology, or plant pathology. 
Those in the agricultural course are taught to recognize the 
useful plants, and to distinguish these from plants that are in- 
jurious, and to intelligently care for, in health and disease, the 
various field and garden crops. They receive special instruc-
-P-A-G-E-514
‘ —41— 
tion in grasses, and in the investigation of field and garden 
seeds. 
  The students in mechanical and mining engineering, who so 
desire, are taught how to examine the minute structure of vari- 
ous woods, and investigate the decay of timber arising from the 
attack of fungi. 
During the course special subjects for research are assigned 
to individual students, to be prosecuted under the direction of 
the professor. This will give the student a feeling of responsi- 
bility, and an independence of thought and action that will re- 
quire interest and lead to practical methods of original work. 
The botanical laboratory is equipped with both simple and 
compound microscopes necessary for the work required. 
HORTICULTURE. 
Horticulture is required in the agricultural course in the 
senior year. Itis one of the branches of applied botany, and 
the previous work in the course forms a basis for and greatly 
facilitates an intelligent understanding of this subject. Graft- 
ing, budding, layering, and other methods of propagation, and 
studies in pollination and hybridizing enter into this course. 
Attention is given to outdoor culture, culture under glass, the 
management of hot-beds, cold-frames, etc., as well as the man- 
agement of vines and fruit trees. ; 
XIV. SCHOOL OF ZOOLOGY. 
All of the required classes in this school have been carried 
on regularly by the instructor in charge. Some of the elective 
courses offered in the announcement were ‘not organized. No 
material additions were made to the laboratory, but the collec- 
tions have been steadily increased. ‘ 
XV. SCHOOL OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS. 
The new professor took charge of this school on the first of 
October, as explained above. Since that time every thing re- 
lating to it has been thoroughly systematized, and instruction 
\
-P-A-G-E-515
ae 4d 
and practice have been made much more effective than hereto- 
fore. At present there are four drills per week of one hour 
each, one hour of recitation in tactics, and, in addition, dress- 
parade and inspection every Friday afternoon. Only members 
of the Sub-freshman, Freshman, and Sophomore classes of the 
regular courses are required to take the military instruction. 
The number of students in the school has averaged one hun- 
dred, however, during the first term. The students are organ- 
ized into two companies and ofticered by competent men. A 
new band was organized, and is receiving constant instruction 
from an experienced teacher of music. This has proved of 
great service to the military school, and is very popular. Ef- 
fort has been made to stimulate and encourage the military 
spirit of the cadets by means of competitive drills, rewards’ in 
the way of medals for the best drilled company, ete. The re- 
sults obtained during the short time that has expired have been 
very gratifying. The new system of tactics recently adopted 
by the regular army has been introduced with great success. 
The equipment of the school is quite complete. The condi- 
tion of the arms and the general bearing of the cadets, especially 
their drill, show a marked improvement. A series of lectures 
on military subjects has been inaugurated, and will be contined 
through the bd eh of the session. 
TEACHERS” DEPARTMENT. 5 
This department was reorganized on Feb. 12, 1891, when the 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, former State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction for Tennessee, took charge of it. Prof. Smith en- 
tered upon his duties upon the expiration of his term of office 
as State Superintendent, on May 1 following, Prof. Karns had 
conducted the work in the department up to that date, assisted 
-by the other members of the faculty. Prof. Smith gave a course 
of lectures, illustrated by practical work, in which the teachers 
themselves were organized into classes and put through the 
requisite drills in arithmetic and book-keeping, and English 
composition and rhetoric. THe also gave a course of lectures on 
the theory and practice of teaching, courses of study in public — 
schools, methods of grading schools, and general school-man-
-P-A-G-E-516
Sag ae 
agement. All the classes called for in the announcement were 
organized. 
Instruction in all the classes was given with special reference 
to the methods of teaching these subjects. At the same time 
the students were given a thorough review in them. No effort 
was made to give “short cuts,’ but the young men were im- 
pressed from the start with the importance of being liberally 
educated. To know the subjects required to be taught in the 
public school is not sufficient for the true teacher, but he should 
master all the cognate subjects as well. The man who teaches 
little children should, in all cases, be a broadly educated and 
thoroughly cultivated gentleman. To turn out such teachers 
will always be the object of this department. 
The class, under the guidance of the principal, made frequent 
visits to the schools of Knoxyille, where they gained a practical 
knowledge of the workings of a first-class system of graded 
city schools. Essays were required of each member of the 
class, giving a full account of each grade inspected, the charae- 
ter of the work in detail, the management of the individual 
school, and the supervision of the entire system, with his criti- 
cisms, if any were to be made, upon all he saw. These essays 
were then read in the class and discussed by the students. 
These inspections proved most valuable, both in stimulating 
the young men to careful study and in giving ‘them, in large 
measure, the practical details of school-work. Although it was 
the first term’s work under the new principal, and a very short 
one, the results were very encouraging. Sixteen teachers were 
enrolled in this first class, and they all did faithful work. Those 
who sought employment this fall, found it readily at a better 
salary than they had ever secured before, and affirm that they 
have enjoyed teaching, and had greater success in it than hith- 
erto, which they attribute to the impetus received from the 
term’s work. Nearly all who attended last term expect to re- 
turn at the beginning of the next for the completion of the 
course. The only exception we have heard of is that of a 
teacher who was placed at the head of a graded school for ten 
months at a salary double that he had previously received. He 
intends to return at some future time.
-P-A-G-E-517
as 44 ~ 
This is only a beginning, and we believe it will not be long 
before the influence of this department will be felt throughout 
the entire State. When the people of the State are once fully 
awakened to the importance of employing none but the best 
teachers, none but those who have been regularly taught to 
teach, then will we have liberal appropriations for the educa- 
tion of teachers. The demand for better teachers is growing 
steadily year by year, aud .the Act passed by the last General 
Assembly, giving the people the right to establish secondary 
schools in all the counties of the State, has done much to stim- 
ulate the teachers to seek better preparation. 
This department is now fully prepared to train young men to 
successfully meet this demand. The course of study has been 
further systematized, additional teachers have been employed to 
earry out efficiently every course now offered, and every ar- 
rangement is complete for beginning the next term’s work on 
the fourth of February next. 
In conclusion, we believe that the results of our first term’s 
work show that this department is needed and has a great work 
to do in this State. We ask the co-operation and assistance of 
every school-officer in the State in making it useful and suc- 
cessful. 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
This is a department of the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of the University of Tennessee, and is designed to con- 
duct research in the science connected with agriculture, while 
the college gives instruction in the same subjects. The follow- 
ing compose the working staff of the station. 
F. Lamson-Scribner, Director and Botanist. 
Chas. F. Vanderford, Assistant Director. 
Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., Chemist. 
J. Bolton McBryde, Assistant Chemist. 
Paul F. Kefauver, Agriculturist. 
R. L. Watts, Horticulturist. 
E. E. Morris, Librarian and Clerk to Director.
-P-A-G-E-518
‘; — 45 — 
The work of the station is divided into: 
\ 1. Division of Chemistry, in charge of the Chemist. — ‘ 
2. Division of Botany and Horticulture, in charge of the 
Director. 
3. Division of Field and Feeding Experiments, in charge of 
the Professor of Agriculture in the college. 
The Experiment Station has entire charge and direction of 
the experimental farm, the green-house, and, the horticultural 
grounds. It has its own laboratories and equipment for each 
of the divisions in a separate building on the University grounds. 
The lines of work now occupying the attention of the station 
staff are: 
Special chemical analyses; methods of analyses; systematic 
and economic botany; mycology and the investigation of the 
fungous diseases of plants; geology, physics, and chemistry of 
soils; tillage; fertilizer analysis, with or without control; com- 
position of manures and the cultivation of crops; tests of 
varieties of orchard and small fruits, and of vegetables; tests 
of seeds; analysis of feeding stuffs; silos and ensilage; tests of 
feeding animals for milk; chemistry of milk and its products; 
creaming of milk; drainage. 
The bulletins issued during 1891 are: 
No. 1. “Crab-grass Hay,” “Sorghum as a Forage Plant,” 
“Test of Feed Value of First and Second Crop of Clover,” 
“Pasture Grasses,” “Black Knot of the Plum and Cherry,” 
“Pruning Fruit Trees,’ “The Glassy-winged Soldier-bug,” 
“Diseases of Live-stock,”’ Experiment Station Record. 
No. 2. “The Pea-nut Crop of Tennessee,” by L. P. Brown, 
formerly acting chemist. This bulletin presents a thorough 
discussion of this crop, the territory where grown, the soils, and 
the amount and value of the crop, with a description of the 
plant, its varieties, method of cultivation, harvesting, and a 
complete chemical analysis of all its parts. 
No. 3. “The True Bugs, or Heteroptera, of Tennessee,” by
-P-A-G-E-519
io Mane AG eo.

H. E. Summers, former entomologist of the Station. In this 
bulletin are given keys and descriptions of our true bugs, en- 
*abling one to identify the majority of the species of this group 
which are of economic importance or likely to attract attention. 
The bulletin closes with a brief chapter on remedies. 
No. 4. “Some Fungous Diseases of the Grape,” by F. 
Lamson -Scribner. The principal fungous pests which are 
destructive to the grape in this State are described and figured. 
Formulas for the preparation of materials for combating these 
fungi, and exact method of treatment, are given. 
No. 5. “A Chemical Study of the Cotton-plant,’ by J. 
Bolton McBryde, assistant chemist. This contains chemical 
analyses of the different parts of the cotton-plant, determina- 
tions of the proportion of each of these parts, calculations of 
the fertilizing constituents contained in the average crop, 
analyses of cotton-seed and its products, and a discussion of the 
proper fertilizers for cotton, and the feeding value of the various 
parts of the plants. 
LAW DEPARTMENT. 
The University suffered a great loss in the death of the dis- 
tinguished jurist and late Dean of the Law Department, Judge 
Thomas J. Freeman, ex-Justice of the Supreme Court of Ten- 
nessee. Judge Heseiien was elected to the newly-created posi- 
tion of Dean of the Law Departnient of this University in De- 
cember, 1889, and began the active duties of his office in Jan- 
uary following. His name and fame attracted to the new 
school a number of young men, and his counsel and example 
stimulated them in the ker study of the law. It was his 
supreme desire that this law school should remain as a monu- 
ment of his life-work, and he regretted sincerely that he was un- 
able to witness the graduation of even its first class. Afterayear 
of faithful labor and courageous struggle against disease, he was 
compelled to succumb to the inevitable, and in January, 1891, 
to give up his work, which he had just commenced the year be- 
tore; to lay down his books, turn away from the paths of labor, 
and go among his kindred to rest for awhile, and then to die. 
Thomas J. Freeman was a Terinessean, native, and to the
-P-A-G-E-520
Ege 
manner born, true to his State, devoted to her welfare, jealous 
of her honor, and enthusiastic in her service. Born in Gibson 
County in 1826, after a long and busy life, spent almost exclu-— 
sively within the borders of his native State, he died at the resi- 
dence of his son, Thomas J. Freeman, Jr., in Dallas, Texas, on 
September 16, 1891. 
Reared upon the farm, under wholesome domestic influences, 
he possessed those sterling traits of character and habits of life, 
that independence of thought and sturdy self-reliance, charac- 
teristic of the Southern planter of the old days. Ambitious of 
learning and public life, he studied law, came to the bar at 
twenty-three of years age, and in twelve years had won a fore- 
most place among the lawyers of his circuit. He“won dis- 
tinction as a colonel of a Tennessee regiment ‘in the cam- 
paign of the West, and at the close of the war returned with 
ardor to the precincts of the law. The political revolution of 
1870 found him at the bar of Brownsville, whence he was chosen 
to a place upon the supreme bench of Tennessee. In 1878 he 
was re-elected for a second period of, eight years; thus for six- 
teen years he gave his earnest effort, zealous toil, brilliant 
talents, and love of justice toward establishing and main- 
taining the jurisprudence of his native State. Judge Freeman 
was independent, upright, conscientious, and patriotic in all his 
public acts. He was earnest, liberal, and scholarly in all his 
personal relations. He did his work at the University as ably 
as he had done all the rest. 
Judge Freeman’s place was filled by the election of Henry 
H. Ingersoll, Esq., of Knoxville, Tenn., to be Dean of the Law 
Department, and George EK. Beers, Hsq., also of Knoxville, 
Tenn., to be Professor of Law. Prof. Ingersoll had entire 
charge of the classes during the first term of the session 1890-91, 
and Prof. Beers assisted him during the first term of the session 
1891-92. The Law Department is moving forward with great 
success under their instruction. 
_ This department is organized and conducted with a view to 
give to all its students a thorough acquaintance with the gen- 
eral principles and rules of American law, so as to fit them for
-P-A-G-E-521
a Ag 
the bar of any State. Theoretical and practical methods of 
instruction are combined in the course so as not only to make 
it of advantage to college graduates wishing to prepare them- 
selves for admission to the bar, but also to afford the advantages 
of methodical study to non-graduates, and add to the qnalifica- 
tions and attainments of those young men, already licensed, 
who wish to improve themselves by a course of systematic 
training in their chosen profession. 
The advantages offered in the law course of the University 
to all these classes are unusual, and probably not excelled by 
any of the younger law schools of the country. 
Students seeking admission to this department are not re- 
quired to undergo any preliminary examination. They must, 
however, be nineteen years of age, and of good moral character; 
and it is important that they have, before entering, a good En- 
glish education, and useful to have previously read some standard 
history of England and “ Blackstone’s Commentaries. ” 
The course of instruction in this department is arranged for 
two sessions, and it will be best for all who can to give to it two 
years of time. Those, however, of sufficient age, who have 
prepared themselves by previous study, either general or legal, 
may be able, by earnest application and sole attention to the 
law, to accomplish the course in one year. 
The degree of Bachelor of Laws will be conferred by the 
Board of Trustees, at their annual meeting at thé close of each 
session in June, upon such students as shall have attended the 
prescribed course here for one full session, and shall have satis- 
factorily passed the examination on the whole course. 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 
The Industrial Department of the University of Tennessee, 
for the instruction of colored students, has been placed upon a 
much better basis since our last report. This department is 
located about a mile from the University, at Knoxville, Tenn., 
in immediate connection with Knoxville College, an excellent 
institution for the education of colored people.
-P-A-G-E-522
SE aes. 
The statutes of the State of Tennessee (see the Code, Article 
TViSe The Agricultural College,” Section 339) direct “that no 
citizen of this State, otherwise qualified, shall be excluded from 
the privileges of the University by reason of his race or color; 
but the accommodation of persons of color shall be separate 
from the white.” The Board of Trustees of the University 
have for many years met the requirements of this clause by pro- 
viding similar instruction, modified to suit the requirements of 
the students of this race, in a separate department. 
In order to make better provision for the instruction of the 
State students there, in the sciences pertaining to agriculture 
and the mechanic arts, a special scientific and shop building was 
erected this year, and it is now being furnished and equipped. 
It contains shops for work in wood and iron, drawing-rooms, 
and laboratories for work in chemistry and agriculture. It will 
be equipped with a boiler and engine, and the necessary ma- 
ehinery and tools. The laboratories will have a good outfit of 
apparatus. A tract of land immediately adjacent to the build- 
ing is provided for work in agriculture and horticulture. Two 
additional instructors were employed during the year, with 
special reference for this department. One instructor teaches 
the classes in physics, drawing, and mechanic arts, and the 
other has charge of the classes in chemistry, botany, and agri- 
culture. 
A contract has been made with the Trustees of Knoxville 
College under which the State students get their general lit- 
erary instruction in that institution, but this Industrial Depart- 
ment and their whole course of study are under the supervision 
and direction of the Board of Trustees of the University, who 
elect all of its teachers and pay all of its expenses. Three 
thousand dollars was appropriated by our board to equip the 
new shops and laboratories, and it is expected that the depart- 
ment will be maintained at an expense of from four to five 
thousand dollars per annum. A large portion of this for sev- 
eral years to come must go into equipment. 
Sixteen State appointees were in attendance upon the depart- 
ment last session, but a lurge proportion of the other students
-P-A-G-E-523
ea 250 
of Knoxville College get considerable benefit from it. Free 
scholarships in this department are obtained upon exactly the 
same conditions as in the other department of the Agricultural 
and Mechanical College. 
In order to, further encourage these people in securing an in- 
dustrial education, our board has established a number of ap-_ 
prenticeships in the department, which enable worthy men to” 
earn from thirty to fifty dollars per annum whilst in attendance 
there. They are given work in the shops and on the farm of 
the department, the service rendered being paid for at its mar- 
ket value. We believe that the facilities for the education of 
colored men have been thus made fully equal to their require- 
ments. J i

  INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
Among the noble charities maintained by the State of Ten- 
nessee for her unfortunate children is the Institution for the 
Deaf and Dumb at Knoxville, known as the Tennessee Deaf 
and Dumb School, which was established by the Legislature of 
the State in the year 1844, the beginning of the work being 
made in rented premises in the early part of 1845. 
The Tennessee institution was the eighth of the kind estab- 
lished in the United States, the first having been the American 
Asylum, at Hartford, Conn., which was organized in the year 
1817. In the year 1846 the present location, then west of the 
town of Knoxville, but now near the center of the city, was 
secured and the erection of a commodious and handsome build- 
ing was immediately.begun by the State. This structure still 
constitutes the main building of the institution, though more 
modern additions have been made from time to time to provide 
room for the growing demands upon the school. Additional 
land has also been added to the original tract until the present 
grounds consist of about eight acres, comprising play-grounds, 
shaded lawns, flower-gardens, etc., which are well kept and 
afford a pleasant and attractive home for the pupils. The situ- 
ation is all that could be desired for beauty, healthfulness, and 
convenience of management. 
The necessity for such institutions in every State has long 
since forced itself upon the minds of thinking and philanthropic 
men interested in the amelioration of the condition of the un- 
fortunate classes. They have been demanded and maintained 
by considerations alike of humanity and of wise public policy. 
The life of the uneducated deaf mute is shrouded in gross 
mental and moral darkness, though he may have his home in 
the midst of enlightenment and refinement. He is also apt to 
+
-P-A-G-E-535
a eGo 
be vicious and dependent, and thus a menace and a burden to 
his friends and to the communty. 
The attainments of the deaf and dumb in the educational 
line are necessarily limited in the State institution, but there is 
perhaps no other field where so much that is useful and neces- 
sary is acquired in a few years, as in a school for the deaf and 
dumb. 
At the Tennessee institution, the aim is to inculeate in every 
mind a love of learning and a desire to be intelligent, self-sup- 
porting, and helpful. The methods of instruction are those 
employed at most of the institutions throughout the country, 
and constitute what is known as the “combined system,” in- 
struction being imparted by the use of signs or pantomimic 
language, the manual alphabet, and writing, and in connection 
therewith, an effort is made by oral instruction to teach speech 
and lip-reading to all who may be profitably instructed in that 
way, and also to cultivate the slight sense of hearing which 
many children have who are often supposed to be totally deaf. 
The manual alphabet used is that made with one hand, which 
every person who has a deaf friend should learn as a ready and 
convenient means of communicating with him. It is easily 
learned, and is now being introduced into some of the text- 
-books for hearing children, in the hope that a general knowl- 
edge of it will not only be helpful as a means of enabling hear- 
ing persons to readily communicate with the deaf, but will also 
be useful in furnishing a medium of communication between 
hearing persons when silence is necessary or desirable, and when 
articulate speech is impossible or impracticable. 
During the first year at our institution for the deaf and dumb 
a child of good mind learns to write a legible hand and to com- 
municate intelligently with teacher and school-mates- by the 
use of signs; he also learns the meaning of several hundred 
words. In subsequent years his progress in the acquisition of 
language is slow bat sure, and, in most other essential elements 
of education, his progress will compare satisfactorily with that 
of his more favored hearing brother. The common school
-P-A-G-E-536
22GB sos, 
branches, such as arithmetic, geography, history, and grammar, 
are taught, the ordinary text-books being used. 
The older boys learn trades, printing and shoe-making being 
taught. The girls learn house-work, sewing, darning, mend- 
ing, ornamental needle-work, etc. A portion of the time of — 
each day is devoted to the industrial department. 
The requirements and the accommodations of the institution 
are gradually increasing. The attendance for the present year 
of the white department is one hundred and forty (140). Ten 
years ago it was about one hundred (100). 
The age of admission is eight years. Applicants must be of 
sufficiently good health and mind to be capable of being edu- 
cated. Where they have passed the age of childhood, their 
habits and morals are inquired into before they are admitted. 
All eligible children residing in the State are admitted to the 
institution free of charge for tuition, books, board, washing, and 
necessary medical attendance and medicines. 
The institution is maintained entirely by the State, and is 
under the immediate management of a Board of Trustees, who 
serve without compensation for the interest they have in the 
~ eause of the deaf and dumb, and for the welfare of the State. 
By careful management the institution has generally been main- 
tained on less money than other like institutions have required ; 
but the State has ever shown a willingness to meet all reason- 
able requests of the management for the proper maintenance 
or increase of the work. 
Within the past few years there have been representatives in 
the school from nearly all the counties of the State. At present 
about sixty counties are represented. 
The institution has a separate department for colored children 
situated on the Dandridge pike, east of Knoxville. This depart- 
ment was organized in rented premises in the year 1880. The 
present quarters, consisting of substantial yrick buildings with 
twenty-seven acres of land, were purchased in 1885. The 
attendance at the colored department is now twenty-five (25), 
t
-P-A-G-E-537
SG. o— 
making the attendance of both departments one hundred and 
sixty-tive (165). 
Superintendents and teachers throughout the State can render 
a kind service to any deaf children in their neighkorhood by 
reporting the facts to the principal of the institution at Knox- 
ville. Sometimes, even in the cities and towns, deaf children 
grow up without the advantages of the school because parents 
have no knowledge of it, and the officers of the institution have 
never heard of the children. This is especially apt to be the 
ease with children living in the more remote rural districts.

Tennessee School for the Blind, 
4 
Hon. W. R. Garrert, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn: 
Dear Srr—In setting forth matters pertaining to the work- 
ing and condition of the Tennessee School for the Blind, 
I can hardly do better than to give some extracts from my 
former reports, in which will be shown the scope and design of 
this work. 
No asylum or hospital was intended to be established in this 
institution, neither is it a charity, any more than the public 
schools and State University are charities. It is a part of the 
public school system of the State. As a mere matter of con-. 
venience and economy the blind children are gathered into one 
place and given a support while they receive what the State 
vouchsafes to every child—a preparation for life-work. This 
saves the expense of sending special teachers and appliances 
over the State to teach these in other schools. 
DOES IT PAY? 
Society does not take bong from the public schools that each 
pupil shall be assured a living after leaving school. It is 
enough if their working capacity is so enhanced as largely to 
increase their chances in life. Their happiness and their value 
as citizens are taken into consideration. But of the blind, 
more often than of others, it is asked, can they succeed after 
obtaining an education? The parents ask it—those who pay 
for the support of such schools may be expected to ask it. 
Some of the blind, like some who see, would not succeed even 
if endowed with the hundred eyes of Argus. Failure is written 
upon every feeble aspiration and engraved in every lineament
-P-A-G-E-543
SOs 
of character. Blindness strengthens neither will nor capacity. 
Of those who have applied themselves, and have remained 
_ long enough to acquire a liberal education in books, music, and 
handicraft, yery few have absolutely failed. Statistics can be 
brought ‘to 'show,that a large per cent. have succeeded alto- 
gether, and most of\the others in part, in making a support. 
» So'far as can be as¢ertained, no one from this Roheel, of indus- 
“trious habits, good character, and liberal attainments, has been 
compelled \to\decept am unearned support at the hands of the 
public. It is firmly believed that greater things will be seen 
when some who are‘now pupils shall come upon the stage of 
action, such has been the aptness displayed by them in taking 
advatitage of every opportunity for advancement. The course 
of study offered the blind until recently has been far too short 
and superficidt; but that blindness is a limitation which, to a 
large degree, can be overcome, is shown by what blind men 
have accomplished. Who has not heard of blind Homer, the 
father of poets, “the bard of Scio’s rocky isle?”? and of Milton, 
who, in his darkness, dictated Paradise Lost, that aimed, “ with 
no middle flight to soar.” Diodorus, a stoic philosopher, emi- 
nent in Greek and geometry, was the blind preceptor of Cicero. 
Didymus, a blind theologian of Alexandria, was the teacher of 
the great Jerome. By Sir Isaac Newton’s request, blind Saun- 
derson succeeded him to the chair of mathematics in Cambridge, 
and was not only an eminent instructor and author in that 
branch, but was profound in Greek and Latin as well. The 
late Mr. Fawcett was given the position of Postmaster-general 
of England by Mr. Gladstone. When reproached for giving 
such office to a blind man, Gladstone replied: “He is the best 
fitted of any member of Parliament for the place.” The reforms — 
and improvements brought about by Fawcett proved the state- 
ment true. In different ages of the world men blind from in- 
fancy have attained to almost all the learned degrees, and 
have reached the highest excellence in almost every cee 
ment of life. 
A resume of what has been done in the past for the education 
of the blind has been often called for. Such is here given. 
No organized effort was made to educate the blind until Val-
-P-A-G-E-544
eet ea ae 
entine Hauy began the work at Paris, a little over a hundred 
years ago. Hauy began with one blind boy, whom he hired to 
attend his instruction. For the use of this pupil, who proved 
to be bright, he invented raiséd or embossed print. “ Soon other 
blind youths were gathered in and instructed. ; 
The work attracted the attention and met the approval of 
the Academy of Sciences and Art. In 1786 his pupils, then 
twenty-four in number, were called upon to exhibit their at- 
tainments in the presence of the king and royal family at Ver- 
sailles. The royal patronage was secured for the new enter- 
prise, the school increased in numbers, and some of the pupils 
became famous, especially in mathematics and music. 
The French Revolution interfered with the werk, and a mad 
freak on the part of the authorities to put in old blind persons, 
thus turning the school into an asylum, drove Hauy to Russia, 
where, under direction of the Czar, he founded a school, which 
still exists. Other institutions were founded in different parts 
of Europe. Unfortunately, many of these were homes for blind 
paupers, rather than institutions of learning. 
By this means the term “asylum” and “inmate” came into 
vogue, and are often ignorantly and offensively applied to schools 
and pupils in this country, though only one or two asylums ex- 
ist in America, while there are more than thirty schools. Like 
most first inventions, Hauy’s print was far from being perfect. 
Many forms for letters were tried, with more or less success, 
but no great degree of perfection was attained until Dr. Howe, 
of Boston, adopted lower-case letters of somewhat angular 
form. 
This print has been found readily discernable to the touch of 
a large number of blind people, and has been extensively used. 
All difficulties were not yet surmounted. There was no method 
of writing music, nor was there any way by which the blind’ 
might commit their knowledge and thoughts to writing in such 
manner as to be read by themselves. 
‘The invention of Louis Braille, himself a blind man, fur- 
28 s, p.1.—Ap. E.
-P-A-G-E-545
  ego 
nished at once a means of writing music and of intereommuni- 
eation between the blind. About 1829 he began writing in 
point. This was soon after introduced into the school jn Paris, 
of which Braille had been a pupil, but its publication was de- 
layed ten years, after which it spread rapidly. ‘he basis of the 
_ Braille writing is dots or points arranged in groups, the differ- 
ent positions of the points with reference to each other, consti- 
_tuting the different letters of the alphabet. There are a num- 
ber of groups used for abbreviations and for frequently used 
words, making a sort of short-hand system, but the alphabet is 
represented as aforesaid. 
This construction gives us six possible points in a vertical 
parallelogram, one or more being omitted to form each letter. 
This point print is used on a large scale for both music and 
literature, and is more easily read than raised print, from the 
fact that it is easier to determine by touch the number and po- 
sition of points in a group than to discern the slight differences 
which exist between some of the letters. New York point, 
used in the American Printing House for the Blind, at Louis- 
ville, Ky., has a horizontal instead of a vertical parallelogram, 
as well as a different arrangement of the dots. 
Of course there are presses for printing point rapidly, but by 
means of slates or frames the blind write it very fast, even copy- 
ing entire books sometimes. In fact the justly celebrated blind 
historian, Prescott, wrote out his histories with one of these. 
The best writing frame has a smooth surface of wood, upon 
which the thick paper used in writing is placed. 
This paper is kept in position by means of two pins and a 
clamp. A double-bladed brass rule is arranged for one blade to 
slide under, while the other slides over the paper. 
The blade above has a double row of oblong openings, while 
the one below has six pits for each opening above. By having 
a double row of openings two lines are written with one move- 
ment of the rule.
-P-A-G-E-546
piers 
The instrument for writing is a blunt awl, which, being pressed 
through the openings in the upper blade of the rule into one of. 
the six pits of the lower blade, carries before it a cap of the 
intervening paper which can easily be felt as a point, or prom- 
inence, when the paper is reversed. 
In order to be read from left to right in the usual manner, 
the writing is done from right to left. Arithmetic and algebra 
are studied with the aid of a frame having square or octagonal 
apertures, in which the pupil sets up type having on the end 
characters which represent different figures and symbols, as the 
type is turned in different positions. 
The diagrams of geometry are now printed, but may be made 
by running the unthreaded needle of the sewing machine along 
the lines of the figures drawn on thick paper. 
Schools for the blind were established in Boston, New York, 
and Philadelphia about 1833, but on account of his eminence 
-and energy, Dr. Howe, the first director of the Boston school, 
became the pioneer in this work in America. 
Dr. Howe brought a fine education and wide-spread reputa- 
tion to this field, and before entering upon the task visited the 
various institutions of Europe and made a study of all that had 
been done for the blind. He visited different States, and was 
instrumental in establishing a number of schools, There are 
now thirty-two schools for the blind in the United States. 
These form part of the public school systems of the States in 
which they are located, though all the New England States join 
in the support of the Boston school. None of these are intended 
in any sense to be asylums, since the pupils return home during 
vacations, and leave school when their education is finished. 
There is no national school for the blind, as there is for the deaf 
and dumb, nor ought there to be, since the blind will learn to 
get on in life better by finishing their education in colleges for 
the seeing. Those who lay a good foundation in special schools — 
for the blind, and are apt and studious, can easily keep pace 
with the classes in colleges by having their lessons read to them. 
As few of the blind can afford a course in college, it would be
-P-A-G-E-547
ee — 74 — 
- exceedingly fortunate for them if a fund could be provided to 
found a few scholarships, whereby a larger number could obtain 
a finished education. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind was founded about 1844. 
The State made the first appropriation to itin 1846. Revs. J. T. 
Edgar, R. B. C. Howell, and J. T. Wheat were the first trustees. 
Previous to 1850 the school had five superintendents, to wit: 
James Champlin, W. H. Churchman, E. W. Whaler, Jacob Berry, 
and Henry Fortescue. In November, 1850, J. M. Sturtevant, of 
Massachusetts, was made superintendent, and served until his 
death in December, 1882. The State in 1851 made its first ap- 
propriation for a building, and previous to 1861 had expended 
$25,000 on building and grounds. 
In 1861 Confederates took the building for a hospital. The 
Federals did the same on reaching Nashville. The building was 
demolished November, 1862, by order of General St. Clair Mor- 
ton, Chief of the Engineers of the Army of the Ohio, United 
States Army. 4 
The school was reorganized in 1867, and was carried on at a 
great disadvantage in rented buildings. In October, 1872, Judge 
John M. Lea, of Nashville, purchased for $15,000 the present 
site, then known as the “Claiborne residence,” together with 
seven acres of land, and donated the whole to the State for a 
school for the blind. The location is a beautiful one on Fill- 
more Street, in the south-eastern portion of the city of Nash- 
ville. The Legislature of 1873 accepted the gift and appropri- 
ated $40,000 to erect a portion of the present building. 
In 1875 an appropriation of $30,000 was made.. To this 
amount was allowed to be added $24,000 which had been saved 
from the regular appropriation, because an allowance had been 
made for a larger number of pupils than was entered. 
A building was bought in 1880 for $8,000, in which to carry - 
on school for colored blind children. This has been in success- 
ful operation since that time. 4
-P-A-G-E-548
eerie 
After the death of Mr. Sturtevant, Loyal A. Biglow, of New 
York, was superintendent until July, 1886. 
In August, 1886, the present superiutendent took charge. 
The following gentlemen have served as presidents of the Board 
of Trustees: Rev. J. T. Edgar, Rev. R. B. C. Howell, Judge 
E. H. East, Judge John M. Lea, and Mr. J. G@. Houston, all of 
Davidson County. 
On the death of Mr. Houston last year Mr. J. W. Bonner 
was chosen to fill his place. 
“What can the blind do when educated?” is the question 
asked again and again. A recent and valuable work, “ Educa- 
tion in the United States,” written by Richard G. Boone, A.M., 
for the educational series edited by Dr. W. T. Harris, under 
head of ‘“‘ Occupations of the Blind,” gives the following: Su- 
perintendents of institutions, 16; teachers in schools not for the 
blind, 62; teachers of the blind, 135; ministers, 36; studying 
and practicing law, 5; authors, 17; publishers, 8; agents and 
lecturers, 70; teachers of music, 463; church organists, 88 ;. piano 
tuners, 125; manufacturers, 305; handicraftsmen, 702; mer- 
chants, 269; farmers, 59.” 
‘As shown by the report, they are scattered through various 
avocations. It is said that no less than two hundred pupils of 
the pioneer school at Paris are choristers and organists in the 
churches of France. 
Blind musicians are well adapted to such positions, as well as 
to do excellent work in teaching, but are often kept from open- 
ings by an unreasoning skepticism, which does not even care 
to give a blind artist an opportunity to attest his skill. The 
blind can do good work as literary teachers, since a highly 
cultivated sense of hearing enables them to detect any slight 
disorder in the recitation-room, and a cultivated memory en- 
ables them to retain and present the lessons as they occur. 
Sanderson, De Werde, and many others have demonstrated 
this. John Metcalf, the great road-builder of England, has 
_ shown that the blind may succeed where it is least expected.
-P-A-G-E-549
pg 
‘Lewis B. Carell, a blind man of New Jersey, who graduated 
from the New York School for the Blind and from Columbia 
College, wrote “A Treatise on the Calculus of Variations,” 
which created a profound impression among mathematicians 
both in America and Europe, though few knew of the blindness 
of the learned author. 
The attendance during the last few years has been on the in- 
crease in the Tennessee School for the Blind. The average at- 
tendance for the two years ending January, 1891, was eighty- 
six. During the present school-year ninety-seven have already 
entered. The work is progressing as well as at any time in the 
past. The last Legislature made an appropriation of $37,000 
for the regular expenses of the school for the ensuing two 
years, with an additional $3,000 for repairs and improvements, 
This has been expended in such way, we believe, as to add to 
the health of the pupils and the preservation of the building. 
Respectfully submitted, f

-P-A-G-E-558
Ropes 
3. That las no proper or sufficient guardianship to care for 
its physical, moral, and mental welfare, to at least such a degree 
as will probably save the child from pauperism, lewdness, and | 
crime. 
4. That is found destitute, either being an orphan, or having 
a parent or parents undergoing imprisonment or confined in a 
lunatic asylum, or where both parents are habitual drunkards, 
or where the only living parent is a habitual drunkard, and any 
child of such parent is not properly supported and controlled. 
_ 5. That frequents the company of lewd, wanton, or lascivious 
“persons in speech or behavior, or notorious resorts of bad 
character. 
6. That is found wandering in streets, alleys, or public places, 
with no means of support. 
7. That has been abandoned in any way by parent or parents, © 
or guardian, and has no means of support, and with idle habits; — 
and if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said County 
Court that it would be manifestly for the interest of said child 
that it be committed to the Tennessee Industrial School, the 
Court will so order and send the child to said school, to be held 
by it under the charter and by-laws of said school. 
Suc. 2. Be it further enacted, That said Industrial School may 
receive any child placed in its care and keeping by its parent or 
parents without the authority of any court; and said school

age, unless sooner taken away by the request of its parent or 
parents, and released under the authority and by-laws of said 
school. 
Suc. 3. Be it further enacted, That the parent or parents may, 
and guardians other than parents must, invoke the authority of 
the County Court when they desire to commit any child to said 
school, on the ground that said parent or parents, or guardian, 
or those having the child in charge are unable to control the 
child; and this is hereby made a ground for committing a child 
_ tosaid school; Provided, It appear to the satisfaction of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-559
8G 228 
Court or officer before whom said child is brought for commit- 
ment, that the commitment would probably be for the child’s 
interest and welfare. But said Industrial School shall not re- 
ceive any child under this or the preceding section until its 
parent or parents, or guardians, or persons having the child in 
charge, shall satisfactorily agree with the officers of said school 
to supply sufficient funds for the maintenance of the child 
therein during its stay, and shall further agree to abide by all 
the rules, by-laws and requirenients of said Industrial School. 
Src. 4. Be it further enacted, That no child shall be committed 
to said school, or received or retained therein, on any ground 
other than the one single ground that the interest and welfare 
of the child will be thereby probably promoted.

ful reception of any child into the school, and during its stay, 
the school shall have exclusive care, custody, and control of said 
child until it shall be discharged therefrom.

- over sixteen years of age, in case of females, and under eight 
aud over eighteen, in case of males, shall be committed to said

mitment shall be to commit the child until he or she is twenty- 
one years of age, unless sooner discharged by the officers of said 
school pursuant to its by-law, who shall have authority to sooner 
' discharge any child from the school, whenever, in their judg- 
ment, it shall be for the interest of the child to do so. 
Szc. 8. Be it further enacted, That the officers and managers 
of said school shall receive and take into it all children com- 
mitted thereto by competent authority, as aforesaid, and shall 
cause all children in such school to be instructed in such

for by the party committing it’at the rate of one hundred dol- 
lars per annum, payable monthly or quarterly in advance, as 
may be agreed upon by the officers of said institution when the — 
child is committed. 
Sxo. 11. Be it further enacted, That the Board of Directors of 
said institution shall consist of seven persons—two from the 
Eastern, two from the Western, and three from the Middle Di- 
vision of the State—who shall hold their offices two for two 
years, two for four years, and three for six years, besides. the

WATKINS INSTITUTE NIGHT SCHOOLS. 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—In compliance with your request, this sketch of 
the Night Schools of Watkins Institute is submitted, together 
with such statistics as may be of interest to the profession. 
The following extract from the circular, issued before the 
opening of the schools in November last, will give a clear idea 
of the scope of work done and the conditions of membership: 
ORGANIZATION. 
The school is divided into four classes or grades, designated 
paclasses. “A,” ‘B,” “C7? and “« D.? 
In class A will be taught reading, writing, spelling, primary 
-arithmetic, and primary grammar. 
In class B will be taught practical arithmetic (begun), Eng- 
lish grammar, spelling, and writing. 
In class C will be taught practical arithmetic (completed, ex- 
cept commercial arithmetic), natural science, civil government, 
and writing. 
In class D will be taught commercial arithmetic, book-keep- 
ing, type-writing, short-hand, and writing. 
ADMISSION. 
It is the purpose of the Commissioners to offer the benefits 
of the school to all persons of good moral character of either 
sex, who desire instruction in the branches taught therein, and 
who are willing to attend regularly and punctually, and to com-
-P-A-G-E-569
sas) aie 
ply with the regulations of the school, subject to the following 
conditions: 
1. The number of pupils admitted is limited to the number 
of seats provided; 150 pupils can be accommodated. 
2. Preference will be given to those who attended the school 
regularly last year, provided the applicant is unable to attend a 
day school. ‘ 
8. Preference will be given, in the order of application to 
those unable to attend a day school. 4 
4. A list will be kept of all applicants who, being eligible, 
fail to be admitted for want of room. If a vacaney occur, the 
next applicant on the list will be notified of the vacancy, and 
admitted to the seat. 
For the purpose of issuing certificates of admission and ar- 
ranging classes, the Superintendent will be present at the sclfool- 
room on Thursday and Friday nights, October 29 and 30, between 
6 and 8 o’clock. 
REGULATIONS. 
The school will be organized and conducted as a regular 
school. It will be in session every night in the week except 
Saturday night, and will continue in operation four months. 
Tuition is free in all departments. Regular and punctual at- 
tendance and compliance with the regulations are required as 
conditions of continuance in the school. Absence for three 
consecutive nights without good excuse, disorderly conduct, or 
habitual inattention will forfeit the scholarship. 
It is the design of the Commissioners to extend the benefits 
of Mr. Watkins’ bequest to as many persons as possible, and to 
those who make the best use of the opportunity. As it is im- 
possible to provide for all applicants, persons who fail to make 
use of the opportunities offered them cannot be permitted to re- 
tain their scholarships to the exclusion of others who would use 
them better. : '
-P-A-G-E-570

Text-books will be used to a limited extent. Such text- 
books or stationery as may be required must be provided by 
pupils at their own expense. 
  The statistical tables cover the work of the year 1890-91, 
while Hon. W. R. Garrett was Superintendent.

From No. 6 it is seen that the total enrollment was 254 and 
the per cent. of attendance 78.24—a remarkable showing for 
night schools. 
By examining tables 1, 2, 4, and 5, it is found that the aver- 
age daily attendance was 130, 93, 93, and 79 for the months of 
November, December, January, and February respectively. 
These figures are significant as showing the greatest falling off 
during the first month and the steadiness with which those who 
entered for work and improvement, not play and entertainment, 
attended to the last. 
Certain it is, that the benefactor would be pleased, if he could 
look down on this institution, where those who have to work 
in the day, and those who were deprived of the advantages of 
education in youth, are striving to keep pace with the progress 
of the times in the face of great obstacles. 
Very respectfully, 
H. C. Wezer, Superintendent.

HAMILTON COUNTY LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
In accordance with your request, I submit the following re- 
port of the origin and organization of the Hamilton County 
Teachers’ Library Association : 
_ Ata meeting of the Hamilton County Educational Associa- 
tion, February 28, 1891, ““ Needed Changes in County School- 
work” was discussed by Supt. H. D. Huffaker, who recom- 
mended, among other things, a teachers’ circulating library. 
The matter was again diccussed at the March meeting (March 
28), and by unanimous vote the teachers agreed to establish the 
Hamilton County Teachers’ Circulating Library, and the Snu- 
perintendent was empowered to appoint a committee of four to 
act with himself in making preliminary arrangements. ‘The 
following teachers were appointed: Samuel Hixson, J. B. 
Rogers, Miss L. M. Rosencrance, and Mrs. Jennie E. Struble. 
The committee, after correspondence with the State Superin- 
tendent, and with the library association of the city of Chat- 
tanooga, and after consulting every source of information within 
their reach, decided to solicit subscriptions of money or books, © 
with a view to accumulating a library, of which pedagogical 
works should constitute a prominent feature. After accumu- 
lating about 200 volumes, most of which were donated, the 
committee thought it best to call a meeting of the Association 
for the purpose of making a formal and public opening of the 
library. 
In accordance with the call of the committee, the Hamilton 
County Educational Association convened at the Court-house 
January 9, at 10 a.m., with President Milliken in the chair. 
After prayer by B. F. Jones, an interesting lesson on “ Civil
-P-A-G-E-579
Eig a 
Government” was conducted by J. B. Ziegler. Then followed 
a recitation on the “ History of Tennessee,” conducted by Miss 
Hattie L. Seaver. ' 
The formal opening of the Teachers’ Circulating Library be- 
gan at 1:15 o’clock. Supt. H. D. Huffaker, chairman of the 
committee, opened the exercises with a reference to the im- 
portance of the library project and formally presented the 
library to the teachers. 
On account of a death in the family of State Superintendent 
Garrett, he was unable to be present. However, he sent an in- 
teresting and encouraging letter, which was read by Professor 
Goodman, Secretary of the State Board of Education, Nashville, 
Tenn., as follows: 
“Sate oF TENNESSEE, 
“DEPARTMENT OF PuBLIC INSTRUCTION, 
“ NAsHVILLE, TENN., January 8, 1892. 
“Prof. H. D. Huffaker, Superintendent of Hamilton County, Chat- (yaKer, ) > 
tanooga, Tenn. : j 
« Dear Srr—I have been so unwell since the death of my son, 
which occurred the 29th of December, that I am unable to meet 
my appointment with you to-morrow. I shall be with you, 
however, in spirit. 
“The establishment of the Hamilton County Teachers’ Library 
speaks volumes for you and your teachers. It is a monument 
to the past, and a promise for the future. The very fact that 
the teachers of your county have made a united and successful 
effort to establish a library is a proof of the high standard to 
which they have already attained. If the sentiments which 
have inspired them to establish it shall prompt them to use it 
properly, its benefit to the educational interests of Hamilton 
County will be felt through all future time. 
“Such a library should contain a complete list of pedagogical 
works; with duplicates of a few of the most important works. 
This list should include works on the history of education. © 
Every teacher should be acquainted with the various phases of °
-P-A-G-E-580
On sta : 
education which have prevailed in the world in difterent coun- 
tries, and at different times. He should be familiar with the 
history of the great leaders of educational thought; their the-_ 
ories, their methods, their deeds, their lessons, their virtnes, and 
their faults. He draws inspiration from the lives of great edu- 
cators, as the student of political history is inspired by the lives _ 
of heroes and statesmen. 
“The library should also contain works on the philosophy of 
education, and on methods of instruction and school admin- 
istration. 
“ Practical works should be mingled with theoretical works, 
The best educational periodicals should be taken, and teachers 
should read and study them, in order to keep abreast with cur- 
rent educational thought. Arrangements should be made to 
keep supplied with the current official educational reports and 
statistics, and books of reference. 
“Such a connection should be maintained between the library 
and the reading circle and Institutes, as to secure unity of pur- 
pose. To this end, I recommend that topies for study be des- 
ignated at fixed intervals, monthly or quarterly, to which all 
the teachers of the county may direct attention, and to which 
they may devote reading, reflection, and discussion, as well as 
observation in their school-rooms. If all the educators of your 
county will thus direct their minds at the same time to the same 
topic, and pursue its consideration through a course of observa- 
tion, reading, reflection, and discussion, they will inspire each 
other and will reach results more definite, broader, and clearer 
than they would obtain from separate and desultory study. 
“T have so far alluded only to the pedagogical part of the 
teachers’ library. This should be full and complete, because 
works of this character will not be accessible in any other pub- 
lic library. I suppose that you will be offered such interchanges 
of courtesy with other libraries of the city of Chattanooga, as 
will secure the members of your Association access to works of — 
science, history, and general literature, and to books of general 
reference. Still, it would be better to have in your own library 
,     
-P-A-G-E-581
pat ee 
some of the best works of general reference, and as large a col- 
lection of works of science, history, and general literature as 
_your means can supply. 
“Tn a regular course of pedagogical study, the teacher will 
find almost a liberal education, so comprehensive and varied is 
its compass. Yet the teacher needs more than professional 
training. He needs more as a man, and he needs more as a 
teacher. His office is to mold character, intellect, impulse, 
will. Then, he should be as elevated and as broad as humanity. 
He should embody Dryden’s description of Cromwell: 
From all tempers he could service draw, 
The worth of each with its alloy he knew, 
And as the confidant of nature, saw 
How she complexions did divide and brew. 
For, he their single virtues did survey 
By intuition in his own large breast, 
Where all the bright ideas of them lay, 
Which were a rule and measure to the rest. 
“The teacher, then, needs much outside of his profession to 
make him perfect within his profession. He needs general cult- 
ure to elevate his mind and to lift him to a higher plane as a 
man and as an educator. 
“Tn the beautiful words of Addison: ‘A man of polite im- 
agination is let in to a great many pleasures which hide them- 
selves from the common eye. He looks upon the world ina 
new light, and feels a property in every thing he sees. He can 
converse with a picture, and finds an agreeable companion in a 
statue, and often feels in the mere prospect of fields and mead- 
ows a greater satisfaction than another does in their possession. 
There are few men who have a relish of any pleastres that are 
not criminal, and their first step out of business is into vice or 
folly. A man should endeavor, therefore, to make the sphere 
of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible, that he may retire- 
into them with safety, and find in them such a satisfaction asa 
wise man should not blush to take.’ 
“Such should be the imagination, the taste, and the aspiration 
of all who are intrusted with the training of youth. Noble f é
-P-A-G-E-582
i 
impulses, beautiful thoughts, pure sentiments should be in the 
heart and the mind of the teacher. If they live in his heart 
and his mind, they will breathe from his lips and radiate from 
his countenance, and will enter like sunshine into the hearts 
and minds of his pupils. 
“For his own happiness, for his own improvement, as well as 
for his usefulness as an educator, the teacher should hold com- 
‘ munion with the best thinkers and the best men of the world, 
and should elevate his mind to their standards. This commun- 
ion may be held through their books. Their best thoughts, 
their most poetic visions of beauty, their deepest reasoning, 
their noblest sentiments, their treasures of knowledge are stored 
in their published works. Books and libraries furnish the me- 
dium by which we may commune with all that is most beauti- 
ful and noble in humanity, and happy is the man who uses 
them aright. 
“These thoughts, which come into my mind as I reflect on the 
auspicious event which your teachers will celebrate to-morrow, 
fill me with hope for the future prosperity of education in your 
county, and with gratitude for the noble example which you 
have set for the State. Convey to your teachers my regret that 
Iam compelled to be absent, and my cordial wishes for their 
health and prosperitys 
“T cannot close without expressing to you my congratulations 
on the success uf the work, which I know is so largely due to 
your personal efforts, and which lies so near to your heart. 
Please send me full accounts of the day’s proceedings and a 
sketch of the organization of the library for use in my forth- 
coming annual report. Unexpected delay in the publication 
gives an opportunity to include it, if sent at once. 
“Very truly, your friend, 
‘OW. R.. GARRETT.” 
Professor Goodman made a pleasant reference to Superintend- 
ent Garrett’s desire to be present, and of his interest in the cause 
of education. During his talk, Mr. Goodman said that the 
plan used in preparing exhibits in Hamilton County last year
-P-A-G-E-583

will be recommended for use throughout the State in preparing 
material for the exhibit at the World’s Fair. 
Secretary Goulding, of the Chattanooga Library Association, 
then gave an instructive lecture on “The Value of Professional 
Libraries.” He presented in forcible terms the value of such 
libraries, and urged the teachers to make good use of the one 
they now had. He would be always ready and willing to lend 
a helping hand in making the enterprise a success. 
The Hamilton County Teachers’ Library Association was 
then organized as follows: President, F. B. Harris; vice-presi- 
dent, Miss Lillian Rosencrance; secretary, Samuel Hixson; 
treasurer and librarian, Superintendent Huffaker.

The teachers and school-officers of Hamilton County take a 
lively interest in the Library Association, and in its aceompany- 
ing features of reading, study, and discussion. From their en- 
thusiasm, regular attendance, and careful preparation for the 
exercises, I have every reason to hope for useful results.

THE ELLIOTT LIBRARY, 
FOR THE TEACHERS OF THE NASHVILLE CITY SCHOOLS. 
Hon. W. R. Garrerr, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I herewith inclose a reply to your request that I 
furnish you with somewhat of a history of the Teachers’ Li- 
brary Association, together with a sketch of the life of Geo. B. 
- Elliott. 
The Nashville Public School Teachers’-Association was or- 
ganized in March, 1886. Its objects, as set forth in its constitu- 
tion, are: “To establish a library; to promote professional 
knowledge; to foster a spirit of general culture.” 
At the meeting for organization, Z. H. Brown, the present 
Superintendent of the city schools, was elected President; Miss 
Teresa McKeon, Vice-president; J. C. Shirley, Secretary and 
Treasurer; A. D. Wharton, Misses M. A. Watson and M. D. 
McClelland, Executive Committee. 
These officers constituted the first Board of Directors, and 
were to serve until the following September, the term of office 
thereafter to be one year. 
‘At-the annual meeting in September, 1886, ninety-eight mem- 
bers were enrolled, and the librarian reported one pee” and 
sixty-eight volumes in the library. 
At ie meeting the following officers were elected: G. B. 
Elliott, President; R. W. Jones, Vice-president; Miss Teresa 
McKeon, Secretary and Treasurer; Dr. A. J. Cavert, Col. OC. G. 
Rogers, and Miss Laura Y. Rains, Executive Committee. The 
newly elected board was directed to procure a charter of incor-
-P-A-G-E-591
—18— f 
poration for the Association. This was done, the formalities. 
incident to procuring the charter being concluded September 
25, 1886. ; 
Since the expiration of Mr. Elfiott’s term, Messrs. A. D. 
Wharton, J. F. Lipscomb, and T. W. Haley have served as 
President. Mr. Haley is now serving his second term. 
Since its organization the Association has continued to 
flourish, and now nearly every teacher in the corps isa member 
and gives it hearty support. ‘ 
The library has increased rapidly, and is a well-seleected col- 
lection of books. It is especially rich in works of a purely 
literary character; but education, history, biography, travels, 
and fiction are by no means neglected. 
An important feature of the library is the large number of 
periodicals taken. This feature is due to the liberality of 
George Bailey Elliott, late principal of Tarbox School. At his 
death, he left to thé Association $3,000, to be invested according 
to his directions, the income to be devoted to the purchase and. 
binding of periodicals. On account of this generosity, and in 
memory of his devotion to the welfare of the library, it was, by 
a formal vote of the Association, named, in his honor, the “ El- 
liot Library.” 
Another feature of the library is the circulation of a selection 
of the periodicals through the schools, which are divided into 
circuits for that purpose. The Association meets monthly 
from September to May, no meetings being held during the va- 
cation. A permanent committee, consisting of one member 
from each school represented in the Association, directs the or- 
-der of exercises other than the regular order of business, at 
every meéting. This order of exercises, at the pleasure of the 
committee, “embraces subjects educational, historical, or liter- 
ary, by prepared paper or informal discussion.’ ‘The exercises 
are designed to be entertaining as well as instructive, and the 
meetings are usually well attended by the teachers and their 
friends.. Ordinarily, the teachers themselves take part in the
-P-A-G-E-592
—i9—> 
exercises, which generally consist of essays, discussions, recita- 
tions, and music. Frequently eminent persons are invited to 
address the Association. Occasionally the address is followed 
by a discussion of its subj@#et by the members present. 
The affairs of the Association are managed by the Directors. 
They meet monthly, and report to the Association at every 
general meeting. 
As its name indicates, membership in the Association is con- 
fined to teachers and officers of the Nashville public schools. 
However, those who have once been members of the Association 
are permitted to retain their membership, although they have 
left the corps of teachers. Pupils of the senior class in the high 
school have also been allowed the privileges of the library. 
While the Association has no organic connection with the 
system of schools, membership in it being entirely voluntary, 
and its meetings independent of the regular Normal meetings 
of the teachers, those in a position to judge are confident that. 
great good has resulted to the schools from its organization. 
Further, it is no disparagement to those who were zealously 
active in organizing the Association, to say that George Bailey 
Elliott was the prime mover in its inception. This is conceded 
by all who know its history. It is hardly too much to say that 
he created the interest which led to its organization. For years 
he had felt the necessity for a teachers’ library, and urged its 
establishment. After the Association was organized he was in- 
strumental in obtaining large donations of money and books, 
and, to the day of his death, was always ready in its aid with 
voice and hand and purse. 
George Bailey Elliott was born on August 28, 1841, near 
Yorktown, Va. Tis father, who was a farmer, died when he 
was an infant, and his mother removed with her family to 
Hampton. There, having a small estate, sufficient for their. 
support and the education of the daughter and two sons, they 
lived the uneventful life of a retired village. 
‘Mr. Elliott obtained his primary education at the Hampton 
Mi litary Academy.

His ardent desire from early youth was to study medicine 
and become a surgeon in the United States navy. 
When he was about twelve years ote his left eye was attacked 
by a tumor, which caused his seclusion in a dark room for 
many weeks. When he became well enough to return to school,- 
this eye was accidentally struck by a ball on the academy play- — 
ground, and the injury occasioned the entire loss of that eye. 
This misfortune obliged him to give up the hope of obtain- 
ing a position in the medical department of the navy. After 
he had finished the military academy course, he made applica- 
tion at Washington for a relaxation in his case, the rule requir- 
ing physical perfection, but neither his own ettorts, nor those of 
his friends could procure it. 
The great object to which he had looked forward having 
thus been put out of his reach, he made no further plans for the 
business of life. 
In 1859 he became a student at the University of Virginia, 
and continued there until the civil commotion of 1861 called 
him home to Hampton. Very soon afterwards that town was 
burned, on the evacuation of the Confederate forces, and the 
property of his family was entirely destroyed. 
- In January, 1862, the family came to Nashville, and Mr. El- 
liott began his career as a teacher by becoming assistant to Mr. 
R. Dorman in a school opened by the latter in Nashville when 
the public schools were closed. At the beginning of the next 
school-year he himself established a school, in a house especially 
built for him by the people of the neighborhood, a few miles 
west of Goodlettsville. This school he conducted with success 
for some years. 
He was then fivited to take charge of Robertson Academy, 
im the Ninth District of Davidson County. Here he taught 
_ many pupils who now, as men and women, recall him with re- 
‘ spect and, regard.

   From this academy he took a position in the public sé) 
of Nashville, and continued therein with a short interval dt 
the remainder of his life. ‘ 
*“ 
He was a ripe scholar, especially well grounded in all academi 
studies, and always accurate. As a teacher, he was firm, cons) 
siderate, kind, patient, and mindful of the infirmities of his — 
gi pupils. 
    In his intercourse with all, he was a model of sincerity and 
truthfulness, and he so despised all forms of delusion and vain. 
show as to have the reputation of extreme bluntness with those 
who looked no further than the outer surface. His whole soul 
was in his work as a teacher. During the years in which he 
was the principal of the Tarbox School, he seemed to his 
friends to think of nothing else, and not long before his death 
he remarked that he would rather be the principal of that 
school than Governor of the State. 
- That his personal character and ability as an instructor was 
appreciation by the teachers connected with him and the pupils 
over whom he presided, was attested by the numberless i inqui- 
ries made during his illness, and repeated expressions of regard 
and affection. 
His last thoughts were in reference to the public schools. By 
his will he gave three thousand dollars to the Library Assoei- 
ation organized by the white teachers, and seven hundred dol- 
_ lars to establish annual medals to be awarded to the best grad- 
uate in the high school and the best scholar in the last three 
grades taught in the Tarbox School. In giving instructions for 
the preparation of his will, he said that his sole purpose in pro- 
viding for these medals was that an incentive might thus be » 
farnished for diligence in study, and that the hope of gaining 
an honor might incite ambition. 
_ Mr. Elliott was the first principal of a public school in Nash- 
ville who has died while holding the position. After a long 
and wasting illness, he departed this life in perfect peace. His 
fri tation

that all the influence he exerted was for good, and that his 
memory has but the single regret—that his life was not longer 
spared. 
He died April 1, 1890, at 12:40 o’clock p.m.

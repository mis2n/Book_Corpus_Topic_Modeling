FUNDS RECEIVED 9 
The Charter was duly accepted by the Trus- 
tees at their first meeting, held in Room 1409, 
26 Broadway, New York City, on May 22, 1913. 
All the incorporators were present, except Mr. 
John D. Rockefeller, who sent a letter expressing 
his confidence in the Trustees and his personal 
regard for them. 
At the same meeting a Constitution’ and 
By-Laws’ were adopted, and the following 
officers were elected: President, John Davison 
Rockefeller, Jr.; Secretary, Jerome Davis Greene; 
Treasurer, Louis Guerineau Myers. 
FUNDS RECEIVED 
At the same meeting the Foundation came 
into the possession of the first funds to be 
entrusted to it, in the form of securities amount- 
ing in par value to Three million two hundred 
thousand dollars ($3,200,000), previously given 
by Mr. Rockefeller in trust to John D. Rocke- 
feller, Jr., Starr J. Murphy, Edward L. Ballard 
and Jerome D. Greene, Trustees, for purposes 
identical with those of the Foundation, on the 
understanding that if the Foundation should 
become incorporated, the funds should be turned 
over to it. By subsequent gifts of securities, 
as of the dates indicated below, Mr. Rockefeller 
increased the funds of the Foundation to the 
sum of One hundred million dollars ($100,000,- 
000). Mrs. John D. Rockefeller also gave to

  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION i 
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
The first meetings of the Rockefeller Foun- 
dation, after its legal organization had been 
completed, were devoted to the discussion of 
the policies and lines of work which were 
likely to present the largest probability of 
permanent and far-reaching usefulness. There 
was a general agreement that the advancement 
of public health through medical research and 
education, including the demonstration of known 
methods of treating and preventing disease, 
afforded the surest prospect of such usefulness. 
It was, accordingly, decided at the meeting of 
June 27, 1913, to establish the International 
Health Commission, the immediate purposes 
and general aims of which were set forth in the 
following resolutions: 
Whereas the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, organized 
in 1909 for the eradication of hookworm disease in the 
United States, has found more than two million people 
in the Southern States to be infected with the disease, 
involving vast suffering, partial arrest of physical, mental 
and normal growth, great loss of life, and noticeable decrease 
in economic efficiency over vast regions; and 
Whereas the Commission has treated or caused to be 
treated more than five hundred thousand persons; has 
ascertained that the diagnosis of the disease can be made 
with ease and certainty and that it can be readily cured 
and easily prevented; has found that the people, physicians, 
state boards of health, county and municipal officers are 
eager to cooperate in all helpful ways, and that, following
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the treatment and cure of this disease, an intelligent 
public interest is awakened in hygiene and in modern 
scientific medicine and in practical measures for per- 
manent public sanitation; and 
Whereas the Commission has ascertained by diligent 
and extensive inquiry that hookworm disease prevails 
in a belt of territory encircling the earth for thirty degrees 
on each side of the equator, inhabited, according to current 
estimates, by more than a thousand million people; that 
the infection in some nations rises to nearly ninety per 
cent of the entire population; that this disease has probably 
been an important factor in retarding the economic, social, 
intellectual and moral progress of mankind; that the 
infection is being spread by emigration; and that where 
it is most severe little or nothing is being done toward its 
arrest or prevention; therefore be it 
Resolved, that this Foundation is prepared to extend to 
other countries and peoples the work of eradicating 
hookworm disease as opportunity offers, and so far as 
practicable to follow up the treatment and cure of this 
disease with the establishment of agencies for the promo- 
tion of public sanitation and the spread of the knowledge 
of scientific medicine; and to this end, be it 
Resolved, that this work be entrusted to a special com- 
mittee to be called the International Health Commission, 
consisting of the members for the time being of the 
Executive Committee of this Foundation and such other 
persons, members of the Foundation or otherwise, as they 
may associate with themselves; and be it further 
Resolved, that the International Health Commission be 
authorized to adopt such policies and to employ such 
agencies as it may deem best adapted for the conduct of 
the work, and also to adopt rules and regulations for its
-P-A-G-E-13
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 13 
own government and for the expenditure of such funds as 
shall be placed at its disposal; and 
Resolved, that at each annual meeting of the Foundation, 
the International Health Commission shall report to the 
Foundation in detail its operations and expenditures, and 
shall present for approval its budget for the following year. 
Mr. Wickliffe Rose, Administrative Secretary 
of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the 
Eradication of Hookworm Disease, was ap- 
pointed Director-General of the International 
Health Commission, and Dr. John A. Ferrell was 
appointed Assistant Director-General, the Presi- 
dent and the Secretary of the Foundation 
serving ex officio as Chairman and Recording 
Secretary respectively. The offices of the 
Commission were located at Washington, D. C., 
with the offices of the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission. A full report of the operations of 
the International Health Commission from the 
time of its establishment to December 13, 1914, 
is issued as a separate document. It discloses 
remarkable progress toward the fulfilment of the 
immediate object of the Commission, namely 
the initiation of measures for the eradication of 
hookworm disease in foreign countries. A visit 
by the Director-General to England in the 
summer of 1913 resulted in a cordial invitation 
from the Colonial authorities to visit the tropical 
colonies of Great Britain, with a view to the 
inauguration of the work under the auspices of 
the several local governments. Mr. Rose
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
promptly responded to this invitation by visits 
to the British West Indies, Egypt, Ceylon and 
the Malay States. As a direct consequence of 
these visits and of the hospitable reception given 
to the Commission’s offer of cooperation, plans 
were adopted and work begun in British Guiana, 
Antigua, Trinidad, St. Lucia, Grenada and 
Egypt. A plan of work was adopted for St. 
Vincent, but was deferred on account of the war. 
In Ceylon the Government and the Planters’ 
Association inaugurated an experimental demon- 
stration on a small scale, in accordance with the 
suggestions of Mr. Rose, the entire cost being 
met locally. In the Malay States the consensus 
of opinion favored the establishment of a com- 
mission to inquire into the relative importance 
of hookworm disease and malaria in accounting 
for the physical debility of the people, and since 
the period under review a special commission has 
been appointed to make a study of this problem. 
In addition to the work undertaken in the 
British colonies, the Commission has responded 
favorably to invitations from several Central 
American countries, and work has been inaugu- 
rated in Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and 
Guatemala. 
In spite of the fact that a large amount of 
time has necessarily been given to preliminary 
conferences, surveys and the work of organiza- 
tion, a very substantial achievement has already 
been made, 37,902 persons having been examined,
-P-A-G-E-15
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 15 
and 19,425 persons treated in all the foreign 
areas, up to December 31, 1914. But more 
significant than the number of persons treated 
has been the establishment of relations of co- 
operation and mutual confidence between the 
Commission and the governments and physicians 
of the communities visited, and the resulting 
stimulation of interest on the part of the common 
people, whereby the principle of self-help has 
been steadily maintained. 
In addition to carrying on its work in foreign 
countries, the International Health Commission 
has also undertaken to complete the program of 
the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the 
eradication of hookworm disease in the Southern 
states. This program did not contemplate com- 
plete eradication under the supervision of the 
Sanitary Commission, but aimed rather at a 
comprehensive demonstration in each state, first 
of the presence of the disease, and secondly of 
the method of treating and preventing it. This 
demonstration is now entering its final stage with 
the inauguration of the so-called intensive com- 
munity work whereby, in a limited number of 
typical communities in each state, it is hoped to 
show convincingly the possibility of treating 
every infected person, and at the same time of 
preventing soil pollution—the only way of pre- 
venting the recurrence of the disease. 
Just before the close of the year under review, 
it was decided that on account of the very close  
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
relation necessarily existing between the various 
activities of the Foundation, and especially in 
view of the relatively large share of attention 
already given by the Foundation to matters 
pertaining to public health, it was important 
that the offices of the International Health 
Commission should be in close proximity to 
those of the Foundation. Accordingly, arrange- 
ments were made whereby the International 
Health Commission will, before May 1, 1915, 
give up its offices in Washington and occupy 
quarters assigned to it in the new offices of the 
Foundation. 
INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
At some of the earlier meetings of the Founda- 
tion there was informal discussion of the 
desirability of establishing some organization for 
the study of social and economic questions. A 
number of leading economists were consulted and 
upon their unanimously favoring the establish- 
ment of such an organization, a committee was 
appointed, consisting of Professor Edwin F. Gay, 
Dean of the Graduate School of Business Admin- 
istration in Harvard University, Chairman; Pro- 
fessor J. Laurence Laughlin, of the University of 
Chicago; Professor Thomas W. Page, of the 
University of Virginia; Mr. Victor Morawetz, 
of New York City; and Mr. Harry A. Wheeler, 
of Chicago, “to consider further the desirability 
of establishing an Institute for Economic Re- 
   
-P-A-G-E-17
  INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 17 
search, to make a selection of such problems of 
economic importance as would in their judgment 
be advantageously studied through such an 
agency, to recommend a method of organization, 
and to present an estimate of the approximate 
cost of initiating and carrying on the work to 
be first proposed.” This Committee reported, 
under date of August 4, 1914, unanimously 
recommending that studies be initiated and be 
carried on for a year in some chosen field, with 
a view to discovering whether such studies, if 
continued and adequately maintained, would 
offer a sufficient prospect of fruitful results to 
justify the establishment of a more permanent 
bureau or institute. Four of the Committee 
recommended the subject of Prices as lying at 
the threshold of a great manyimportant economic 
problems, while the fifth recommended a more 
limited and concrete problem, such as Profit- 
sharing. This report was considered by the 
Trustees of the Foundation on October 21, 1914. 
After a discussion in which the advantages of a 
separate organization for economic research and 
the possible objections thereto were considered 
at length, the opinion prevailed that no action 
should be taken at present, especially in view of 
the fact that since the question of establishing 
an Institute for Economic Research had been 
under consideration, an Investigation of Indus- 
trial Relations had been instituted under the 
direction of Mr. W. L. Mackenzie King.
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The two projects were by no means identical 
in method or scope, but both were actuated by 
the desire to study the causes of social and 
industrial unrest. It seemed to the Trustees, 
especially in view of the industrial conflict in 
Colorado, that the Foundation could do no 
greater service than by instituting a careful 
and thorough inquiry into the causes of industrial 
unrest and maladjustment, with the object, not 
of passing judgment upon the merits of any 
particular controversy, but rather of assembling 
in a purely objective way, and with scientific 
accuracy, the experience of this and other coun- 
tries, as illustrating both the evils inherent in 
modern industrial conditions, and the successful 
or promising experiments that had been made. 
The Trustees of the Foundation were not so 
sanguine as to hope that any royal road to in- 
dustrial peace could be found, much less that it 
could be found by the isolated efforts of any one 
agency. They did believe, however, that if pro- 
gress was to be made, it must inevitably be on 
the basis of accurate and well-diffused informa- 
tion in regard to all ascertainable factors in 
industrial strife and industrial progress. As was 
said in the public announcement of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation’s Investigation of Industrial 
Relations: 
“In facing the problem of Industrial Relations, 
the Rockefeller Foundation is deliberately attempt- 
ing to grapple with what it believes to be the most
-P-A-G-E-19
INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 19 
complicated, and, at the same time, the most urgent 
question of modern times, and it is precisely for this 
reason that the investigation has been instituted. 
The Foundation is not baffled at the outset by the 
knowledge that the task hitherto has seemed well 
nigh hopeless, and that the literature on the 
subject, and the tried experience of the world, is 
so vast as to be overwhelming. These may be 
reasons for a gradual approach, and for counselling 
patience in the matter of results, but they afford no 
excuse for inaction. It is hoped that an investiga- 
tion instituted on the scale, and impartially and 
persistently pursued in the spirit and with the 
facilities which the Foundation affords, will 
gradually win for itself the cooperation, not alone 
of employers and workingmen, of industrial organi- 
zations, of individuals, and institutions interested 
in social reform, but also of universities and 
Governments throughout the world.’’ 
The first essential in undertaking any research 
is to find men whose training and experience is 
such as to offer the greatest possible assurance of 
productive work. Within the field of industrial 
relations Mr. W. L. Mackenzie King seemed to 
be singularly qualified by academic training, by 
actual contact with labor disputes, and by his 
own constructive contribution to the betterment 
of labor conditions, to undertake this great task. 
Mr. King was the author of the Canadian Indus- 
trial Disputes Investigation Act, and as Deputy 
Minister and Minister of Labor in Canada, he 
had had a large experience in the settlement of 
industrial disputes, both before and after the 
passage of that Act. 
Mr. King began his services on October 1, 
1914, and has been devoting his first months to
-P-A-G-E-20
20 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
a careful study of the best possible approach to 
his subject. This study has included a broad 
survey of the whole field of industrial relations, 
a field so wide as to touch at one point or another 
almost all conceivable human relations. It is 
Mr. King’s hope that when he has completed his 
survey and prepared a graphic exhibition of 
his field of study, he will be able, in consultation 
with the best authorities throughout the world 
and in cooperation with established agencies 
working toward the same end, to select certain 
lines of inquiry in which a better knowledge of 
facts is peculiarly needed, and in which may be 
found the best prospect of fruitful and beneficial 
study leading to constructive improvement. 
The announcement by the Foundation that it 
had undertaken the Investigation of Industrial 
Relations was made the subject of special 
inquiry by the United States Commission on 
Industrial Relations, which was then in session. 
A large number of questions were addressed by 
the Commission to the President and the Secre- 
tary of the Rockefeller Foundation, in November 
and December, 1914, covering the history, organ- 
ization, financial resources and activities of the 
Foundation and its Trustees. The greater part 
of the questions asked were embodied in two 
questionnaires, the answers to which, with 
accompanying exhibits, were published by the 
Foundation and presented to the Commission, 
in the form of a pamphlet entitled: “Information
-P-A-G-E-21
  MENTAL HYGIENE 21 
Furnished by the Rockefeller Foundation in 
Response to Questionnaires Submitted by United 
States Commission on Industrial Relations.” 
Other questions were asked and answered by 
correspondence, and during the month of January 
the Commission held public hearings in New 
York City, to which several of the officers and 
members of the Foundation were summoned as 
witnesses. As the testimony presented at these 
hearings will be embodied in the report of the 
Commission, it will not be set forth here, but 
it is proper to state that while much attention 
was given by the questions of the Commission to 
certain doubts and fears as to the powers of large 
foundations, it was apparent that supposed dan- 
gers of abuse rather than results or tendencies to 
be found in the acts of the Foundation and its 
associated Boards seemed to be the object of chief 
concern. The Foundation on its side was enabled 
to put before the Commission and the public a 
plain statement of the policies governing the 
Foundation and the work actually accomplished, 
and it is to be hoped that these statements pro- 
vided an even more certain basis than had existed 
before, for the confidence and support of public 
opinion. 
MENTAL HYGIENE 
One of the important subjects considered by 
the Trustees, within the general field of public 
health, has been that of mental hygiene. It 
has been established beyond any doubt that  
-P-A-G-E-22
22 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
mental defect and mental disease are factors 
of great social and economic importance. The 
recognition of this fact has been a great gain. On 
the other hand, when attempts have been made 
to determine the precise bearing of these factors 
on the public health and on social and economic 
conditions, there has been a tendency to adopt 
hasty conclusions as to public policy, which 
conclusions could be justified only by a more 
accurate knowledge of pathology and of vital 
statistics than even the best authorities now 
possess. The Trustees of the Foundation con- 
sequently decided to give attention to the 
subject of mental hygiene, in the hope of 
determining in what ways they could best 
contribute to the discovery of needed facts and 
to the diffusion of the most reliable information 
by which this important field of public health 
is to be governed. Accordingly, proceeding 
again as in the case of the Investigation of 
Industrial Relations, they sought a man whose 
training and experience conspicuously fitted him 
to be their adviser in this important field. They 
were fortunate in securing Dr. Thomas W. 
Salmon, of the United States Public Health 
Service, who had been detached from the 
government service for the last two years to 
act as Scientific Secretary of the National 
Committee for Mental Hygiene. That Com- 
mittee had already performed a remarkable 
service in awakening public opinion in different 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
WAR RELIEF 23 
parts of the country to the importance of mental 
hygiene and in setting up, on the basis of existing 
information, more intelligent and humane stand- 
ards for legislation bearing on the commitment, 
custody and treatment of the insane. The 
Committee has already conducted or aided a 
number of surveys of institutions for the insane 
in different States and communities, the result 
of which has been the diffusion of more rational 
ideas as to the nature of insanity as a disease 
that is to a large extent both preventable and 
curable, and in many instances the adoption of 
more humane and beneficial methods of treat- 
ment. It seemed to the Trustees of the Founda- 
tion that at this time no greater service could 
be rendered, within the field of mental hygiene, 
than to aid the activities of the Committee for 
Mental Hygiene, under the direction of Dr. 
Salmon. Accordingly, on December 30, 1914, 
Dr. Salmon was appointed a member of the 
staff of the Foundation, with the understanding 
that his services for the next two years would 
be at the disposal of the National Committee for 
Mental Hygiene, and primarily for the promotion 
of State surveys. 
WAR RELIEF 
At the meetings of the Executive Committee 
and of the Trustees of the Foundation following 
the outbreak of the war, the duty of the Founda- 
tion, in the face of the disaster which was

less paralyzing effect upon the normal life and 
intercourse of all nations, was made the subject 
of earnest and prolonged consideration. On 
August 13, 1914, an appropriation was made to 
enable Dr. Alexis Carrel, a member of the 
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, 
whose services had been accepted by the medical 
corps of the French army, to meet the urgent 
need for anti-meningitis serum and anti-dysen- 
tery serum, two products of modern research 
with which the studies of the Institute had been 
associated. An appropriation was also made to 
the American Red Cross as a contribution 
toward the cost of sending physicians and nurses 
to Europe. At the meeting of the Trustees on 
October 21, resolutions were adopted expressing 
the sense of the Board that it was urgently 
desirable that the Rockefeller Foundation should 
avail itself of such opportunities as might be 
presented for therelief of non-combatant sufferers 
from the war in Europe, and especially the 
inhabitants of Belgium. The matter was 
referred to the Executive Committee, and the 
latter took immediate steps to discover the most 
practicable measures for bringing prompt relief, 
in a purely humanitarian spirit, to the places 
where it was most needed. The world had 
already been informed of the imminent danger 
of starvation to which the people of Belgium 
were exposed; and in all parts of the United
-P-A-G-E-25
WAR RELIEF 25 
States the generous desires of the American 
people found expression in offers of help and 
inquiries as to the best ways of making their 
help available. The Commission for Relief in 
Belgium, an outgrowth of an informal committee 
of Americans, which had been organized to facili- 
tate the return of American travelers in Europe at 
the outbreak of the war, had laid the foundations 
for an efficient organization, whereby food sup- 
plies contributed from different parts of the world 
could be assembled at Rotterdam, the most 
convenient port, and then distributed through 
Belgium with the sanction of the belligerent 
powers and the active cooperation of both the 
German military authorities and the civilian 
agencies organized for that purpose by the 
Belgians themselves. The Commission for 
Relief in Belgium had not at that time completed 
its organization of an agency in the United States 
for the assembling of food supplies and their 
transportation to Belgium. For this reason it 
seemed to the Executive Committee that the 
greatest service the Rockefeller Foundation 
could render would be to provide a depot to 
which gifts in kind from all parts of the country 
could be sent, and from which they could be 
trans-shipped to Belgium. Accordingly, a plan 
of cooperation was entered into with the Belgian 
Relief Committee of New York, whereby the 
latter Committee exercised the function of 
soliciting gifts of money and supplies, while the
-P-A-G-E-26
26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Foundation offered to pay all freight charges 
when necessary, to provide the necessary depot 
in New York and the ships for ocean trans- 
portation to Belgium, this offer being limited 
to supplies received before December 31, 1914. 
Under this arrangement the following ships 
were chartered and dispatched by the Rocke- 
feller Foundation and consigned to the Commis- 
sion for Relief in Belgium: the “ Massapequa,” 
3,500 tons, November 2; the “Agamemnon,” 
2,800 tons, December 4; the “Neches,” 5,830 
tons, December 12; and the “ Massapequa” for a 
second voyage, December 31. Of these ships the 
“Massapequa” and the “Neches” were loaded 
with a cargo purchased by the Foundation, while 
the Belgian Relief Committee of New York 
supplied the cargo for the “Agamemnon” and 
the second voyage of the “Massapequa.” In 
addition, the Foundation supplied 280,000 
bushels of wheat for the “Ferrona,” chartered 
by the Commission for Relief in Belgium and 
dispatched December 23, and 23,644 bushels on 
the S.S. “Industry,” dispatched January 1, also 
chartered by the Commission for Relief in 
Belgium. The total cost of the food supplies 
thus given by the Foundation was $981,153.35. 
The Commission for Relief in Belgium having 
large funds at its disposal which were applicable 
solely to the cost of transportation, the Founda- 
tion was subsequently reimbursed for the cost of 
chartering and loading vessels, so that its re-
-P-A-G-E-27
WAR RELIEF 27 
sources for war relief could be available for 
supplies. A table giving the dates of shipments, 
cargoes, the cost of cargoes so far as met by the 
Foundation, and other expenses, will be found in 
the Appendix (page 214). Evidence that the 
effect of the Rockefeller Foundation’s large 
participation in the sending of food to the 
Belgians was to stimulate rather than to check 
the generosity of other donors was afforded 
by the large increase in contributions received 
by the Belgian Relief Committee of New 
York. During December the Commission for 
Relief in Belgium completed the organization 
of its American branch, with head offices in 
New York City, so that the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion very gladly relinquished in favor of the 
Commission the function of chartering ships 
and attending to the details of transportation. 
For the purpose of attending to these details, 
a temporary office was opened by the Founda- 
tion, on November 6, at No. 10 Bridge Street, 
in proximity to the office of the Belgian Relief 
Committee, and was maintained there until 
February 6, when its services were no longer 
required. 
Meanwhile the Executive Committee, while 
feeling amply justified by the information avail- 
able in sending food to Belgium at the earliest 
possible moment, determined to send a Com- 
mission to Europe to inquire generally into the 
need of relief measures in all the countries con-  
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
cerned. The Commission was composed of 
Mr. Wickliffe Rose, Director-General of the 
International Health Commission; Mr. Ernest 
P. Bicknell, National Director of the American 
Red Cross, who was generously given leave of 
absence by the latter organization, and Mr. 
Henry James, Jr., Manager of the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research. The Commis- 
sion sailed for Europe on November 11, and 
after a preliminary conference with the American 
Ambassador and the Commission for Relief in 
Belgium at the latter’s headquarters in London, 
they proceeded to Rotterdam and made a 
thorough survey of the organization and work- 
ings of relief in Holland and Belgium. On 
January 1, 1915, a full report on relief in Belgium 
was transmitted to the Foundation, and its 
essential features were made public. In general 
the report showed that nearly the entire popula- 
tion of Belgium, rich and poor alike, were depend- 
ent upon supplies of food from other countries, 
that the problem of individual relief, upon a 
scale unprecedented in the history of humani- 
tarian efforts of this kind, was being attacked 
with energy, public spirit and intelligence by 
those concerned, so that all who were contribut- 
ing in the United States and other countries 
for the relief of the Belgians could be assured 
that their contributions were being economically 
and effectively spent for the relief of a people 
who would otherwise have been forced to the
-P-A-G-E-29
  COOPERATION IN CHRISTIAN MISSIONS 29 
most desperate extremes of famine. The Com- 
mission is continuing its work by visiting the 
theatre of war in Poland and Serbia, and its 
recommendations as to the further participation 
of the Foundation in war relief have been pre- 
sented for the consideration of the Trustees. 
A smaller contribution than that involved in 
the shipment of food supplies and the investiga- 
tions of the War Relief Commission, but one of 
special significance, in view of the importance 
attached to education and research by the 
Boards established by Mr. John D. Rockefeller, 
was a contribution to provide moderate stipends 
for those professors of scientific subjects in the 
University of Louvain who had been obliged to 
abandon their own laboratories and had been 
provided with opportunities of continuing their 
scientific work in England. An appropriation 
at the rate of $20,000 a year was made effective 
for this purpose in November, for a period 
of three months, and has subsequently been 
renewed for a second period of three months. 
PROMOTION OF COOPERATION IN 
CHRISTIAN MISSIONS 
At the meeting of the Executive Committee 
on April 16, 1914, there was presented through 
Mr. John R. Mott of the International Com- 
mittee of the Young Men’s Christian Association, 
on behalf of representatives of several of the 
leading foreign missionary boards of the United 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
en ee nee nn mee kn eee ee 
30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
States a statement setting forth in detail a 
program of cooperation and coordination in 
foreign missionary work, and requesting the 
Rockefeller Foundation to make a contribution 
toward the carrying out of this program. The 
principal objects in view were the provision of a 
common headquarters in New York for such 
united foreign missionary interests as the Com- 
mittee of Reference and Counsel of the Foreign 
Mission Boards of North America, the Home 
Base Committee, the special meetings, and other 
activities related to the Annual Conference of 
North American Foreign Mission Boards;. the 
North American section of the Continuation 
Committee of the Edinburgh Conference and 
its special committees, such as those on 
Survey and Occupation, Education, The Church 
on the Mission Field, the Board of Missionary 
Preparation; the Student Volunteer movement 
as the recruiting society for all the Boards; a 
comprehensive missionary research library, and 
the general promotion of coordination and 
cooperation among the missionary forces of the 
world. The Rockefeller Foundation was not 
asked to enlarge the resources of any one of the 
| participating missionary boards for its own 
, evangelistic work, but rather, by helping to 
establish a convenient headquarters, through 
which many of the cooperative activities of these 
boards could be promoted, and by otherwise aid- 
ing in certain cooperative features of their work,
-P-A-G-E-31
  MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 31 
such as the coordination of educational effort 
in the foreign field, and the training of mis- 
sionaries at home, to give assistance to the 
missionary boards in an effort, initiated by 
themselves, to realize a broader, a more fraternal 
and a more efficient conception of their function. 
In response to this application the Rockefeller 
Foundation pledged to the Committee of Refer- 
ence and Council a sum not exceeding $25,000 
to meet the expense of equipping suitable 
offices for the various interboard and inter- 
denominational foreign missionary activities 
above mentioned, and a further appropriation 
of a sum not to exceed $425,000, payable in 
diminishing annual instalments through a period 
of ten years. ‘The nineteenth floor of the 
building at No. 25 Madison Avenue was secured 
as headquarters for the work and was thoroughly 
equipped during the past year. The use actually 
made of these quarters, as reported by the 
Sub-Committee on Headquarters and Budget of 
the Committee of Reference and Counsel, gives 
every indication that the purposes in view are 
being fulfilled. 
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 
During the autumn and winter of 1913 the 
Trustees became convinced that the crisis in 
the political and economic development of 
China rendered the present a most favorable 
time for the advancement of education in that
-P-A-G-E-32
  
32 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
country. There was abundant testimony, based 
chiefly upon the experience of Christian mis- 
sionaries, that one of the greatest needs of China 
was that of the benefits of modern medicine, 
including public and personal hygiene, as well 
as the treatment of disease. In order that the 
Trustees might be guided by the best available 
advice, a conference was held in New York City, 
on January 19, 1914, to which a number of the 
executive officers of the principal missionary 
boards employing medical missionaries, and 
several medical missionaries and other residents 
of China who happened to be in this country, 
were invited. The result of that conference 
was that the Trustees determined to send a 
Commission to China to study the needs of the 
country in regard to medical education and 
public health.* In February, 1914, the following 
Commission was appointed: Harry Pratt Judson, 
President of the University of Chicago, Chair- 
man; Roger S. Greene, United States Consul 
General at Hankow, and Francis W. Peabody, 
M. D., of the Harvard Medical School and the 
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital of Boston. 
The Commission met in Peking about May 1, 
1914, and spent four months in a very thorough 
study of existing medical schools, hospitals and 
dispensaries in China, and in conference with 
missionaries, Government officials and other 
competent advisers, in regard to the best means 
of reinforcing and adding to the important work 
*See Appendix VII, page 208.  
-P-A-G-E-33
  
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 33 
already done in the field of medical education 
and public health. A fifth month was devoted 
to the preparation of an elaborate report of the 
observations, findings and recommendations of 
the Commission, and its report was presented to 
the Trustees at their meeting of October 21, 
1914. An adjourned meeting was held Novem- 
ber 5, 1914, for the purpose of considering the 
report in detail. The result of this consideration 
was the establishment of the China Medical 
Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, for the 
purpose of carrying out the recommendations of 
the Commission, which were formally adopted 
as a working program, subject to such modifica- 
tion as experience should show to be necessary. 
Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Executive Secretary of 
the General Education Board, was appointed 
Director of the China Medical Board, and Mr. 
Roger S. Greene was appointed Resident Director 
in China. The President of the Foundation was 
elected Chairman of the Board, and Dr. Eben C. 
Sage Secretary. During the short period follow- 
ing the establishment of the China Medical 
Board, its officers have been engaged in pre- 
liminary conferences looking toward the initia- 
tion of its work in China on the basis of the 
fullest possible utilization of existing institu- 
tions and equipment, and of the most cordial 
cooperation with the missionary boards and 
other agencies which have already carried on 
medical work in China.

GENERAL SUMMARY 
The International Health Commission was 
created June 27, 1913, by the Rockefeller Foun- 
dation. Its object is the “promotion of public 
sanitation and the spread of the knowledge of 
-. scientific medicine,” with the world as its field. 
Funds for its maintenance are provided by the 
Rockefeller Foundation, a permanent institution, 
endowed by Mr. John D. Rockefeller with one 
hundred million dollars, and chartered by the 
State of New York, U. S. A. The Executive 
Committee of the Foundation, composed of five 
men, residents of New York City, are members 
of the Commission ex officio. The Foundation, 
in creating the Commission, adopted the follow- 
ing resolution: 
WHEREAS, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commis- 
sion, organized in 1909 for the eradication of hook- 
worm disease in the United States, has found more 
than two million people in the Southern States to 
be infected with the disease, involving vast suffer- 
ing, partial arrest of physical, mental and moral 
growth, great loss of life, and noticeable decrease 
in economic efficiency over vast regions; and 
WHEREAS, the Commission has treated or 
caused to be treated more than five hundred 
thousand persons; has ascertained that the diagnosis 
of the disease can be made with ease and certainty 
and that it can be readily cured and easily pre- 
37
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
vented; has found that the people, physicians, 
state boards of health, county and municipal 
officers are eager to codperate in all helpful ways, 
and that, following the treatment and cure of this 
disease, an intelligent public interest is awakened 
in hygiene and in modern scientific medicine and 
in practical measures for permanent public sanita- 
tion; and 
WHEREAS, the Commission has ascertained 
by diligent and extensive inquiry that hookworm 
disease prevails in a belt of territory encircling 
the earth for thirty degrees on each side of the 
equator, inhabited, according to current estimates, 
by more than a thousand million people; that the 
infection in some nations rises to nearly ninety per 
cent of the entire population; that this disease has 
probably been an important factor in retarding the 
economic, social, intellectual and moral progress of 
mankind; that the infection is being spread by emi- 
gration; and that where it is most severe little or 
nothing is being done toward its arrest or preven- 
tion; therefore be it 
RESOLVED, that this Foundation is prepared 
to extend to other countries and peoples the work 
of eradicating hookworm disease as opportunity 
offers, and so far as practicable to follow up the 
treatment and cure of this disease with the estab- 
lishment of agencies for the promotion of public 
sanitation and the spread of the knowledge of 
scientific medicine; and to this end be it 
RESOLVED, that this work be entrusted to a 
special committee to be called the International 
Health Commission, consisting of the members 
for the time being of the Executive Committee of 
this Foundation and such other persons, members 
of the Foundation or otherwise, as they may asso- 
ciate with themselves, and be it further
-P-A-G-E-39
GENERAL SUMMARY 39 
RESOLVED, that the International Health 
Commission be authorized to adopt such policies 
and to employ such agencies as it may deem best 
adapted for the conduct of the work, and also to 
adopt rules and regulations for its own government 
and for the expenditure of such funds as shall be 
placed at its disposal; and 
RESOLVED, that at each annual meeting of 
the Foundation, the International Health Com- 
mission shall report to the Foundation in detail 
its operations and expenditures, and shall present 
for approval its budget for the following year. 
Pursuant to this resolution, the following 
persons were made members of the International 
Health Commission: John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 
Jerome D. Greene, Wickliffe Rose, Charles W. 
Eliot, Simon Flexner, Frederick T. Gates, 
William C. Gorgas, Charles O. Heydt, David F. 
Houston, Starr J. Murphy, Walter H. Page, and 
William H. Welch. Officers of the Commission 
were elected as follows: John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 
Chairman; Jerome D. Greene, Recording Sec- 
retary; Wickliffe Rose, Director-General. John 
A. Ferrell, M. D., was appointed Assistant 
Director-General, his term of service to begin 
July 1, 1913. The Commission opened offices in 
Washington, D. C., in connection with the offices 
of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, and 
the work of preliminary organization began.

I 
WHAT THE COMMISSION HAS UNDERTAKEN 
TO DO 
The resolution creating the Commission as- 
signed to it two tasks: (1) ‘‘to extend to other 
countries the work of eradicating hookworm 
disease as opportunity should offer”; and (2) “so 
far as practicable to follow up the treatment and 
cure of this disease with the establishment of 
agencies for the promotion of public sanitation 
and the spread of the knowledge of scientific 
medicine.” In keeping with this definition of 
purpose the Commission has directed its initial 
efforts to the first and more immediate task of 
extending to foreign countries work for the relief 
and control of uncinariasis or hookworm disease. 
The relief and control of this one disease is an 
undertaking of enormous magnitude. The in- 
fection belts the globe in a zone about 66° wide, 
extending roughly from parallel 36° north tc 
parallel 30°south. Practicallyall countries withi. 
this zone are infected. Of the 1,600,000,000 
people inhabiting the globe, about 900,000,000 
live in countries where the infection is prevalent.* 
In many countries infection is extremely 
prevalent. Of 548,992 rural children micro- 
scopically examined in the Southern states, 39 
per cent were found to be infected. Reports 
received by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission 
*See Publication No. 6, of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, 
“Hookworm Infection in Foreign Countries,” pages 3 and following.
-P-A-G-E-41
  GENERAL SUMMARY 41 
in 1911, and summarized in its Publication No. 
6, estimate: that of the population of Colombia 
living between sea level and 3,000 feet above, 
go per cent are infected; that of the population 
of British Guiana, 50 per cent are infected, the 
infection among the coolies on sugar estates 
being even greater; that in Dutch Guiana the 
infection on many plantations runs as high as 
go per cent; that in Egypt the infection of 
the laboring population is approximately 50 
per cent; that 50 per cent of the Indian coolies 
on sugar and tea estates in Natal are infected; 
that on many plantations in Ceylon the infection 
runs as high as go per cent; that there is an 
extremely heavy infection in some parts of 
India and among the coolies on many estates in 
Malaya and Fiji which import their labor from 
India; that the southern two-thirds of the 
Chinese Empire is involved, the infection in 
many parts of the Yangtse Valley running as 
high as 70 to 76 per cent among the farming 
population. 
The relief and control of the disease in a given 
country involves: (1) making a survey to deter- 
mine the geographic distribution and the ap- 
proximate degree of infection; (2) microscopically 
examining the people and curing those who are 
found infected; and (3) setting in operation and 
making effective such sanitary measures as will 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    
42 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
put a stop to soil-pollution. Dr. Howard’s report 
of the work being done in British Guiana* gives 
a definite conception of what is required for the 
relief and control of the disease in a small area. 
With this in mind one may get some comprehen- 
sion of what is involved in an effort to extend 
this work to the whole infected zone, with its 
900,000,000 people. 
The International Health Commission has not 
undertaken to eradicate uncinariasis in any 
country. The accomplishment of this result will 
require the operation of permanent agencies 
working over long periods of time. The attitude 
assumed by the International Health Commis- 
sion toward this work is that assumed by the 
Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in its co- 
6peration with the Southern States, namely: that 
the bringing of this disease under control in any 
country is a work which no outside agency 
working independently could do if it would, and 
one which no outside agency should do if it 
could; that if the infection is to be stamped out 
in any area the country in which it exists must 
assume the responsibility; and that the Com- 
mission may be of service in so far as it may 
codperate with the Governments of foreign 
countries in organizing and making effective 
their own agencies. In this spirit the Com- 
mission has accepted the invitation of eleven

and Administrative Measures as Illustrated by the Campaign in British 
Guiana.”

foreign countries during the current year to 
cooperate in the relief and control of this disease. 
It is prepared to extend this codperation to other 
countries as conditions invite. 
II 
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS 
AND CONFERENCES 
At the first meeting of the International Health 
Commission, June 27, 1913, the Director-General 
was authorized to go in person or to send a 
representative to British dependencies and to 
Latin-American countries for the purpose of pre- 
liminary investigation and conference. Travel 
on these missions consumed most of the time of 
the Director-General during the first twelve 
months of the Commission’s existence. Three 
such journeys were made: (1) to England; (2) 
to the British West Indies; and (3) to Egypt 
and British dependencies in the Far East. Dr. 
J. H. White, of the United States Public Health 
Service, represented the Commission on similar 
journeys to countries in Central America. 
1. To England:—The Commission’s first step 
in the direction of codperation with foreign 
countries was a visit to England for conference 
with British medical authorities and the British 
Government. This visit had been arranged by 
the American Ambassador in London, Mr. 
Walter H. Page, himself a member of the Inter-
-P-A-G-E-44
44 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
national Health Commission and keenly inter- 
ested in what it was proposing to do. The 
Director-General arrived in London on August 
10, 1913. A series of conferences followed, the 
most important of which was at a dinner given 
by Mr. Page, on August 13, at the Marlborough 
Club. Among those present were Lord Crewe, 
Secretary of State for India; the Right Honorable 
Lewis Harcourt, Secretary of State for the 
Colonies; and a group of scientists, physicians, 
and government officials whose advice and sug- 
gestions were of great value. 
The Director-General exhibited by means of 
lantern-slides the work which had been done by 
the codperation of the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission with the Southern States for the 
relief and control of hookworm disease; described 
in detail the methods by which the results ex- 
hibited had been accomplished; and explained 
that the International Health Commission is 
prepared to extend the work to other countries 
where the infection is prevalent and where con- 
ditions seem to invite such extension. Dr. 
Sandwith told of his experience with uncinariasis 
in Egypt, where more than 50 per cent of the 
working population of the Delta are infected. 
Dr. Balfour described conditions as he had seen 
them in the Soudan; Dr. Godfrey, Surgeon- 
General of British Guiana, told of the bringing
-P-A-G-E-45
  
GENERAL SUMMARY 45 
of a heavy infection to the sugar estates of that 
country by the importation of coolie laborers 
from India; Dr. Shipley, Sir Thomas Robinson, 
Sir Thomas Barlow, and others contributed 
details bearing on sanitary requirements or 
picturing conditions in India, Ceylon, the Malay 
States, Australia, and the Fiji Islands. Finally, 
Mr. Harcourt, after speaking in most generous 
terms of the work done in the States, gave the 
Commission an urgent invitation to visit the 
Colonies, offering all the facilities of his office, 
and assuring the Commission of the hearty co- 
Gperation of the local governments. Lord Crewe 
spoke in similar spirit for India. 
It remained only to work out details. As a 
result of a series of conferences held at the 
Colonial Office it was agreed that there should 
be an English Advisory Committee, with head- 
quarters at the Colonial Office, in London. The 
Secretary of State for the Colonies addressed a 
communication to the British Colonies endorsing 
the Commission and its work and accrediting 
its representatives to the Governments of those 
countries. It was agreed that the Commission’s 
first work in foreign countries should be in the 
British West Indies. The following consented 
to serve as members of the English Advisory 
Committee:

2. To the British West Indies:—During the 
months of October, November, and December, 
1913, the Director-General made a journey to 
the British West Indies, visiting Barbados, 
Trinidad, British Guiana, Grenada, St. Vincent, 
St. Lucia, and Antigua. The purpose of this 
journey was to make a preliminary investigation 
of the conditions of infection, to study the local 
conditions bearing on the problem of relief and 
control, and to discuss with physicians and 
government authorities working plans for the 
extension of the service to the colonies in which 
the infection was found to be prevalent and in 
which conditions seemed to favor codperation 
for its relief and control. In each of the coun-  
-P-A-G-E-47
GENERAL SUMMARY 47 
tries visited the Commission’s representative was 
received most cordially and was given every 
facility for carrying out the purpose of his 
mission. He made extensive journeys over the 
Islands, visited hospitals, and made clinical exam- 
ination of the inmates of prisons, poor-houses, and 
asylums for the insane. He inspected children 
in the schools, and examined large numbers of 
coolies on estates. Of the seven colonies visited 
uncinariasis was found to be prevalent in six, and 
tentative plans were agreed upon providing for 
the extension of the service to each of these in- 
fected countries. 
3. Tothe East:—In March, 1914, the Director- 
General sailed again for England on his way to 
the East. After conference with the English 
Advisory Committee in London, he proceeded 
to Egypt, Ceylon, and the Federated Malay 
States, returning to the United States by way of 
the Philippines and Japan. By invitation of 
the Commission, Dr. F. M. Sandwith, of the 
London School of Tropical Medicine, accom- 
panied him on his journey as far as Ceylon. 
In Egypt the Commission’s representatives 
were given a most cordial reception. Lord 
Kitchener, the British High Commissioner, was 
making public health the chief feature of his 
administration and was centering attention 
especially on Egypt’s four endemic scourges:—
-P-A-G-E-48
48 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
uncinariasis, bilharziasis, pellagra, and ophthal- 
mia. He expressed himself as eager to have the 
coéperation of the Commission; and gave assur- 
ances that any effective plan for the improvement 
of health conditions in Egypt would have the 
active support of the Government. Three weeks 
of observation in Egyptian hospitals and in the 
field tended to confirm the estimate that more 
than half the farming population of the Delta 
harbor Uncinaria. At the Church Mission hos- 
pital, in Cairo, about 600 patients from all parts 
of Egypt were seen under treatment for unci- 
nariasis at one time (See Fig. 17). Many of 
these were extremely severe cases. A working 
plan providing for the codperation of the Com- 
mission and the Government in making a 
demonstration in one province was formulated 
and adopted. 
In Ceylon the Government, the Department of 
Health, and the Planters’ Association united 
in extending every facility for the observation 
of conditions in that Island. The Commission’s 
representatives made journeys afield covering a 
large portion of the infected area. They visited 
hospitals, made clinical examination of large 
numbers of coolies on tea and rubber estates, 
inspected children in the schools, and conferred 
with physicians, planters, and estate managers 
in both the up-country and the low-country
-P-A-G-E-49
GENERAL SUMMARY 49 
sections of the infected area. Some microscopic 
examinations were made at the Ratnapura 
Hospital to check the results of clinical diagnosis. 
There can be no mistaking the prevalence and 
the disabling effects of uncinariasis in Ceylon. 
On many rubber estates in the low-country 
districts local physicians have estimated that 
go per cent of the coolies are infected; and this 
estimate would seem to be not excessive. The 
laborers on these estates are Tamils brought 
over from India, and most of them are infected 
before they reach Ceylon. Conditions on the 
rubber estates tend to increase the infection. 
The coolies are massed in lines; the lines are not 
provided with latrines; the habit of the coolies 
is to befoul the soil about the lines and on the 
estates; the climate is warm and moist and the 
ground is well shaded by the rubber trees; and 
the coolies of all ages work with bare feet and 
bare legs in contact with the polluted soil. As 
a result of these conditions the anemias on some 
of the rubber estates visited are as extreme as 
they were on the coffee estates in Porto Rico 
when the Porto Rico Anemia Commission began 
its work in 1904. 
At the request of the Government, the Prin- 
cipal Civil Medical Officer, and the Planters’ 
Association, the Commission’s representative 
submitted a tentative working plan providing
-P-A-G-E-50
50 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
for a demonstration on a small scale to be carried 
out on a selected group of estates. It was not 
considered necessary for the Commission to con- 
tribute funds toward the maintenance of the 
work; Ceylon is a highly prosperous country, 
and had on hand at this time an accumulated 
surplus medical fund which the Government 
proposed to use for this purpose. An officer was 
appointed to have charge of the work, the areas 
were selected, and microscopists were put under 
training for the work. On the outbreak of the 
European war this work was suspended. 
In Malaya the Commission’s representative 
was given opportunity to extend his observa- 
tions from Panang to Singapore. Official records 
which had been prepared for his coming were 
placed in his hands; with medical officers he 
visited Government and estate hospitals, in- 
spected coolie lines, examined clinically about 
2,000 coolies on cocoanut and rubber estates, 
and conferred with physicians, planters, and 
Government officials in the Straits Settlements 
and the Federated Malay States. 
There is much difference of opinion among 
the physicians in Malaya as to the importance of 
uncinariasis as a menace to health and working 
efficiency in that country. That uncinariasis 
is prevalent in Malaya there is abundant evi- 
dence. Most of the laborers on the large estates
-P-A-G-E-51
  GENERAL SUMMARY 51 
are Tamils brought over from Southern India, 
and the indications are that a large percentage 
of these are infected before leaving India. But 
the clinical examination at Port Swettenham of 
796 Tamils just arrived from India would in- 
dicate that the medical examination in India of 
intended immigrants to the Federated Malay 
States weeds out all the severe cases, so that 
those reaching the estates in Malaya are, so far 
as gross clinical symptoms go, physically fit. 
The indications are that on many of the rubber 
estates the infection increases and that severe 
anemias result. But the disabling disease of 
first importance on these rubber estates is 
malaria. The anemia of uncinariasis is not to be 
distinguished from the anemia of malaria. The 
two diseases are so complicated that it is ex- 
tremely difficult to determine whether or not 
uncinariasis on these estates is a sufficient 
menace to health to justify special effort for its 
relief and control. In view of this uncertainty, 
it was agreed in conference at Government 
House that the first effort should be directed 
toward ascertaining the facts; and that to this 
end a scientific commission should be appointed, 
supplied with necessary funds and equipment, 
and given the field with a free hand. This 
proposal has been approved by the Colo- 
nial Office and by the International Health 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
    52 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
Commission, and the organization of the uncina- 
riasis commission is now under way. 
In the Philippines the Commission’s repre- 
sentative had opportunity for a brief but 
rather comprehensive survey of the remarkable 
work which has been done in these Islands 
by the Department of Public Health during 
the brief period of American occupation. As 
a result of this visit, Dr. Victor G. Heiser, 
under whose direction this work has been done, 
has accepted a position with the International 
Health Commission as Director of its work for 
the East. 
4. To Central America:—On all journeys for 
preliminary investigation and conference in 
Central American countries the Commission 
was represented by Dr. Joseph H. White, of the 
United States Public Health Service, who on 
leave of absence accepted a position with the 
Commission for one year as Director of the 
Commission’s work in Latin-American coun- 
tries. He visited Panama, Costa Rica, Guate- 
mala, and Nicaragua. In each of these coun- 
tries he conferred with physicians, planters, and 
Government officials, and made preliminary 
investigations similar to those made in the West 
Indies and in the East. In each of these 
countries uncinariasis was found to be prevalent.
-P-A-G-E-53
GENERAL SUMMARY 53 
In some areas in these countries, where there is a 
heavy infection among the white or the Indian 
population, the disease is producing severe 
anemias, reminding one of its effects on the 
white people in the Southern States or on the 
jibaros in Porto Rico. In each of these four 
countries the Government has invited the Com- 
mission to codperate in the work of relief and 
control. These invitations have been accepted 
and funds for starting work on a small scale have 
been appropriated. Work is well under way in 
Panama and Costa Rica, and preliminary ar- 
rangements have been made for its opening in 
the other two countries. 
Til 
ORGANIZATION OF WORK AND WORKING 
AGENCIES 
Following these journeys for preliminary in- 
vestigation of local conditions and for conference 
with local authorities, definite steps were taken 
to organize work and working agencies for the 
relief and control of uncinariasis in British 
Guiana, Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. 
Lucia, Antigua, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, and Egypt; and-to create a scientific 
commission to study the relative importance of 
uncinariasis as a disabling disease in Malaya and 
other countries in the East.
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
1. Work under authority and direction of 
Government :—In each country where this work 
is in progress it is being done under the authority 
and direction of Government. This is regarded 
as fundamental. The International Health Com- 
mission does not undertake to eradicate un- 
cinariasis in any country; the infection can be 
brought under final control only by means of 
permanent agencies working over long periods 
of time. The Commission, therefore, while 
coéperating with Governments in the work of 
immediate relief, seeks to do this in such a way 
as to aid in building up permanent public health 
agencies for the control of this disease and all 
other diseases.   
2. Work begins on small scale:—The plan of 
work adopted for each country makes provision 
for beginning operations on a small scale. This 
has distinct advantages. The opening of work 
in each new country must be in the nature of an 
experiment. By beginning operations on a small 
scale opportunity is given, without waste of 
funds, to try out agencies and methods until 
they have become adjusted to local conditions. 
When the effective working unit for these con- 
ditions has been ascertained this unit can be 
multiplied at will. On opening work in a new 
country it becomes necessary also to train a local 
staff of microscopists, nurses, and caretakers for
-P-A-G-E-55
  GENERAL SUMMARY 55 
the service. When it has become standardized, 
the service itself is the best training-school for 
its own employes; and the training of em- 
ployes goes hand in hand with the enlargement 
of the work. 
3. Three prevailing types of working organi- 
zations:—Effort to adjust the work in each 
country to local conditions has given rise to a 
certain degree of diversity in agencies employed 
and in methods of work pursued. There are 
three prevailing types: one in Egypt, one in 
Central America, and one in the West Indies. 
The general principles of administration and the 
main lines of work undertaken are common to all. 
In Egypt conditions seem to make it necessary 
to administer treatment to all of the patients 
under hospital conditions. This was the deter- 
mining factor in the organization of the work. 
Shargia Province, with a population of about 
879,646, was selected as the territorial unit. of 
operations for the first demonstration; it is 
proposed in due course to cover the whole of 
this territory. The single working unit is the 
traveling hospital camp under tents, in which 
provision is made for its own staff, and for 100 
in-patients. A laboratory is provided for the 
microscopic examination of feces, urine, and 
blood; and a small separate enclosure or harem 
is reserved for women patients. The staff
-P-A-G-E-56
    
56 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
required to operate this unit consists of two 
doctors, a clerk, two male and one female attend- 
ants, a cook, a gate-keeper, a water-carrier, a 
watchman, and a messenger-boy. 
The plan of work designed to cover the whole 
province provides for one large traveling hospital; 
four small traveling hospitals, each capable of 
dealing with a hundred patients at a time; and 
in the capital town of the Province a group of 
house hospitals, each capable of accommodating 
30 in-patients. In addition to this hospital 
accommodation for the treatment of patients, the 
scheme provides for making a survey of the 
Province to determine the degree of infection, 
and for making a sanitary survey to locate the 
danger-points about the villages from which the 
infection is spread. ‘The whole of this working 
organization is under the direct supervision of 
Dr. A. MacCallan, of the Government Depart- 
ment of Public Health. 
In Central America the determining factor in 
the organization of the work has been the dis- 
pensary method of treatment, as carried out in 
the Southern States by the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission. The organization and the equip- 
ment are relatively simple. The personnel con- 
sists of: (1) a State Director; (2) under him a 
staff of Field Directors; and (3) with each Field 
Director one or more microscopists.
-P-A-G-E-57
GENERAL SUMMARY 57 
The State Director is a Government official, 
an officer of the Government department of 
health, and is clothed with the powers and re- 
sponsibilities belonging to such position. He is, 
under the department of health, the organizing 
and directing head of the work for the relief and 
control of uncinariasis in his country, and is 
responsible for the efficiency of the service. He 
reports quarterly to the Government department 
of health, and through this department to the 
International Health Commission. 
Under the direct supervision of the State 
Director is a staff of Field Directors, who have 
immediate charge of the work in the field. They 
constitute an ambulant service, each in charge 
of a circuit of dispensaries. To each Field 
Director is assigned a district. In this district 
he locates a convenient number of dispensary 
points, and visits each of these dispensaries at 
stated times. To these dispensaries the people 
come for free examination and treatment. Diag- 
nosis is by microscopic examination of the feces, 
the presence of infection being determined by 
finding eggs of the parasite in the patient’s stool. 
The field director is given as many microscopists 
as are needed to do the work. 
This working organization operates the dis- 
pensaries, makes the infection survey and the 
sanitary survey, and conducts a continuous 
campaign of education.
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
In the West Indies the determining factor in 
the organization has been the purpose to approxi- 
mate, as nearly as practicable, complete relief 
and control of uncinariasis within a given area. 
This was first tried out in British Guiana. 
The success of that experiment made it a demon- 
stration; and the organization of work and 
working agency which proved its efficiency in 
this demonstration is coming to be the prevail- 
ing type for the West Indies. For a detailed 
account of the demonstration in British Guiana, 
see Publication No. r of the International Health 
Commission. 
The single territorial unit of operations under 
this plan is a small, well-defined area containing 
a population of about 15,000. The plan of 
operation for this unit area comprises two under- 
takings, each with its own agency: the agency 
for the maintenance of which the International 
Health Commission contributes funds under- 
takes to treat until cured all persons within the 
area who are found infected; and the Govern- 
ment with its sanitary organization undertakes 
to make effective such sanitary measures as will 
prevent reinfection. The scheme for treating the 
infected requires: mapping the territory, locating 
roads, streams, villages, houses; taking a census 
of the population, numbering the houses in 
which the people live, recording name, age, sex,
-P-A-G-E-59
  GENERAL SUMMARY 59 
race, and post-office address; making microscopic 
examination of the entire population; putting 
under treatment all persons found infected with 
Uncinaria; and continuing microscopic exami- 
nation of each patient under treatment after 
each weekly course of medicine until a cure is 
effected. 
The staff required to operate this scheme for 
the one area consists of a doctor,—called field 
director,—in charge; a clerk; three microscopists; 
six or eight nurses, each with an understudy; and 
three office employes. While this force is en- 
gaged in treating the infected population of this 
area, the Government sanitary staff is putting 
into operation a system of latrines designed to 
put a stop to soil-pollution. 
The whole working organization is under the 
direct supervision of the Surgeon-General or of 
the State Director, who gives his whole time to 
the work. As it becomes desirable to enlarge 
the work, the units of operation may be multi- 
plied at will by increasing the funds and training 
the required staff. 
IV 
WORK WHICH THESE ORGANIZATIONS 
ARE DOING 
1. Treating the infected:—In all these coun- 
tries the work is organized with a view to center- 
ing first effort on measures of relief,—that is, on
-P-A-G-E-60
  
60 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
treating the people who are found infected. To 
quote the late Dr. C. W. Branch, of St. Vincent: 
“The measures for the prevention of hookworm 
disease fall into two groups: (1) the attempt to 
suppress or diminish the existing human infec- 
tion; (2) the attempt to prevent new infections,— 
(a) by avoiding the pollution of the soil and 
water, and (b) by guarding individuals from 
infection. Of these the first is the more im- 
portant and easier. The measures of the second 
group are necessary, but will be unavailing in 
the absence of the first.” Perhaps one should 
not go so far as to say that measures of immediate 
relief of the infected are more important than 
measures of sanitary control, which in the end 
bring permanent relief; but the experience of the 
Anemia Commission in Porto Rico and the larger 
experience of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commis- 
sion in the Southern States demonstrate that in 
any effective plan of operation the treatment of 
the people is the easier entering wedge. 
Systematic treatment is justifiable if only as 
a means of relieving suffering and inefficiency. 
By treatment alone the working efficiency of 
the laborers on coffee plantations in Porto Rico 
was increased from 30 to 50 per cent, and on 
some estates was doubled. By treating the 
people who came voluntarily to the dispensaries 
the general average of the hemoglobin index, as
-P-A-G-E-61
GENERAL SUMMARY 61 
estimated for the total population over a large 
area where the test was made, was raised from 
43.09 in 1904 to 72.22 in 1914. On many large 
rubber estates in Malaya, where the infection 
is prevalent, and where soil-pollution is general, 
little or no anemia can be detected—the result 
of systematically sending to hospital for treat- 
ment all cases showing clinical symptoms. 
Treatment also tends to lessen the spread of 
infection by curing the carriers. If all the carriers 
were cured and kept cured for the space of a 
year, the disease would be under control. But 
the chief advantage to be derived from system- 
atic treatment of the people on a large scale 
as a first step toward final control is that this is 
a most effective means of popular education. 
The work, if properly conducted, teaches the 
people by demonstration what the disease is, 
and what it means to them as a menace to health 
and working efficiency; it teaches them how they 
get it and how they may prevent it, and thus 
enlists their interest in carrying out the 
sanitary measures which are necessary for the 
control of the infection. As a result of this 
educational work in British Guiana the villages 
are now voluntarily contributing toward the 
maintenance of the inspectors employed by 
Government to carry out the sanitary measures 
required to prevent contamination of the soil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
    62 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
Within the brief period during which the work 
has been in operation in these countries 19,425 
persons have been treated. The significance of 
this result is to be stated not primarily in 
medical terms, as the relief of 19,425 people; but 
in educational terms, as the instructing and 
moving to action of a much larger number of 
people. For every person successfully treated 
becomes the effective teacher of a circle of friends 
and neighbors. 
2. Infection survey:—Effort is being made in 
each country concerned to carry out a survey to 
determine the geographic distribution of the in- 
fection, and to estimate the degree of infection for 
each infected area. The survey is based on micro- 
scopic examination of stools. The information 
thus gained has a threefold value: it locates and 
defines the problem which the Government has 
to face in attacking the disease; it gives the 
people an incentive and basis for helpful co- 
Operation; and by making a similar survey from 
time to time, it gives a definite measure of 
progress in the work of control. 
In most of the countries the infection survey 
is conducted in connection with the other 
regular work and calls for no special provision 
to carry it out. In Antigua, where doubt 
existed as to the prevalence and seriousness of 
uncinariasis, Dr. Eric Marshall was employed
-P-A-G-E-63
  GENERAL SUMMARY 63 
to make a systematic survey of the Island before 
inaugurating work for the relief and control of 
the disease. In addition to the examination’ of 
stools, blood tests were made to determine the 
degree of anemia which the infection was pro- 
ducing. The survey located the infection and 
defined the areas in which it is now proposed to 
institute measures for the control of the infection. 
In Egypt the survey has been completed for 
Sharqia Province and shows that not less than 
56 per cent of the male population are infected. 
The survey in British Guiana, based on an 
examination of the total population in Peters’ 
Hall District, shows an infection of 57 per 
cent. The examinations in the other coun- 
tries show the percentage of infection for the 
areas surveyed as follows: in St. Lucia about 
68 per cent; in Grenada 54 per cent; in Panama 
(including Panama City) 54 per cent,—in the 
interior of Panama 63 per cent; and in Costa 
Rica 83 per cent. 
3. Hemoglobin test:—In connection with the 
work in Antigua, Egypt, and Panama, a number 
of blood examinations have been made with a 
view to determining roughly the degree of 
anemia which the infection is producing. In 
Antigua, Dr. Marshall made blood examina- 
tions to determine the hemoglobin percentage 
in 259 infected cases and 15 uninfected cases. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  | 
64 INTERNATIONAL, HEALTH COMMISSION 
The record of results indicates that the degree 
of anemia being produced by. uncinariasis 
among the negro population of that island is 
relatively slight. Of the 259 infected cases 
examined only 13 cases show a hemoglobin 
index as low as 60 per cent, with three cases 
dropping to 10 per cent; in 246 cases the index 
is 70 per cent or above; in 191 cases it runs as 
high as 80 per cent; and in 44 cases it reaches 
go percent. Of the non-infected cases, however, 
none shows a hemoglobin index below 80 per 
cent. Or, to exhibit the contrast in another 
form: of the infected cases only 72 per cent 
show an index as high as 80 per cent, while 
some of these cases drop to 60 per cent, 50 
per cent, 40 per cent, and three cases to 10 
per cent.* 
In Panama Dr. Hackett made hemoglobin 
tests of 813 infected cases. The record of 
results indicates that uncinariasis is producing 
a greater degree of anemia among the Indian 
and mixed population of Panama than among 
the blacks of Antigua. Of the 813 cases ex- 
amined 522, or about 56 per cent, show a 
hemoglobin index ranging from 10 per cent to 
70 per cent, with 15 cases running as low as 
Io per cent.t 
In Egypt Dr. MacCallan made blood ex- 
amination of 6,256 infected cases and of 706 
*See summary for Antigua. 
+See summary for Panama.
-P-A-G-E-65
GENERAL SUMMARY 65 
cases taken at random from schools and ophthal- 
mic hospitals. Of the 6,256 infected cases, 
4,336, or nearly 70 per cent, show a hemoglobin 
index ranging from Io per cent to 50 per cent; 
489 cases give an index as low as 20 per cent, and 
246 cases drop to 10 per cent. Of the 706 cases 
taken at random without regard to infection, 
only 54, or less than 8 per cent, show an index as 
low as 50 per cent.* The anemia which 
uncinariasis is producing among the fellahin 
in Egypt seems to be more severe than in 
Panama or in Antigua. 
4. Preventive measures:—The organization 
in each of the eleven countries is conducting a 
sanitary survey to determine the existing con- 
ditions responsible for the presence and spread 
of uncinariasis in the infected areas. In Egypt, 
where the absence of ground-itch has given rise 
to doubt as to whether the infection is trans- 
mitted chiefly through the skin or by the mouth, 
this survey has for its object: (1) to ascertain 
how the infection is transmitted among the 
fellahin; and (2) to locate the danger-points about 
the Egyptian village from which the infection 
is spread. The final purpose of the survey 
in Egypt, as in all the other countries, is to lay 
the basis for a system of sanitary measures 
designed to bring the disease under control. 
~ *See summary for Egypt, pages 101 and 102, In interpretin; the results 
of these hemoglobin tests one must take into account bilharziasis in 
Egypt and malaria in Panama. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
66 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
In Costa Rica the Government has enacted a 
law requiring the construction and maintenance 
of privies which provide for the disposal of the 
night-soil in such manner as to can the soil 
from contamination. An appropriation of 
$11,000 per year has been made, and is now 
available for the purpose of making this law 
effective. The organization which conducts the 
work of examining and treating the people, serves 
also as a sanitary force in administering this law. 
The work of sanitation is being carried out in the 
areas in which the work of treatment is in prog- 
ress. In other words, the one working organi- 
zation selects an area for operations; makes 
an infection survey to determine the degree of 
infection in this area; gives treatment without 
cost to all persons found infected, who desire 
treatment; inspects privy conditions at the 
homes and about public places; and, wherever 
unsatisfactory privy conditions are found, pro- 
ceeds under the law to have the conditions 
remedied. 
The sanitary work which is being done in 
British Guiana is especially significant, because 
of its thoroughness and because of what it 
promises for the future. As already stated, the 
first work undertaken in this Colony was under- 
taken frankly as an experiment, the purpose 
being to approximate as nearly as practicable
-P-A-G-E-67
    
GENERAL SUMMARY 67 
complete relief and control of uncinariasis within 
a given area. It was understood that the 
Commission would supply funds for examining 
and treating the people and that the Government 
would undertake to prevent reinfection. The 
demonstration has been as thoroughgoing in its 
work of sanitation as in that of treatment. The 
area in which the demonstration has been carried 
out contains a number of free villages, the 
populations of which comprise East Indians, 
Negroes, Portuguese, and mixed breeds. These 
people have been brought to provide and to use 
latrines, so that the soil in these villages is now 
protected from contamination. And, better still, 
the educational effect of the whole work has been 
such that the villages are now voluntarily con- 
tributing toward the maintenance of a system 
of sanitary inspection to keep their condition 
up to the standard that has been set. 
The service is now being extended to other 
areas on the same basis. The plan of work here 
adopted providing for intensive work in well- 
defined areas, with the local Government under- 
taking to prevent reinfection, has some advan- 
tages that are worthy of special note: the work 
is definite and thorough and gives one a sense of 
accomplishment that closely approximates com- 
pleteness; the sanitary work keeps pace with the 
work of treatment and cure, and thus gives one  
-P-A-G-E-68
68 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
a sense of results that are lasting; it enables the 
Government to begin a definite sanitary work on 
the basis of an almost insignificant expenditure, 
and to train and enlarge its sanitary force gradu- 
ally as the work is extended from area to area, 
and as the people are educated to the point of 
more and more helpful codperation. 
5. Educating the people:—This whole work 
is essentially educational: it is teaching the 
people by demonstration. The field directors 
carry the work out among the people. They 
tell the story of this disease in varied graphic 
forms and in terms so simple that the common 
man, though he be illiterate, may see and under- 
stand. In the Southern States the schools and 
the public press were enlisted and large use was 
made of pamphlets, leaflets, and circular letters. 
These agencies are not being neglected in the 
foreign field; but among the natives in many 
of the tropical countries the story must be 
presented in more direct and concrete terms. 
Here the field directors rely more upon telling 
the story by word of mouth; and as they tell it 
they illustrate its details by means of lantern- 
slides, photographs, and objects. They use 
typical cases as object-lessons; they point out the 
gross clinical symptoms in these cases (and 
these the people soon learn to recognize) ; they get 
specimens of the patients’ stools and exhibit the
-P-A-G-E-69
  GENERAL SUMMARY 69 
eggs of the parasite under the microscope; they 
show the parasites that have been expelled by 
the treatment administered; and by means of the 
microscope they exhibit the living, squirming 
embryos that live by teeming thousands in the 
soil that has been befouled by an infected person, 
and are ready to infect any person with whose 
bare skin they come into contact. The recovery 
that follows treatment and cure tells its own 
story, both to the patient and to his friends and 
neighbors. The disease thus lends itself so 
readily to simple demonstration that the people 
—even native populations of tropical countries— 
easily understand its whole story. They learn 
to recognize the disease by its clinical picture; 
they have seen the parasite that causes it, and 
the eggs by which infection is demonstrated; and 
they see how the infection is spread and how it 
may be prevented. Asa result of this educational 
work, the people codperate helpfully, in both the 
work of treatment and that of prevention. A 
recent communication from British Guiana says: 
“Tt is gratifying to report that the authorities 
of the various villages of Areas A and B in 
the Peters’ Hall District have so thoroughly 
realized the benefit obtained from the expulsion 
of hookworm, and have so carefully realized the 
principles of ‘reinfection, and the necessity of its 
prevention, that they have subscribed the neces-
-P-A-G-E-70
  7 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
sary amount to maintain a Sanitary Inspector 
to devote his full time to their District.” 
The relief and control of this one disease is an 
object-lesson in the relief and control of disease 
in general. This one is simple and tangible; 
the common man can easily understand what 
it is, and what it means to him as a menace 
to his health and to his earning power; he 
knows its whole story; he knows its simple 
treatment and its one simple preventive meas- 
ure. Having seen this one disease brought 
under control and having had the worth of the 
effort brought home to him, he is prepared 
to give heed when spoken to about the control 
of diseases that are less simple and less tan- 
gible. To repeat, then, for the sake of emphasis, 
this whole work is essentially educational; and 
its best result is in securing the helpful codpera- 
tion of the people in the work of bringing this 
disease and all other preventable diseases under 
control.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES AND 
RESULTS BY TERRITORIAL UNITS 
BRITISH GUIANA 
1. Inauguration of work :—The work in British 
Guiana was the first to be opened in foreign 
countries with the codperation of the Inter- 
national Health Commission. Successful opera- 
tions against uncinariasis on the sugar estates 
had already been conducted by the local govern- 
ment under the direction of the Surgeon-General. 
The Commission was invited to codperate in 
trying out an experiment which had not been 
possible with the means available. It was pro- 
posed to approximate, as nearly as practicable, 
complete eradication of the disease within a 
selected area, this area to include free villages 
as well as plantations. Up to this time no 
attempt had been made toward relief or control 
of the disease in the villages. 
Plans were adopted for beginning operations 
on a small scale, with a limited budget, and for 
extending the operations and increasing the 
budget as the results seemed to justify. The 
Surgeon-General designated Dr. Ferguson to have 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
immediate supervision of the work. A scheme for 
conducting the work was then drawn up by Dr. 
Ferguson. The Peters’ Hall District, lying on 
the east bank of the Demerara River, near 
Georgetown, was chosen for the preliminary 
operations. This was divided, for the sake of 
convenience, into three areas, known as A, B, 
and C. Area A, the most populous, having 
3,984 inhabitants, occupies the smallest territory, 
and is nearest to Georgetown; Area B, with 
3,562 inhabitants, is more scattered and more 
distant from Georgetown; while Area C, with 
2,832 inhabitants, is the most scattered and 
distant of the three. 
Operations were started first in Area B, under 
a budget prepared by Dr. Ferguson, and adopted 
by the Commission, February 13, 1914. This 
called for a contribution of $7,244.70 by the 
International Health Commission. The Sur- 
geon-General and Dr. Ferguson, thinking that 
the experience of the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission in the Southern States would be of 
value in beginning work in British Guiana, 
requested the Commission to lend one of its 
substitute directors to aid in conducting 
operations. The Commission, in granting the 
request, assigned the mission to Dr. H. H. 
Howard, who arrived in British Guiana, March 
9, 1914.
-P-A-G-E-73

2. Activities and results:—In the beginning, 
during the experimental stage of the work, only 
one village—Agricola—with a population of 
1,330, was dealt with. When the results of the 
campaign in this village indicated that the 
methods employed were feasible, the work was 
rapidly extended to embrace the whole of Area 
B. With the experience gained in the campaign 
in Area B, budgets were prepared, submitted to 
the Commission upon the return of Dr. Howard 
to the United States, and adopted on August 13, 
1914. These provided $4,566.00 quarterly for 
continuing the work in Area B, and for extending 
it to Areas A and C. 
The work in Area B was started in the latter 
part of March, 1914. It was to have been 
completed December 31, 1914. In this area the 
daily dose of ten grains was used in the treatment 
of those infected, and it was for this reason that 
this campaign has been extended over a period of 
several months. On December 31, 1914, it was 
found that there still remained more than 200 
cases not yet cured by the daily dose, and for the 
sake of economy these were put upon the weekly 
large dose of thymol for more speedy cure. In 
Areas A and C the weekly large dose of thymol 
was the method of treatment adopted, and this 
method will be adhered to in future work.  
-P-A-G-E-74
  
74 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
Operations in Area C were started in Sep- 
tember, 1914. 
In Area A there was an interruption to the 
campaign owing to radical sanitary work in 
progress, a relocation of streets, and other 
improvements, which delayed the beginning of 
treatment until November, 1914. 
All work in this colony has been conducted 
under what is termed the intensive method, 
which requires: 
1. Operation within a definite area. 
2. Enumeration of the entire population in this 
area. 
3. Examination of the entire population. 
4. Treatment of all fang infected with unci- 
nariasis. 
5. Careful re-examination of every patient under 
treatment after each weekly course of medicine, 
until a cure is effected. 
All treatments are given in the homes of the 
people, under the supervision of nurses employed 
for this purpose. 
Representative citizens of the District deemed 
the campaign to be so effective and beneficial 
that on June 29, 1914, on the eve of Dr. Howard’s 
return to the United States, the following 
resolution was unanimously adopted by a mass 
meeting of the residents: 
   
-P-A-G-E-75
BRITISH GUIANA 75 
“WHEREAS, we, the inhabitants of the Peters’ 
Hall District on the East Bank, Demerara River, 
County of Demerara, and Colony of British Guiana, 
being fully convinced of the disastrous effects of 
the Hookworm (Ankylostome) when found in the 
human system, beg to record our warmest appre- 
ciation of the efforts of the Rockefeller Inter- 
national Health Commission in our midst for the 
purpose of eradicating these dangerous parasites; 
and ask Dr. Howard to convey to Headquarters 
our profound gratitude for their benevolent en- 
deavors in this direction. 
“We further beg to offer our unstinted codpera- 
tion and support with the hope that abundant 
success will be the ultimate result.” 
The following is a brief summary of the work 
accomplished in Areas A, B, and C, up to 
December 31, 1914:

  BRITISH GUIANA 81 
The field director in his report of November 
18, 1914, in commenting on the campaign in 
Peters’ Hall District, says: ‘All the work re- 
corded in this report has been carried on without 
interfering with the people’s daily work.” As 
to preventive sanitary measures, he says that 
on June 30, three and one-half months after the 
beginning of the work, “87 per cent of all the 
lots in the whole of Area B and Meadow Bank 
village had pit closets.” Since then some few 
more have been added. “It is gratifying to 
report that the local authorities of the various 
villages of Areas A and B in the Peters’ Hall 
District, have so thoroughly realized the benefit 
obtained from the expulsion of hookworm, and 
have so carefully realized the principles of re- 
infection, and the necessity of its prevention, 
that they have subscribed the necessary amount 
to maintain a Sanitary Inspector to devote his 
full time to their district.” 
3. Extending the work:—Plans have been laid 
for extending the work to the west bank of the 
Demerara River, which has likewise been divided 
into Areas A, B, and C. Budgets providing 
$7,074.96 for these areas were adopted November 
30, 1914. Work is expected to begin early in 
January, 1915. 
4. Preventive measures:— From the stand- 
point of sanitation, the work in British Guiana
-P-A-G-E-82
    
82 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
promises exceptionally favorable results. It 
was originally suggested that the International 
Health Commission supply the funds needed for 
treating and curing the disease and the local 
government undertake to prevent reinfection. 
The government appointed for this purpose a 
staff of native sanitary inspectors, trained in 
the sanitary institute of Georgetown. These 
subordinate inspectors are under the direct 
supervision of a chief sanitary inspector, brought 
out from England. One of the great advan- 
tages of an intensive campaign such as was 
waged in British Guiana is that, since the area 
operated in at first is small, only a small expendi- 
ture is required to provide the necessary sanitary 
force for inspection. As the work is extended 
from area to area, it is possible for the govern- 
ment to add to this force as the public becomes 
more enlightened and more interested in pre- 
ventive measures. 
The supervision of the subordinate sanitary 
officers is strict and consequently the service 
rendered is effective. The sanitary laws and 
regulations of British Guiana are not materially 
different from those in existence in other colonies, 
but they are probably more effectively enforced 
than is the case in many other countries. In 
every respect the work of sanitation has kept 
pace with that of treatment and cure; it is to be a
-P-A-G-E-83
ANTIGUA 83, 
continuous and not a spasmodic effort; and it 
promises results of the most definite and lasting 
value. 
ANTIGUA 
1. Organization of work:—Following a con- 
ference between Sir H. Hesketh Bell, Governor 
of Antigua, and the Director-General of the 
International Health Commission, the Commis- 
sion was invited to contribute funds for con- 
ducting a systematic investigation into the 
prevalence of uncinariasis in Antigua, with the 
understanding that measures for its control 
would be considered if the investigation showed 
the infection to be a menace to the health and 
efficiency of the people. A budget was prepared, 
submitted to the Commission, and adopted 
April 16, 1914. It provided $3,774.25 for this 
investigation. | 
2. Results to date:—Dr. Eric Marshall was 
appointed by the British Colonial Office to 
conduct this investigation. He began work 
about August 1, and concluded November 27, 
1914. The results of his work are summarized 
as follows:

3. Extending the work:—Dr. Marshall draws 
the following conclusions from his preliminary 
survey: 
“1, In certain districts a large percentage of the 
population are suffering from ankylostomiasis. 
“2, It is the cause of much sickness at the pres- 
ent time. 
“3. Under certain conditions it might become 
a menace to the health of the whole island. 
“4. At the present time, owing to its distribution, 
it can be readily dealt with by an intensive cam- 
paign. | 
“c. It is insome districts of considerable economic 
importance to the planters. 
“6. It is of vital importance to a large ean 
age of the labouring population.” | 
As a result of the survey work, disclosing an 
infection of approximately 15 per cent, plans 
are being prepared providing for systematic 
work for the relief and control of the infection in 
the infected areas. Dr. Marshall has recom- 
mended that laws be passed for the compulsory 
examination and treatment of all inhabitants, 
and the construction and maintenance of suit- 
able latrines for the prevention of reinfection. 
The legislature will meet in February, and will 
consider at that time the passage of such laws. 
TRINIDAD | 
1. Inauguration of work:—The plan for work 
in this island was drawn up by Surgeon-General  
-P-A-G-E-87
TRINIDAD 87 
H. L. Clare, approved by the English Advisory 
Committee, and submitted to the International 
Health Commission. It was adopted on Feb- 
ruary 27, 1914. The sum of $12,978.55 was 
made available for carrying on the work. The 
operations are conducted under the general 
supervision of the Surgeon-General. 
2. Results:—Colonel J. R. Dodd, M. D., 
D. P. H., was appointed Medical Officer in 
Charge, June 13, 1914. He arrived in Trinidad 
early in August. Actual work was started 
August 11th, with San Fernando as the head- 
quarters and central laboratory. Branch lab- 
oratories have been established at Couva, Princes 
Town, and LaBrea. 
The following is a summary of the work 
accomplished from August 11, through December 
31, 1914, for all of the laboratories combined: 
Number of persons examined............. 4528 
Number of persons treated. ............. 1635 
Number of persons cured................ 270% 
3. Sanitary survey :—A partial sanitary survey 
has been made in the localities where work has 
been carried on. Of 1636 premises inspected, 
664. had no latrines. The following table in- 
dicates the types of latrines in use: 
*It is the custom to administer from one to three treatments. These 
treatments generally produce cures. For determining positively which 
cases have been cured, a microscopic re-examination is required from 
two to eight weeks after treatment. Often this re-examination is not

4. Extending the work:—The difficulty of 
securing trained medical officers from England 
during recent months has retarded the develop- 
ment of the work in this island. The authorities, 
however, have invited the Commission to dele- 
gate from its staff of substitute directors men to 
fill the vacancies temporarily, until English 
medical officers are available. Arrangements 
are being made to lend this assistance. 
ST. LUCIA 
1. Inauguration of work:—Dr. S. Branch is in 
charge of measures against uncinariasis in this 
colony, and serves under the general direction 
of an Advisory Committee appointed by the 
Island Government. The budget, providing 
$6,145.94, was adopted April 16, 1914. 
2. Results to date:—A preliminary investiga- 
tion into the distribution and prevalence of the 
infection was conducted up to December 31, 
1914, with the following results:

scheduled to begin January 1, 1915. 
4. Preventive measures:—The Administrator 
reported December 11, 1914, that every effort 
will be made to secure the enactment and 
enforcement of the regulations suggested by 
Dr. Howard, Director for the West Indies, for 
the improvement of sanitation in St. Lucia.

Dr. Cyril H. Durrant is Director in Charge. 
The plan of campaign was formulated by the 
Administrator, Douglas Young, Esq. 
No work was done in St. Vincent in 1914, 
owing to the fact that Dr. Durrant was not

available. 
GRENADA 
1. Inauguration of work:—A budget, pro- 
viding $9,038.72 for conducting work on this 
island, was adopted April 16, 1914. Dr. Angus 
MacDonald was appointed Director and assumed 
his duties August 28th. 
Up to the close of the year a survey had been 
conducted through the schools; the support of 
influential persons was sought and obtained; 
literature was distributed and addresses were 
delivered; and other preliminary arrangements 
were made. Actual work was started December 
1st. Head offices were established at Marine 
Villa, with branches at Mount Moritz, Gouyave, 
Birchgrove, and St. Dominic’s.

Dr. MacDonald draws the following con- 
clusions from his work to date: | 
“1, There is a high rate of hookworm infection 
in Grenada. | 
“2, All classes (practically), both sexes, all ages, 
are infected. 
“3, Present methods of examination indicate an 
infection of ankylostomiasis to the amount of 74 
per cent of the white peasant settlers in one dis- 
trict, and 64 per cent of the black population in 
another. With improved methods of examination, 
there is no doubt the infection will be shown to be 
even higher than this. 
“4. A definite amount of debility, chiefly anemia, 
cardiac dilatation and chronic dyspepsia prevails, 
especially in the more highly infected districts. 
“5. Dwarfism and infantilism are found amongst 
those infected, both white and black; but other 
causes of these conditions are probably operative, 
and the result of treatment must be awaited before 
definite conclusions can be drawn. 
«6, Themode of infection is from the soil (mainly). 
“7, Drinking of polluted water is general, and the 
resulting dysenteric diseases complicate and are com- 
plicated by ankylostomiasis. 
“8. The blood examination carried out in the 
laboratory of the Commission has revealed infection 
by the malarial parasites in different areas, which 
also complicates diagnosis and treatment of anky- 
lostomiasis and makes difficult any correct alloca- 
tion of morbid conditions to the causative disease.”

3. Extending the work:—Dr. MacDonald has 
planned to extend the work, beginning January 
I, 1915, on the intensive plan. For this purpose 
three areas have been selected: two at St. David, 
known respectively as Area A and Area B, 
and one at Mt. Moritz Centre. Area A at 
St. David has a population of approximately 
3,069; Area B, 3,260; and the area at Mt. 
Moritz Centre, 3,557. 
4. Preventive measures:—The local Govern- 
ment has been petitioned to pass laws providing 
for the construction and maintenance of sanitary 
latrines. If such laws are enacted, Dr. Mac- 
Donald will be able to supplement his work of 
examination, treatment, and cure with sanitary 
improvements designed to prevent reinfection. 
JAMAICA 
Upon hearing of the measures conducted in 
adjacent colonies for the relief and control of 
uncinariasis, the Government of Jamaica on’ 
April 3, 1914, expressed a desire through the 
Colonial Office in London, that the Commission 
be asked to send a representative to consider 
coéperation in relief measures in that island. 
The invitation has been accepted and the Direct- 
or for the West Indies will visit that island in 
February, for the purpose of investigating 
the prevalence of the infection, with a view to 
considering codperative plans for its control.
-P-A-G-E-93
  PANAMA 93 
PANAMA 
1. Inauguration of work:—The participation 
of the International Health Commission in 
relief measures against uncinariasis in Panama 
had its inception at a dinner at the Pan-American 
Building, in Washington, D. C., on the evening 
of February 15, 1914. The dinner was attended 
by diplomatic representatives of the various 
Central and South American governments. The 
work of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission 
in the Southern States was outlined by the 
Director-General and the method proposed by 
the International Health Commission of co- 
Operating with local governments elsewhere along 
similar lines was presented. 
The Government of Panama thereupon asked 
the Commission to lend assistance for conducting 
operations in that Republic. The invitation 
was accepted April 28, 1914. It was agreed that 
the work be carried on as a subdivision of the 
National Department of Health. In accordance 
with plans agreed upon a Director was ap- 
pointed to have immediate charge of the work. 
Dr. L. W. Hackett was appointed Director, 
April 1st, and arrived in Panama May 14, 1914. 
Following a series of conferences between the 
Government officials and Dr. Hackett, a pre- 
liminary annual budget was prepared, submitted 
to the Commission, and adopted July 1, 1914. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  94 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
This provided $15,038.50 for conducting the 
work. The Republic of Panama is furnishing 
offices and other facilities, as well as the medicine 
needed for treatment. 
2. Results:—The first weeks were devoted to 
securing supplies from the States; conferring 
with the Government officials; conducting pre- 
liminary surveys; and attending to various 
routine matters connected with the inauguration 
of the campaign. Actual work was started about 
July 15th. Preliminary operations were begun 
in the City of Panama; and subsequently ex- 
tended to Chorrera, Arraijan, Capira, and 
Bocas del Toro, villages in the interior. 
The dispensary plan followed by the Rocke- 
feller Sanitary Commission in the Southern 
States was adopted. This plan has three main 
features: (1) examinations and treatments; (2) 
infection survey; and (3) sanitary survey; with 
the special addition for the Panama work of a 
record of (4) blood examinations. The following 
is a summary of results accomplished through 
December 31, 1914.

COSTA RICA 
1. Inauguration of work:—Invitation by the 
Republic of Costa Rica to the International 
Health Commission to codperate with that 
country in work for the relief and control of 
uncinariasis was extended on April 14, 1914. 
In conference between the President of Costa 
Rica, the Government Department of Health, 
and Dr. J. H. White, representing the Commis- 
sion, a tentative working plan was formulated 
and agreed upon. This plan was approved by 
the Commission on July 1, 1914, and the sum of 
$14,589.50 was appropriated for the work. 
Dr. Henry R. Carter, Jr., was appointed tem- 
porarily as Director to have charge of the work. 
2. Activities and results:—The first weeks 
were devoted to organization. The Director 
had to complete in detail working arrangements 
with the Government; he had to make pre- 
liminary surveys and to select the areas for 
first attack; he had to procure equipment and to 
select his local staff. Active operations began 
on September 23, 1914. Stations to which the 
people were invited to come for free examination 
and treatment were opened at Puntarenas,

  3. Preventive measures:—The sanitary code 
of Costa Rica requires that the people provide 
and use latrines to prevent contamination of the 
soil. On August 31, 1914, decree was issued by 
the Government making available the sum of 
$11,000 to be used in making this law effective. 
The work of sanitation is being carried out in 
the areas in which the people are being examined 
and treated. The organization which adminis- 
ters the treatment undertakes also to inspect: 
latrine accommodations and where conditions 
are found unsatisfactory to proceed under the 
law to have them remedied.

EGYPT 99 
EGYPT 
1. Inauguration of work:—Dr. F. M. Sand- 
with began the systematic treatment of un- 
cinariasis at the Kasr el Ainy Hospital as early 
as 1887. For sixteen years the Church Mission 
Hospital in Cairo has been treating patients 
who come to it in increasing numbers from all 
parts of Egypt. This institution now has a 
special ward for uncinariasis and has 400 to 600 
patients at one time under treatment for this 
disease. The Government Department of Public 
Health had instituted measures for the relief and 
control of the disease prior to the visit of the 
representative of the International Health Com- 
mission, in April, 1914. The Commission was 
asked to codperate in making these operations 
more extensive and to make the demonstration 
more complete than was possible on the basis of 
local funds. Under instructions from the Di- 
rector-General of the Department of Health, 
the local uncinariasis committee, consisting of 
Doctors Looss, Ferguson, Day, Todd, and 
Hastings, formulated a plan of operations for 
one year. 
This plan proposed the Province as the unit 
of organization and of work. Egypt is divided 
into 14 provinces; Sharqia Province was se- 
lected as the territory within which to begin 
operations. Conditions in Egypt seem to make 
LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
isn 3s iii’ mutes seine eas as i eee  
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
it necessary to administer treatment to all 
patients under hospital conditions. The original 
plan for this Province provides for one large and 
four small traveling tent hospitals, and in the 
chief town of the Province a group of improvised 
house hospitals each accommodating about 30 
patients. To these hospitals the people come 
for free examination and treatment. The plan 
provides also for an infection survey and a 
sanitary survey to be conducted as a special 
investigation. The budget calls for an annual 
expenditure of £12,000, one-half of this sum to 
be supplied by the Egyptian Government, and 
one-half by the Commission. The amount was 
reduced after the outbreak of the war in Europe 
to £9,000, this expenditure to be shared equally 
by the Government and the Commission. 
2. Activities and results:—The results may be 
briefly summarized under the heads of hospital 
work and survey work. 
a. Hospital work:—The work had been started 
with the opening of hospitals at Qaliub and 
Qalama in Qaliubia Province. On August roth 
these two hospitals were closed and operations 
were transferred to Sharqia Province. In this 
Province hospitals have been opened at Belbeis 
and at Minia el Qamh. Cases are being treated 
also in the Murad Pasha Hospital at El Deir. 
The results for the five hospitals are exhibited 
in the following table:

3. Extending the work:—The European war, 
by reducing the revenues of the Egyptian 
Government, has seriously retarded the develop- 
ment of the work in Egypt. It was hoped to 
operate at least six hospitals in each province 
simultaneously, but the lack of funds has limited 
the number to two. The hospitals established 
at Minia el Qamh and Belbeis in Shargia Prov- 
ince will be continued until the number of 
patients presenting themselves for treatment 
has been materially reduced. At present this 
number is greater than can be accommodated. 
The work in Egypt will be extended from 
village to village, and from province to province, 
as rapidly as the results justify and the available 
funds will permit. 
GENERAL SUMMARY 
The following tables give a summary of 
results accomplished up to December 31, 1914. 
Table (1) shows the number of persons who 
were examined, treated, and cured, respectively, 
in the work of relieving sufferers. Table (2) 
shows the number of persons examined, but not 
treated, in the survey work for locating the 
infection. Table (3) gives the grand total of 
all persons examined, both in the work of relief 
and in the survey work.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
The statement of expenditures presented on 
the following page shows that the Commission 
expended a total of $157,731.08 during the 
eighteen months from July 1, 1913, to December 
31, 1914. Of this amount $34,038.79 was 
devoted to administrative work; $3,108.15 being 
for property in the form of furniture and equip- 
ment, and $30,930.64 for current expenses. On 
an annual basis this would represent approxi- 
mately $20,000 for current expenses, of which 
about $5,000 represents expenditures for travel- 
ing purposes. 
The $14,113.14 used for educational and in- 
formational work was devoted to the collection 
of material, and the preparation and display of 
exhibits by the Department of Surveys and 
Exhibits; the development of the library and 
the printing and distribution of publications. 
The $109,579.15 used for the hookworm cam- 
paign in the field was expended partly out of 
special budgets adopted for work in foreign 
countries and partly directly out of the Com- 
mission’s central office budget. The latter in- 
cluded items for the purchase of thymol, field 
equipment, travel expenses of directors in going 
to and in returning from the field, and salaries of 
directors of field work up to the time these were 
charged to special budgets.

  During the year the Foundation has received from the Cleveland 
Trust Company $401,066.28, and a participation certificate in mortgages 
on property formerly owned by the Euclid Heights Realty Company, 
to the amount of $202,400 (Total $603,466.28) as a distribution of the 
proceeds of the sale of Euclid Heights Realty Company property. This 
has been credited to the cost of $716,000 (par value) Euclid Heights 
Realty Company Bonds, thus reducing the book value of same to 
$1,997.72. The Mortgages of $202,400 have since been credited with a 
payment of $4,030, reducing value to $198,370. 
The Protective Committee for the St. Louis & San Francisco Refunding 
4% bonds (now in default), with whom the bonds were deposited, 
have purchased the coupons maturing July Ist, 1914, and January Ist, 
1915. The $80,000 received for the coupons belonging to the $2,000,000 
of this issue owned by the Foundation, has not been treated as income, 
but is carried in “Suspense” pending the outcome of the receivership 
of the St. Louis & San Francisco Company. 
The $520,000 Pere Marquette RR Consolidated 4% Bonds, which 
have been in default since their receipt, have been deposited with the 
Farmers’ Loan & Trust Company as depositary for the Protective 
Committee for this issue. 
Under date of December 15, 1914, Mr. John D. Rockefeller conveyed 
to the Foundation $25,000 par value Canada Southern Ry. Consoli- 
dated Mortgage 5% bonds, the income of which is to be paid to the 
Baptist Home for the Aged of New York City, as long as the Foundation 
shall deem it wise. As a special fund this account is shown separately 
in Exhibit C. 
There follow eight statements, entitled Exhibits A to H inclu- 
sive, which give the various financial details in reference to the 
Foundation. Respectfully submitted, 
L. G. Myers, 
Treasurer.

By a Deed of Trust created by Mr. John D. Rockefeller, 
January 6, 1913, Three million two hundred thousand 
dollars ($3,200,000) par value First Mortgage Gold 
Bonds were given by him to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 
Starr J. Murphy, Jerome D. Greene and Edward L. 
Ballard, Trustees, for the following purpose, namely: to 
“apply the income and such portion or the whole of 
the principal as they may deem proper to such charitable 
use or uses as they may from time to time select and in 
such proportions respectively as they may determine,” 
but subject to the condition that 
“Tn case there shall be created during said period, 
either by act of Congress or by act of the legislature 
of any State, or otherwise pursuant to law, a cor- 
poration having as its objects to promote the well- 
being and to advance the civilization of the peoples 
of the United States and its territories and posses- 
sions and of foreign lands, in the acquisition and 
dissemination of knowledge, in the prevention and 
relief of suffering and in the promotion by eleemosy- 
nary and philanthropic means of any and all of the 
elements of human progress, or having broad general 
objects substantially the same as those above stated, 
the statement of the objects and the other pro- 
visions of the act or instrument incorporating said 
corporation being satisfactory to me, if living, or, 
if T shall not be living, to my son, John D. Rocke- 
feller, Junior, said trustees shall forthwith convey 
the said trust property, or so much thereof as shall 
then remain in the hands of the trustees, including 
any unappropriated income therefrom, to said 
corporation; and upon said transfer, this trust shall 
77 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
    178 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
terminate, and the trustees shall be released from 
all further liability by reason of this trust.” 
The provisions of the Act to Incorporate the Rockefeller 
Foundation as passed by the Legislature of the State of 
New York, May 14, 1913, were formally approved by 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller in accordance with the terms 
of the Deed of Trust above mentioned, as follows: 
“Messrs. John D. Rockefeller, Junior, 
“Starr J. Murphy, 
“Jerome D. Greene, and 
“Edward L. Ballard. 
“Gentlemen :— 
“The Rockefeller Foundation having been in- 
corporated by an Act of Legislature of the State 
of New York, known as Chapter 488 of the Laws 
of 1913, entitled An Act to Incorporate The Rocke- 
feller Foundation, I do hereby certify that The 
Rockefeller Foundation as incorporated by the 
statute above named has broad general objects 
substantially the same as those stated in the Deed 
of Trust from me to you, dated January 6, 1913, 
and that the statement of the objects and the 
other provisions of said act incorporating The 
Rockefeller Foundation are satisfactory to me. 
“Very truly yours, 
May 2oth, 1913. (Signed) John D. Rockefeller.” 
At the meeting of the Rockefeller Foundation May 22, 
1913, Mr. Starr J. Murphy, on behalf of the Trustees 
above mentioned, formally transferred the bonds in their 
possession to the Rockefeller Foundation, thus establish- 
ing the first funds for the uses of the Foundation.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
LETTERS OF GIFT 179 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller’s subsequent gifts were com- 
municated by the following letters:— 
II 
June 14, 1913. 
The Rockefeller Foundation, 
26 Broadway, 
New York City. 
Gentlemen:— 
I hereby give you the stocks and bonds shown in the 
accompanying statement, of a total value, based on the 
market prices of June 4th, 1913, of Twenty-one million, 
fifty-two thousand, twenty-eight dollars and fifty-four 
cents ($21,052,028.54). 
It is more convenient for me to provide funds for the 
Foundation by a gift of these specific securities rather

Gentlemen:— 
I hereby give you the stocks shown in the accompanying 
statement, of a total value, based on the market prices 
of June 4th, 1913, of about Ten million, one hundred 
seventy-eight thousand, four hundred and two dollars 
($10,178,402.00). 
It is more convenient for me to provide funds for the 
Foundation by a gift of these specific securities rather 
than by a gift of cash, and I believe the securities have 
intrinsic and permanent value which would justify you in 
retaining them as an investment; but, in order to relieve 
you from any uncertainty or embarrassment with regard 
to them I desire to state specifically that you are under no 
obligation to retain any of these investments, but are at 
liberty to dispose of them or any of them and change the 
form of investment whenever in your judgment it seems 
wise to do so. 
This gift is made for the general corporate purposes 
of the Foundation, and the principal as well as the income 
may be used in your discretion for any of the corporate 
purposes of the Foundation.

Gentlemen :— 
I hereby give you, less the interest accrued and the 
dividends declared thereon to date, the securities shown 
in the accompanying statement, of a total value at the 
market price of March 1, 1914, of Sixty-five million, 
five hundred sixty-nine thousand, five hundred sixty-nine 
dollars, forty-six cents ($65,569,569.46), making with the 
amounts heretofore given by me to the Rockefeller 
Foundation, One hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). 
In my opinion the great majority of these securities 
have intrinsic and permanent value which would justify 
you in retaining them, but you are at liberty to dispose 
of any or all of them and to change the form of investment 
whenever in your judgment it seems wise to do so. 
It is a condition of this gift that from the income of 
the Foundation the sum of Two million dollars ($2,000,- 
000), annually, or so much thereof as I shall designate, 
shall be applied during my lifetime to such specific objects 
within the corporate purposes of the Foundation as I 
may from time to time direct. If at the close of any 
fiscal year there shall remain any balance of the $2,000,000 
which I have not thus designated during that fiscal year, 
such balance shall be transferred to the general unre- 
stricted income of the Foundation, to be used as the Foun- 
dation shall see fit. Subject to the foregoing provision, 
the principal as well as the income of this gift may be 
used in your discretion for any of the corporate purposes 
of the Foundation.

Gentlemen:— 
Mrs. John D. Rockefeller heretofore delivered to the 
Equitable Trust Company of New York, ten Colorado 
Industrial Company five per cent. Convertible Gold 
Bonds of the par value of One thousand dollars each, on 
the following trust:— 
“These are given to you in trust to hold and 
collect the income and to pay the same as collected 
to The Baptist Home Society of the City of New 
York for the support of the residents of the Home, 
and to be applied for maintenance purposes. The 
income only is to be available for the uses of the 
Society. The Society is to have the right to alter 
the form of investment, provided that in the judg- 
ment of its trustees this is necessary for the safety 
of the fund, but such change shall not be merely 
for the purpose of increasing the income of the fund. 
In case of such change of investment, you are to 
receive and retain the proceeds of these bonds and 
the new securities in which the proceeds shall be 
invested. The principal of the trust is not to be 
liable for the debts of the corporation, and is not 
to be hypothecated for any purpose whatever.
-P-A-G-E-186
  
  186 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The income is not to be anticipated, but is to be 
collected and applied only as it accrues. 
“Tn case the Baptist Home Society of the City 
of New York shall be dissolved or its operations 
shall be discontinued, these securities and their pro- 
ceeds are to become the property of and to be 
delivered to the Woman’s Foreign Baptist Mission 
Society of Boston, to be used for the erection of 
buildings on the foreign field.” 
Subsequently Mrs. Rockefeller expressed a desire to 
substitute the Rockefeller Foundation as Trustee in place 
of the Equitable Trust Company, and this was consented 
to by the Trustees of the Baptist Home Society of the 
City of New York, and the officers of the Society wrote a 
letter to the Equitable Trust Company as follows:— 
New York, December 2nd, 1913. 
“The Equitable Trust Company of New York, 
37 Wall Street, New York City. 
“Gentlemen :— 
“The Baptist Home Society of the City of New 
York has, at the request of Mrs. Laura 8. Rocke- 
feller, consented to the substitution of The Rocke- 
feller Foundation in place of your Company as 
Trustee of the trusts under which she has heretofore 
delivered to you ten Colorado Industrial Company 
five per cent. Convertible Gold Bonds in trust for 
this Society. We hereby request you to deliver 
the same to the Rockefeller Foundation.

“Mrs. Jacob Hayes, Secretary.”

should be paid to the beneficiaries free from any charges 
on the part of the Trustee. Will you kindly send me, as

APPENDIX V 
THE PROPOSED FEDERAL CHARTER OF THE 
ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The idea of establishing such a body as the Rockefeller 
Foundation had been discussed and various plans consid- 
ered for some time previous to 1910. In that year, how- 
ever, a bill providing for a Federal charter was drawn up 
on lines similar to those of the General Education Board’s 
charter, and on March 2, 1910, it was introduced in the 
United States Senate (S. 6888, 61st Congress). Atahearing 
held by the Committee on the District of Columbia, to 
which the bill had been referred, its purposes were described 
at length by Mr. Starr J. Murphy, and a report of the 
hearing was printed. (Hearing on S. 6888, 61st Congress, 
2nd session, March 11, 1910.) The bill was favorably 
reported. 
The publication of the terms of the proposed charter 
was followed by wide public discussion, and the following 
amendments were urged: That there should be some limi- 
tation on the power of members of the Corporation to elect 
their successors; that there should be a limit to the amount 
of money that could be heaped up for purposes subject to 
so broad a definition as that given by the charter; that the 
Foundation should not necessarily be perpetual, but that, 
it should be subject to termination and to the distribution 
of its funds at some period in the future; and, finally, that 
the control of the Foundation should be more specifically 
vested in Congress. 
As a result of the consideration of these suggestions, the 
bill was redrawn and introduced in 1911 (S. 2675, 62nd 
Congress), the significant changes being as follows: 
(1) Congress might, at any time, impose such limita- 
tions upon the objects of the Corporation as the public 
interest might demand; all gifts or property received by 
187  
-P-A-G-E-188
188 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the Corporation to be held subject to this provision. 
The total amount of property specifically limited to 
$100,000,000, exclusive of increases in the value of property 
subsequent to its receipt. 
(2) The income of the Corporation not to be accumu- 
lated or added to the principal, but to be currently applied 
to the purposes for which the Corporation was created, 
subject only to such reasonable delay as may be necessary 
in the wise administration of the fund. 
(3) After the expiration of fifty years from the receipt of 
any property the Corporation might distribute, for the 
general purposes of the Foundation, the principal, as well 
as the income, with the consent of two-thirds of the mem- 
bers of the Corporation, such distribution to take place 
after one hundred years from the time the property was 
received, if Congress should so direct. 
(4) The self-perpetuating clause modified by the pro- 
vision that the election of new members of the Corporation 
should be subject to disapproval within sixty days by a 
majority of the following persons: The President of the 
United States, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the 
President of the Senate, the Speaker cf the House of Rep- 
resentatives, and the Presidents of the following institu- 
tions: Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia 
University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University 
of Chicago. 
(5) To make it clear that the charter did not attempt 
to exempt from taxation property that would otherwise be 
taxable under the laws of any state in which it might be 
held, a clause was added clearly limiting to the United 
States or any Territory or District thereof the provisions 
of the exempting clause. 
The foregoing changes, while not regarded as necessary 
by the incorporators, in view of the fact that Congress 
could at any time amend or terminate the charter if it 
should appear that the suggested limitations were needed,
-P-A-G-E-189
PROPOSED FEDERAL CHARTER 189 
were nevertheless cordially accepted as not likely to inter- 
fere with any of the purposes of the Foundation. No 
effort was made, however, to advance the consideration of 
the bill until in 1912 it was re-introduced in the House of 
Representatives (H. R. 21532) in a form identical with 
S. 2675, with the following exceptions: In the statement 
of the purposes of the Foundation (Sec. 3) the House bill 
amended the phrase “and in the promotion of any and all 
the elements of human progress”’ to read “and in the pro- 
motion, by eleemosynary and philanthropic means, of any 
and all the elements of human progress”’; and in the section 
relating to the membership of the Corporation (Sec. 8) the 
minimum number of members was increased from five to 
nine with the additional provision that no gifts should be 
made when the number of members should for any cause 
be less than nine. Thus modified, the bill was unani- 
mously reported by the Judiciary Committee of the House 
(H. Report No. 529, Apr. 11, 1912), and was passed by a 
majority of more than two-thirds (152 to 65) on January 
20, 1913. 
After passing the House the bill went to the Senate, 
where it was favorably reported by the Judiciary Commit- 
tee, February 19, 1913 (S. Report No. 1258). Its 
position on the calendar in the closing weeks of the 62nd 
Congress and at a time when a number of the great public 
supply bills were being obstructed in their passage, some 
of them actually failing to pass and going over to the 
incoming Congress, made it impossible for the bill to come 
to a vote. 
No further effort was made to obtain a charter by act of 
Congress, and steps were then taken to secure incorporation 
under the laws of the State of New York, which was accom- 
plished without opposition in any quarter, on May 14, 
1913. 
The proposed Federal Charter, in the form in which it 
was passed by the House of Representatives is printed

MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 
The following memorandun, prepared by Mr. Frederick 
T. Gates, before the appointment of the China Medical 
Commission, was presented to the Trustees of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation and accepted by them as a tentative 
plan for the guidance of the Trustees and of the Commis- 
sion in their study of medical needs in China: 
January 29, 1914. 
AIM—THE GRADUAL AND ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT OF A 
COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF 
MEDICINE IN CHINA 
METHOD—The following is suggested as a working 
plan, to be modified as experience and further knowledge 
shall suggest: 
a I. Mastery of existing data as complete as pos- 
sible: 
(a) Data Available in the United States. 
(1) Secure immediately from the United States mission 
boards name, educational qualifications, location, and 
statistics of annual work of every medical missionary in 
China, male and female. 
(2) Secure map and mark every medical station. 
(3) Get full data as to hospitals, their cost, capacity, 
equipment, staff, annual cost to missionary boards, native 
contributions, statistics of work, with list of current needs 
and estimate of cost. 
(4) Mark these hospitals and index them on the same 
map as above. 
(b) English and European Data. 
At convenience, secure similar data from English and 
other foreign boards, if any, operating medically in China, 
and similarly mark on same map. 
208
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 209 
(c) Data in China. 
Send a carefully chosen and thoroughly qualified man to 
China at once to make and currently report a survey of 
current medical work and education. He will report in 
detail on:— 
(1) Chinese government medical schools, their distribu- 
tion, character, and needs. 
(2) Attitude of government toward missionary medical 
schools and their official recognition, and the qualifications 
required for such recognition. 
(3) The difficulties of dissection and how they may be 
more effectually overcome. 
(4) He will visit the seven union medical schools com- 
manded by the Chinese Medical Association, also the Har- 
vard and the Yale Schools, and report in detail on the 
character and promise of each, 
(5) He will visit also as many hospitals as possible and 
as many medical missionaries and report on same, enabling 
us to check up the data secured at home with the reports of 
this expert. 
(6) He will examine in each section the local schools, and 
oe their deficiencies and needs, viewed as preparatory 
schools for medical students. 
Step IT, _ With the data thus secured, which will give us 
an authentic bird’s-eye view of the situation of medicine 
in all departments, its excellencies, its deficiencies and its 
needs, our second step will be to choose that medical dis- 
trict or province which seems best to lend itself to our pur- 
poses. The field chosen should offer the best combination 
of such qualifications as the following: 
(1) It should be as central as possible to all practitioners 
of scientific medicine in China, native and foreign. 
(2) It should be easily and cheaply approachable by rail 
and water transportation. 
(3) It should have the largest number of practitioners in 
its immediate vicinity. 
(4) It should have the largest, best equipped, best con- 
ducted and most efficient medical school associated with 
best and largest hospital and available clinical material. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 
(5) It should be union or undenominational. 
(6) It should have immediately tributary the largest 
number and best equipped missionary and government 
schools. 
(7) It should be located in a large center of both Chinese 
and European intelligence and wealth. 
(8) It should have, or be able to secure, facilities for dis- 
section. 
(9) It should have, or be able to secure, official govern- 
ment recognition. 
(10) If possible, all other things being equal, it should 
be near the seat of the central government. It would 
be disappointing if Peking were found inadequate and 
unsuitable. 
Step III. Having now secured our data as per I, and 
chosen our particular section and center as per II, we are 
ready to take several important steps simultaneously. 
Indeed, these steps will have to be taken simultaneously, 
for no one of them can reach its maximum efficiency with- 
out the others concurrently: 
(1) Partly by concentration, where ‘practicable, and 
mainly by recruits, see that at least two qualified prac- 
titioners are connected with every hospital, secure qualified 
trained nurses for each hospital, also all necessary surgical 
equipment for scientific work and proper sanitation.— 
This reinforcement and uplift of medical stations to be 
limited in area to the proper local field of the chosen 
medical school. 
(2) Put the medical school, in men, in equipment, in 
hospitals, in clinical material, on the best practicable basis 
simultaneously with the help given the outlying medical 
stations. 
(3) Send from the United States on a systematic plan 
and periodically, best qualified technicians in the various 
branches of medicine, each equipped with latest advances 
in his department. Let these give series of lectures first 
in this, later perhaps in other schools in missionary lands— 
a world tour series of lectures occupying perhaps a year for 
each—and thus to keep the ehoelabeees each year with 
the freshest and most inspiring new discoveries, with their 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 211 
appropriate demonstrations, and local nuclei trained in 
new technique. 
(4) Within the chosen territory, require every medical 
practitioner on foreign pay to spend at least three months 
of every year at this central medical school, pay his extra 
expenses so incurred, exceptions to be made only for suffi- 
cient reasons. This is to be the unique central and indis- 
pensable condition of any work in China, the foundation 
and basis of the whole system, as will be seen in the develop- 
ment of scheme. Among the advantages of this require- 
ment are the following: 
(a) Physicians in China are greatly overworked. The 
change of employment from toil and worry to study later 
knowledge, better skill; from loneliness to stimulating com- 
panionship, will afford the most delightful recreation pos- 
sible to a rightly constituted man. Every condition of 
physical and mental refreshment is here met. 
(b) The physician will keep up with, apply and use the 
latest medical science. This is nowhere in the world done 
by any body of practising physicians, and if continued will, 
in no long time, give the favored region the best body of 
practising physicians on earth. 
(c) The whole body of practising physicians poured 
annually through the college will bring to the medical 
school annually an immense fund of practical information 
and afford the most valuable guide in practical instruction. 
(d) This large body of practising physicians constantly 
in attendance will compel a very high, indeed the highest 
attainable, excellence in teaching. 
(e) From this large concourse of annual students, there 
will emerge from time to time men of talent, skill, even 
genius, 7. e., certain men by force of talent, skill or attain- 
ment, will stand out far preéminent. From these a corps 
of teachers can gradually be built up of the very highest 
excellence. 
(f) These men, thus mingling together annually for 
higher skill and attainment, will come at length to have a 
corporate life, anespritde corps, a spirit of corporate achieve- 
ment, which will animate and inspire every member. 
(g) Ie should be the conscious duty of every man to 
select one or more of the most promising Chinese boys
-P-A-G-E-212
212 MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 
under his control, and fit, or see that others fit, him properly 
for scientific medicine and bring him to the central medical 
school. This brings us to another simultaneous factor in 
our system. 
(5) These medical missionaries, so trained and so charged, 
are to be made active agents in making the present schools 
and colleges in their respective spheres of influence 
efficient preparatory schools for Chinese medical students, 
efficient in spirit, in method, in extent of instruction. It 
is on this side of scientific study and preparation that the 
Foundation will come into relation with the missionary 
schools. In so faras practicable the Foundation will assist 
selected schools to meet the requirements. 
(6) Concurrently with these steps, the Foundation will 
establish proper nurses’ training schools for men and 
noe always, of course, in connection with large hos- 
pitals. 
General Remarks 
It will be observed— 
(1) That this plan is a unit with simultaneous inter- 
play of necessary parts. 
(2) That as such unit, it covers a single large province 
only, with a great central medical school having a full 
complement of outlying stations, hospitals, practitioners, 
and preparatory schools. 
(3) That within the chosen area the plan organizes into 
one present organic whole, the work and growth of many 
decades, every man, every dollar, every institution, every 
item of equipment now existing for medical work, without 
loss or waste; that it subordinates all to one center of en- 
lightenment and power in which all denominations unite; 
that provision is made for the best instruction in this 
center, constantly stimulated by western experts. It pro- 
vides that the practitioners shall, by three months’ study 
annually in this center, keep themselves and the school up 
to the highest pitch of enthusiasm and efficiency, and 
finally through a system of schools made fit, and through a 
careful local selection of fit students annually, it provides 
for the education of an annually increasing supply of scien- 
tific Chinese physicians.

  THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 213 
Step IV. Asthe system proves practicable and efficient, 
we may extend it to other similar centers, or it will perhaps 
extend itself, and China will be in a fair way ultimately to 
lead the world in medicine; for today no land, whether in 
America or Europe, has any system of medicine at all 
comparable in efficiency or promise. 
The plan also utilizes to the full through generous co- 
operation with the missionary boards the whole power of 
Christian sentiment in this and other lands and enlists this 
sentiment in greater practical service. We should enter 
into definite and detailed contractual relations with the 
boards, using their organization and agencies helpfully and 
sympathetically and joining with them in choice of a local 
agency of control. 
This plan promises also the largest economic advantages. 
It will awaken enthusiasm at home; it will command con- 
fidence abroad. Already far more than half the whole, 
expense is borne abroad, and we may confidently hope that 
the resulting skill, efficiency, and power will quickly render 
the system self-supporting on Chinese soil, even though the 
initial expenditure may be considerable.

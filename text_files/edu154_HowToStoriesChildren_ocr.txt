  PREFACE 
Tux stories which are given in the following 
pages are for the most part those which I have 
found to be best liked by the children to whom 
I have told these and others. I have tried to 
reproduce the form in which I actually tell 
them, — although that inevitably varies with 
every repetition, — feeling that it would be 
of greater value to another story-teller than a 
more closely literary form. 
For the same reason, I have confined my 
statements of theory as to method, to those 
which reflect my own experience ; my “rules” 
were drawn from introspection and retrospec- 
tion, at the urging of others, long after the 
instinctive method they exemplify had become 
habitual. 
These facts are the basis of my hope that 
the book may be of use to those who have 
much to do with children. 
It would be impossible, in the space of any 
pardonable preface, to name the teachers, mo- 
thers, and librarians who have given me hints

and helps during the past few years of story- 
telling. But I cannot let these pages go to 
press without recording my especial indebted- 
ness to the few persons without whose inter- 
ested aid the little book would scarcely have 
come to be. They are: Mrs. Elizabeth Young 
Rutan, at whose generous instance I first en- 
larged my own field of entertaining story-tell- 
ing to include hers, of educational narrative, 
and from whom I had many valuable sugges- 
tions at that time; Miss Ella L. Sweeney, as- 
sistant superintendent of schools, Providence, 
R. I., to whom I owe exceptional opportuni- 
ties for investigation and experiment; Mrs. 
Root, children’s librarian of Providence Public 
Library, and Miss Alice M. Jordan, Boston 
Public Library, children’s room, to whom I 
am indebted for much gracious and efficient 
aid. 
My thanks are due also to G. P. Putnam’s 
Sons, New York and London, for permission

INTRODUCTION 
Nor long ago, I chanced to open a magazine 
at a story of Italian life which dealt with a 
curious popular custom. It told of the love of 
the people for the performances of a strangely 
clad, periodically appearing old man who was 
a professional story-teller. This old man re- 
peated whole cycles of myth and serials of 
popular history, holding his audience-chamber 
in whatever corner of the open court or square 
he happened upon, and always surrounded by 
an eager crowd of listeners. So great was the 
respect in which the story-teller was held, that 
any interruption was likely to be resented with 
violence. 
As I read of the absorbed silence and the 
changing expressions of the crowd about the 
_ old man, I was suddenly reminded of a com- 
pany of people I had recently seen. They were 
gathered in one of the parlors of a women’s 
college, and their serious young faces had, 
habitually, none of the childlike responsiveness 
of the Italian populace; they were suggestive, 
a
-P-A-G-E-14
xiv INTRODUCTION 
rather, of a daily experience which precluded 
over-much surprise or curiosity about anything. 
In the midst of the group stood a frail-looking 
woman with bright eyes. She was telling a 
story, a children’s story, about a good and a 
bad little mouse. 
She had been asked to do that thing, for a 
purpose, and she did it, therefore. But it was 
easy to see from the expressions of the listeners 
how trivial a thing it seemed to them. 
That was at first. But presently the room 
grew quieter; and yet quieter. The faces re- 
laxed into amused smiles, sobered in uncon- 
scious sympathy, finally broke in ripples of 
mirth. The story-teller had come to her own. 
The memory of the college girls listening to 
the mouse-story brought other memories with 
it. Many a swift composite view of faces passed 
before my mental vision, faces with the child’s 
look on them, yet not the faces of children. 
And of the occasions to which the faces be- 
longed, those were most vivid which were ear- 
liest in my experience. For it was those early 
experiences which first made me realize the - 
modern possibilities of the old, old art of tell 
ing stories. 
It had become a part of my work, some 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION xv 
years ago, to give English lectures on German 
literature. Many of the members of my class 
were unable to read in the original the works 
with which I dealt, and as these were modern 
works it was rarely possible to obtain transla- 
tions. For this reason, I gradually formed the 
habit of telling the story of the drama or novel 
in question before passing to a detailed con- 
sideration of it. I enjoyed this part of the les- 
son exceedingly, but it was some time before I 
realized how much the larger part of the lesson 
it had become to the class. They used — and 
they were mature women—+to wait for the story 
as if it were a sugar-plum and they children ; 
and to grieve openly if it was omitted. Sub- 
stitution of reading from a translation was 
greeted with precisely the same abatement of 
eagerness that a child shows when he has asked 
you to tell a story, and you offer, instead, to 
“read one from the pretty book.” And so 
general and constant were the tokens of enjoy- 
ment that there could ultimately be no doubt 
of the power which the mere story-telling ex- 
erted. 
The attitude of the grown-up listeners did 
but illustrate the general difference between 
the effect of telling a story and of reading one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
xvi INTRODUCTION 
Every one who knows children well has telt 
the difference. With few exceptions, children 
listen twice as eagerly to a story told as to one 
read, and even a “ recitation” or a so-called 
“yeading” has not the charm for them that 
the person wields who can “ tell a story.” And 
there are sound reasons for their preference. 
The great difference, including lesser ones, 
between telling and reading is that the teller 
is free; the reader is bound. The book in 
hand, or the wording of it in mind, binds the 
reader. The story-teller is bound by nothing ; 
he stands or sits, free to watch his audience, 
free to follow or lead every changing mood, 
free to use body, eyes, voice, as aids in ex- 
pression. Even his mind is unbound, because 
he lets the story come in the words of the 
moment, being so full of what he has to say. 
For this reason, a story told is more sponta- 
neous than one read, however well read. And, 
consequently, the connection with the audience 
is closer, more electric, than is possible when 
the book or its wording intervenes. 
Beyond this advantage, is the added charm 
of the personal element in story-telling. When 
you make a story your own and tell it, the lis- 
tener gets the story, plus your appreciation 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
   INTRODUCTION xvii 
of it. It comes to him filtered through your 
own enjoyment. That is what makes the funny 
story thrice funnier on the lips of a jolly ra- 
conteur than in the pages of “Life.” Itis the 
filter of personality. Everybody has some 
thing of the curiosity of the primitive man 
concerning his neighbor ; what another has in 
his own person felt and done has an especial 
hold on each one of us. The most cultured of 
audiences will listen to the personal reminis- 
cences of an explorer with a different tingle 
of interest from that which it feels for a scien- _ 
tific lecture on the results of the exploration. 
The longing for the personal in experience is 
a very human longing. And this instinct or 
longing is especially strong in children. It 
finds expression in their delight in tales of what 
father or mother did when they were little, of 
what happened to grandmother when she went 
on a journey, and so on, but it also extends to 
stories which are not in themselves personal : 
which take their personal savor merely from 
the fact that they flow from the lips in spon- 
taneous, homely phrases, with an appreciative 
gusto which suggests participation. 
The greater ease in holding theattention of 
children is, for teachers, a sufficient practical

        xviii INTRODUCTION 
reason for telling stories rather than reading 
them. It is incomparably easier to make the 
necessary exertion of “magnetism,” or what- 
ever it may be called, when nothing else dis- 
tracts the attention. One’s eyes meet the 
children’s gaze naturally and constantly ; one’s 
expression responds to and initiates theirs with- 
out effort ; the connection is immediate. For 
the ease of the teacher, then, no less than for 
the joy of the children, may the art of story- 
telling be urged as preéminent over the art of 
reading. 
It is a very old, a very beautiful art. To 
think much of it carries one’s imaginary vision 
to scenes of glorious and touching antiquity. 
The tellers of the stories of which Homer’s 
Iliad was compounded ; the transmitters of 
the legend and history which make up the 
“Gesta Romanorum ;” the traveling racon- 
teurs whose brief heroic tales are woven into 
our own national epic ; the grannies of age-old 
tradition whose stories are parts of Celtic folk- 
lore, of Germanic myth, of Asiatic wonder- 
tales, — these are but younger brothers and 
sisters to the generations of story-tellers whose 
inventions are but vaguely outlined in result- 
ant forms of ancient literatures, and the names

of whose tribes are no longer even guessed. 
There was a time when story-telling was the 
chiefest of the arts of entertainment; kings 
and warriors could ask for nothing better ; 
serfs and children were satisfied with nothing 
less. In all times there have been occasional’ 
revivals of this pastime, and in no time has the 
art died out in the simple human realms of 
which mothers are queens. But perhaps never, 
since the really old days, has story-telling so 
nearly reached a recognized level of dignity 
as a legitimate and general art of entertain- 
ment as now. 
Its present popularity seems in a way to be 
an outgrowth of the recognition of its educa- 
tional value which was given impetus by the 
German pedagogues of Froebel’s school. That 
recognition has, at all events, been a notice- 
able factor in educational conferences of late. 
The function of the story is no longer con- 
sidered solely in the light of its place in the 
kindergarten ; it is being sought in the first, 
the second, and indeed in every grade where 
the children are still children. Sometimes the 
demand for stories is made solely in the in- 
terests of literary culture, sometimes in far 
ampler and vaguer relations, ranging from
-P-A-G-E-20
xx INTRODUCTION 
inculcation of scientific fact to admonition of 
moral theory ; but whatever the reason given, 
the conclusion is the same: tell the children 
stories. 
The average teacher has yielded to the 
pressure, at least in theory. Cheerfully, as she 
. has already accepted so many modifications of 
old methods by “new thought,” she accepts 
the idea of instilling mental and moral deside- 
rata into the receptive pupil, via the charm- 
ing tale. But, confronted with the concrete 
problem of what desideratum by which tale, 
and how, the average teacher sometimes finds 
her cheerfulness displaced by a sense of inad- 
equacy to the situation. 
People who have always told stories to 
children, who do not know when they began 
or how they do it; whose heads are stocked 
with the accretions of years of fairy-land- 
dwelling and nonsense-sharing, — these can- 
not understand the perplexity of one to whom 
the gift and the opportunity have not “ come 
natural.” But there are many who can under- 
stand it, personally and all too well. To these, 
the teachers who have not a knack for story- 
telling, who feel as shy as their own youngest 
scholar at the thought of it, who do not know

where the good stories are, or which ones are

reference. :

       HOW TO TELL STORIES TO 
CHILDREN 
CHAPTER I 
THE PURPOSE OF STORY-TELLING, IN SCHOOL 
Ler us first consider together the primary 
- matter of the aim in educational story-telling. 
On our conception of this must depend very 
largely all decisions as to choice and method ; 
and nothing in the whole field of discussion 
is more vital than a just and sensible notion 
of this first point. What shall we attempt 
to accomplish by stories inthe schoolroom ? 
What can we reasonably expect to accom- 
plish? And what, of this, is best accom- 
plished by this means and no other? 
These are questions which become the more 
interesting and practical because the recent 
.. access of enthusiasm for stories in education 
‘has led many people to claim very wide and 
very vaguely outlined territory for their pos- 
session, Yind often to lay heaviest stress on 
a

  their least essential functions. Thi: most im- 
portant instance of this is the tervor with’ 
which_many compilers of stories for school 
use ily otced Pardue oe lely toward 
-illustration of natural phenomena. Geology, 
zoology, botany, and even physics are taught 
by means of more or less happily constructed 
narratives based on the simpler facts of these 
sciences. Kindergartners are especially fa- 
miliar with such narratives: the little stories 
of chrysalis-breaking, flower-growth, and the 
like. Now this is a perfectly proper and prac- 
ticable aim, but it is not a primary one. 
Others, to which at best this is but secondary, 
should have first place and receive greatest 
attention. 
What is a story, essentially? Is it a text- 
book of science, an appendix to the geography, 
an introduction to the primer of history? 
Of course it is not. A story _is essentially 
and primarily gwerk-of=art, and its chief 
function must be~sought-in the line of the 
oouses_of art. Just as the drama is capable of 
secondary uses, yet fails abjectly to realize its 
purpose when those are substity 2d for its re al 
significance as a work of art, so does the stor'y 
lend itself to subsidiary purposes, LY claims  
-P-A-G-E-25
ei a id a a i 
THE PURPOSE OF STORY-TELLING 3 
first ana most strongly to be recognized in its 
real significance as a work of art. Since the 
drama deals with life in all its parts, it can 
exemplify sociological theory, it can illustrate 
economic principle, it can even picture politics ; 
but the drama which does these things only, 
has no breath of its real life in its being, and 
dies when the wind of popular tendency veers 
from its direction. So, you can teach a child 
interesting facts about bees and butterflies by 
telling him certain stories, and you can open 
his eyes to colors and processes in nature by 
telling certain others ; but unless you do some- 
thing | more than that and before that, you are 
as one who should use the Venus of Melos for 
a demonstration in anatomy. 
The message of the story is = message of 
\ beauty, as effective as that m i 
or paint. Its part in the y ob life is to ——— Ree gw And the purpose aun working of 
6 joy a found in that quickening of the 
spirit which answers every perception of the 
truly beautiful m the arts of man. To give 
~ joy ; in and through the joy to stir and feed 
the fe of the spirit: is not this the legiti- 
mate function of the story in education? 
; Beeausa I believe it to be such, not because 
 
-P-A-G-E-26

4 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Tignore the value of other uses, I venture to 
push aside all aims which seem secondary to 
this for later mention under specific heads. 
Here in the beginning of our consideration I 
wish to emphasize this element alone. _A story 
is a work of art) Its greatest use to the child 
is in the everlasting appeal of beauty by which 
the soul of man is constantly pricked to new 
hungers, quickened to new perceptions, and 
so given desire to grow. 
The obvious practical bearing of this is that 
story-telling is first of all an art of entertain- 
ment; like the stage, its immediate purpose is 
the ple pleasure of the hearer, — his pleasure, not 
his instruction, first. 
Now the story-teller who has given the 
listening children such pleasure as I mean may 
or may not have added a fact to the content of 
their minds ; she has inevitably added some- 
thing to the vital powers of their souls. She 
has given a wholesome exercise to the emo- 
tional muscles of the spirit, has opened up 
new windows to the imagination, and added 
some line or color to the ideal of life and «ti 
which is always taking form in the he.rt of a 
child; She has, in short, accomplishe:/ the one 
i greatest aim of story-telling, — a and
-P-A-G-E-27
THE PURPOSE OF STORY-TELLING 5 
enrich the child’s spiritual experience, and 
eee reactor iene course this result cannot be seen and 
proved as easily and early as can the appre- 
hension of a fact. The most one can hope to 
recognize is its promise, and this is found in 
the tokens of that genuine pleasure which is 
itself the means of accomplishment. It.is, then, _ ( 
the signs of right pleasure which the story- 
teller must look to for her guide, and which it 
must be her immediate aim to evoke. As for 
the recognition of the signs, — no one who 
has ever seen the delight of a real child over 
a real story can fail to know the signals when 
given, or flatter himself into belief in them 
when absent. 
Intimately connected with the enjoyment 
given are two very practically beneficent results 
which the story-teller may hope to obtain, and 
at least one of which will be a kind of reward _ 
to herself. The first first is arelaxation of the tenset 
school-room atmosphere, valuable for its re- 
FReSbiag Fooreative pow ver. The second result, 
or aim, is not so obvious, but is even more 
desirable ; it is this { story-telling is at once 
one of of the simplest ani “quickest_w ways of estab- 
a happy relation between teacher and

   6 4 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
children, and one of the most effective methods 
of forming the habit of fixed attention in the 
latter. 
Hf you have never seen an indifferent child 
aroused or a hostile one conquered to affection 
by a beguiling tale, you can hardly appreciate 
the truth of the first statement; but nothing 
is more familiar in the story-teller’s experi- 
ence. An amusing, but — to me — touching 
experience recently reaffirmed in my mind this 
power of the story to establish friendly rela- 
tions, 
My three-year-old niece, who had not seen 
me since her babyhood, being told that Aunt 
Sara was coming to visit her, somehow confused. 
the expected guest with a more familiar aunt, 
my sister. At sight of me, her rush of welcome 
relapsed into a puzzled and hurt withdrawal, 
which yielded to no explanations or proffers of 
auntly affection. All the first day she followed 
me about at a wistful distance, watching me 
as if I might at any moment turn into the well- 
known and beloved relative I ought to have 
been. Even by undressing time I had not pro- 
gressed far enough to be allowed intimate a,\~ 
proach to small sacred night-gowns and diminu- 
tive shirts. The next morning, when I opene

the door of the nursery where her maid was 
brushing her hair, the same dignity radiated 
from the little round figure perched on its high 
chair, the same almost hostile shyness gazed at 
me from the great expressive eyes. Obviously, 
it was time for something to be done. 
Disregarding my lack of invitation, I drew 
up a stool, and seating myself opposite the 
small unbending person, began in a conver- 
sational murmur: “ M—m, I guess those are 
tingly-tanglies up there in that curl Lottie’s 
combing ; did you ever hear about the tingly- 
tanglies? They live in little girls’ hair, and 
they are n’t any bigger than that, and when 
anybody tries to comb the hair they curl both 
weeny legs round, so, and hold on tight with 
both weeny hands, so, and won’t let go!” As 
I paused, my niece made a queer little sound 
indicative of query battling with reserve. I 
pursued the subject: “They like best to live 
right over a little girl’s ear, or down in her 
neck, because it is easier to hang on, there; 
tingly-tanglies are very smart, indeed.” 
“ What’s ti-ly-ta-lies?” asked a curious, 
guttural little voice. 
I explained the nature and genesis of tingly- 
tanglies, as revealed to me some decades before 
      }

  by my inventive mother, and proceeded to de- 
velop their simple a@ventures. When next I 
paused the small guttural voice demanded, 
“ Say more,” and I joyously obeyed. 
When the curls were all curled and the last 
little button buttoned, my baby niece climbed 
hastily down from her chair, and deliberately 
up into my lap. With a caress rare to her 
habit she spoke my name, slowly and tenta- 
tively, “ An-ty Sai-ry ?” Then, in an assured 
tone, “ Anty Sairy, I love you so much I don’ 
know what to do!” And, presently, tucking 
a confiding hand in mine to lead me to break- 
fast, she explained sweetly, “I didn’ know 
you when you comed las’ night, but now I 
know you all th’ time!” 
“Oh, blessed tale,” thought I, “so easy a 
passport to a confidence so desired, so com- 
plete!” Never had the witchery of the story 
to the ear of a child come more closely home 
to me. But the fact of the witchery was no 
new experience. The surrender of the natuzal 
child to the story-teller is as absolute and in- 
variable as that of a devotee to the priest of 
his own sect. 
This power is especially valuable in the case 
of children whose natural shyness has bepn

THE PURPOSE OF STORY-TELLING 9 
augmented by rough environment or by the“ 
strangeness of foreign habit. And with such 
children even more than with others.is it also 
true that the story is a simple and _ effective 
means of forming the habit of concentration, 
of fixed attention ; any teacher who deals with 
this class ‘of ree knows the difficulty of 
doing this fundamental and indispensable 
thing, and the value of any practical aid in 
doing it. 
More than one instance of the power of 
story-telling to develop attentiveness comes to 
my mind, but the most prominent in memory 
js a rather recent incident, in which the actors 
were boys and girls far past the child-stage of

~I had been asked to tell stories to about 
sixty boys and girls of a settlement club; the 
president warned me in her invitation that the 
_ children were exceptionally undisciplined, but 
my previous experiences with similar gath- 
erings led me to interpret her words with a 
moderation which left me totally unready for 
the reality. When I faced my audience, I saw 
a squirming jumble of faces, backs of heads, 
and the various members of many small bodies, 
— not a person in the room was paying the

slightest attention to me; the president’s in- 
troduction could scarcely be said to succeed in 
interrupting the interchange of social ameni- 
ties which was in progress, and which looked 
deljusively like a free fight. I came as near 
stage fright in the first minutes of that occa- 
sion as it is comfortable to be, and if it had 
not been impossible to run away I think I 
should not have remained. But I began, with 
Ee as funny a tale as I knew, following the safe 
w Plan of not speuking very loudly, and aiming 
“my effort at the nearest children. As I went 
on, a very few faces held intelligently to mine ; 
the majority answered only fitfully ; and nota 
few of my hearers conversed with their neigh« 
bors as if my presence were non-existent. The 
sense of baftlement, the futile effort, forced 
the sweat to my hands and face — yet some- 
thing in the faces before me told me that it 
was no ill-will that fought against me; it 
was the apathy of minds without the power 
or habit of concentration, unable to follow a 
sequence of ideas any distance, and rendered 
more restless by bodies which were probably 
uncomfortable, certainly. undisciplined. 
The first story took ten minutes. When I 
began a second, a very short one, the initial 
-

work “ad to be done all over again, for the 
slight omparative quiet I had won had been 
totally lost in the resulting manifestation of 
approval. 
At the end of the second story, the room 
was really orderly to the superficial view, but 
where I stood I could see the small boy who 
deliberately made a hideous face at me each 
time my eyes met his, the two girls who talked 
with their backs turned, the squirms of a 
figure here and there. It seemed.so disheart- 
ening a record of failure that I hesitated much 
to yield to the uproarious request for a third 
story, but finally I did begin again, on a very 
lung story which for its own sake I wanted 
them to hear. 
This time the little audience settled to atten- 
tion almost at the opening words. After about 
five minutes I was suddenly conscious of a 
sense of ease and relief, a familiar restful feel- 
ing in the atmosphere; and then, at last, I 
knew that my audience was “ with me,” that 
they and I were interacting without obstruc- 
ticn. Absolutely quiet, entirely unconscious 
of themselves, the boys and girls were respond- 
ing to every turn of the narrative as easily and 
readily as any group of story-bred kindergax- THE PURPOSE OF STORY-TELLING

ten children. From then on we had a good 
time together. 
The process which took place in that small 
audience was a condensed example of what 
one may expect in habitual story-telling to a 
, group of children. Once having had the atten- 
“tion chained by crude force_of interest, the 
aiinaien beg expo something interesting 
from ‘the teacher, and to wait fer it. And 
having been led step by step from one grade 
of a logical sequence to another, their minds 
—at first beguiled by the fascination of the 
steps — glide into the habit of following any 
logical sequence. My club formed its habit, as 
far as I was concerned, all in one session ; the 
ordinary demands of school procedure lengthen 
the process, but the result is equally sure. 
By the end of a week in which the children 
have listened happily to a story every day, the 
habit of listening and deducing —has- been 
formed, and the expectation of pleasantness is 
connected-with the -opening “of the’ teacher’s 
lips. 4 , 
These two benefits are well worth the trou sle 
they cost, and for these two, at least, my 
teacher who tells a story well may confidently

ith the children, and the gradual 
deve: opment of concentration and interested 
attention in them. 
These are direct and somewhat clearly dis- 
cernible results, comfortably placed in a near 
future. There are other aims, reaching on into 
the far, slow modes of psychological growth, 
which must equally determine the choice of 
the story-teller’s material and inform the spirit 
of her work. These other, less immediately 
attainable ends, I wish now to consider in-re- 
lation to the different types of story by which 
they are severally best served. 
First, unbidden claimant of attention, comes 
THE FAIRY STORY. 
No one can think of a child and a story, 
without thinking of the fairy tale. Is this, as 
some would have us believe, a bad habit of an 
ignorant old world? Or can the Fairy Tale 
justify her popularity with truly edifying and 
educational results? Is she a proper person 
to introduce here, and what are her titles te 
merit ?

grandmother of every child in the world, and 
her pocketfuls of treasures are his by right 
of inheritance. Shut her out, and you truly 
rob the children of something which is theirs ; 
something marking their constant kinship with 
the race-children_ofthe-past, and adapted to 
their needs as it was to those of the latter. If 
there were no other criterion at all, it would 
be enough that the children love the fairy 
tale ; (we -give them fairy stories, first, because 
Nas they like them) But that by no means lessens 
the importance of the fact that fairy tales are

is aware only of the image at the time, the 
truth enters with ian’ becomes a part of his 
individual experience, to be recognized in its 
relations at a later « ‘age. Every truth and 
type so given broadeis and deepens the ca- 
pacity of the child’s inner life, and adds an 
element to the store from which he draws-his 
moral inferences. 
The most familiar instance of a moral truth 
conveyed under a fairy-story image is probably 
the story of the pure-hearted and loving girl 
whose lips were touched with the wonderful 
power of dropping jewels with every spoken 
word, while her step-sister, whose heart was 
infested with malice and evil desires, let ugly 
toads fall from her mouth whenever she spoke. 
I mention the old tale because there is prob- 
ably no one of my readers who has not heard 
it in childhood, and because there are undoubt- 
edly many to whose mind it has often recurred 
in later life as a sadly perfect presentment of 
the fact that “out of the abundance of the 
heart the mouth speaketh.” That story has 
entered into the forming consciousness of many 
of us. with its implications of the inevitable 
result of visible evil from evil in the heart, 
       
-P-A-G-E-38

and its revelation of the loathsémeness of evil 
itself. 
And no less truly than this story has served 
to many as an embodiment of moral law has 
another household ta’ stood for a type of 
‘common experience. ow much the poorer 
shouid we be, mentall; , without our early pro- 
phecy of the “ ugly ducklings” we are to meet 
later in life!—those awkward offspring of 
our little human duckyard who are mostly well 
kicked and buffeted about, for that very length 
of limb and breadth of back which needs must 
be, to support swan’s wings. The story of the 
ugly duckling is much truer than many a bald 
statement of fact. The English-speaking world 
bears witness to its verity in constant use of 
the title as an identifying phrase: “It is the 
old story of the ugly duckling,” we say, or 
“He has turned out a real ugly duckling.” 
And we know that our hearers understand the 
whole situation. 
The consideration of such familiar types 
and expressions as that of the ugly duckling 
suggests immediately another good reason for 
giving the child his due of fairy lore- The 
reason is that to omit it is to deprive him of 
one important element in the full appreciation

of mature litesiflire. If one thinks of it, one 
sees that nearly all adult literature is made by 
people who, in their beginnings, were bred up 
on the wonder tale. Whether he will or nof 
the grown-up author must incorporate into his 
work the tendencies, memories, kinds of feel- 
ing which were his in childhood. The litera-/,, ) 
ture of maturity is, naturally, permeated b 
the influence of the literature of childhood. . 
Sometimes it is apparent merely in the use. of 
a name, as suggestive of certain kinds of ex- 
‘perience; such are the recurrences of refer- 
ence to the Cinderella story. Sometimes it is © 
an allusion which has its strength in long asso-"

these are just, the things which really count. 
Leaving ott the fairy element i in literary cul-

adult literature is “permeated by the influence 
of these, familiar in youth, so in less degree is. 
it transfused with the subtile reminiscences of 
childhood’s commerce with the wonder world. 
To turn now from the inner to the outer 
aspects of the old-time tale is to meet another

Fox, and the cruelty of Brother Wolf. Some-’ 
times the association of ideas lies below the 
surface, drawing from the hidden wells of poetic 
illusion which are sunk in childhood. The man 
or woman whose infancy was nourished exclu 
sively on tales adapted from science-made-easy, 
or from biographies of good men and great,

CHAPTER IT 
SELECTION OF STORIES TO TELL 
  THERE is one picture which I can always re- 
view, in my own collection of past scenes, 
though many a more highly colored one has 
been irrevocably curtained by the folds of for- 
getfulness. It is the picture of a little girl, 
standing by an old-fashioned marble-topped 
dressing-table in a pink, sunny room. I can 
never see the little girl’s face, because, some- 
how, I am always looking down at her short 
skirts or twisting my head round against the 
hand which patiently combs her stubborn 
curls. But I can see the brushes and combs 
on the marble table quite plainly, and the 
pinker streaks of sun on the pink walls. And 
“Ican hear. I can hear a low, wonder-working 
voice which goes smoothly on and on, as the 
fingers run up the little girl’s locks or stroke 
the hair into place on her forehead. The voice 
says, “ And little Goldilocks came to a little 
bit of a house. And she opened the door and 
went in. It was the house where three Bears

and a middle-sized Bear; and they had gone 
out for a walk. Goldilocks went in, and she 
saw ”’ — the little girl is very still; she would 
not disturb that story by so much as a loud 
breath ; but presently the comb comes to a 
tangle, pulls, —and the litile girl begins to 
squirm. Instantly the voice becomes impres- 
sive, mysterious: “she went up to the table,

and waits — “and it was too hot! She tasted 
the next one, and that was too bet Then she 
tasted the little bit of a plate, ‘and that — was 
— just — right!” 
How I remember the delightful sense of 
achievement which stole into the little girl’s 
veins when the voice behind her said “ just 
right.” I think she always chuckled a little, 
and hugged her stomach. So the story pro- 
gressed, and the little girl got through her 
toilet without crying, owing to the wonder-

climaxes to emergencies. Nine times out of

HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Inasmuch as the slightest of the things we 
hope to do for children by means of stories is 
quite impossible unless the children enjoy the 
stories, it may be worth our while to consider 
seriously these three which they surely do en- 
joy, to see what common qualities are in them, 
explanatory of their popularity, by which we 
may test the probable success of other stories 
we wish to tell. 
Here they are,— three prime favorites of 
proved standing. 
  THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.1 
There were once three little pigs, who started 
out to seek their fortune. The first that went 
off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said 
to him: — : 
“ Please, man, give me that straw to build 
me a house.” 
Which the man did, and the little pig built 
a house with it. Presently came along a wolf, 
and knocked at the door, and said : — 
“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” 
To which the pig answered : — 
“No, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin.”

The wolf then answered to that : — 
“Then Ill huff, and I’ll puff, and I'll 
blow your house in.” 
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew 
his house in, and ate up the little pig. 
The second little pig met a man with a 
bundle of furze, and said : — 
“ Please, man, give me that furze to build 
a house.” 
Which the man did, and the pig built his 
house. Then along came the wolf, and said : 
“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” 
“No, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin- 
chin.” | 
“ Then I'll puff, and Ill huff, and I’ll blow | 
your house in.” 
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed 
and he huffed, and at last he blew the house 
down, and he ate up the little pig. 
The third little pig met a man with a load 
of bricks, and said : — 
“ Please, man, give me those bricks to build 
a house with.” ‘ 
So the man gave him the bricks, and he 
built his house with them. So the wolf came, 
as he did to the other little pigs, and said : — 
“ Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”

“ No,no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin.”* 
“ Then I’ll huff, and I'll puff, and Ill blow 
your house in.” 
Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he 
huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and 
huffed ; but he could not get the house down. 
When he found that he could not, with all his 
huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he 
said : — 
“Little pig, I know where there is a nice 
field of turnips.” 
“ Where ?” said the little pig. 
“Oh, in Mr. Smith’s home-field, and if you 
will be ready to-morrow morning I will call 
for you, and we will go together, and get some 
for dinner.” 
“Very well,” said the little pig, “1 will be 
ready. What time do you mean to go?” 
“Oh, at six o’clock.” 
Well, the little pig got up at five, and got 
the turnips before the wolf came (which he did 
about six) and said : — 
“ Little pig, are you ready ?” 
The little pig said: “Ready! I have been 
and come back again, and got a nice potful 
for dinner.” 
The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought

that he would be up to the little pig somehow 
or other, so he said : — 
“Little pig, 1 know where there is a nice 
apple-tree.” 
“ Where ?” said the pig. 
“ Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, 
“and if you will not deceive me I will come 
for you, at five o’clock to-morrow, and get 
some apples.” 
Well, the little pig bustled up the next 
morning at four o’clock, and went off for the 
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf 
came; but he had further to go, and had to 
climb the tree, so that just as he was coming 
down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, 
as you may suppose, frightened him very much. 
When the wolf came up he said : — 
“Tittle pig, what! are you here before me? 
Are they nice apples?” 
“Yes, very,” said the little pig. “I will 
throw you down one.” 
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf 
was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped 
down and ran home. The next day the wolf 
came again, and said to the little pig : — 
“Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this 
afternoon; will you go?”     SELECTION OF STORIES

   36 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
“Oh, yes,” said the pig, “I will go; what 
time shall you be ready ?” 
“ At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig 
went off before the time, as usual, and got to 
the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he 
was going home with when he saw the wolf 
coming. Then he could not tell what to do. 
So he got into the churn to hide, and by so 
doing turned it round, and it rolled down the 
hill with the pig in it, which frightened the 
wolf so much that he ran home without going 
to the fair. He went to the little pig’s house, 
and told him how frightened he had been by 
a great round thing which came down the hill 
past him. Then the little pig said : — 
“ Hah, I frightened you, then! I had been 
to the fair and bought a butter-churn, and 
when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down 
the hill.” 
Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and 
declared he would eat up the little pig, and 
that he would get down the chimney after him. 
When the little pig saw what he was about, 
he hung on the pot full of water, and made 
up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was 
coming down, took off the cover, and ‘n fell 
the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover

THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS* 
Once upon a time there were Three Bears, 
who lived together in a house of their own, in 
a wood. One of them was a Little Small Wee 
Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and 
the other was a Great Huge Bear. They had 
each a pot for their porridge, —a little pot for 
the Little Small Wee Bear, and a middle- 
sized pot for the Middle-sized Bear, and a 
great pot for the Great Huge Bear. And 
they had each a chair to sit in, —a little chair 
for the Little Small Wee Bear, and a middle- 
sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear, and a 
great chair for the Great Huge Bear. And - 
they had each a bed to sleep in, —a little bed 
for the Little Small Wee Bear, and a middle- 
sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear, and a 
great bed for the Great Huge Bear. 
One day, after they had made the porridge 
for their breakfast, and poured it into their 
porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood 
while the porridge was cooling, that they

might not burn their mouths, by beginning too 
soon to eat it. And while they were walking, 
a little girl named Goldilocks came to the 
house. She had never seen the little house 
before, and it was such a strange little house 
that she forgot all the things her mother had 
told her about being polite : first she looked in 
at the window, and then she peeped in at the 
keyhole ; and seeing nobody in the house, she 
lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, 
because the Bears were good Bears, who did 
nobody any harm, and never suspected that 
anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks 
opened the door, and went in ; and well pleased 
she was when she saw the porridge on the 
table. If Goldilocks had remembered what 
her mother had told her, she would have waited 
till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, 
they would have asked her to breakfast; for 
they were good Bears — a little rough, as the 
- manner of Bears is, but for all that very good- 
natured and hospitable. But Goldilocks for- 
got, and set about helping herself. 
So first she tasted the porridge of the Great 
Huge Bear, and that was too hot. And then 
she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized 
Bear, and that was too cold. And then she
-P-A-G-E-63
  SELECTION OF STORIES 39 
went to the porridge of the Little Small Wee 
Bear, and tasted that; and that was neither 
too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she 
liked it so well, that she ate it all up. 
Then Goldilocks sat down in the chair of 
the Great Huge Bear, and that was too hard 
for her. And then she sat down in the chair 
of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too 
soft for her. And then she sat down in the 
chair of the Little Small Wee Bear, and that 
was neither too hard nor too soft, but just 
right. So she seated herself in it, and there 
she sat till the bottom of the chair came 
out, and down she came, plump upon the 
ground. 
Then Goldilocks went upstairs into the 
bed-chamber in which the Three Bears slept. 
And first she lay down upon the bed of the 
Great Huge Bear; but that was too high at 
the head for her. And next she lay down upon 
the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was 
too high at the foot for her. And then she 
lay down upon the bed of the Little Small 
Wee Bear; and that was neither too high at 
the head nor at the foot, but just right. 
So she covered herself up comfortably, and 
lay there till she fell fast asleep.

    40 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
By this time the Three Bears thought their 
porridge would be cool enough ; so they came 
home to breakfast. Now Goldilocks had left 
the spoon of the Great Huge Bear standing in 
his porridge. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY. 
PORRIDGE!” said the Great Huge Bear, in 
his great, rough, gruff voice. And when the 
Middle-sized Bear looked at his, he saw that 
the spoon was standing in it too. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY POR- 
RIDGE!” said the Middle-sized Bear in his 
middle-sized. voice. 
Then the Little Small Wee Bear looked 
at his, and there was the spoon in the por- 
ridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, 
AND HAS EATEN IT ALL uP!” said the Little 
Small Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee 
voice. 
Upon this, the Three Bears, seeing that 
some one had entered their house, and eaten 
up the Little Small Wee Bear’s breakfast, be- 
gan to look about them. Now Goldilocks had 
not put the hard cushion straight when she rose 
from the chair of the Great Huge Bear. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING
-P-A-G-E-65
  SELECTION OF STORIES 41 
IN MY CHAIR!” said the Great Huge 
Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. 
And Goldilocks had squatted down the soft 
cushion of the Middle-sized Bear. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY 
CHAIR!” said the Middle-sized Bear, in his 
middle-sized._ voice. 
And you know what Goldilocks had done 
to the third chair. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY 
CHAIR AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OF IT!” 
said the Little Small Wee Bear, in his little, 
small, wee voice. 
Then the Three Bears thought it necessary 
that they should make further search ; so they 
went upstairs into their bed-chamber. Now 
Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great 
Huge Bear out of its place. 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN 
MY BED!” said the Great Huge Bear, in his 
great, rough, gruff voice. 
And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the 
Middle-sized Bear out of its places 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY 
BED!” said the Middle-sized Bear, in his mid- 
dle-sized voice. 
And when the Little Small Wee Bear came
-P-A-G-E-66
    42 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its 
place; and the pillow in its place upon the 
bolster ; and upon the pillow was the shining, 
yellow hair of little Goldilocks ! 
“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED, 
—AND HERE sHE 18!” said the Little Small 
Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice. 
Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, 
rough, gruff voice of the Great Huge Bear; 
but she was so fast asleep that it was no more 
to her than the roaring of wind or the rum- 
bling of thunder. And she had heard the mid- 
dle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it 
was only as if she had heard some one speak- 
ing ina dream. But when she heard the little, 
small, wee voice of the Little Small Wee Bear, 
it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened 
her at once. Up she started, and when she saw 
the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she 
tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to 
the window. Now the window was open, be- 
cause the Bears, like good, tidy Bears as they 
were, always opened their bed-chamber window 
when they got up in the morning. ~ 
Out little Goldilocks jumped, and ran away 
home to her mother, as fast as ever she 
could. ‘

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG. 
An old woman was sweeping her house, and 
she found a little crooked sixpence. “‘ What,” 
said she, “shall I do with this little sixpence ? 
I will go to market, and buy a little pig.” 
As she was coming home, she came to a 
stile; but the piggy would n’t go over the stile. 
She went a little further, and she met a 
dog. So she said to him, “ Dog, dog, bite 
pig; piggy won’t go over the stile; and I 
shan’t get home to-night.” But the dog 
would n’t. 
She went a little further, and she met a 
stick. So she said: “Stick! stick! beat dog ! 
dog won’t bite pig; piggy won’t go over the 
stile; and I shan’t get home to-night.” But 
the stick would n’t. 
She went a little further, and she met a

stick won’t beat dog; dog won’t bite pig; 
piggy won’t get over the stile; and I shan’t

the old woman to the hay-stack; and she 
brought the hay to the cow. 
As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she

   that these pictures are made out of very sim: 
ple elements. The elements are either familiar xX 
to the child or analogous to familiar ones. 
Each_object and beeen is_very like every- 
day, yet touched with asubtle difference, rich 7 
in mystery.For example, the details of the ~ 
pictures in the Goldilocks story are parts of 
everyday life, — house, chairs, beds, and so on ; 
but they are the house, chairs, and beds of 
three bears; thatis the touch of marvel which 
transforms the scene. The old woman who 
owned the obstinate pig is the centre of a 
circle in which stand only familiar images, — 
stick, fire, water, cow, and the rest; but the 
wonder enters with the fact that these usually 
inanimate or dumb objects of nature enter so 
humanly into the contest of wills. So itis, also, 
with the doings of the three little pigs. Every , 
image is explicable to the youngest hearer, 
whi none suggests actual familiarity, because 
the actors are not children, but pigs. /Simpli- 
city, vi with _mystery, is the keynote of all the * 
pictures, and these are clear and distinct. 
~ Still a third characteristic common to the 
stories quoted 1 is a certain amount of repetition, 
It is more definite, and of where bok 
called the “cumulative” kind, in the story of
-P-A-G-E-72
    HOW TO TELL STORIES         
  the old woman; but in all it is a distinctive 
feature. 
Here we have, then, three marked charac- 
teristics common to three stories almost inva- 
riably loved by children, — action, in close se- ' 
‘quence ; famil familiar images, tinged wit h mystery ; 
( some me degree 0 of repetition. ford prt of 
ve t is not hard to see.w! y these qualities ap- 
a A peal to a child. The first is the prime charac- 
joer teristic of all good stories, —“ stories as is 
ben stories ;” the child’s demand for it but bears 
witness to the fact that his instinctive taste 
is often better than the taste he later develops 
under artificial culture. The second is a matter 
of common-sense. How could the imagination - 
create new worlds, save out of the material of 
the old? To offer strange images is to con- 
fuse the mind and dull the interest; to offer 
familiar ones “with a difference” is to pique 
the interest and engage the mind. 
The charm of repetition, to children, is a 
more complex matter; there are undoubtedly 
a good many elements entering into it, hard to 
trace in analysis. But one or two of the more 
obvious may be seized and brought to view. 
The first is the subtle flattery of an unexpected 
sense of mastery. When ‘the child-mind, fol-

         SELECTION OF STORIES 
lowing with toilful alertness a new train of 
thought, comes suddenly on a familiar epithet 
or expression, I fancy it is with much the 
same sense of satisfaction that we older people 
feel when in the midst of a long programme 
of new music the orchestra strikes into some- 
thing we have heard before,—Hindel, maybe, 
or one of the more familiar Beethoven sonatas. 
“T know that! I have heard that before!” 
we think, triumphant, and settle down to en- 
joyment without effort. So it is, probably, with 
the “middle-sized”’ articles of the bears’ house 
and the “and I shan’t get home to-night” of 
the old woman. Each recurrence deepens the 
larity, tickles the primitive sense 
of humor, an@ éases the strain of attention. 
When the repetition is cumulative, like the 
extreme instance of the “ House-that Jack 
Built,” I have a notion that the joy of the 
child is the pleasure of intellectual gymnastics, 
not too hard for fun, but not too easy for excite- 
ment. There is a deal of fun to be got out of 
purely intellectual processes, and childhood is 
not too soon for the rudiments of such fun to 
show. The delight the healthy adult mind 
takes in working out a neat problem in geo- 
metry, the pleasure a musician finds in follow-

ing the involutions of a fugue, are of the same 
type of satisfaction as the liking of children 
for cumulative stories. Complexity and mass, 
arrived at by stages perfectly intelligible in 
themselves, mounting steadily from a starting- 
point of simplicity ; then the same complexity 
and mass resolving itself as it were miracu- 
lously back into simplicity, this is an intellec- 
tual joy. It does not differ materially, whether 
found in the study of counterpoint, at thirty, 
or in the story of the old woman and her pig, 
at five. It is perfectly natural and wholesome, 
and it may perhaps be a more powerful devel- 
oping force for the budding intellect than we 
are aware. 
For these reasons let me urge you, when you 
are looking for stories to tell little children, to

No one can speak with absolute conviction in 
this matter, so greatly do the taste and capacity 
of children of the same age vary. A further 
difficulty is met if speaking of grade work in 
the schools in the fact that schools where 
foreign children predominate are on a different 
basis from, those made up of American chil- 
dren; the age is much higher, the grasp much 
lower. The following are merely the inferences 
drawn from my own experience. ‘They must be 
modified by each teacher according to the 
conditions of her small audience. In general, 
I believe it to be wise to plan the choice of 
stories about as indicated in the table given 
on page 53. 
In.the fifth grade, sometimes sooner, we find 
the temper of mind which asks continually, 
“Ts that true?”’ To meet this demand, one 
draws on historical and scientific anecdote, and 
on reminiscence. But the demand is never so

The dramatic climax toward which we are 
working is the outcome of August’s strange 
exploit, — his discovery by the king and the 
opportunity for him to become an artist. The 
joy of this climax is twofold: August may 
stay with his beloved Hirschvogel, and he may 
learn to make beautiful things like it. To 
arrive at the twofold conclusion we must start 
from a double premise, —the love of the stove 
and the yearning to be an artist. It will, then, 
be necessary to include in the beginning of 
the story enough details of the family life 
to show plainly how precious and necessary 
Hirschvogel was to the children; and to state 
definitely how August had learned to admire 
and wish to emulate Hirschvogel’s maker. We 
need no detail beyond what is necessary to 
make this clear. 3 
(The beginning and the end of a story de- 
cided upon, the body of it becomes the trip 
from one to the other} in this case it is 
August’s strange journey, beginning with 
the catastrophe and his grief-dazed decision 
to follow the stove. The journey is long, 
and each stage of it is told in full. As this 
is impossible in oral reproduction, it becomes 
necessary to choose typical incidents, whic! ADAPTATION OF STORIES

                                60 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
will give the same general effect_as the whole. 
The incidents which answer this purpose are: 
the beginning of the journey, the experience 
on the freight car, the jolting of being carried 
on men’s shoulders, the final fright and sus- 
pense before the king opens the door. 
The episode of the night in the bric-a-brac 
shop introduces a wholly new and confusing 
train of thought; therefore, charming as it is, 
it must be omitted. And the secondary thread 
of narrative interest, that of the prices for 
which the stove was sold, and the retribution 
visited on the cheating dealers, is also “another 
story,” and must be ignored. Each of these 
destroys the clear sequence and the simplicity 
of plot which must be kept for telling. 
We are reduced, then, for the whole, to this: 
a brief preliminary statement of the place 
Hirschvogel held in the household affections, 
and the ambition aroused in August ; the catas- 
trophe of the sale; August’s decision ; his ex- 
periences on the train, on the shoulders of 
men, and just before the discovery; his dis- 
covery, and the dénouement. 
This not only reduces the story to tellable 
form, but it also leaves a suggestive interest 
which heightens later enjoyment of the origi-

nce in the shape of an aged 
© kind reception by the younger 
Piuttle Gluck, and the subsequent wrath 
ans and Schwartz, with their resulting 
punishment, — occupies about two thousand 
words. The rest of the story deals with the 
three brothers after the decree of West Wind 
has turned Treasure Valley into a desert. In 
the little house where they are plying their 
trade of goldsmiths, the King of the Golden 
River appears to Gluck and tells him the magic 
secret of turning the river’s waters to gold. 
Hans and Schwartz in turn attempt the miracle, 
and in turn incur the penalty attached to fail- 
ure. Gluck tries, and wins the treasure through 
self-sacrifice. The form of the treasure is a re- 
newal of the fertility of Treasure Valley, and 
the moral of the whole story is summed up in 
Ruskin’s words, “So the inheritance which was 
lost by cruelty was regained by love.” 
It is easy to see that the dramatic part of 
the story and that which most pointedly illus- 
trates the underlying idea, is the triple attempt 
to win the treasure, — the two failures and 
the one success. But this is necessarily intro- 
duced by the episode of the King of the Golden

  ADAPTATION OF STORIES 62 
River, which is, also, an incident sure to appeal 
to a child’s imagination. And the regaining 
of the inheritance is meaningless without the 
fact of its previous loss, and the reason for the 
loss, as a contrast with the reason for its re- 
covery. We need, then, the main facts recorded 
in the first three thousand words. But the 
West Wind episode must be avoided, not only for brevity, but because two supernatural ap- 
pearances, so similar, yet of different person- 
alities, would hopelessly confuse a told story. 
Our oral story is now to be made out of a 
condensed statement of the character of the 
Valley and of its owners, and the manner of 
its loss; the intervention of the King of the 
Golden River; the three attempts to turn the 
river to gold, and Gluck’s success. Gluck is to 
be our hero, and our underlying idea_is the 
power of love versus cfuelty. Description is to 
be reduced to its lowest terms, and the lan- 
guage made simple and concrete. 
With this outline in mind, it may be useful 
to compare the following adaptation with the 
original story. The adaptation is not intended 
in any sense as a substitute for the original, 
but merely as that form of it which can be told, 
while the original remains for reading.

  THE GOLDEN RIVER? 
   There was once a beautiful little valley, 
where the sun was warm, and the rains fell 
softly ; its apples were so red, its corn so yel- 
low, its grapes so blue, that it was called the 
Treasure Valley. Not a river ran into it, but 
one great river flowed down the mountaing 
on the other side, and because the setting sun 
always made its high cataract gold-colored, 
after the rest of the world was dark, it was 
called the Golden River. The lovely valley be- 
longed to three brothers. The youngest, little 
Gluck, was happy-hearted and kind, but he 
had a hard life with his brothers, for Hans and 
Schwartz were so cruel and so stingy that 
they were known all about as the “Black 
Brothers.” They were hard to their farm 
hands, hard to their customers, hard to the 
poor, and hardest of all to Gluck. 
At last the Black Brothers became so bad 
that the Spirit of the West Wind took ven- 
geance on them; he forbade any of the gentle 
winds, south and west, to bring rain to the 
valley. Then, since there were no rivers in it, 
it dried up, and instead of a treasure valley it

became a desert of dry, red sand. The Black 
Brothers could get nothing out of it, and they 
wandered out into the world on the other side 
of the mountain-peaks ; and little Gluck went 
with them. 
Hans and Schwartz went out every day, 
wasting their time in wickedness, but they 
left Gluck in the house to work. And they 
lived on the gold and silver they had saved in 
Treasure Valley, till at last it was all gone. 
The only precious thing left was Gluck’s gold 
mug. This the Black Brothers decided to 
melt into spoons, to sell; and in spite of 
Gluck’s tears, they put it in the melting pot, 
and went out, leaving him to watch it. 
Poor little Gluck sat at the window, trying 
not to cry for his dear golden mug, and as the 
sun began to go down, he saw the beautiful 
cataract of the Golden River turn red, and 
yellow, and then pure color of gold. 
“ Oh, dear!” he said to himself, “ how fine 
it would be if the river were really golden! 
I need n’t be poor, then.” 
“Tt would n’t be fine at all!” said a thin, 
metallic little voice, in his ear. 
“ Merey, what’s that!” said Gluck, looking 
all about. But nobody was there.

      "66 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Suddenly the sharp little voice came 
again. 
“Pour me out,” it said, “I am too hot!” 
It seemed to come right from the oven, 
and as Gluck stood, staring in fright, it came 
again, “ Pour me out; I’m too hot!” 
Gluck was very much frightened, but he 
went and looked in the melting pot. When 
he touched it, the little voice said, “Pour me 
out, I say!” And Gluck took the handle and 
began to pour the gold out. 
First came out a tiny pair of yellow legs; 
then a pair of yellow coat-tails ; then a strange 
little yellow body, and, last, a wee yellow face, 
with long curls of gold hair. And the whole 
put itself together as it fell, and stood up on 
the floor, —the strangest little yellow dwarf, 
about a foot high ! 
“Dear, me!” said Gluck. 
But the little yellow man said, “ Gluck, do 
you know who I am? I am the King of the 
Golden River.” 
Gluck did not know what to say, so he said 
nothing ; and, indeed, the little man gave him 
nochance. He said, “ Gluck, I have been watch- 
ing you, and what I have seen of you, I like. 
Listen, and I will tell you something for your

good. Whoever shall climb to the top of the 
mountain from which the Golden River falls, 
and shall cast into its waters three drops of 
holy water, for him and him only shall its 
waters turn to gold. But no one can succeed 
except at the first trial, and any one who casts 
unholy water in the river will be turned into a 
black stone.” 
And then, before Gluck could draw his 
breath, the King walked straight into the hot- 
test flame of the fire, and vanished up the 
chimney ! 
When Gluck’s brothers came home, they 
beat him black and blue, because the mug was 
gone. But when he told them about the King 
of the Golden River they quarrelled all night, 
as to which should go to get the gold. At last, 
Hans, who was the stronger, got the better of 
Schwartz, and started off. The priest would 
not give such a bad man any holy water, so 
he stole a bottleful. Then he took a basket 
of bread and wine, and began to climb the 
mountain. 
He climbed fast, and soon came to the end 
of the first hill. But there he found a great 
glacier, a hill of ice, which he had never seen 
before. It was horrible to cross, — the ice was

slippery, great gulfs yawned before him, and 
noises like groans and shrieks came from 
under his feet. He lost his basket of bread 
and wine, and was quite faint with fear and 
exhaustion when his feet touched firm ground 
again. 
Next he came to a hill of hot, red rock, 
without a bit of grass to ease the feet, or a 
particle of shade. After an hour’s climb he 
was so thirsty that he felt that he must drink. 
He looked at the flask of water. “Three drops 
are enough,” he thought; “I will just cool 
my lips.” He was lifting the flask to his lips 
when he saw something beside him in the 
path. It was a small dog, and it seemed to be 
dying of thirst. Its tongue was out, its legs 
were lifeless, and a swarm of black ants were 
crawling about its lips. It looked piteously at 
the bottle which Hans held. Hans raised the 
bottle, drank, kicked at the animal, and passed 
on. 
A strange black shadow came across the 
blue sky. 
Another hour Hans climbed; the rocks grew 
hotter and the way steeper every moment. At 
last he could bear it no longer ; he must drink. 
The bottle was half empty, but he decided to

   ADAPT:TION OF STORIES 69 
drink half of what was left. As he lifted it, 
something moved in the path beside him. It 
was a child, lying nearly dead of thirst on the 
rock, its eyes closed, its lips burning, its breath 
coming in gasps. Hans looked at it, drank, 
. and passed on. 
A dark cloud came over the sun, and long 
shadows crept up the mountain side. 
It grew very steep now, and the air weighed 
like lead on Hans’s forehead, but the Golden 
River was very near. Hans stopped a mo- 
ment to breathe, then started to climb the last 
height. 
As he clambered on, he saw an old, old man 
lying in the path. His eyes were sunken, and 
his face deadly pale. 
“ Water!” he said ; “ water!” 
“T have none for you,” said Hans; “ you 
have had your share of life.” He strode over 
the old man’s body and climbed on. 
A flash of blue lightning rose before him, 
and then the heavens were dark. 
At last Hans stood on the brink of the cat- 
- aract of the Golden River. The sound of its 
roaring filled all the air. He drew the flask 
from his side and hurled it into the torrent. 
As he did so, an icy chill shot through him ;

he shrieked and fell. And the river rose and 
flowed.over 
The Black Stone. 
When Hans did not come back Gluck 
grieved, but Schwartz was glad. He decided 
to go and get the gold for himself. He thought 
it might not do to steal the holy water, as 
Hans had done, so he took the money little 
Gluck had earned, and bought holy water of 
a bad priest. Then he took a basket of bread 
and wine, and started off. 
He came to the great hill of ice, and was as 
surprised as Hans had been, and found it as 
hard to cross. Many times he slipped, and he 
was much frightened at the noises, and was 
very glad to get across, although he had lost 
his basket of bread and wine. Then he came 
to the same hill of sharp, red stone, without 
grass or shade, that Hans had climbed. And 
like Hans he became very thirsty. Like Hans, 
too, he decided to drink a little of the water. 
As he raised it to his lips, he suddenly saw the 
same fair child that Hans had seen. 
“Water!” said the child. “ Water! I am 
dying.” 
“T have not enough for myself,” said 
Schwartz, and passed on.

A low bank of black cloud rose out of the 
west. 
When he had climbed for another hour, the 
thirst overcame him again, and again he lifted 
the flask to his lips. As he did so, he saw an 
‘old man who begged for water. 
“T have not enough for myself,” said 
Schwartz, and passed on. 
A mist, of the color of blood, came over the 
sun. 
Then Schwartz climbed for another hour, 
and once more he had to drink. This time, 
as he lifted the flask, he thought he saw his 
brother Hans before him. The figure stretched 
its arms to him, and cried out for water. 
“Ha, ha,” laughed Schwartz, “do you sup- 
pose I brought the water up here for you?” 
And he strode over the figure. But when he 
had gone a few yards farther, he looked back, 
and the figure was not there. 
Then he stood at the brink of the Golden 
River, and its waves were black, and the roar- 
ing of the waters filled all the air. He cast 
the flask into the stream. And as he did so 
the lightning glared in his eyes, the earth gave 
way beneath him, and the river flowed over

When Gluck found himself alone, he at last 
‘decided to try his luck with the King of the 
Golden River. The priest gave him some holy 
water as soon as he asked for it, and with this 
and a basket of bread he started off. 
The hill of ice was much harder for Gluck 
to climb, because he was not so strong as his 
brothers. He lost his bread, fell often, and 
was exhausted when he got on firm ground. 
He began to climb the hill in the hottest part 
of the day. When he had climbed for an hour 
he was very thirsty, and lifted the bottle to 
drink a little water. As he did so he saw a 
feeble old man coming down the path toward 
him. 
“T am faint with thirst,” said the old man; 
“will you give me some of that water?” 
Gluck saw that he was pale and tired, so he 
gave him the water, saying, “ Please don’t drink 
it all.” But the old man drank a great deal, 
and gave back the bottle two thirds emptied. 
Then he bade Gluck good speed, and Gluck 
went on merrily. 
Some grass appeared on the path, and the

flask, he saw a little child lying by the road- 
side; it cried out for water. Gluck struggled 
with himself, and decided to bear the thirst a 
little longer. He put the bottle to the child’s 
lips, and it drank all but a few drops. Then 
it got up and ran down the hill. 
All kinds of sweet flowers began to grow on 
the rocks, and crimson and purple butterflies 
danced about in the air. 
But at the end of another hour, Gluck’s 
thirst was unbearable. He saw that there were 
only five or six drops of water in the bottle, 
and he did not dare to drink. As he was put- 
ting the flask away again, he saw a little dog 
on the rocks, gasping for breath. He looked 
at it, and then at the Golden River, and he 
remembered the dwarf’s words, “No one can 
succeed except at the first trial;” and he tried 
to pass the dog. It whined piteously, and 
Gluck stopped. He could not bear to pass it. 
“Confound the King and his gold, too!” he 
said; and he poured the few drops of water 
into the dog’s mouth. 
The dog sprung up; its tail disappeared, 
its nose grew red, and its eyes twinkled. The 
next minute the dog was gone, and the King 
of the Golden River stood there. He stooped

feet. Three drops of dew were on its white 
leaves. These the dwarf shook into the flask 
which Gluck held in his hand. 
“Cast these into the river,” he said, “and 
go down the other side of the mountains into 
the Treasure Valley.” Then he disappeared. 
- Gluck stood on the brink of the Golden 
River, and cast the three drops of dew into 
the stream. Where they fell, a little whirl- 
pool opened; but the water did not turn to 
gold. Indeed, the water seemed vanishing alto- 
gether. Gluck was disappointed not to see 
gold, but he obeyed the King of the Golden 
River, and went down the other side of the 
mountains. 
When he came out into the Treasure Valley, 
a river, like the Golden River, was springing 
from a new cieft in the rocks above, and flow- 
ing among the heaps of dry sand. And then 
fresh grass sprang beside the river, flowers 
opened along its sides, and vines began to 
cover the whole valley. The Treasure Valley 
was becoming a garden again.

were blue, and his apples were red, and his 
corn was yellow; and the poor were neve:

                 It will probably be clear to any one who has 
followed these attempts, that the first step in 
adaptation is analysis, careful analysis of the 
story as it stands. One asks oneself, What is 
the story? Which events are necessary link,

usually the hero. To shift the viewpoint of 
the action is confusing to the child’s mind. 
When the analysis and condensation have 
been accomplished, the whole must be cast in 
simple language, keeping if possible the same 
kind of speech as that used in the original, but

in command signaled to the party an order to return. 
They mistook the signal for a command to charge; the 
brave fellows answered with a cheer, and charged. At the 
summit of the steep mountain was a triangular platform, 
defended by a breastwork, behind which were seventy of 
the foe. On they went, charging up one of those fearful 
paths, eleven against seventy. The contest could not long 
be doubtful with such odds. One after another they fell; 
six upon the spot, the remainder hurled backwards; but 
not until they had slain nearly twice their own number. 
There is a custom, we are told, amongst the hillsmen, 
that when a great chieftain of their own falls in battle, 
his wrist is bound with a thread either of red or green, 
the red denoting the highest rank. According to custom, 
they stripped the dead, and threw their bodies over the 
precipice. When their comrades came, they found their 
corpses stark and gashed ; but round both wrists of every 
British hero was twined the red thread! 
This anecdote serves its purpose of illustra- 
tion perfectly well, but considered as a sepa- 
rate story it is somewhat too explanatory in 
diction, and too condensed in form. Just as 
the long story is analyzed for reduction of 
given details,so this must be analyzed, — to 
find the details implied. We have to read into

“snap,” the final sting of surprise and admira-

must be prepared for. The purpose of the 
original is equally well served by the explana- 
tion at the end, but we must never forget that 
the place for the climax or effective point ina _ 
story told, is the last thing said. That is what 
makes a story “ go off” well. 
Imagining vividly the situation suggested, 
and keeping the logical sequence of facts in 
mind, shall we not find the story telling itself 
to boys and girls in somewhat this form? 
THE RED THREAD OF COURAGE 
This story which I am going to tell you is 
a true one. It happened while the English 
troops in India were fighting against some of 
the native tribes. The natives who were mak- 
ing trouble were people from the hill-country, 
called Hillsmen, and they were strong enemies. 
The English knew very little about them, ex- - 
cept their courage, but they had noticed one 
peculiar custom, after certain battles, — te 
Hillsmen had a way of marking the bodies of 
their greatest chiefs who were killed/in battle 
by binding a red thread about the wrist 3 when

a body was marked so, it meant the highest 
tribute of honor they could pay a hero. The 
English, however, found the common men of 
them quite enough to handle, for they had 
proved themselves good fighters and clever at 
ambushes. 
One day, a small body of the English had 
marched a long way into the hill country, after 
the enemy, and in the afternoon they found 
themselves in a part of the country strange 
even to the guides. The men moved forward 
very slowly and cautiously, for fear of an am- 
bush. The trail led into a narrow valley with 
very steep, high, rocky sides, topped with 
woods in which the enemy might easily hide. 
Here the soldiers were ordered to advance 
more quickly, though with caution, to get out 
of the dangerous place. 
After a little, they came suddenly to a place 
where the passage was divided in two by a 
big three-cornered boulder which seemed to 
rise from the midst of the valley. The main 
line of men kept to the right; to save crowd- 
ing the path, a sergeant and eleven men took 
the left, meaning to go round the rock and 
meet the rest beyond it. 
They had been in the path only a few min- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
80 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
utes when they saw that the rock was not a 
single boulder at all, but an arm of the left 
wall of the valley, and that they were march- 
ing into a deep ravine with no outlet except 
the way they came. Both sides were sheer 
rock, almost perpendicular, with thick trees at 
the top; in front of them the gcound rose in 
a steep hill, bare of woods. As they looked 
up, they saw that the top was barricaded by 
the trunks of trees, and guarded by a strong 
body of Hillsmen. As the English hesitated, 
looking at this, a shower of spears fell from 
the wood’s edge, aimed by hidden foes. The 
place was a death trap. 
At this moment, their danger was seen by 
the officer in command of the main body, and 
he signaled to the sergeant to retreat. 
By some terrible mischance, the signal was 
misunderstood. The men took it for the signal 
tocharge. Without a moment’s pause, straight 
up the slope, they charged on the run, cheer- 
ing as they ran. 
Some were killed by tie spears that were 
thrown from the cliffs, before they had gone 
half way; some were stabbed as they reached 
the crest, and hurled backward from the preci- 
pice ; two or three got to the top, and fought

hand to hand with the Hillsmen. They we 
outnumbered, seven to one; but when the 
last of the English soldiers lay dead, twice 
their number of Hillsmen lay dead around 
them ! 
When the relief party reached the spot, 
later in the day, they found the bodies of their 
comrades, full of wounds, huddled over and 
in the barricade, or crushed on the rocks below, 
They were mutilated and battered, and bore 
every sign of the terrible struggle. But round 
both wrists of every British soldier was 
bound the red thread ! 
The Hillsmen had given their heroic foes 
the highest honor they paid their own brave 
dead. 
From these three instances we may, per- 
haps, deduce certain general principles _of 
adaptation which have at least proved valuable 
to those using them. 
These are suggestions which the practiced 
story-teller will find trite. But to others they 
may prove a fair foundation on which to build 
a personal method to be developed by experi- 
ence. I have given them a tabular arrange- 
ment on the next page.

‘power. That is the real joy, when achieved ; 
the real bugbear, when dreaded. And that is 
the subject of this chapter, “ How to tell a 
story.” 
How to tell a story: it is a short question 
which demands a long answer. The right be- 
ginning of the answer depends on a right con- 
ception of the thing the question is about ; 
and that naturally reverts to an earlier discus- 
sion of the real nature of a story. In that 
discussion it was stated that a story is a work 
of art, —a message;-as all works of art are. 
‘To tell a story, then, is to_pass_on_the mes- 
sage, to share the work of art. The message 
may be “merely one of humor, — of nonsense, 
even ; works of art range all the way from the

  avs ROW TO TELL STORIES 
Each has its own place. Buc what- 
ts quality, the story-teller is the passer-on, 
roe interpreter, the transmitter. He comes 
bringing a gift. Always he gives; always he 
bears a message. 
This granted, the first demand of the story- 
teller is not farto seek. No one can repeat a 
message he has not heard, or interpret what 
he does not understand. You cannot give, 
unless you first possess. The _first_demand-of 
the_story-teller_is that he possess. . He » must 
feel the story.) Whatever the particular qual- 
ity and appeal/of the work of art is, from the 
lightest to the grandest emotion or thought, he 
must have responded to it, sensed it, felt it 
intimately, before he can give it out again. 
Listen, humbly, for the message. 
I realize that this has an incongruous sound, 
when applied to such stories as that of the 
little pig at the stile or of the greedy cat who 
ate up man and beast. Bug me, it 
does apply even to those.’For the trans- 
mittible thing in a story is’ ; the identifying 
essence, the characterizing savor, the peculiar 
quality and viewpoint of the humor, pathos, 
or interest. Every tale which claims a place 
in good fiction has this identifying savor and     
-P-A-G-E-109

quality, each different from every other. The 
laugh which echoes one of Seumas McManus’s 
rigmaroles is not the chuckle which follows 
oné of Joel Chandler Harris’s anecdotes ; the 
gentle sadness of an Andersen allegory is not 
the heart-searching tragedy of a tale from the 
Greek ; nor is any one story of an author just 
like any other of the same making. Each has 
its personal likeness, its facial expression, as it 
were. : 
And the mind must be sensitized to these 
differences. No one can tell stories well who 
has not a keen and just feeling of such emo- 
tional values.   
A positive and a negative injunction depend _ 
on this premise, — the positive, cultivate your 
feeling, striving toward increasingly just ap- 
preciation ; the negative, neyer tell a story 
you do not feel. 
Fortunately, the number and range of 
stories one can appreciate grows with cultiva- 
tion ; but it is the part of wisdom not to step 
outside the range at any stage of its growth. 
I feel the more inclined to emphasize this 
caution because I once had arather embarrassing 
and pointed proof of its desirability, — which 
I relate for the enlightening of the reader.

    86 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
There is a certain nonsense tale which a 
friend used to tell with such effect that her 
hearers became helpless with laughter; but 
which for some reason never seemed funny to 
me. I could not laugh at it. But my friend 
constantly urged me to use it, quoting her 
own success. At last, with much curiosity and 
some trepidation, I included it ina programme 
before people with whom I was so closely in 
sympathy that no chill was likely to emanate 
from their side. I told the story as well as I 
knew how, putting into it more genuine effort 
than most stories can claim. The audience 
smiled politely, laughed gently once or twice, 
relapsed into the mildest of amusement. The 
most one could say was that the story was not 
a hopeless failure. I tried it again, after study, 
and yet again; but the audiences were all 
alike. And in my heart I should have been 
startled if they had behaved otherwise, for all 
the time I was telling it I was conscious in 
my soul that it was a stupid story! At last I 
owned my defeat to myself, and put the thing 
out of mind. 
Some time afterward, I happened to take 
out the notes of the story, and idly looked 
them over; and suddenly, I do not know how,

                          I got the point of view! The salt of the humor 
was all at once on my lips; I felt the tickle 
of the pure folly of it; it was funny. 
The next EH I told the story to a 
hundred or so children and as many mothers, 
—and the battle was won. Chuckles punc- 
tuated my periods ; helpless laughter ran like 
an undercurrent below my narrative; it was 
a struggle for me to keep sober, myself. The 
nonsense tale had found its own atmosphere. 
Now of course I had known all along that 
the humor of the story emanated from its very 
exaggeration, its absurdly illogical smoothness. 
But Thad not felt it. I did not really “see the 
joke.” And that was why I could not tell the 
story. I undoubtedly impressed my own sense 
of its fatuity on every audience to which I 
gave it. The case is very clear. 
Equally clear have been some happy in- 
stances where I have found audiences respond- 
ing to a story I myself greatly liked, but which 
common appreciation usually ignored. This is 
an experience even more persuasive than the 
other, certainly more to be desired. , 
Every story-teller has lines of limitation ; 
certain types of story will always /remain his

course the number of kinds one tells well in- 
creases with the growth of the appreciative 
capacity. But none the less, it is wise to re- 
cognize the limits at each stage, and not try 
to tell any story to which the honest inner 
consciousness says, “I do not like you.” 
Let us then set down as a prerequisite for 
«good story-telling, a genuine appreciation of 
_the story. 
Now, we may suppose this genuine appreci- 
ation to be your portion. You have chosen a 
story, have felt its charm, ‘and identified the 
quality of its appeal. 
You are now to tell it in such wise that. 
your hearers will get the same kind of impres- 
sion you yourself received from it. How? 
I believe the inner secret of success is the 
measure of force with which the teller-wills the 
conveyance of his impression to the hearer. 
Any one who has watched, or has himself 
been, the teller of a story which held an audi- 
ence, knows that there is something approach- 
ing hypnotic suggestion in the close connec- 
tion of effort and effect, and in the elimination 
of self-consciousness from speaker and listen- 
ers alike.

       HOW TO TELL THE STORY 
   I would not for a moment lend the atmo- 
sphere of charlatanry, or of the ultra-psychic, 
to the wholesome and vivid art of story-telling. 
But I would, if possible, help the teacher to 
realize how largely success in that art is a 
subjective and psychological matter, depend- 
ent on her control of her own mood and her 
~sense of direct, intimate communion with the 
minds attending her._The “feel” of an audi- 
ence, — that indescribable sense of the com- 
posite human soul waiting on the initiative of 
your own, the emotional currents interplaying 
along a medium so delicate that it takes the 
baffling torture of an obstruction to reveal its 
existence, — cannot be taught. But it can 
and does develop with use. And a realization 
of the immense latent power of strong desire 
and resolution vitalizes and disembarrasses the 
beginner. 
That is, undoubtedly, rather an intangible 
beginning ; it sets the root of the matter some- 
what in the realm of “ spirits and influences.” 
There are, however, outward and visible means 
of arriving at results. Every art has its tech- 
nique. The art of story-telling, intensely per- 
sonal and subjective as it is, yet comes under 
the law sufficiently not to be a matter of sheer 
a

   HOW TO TELL STORIES 
“knack.” It has its technique. The follow- 
ing suggestions are an attempt to state what 
seem the foundation principles of that tech- 
nique. The general statements are deduced 
from many consecutive experiences ; partly, too, 
they are the results of introspective analysis, 
confirmed by observation. They do not make 
up an exclusive body of rules, wholly adequate 
to produce good work, of themselves; they do 
include, so far as my observation and experi- 
rience allow, the fundamental requisites of good 
work, — being the qualities uniformly present 
in successful work of many story-tellers. 
First of all, most fundamental of all, is a 
AM rule without which any other would be but 
Y folly: Know your story. 
One would think so obvious a preliminary 
might be taken for granted. But alas, even 
slight acquaintance with the average story- 
teller proves the dire necessity of the admoni- 
tion. The halting tongue, the slip in name or 
incident, the turning back to forge an omitted 
link in the chain, the repetition, the general 
weakness of statement consequent on imperfect 
grasp : these are common features of the stories 
one hears told. And they are features which / 
will deface the best story ever told.

One must know the story absolutely; it 
must have been so assimilated that it partakes 
of the nature of personal experience; its es- 
sence must be so clearly in mind that the teller 
does not have to think of it at all in the act 
of telling, but rather lets it flow from his lips 
with the unconscious freedom of a vivid remi- 
niscence. 
Such knowledge does not mean memorizing. 
Memorizing aijoily Satire he Pee ae 
reminiscence, takes away the spontaneity, and 
substitutes a mastery of form for a mastery of 
essence. It means, rather, a perfect grasp of 
the gist of the story, with sufficient familiarity 
with its form to ‘determine. the manner_of-—its 
telling. “The easiest way to obtain this mastery 
is, I think, to analyze the story into its simplest 
elements of plot. Strip it bare of style, descrip- 
tion, interpolation, and find out simply what 
happened. Personally, I find that I get first 
an especially vivid conception of ‘the climax ; 
this then has to be rounded out by a clear 
perception of the successive steps which lead 
up to the climax. One has, so, the frame- 
work of the story. The next process is the 
filling in. 
There must be many ways of going about
-P-A-G-E-116
  92 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
this filling in. Doubtless many of my readers 
have evolved personally effective ways of doing 
it, back in the days when it was their pet am- 
bition to make a good recitation in school ; for 
it is, after all, the same thing as preparing a 
bit of history or a recitation in literature. But 
for the consideration of those who find it hard 
to gain mastery of fact without mastery of 
iis stated form, I give my own way. I have 
always used the childlike plan of talking it out. 
Sometimes inaudibly, sometimes in loud and 
penetrating tones which arouse the sympathetic 
curiosity of my family, I tell it over and over, 
to an imaginary hearer. That hearer is as 
present to me, always has been, as Stevenson’s 
“friend of the children” who takes the part 
of the enemy in their solitary games of war. 
His criticism (though he is a most composite 
double-sexed creature who should not have a 
designating personal pronoun) is all-revealing. 
For talking it out instantly brings to light the 
weak spots in one’s recollection. “ What was 
it the little crocodile said?” “Just how did 
the little pig get into his house?” “ What 
was that link in the chain of circumstances 
which brought the wily fox to confusion ?” 
The slightest cloud of uncertainty becomes

one’s paucity of expression, one’s week-kneed _ 
“imagination, one’s imperfect assimilation of 
the spirit of the story. It is not a flattermg 
process, 
But when these faults have been corrected 
by several attempts, the method gives a confi- 
dence, a sense of sureness, which makes the 
real telling to a real audience ready and spon- 
taneously smooth. Scarcely an epithet or a 
sentence comes out as it was in the preliminary 
telling ; but epithets and sentences in suffi- 
ciency do come ; the beauty of this method is 
that it brings hoodie instead ¢ “of b bondage. .

memorizing must be noted here. Especially

“Three Bears” or “ Red Ridinghood” the ex- 
act phraseology of the conversation as given 
in familiar versions should be preserved ; it is 
in a way sacred, a classic, and not to be al- 
tered. But beyond this the language should 
be the teller’s own, and probably never twice

—if you can help it.” For, of course, there 
are exceptional occasions, and exceptional chil- 
dren ; some latitude must be left for the de- 
cisions of good common sense acting on the 
issue of the moment. 
The children ready, your own mood must 
be ready. It is desirable that the spirit of the 
story should be imposed upon the room from 
the beginning, and this result hangs on the 
clearness and intensity of the teller’s initia- 
tory mood. An act of memory and of will is 
the requisite. The story-teller must call up — 
it comes with the swiftness of thought—the’ 
essential emotion of the story as he felt it 
first. A single volition puts him in touch with 
the characters and the movement of the tale. 
This is scarcely more than a brief and con-    
-P-A-G-E-120
96 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
  densed reminiscence ; it is the stepping back 
into a mood once experienced. 
Let us say, for example, that the story to 
be told is the immortal fable of the “Ugly 
Duckling.” Before you open your lips the 
whole pathetic series of the little swan’s mis- 
haps should flash across your mind, — not 
accurately and in detail, but blended to a 
composite of undeserved ignominy, of baffled 
innocent wonderment, and of delicious undéer- 
lying satire on average views. With this is 
mingled the feeling of Andersen’s delicate 
whimsicality of style. The dear little Ugly 
Duckling waddles, bodily, into your conscious- 
ness, and you pity his sorrows and anticipate 
his triumph, before you begin. 
This preliminary recognition of mood is 
what brings the delicious quizzical twitch to 
the mouth of a good raconteur who begins an 
anecdote the hearers know will be side-splitting. 
It is what makes grandmother sigh gently and 
look far over your heads, when her soft voice 
commences the story of “the little girl who 
lived long, long ago.” It is a natural and in- 
stinctive thing with the born story-teller; a 
necessary thing for any one who will become a 
story-teller.
-P-A-G-E-121
    HOW TO TELL THE STORY 
From the very start, the mood of the tale 
should be definite and Palihowistive, Doginaing 
with the mood of the teller and emanating 
therefrom in proportion as the physique of 
the teller is a responsive medium. 
Now we are off. Knowing your story, have- 
ing your hearers well arranged, and being as 
thoroughly as you are able in the right mood, 
you begin to tell it. Tell it, then, simply, 
directly, dramatically, with zest. 
“Simply applies both to manner and matter. 
As to manner, I mean without affectation, 
without any form of pretense, in short, with- 
out posing. It is a pity to “talk down” to 
the children, to assume a honeyed voice, to 
think of the edifying or educational value of 
the work one is doing. Naturalness, being 
one’s self, is the desideratum. I wonder why 
we so often use a preposterous voice, —a su- 
per-sweetened whine, in talking to children? 
Is it that the effort to realize an ideal of gen- 
tleness and affectionateness overreaches itself 
in this form of the grotesque? Some good 
intention must be the root of it. But the thing 
is none the less pernicious. A “cant” voice is 
as abominable as a cant phraseology. Both 
are of the very substance of evil.

    HOW TO TELL STORIES 
“But it is easier to say, ‘Be natural’ than 
to be it,” said one teacher to me desperately. 
VY Beyond dispute. To those of us who are 
cursed with an over-abundant measure of self- 
consciousness, nothing is harder than simple 
naturalness. The remedy is to lose one’s self in 
one’s art. Think of the story so absorbingly 
and vividly that you “have no room to think of 
yourself.Live it. Sink yourself in that mood 
you have summoned up, and let it carry you. 
If you do this, simplicity of matter will come 
easily. Your choice of words and images will 
naturally become simple. 
It is, I think, a familiar precept to educators, 
that children should not have their literature 
too much simplified for them. We are told that 
they like something beyond them, and that it 
is good for them to have a sense of mystery 
and power beyond the sense they grasp. That 
is probably quite true; but it does not apply 
to story-telling as it does to reading. We have 
constantly to remember that the movement of a 
story told is very swift. A concept not grasped 
in passing is irrevocably lost ; there is no pos- 
sibility of turning back, or lingering over the 
page. Also, since the art of story-telling is pri- 
matily an art of entertainment, its very object 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  HOW TO TELL THE STORY 99 
is sacrificed if the ideas and images do not slip 
into the child’s consciousness smoothly enough 
to avoid the sense of strain. For this reason 
short, familiar, vivid words are best. 
Simplicity of manner and of matter are Boy, 
essential to the right appeal to children. 
Directness in telling is a. most important 
quality. The story, ii@engil to, is like the 7 
drama, beheld. Its movement must be unim- ph 
peded, increasingly swift, winding up “ with alw 
snap.” Long-windedness, or tallsing round the yg, story, utterly destroys this movement. The in 
cidents should be told,-one after another, with- Let ; é

out ex xplanation or or - description | beyond what is 
absolutely 1 necessary; and they should be told 
in logical Fegdencey Nothing is more distress- 
ing: than the cart-before-the-horse method, — 
nothing more quickly destroys interest than 
the failure to get a clue in the right place. 
Sometimes, to be sure, a side remark adds 
piquancy and a personal savor. But the gen- 
eral rule is, great discretion in this respect. 
Every epithet or adjective beyond what is 
needed to give the image, is a five-barred gate 
in the path of the eager mind traveling to a 
climax. 
Explanations and moralizing aremostly sheer

  clutter. Some few stories necessarily include 
a little explanation, and stories of the fable 
order may quaintly end with an obvious moral. 
But here again, the rule is— great discretion. 
It is well to remember that you have one 
great advantage over the writer of stories. The 
writer must present a clear image and make a 
vivid impression, — all with words. The teller 
has face, and voice, and body to do it with. 
The teller needs, consequently, but one swiftly 
incisive verb to the writer’s two; but one ex- 
pressive adjective to his three. Often, indeed, 
a pause and an expressive gesture do the whole 
thing. 
‘It may be said here that it is a good trick of 
description to repeat an epithet or phrase once 
used, when referring again to the same thing. 
The recurrent adjectives of Homer were the 
device of one who entertained a childlike au- 
dience. His trick is unconscious and instinc- 
tive with people who have a natural gift for 
children’s stories. Of course this matter also 
demands common sense in the degree of its use; 
in moderation it is a most successful device. 
Brevity, close logical sequence, exclusion of 
foreign matter, unhesitant® h,— to use 
\these is fo tell a story direetly.
-P-A-G-E-125
  HOW TO TELL THE STORY 101 
After simplicity and directness, comes that 
quality which to advise, is to become a rock of 
offense to many. It-is the suggestion, “ Tell 
the story dramatically.” Yet when we quite 
understand each other as to the meaning of 
“ dramatically,” I think you will agree with me 
that a good story-teller includes this in his 
qualities of manner. It means, not in the man- 
ner of the elocutionist, not excitably, not any 
of the things which are incompatible with 
simplicity and sincerity; but with a whole- 
hearted throwing of one’s self into the game, 
which identifies one in a manner with the 
character or situation of the moment. It 
means responsively, vividly, without interpos- 
ing a blank wall of solid self between the 
drama of the tale and the mind’s eye of the 
audience. 
It is such fun, pure and simple, to so throw 
one’s self into it, and to see the answering 
expressions mimic one’s own, that it seems 
superfluous to urge it. Yet many persons do 
find it difficult. The instant, slight but sug- 
gestive change of voice, the use of onomato- 
poetic words, the response of eyes and hands, 
which are all immediate and spontaneous with 
some temperaments, are to others a matter of
-P-A-G-E-126
102 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
shamefacedness and labor. To those, to all 
who are not ,by nature bodily expressive, I 
would reiterate the injunction already given, 
— not to pretend, Do nothing you cannot do 
naturally and happily. But lay your stress on 
the inner and spiritual effort to appreciate, to 
feel, to imagine out the tale; and let the ex- 
pressiveness of your body grow gradually with 
the increasing’ freedom from crippling self- 
consciousness. The physique will become more 
mobile as the emotion does. 
“The expression must, however, always re- 
main suggestive rathe rather than illustrative. This 
is the side of the case which those who are 
over-dramatic must not forget. The story- 
teller is not playing the parts of his stories ; 
he is merely arousing the imagination of his 
hearers to picture the sceties for themselves. 
One element of the dual consciousness of the 
tale-teller remains always the observer, the re- 
porter, the quiet outsider. 
I like to think of the story-teller as a good 
fellow standing at a great window overlooking 
a busy street or a picturesque square, and re 
porting with gusto to the comrade in the rear 
of the room what of mirth or sadness he sees ; 
he hints at the policeman’s strut, the organ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
HOW TO TELL THE STORY 103 
grinder’s shrug, the schoolgirl’s gayety, witha 
gesture or two which is born of an irresistible 
impulse to imitate; but he never leaves his 
fascinating post to carry the imitation farther 
than a hint. 
The verity of this figure lies in the fact that 
the dramatic quality of story-telling depends 
closely upon the clearness and power with: shavactars he denertiee Yoo wie events and 
characters he describes. You must hold the 
image before the mind’s e eye, using your ima- 
gination to bddy forth to yourself every act, 
incident, and appearance. You must, indeed, 
stand at the window of your consciousness 
and watch what happens. 
This is a point so vital that I am tempted 
to put it in ornate type. You must see what 
you say! 
It is not too much, even, to say, “ You 
must see more than you say.”” True vividness 
is lent by a background of picture sensed by 
the listener beyond what you tell him. Chil- 
dren see, as a rule, no image you do not see; 
they see most clearly what you see most largely. 
Draw, then, from a full well, not from a sup- 
ply so low that the pumps wheeze at every pull. 
Dramatic power of the reasonably quiet and 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
104 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
   suggestive type demanded for telling a story 
will come pretty surely in the train of effort 
along these lines; it follows the clear concept 
and sincerity in imparting it, and is a natural 
consequence of the visualizing imagination. 
It is inextricably bound up, also, with the 
causes and results of the quality which finds 
place in my final injunction, to tell your story 
, sheabel ail almost be assumed that the 
uggestion renders the preceding one sus 
perfluous, so direct is the effect of a lively in- 
terest on the dramatic quality of a narration ; 
but it would not of itself be adequate; the 
necessity of visualizing imagination is para- 
mount. Zest is, however, a close second to 
this clearness of mental vision. It is entirely 
necessary to be interested in your own story, 
to enjoy it as you tell it. If you are bored and 
tired, the children will soon be bored and tired, 
too. If you are not interested your manner 
cannot get that vitalized spontaneity which 
makes dramatic power possible. Nothing else 
will give that relish on the lips, that gusto, 
which communicates its joy to the audience 
and makes it receptive to every impression. 
I used to say to teachers, “Tell your story 
with all your might,” but I found that this 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
HOW TO TELL THE STORY 10: 
by a natural misconception was often inter- 
preted to mean “laboriously.” And of course 
nothing is more injurious to the enjoyment of 
an audience than obvious effort on the part 
of the entertainer. True zest can be — often 
‘is — extremely quiet, but it gives a savor no- 
thing else can impart. 
“ But how, at the end of a hard morning’s 
work, can I be interested in a story I have 
told twenty times before?” asks the kinder- 
gartner or primary teacher, not without rea- 
son. 
There are two things to be said. (The first 
is a reminder of the wisdom of choosing stories 
in which you originally have interest; and of 
having a. stor: ough to permit variety. 
The second applies to those inevitable times of 
weariness which attack the most interested and 
well-stocked story-teller. You are, perhaps, 
tired out physically. You have told a certain 
story till it seems as if a repetition of it must 
produce bodily effects dire to contemplate, yet 
that happens to be the very story you must 
tell. What can you do? I answer, “ Make 
believe.” The device seems incongruous with 
the repeated warnings against pretense; but 
it is necessary, and it is wise. Pretend as hard   
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  06 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
as ever you can to be interested. And the re- 
sult will be— before you know it — that you 
will be interested. That is the chief cause of 
the recommendation ; it brings about the re- 
sult it simulates. Make believe, as well as you 
know how, and the probability is that you will 
not even know when the transition from pre- 
tended to real interest comes. 
And fortunately, the children never know 
the difference. They have not that psycholo- 
gical infallibility which is often attributed to 
them. They might, indeed, detect a pretense 
which continued through a whole tale; but 
that is so seldom necessary that it needs little 
consideration. 
So then: enjoy your story; be interested in 
it, —if you possibly can; and if you cannot, 
pretend to be, till the very pretense brings 
about the virtue you have assumed. 
There is much else which might be said and 
urged regarding the method of story-telling, 
even without encroaching on the domain of 
personal variations. A whole chapter might, 
for example, be devoted to voice and enuncia- 
tion, and then leave the subject fertile. But 
voice and enunciation are after all merely single 
manifestations of degree and quality of culture,
-P-A-G-E-131
  HOW TO TELL THE STORY 107 
of tas and of natural gift. No set rules can 
bring charm of voice and speech to a person 
whose feeling and habitual point of view is 
fundamentally wrong; the person whose hab- 
itual feeling and mental attitude is funda- 
mentally right needs few or no rules. As the 
whole matter of story-telling is in the first in- 
stance an expression of the complex personal 
product, so will this feature of it vary in per- 
fection according to the beauty and culture of 
the human mechanism manifesting it. 
A few generally applicable suggestions may, 
however, be useful, — always assuming the 
story-teller to have the fundamental qualifica- 
tions of fine and wholesome habit. These are 
not rules for the art of speaking; they are 
merely some practical considerations regard- 
ing speaking to an audience. 
First, I would reiterate my earlier advice, 
(ibe. simple. Affectation is # is the worst_enemy of 
voice and enuneiation-alike. Slovenly enunci- 
ation is certainly very dreadful, but the unre- 
generate may be pardoned if they prefer it to 
the affected mouthing which some over-nice 
people without due sense of values expend on 
every syllable which is so unlucky as to fall 
between their teeth.   
-P-A-G-E-132
     108 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Next I would urge avoidance of @P fault 
very common with those who speak much in . 
| large rooms, — the mistaken effort at loudness. 
Y This results in tightening and straining the 
throat, finally producing nasal head-tones or a 
voice of metallic harshness. And it is entirely 
unnecessary. There is no need to speak loudly. 
The ordinary schoolroom needs no vocal effort. 
A hall seating three or four hundred persons 
demands no effort whatever beyond a certain 
clearnéss and definiteness of speech. A hall 
seating from five to eight hundred needs more 
skill in aiming the voice, but still demands no 
shouting. 
It is indeed largely the psychological quality 
of a tone that makes it reach in through the 
ear to the comprehension. The quiet, clear, 
' restful, persuasive tone of a speaker who knows 
his power goes straight home; but loud speech 
confuses. Never speak loudly. In a small 
oom, speak as gently and easily as in conver- 
sation; in a large room, think of the people 
farthest away, and speak clearly, with a slight 
. separation between words, and with definite 
phrasing, — aiming your mind toward the 
distant listeners. 
f one is conscious of nasality or throatiness

of voice, it certainly pays to study the sub- 
ject seriously with an intelligent teacher. But 
a good, natural speaking-voice, free from ex- 
traordinary vices, will fill all the requirements 
of story-telling to small audiences, without 
other attention than comes indirectly from 
following the general principles of the art. 
To sum it all up, then, let us say of the 
method likely to bring success in telling stories, 
that it includes sympathy, grasp, spontaneity ; 
one must appreciate the story, and know it; 
and then, using the realizing imagination as a 
constant vivifying force, and dominated by the 
mood of the story, one must tell it with all 
one’s might, — simply, vitally, joyously.

SOME SPECIFIC SCHOOLROOM USES OF STO 
TELLING 
  In Chapter IT, I have tried to give my con- 
ception of the general aim of story-telling in 
school. From that conception, it is not difficult 
to deduce certain specific uses. The one most 
plainly intimated is that of a‘brief_recreation 
period, a feature which has proved valuable in 
many classes. Less definitely implied, but not 
to be ignored, was the use of the story during, 
or’aecessory to, the lesson in science orhistory. 
But more distinctive and valuable than 
these, I think, is a specific use which I have 
recently had the pleasure of seeing exempli- 
hed in great completeness in the schools of 
Providence, Rhode Island. 
Some four years ago, the assistant superin- 
tendent of schools of that city, Miss Ella L. 
Sweeney, introduced a rather unusual and ex- 
tended application of the story in her primary 
grades. While the experiment was in its early 
stages, it was my good,fortune to be allowed 
to make suggestions for its development, and
-P-A-G-E-135

as the devices in question were those I hid 
been accustomed to use as a pastime for chil- 
dren, I was able to take some slight hand in 
* 8 formative work of its adoption as an edu- 
onal method. Carried out most ably by the 
teachers to whom it was intrusted, the plan — 
has evolved into a more inclusive and sys- 
tematic one than was at first hoped for; it is 
one from which I have been grateful to learn. 
Tersely stated, the object of the general 
plan is theAfreeing and developing of the 
power_of expression in the pupils. I think there can be no need of dwelling 
on the desirability of this result. The apathy 
and “ woodenness”’ of children under average 
modes of pedagogy is apparent to any one who 
is interested enough to observe. In elementary 
work, the most noticeable lack of natural ex- 
pression is probably in the reading~elasses ; 
the same drawback appears-at a later stage in 
English composition. But all along the line 
every thoughtful teacher knows how diffteult 
it is to obtain spontaneous, creative reaction 
on material given. 
Story-felling has a real mission to perform 
in setting free the natural creative expression of children, and in vitalizing the general at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  HOW TO TELL STORIES 
mosphere of the school. The method in use 
for this purpose in Providence (and probably 
elsewhere, as ideas usually germinate in more 
than one place at once) is a threefold oie 
back of the story by the children. Two of the 
forms of reproduction are familiar to many 
teachers ; the first is the obvious ong_of+tell- 
ing the story back again. 
¥ “Tis such fun to listen to a good story that 
children remember it without effort, and later, 
when asked if they can tell the story of the 
“Red-Headed Woodpecker” or the “ Little 
Red Hen,” they are as eager to try it as if it 
were a personal experience which they were 
burning to impart. 
Each pupil, in the Providence classes, is 
given a chance to try each story, at some time. 
Then that one which each has told especially 
well is allotted to him for his own particular 
story, on which he has an especial claim there- 
after. 
It is surprising to note how comparatively 
individual and distinctive the expression of 
voice and manner becomes, after a skort time. 
The child instinctively emphasizes tre points 
which appeal to him, and the elemeni-of fun 
in it all helps bring forgetfulness of ‘self. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
   
   SPECIFIC SCHOOLROOM USES 113 
The main inflections and the general tenor of 
the language, however, remain imitative, as | 
is natural with children. But this is a gain 
rither than otherwise, for it is useful in form- 
ing good habit. In no other part of her work, 
probably, has a teacher so good a chance Fe 
foster in her pupils pleasant habits of enunci ation and voice:\ And this is especially worth 
while in the big city schools, where so many 
children come from homes where broken Eng- 
lish or the English of the tenement is spoken. 
I have since wished that every primary 
teacher of the city could have visited with me 
the first-grade room in Providence where the 
pupils were German, Russian, or Polish Jews, 
and where some of them had heard no Eng- 
lish previous to that year,— it being then 
May. The joy that shone on their faces was 
nothing less than radiance. when the low- 
voiced teacher said, “ Would you like to tell 
these ladies some of your stories ? ” 
They told us their stories, and there was 
truly not one told poorly or inexpressively ; all 
the children had learned something of the joy 
of creative effort. But one little fellow stands 
out in my memory beyond all the rest, yet as 
a type of all the rest.
-P-A-G-E-138
      114 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Rudolph was very small, and square, and 
merry of eye; life was one eagerness and 
expectancy to him. He knew no English be- 
yond that of one school year. But he stood 
staunchly in his place and told me the story 
of the Little Half Chick with an abandon and 
bodily emphasis which left no doubt of his 
sympathetic understanding of every word. 
The depth of moral reproach in his tone was 
quite beyond description when he said, “ Little 
Half Chick, little Half Chick, when Z was in 
trubbul you would n’t help me!” He heart- 
ily relished that repetition, and became more 
dramatic each time. 
Through it all, in the tones of the tender 
little voice, the sidewise pose of the neat dark 
head, and the occasional use of a chubby 
pointing finger, one could trace a vague re- 
flection of the teacher’s manner. It was not 
strong enough to dominate at all over the 
child’s personality, but it was strong enough 
to suggest possibilities. 
In different rooms, I was told “The Half 
Chick,” “The Little Red Hen,” “The Three 
Bears,” “The Red-Headed Woodpecker,’’ 
“The Fox and the Grapes,” and many other 
simple stories, and in every instance there was
-P-A-G-E-139
  
SPECIFIC SCHOOLROOM USES 1 
a noticeable degree of spontaneity and com- 
mand of expression. 
When the reading classes were held, the 
influence of this work was very visible. It 
had crept into the teachers’ method, as well 
as the children’s attitude. The story-interest 
was still paramount. In the discussion, in the 
teachers’ remarks, and in the actual reading, 
there was a joyousness and an interest in the 
subject-matter which totally precluded that 
preoccupation with sounds and syllables so 
deadly to any real progress in reading. There 
was less of the mechanical in the reading than 
in any I had heard in my visits to schools; 
but it was exceptionally accurate. 
The second: form of giving back which has 
proved a keen pleasure and a stimulus to 
growth, is a kind of “ seat-work.” The children 
are allowed to make original illustrations of 
the stories by cutting sill aiboaais pictures. — 
It will be readily seen that no child can do 
this without visualizing each image very per- 
fectly. In the simplest and most unconscious 
way possible, the small artists are developing 
the power of conceiving and holding the con- 
crete image of an idea given, the power which 
is at the bottom of all arts of expression.    
   
 
-P-A-G-E-140
HOW TO TELL STORIES ‘ 
Through the kindness of Miss Sweeney, I 
am able to insert several of these illustrations. 
They are entirely original, and were made with- 
out any thought of such a use as this. 
The pictures and the retelling are both 
popular with children, but neither is as dear 
to them as the third form of reproduction 
of which I wish to speak. This third kind is 
taken entirely on the ground of play, and no 
visibly didactic element enters into it. It con- 
sists simply of playing the story. 
When a good story with a simple sequence 
has been told, and while the children are still 
athrill with the delight of it, they are told they 
may play it. 
“ Who would like to be Red Ridinghood ?” 
says the teacher; up go the little girls’ hands, 
and Mary or Hannah or Gertrude is chosen. 
“ Who will be the wolf?” Johnny or Mar- 
cus becomes the wolf. The kind woodchopper 
and the mother are also happily distributed, 
for in these little dramatic companies it is an 
all-star cast, and no one realizes any indignity 
in a subordinate téle. 
“Now, where shall we have little Red Rid- 
inghood’s house? ‘Over in that corner,’ 
Katie? Very well, Ridinghood shall live

eh a ““THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE”

over there. And where shall the grandmother’s 
cottage be?” 
The children decide that it must be a long 
distance through the wood, — half-way round 
the schoolroom, in fact. The wolf selects the 
spot where he will meet Red Ridinghood, and 
the woodchopper chooses a position from which 
he can rush in at the critical moment, to save 
Red Ridinghood’s life. 
Then, with gusto good to see, they play the 
game. The teacher makes no suggestions ; 
each actor creates his part. Some children 
prove extremely expressive and facile, while 
others are limited by nature. But each is left 
to his spontaneous action. 
In the course of several days several sets of 
children have been allowed to try ; then if any 
of them are notably good in the several réles, 
they are given an especial privilege in that 
story, as was done with the retelling. When 
a child expresses a part badly, the teacher some- 
times asks if any one thinxs of another way 
to do it; from different examples offered, the 
children then choose the one they prefer ; this 
is adopted. At no point is the teacher appar- 
ently teaching. She lets the audience teach

120 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
The children played a good many stories 
for me during my visit in Providence. Of 
them all, “ Red Ridinghood,” “The Fox and 
the Grapes,” and “ The Lion and the Mouse” 
were most vividly done. 
It will be long before the chief of the Little 
Red Ridinghoods fades from my memory. She 
had a dark, foreign little face, with a good deal 
of darker hair tied back from it, and brown, 
expressive hands. Her eyes were so full of 
dancing lights that when they met mine unex- 
pectedly it was as if a chance reflection had 
dazzled me. When she was told that she 
night play, she came up for her riding hood 
like an embodied delight, almost dancing as 
she moved. (Her teacher used a few simple 
elements of stage-setting for her stories, such 
as bowls for the Bears, a cape for Riding- 
hood, and so on.) 
The game began at once. Ridinghood 
started from the rear corner of the room, bas- 
ket on arm ; her mother gave her strict injunc- 
tions as to lingering on the way, and she re- 
turned a respectful “ Yes, mother.” Then she 
trotted round the aisle, greeting the wood- 
chopper on the way, to the deep wood which 
lay close by the teacher’s desk. There master

wolf was waiting, and there the two held con- 
verse, — master wolf very crafty indeed, Red 
Ridinghood extremely polite. The wolf then 
darted on ahead and crouched down in the 
corner which represented grandmother’s bed. 
Ridinghood tripped sedately to the imaginary 
door, and knocked. The familiar dialogue fol- 
lowed, and with the words “ the better to eat 
you with, my dear!” the wolf clutched Red 
Ridinghood, to eat her up. But we were not 
forced to undergo the threatened scene of hor- 
rid carnage, as the wood-chopper opportunely 
arrived, and stated calmly, “I will not let you 
kill Little Red Ridinghood.” 
All was now happily culminated, and with 
the chopper’s grave injunction as to future 
conduct in her ears, the rescued heroine tip- 
toed out of the woods, to her seat. 
I wanted to applaud, but I realized in the 
nick of time that we were all playing, and held 
my peace. 
“The Fox and the Grapes” was more dra- 
matically done, but was given by a single child. 
He was the chosen “ fox” of another primary 
room, and had the fair coloring and sturdy 
frame which matched his Swedish name. He 
was naturally dramatic. It was easy to see that
-P-A-G-E-147
  
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  124 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
he instinctively visualized everything, and this 
he did so strongly that he suggested to the 
onlooker every detail of the scene. 
He chose for his grape-trellis the rear wall 
of the room. 
Standing there, he looked longingly up at 
the invisible bunch of grapes. “My gracious,” 
he said, “ what fine grapes! I will have some.” 
Then he jumped for them. 
“ Did n’t get them,” he muttered, “Ill try 
again,” and he jumped higher. 
“Didn’t get them this time,” he said dis- 
gustedly, and hopped up once more. Then he 
stood still, looked up, shrugged his shoulders, 
and remarked in an absurdly worldly-wise 
tone, “ Those grapes are sour!” After which 
he walked away. 
Of course the whole thing was infantile, and 
without a touch of grace; but it is no exag- 
geration to say that the child did what many 
grown-up actors fail to do, —he preserved the 
illusion. : 
It was in still another room that I saw the 
lion and mouse fable played. 
The lion lay flat on the floor for his nap, 
but started up when he found his paw laid on 
the little mouse, who crouched as small as she

could beside him. (The mouse was by nature 
rather larger than the lion, but she called 
what art she might to her assistance.) The 
mouse persuaded the lion to lift his paw, and 
ran away. 
Presently a most horrific groaning emanated 
from the lion. The mouse ran up, looked him 
over, and soliloquized in precise language, — 
evidently remembered, “ What is the matter 
with the lion? Oh, I see; he is caught in a 
trap.” And then she gnawed with her teeth 
at the imaginary rope which bound him. 
“What makes you so kind to me, little 
Mouse,” said the rescued lion. 
“You let me go, when I asked you,” said 
the mouse demurely. 
“Thank you, little Mous.. . ~swered the 
lion; and therewith, finis. 3 
It is not impossible that all this play atmo- 
sphere may seem incongruous and unnecessary 
to teachers used to more conventional methods, 
but I feel:sure that an actual experience of it 
would modify that point of view conclusively. : 
The children of the schools where story-tell- ~ 
ing and “ dramatizing” were practiced were 
startlingly better in reading, in attentiveness, 
and in general power of expression, than the

pupils of like social conditions in the same 
grades of other cities which I visited soon 
after, and in which the more conventional 
methods were exclusively used. The teachers, 
also, were stronger in power of expression. 
_But the most noticeable, though the-least : 
f tangible, difference was in the moral | atmo- 
sphere of the schoolroom, There had been a 
great gain in vitality in all the rooms where 
stories were a part of the work. Jt had acted 
and reacted on pupils and teachers alike. The 
telling of a story well so depends on being 
thoroughly vitalized that, naturally, habitual: 
telling had resulted in habitual vitalization. 
This result was not, of course, wholly due to 
the practice of story-telling, but it was in some 
measure drv~to- that, And it was a result worth 
vue ertort. on, 
I beg to urge these specific uses of stories, as 
both recreative and developing, and as espe- 
cially tending toward enlarged power of ex- 
pression : retelling the story ;-illustrating the 
story in seat-work ; dramatization.

Five little white heads peeped out of the mould, 
When the dew was damp and the night was cold ; 
And they crowded their way through the soil with 
pride ; 
“Hurrah! We are going to be mushrooms!” they 
cried. 
But the sun came up, and the sun shone down, 
And the little white heads were withered and

Long were their faces, their pride had a fall — 
They were nothing but toad-stools, after all.

I lived first in a little house, 
And lived there very well ; 
I thought the world was small and round, 
And made of pale blue shell. 
I lived next in a little nest, 
Nor needed any other ; 
I thought the world was made of straw, 
And brooded by my mother. 
‘One day I fluttered from the nest 
To see what I could find. 
I said, “The world is made of leaves ; 
I have been very blind.” 
At length I flew beyond the tree, 
Quite fit for grown-up labors.

rosebud woke up, and saw the sun looking 
at her. He stared so hard that the little white 
rosebud did not know what to do; so she 
looked up at kim and said, “Why are you

RAGGYLUG? 
Once there was a little furry rabbit, who 
lived with his mother deep down in a nest 
under the long grass. His name was Raggy- 
lug, and his mother’s name was Molly Cotton- 
tail. Every morning, when Molly Cottontail 
went out to hunt for food, she said to Raggy- 
lug, “Now Raggylug, lie still, and make no 
noise. No matter what you hear, no matter 
what you see, don’t you move. Remember 
you are only a baby rabbit, and lie low.” 
And Raggylug always said he would: 
One day, after his mother had gone, he was 
lying very still in the nest, looking up through 
the feathery grass. By just cocking his eye,

Animals I have known.”

  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 181 
so, he could see what was going on up in the 
world. Once a big blue-jay perched on a twig 
above him, and scolded some one very loudly ; 
he kept saying, “ Thief! thief!” But Ragey- 
lug never moved his nose, nor his paws; he 
lay still. Once a lady-bug took a walk down 
a blade of grass, over his head; she was so 
top-heavy that pretty soon she tumbled off 
and fell to the bottom, and had to begin all 
over again. But Raggylug never moved his 
nose nor his paws; he lay still. 
The sun was warm, and it was very still. 
Suddenly Raggylug heard a little sound, 
far off. It sounded like “Swish, swish,” very 
soft and far away. He listened. It was a 
queer little sound, low down in ‘the grass, 
“ rustle— rustle — rustle;” Raggylug was 
interested. But he never moved his nose or 
his paws; he lay still. Then the sound came 
nearer, “ rustle — rustle — rustle ;” then grew 
fainter, then came nearer ; in and out, nearer 
and nearer, like something coming; only, 
when Raggylug heard anything coming he 
always heard its feet, stepping ever so softly. 
What could it be that came so smoothly, — 
rustle — rustle — without any feet ? 
He forgot his mother’s warning, and sat up
-P-A-G-E-156
  182 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
on his hind paws; the sound stopped then. 
“ Pooh,” thought Raggylug, “I’m not a baby 
rabbit, I am three weeks old; I’ll find out 
what this is.” He stuck his head over the top 
of the nest, and looked — straight into the 
wicked eyes of a great big snake. “ Mammy, 
Mammy!” screamed Raggylug, “Oh, Mammy, 
Mam—” But he couldn’t scream any more, 
for the big snake had his ear in his mouth and 
was winding about the soft little body, squeez- 
ing Raggylug’s life out. He tried to call 
“Mammy !” again, but he could not breathe. 
Ah, but Mammy had heard the first ery. 
“Straight over the fields she flew, leaping the 
stones and hummocks, fast as the wind, to save 
her baby. She wasn’t a timid little cottontail 
rabbit then; she was a mother whose child was 
in danger. And when she came to Raggylug 
and the big snake, she took one look, and then 
hop! hop! she went over the snake’s back ; and 
as she jumped she struck at the snake with her 
strong hind claws so that they tore his skin. 
He hissed with rage, but he did not let go. 
Hop! hop! she went again, and this time 
she hurt him so that he twisted and turned ;- 
but he held on to Raggylug. 
Once more the mother rabbit hopped, and

once more she struck and tore the snake’s back 
with her sharp claws. Zzz! How she hurt! 
The snake dropped Raggy to strike at her, 
and Raggy rolled on to his feet and ran. 
“Run, Raggylug, run!” said his mother, 
keeping the snake busy with her jumps; and 
you may believe Raggylug ran! Just as soon 
as he was out of the way his mother came too, 
and showed him where to go. When she ran, 
there was a little white patch that showed 
under her tail; that was for Raggy to follow, 
—he followed it now. 
Far, far away she led him, through the long 
_ grass, to a place where the big snake could not 
find him, and there she madea new nest. And 
this time, when she told Raggylug to lie low 
you ’d better believe he minded ! 
THE GOLDEN COBWEBS? 
A STORY TO TELL BY THE CHRISTMAS TREE 
I am going to tell you a story about some- 
thing wonderful that happened to a Christmas 
tree like this, ever and ever so long ago, when 
it was once upon a time.

man friend, at the kindly instance of a common friend of 
both ; the narrator had heard it at home from the lips of w

184 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
It was before Christmas, and the tree was 
all trimmed with pop-corn and silver nuts and 
(name the trimmings of the tree before you), 
and stood safely out of sight in a room where 
the doors were locked, so that the children 
should not see it before it was time. But ever 
so many other little house-people had seen it. 
The big black pussy saw it with her great 
green eyes; the little gray kitty saw it with 
her little blue eyes; the kind house-dog saw 
it with his steady brown eyes; the yellow 
canary saw it with his wise, bright eyes. Even 
the wee, wee mice that were so afraid of the 
cat had peeped one peek when no one was by. 
But there was some one who had n’t seen the 
Christmas tree. It was the little gray spider! 
You see, the spiders lived in the corners, — 
the warm corners of the sunny attic and the 
dark corners of the nice cellar. And they were 
expecting to see the Christmas Tree as much 
as anybody. But just before Christmas a great 
cleaning-up began in the house. The house- 
mother came sweeping and dusting and wip- 
father of story-loving children for whom he often invented 
such little tales. The present adaptation has passed by hear- 
say through so many minds that it is perhaps little like the 
original, but I venture to hope it has a touch of the original 
fancy, at least.

ing and scrubbing, to make everything grand 
and clean for the Christ-child’s birthday. Her 
broom went into all the corners, poke, poke, 
— and of course the spiders had to run. Dear, 
dear, how the spiders had to run! Not one 
could stay in the house while the Christmas 
cleanness lasted. So, you see, they could n’t 
see the Christmas Tree. 
Spiders like to know all about everything, 
and see all there is to see, and they were very 
sad. So at last they went to the Christ-child 
and told him all about it. 
“ All the others see the Christmas Tree, dear 
Christ-child,” they said; “but we, who are 
so domestic and so fond of beautiful things, 
we are cleaned up! We cannot see it, at 
all.” 
The Christ-child was sorry for the little 
spiders when he heard this, and he said they 
should see the Christmas Tree. 
The day before Christmas, when nobody 
was noticing, he let them all go in, to look as 
long as ever they liked. 
They came creepy, creepy, down the attic 
stairs, creepy, creepy, up the cellar stairs, 
creepy, creepy, along the halls, — and into the 
beautiful room. The fat mother spiders and

the old papa spiders were there, and all the 
little teenty, tonty, curly spiders, the baby 
ones. And then they looked! Round and 
round the tree they crawled, and looked and 
looked and looked. Oh, what a good time they 
had! They thought it was perfectly beautiful. 
And when they had looked at everything they 
could see from the floor, they started up the 
tree to see more. All over the tree they ran, 
creepy, crawly, looking at every single thing. 
Up and down, in and out, over every branch 
and twig, the little spiders ran, and saw every 
one of the pretty things right up close. 
They stayed till they had seen all there was 
to see, you may be sure, and then they went 
away at last, quite happy. 
Then, in the still, dark night before Christ- 
mas Day, the dear Christ-child came, to bless 
the tree for the children. But when he looked 
at it — what do you suppose ? — it was cov- 
ered with cobwebs! Everywhere the little 
spiders had been they had left a spider-web ; 
and you know they had been just everywhere. 
So the tree was covered from its trunk to its 
tip with spider-webs, all hanging from the 
branches and looped around the twigs ; it was 
a strange sight.

  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 1387 
What could the Christ-child do? He knew 
that house-mothers do not like cobwebs; it 
would never, never do to have a Christmas 
Tree covered with those. No, indeed. 
So the dear Christ-child touched the spi- 
ders’ webs, and turned them all to gold! 
Was n’t that a lovely trimming? They shone 
and shone, all over the beautiful tree. And 
that is the way the Christmas Tree came to 
have golden cobwebs on it. 
WHY THE MORNING-GLORY CLIMBS? 
Once the Morning-Glory was flat on the 
ground. She grew that way, and she had 
never climbed at all. Up in the top of a tree 
near her lived Mrs. Jennie Wren and her little 
baby Wren. The little Wren was lame; he 
had a broken wing and couldn’t fly. He 
stayed in the nest all day. But the mother 
Wren told him all about what she saw in the 
world, when she came flying home at night. 
She used to tell him about the beautiful Morn- 
ing-Glory she saw on the ground. She told him 
about the Morning-Glory every day, until the

little Wren was filled with a desire to see her 
for himself. 
“How I wish I could see the Morning- 
Glory!” he said. 
The Morning-Glory heard this, and she 
longed to let the little Wren see her face. She 
pulled herself along the ground, a little at a 
time, until she was at the foot of the tree where 
the little Wren lived. But she could not get any 
farther, because she did not know how to climb. 
At last she wanted to go up so much, that she 
caught hold of the bark of the tree, and pulled 
herself up a little. And little by little, before 
she knew it, she was climbing. 
And she climbed way up the tree to the lit- 
tle Wren’s nest, and put her sweet face over 
the edge of the nest, where the little Wren 
could see. 
That was how the Morning-Glory came to 
climb. 
THE STORY OF LITTLE TAVWOTS?

But once, long ago, Tavwots was not little, 
— he was the largest of all four-footed things, 
and a mighty hunter. He used to hunt every 
day ; as soon as it was day, and light enough 
to see, he used to get up, and go to his hunt- 
ing. But every day he saw the track of a 
great foot on the trail, before him. This 
troubled him, for his pride was as big as his 
body. 
“Who is this,” he cried, “ that goes before 
me to the hunting, and makes so great a 
stride? Does he think to put me to shame?” 
“'T’-sst !” said his mother, “there is none 
greater than thou.” 
“ Still, there are the footprints in the trail,” 
said Tavwots. 
And the next morning he got up earlier; 
but still the great footprints and the mighty 
stride were before him. The next morning he 
got up still earlier; but there were the mighty 
foot-tracks and the long, long stride. 
“ Now I will set me a trap for this impudent 
fellow,” said Tavwots, for he was very cun- 
ning. So he made a snare of his bow-string 
and set it in the trail overnight. 
And when in the morning he went to look, 
behold, he had caught the sun in his snare!

All that part of the earth was beginning to 
smoke with the heat of it. 
“Ts it you who made the tracks in my 
trail?” cried Tavwots. 
“Tt is I,” said the sun; “come and set me 
free, before the whole earth is afire.” 
Then Tavwots saw what he had to do, and 
he drew his sharp hunting-knife and ran to 
cut the bow-string. But the heat was so great 
that he ran back before he had done it; and 
when he ran back he was melted down to half 
his size! Then the earth began to burn, and 
the smoke curled up against the sky. 
“Come again, Tavwots,” cried the sun. 
And Tavwots ran again to cut the bow- 
string. But the heat was so great that he ran 
back before he had done it, and he was melted 
down to a quarter of his size! 
“ Come again, Tavwots, and quickly,” cried 
the sun, “or all the world will be burnt up.” 
And Tavwots ran again; this time he cut 
the bow-string and set the sun free. But when 
he got back he was melted down to the size 
he is now! Only one thing is left of all his 
greatness: you may still see by the print of 
his feet as he leaps in the trail, how great his 
stride was when he caught the sun in his snare.

Presently a squirrel came along, whisking

“T have set everything to rights,” she said, 
“and so it must stay. Now, will you go with 
the Pig Brother, or will you come back with 
me, and be a tidy child?” 
“With you, with you!” cried the child; 
and he clung to the Angel’s dress.

The Pig Brother grunted. 
“ Small loss!” he said. “ There will be all 
the more wash for me!” And he trotted 
off. 
THE COOKY? 
A child quarreled with his brother one day 
about a cooky. 
“Tt is my cooky!” said the child. 
“ No, it is mine!” said his brother. 
“ You shall not have it!” said the child. 
“Give it to me this minute!” And he fell 
upon his brother and beat him. 
Just then came by an Angel who knew the 
child. 
“ Who is this that you are beating?” asked 
the Angel. 
“Tt is my brother,” said the child. 
“No, but truly,” said the Angel, “who is 
it?” 
“Tt is my brother, I tell you!” said the 
child. 
“ Oh, no,” said the Angel, “that cannot be ; 
and it seems a pity for you to tell an untruth, 
because that makes spots on your soul. If it 
were your brother, you would not beat him.”

“ But he has my cooky !” said the child. 
“ Oh,” said the Angel, “ now I see my mis- 
take. You mean that the cooky is your bro-

not look like a very good cooky, —and, be-

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN TOWN! 
Once I was way over across the ocean, in a 
country called Germany ; and I went to a funny 
little town, where all the streets ran uphill. 
At the top there was a big mountain, steep 
like the roof of a house, and at the bottom 
there was a big river, broad and slow. And 
the funniest thing about the little town was 
that all the stores had the same thing in them ; 
bakers’ shops, grocers’ shops, everywhere we 
went we saw the same thing, — big chocolate 
rats, rats and mice, made out of chocolate 
candy. We were surprised about it after a 
while. “Why do you have rats in your stores ?” 
we asked them. 
“Don’t you know this is Hamelin town?” 
they said. “ What of that ?” said we. “ Why, 
Hamelin town is where the Pied Piper came,”

Pied Piper of Hamelin.” ©

they told us; “surely you know about the 
F Pied Piper?” “ What about the Pied Piper?” 
we said. And this is what they told us about 
him. 
It seems that once, long, long ago, that little 
town was dreadfully troubled with rats. The 
houses were full of them, the stores were full 
of them, the churches were full of them, they 
were everywhere. The people were just about 
eaten out of house and home. Those rats, 
They fought the dogs and killed the cats, 
And bit the babies in the eradles, 
And ate the cheeses out of the vats, 
And licked the soup from the cooks’ own ladles, 
Split open the kegs of salted sprats, 
Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats, 
And even spoiled the women’s chats 
By drowning their speaking 
With shrieking and squeaking 
In fifty different sharps and flats ! 
At last it got so bad that the people simply 
could n’t stand it any longer. So they all came 
together and went to the town hall, and they 
said to the Mayor (you know what a mayor 
is?), “See here, what do we pay you your 
salary for? What are you good for, if you 
can’t do a little thing like getting rid of these 
rats? You just go to work and clear the town

of them; find the remedy that’s lacking, or 
— we ’ll send you packing !” 
Well, the poor Mayor was in a terrible way. 
What to do he didn’t know. He sat there 
with his head in his hands, and thought and 
thought and thought. 
Suddenly there came a little rat-rat at the 
door. Oh! how the Mayor jumped! His poor 
old heart went pit-a-pat at anything like the 
sound of a rat. But it was only the scraping 
of shoes on the mat. So the Mayor sat up, and 
said, “ Come in!” 
And in came the strangest figure! It was 
a man, very tall and very thin, with a sharp 
chin and a mouth where the smiles went out 
and in, and two blue eyes, each like a pin ; and 
he was dressed half in red and half in yellow, 
— he really was the strangest fellow !—and 
round his neck he had a long red and yellow 
ribbon, and on it was hung a thing something 
like a flute, and his fingers went straying up 
and down it as if he wanted to be playing. 
He came up tothe Mayor and said, “TI hear 
you are troubled with rats in this town.” 
“J should say we were,” groaned the Mayor. 
‘ Would you like to get rid of them? Ican 
do it for you.” 
“ae

“You can?” cried the Mayor. “How? 
Who are you, any way?” 
“ Men call me the Pied Piper,” said the man, 
“and I know a way to draw after me every- 
thing that walks, or flies, orswims. What will 
you give me if I rid your town of rats?” 
“ Anything, anything,” said the Mayor. 
“T don’t believe you can do it, but if you can, 
— I'll give you five thousand dollars.” 
“ Allright,” said the Piper, “itis a bargain.” 
And then he went to the door and stepped 
out into the street and stood, and put the long 
flute-like thing to his lips, and began to play 
a little tune. A strange, high, little tune. And 
before three shrill notes the pipe uttered, 
You heard as if an army muttered; 
And the muttering grew to a grumbling; 
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; 
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling ! 
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, 
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats, 
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers, 
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, 
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers, 
Families by tens and dozens, 
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives — 
Followed the Piper for their lives ! 
From street to street he piped, advancing, 
from street to street they followed, dancing.

Up one street and down another, till they came 
right down to the edge of the big river, and 
there the piper turned sharply about and 
stepped aside, and all those rats tambled hurry 
skurry, head over heels, down the bank into 
the river and — were — drowned. Every sin- 
gle last one. Except one big old fat rat; he 
was so fat he didn’t sink, and he swam across, 
and ran away down south to live. 
Then the Piper came back to the town hall. 
And all the people were waving their hats and 
shouting for joy. The Mayor said they would 
have a big celebration, and build a tremendous 
bonfire in the middle of the town. He asked 
the Piper to stay and see the bonfire, — very 
politely. 
“Yes,” said the Piper, “that will be very 
nice ; but first, if you please, I should like my 
five thousand dollars.” 
“H’m,—er—ahem!” said the Mayor, 
“ You mean that little joke of mine; of course 
that was a joke” — (You see it is always 
harder to pay fora thing after it is all used up.) 
“T do not joke,” said the Piper very 
quietly ; “my five thousand dollars, if you 
please.” 
“Oh, come, now,” said the Mayor, “you

know very well it wasn’t worth five cents to 
play a little tune like that; call it five dol- 
lars, and let it go at that.” 
“A bargain is a bargain,” said the Piper ; 
“ for the last time, — will you give me my five 
thousand dollars?” 
“T’ll give youa pipe of tobacco, something 
good to eat, and call you lucky at that!” said 
the Mayor, tossing his head. 
Then the Piper’s mouth grew strange and 
thin, and sharp blue and green lights began 
dancing in his eyes, and he said to the Mayor 
very softly, “ I know another tune than that I 
played ; I play it to those who play me false.” 
“ Play what you please! You can’t frighten 
me! Do your worst!” said the Mayor, mak- 
ing himself big. 
Then the Piper stood high up on the steps 
of the town hall, and put the pipe to his lips, 
and began to play a little tune. It was quite 
a different little tune, this time, very soft and 
sweet, and very, very strange. And before he 
had played three notes, you heard 
a rustling, that seemed like a bustling 
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling ; 
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, 
Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering, 
And like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,

Out came the children running. 
All the little boys and girls, 
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, 
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, 
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after 
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter. 
“Stop, stop!” cried the people, “ He is 
taking our children! Stop him, Mayor!” 
“T will give you your money, I will!” cried 
the Mayor, and tried to run after the Piper. 
But the very same music that made the chil- 
dren dance made the grown-up people stand 
stock-still; it was as if their feet had been 
tied to the ground; they could not move a 
muscle. There they stood and saw the Piper 
move slowly down the street, playing his little 
tune, with the children at his heels. On and 
on he went; on and on the children danced ; 
till he came to the bank of the river. 
“Oh, oh! He will drown our children in the 
river!” cried the people. But the Piper turned 
and went along by the bank, and all the chil- 
dren followed after. Up, and up, and up the 
hill they went, straight toward the mountain 
which is like the roof of a house. And just as 
they got to it, the mountain opened, —like two 
great doors, and the Piper went in through the 
opening, playing the little tune, and the chil-
-P-A-G-E-176

dren danced after him —and— just as they 
got through —the great doors slid together 
again and shut them all in! Every single last 
one. Except one little lame child, who could n’t 
keep up with the rest and did n’t get there in 
time. And they never came back any more 
at all, never. 
But years and years afterward, when the 
fat old rat who swam across the river was a 
grandfather, his children used to ask him, 
“What made you follow the music, Grand- 
father?”’ and he used to tell them, “My 
dears, when I heard that tune I thought I 
heard the moving aside of pickle-tub boards, 
and the leaving ajar of preserve cupboards, 
and I smelled the most delicious old cheese in 
the world, and I saw sugar barrels ahead of me ; 
and then, just as a great yellow cheese seemed 
to be saying, ‘Come, bore me’—I felt the 
river rolling o’er me!” 
And in the same way the people asked 
the little lame child, “ What made you follow 
the music?” “I do not know what the 
others heard,” he said, “but I, when the 
Piper began to-play, I heard a voice that 
told of a wonderful country just ahead, where 
the bees had no stings and the horses. had

wings, and the trees bore wonderful fruits, 
where no one was tired or lame, and children 
played all day ; and just as the beautiful coun- 
try was one step away — the mountain closed 
on my playmates, and I was left alone.” 
That was all the people ever knew. The 
children never came back. All that was left 
of the Piper and the rats was just the big 
street that led to the river; so they called it 
the Street of the Pied Piper. 
And that is the end of the story.

WHY THE EVERGREEN TREES KEEP THEIR 
LEAVES IN WINTER.? 
One day, a long, long time ago, it was very 
cold; winter was coming. And all the birds 
flew away to the warm south, to wait for the 
spring. But one little bird had a broken wing 
and could not fly. He did not know what to 
do. He looked all round, to see if there were 
any place where he could keep warm. And he 
saw the trees of the great forest. 
“Perhaps the trees will keep me warm 
through the winter,” he said. 
So he went to the edge of the forest, hop-

Myths.”

ping and fluttering with his broken wing. The 
first tree he came to was a slim silver birch. 
“ Beautiful birch-tree,” he said, “ will you 
let me live in your warm branches until the 
springtime comes?” 
“Dear me!” said the birch-tree, “what a 
thing to ask! I have to take care of my own 
leaves through the winter; that is enough for 
me. Go away.” 
The little bird hopped and fluttered with 
his broken wing until he came to the next tree. 
It was a great, big oak-tree. 
“O big oak-tree,” said the little bird, “ will 
you let me live in your warm branches until 
the springtime comes ?” 
“ Dear me,” said the oak-tree, “what a thing 
to ask! If you stay in my branches all winter 
you will be eating my acorns. Go away.” 
So the little bird hopped and fluttered with 
his broken wing till he came to the willow- 
tree by the edge of the brook. 
“O beautiful willow-tree,” said the little 
bird, “will you let me live in your warm 
branches until the springtime comes ?” 
“No, indeed,” said the willow-tree; “I 
never speak to strangers. Go away.” 
The poor little bird did not know where to
-P-A-G-E-179
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 1658 
go; but he hopped and fluttered along with 
his broken wing. Pretty soon the spruce-tree 
saw him, and said, “ Where are you going, 
little bird ?” 
“JT do not know,” said the bird ; “ the trees 
will not let me live with them, and my wing 
is broken so that I cannot fly.” 
“ You may live on one of my branches,” said 
the spruce; “here is the warmest one of all.” 
“ But may I stay all winter?” 
“Yes,” said the spruce; “I shall like to 
have you.” 
The pine-tree stood beside the spruce, and 
when he saw the little bird hopping and flut- 
tering with his broken wing, he said, “My 
branches are not very warm, but I can keep 
the wind off because I am big and strong.” 
So the little bird fluttered up into the warm 
branch of the spruce, and the pine-tree kept 
the wind off his house; then the juniper-tree 
saw what was going on, and said that she 
would give the little bird his dinner all winter, 
from her juniper berries. Juniper berries are 
very good for little birds. 
The little bird was very comfortable in his 
warm nest sheltered from the wind, with juni- 
per berries to eat.

The trees at the edge of the forest saw it 
all. 
“T would n’t take care of a strange bird,” 
said the birch. 
“T would n’t risk my acorns,” said the oak. 
“JT would not speak to strangers,” said the 
willow. And the three trees stood up very tall 
and proud. 
That night the North Wind came to the 
woods to play. He puffed at the leaves with 
his icy breath, and every leaf he touched fell 
to the ground. He wanted to touch every leaf 
in the forest, and.see all the trees bare. 
“ May I touch every leaf?” he said to his 
father, the Frost King. 
“No,” said the Frost King, “the trees 
which were kind to the bird with the broken 
wing may keep their leaves.” 
So North Wind had to leave them alone, 
and the spruce, the pine, and the juniper-tree 
kept their leaves all winter. And they have 
done it ever since. 
THE STAR DOLLARS.? 
There was once a little girl who was very, 
very poor. Her father and mother had died,

and at last she had no little room to stay in, 
and no little bed to sleep in, and nothing 
more to eat except one piece of bread. So she 
said a prayer, put on her little jacket and her 
hood, and took her piece of bread in her hand, 
and went out into the world. 
When she had walked a little way, she met 
an old man, bent and thin. He looked at the 
piece of bread in her hand, and said, “ Will 
you give me your bread, little girl? I am 
very hungry.” The little girl said, “ Yes,” and 
gave him her piece of bread. 
When she had walked a little farther she 
came upon a child, sitting by the path, crying. 
“JT am so cold!” said the child. “ Won't 
you give me your little hood, to keep my head 
warm?” The little girl took off her hood 
and tied it on the child’s head. Then she 
went on her way. 
After a time, as she went, she met another 
child. This one shivered with the cold, and 
she said to the little girl, “ Won’t you give 
me your little jacket, little girl?” And the 
little girl gave her her jacket. Then she went 
on again. 
By and by she saw another child, crouching 
almost naked by the wayside. “ little girl,”

said the child, “won’t you give me your 
dress? I have nothing to keep me warm.” 
So the little girl took off her dress and gave 
it to the other child. And now she had no- 
thing left but her little shirt. It grew dark, 
and the wind was cold, and the little girl crept 
into the woods, to sleep for the night. But in 
the woods a child stood, weeping and naked. 
“T am cold,” she said, “give me your little 
shirt!” And the little girl thought, “Tt is 
dark, and the woods will shelter me; I will 
give her my little shirt ;” so she did, and now 
she had nothing left in all the world. 
She stood looking up at the sky, to say 
her night-time prayer. As she looked up, the 
whole skyful of stars fell in a shower round 
her feet. There they were, on the ground, 
shining bright, and round. The little girl saw 
that they were silver dollars. And in the 
midst of them was the finest little shirt, all 
woven out of silk! The little girl put on the 
little silk shirt, and gathered up the star dol- 
lars; and she was rich, all the days of her 
life.

THE CAT AND THE PARROT 
Once there was a cat, and a parrot. And they 
had agreed to ask each other to dinner, turn 
_ and turn about: first the cat should ask the 
parrot, then the parrot should invite the cat, 
and so on. It was the cat’s turn first. 
Now the cat was very mean. He provided 
nothing at all for dinner except a pint of 
milk, a little slice of fish, and a biscuit. The 
parrot was too polite to complain, but he did 
not have a very good time. 
When it was his turn to invite the cat, he 
cooked a fine dinner. He had a roast of meat, 
a pot of tea, a basket of fruit, and, best of all, 
he baked a whole clothes-basketful of little 
cakes !— little, brown, crispy, spicy cakes! 
Oh, I should say as many as five hundred. 
And he put four hundred and ninety-eight of 
the cakes before the cat, keeping only two for 
himself. 
Well, the cat ate the roast, and drank the 
tea, and sucked the fruit, and then he began 
on the pile of cakes. He ate all the four hun- 
: a

dred and ninety-eight cakes, and then he looked 
round and said : — 
“T’m hungry; haven’t you anything to eat?” 
“Why,” said the parrot, “here are my two 
cakes, if you want them?” 
The cat ate up the two cakes, and then he 
licked his chops and said, “I am beginning to 
get an appetite ; have you anything to eat?” 
“Well, really,” said the parrot, who was 
now rather angry, “I don’t see anything more, 
unless you wish to eat me!” He thought the 
cat would be ashamed when he heard that — 
but the cat just looked at him and licked his 
chops again, — and slip! slop! gobble! down 
his throat went the parrot! 
Then the cat started down the street. An 
old woman was standing by, and she had 
seen the whole thing, and she was shocked 
that the cat should eat his friend. “ Why, 
cat!” she said, “ how dreadful of you to eat 
your friend the parrot!” 
“ Parrot, indeed!” said the cat. “ What’s a 
parrot to me? —I’ve a great mind to eat you, 
too.” And—before you could say “Jack 
Robinson” — slip! slop! gobble! down went 
the old woman ! 
Then the cat started down the road again,
-P-A-G-E-185
CN NT Ten ge ne ee ee 
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 161 
walking like this, because he felt so fine. 
Pretty soon he met a man driving a donkey. 
The man was beating the donkey, to hurry him 
up, and when he saw the cat he said, “ Get out 
of my way, cat; I’m in a hurry and my donkey 
might tread on you.” 
“ Donkey, indeed!” said the cat, “much I 
care for a donkey! I have eaten five hundred 
cakes, I’ve eaten my friend the parrot, I’ve 
eaten an old woman, — what’s to hinder my 
eating a miserable man and a donkey ?” 
And slip! slop! gobble! down went the old 
man and the donkey. 
Then the cat walked on down the road, 
jauntily, like this. After a little, he meta pro- 
cession, coming that way. The king was at 
the head, walking proudly with his newly mar- 
ried bride, and behind him were his soldiers, 
marching, and behind them were ever and ever 
so many elephants, walking two by two. The 
king felt very kind to everybody, because he 
had just been married, and he said to the cat, 
“ Get out of my way, pussy, get out of my way, 
—nmy elephants might hurt you.” 
“urt me!” said the cat, shaking his fat 
sides. “Ho, ho! I’ve eaten five hundred cakes, 
I’ve eaten my friend the parrot, I’ve eaten an

old woman, I’ve eaten a man and a donkey; 
what’s to hinder my eating a beggarly king?” 
And slip! slop! gobble! down went the 
king; down went the queen; down went the 
soldiers, —and down went all the elephants! 
Then the cat went on, more slowly ; he had 
really had enough to eat, now. But a little 
farther on he met two land-crabs, scuttling 
along in the dust. “Get out of our way, 
pussy,” they squeaked. 
“Ho, ho ho!” cried the cat in a terrible 
voice. “I’ve eaten five hundred cakes, I’ve 
eaten my friend the parrot, I’ve eaten an old 
woman, a man with a donkey, a king, a queen, 
his men-at-arms, and all his elephants; and 
now [’ll eat you too.” 
And slip! slop! gobble! down went the 
two land-crabs. 
When the land-crabs got down inside, they 
began to look around. It was very dark, but 
they could see the poor king sitting in a corner 
with his bride on his arm; she had fainted. 
Near them were the men-at-arms, treading on 
one another’s toes, and the elephants, still 
trying to form in twos, — but they could n’t, 
because there was not room. In the opposite 
corner sat the old woman, and near her stood

the man and his donkey. But in the other 
corner was a great pile of cakes, and by them 
perched the parrot, his feathers all drooping. 
“TLet’s get to work!” said the land-crabs. 
And, snip, snap, they began to make a little 
hole in the side, with their sharp claws. Snip, 
snap, snip, snap, — till it was big enough to 
get through. Then out they scuttled. 
Then out walked the king, carrying his 
bride; out marched the men-at-arms; out 
tramped the elephants, two by two; out came 
the old man, beating his donkey ; out walked 
the old woman, scolding the cat; and last of 
all, out hopped the parrot, holding a cake in 
each claw. (You remember, two cakes was all 
he wanted ? ) 
' But the poor cat had to spend the whole 
day sewing up the hole in his coat!

away Japan. The Rat Princess was so pretty 
that her father and mother were quite fool- 
ishly proud of her, and thought no one good 
enough to play with her. When she grew up, 
they would not let any of the rat princes come 
to visit her, and they decided at last that no 
one should marry her till they had found the 
most powerful person in the whole world; no 
one else was good enough. And the Father Rat 
started out to find the most powerful person 
in the whole world. The wisest and oldest rat 
in the rice field said that the Sun must be the 
most powerful person, because he made the 
rice grow and ripen; so the Rat King went 
to find the Sun. He climbed up the highest 
mountain, ran up the path of a rainbow, and 
traveled and traveled across the sky till he 
came to the Sun’s house. 
“What do you want, little brother?” the 
Sun said, when he saw him. 
“T come,” said the Rat King, very impor- 
tantly, “to offer you the hand of my daughter, 
the princess, because you are the most power- 
ful person in the world; no one else is good 
enough.” 
“Ha, ha!” laughed the jolly round Sun, and 
winked with his eye. “ You are very kind, lit-

tle brother, but if that is the case the princess 
is not for me; the Cloud is more powerful 
than I am; when he passes over me | cannot

“ Oh, indeed,” said the Rat King, “then you 
are not my man at all;” and he left the Sun 
without more words. The Sun laughed and 
winked to himself. And the Rat King traveled 
and traveled across the sky till he came to the 
Cloud’s house. 
“ What do you want, little brother?” sighed 
the Cloud when he saw him. 
“T come to offer you the hand of my daugh- 
ter, the princess,” said the Rat King, “ because 
you are the most powerful person in the 
world; the Sun said so, and no one else is 
good enough.” 
The Cloud sighed again. “I am not the 
most powerful person,” he said ; “the Wind is 
stronger than I, — when he blows, I have to 
go wherever he sends me.” 
“Then you are not the person for my daugh- 
ter,” said the Rat King proudly ; and he started 
at once to find the Wind. He traveled and 
traveled across the sky, till he came at last to the 
Wind’s house, at the very edge of the world. 
When the Wind saw him coming he laughed

a big, gusty laugh, “Ho, ho!” and asked him 
what he wanted ; and when the Rat King told 
him that he had come to offer him the Rat Prin- 
cess’s hand because he was the most powerful 
person in the world, the Wind shouted a great 
gusty shout, and said, “No, no, I am not the 
strongest; the Wall that man has made is 
stronger than I; I cannot make him move, 
with all my blowing; go to the Wall, little 
brother!” 
And the Rat King climbed down the sky- 
path again, and traveled and traveled across 
the earth till he came to the Wall. It was 
quite near his own rice field. 
“ What do you want, little brother?” grum- 
bled the Wall when he saw him. 
“T come to offer you the hand of the prin- 
cess, my daughter, because you are the most 
powerful person in the world, and no one else 
is good enough.” 
“Ugh, ugh,” grumbled the Wall, “Iam not 
the strongest ; the big gray Rat who lives in 
the cellar is stronger than I. When he gnaws 
and gnaws at me I crumble and crumble, and 
at last I fall; go to the Rat, little brother.” 
And so, after going all over the world to 
find the strongest person, the Rat King had to

marry his daughter to a rat, after all ; but the 
princess was very glad of it, for she wanted 
to marry the gray Rat, all the time. 
THE FROG AND THE OX 
Once a little Frog sat by a big Frog, by the 
side of a pool. “ Oh, father,” said he, “I have 
just seen the biggest animal in the world; it 
was as big as a mountain, and it had horns on 
its head, and it had hoofs divided in two.” 
“ Pooh, child,” said the old Frog, “ that was 
only Farmer White’s Ox. He is not so very 
big. I could easily make myself as big as he.” 
And he blew, and he blew, and he blew, and 
swelled himself out. 
“Was he as big as that?” he asked the 
little Frog. 
“Oh, much bigger,” said the little Frog. 
The old Frog blew, and blew, and blew 
again, and swelled himself out, more than 
ever. : 
“Was he bigger than that ?” he said. 
“Much, much bigger,” said the little Frog. 
“T can make myself as big,” said the old 
Frog. ,And once more he blew, and blew, and 
blew, and swelled himself out, — and he burst!

THE FIRE-BRINGER? 
This is the Indian story of how fire was 
brought to the tribes. It was long, long ago, 
when men and beasts talked together with 
understanding, and the gray Coyote was friend 
and counselor of man. 
There was a Boy of the tribe who was swift 
of foot and keen of eye, and he and the Coyote 
ranged the wood together. They saw the men 
tatching fish in the creeks with their hands, 
and the women digging roots with sharp 
stones. This was in summer. But when winter 
came on, they saw the people running naked 
in the snow, or huddled in caves of the rocks, 
and most miserable. The Boy noticed this, 
and was very unhappy for the misery of his 
people. 
“T do not feel it,” said the Coyote. 
“ You have a coat of good fur,” said the 
Boy, “and my people have not.’ 
“ Come to the hunt,” said the Coyote. 
“T will hunt no more, till I have found a 
way to help my people against the cold,” said 
the Boy. “Help me, O Counselor!” ¢ 
Then the Coyote ran away, and came back

after a long time; he said he had found a 
way, but it was a hard way. 
“No way is too hard,” said the Boy. So 
the Coyote told him that they must go to the 
Burning Mountain and bring fire to the people. 
“ What is fire?” said the Boy. And the 
Coyote told him that fire was red like a flower, 
yet not a flower; swift to run in the grass 
and to destroy, like a beast, yet no beast; 
fierce and hurtful, yet a good servant to keep 
one warm, if kept among stones and fed with 
small sticks. 
“ We will get this fire,” said the Boy. 
First the Boy had to persuade the people 
to give him one hundred swift runners. Then 
he and they and the Coyote started at a good 
pace for the far-away Burning Mountain. At 
the end of the first day’s trail they left the 
weakest of the runners, to wait ; at the end of 
the second, the next stronger ; at the end of 
the third, the next ; and so for each of the hun- 
dred days of the journey ; and the Boy was the 
strongest runner, and went to the last trail with 
the Counselor. High mountains they crossed, 
and great plains, and giant woods, and at last 
they came to the Big Water, quaking along 
the sand at the foot of the Burning Mountain.
-P-A-G-E-194

It stood up in a high peaked cone, and 
smoke rolled out from it endlessly along the 
sky. At night, the Fire Spirits danced, and the 
glare reddened the Big Water far out. 
There the Counselor said to the Boy, “ Stay 
thou here till I bring thee a brand from the 
burning ; be ready and right for running, for 
I shall be far spent when I come again, and 
the Fire Spirits will pursue me.” 
Then he went up the mountain; and the 
Fire Spirits only laughed when they saw him, 
for he looked so slinking, inconsiderable, and 
mean, that none of them thought harm from 
him. And in the night, when they were at 
their dance about the mountain, the Coyote 
stole the fire, and ran with it down the slope 
of the burning mountain. When the Fire 
Spirits saw what he had done they streamed 
out after him, red and angry, with a humming 
sound like a swarm of bees. But the Coyote 
was still ahead; the sparks of the brand 
streamed out along his flanks, as he carried 
it in his mouth ; and he stretched his body to 
the trail. 
The Boy saw him coming, like a oe star 
against the mountain; he heard the singing 
sound of the Fire Spirits close behind, and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-195

laboring breath of the Counselor. And when 
the good beast panted down beside him, the 
Boy caught the brand from his jaws and was 
off, like an arrow from a bent bow. Out he 
shot on the homeward path, and the Fire Spirits 
snapped and sung behind him. But fast as they 
pursued he fled faster, till he saw the next run- 
ner standing in his place, his body bent for the 
running. To him he passed it, and it was off 
and away, with the Fire Spirits raging in chase. 
So it passed from hand to hand, and the 
Fire Spirits tore after it through the scrub, 
till they came to the mountains of the snows; 
these they could not pass. Then the dark, 
sleek runners with the backward streaming 
brand bore it forward, shining star-like in the 
night, glowing red in sultry noons, violet’ pale 
in twilight glooms, until they came in safety 
to their own land. 
And there they kept it among stones and 
fed it with small sticks, as the Counselor ad- 
vised ; and it kept the people warm. 
Ever after the Boy was called the Fire- 
Bringer ; and ever after the Coyote bore the 
sign of the bringing, for the fur along his 
flanks was singed and yellow from the flames 
that streamed backward from the brand.

A LEGEND OF CHRISTMAS EVE! 
One Christmas Eve, two strangers came to 
a village, and knocked at the door of a rich 
farmhouse, and asked if they might spend the 
night there. 
“ No, indeed,” said the people ; “ we ’ve no 
room for beggars!” and they sent them off. 
The two travelers went down the hill till 
they came to the cottage where the poor farm 
laborers lived ; and they knocked at that door, 
and asked if they might spend the night. 
The farm laborer and his wife had only one 
bed in the little house, but they invited the 
strangers in, and said they were most welcome 
to sleep there. 
There was no meat in the house, but the 
man went out and killed the one little goat 
they owned, and his wife roasted it, so that 
the strangers might have a good dinner on 
Christmas Eve. 
That night the strangers slept on the one 
good bed, and the laborers slept on straw on 
the floor in the outer room; but, curiously

  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 173 
enough, they had never slept so sweet a sleep 
in their lives. 
The next day was Christmas, and the farm 
laborer and his wife said the travelers must 
surely stay with them for the holiday, es- 
pecially as there was plenty of good meat in 
the house. So they stayed, and all went to 
church together; and they had a very happy 
day. 
When, at night, the strangers took their 
leave, they said to the man, “ How many horns 
had the little goat?” 
“Why, two!” said the man. 
“ Then for your kindness to us,” said the 
stranger, “you and your wife may have two 
wishes, one each.” 
The man and his wife looked at each other. 
Then they said that really they were very con- 
tented as they were. If they could have their 
daily bread and the hope of heaven when they 
died, they asked nothing more. 
The strangers said they should certainly 
keep these things, and they smiled at the farm 
laborer and his wife as they went away, and 
they promised that they would surely come to 
visit them again the next Christmas Eve. 
From that day on, everything the farm
-P-A-G-E-198

laborer and his wife touched, prospered. Theit 
hens had more chickens and laid better eggs 
than any in the country round. They had bet- 
ter milk and finer calves and fatter sheep than 
any one else. And it was not long before the 
poor farm laborers were no longer poor at all. 
They knew quite well to whom they owed 
all the good fortune. And they told people 
who asked, all about the kind strangers and 
the two wishes. The rich farmers heard the 
story too, of course, and they burned with 
jealousy of the farm laborers, for, rich as they 
were, they always wanted to be richer. At 
last, they went and asked the farm laborers to 
send the two strangers up to them, when they 
should come next Christmas Eve, instead of 
entertaining them at the cottage. The farm 
laborers were glad that the strangers should 
be so well entertained, and promised to do so. 
So when Christmas Eve came, and the travelers 
again knocked at the cottage door, the laborers 
' welcomed them gladly, but said they had 
promised the farmer to send them to his house 
for the night. The strangers said very well, 
they would go, and come back for the Christ- 
mas holiday. 
So again they went and knocked at the
-P-A-G-E-199
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 175 
farmer’s door. This time there was a grand 
welcome for them. Remembering about the 
little goat, the farmer had killed and roasted 
a fine ox, and he gave the strangers all sorts 
of good things to eat. And after supper he 
gave them the best bed in the house, and every- 
thing as fine as could be. 
The next morning, he urged the strangers 
to spend Christmas with them too, but they 
said they must go, for they were to meet 
their friends of last year, at church. 
“ Then, at least,” said the farmer, “I must 
drive you to church,” and he went and got 
his fine carriage and his best span of horses. | 
Just as they stood on the steps to take 
leave, one of the strangers asked the farmer, 
“Did you kill the ox for us?” 
“ Yes, yes indeed, we did!” said the farmer 
and his wife. i 
“ How many horns had the ox?” said the 
stranger. 
This was the question the farmers were 
waiting for. They looked at each other. 
“Say four,” whispered the farmer’s wife. 
“Well,” said the farmer, “it was a very 
remarkable ox, in fact, a peculiar ox; it had 
four horns.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  176 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
“ Ah?” said the stranger, “then you and 
your wife may have four wishes, two apiece: 
the next four wishes you make shall be granted 
you.” Then they drove away. 
The farmer drove them to church, and 
started back home. He was so eager to get 
back and talk over with his wife what they 
should wish, that he could n’t drive fast enough. 
He beat the horses, and pulled at the reins, 
and he was so excited that he drove over a 
big stone; and one of the traces broke. He 
mended it, somehow, and started again. Pretty 
soon one of the horses stumbled, and then the 
other trace broke. He mended that one, too, 
but by this time he was all out of temper. 
“Get up, get up!” he shouted to the horses. 
The horses shied as he struck them with the 
whip, and came near upsetting everything. 
“Oh,” shouted the farmer, “the wicked 
elves take you both! I wish’ — but he did n’t 
say anything more, for whisk !— the horses 
were gone, and nothing but the harness was 
left dangling from the pole. The farmer 
stared and rubbed his eyes, but there was no 
help for it; he had wished a wish. There was 
nothing to do but put the harness over his 
shoulders, leave the carriage, and trudge home.

In the mean time, his wife was waiting and 
watching for him, very eager to talk over what 
they should wish. He was gone so long that 
she lost all patience. 
“T wish he would hurry,” she said to her- 
self. Before the words were out of her mouth, 
the farmer shot through the air and landed 
before her, red and sweaty, with the harness 
on his shoulders. 
“ What in the world are you doing with 
that harness?” said his wife. 
“Why in the world did you make me 
hurry?” said the husband, and in no time 
they were quarreling. When the wife heard 
about the horses she called her husband the 
stupidest man in the world. 
“ Stupid, indeed !” said the farmer, who was 
now too angry to think at all. “It was all your 
fault; you started the trouble by making me 
tell a lie. Who was it that wanted me to say 
‘four horns’? ‘ Four horns,’ indeed!— I wish 
two of them were sticking on your head this 
minute.” 
“Oh!” screamed the farmer’s wife, and she 
put up her hands to her head. The farmer 
would have given anything to unsay his wish, 
but it was too late. The farmer’s wife felt two

little round nubs under her fingers. And they 
grew, and grew, faster than I can tell about 
it, until there were two little pointed horns 
sticking right up through her hair. 
The farmer began to coax and plead and 
beg, “Oh, dear little wife, sweet little wife, 
don’t mind the little horns! I’m sorry I 
wished it, but remember that we have only 
one wish left, and that is yours. Just wish 
for a million dollars now, and we shall be all 
right!” 
“Much good a million dollars would do 
me,” said the farmer’s wife, “with these things 
sticking out of my head!” 
“You could wear a head-dress,” said the 
farmer. But before he got the words out of 
his mouth, his wife had wished the horns off 
her head. 
And there they were, neither richer nor 
poorer than they were before; and the four 
wishes were gone. And so were the two fine 
horses. 
And they say that’s what you get by being

THE BURNING OF THE RICE FIELDS! 
Once there was a good old man who lived 
up on a mountain, far away in Japan. All 
round his little house the mountain was flat, 
and the ground was rich; and there were the 
rice fields of all the people who lived in the 
village at the mountain’s foot. Mornings and 
evenings, the old man and his little grandson, 
who lived with him, used to look far down on 
the people at work in the village, and watch 
the blue sea which lay all round the land, so 
close that there was no room for fields below, 
only for houses. The little boy loved the rice 
fields, dearly, for he knew that all the good 
food for all the people came from them; and he 
often helped his grandfather watch over them. 
One day, the grandfather was standing alone, 
before his house, looking far down at the peo- 
ple, and out at the sea, when, suddenly, he saw 
something very strange far off where the sea 
and sky meet. Something like a great cloud 
was rising there, as if the sea were lifting it- 
self high into the sky. The old man put his 
hands to his eyes and looked again, hard as his 
1 Adapted from “Gleanings in Buddha-Fields,” by Laf- 
cadio Hearn.

old sight could. Then he turned and ran to 
the house. “Yone, Yone!” he cried, “ bring 
a brand from the hearth!” 
The little grandson could not imagine what 
his grandfather wanted of fire, but he always 
obeyed, so he ran quickly and brought the 
brand. The old man already had one, and was 
running for the rice fields. Yone ran after. 
But what was his horror to see his grandfather 
thrust his burning brand into the ripe dry 
rice, where it stood. 
“Oh, Grandfather, Grandfather!” screamed 
the little boy, “what are you doing?” 
“ Quick, set fire! Thrust your brand in!” 
said the grandfather. 
Yone thought his dear grandfather had lost 
his mind, and he began to sob; but a little 
Japanese boy always obeys, so though he 
sobbed, he thrust his torch in, and the sharp 
flame ran up the dry stalks, red and yellow. 
In an instant, the field was ablaze, and thick 
black smoke began to pour up, on the moun- 
tain side. It rose like a cloud, black and fierce, 
and in no time the people below saw that 
their precious rice fields were on fire. Ah, 
how they ran! Men, women, and children 
climbed the mountain, running as fast as they 
 
-P-A-G-E-205

could to save the rice; not one soul stayed 
behind. 
And when they came to the mountain top, 
and saw the beautiful rice-crop all in flames, 
beyond help, they cried bitterly, “Who has 
done this thing ? How did it happen?” 
“T set fire,” said the old man, very solemnly; 
and the little grandson sobbed, “ Grandfather 
set fire.” 
But when they came fiercely round the old 
man, with “Why? Why?” he only turned 
and pointed to the sea. “ Look!” he said. 
They all turned and looked. And there, 
where the blue sea had lain, so calm, a mighty 
wall of water, reaching from earth to sky, was 
rolling in. No one could scream, so terrible 
was the sight. The wall of water rolled in on 
the land, passed quite over the place where the 
village had been, and broke, with an awful 
sound, on the mountain-side. One wave more, 
and still one more, came; and then all was 
water, as far as they could look, below; the 
village where they had been was under the sea. 
But the people were all safe. And when 
they saw what the old man had done, they 
honored him above all men for the quick wit 
which had saved them all from the tidal wave.

THE STORY OF WYLIE? 
This is a story about a dog, — not the kind 
of dog you often see in the street here; not 
a fat, wrinkly pugdog, nor a smooth-skinned 
bulldog, nor even a big shaggy fellow, but a 
slim, silky-haired, sharp-eared little dog, the 
prettiest thing you can imagine. Her name 
was Wylie, and she lived in Scotland, far up 
on the hills, and helped her master take care 
of his sheep. 
You can’t think how clever she was! She 
watched over the sheep and the little lambs 
like a soldier, and never let anything hurt 
them. She drove them out to pasture when 
it was time, and brought them safely home 
when it was time for that. When the silly 
sheep got frightened and ran this way and 
that, hurting themselves and getting lost, 
Wylie knew exactly what to do,—round on 
one side she would run, barking and scold- 
ing, driving them back; then round on the 
other, barking and scolding, driving them 
back, till they were all bunched together in 
front of the right gate. Then she drove them 
through as neatly as any person. She loved

her work, and was a wonderfully fine sheep 
dog. 
At last her master grew too old to stay alone 
on the hills, and so he went away to live. Be- 
fore he went, he gave Wylie to two kind young 
men who lived in the nearest town; he knew 
they would be good to her. They grew very 
fond of her, and so did their old grandmother 
and the little children ; she was so gentle and 
handsome and well-behaved. 
So now Wylie lived in the city where there 
were no sheep farms, only streets and houses, 
and she did not have to do any work at all, 
—she was just a pet dog. She seemed very 
happy and she was always good. 
But after a while, the family noticed some- 
thing odd, something very strange indeed, 
about their pet. Every single Tuesday night, 
about nine o’clock, Wylie disappeared. They 
would look for her, call her, —no, she was 
gone. And she would be gone all night. But 
every Wednesday morning, there she was at 
the door, waiting to be let in. Her silky coat 
was all sweaty and muddy and her feet heavy 
with weariness, but her bright eyes looked up 
at her masters as if she were trying to explain 
where she had been.
-P-A-G-E-208
  184 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Week after week the same thing happened. 
Nobody could imagine where Wylie went 
every Tuesday night. They tried to follow 
her to find out, but she always slipped away ; 
they tried to shut her in, but she always 
found a way out. It grew to be a real mys- 
tery. Where in the world did Wylie go ? 
You never could guess, so I am going to 
tell you. 
In the city near the town where the kind 
young men lived was a big market (like the 
one we have in Faneuil Hall). Every sort of 
thing was sold there, even live cows and sheep 
and hens. On Tuesday nights, the farmers used 
to come down from the hills with their sheep 
to sell, and drive them through the city streets 
into the pens, ready to sell on Wednesday 
morning; that was the day they sold them. 
The sheep weren’t used to the city noises 
and sights, and they always grew afraid and 
wild, and gave the farmers and the sheep-dogs a 
great deal of trouble. They broke away and 
ran about, in everybody’s way. 
But just as the trouble was worst, about 
sunrise, the farmers would see a little silky, 
sharp-eared dog come trotting all alone down 
the road, into the midst of them.

And then! 
In and out the little dog ran like the wind, 
round and about, always in the right place, 
driving — coaxing — pushing — making the 
sheep mind like a good school-teacher, and 
never frightening them, till they were all safely 
in! All the other dogs together could not do as 
much as the little strange dog. She was a per- 
fect wonder. And no one knew whose dog she 
was or where she came from. The farmers 
grew to watch for her, every week, and they 
called her “the wee fell yin ” which is Scotch 
for “ the little terror; ” they used to say when 
they saw her coming, “There’s the wee fell 
yin! Now we’ll get them in.” 
Every farmer would have liked to keep her, 
but she let no one catch her. As soon as her 
work was done she was off and away like a 
fairy dog, no one knew where. Week after 
week this happened, and nobody knew who 
the little strange dog was. 
But one day Wylie went to walk with her 
two masters, and they happened to meet some 
sheep-farmers. The sheep-farmers stopped 
short and stared at Wylie, and then they 
cried out, “Why, that’s the dog! That’s 
the wee fell ym!” And so it was. The little

strange dog who helped with the sheep was 
Wylie. 
Her masters, of course, did n’t know what 
the farmers meant, till they were told all about 
what I have been telling you. But when they 
heard about the pretty strange dog who came 
to market all alone, they knew at last where 
Wylie went, every Tuesday night. And they 
loved her better than ever. 
Was n’t it wise of the dear little dog to go 
and work for other people when her own work 
was taken away? I guess she knew that the 
best people and the best dogs always work 
hard at something. Any way she did that same 
thing as long as she lived, and she was always 
just as gentle. and silky-haired, and loving as 
at first. 
LITTLE DAYLIGHT? 
Once there was a beautiful palace, which 
had a great wood at one side. The king and his 
courtiers hunted in the wood near the palace, 
and there it was kept open, free from under- 
brush. But farther away it grew wilder and 
wilder, till at last it was so thick that nobody

knew what was there. It was a very great | 
wood indeed. 
In the wood lived eight fairies. Seven of 
them were good fairies, who had lived there 
always; the eighth was a bad fairy, who had 
just come. And the worst of it was that no- 
body but the other fairies knew she was a 
fairy; people thought she was just an ugly 
old witch. The good fairies lived in the dear- 
est little houses! One lived in a hollow silver 
birch, one in a little moss cottage, and so on. 
But the bad fairy lived in a horrid mud house 
in the middle of a dark swamp. 
Now when the first baby was born to the 
king and queen, her father and mother de- 
cided to name her “ Daylight,” because she 
was so bright and sweet. And of course they 
had a christening party. And of course they 
invited the fairies, because the good fairies had 
always been at the christening party when a 
princess was born in the palace, and everybody 
knew that they brought good gifts. 
But, alas, no one knew about the swamp 
fairy, and she was not invited, — which really 
pleased her, because it gave her an excuse for 
doing something mean. 
The good fairies came to the christening

party, and, one after another, five of them 
gave little Daylight good gifts. The other two 
stood among the guests, so that no one noticed 
them. The swamp fairy thought there were 
no more of them; so she stepped forward, 
just as the archbishop was handing the baby 
back to the lady-in-waiting. 
“Tam just a little deaf,” she said, mumbling 
a laugh with her toothless gums. “ Will your 
reverence tell me the baby’s name again?” 
“Certainly, my good woman,” said the 
bishop; “ the infant is little Daylight.” 
“ And little Daylight it shall be, forsooth,” 
cried the bad fairy. “I decree that she shall 
sleep all day.” Then she laughed a horrid 
shrieking laugh, “ He, he, hi, hi!” 
Every one looked at every one else in despair, 
but out stepped the sixth good fairy, who had 
been kept back to undo what she could of 
what the swamp fairy might decree. 
“Then at least she shall wake all night,” 
she said, sadly. 
“Ah!” screamed the swamp fairy, “you 
spoke before I had finished, which is against 
the law, and gives me another chance.” All 
the fairies started at once to say, “I beg your 
pardon!” But the bad fairy said, “I had
-P-A-G-E-213
a a 
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 189 
only laughed ‘he, he!’ and ‘hi, hi!’ I had 
still ‘ho, ho!’ and ‘hu, hu!’ to laugh.” 
The fairies could not say anything, and the 
bad fairy had her other chance. She said, — 
“Since she is to wake all night, I decree 
that she shail wax and wane with the moon! 
Ho, ho, hu, hu!” 
Out stepped the last good fairy. “ Until a 
prince shall kiss her without knowing who she 
is,” she said, quickly. 
The swamp fairy had been prepared for the 
trick of keeping back one good fairy, but she 
had not suspected two, and she could not say 
a word, for she had laughed “ho, ho!” and 
“hu, hu!” 
The poor king and queen looked sad enough. 
“We don’t know what you mean,” they said 
to the good fairy who had spoken last. But 
the good fairy only smiled. “The meaning 
of the thing will come with the thing,” she 
said. 
Tkat was the end of the party, but it was 
only the beginning of the trouble. Can vou 
imagine what a queer household it would be, 
where the baby laughed and crowed all night, 
and slept all day? Little Daylight was as 
merry and bright all night as any baby in the

world, but with the first sign of dawn she fell 
asleep, and slept like a little dormouse till dark. 
Nothing could waken her while day lasted. 
Still, the royal family did get used to this; but 
the rest of the bad fairy’s gift was a great deal 
worse, — that about waxing and waning with 
the moon. You know how the moon grows 
bigger and brighter each night, from the time 
it is a curly silver thread low in the sky till it 
is round and golden, flooding the whole sky 
with light? That is the waxing moon. Then, 
you know, it wanes; it grows smaller and 
paler again, night by night, till at last it dis- 
appears for awhile, altogether. Well, poor 
little Daylight waxed and waned with it. She 
was the rosiest, plumpest, merriest baby in the 
world when the moon was at the full; but as 
it began to wane her little cheeks grew paler, 
her tiny hands thinner, with every night, till 
she lay in her cradle like a shadow-baby, with- 
out sound or motion. At first they thought 
she was dead, when the moon disappeared, but 
after some months they got used to this too, 
and only waited eagerly for the new moon, to 
see her revive. When it shone again, faint and 
silver on the horizon, the baby stirred weakly, 
and then they fed her gently ; each night she
-P-A-G-E-215
  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 191 
grew a little better, and when the moon was 
near the full again, she was again a lively, 
rosy, lovely child. 
So it went on till she grew up. She grew 
to be the most beautiful maiden the moon ever 
shone on, and every one loved her so much, 
for her sweet ways and her merry heart, that 
some one was always planning to stay up at 
night, to be near her. But she did not like to 
be watched, especially when she felt the bad 
time of waning coming on; so her ladies-in- 
waiting had to be very careful. When the 
moon waned she became shrunken ana pale 
and bent, like an old, old woman, worn out 
with sorrow. Only her golden hair and her 
blue eyes remained unchanged, and this gave 
her a terribly strange look. At last, as the 
moon disappeared, she faded away to a little, 
bowed, old creature, asleep and helpless. 
No wonder she liked best to be alone! She 
got in the way of wandering by herself in the 
beautiful wood, playing in the moonlight when 
she was well, stealing away in the shadows 
when she was fading with the moon. Her 
father’ had a lovely little house of roses and 
vines built for her, there. It stood at the edge 
of a most beautiful open glade, inside the
-P-A-G-E-216
  192 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
wood, where the moon shone best. There the 
princess lived with her ladies. And there she 
danced when the moon was full. But when 
the moon waned, her ladies often lost her alto- 
gether, so far did she wander; and sometimes 
they found her sleeping under a great tree, 
and brought her home in their arms. 
When the princess was about seventeen 
years old, there was a rebellion in a kingdom 
not far from her father’s. Wicked nobles mur- 
dered the king of the country and stole his 
throne, and would have murdered the young 
prince, too, if he had not escaped, dressed in 
peasant’s clothes. 
Dressed in his poor rags, the prince wandered 
about a long time, till one day he got into a 
great wood, and lost his way. It was the wood 
where the Princess Daylight lived, but of 
course he did not know anything about that 
nor about her. He wandered till night, and 
then he came to a queer little house. One of 
the good fairies lived there, and the minute she 
saw him she knew all about everything; but 
to him she looked only like a kind old woman. 
She gave him a good supper and a bed for the 
night, and told him to come back to her if he 
found no better place for the next night. But
-P-A-G-E-217

the prince said he must get out of the wood at 
once; so in the morning he took leave of the 
fairy. 
All day long he walked, and walked; but 
at nightfall he had not found his way out of 
the wood, so he lay down to rest till the moon 
should rise and light his path. 
When he woke the moon was glorious; it 
was three days from the full, and bright as 
silver. By its light he saw what he thought 
to be the edge of the wood, and he hastened 
toward it. But when he came to it, it was only 
an open space, surrounded with trees. It was 
so very lovely, in the white moonlight, that the 
prince stood a minute to look. And as he 
looked, something white moved out of the trees 
on the far side of the open space. It was some- 
thing slim and white, that swayed in the dim 
light like a young birch. 
“Tt must be a moon fairy,” thought the 
prince ; and he stepped into the shadow. 
The moon fairy came nearer and nearer, 
dancittg and swaying in the moonlight. And 
as she came, she began to sing a soft, gay little 
song. * 
But when she was quite close, the prince saw 
that she was not a fairy after all, but a real

human maiden, — the loveliest maiden he had 
ever seen. Her hair was like yellow corn, and 
her smile made all the place merry. Her white 
gown fluttered as she danced, and her little 
song sounded like a bird note. 
The prince watched her till she danced out 
of sight, and then until she once more came 
toward him; and she seemed so like a moon- 
beam herself, as she lifted her face to the sky, 
that he was almost afraid to breathe. He had 
never seen anything so lovely. By the time 
she had danced twice round the circle, he could 
think of nothing in the world except the hope 
of finding out who she was, and staying near 
her. 
But while he was waiting for her to appear 
the third time, his weariness overcame him, and 
he fell asleep. And when he awoke, it was 
broad day, and the beautiful maiden had van- 
ished. 
He hunted about, hoping to find where she 
lived, and on the other side of the glade he 
came upon a lovely little house, coveret* with 
moss and climbing roses. He thought she 
must live there, so he went round ‘to the 
kitchen door and asked the kind cook for a 
drink of water, and while he was drinking it

_he asked who lived there. She told him it was 
the house of the Princess Daylight, but she 
told him nothing else about her, because she 
was not allowed to talk about her mistress. But 
she gave him a very good meal and told him 
other things. 
He did not go back to the little old woman 
who had been so kind to him first, but wan- 
dered all day in the wood, waiting for the moon- 
time. Again he waited at the edge of the dell, 
and when the white moon was high in the 
heavens, once more he saw the glimmering in 
the distance, and once more the lovely maiden 
floated toward him. He knew her name was 
the Princess Daylight, but this time she seemed 
to him much lovelier than before. She was all 
in blue like the blue of the sky in summer. 
(She really was more lovely, you know, because 
the moon was almost at the full.) All night he 
watched her, quite forgetting that he ought 
not to be doing it, till she disappeared on the 
opposite side of the glade. Then, very tired, 
he found. his way to the little old woman’s 
house, had breakfast with her, and fell fast 
asleep in the bed she gave him.

the evening and started off again she gave him 
a strange little flask and told him to use it 
if ever he needed it. 
This night the princess did not appear in 
the dell until midnight, at the very full of 
the moon. But when she came, she was so 
lovely that she took the prince’s breath away. 
Just think !— she was dressed in a gown that 
looked as if it were made of fire-flies’ wings, 
embroidered in gold. She danced around and 
around, singing, swaying, and flitting like a 
beam of sunlight, till the prince grew quite 
dazzled. 
But while he had been watching her, he had 
not noticed that the sky was growing dark 
and the wind was rising. Suddenly there was 
a clap of thunder. The princess danced on. 
But another clap came louder, and then a sud- 
den great flash of lightning that lit up the sky 
from end to end. The prince could r’t help 
shutting his eyes, but he opened them quickly 
to see if Daylight was hurt. Alas, she was ly- 
ing on the ground. The prince rau to her, but 
she was already up again. 
“Who are you?” she said.

away. The prince followed her, but she turned 
and put up her hand to tell him not to. And 
like the gentleman prince that he was, he 
obeyed her at once. 
Now all this time, the wicked swamp fairy 
had not known a word about what was going 
on. But now she found out, and she was furi- 
ous, for fear that little Daylight should be de- 
livered from her spell. So she cast her spells 
to keep the prince from finding Daylight again. 
Night after night the poor prince wandered 
and wandered, and never could find the little 
dell. And when it came daytime, of course 
there was no princess to be seen. Finally, at 
the time that the moon was almost gone, the

great distress. They were saying that the 
princess had wandered into the woods and was 
lost. The prince did n’t know, of course, what 
it meant, but he did understand that the prin- 
cess was lost somewhere, and he started off to 
find her. After he had gone a long way with- 
out finding her, he came to a big old tree, and 
there he thought he would light a fire to show 
her the way if she should happen to see it. 
As the blaze flared up, he suddenly saw a 
little black heap on the other side of the tree. 
Somebody was lying there. He ran to the 
spot, his heart beating with hope. But when 
he lifted the cloak which was huddled about 
the form, he saw at once that it was not Day- 
light. A pinched, withered, white, little old 
woman’s face shone out at him. The hood was 
drawn close down over her forehead, the eyes 
were closed, and as the prince lifted the cloak, 
the old woman’s lips moaned faintly. 
“Oh, poor mother,” said the prince, “ what 
is the matter?” The old woman only moaned 
again. The prince lifted her and carried her 
over to the warm fire, and rubbed her hands, 
trying to find out what was the matter. But 
she only moaned, and her face was so terribly 
strange and white that the prince’s tender

heart ached for her. Remembering his little 
flask, he poured some of its liquid between 
her lips, and then he thought the best thing 
he could do was to carry her to the princess’s 
house, where she could be taken care of. 
As he lifted the poor little form in his arms, 
two great tears stole out from the old woman’s 
closed eyes and ran down her wrinkled cheeks. 
“Oh, poor, poor mother,” said the prince 
pityingly; and he stooped and kissed her 
withered lips. 
As he walked through the forest with the 
old woman in his arms, it seemed to him that 
she grew heavier and heavier; he could hardly 
carry her at all; and then she stirred, and at 
last he was obliged to set her down, to rest. 
He meant to lay her on the ground. But the 
old woman stood up on her feet. 
And then her hood fell back from her face. 
As she looked up at the prince, the first, long, 
yellow ray of the rising sun struck full upon 
her, —and it was the Princess Daylight! Her 
hair was golden as the sun itself, and her eyes 
as blue as the flower that grows in the corn. 
The prince fell on his knees before her. 
But she gave him her hand and made him 
rise.

THE SAILOR MAN? 
Once upon a time, two children came to the 
house of a sailor man, who lived beside the 
salt sea ; and they found the sailor man sitting 
in his doorway knotting ropes. 
“ How do you do?” asked the sailor man. 
“We are very well, thank you,” said the 
children, who had learned manners, “and we ~~ 
hope you are the same. We heard that xox 
had a boat, and we thought that perhaps 
you would take us out in her, and teach us 
how to sail, for that is what we most wish to 
know.” 
“All in good time,” said the sailor man. 
“T am busy now, but by and by, when my 
work is done, I may perhaps take one of you 
if you are ready to learn. Meantime here are

some ropes that need knotting; you might be 
doing that, since it has to be done.” And he 
showed them how the knots should be tied, 
and went away and left them. 
When he was gone the first child ran to 
the window and looked out. 
“There is the sea,” he said. “The waves 
come up on the beach, almost to the door of 
the house. They run up all white, like pran- 
cing horses, and then they go dragging back. 
Come and look!” 
“T cannot,” said the second child. “I am 
tying a knot.” 
“Oh!” cried the first child, “I see the 
boat. She is dancing like a lady ata ball; I 
never saw such a beauty. Come and look!” 
“T cannot,” said the second child. “I am 
tying a knot.” 
“TJ shall have a delightful sail in that boat,” 
said the first child. “I expect that the sailor 
man will take me, because I am the eldest and 
I know more about it. There was no need of 
my watching when he showed you the knots, 
because I knew how already.” 
Just then the sailor man came in.

have you been doing in the meantime ?”

child. 
“Come, then,” said the sailor man, and he 
held out his hand to the second child. “I will 
take you out in the boat, and teach you to 
sail her.” 
“But I am the eldest,” cried the first child, 
“and I know a great deal more than she does.” 
“That may be,” said the sailor man; “ but 
a person must learn to tie a knot before he can 
learn to sail a boat.” 
“But I have learned to tie a knot,” cried 
the child. “TI know all about it!” 
“How can I tell that?” asked the sailor man. 
THE STORY OF JAIRUS’ DAUGHTER? 
Once, while Jesus was journeying about, he 
passed near a town where a man named Jairus 
lived. This man was a ruler in the synagogue,

of Jesus’ habit of healing and comforting all with whom he

and he had just one little daughter, about 
twelve years of age. At the time that Jesus 
was there the little daughter was very sick, 
and at last she lay a-dying. 
Her father heard that there was a wonder- 
ful man near the town, who was healing sick 
people whom no one else could help, and in 
his despair he ran out into the streets to search 
for him. He found Jesus walking in the midst 
of a crowd of people, and when he saw him 
he fell down at Jesus’ feet and besought him 
to come into his house, to heal his daughter. 
And Jesus said, yes, he would go with him. 
But there were so many people begging to be 
healed, and so many looking to see what hap- 
pened, that the crowd thronged them, and 
kept them from moving fast. And before they 
reached the house one of the man’s servants 
came to meet them, and said, “ Thy daughter 
is dead; trouble not the master to come far- 
ther.” 
But instantly Jesus turned to the father and 
said, “Fear not; only believe, and she shall - 
be made whole.” And he went on with Jairus, 
to the house. 
When they came to the house, they heard 
the sound of weeping and lamentation ; the

household was mourning for the little daughter, 
who was dead. Jesus sent all the strangers 
away from the door, and only three of his 
disciples and the father and mother of the 
child went in with him. And when he was 
within, he said to the mourning people, “ Weep 
not; she is not dead; she sleepeth.”” 
When he had passed, they laughed him to 
scorn, for they knew that she was dead. 
Then Jesus left them all, and went alone 
into the chamber where the little daughter lay. 
And when he was there, alone, he went up to 
the bed where she was, and bent over her, and 
took her by the hand. And he said, “ Maiden, 
arise.” 
And her spirit came unto her again! And 
she lived, and grew up in her father’s house.

ARTHUR AND THE SWORD? 
Once there was a great king in Britain

and princes disputed over the kingdom, each 
wanting it for himself. But King Uther had ¢ 
son, the rightful heir to the throne, of whom

no one knew, for he had been taken away 
secretly while he was still a baby, by a wise 
old man called Merlin, who had him brought 
up in the family of a certain Sir Ketor, for fear 
of the malice of wicked knights. Even the boy 
himself thought Sir Ector was his father, and 
he loved Sir Ector’s son, Sir Kay, like an own 
brother. The boy’s name was Arthur. 
When the kings and princes could not be 
kept in check any longer, Merlin had the 
archbishop of Canterbury send for them all to 
come to London. They came up to London at 
Christmas time, and in the great cathedral a 
solemn service was held, and prayer was made 
that some miracle be given, to show who was 
the rightful king. When the service was over, 
there appeared a strange stone in the church- 
yard, against the high altar. It was a great 
white stone, like marble, with something sunk 
in it that looked like a steel anvil; and in the 
anvil was driven a great glistening sword. The 
sword had letters of gold written on it, which 
read : “ Whoso pulleth out this sword of this 
stone and anvil is rightwise king born of all 
England.” 
All wondered at the strange sword and its 
strange writing ; and when the archbishop him-
-P-A-G-E-231
EE ee as ee ee eee NT eae 
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 207 
self came out and gave permission, many of 
the knights tried to pull the sword from the 
stone, hoping to be king. But no one could 
move it a hair’s breadth. 
“ He is not here,” said the archbishop, “ that 
shall achieve the sword; but doubt not, God 
will make him known.” 
Then they set a guard of ten knights to 
keep the stone, and the archbishop appointed 
a day when all should come together to try at 
the stone, — kings from far and near. In the 
mean time, splendid jousts were held, outside 
London, and both knights and commons were 
bidden. 
Sir Ector came up to the jousts, with others, 
and with him rode Kay and Arthur. Kay 
had been made a knight at Allhallowmas, and 
when he found there was to be so fine a joust ~ 
he wanted a sword, to join it. But he had 
left his sword behind, where his father and 
he had slept the night before. So he asked 
young Arthur to ride for it. 
“T will well,” said Arthur, and rode back 
for it. But when he came to the castle, the 
lady and all her household were at the joust- 
ing, and there was none to let him in. 
Arthur said to himself, “My brother Sir 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  208 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
Kay shall not be without a sword this day.” 
And he remembered the sword he had seen in 
the churchyard. “TI will ride to the church- 
yard,” he said, “and take that sword with me.” 
He rode into the churchyard, tied his horse to 
the stile, and went up to the stone. The guards 
were all away at the tourney, and the sword 
was there, alone. 
Young Arthur went up to the stone, took 
the great sword by the handles, and lightly 
and fiercely he drew it out of the anvil. 
Then he rode straight to Sir Kay with it, 
and gave it to him. 
Sir Kay knew instantly that it was the 
sword of the stone, and he rode off at once 
to his father and said, “Sir, lo, here is the 
sword of the stone; I must be king of the 
land.” But Sir Ector asked him where he got 
the sword. And when Sir Kay said, “ From 
my brother,” he asked Arthur how he got it. 
When Arthur told him, Sir Ector bowed his 
head before him. “Now I understand ye 
must be king of this land,” he said to Arthur. 
“ Wherefore 1?” said Arthur. 
“For God will have it so,” said Ector ; 
“never man should have drawn out this sword 
but he that shall be rightwise king of this

land. Now let me see whether ye can put the 
sword as it was in the stone, and pull it out 
again.” 
Straightway Arthur put the sword back. 
Then Sir Ector tried to pull it out, and 
after him Sir Kay; but neither could stir it. 
Then Arthur pulled it out. Thereupon, Sir 
Ector and Sir Kay kneeled upon the ground 
before him. 
“ Alas,” said Arthur, “mine own dear 
father and brother, why kneel ye to me ?” 
Sir Ector told him, then, all about his royal 
birth, and how he was stolen away by Merlin. 
But when Arthur found Sir Ector was not 
truly his father, he was so sad at heart that he 
cared not greatly to be king. And he begged 
his father and brother to love him still. Sir 
Ector asked that Sir Kay might be seneschal 
when Arthur was king. Arthur promised with 
all his heart. 
Then they went to the archbishop and told 
him that the sword had found its master. The 
archbishop appointed a day for the trial to be 
made in the sight of all men, and on that day 
the princes and knights came together, and 
each tried to draw out the sword, as before. 
But as before, none could so much as stir it.

Then came Arthur, and pulled it easily 
from its place. 
The knights and kings were terribly angry 
that a boy from nowhere in particular had 
beaten them, and they refused to acknowledge 
him king. They appointed another day, for 
another great trial. 
Three times they did this, and every time 
the same thing happened. 
At last, at the feast of Pentecost, Arthur 
again pulled out the sword before all the 
knights and the commons. And then the com- 
mons rose up and cried that he should be 
king, and that they would slay any one who 
denied him. 
So Arthur became king of Britain, and all 
gave him allegiance. 
TARPEIA 
There was once a girl named Tarpeia, whose 
father was guard of the outer gate of the cit- 
adel of Rome. It was a time of war, —the 
Sabines were besieging the city. Their camp 
was close outside the city wall. 
Tarpeia used to see the Sabine soldiers when 
she went to draw water from the public well, 
for that was outside the gate. And sometimes

she stayed about and let the strange men talk 
with her, because she liked to look at their 
bright silver ornaments. The Sabine soldiers 
wore heavy silver rings and bracelets on their 
left arms, —some wore as many as four or 
five. 
The soldiers knew she was the daughter of 
the keeper of the citadel, and they saw that 
she had greedy eyes for their ornaments. So 
day by day they talked with her, and showed 
her their silver rings, and tempted her. And 
at last Tarpeia made a bargain, to betray her 
city to them. She said she would unlock the 
great gate and let them in, if they would give 
her what they wore on their left arms. 
The night came. When it was perfectly 
dark and still, Tarpeia stole from her bed, took 
the great key from its place, and silently un- 
locked the gate which protected the city. Out- 
side, in the dark, stood the soldiers of the 
enemy, waiting. As she opened the gate, the 
long shadowy files pressed forward silently, 
and the Sabines entered the citadel. 
As the first man came inside, Tarpeia 
stretched forth her hand for her price. The 
soldier lifted high his left arm. “Take thy 
reward!” he said, and as he spoke he hurled
-P-A-G-E-236

upon her that which he wore upon it. Down 
upon her head crashed — not the silver rings 
of the soldier, but the great brass shield he 
carried in battle ! 
She sank beneath it, to the ground. 
“Take thy reward,” said the next; and his 
shield rang against the first. 
“Thy reward,” said the next—and the 
next—and the next—and the next; every 
man wore his shield on his left arm. 
So Tarpeia lay buried beneath the reward 
she had claimed, and the Sabines marched 
past her dead body, into the city she had be- 
trayed. 
THE BUCKWHEAT? 
Down by the river were fields of barley and 
rye and golden oats. Corn grew there, too, 
and the heaviest and richest ears bent lowest, 
in humility. Opposite the corn was a field of 
buckwheat, but the buckwheat never bent ; it 
held its head proud and stiff on the stem. 
The wise old willow-tree by the river looked 
down on the fields, and thought his thoughts. 
One day a dreadful storm came. The field- 
flowers folded their leaves together, and bowed

their heads. But the buckwheat stood straight 
and proud. 
“Bend your head, as we do,” called the 
field-flowers. 
“T have no need to,” said the buckwheat. 
“ Bend your head, as we do!” warned the 
golden corn-ears; “the angel of the storm is 
coming ; he will strike you down.” 
“J will not bend my head,” said the buck- 
wheat. 
Then the old willow-tree spoke: “ Close 
your flowers and bend your leaves. Do not 
look at the lightning when the cloud bursts. 
Even men cannot do that; the sight of heaven 
would strike them blind. How much more us, 
who are so inferioi to them! ” 
“¢ Inferior,’ indeed !”’ said the buckwheat. 
“Now I will look!” And he looked straight 
up, while the lightning flashed across the sky.. 
When the dreadful storm had passed, the 
flowers and the corn raised their drooping 
heads, clean and refreshed in the pure, sweet 
air. The willow-tree shook the gentle drops 
from its leaves. 
But the buckwheat lay like a weed in the 
field, scorched black by the lightning.

THE JUDGMENT OF MIDAS? 
The Greek God Pan, the god of all out-of 
doors, was a great musician. He played on 
a pipe of reeds. And the sound of his reed- 
pipe was so sweet that he grew proud, and be- 
lieved himself greater than the chief musician 
of the gods, Apollo, the sun-god. So he chal- 
lenged great Apollo to make better music 
than he. 
Apollo consented to the test, to punish Pan’s 
vanity, and they chose the mountain Tmolus 
for judge, since no one is so old and wise as 
the hills. 
When Pan and Apollo came before Tmolus, 
to play, their followers came with them, to hear. 
One of the followers of Pan was a mortal named 
Midas. 
First Pan played ; he blew on his reed-pipe, 
and out came a tune so wild and yet so coaxing 
that the birds hopped from the trees to get 
near; the squirrels came running from their 
holes; and the very trees swayed as if they 
wanted to dance. The fauns laughed aloud for 
joy as the melody tickled their furry little ears.

And Midas thought it the sweetest music in 
the world. 
Then Apollo rose. His hair shook drops of 
light from its curls; his robes were like the 
edge of the sunset cloud; in his hands he held 
a golden lyre. And when he touched the 
strings of the lyre, such music stole upon the 
air as never god nor mortal heard before. The 
wild creatures of the wood crouched still as 
stone; the trees held every leaf from rustling ; 
earth and air were silent as a dream. To hear 
such music cease was like bidding farewell to 
father and mother. 
When the charm was broken, all his hearers 
fell at Apollo’s feet and proclaimed the victory 
his. But Midas would not. He alone would 
not admit that the music was better than Pan’s. 
“Tf thine ears are so dull, mortal,” said 
Apollv, “they shall take the shape that suits 
them.” And he touched the ears of Midas. 
And stwaightway the dull ears grew long, 
pointed, and furry, and they turned this way 
and that. They were the ears of an ass! 
Fot a long time Midas managed to hide the 
tell-tale ears from every one; but at last a ser- 
vant discovered the secret. He knew he must 
not tell, yet he could not bear not to; so one

day he went into the meadow, scooped a little 
hollow in the turf, and whispered the secret 
into the earth. Then he covered it up again, 
and went away. But, alas, a bed of reeds 
sprang up from the spot, and whispered the 
secret to the grass. The grass told it to the 
tree-tops, the tree-tops to the little birds, and 
they cried it all abroad. 
And to this day, when the wind sets the 
reeds nodding together, they whisper, laugh- 
ing, “Midas has the ears of an ass! Oh, 
hush, hush !” 
WHY THE SEA IS SALT? 
Once there were two brothers. One was 
rich, and one was poor ; the rich one was rather 
stingy. When the Poor Brother used to come 
to ask him for things it annoyed him, and 
finally one day he said, “See here, 1’ll give 
it to you this time, but the next time you want 
anything, you can go Below for it!” 
Pretty soon the Poor Brother did want some-

thing, and he knew it wasn’t any use to go to 
his brother; he must go Below for it. So he 
went, and he went, and he went, till he came 
Below. 
It was the queerest place! There were red 
and yellow fires burning all around, and kettles 
of boiling oil hanging over them, and a queer 
sort of men standing round, poking the fires. 
There was a Chief Man ; he had a long curly 
tail that curled up behind, and two ugly little 
horns just over his ears ; and one foot was very 
queer indeed. And as soon as any one came 
in the door, these men would catch him up 
and put him over one of the fires, and turn 
him on a spit. And then the Chief Man, who 
was the worst of all, would come and say, 
“Eh, how do you feel now? How do you 
feel now ?” And of course the poor people 
screamed and screeched and said, “ Let us out ! 
Let us out!” That was just what the Chief 
Man wanted. 
When the Poor Brother came in, they picked 
him up at once, and put him over one of the © 
hottest fires, and began to turn him round and 
‘round like the rest; and of course the Chief 
Man came up to him and said, “ Eh, how do 
you feel now? How do you feel now?” But
-P-A-G-E-242
  218 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
the Poor Brother did not say, “Let me out! 
Let me out!” He said, “Pretty well, thank 
ou.” 
The Chief Man grunted and said to the 
other men, “ Make the fire hotter.” But the 
next time he asked the Poor Brother how he 
felt, the Poor Brother smiled and said, “ Much 
better now, thank you.” The Chief Man did 
not like this at all, because, of course, the whole 
object in getting people down Below was to 
make them uncomfortable. So he piled on 
more fuel and made the fire hotter still. But 
every time he asked the Poor Brother how he 
felt, the Poor Brother would say, “ Very much 
better ;”” and at last he said, “ Perfectly com- 
fortable, thank you ; could n’t be better.” 
You see when the Poor Brother was on 
earth he had never once had money enough 
to buy coal enough to keep him warm; so he 
liked the heat. 
At last the Chief Man could not stand it 
any longer. 
“Oh, look here,” he said, “you can go 
home.” 
“Oh, no, thank you,” said the Poor Brother, 
“TJ like it here.” 
“You must go home,” said the Chief Man.

“But I won’t go home,” said the Poor 
Brother. 
The Chief Man went away and talked with 
the other men; but no matter what they did 
they could not make the Poor Brother uncom- 
fortable; so at last the Chief Man came back 
and said, — 
“ What’ll you take to go home?” 
“What have you got?” said the Poor 
Brother. 
“ Well,” said the Chief Man, “if you’ll go 
home quietly I’ll give you the Little Mill that 
stands behind my door.” 
“ What’s the good of it?” said the Poor 
Brother. 
“Tt is the most wonderful mill in the 
world,” said the Chief Man. “ Anything at 
all that you want, you have only to name it, 
and say, ‘Grind this, Little Mill, and grind 
quickly,’ and the Miil will grind that thing 
until you say the magic word, to stop it.” 
“That sounds nice,” said the Poor Brother. 
“T’ll take it.” And he took the Little Mill 
under his arm, and went up, and up, and up, 
till he came to his own house. 
When he was in front of his little old hut, 
he put the Little Mill down on the ground  
-P-A-G-E-244
  220 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
and said to it, “Grind a fine house, Little 
Mill, and grind quickly.” And the Little Mill 
ground, and ground, and ground the finest 
house that ever was seen. It had fine big 
chimneys, and gable windows, and broad 
piazzas ; and just as the Little Mill ground the 
last step of the last flight of steps, the Poor 
Brother said the magic word, and it stopped. 
Then he took it round where the barn was, 
and said, “ Grind cattle, Little Mill, and grind 
quickly.” And the Little Mill ground, and 
ground, and ground, and out came great fat 
cows, and little woolly lambs, and fine little 
pigs ; and just as the Little Mill ground the 
last curl on the tail of the last little pig, the 
Poor Brother said the magic word, and it 
stopped. 
He did the same thing with crops for his 
cattle, pretty clothes for his daughters, and 
everything else they wanted. At last he had 
everything he wanted, and so he stood the 
Little Mill away behind his door. 
All this time the Rich Brother had been 
getting more and more jealous, and at last he 
came to ask the Poor Brother how he had 
grown so rich. The Poor Brother told him 
all about it. He said, “ It all comes from that

Little Mill behind my door. All I have to do 
when I want anything is to name it to the 
Little Mill, and say, ‘ Grind that, Little Mill, 
and grind quickly,’ and the Little Mill will 
grind that thing until” — 
But the Rich Brother did n’t wait to hear 
any more. “Will you lend me the Little 
Mill?”*he said. 
“Why, yes,’ said the Poor Brother, “TI will.” 
So the Rich Brother took the Little Mill 
under his arm and started across the fields to 
his house. When he got near home he saw the 
farm-hands coming in from the fields for their 
luncheon. Now, you remember, he was rather 
stingy. He thought to himself, “It is a waste 
of good time for them to come way into the 
house ; they shall have their porridge right 
there.” He called all the mer. to him, and 
made them bring their porridge-bowls. Then 
he set the Little Mill down on the ground, 
and said to it, “ Grind oatmeal porridge, Little 
Mill, and grind quickly!” The Little Mill 
ground, and ground, and ground, and out 
came delicious oatmeal porridge. Each man 
held his bowl under the spout. When the last 
bowl was filled, the porridge ran over on the 
ground.

“ That ’s enough, Little Mill,” said the Rich 
Brother. “You may stop, and stop quickly.” 
But this.was not the magic word, and the 
Little Mill did not stop. It ground, and ground, 
and ground, and the porridge ran all round and 
made alittle pool. The Rich Brother said, “No, 
no, Little Mill, I said, ‘ Stop grinding, and stop 
quickly.’” But the Little Mill grouna, and 
ground, faster than ever ; and pretty soon there 
was a regular pond of porridge, almost up to 
their knees. The Rich Brother said, “Stop 
grinding,” in every kind of way; he called the 
Little Mill names; but nothing did any good. 
The Little Mill ground porridge just the same. 
At last the men said, “ Go and get your bro< 
ther to stop the Little Mill, or we shall be 
drowned in porridge.” 
So the Rich Brother started for his brother’s 
house. He had to swim before he got there, 
and the porridge went up his sleeves, and down 
his neck, and it was horrid and sticky. His 
brother laughed when he heard the story, but 
he came with him, and they took a boat and 
rowed across the lake of porridge to where the 
Little Mill was grinding. And then the Poor 
Brother whispered the magic word, and the 
Little Mill stopped.

But the porridge was a long time soaking 
into the ground, and nothing would ever grow 
there afterwards except oatmeal. 
The Rich Brother did n’t seem to care much 
about the Little Mill after this, so the Poor 
Brother took it home again and put it behind 
the door ; and there it stayed a long, long while. 
Years afterwards a Sea Captain came there 
to visit. He told such big stories that the Poor 
Brother said, “Oh, I daresay you have seen 
wonderful things, but I don’t believe you ever 
saw anything more wonderful than the Little 
Mill that stands behind my door.” 
“What is wonderful about that?” said the 
Sea Captain. 
“Why,” said the Poor Brother, “anything 
in the world you want,— you have only to 
name it to the Little Mill and say, ‘ Grind 
that, Little Mill, and grind quickly,’ and it will 
grind that thing until” — 
The Sea Captain did n’t wait to hear another 
word. “ Will you lend me that Little Mill?” 
he said eagerly. 
The Poor Brother smiled a little, but he said 
“ Yes,” and the Sea Captain took the Little Mill 
under his arm, and went on board his ship and 
sailed away.

They had head-winds and storms, and they 
were so long at sea that some of the food gave 
out. Worst of all, the salt gave out. It was 
dreadful, being without salt. But the Captain 
happened to remember the Little Mill. 
“Bring up the salt box!” he said to the 
cook. “ We will have salt enough.” 
He set the Little Mill on deck, put the salt 
box under the spout, and said, — 
“Grind salt, Little Mill,and grind quickly !” 
And the Little Mill ground beautiful, white, 
powdery salt. When they had enough, the 
Captain said, “ Now you may stop, Little Mill, 
and stop quickly.” The Little Mill kept right 
on grinding ; and the salt began to pile up in 
little heaps on the deck. “TI said, ‘Stop,’ ” said 
the Captain. But the Little Mill ground, and 
ground, faster than ever, and the salt was soon 
thick on the deck like snow. The Captain called 
the Little Mill names and told it to stop, in 
every language he knew, but the Little Mill 
ground salt just the same. It covered all the 
decks and poured down into the hold, and at 
last the ship began to settle in the water ; salt 
is very heavy. But just before the ship sank 
to the water-line, the Captain had a bright 
thought: he threw the Little Mill overboard!

BILLY BEG AND HIS BULL? 
Once upon a time, there was a king and a 
queen, and they had one son, whose name was 
Billy. And Billy had a bull he was very fond 
of, and the bull was just as fond of him. And 
when the queen came to die, she put it as her 
last request on the king, that come what might, 
come what may, he’d not part Billy and the 
bull. And the king promised that, come what 
might, come what may, he would not. Then 
the good queen died, and was buried. 
After a time, the king married again, and 
the new queen could not abide Billy ; no more 
could she stand the bull, seeing him and Billy 
so thick. So she asked the king to have the 
bull killed. But the king said he had pro- 
mised, come what might, come what may, he’d 
not part Billy Beg and his bull, so he could not.

Then the queen sent for the Hen-Wife, and 
asked what she should do. “ What will you

soon part them?” 
“ Anything at all,” said the queen. 
“Then do you take to your bed, very sick

I'll do the rest.” 
So the queen took to her bed, very sick 
with a complaint, and the king came to see 
what could be done for her. “I shall never 
be better of this,” she said, “till I have the 
medicine the Hen-Wife ordered.”

“A mouthful of the blood of Billy Beg’s bull.”

Then the queen got sicker and sicker, and 
each time the king asked what would cure her 
she said, “A mouthful of the blood of Billy 
Beg’s bull.” And at last it looked as if she 
were going to die. So the king finally set a 
day for the bull to be killed. At that the

When Billy Beg heard all this, he was very 
sorrowful, and the bull noticed his looks. 
“What are you doitherin’ about?” said the 
bull to him. So Billy told him. “ Don’t fret 
yourself about me,” said the bull, “it’s not I 
that’ll be killed!” 
The day came, when Billy Beg’s bull was to 
be killed; all the people were there, and the 
queen, and Billy. And the bull was led out, 
to be seen. When he was led past Billy he 
bent his head. “Jump on my back, Billy, my 
boy,” says he, “ till I see what kind of a horse- 
man youare!” Billy jumped on his back, and 
with that the bull leaped nine miles high and 
nine miles broad and came down with Billy 
sticking between his horns. Then away he 
rushed, over the head of the queen, killing her 
dead, where you would n’t know day by night 
or night by day, over high hills, low hills, 
sheep walks and bullock traces, the Cove o’ 
Cork, and old Tom Fox with his bugle horn. 
When at last he stopped he said, “Now,

ear and pull out the napkin you’ll find there, 
and when you’ve spread it, it will be covered

So Billy put his hand in the bull’s left 
ear, and drew out the napkin, and spread it; 
and, sure enough, it was spread with all kinds 
of eating and drinking, fit for a king. And 
Billy Beg ate well. 
But just as he finished he heard a great 
roar, and out of the forest came a mighty bull, 
snorting and running. 
And the two bulls at it and fought. They 
knocked the hard ground into soft, the soft

spring wells into rocks. It was a terrible fight. 
But in the end, Billy Beg’s bull was too able 
for the other bull, and he killed him, and 
drank his blood.

the bull off and away, where you would n’t

pulled out the napkin and spread it, and it 
was covered with all kinds of eating and drink-

And, sure enough, just as Billy finished 
eating, there was a frightful roar, and a mighty 
great bull, greater than the first, rushed out of 
the forest. And the two bulls at it and fought. 
It was a terrible fight! They knocked the 
hard ground into soft, the soft into hard, the 
rocks into spring wells, and the spring wells 
into rocks. But in the end, Billy Beg’s bull 
killed the other bull, and drank his blood. 
Then he off and away, with Billy. 
But when he came down, he told Billy Beg 
that he was to fight another bull, the brother 
of the other two, and that this time the other 
bull would be too able for him, and would 
kill him and drink his blood. 
“ When I am dead, Billy, my boy,” he said, 
“put your hand in my left ear and draw out 
the napkin, and youll never want for eating 
or drinking ; and put your hand in my right 
ear, and youll find a stick there, that will

when you buckle it on, there’s nothing can

Billy Beg was very sad to hear this. And 
very soon he heard a more dreadful roar than 
before, and a tremendous bull rushed out of 
the forest. Then came the worst fight of all. 
In the end, the other bull was too able for 
Billy Beg’s bull, and he killed him and drank 
his blood. 
Billy Beg sat down and cried for three days 
and three nights. After that he was hungry ; 
so he put his hand in the bull’s left ear, and 
drew out the napkin, and ate all kinds of eat- 
ing and drinking. Then he put his hand in 
the right ear and pulled out the stick which 
was to turn into a sword if waved round his 
head three times, and to give him the strength 
of a thousand men beside his own. And he 
cut a strip of the hide for a belt, and started 
off on his adventures. ; 
Pretty soon he came to a fine place; an old 
gentleman lived there. So Billy went up and 
knocked, and the old gentleman came to the 
door. 
“ Are you wanting a boy?” says Billy. 
“T am wanting a herd-boy,” says the gen-

donkeys, and six goats to pasture every morn-

“ What is the wage,” says Billy. 
“Oh, well,” says the gentleman, “it’s no 
use to talk of that now; there’s three giants 
live in the wood by the pasture, and every day 
they drink up all the milk and kill the boy that 
looks after the cattle; so we’ll wait to talk 
about wage till we see if you come back alive.” 
“All right,” says Billy, and he entered ser- 
vice with the old gentleman. 
The first day, he drove the six cows, six 
horses, six donkeys, and six goats to pasture, 
and sat down by them. About noon he heard 
a kind of roaring from the wood; and out 
rushed a giant with two heads, spitting fire 
out of his two mouths. 
“Oh! my fine fellow,” says he to Billy, 
“you are too big for one swallow and not big 
enough for two; how would you like to die, 
then? By a cut with the sword, a blow with 
the fist, or a swing by the back?” 
“That is as may be,” says Billy, “ but I’ll 
fight you.” And he buckled on his hide belt, 
and swung his stick three times round his 
head, to give him the strength of a thousand

men besides his own, and went for the giant. 
And at the first clinch Billy Beg lifted the 
giant up and sunk him in the ground, up to 
his arm-pits. 
“Oh, mercy! mercy! Spare my life !” cried 
the giant. 
“T think not,” said Billy; and he cut off 
his heads. 
That night, when the cows and the goats 
were driven home, they gave so much milk 
that all the dishes in the house were filled, and 
the milk ran over and made a little brook in 
the yard. 
“This is very queer,” said the old gentle- 
man; “they never gave any milk before. Did 
you see nothing in the pasture? ” 
“ Nothing worse than myself,” said Billy. 
And next morning he drove the six cows, six 
horses, six donkeys, and six goats to pasture 
again. 
Just before noon he heard a terrific roar; 
and out of the wood came a giant with six 
heads. 
“You killed my brother,” he roared, fire 
coming out of his six mouths, “and Ill very 
soon have your blood! Will you die by a cut 
of the sword, or a swing by the back?”
-P-A-G-E-257
  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 233 
“T’ll fight you,” said Billy. And buckling 
on his belt and swinging his stick three times 
round his head, he ran in and grappled the 
giant. At the first hold, he sunk the giant up 
to the shoulders in the ground. 
“ Mercy, mercy, kind gentleman!” cried the 
giant. “Spare my life!” 
“T think not,” said Billy, and cut off his 
heads. 
That night the cattle gave so much milk 
that it ran out of the house and made a stream, 
and turned a mill wheel which had not been 
turned for seven years ! 
“Tt’s certainly very queer,” said the old 
gentleman ; “did you see nothing in the pas- 
ture, Billy ?” 
“ Nothing worse than myself,” said Billy. 
And the next morning the gentleman said, 
“ Billy, do you know, I only heard one of the 
giants roaring in the night, and the night be- 
fore only two? What can ail them, at all?” 
“Oh, maybe they are sick or something,” 
says Billy; and with that he drove the six 
cows, six horses, six donkeys, and six goats to 
pasture. 
At about ten o’clock there was a roar like a 
dozen bulls, and the brother of the two giants  
-P-A-G-E-258
  234 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
came out of the wood, with twelve heads on 
him, and fire spouting from every one of them. 
“Tl have you, my fine boy,” cries he; “how 
will you die, then?” 
“ We’ll see,” says Billy ; “come on!” 
And swinging his stick round his head, he 
made for the giant, and drove him up to his 
twelve necks in the ground. All twelve of the 
heads began begging for mercy, but Billy soon 
cut themshort. Thenhe drove the beasts home. 
And that night the milk overflowed the mill 
stream and made a lake, nine miles long, nine 
miles broad, and nine miles deep; and there 
is salmon and whitefish there to this day. 
“You are a fine boy,” said the gentleman, 
“and I’ll give you wage.” 
So Billy was herd. 
The next day, his master told him to look 
' after the house while he went up to the king’s 
town, to see a great sight. “What will it 
be?” said Billy. “The king’s daughter is to 
be eaten by a fiery dragon,” said his master, 
“unless the champion fighter they ’ve been 
feeding for six weeks on purpose kills the 
dragon.” “Oh,” said Billy. 
After he was left alone, there were people 
passing on horses and afoot, in coaches and
-P-A-G-E-259
STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 235 
chaises, in carriages and in wheelbarrows, all 
going to see the great sight. And all asked 
Billy why he was not on his way. But Billy 
said he did n’t care about going. 
When the last passer-by was out of sight, 
Billy ran and dressed himself in his master’s 
best suit of clothes, took the brown mare from 
the stable, and was off to the king’s town. 
When he came there, he saw a big round 
place with great high seats built up around it, 
and all the people sitting there. Down in the 
midst was the champion, walking up and down 
proudly, with two men behind him to carry 
his heavy sword. And up in the centre of the 
seats was the princess, with her maidens ; she 
was looking very pretty, but nervous-like. 
The fight was about to begin when Billy got 
there, and the herald was crying out how the 
champion would fight the dragon for the prin- 
cess’ sake, when suddenly there was heard a 
fearsome great roaring, and the people shouted, 
“ Here he is now, the dragon!” 
The dragon had more heads than the biggest 
of the giants, and fire and smoke came from 
every one of them. And when the champion 
saw the creature, he never waited even to take 
his sword, — he turned and ran; and he never
-P-A-G-E-260

236 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
stopped till he came to a deep well, where he 
jumped in and hid himself, up to the neck. 
When the princess saw that her champion 
was gone, she began wringing her hands, and 
crying, “ Oh, please, kind gentlemen, fight the 
dragon, some of you, and keep me from being 
eaten! Will no one fight the dragon for me?” 
But no one stepped up, at all. And the dragon 
made to eat the princess. 
Just then, out stepped Billy from the crowd, 
with his fine suit of clothes and his hide belt 
on him. “Ill fight the beast,” he says, and 
swinging his stick three times round his head, 
to give him the strength of a thousand men 
besides his own, he walked up to the dragon, 
easy. The princess and all the people were 
looking, you may be sure, and the dragon 
raged at Billy with all his mouths, and they 
at it and fought. It was a terrible fight, but 
in the end Billy Beg had the dragon down, 
and he cut off his heads with the sword. 
There was great shouting, then, and erying 
that the strange champion must come to the 
king to be made prince, and to the princess, 
to be seen. But in the midst of the hullabaloo 
Billy Beg slips on the brown mare and is off 
and away before any one has seen his face. But,
-P-A-G-E-261
  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 287 
quick as he was, he was not so quick but that 
the princess caught hold of him as he jumped 
on his horse, and he got away with one shoe 
left in her hand. And home he rode, to his 
master’s house, and had his old clothes on and 
the mare in the stable before his master came 
back. 
When his master came back, he had a great 
tale for Billy, how the princess’s champion 
had run from the dragon, and a strange knight 
had come out of the clouds and killed the 
dragon, and before any one could stop him had 
disappeared in the sky. “ Wasn’t it wonder- 
ful?” said the old gentleman to Billy. “I 
should say so,” said Billy to him. 
Soon there was proclamation made that the 
man who killed the dragon was to be found, 
and to be made son of the king and husband 
of the princess ; for that, every one should 
come up to the king’s town and try on the 
shoe which the princess had pulled off the 
strange champion, and that man it fitted 
should be known to be the man. On the day 
set, there was passing of coaches and chaises, 
of carriages and wheelbarrows, people on horse- 
back and afoot, and Billy’s master was the 
first to go.
-P-A-G-E-262

While Billy was watching, at last came along 
a raggedy man. 
“ Will you change clothes with me, and I’ll 
give you boot?” said Billy to him. 
“Shame to you to mock a poor raggedy 
man!” said the raggedy man to Billy. 
“It’s no mock,” said Billy, and he changed 
clothes with the raggedy man, and gave him 
boot. 
When Billy came to the king’s town, in his 
dreadful old clothes, no one knew him for the 
champion at all, and none would let him come 
forward to try the shoe. But after all had tried, 
Billy spoke up that he wanted to try. They. 
laughed at him, and pushed him back, with 
his rags. But the princess would have it that 
he should try. “ - like his face,” said she; 
“Jet him try, now.’ 
So up stepped Billy, and put on the shoe, 
and it fitted him like his own skin. 
Then Billy confessed that it was he that 
killed the dragon. And that he was a king’s 
son. And they put a velvet suit on him, and 
hung a gold chain round his neck, and every 
one said a finer looking boy they ’d never seen. 
So Billy married the princess, and was the 
prince of that place.

THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM?! 
A long way off, across the ocean, there is a 
little country where the ground is lower than 
the level of the sea, instead of higher, as it is 
here. Of course the water would run in and 
cover the land and houses, if something were 
not done to keep it out. But something is 
done. The people build great, thick walls all 
round the country, and the walls keep the sea 
out. You see how much depends on those 
walls, — the good crops, the houses, and even 
the safety of the people. Even the small chil- 
dren in that country know that an accident to 
one of the walls is a terrible thing. These 
walls are really great banks, as wide as roads, 
and they are called “ dikes.” 
Once there was a little boy who lived in 
that country, whose name was Hans. One 
day, he took his little brother out along by 
the dike to play. They went a long way out 
of the town, and came to where there were no 
houses, but ever so many flowers and green 
fields.y By and by, Hans climbed up on the 
dike, and sat down; the little brother was 
playing about at the foot of the bank.

Suddenly the little brother called out, “Oh, 
what a funny little hole! It bubbles!” 
“Hole? Where?” said Hans. 
“ Here in the bank,” said the little brother; 
‘‘ water ’s in jit.” 
“ What!’’ said Hans, and he slid down as 
fast as he could to where his brother was playing. 
There was the tiniest little hole in the bank. 
Just an air-hole. A drop of water bubbled 
slowly through. 
“Tt is a hole in the dike!” cried Hans; 
“ What shall we do?” 
He looked all round; not a person or a 
house in sight. He looked at the hole; the 
little drops oozed steadily through; he knew 
that the water would soon break a great gap, 
because that tiny hole gave it a chance. The 
town was so far away — if they ran for help 
it would be too late; what should he do? 
Once more he looked; the hole was larger, 
now, and the water was trickling. 
Suddenly a thought came to Hans. He stuck 
his little forefinger right into the hole, where 
it fitted tight ; and he said to his little byother, 
“Run, Dieting! Go to the town and tell the 
men there’s a hole in the dike. Tell them I 
will keep it stopped till they get here.”

The little brother knew by Hans’s face that 
semething very serious was the matter, and he 
started for the town, as fast as his legs could 
run. Hans, kneeling with his finger in the 
hole, watched him grow smaller and smaller 
as he got farther away. 
Pretty soon he was as small as a chicken ; 
then he was only a speck ; then he was out of 
sight. Hans was all alone, squatted on the 
ground, with his finger tight in the bank. 
He could hear the water, slap, slap, slap, on 
the stones; and deep down under the’slapping 
was a gurgling, rumbling sound. It seemed 
very near. 
By and by, his hand began to feel numb. 
He rubbed it with the other hand ; but it got 
colder and more numb, colder and more numb, 
every minute. He looked to see if the men 
were coming ; the road was bare as far as he 
could see. Then the cold began creeping, 
creeping, up his arm; first his wrist, then his 
arm to the elbow, then his arm to the shoulder; 
how cold it was! And soon it began to ache. 
Ugly little cramp-pains streamed up his finger, 
ap his palm, up his arm, till it ached way into 
his shoulder, and down the back of his neck. 
It seemed hours since the little brother went
-P-A-G-E-266
  242 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
away. He felt very lonely, and the hurt in his 
arm grew and grew. He watched the road 
with all his eyes, but no one came in sight. 
Then he leaned his head against the dike, to 
rest his shoulder. 
As his ear touched the dike, he heard the 
voice of the great sea, murmuring. The sound 
seemed to say, — 
“Tam the great sea. No one can stand 
against me. What are you, a little child, that 
you try to keep me out? Beware! Beware!” 
Hans’s heart beat in heavy knocks. Would 
they never come? He was frightened. 
And the water went on beating at the wall, 
and murmuring, “I will come through, I will 
come through, I will get you, I will get you, 
run — run— before I come through ! ” 
Hans started to pull out his finger; he was so 
frightened that he felt as if he must run forever. 
But that minute he remembered how much de- 
pended on him; if he pulled out his finger, the 
water would surely make the hole bigger, and 
at last break down the dike, and the sea would 
come in on all the land and houses. He set his 
teeth, and stuck his finger tighter than ever. 
“You shall not come thrbagh't 1” hé’ this- 
pered, “I will not run!”

Just as he thought it, he heard a far-off 
shout. Far in the distance he saw a black 
something on the road, and dust. The men 
were coming! At last, they were coming. 
They came nearer, fast, and he could make out 
his own father and the neighbors. They had 
pickaxes and shovels, and they were running. 
And as they ran they shouted, “ We’re com- 
ing; take heart, we’re coming!” 
The next minute, it seemed, they were there. 
And when they saw Hans, with his pale face, 
and his hand tight in the dike, they gave a 
great cheer, — just as people do for soldiers 
back from war; and they lifted him up and 
rubbed his aching arm with tender hands, and 
they told him that he was a real hero, and that 
he had saved the town. 
When the men had mended the dike, they 
marched home, like an army, and Hans was 
carried high on their shoulders, because he was 
ahero. And to this day the people of Haarlem 
tell the story of how a little boy saved the dike. 
THE LAST LESSON? 
Little Franz didn’t want to go to school, 
that morning. He would much rather have 
1 Adapted from the French of Alphonse Daudet
-P-A-G-E-268
  244 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
played truant. The air was so warm and still, 
—you could hear the blackbird singing at the 
edge of the wood, and the sound of the Prus- 
sians drilling, down in the meadow behind the 
old sawmill. He would so much rather have 
played truant! Besides, this was the day for 
the lesson in the rule of participles; and the 
rule of participles in French is very, very long, 
and very hard, and it has more exceptions than 
tule. Little Franz did not know it at all. He 
did not want to go to school. 
But, somehow, he went. His legs carried 
him reluctantly into the village and along the 
street. As he passed the official bulletin-board 
before the town hall, he noticed a little crowd 
round it, looking at it. That was the place 
where the news of lost battles, the requisition 
for more troops, the demands for new taxes 
were posted. Small as he was, little Franz had 
seen enough to make him think, “ What now, 
I wonder?” But he could not stop to see; he 
was afraid of being late. 
When he came to the school yard his heart 
beat very fast ; he was afraid he was late, after 
all, for the windows were all open, and yet he 
heard no noise, — the schoolroom was petfectly 
quiet. He had been counting on the noise and
-P-A-G-E-269
  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 245 
confusion before school, — the slamming of 
desk covers, the banging of books, the tapping 
of the master’s cane and his “ A little less noise, 
please,” — to let him slip quietly into his seat 
unnoticed. But no; he had to open the door 
and walk up the long aisle, in the midst of a 
silent room, with the master looking straight 
at him. Oh, how hot his cheeks felt, and how 
hard his heart beat! But to his great surprise 
the master did n’t scold at all. All he said was, 
“ Come quickly to your place, my little Franz; 
we were just going to begin without you!” 
Little Franz could hardly believe his ears; 
that wasn’t at all the way the master was 
accustomed to speak. It was very strange! 
Somehow— everything was very strange. The 
room looked queer. Everybody was sitting so 
still, so straight — as if it were an exhibition 
day, or something very particular. And the 
master — he looked strange, too; why, he had 
on his fine lace jabot and his best coat, that he 
wore only on holidays, and his gold snuff-box 
in his hand. Certainly it was very odd. Lit- 
tle Franz looked all round, wondering. And 
there in the back of the room was the oddest 
thing of all. There, on a bench, sat visitors. 
Visitors! He could not make it out; people
-P-A-G-E-270
246 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
never came except on great occasions, — ex- 
amination days and such. And it was not a 
holiday. Yet there were the agent, the old 
blacksmith, the farmer, sitting quiet and still. 
It was very, very strange. 
Just then the master stood up and opened 
school. He said, “My children, this is the 
last time I shall ever teach you. The order 
has come from Berlin that henceforth nothing 
but German shall be taught in the schools of 
Alsace and Lorraine. This is your last lesson 
in French. I beg you, be very attentive.” 
His last lesson in French! Little Franz 
could not believe his ears; his last lesson — 
ah, that was what was on the bulletin board ! 
It flashed across him in an instant. That was 
it! His last lesson in French —and he scarcely 
knew how to read and write — why, then, he 
should never know how! He looked down at 
his books, all battered and torn at the corners ; 
and suddenly his books seemed quite different 
to him, they seemed—somehow—like friends. 
He looked at the master, and he seemed dif- 
ferent, too, — like a very good friend. Little 
Franz began to feel cng himself. Just as 
he was thinking about it, he heard his name 
called, and he stood up to recite.

it was the rule of participles. 
Oh, what would n’t he have given to be 
able to say it off from beginning to end, ex- 
ceptions and all, without a blunder! But he 
could only stand and hang his head; he did 
not know a word of it. Then through the hot 
pounding in his ears he heard the master’s 
voice; it was quite gentle; not at all the 
scolding voice he expected. And it said, “I’m 
not going to punish you, little Franz. Per- 
haps you are punished enough. And you are 
not alone in your fault. We all do the same 
thing, — we ail put off our tasks till to-mor- 
row. And — sometimes — to-morrow never 
comes. That is what it has been with us. We 
Alsatians have been always putting off our 
education till the morrow; and now they have 
a right, those people down there, to say to us, 
‘What! You call yourselves French, and can- 
not even read and write the French language? 
Learn German, then !’” 
And then the master spoke to them of the 
French language. He told them how beauti- 
ful it was, how clear and musical and reason- 
able, and he said that no people could be 
hopelessly conquered so long as it kept its 
language, for the language was the key to its

prison-house. And then he said he was going 
to tell them a little about that beautiful lan- 
guage, and he explained the rule of participles. 
And do you know, it was just as simple as 
ABC! Little Franz understood every word. 
It was just the same with the rest of the 
grammar lesson. I don’t know whether little 
Franz listened harder, or whether the master 
explained better; but it was all quite clear, 
and simple. 
But as they went on with it, and little 
Franz listened and looked, it seemed to him 
that the master was trying to put the whole 
French language into their heads in that one 
hour. It seemed as if he wanted to teach 
them all he knew, before he went, — to give 
them all he had, — in this last lesson, 
From the grammar he went on to the writ- 
ing lesson. And for this, quite new copies had 
been prepared. They were written on clean, 
new slips of paper, and they were: — 
France: Alsace. 
‘rance: Alsace. 
All up and down the aisles they hung out 
from the desks like little banners, waving : — 
France: Alsace. 
France: Alsace.

And everybody worked with all his might, 
— not asound could you hear but the scratch- 
ing of pens on the “ France: Alsace.” 
Even the little ones bent over their up and 
down strokes with their tongues stuck out to 
help them work. 
After the writing came the reading lesson, 
and the little ones sang their ba, be, bi, bo, bu. 
Right in the midst of it, Franz heard a cu- 
rious sound, a big deep voice mingling with 
the children’s voices. He turned round, and 
there, on the bench in the back of the room, 
the old blacksmith sat with a big A B C book 
open on his knees. It was his voice Franz had 
heard. He was saying the sounds with the 
little children, — ba, be, bi, bo, bu. His voice 
sounded so odd, with the little voices, —so 
very odd, — it made little Franz feel queer. 
He thought it was funny; he guessed he 
would laugh; then he guessed he would n’t 
laugh ; he felt — he felt very queer. 
So it went on with the lessons; they had 
them all. And then, suddenly, the town clock 
struck noon. And at the same time they heard 
the tramp of the Prussians’ feet, coming back 
from drill. 
It was time to close school.

The master stood up. He was very pale. 
Little Franz had never seen him look so tall 
He said : — 
“ My children —my children ” —but some- 
thing choked him; he could not go on. In- 
stead he turned and went to the black-board 
and took up a piece of chalk. And then he 
wrote, high up, in big white letters, “Vive la 
France!” 
And he made a little sign to them with his 
head, “ That is all; go away.” 
THE STORY OF CHRISTMAS 
There was once a nation which was very 
powerful, very fortunate, and very proud. Its 
lands were fruitful; its armies were victorious 
in battle; and it had strong kings, wise law- 
givers, and great poets. But after a great 
many years, everything changed. The nation 
had no more strong kings, no more wise law- 
givers; its armies were beaten in battle, and 
neighboring tribes conquered the country and 
took the fruitful lands; there were no more 
poets except a few who made songs of lamen- 
tation. The people had become a captive and 
humiliated people ; and the bitterest part of ail 
its sadness was the memory of past greatness.
-P-A-G-E-275

But in all the years of failure and humilia- 
tion, there was one thing which kept this people 
from despair; one hope lived in their hearts 
and kept them from utter misery. It was a 
hope which came from something one of the 
great poets of the past had said, in prophecy. 
This prophecy was whispered in the homes of 
the poor, taught in the churches, repeated from . 
father to son among the rich; it was like a 
deep, hidden well of comfort in a desert of 
suffering. The prophecy said that sometime a 
deliverer should be born for the nation, a new 
king even stronger than the old ones, mighty 
enough to conquer its enemies, set it free, and 
bring back the splendid days of old. This 
was the hope and expectation all the people 
looked for; they waited through the years for 
the prophecy to come true. 
Tn this nation, in a little country town, lived 
a man and a woman whose names were Joseph 
and Mary. And it happened, one year, that 
they had to take a little journey up to the 
town which was the nearest tax-centre, to have 
their names put on the census list; because. 
that was the custom in that country. 
But when they got to the town, so many 
others were there for the same thing, and it
-P-A-G-E-276
  252 HOW TO TELL STORIES 
was such a small town, that every place was 
crowded. There was no room for them at the 
inn. Finally, the inn-keeper said they might 
sleep in the stable, on the straw. So they 
went there for the night. 
And while they were there, in the stable, 
their first child was born to them, a little son. 
And because there was no cradle to put him 
in, the mother made a little warm nest of the 
hay in the big wooden manger where the oxen 
had eaten, and wrapped the baby in swaddling 
clothes, and laid him in the manger, for a bed! 
That same night, on the hills outside the 
town, there were shepherds, keeping their 
flocks through the darkness. They were tired 
with watching over the sheep, and they stood 
or sat about, drowsily, talking and watch- 
ing the stars. And as they watched, behold, 
an angel of the Lord appeared unto them! 
And the glory of the Lord shone round about 
them! And they were sore afraid. But the 
angel said unto them, “Fear not, for behold 
I bring you good tidings of great joy, which 
shall be to you and to all people. For unto 
you is born, this day, in the city of David, a 
saviour, — which is Christ the Lord. And 
this shall be a sign unto you: ye shall find
-P-A-G-E-277
  STORIES SELECTED AND ADAPTED 253 
the babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying 
in a manger.” 
And suddenly there was with the angel a 
multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, 
and saying, “ Glory to God in the highest, 
and on earth peace, good will toward men.” 
When the angels were gone up from them 
into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, 
“Come now, let us go unto Bethlehem, and 
see this thing which is come to pass, which 
the Lord hath made known unto us.” And 
they came, with haste, and they found Mary, 
and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
And when they saw him in the manger, they 
knew that the wonderful thing the angel said 
had really happened, and that the great de- 
liverer was born at last.

SOURCES FOR THE STORY-TELLER 
Tue story-teller who is asked to recom- 
mend books from which may be drawn stories 
to tell, feels the embarrassment of an apparent 
meagreness in the face of seeming plenty. 
Yet if he is honest with the asker, he must 
be thus meagre. There are hundreds, nay 
thousands, of charming books for children to 
read ; it would be easy enough to recommend 
one hundred out of the many ; but small good 
would the list bring the student. The books 
in which the story-teller really finds worthy 
material are very few; those having the ma- 
terial in a form easily adapted for telling are 
fewer. And when the few are found, they are 
usually not those already made or altered for 
children’s use,—they are the strong, close 
versions of old stories, or the original, modern 
form of new stories. The transmitter of a fine 
old tale should have its real savor in his ima- 
gination, no weakened and mixed taste; the 
necessary simplifying can be done by him, but 
should not be done for him.

Unfortunately, few translators and editors 
have the peculiar form of genius necessary for 
their task. Some have sacrificed beauty of 
style to accuracy of content, and others have 
changed the spirit by their style. It is, there- 
fore, necessary for the story-teller to use his 
own touchstone in every case. After some 
initial aid and practice he will find himself 
gathering stories in the natural and only suc- 
cessful way, —not of set purpose always, and 
seldom in number; but one here, one there; 
from a sudden memory, a chance look into a 
volume on a friend’s table, an anecdote heard 
at the club, from another teacher, from gen- 
eral readings. The world is full of stories for 
opened ears. 
The following sources are recommended as 
having proved really fertile in stories to tell. 
From them selection must be made; and often 
the selected story must be adapted. Those 
which are given chiefly for richness of mate- 
rial — without especial grace of style — are 
marked with the letter “M.” Those which can 
be used only with much adaptation are marked 
“A.” The first two books on the list are 
suggested for their unusual and very valuable 
closeness to the form of oral delivery. Mrs.

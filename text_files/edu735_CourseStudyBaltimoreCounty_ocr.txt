1921 REVISION 
At the time of publication of the 1919 edition of Baltimore County 
Course of Study, the work in Composition and Grammar was under- 
oing revision by the supervisors of Baltimore County Schools in 
ith the teachers, in the same manner that the entire 
eriginally constructed and developed. This revisicn 
essed far enough to be incorporated into the several 
i the text since January, 1919; but it now appears as 
921 Revision. 
et is section the text was expanded by ten pages. In 
paging of other sections would not be disturbed, 
plementary pages are inserted with letter folios be- 
The folios of other parts of the book are 
the present text, pages 83 to j(140) inclusive cover 
e k in Composition and Grammar. 
School systems and individuals now using copies of earlier print- 
ings of the book may obtain this-revised matter which will be issued 
separately in pamphlet form and sold, at cost, only to those on 
record as purchasers of earlier editions of the book. From time 
to time, other sections of the course may be worked over and re- 
vised, so that the text will always be keptup to date, and provision 
will be made to supply any user of the text with jsuch subsquent 
revision, in pamphlet form, so that his own text copy may be made 
to reflect the growth and revision of the work being done in Baltimore 
County Schools, where the Course of Study is a live course of study.

   Introduction. / Reading is beyond comparison the most import- 
ant of the conventional school exercises, not only because it is the 
key to the world’s great literature, but because any considerable 
advancement in the other departments of school work is impossible 
without it. 
The attempt is made to fix permanent habits of selecting and read- — 
ing good literature by providing from the earliest grades only good 
literature. Stories are told in one grade and read in the next. The 
material rich in childhood’s fancy bears this sort of repetition because 
it has permanent value in stimulating the imagination in this most 
impressionable period. 
Two distinctive characteristics of the primary period are summar- 
ized in imagination and imitation. They are used as means to sur- 
mount the difficulties of learning how to read without losing the joy 
which is essential. ‘To miss the joy is to miss all.” Idealsof good 
reading are established by a judicious use of these two gifts through — 
skillful questioning on the part of the teacher to stimulate creative — 
thinking and by reading to the children in a simple, clear, dramatic, 
yet unaffected manner.’ Children read for the same reason as adults, 
so a natural, wholesome atmosphere should be maintained by supply- 
ing proper motives and rational procedures. 
>-« The aim of primary reading, as in all reading, is the interpretation 
of the printed page with accuracy and a reasonable degree of rapidity. 
The realization of this aim is dependent upon (1) the mastery of the 
tools, or the mechanics of reading, (2) the ability to interpret thé 
thought, (3) increased skill in expressive utterance. Of necessity 
much time is devoted to the mechanics of reading in the. primary 4 
grades. While the study of the form, sound, and meaning of words, 
commonly called Word Study, occupies much attention, it does not 
eclipse expression of thought. Reading here, as in later grades isa 
search for ideas and their interpretation for personal or social enjoy- 
ment. In all the grades, according to the need of the class, study for 
word mastery and thought getting through the contex precedes 
practice in oral reading. 
*Considerable material and many of the ideas in this section have been draj 
from The Elementary Course in English by Professor James Fleming Hosic, Head of 
the Department of English Chicago Normal College. Unless otherwise indicated, 
all quoted material in the outline for Grades I to IV has been taken from Professor 
Hosic’s Course. a)

    COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
A judicious use of phonetics; of word and phrase drills; of exercise in 
enunciation, articulation, and pronunciation; of exercises to increase 
the reading pace are essentials in gaining power to read and these 
drills follow rather than precede the interpretation. As we learn 
to walk by walking, to talk by talking, to write by writing, so we 
learn to read by reading. Good material is provided from the best 
sources, and effort is made to imbibe the spirit, the joy and the pur- 
pose of the author and recreate them to social ends. 
t+: Lessons are of two types; the silent or preparatory, and the oral or 
dramatic. In the primary grades both are usually accomplished in 
. the same lesson period. 
_. Silent Readings Silent or preparatory reading is for the purpose 
of clearing up. word difficulties, getting meaning from the printed 
page, and its oral reproduction, together with some oral reading for 
_ the purpose of clarifying ideas. It serves the purpose of training 
children how to study.) Silent reading should be an important fea- 
ture of the work for several reasons: (1) outside of the schoolroom 
reading is almost entirely silent, and children should acquire the 
habit of intelligent and sufficiently rapid silent reading, (2) if silent 
reading leads to questions on the part of children, or to constructive 
thinking, this is better proof of mastery of the thought than is often 
afforded by oral reading, (3) the ambitious child is given an oppor- 
tunity to read more than he otherwise might, and the slower child is 
timulated to increase his pace as measured by himself, (4) the 
irit of quiet, and the respect for the rights of others is inculcated. 
The Pleasure or Voluntary Reading, therefore, furnishes an excellent 
pportunity to train in good library habits established in silent 
ding periods. Children of third and fourth years should also be 
encouraged in home reading by the use of school library books 
and additions to the home library. 
Oral Reading.Oral or dramatic reading is a necessity in pri- 
ary grades. Young children are instinctively dramatic, and live 
a make-believe world and reading offers a fertile field for the culti- 
vation of this power. Words take on a new life and meaning when 
ynce the thought is mastered and made real through dramatic ac- 
on, and reading becomes a delight. A new relation is established 
ough a real social situation which changes the whole attitude to- 
d reading drill and reading. The consciousness of an audience 
d the desire to be the character in the play aids the speaking voice, 
engthens clear distinct utterance, leads to self-forgetfulness, and 
ures the undivided attention and interest of all. A proper 
ture is more easily secured by which to maintain an alert 
   
-P-A-G-E-6
  READING—PRIMARY GRADES 3 
mental attitude; and poise, ease, and control are established with 
comparative ease in this pleasant social relation. Facing the audi- 
ence is felt by the children to be as essential as it is natural. 
Since reading is primarily a social exercise many opportunities in 
the classroom and in the school are utilized to stimulate motives 
governing the desire to read aloud. The following are suggestive: 
a. To give information from a book not in the hands of the 
other pupils: ‘Playing audience.” 
b. To give pleasure to self and to others: ‘Playing book,” 
or ‘Dialogue reading.” 
c. To dramatize as one reads, or to read while others drama- 
tize: ‘Dramatic reading.” 
d. To prepare for special occasions: Morning exercises, assem- 
blies, festival days. 
e. To read occasionally to another class in school. . 
f. The organization of a Reading Club, or a Dramatic Club 
or a Story-Telling Club. (A club of this nature can be organ- 
ized with pleasure and profit in the fourth year, and possibly in 
the third, as a means of stimulating expressive oral rendition.) 
Corrections and criticisms of reading should be made by both 
teacher and children, taking the form of a judgment passed upon the 
effort, If a problem is set which involves thinking and therefore © 
better interpretation, criticism can be carefully and wisely directed — 
which will avoid rehearsal of non-essentials or aimless fault-finding. 
‘Be definite, to the point, and detailed. Commend good points, and 
. justify both favorable and adverse criticism. 
A widespread interest in measurement in education aids in estab- 
lishing standards in reading, as well as in arithmetic or spelling. | 
“The increase in mastery of technique means a result in the attain- 
ment of a proper degree of skill. The work to attain a result varies 
with each child, but the result shall be the same with each child. 
Uniformity of result is the chief characteristic of successful teach. 
ing.”—Courtis. Individual differences make it impossible for all to 
attain the score of the highest, but there is a common, normal 
standard attainable by the majority. Tests aid teachers in deter- 
mining standards, and the following are recommended: 
a. A vocabulary test for the first and second grades. 
b. A speed test for determining the reading rate of the class. 
c. A test determining retention of content for third and fourth — 
grades. 
To meet the variation in reading ability group-work is invaluable,

  4 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
a specific set of drills designed to correct their personal shortcomings 
and to bring them up to grade. Children grouped according to the 
common failings can be given definite aid in class periods and in the 
Library Hour. Self-organized groups under the leadership of a 
strong, capable member of the class or an eighth grade student 
whenever available should be fostered and encouraged. 
Seatwork. Seatwork in connection with reading should consist 
of such expressive work as serves to clarify thought-content. Train- 
ing the child how to study reading is the aim.) Independence on the 
part of the worker is the goal desired. In primary grades, the needs 
and capacities of children demand work which will aid in the growth 
of the vocabulary, and in the ability to get thought from the printed 
page with ease. Seatwork then should emphasize both form and 
thought-content through word-study and simple problems based 
upon the lesson material, using handwork as a necessary and useful 
agent when words and ideas can be strengthened thereby.

   FIRST GRADE READING 
Interesting material is the most important factor in teaching 
hildren to read.) The work in story-telling, memorizing, dramatiz- 
_ing and conversations about familiar and interesting things in the 
_child’s experience furnish a splendid basis for first grade reading. 
Since the story, the song, the game, the occupation of the little 
child’s day are but phases of one unity, the reading comes simply as 
- another means of expression, and the teacher’s preparation of lesson 
material preceding each lesson considers the material in relation to 
- the child’s growing capacity and lays a foundation for the use of the 
ext which is to*be placed in his hands. 
Reading for the thought influences the child’s attitude toward read- 
“ing, as well as the manner of reading. ) Intelligent reading, oral and 
ilent, depends upon getting the thought, fluent reading depends 
pon the habit of seeing more than one word at a glance. Thought 
is expressed in groups of words. A combination of sentence, word 
nd phonetic methods, with constant use of the board, seems to be a 
ational method of procedure, and might be termed the natural 
method. The child experiences the fact from the beginning that 
eading is a thought-getting and thought-giving process. ‘The analy- 
is of the sentence gives the phrase; soon the analysis brings the word,

  READING—FIRST GRADE 5 
and later the final element, sound. This last is of great importance 
and value, as it gives the child the power to discover for himself 
words and sentences. 
It will be observed that other lessons contribute to the reading Jes. 
son, and often, therefore, not all the steps occur at the reading period. 
There should be two reading lessons and one word drill or phonetic 
lesson daily,* and as much incidental reading in connection with 
other activities as possible. 
The first lessons are rhymes and cumulative tales, together with 
interesting everyday experiences, printed upon manilla tag board by 
the aid of price and sign markers, or written on the blackboard in 
large, round script. These are termed Language Reading Units. 
As soon as a sufficient vocabulary is gained the book may be intro- 
duced, and used interchangeably with blackboard reading lessons. 
Time Allotment: Reading: including word study, phonetics, spell- 
ing. Recitation: Four 15 minute periods per day. Seat work: 
Three 15 minute periods per day. Total: 525 minutes per week. 
Lesson Procedures 
1. Study lessons with the teacher in class time. 
2. Seat work based upon the story previously read with the 
teacher. 
3. Silent reading based upon the familiar vocabulary of the text, 
changing the order of the sentences. 
4. Oral or dramatic reading; reading and playing the story. 
5. Oral reading to increase ease and fluency; review of old material 
arranged around some interesting center, as Kitty Stories, Bird 
Stories, Fairy Tales. 
6. Lessons for quickening pace in reading familiar material :— 
a. Use a review story. Teacher begins a sentence anywhere. 
Child who finds the place first, stands and reads. 
b. Time the children to see how far they can read in a given 
number of seconds. 
c. Time the children to see how long it takes to read a certain 
page. 
d. Book closed over the finger. At a given signal, open and 
read until teacher says, “Close books.’’ Each child tries to tell 
what his eyes caught during the second. 
e. Use perception cards, phrase and sentence slips. 
f. Often two or more kinds will be used in the same recitation.

Materials: First Half Year 
I. Some interesting nursery rhymes, stories, poems chosen from 
literature: 
1. Nursery Rhymes: Jack and Jill, Little Bo-Peep, Little Miss 
Muffet, Robin Redbreast. 
2. Repetition Tales: The Little Red Hen, The Three Pigs, The 
Pan Cake. 
3. Finger Plays: The Family, The Beehive. 
II. Some interesting everyday experiences: 
1. Conversations about simple things in nature. 
2. Conversations about children’s games, toys. 
3. Conversations about familiar occupations. 
4. Stories told by the teacher. Dramatized, retold by the 
children. c 
III. Selected lessons from the Holton, Brooks’, Summers’, Reading 
Literature, Story Hour Primers; Progressive Road, Book One. 
Method: r 
I. PRE-PRIMER WorRK: LANGUAGE READING UNITS 
First Step—The Oral Story. Hearing and telling the story. 
Second Step—Playing and dramatizing the situations. 
Third Step—Conversations upon which the mechanics of reading 
are based :— 
1. Simple, brief, animated, interesting. Pictures, objects, draw- 
ings used as aids. 
2. Essential or suggestive thoughts recorded on the blackboard, 
in simple, brief, childlike terms. Children’s responses to well for- 
mulated questions will be used, modified to fit the growing power of 
the class. 
3. Recognition of the sentence unity is the first step. Read the 
sentence not word by word but asa whole. Develop the sentence 
sense first. The first sentences are often one word, as in action 
sentences. As soon as recognition of different sentences takes place 
words should be differentiated. Sentences should be written on the 
board in as perfect form as possible. Repeat the same sentence, the 
words, and phrases until familiarity is gained, remembering that 
the stimulus of interest lessens drill. 
4 Observe this sequence:—sentence, word, phonetics, and letters. 
Fourth Step—These simple language reading units may be mimeo- 
graphed and incorporated in a first reading book for each child.

  READING—FIRST GRADE a. 
II. Book READING Lessons 
First Step—The Oral Story. 
Second Step—The Dramatization. 
Third Step—Conversation, coupled with blackboard work pre- 
paratory to the text:— 
1. Sentences similar to those of the text, emphasizing certain 
‘words and phrases of the text. 
2. Finding sentences, phrases and words in the text. 
3. Word study: sight and phonetic. 
4, Silent reading; sentences, paragraphs, pages worked through 
for thought, under teacher’s guidance; thorough drill in glancing 
through the material; drill to increase speed. 
5. Oral reading; gradually increasing from one sentence, to two 
or more, the paragraph, a part, and the whole story. Enough imagi- 
nation stimulated through the pictures, the dvaroatiza tions the dia- 
logue, to keep the story alive. 
Fourth Step—Drills to secure word and aja control. Em- 
phasize articulation, enunciation, and pronunciation:— 
1. Drill on sight words, all words learned as wholes. The phonetic 
word is learned as a whole and later used as basis for introducing 
phonetic family. 
2. Drill on phrases, to establish word relationships and phrase 
unity. 
3. Drill on sentences, to give skill in fusing individual words of 
a sentence into a thought unity, e.g. “flash” sentences. 
4. Drill on phonetics, to secure independent word mastery. 
Devices:—word cards, phrase cards, sentence slips, in conjunction 
with the blackboard. 
Games—of finding, showing, telling, racing, guessing, hunting, 
matching, grouping, making riddles. 
Fifth Step—Seat work. 
1. Illustration of story, sentence, word; using lentils, crayons, 
chalk, paper and scissors, folding, clay modeling. 
2. Formal drawing—tracing pictures, coloring outline prepared by 
the teacher. 
3. Rhythmical work—using lentils, sticks, seeds, leaves. Repeat 
the exercise in borders for rugs, wall-paper. 
4. Matching—sentences, sentences and pictures, words and pic- 
tures. 
5. Sorting—words and sentences; finding words alike, separating 
known words from unknown.

sounds are known; building words when model is given; building 
words from memory; building original sentences. 
8. Writing from copy: words that rhyme; sentence from the black- 
board. Use blackboard freely. 
WORD STUDY 
Word study is a convenient term for the work with words presented in this grade. 
It includes the treatment of words as wholes, singly and in phrases; spelling; and 
drills for speech control. Such lessons may well take the form of lively, interesting 
games, the purpose being to secure instantaneous recognition and recall of a suitable 
stock of sight and phonetic words acquired in the reading. 
I. Worp DriLis 
1. Repetition of sight words selected from reading lessons. 
2. Phrase and sentence work to increase reading pace, by training the eye. 
3. Devices: blackboard, word cards, phrase and sentence slips. 
4, Games: competitive and time tests. 
II. PHONETICS 
Aim: By the end of the first six months in school children should be able to 
attack new words in the reading by thinking in order the sounds of their separate 
letters and blending them into the word. Preparation and drill at first will not be in 
connection with the reading lesson proper. Word building may be begun as soon 
as the child has learned enough sounds. (Application of phonetics to the reading 
may be begun as soon as the child knows thé written symbol in words for the separate 
sounds he has been learning through ear and lip. 
Material: 
1. Sounds of consonants and short vowels; phonograms with short vowels de- 
veloped from sight words in relation to the thought content of reading lessons. 
2. See and Say, Book One, a guide for the teacher. 
Method: 
1. Observe the following order, presenting the sounds and letter names simulta- 
neously through names and pleasant associations: f, s, t, p, c, h, m, r, w, b, k, 1, 
j, n, d, qd, V, X, ¥»a e, i,.0, Ww 
2. Ear training. Pronounce simple words slowly until children recognize initial 
and final consonants taught; the phonograms. 
3. Ear and eye training. Words written on board; initial sound given, the phon- 
ogram developed from sight words. 
4, Printed lists of words for each child, if possible. A chart or list on blackboard 
kept for drill. 
5. Individual and some concert work, e. g., all sound, one child name, and vice-versa. 
6. Beginning to apply phonetics. Through words of reading lessons lead children 
to recognize the known sounds, initial and final consonants, and then the elements 
in the phonogram. 
7. Games to give variety in drill.
-P-A-G-E-12
  READING—FIRST GRADE 9 
III. SPELLING 
1. Word study—of words, phonetic and other groupings, in relation to reading 
and other studies. 
a. Recognition by use of perception cards, blackboard drill. 
b. Games—finding, telling, showing, racing, testing. 
2. Sight spelling. Begin with one word. 
a. Present the word, writing in full, large script on blackboard. 
b. Children concentrate upon the word picture. Erase the word. 
c. Children write, preferably at board. Correct any error by presenting the 
word whole again. 
3. Reviews. Weekly recall of the five words presented during the week. Spell- 
ing and phonetic booklets, made at first by the teacher, later by the children, to aid 
in monthly review. 
4. Dictionary making. Word collections made according to various criteria; 
phonetic, alphabetical, other groupings. 
5. Writing words that rhyme, at least two. As much blackboard work as possible. 
At the end of the First Half Year the children should be able to 
read simple sentences, as wholes, but not word by word, from both 
blackboard and primers. Fifty lessons from the primers is the 
minimum amount. Short vowel sounds, and all consonants, should 
be known; the recognition of some phonograms, and word-making 
from these phonograms is essential. The child’s name, a word vo- 
cabulary and simple sentences should be written from copy. 
Note: Children whose progress has been unsatisfactory should be 
given an opportunity to repeat the work at this time. 
eal Second Half Year 
Interesting material selected from the content-subjects: literature, 
nature study, history—

list of about 125 words may be entered alphabetically in a book as each word is pre- 
sented during the year, or a printed dictionary containing the entire list may be given 
each child in April as a summary of the words given throughout the year.

nw ss “Copy sentences chosen by teacher and children from lesson. 
~ 8, Copy the class story, occasionally, one sentence, or an elliptical sentence. 
f At the end of the First Year the children should be able to read 
‘.. with.ease from any of the books listed for the First Grade; should be 
able to recognize the phonograms in common use; should be able to 
recognize the words of the vocabulary test singly and in sentences. 
» Oral and.written spelling of the phonetic families and the spelling 
vocabulary of one hundred twenty-five words should be accomplish- 
) ed with ease. 
SECOND GRADE READING 
“Pupils should read for the same reason as adults, that is, because 
they are interested If the work of the first year is skillfully done 
and ’a supply of suitable books is at hand, children will do so.” 
., The first year’s work aims to lay a foundation for independent word- 
mastery without sacrificing the child’s joy in reading, through 
emphasis upon the mechanics together with training in the habit 
of looking for the thought and giving it expression. The second 
grade work continues this by insisting that a child shall use all the. 
knowledge and power he has in finding out a sentence for himself 
after the means have been provided. The conquering spirit is in- 
stilled, by the right presentation of material that is worth while 
in both first and second years. Worthless material destroys the 
motive and kills the joy of learning to read. ‘The business of the 
teacher is to relate reading properly to the other activities of the 
school,”’. . . the nature observations, the history and literature, 
and to guide the children, under this stimulus, in forming good 
reading habits. ‘‘Discriminating use should be made of the black- 
board, printed slips, mimeographed lessons and a Mijn of ‘ead. 
ing books.”   
-P-A-G-E-17
   14 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
There should be both silent and oral reading procedures though 
usually both are used in the same recitation: 
(1) The silent reading or preparatory work gives opportunity for 
drills to eradicate difficulties, for testing thought-getting through 
reproduction, for various kinds of seatwork, and for quickening read- 
ing pace. (2) “In the oral work distinctness, appropriate expression, 
pleasing tone of voice should be secured.” There should be simple 
game drills to strengthen speech control, enough stirring of the im- 
agination through pictures, dramatization, conversation, to keep the 
contest alive; there should be opportunity for the child to hear good 
reading from the teacher, and from other classes to give ideals for 
him to imitate. » 
Reading is primarily a social exercise and many opportunities in 
the class room and the school should be utilized to furnish rational 
motive for further drill, as “Playing Book,’ ‘“Dramatization,” 
“Playing Audience,” “Reading to Other Classes” and at School 
Assemblies. The success of the work is measured not by the number 
of words which a child knows, nor the number of books he has read, 
but by the ease with which he attacks new material. 
Time Allotment: Reading, including word study, phonetics and 
spelling. Recitation: Four 15 minute periods per day. Seat-work: 
Three 15 minute periods per day. Total: 525 minutes per week. 
Material: 
Reading related to history, nature-study, literature, wisely adapt- 
ed to the children’s needs and interests. 
1. Language reading units. Blackboard lessons or mimeograph- .

; I. LANGUAGE READING UNITS Material: 
Stories and simple, interesting summaries gleaned from history, 
literature and nature. 
1. Oral work precedes. Language reading units are based upon 
some phase of a content subject, the essential thought being record-, 
ed in natural, child-like terms upon the board. This may be the 
class-story to which the children contribute; it may be wholly con- 
structed by the teacher, and, occasionally, the independent oral or 
written work of children may be used. 
2. The teacher’s preparation makes it possible for her to organize 
the material given by the class in response to her logical sequence 
of questions, into a co-ordinated, attractive whole. Good structure 
and form are observed in title, paragraph, and the sequence of sen- 
tences. These reading lessons may be mimeographed and incor- 
porated in a reading book for purposes of review. 
Method: 
1. Motives for reading the class story: to find better ways of 
stating what is known; to enjoy the result of the creative effort. 
2. Eradication of difficulties by enough word, phrase and sen- 
tence drill to insure smoothness, facility and ease. 
3. Expression secured by stimulating questions, and by imitation 
of teacher and good readers in the class. 
4, Seat work. Illustrating, copying or modifying a part of the 
class story; or word study. 3 
II. BoOK-READING LESSONS 
1. Material selected to emphasize some point in a content sub- 
, ject, correlating with history, literature, nature, and other school 
subjects. 
Method: 
1. Motive supplied; reading in answer to some felt need. 
2. Silent or study reading, eradication of difficulties accomplish- 
ed in part by the language reading unit, by word study, and enough 
drill to insure smoothness, facility and ease.

16 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
_ 8. Oral reading: expression secured by stimulating questions, by 
setting ideals for imitation. 
4, Seat work: emphasizing word study or content. 
WORD STUDY 
Word study is a convenient heading for several different aspects of the work 
with words. In the second grade this includes (1) training in visualization by the 
use of perception cards, blackboard lists, phrase and sentence slips, (2) phonetics and 
spelling and (3) additional exercises by which to gain better speech control, em- 
phasizing enunciation, pronunciation, and good voice tones. 
1. Worp Dritis 
1. Increase the vocabulary through repetition of sight words selected from read- 
ing lessons; through word building, phonetic and other criteria. 
2. Phrase and sentence work to increase reading pace by training the eye. 
3. Devices: blackboard, word cards, phrase and sentence slips. 
4, Games. 
II. PHONETICS 
A judicious use of phonetics is made a basis for gaining word control, though its 
exclusive use is not recommended. Silent phonetic analysis should take the place 
of oral analysis as soon as possible, and should be consciously continued through- 
out the primary grades. The work in phonetics should result in (1) good articula- 
tion; (2) independent power to call new words. 
Material: 
1. Review sounds of consonants and short vowels; simple phonograms. 
2. Long vowel sounds. Simple phonetic laws for long and short vowels. Suffixes 
—ing, ed, er, est. 
3. Building and blending words of short and long vowel sounds. 
4, Selected words for daily drill in enunciation and pronunciation. Reference: 
See and Say, Book II. 
Method: 
1. Drill on consonants and phonograms from charts and blackboard. Games. 
2. Familiar word presented, analyzed into its parts, building other words upon 
the phonetic syllable, or, making rhyme words. 
3. Phonetic lists recorded in books for this purpose. Children held responsible 
for the work presented. 
4, Developing the rule which is to be memorized. 
5. Use of words in phrases and sentences. 
6. Daily applications in reading. 
III. DRILLS FOR SPEECH CONTROL 
1. “Simple breathing exercises. 
2. Practice in pronunciation, using the list of words commonly mispronounced 
by the class group. 
3. Articulation of consonants and molding of vowels by securing open throat 
proper use of lips, tongue and teeth. 
4, Jingles and simple poems used to improve flexibility and strength of lips and 
tongue.” 
5. Syllabication of words; oral spelling. .
-P-A-G-E-20
READING—SECOND GRADE 17 
IV. SPELLING 
“Accurate imaging of words, correct pronunciation and graphic expression are 
the essential factors.” Oral spelling of simple familiar words should become auto- 
matic, and accompany written work. The choice of words is determined by those 
,most common to the child’s speaking vocabulary, those longest known and most 
commonly used, and they will be presented as the needs for them arise in connection 
with language and reading. Not more than five words daily should be given, and 
of those, two should be review. The grade list consists of 250 words in addition 
to the 125 of first grade. A second grade pupil is held responsible for 375 words. 
Material: 
1. Phonetic lists, with suffixes, s, es, d, ed, er, est, ing. 
2. Word collections according to various criteria. 
3. Words most commonly used in daily work. 
4, The grade list, which includes basic words from (1), (2), (3). 
Method: 
1. The Study Lesson. 
a. Pronounce the word; write on the board; erase. 
b. Children record at board or on paper. An error is corrected by giving the 
right form again. 
c. Continue until all the words are presented and recorded. 
2. The Study Lesson. 
a. Pronounce the word or phrase distinctly as you write. Children visualize 
quickly and accurately. 
b. Oral spelling of word or phrase with class watching. 
c. Find parts already known. Show difficult parts. 
d. Continue until all the words are presented in the same way. 
e. Compare words to find similarity and difference. 
f. Dictate. 
3. Dictation or Testing Lessons. Each study lesson is followed by some form of 
testing. 
a. Dictation: column, phrase, and sentence. Work at blackboard indispen- 
sable. 
b. Independent work: making phonetic lists; placing words in association; lan- 
guage work. 
4. Methods of Correcting Work. 
a. As children work at board the teacher notes the error at once, erases the in- 
correct form, writes the word, and again the child and the class visualize the cor- 
rect form, writing the word correctly. 
b. Checking work at the end of the dictation exercise. The correct form is 
placed upon the board; the child makes his correction, writing the correct form 
at one side. 
c. Placing upon the board the words misspelled by the majority, and asking 
children to find their own errors. Exchange of papers may be made occasionally. 
d. Teacher checking work and reporting to the class indicating the class 
and individual rating by some simple graphic representation. 
e. Dictionary making. Word collections according to various criteria: phonetic, 
alphabetical and other groupings suggested by subjects studied. Use as needed. 
to prevent and check incorrect spelling.

At the end of the Second Year, children should read with ease from 
any of the grade books, including those in the supplementary list; 
and show through the reading reasonable comprehension of the 
thought; should use phonetics with skill in discovering new words, 
and know two phonetic rules; should be held responsible for the words 
of the spelling lessons throughout the year, this being determined by 
dictation in lists and sentences, and in independent composition. 
The equivalent of two Second Readers, one supplementary and one 
pleasure reading. book, is the minimum requirement. 
Children whose work is unsatisfactory in reading, spelling, or pho- 
netics should be given an opportunity to repeat the work at this time. 
THIRD GRADE READING 
Much reading is a wise means for developing the power to read and 
creating a taste and love for good literature. By the end of the 
second year reading should have become a pleasure, and this read- 
ing-delight should be continued in the third grade through the ex- 
tended use of worth while material, together with those aids which 
help the child to become almost or entirely independent. “The 
process of learning to read should be fairly mastered by the close of 
the third vear.” 
Many different books ‘ . . . are provided to give abundant 
experience in getting thought and conveying it,” . . . and the 
teacher should see that the reading is closely related to the history, 
literature, geography, and nature study. The voluntary or pleas- 
ure reading should be encouraged through regularly appointed 
library hours, . . . “special pains being taken to put the simple 
and interesting book in the hands of the backward pupil,’’. . . and 
to give specific aid to individuals or small groups. 
When supplementary matter is wisely chosen, it becomes the test 
of the development lessons. When it is too difficult, it must receive 
the same attention as any reading lesson. If children are permitted 
to acquire slovenly habits, through difficulties not properly pre- 
sented, our work is faulty. Sight reading, therefore, should be easy 
material, occasionally; even then it should receive consideration in
-P-A-G-E-23
  20 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
presentation. Regular reading work, so-called, and supplementary 
reading should go hand-in-hand, throughout the year. 
There should be both silent and oral reading procedures, though 
often both are used in one recitation: 
The silent reading or preparatory work gives opportunity for drills 
to eradicate difficulties of vocabulary and speech control, for testing 
thought-getting through reproduction, for quickening the reading 
pace, for various kinds of seat work. The end now sought is fluency. 
Children soon show a marked advance (1) in the rapid recognition of 
words in phrases and sentences; (2) in their ability to look ahead, 
which results in their facility in reading groups of words at a 
glance; and toward the end of the year, (3) that habit of mind 
which finally leads to the grasp of a whole paragraph or page 
even, at a glance. 
In oral reading stress should be laid upon the reading to a listening 
audience of selections by individual pupils and upon dramatic or 
dialogue reading. Since reading is primarily a social exercise every 
opportunity should be sought to provide motives which stimulate the 
desire to read aloud. Though silent rather than oral reading is the 
practice in daily life in this formative period the oral should be 
emphasized. Correct oral delivery constitutes the proof of the 
reader’s understanding or lack of it, of the subject matter; it is 
the measure of his power and skill to give to others what he has 
gleaned from the text. 
Variation in reading ability requires that specific remedies be ap- 
plied to meet the variations in the needs of children. A careful 
analysis of the class based upon daily work, and tests of various kinds 
reveal the necessity for grouping children according to their common 
failings. The class is divided into two distinct groups according to 
ability, and while it is not advisable to change this order, yet the 
teacher should ‘hold in mind those who need special help and center 
her attention upon them during the regular reading period, and in the 
library hour, in order to secure the desired uniformity of result. 
Note: The required reading of a grade should be read by all 
pupils. This does not include all the supplementary material. It 
will sometimes seem advisable, with certain classes, to use books 
listed under lower grades. 
Time Allotment: Recitation: Two 20 minute periods per day. 
Seat work: 20 minutes per day. Total: 60 minutes per day, 
or 300 minutes per week. Voluntary or Pleasure Reading: 30 
minutes per week.

WORD STUDY 
Word Study includes work with sight words and phonetic words, oral and writ- 
ten spelling, word building by use of the simple prefixes, and suffixes, practice in 
correct breathing, in correct use of the organs of speech, by which to gain better 
speech control. Slurring of words, mouthing, nasal tones need attention.

recognition and recall. 
2. Devices: blackboard, cards, phrase slips. 
3. Games: emphasizing time tests to increase accuracy and speed. 
II. PHONETICS 
Systematic work with phonetics needs to be continued in this grade. “The acquire- 
ment of the pupils entering the class should be carefully estimated and a series of 
lessons planned to supplement and complete what has been begun.”” Phonetics must 
be used constantly as a means to word mastery by teacher and pupil, and as a means 
for better speech control. 
Material: 
1. Review difficulties met in Second Grade. Consult See and Say Book II, for 
suggestions. 
2. Phonetic blends based upon words selected from reading lessons, and from 
Phonetics for Schools by Robbins.

At the end of the Third Year children should be able to read with 
intelligence from Third Readers and easy supplementary material, 
and attain the standard for the grade. 
The equivalent of the Third Reader, two supplementary texts, in- 
cluding one book from Pleasure Reading List, is the minimum re- 
quirement. 
In phonetics, they should know six simple rules and apply them. 
Children who fail should be given an opportunity to repeat the 
work at this time. 
FOURTH GRADE READING 
Though the mechanics of reading are mastered by the end of the 
third year reading should still be carefully taught. Allowing 
a child to plod through sentences, paragraphs, and lessons without 
guidance is to foster gradual deterioration. The main work of the 
fourth grade is to provide such material and such motive that read- 
ing is still a delight. All work should aim to put the class into the 
atmosphere of the selection, so the reading will be ready, intelligent, 
and spirited. The study of new and difficult words singly and in 
phrases, should be continued as needed. Drill should be shorter and 
more pointed than in the preceding grades. More time should be 
given to discussion of content which helps in interpretation. ‘“Con- 
ducting a reading lesson is conducting, controlling, shaping a process 
of thinking in the mind of each individual in the class. The author 
of the selection is in control of the thinking process. The teacher’s _ 
value is measured by her power to help forward this thinking pro-- 
cess.”’—Laing. 
Both oral and silent reading procedures are continued, greater em- 
phasis now being placed upon independent study in seat assignments, 
the recitation period being used for purposes of testing thought-get- 
ting through discussion and reproduction of the text; for quickening 
the reading pace and testing retention of content through time tests; 
and for oral reading.  
-P-A-G-E-29
26 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
The purpose.and result of the work continued from the previous 
grade are many and very definite gains should be observed by the 
end of the year: 
a. Development of thinking power. 
b. Formation of good habits of study. 
c. Appreciation of good literature; development of taste. 
d. Cultivation of worthy social motives. 
e. Training in the acquisition of knowledge from the printed page. 
f. Training in pleasing oral reading. 
Voluntary or Pleasure Reading assumes significance in this grade 
and pupils are encouraged to read and report upon books in connec- 
tion with history, geography and nature, as well as stories for 
enjoyment. Give the impulse to each boy and girl to read at least 
two good, wholesome books outside of school this year. What the 
child learns to love to read and what he chooses to read are import- 
ant things. 
While silent reading is practised in daily life almost to the exclusion 
of oral rendition, yet the training in creative thinking should be 
given opportunity for expression in giving pleasure to others. Read- 
ing to a listening audience, training pupils to hear as well as to read, 
is important and to this end dramatic or dialogue reading should be 
continued. : 
Uniformity of result is desirable-but is attainable only by a careful 
diagnosis of the causes of variation in reading ability and applying 
specific remedies according to the varying needs of children, Group 
work in reading should receive special emphasis in this grade. Select 
material suited to the needs of individual children and determine a 
procedure which will by persistent effort raise the standard of the 
class. 
“The material for this grade should be mainly literary,”. . . 
thotgh much should also correlate with history, geography, and 
nature study. “One of the chief aims should be to teach how to 
study a book so as to grasp its essential meaning.” 
Note: The required reading of a grade should be read by all 
pupils. This does not include all the supplementary material.. It 
will sometimes seem advisable, with certain classes, to use bodks 
listed under lower grades. 
Time Allotment: Recitation: 25 minutes per day; 125 minutes per— 
week. Seatwork: 25 minutes per day. Total: 250 minutes per week. 
Voluntary or Pleasure Reading: Two half hour periods per week.

pp. 31 32. 
2. Two half hour periods per week. 
3. Plan definitely to use some of the time in giving specific drills 
designed to meet the needs of small groups. 
IV. Group WorK IN READING 
Variation in reading ability due to the variation in the needs of 
children should be clearly defined and specific remedial work applied. 
Individual attention is the best means in many instances but in large 
classes it is economy of effort to group children according to their 
common failings. Careful diagnosis reveals four groups. 
1. Suggested grouping. (Klapper.) 
Group I. Children who lack the power to recognize words. 
Group II. Children who lack the power of comprehension. 
Group III. Children who lack in expressive and convincing oral 
rendition.
-P-A-G-E-32
READING—FOURTH GRADE 29 
Group IV. Children who lack in clearness of speech, in articu- 
lation, enunciation. 
2. Remedial work:— 
For the first group, such work as the following: 
a. Phonetic analysis, blends, word study, phrasings, for smooth- 
ness. 
b. Reading o° single sentences and paragraphs in answer to 
stimulating questions. 
c. Silent reading and telling the story. 
For the second group, stress concentration of effort: 
a. Train child to listen; all books closed except that of the pu- 
pil who is called on toread. Test thought-getting by reproduction 
of paragraphs and parts of story; by thoughtful criticism of the 
rendition of the text. 
b. Silent reading; each child reads a different book, as in Vol- 
untary or Pleasure Reading, and prepares to ¢ell or read the most 
interesting part of the story. 
c. Interpreting the story through dramatic effort, as one reads. 
For the third group: 
a. Dramatic reading, each child dramatizing the thought ac- 
cording to his own interpretation. 4 
b. Stimulate effort by competitive tests in which judgment is 
exercised by the class, as in sending a representative to a first or 
second grade to read to them a familiar fairy or folk tale. 
For the fourth and last group: 
a. Drills for speech control. 
b. Dramatic work, without the text, and later, reading from 
the text combined with the dramatic effort. 
c. Stimulation by means of competitive tests. 
3. When to do this: 
a. List the pupils according to their respective weaknesses 
and definitely work toward eradication of difficulties in tne reading 
periods. 
b. Use a part of the time given to the Library Hour. 
c. Self-organized groups under the leadership of a strong, 
capable member of the class, or an eighth grade student whenever 
available. 
d. Stimulate home reading with a definite end in view, secur- 
ing the cooperation of both pupil and parent. 
WORD STUDY 
Occasional instruction in phonetics and persistent effort to secure good pronun- 
ciation by training the ear constitute one phase of the work. Oral and written

At the end of the Fourth Year the children should have attained a 
standard in reading measurable in terms of reading pace, retention of 
thought-content, voice, quality, and poise. The definite gains to be 
made in this grade stated in the introduction should be used to deter- 
mine a pupil’s fitness for advancement. 
The completion of the Fourth Reader, four supplementary texts, 
including two books from the Voluntary or Pleasure Reading List, 
is the minimum requirement.

VOLUNTARY OR PLEASURE READING FOR FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND 
FOURTH GRADES 
In many cities effective co-operation exists between public schools 
and public libraries. Public libraries should supplement the work 
of the school, serving children as well as adults in the formation of the 
library habit, thereby doing effective work in the community. Since 
there are no avaialble library centers for our children, the establish- 
ment of grade libraries in the schools, containing books suited to the 
varying interests of children according to their years, is the nearest 
approach to the ideal. Each grade should have a library of from 
forty to sixty different books, to be used in a period which may 
be termed ‘The L brary Hour.” 
Voluntary or Pleasure Reading affords an opportunity to famil- 
iarize children with a wider range of reading material than the usual
-P-A-G-E-36
  
READING—PRIMARY GRADES 33 
basic texts and the supplementary readers can supply. A child may 
read one or several books during the year according to his capacity. 
Two ends are thus served: (1) more practice in reading is provided, (2) 
familiarity with a wider field of literature is given. 
In first and second grades where reading still deals largely with the 
mechanics of reading, sets of books for each class group seem better 
adapted to the children’s needs than the individual, different books. 
In this case the home and school can well co-operate in the purchase 
of a set for the group and at the end of the year each child may claima 
copy for his own library at home. However by the beginning of the 
second half-year second grade children are interested in the Library 
Hour. “Playing Library” for one-half hour in second grade is ex- 
tended to two half hour periods in third and fourth years. 
THE PLAN 
Each child is permitted to select a book, under the teacher’s guidance, to keep for 
a week, or a month, record being made upon a Pleasure Reading Record Card as 
follows: 
VOLUNTARY OR PLEASURE READING 
  GraDE,————SCHOOL, TERM BEGINNING-————1915 
The Class The Books Ten B is 
Adams, Grace. .| Children of the Palm Lands 3 / ee none 
Brown, Frank...) Fi eee: in American History 
/15   
Enter in appropriate space date when each book is taken. Draw a colored line 
through date when a book is returned in good condition. Post the record on the 
bulletin board. During the Library Hour each child reads his own chosen book, 
the teacher giving assistance with difficulties whenever needed. It is, therefore, a 
silent reading period in which a teacher gives individual assistance, or works with a 
small group. Often a child reads to the teacher, frequently reproduces parts of the 
story. Occasionally a part of a story is told or read to the class as a test in thought- 
getting and thought-giving and serves as a stimulus to others in creating a desire to 
read the same interesting material. The incentive to listen is strengthened because 
new material is presented. The habit of careful reading is instilled and since each 
pupil feels responsible for the presentation of material which is his personal posses- 
sion, an increased improvement of vocabulary and manner of telling is noted. 
Voluntary or Pleasure Reading used intelligently and persistently, aids in the 
formation of good library habits, and inculcates a taste for good reading. Each 
grade above the second should add new books to the grade library each year, and 
the co-operation of the home and school should be sought by which an interchange 
of books from the home library and the school library may be effected. Each child 
should purchase at least one book a year for use at school; at the end of the year 
the book becomes the child’s personal property. The lists following for each of 
the grades are suggestive and cover the field of children’s interests; stories of human 
. life, especially child-life which provide opportunity for discussion of characters and
-P-A-G-E-37
  34 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
incidents thereby setting some standards and ideals of right conduct; stories of 
the preternatural, as found in Old Folks Tales, Modern Fairy Tales, and Classic 
Myths; stories of out-door life, touching upon nature and animal life; and some 
poetry. An attempt is made to keep a sense of proportion or balance in all fields 
of human endeavor.

HOME READING LISTS: PRIMARY GRADES 
The school cannot provide all the books with which children should become 
familiar. Nor should the school library exclude the necessity for the home library; 
one should supplement the other. 
Many of the books listed as voluntary, or pleasure-reading material could with 
equal right be placed in this list and vice versa; but the intention is to provide a 
suggestive list for both teachers and parents from which rational choice may be made. 
Co-operation of school and home should result in a wider use of books by a system 
of exchange. Teachers are expected to use tact in reading from thése books or 
having them read at home; the object is to create a taste for and to arouse the habit 
of reading good literature, and then to direct in a measure the reading children 
should do. 
This list is meant to be representative, not exhaustive. The volumes can be ob- 
tained from any reliable bookseller.

LITERATURE: PRIMARY GRADES* 
Introduction.—By common consent literature occupies a promi- 
nent place in the school curriculum since it not only has intellectual 
value but ethical and esthetic value as well. The work in literature 
aims to help the child to understand and interpret life about him and 
to create ideals which will help him to right living. It also carries 
him into the realm of the beautiful, opening to him an unlimited 
field of pleasure and enjoyment. 
In the primary grades where children can do little reading for them- 
selves the work in literary appreciation is accomplished principally 
by means of stories told by the teacher. As the child’s ability to 
read grows, these told stories gradually diminish in number, but this 
type of work in oral presentation is found valuable even in advanced 
grades. It is the purpose to have a story told and dramatized in one 
grade and read in the next. How varied the stories are in scope 
and character may be gathered from the outlines that follow. 
These lists are suggestive rather than fixed. Each teacher choos- 
ing from the extended list varies her stories from year to year 
being guided by the particular needs of her class or by some specific 
purpose she has in mind. 
Some stories are to be told or read to children for the simple en- 
joyment which they bring, others are reproduced, the shorter, simpler 
ones being used for this purpose. These are found most effective 
models, the child reproducing unconsciously the vocabulary, the ex- 
pression, even the enunciation he has heard. The teacher guides by 
means of questions and by simple outline in the reproduction of 
parts, lastly the whole unit thereby aiding the children to gain the 
vivid mental picture conveyed by the words. As much correction 
of errors in English as can take place without serious interruption of 
the child’s thought is given. 
Some poems as well as stories are presented to give pure delight, 
some for purpose of dramatization, some for purpose of recall. In 
teaching a memory selection the play of motive isimportant. Arouse pee 
the desire by the skillful use of the instincts of social co-operation; 
*Considerable material and many of the ideas in_this section have been drawn 
from The Elementary Course in English by Professor James Fleming Hosic, Head of 
the Department of English, Chicago Normal College. Unless otherwise indicated, 
all quoted material in the outline for Grades I to IV has been taken from Professor 
Hosic’s Course. (39)

emulation, pride, imitation. Memorize the poem by experiencing 
the thought in coherent units and parts of a larger whole with suffi- 
cient repetition in play or dramatization, in song, in recitation, call- 
ing upon children singly and in groups to fix the rythmic form. 
No teacher is expected to present all the poems listed for each 
.month. This list is sufficiently large and suggestive to admit of 
freedom of choice. Some poems are to be read or recited to the class, 
some are to be memorized by the class. Certain favorite selections 
are memorized in each grade. The list, too, varies with the class, 
with individual preferences and with the teacher’s purpose. Each 
grade, however, holds itself responsible for committing to memory a 
number of the finest selections on its list; this includes poems re- 
cited, stories told and dramatized. These are reviewed from year 
to year and new ones are added that the children may have grad- 
ually stored away in their minds some of the treasures that are 
their English birthright. 
Dramatic work is closely related to the work in story-telling and 
reading. It is a test of interpretation and tends to deepen content as 
well as to strengthen control of powers of expression. Four types of 
dramatic work are developed in practice: (1) Spontaneous work which 
is done without much planning with the children upon the com- 
pletion of a story. It simply is an expression in action of what the 
children have gained; (2) Deliberate planning directed by the teacher 
with reference to acts, scenes and characters. Several lessons might 
be given to the work, depending upon the purpose and amount of 
material; (3) This oral planning recorded in a permanent form in the 
language period. This finished result should have some definite 
purpose in view as an audience to witness and enjoy the result. It 
gives excellent opportunity for choosing language suited to the pur- 
pose and in organizing the work to a given end, determined by a 
stimulating motive; (4) Occasionally the dramatic work should be 
costumed, staged, and trained for a public performance, if the specta- 
cular element is subordinated to worthy ends. 
Opportunities for motivated work are found in the use of literature 
at the morning exercise, at the rest periods, in illustration of some 
specific point in the lesson, and for special occasions at school and 
at home. 
Illustrative material consisting of pictures, objects, and graphic 
illustrations is essential in all grades.

FIRST GRADE 
\The story and the poem have a large place in elementary educa- 
tion.) Each is a powerful instrument in the hands of an artistic 
teacher. a G. Stanley Hall says, “Of all the things that a teacher 
should know. how to do, the most important, without any exception, 
is to be able to tell a story.’’ It is indeed, the rainbow bridge by 
which we climb from earth to heaven. 
“The story is the natural means for instructing little children. It is 
the primitive and popular way of thinking; it awakens the imagina- 
tion and may train it; it cultivates the taste for literature. It affords 
the opportunity for language training by giving something to talk 
about, increasing skill in pronunciation; it develops the power to 
hold to a train of thought and strengthens the memory.” 
Nursery rhymes, finger plays, simple poems and cumulative 
stories characterize the material for this grade. The stories are of 
three types: The Old Folk Tale, as The Three Bears, Cinderella; 
the Modern Fairy Tale, as The Pig Brother; and the Fable, as The 
Lion and the Mouse. Some stories and poems are given for pleasure; 
some for their ethical value; some for definite language training.. The 
teacher’s voice and manner of telling should serve as an unconscious 
model. Occasionally a poem may be placed on the board for in- 
cidental reading. The children should be given a single complete 
impression of the whole usually accompanied with graphic illustra- 
tion to deepen the impression. [There should be no attempt to have 
the story retold until it has been heard more than once and has been 
grasped sufficiently for them to ask questions. A long story should 
then be told in parts by the teacher, retaining the spirit without 
violating the structure. Questions should carefully, guide the con- 
versation toward the telling of the story in partsand asa whole. The 
more dramatic rhymes and stories should be acted, largely at the 
suggestion of the children themselves. Only the shorter stories 
should be told by the children. The work with a poem should 
generally include memorizing and reciting by the pupils, individually 
and sometimes in concert. Aim for genuine expression. 
An average of one story a month for reproduction and dramatiza- 
tion, of one poem a month for memorizing, is the maximum require- 
ment, though many classes will accomplish much more. The mini- 
mum requirement will be six stories and six poems for the year. By 
the end of the year each pupil should be able to tell two stories from

beginning to end, and recite three poems, in a manner pleasing to the 
class. “The value of the story or poem can be measured by the 
interest of the children and their desire to make it their own.” 
With this in mind each child should be permitted to tell his favorite 
story and poem.

LITERATURE—-SECOND GRADE 45 
SECOND GRADE 
The children of the second year will read many of the stories which 
were told last year, but in addition to literature for reading, oral ren- 
dition of stories and poems which meet their widening interests is em- 
phasized. As we come to understand the dominant instincts and 
interests of children, great care is exercised to preserve a genuine and 
sincere response to the appeals which prose and poetry make. Sim- 
plicity of thought and structure, coupled with sincerity, is found in 
folk tale and fable, and these, together with simple lyrics of nature, of 
playtime, of ideals, of fun and fancy, and of love of country, constitute 
the basis for selection. A teacher is privileged to select material from 
the preceding grade. A genuine classic gains by repeated study—at 
suitable intervals and from a different point of view. 
Stories previously learned should beretold inthis grade. ‘“‘Favorite 
stories should be dramatized, with attention to the development of 
good dialogue.” As in the previous grade, the story should be told 
with graphic illustration, and retold in parts, by the children who are 
able now to make a simple analysis of a story. Short stories should 
be used for this incidental training in oral composition. Longer 
stories . . .“‘should occasionally be read to the class with no at- 
tempt at formal instruction. If the oral reproduction grows out 
of a clear understanding, the more of the language of the text 
the children may appropriate the better,”. . . but the story should 
never be memorized. The retelling should vary with each child. 
Poems will be memorized as the result of the child’s appreciation 
of the thought and the rhythmic form. Attention will be given to 
the unit of thought as the basis for memorizing and in the oral reci- 
tation the aim will be to secure genuine expression. 
School activities, the rest periods, the assembly, the morning exer- 
cise, special occasions, provide opportunity and furnish incentive for 
the repetition with interest of poems that have been memorized. 
Toward the end of the second year, some of the very short poems 
may be copied and illustrated. 
While the stories and poems are listed month by month for con- 
venience, the order may be changed and selections made at the 
discretion of the teacher, who will also want to substitute other poems 
for some on the list. Not all the stories and poems given can be 
presented each month, but there should be at least one story given 
for delight, and two short ones, or one long one for specific study with 
return from the children in reproduction and dramatization.

LITERATURE—THIRD GRADE 49 
Second year classes will be held responsible for six of the above 
poems, in addition to three poems memorized in First Grade. 
Numbers 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, 7 or 8, are required; the teacher may 
select three others from the above list, and any additional ones from 
previous lists. Am average of one poem a month for memorizing is the 
maximum requirement. At the end of the year, each child should be 
able to recite three poems from the list. 
THIRD GRADE 
As in the second grade, the children will-read many of the stories 
told and dramatized in the previous grade. Much of the reading 
material partakes of a literary character, supplementing the oral 
work in literature which, as before, includes both memorizing and 
oral expression. ‘Fundamentally, the method of all literature i is the 
same, but each selection presents peculiar interests and problems. 
Special study and specific planning is essential to secure success.’ 
Appreciation of form and content, and growth in command of good 
english expression is the end sought. 
* It is desirable that certain types of stories such as the folk-tale, 
thémodern fairy tale, the fable, the classic myth, and those deal- 
ing with some phases of child-life and activities of the outdoor 
world be continued in this grade. 
Longer stories are now presented, though the short fable is not 
neglected. “Opportunities for varied and effective work are clearly 
- defined,. . . as (1) reproduction in parts, in a complete whole, 
and (2) dramatization, (3) simple enjoyment.” Much illustrative 
material consisting of pictures, blackboard illustration, and objects, 
is essential in presentation to secure clear-cut concepts. Motives 
for story-telling should be provided through the avenues of vari- 
ous school activities. 
“Literature, especially poetry, is addressed primarily to the ear.” 
For this reason a faithful oral rendering is the most effective means to 
appreciation. ‘The teacher must, therefore, be a good interpreter, 
and should seek to develop like power in the class.’’ She should be 
able to read the poem with as good expression as possible, keeping 
it genuine and sincere. 
Through a study of the pictures which each unit of thought pre- 
sents, some insight into the imagery is gained. Helpful methods of 
memorizing are given by training in mastery of these successive 
units of thought as wholes. .Memorizing should be done in class 
under the supervision of the teacher, and continued in study periods
-P-A-G-E-53
  50 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
and at home. Much eitbention should be given to the effective ren- 
dering of the poem, in order that the audience may enjoy it. Arouse 
proper enthusiasm and it will afford excellent training in English 
as well as add enjoyment to the spiritual life of the school. 
The rhythm and imagery of poetry make a strong appeal to the 
imagination and memory, and, in addition to those learned in the 
previous grades, all pupils should learn at least six poems during the 
year. Many children will accomplish more. It should be borne in 
mind that most pupils will retain poems and stories learned in the 
earlier grades only by having them repeated from time to time under 
the stimulus of interest. Encourage the children to keep a record of 
the poems learned inall grades. If possible, provide each child with a 
printed copy, or have him make a copy in his poem book, and illus- 
trate with cuttings or drawings. 
Ethical and patriotic selections, nonsense verses, nature lyrics, 
and narrative poems each have their place, and care should be taken 
to provide for the varied interests of children. A sufficient number of 
stories and poems is listed for each month, enabling a teacher to 
make a choice suited to her purpose. One story for enjoyment, twa} 
for study and dramatization, and one poem memorized each month 
should give a distinctive class repertoire, and opportunities should 
be found in the morning exercise, in the rest period, in assemblies, on 
special occasions for recall of poems and stories already familiar. 
Frequency and recency of recall insure permanent retention of poems 
and stories which are now becoming a part of the child’s literary 
inheritance. 
Time Allotment: Three 15 minute periods or 45 minutes per week.

Third year classes will be held responsible for six of the above poems 
in addition to those memorized in previous grades. One poem of 
each type is required; the teacher and children may select two or 
three others from the required list. 
An average of one poem a month for memorizing is the maximum 
requirement. At the end of the year each child should be able to 
recite three poems learned during the year. 
FOURTH GRADE 
Though much of the reading material in this grade is of a literary 
character, oral work in literature occupies an important place in the 
“school program. Poems and stories presented in previous grades 
should be recalled with pleasure and profit, often with the teacher of 
the previous year present asa guest. By this time each child should 
‘have a repertoire of at least a dozen good stories and poems ready for 
use upon call with a personal interest in each one. 
Longer stories are presented in this grade and an attempt is made 
to have the children realize in a dim way that each great nation had 
its own literature by presenting a group of Greek Stories, Norse 
stories, German and English folk tales, East Indian legends, and’ 
others, not forgetting our own American literature, which expresses 
the national spirit. Only those selections best suited to the needs of 
fourth grade pupils will be presented; this does not necessarily ex- 
clude the best and most suitable material from any source whatso- 
ever. The aim sought is to determine largely what the children will 
read voluntarily, and to lay the foundation for the command of good 
English expression. 
Since this is the period when mechanical results are most easily ob- 
tained, memorizing of the best selections should be greatly em-
-P-A-G-E-57
  54 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
phasized. //The rhythm and imagery of poetry make a strong ap- 
peal to the imagination and memory at this time. As in the pre- 
vious grades the memorizing of longer poems should be done largely 
upon the basis of the unit of thought, and that thought clearly de- 
fined in the minds of the learner. “At least six poems should be learn- 
ed, and many children will learn more with a little encouragement. 
If possible, each pupil should be provided with a printed copy, or a 
poem book in which he may keep a record of all poems presented 
during the year, and illustrate them with simple sketches. 
“Literature, especially poetry, is addressed to the ear,”. . . 
and a faithful rendering is essential to the best results. The teacher 
should be able to read the poem with as good expression as possi- 
ble, keeping it genuine and sincere. This will inspire the class 
with the same sincerity. The purpose of all literature, like all 
art, is to develop appreciation, and the attitude of the teacher de- 
termines the growth and exercise of judgment. 
She needs the help of children to get the spirit of the selection 
through her own contagious enjoyment, through training them to 
grasp readily the meaning through her familiarity of the plan under- 
lying each selection. They must form the habit of getting the main 
points in relation to minor details. Opportunities for varied and 
effective work are clearly defined, as (1) analysis of a story, followed 
by reproduction in parts and as a whole unit; (2) dramatization; 
(3) stories told and read for simple enjoyment. This last does not 
exclude the necessity for any treatment which brings the story nearer 
to their experience. Care should be exercised to preserve genuine- 
ness and sincerity of response to the appeals of both story and poem. 
It should be the child’s own judgment rather than another’s opinion 
which he expresses, and for this reason variety of material through 
which to make appeal is essential. Not all children can like all 
stories and all poems, but all children will like some poems and 
some stories better than others. Train them to be sincere and not 
sentimental. 
For this reason, because experience indicates that children’s in- 
terests are centered in heroic aspects of human life, in the outdoor 
world of nature and animal life, and of the preternatural, stories have 
been chosen with this in mind. -Poems too, should be varied, and 
selections are made which appeal to the many-sided interests; the 
humorous, the narrative poem, the nature lyric, the patriotic selec- 
tion, the imaginative or fanciful poem each has its place. The num- 
ber listed for each month indicates the range from which a choice de- 
termined by the interest and ability of the class may be made. One

  LITERATURE—FOURTH GRADE 55 
story read or told by the teacher for enjoyment, two for study, with 
adequate return from the children in reproduction and often drama- 
tization, and one poem memorized each month should give a distinc- 
tive class repertoire. 
Much illustrative material: sketches at blackboard, pictures, and 
objects—is still essential for clarity. A motive for story telling, and 
for recitation of poems is equally essential, and many activities of the 
school provide the opportunity to the wide-awake teacher. 
Time Allotment: Three 20 minute periods or one hour per week; forty hours during 
the year. 
Note: Since history is delayed until the first of November the time allotted to 
that study will be devoted to the study of the Norse, Greek and Roman Stories.

READING AND LITERATURE: GRAMMAR GRADES 
SOME SUGGESTIONS AS AIDS TO THE TEACHING OF READING AND 
LITERATURE IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES 
Labo thnentay Lofoole 72 3) 
I. Literature: “Literature is art: it is one of the fine arts. We 
set it apart from other arts by the fact that it uses language as its 
medium and we set it apart from other writing by the fact that it 
uses language in the way that art must use it—not for technical 
purposes, not as a medium for teaching facts or doctrines, not to 
give information, but to produce artistic pleasure; not to conserve 
use, but to exhibit esthetic beauty.’’—MacClintock. 
Literature as an art is not understood in the elementary school, as 
it should be, and any discussion that elucidates and emphasizes the 
right principles upon which to base a choice of stories for classroom 
use should be welcomed by the educational world. It is the emotion- 
al element in literature that places it above the sciences and classes it 
with the fine arts. It is most necessary that the right kind of litera- 
ture be given to a child during his various stages of development, to 
meet his needs and tastes and to provide him with vicarious 
experience. 
Chubb says of the child of the fifth and sixth grades: 
His world of men and things is growing wider and more populous; his mental 
grasp is increasing; his memory is more tenacious; he can hold more and more in his 
mind; he is probing more thoroughly into the causal connection of things; he is 
growing in power of observation and discrimination. His world is still the habita- 
tion of the great mythical and shadowy personages of the world’s childhood, but it 
is also becoming peopled with modern heroes of industry and commerce, of the pro- 
fessions and the arts. He is still in what we may call the epic phase, and the longer 
he remains in it the better. 
Adventure and romance, heroisms, and daring, the wonders of excitement of 
travel and exploration, of march and siege, upon these we may feed him, and upon 
these, as sure foundations of the superstructure to be raised in later years, we 
may build. So we shall broaden his world and enlarge his sympathies, and give 
him a many-sided interest in all sorts and conditions of men and women, and in 
various callings and points of view, before he begins that adolescent work of in- 
trospection and self-analysis which tends to contract for a time his interests and 
sympathies. Here is the central epic interest! 
Nature interest will remain and grow apace! Interest in conquests and develop- 
ments of civilization will be increasingly active. 
Lyric impulse will persist and deepen: it is through lyric poetry that we shall 
work for the chastening idealization of those primitive passions of anger, hate, de- 
votion and love into their higher forms of courage, loyalty, obedience and reverence.

-P-A-G-E-63
60 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Purely lyric poetry comes to a child through song—songs sung in the daily as- 
sembly, songs sung in the classroom once or twice a day. It is an expression of 
childhood’s spontaneous power. It should be as natural to take two or three min- 
utes between recitations for a hearty song as for recess or calisthenics. . . 
Use literature as you use all studies—only more powerfully because of its erearer 
emotional appeal—to illuminate and enchance the worth and glory of life and living, 
when training the pupil to the correct and effective use of language as a medium of 
communication: 
1. Interest and delight must accompany all the work done in literature. 
2. It should be done with an air of happy and dignified leisure. 
II. Teaching Literature. Professor Thomas H. Briggs says: 
The general aim of teaching literature, especially poetry, is that the teacher re- 
produce or awaken the emotion that possessed the artist and that through his work 
he is attempting to express. This central emotion, which often has important con- 
comitants, necessarily varies much with the individual; indeed, it is a question 
whether the poem and the story should not be considered merely the stimulus to art, 
which is non-existent until the satisfying reaction of the individual. 
The steps for the teacher to take, more or less consciously, then, are: 
1. He must find and feel the central emotion. 
2. He must decide what large function-he wishes this poem or story to perform 
in the pupils: - 
a. To afford entertainment, thus: 
1. Furnishing vicarious experience; 
2. Breaking monotony; 
3. Potentially raising the standards of taste; 
b. To interpret some phase of life, physical or spiritual. 
c. To prepare for some probable future experience. 
3. He prepares his class when this is necessary, for references or allusions which 
at the reading should contribute, immediately to the emotional reaction. Vocabulary 
usually is better gotten in context as the specific need arises. The teacher may also 
prepare an ‘‘atmosphere”’ for the presentation. 
4, He presents his poem or story. If it is especially difficult or dependent on 
beauty of style or music for its effect, the teacher should certainly read it aloud to 
the class. 
5. He sees that the meaning is understood. This, however, is not an end, but a 
means; on meaning, feeling should in nearly all cases be based. 
6. He tries by various devices to secure emotional response on the part of the 
pupil. These devices should be based usually on the fact that whenever the incident, 
description, or what not in the literature can, it should be interpreted in terms of the 
individual, in so far as he is likely to respond. These devices seek the fullness of 
meaning and suggestion of especially connotative words or phrases or situations; they 
include imaging, dramatizing, and illustrating by modern parallels. 
7. He tries to set up the habit of using what has been studied: to entertain, to 
interpret some new piece of literature or life situation, or to prepare for something 
that is imminent. This frequently involves memorizing, which always should fol- 
low the enjoyment resulting from study. Passages to be memorized should have in 
them some potential and probable future usefulness, such as expressing effectively

a vaguely conceived idea, embodying and thus preserving an ideal, etc.; they should 
be learned as wholes and frequently used.” 
Note: This outline should be constantly varied according to the individual needs 
of the class, teacher, masterpiece, time, and community.” 
III. Reading material for grammar grades: 
1, Material in reader, of which there should be one or more sets kept for class use, 
and distributed, for such purpose only as sight reading, to cultivate agility of mind, 
rapid seizure of thought, and clear, intelligent rendering. These will be pieces of 
minor importance, yet worth knowing, a single reading of which will suffice. 
2. Other more difficult selections from the reader to be read aloud, as a test of 
power of comprehension and emotional responsiveness, after a preliminary silent 
reading and careful consideration. These will be pieces to which more importance 
attaches. 
3. Short poems or pieces to be read at home, silently or aloud (practice reading), 
which have called for some research and annotation, or have had to be memorized. 
These will be the easier ballads and short narrative poems and pieces used for com- 
parative purposes: 
4. A few longer works—novels, or some of Scott’s narrative poems (one for each 
term, perhaps), that are to be read at home in a given time, and then discussed in 
class. 
Fhe works, short, and moderately long, that form the “core” of the course, and 
receive careful treatment or thorough study in the class. 
6. Works read to the class by the teacher which may be a little above the average 
reach of the class, the teacher aiding the interpretation. (See Chubb: The Teach- 
ing of English, pp. 143-144.) 
7. *A graded list of classic stories and modern novels to be used as home and school 
extension reading. 
IV. Kinds of reading: 
1. Silent. * 
2. Oral. 
Seoients * 
The pupil is concerned with silent reading primarily when studying 
his lessons—geography, literature, nature study, etc.; when reading 
books for pleasure; when studying a selection to read to some one else. 
“The open and most inviting field in education today seems to be 
that of silent reading. Although it is the kind of reading done almost 
exclusively after school days, it is given special attention by only an 
occasional teacher, and by him experimentally, for there is little 
agreement as to what should be done in training for this kind of work. 
“Silent reading . . . . rigidly excludes the other elements 
*Note: This Course of Study was printed in 1915. In 1917 the United States entered the great 
world-war. Since the object of this war as avowed by President Wilson is to make the world safe for 
democracy it seems highly expedient that teachers of literature should use some poems and stories 
definitely and consciously to assist children in their understanding of customs and habits of thoughts 
of other nations as well as of our own, and that some of the best war literature be studied. Let it be 
remembered that one of our National ideals should be the understanding of the ideals of the other 
peoples of the world.

which enter into oral reading and the reading of literature. It is 
merely informational. And to read well silently, one must be able to 
read rapidly, to change his pace as the difficulty of the subject- 
matter requires, and be able to summarize with some accuracy what 
he has gone over.” (Briggs.) 
He is concerned with oral reading (a) when the teacher reads to him 
for the purpose of instruction, to supplement his daily studies, or to 
give him pleasure by the presentation of a piece of literary art—in 
either case, he must grasp the thought and form of the material 
quickly and accurately; (b) when he reads aloud to the class from any 
text for the purpose of conveying information, or for the pleasure of 
reading a story or poem (interpreting literature). 
He is concerned with sight reading when he is called upon unex- 
pectedly to read an article upon some topic under discussion, a re- 
ference book, or the scriptures, and in the ordinary reading of news- 
paper articles. 
Sight reading can be both oral and silent. The value of sight read- 
ing is that it “stimulates the pace of the eye and affords practice in 
grasping groups of words that contain units of thought 
When the sight reader finishes the part assigned him, he should be 
asked to give in his own words the sense of the matter. And he 
must be made to feel that, unless he can do this, he has failed, how- 
ever rapidly he has gone. If the sight reading be oral, he must get 
the sense himself and also cause his hearer to getit... . . The 
primary aim is that he shall form the habit of sending the eye for- 
ward regularly to report new groups of words while the mind is com- 
prehending and the mouth reporting what the eye has passed over.” 
V. The purposes of reading are: 
1. To get thought from the printed page; 
2. To give pleasure to others; 
3. To get pleasure for one’s self. 
VI. Difficulties: 
1. New words; 
2. Familiar words in unfamiliar meaning; 
3. Phrases that are puzzling; 
4. Unfamiliar idioms; 
5. Regular sentences, regular in form, but of complicated struc-

environment;

READING AND LITERATURE—GRAMMAR GRADES 63 
7. Now and then acts that are incomprehensible to the child; 
8. Situations and conduct that challenge and bewilder the child’s 
ethical judgment. 
These must be overcome, and this can be done only by having 
reading preparation periods. 
VII. Reading preparation periods: 
The nature of this period is two-fold, consisting of (1) silent study- 
reading assignments mainly for interpretation and appreciation; and 
(2) formal exercises. 
1. The assignment for study: “Here the definiteness and skill of 
the teacher’s questions should tend to awaken curosity and interest 
in the work; to give the class a glimpse of the pleasure that awaits it 
in the final study; and to pave the way to an easier mastery of the 
verbal difficulties, the new and difficult words, and of obscure and 
involved passages.”’ The following are suggestive procedures: 
READING PROCEDURES Procedure I: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. Precedes the recitation period. 
Thought-provoking questions are given by the teacher and the 
pupils must search through the text for the answers. Interpre- 
tation is the basal idea. 
b. Recitation Period. This is a discussion period which tests 
what was done in the study period. Misconceptions are cleared 
up and new ideas developed. 
Procedure IT: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. (Same as I-a.) 
b. Recitation Period. All books are closed, except that of the 
pupil who is called on to read. The reading is followed by a class 
criticism, the standards for criticism being definitely known by 
each child. 
Procedure III: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. Each child reads a different book 
or story, and prepares to read to the class the most interesting 
incident in his story. He must be able to give a brief synopsis 
of the events preceding and succeeding his chosen incident. 
b. Recitation Period. One child at a time, reads. Class 
criticises and discusses. (There should be a.card catalogue of all 
the stories read and of all the books handled. Each child should 
make an individual card catalogue of the books he would like to 
read.) :
-P-A-G-E-67
  64 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Procedure IV: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. Each child, with a book chosen 
either by himself or the teacher, studies to make a written report 
of his opinion of the story. He also writes a brief synopsis of the 
story. 
b. Recitation Period. ‘Teacher aes only with the pupils who 
are poor readers. 
Procedure V: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. Choosing and studying a story to 
read to a lower grade class or at a school assembly. The choice of 
the pupils who are to read is made by the class, not the teacher. 
This study period could also be an impromptu dramatization, the 
pupils working in groups upon the different scenes or acts. 
b. Recitation Period. Choosing the pupils to read. They give 
specimen readings of the story. (The class makes the choice.) 
Procedure VI: 
a. Study or Silent Reading. The pupils read and make thought- 
provoking questions. 
b. Recitation Period. They ask their questions and call upon 
other pupils to answer and, after searching the text, these other 
pupils use, as far as possible, the words of the text in their answers. 
Class discussion follows. 
The following definite silent-study-and-discussion plan is based 
upon the story of Baldur, pp. 165-169 in the Stepping Stones to 
Literature Reader for the fifth grade and was worked out in class- 
room by Miss Miriam Van Sant of the Catonsville High School:

III. PROCEDURE IN THE READING LESSON 
The children studied the assignment, consulting with each other when necessary, 
about the meaning of phrases, or words, and the answers to the questions. 
When we took up the lesson they asked their questions first, answering each other 
when possible. Their questions brought out the primitive character of the Norse 
people and the fact that gods never really existed, but that the people themselves 
invented them and then stories about them to explain natural phenomena. 
The children then answered the questions in the reading assignment, reading pas- 
sages from the story, and occasionally from the poem, to prove a point in their dis- 
cussion. 
They compared the gods in Scandinavia with the Greek and Roman gods with 
which they were already familiar. 
They said that since the sun went away from these people for such a long time, 
when it came to them in the summer season naturally they loved it because it gave 
them light and heat and made things grow. - 
The class had been much interested in the Land of the Midnight Sun, and the 
pupils had very little trouble in deciding that probably these people wondered where 
the sun had gone when it left them, so they made up this story about it to answer 
their own queries. Some of the pupils reasoned this out from the story of Proser- 
pine too, which gives the symbolism for winter and summer. Again the class de- 
cided that the Norsemen must have seen something to make them believe that Baldur 
was burned, and one child said that since this is the Land of the Midnight Sun, which 
has the aurora borealis or northern lights, these lights might have been the origin of 
the funeral pyre. The class pretty generally conceded this. 
From the belief of Odin that Baldur must die because the fate was spun for him, 
the children drew the inference that the Scandinavians must have believed in fate 
rather than man’s power to shape his own life. 
This grade has become interested in poetry, so they decided that they wanted to 
read the poem next (pp. 169-176); and then classified it as a story-telling or epic 
pec: These boys and girls are quite proud, by the way, of knowing an epic froma 
lyric poem. 
By the time we had finished discussing the questions and the assignment ques- 
tions, much of the story had been read incidentally. Then I called on several mem- 
bers of the class to read the story through, in parts, each child reading a scene or some 
organized unit of literary thought. 
What had we really accomplished? The pupils had read the lesson through 
silently. Then they had proceeded to study it through thought-provoking ques- 
tions. As they studied, through their own initiative they thought out questions. 
Then in class recitation time with the results of their study before them, they dis- 
cussed the lesson with the teacher. This led to challenging, one pupil making anoth- 
er prove his point by reading from the text-book, until much of the story was read 
orally, though not in the sequence of the text. Then to synthesize the whole mat- 
ter when the discussion was finished, the story was read orally, and we trust with more 
appreciation of its beauty and literary value than could possibly have been the case 
had there been no intensive study in the silent reading period. 
2. Formal exercises: Continue to give special lessons (a) for in- 
terpreting diacritical marks, (b) for getting the meaning of difficult 
words through the context, (c) in the use of the dictionary for the 
meaning of new words and for discriminating between the several 
definitions of individual words. Both teacher and child should get 
the dictionary habit. If the children do not understand diacritical 
markings and the phonetic laws, teach these through frequent drills,

“To be ‘well spoken’ is still a strong point in a man’s favor in many 
walks of life. The pleasant voice and delivery, the breeding im- 
plied in correct speech, the evidence of character and culture in the 
touch of distinction in the vocabulary, the power of graphic descrip- 
tion and narration, these things have sometimes even commercial 
value; while, ability to read and write agreeably, to debate and argue 
effectively is almost everywhere a valuable asset, and in certain 
callings—political, ministerial, legal—an indispensable condition of 
success.”

VIII. Dramatics. 
The following suggestions for dramatization and the use of the dra- 
matic instinct of the grammar grade child are taken from Briggs and 
Coffman, Reading in the Public Schools, pp. 233-261: 
As has been shown earlier in the book, dramatic presentation of the reading material 
in the primary grades is in many ways exceedingly helpful. Strangely enough, 
teachers often, after that point, stifle the dramatic instinct of children until the high 
school undertakes to present a “sure enough” play at the opera house. No wonder 
that often becomes drudgery! ° 
It has seemed wise, however, in many schools to continue the dramatic element 
of the reading lesson, somewhat modified perhaps, straight through the grades. In 
cases where this is done, there is a unanimous and enthusiastic opinion that it is well 
worth while. It has also been undertaken with profit in the upper grades of schools 
where no dramatic work at all, or practically none, has preceded. In this latter 
case, however, it has to be initiated very carefully, or the already too self-conscious 
upper-grade child will flatly rebel at what he considers foolishness. 
1. Advantages: Taken so simply as this, dramatic work differs little from the ordi- 
nary class reading, except that it is apt to inspire much more interest and lead to a 
keener insight. It also gives the child something definite to do in that usually most 
indefinite of things, the preparation of the reading lesson. When practicable, chil- 
dren should be given some place about the school house, where, singly or in groups, 
they may rehearse orally their interpretation of the reading lesson. Some children, 
it is objected, cannot be trusted to study out of sight of the teacher. It is equally 
true, however, that some children should be so trusted—and held to account for re- 
sults. After the novelty wears off, the right kind of encouragement and pressure will 
bring results. 
2. Interpretative vs. Imitative: This so-called dramatic reading should be inter- 
pretative and suggestive, rather than imitative. It is better for the pupil, by his 
reading and slight acting, to make the auditors imagine how the character looked 
than it is to look the part himself. Of the two extremes, it seems wiser to err on this 
side than to overdo the matter of imitation; though some teachers think otherwise, 
holding that eventually much of the exaggeration will fall away or be more wisely 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
READING AND LITERATURE—GRAMMAR GRADES 67 
used. But most oral reading in life will be of the suggestive kind, which, indeed, is 
harder to do perfectly than acting. 
3. Justification: Much of the success of this kind of reading depends upon the 
teacher’s attitude toward it. It should be taken as a matter of course, undue pre- 
paration tending to make the children too conscious of themselves for the best re- 
sults. It should be taken seriously, too, though not funereally. There are al- 
ways children in all grades beyond the primary who are ready to giggle at and make 
a joke of anything unusual. If they are permitted to attempt simple dramatization 
in this spirit, they not only can accomplish nothing themselves, but they also pre- 
vent the other children from entering easily into the land of make-believe. When 
there is anything amusing in the dramatic work, the laugh will come, and of course 
should come; but it is joyous laughter, with the actor, in harmony with what he is 
saying or doing, not the miserable, withering laugh of ridicule, which usually comes 
from those who are themselves most impotent. It is a shameful thing when it is 
permitted to prevent or to hinder honest effort of any kind. Yet a teacher who fails 
to get the point of view of the child that is reciting sometimes not only permits it 
but even joins in such laughter himself. If the teacher is unable to get into the spirit 
of the reading, if he does not really enjoy the dramatic presentation of the lesson, pro- 
bably he would better not attempt it at all. 
4, Public performances: When it is desirable, as it sometimes is, to give a real 
play with costumes, stage, and an audience of townspeople, nothing is more essential 
than a strong feeling of interest, and a desire on the part of most of the children to 
undertake the work. It may be that the proper spirit is already in the class; it may 
be that it can be aroused merely by the novelty, its attendant excitement, and the 
desire for display, which is strong in many children. Sometimes the idea of being 
dressed-up in costume is the needed stimulus. Few things are so effective, however, 
as the knowledge that other and older students have given successful plays. Some 
one who has taken part in a high school or a college play, or who has seen one, can 
often, by telling of it, give the needed stimulus, especially if the pictures of the scenes 
and cast in costume are shown. Many schools have souvenir books of their plays, 
which can be bought or borrowed for this purpose. 
5. The selection of a play: The selection of a good play—a play that is interest- 
ing, clean, of the proper subject and length, demanding such proportion of boys and 
girls as the class affords, and interesting—is sometimes an insuperable obstacle. 
Good plays of any kind are hard to find, and the selection of a school play is hedged 
about with many requirements.

IX. Scientific testing and standard scores for efficiency in 
reading: 
“It is obvious that educational science and educational practice alike need more 
objective, more accurate and more convenient measures of— 
(1) a pupil’s ability to pronounce words and sentences seen; 
(2) a pupil’s ability to understand the meaning of words and sentences seen; 
(3) a pupil’s ability to appreciate and enjoy what we roughly call good literature; 
(4) a pupil’s ability to read orally, clearly and effectively. 
Any progress toward measuring how well a child can read with something of the 
objectivity, precision, commensurability, and convenience which characterize our
-P-A-G-E-71
  : 68 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
measurements of how tall he is, how much he can lift with his back or squeeze with 
his hand, or how acute his vision is, would be of great help in grading, promoting, 
testing the value of methods of teaching, and in every other case where we need to 
know ourselves how well an individual, or a class, or a school population can read.‘’ 
—Thorndike. 
The tremendous range of individual variation [in the rate of reading and power to 
understand what is read] is proof that in the teaching of reading the school at present 
has little control over the product. 
The primary value of standard scores [will be to let each child grow in his own 
way and progress at his own rate toward the goal of efficiency in reading]. They 
also serve the teacher as a guide in the assignment of lessons. It is a simple matter 
to estimate by means of the number of words in a line and the number of lines on a 
page the length of time it will take to read over once a passage in a textbook. 
Reading and reference lessons are too often assigned without regard to the time 
required to read the material over thoroughly, with the result that children are 
soon confirmed in the habit of hasty reading without assimilation. Teachers every- 
where, following the general method of this study, should determine the average 
rate of reading of their classes in the various types of textbooks used by their pupils 
and assign all reference reading with such standard rates in mind. 
For the benefit of those who have not given the matter thought heretofore, the 
following objective standards are suggested, as those now available for practical 
school work: 
A child in Grade IV, V, VI, VII, VIII should be able to read simple prose at the 
rate of 160, 180, 220, 250, 280 words per minute respectively and to be able to re- 
produce 50 per cent of the ideas in a 400-word passage after one reading.”—S. A. 
Courtis. 
X. Reading errors: Thorndike indicates and enumerates the 
reading errors in the following selection. The list seems to be com- 
prehensive but may not be exhaustive; the teacher should add to it 
other types of errors she may note in the reading of her pupils: 
In order to illustrate clearly the character of errors considered and the method 
of recording them the following paragraph is presented: 
The sun pier’ced into sie large windows. It was the op(e)ning of October, and 
the CIE" gky was (ofa dazzling blue. I looked out of the window (and) down the 
street. The white house(s) of the long st(r)aight streets were (al)most painful to 
the eyes. The clear atmosphere allowed full play to the sun’s brightness. 
List of errors: 
“Pier’ced””—dividing a one-syllable word into two syllables. 
“My” “many”—an error made by substitution. 
“Op(@ning”—omitting a letter, poor enunciation. 
“Clear’’—adding a word. 
“of? 
“and” 
“dazzling” —pronouncing long “a” for short “‘a.” 
“house(s)”—leaving off a final letter. 
“st(paight”—omitting a letter. 
“al”—omitting a syllable. | omitting a word.
-P-A-G-E-72
READING AND LITERATURE—-GRAMMAR GRADES 69 
“atmosphere’’—by a gross mispronunciation. 
“allowed”—pronouncing long “6” for the “o” as in “out.”

XI. Readers for the grade: 
It is not likely that any of the many existing readers will be en- 
tirely satisfactory to the teacher who is trying to live up to a high 
standard of literary subject matter. Therefore selections should 
be chosen from the reader, some selections rejected altogether, and 
the rest classified according to seasonal interests, informational in- 
terests like geography and history, and purely literary interests. It 
will be seen at once that there must be supplementary reading. 
XII. Home and school extension reading: 
“There are always some girls and boys, especially boys, who do 
not care for reading, and there are others who become so infatuated 
by. books that they read everything that they can procure. If this 
reading leaves its mark in subtle manner—and one can hardly doubt 
that it does—it is certainly the part of wisdom to direct it as care- 
fully as possible. . . 
“One giving advice must find | out first of all what lines the child’s 
interest follows; then he must know what books will satisfy or direct 
that interest; and finally he must learn how to accomplish the sub- 
stitution with some tact.” 
Stanley Hall says: 
“Throughout the teens . . . . books were chosen 
because recommended, and later because of some special interest. 
Girls relied on recommendations more than boys. The latter were 
more guided by reason and the former by sentiment. Nearly three 
times as many boys in the early teens chose books because they 
were exciting or venturesome....Girls chosebooks more than four 
times as often because of children in them, and more often because 
they were funny. Boys care very little for style, but must have  
-P-A-G-E-73
  70 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
incidents and heroes. . . . . Girls prefer domestic stories 
and those with characters like themselves and scenes more like those 
with which they are familiar.” 
We have carefully prepared graded lists of books to meet this need 
of more extensive and varied reading than the texts for the grade 
provide. The child who does not like to read must be encouraged 
to read; the child who reads too much and without discrimination 
must have his habit directed by tactful suggestion; the child who is 
constantly reading but never knows what he has read must be help- 
ed to read more intelligently; the child who reads too many novels 
must be led to an interest in other kinds of literature if his intellect 
is to be strengthened. 
Because of all these conditions which prevail in all groups of chil- 
dren, we have established a system of credits for extra reading of the 
right kind; five books from our ‘Home and School” list, or from any 
list approved by the teacher, read each half-year, entitles the child 
to an extra credit in one of the English subjects: reading, literature, 
or composition—according to the best use to which he puts the read- 
ing. But the extra credit is not given until the child has handed in 
to the teacher a satisfactory written report of each book as it is read; 
for this purpose we have outlined such a report. The same outline 
is used for all the grades, but a fifth grade report would, of course, be 
very much simpler than that of an eighth grade child. Both the 
lists and suggested outlines for the report are printed in the courses 
for the different grades.

FIFTH GRADE 
I. The intermediate and grammar grade period of the child’s develop- 
ment. ‘Ineachofthese nascent periods important physical and men- 
tal changesareoccurringinthechild. Duringthe intermediate period
-P-A-G-E-74
  READING AND LITERATURE—FIFTH GRADE 7 
the brain assumes its normal size, the sensation-centers are knitted 
together, and the nerve-connections increase in number and func- 
tion. Compared with the preceding period, it is characterized by 
relatively slow growth, and yet there is an abundance of ‘excess’ 
energy. The period is formative in the sense that the wandering, in- 
voluntary, passive attention tends to give way, under proper guid- 
ance, to the definite, active, voluntary attention, and in the sense 
that moral habits, habits of honor, and those referring to the com- 
moner virtues, as well as habits of study, receive an impetus or trend 
that likely leads to their fixation.” 
II. Characteristics of the period. 
“The child at this time in his life, has great powers of endurance. 
It is the time for storing reserve energy. Although his conduct and 
character are variable and inconstant, they are greatly influenced by 
pressure. In referring to this period, President Hall says: 
“Never again will there be such susceptibility to drill and discip- 
line, such plasticity to habituation or such ready adjustment to 
new conditions. It is the age of external and mechanical training. 
Reading, writing, drawing, manual training, musical technique, 
foreign tongues and their pronunciations, the manipulation of num- 
bers and of geometrical elements, and many kinds of skill, have now 
their golden hour, and if it passes unimproved, all these can never be 
acquired later without a heavy handicap of disadvantage and loss. 
The method should be mechanical, repetitive, authoritative, dog- 
matic. The automatic powers are now at their very apex, and they. 
can do and bear more than our degenerate pedagogy knows or dreams 
of.” 
“During the primary grades, imitation and example are prominent; 
during the intermediate grades, authority and precept are prominent. 
This does not mean that all the material given the child is or must 
be intrinsically uninteresting. Quite the contrary is true; it ought 
to be all the more interesting; but unless the child finds it so, he must 
be required to master enough of the rudiments of the subject to fur- 
nish a basis for interest. When he has no will, it must be supplied by 
his experienced teacher and parent.” 
III. Aims in training. 
“As more than three-fourths of all.our experiences function as 
habit, we readily recognize the extreme importance of fully utilizing 
this period. The mind must be stored with subject-matter, although 
the memory is not yet highly associative. Whatever impressions are 
received should be deepened by repetitions. All drillsubjectsand drill
-P-A-G-E-75
  72 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
phases of other subjects should be rendered as nearly automatic as 
possible. The mechanics of reading begun in the preceding grades 
must now be made habitual. The child must now acquire the dic- 
tionary habit, the skills used in articulation and pronunciation, the 
proper emotional response to the different kinds of reading material; 
and an abundance of worthy literary selections should be committed.” 
(See Briggs and Coffman, pp. 140-141.) 
NoTE: Read carefully “Suggestions for the teaching of reading and 
literature in the Grammar Grades,” pp. 59-70. 
Text: (Arranged in the order of their difficulty). 
The following order of use of basal texts for the grade is meant 
in no wise to be arbitrary. Since most of our County schools have on 
hand sets of the Stepping Stones to Literature, the aim should be to 
use the literary material these readers contain, to the best advantage, 
but teachers are free to discard the didactic material because ample 
opportunity is provided for the reading of such material in the other 
subjects of the day’s program: history, geography, hygiene, indus- 
trial arts. If a teacher prefers to select for the first reading text 
in this grade either Favorite Greek Myths or the Riverside Fifth Reader, 
or a set of books from the office that may be simpler than either of 
these, she is free todo so. But since Robin Hood presents greater 
difficulties than either of the other texts listed, it seems advisable 
that she should not undertake it until the second semester of the year. 
A wise teacher will “‘bait’’ the reading appetite and reading effort 
of her class by holding out to her pupils as a reward for achievement, 
the reading of Robin Hood as soon as they have made an effort to 
reach the reading standard for the first half-year’s work. 
1. Riverside Fifth Reader. 
2. Stepping Stones to Literature. A Fifth Reader. (Read all the readable stories 
except the King of the Golden River; reserve that for the Sixth Grade.)

SIXTH GRADE 
I. Theintermediate and grammar grade period of the child’s development. 
In each of these nascent periods important physical and mental changes are occur- 
ring in the child. During the intermediate period the brain assumes its normal size, 
the sensation-centers are knitted together, and the nerve-connections increase in 
number and function. Compared with the preceding period, it is characterized by 
relatively slow growth, and yet there is an abundance of “excess” energy. The 
period is formative in the sense that the wandering, involuntary, passive attention 
tends to give way, under proper guidance, to the definite, active, voluntary atten- 
tion, and in the sense that moral habits, habits of honor, and those referring to the 
commoner virtues, as well as habits of study, receive an impetus or trend that likely 
leads to their fixation. 
II. Characteristics of the period. 
The child at this time in his life, has great powers of endurance. It is the time for 
storing reserve energy. Although his conduct and character are variable and in-
-P-A-G-E-78
READING AND LITERATURE—SIXTH GRADE 75 
constant, they are greatly influenced by pressure. In referring to this period, Presi- 
dent Hall says: 
Never again will there be such susceptibility to drill and discipline, such plasticity 
to habituation, or such ready adjustment to new conditions. It is the age of external 
and mechanical training. Reading, writing, drawing, manual training, musical 
technique, foreign tongues and their pronunciation, the manipulation of numbers 
and of geometrical elements, and many kinds of skill, have now their golden hour, 
and if it passes unimproved, all these can never be acquired later without a heavy 
handicap of disadvantage and loss. The method should be mechanical, repetitive, 
authoritative, dogmatic. The automatic powers are now at their very apex, and 
they can do and bear more than our degenerate pedagogy knows or dreams of, 
During the primary grades, imitation and example are prominent; during the in- 
termediate grades, authority or precept are prominent. This does not mean that all the 
material given the child is or must be intrinsically uninteresting. Quite the contrary 
is true: it ought to be all the more interesting; but unless the child finds it so, he must 
be required to master enough of the rudiments of the subject to furnish a basis for 
interest. When he has no will, it must be supplied by his experienced teacher and 
parent. 
III. Aims in training. 
As more than three-fourths of all our experiences function as habit, we readily 
‘recognize the extreme importance of fully utilizing this period. The mind must be 
stored with subject-matter, although the memory is not yet highly associative. 
Whatever impressions are received should be deepened by repetitions. All drill 
subjects and drill phases of other subjects should be rendered as nearly automatic as 
possible. The mechanics of reading begun in the preceding grades must now be made 
habitual. The child must now acquire the dictionary habit, the skills used in ar- 
ticulation and pronunciation, the proper emotional response to the different kinds of 
reading material; and an abundance of worthy literary selections should be committed 
IV. Physical and spiritual changes. 
The physical disturbances occurring during the grammar period and immediately 
following it are shown in the increase in size and in height. There is an enlargement 
and functioning of all the organs, an elongation of the vocal cord, increase in the 
volume of the heart, etc. The whole system is undergoing a change. Nervous cen- 
ters, glands, voluntary and involuntary muscles—everything is affected. There is 
an influx of new sensations—the mind fills with hopes, dreams, tempestuous passions, 
and new ideas. The spirit of independence is germinating, egoism is giving way to 
altruism, social impulses are becoming dominant, and the reasoning powers are 
coming into use. The very worst things are liable to happen at this time of greatest 
of dangers. Ideals are now in the process of formation, and they may be either high 
or low. 
V. Extent and character of reading. 
An increased interest in reading is characteristic of this period. The first impulse 
to greater interest in reading comes at the eighth year; it increases steadily to twelve 
years, and then takes a rapid rise to fourteen, reaching its height at fifteen. An in- 
vestigation of books used by boys shows that they use books of travel, adventure, and 
biography; while girls prefer fiction. The thirst at this time must be satisfied and 
parents and teachers can well afford to spend much time and thought upon the selec-
-P-A-G-E-79
76 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
tion of reading material for so important a period. The material selected should pre- 
sent a wholesome phase of life, should be good literature, and should be adapted to the 
age of development of the children. 
The longer and more complex literary master-pieces, given as complete selections, 
should be used now for study. The time has come when much home study and col- 
lateral reading may be required and when children may be permitted and encouraged 
to read along lines in which they are specially interested.—Briggs and Coffman. 
Note: Read carefully, “Suggestions for the teaching of reading and literature in 
the grammar grades,” pp. 59-70. 
Text: (Arranged in the order of their difficulty). 
The following order of use of basal texts for the grade is meant in 
no wise to be arbitrary. If a teacher prefers to select for the first 
reading text in this grade either of the texts listed or a set of books 
from the office that may be simpler than either of these, she is free 
todoso. . But since Hiawatha presents greater difficulties than eith- 
er of the other texts it seems advisable that she should not undertake 
it until the second semester of the year. A wise teacher will ‘‘bait’”’ 
the reading appetite and reading effort of her class by holding out 
to her pupils as a reward for achievement the reading of some special 
book as soon as they have made an effort to reach the reading stand- 
ard for the first half-year’s work.

biography; while girls prefer fiction. The thirst at this time must be satisfied and 
parents and teachers can well afford to spend much time and thought upon the selec- 
tion of reading material for so important a period. The material selected should 
present a wholesome phase of life, should be good literature, and should be adapted 
to the age of development of the children. 
The longer and more complex literary master-pjeces, given as complete selections, 
should be used now for study. The time has come when much home study and col- 
lateral reading may be required and when children may be permitted and encouraged 
to read along lines in which they are specially interested.—(Briggs and Coffman.)

COMPOSITION: PRIMARY GRADES* 
It is desirable to acquire skill in the ability to express ideas ade- 
quately in effective words and the chief agency in securing such mas- 
tery is the school. The work in social relations, in nature, and lit- 
erature furnish opportunity for the acquisition of an abundance of 
ideas, and the most effective tool for their transference is the mother 
tongue aided by the various expressive activities, drawing, music, . 
rhythmic plays, and games. ‘All effort toward expression is, in a 
broad sense, composition. Hence the term includes the fragmentary 
and informal expressions heard throughout a school-day, as well as 
the more complete treatment of a topic. Oral composition deserves 
more attention than written and should be measured by standards 
equally high. Neither oral nor written language should lag behind 
the child’s needs and at all times should contribute t@ his intel- 
lectual growth.” ~ 
I. Aims: 
1. It is of first importance . . . “to make the free expression 
of ideas a pleasure to the children,” since self-expression through 
some form of activity is the natural outlet of energy. 
2. Intelligent work depends upon the clear understanding of the 
intimate relationship of language and ideas. Recognition of the 
thought process demands development of ideas and orderly habits of 
thinking; recognition of the language process demands that ease, ac- 
curacy, and adequacy of expression shall be secured through the 
correct and effective use of the mother tongue. 
3. Training in the habit of thinking is important. 
“The habit of thinking is worth a thousand thoughts.”’ The little 
child’s speech is halting and stumbling, often because he does not 
yet know how to handle the tools by: which to make himself under- 
stood. It may also be because the thought has not been clearly com- 
prehended. Sometimes the attempt to express the idea helps to 
clear up the muddy thinking that lies behind it, therefore, two dis- 
tinct facts are to be kept in mind: (1) that clear thinking is an aid to 
*Considerable material and many of the ideas in this section have been drawn 
from The Elementary Course in English by Professor James Fleming Hosic, Head of 
the Department of English, Chicago Normal College. Unless otherwise indicated, 
all quoted material in the outline for Grades I to IV has been taken from Professor 
Hosic’s Course. 
(83)
-P-A-G-E-87
  84 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
definite expression, and (2) that attempts at expression tend to clear 
thinking. One aids and abets the other. 
4. It is essential that the child be helped to overcome his special 
faults. He must have a vocabulary sufficiently large to meet the 
demands of everyday life. To speak correctly he must be trained 
not only in grammatical usage, but also to recognize the finer dis- 
tinctions which literature unconsciously conveys. 
Certain principles contributing to successful attainment of results 
should be clearly defined: . 
' 1, “Language development is specific and individual, and exer- 
cises should arise out of typical and natural situations in answer to 
a felt need” recognized by the children as worth while. Making 
rational use of the instincts of imagination, curiosity, competition, 
and collection, the work of the primary grades can, for the most 
part, be kept jo: jgyous, spontaneous, and sincere—all elements neces- 
ae to sugcess. 
2. “Language is learned largely by unconscious imitation.” The 
child absorbs from all about him—his home, his classmates, his books. 
“The strongest school influence is that of the group to which the 
child belongs. The teacher’s task is largely concerned in helping the 
children to train each other.” The teacher sets the ideal of correct 
expression through her own use of English, through corrections 
of errors, through literature which aids in lifting language above 
the colloquial level. 
38. “Practice in correct usage is the only means by which correct 
habits are formed.”’ ‘Habits of order and construction are gained 
largely by the teacher’s presentation, questions, and directions.” 
4. “The use of good English is a habit,” and is secured only by 
intelligent, eager, long-continued practice under guidance and criti- 
cism. ‘The combined influence of the home and community often 
exceeds that of the school’ and is often detrimental to growth. Poor 
English habits established at an early age can be overcome only by 
persistent effort in establishing right reactions within simple limits, 
and creating a desire to attain a worthy ideal. 
5. “Language is made up of forms,” and some study of form in 
relation to the thought expressed is educative. Facts and princi- 
ples of composition should be taught through use and when they are 
needed for use. There should be simple discussion when need 
arises, and as the child advances through the grades, he should be 
trained to make simple generalizations, applying the points of 
technique covered in the discussion. Knowledge once gained 
should never be allowed to fall into disuse.
-P-A-G-E-88
  COMPOSITION—PRIMARY GRADES 85 
6. Sincerity is essential. Originality springs from first-hand ~ 
observations and imagination under careful guidance. Three points 
are worthy of consideration: first, truthfulness; second, correctness; 
third, artistic form. 
7. Motives for expression should be provided, for children are in- 
terested in self-expressiog tending to intellectual growth only when 
the purpose for its creation seems adequate. ‘These may be included 
under two heads: 
(a) a desire to give pleasure and profit to others. 
(b) the pleasure which creation for its own sake brings. 
8. More perhaps than in any other subject, training in English is 
dependent upon the whole life and atmosphere of the school, upon 
clearly recognizing the fact that every exercise is an exercise in Eng- 
lish; dependent, too, upon the teacher’s personality, upon her sym- 
pathetic understanding of child-nature, upon her full realization of 
the fact that imitation and habit are of prime importance and that 
every hour of school life modifies the ideals of spoken and written 
English of children. 
II. Materials and method: 
Sources of material: 
(1) Children’s experiences, at home and at school, because of real 
and absorbing interest to them. 
(2) The observations and experiences of others recorded in books, 
supplementing children’s experiences. - 
(3) Stories and poems in literature. 
(4) Events in history and geography, the selection and treatment 
being determined by the age and interests of children. 
(5) Pictures. 
Types of expression: 
(1) Conversation. Informal discussions of children’s experiences 
at home and at school. 
(2) The recitation, including the summaries of lessons. 
(3) Original compositions. 
(4) Story telling and recitation of poems memorized. Strictly 
speaking these belong to literature, but_since they are a form of 
expression may be included here. 
(6) Dramatization. 
Technique: 
As children talk or write, criticism of oral and written language i is 
given to the individual and to the group. Drill should be given in 
the correction of errors through the medium of games, and simple 
exercises closely related to the difficulty discovered in individual
-P-A-G-E-89
  
86 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
compositions. Punctuation, spelling, and other elements of tech- 
nique should be emphasized according to the children’s ability to 
comprehend their use. 
ORAL COMPOSITION 
For the reason that we make use of the fnother tongue in speech 
more than in writing and because an individual’s degree of education 
and culture is judged by his speech more often than in any other way 
it is essential that spoken ish in oral composition be emphasized. 
Oral com; mn many recognized values. It conduces to 
clear thinking and fluency of speech. It necessitates an increase in 
the vocabulary, and gives the individual confidence in his ability to 
make his thoughts known. It is the common medium of expression 
in practical use in everyday life, in social and business intercourse. 
None of us leads a Robinson Crusoe existence. And have we not 
heard again and again that social and business success depends upon 
- one’s ability to talk well? Who has not envied the person who has 
the gift to express himself well at a moment’s notice? To talk well on 
one’s feet is no idle accomplishment. Written English is applied by 
most of us in the occasional letter, whereas we speak a hundred 
times for every time we write, yet our practice has been to make 
use of oral work much as a hasty, ill-prepared, short-cut step to 
written work, which has always seemed more important, because 
more tangible. Systematic, intelligent, persistent means should be 
used to train children in good oral English habits. 
Specifically our aim is to train children to talk correctly, fluently 
and agreeably. The child learns to talk correctly by talking cor- 
rectly under careful direction, as he learns to read by reading, to 
walk by walking, and to write by writing. The school is the labora- 
tory in which experiments are made and while often the good work of 
the laboratory is checked by undue influences from the outside, it is 
effective in establishing workable ideals through practice rather than 
precept. Children talk when they have something to say, something 
to communicate to others that seems to them worth while, when the 
social situation is maintained; in short: something to say, a motive 
for saying it, and some™interested listener. The teacher should 
insist that each child shall stand erect, in natural position, using 
dramatic or graphic expression if necessary to make the point more 
effective. The child should face the class audience for whom the 
contribution is intended. The inspiration of an audience is essential 
to success, and the child should be trained to realize that the audience 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  
COMPOSITION—PRIMARY GRADES 87 
situation involves two factors—the speaker and the listener. An 
attentive listener is important as well as an interesting, forceful 
speaker. 
Conversations—Activities by which the school may provide 
for training in expression. 
Class room conversations are based upon the varying interests of 
children; observations of life about them, experiences, personal and 
vicarious, which, in terms of the school curriculum, may be geo- 
graphy, history, nature, industrial arts, or literature. These may be 
stories of pets and playthings, or other narratives of incidents, real 
and imaginative. The first oral compositions are class efforts, each 
pupil contributing to the whole. An oral summary of the whole 
unit is then given by two or more children and a record made by 
the teacher as the pupils talk. This record may be used as a basis 
for discussion of correctness in technique, or as a reading lesson. 
With very little children, the record may result in a single com- 
plete sentence, in response to a teacher’s question, gradually increas- 
ing to several simple coherent sentences and representing a sequence 
of thought. The first duty is to take the child where he is, to make 
use of his interests, and to encourage him to express these interests. 
These interests may be enlarged by increasing the experience through 
observation, and through reading and literature. © 
Time should not be wasted, upon aimless, haphazard talk. The 
channels of conversation should, even with little children, be deter- 
mined or guided by the teacher, but the stream of thought should 
flow unimpeded by too much criticism. The wise teacher guards 
against too much repression, neither does she permit freedom to 
degenerate into slovenly expression, indistinct utterance, and un- 
interesting detail. There is attempt at organization through a 
definite plan, worked out by both teacher and children. 
Some such plan as follows is in the mind of every teacher who holds 
the oral composition in respect equal with the written: 
1. Get the pupils to talk freely while standing, before making any 
attempt at correct or formal instruction. 
2. Teach the pupils how to introduce-a story in a way that will 
arouse interest, curiosity, and expectation on the part of the audience. 
This will eliminate the mechanical device for securing a good intro- 
duction by including in the opening sentence some “‘hint’’ of the 
time, place, characters, and the plot. 
3. Train the pupils to group their thoughts around a single phase 
of a subject in order that the theme, if it can be called by so dignified
-P-A-G-E-91
88 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
a name, may have unity. This is what Sheridan in Speaking and 
Writing English calls the “single phase idea.” 
4. Teach the pupils to express their thoughts in natural sequence. 
5. Teach the pupils to close their themes when they have finished 
what they had to say on the topic making the ending such as will 
leave the best impression on the audience. . 
6. Train the pupils to listen and to make helpful criticism. This 
can be done effectively by working for the correction of one phase 
of technique during a recitation period. 
The Recitation: 
The recitation in any school subject affords the opportunity not 
only to teach the content of that subject, but also to test the results 
of instruction in habits of orderly thinking, and the gain in ease and 
fluency of expression. With smaller children, there cannot be what 
is termed a topical recitation, but as the points are made by different 
members of the class, in response to the teacher’s questions, these 
points, should be summarized by one or more members of the class, 
so that the complete unit of thought stands out clearly in the minds 
of the hearers. A clear concept in the teacher’s mind eventually 
develops the same clarity in the children’s minds. It is needless 
to add that oral composition should precede all written work, but 
it is necessary to say that every recitation is an opportunity for oral 
composition. ye 
Criticism and Correction: 
When once a child has something to say, with the motive suffi- 
ciently strong to impel its expression and sufficient self-confidence 
has been established, criticism of oral composition may be made 
judiciously by the teacher as the child talks, and if the right relation 
of courteous helpfulness exists, the child accepts the correction, in- 
serts it, and proceeds without interruption to the flow of thought. 
If she cannot well make the correction as the child talks, then at the 
first favorable opportunity, the point should be raised. Timid, 
shrinking children need gpecial care. Gifted children need the 
teacher less, though it is usually this type of child who tells the- 
stories and creates the oral composition. 
It is essential that pupils be helped to improve their speech by 
drill upon the correct forms. With younger children, this means exer- 
cises set by the teacher; with older children, the keeping of a note 
book of “Mistakes and Corrections,” may be found helpful. Pro- 
gress can be accurately judged from year to year by comparing one 
year’s list of mistakes with those of the year following. Decrease 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  COMPOSITION—PRIMARY GRADES 89 . 
in errors should become a source of conscious pride. Mastery of 
technique will come through persistent and concerted effort through- 
out the school years. 
In planning for the corrective work in oral English, the teacher 
should keep constantly in mind the two fundamental ideas which 
constitute the aims of this work: 
1. To arouse on the part of the child a consciousness of whether 
or not he is using correct forms of speech. 
2. To create a desire, on the part of the child, to speak correctly. 
In order that this work may be effective, it must be adapted to 
the needs of the individual class. As a means of determining these 
needs it is possible for the teacher, early in the school year, to take 
an inventory of the grammatical errors made by her class and to 
base her corrective work upon the results of the inventory. Since 
it is impossible to plan corrective work for the wide range of errors 
which will be found occurring in each grade, it is essential that 
attention be concentrated upon a few errors each year. Dr. Klapper 
insists that not above three to six specific bad habits of grammar 
and idiom should be attacked each school year in the average class. 
Leonard, in “English Composition as a Social Problem,” says, “It 
is evident that we must concentrate our force on one point, or very 
small and closely related group of points, for a far longer time than 
we generally do at present, instead of attacking several at once, 
diffusing attention, and confusing our pupils.” 
The definite plan for taking the inventory of grammatical errors 
which was first used in our schools in October, 1919, proved so helpful 
that it has become a part of the regular procedure in beginning each 
year’s work in English. The following outline should be used as a 
guide by each teacher in taking this inventory in October of each 
year. 
INVENTORY OF GRAMMATICAL ERRORS 
GRADES I-VIII. 
Purposes: 
1. To aid you to list the oral errors that are made by the pupils in your class. 
2. To enable you to select from this list, the errors upon which your class needs 
intensive drill this year. 
3. To have material available for the ‘‘National Better Speech Week” in Novem- 
ber, during which a drive will be made to arouse interest in ““Better Speech.” 
4. To furnish a basis for judging improvement in oral language in your class this 
year. This will be possible by comparison of the results of this inventory with 
the results of the inventory you will be asked to take next June, after intensive 
work on the errors selected. 
Important: For convenient reference you are asked to keep on file in your school room 
the list of errors noted.
-P-A-G-E-93
  90 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
I. METHOD oF COLLECTING DaTa—To COVER A PERIOD 
or Two WEEKS 
(PREFERABLY THE FIRST TWO WEEKS IN OCTOBER) 
Errors in Speech: 
All teachers of Grades I to VIII should keep at hand a book 
in which to record oral errors made either during intermission or 
class time. In order to secure a representative list of errors that 
will show the real ability of your pupils in oral speech, it will be 
necessary that you listen carefully to the conversation of the children 
on the playground, and at other times when they are not conscious 
of being overheard. 
A teacher who has more than one grade in her room, as first and 
second, or fifth, sixth, and seventh, will find it more practicable to 
keep a composite list of oral errors made by the pupils in her room 
than to attempt to keep a separate list for the several grades. The 
grades may then ‘be combined for the corrective exercises. The 
recording of errors should be done unobtrusively so that pupils may 
not know that these lists are being kept. 
Important: In listing the errors, not simply the incorrect form of the 
verb should be listed, but the entire phrase in which the verb form 
occurs. For example—do not list the verb “done,” but “I done’ or 
“He done,” not “‘seen’’ or “went,” but “‘She seen,” “They have went.” 
II. SELECTION OF ERRORS FOR INTENSIVE DRILL 
DURING THE YEAR 
The tabulation of errors in your record book should be similar to 
the following: 
Total 
I seen) 1144141 1011 15 times 
They had went) 11111 11111 10m 
I ain’t got none) 111 Sis 
Can I 11111 11111 10-02 
She has wrote 11111 11111 11111 111 18 ” 
The above list is not complete, and will not be representative of 
your class, since other errors will be included and some of the above 
may not occur. It is merely suggestive of a convenient method of 
tabulation. 
At the end of the two weeks the total number of times each error 
occurred should be placed at the right hand side of the page for 
comparison. This will enable you to see readily the most frequent  
-P-A-G-E-94
  COMPOSITION—PRIMARY GRADES 91 
errors. You should then select for intensive drill the three errors 
which have the highest totals. This may seem to you a small 
number of errors to select as a basis for corrective work this year, 
but if you will assume responsibility for these three, and also con- 
centrate upon the correct pronounciation of words your pupils fre- 
quently mispronounce, such as, ‘‘get,” “just,” ‘‘such,’’ and words 
ending in “ing,” you will find this as much as you can accomplish. 
Next June you will be asked to take another inventory. The 
inventory then should show that the errors which are most common 
now, have practically ceased to occur in the ordinary speech of your 
pupils. This will be possible if you select only a few errors upon 
which to concentrate. 
In order that the findings of the inventory may serve a real pur- 
pose, the teacher will find it helpful to post in a prominent place 
in the classroom, the correct grammatical forms representing the 
actual needs of her class. These grammatical forms will vary with 
the class and represent a modification of the course of study to fit 
the individual class. (Children of the grammar grades should print 
the grammatical forms to be posted in the primary rooms.) Atten- 
tion of the children should frequently be called to these correct 
forms and corrective work such as language games may be planned 
as a part of the regular routine of the class room. Interest may be 
aroused by planning, early in the year, a “Better Speech Week” to 
initiate the annual campaign for the improvement of oral language. 
This week should be observed at the time set for ‘National Better 
Speech Week.” It is only by constant repetition of the correct 
forms that they will be come habitual. 
Suggestions for language games and for observance of “Better 
Speech Week’’ may be obtained at the City Office. 
‘WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
Sheridan, in Speaking and Writing English discusses written English, 
thus: 
When the pupil comes to put on paper what he has to say, the situation becomes 
complicated by the entrance of factors which were not present when he was express- 
ing himself orally. He must think about his penmanship. He must watch his 
spelling. He must look out for his capitals, his punctuation, his indentions, and 
all that. These things become automatic, or nearly so, after years of training and 
practice; so that educated men and women are required to give little or no thought 
to their penmanship, spelling, punctuation and the other technicalities of written 
expression... Strictly speaking, penmanship and spelling are not 
matters of language technique at all, since they are not developed primarily through 
written language. The school program provides separate drill for both. The failure  
-P-A-G-E-95
  92 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
to use capitals correctly (the period and the comma) is accountéd for not so much 
by the supposition that these things are difficult in themselves as it is explained by 
the lack of careful training in oral language. The child who is trained from the 
first to speak in clear-cut sentences will after a while acquire such a strong sentence 
sense that he will seldom, if ever, write as a sentence, a group of words that is not 
asentence. Pupils write in the classroom as they have been accustomed to talk in 
the classroom. Failure to use capitals and periods in written composition is largely 
due to bad oral habits. . If children do not possess the sentence’ sense, their written 
work is sure to contain many omissions of capitals and periods, and consequently 
many misuses of the comma. The teaching of written language, so far aScorrect- 
ness goes, offers but few difficulties over and above those which are met with in 
the teaching of oral language. 
Realizing that the results of the work in composition throughout 
the grades were unsatisfactory to both teachers and pupils, an 
. effort was made in 1917 to analyze the situation in order to make a 
beginning toward the reorganization of the Composition Course. 
The work was done by committees of teachers representing all 
grades of the elementary school. These committees found upon 
analyzing the suggestions in the Course of Study that the work as 
outlined by grades was vague and indefinite; that there was much 
over-lapping in the requirements for the various grades; that neither 
teachers nor pupils had standards by which to measure each year’s 
achievement. The task then was to decidé upon a definite require- 
ment for each grade. This necessitated an intensive study of the 
actual ability and accomplishment of children of each grade, and 
the setting of grade standards reasonably possible of achievement. 
It also meant an analysis of the technique of the composition in 
order to limit the work of each grade to the specific elements needed 
to attain the grade standard in written composition. These com- 
mittees evolved tentative standard compositions and lists of mini- 
mum essentials which are now being used as a guide for minimum 
achievement in independent written composition. Independent work 
ts the only fair test of a child’s ability in written composition. 
These standards are tentative only, and form a working basis for 
the present. They will be modified in the near future as the com- 
position problem is gradually worked out. Each standard .repre- 
sents the minimum requirement at the end of the year for the average 
child of the grade. Pupils will be found in every grade who are 
capable of work of a higher quality than that indicated in the grade 
standard. These pupils should not be restricted by the grade 
standard, but should be encouraged to do better work so long as 
they are held responsible for correctness in the points of technique 
listed for their own grades.

These standards and lists of minimum essentials will be of material 
assistance to the teachers in simplifying and making practical the 
work in composition.

FIRST GRADE 
The little child enters school equipped with a vocabulary and a 
manner of expressing ideas gained largely through imitation of the , 
elders in the home. The imaginative and imitative instincts are 
dominant at this period, so the best models of good English should 
be placed before him by the teacher as ideals for conscious and un- 
conscious imitation. The free and spontaneous expression in the 
conversations about home and school activities, including games 
and nature, link the language effort with the work in reading, litera- 
ture, and all the school subjects. At all times the teacher should 
respect and direct the halting efforts of the little child in his attempts 
at oral composition. 
Much stress should be placed on oral work. Habits of talking 
clearly, distinctly and correctly should be cultivated with much 
persistence. The children should be encouraged to talk freely about _ 
the things in and out of school that interest them: their pets and how | 
to take care of them; stories suggested by pictures; their Christmas 
toys and the fun they have with them; their visits to the park, the 
country or other places of interest. Some attention is given to 
orderly arrangement and sequence of thought until the habit of 
orderly thinking has been secured. Oral composition is as significant 
in value as written and paves the way for the latter. 
Written work is begun about the middle of the year, for which the 
copying of simple sentences, the making of sentences with word 
cards, and the work in reading and phonic spelling is a definite pre- 
paration. In this grade and in the second, much of the work may be 
termed class or cooperative work. ™*

  94 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Toward the end of the year some independent work should be done 
in both oral and written composition. 
1: Time allotment: Recitation: 15 minutes per day. 75 minutes per 
week. 
I. ORAL COMPOSITION 
Conversation: 
a. The subject is presented by the teacher but the method of 
procedure should be conversation with the children not to them. 
b. Each contributes his bit of experience under the guidance of 
the teacher who aids in making the thought clear and coherent. 
c. The child is led to think by skillful questioning using the form 
most adaptable to the subject matter. Personification, drama or 
dialogue, narrative, verse, each has its place and if freely used ina 
simple way during the oral lessons will be adapted by the child 
when needed. 
d. The oral composition, at first a class composition, gives the 
child some confidence in his own power to organize his thoughts 
under the stimulus of the teacher. As the child grows in ideas 
through experience, his oral composition grows in content and 
structure and furnishes a basis for future written work. 
e. Simple outlines made under the guidance of the teacher’s 
skillful questions will train the child to think in an orderly and 
logical manner. 
The teacher should frequently record on the blackboard the 
oral composition of the children; the best being used as a basis for 
discussion of correctness of technique and for blackboard reading 
lessons. 
Story-telling: 
a. Very short, simple stories told by the teacher should be re- 
produced by the children in answer to the teacher’s questions, in 
part, and in wholes. As much correction should be given as can 
take place without serious interruption of the child’s flow of 
thought. The best of these should frequently be used as stories 
for reading lessons. 
b. Dramatization of nursery rhymes and stories gives vitality 
to expression. 
c. Use the dramatized parts as a basis for language through 
“What I Was,” ‘““What We Did.” 
d. Records of the oral reproduction of the child should be made 
by the teacher at frequent intervals, the best being used for black- 
board reading lessons,

3. Pictures: 
a. Choose pictures which illustrate a part or the whole of a 
known story or poem. 
b. Original stories suggested by the picture told in very simple 
way. 
ComposiTioN—GRADE I—TyPE LESSON 
The following lesson taught by Miss May Bowers shows: 
1. The selection of a topic of interest to children. 
2. How the topic may be developed in such a way as to permit each child to speak 
from an individual point of view. 
3. How the teacher aided the pupils in thinking clearly in sentences. 
4. How even with the few sentences given, there was training in organization of 
subject matter. 
Introduction: 
One day as I was walking through the park, I saw a flock of sheep. Will you 
think of all the places that you have seen sheep? 
(Answers given in complete sentences, italicized parts written on blackboard.) 
I have seen sheep in the store window. 
I have seen sheep on the road. 
I have seen sheep in the country. 
I have seen sheep in the field. 
I have seen sheep in the park. 
We have seen sheep in a number of different\places—now think, when you saw the 
sheep. 
I saw a sheep last summer. 
Saturday, I saw a sheep. 
Yesterday, I saw a sheep. 
Last summer, 1 saw a sheep. 
One day \ast sumrrr, I saw a sheep. 
Think now who was with you. You surely did not go alone.” 
Two boys were with me. 
Frank and Joe were with me. 
Two other boys were with me. 
Mother was with me. 
Each of you put all of your stories into one story, and tell 
(When you saw the sheep) 
(Who was with you) 
(Where you saw it) 
Last summer I saw a sheep. My mother was with me. 
Last summer; my mother and I went to town and saw a sheep in the window. 
One day my cousin and I went to the country. We saw’a sheep. 
One warm day, my father and I took a walk in the country. We saw a sheep in 
the road. 
Think what the sheep was doing:— 
He was eating grass. 
He was rolling in the meadow. 
He was running. .3

Now, think the whole story:— 
Where you saw the sheep. 
When you saw the sheep. 
Who was with you 
What the sheep did, or

Saturday I went out to the country and saw some sheep.. The sheep were running 
about. 
II. WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
Not much written composition is attempted until the middle of 
the year, but from the beginning the child has copied simple sen- 
tences and made sentences with word cards. No independent 
written work should be expected until the child has gained some 
familiarity with the tools of expression. 
TENTATIVE List OF MINIMUM ESSENTIALS IN ENGLISH 
FIRST GRADE 
I. Technique of Written Work. 
There is no requirement for achievement in independent written composition until 
the second school year. In the first grade, however, the foundation must be laid 
for this independent work. In this grade written composition consists of two phases: 
1. Directed work in which the children under the immediate supervision of the 
teacher becomes familiar with the following points of tea 
(a) Period at end of every statement. 
(b) Question mark at end of every question. 
(c) Capital at beginning of sentence. 
(d) Capital in writing names of persons and places, and days of the week. 
(e) Writing correctly the child’s own name and address, and date if desired. 
2. Independent work: ¥ 
Construction of sentences with word cards observing the points of technique. 
II, Special Oral Work. 
An inventory of class errors should be taken during the first two weeks of October, 
and from this inventory the teacher should select the three or four forms that occur 
most frequently. This will determine her course of study in corrective work for 
the year. Guard against attempting too many forms in one year, but aim for 
100% efficiency in the few that are attempted. The teacher of this grade should 
be able at the end of the year to give to the teacher of the succeeding grade a list 
of forms that have been mastered by the pupils promoted. The following list is 
merely suggestive. 
1. Grammatical forms: 
I saw him I have no pencil 
John and J go to school My father said (not My father he said) 
I came to school 
2. Drill on pronunciation and enunciation of such words as: 
Just, get, catch, calling, running, ate. 
This list should be based upon the needs of the class as shown by the inventory. 
The teacher of first grade should be familiar not only with the minimum essen- 
tials listed for her grade, but also with those listed for the succeeding grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  COMPOSITION—SECOND GRADE 97 
She should also study the standards in written composition for the various 
grades in order that she may have a definite idea of the work for which the 
simple exercises in first grade composition are a preparation. 
SECOND GRADE 
Children should talk and write in response to a well-defined need. 
There are two sources of composition material, the child’s actual 
experience and observation, and the experiences and observations 
of others. The work of the second year isa continuation and ex- 
pansion of the first grade work. Much attention should be given to 
oral composition, though some individual. written composition 
should be the natural outgrowth of the class or co-operative work. 
Topics should be chosen in which children are interested and about 
which they have something to say. Sufficient preparation should 
be given to develop confidence and skill in effective expression. 
Much of the work should be done at the blackboard under the 
direct supervision of the teacher, but the subjects of study make 
some demand for writing on paper, such as records of experiences, 
stories, letters and invitations. As an aid, dictionaries of the much 
needed words may be made and by the end of the year a considerable 
writing vocabulary should have been gained. 
Time allotment: Recitation: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per 
week. Seatwork: 15 minutes per day under supervision. Total: 
_ 150 minutes per week. 
I. ORAL COMPOSITION 
1. Conversation. 
a. Secure spontaneity by encouraging children to talk freely 
about the things in and out of school that interest them: their 
pets, their plays, their toys, their visits and other happenings. 
b. Limit the subject to a specific phase of the problem. i 
c. Make the children conscious of the audience situation by having 
the speaker face the class and adapt the content of his story to the 
listeners. 2 
d. Use simple outlines, made by children, under teacher’s 
guidance, and skillful questioning, to give some training in orderly 
arrangement and sequence. 
e. Records should be made by the teacher of the best oral com- 
positions and used as a basis for discussion of correctness of technique. 
2. Story-telling. 
a.-Stories, short and simple, for reproduction in parts and in 
wholes. Secure good re-telling by dramatization.
-P-A-G-E-101
  98 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
b. Use the dramatized parts as a basis for composition through 
“How We Played the Story,” or ‘““What We Played Today.” 
c. Modify reproduction of stories by varying the form of the 
original, as, by dialogue, or by working out additional scenes. 
3. Pictures. 
a. Choose pictures which illustrate a known story or poem. 
b. Original stories suggested by the picture. 
II. WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
The child should be encouraged to express his own thought in 
response to a need. The record of it then seems to him valuable, 
as, a letter to a sick classmate, an invitation, a record of plant 
growth, a booklet of stories for his own personal use, or to give to 
another. There is joy also in the accumulation of power expressed 
in written work. Furnish a motive for records that make them seem 
worth while to the child. 
The material is the natural outgrowth of conversations about in- 
teresting things, as, nature, social activities, games, toys, industrial 
arts, excursions, original stories based on pictures. 
1. Class or co-operative work. 
a. All members contribute to the oral composition which grows 
into a coherent whole under teacher’s logical questioning, or simple 
outline. The best contributions are accepted and recorded upon 
the blackboard, read and revised after suggestions from the class, 
then copied by the children in part or as a whole if a good reason 
can be given for doing so. Discussion of technique should take 
place, as, paragraph form, capitals, and periods. Copying may 
help to fix the correct habits desired. 
2. Individual work. 
a. Careful oral preparation. 
b. Blackboard work, whenever possible, under the direct super- 
vision of the teacher who helps with the new or unusual words, 
makes suggestions to improve structure and form, in short, she makes 
success possible to each child by the encouragement which she gives. 
The purpose should be to keep the work joyous and spontaneous 
through the motive defined, and the teacher’s genuine enthusiasm. 
c. Class criticism of work; this criticism should be constructive. 
d. One individual composition under the direct supervision of 
the teacher and one written independently as seat work may be 
considered an adequate requirement for a week. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  COMPOSITION—SECOND GRADE 99 
e. Independent written work should not be attempted until 
the teacher feels that his class shows, through the oral work, suffi- 
cient strength in organization of thought. 
f. Children should acquire during the Second School Year the © 
habit of looking over written work carefully to discover and correct 
mistakes before handing it to the teacher. Work should show care- 
ful margins and correct spacing. Careless work cannot be accepted. 
‘TENTATIVE STANDARDS IN WRITTEN COMPOSITION

I saw ared bird. It was sitting out in the tree. It was very pretty. 
One day I lost my hat. Itoldmy mother. She told me to wear my brother’s hat. 
For a detailed discussion of these standards, see page 92, of the introduction to 
the course in composition for primary grades. The teacher should be familiar not 
only with the standards for her grade but also those of the succeeding grades.

1. Capitalization. 
a. Beginning sentences 
b. Names of persons 
c. Names of places (The child’s home address) 
d. Days of the week 
e. The pronoun “I” 
Note: Titles are not required in the child’s independent work. In a class com- 
position however, titles may be suggested by the pupils and the best one selected. 
This title will be written by the teacher and copied by the children without their 
being taught this rule of capitalization, 
2. Punctuation. 
a. Period at end of statement. 
b. Question mark at end of question. 
c. Correct punctuation required in writing the child’s name and address. 
II. Special Oral Work. ~ 
An inventory of class errors should be taken during the first two weeks of October 
and from this inventory the teacher should select the three of four forms that occur 
most frequently. This will determine her course of study in corrective work for 
the year. Guard against attempting too many forms in one year, but aim for 100% 
efficiency in the few that are attempted. The teacher of this grade should be able 
at the end of the year to give to the teacher of the succeeding grade a list of forms 
that have been mastered by the pupils promoted. The following list is merely 
suggestive. 
1. Grammatical Forms: 
Thaven’t any. 
Tell John and me.

Work for careful pronunciation of final g. 
Note: This list should be based upon the needs of the class as shown by the 
inventory. For detailed plan for work based upon the findings, see page 88 of the 
introduction to the course in composition for primary grades. The teacher of second 
grade should be familiar not only with the minimum essentials listed in her grade, 
but also with those listed for the preceding and succeeding grades. 
ComposITION—GRADE II—TypE Lesson 
The following lesson taught by Miss Kate Leahy shows: 
1. The selection of a topic of interest to children. 
2. How the topic may be developed in such a way as to permit each child to speak 
from a personal point of view. 
3. How the teacher aided the pupils in thinking clearly in sentences. 
4, How even with the few sentences given, there was training in organization of 
subject matter. 
Introduction: 
The teacher began with a review of the story of “The Honest Woodman” which 
the class had enjoyed a few days previously during the literature period. 
The lesson in composition then proceeded as follows: 
Teacher: I’m sure everybody in this room has lost something at some time. 
Each of you think of what you lost, then tell us what it was you lost. 
The children gave answers similar to the following which were written on the 
blackboard by the teacher: 
T lost a ball. 
T lost a top. 
I lost a pencil. 
I lost a watch. 
Teacher: Now you may think about what you lost. This time think about these 
things: 
When you lost it. 
Where you lost it. 
If you found it, how you found it. 
If you did not find it, what you did. 
Who is ready to tell us about what you lost? 
The following. stories are typical of those given orally by the children: 
One day while I was to the shore I lost a ring. I lost it in the field. I looked all 
over the field but I could not fird it. A little girl found it and brought it to me. 
I said, “Thank you, little girl.” Then I went home and told my mother. 
One bright, sunny day while walking down the street I lost a penny. I looked 
and looked but I could not find it. A little girl found it on the pavement and gave 
jt to me. I said ‘“‘Thank you,” and I looked at her with a bright, friendly smile. 
I went home and told my mother all about it.
-P-A-G-E-104
  
  COMPOSITION—THIRD GRADE 101. 
One bright day as I was walking down the street I lost my watch. It rolled under 
astep. At last I looked under the step and found it. 
While walking up the street one night I lost a necklace. I looked and looked 
but could not find it. A few days afterward a little girl gave it to me. I took it 
home to mother. 
One day I went to see Auntie. I left my doll on the step. When I came out it 
was not there. A little girl came along and asked me what I was looking for. She 
hunted and hunted. - At last she looked under the step and found it. I said “Thank 
you little girl.” Then I went home. : 
THIRD GRADE 
The composition work should follow the same general lines as in 
the preceding year, emphasis being placed upon oral composition 
rather than upon written, though the latter will not be neglected 
since there is a gradually increasing need for permanent records. 
The class story or co-operative work should be continued and the 
_ individual written work should receive such careful oral preparation 
_that there will be a decrease in technical errors. Children learn to 
write by writing, and correct habits are fixed by repetitions of correct 
forms under the stimulus of interest. Motive for written work as 
well as for oral should be amply provided in this grade. Records 
of experiences of work in history and geography, of nature observa- 
tions, letters, stories retold in dramatic form, original stories from 
pictures, original verse, both class and individual products, should 
be made, but always in response to some real need. 
Criticism of oral composition should be made without serious inter- 
ference with the natural flow of thought. Members of the class 
should be given an opportunity to suggest better arrangement and 
form of sentences, aid being given by the teacher’s record on the 
blackboard of a child’s,oral composition. Helpful criticism by the 
children of both oral and written work should be encouraged. The 
definite aim of criticism is to train the pupil’s ear to be sensitive to 
correctness of speech, and to train his eye to view his own writing 
with care, thus preventing errors in speech and pen. The teacher 
should establish a correct viewpoint for herself and help the children 
to overcome difficulties by constant watchfulness upon a few things: 
the correct use of simple punctuation marks, and clear, simple, 
direct sentence structure. Much of this is presented in correct 
form in the class story or co-operative work. But this is not enough 
to establish habits which will carry over into individual and inde- 
pendent work, because then the child is concerned with both content 
and form. The subject should be limited to some specific phase 
calling for vivid and full detail such as the third grade child can give.
-P-A-G-E-105
102 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
There should be a first writing under the impulse of interest and 
the desire to express oneself. This first draft written work should 
then be read and corrected by the children, as far as they are able, 
working for the correction of only one phase of technique in a 
lesson. Better results will be secured by concentrating upon a few 
points. Confusion results from attempting too much at a time. 
Mahoney in “Standards in English,” says, “It should be the aim 
of the teacher to give to the children the power intelligently to look 
over their work with a view to bringing that work up to the standard 
of correctness........ This end can be attained only by following 
out consistently through the grades a method based upon several 
very important principles.......... 
The first of these principles is that there must be some degree 
of progression in the work of correction............ 
In the second place, it is well to remember that the object of 
correcting is not to mark the pupil, but to help the pupil...... Third, 
pupils should be taught how to criticise and how to appreciate in- 
telligently their own and one another’s work.” 
Time allotment: 30 minutes per day, 150 minutes per week. 
I. ORAL COMPOSITION 
1. Conversation. 
a. Secure spontaneity by encouraging children to have ideas 
and providing a motive for their expression. They are interested 
in: narration of experiences; descriptions of dramatic or other games, 
objects of nature study, industrial art projects, pictures; summaries 
of lessons. 
b. Limit the subject to a specific phase commensurate with the 
child’s ability, and aim to retain originality in treatment. 
c. Skillful questioning by the teacher, and simple outlines, made 
by children, under the teacher’s guidance will give some training in 
orderly arrangement and sequence. 
d. Records of the best oral compositions should be made on the 
blackboard by the teacher. The summary of co-operative work, as 
well as individual effort will be found helpful. 
e. The test of the directed work is to be found in the daily re- 
citation in the various subjects, and the pupil’s effort to say clear- 
ly and exactly what he observes, thinks, or knows should be re- 
garded as oral composition and guided accordingly. The con- 
versational attitude is maintained by a social situation. Make the 
children conscious of the audience situation, by having the speaker 
face the class and adapt the content of his story to his listeners.
-P-A-G-E-106
    COMPOSITION—THIRD GRADE 103 
2. Story-telling. 
a. Stories, short and simple, for reproduction in parts and in 
wholes. Secure good re-telling by dramatization. 
b. Use the dramatized parts as a basis for description. 
c. Modify reproduction of stories by varying the form of the 
original, as by dialogue, or by working out additional scenes. 
3. Pictures. : 
a. Choose pictures which illustrate or suggest well-known stories 
and poems. Have the stories re-told and the poems recited. 
b. Original stories suggested by the picture, thus teaching children 
to read a story in a picture. 
II. WRITTEN COMPOSITION * 
This work should involve the paragraph as a unit of expression. 
The form and the use has already become familiar through the class 
story of the preceding grades and reading material. The oral 
composition has helped to emphasize how to think subject matter 
in a definite order. The written work or record should come in 
response to a felt need which to the children seems valuable. The 
need for communication may take the form of a letter to a sick class- 
mate, a business letter, as asking for books, an invitation to a class 
play. The wish to share involves exchange of letters between classes 
and schools, giving information, writing personal experiences, making 
original stories, and dramas for enjoyment. The desire for preser- 
vation leads to records of history, geography, and nature facts, of 
poems and original stories in class and individual booklets. Record8 
of projects in geography and history which illustrate the ‘“‘wish to 
share” may be secured at the office of the supervisors. 
1. Class, or co-operative work: 
a. The work will be continued upon the same lines as in the 
preceding grade, viz. the oral composition growing into a coherent 
whole under the teacher’s guidance of logical questioning or simple 
outline. The best contributions are recorded upon the blackboard 
for further criticism and suggestion. This furnishes an ideal 
worthy of respect and should be used as a basis for discussion of 
the correctness of technique. 
2. Individual Work: 
a. The independent written work of this grade should be 
limited to the one paragraph composition. This will be easily 
possible if the teacher is careful to see that the topic is narrowed 
to a single phase. Sheridan in Speaking and Writing English
-P-A-G-E-107
  
104 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
says: ‘‘The chief reason for limiting the written exercise to a 
single paragraph is to assure sufficient practice in writing which 
a longer composition makes impossible, and to focus the attention 
of both pupil and teacher upon the smallest possible language 
rs It is not a question of whether children can be 
trained to write longer paragraph or composition of more than one 
paragraph although no large proportion of the teachers of the 
country have yet demonstrated that it can be done. The writer 
believes that even if it were possible to train all children in the 
grammar grades to write a long composition and to write it well, 
it would be a waste of time to do it.” 
b. Careful oral preparation should include the — defined 
motive for a record. 
c. Blackboard work whenever possible, under the direct super- 
vision of the teacher who makes suggestions to improve structure 
and form. The purpose should be to keep the work spontaneous, 
joyous, and worth while throughout by having a well-defined 
motive which is valid to the children coupled with the teacher’s 
genuine enthusiasm. 
d. Class criticism of work on blackboard will lead children to 
be critical of their own work. Mahoney in Standards in Eng- 
lish, says, “It should be the aim of the teacher to give to the 
children the power intelligently to look over their work with a 
view to bringing that work up to the standard of correctness...... 
This end can be attained only by following out consistently 
through the grades a method based upon several very important 
Principlesse..t ss. 
The first of these principles is that there must be some degree 
of progression in the work of correction.......... 
In the second place, it is well to remember that the object of 
correcting is not to mark the pupil, but to help the pupil.. .. . Third, 
pupils should be taught how to criticize and how to appreciate 
intelligently their own and one another’s work.” 
e. One composition under the direct supervision of the teacher 
and one written independently as seat-work may be considered 
an adequate requirement for a week. 
3. Letter writing: 
Children of the third grade should have some experience with 
simple letter writing, and real live situations in which children are 
very keenly interested should furnish motive for this form of work.  
-P-A-G-E-108
  COMPOSITION—THIRD GRADE 105 
Most of the letters should be the result of co-operative work, 
but that makes them no less interesting if proper motives for 
correspondence are provided. Class letters to absent classmates, 
containing an interesting experience, as a school event, the story 
for the day, or other interests, delight both writer and recipient. 
Correspondence clubs between two classes in a school or different 
schools in the country or at a distance should be encouraged. 
Occasionally read to the class letters from children and famous 
people. The technique of letter-writing should be observed, imi- 
tated, but not discussed to any extent. Fix the correct ideals 
now, secure a degree of correct habit and leave discussion to the 
later grades. The following suggestions should be observed: 
a. Copy a class letter to an absent classmate. Be sure that it 
contains something interesting and spontaneous. 
b. Copy a class letter to the Correspondence Club of which 
you are a member. Be sure that it contains items of interest 
and meets a real need. : 
c. Copy a simple class business letter, as one asking for seeds, 
or for books. 
d. Copy a class invitation to another class. 
e. Make envelopes, and copy address correctly. 
f. Independent letter, relating some real experience in school 
or out-of-doors, relating an imaginary journey, or answering a 
real letter from a friend. 
g. Correct form of heading, salutation, signature, should be 
_uniformly required and fixed through repetition. 
TENTATIVE STANDARDS IN WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
THIRD GRADE 
Making a Snowman 
One snowy day I made a snowman. I put a hat on him, I put stones for his 
mouth and nose and eyes. Then the boys threw snowballs at: him. 
A Ride 
One day last spring I took a ride in a train to the country. I fed the chickens 
and had a jolly time. I came home happy. 
: My Bicycle 
I got my bicycle last Christmas. It is black and green. I had a hard time trying 
to ride it. I have only had one puncture since I got my wheel. 
For a detailed discussion of these standards, see page 92, of the introduction to 
the course in composition for primary grades. The teacher of third grade should 
be familiar not only with the standards, but also those of the preceding and suc- 
ceeding grades.

I. Technique of Written Work. 
1. Capitalization. 
(a)Review work of previous grades (Beginning sentences; names of persons, 
names of places; names of days of the week; the pronoun “I”’). 
(b) Titles of stories (Important words). 
(c) Names of months. 
(d) Name of our state. 
2. Punctuation: 
(a) Period at end of statement. 
(b) Question mark at end of question. 
(c) Correct punctuation used in writing the child’s name and address. 
3. Abbreviations: 
Mr., Mrs., St., the pupil’s own initials; names of days and of months. 
Note: These points give difficulty in written composition therefore are included 
here, but they should be taught during the spelling period. 
II. Special Oral Work, 
An inventory of class errors should be taken during the first two weeks of October 
and from this inventory the teacher should select the three or four forms that occur 
most frequently. This will determine her course of study in corrective work for 
the year. Guard against attempting too many forms in one year, but aim for 100% 
efficiency in the few that are attempted. The teacher of this grade should be able 
at the end of the year to give to the teacher of the succeeding grade a list of forms 
that have been mastered by the pupils promoted. The following list is merely 
suggestive: 
1. Grammatical Forms: 
Has John gone yet? He has gone. 
That isn’t mine. He gave me a pencil. 
You were down there. He doesn’t know. 
It is I. 
2. Drill on pronunciation and enunciation of such words as: 
yours (not ‘‘yourn”’) don’t you 
didn’t you couldn’t you 
can’t you desk 
Note: This list should be based upon the needs of the class as shown by the 
inventory. For detailed plan for taking the inventory and suggestions for corrective 
work based upon the findings, see page 88, the introduction to the course in compo- 
sition for primary grades. The teacher of third grade should be familiar not only 
with the minimum essentials listed for her grade but also with those listed for the 
preceding and succeeding grades. 
ComPosITION—GRADE IJI—TyPE LEsson 
The following lesson taught by Miss Anna Purvis shows: 
1. The selection of a topic of interest to children. 
2. How the topic may be developed in such a way as to permit each child to speak 
from a personal point of view. 
3. How the teacher aided the pupils in thinking clearly in sentences.
-P-A-G-E-110
  COMPOSITION—FOURTH GRADE 107 
4, How even with the few sentences given there was training in organization of 
subject matter. 
The teacher introduced the lesson by referring to a previous discussion of moun- 
tains in a geography lesson. 
“T am going to show you the picture of an animal that likes to live in the moun- 
tains.” (Shows picture of donkey). 8 
“How many have seen a donkey? Let’s tell stories about donkeys we have 
seen.” (Put picture away and wrote subject on board: “The Donkey.”) 
“This is such a big subject that we do not want to use it. Think of a donkey 
you have seen and decide what you would like to tell us.”’ 
By questions about him the teacher got the following list, which she placed on 
the blackboard beneath the subject, ‘‘The Donkey.” 
What the Donkey can do. 
Driving the Donkey. 
The Donkey Pulling the Heavy Load. 
The Runaway Donkey. 
Baby’s Stuffed Donkey. 
Harnessing the Donkey. 
The Donkey on the Road. 
Feeding the Donkey. 
Stories were then told by children, each being asked to tell about one of the donkeys 
mentioned on the blackboard. 
Baby’s Stuffed Donkey 
Baby has a stuffed donkey. She thinks it can run faster than a real donkey. 
She loves her donkey. She will not let no one touch it. (Teacher by questions had 
children add several statements here), 
Driving the Donkey 
Grandfather will take us for a drive in the cart. The donkey will pull the cart. 
The donkey does not like to pull a heavy load. He kicks and plunges. The donkey 
does not give us a very pleasant ride. We do not enjoy the trip very much. 
What The Donkey Can Do 
The donkey is a very lazy creature. Heis dumb also. He does not like to draw 
acart, but he likes to stay in the stable or in the pasture. When he has to be hitched 
toa cart he kicks the stones out of place. Heshakesthecart. He kicks and plunges. 
He is very tame but he is stubborn. 
FOURTH GRADE 
The composition work follows the same general lines as in the 
preceding grades, but should show development in ability in inde- 
pendent work. Motivated work is a necessity to secure results. 
There is the need for communication which leads to the writing of | 
simple business letters, as asking for a set of books from the circulat- 
ing library at the supervisor’s office, invitations to class plays, 
notices and advertisements of class school affairs. There is the 
desire to share with others which results in the friendly letters, in 
the correspondence clubs, recording information and experiences for 
another’s enjoyment, making plays, original stories and poems.
-P-A-G-E-111
  108 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
There is the motive of preservation which makes it seem worth 
while to record in some permanent form outlines, summaries, stories 
gleaned from history, geography, and nature, loved poems and even 
original verse and songs. The class and individual booklets for 
personal use, for exchange in class and between classes come to have 
significance from this standpoint. 
Training in oral composition requires much attention in this as 
in the preceding grades. Growth in the power of expression should 
keep pace with growth in knowledge and experience. Care in the 
use of language needs to be stimulated and guided by furnishing 
ideals for imitation and by judicious correction. The daily exercise 
as the outgrowth of well-organized thinking is of great value in 
developing the child’s powers of observation, in increasing his 
vocabulary, in training him to express himself in the presence of 
others. Each recitation tests the pupil’s ability to express himself 
clearly and exactly. Thinking in relation to a preconceived plan 
should precede all written work. We learn to write by writing and 
the mastery of technique is acquired by carefully planned daily 
exercises in corrective work. 
Criticism of written work should strengthen the habits begun in 
third grade, the definite aim being to make the pupil view his own 
writing critically. Ideals of technique are presented through the 
discussion of good compositions written by individual members of 
the class, and of the minimum standards for the grade. But this 
is not sufficient to establish habits which will carry over into the 
unsupervised work, because there the child is concerned. with both 
form and content. Since spontaneity, ease and flow of thought is 
desired, the first writing should be done under the impulse of interest 
and desire to express oneself. This first draft should be surveyed as 
critically as a fourth grade child is able to do, correcting errors in- ° 
volving only one phase of technique in a lesson. Better results will 
be secured by concentrating upon a few points. Confusion results 
from attempting too much at a time. The development of this 
critical attitude will aid materially in the acquirement of automatic 
mechanical skill. 
Time allotment: 30 minutes per day, 150 minutes per week. 
I. ORAL COMPOSITION 
1. Conversation: 
a. Specific exercises in composition should come through the 
mediums of spontaneous interest and motivated work. Children 
are interested in narration of experiences; descriptions of persons
-P-A-G-E-112
    
COMPOSITION—FOURTH GRADE 109 
and places, of dramatic and other games, of experiments, of pictures; 
and summaries of observations, both in school and out. 
b. Each recitation in history, geography, nature study, literature, 
industrial arts, is an opportunity for oral composition, and should be 
so regarded. While the work is primarily concerned with thought- 
content, yet form should not be disregarded. The same general 
principles as are set forth in the preceding grades are considered 
essential: first, a social situation, and a motive sufficiently impelling; 
second, clear thinking; third, simple, orderly, and attractive ex- 
pression. The teacher should look upon the recitation as a class or 
co-operative composition based upon an outline to which all con- 
tribute, with a summary, by one or more children, at the end. 
c. Limit the subject to a specific phase commensurate with the 
pupil’s ability, and aim to retain originality in treatment. Simple 
outlines aid in coherent composition. 
d. Skillful questioning, and simple outlines, made by both teacher 
and children will give training in orderly arrangement and sentence 
structure. Teach the children how to introduce a story in a way 
that will arouse interest, curiosity, and expectation on the part of 
the audience. This will eliminate the mechanical device for securing 
a good introduction by including in the opening sentence some hint 
of the time, place, characters, and the plot. 
2. Story-telling: 
a. Stories reproduced in parts and wholes as in preceding grades. 
Dramatization should be used for further appreciation and as a 
basis for written class dramas. 
b. Reproductions of stories modified by varying the form of the 
original, as by dialogue or by working out additional scenes. 
c. Original stories suggested by pictures, nature, plays, and work, 
will readily provide suggestive interests. The teacher’s chief busi- 
ness is to lead the children to realize their experiences and to cast 
them into purposeful and well-planned expression, using literature 
to furnish ideas as well as background. 
3. Pictures: 
a. Choose pictures which illustrate or suggest well-known stories 
and poems. Have the stories retold and the poems recited. 
b. Original stories suggested by a picture, thus teaching children 
to read the story in a picture. Famous pictures by well-known artists 
should be used.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
110 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
II. WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
This work involves the paragraph as a unit of expression. The 
form and use have already become familiar through the class story 
of the preceding grades and the reading material. The oral compo- 
sition has helped to emphasize how to think subject matter in a 
definite order, as well as to create respect for attractive or pleasing 
rendition. Simple outlines made by the children under teacher’s 
guidance, aid in good construction. The written work should come 
in response to a felt need which the children recognize as valuable, 
viz: desire for communication, sharing and prese vation. The need 
for communication may take the form of a letter to a sick classmate, 
a business letter, as asking for books, or an invitation to a class 
play. The wish to share involves exchange of letters between classes 
and schools, giving information, writing personal experiences, making 
original stories, and dramas for enjoyment. The desire for preser- 
vation leads to records of history, geography, and nature facts, of 
poems and original stories in class and individual needs. 
1. Class or co-operative work: 
This work will be continued in this grade, though less frequently, 
and as occasion demands. It serves its best purpose in the summary 
of history, geography or of nature lessons, and in the introduction 
of unusual or unfamiliar forms, as the drama, the letter, invitation, 
or original verse. Just as in preceding grades, there is necessity for 
a record on the blackboard of oral class compositions since they 
furnish ideals worthy of imitation and give opportunity for discussion 
of technique. 
2. Individual work: 
a. The independent written work of this grade should be limited 
to the one paragraph composition. This will be easily possible if 
the teacher is careful to see that the topic is narrowed to a single 
phase. Sheridan in Speaking and Writing English says: “The 
chief reason for limiting the written exercise to a single paragraph 
is to assure sufficient practice in writing which a longer composition 
makes impossible, and to focus the attention of both pupil and teacher 
upon the smallest possible language field..... . It is not a question 
of whether children can be trained to write a longer paragraph or 
composition of more than one paragraph although no large propor- 
tion of the teachers of the country have yet demonstrated that it 
can be done. The writer believes that even if it were possible to 
train all children in the grammar grades to write a long composition 
and to write it well, it would be a waste of time to do it.”
-P-A-G-E-114
  COMPOSITION—FOURTH GRADE ta 
b. In supervised individual work, careful oral preparation should 
be made, which includes the clearly defined motive for a record. 
c. Some members of the class should work at the blackboard. 
Much work should be done under direct supervision of the teacher 
who aids in form and structure, giving such encouragement that each 
pupil is stimulated to his best effort. A well-defined motive which 
the children recognize as worth while coupled with the teacher’s 
own enthusiasm and desire to establish correct habits will help to 
accomplish this. 
d. Class criticism of work on blackboard will lead children to be 
critical of their own work. Mahoney in Standards in English, 
says, “It should be the aim of the teacher to give to the children the 
power intelligently to look over their work with a view to bringing 
that work up to the standard of correctness........ This end can 
be attained only by following out consistently through the grades 
a method based upon several very important principles.......... 
The first of these principles is that there must be some degree 
of progression in the work of correction.......... 
In the second place, it is well to remember that the object of 
correcting is not to mark the pupil, but to help the pupil...... Third, 
pupils should be taught how to criticize and how to appreciate in- 
telligently their own and one another’s work.” 
e. One individual composition under the direction of the teacher, 
and one written independently may be considered an adequate 
requirement for a week. 
3. Letter writing: 
This form of composition needs especial emphasis since letter 
writing is the common means of communication used in every day 
life. But letter writing becomes aimless and perfunctory unless 
same means for appreciation of its real value are introduced. To this 
end Correspondence Clubs are invaluable in providing motive. Two 
clases in the same or different schools in the county, or at a distance 
should plan correspondence for a specific purpose and in this way 
make letters real. Records of projects in history and geography 
which illustrate letter writing and record keeping with a ‘‘specific 
motive’? may be secured at the office of the supervisors. 
« a. The technique of letter writing should be observed;-imitated, 
and stich points as heading, salutation, ending, and signature dis- 
cussed with pupils in this grade. 
b. The correct habits of addressing envelopes should be developed. 
*
-P-A-G-E-115
  112 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
c. Kinds of letters; notes, invitations, friendly and business 
letters. 
d. Content in letters determined by the kind: a Correspondence 
Club offers many opportunities, school needs, as books from the 
circulating library, communications telling of work accomplished, 
courtesies extended, and requests for information suggested by a 
subject of study. : 
e. Class letters when occasion offers. 
f. Read ‘Children’s Letters” from famous writers to class for 
purposes of enjoyment, and to furnish ideals. 
4. Grammar forms: 
The work on the revision of the Course of Study in Composition . 
and Grammar was begun in 1918. The tentative results of the re- 
vision of the Composition are included in this reprint (1921), but the | 
work in Grammar has not yet been satisfactorily graded for in- © 
clusion at this time. Until this work can be definitely outlined, the 
teacher of fourth grade should follow the text for her grade, omitting 
such points as do not contribute directly toward the attainment of 
the tentative Grade Standards and Minimum Essentials in English 
of Baltimore county. Text: Hosic and Hooper, A Child’s Composi- 
tion Book, Rand, McNally & Co.

FOURTH GRADE : 
A Motor Car Ride 
It was a very warm day in August when my father came home and said he had to 
go a long way up the country. He said he wanted us to take a ride with him. So 
I got ready in a few minutes. In about a half hour we were on a long shady road. 
When I got home I was pretty tired. 
Carrying Water 
Yesterday I carried ten buckets of water on my sleigh. Every time I went to 
the pump I carried two buckets. I filled the tank and all the water buckets. I like 
to carry water on my sled because I can ride on my way to the pump and I can go 
faster. i 
Our Little Chicks 
Our little chickens hatched last week. Three little peeps had feathers down their 
legs. Some were white, some were black and some were brown. They were real 
fluffy. They flapped their little wings and ran around like little birds. Sunday 
we put them in the chicken yard with the mother hen. 
For detailed discussion of these standards, see page 92, of the introduction to 
the course in composition for primary grades. The teacher of fourth grade should 
be familiar not only with the standards for her grade, but also those of the preceding 
and succeeding grades. :
-P-A-G-E-116
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES 115 
And for Spoken English Mr. Sheridan gives the following needs of 
the school: 
It is much more important that the elementary school should give pupils ability 
to talk well than it is that it should give them ability to write well. This is simply 
because people talk more than they write 4 
There are several reasons why our pupils do not jenn to talk well: 
1. There is not enough of oral language work, as a separate and distinct training 
in the elementary school. 
2. Oral work is not utilized as much as it ought to be as an aid in, and a prep- 
aration for, written work. The child who is to be taught to write well must first 
be taught to talk well. 
3. The other school subjects are not utilized as effectively as they might be to 
develop power in oral composition. 
4, The common method of the recitation furnishes little motive for the pupil to 
talk well. Very rarely has he the sense that he is addressing an audience with the 
purpose of saying something worth while . é 
5. The school has perpetually to fight the bad afnenee of the language environ- 
ment in which many pupils spend their out-of-school hours. 
6. The school makes the mistake of thinking it can correct bad habits of speech 
by the application of the rules of grammar. The ability to talk correctly comes 
from practice and not from the study of rules 
An effective course in oral composition should sclicies the following essential 
things: 
1. Much opportunity for free self-expression. 
2. Constant attention to matters of voice, enunciation, pronunciation, and in- 
flection. 
3. The training of children, by constant practice, to compose oral paragraphs 
upon simple themes, and the development, through these, of some elementary 
skill in selecting, arranging, and expressing their ideas. 
4, Unremitting efforts in all grades to eliminate the common errors of speech. 
II. Materials for oral and written composition: 
The topics should be, “‘purposed, planned, executed, and judged 
by the pupils either individually or in co-operation.” 
Topics based upon the children’s experiences, or growing out of 
projects worked out in connection with the other school subjects 
will afford ample opportunity for each child to select the phase of 
the subject which represents his personal point of view. 
Sheridan in, “Speaking and Writing English,” says: “It is highly 
important that teachers should from the earliest years seek to train 
children, day in and day out, to select a single phase of a subject for 
elaboration in their paragraphs, instead of permitting them to 
spread themselves out thin, as they are sure to do in the absence of 
careful, persistent effort upon the part of teachers, over all the 
things, near or remote, that may suggest themselves in connection 
with a chosen subject.” fo

-P-A-G-E-117
  116 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
In both oral and written work children should be made conscious 
of the audience situation in order that they may select a phase of the 
topic which will prove interesting to the listeners or readers, and 
adapt their discussion accordingly. 
This point is brought out in the following statement by Professor 
F. T. Baker, “The only test of language is the effectiveness with 
which it does its work of conveying ideas to someone else who wants 
to hear them, or who is made willing to hear them by the way they 
are put.” 
The sources of topics for purposeful oral composition: 
1. The child’s daily experiences. 8. Manual training and cook- 
2. Games. ery activities. 
3. Current events. 9. Pictures. 
4. Geography topics. 10. Dramatizations. 
5. History topics. 11. Literature, prose and poe- 
6. Industrial arts. try. 
7. Nature-study topics developed 12. Stories retold from litera- 
in the class room. ture. 
Letter writing, including both social and business correspondence, is an important 
type of written composition. 
III. Kinds of composition: 
The daily class work and daily living outside of school call for 
every kind of composition: narration, description, exposition and 
argument. For instance, narration is called for pre-eminently in 
history work; description in history, geography, and science; exposi- 
tion and argument in arithmetic, history, games, industrial arts, 
household economics, and manual training. Letter writing alone 
calls for the four kinds. The four forms of discourse must therefore 
find place in our plans, but not as distinct kinds for a well written 
narration always contains some vivid descriptive elements and 
description is seldom pure description. 
IV. Letter writing: 
“Nowadays there is scarcely a person who does not at some time 
write a letter or wish to write one (yet it is) an undoubted fact—that 
what all are doing somehow, few are doing well. . . . . Here 
is a task then for a writer: to send his greeting, his best self through a 
letter, to be jolly, thoughtful, sympathetic, as the case may require, 
and yet write nothing that he will afterward be ashamed of or re- 
gret having written.” (Briggs and McKinney.) 
Business letters should be as brief and concise as possible.
-P-A-G-E-118
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES 117 
Friendly letters should be interesting and show feeling about the 
subject discussed. The writer must be definite, especially in details, 
point of view, and words. In correct letter forms, children should 
refer frequently to the texts in use in the grades: Hosic and Hooper, 
A Child’s Composition Book, and a Composition Grammar. 
V. Writing original poems and short stories: 
“But besides the work that grows out of the various studies and letter writing as 
a means of personal expression, there is yet another kind of composition that is 
equally important; that, namely, which grows out of literary study and calls upon 
the more purely literary and poetic inventiveness and constructiveness of the child. 
This is the counterpart of the work that is being done in reading, especially the work 
of the ballad and short story. The attempt made in the interests of appreciation 
to bring home to the child a feeling for the convincing and felicitous progression, 
climax, surprise and unity of the master pieces of balladry and fiction, and grad- 
ually to give him an insight into the simpler principles of construction—beginning, 
middle and end; introduction, development and conclusion, setting and character 
grouping; the plot—weaving in short, that has such a fascination for children— 
this must have its outcome in the child’s own effort to invent and create, and to 
master the joinery of the story-teller’s craft.”—Chubb. 
The following attempt by a class at writing original verse was made 
- in the Fifth Grade of the Garrett Heights School, Miss Georgia 
McDonnal, teacher. It is worth-while work as her account proves: 
BaLLaD StuDY—FIFTH GRADE WorK 
First of all, in the teaching of ballads, one must create for the child a background. 
We need only go to the story of Pyle’s Robin Hood for this. The ballad is there 
mentioned many, many times. The way ballads were made is also suggested: 
“Many ballads were both told and sung.”” These ballads have come down to us 
from mouth to mouth through the centuries without bringing a hint as to their 
author. A ballad was a dance song, usually beaten out by the stamping of feet 
upon the ground. In Europe centuries ago it was customary to improvise ballads 
when strong excitement prevailed—as at a festival of the seasons, or on the eve 
of a battle, or after a great victory—and to sing and dance them out on the village 
green or in the public square or market place 
Ballads are classified as follows: (1) mythological, (2) historic or traditionary, 
(3) romantic, (4) humorous, (5) modern. 
In taking up the work with my own fifth grade I began with several simple bal- 
lads of Robin Hood which belong to the humorous class, the plots of which the chil- 
dren knew. Here we noted the quaint words and phrases, the repetition, the rhyme 
and the meter. 
From the ‘“‘humorous ballads” we passed to a study of “‘mythological” or those 
which contain the element of superstitition. I chose “True Thomas.” 
Ballad: “True Thomas.” 
The method of presentation was as follows: 
1, Explanation of unusual words and phrases (written on board). 
2. Reading of ballad. 
3. Questions for understanding first and then for appreciation.
-P-A-G-E-119

4. Filled in gaps—aided imagination in clearing up story. 
5. Children retold story. 
6. Selected quaint phrases and ends. such as— 
: “grass-green silk,” “aboun the knee,” 
“milk-white steed,” “ilka tett” (every lock), 
“red-blood,” “Tillie leven”, 
7. Selected mythological touches. Example: 
(a) “And if ye dare to kiss my lips, 
Sure of your body I will be.” 
To kiss a fairy or a ghost always puts mortals into the power of the spirits of 
darkness, 
(b) “Ono, Ono, True Thomas.” 
He who eats of the food of fairyland will never live to return to earth. So the 
queen takes back with her from the Earth a loaf and a bottle of wine as food for 
Thomas, who, after serving her seven years, will go back as prophet to his people. 
8. Teacher re-read the ballad. 
9. Children repeated any parts they remembered. 
Ballad: ‘The Wife of Usher’s Well.” 
This is considered the finest type of the superstitious ballad. The method of 
procedure here is similar: 
. Recalled modern superstitions. 
. Read ballad. 
. Few questions to show drift of story. 
. Questions for appreciation. 
. Named superstitious touches: 
“The fulfillment of the evil wish;” 
“The crowing of the cock was considered a warning from the other world.” 
. This ballad lends itself to dramatization, so we dramatized it. 
. Memorized it. This is quite easy, because of the repetition. 
. Noted some ballad characteristics: 
Repetitions. 
Dialogue without naming speakers. 
Mannerisms, such as “up and spake,” “up and crew,” etc. 
Ballad: “The Douglas Tragedy.” 
I selected “The Douglas Tragedy” as a type of the romantic ballad. 
1. Recalled adventurous stories—mostly fairy tales. 
2. Explained words and phrases, 
3. Read ballad. 
4, Noted the difference between the movement in this and in “The Wife of 
Usher’s Well.” 
5. Questions for understanding and appreciation. 
6. Picked out familiar phrases— 
“milk-white steed.” 
“dapple gray,” 
“bonny red rose,”” 
“make my bed broad and deep.’

7. Marked superstitions— 
“Looked over his left shoulder” (considered unlucky). 
“Out of the lady’s grave grew a bonny red rose, 
And out of the knight’s a brier.”” . 
There was a beautiful old Norse fancy of plants springing from the graves 
of star-crossed lovers, and signifying by the intertwining of stems and leaves 
that an earthly passion has not been extinguished by death. 
8. Noted the repetitions. 
9. Children named words and phrases they liked. 
10. Seat work:— 
a. Illustrated a line or lines of the poem. 
b. Wrote the ballads in prose form. 
Examples of the “‘traditionary” ballad are Sir Patrick Spens and Chevy Chase, 
both of which are adapted to the fifth grade. We studied these two in detail. 
After such a course of study lessons we were ready to write a ballad. We used 
Pyle’s Robin Hood as a basis for our ballad and the typical ballad metre as shown 
in Sir Patrick Spens. The effort is a piece of co-operative classroom work covering 
a period of twelve English composition periods of twenty-five minutes each.

I 
Up rose Robin one merry morn, 
“For fourteen days,” said he, 
“We've had no merry jest or sport 
Save ‘neath the greenwood tree. 
Il 
“Tarry ye here, my merry men, 
Here ‘neath the greenwood tree 
Until that on my buglet horn 
I blow my blasts of three.” 
Ill 
Off toward the town of Nottingham 
Strode merry Robin Hood. 
At last he took a small by-path 
Led thro’ the dark deep wood. 
LV 
O he walked on and on he walked 
Till to a stream he came, 
And there he spied a single log 
On which to cross the same. 
Vv 
On farther side about to cross, 
A stalwart stranger stood. 
“Now let the better man cross first,” 
Quoth merry Robin Hood. VI 
“Now stand thou back,” quoth the 
stranger, 
“The better man am I.” 
“Nay that shall we presently see, 
When our skill we shall try.” 
VII 
Robin Hood stepped to the coverside, 
A stout cudgel fetched he; 
“Lo here is a good lusty staff, 
Now come and fight with me.” 
VIII 
Each stood his place for one good hour 
Sore bones and bumps they had, 
Till down went Robin, heels o’er head. 
I ken he was right mad. 
IX 
Quoth the stranger, “Where art thou 
now?” : 
Laughed Robin, “‘Afloating the tide! 
Now give me thy hand, good fellow, 
And help me to thy side.”

Then to his lips he clapped his horn, 
He blew his blasts of three; 
Through rustling branches came his men 
To see what his need might be.

VI. Standards for judging a composition (Briggs and Mc- 
Kinney): 
1. The first motive of speech, oral or written, is sincerity. Sincerity is being true 
to ourselves. We must report as we ourselves see or feel or think. Choose a sub- 
ject about which the child may have real thoughts or feelings and insist that he use 
words that are his own. 
2. Customs of the times and our language determine what is considered good | 
form in a composition. Find out what the best custom is, then form habits of 
following it without giving it much thought or attention. But to form these habits 
takes constant attention in the beginning. 
3. A composition must be definite in four ways: first, in subject; second, in details; 
third, in point of view; and fourth, in words. 
4, Sincerity, good form, and definiteness are helpful to interest but these are not 
enough. Some other ways of being interesting should be considered. A theme 
should be written with some possible reader clearly in mind and with the distinct 
purpose of securing and holding that reader’s interest, of making the thought clear 
to him, and of producing the desired effect in his mind. 
5. But even the added element of interest is not the end. The speaker or writer 
may tell about too many things and give too many impressions. Such a composi- 
tion lacks unity. Unity means that a composition tells all about one thing and is 
expressed in such a way as to give one impression. There should be unity of the 
subjects for composition, unity of paragraphs, and untty of sentences both as to 
thought and form. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES 121 
6. There is nothing so uninteresting as monotony. Variety in expression makes 
a subject interesting. A large stock of words and sentence-forms, and ways of 
developing ideas so that we may have them ready to fit any thought that we wish 
to express—all these contribute to the best literary style and help to make the reader 
conscious only of the thought. 
7. There must be coherence, or connectedness, throughout a composition. To 
coherent writing and speaking two things are necessary: (a) vital connection in 
thought, (b) clear expression of that connection. To this clear coherence of com- 
position there are five principal aids: 
a. logical arrangement or order 
b. wise use of connectives and words of reference 
c. proper subordination of the less important ideas 
d. forms of sentences 
e. avoidance of all blurring ellipses. 
VII. Technique: 
1. Forms of Expression—sentence: 
One of the first essentials to both clear thinking and clear expression is a sense 
of the form of the sentence. It'is a unit of thought as well as a form of thought. 
Imperfect sentences written by the children should be made better by the class. 
The following sentences show some types of children’s errors: 
a. Herbert Lansing is captain of our baseball team and the north pole has 
been discovered. (Combines ideas that are not all related; an error in unity). 
b. a. The woman is ill. b. She is the mother of the butcher. c. Meat has 
advanced in price. (The first two ideas should be combined in some such way as 
“The woman who is ill is the mother of the butcher.” And the third sentence 
should be omitted since it spoils the unity of the thought). 
c. I drove in a buggy until we were within a mile of the river, at that point one 
of the front wheels broke. (This is the ordinary ‘‘comma blunder.” The writer 
tries to tell two things but joins them as though they are one). 
d. There was tied by the door a large dog. Who jumped toward us fiercely. 
(This is the opposite of the ‘comma blunder,” and means the disjoining of ex- 
pressions that properly belong together. The phrase and clause can here mas- 
querade as a sentence). 
e. ‘Treasure Island” is as interesting as a dime novel but which teachers do 
not object to your reading. (An error in wrong co-ordination. When properly 
used and and but make for unity; otherwise they destroy it). (Adapted from 
Briggs and McKinney.) 
2. Paragraph: 
a. The independent written work of children in the elementary school should be 
limited to the one paragraph composition. 
Sheridan in Speaking and Writing English sets up the following general standard 
as a reasonable measure of attainment in written composition for the ordinary 
graduate of an ordinary grammar school: 
The ability to write with fair facility an original paragraph upon a subject within 
the range of his experience or his interests, using sentences grammatically complete 
and correctly punctuated, with correct spelling, and free from grievous grammatical 
mistakes. é g : ‘ i z f i. " : 
The chief reason for limiting the written exercise to a single paragraph is to assure 
sufficient practice in writing which a longer composition makes impossible, and to
-P-A-G-E-123
  
122 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
focus the attention of both pupil and teacher upon the smallest possible language 
field. 
It is nota quinn of whether clildren can ibe eeined to write longer paragraphs 
or compositions of more than one paragraph, although no large proportion of the 
teachers of the country have yet demonstrated that it can be done. The writer 
believes that even if it were possible to train all the children in the grammar grades 
to write a long composition and to write it well, it would be a waste of time to do 
it. 3 ee ae . : i 3 i : 
A good subject is half the battle. Children cannot be expected to write upon a 
subject about which they know little and care less. You cannot get blood out of 
a turnip. 
Children must be taught, therefore, to narrow their subjects. This focuses 
thinking, and establishes a single point of view. They must be trained to single 
out some particular point and work that up for all it is worth. i 
b. In cooperative work, including summaries such as grow out of geography, history, 
or other subjects, there should be a class discussion resulting in a definite plan of 
organization. While this directed work may involve the writing of more than one 
paragraph, it is far removed from the old fashioned method of teaching paragraph- 
ing. Paragraphing in the mechanical sense is high school work. 
3. Criticism and Correction: 
The first draft written work should be read and corrected by the 
children as far as they are able, working for the correction of only 
one phase of technique in a lesson. Better results will be secured 
by concentration upon a few points. Confusion results from at- 
tempting too much at a time. 
a. Oral Composition 
In planning for the corrective work in oral English, the teacher should keep con- 
stantly in mind the two fundamental ideas which constitute the aims of this work 
1. To arouse on the part of the child a consciousness of whether or not he is using 
correct forms of speech. 
2. To create a desire, on the part of the child, to speak correctly. 
In order that this work may be effective, it must be adapted to the needs of the 
individual class. Asa means of determining these needs it is possible for the teacher, 
early in the school year to take an inventory of the grammatical errors made by her 
class and to base her corrective work upon the results of the inventory. Since it 
is impossible to plan corrective work for the wide range of errors which will be found 
occurring in each grade, it is essential that attention be concentrated upon a few 
errors each year. Dr. Klapper insists that not above three to six specific bad habits 
of grammar and idiom should be attacked each school year in the average class. 
Leonard, in English Composition as a Social Problem, says, “It is evident that 
we must concentrate our force on one point, or very small and closely related group of 
points, for a far longer time than we generally do at present, instead of attacking 
several at once, diffusing attention, and confusing our pupils. 
The definite plan for taking the inventory of grammatical errors which was first 
used in our schools in October, 1919, proved so helpful that it has become a part 
of the regular procedure in beginning each year’s work in English. The following 
outline should be used as a guide by each teacher in taking this inventory in October 
of each year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES 123 
INVENTORY OF GRAMMATICAL ERRORS 
GRADES I—VIII 
Purposes: 
1. To aid you to list the oral errors that are made by the pupils in your class. 
2. To enable you to select from this list, the errors upon which your class needs 
intensive drill this year. 
3. To have material available for the “‘ National Better Speech Week” in Novem- 
ber, during which a drive will be made to arouse interest in “Better Speech.” 
4. To furnish a basis for judging improvement in oral language in your class this 
year. This will be possible by comparison of the results of this inventory with 
the results of the inventory you will be asked to take next June, after intensive 
work on the errors selected. 
Important: For convenient reference you are asked to keep on file in your school 
room the list of errors noted. 
I. METHOD oF COLLECTING DATA—To COVER A PERIOD OF Two WEEKS 
(PREFERABLY THE FIRST TWO WEEKS IN OCTOBER) 
Errors in Speech. 
All teachers of Grades I to VIII should keep at hand a book in which to record 
oral errors made either during intermission or class time. In order to secure a 
representative list of errors that will show the real ability of your pupils in oral 
speech, it will be necessary that you listen carefully to the conversation of the children 
on the playground, and at other times when they are not conscious of being overheard. 
A teacher who has more than one grade in her room, as first and second, or fifth, 
sixth and seventh, will find it more practicable to keep a composite list of oral errors 
made by the pupils in her room than to attempt to keep a separate list for the several 
grades. The grades may then be combined for the corrective exercises. The re- 
cording of errors should be done unobtrusively so that pupils may not know that 
these lists are being kept. 
Important: In listing the errors, not simply the incorrect form of the verb should 
be listed, but the entire phrase in which the verb form occurs. For example—do not 
list the verb “‘done,” but “I done” or “He done,” not “‘seen”’ or “went,” but ‘She 
seen,” “They have went.” 
II. SELECTION OF ERRORS FOR INTENSIVE DRILL DURING THE YEAR 
The tabulation of errors in your record book should be similar to the following: 
Total 
I seen] 11111 11111 11111 15 times 
They had went] 11111 11111 One 
I ain’t got none] 111 tite 
Can I 11111 (11111 TO 2 
She has wrote] 11111 11111 11111 111 18 ” 
The above list is not complete, and will not be representative of your class, since 
other errors will be included and some of the above may not occur. It is merely 
suggestive of a convenient method of tabulation. 
At the end of the two weeks the total number of times each error occurred should 
be placed at the right hand side of the page for comparison. This will enable you 
to see readily the most frequent errors. You should then select for intensive drill 
the three errors which have the highest totals. This may seem to you a small 
number of errors to select as a basis for corrective work this year, but if you will  
-P-A-G-E-125
  124 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
assume responsibility for these three, and also concentrate upon the correct Bro- 
nunciation of words your pupils frequently mispronounce, such as, “get,” “just,” 
“such,” and words ending in ‘‘ing,” you will find this as much as you can accomplish. 
Next June you will be asked to take another inventory. The inventory then 
should show that the errors which are most common now, have practically ceased 
to occur in the ordinary speech of your pupils. This will be possible if you select 
only a few errors upon which to concentrate. 
In order that the findings of the inventory may serve a real purpose, the teacher 
will find it helpful to post in a prominent place in the classroom, the correct gram- 
matical forms representing the actual needs of her class. These grammatical forms 
will vary with the class and represent a modification of the course of study to fit 
the individual class. (Children of the grammar grades may print the gram- 
matical forms to be posted in the primary rooms). Attention of the children should 
frequently be called to these correct forms,and corrective work such as language 
games should be planned as a part of the regular routine of the classroom. Interest 
may be aroused by planning early in the year a “Better Speech Week” to initiate 
the annual campaign for the improvement of oral language. This week should be 
observed at the time set for “National Better Speech Week.” It is only by constant 
repetition of the correct forms that they will become habitual. 
Suggestions for language games and for observance of “Better Speech Week” 
may be obtained at the City Office. 
b. Written Composition. 
Mahoney in Standards in English gives the following plan for developing the 
pupil’s power to criticise: 
It should be the aim of the teacher to give to the children the power intelligently 
to look over their work with a view to bringing that work up to the standard of 
correctness. 
The first of these menciples ii is that here iise be some degree of progression in 
the work of correction. It is useless to attempt to correct everything in every com- 
position. No child should be expected to turn out an absolutely perfect paper. 
In the second place, it is well to remember that the object of correcting is not 
to mark the pupil, but to help the pupil. 
Third, pupils should be taught how to race ana How to “appreciate intalli- 
gently their own and one another’s work. Thus criticism by the teacher, which is 
indispensable, may be supplemented by efficient criticism by the writer’s class- 
mates. In teaching children how to criticize, teachers should have in mind a definite 
plan of development. Points like the following are suggestive: 
1. Read the composition through. 
2. Is it interesting? Tell one thing that made it so. 
3. Did he write as if he were interested in his subject? 
4, Did the writer keep to his subject? Did he put anything in it that was un- 
necessary? 
5. Were any of the expressions new to you? 
6. Mention any apt word that you noticed. 
7. Indicate a particularly good sentence, or sentences. 
8. Indicate a sentence or sentences that could be improved. 
9. Help the pupil to restate it. 
0. Correct grammatical errors. 
1. Correct mechanical errors. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES 125 
4. Habit-formation (Thorndike): 
“The trend of modern language teaching is to pay more and more 
attention to specific habits rather than rules. 
“There is need for speech that tells, there is need for speech that 
tells still better. The best time to form the habit of correct usage 
is the very first time the situation is met. Unconscious bad habits 
are hard to break. 
“Teachers tend to neglect experiences with words whose cor- 
respondent reality is not easily presentable; Ex., if, but, which, then 
. that, truth, even.” 
5. Rules: 
Rules grow out of experience and the following rules of grammar 
inductively formulated when occasion requires, will serve as guides 
in the speaking and writing of English. All of the rules included in 
the Baltimore County Minimum Essentials for the grades are found 
here. The few additional ones may be needed by the teacher for 
the pupils who are able to accomplish more than the minimum re- 
quirement. 
RULES OF PUNCTUATION AND CAPITALIZATION 
1. Begin with a capital letter the first and every important word 
in a title. 
2. Begin with a capital letter the names of things personified. 
3. Never use capital letters meaninglessly. 
4. When the explanatory words follow the quotation, close the 
quotation with a comma, unless it is a question or exclamation; that 
is, when the words quoted would end with a period if unquoted; if 
they would end with an exclamation or interrogation point, do not 
change these marks in quoting. 
5. When the explanatory words precede the quotation, set them 
off bya comma. Sometimes a long quotation is introduced by a colon. 
6. Use a comma to separate the words yes and no from the rest of 
the sentence. 
7. Use a comma to set off words in apposition, unless these are 
very closely united in-idea with the words to which they are added. 
8. Use a comma before-and, but, or when they stand between 
the parts of a compound sentence;-unless these parts are very short 
or closely connected in thought, or a heavier mark is needed. 
9. Use commas to set off words, phrases, clauses-thrown in or 
placed out of their natural order or somewhat separated in thought 
from the rest of the sentence. 
10. Use the dash to make a sudden change in thought, or in feel- 
ing or in sentence form. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  126 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
11. Use a semicolon to separate parts of a compound sentence 
when a heavier mark than a comma is needed or when the conjunc- 
tion is omitted. 
12. Use a colon to separate particular instances or examples from 
a general statement or summary. 
RULES OF GRAMMAR 
1. The subject of a verb is in the nominative case. 
2. A noun or pronoun used as an attribute complement is in the 
nominative case. 
3. The object of a verb or preposition is in the objective case. 
4, The compound personal pronouns are formed: 
a. In the first person by adding self to the possessive singular, 
selves to the possessive plural; 
b. In the second person as in the first; 
c. In the third person by self to the objective singular and 
selves to the objective plural. 
5. The relative pronoun Who refers to persons, Which to animals 
and inanimate things. That may have any antecedent, What takes 
the place of both antecedent and relative. 
6. The pronoun of the first person always stands last in a series of 
nouns and pronouns. 
7. The demonstratives are this, that, those, these. They may be 
used as adjectives or as pronouns. The personal pronoun them is 
not used as an adjective. 
8. If in a compound subject the nouns are connected by or or nor 
and differ in number or person the verb usually agrees with the 
nearer. 
9. Ought is a finite verb, not a participle, and therefore cannot be 
used with have or had to form compound tenses. 
‘10. May indicates permission, possibility, wish. 
Can indicates ability. 
Shall indicates futurity in the first person. 
Will indicates futurity in the second and third persons. 
Will indicates promise, threat, consent, resolve, in first person. 
Shall indicates promise, threat, consent, resolve, in second and 
third persons. 
Should and would-fottow the same rules as do, shall and will. 
11. The comparative and not the superlative is used in comparing 
two persons or things. 
~ 12. Modifiers should be placed as near as possible to the word or 
words they limit. No modifier should be inserted between to and 
its infinitive.

VIII. Tentative Standards and Minimum Essentials in Eng- 
lish in Baltimore County Schools. 
TENTATIVE STANDARDS AND MINIMUM ESSENTIALS IN ENGLISH IN BALTIMORE 
County SCHOOLS 
Sheridan, in Speaking and Writing English discusses Written English, thus: 
When the pupil comes to put on paper what he has to say, the situation becomes 
complicated by the entrance of factors which were not present when he was express- 
ing himself orally. He must think about his penmanship. He must watch his 
spelling. He must look out for his capitals, his punctuation, his indentions, and all 
that. These things become automatic, or nearly so, after years of training and 
practice; so that educated men and women are required to give little or no thought 
to their penmanship, spelling, punctuation and the other technicalities of written 
expression............ Strictly speaking, penmanship and spelling are not matters 
of language technique at all, since they are not developed primarily through written 
language. The school program provides separate drill for both. The failure to 
use capitals correctly (the period and the comma) is accounted for not so much by 
the supposition that these things are difficult in themselves as it is explained by the 
lack of careful training in oral language. The child who is trained from the first 
to speak in clear-cut sentences will after a while acquire such a strong sentence sense 
that he will seldom, if ever, write as a sentence a group of words that is not a sentence. 
Pupils write in the classroom as they have been accustomed to talk in the classroom. 
Failure to use capitals and periods in written composition is largely due to bad oral 
habits. If children do not possess the sentence sense, their written work is sure to 
contain many omissions of capitals and periods, and consequently many misuses 
of the comma. The teaching of written language, so far as correctness goes, offers 
but few difficulties over and above those which are met with in the teaching of oral 
language. H 
Realizing that the results of the work in composition throughout 
the grades were unsatisfactory to both teachers and pupils, an effort 
was made in 1917 to analyze the situation in order to make a be- 
ginning toward the reorganization of the Composition Course. The 
work was done by committees of teachers representing all grades of 
the elementary school. These committees found upon analyzing 
the suggestions in the Course of Study that the work as outlined by 
grades was vague. and indefinite, that there was much over-lapping 
in the requirements for the various grades; that neither teachers nor 
pupils had standards by which to measure each year’s achievement. 
The task then was to decide upon a definite requirement for each 
grade. This necessitated an intensive study of the actual ability 
and accomplishment of children of each grade, and the setting of 
grade standards reasonably possible of achievement. It also meant 
an analysis of the technique of the composition in order to limit the 
work of each grade to the specific elements needed to attain the 
grade standard in written composition. These committees evolved 
tentative standard compositions and lists of minimum essentials  
-P-A-G-E-129
  
128 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
which are now being used as a guide for minimum achievement in 
independent written composition. Independent work is the only fair 
test of a child’s ability in written composition. 
These standards are tentative only and form a working basis for 
the present. They will be modified in the near future as the com- 
position problem is gradually worked out. Each standard repre- 
sents the minimum requirement at the end of the year for the average 
child of the grade. Pupils will be found in every grade who are 
capable of work of a higher quality than that indicated in the grade 
standard. These pupils should not be restricted by the grade 
standard, but should be encouraged to do better work so long as 
they are held responsible for correctness in the points of technique 
listed for their own grades. 
These standards and lists of minimum essentials are of material 
assistance to the teachers in simplifying and making practical the 
work in composition. 
IX. Scientific testing for composition ability: 
Experts in the field of educational measurements are working to 
determine scientifically the composition ability of pupils of the 
various grades. For the results of some of this research work see:

FORMAL GRAMMAR 
I. Procedure: : 
The task of teaching grammar to young pupils is not easy. Its 
abstract nature repels, and its distinctions are sometimes difficult. 
There are certain problems which arise in the work for the solution 
of which the following suggestions are offered: 
j. “It is well to postpone the systematic treatment of formal gram- 
mar until the seventh year in school. It has been taught earlier, of 
course; but the immaturity of the pupil not yet arrived at the stage 
of development where the powers of abstraction are active, makes the 
work arduous and distasteful, if not futile. 
2. “It is very desirable that some of the elementary conceptions of 
grammar be taught early in the course, beginning not later than the 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—GRAMMAR GRADES +129) 
fourth year and gradually increasing the stock of grammatical 
knowledge until the subject is taken up as a systematic study. 
3. “From the first consideration of the parts of speech throw the 
emphasis upon function as determining the class to which the words 
belong. To say that such and such a word is a noun used as a verb, 
or an adjective used as a noun, is a needless confusion of terms and 
ideas. In English the word is what its use in the particular context 
makes it. Only by keeping this in mind can we get the desired atten- 
tion upon the logical aspect of grammar. 
4. “The work must be made concrete. Abstract conceptions are 
meaningless unless linked with the power to render them concrete. 
Keep principle and examples close together. Start by preference 
with the example and make it clear that the rule or the definition is 
only the formula, the description, and not the real thing. It is 
easier, for instance, to make clear the essential nature of preposi- 
tions and conjunctions by lists of them in use than by definitions. 
5. “There must be frequent repetition. Abstract ideas easily 
evaporate unless they are made a part of the very stiff of the mind 
and they become so incorporated not merely by explanation and 
example, but by long familiarity and frequent application. 
6. “The order of the procedure indicated above, that is from the 
sentence to the word, seems to be easiest for elementary pupils, 
though unquestionably they may be taught successfully by the op- 
posite order.”’—Carpenter, Baker and Scott, p. 146.

School Subjects. 
1. The conclusions drawn by Mr. Hoyt from this study: 
a. A critical examination of the arguments usually advanced in favor of the 
study of grammar leads to their rejection, in the main, when applied to the present 
teaching of formal grammar as a separate subject in elementary schools. 
b. It is therefore recommended that grammar should not be taught as a sep- 
arate subject in the elementary grades, at least below the eighth year. And that
-P-A-G-E-131
130 «COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
only such grammatical facts and principles be taught in these grades as have a 
direct bearing upon the use of language for expressing and interpreting thought. 
Such grammatical instruction should be incidental to the practical study of lan- 
guage, and should evolve from it. During the last year of the elementary course 
pupils should systematically review and organize the knowledge of grammar thus 
incidentally obtained, so that it may be permanently retained in convenient 
form for use, and as a foundation for any future linguistic study. 
To these is appended, by way of suggestion, an outline of such grammatical forms 
and classifications as might be taught in the elementary school. This includes: 
1. Classification of sentences: 
a. As to form: simple, compound, complex. 
b. As to use: declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory. 
2. Phrases and clauses. 
3. The parts of speech, with only such classifications of them as are actually of 
use; €. g., proper nouns for the use of capitals. 
4. Inflections: 
a. Singular and plural forms of nouns, pronouns, and verbs. 
b. Declension of pronouns. (Case and person developed in connection with 
personal pronouns). 
c. Possessive forms of nouns. 
d. Comparison of adjectives and adverbs. 
e. Principal forms of verbs, with little regard to conjugation, mode, voice, 
tense, etc. 
5. The more useful rules of syntax; e. g., A pronoun used to complete the sense 
of an intransitive verb is in the nominative case. 
2 Professor Briggs’ report on grammar: 
Whether grammar provides an important means of mental disci- 
pline, Mr. Hoyt did not investigate. This task was undertaken 
some years later by Prof. Thomas H. Briggs at Columbia Univer- 
sity. He made a survey of the claims which have been advanced 
for formal grammar as a discipline but found no experimental 
evidence to support them. 
' a, There was no gain in any ability which could be attributed to the work 
in grammar and surprisingly little, in view of the effort put forth, in the grammar 
itself. 
b. While the future experiments may lead to different conclusions, the burden 
of proof, at any rate, is now upon those who believe that general mental discipline 
is obtained from the study of formal grammar. 
3. Professor Charters’ report: 
a. More recently a study has been made by Prof. W. W. Charters, 
of the University of Missouri, which seems likely to be of considerable 
value in making out courses for schools. This was an investigation 
to determine what errors connected with grammatical rules were 
made by the children of Kansas City, and to determine upon this 
basis what rules should be taught to children in the elementary 
grades.

b. The language tests in use in the Kansas City schools were 
next examined and a statement prepared to show what might be 
omitted from them. The topics included in this “Index Expur- 
gatorius Grammaticus” are: 
(Exclamatory sentence. 
Mnterjection. 
The appositive. 
The nominative of exclamation. 
The nominative of address. 
The objective complement. 
The objective used as a substantive. 
The adverbial objective. 
The indefinite pronoun. 
The classification of adverbs. 
The noun clause. 
Conjunctive adverbs. 
The retained objective. 
The infinitive except the split infinitive. 
Mood (except possibly the subjunctive of to be). 
The objective subject. 
The participle (except the definition and present and past forms). 
The nominative absolute. 
The gerund. 
Two topics needed to be supplied, the pronoun what and proper 
and numeral adjectives. 
c. “Positively the study seems to show that there are a number 
of grammatical principles which should be well taught. Among 
these are: (1) proper as contrasted with Common nouns; (2) the 
possessive of nouns; (3) the formation of the plural; (4) the inflec- 
tions of pronouns; (5) the uses of the relative pronouns; (6) the car- 
dinal and ordinal numerals; (7) comparison of adjectives; (8) verbs 
as to kind, number, tense, and voice; (9) adverbs as distinguished 
from adjectives; (10) idiomatic uses of prepositions and conjunc- 
tions; (11) placing of modifiers; (12) double negatives; (13) syntac- 
tical redundance, and of course; (14) the sentence as a unit. The 
number of failures to begin a sentence with a capital and end with 
a period or other proper mark was very large.”

The Trip to the Woods 
One day I went to the woods with my sister. We saw leaves, trees, birds and 
flowers. We stopped at a daisy field near a stream. We picked arms full of daisies 
and sat down to look at the things around us. There were all kinds of flowers, 
briars and bushes. The birds were all different colors. The grass and sky were 
beautiful. 
Laddie 
When Laddie was a puppy I bought him a little basket and he would run up and 
down the street with it in his mouth. He was just a little puppy then but he could 
jump a big hedge. He would take a paper from one to another. My uncle had 
some crackers that he liked very much. When he knew my uncle had them he would 
do many tricks to get one. 
May Day 
May and Alice were little girls of six years and they were twins. They wanted 
to surprise thei: mother and father on May Day. So they made baskets and filled 
them with flowers. About five o’clock their father and mother were sitting in the 
library when the bell rang. They went to the door and there was a May basket. 
I guess you know who sent it.

What Fun I Had Ice Skating 
New Year’s morning I went skating. At the end of the pond the ice rocked when 
we skated across it. Of course that was just where the boys like to skate the most. 
One of the boys started across slowly and fell in. They said I was scared to skate 
there. To prove that I wasn’t I too started across. I fell in and got my foot wet. 
Even though I did have a wet foot, the rest of the boys were scared to cross where 
I did. 
A British War Tank 
If you haven’t seen a British War Tank you have missed a very thrilling sight. 
About two weeks ago last Saturday I was standing at the corner of Wylie Avenue 
and Park Heights, when I heard a rumbling noise coming closer and closer. I 
looked down the avenue and saw the large British tank the Brittainnia trundling 
toward Pimlico Race Track. As it drew passed me my heart jumped as I thought 
of the great but horrible work it had done and would do. It drew nearer and nearer 
the track arousing excitement in everyone as it rolled along. Many people were 
there to examine and talk about it. 
Falling Overboard 
One day I was standing on the wharf at Fort Howard, I noticed that the govern- 
ment boat was coming in. I paid no further heed about it until one of the soldiers 
on the wharf called out, “Hey son, you’d better get back further or when the boat 
hits you take a nice plunge.” I started to heed his advice, when the boat landed 
and I went head over heels into the water. Fortunately I knew how to swim, but 
I wouldn’t have wanted to fall over if I didn’t.

In all formal grammar work the teacher must bear in mind the 
functioning of each part of speech, its part in oral language, its part 
in written composition. Just how far each part of speech aids lan- 
guage has been worked out by one of our teachers as follows: 
How Parts oF SPEECH FUNCTION 
Noun:

b. For correct plural forms in both written and oral work. 
Pronoun: 
a. For less clumsy construction. 
b. For correct number form. 
c. For correct person. 
d. For correct gender. 
e. For agreement with antecedent. 
Verb: 
a. For correct time. 
b. For agreement with subject. 
c. For use of correct verb form.

a. For enrichment of language. 
b. For better construction and arrangement. 
c. For correct comparison. 
Adverb: . 
a. For better construction and arrangement.

Training a Dog 
Whenever you try to train a dog you must first find out if he likes you. A good 
way to tell is to call him and if he comes right away, he has a little confidence in you. 
If you like to teach him to swim take him with you and he will swim because it is 
a dog’s nature to swim. You can most always teach a dog to do something if you 
do not hurt him for not doing the right thing. Give him something he likes very 
well, such as sugar or bread with milk on, when he does the trick correctly. When 
he finds you have good things for him he will do it correctly nearly every time. If 
he finds you have the things you give him comes from your pocket he will begin 
getting upon your lap and smelling around your pocket. It is nice to have some- 
thing in your pockets most of the time. 
_My First Experience in Climbing a Tree 
When I was away on my vacation last summer I thought I would like to learn 
how to climb trees. My cousin and I went out in the orchard to gather apples. 
I climbed up first then she came after me. We were up high getting the big rosy 
ones when we heard someone call us. She started down first and when she was 
half way down I lost my hold and tumbled down the tree, hit into my cousin who 
was near down and knocked her the balance of the way. We had to go home with- 
out any apples and with our knees all skinned up. 
An Exciting Experience 
The camp where I was staying during the summer owned a large motor-boat. 
We used it on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. There was only one person at camp 
that could steer the boat, and one day when he was away the boat was wanted at 
the landing. It was kept moored about three quarters of a mile away and had to 
be run that distance to the landing. My brother undertook to steer the boat up 
to the landing. Steering a motor boat is just opposite from steering a machine. 
My brother became confused and steered the wrong way and we headed for the 
bank. A hole three feet deep was made in the bank but no further damage resulted. 
There might have been several lives lost. 
For detailed discussion of these standards, see page 127, “Suggestions for the

revision of the Composition Course are included in this reprint 
(1921), but the work in Grammar has not yet been satisfactorily

outlined, the teacher of seventh grade should follow the text for her 
grade, emphasizing such points as contribute directly toward the 
attainment of the tentative Grade Standards and Minimum Essen- 
tials in English of Baltimore County. The following outline may 
be helpful to the teacher of seventh grade as a guide to the order of 
sequence in presenting the grammar work. *
-P-A-G-E-142
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—SEVENTH GRADE __ a (140) 
1. Sentence: 
Defined; modal classification—declarative, imperative, interrog- 
ative. 
2. Sentence divided into tts two major parts: 
Complete subject; complete predicate. 
3. Subject: 
a. bare or simple; b. modifiers of; this leads to recognition of 
noun, pronoun, infinitive, adjective and participle as parts of - 
speech; the adjective modifier may be either one word or a group 
of words (phrase or clause). 
4, Predicate: 
a. bare or simple; b. modifiers of; this leads to the recognition of 
verb, complement, adverbial modifiers (word, phrase or clause) 
and participle. 
5. Complement: 
a. object, b. attribute (objective complement may be omitted); 
this leads to the identification of predicate noun and predicate ad- 
jective as attribute complements. 
6. Further study of the noun: 
Use of the noun in a sentence as an appositive; term of address 
(omit nominative absolute); exclamation; classification of noun 
—common, proper, collective; inflection—gender, number, case. 
7, Adjective: 
(Word, phrase or clause) recognition in any part of the sentence. 
8. Further study of verb: 
Classified as transitive or intransitive; regular or irregular (cor- 
rect language forms help here and the rational use of the forms for 
present time, past time, and future time). The study of conjuga- 
tion (as such) should not be taught in this grade but should be re- 
served for the eighth grade if taught at all. 
9. Adverb: 
(Word, phrase or clause) recognition. 
10. Preposition: 
The immediate outgrowth from the study of phrases that are used 
either as adjectives or adverbs. ~

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IN WRITTEN COMPOSITION FOR EIGHTH GRADE 
1, TENTATIVE STANDARDS IN WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
An Exciting Chase 
One evening Ada came in the house and said that papa wanted me to get “Pet” 
and go after the cow as she had gone in the cornfield. I hastened to get ready and 
was soon galloping after the old cow. Pet was excited and if I didn’t have a time to 
stick on nobody ever did. That cow went down the row of corn and up another 
and I after her. Every time I went to head her off she would dodge. Well, I kept 
this up for a while when help arrived. We cornered her and she was caught. I 
almost fell off a number of times but I didn’t care, I liked it. 
On Hallowe’en 
At seven o’clock I started to get dressed for the Hallowe’en party. It began at 
eight. I dressed as a clown with my face painted and powdered. My suit was one 
half a bright yellow, and the other half a bright red, with white dots. I was soon 
ready and away. When I reached the house I saw clowns, Indians, angels, ghosts, 
Red Riding Hoods, Godesses of Liberty, colored women, fairies, gypsies and many 
others. They were very funny looking. Eight o’clock soon rolled around and then 
the fun started. Many pumpkin faces were lit up around the dark room. We sang 
and played games and refreshments were then served. We enjoyed it very much 
and I wish Hallowe’en would soon be coming again instead of just going. 
The Passing of the Soldiers 
Early Sunday morning about seven thirty o’clock, I was awakened by the sound 
of bugles. The boys were marching back to their camp. I sprang from my bed and 
got dressed quicker than ever before. It was a wonderful sight to see them, some 
in line, some in wagons, some driving army trucks, some on motorcycles, some on 
horseback, but what I liked best was the officers riding their prancing horses. The 
colored soldiers made a very good appearance and whistled and sang as they passed 
along. Many of the soldiers were tired, some having sore feet from walking. The 
boys from our town were seen also. The soldiers were given a rest of forty minutes 
right in front of our house. To be sure not all of them, for there were twelve thousand 
soldiers. The forty minutes soon passed and they were on their way again. 
For detailed discussion of these standards, see page 127, “Suggestions for the 
Teaching of Composition and Grammar in the Grammar Grades.’”’ The teacher of 
eighth grade should be familiar not only with the standards for her grade, but also 
those of the preceding grades.

II. Special Oral Work. 
An inveniory of class errors should be taken during the first two weeks of October, 
and from this inventory the teacher should select the three or four forms that occur 
most frequently. This will determine her course of study in corrective work for 
the year. Guard against attempting too many forms in one year, but aim for 100% 
efficiency in the few that are attempted. 
1, Grammatical Forms. 
Drill on forms which inventory shows have not been mastered in preceding 
grades. 
2. Drill on pronunciation and enunciation of words and phrases with regard to 
which children have careless habits of speech. 
For detailed plans for taking the inventory and suggestions for corrective work 
based upon its findings, see page 123, “Suggestions for the Teaching of Composition 
and Grammar in the Grammar Grades.” The teacher of eighth grade should be 
familiar not only with the minimum essentials listed for her grade, but also those 
of the preceding grade. 
FORMAL GRAMMAR 
The work on the revision of the Course of Study in Composition 
and Grammar was begun in 1918. The tentative results of the 
revision of the Composition Course are included in this reprint 
(1921), but the work in Grammar has not yet been satisfactorily 
graded for inclusion at this time. Until this work can be definitely 
outlined, the teacher of eighth grade should follow the text for her 
grade, emphasizing especially such points as contribute directly 
toward the attainment of the tentative Grade Standards and Mini- 
mum Essentials in English of Baltimore County. 
The following outline was prepared by Miss Mary J. Watson, of 
the Towson School and may be helpful to the teacher of eighth 
grade as a reference for the topics she presents to her class: 
I. THE SENTENCE 
1. Definition: 
Develop the definition through a discussion that should lead to revising the 
definition given in the text. 
2. Modal classification: 
a. Drill in recognition of the declarative, interrogative, imperative and ex- 
clamatory sentence. 
b. Definitions. 
3. Subject and predicate: 
a. Formulation of definitions by the pupils of the class. 
b. Drill in separation of simple and complex sentences into subject and pred- 
icate, as follows: 
The mild balmy days of autumn | are enjoyed by every one. Do | you | know 
why the leaves fall in autumn? 
The maples which today are all aflame | will soon be bare.
-P-A-G-E-146
  
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—EIGHTH GRADE e (140) 
4, Bare or simple subject: 
a. The essential word or group of words in the subject. Drill for the recog- 
nition of bare subject by eliminating all limiting or modifying elements in the 
subject. 
Illus. (The) song (which we sang this morning), (The Star-Spangled Banner), 
| is our national anthem. 
b. The bare subject is always a noun, or its equivalent: pronoun, infinitive, 
group of words used as a noun. 
Drill in the use of the infinitive, and groups of words (phrases and clauses) 
as equivalents for the noun as bare subject. 
Formulate definitions for the noun, pronoun, and infinitive. 
5. Classification of words or groups of words limiting the bare subject: 
a. Adjective modifiers. 
b. Appositives. 
c. Possessives. 
Drills in the recognition of the participle as an adjective modifier, and of 
the appositive as an explanatory word or groups of words. 
Formulate definitions for the adjective, participle, and appositive. 
6. Bare predicate: 
Definition: 
a. The essential word or group of words in the predicate, or the predicate 
stripped of all limiting elements. 
Drill for recognition of the bare predicate by eliminating all limiting words 
or groups of words in the predicate. 
Illustrations: 
(1) Some one | has called (the) stars (the) daisies (of the night). 
(2) I feel tired (tonight). 
(3) His sister | was called (his) (best) friend. 
(4) He | is growing (taller) (every) (day). 
(5) He | named (the) (eldest) daughter Elizabeth. 
(6) She | looks sorry for me. 
(7) (Why) do | you | turn pale? 
(Underscored words from bare predicate). 
b. The predicate verb is the essential part of the bare predicate. 
c. The word or words which together with the predicate verb form the bare 
predicate of a sentence are complements of the verb. 
Drill for recognition of the predicate verb and its complements.   
  
Illustrations: 
(1) The child | gave me (a) (beautiful) rose. 
(2) You | get angry (very) (easily). 
(3)-They | made (a) stranger (the) leader (of the band). 
(Doubly und underscored words are the the complements). 
7. Review: 
a. Drill thoroughly in the separation of sentences into the parts so far con- 
sidered. 
b. Drill in the construction of sentences which shall contain all the parts so 
far considered.   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  f£(140) COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
8. Predicate verb: 
a. Sentence drill for recognition of the usages of the verb. 
b. Transitive and intransitive verbs. 
Norte: Emphasize the fact that the receiver of the action expressed by the 
transitive verb is sometimes named by a complement of the verb and sometimes 
by the subject. Classify verbs in the former case as verbs of active form; and in 
the latter, as verbs of passive form. 
c. Copulas and copulative verbs. 
d. Predicate nouns and predicate adjectives. 
II. COMPLEMENTS 
1. Attribute complement: 
a. Develop the fact that in sentences containing copulas or copulative verbs, 
the verb complement explains or describes the subject, and is therefore identical 
with the predicate noun and predicate adjective. 
b. Develop the fact that some verbs in the passive form have complements 
which explain or describe the subject. 
c. Definition—An attribute complement explains or describes the subject 
of the verb whose meaning it completes. 
d. Through sentences containing attribute complements of varied construc- 
tion develop the following generalization: 
An attribute complement may be a noun, pronoun, infinitive, adjective, 
participle or a group of words used as a noun or an adjective. 
Tllustrations: 
(1) Glass is brittle. 
(2) The price of wisdom is above rubies. 
(3) Lead is a metal. 
(4) He seems a gentleman. 
(5) Giving to the poor is lending to the Lord. 
(6) He is to go home. 
2. Object complement: 
a. Drill in recognition of the object of the transitive verb. 
b. Class the object as object complement. 
Develop the fact that the object complement may be a noun, pronoun, in- 
finitive or a group of words as a noun. 
Mlustrations: 
(1) I ate an apple. 
(2) They wished to see me play. 
(3) I saw how he did it. 
(4) The child loves to play. 
c. In sentences containing transitive verbs with direct objects, drill for rec- 
ognition of the bare predicate. 
d. Develop the use of the indirect object and the bare predicate. 
To tell to or for whom or what the action expressed by the verb is per- 
formed. 
To form with the prepositions fo, for or of, understood, an adverbial mod- 
ifier of the predicate verb.  
-P-A-G-E-148
    
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR—EIGHTH GRADE g (140) 
Note: The indirect object is not classed as a complement by compilers of 
texts, but its name and indirect object relation would seem to justify considering 
it part of the bare predicate and classing it as indirect-object complement. 
e. Drill thoroughly in recognition of the object complement and indirect 
object. 
3. Objective complement: 
a. Drill for the recognition of the bare predicate in sentences containing an 
objective complement. 
Illustration—We | can (not) pump (the) ocean dry. 
b. Show that the verb in the bare predicate does not of itself express the action 
which falls upon the object complement. 
c. Class as objective complement the word or words which help the verb 
express the action which falls upon the object complement. 
d. Show that the objective complement is also used to explain or describe the 
object complement, and is, therefore, used either as an adjective or noun. 
e. Definition—The objective complement helps the verb to express action, 
and is an attribute to the object complement. 
f. Drill for recognition of objective complement.   
Illustrations: 
a. They called the child Mary. 
The boys chose Tom captain. 
The man painted the house red. 
You cannot pump the ocean dry. 
The mother rocked her child to sleep. 
The general commanded his men to shoulder-arms. 
g. Some one has called the stars the daisies of the night. 
4. Predicate modifiers: 
a. Modifiers of predicate verb: 
1. Adverbs. ° 
2. Words or groups of words used as adverbs. 
b. Modifiers of complements: 
1. Adjective modifiers, or modifiers of noun complements. 
Illustration—John Adams was (the) (second) president (of the United 
States). 
c. Adverbial modifiers, or modifiers of adjective complements. 
Illustration—The flower is (very) beautiful. 
d. Possessive modifiers. 
Illustration—To draw true beauty shows a (master’s) hand. 
The Turks called (their) ruler a sultan. 
5. Modifiers of modifiers in both subject and predicate are either adjective or 
adverbial. 
6. Phrases and clauses: 
Class summary of the uses of the groups of related words in a sentence. 
a. Subject: 
Illustration—Where he is | is not known. 
b. Complement. 
Iilustration—Life | is what we make it. 0 oo! 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
    h (140) COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
The man | told the boy to do the work. 
I | do not know when he came. 
c. Adjective modifiers. 
d. Adverbial modifiers. 
e. Appositives. 
Iliustration—The popular idea that water is purified by freezing | is a 
mistake. 
III. SumMaRy CONCLUSION 
1. The groups of related words found in sentences are used as adjectives, adverbs, 
or nouns. 
2. Groups of words containing a subject and predicate and having the use in a 
sentence of a single word are called clauses. 
3. Clauses are classified as follows: 
Adjective. 
Adverbial. 
Noun o substantive. 
4, Groups of words not containing a subject and predicate and having the use in 
_ a sentence of a single word, are called phrases. 
5. Classification of phrases: 
a. According to use: 
Adjec ive, adverbial, noun or substantive 
b. According to form:

Infinitive—I want to do my work. 
IV. CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES ACCORDING TO FORM 
1. Sentence drill for recognition of the following differences in the form of sen- 
tences: 
a. Some sentences contain but one subject and one predicate, neither of which 
contains a clause. 
b. Some sentences contain but one subject and one predicate, either of which 
may contain one or more clauses. 
c. Some sentences contain two or more sentences, any one of which may con- 
tain one or more clauses. : 
2. Develop definitions of the simple, complex, compound sentence and compare 
with the definitions given in accessible texts. 
V. CONNECTIVES 
1. Subordinate conjunctions, conjunctive adverbs and relative pronouns are 
used to connect the clauses of complex sentences with the words which they modify. 
Drill for recognition of character of the above connectives, and formulate 
definitions. 
Intensive study of the relative pronoun. 
a. Its threefold use in the complex sentence—substitute for the noun, con- 
nective, subject or object in the clause which it connects. 
b. Identification of who, which, what and that as relative pronouns. 
c. Drill in the usage of who to refer to persons, which to refer to animals and 
things, that to refer to persons and things.

equal ranks, are used to connect the sentences which forms a compound sentence. 
Drill for the use of the proper conjunction in the construction of compound 
sentences. 
Illustration—John is a student, but Tom isnot. (Correct). 
John is a student, while Tom is not. (Incorrect). 
VI. LINE ANALYSIS OF SIMPLE, COMPLEX AND COMPOUND SENTENCES

SPELLING: PRIMARY GRADES 
THIRD GRADE 
Introduction. Much attention and thought has been given to 
spelling in the last few years, and tests have shown that intensive 
work of a very definite kind should be done in the third and fourth 
grades. It is an economy of time to teach children how to study. 
Close concentration is demanded in the preceding grades and needs 
to be continued to establish-a habit which insures correct recall. 
The spelling ability of children of this age determines our choice of 
words. Fewer words are chosen and these should be well-taught. 
Not more than eight words daily and half of those review words 
previously given, and a still smaller number when the words are 
difficult, will yield better results. Good habits of spelling are estab- 
lished by much reading, seeing the word correctly, by knowing what 
the word means, by learning to be annoyed or satisfied with the 
appearance of a word. 
There are three lists from which words should be selected, viz., a 
class list, consisting of words needed in written composition; an indi- 
vidual list, words commonly misspelled; the grade list, words which 
may be considered the common stock of words of the grade. Some 
of the words of the first list would necessarily be transient; words 
selected from the second and third lists should comprise those which 
become a permanent possession. About three hundred words should 
be added to the permanent vocabulary by the end of the third year, 
giving a pupil entering the fourth grade command of about eight 
hundred words. The grade spelling list contains the basic words 
common to the speaking and writing vocabulary. Most of the words 
with few exceptions are found in the spelling text for the grade, there- 
fore, the children of the third grade should be held responsible for 
these words. 
This, in no sense, interferes with the established practice of the 
presentation of words in relation to a definite need as occasion de- 
mands in written work, or in exercises for special drill. Word col- 
lections based upon phonic and other criteria, word building, and 
dictionary making are emphasized and extended from previous 
grades. Spelling lists for the grade, and the Alexander Spelling 
Book need to be used regularly in both oral and written work, as a 
means for testing the children’s spelling ability.

-P-A-G-E-153
  142 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Types of Lessons. Lessons in spelling consist of two types: 
study, and testing or dictation; and in this grade both can usually 
be accomplished in the same lesson. The aim is to train the pupil 
in habits of economical study, and to provide opportunity for further 
drill and tests in the use of words in independent written language 
work. While written spelling should receive most attention yet 
oral spelling need not be neglected since the pronunciation of the 
word, and naming of letters in order, observing the break at the 
end of the syllable aids in enunciation and retentiveness. Each 
child has the opportunity in oral spelling to hear the word repeated 
by members of the class which also tends to fix the word form in 
memory. At least five minutes daily should be devoted to rapid, 
snappy, oral spelling around the class, supplementing written work. 
The school affords many opportunities to socialize and standard- 
ize the work through class and interschool contests, through tests for 
a definite purpose, as the Ayres and Buckingham Tests, and through 
a record of the progress of the class shown in some graphic form.

‘ook. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. 
Material: 
1. Alexander Speller, Book One. Select lessons according to 
daily needs. Assign lessons for five minute daily oral drill from the 
text. Complete the text. Pupils held responsible for 300 basic words. 
2. Words selected from history, geography, nature, literature, as 
needed for purposes of written language: 
a. Words needed in written language; 
b. Word collections, phonetic and other criteria; 
c. Word making, using suffixes and prefixes; 
-d. Words requiring special drill. 
Method: 
1, Directed study. 
a. Study a word by a word whole. Proceed as in previous 
grade: write one of the words on the board, pronounce, give 
meaning often by use in a sentence, erase, and have children write 
and spell orally. Continue until all words are given. 
b. Train in discovery of difficulties by classification of eye and 
ear words. Some words require little or no study. Concentrate 
on parts of words which do. Oral and written work. Stupy LESSON
-P-A-G-E-154
bd 
  SPELLING—THIRD GRADE 143 
c. Train in syllabication. Call on pupils to spell by syllables. 
d. After the various words of the day’s lesson have been studied 
in this way, give a few moments for studying again the whole list, 
asking children to concentrate upon the words most difficult for 
them. Rapid oral spelling around the class, followed by dicta- 
tion for written work. 
. Seat study: 
a. Follow the same general lines indicated above. 
b. Teach the pupil to study the word, close the book or cover 
the word with a slip of paper, and test his retention, then compare 
with the text. Continue until all words have been mastered. 
Some words require little study, others more. Train pupils to 
find eye and ear words, and to make helpful associations. 
c. Make word collections or associations according to various 
criteria, as sound, pictures, objects, stories in history, geography, 
nature. Correct lists of these words should be kept for reference. 
d. Practice word making or word building, using a root word 
as a basis for word associations, keeping within the comprehen- 
sion of the child. 
DICTATION OR TESTING LESSONS 
1. Words studied under supervision or as seatwork should be re- 
called immediately by means of an oral or written test, repeated 
the following day, a week later, a month later, in oral or written 
work. Frequency and recency of recall insures the retention of 
the correct word form in memory. 
a. Column test: 
Words should be dictated by teacher; words recalled in 
order by children unaided by teacher; words used orally in sen- 
__ tences, soon to be embodied in a paragraph. 
b. Phrases: 
Place emphasis upon the meaning and appearance of the 
word in the related group of words. Valuable drill. 
c. Sentences: 
The use and appearance of words should be emphasized, but 
the isolated sentence, usually meaningless, violates good language 
habits. The sentences, therefore, should always be related to 
a central theme. After children are familiar with the paragraph 
through dictation, and the words have been used in oral con- 
struction an independent paragraph using words indicated, may 
be attempted.
-P-A-G-E-155
  144 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
d. Oral: five minute daily drill upon words commonly mis- 
spelled. 
2. The true test of spelling ability is found in the correct response 
made automatically under the impulse of thought in written work. m oS wo a. Dictation in language exercises emphasizes not only tech- 
nique but spelling as well. Preparation of words should be 
given whenever necessary. 
b. Independent written work: 
The first draft should be carefully scrutinized by the pupil 
and corrections made of any errors of which he is conscious. An- 
noyance is felt at the wrong appearance of the word only when the 
right form is firmly fixed through habit. 
METHODS OF CORRECTING SPELLING 
. The material. 
a. Choice of words dependent upon spelling ability. Some 
words have no place in a third grade pupil’s spelling vocabulary. 
b. Correct teaching of the varying types of words. Teaching 
words which seem easy, yet are constantly recurring in wrong form. 
c. Improvement in pronunciation, articulation, enunciation. 
. Recognition of types of errors. 
a. Substitution. 
b. Illegibility. 
c. Omission. 
Remedial work: 
a. Correct form given for comparison, and corrections made by 
the individual. 
b. Lists made of words commonly misspelled and used as a 
check and corrective by pupil. 
c. Improvement in writing. 
d. Daily, weekly, monthly review of those words which ap- 
parently are most difficult. Each succeeding day at least two 
words from the previous lesson should appear again. 
Socializing the Lessons 
1. Word games of a competitive nature, oral and written. 
2. Spelling contests in classes and between classes of a school, 
and representatives of schools. 
3. Time tests. 
4, Standard tests; Buckingham; Ayres.

tery of mechanical skill brings real enjoyment to children. Exten- 
sive abstract work in the fundamental processes in arithmetic, mem- 
orizing of prose and poetry, and an increasing accumulation of words, 
are in no wise irksome. Spelling may, therefore, receive greater 
emphasis in this grade since the children seem to eat up words with 
avidity. There is a marked advance over third grade children in 
spelling ability. This was shown in the Buckingham tests; the 
median for the third grade in Baltimore County was 50 per cent., 
while for the fourth grade the median was 76 per cent., a remark- 
able increase in power, nearly three times that shown in any other 
grade. 
The increased spelling ability of children in this grade demands, 
(1) a judicious choice of words, determined by the needs of the pupils 
in their written work, since we learn to spell in order to write cor- 
rectly, (2) a method of procedure which insures that the word form 
is clearly defined in the pupil’s minds; (3) and that the stress be placed 
upon written spelling rather than oral. 
To establish correct habits association must be made with correct 
spelling. Incidentally much reading tends to impress the word 
forms; linking the meaning with the word helps to fix its form, and 
the feeling of annoyance or satisfaction which the appearance of a 
word may bring helps to establish its identity. 
The choice of words. In each grade words are chosen to meet 
the needs of the class; a definite grade list of the common stock or 
basic words, including words requiring special drill or those common- 
ly misspelled; a class list of words used in relation to history, liter- 
ature, nature, geography and an individual list, consisting of those 
words which need personal attention. Wherever advisable spelling 
books or dictionaries are kept for purposes of review. In this, as 
well as the previous grade a spelling text is placed in the hands of 
the pupils. It contains the 500 basic words in addition to those pre- 
viously given for which fourth grade children are held responsible. 
At the end of the fourth year pupils should have a spelling vocabulary 
of about twelve hundred words. 
Method of procedure. Few words well chosen and well 
taught yield best results. Not more than ten words should be given: 
daily, and half of those review words previously given, and requir- 
ing added drill. In attempting to master a word form, attention 
should be centered upon one word at a time, followed by compari- 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  146 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
sons of existing likenesses and differences in word associations. 
Pupils should be trained to. examine a new word closely with a 
view to finding and mastering the difficulties that it may present, 
and should be trained to link the meaning with the sound and letter 
translations. Training children to study economically and effec- 
tively is the purpose of the study lessons in this and the preceding 
grades. For this reason ear, eye, and muscular or motor appeals 
are constantly made. Writing is one of the best means, since the 
muscular impression helps to fix the word in the memory. Written 
spelling emphasizes the use of the word as it will be used in every- 
day experience, but because we seldom make lists of words, col- 
umn testing is less valuable than words used in phrases, sentence, 
or the paragraph. Emphasis should therefore be placed upon the 
use of words in connected composition units, as exemplified in the 
short paragraph. 
Oral spelling should not be neglected, since it materially aids recall 
by naming of letters in regular order, by syllabication, and by giving 
opportunity for pronunciation. All the pupils are active in hearing 
the word spelled which is not true in written spelling. \ Five minutes 
daily should be devoted to oral spelling, aside from the occasional 
oral work done in connection with written spelling. 
Lessons consist of two types, as in preceding grades; the study spell- 
ing and the dictation or testing. Often both can be accomplished in 
the same lesson, but all study lessons should lead to economical 
habits of study in undirected seatwork. 
The school affords many opportunities to socialize and standardize 
the work through class and interschool contests, through tests for a 
definite purpose, as the Ayres and Buckingham Tests, and through a 
record of the progress of the class shown in some graphic form.

  SPELLING—-FOURTH GRADE 147 
a. Pronounce the word. Study it by the word whole written 
upon the board. 
b. Discuss and concentrate upon difficulties. Divide into 
syllables. 
c. Develop meaning; find a synonym or use in a sentence. 
d. Spell orally and write. 
e. Continue until all the words have been given. Give a brief 
time for concentrated study of the whole list. Erase, and dictate, 
or have pupils make independent recall unaided. 
2. Seat Study. 
a. Follow the same general lines indicated above. 
b. Teach the pupil to study the word, close the book or cover 
the word with a slip of paper, and test his retention, then compare 
with the text. Continue until all words have been mastered. 
Some words require little study, others more. Train pupils to 
find eye and ear words, and to make helpful associations. 
c. Make word collections or associations according to various 
criteria, as sound, pictures, objects, stories in history,. geography, 
nature. Correct lists of these words should be kept for reference. 
d. Practice word making or word building, using a root word 
as a basis for word associations. 
DICTATION OR TESTING LESSON 
1. Words studied under supervision or as seatwork should be re- 
called immediately by means of an oral or written test, repeated the 
following day, a week later, a month later, in oral or written work. 
Frequency and recency of recall insures the retention of the correct 
word form in memory. 
a. Column Test.. 
Words should be dictated by teacher; words recalled in 
order by children unaided by teacher; words used orally in sen- 
tences, soon to be embodied in a paragraph. 
b. Phrases. 
Place emphasis upon the meaning and its appearance in 
the group of words. Valuable drill. 
c. Sentences. 
The use and appearance of words should be emphasized, but 
the isolated sentence, usually meaningless, violates good lan- 
guage habits. The sentences, therefore, should always be 
related to a central theme. 
d. The Paragraph. 
Words chosen with reference to a subject afford opportunity
-P-A-G-E-159
    
148 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
for the use of the words in coherent, related sentences. Check 
certain words from the column list, which the teacher weaves into 
an oral composition and dictates to the class. Members of the 
class are called to make oral compositions, one short paragraph in 
length. When sufficient skill has been attained in seeing the 
words of the spelling dictation in relation to a simple theme, inde- 
pendent written work, consisting of one short paragraph should be 
given as a test of word retention. 
2. The true test of spelling ability is found in the correct response 
made automatically under the impulse of thought in written work. e w a. Dictation in language exercises emphasizes not only tech- 
nique but spelling as well. Preparation of words should be given 
whenever necessary. 
b. Independent written work. 
The first draft should be carefully scrutinized by the pupil 
and corrections made of any errors of which he is conscious. 
Annoyance is felt at the wrong appearance of the word only when 
the right form is firmly fixed through habit. 
METHODS OF CORRECTING SPELLING 
The Material. 
a. Choice of words dependent upon spelling ability. Some 
words have no place in a fourth grade pupil’s spelling vocabulary. 
b. Correct teaching of the varying types of words. Teaching 
words which seem easy, yet are constantly recurring in wrong form. 
c. Improvement in pronunciation, articulation, enunciation. 
Recognition of types of errors. 
a. Substitution. 
b. Illegibility. 
c. Omission. 
. Remedial work. 
a. Correct form given for comparison, and correction made by 
the individual. : 
b. Lists made of words commonly misspelled and used as a 
check and corrective by pupil. 
c. Improvement in writing. 
d. Daily, weekly, monthly review of those words which ap- 
parently are most difficult. Each succeeding day at least two 
words from the previous lesson should appear again.

SPELLING: GRAMMAR GRADES 
SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING SPELLING IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES 
Material. Material for spelling should be gathered from th 
daily lessons in reading, history, geography, arithmetic, industriz 
arts, music and drawing—and from the speller for the grade. Th 
lists in the speller should seldom be used as printed in the book, bu 
should be made the basis for the selection of words adapted to th 
experiences of the child of the grade, some words being discarde: 
altogether. 
A daily lesson might contain either visual or oral spelling; visual anc 
written dictation; written and oral; or all three; and the lessons i1 
the main should be spelling lessons studied with the children. To 
much of our work in spelling in the past has been testing spelling 
Now we must teach children how to acquire habits of studying spell 
ing. Study habits vary with individuals: the teacher must suppl 
enough study devices to take care of each child’s peculiar predispo 
sition: “‘earmindedness,”’ ‘‘eyemindedness,” “‘muscular mindedness 
(writing and nner speech). Besides this she must call attention t 
the several ways in which a single word may be misspelled. Sh 
must make children see words in relations, and word-building is neces 
sary for this. In fact, the teacher should spend about four-fifth 
of the time studying spelling with her pupils and one-fifth of the tim 
testing them. 
Let the spelling period be devoted to spelling, not language. Thi 
error on the part of the teacher has come from realizing the aid t 
contefit meaning of the word gives to the correct’spelling of the wor 
Selecting words from lessons where the use and meaning of the wor 
are known will obviate this difficulty. 
_ Drill the pupil thoroughly in his own misspelled words. 
“Text: Alexander, Book II. 
Time-cost. The daily lesson period should not exceed fift 
minutes. The teacher will remember that the acquiring of spelli 
facility is in relation to the general progress of the class, and that mu 
of the child’s time both in and out of school is spent in reading ai 
writing which fix his spelling habit. The progress in spellin: 
other things being equal, is dependent upon “‘the personal efficien 
of the teacher.”

SPELLING—-GRAMMAR GRADES f 151 
Factors INVOLVED IN THE STUDY OF SPELLING 
The main factors involved in the subject we call spelling are gathered together 
in the following outline. The phases presented should be understood by all teach- 
ers. A number of the important ideas here presented, are derived from lectures 
given by Prof. E. L. Thorndike, of Teachers College, Columbia University, on the 
“Psychology of the Elementary School Subjects” (1913). 
I. Srupy SPELLING. 
1. Directed study lesson. 
2. Child’s plan for study. 
3. Oral study lesson. 
4, Written study lesson. 
II. SUGGESTED DIRECTED Stupy LEssons. 
(Baltimore County alone is responsible for the ideas put forth in these study lessons.) 
The words may be chosen from textbook lists, or from the daily subject matter. 
In either case the class must have had some experience with the word before it 
becomes a subject for the spelling lesson: 
Procedure A: 
1. The teacher pronounces the word. 
2. Children identify it as one, two, or three syllable word. 
3. Proceed thus with all the words in the list. 
4, Pupils (individually) then dictate the same words, epphsdeing syllabication, 
while a number of pupils write them on the board. 
5. The teacher culls out the incorrectly spelled words in the board lists and pro- 
ceeds to study them with the class after writing them correctly on the board. 
6. The pupils tell how they misspelled the words. \~ 
7. They mark the difficulties. 
8. They syllabicate the words. 
9 They mark the accented syllable if the pronunciation has been difficult. 
10. The teacher erases the list and the pupils write rapidly as many words from the 
list as they can remember (many children at boards; all at seats writing, too). 
11. The teacher again marks for words misspelled. 
12. Each child then writes his own misspelled words in his notebook. (The teach- 
er records all the misspelled words in her notebook.) 
13. The class then writes the words in original sentences, or the teacher dictates 
sentences. ~ . 
14, For home study the children may choose a topic around which the words can 
be grouped and write a short paragraph containing as many words as it is possible 
to incorporate in the content of the paragraph. 
15. The next day these paragraphs are discussed in class. 3 - 
Procedure B: 
1. Have a list of words on the board (not more than tat five old, and five un- 
studied words). (The content of almost all of the words should be familiar.) 
2. The children will beat (by tapping) the syllabication showing the accented syl- 
lable by a stronger beat than the other, just as beating time in music is done. Ex. 
—removable’’ would take the beats: weak, strong, weak, weak or — 
3. The children (at board and seats) then syllabicate the words, and hierever 
confusion arises or a mistake is made, the dictionary is consulted. 
4. The spelling difficulties in each word are then discussed.   
   
-P-A-G-E-163
  
152 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
5. The words are erased and spelled orally in syllables, the teacher always re- 
quiring that the word shall be pronounced before and after spelling. 
6. The teacher dictates sentences containing the words; or the pupils write a 
paragraph containing the words, after choosing a topic for the paragraph; or the 
pupils dictate sentences containing the words for the class to write. 
7. The teacher and pupils then record the class mistakes and the individual mistakes. 
Procedure C: 
1. Pupils at boards and seats write a list of familiar words (for five of which the 
spelling needs to be reviewed and five new words) as the teacher dictates. 
2. The teacher marks the board lists for errors and the pupils at seats mark their 
own lists from the board spelling. 
3. The unmissed words are then eliminated and the lesson is concentrated upon 
the spelling of the incorrectly spelled words in the list. 
First, if any revieWed words were missed the teacher flashes these quickly. 
The procedure with the new words in this list is to test whether the children 
know their meanings. Then the lessson will go on in some such way as in Pro- 
cedures A and B. 
III. DICTATED SPELLING (REALLY A TEST). 
1. Column dictation. 
2. Paragraph dictation. 
3. Sentence dictation. 
. IV. METHODS OF CORRECTING ERRORS IN SPELLING. 
1. Avoid the old method of having a child write each word five times or twenty 
times until he knows it. 
2. Let a child correct his errors individually. For instance, one child may want 
to look at the word, note how he misspelled it, ahd how it is really spelled, then 
cover the word with his hand, and write it once only. To reinforce the new impres- 
sion, he might be told to write several sentences each containing the word to show 
how it can be used in different contexts. 
3. Another child might want some one to hear him spell his words after he had 
repeated the spelling several times to himself, The hearer might then dictate the 
original sentences containing the misspelled words, and together the two children 
night mark the words. 
4. Correction of errors should be as individual as the individuals; a correcting 
lesson is only another form of an individual’s study-lesson. Children study as in- 
dividually as they are made. 
V. SOCIALIZING SPELLING. 
1. To socialize spelling see to it that children never send out letters to classmates, 
business firms, or parents, about anything connected with school work, that have 
not been edited by several members of the class. If the spelling of any word is 
disputed the final authority is the dictionary, and all pupils above the third grade 
should know this. © 
2. Insist upon correct spelling as far as is practicable in all written work in school. 
3. Have the pupils make posters, print signs, write advertisements—telling of 
some school activities. Make them responsible for handing in correct spelling in 
these projects if they wish their efforts to be accepted. 
4. Clip out advertisements from the daily newspapers, of household, clothing, 
food, real estate and printing establishment sales, and base the spelling lesson oc- 
casionally upon these.  
-P-A-G-E-164
  
SPELLING—GRAMMAR GRADES 153 
5. Have inter-class and inter-school spelling contests. 
6. Work to have children feel dissatisfied with their poor spelling and to feel 
pleasure when they improve. 
VI. SELECTION OF WorD Lists FoR STUDY. 
1. Grade list: the text for the grade gives this. 
2. Class list: each teacher makes this from his daily lesson. 
3. Individual list: Each child keeps a spelling notebook in which he records the 
class list, and his own misspelled words. 
VII. STANDARDIZING SPELLING ABILITY. 
In May, 1914, the Baltimore County Schools were tested by the Buckingham 
spelling test. The median for our grades is given on p. 154. 
REFERENCES: Buckingham, Spelling Ability, Its Measurement and Distribution, 
Teachers College Publications; Ayres, L. P., A Measuring Scale for Ability in 
Spelling, Russell Sage Foundation. 
VIII. WaT Is SPELLING ABILITY? 
Spelling ability is a hierarchy of habits like arithmetic, language, reading, and 
spoken English. 
1. The hierarchy of habits in spelling means sound and letter translations linked 
up with meaning. 
2. Seeing a word correctly spelled, as satisfying; or incorrectly spelled, as annoy- 
ing is one of the habits that is potent as a control for good spelling. 
3. Seeing a word in ordinary reading strengthens “1” and “2.” 
4, An impression that is adequate for a child to get the meaning of a word is 
not adequate, always, to help him get the spelling. (Varies in individuals.) 
5. There is a spelling ability proper as distinguished from informational difficul- 
ties. (Hasn’t read much, hasn’t seen a word often, but spells it.) 
6. How shall we establish 1, 2, 3? 
a. Association must be made with correct spelling. 
b. Meaning is necessary (meaning makes a bond). Where pains are taken 
about meanings, more attention will be paid to the word itself. 
c. The satisfying and annoying feelings haven’t been taken into considera- 
tion enough. 
IX. SoME Factors TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION 
1. The behavior of words has received practically no attention. 
2. Pupils misspell words because their teachers do not realize the need of teach- 
ing them. 
3. There are various types of words and each type requires a different treatment. 
4, There is a type that does not need to be taught at all. 
5. There is a type which appears easy in the lower classes and hard in the upper 
classes. (Such words may: have been taught prematurely in the lower grades.) 
6. There is a type which appears to possess special difficulty in the middle grades: 
who’s (due to learning to use the apostrophe). :: 
whose. 
7. There are types of errors: 
Substitution 
Illegibility 
Omission 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
  154 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
8. Usually all words are taken as equal measures of spelling ability. 
Is this true? Try such words as: disappoint, necessary, changeable, better, 
because, whose, who’s, tomato, pshaw, grease, and see how many of the words the 
children in the grade will misspell, and in how many different ways the same 
word can be misspelled. 
9. Do you know how much one grade surpasses another in spelling? The Buck- 
ingham Test showed this for Baltimore County when it was given to our schools, 
May, 1914. 
Median for the grades: Third—58 per cent., Fourth—80 per cent., Fifth— 
86 per cent., Sixth—90 per cent., Seventh—94 per cent., Eighth—96 per cent. 
X. Most Worps ARE IN SOME Way SPECIAL. 
They are special in ways we do not realize. 
1. Very often they do not mean the same thing to one person that they mean 
to another. ‘ ; 
The same word is frequently pronounced differently by different people. 
. They suggest dissimilar imagery. 
| They connote variously. 
. They range from very easy to very hard—easy for some, hard for others. 
There are numerous ways of misspelling them. 
. One error may not be equal to another error in misspelling the same word. 
No spelling book has yet appeared based upon a study of how frequently 
children misspell the words of which it is composed. 
Every spelling book contains numerous words that many children know how 
to spell. 
XI. Wuat AFFECTS SPELLING ABILITY? 
1. Heredity emphasizes it. 
2. It is not closely correlated with arithmetic. Spelling is less intellectual than 
mathematics. 
3. It is not closely correlated with memory Memory is not a great factor. Some 
good spellers have poor memories: vice versa. 
4. We not do learn spelling once for all. The more we read the more we learn to 
spell. 
5. There is no close relation with visual imagery. 
6. There is a close relation between perceiving details and the ability to spell. 
7. Reading little, causes poor spelling. 
8. Test yourselves: 
Think of ten words you are practically certain you have never written. Find 
out how you spelled them. 
What tells you how to spell a word? “It is some relic of perception of the 
word that tells you how to spell it.” 
XII. Ways oF SPELLING. 
1. Advantages of oral spelling: 
a. The pupil always gets the letters in order. This is not true with the eye 
only. . 
b. All the pupils of the class are active in hearing the word spelled. This 
is not true of written spelling 
c. Oral spelling is connected with pronunciation: (1) pronounce the word, 
(2) spell it in syllables, (3) pronounce again. 
But don’t forget that oral spelling needs the bond of writing at the board. 
NOnARwn
-P-A-G-E-166
  
SPELLING—GRAMMAR GRADES 155 
2, Advantages of written spelling: 
a. Using the word as it will be used in life 
b. The printed form helps spelling. 
c. The typewriter will aid spelling. 
3. Flash spelling: 
A word flashed is not a visual image but it gives a percept of the word as a 
whole. 
4. Methods that have not been tried: 
a. When a person isreading, stop him, ask him to spell the last word. He can- 
not; then direct his attention to get the spelling as he reads. (This means lit- 
eral structure.) : 
b. Lower grades: Find a word that has the e sound; sh sound, ough sound. 
c. Upper grades: Have the pupils think words in parts as they read; be 
interested in words, their meaning and their history. 
XIII. CrivIcisM OF SPELLING BOOKS. 
(From Suzallo, The Improvement of Instruction in Spelling, Teachers College Pub- 
lications.) 
1. Does the book impose adult standards in the selection of words, and disregard 
the child’s use of them? 
2, Are the words taken from dictionaries, or from other school subjects? 
3. Are the difficulties measured by the number of syllables? (Words should be 
classified by their structure or phonetic elements, and their associated meaning or 
use.) ¥ 
4. How are the words classified? 
5. Are there too many words? 
6. Are the list words supplemented by contextual spelling? The lists should 
grow out of the context. 
7. Is the contextual material selected from interesting literary materials? 
8. Is there provision for testing spelling? 
9. Is there provision for word-analysis? 
10. Are spelling rules given? How are they treated? 
11. Are pictures used at all? 
12. What is wrong with—(a) Pronounce the word; (b) Spell it both by letter 
and by word: (c) Discuss the meaning; (d) Use the word in a sentence? 
It should be re-arranged in this way: (a) Pronounce the word; (b) Use 
it inasentence; (c) Discuss the meaning; (d) Spell it both by letter and by word; 
(e) Pronounce it again. 
XIV. SPELLING DEMONS: 
Doctor Jones calls the following one hundred words the “One Hundred Spelling 
Demons of the English Language” because he found that they were the words 
misspelled in all grades of the elementary school. These words should receive 
special attention: 
always coming heard. raise though 
among cough here road through 
"any don’t hear straight they 
again does instead sugar to-night 
ache done just shoes truly 
answer dear knew said used

The ‘‘arch-demons” of this list were found by Doctor Jones to be which, mis- 
spelled 321 times in the 7,500 themes; their and there, misspelled an aggregate 
of 612 times for the two, and separate, misspelled 283 times. 
. AIDS FOR IMPROVING THE SPELLING ABILITY OF CHILDREN: 
. Syllabicating, and marking the accented syllable. 
. Word-building. 
Marking the difficulties in the word. 
Interschool contests. 
. Interclass contests. 
. Better methods of teaching. 
. Incorrect spelling should be corrected in all written work. 
. The kind of drill should vary according to the school population 
. Patient and efficient use of grade list, class list, and individual list. 
10. Words in use in school and community environment should be used. 
11. Avoid lists that bring together words of the same combination: {ion or tain 
or ‘ture or cious. 
12. Keep homophones apart until association has been set up, then later bring 
them together for contrast. 
13. The dictionary habit is a good habit, and children must be taught to use the 
dictionary and how to use the dictionary. 4 WONATARWNE 
XVI. RULES FOR SPELLING. 
Pupils should be taught the importance of the rules for spelling and should be 
required to learn them after they have been taught inductively. All rules and abbrev- 
iations taught in one grade should be reviewed in the next higher grade. 
All sentences given by pupils as examples illustrating rules should be clear and 
to the point.

pendent upon its resources for food, clothing, and shelter, and othe 
related needs. How his physical environment aids or hinders devel 
opment, and what man has done to modify, adapt, and utilize hi 
physical environment, constitute the subject-matter of geography 
Therefore, a study of the earth without considering the life and worl 
of mankind would be dry, meaningless, and un-geographical. 
Purpose. The purpose of geography in the primary grades ma‘ 
be said to provide the child, through observation and experience wit! 
such fundamental concepts as will be helpful to him in the later grade 
when he is required to go in imagination to distant regions which li 
beyond the horizon of his observation and experience. 
Material. Young children are primarily interested in how w 
are fed, clothed, sheltered, transported, and only secondarily in 
why differences exist. Through the study of these related activitie 
as observed in the busy life about them many geographical facts be 
come permanent possessions. Much geographical content is pre 
sented in simple fashion in the work of industrial history and natur 
study of the first and second years which is organized and extende 
in the third year through two distinct avenues of approach, the first 
observational work or out-of-coor geography, the second, descriptiv 
or story work, of life in far away lands. By beginning with the nea 
and familiar types of industrial activity together with observation 
of physical conditions which affect industry, notions are given throug! 
which the children may image the remote areas beyond their vision 
Method. The method should consist{largely of discussions base 
upon edirect observations gained through excursions, and shor 
field trips to study at close range the various typical features in th 
immediate environment. A tedcher’s ingenuity will be taxed t 
find time forall the necessary excursions, but short trips at recess 
after school, and near the close of the school day should be planne 
with care, and occur at regular intervals. Observations in the stree 
after a heavy rain, visits to places by small committees under a com 
petent class-leader, or an older pupil, may be instituted. Oral re 
ports supplemented by crude sketches are valuable. Illustrativ

material, consisting of pictures, and interesting suggestive articles, 
together with blackboard sketches and simple records of ‘acts gained 
are necessary. 
When children have been taught to see physical features and to 
note the activities of people in the community, then they may hear 
stories about other lands, and lastly, a text may be placed in their 
hands, as a means to supplement the oral development work. This 
occurs in the fourth year. Simple supplementary reading material 
* should be used freely by teacher“and children in this grade. 
Geography books or portfolios, illustrating certain features, as 
homes, modes of travel, waterways, should be made by the class. 
Notebooks in which to record the simple outline, the statement of 
the problem, and the class story, should be kept by each child for 
purposes of review.

their games in the fall compared with ee of other seasons; their food and cloth- 
ing at different seasons. 
2. Effect of changing seasons sipon the occupations of people about them: with- 
in the home, in garden and field preparatory to approach of winter season. Re- 
view and enlarge facts gained in‘previous year. 
3. Effect of changing seasons upon animal life: first what the children already 
know, then direct observation to discover how animals prepare for winter—thicker 
fur, storing food, building houses. Migration of birds; what birds stay all winter; 
what ones migrate; why and where. 
4, Effect of changi ing seasons upon .végetation—first what children’ already 
know, then direct keéner observation of tte effect of seasons upon vegetable life— 
trees that lose their leaves, evergreen trees, those first toturn red. Dying’ down of 
plants; seed making. i . 
EX Observation of the sun’s apparent path across the sky; time and direction of 
sunrise and sunset, length of day and night; noon angle of the sun above the southern 
horizon on the autumnal equinox. After observations have been made, as the weeks 
go by,,call frequent attention to where the sun is rising, and setting, and where it is at 
noon, so as to bring out that the days are getting shorter, the nights longer, and the 
sun’s rays more slanting. 
TEE. Weather Conditions: 
1. Observation of weather changes; the object is to discover how change in the 
direction of the wind causes weather changes; what winds give us warm weather with 
clouds and rain; what winds give us clear or clearing weather with low temperatures; 
what winds give us the heaviest snowfall: Keep a weather chart, recording daily ob- 
servations. , . at 
2. Weather Reéords: ° 
Indicate upon a chart made upon the blackboard or manilla paper the follow- 
ing points: © % 
Date: appearance of sky; kind of day; temperature; precipitation; direction of 
wind. i *. 
Summaries are made weekly, monthly, both orally and in writing. 
IV. Maps: 
1.. Introduction to the study. of maps; the maps of the schoolroom, schoo 
+ grounds, and later the school district. Be sure in the use of these maps that pupils 
do not use symbols on the map until they know well the things for which the symbols 
stand. The children do not need to make the maps, but the teacher should have 
maps made to scale of schoolroom, school grounds, and regions in the vicinity; to be 
used freely by children in the location of well-1 ‘known places. These maps may be 
made on the blackboard, on manilla paper, orion tracing cloth. Often place map on 
floor or on large table for map reading with small group of children gathered around it. 
REFERENCE: Dodge, Home Geography, pp. 36-39. ss 
Ws Location and Direction: 
1. School-room map. — 
a. Let the pupils go to the map and point to the symbol for their own seat, 
teacher’s desk, window, and other objects. 
ee b. Let one child walk about the room, and let another indicate on map the 
course taken. 
c. Let them tell from the map the direction of various objects in the room 
from ‘the teacher’s desk. ~
-P-A-G-E-173
  162 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
d. Let the children measure.on the map and use the scale to find the distance 
various objects in the room are from each other. 
2. Neighborhood maps: 
a. Map of school grounds; of town; of vicinity; use again and again to fa- 
miliarize children with symbols; link location with direction, with scale. 
REFERENCE: Dodge, Home Geography, pp. 19-52, 11-13. 
VI. Surface Features: 
Type forms of land and water in the neighborhood are presented in relation to 
some industrial activity with which, children are already familiar through concrete 
experience. The study of what man hasione to provide himself with food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter, presented in the previous grade, leads to a study of the geographical 
aspects of environment. How man has protected himself from weather conditions, 
seasonal changes, and made use of his environment to secure shelter provides a ra- 
tional starting point. A study of Our Homes and Where They Are Built may serve 
as an introduction to surface features of the neighborhood. Then short field trips 
and directed observations of the landscape as children walk to and from school, and 
simple map readings tend to fix a few geographical facts upon which all industrial 
life depends. Introduction to type forms in the neighborhood: 
1. Our Homes: 
a. What home means to us; to animals and birds. 
b. Different homes; cottage, mansion, hotel, tenement, apartment house. 
c. Materials of which houses are built; where obtained. 
d. Compare our homes with: homes in hot lands, in cold lands; Indian homes. 
REFERENCES: Chamberlain, How We Are Shel{ered; Dodge, Home Geography, pp. 7-8. 
2) Groups of Homes: ® 
a. The home town: why location was chosen; roads and streéts, leading to 
the town, indicating names, kind of*traffic, modes of travel; nedrest large city 
and how town and city are connected. History and geography facts are closely 
interwoven. See History. &, 
b. Our city—Baltimore: its location; distance from the home town; com- 
pare town and city in relation to size, streets, buildings, occupations of people, 
transportation; reasons for living in a city. 
Projecis: x 
1. Collect pictures of homes in our own community and country; in far-away 
countries about which children have heard or read; homes of birds and animals. 
2. Have conversation lesson about homes of animals and birds with which the class 
are familiar. ; 
3. Map of home town made by teacher upon which children locate school, churches, 
post-office, stores, bank, and child’s home. . 3 
4, Have children name towns and cities which they have visited and tell something 
of interest, as, an incident, a public building, a beautiful street. Recall the names of 
cities mentioned in literature and history. 
5. Collect pictures of villages, towns, and cities illustrating street scenes, markets, 
homes, public buildings and occupations of people. Mount on bogus paper or manilla 
paper and keep in portfolios. 
6. Make cards for the Game of Cities, and prepare to play the game at a later date.

  GEOGRAPHY—THIRD GRADE 163 
Type land-forms in the neighborhood; plain, rolling land, hill, valley. 
1. Where Homes are Built. 
a. Homes on plains: the view; path or road; absence of hills; occupations of 
people—farming and gardening; towns. 
b. Homes on rolling land: the view—scenery; made by the hill, slope and 
valley; occupations of people—farming, gardening, grazing; roads to town; 
where towns are built. 
c. Homes on mountains: by means of pictures some idea of a home in a wide- 
ly contrasted environment may be gained but clearer concepts will be gained 
later in the study of the Mountain Maiden. 
d. Homes in city and country: compare one environment with the other; 
the view, need of parks in city; need of care and added beauty in country roads, 
lanes, and yards; pleasures in country contrasted with city pleasures; advan- 
tages of city—museums, libraries, art galleries; advantages of country — air, 
space, playgrounds; suburbs of a city. 
2. Where Cities are Built: 
(The surface of the land and water) 
a. Reasons for building on level land. 
b. Reasons for building near water. 
"Projects: 
1. Field trips, not necessarily long, to definitely study land forms, as, the hill, 
slope and valley. 
2. Committees for “‘sight seeing tours,” studying the landscape. 
3. Collections of pictures for the “Book of Homes,” Classify according to geo- 
graphical aspects, as plains, hills, valleys, mountains, town and city. 
4, A Saturday excursion—city children,to the country; country children to the 
city setting a definite problem in sightseeing. 
REFERENCE: Dodge, Home Geography, pp. 16-21, 32-36. 
VII. Occupations and Industries of the Community: Agriculture; Commerce. 
In the study of type industries which provide food, clothing, and shelter the geo- 
graphical aspects of the situation are presented, leaving to the field of Industrial 
Arts the history of the processes involved. As far as the children are concerned, there . 
is but slight differentiation, but in the teacher’s mind the two are distinct phases of 
the same problem. How man has used weather conditions, seasonal changes, and 
surface features in securing the necessities of life are important factors, and observa- 
tion work is just as essential in providing a rational starting point as in the study of 
weather, seasons, and land and water forms. 
1. The Farm or Market Garden. 
a. Corn or Tomatoes: 
In the fall make a study of the various crops—or center upon one; as corn or 
tomatoes, raised in the vicinity: the soil upon which they grow; the processes of 
gathering; the uses to which they are put; transportation to market, etc. In the 
spring note preparation of soil, planting and tilling. Note the relation of soil to 
crops—what is raised on sandy soil, loams, heavy clay, marsh or swamp lands. 
b. Soil—origin of soil; how rocks are crumbled; broken by frost action, 
weather conditions. [This may be left until spring, and be presented in relation 
to the raising of a best plant.)

c. Condition of growth—climate, rainfall, preparation for market; transpor- 
tation, care in shipment will be briefly considered when the region:is studied later, 
as “José in Cuba” gives sufficient opportunity for a few generalfacts about the 
taising of bananas.

DESCRIPTIVE AND PICTORIAL 
I, Stories of Child-Life in Other Lands: 
Emphasize the fact that people live differently because the environment is 
different. By means of pictures and vivid portrayal, and reading, enable the child 
to get concepts of physical environment for which his home region gives him no ex- 
perience basis, except perhaps a name learned in connection with some incident, which 
remains a mere name until introduced in proper setting. Make these pictures of 
other lands sharp and distinct by giving detail as to home, clothing, shelter, and 
means of transportation. ~Present countries in sharp contrast with our own and with 
each other. Bring out the physical aspects of each of these environments, climate, 
mountains, deserts, tropics, as conditions which are met in providing the necessities 
of life. Make comparison with our every day life. Do not use maps to show where 
these distant regions are, but make the subject so vivid through telling, reading, 
pictures and dramatic filay, that the concepts gained can be used to give meaning to 
the symbols for these regions when they are met in the succeeding grade-and used in™ 
globe and map work. . Familiarize the children with names of important places but 
be sure the name calls. up some significant detail. Say these countries are in Europe ; 
or Asia, across the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans. 
~ Some of this work will extend over the spring quarter. Since the reading ma- 
fecal furnishes much information the geography period may well be used to estab- 
lish the fundamental geographical aspects through summaries by the children, 
supplemented by the teacher. 7 Wg

FOURTH GRADE 
* The work of the Third Grade aimed to provide, through observa- 
tion and experience, a few fundamental geographic concepts which 
serve as a foundation for work of a more intensive kind in this grade.) 
(Home or out-of-door geography is continued. Observations of

seasonal changes, weather changes, the sun’s apparent path across | 
the sky are made less frequently but at stated intervals to test the 
child’s knowledge of the simple facts. An intensive study of the 
typical surface features in the immediate environment and its re- 
lated industry is supplemented by the use of the text. . The child, as 
a member of an industrial community, should have some respect 
for resource and production, for markets at horhe and abroad, and 
these general facts furnish a basis for a growing comprehension of 
social and enonomic life: This concrete. geography forms a basis 
for comprehending distant regions, since ohly by comparing and con- 
trasting the remote with the home region, can any appreciable cor- 
rect interpretation of life in far away lands be gained) 
Children in the Third Grade have become familiar with distant re- 
gions strikingly different from our own through the medium of stories 
told or read to them, which furnish a background for more intelligent 
work with the world asa whole. This work has served two purposes: 
(1) to teach those features for which the home region furnished no 
good example, (2) to give meaning to the symbols of distant regions 
when they are met in the globe study presented in this grade. 
This is the period when the memory is most active, and mechanical 
processes make appeal. _ It is the time to fix the basal facts of place 
geography, not by learning arbitrary lists, but by enriching the 
content and establishing the map habit. 
Globe and map studies. Globe studies and later, map studies, 
are emphasized through which the pupils gain power to read, and in- 
telligently interpret maps, and thus are able to place themselves in 
the world. This is secured by teaching them to interpret, by 
means of symbols, areas well known to them, as has been done in 
the previous year; and by emphasizing in every lesson the relation 
between themselves and the great world outside. 
An 18-inch globe and wall maps, together with the proper use of the 
small outline or base maps, give facility in map readings, and tend to 
fix in the child’s mind the main facts about the locations of the 
_ Various places studied in this grade. An abundance of material 
such as pictures, guide books, railway folders, postcards, products 
and interesting articles of manufacture, materially aid in increasing 
interest. 
In this grade the text supplements the oral development work 
giving the pupil in a clear, concise form what he has already found 
out through observation and experience. Training the pupils to use 
the text intelligently tends to insure good habits and secure good re- 
sults. The text is to be used by the children to re-inforce the 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  GEOGRAPHY—FOURTH GRADE 171 
teacher’s presentation. There is grave danger today that the child 
may become a passive listener to the geography lecture. A re-action 
on the part of the pupil is necessary. There should be a constant 
return from the pupil, and a discussion of facts gained through ob- 
servation and oral presentation, but a constant relation of the ma- 
terial of the textbook to the work of the teacher is also essential. 
He should be taught how to study the text, finding the essential points, 
learning to interpret the pictures, and the maps as an aid to clarify 
and fix in memory the important geographical facts. There are 
great possibilities for laying the foundation of right habits of study 
in this grade. 
Supplementary books containing geographical content should be 
read extensively and simple reports made to the class. The work af- 
fords opportunity for good oral composition through clear, well de- 
fined summaries of the points gained in a lesson. 
Notebooks: Each pupil will keep a notebook as a supplement to 
the text, containing records of oral and written summaries and out- 
lines; illustrations, consisting of sketches or pictures; of base maps, 
indicating certain features. 
The Text: Tarr and McMurry’s Home Geography will be used to 
summarize the essential facts of a topic after oral presentation and 
for purposes of review.

IIT, Surface features. 
_Type forms in the neighborhood: plain, hill, valley; spring, stream, river, bay. 
1. Field work. 
Concrete experiences by means of excursions and map readings from simple 
maps of the vicinity are repeated and extended from the third grade. When it is 
manifestly impossible to undertake field work then the school yard, neighboring 
hilly streets, the flat surface of a field, the hill in the distance, must be used. Pic- 
tures are very valuable in extending the knowledge of children, but have meaning 
only through experience. Concepts of terms used in the text need to be clarified 
by seeing, as gentle slope, steep slope, valley, and others. 
Use whatever the landscape offers as a starting point for an intensive study of the 
typical surface features and its related industrial activity. Summarize briefly the 
chief points observed, and the points of difference between the surface feature studied 
and its widely contrasting areas, as plains and hills and rolling land; hills and moun- 
tains. Use the text and supplementary reading to verify the experiences of pupils. 
2. Extension of field work. 
Each locality offers opportunity to study type forms of land and water which may 
serve as the basis for study of types outside of the immediate range, viz., peak * 
mountain system, river system, desert. Stories told to children, pictures used 
the right use of the text insures the formation of correct geographical concepts. 
3. Outline or plan. 
In each school community the approach to the intensive study varies according 
to the environment. Two suggestive plans are presented, one indicating the study 
of surface features and the related industrial activity from the standpoint of the _ 
prominent type in the community, viz., the river; the other, the scenery, as varied by 
the plains, hills and valleys of the surrounding country. Close analysis shows that 
while the method of approach varies, the end is the same: i

countries are known. Keep in the foreground something which makes the place real. 
Form the habit of using the globe, as in locating the places mentioned in reading and. 
literature, history and industrial arts.

  180 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
II. Directions on the globe. 
1. In third grade children have learned to read simple maps of the home region 
on which symbols were used to indicate familiar facts of the schoolroom, school 
grounds, and neighborhood, and directions were indicated by an arrow that pointed 
north. Now they are to learn other symbols for directions. 
2. Develop the idea that direction symbols on the globe are meridians and 
parallels; that two places are north and south from each other only when they are on 
the same meridian, and east and west only when on the same parallel. Parallels 
and meridians help us to find directions and places; parallels run round the earth; 
meridians run from pole to pole; parallels help us to find places east and west; me- 
ridians help us to find places north and south. Drill on the use of meridians and 
parallels until the children are familiar with the names and can tell by various 
symbols the direction certain regions are from each other. Exercises like the fol- 
lowing: We live in Baltimore. What direction is South America, where coffee is 
raised? Follow meridian. What direction is China, where tea is obtained? Fol- 
low parallel. 
III. Latitude and longitude. 
Explain as follows: 
1. In reading maps of the schoolroom a pupil indicates that his desk is so many 
desks (or feet) east or west or north or south.of a certain point, or in telling of the lo- 
cation of a certain town in the community, it is so many miles east or west, or north 
or south of a certain place. In a similar way places are indicated on the globe by 
giving the number of degrees that a place is edst or wesi of the prime meridian, or 
north or south from the equator. 
2. Drill by having pupils learn to find location of places on globes and maps. 
Keep the problems within simple multiples of 10 and 15, as 60 degrees west and 40 
degrees north. - 
IV. Size of the earth: Scale. 
1. Every globe has a scale of miles. Review idea on the local maps used in 
third grade. 
Measure the circumference of the globe used. 
(Divide the number of miles in the circumference of the earth by the number of 
inches to obtain the scale.) 
Teacher gives the scale, as each inch equals 440 miles on an 18-inch globe. 
2. Let children measure the distance between places and find width and length 
of continents and oceans. 
V. Motions of the earth: 
1. Rotation. Give the names, axis, poles. Do not attempt to prove that the 
earth rotates but give instead some consequences of rotation, as (1) Succession of day 
’. and night, the day asa unit of time, and activities governed by the alternating periods 
of light and darkness. (2) Directions. North is toward the north pole, south to- 
ward the south pole. If there were no rotation there would be no axis, no poles, no 
directions. ' 
2. Revolution. Give the year as a unit of time as the day is the unit of time 
of rotation. Do not attempt to prove that the earth revolves around the sun, 
simply state that it does. Do not teach that revolution causes changes of seasons. 
Leave this for later grades.

GEOGRAPHY—FOURTH GRADE 181 
VI. Climatic conditions on the earth. ’ 
1. Previous observations and discussions of seasons and weather have" led the 
children to clearly fix the idea of the relation of steep rays to summer and slanting 
rays to winter.\. In imagination take children to places on the earth where these con- 
ditions are constant; to the equator, with constant steep rays and continuous heat; 
to the arctic regions with slanting rays and continuous cold; to places where con- 
ditions are variable. 
2. Heat belts or zones. Summarize the knowledge gained through stories told 
in previous grades and organize the facts in relation to the great types of climate in the 
world. ““Concrete and vivid ideas are gained by recalling typical days in the home 
region, e. g., the hot, moist climate found near the equator is often typified by some 
hot, sultry day in June followed by a heavy thunderstorm and downpour; by using 
pictures; by collections of fruits, nuts, grains, spices, woods, and arranging them to 
show the climatic conditions in which they grow. An outline follows which aims to 
gather up the facts gained the previous year, and aid the pupils to form a well- 
“defined picture of the region as a whole. Briefly consider the following regions: 
Cold regions; hot rainy regions; hot, dry regions; temperate region, as our own. De- 
tailed outlines for the survey of each of the regions are obtainable at the office. The 
following suggests the method of summarizing the material previously learned. 
Cold region: | 
1. Name of region; arctic, antarctic; name of continents or parts of continents in 
the frigid zone: Greenland, Northern North America, Europe, Asia. 
2. Location on globe. 
a. Zone boundaries. 
b. Direction and distance from us determined by scale, by use of parallels and 
meridians. 
3. Extent. Compare areas of land in cold regions with areas in hot regions. 
4. Climatic conditions affecting life. 
a. Sun’s path across the sky; day, night; northern lights; stars. 
b. Appearance of landscape: snow, ice, absence of vegetation; absence of civili- 
zation. 
c. Surface features: plains, hills, lakes, seas; frozen desert, tundra, steppe. 
d. Plant and animal life: names, habitat, characteristics; use. 
e. People and their occupations: homes, food, clothing, recreations, trade or 
exchange, transportation. 
5. Trading center; city farthest north, Hammerfest, i in Norway. 
e Exports to United States; whale oil, furs. 
Suggestions: + 
1. Pupils read ““Agoonack” in Seven Little Sisters. Children of the Cold by 
Schwatka, and The Snow Baby by Peary. 
2, Read or tell children selections from “Tent-Life in Siberia,” by George Kennan. 
3. Collections of pictures showing surface features in cold regions; collections of 
pictures showing imports from these regions, as animals for zoological gardens, for 
fur trade, curios for museums. .

image and understand other parts of the County. A map of the County should be 
used extensively and a simple outline map made by the pupils. 
Problem: 
Why is Baltimore County a good place in which to live? The solution of this 
problem requires that the organization of the material shall be kept simple and quite 
within the comprehension of the children. By this method of procedure, the essential 
points presented in the formal, detailed outline which follows will be co-ordinated 
with natural life relations. 
1. Location: in state, country, continent, hemisphere. 
2. Extent: shape, length, width, area; compare with other counties of the state. 
3. Natural features: 
a. Coast line; shore forms to include points of land projecting into the bay; 
bodies of water projecting into the land. Waters; Chesapeake Bay. 
b. Surface; plains, hills, rolling land, swamps. 
c. Rivers; Patapsco, Gunpowder. 
d. Lakes; Roland. 
4, Connection with Baltimore City and towns of county. 
a. Trolley lines, railroad lines, boats, jitneys.

7. History. 
Review briefly the work of the third grade. 
II. Journey Geography. 
In Third Grade children have been told stories of Child-Life in Other Lands » 
through which some geographic facts are gained. This work is continued in this 
grade but in a more definite way. By imaginary journeys to different parts of the 
world and comparing and contrasting the distant with the near, some definite knowi- 
edge of life in hot and cold countries, on mountains and plains, among civilized and 
uncivilized people, becomes a part of the child’s permanent possession. Strikingly 
different types are selected for study, one from each continent, viz., South America: 
The rain forests of the Amazon—rubber; Europe: The Rhine Valley; Italy or Rus- 
sia; Asia: China and Japan or India; Africa: The Congo. 
A general knowledge of the United States is obtained by studying 
the typical industries of each large section of our country, viz., 
agriculture, grazing and dairying on the western prairies and great 
plains; mining in the mountains; fishing on the seacoasts; sugar and 
cotton plantations in the south; and general facts of manufacture

and commerce in relation to these. Choose two sections for a some- 
what detailed study emphasizing this point of view, leaving the fuller 
and more complete treatment of the United States to later grades. 
Three plans are presented below showing the method of approach 
to the general geographic conditions of a country (1) through a study 
of its people, as China and the Chinese; (2) through a study of a typi- 
cal region, as the rain forests of the Amazon; (3) through a study of 
a typical industry, as sheep raising in the-Western United States.

THE RAIN ForESTS OF THE AMAZ0N 
I..A Great River—The Amazon. 
1. Origin of name—El Rio de las Amazonas. Discovered by Yanez Pincon in 
1500. Explored by Frances Orellana, and Europena, in 1540 who called it the Ama- 
zon because on its banks they saw a group of women who resembled the Amazons 
or women warriors of Greece. These people allowed no man to live with them. 
They fought on horseback and on foot under the conduct of a queen. They were 
very skillful in the use of the bow. The most famous Amazons were those who 
dwelt in Pontus. These built the city of Ephesus and attacked Attica in time of 
Thesus. They also came to the assistance of Troy. Their queen, Hippolyta, was 
vanquished by Hercules. 
2. Locatio’ (use map and globe). North of central pa-t of South America; in 
region of equatorial rains. Once said to be the great sea extending from Atlantic 
Ocean to Pacific Ocean. NOorTE: Lead pupils to see that Amazon River lies between 
50° and 75° W. Longitude. Since 1° equals 69 miles, 25° equals how many mi es? 
It also lies directly south of the equator, one of its three mouths being crossed by 
equator. Lead pupil to see that this is the cause of the great volume of water. 
River has same latitude from source to mouth. 
3. Size. 
a. Greatest river system in the world: 200 small streams empty into it; empties 
into Atlantic Ocean through three mouths; navigable for about 3000 miles; fed 
by equatorial rains; (January to June) makes surrounding country a swamp. 
Great tidal wave rises at mouth at full moon, called bore’ or pororoca by natives. 
b. Life in river: alligators, turtles, great quantities of fish. 
(1) Turtle: lays 100 eggs at a time; natives gather eggs for food; eggs covered 
with tough skin, yolk contains oil, natives pound eggs with sticks, pour water into 
mixture, oil rises to top when exposed to sun, skimmed off, boiled in copper. 
kettle, used for burning and cooking. 
(2) Manatee or sea cow: His both in fresh and salt water, swims nearly full 
length of Amazon.

  THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE GRAMMAR 
GRADES: SOME SUGGESTIONS 
“Tn the teaching of geography, as in instruction of every kind, the 
fundamental condition for success is that the teacher has so through- 
ly mastered the subject himself, and takes so much real interest in 
it, that he can speak to his pupils about it, not in the set phrases of a 
class book, but out of the fullness of his own knowledge, being quick 
to draw his most effective illustrations from the daily experience of 
those to whom he addresses himself.”"—Sir Archibald Geikie. 
In the Teaching of Geography in the Elementary Schools, by R. E. 
Dodge and C. A. Kirchwey, the following principles are advocated: 
We must bear in mind that we are teaching children geography, among other things, 
and also that we are teaching geography to children. Hence our plan must_be or- 
ganized from two contrasted points of view, always bearing in mind that while the 
work must be worth while at every stage, it must also be valuable as a whole in pre- 
paring pupils for the adult life they will meet out of school. 
I. The relation of school geography to the science of geography: 
School geography cannot be separated from the whole vast field of geographic 
knowledge. Therefore the small part of the field presented in the elementary school 
must be geography, as this term is interpreted by the geographers who have done 
most to organize the science and to show its unity, in spite of its close interrelations 
with biology, astronomy, history, anthropology, economics, and many other sciences. 
Geography must not continue to be what it has so long been—as taught in schools— 
a vast collection of more or less unrelated facts about things on-the earth; it must be 
a portion of the science of geography as defined by the authorities in this field. 
II. Geography defined: 
The’scope and content of geography is perhaps best indicated by the generally 
accepted definition: ‘Geography is the study of the earth in its relation to man and 
life;” or, more fully, “Geography is the exact and organized knowledge of the distri- 
bution of phenomena on the surface of the earth, culminating in the explanation of 
the interaction of man with his terrestrial environment.” 
Geography as thus defined involves, at any stage in one’s progress in the study, 
‘the consideration of the relations of two great subjects—the earth and man. The 
tudy of geography therefore means that the “causal relation” between life and the 
earth shall be constantly kept in mind and that the interactions of causes and con- 
sequences shall be increasingly brought out. This causal relation is the keynote that 
binds the several factors of geography together as a science. 
III. The unity of the subject: * 
The scientific definition of geography merely gives us a measure with which to 
judge the value of facts suggested for a course of study. 
From the educational standpoint there should be no break in the unity of geo- 
graphy teaching from the kindergarten through the university. At every stage the 
work should be so arranged that what has been previously studied is.a necessary 
foundation for the present work; the work of the moment must in the same way be 
based on the work which has preceded and lead up to that which follows. This principle 
(189)
-P-A-G-E-201
  
190 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
should be followed as closely when we are considering the relation of large units of work, 
like that of one year to another or of the secondary to the elementary school, as it would 
be in the organization of a series of given lessons on one topic or even of the principal 
points in one lesson. In the latter case we would agree that good teaching required 
a well-ordered plan. Why should not, this principle be followed as rigorously at 
all times, and for the same reason—because it is pedagogically strong. 
IV. The importance of geographic principles: 
Formerly we were satisfied if a child’s mind was well stored with the facts of 
“sailor geography” which he had laboriously memorized. The recent emphasis in 
school work of the reasons for geographic facts has come to the front because we have 
seen that while the facts may change in quantity they remain true in quality, inas- 
much as they are the results of certain world-wide general principles, as true today 
as they have been throughout all time. 
Example: Geographic reasons for the growth of such a city as New York or Chicago. 
V. The importance of a knowledge of geographical facts: 
“The emphasis of principles as being the more valuable part of geography, should 
not, however, be taken to mean that facts must be omitted in geography . 
There is a certain minimum amount of geographical facts that a pupil must know by 
the close of the elementary course. Some of these—perhaps a larger part—can be 
the outgrowth of careful causal work. The remainder must be gained through de- 
liberate map study and memory work. . . . The best summary of what is 
necessary on the fact side has been made by Professor Whitbeck [Results to be ex- 
pected from a School Course in Geography,” Journal of Geography, April, 1905, 
pp. 149-155] as follows: 
KNOWLEDGE OF LOCATION 
‘1, Given an unlettered map of the United States, on which the states are outlined, 
our grammar school graduate ought to be able to write the names of the states in 
their proper places. He ought to be able to do as much for the important divisions 
of South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. 
‘2. He should know the approximate location of the eight or ten best known rivers 
of the Mississippi system; three or four of the Pacific Slope rivers, and two or three 
of Canada: the three great river systems of South America; four or five of Africa, a 
half-dozen of Asia, two or three of the British Isles, of France, of Germany, and of 
Russia; also the Po and the Danube. He should, of course, know the rivers of the 
region in which he lives. 
‘3. He should know the location of such arms of the ocean as are highways of the 
world’s great commercial movements. 
‘4, He should know the location of those islands and groups of islands that are 
real factors in the world’s activities, or have a general historical interest. 
‘5. He should know the facts of position, direction of trend, etc., of the half-dozen 
most important mountain systems or mountain groups of North America; the Andes, 
Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, Caucausus, Ural, Himalaya, and Altai; the location of a 
few of the most frequently mentioned peaks, such, for example, as Mt. Blanc and Mt. 
Everest. 
‘6 There are a few capes that are often mentioned, such as Horn and Good Hope, 
and their location is worth knowing. 
‘7 He ought to know something of the location of some twenty-five of the chief 
cities of the United States, what those cities stand for in our industrial and commer- 
cial life, and the advantages of their situation. There are twenty-five or thirty 
foreign cities whose location should be definitely known, and also something of what
-P-A-G-E-202
  
GEOGRAPHY—GRAMMAR GRADES 191 
those cities stand for. In addition to these, there are fifty or more other cities at 
home and abroad whose names ought to be familiar to the pupil. It is sufficient to 
know merely in what state or nation these are located. 
‘8. The facts to be gained from a study of physical, commercial, and political geo- 
graphy must be acquired mainly through a study of the relation of causes to conse- 
quences. Not all the possible facts in any of these three great divisions of geography 
ought to be incorporated in school work. Only the most important, either as per- 
manent acquisitions or as a necessary part of the whole school course, can be studied 
in the elementary school. These facts are well given in almost any one of the latest 
school geographies and need not be itemized here. Care should be taken, however, 
that too many details are not introduced, for an overcrowded course is less valuable 
as a working basis than a meagre one. A teacher can develop a meagre course and 
make it rich and valuable, while an overcrowded course, which must all be covered, 
leads to a memorizing of mere skeletal facts without any comprehension of the vital 
connecting relations and principles.’ ”—Dodge and Kirchwey, pp. 6-12. 
VI. Judgment and power to use the facts: 
Besides these facts the pupil must acquire : 
1. The power to use these facts, to test theit accuracy, to be skep-. 
tical concerning authors who try to overthrow the principles taught, 
to use references, atlases, gazeteers, books of description and com- 
mercial reports. 
2. The power to test the clearness and accuracy of his own and 
other people’s thinking. 
It is necessary that the teacher in the grades (5-8) understand the 
point of view from which “Home Geography” and “The World as a 
Globe” have been taught in the third and fourth grades if he would 
build an intelligent course of study upon these two factors. 
VII. The use of the map (From Calkins: Course of Study for the Dis- 
trict Schools of Michigan): : 
For every region studied there is much information concerning position, form and 
boundaries, size, surface and drainage, that can be much better read from the map 
than it can from the text. This work should be done in the class and from good wall 
maps. The Sydow-Habenicht and Goode maps are excellent for this purpose. The 
work of map reading should be done at first under the teacher’s direction and ques- 
tioning. Organize your class into an imaginary exploring party and acquire in half 
an hour from the map information which required years of toil and the cost of the 
life of many a brave explorer to accumulate. As you sail in imagination up the Ama- 
zon or Nile or Mississippi, tell them by word and picture of the wonderful sights that 
would greet their eyes were they really sailing up those rivers. Make the symbols 
on the map speak of real rivers, mountains and plains. When the map has told all 
it can in this way, send the pupils to the text to read what it has to say. What it 
does say will mean something, even if only a repetition of what they have already 
found out from the map, because they are prepared to understand it. They will be 
surprised and delighted to know that they can write from the map as good and as full 
descriptions of surface and drainage as their text contains. Give them not one, but 
many chances to do this. Have them study carefully the text with the end in view 
of determining how much of the information given in the text could be acquired from _ 
amap.

VIII. The atlas or map habit (Calkins): 
It is quite necessary that the child should learn while in school the location of 
many important places and physical features. It was formerly supposed that this 
could best be done by map questions and by giving long lists of places which were to 
be located on the map and the locations committed to memory. Those who have 
come through such a process know how useless it was and how, as soon as the drill 
ceased, these unassociated names and places began to slip away until now only those 
remain which we have since had occasion to use. 
It is here suggested that instead of this abstract committing to memory, the teacher 
at this impressionable age start the pupils aright in the formation of the atlas habit. 
Whenever and wherever, in the preparation of a reading, history, or geography 
lesson, the pupil reads of a city, river, mountain or other geographical feature, the 
teacher should insist that he stop then and there and look up on his map the location 
of the place. Places located in this way have something with which they can be as- 
sociated and will be remembered the longer because of this association. If the habit 
of consulting the map can once be formed in the grades, it will solve once for all the 
problem of location of places in geography study. 
IX. The use of small outline or base maps (Calkins): 
It is not enough that pupils should read maps, find the location of places’ upon 
maps, and cultivate the atlas habit. Pupils should express their geographical knowl- 
edge upon maps. The map should be a means of geographical expression as well as 
impression. Pupils should make maps. This is usually done by having the pupils 
draw maps from memory. This practice has hardly a single argument in its favor. 
It serves to impress incorrect ideas of form rather than coriéct idéas because ptpils 
cannot draw correct maps and in thus drawing maps from memory the mistakes are 
fastened in the pupils’ mind as well as correct ideas. 
Instead of memory maps provide the pupils with small outline maps showing the 
boundaries of countries, the chief rivers, etc., but without names. If you wish to 
impress the shape of a continent, have the pupils trace over the coast lines with pen 
or pencil making them heavier. To teach rivers let them print the names of the more 
important rivers on the various rivers shown on the outline map. With colored 
pencils the pupils can color in the various countries whose boundaries are shown on 
the outline map, Symbols for cities may be located on the map and their names 
= printed. The use of these maps more than anything else will tend to fix in the child’s 
mind the main facts about the locations of the various countries, cities, rivers, etc., 
studied in these grades. 
In the lower grades pupils are interested in activity for the sake of activity but 
in the intermediate grades the pupils are interested in activity for the sake of the 
result they get. They will usually be delighted to fill in and use these maps. 
The sand table, if used at all, should be used only as a means of expression by the 
child, and not by the teacher as a means of teaching new ideas and concepts. If the 
child has studied directly some alluvial fan, gully, or valley, the reproduction of his 
conception of it is an excellent means of fixing the concept clearly in his mind. 
X. The use of text and supplementary readers (Calkins): 
In most existing textbooks there is a mass of information, some of which may well 
be acquired from the map and not from the text. To distinguish between these two 
cla ses of information is a valuable exercise. To distinguish between and bring out 
the important points from the unimportant, to drill, illustrate, explain and supple- 
ment the text, is the function of the teacher. Teach the child to extract the meaning 
from the printed page without committing it to memory word for word. There is  
-P-A-G-E-204
  GEOGRAPHY—GRAMMAR GRADES 193 
title in any text that needs to be thus committed. Don’t expect the child to know 
every city, stream, mountain peak and range that the text mentions. Let him lo- 
cate them on the map as he reads about them, for the sake of the atlas habit which 
you are to cultivate, but don’t expect that all will be remembered. Study the most 
important cities and physical features so thoroughly that they cannot be forgotten. 
Lack of space has made it necessary for the authors of grade texts so to boil down 
the subject matter which they present that it is little more than a skeleton of geo- 
graphic knowledge. To give life and interest to these dry bones of fact, the teachers 
and school boards are urged to provide the pupils with geographical readers. A single 
set is better than none and if the teacher can get it in no other way she.should pur- 
chase it herself and consider it as part of her outfit for teaching. The information she 
will get in this way will more than repay in satisfaction for the money invested. 
Clippings from newspapers and articles from magazines may be accumulated in un- 
limited quantities and at little expense. Every effort that is possible should be made 
to clothe the bare facts of the text with the life and interest which the study of geo- 
graphy ought to inspire. 
XI. The use of the project and the problem: 
Throughout the detailed outlines for the several grades, suggested 
problems for intensive study are given, and some projects are named. 
To write a guide book for France after France has been studied in 
the fifth grade is a project that will serve for summary and review 
. purposes. The following characteristics for a good problem in geo- ° 
graphy were formulated by Miss Mary Watson, seventh grade teach- 
er in the Towson High School; they were presented to a group of 
seventh grade teachers, discussed by them, and accepted as a standard 
for judging the worth of a problem. 
Characteristics of a good problem: 
I. It must be interesting to the pupils. 
1. This will be true if the problem grows out of some geographical relation in 
connection with some previous work in geography. Take, for example, the state- 
ments: 
“There are less than seven persons to the square mile in South America.” 
“There are nearly one hundred twenty-five persons to the square mile in Europe.” 
“Europe is the most densely populated of the continents.” 
From these statements the problem “Find out why Europe is the most densely 
populated of the continents,” can be deduced, and should be an interesting one for 
study. 
Again, if Asia has been studied, the approach to the study of Europe might be made 
by way of Russia or Turkey, for no study of Asia, no matter how cursory, should 
fail to arouse interest in either the great Russian Empire or in Turkey. 
2. It will be interesting, too, if it has grown out of some natural, social or political 
event happening within the child’s own experience. 
II. It must make the class think: 
1. This would necessitate the recall of geographical ‘facts already fixed from past 
geographical experiences. 
In developing the first big topic that would naturally grow out of the problem re- 
garding “Europe and its density of population,” the class might beled to recall the
-P-A-G-E-205
  194 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
facts learned about South America and the bearing of these facts upon the develop- 
ment of that continent; to make comparisons; and to form conclusions to fit the sit- 
uation in Europe. One would expect the class to decide that the first big topic in 
the study of Europe is: 
“The bearing of location upon development of Europe.” 
(2) It will necessitate the finding out of the “Why” and the “How” of facts and 
of geographic relations: 
It is not enough for the child to discover that when a country lies in the Temperate 
Zone it means the advantage of growth and development for that country. The 
mass of Europe lies in the Temperate Zone—He must also find out why being in the 
Temperate Zone means growth and development. He must work out for himself that 
acountry lying in that zone is in the path of the S. W. Westerlies, which are rain- 
bearing winds and therefore make the great plain region of Europe one of the most 
extensive agricultural regions in the world. He must know not only that the loca- 
tion of Europe is central in the world land-mass and that she is bordered by the At- 
lantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, but also that these factors have had great 
influence upon her commerce, colonization, settlement, and industries. 
(3) It will involve comparison and selection. 
The finding of differences is a*very important matter where generalizations are 
concerned. 
III. A good problem necessitates the gathering of information from texts, maps, 
graphs, pictures, observation, experiments, source material, individuals, museums. 
IV. It leads to the modification of generalizations or the making of new generaliza- 
tions, and the testing of those generalizations by application to specific situations. For 
example: 
The statement :— 
“England’s rich deposits of coal and iron have had much influence on her devel- 
opment and her population,” should bring out the generalization: 
“A country rich in coal and iron will be progressive. But so far China is an ex-’ 
ception to this rule.” 
V. It necessitates the study of many related problems. Examples: 
1. Why are Europe’s highlands an.advantage? 
2. How has Europe’s great plain region made for development and settlement? 
3. Why is England one of the most densely populated countries of Europe? 
4. Why is Russia one of the least densely populated countries of Europe? 
VI. A good problem needs maps, graphs, modeling, for illustrative purposes. 
VII. A good problem furnishes ground for discussion and debate. 
FIFTH GRADE 
Read ‘‘Teaching of Geography in the Grammar Grades: Some Sug- 
gestions,” pp. 189-194 carefully many times during the year. 
Consult your Institute lecture notes (1913, 1914, 1915,) taken dur- 
ing Mr. R. D. Calkin’s course in geography. 
In the fifth grade the continents are studied in a more logical out- 
line than in the fourth, and related fact accumulations are of great 
importance. In addition to latitude and longitude the names and 
positions of the windbelts of the world are studied. 
The subject matter here outlined is arranged on cyclopedic form ‘purely for the 
teacher’s convenience. It should be taught in any order the teacher wishes, She 
will of course be guided by the class-room project in her topic for the lesson attack. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  
GEOGRAPHY—FIFTH GRADE 195 
I. Principles of geography: 
“The pupil’s memory is now very active. Things learned at this 
time are long remembered. Now the child is learning the multipli- 
cation table in arithmetic. Now is the time to fix the basal facts of 
place geography, such as the names and locations of countries, 
cities, rivers, mountains, etc., but do not attempt to do this by hav- 
ing long lists of places committed to memory, but grow out of the 
regular work by the cultivation of the atlas habit and the use of base 
maps.” 
1. Globe lessons: (Calkins) 
a. Continents and oceans: 
In Comparative Geography of the third grade, pupils have had stories and de- 
scriptions of regions selected from all continents. The first step in globe lessons 
should be to develop the idea that we live on a round earth and that its surface is 
divided into large land masses called continents and large/ bodies of water called 
oceans. As the teacher points to the symbols for the continents and tells the pu- 
pils that this symbol stands for the continent on which they live, or for Europe or 
South America, and lets the pupils tell what they know about these regions, the 
symbols will come to stand for real places in which real people live. Bring out the 
general shape of the continents, the larger seas, gulfs, bays and rivers. Drill on 
the globe until every pupil knows and can point out on the globe the continent and 
more important countries. 
b. Directions on the globe: 
In the maps of the schoolroom and school grounds used in the third grade, 
directions were indicated by an arrow which pointed north. Develop the idea that 
direction symbols on the globe are meridians and parallels; that two places are north 
and south from each other only when they are on the same meridian, or east and 
west from each other when on the same parallel. Drill on the use of meridians 
and parallels for telling directions until every pupil tells directions on the globe 
easily. : 
c. Latitude and longitude: 
On the maps of the schoolroom pupils have located their seats in the room 
by saying that their,seats are so many seats east or west and so many seats north 
or south from some other seat. On the map of the school district they have de- 
scribed the location of their homes by saying that they live a certain number of 
miles north or south and a certain number of miles from the schoolhouse. In 
a similar way places are located on the globe by giving the number of degrees that 
a place is east or west from the prime meridian and north or south from the equator. 
Drill, drill, drill upon this matter of latitude and longitude until every pupil can 
locate places where their latitude and longitude are given or find the latitude and 
longitude of places from the globe. Easy numbers, multiples of ten for latitude 
and fifteen for longitude should be used, such as 40° N. and 60° W. 
d. Size of the earth: 
Every globe has a scale of miles. It may be found by dividing the circumfer- 
ence of the earth in miles by the circumference of the globe in inches. The quo- 
tient will be the number of miles to the inch on the globe. With a strip of paper 
let the pupils. measure the distance on the globe in inches between many places
-P-A-G-E-207
  OG 
lea Lth. thrrrah RP. EA - eo. 196 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
and then change this to miles by multiplying by the number of miles to each inch. 
In this way have the pupils find the length and width of the continents as they are 
studied, and other distances. 
e. Motions of the earth: 
(1) Rotation. Do not attempt to prove that the”earth rotates but give 
instead some consequences of rotation such as: Succession of day and night, the 
day as a unit of time, and how our life and habits of work and rest are regulated 
by the alternating periods of darkness and light. 
(2). Directions. North is toward the north pole, south is toward the south pole. 
The poles are the ends of theearth’s axis. The axis is the line on which the earth 
rotates or turns. If there were no rotation there would be no axis, no poles, and no 
directions. Do not say to the children, “Up” for north, and “Down” for south. 
Say instead ‘North’ when you mean north and ‘South’ when you mean south. 
(3) Revolution. This motion cannot be proven to the children. All that can 
be done with it is to say that the earth does go around the sun and that the time it 
takes to do this is called a year. Above all things do not teach that revolution 
causes seasons when it is but one of the three or four different factors tnat cause sea- 
sons. Instead of trying to show the effect of revolution in helping to cause seasons, 
review how the long days and steep rays make the summers warm and short days and 
slanting rays make the winters cold as the pupils discovered in the third grade trom 
their observations. 
f. Climatic conditions on the earth. 
The basis for this work has been laid in ‘the observation study of seasons and 
weather in the third and fourth grades. Review what the pupils there learned 
from observation as to the relation of high sun and low sun to the warm tempera- 
tures of summer and the cold ones of winter. If the teacher will now carry the 
class in imagination to the equator and tell them where the sun rises and sets 
and where it is at noon at various times during the year, emphasizing the steep 
rays which always fall here, the pupils from their own experience with steep rays 
and a high sun ought to infer the hot temperatures of this region. Then carry 
them again to the “land of the midnight sun” with its slanting rays and low sun 
and let them infer the conditions of temperature there.. 
Teach the hot moist climate that is found in the doldrum belt near the equator, 
bringing in the daily rains of that belt. As typical of the weather in this belt some 
hot, sultry day in May or June should be selected in the home region, when in the 
afternoon there is a heavy downpour of rain from some passing thunderstorms. 
Contrast with this rainy belt the hot, dry regions on either side over which tne 
trade winds blow making such deserts as Sahara, Kalahari, and the one in Australia. 
Now contrast with the uniformly hot and dry climate of the deserts or uniformly 
hot and moist climate of the doldrum belt, the variable weather of the temperate 
zone as it has been observed by the child. Yet, even with all its variations and 
changeableness there are certain types of weather prevailing for a short time in 
every district of the state which may well characterize all the great types of climate 
in the world. 
II. Fact geography and continent study: 
Approach the study of each continent through the physical map. 
Teach the continents as the homes of the many people of other 
lands studied in lower grades
-P-A-G-E-208
  GEOGRAPHY—FIFTH GRADE 197 ‘ 
Use pictures, lantern slides, and other illustrative material to 
make the study as vivid as possible. 
Avoid treating the fifth grade child as if he were the seventh. 
Make the work largely fact work but related fact work. If problems 
‘are used let them be very simply treated. 
The following outline should be in the teacher’s mind when pre- 
senting the study of any continent to a class but the order of the 
topics is not arbitrary. Sometimes a continent might be approached 
better through the child’simmediate environment; sometimes through 
the study of pictures, with the industries, food, shelter, clothing, 
climate, etc., developed from the illustrations; but whatever the 
approach, at the close of the study the logical outline should be made 
as follows: 
1. Outline for study: 
a 
(1.) Position: in hemisphere; in zones; from continents; from oceans; between par- 
allels; between meridians. ' 
(2.) Form: relative; actual; as shown by map, with indentations and prolongations. 
{3.) Size: relative, in relation to other continents and to ocean areas; actual, number 
of square miles. 
(4.) Relief: primary highlands, position, extent, elevafion. 
b. 
(5.) Climate: winds over ocean or land, from warm to cold, or cold to warm lati- 
tudes; prevailing direction, whence it came. 
Rainfall—where and why; where not and why. 
(6.) Drainage—rivers, seas, lakes. 
c. 
(7.) Vegetable life. 
(8.) Animal life. 
(9.) Mineral resources. 
(10.) People. 
da. 
(11.) Distribution of population as dependent upon possibilities of productive occu- 
pation. 
(12.) Productive occupations as dependent upon resources, supply and demand, and 
commercial advantages. 
(13.) Development and location of centers of population. 
(14.) Development of commercial and trade routes. 
2. North America. (Studied as suggested.) 
3. The United States. 
Its sections: New England, Middle Atlantic, Southern, Central, WesternJlargest 
cities of each section; data to be drawn from newspaper reports; productive areas; 
study of the typical industries of each section from the geography point of view. 
Seldom does the study of processes in the industries contribute to geographical 
knowledge; these should be studied in connection with industrial arts which closely © 
correlates with geography, is

8. Australia, (Studied as suggested.) 
Ng. Correlate the geography with the other subjects that aid in explaining the social, 
industrial and commercial conditions of the life of man today. 
“10. Newspaper current events will include the whole world as the field of social interest, 
and may be made the starting point for the study of continents, countries, or 
industries.

SIXTH GRADE 
~ Read carefully ‘Teaching of Geography in the Grammar Grades: 
Some Suggestions,” pp. 189-194, many times during the year. 
Consult your Institute lecture notes (1913, 1914, 1915) taken dur- 
ing Mr. R. D..Calkin’s course in geography. 
The subject matter here outlined is arranged in cyclopedic form purely for the 
teacher’s convenience. It should be taught in any order the teacher wishes. 
She will of course be guided by the class-room project in her topic for the lesson attack. 
I. Principles of Geography: 
At the beginning of the sixth grade, when the second or advanced book is usually 
taken up, it is recommended that a more detailed study of the physical factors and 
forces of geography be made than has heretofore been possible. The attention given 
to this side of geography in the previous grades has been more to the securing of 
good, clear, mental pictures of physical features and the acquisition of facts than to 
the explanation of those features and facts. In this second study of physical environ- 
ment, emphasize the processes concerned and the forces at work in producing that - 
environment. (Calkins.) 
The sixth grade gathers into a detailed study of surface and climate 
all the facts that have been accumulating in the three previous grades 
and organizes these, showing the relationship between the factors of 
surface, climate, and the life of man. These facts are applied main- 
ly to the continent of North America—first to the continent as a unit, 
then to its different regions, and finally to its political divisions. So. 
life in North America as a whole, then in Canada, in Mexico, in Cen- 
tral America, and in the United States and its dependencies is seen 
in relationship to (1) position, form, size, and surface; (2) climate; (3) 
vegetation; (4) occupation; (5) distribution of population; (6) com- 
merce. | 
Note. The greatest elimination of pupils from the grades takes place in the 
sixth grade. A child going out into the world with the geographical knowledge ac- 
“cumulated from the fourth grade through the sixth should have a real equipment 
to start with in life. 
T. Physical geography (Calkins): 
~ In most texts used this work will include the following topics: 
1. Shape and size of the earth: 
* Some proofs of the earth’s shape may now be given with hopes of their being un- 
derstood. Sailing around the earth and the appearance of ships at sea, as usually 
stated, prove only curvature. State them so they prove equal curvature in all 
directions. Even here these proofs mean very little unless they can be actually 
experienced. Let the child see that the size of the earth is an important factor; 
that because of its size, and its great barriers of oceans and mountains, the people of 
the earth have been separated and isolated from each other; and that because of 
&  
-P-A-G-E-212
GEOGRAPHY—SIXTH GRADE 201 
this separation and isolation there have arisen differences of language, customs, 
manner and race. Latitude and longitude are measured in degrees and not miles, 
because the earth is curved. As we move north or south over the earth, new stars 
rise above or sink below our horizon and from their change of position we are able to 
find our latitude. 
2. Motions of the earth: : . 
a. Directions as a result of rotation. Réetiphasiae the fact that it is rotation 
which makes the finding of direction possible. Various methods of finding the north 
pole star and Great Dipper; shadow at noon; point the hour hand of a watch towards 
the sun, then half way between the hour hand and the figure twelve on the dial will be 
south; the compass points towards the north magnetic pole and not towards the true 
north pole. It does not always point north therefore, but in Michigan it varies but 
little from true north. 
b. Longitude and time—standard time; international date—Show how a 
spherical earth rotating causes the sun to rise and set-and cross the various merid- 
ians at different times, and how, by knowing this difference of time between places, 
we can find difference of longitude. Emphasize the fact that because the earth is 
spherical and rotates from west to east, sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight, and with it 
the new day, all come from the east, that New York has sunrise, noon, sunset and 
the new day before Detroit, and that the new day begins at the 180th meridian or 
the international date line and travels around the world to the west ending again 
at the date line when midnight reaches it. All of this, together with the length of 
the day, is a consequence of rotation. 
c. Seasons— 
In the third grade the pupils learned from observation that summer is warmer 
than winter because its days are longer, its nights shorter, and the sun’s rays steep- 
er. The explanation of why the days are longet/and the sun’s rays steeper in 
summer than in winter is too difficult to be attempted until now. It is believed 
that in connection with the motions of the earth it can now be shown why this is 
so and why we thus have change of seasons. 
3. The atmosphere: 
a. Its composition, pressure, etc. 
b. Water vapor. How it gets into the atmosphere and the conditions govern- 
ing the rate of evaporation; how it gets out of the atmosphere and the various 
forms into which it condenses—fog, clouds, dew, frost, rain, snow, hail. 
A common error in teaching the relation of mountains to rainfall is here to be 
guarded against. The usual statement is that the wind blows against the cold 
side of the mountains, is cooled, and its moisture condensed into rain or snow. 
If this were the cause the vapor would gather from the atmosphere upon the cold 
rocks as dew or frost and there would be no rainfall. 
Whenever a gas is compressed it is heated as one may see by noticing how quick- 
ly a bicycle pump becomes heated in pumping up the tires. When the pressure 
upon a gas is suddenly decreased it expands and becomes cool, as all know who have 
noticed how cool the air is as it escapes from the valve in a bicycle tire. Now, 
when air moves up a mountain slope it is rising into regions with less air pressure. 
As the pressure upon the rising air decreases itexpands and cools just as does the 
escaping air from the bicycle tires. It is this cooling which causes the condensa- 
tion into rain or snow. It is called cooling by expansion and is the chief cause of 
the cooling which produces rainfall everywhere. ©

c. Air temperatures: 
(1) How distribution of temperatures over the earth is represented on a map 
by isotherm lines. 
(2) Causes of unequal temperatures between the equator and the poles. 
(3) Causes of unequal heating of sea and land. 
CAUTION—The high temperatures of Western Europe and Western North 
America are due more to the unequal heating of sea and land than to the Gulf 
Stream and other currents. In winter the ocean is warmer than the land and would 
be were there no ocean currents. Winds blowing from the west carry these mod- 
erating temperatures to the west coast of Europe. If the prevailing winds blew 
from the east the British Isles and Newfoundland would exchange climates. Put 
the emphasis upon unequal heating of land and sea and the prevailing winds rather 
than upon ocean currents. 
d. Winds: 
(1) How unequal heating of the air causes it to circulate and winds to blow. 
(2) Teach thoroughly the location, direction of wind, and other characteristics 
of the following wind and calm belts: The trade winds, the doldrum belt, the 
horse latitude calm belts, the westerlies. 
Constantly be on the lookout for conditions in local weather which illustrate the 
types of weather found in these various regions. 
(3) Show how migration of these belts causes wet and dry seasons—as in California 
and regions near the equator. 
(4) Monsoons—due to unequal heating of land and sea in winter and summer. 
(5) Land and sea breezes due to unequal heating of sea.and land by day and 
night. 
(6) Cyclonic storms and how they control weather in the temperate zones. 
e. Weather: 
“Tt is time that the schools do something to destroy the superstition and ig- 
norance that prevail as to the cause of weather and weather changes. The moon 
does not control weather, there is no equinoctial storm, and no one can at present 
foretell weather accurately a year, or even a month in advance. Teachers should 
look up this topic and be able to explain the weather changes as they occur. Write | 
to the nearest weather bureau station and ask that the daily weather map be sent 
to your school.” 
4. The ocean and ocean movements: 
The oceans, their extent, depth, nature of their bottoms, wind waves, tides, and 
the chief ocean currents. The relation of wind to waves and to ocean currents should 
here be brought out. Show also how the currents generated by the winds are de- 
flected by the continents into their present courses. 
5. Rain and river erosion and land forms: 
Teach by observation in the neighboring fields how the water running off after a 
storm erodes gullies in the hillsides, how these gullies grow wider, deeper and longer 
with each storm until they are finally cut to the depth at which water stands in the 
ground when they thus acquire permanent streams. Show by example if possible 
how these valleys are at first narrow and V-shaped, often with falls and rapids and 
lakes in their courses; how in this condition they are said to be young valleys, but 
the side wash on their sides and streams in their bottoms destroy the falls, fill up and 
drain the lakes and, swinging from side to side, cutting on the outside of each curve 
and depositing on the inside, gradually widen the valley bottom forming flood plains, 
the valley thus passing into maturity and old age.. Take up the other erosional 
forms of the text found in the neighborhood and give the pupils as clear conceptions 
as possible of how the weathering and erosive forces sculpture the surface of the land 
into all its varieties of form.

GEOGRAPHY—SIXTH GRADE 203 
§. Glaciers and glaciation: 
Introduce them to the mountain and valley types of glaciers now existing in many 
regions, showing the various phases of erosional work of these glaciers, how they smooth, 
polish and striate the rocks over which they pass and how they form moraines along 
and across their valleys. Now search the clay bank along streams, the excavations 
for cellars and ditches, to find rocks in the home region which have been smoothed, 
polished, and striated by the glacial erosion, thus proving that their region was once 
beneath an immense ice sheet which brought and distributed over this region the 
thick deposits of drift upon which they live. In this grade when the United States 
is studied more intensively and in greater detail, give them some idea of how the 
Great Lakes and the thousands of smaller lakes in northern United States were pro- 
duced as a result of this glaciation, thus bringing out the relation of the effects of 
glaciation to man. 
7. Coast lines and the various forces and agents at work in changing them. 
II. Conditions that determine climate: A formation of the principles and factors in- 
volved. 
III. Fact geography and detailed continent study: 
1. North America: (an intensive study): 
a. As a whole. 
b. United States and its dependencies. 
. Maryland. 
. Canada. 
Mexico. 
Central America. 
. Outlying islands that are not dependencies. 
IV. The following outline is suggested as a point of view for working out a detailed study 
of the United States in the sixth grade: 
Look over the material on the United States in the textbook for the grade. Re- 
eee the material on the United States as follows: 
1. Physical regions: 
a. Appalachian region. 
b. Mississippi valley. 
c. Rocky Mountain region. 
d. Pacific coast region. 
2. Study each region separately. The following outline for the Appalachian Re- 
gion is a sample procedure— 
a. Let the children look through the geography, and tell on which pages the 
material for the Appalachian region can be found. (This will include the material 
on New England, the Middle Atlantic States, and part of the Southern States.) 
b. Let them again look at the graphs and illustrations on those pages and find 
out what prominent features of the Appalachian Region are there nied 
Make a list of these. 
c. From this list let the class decide in which feature it is most interested. It 
may be dairy products; or lumbering; or coal; or manufacture; or pleasure grounds. 
d. Then let the children try to formulate for the industry, or city, or physio- 
graphic feature (whatever it is they have chosen to study)-a problem that will be 
worth while hunting out an answer for. 
e. Then let-them decide upon what topics they must concentrate attention to 
answer the problem. é 
mean ow 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
204 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
f. Then either through the index or by reading through all the pages on the 
Appalachian Region let them gather the data for each topic they are to study— 
taking one topic at a time, of course. 
g. If a prominent city is necessary for the understanding of the problem, in- 
clude it as one of the topics, and study it in detail when it is reached in the outline. 
h. Wherever climatic conditions are necessary for the understanding of the 
problem, stop and teach any new element that is presented or review old ideas 
that seem vague. (Remember that fifth grade children should understand wind- 
belts and zones so that you do have something to build upon in the sixth grade.) 
Note: Things to do that you probably have not done before. 
a. Ignore sections by states.: 
b. Study an important city as you study its region. 
c. Parallel the study of type industries with the study of the region. 
V. Maryland; a detailed study: 
. Location in latitude and longitude. 
Area. 
. Physiography. 
Climate. 
Products. 
Occupations and industries. 
Commerce. 
Cities. 
Baltimore County in relation to the whole state. 
Baltimore City as a manufacturing and commercial center: its rank. 
a. Location. 
b. Harbor. 
11. Raw materials received into Maryland. 
12. Manufactures 
13. Raw materials and manufactured articles sent out of Maryland, 
14. Railroad lines. 
15. Steamship lines. 
16. Ten cities of the State besides Baltimore City. 
Note: It is not necessary to follow this outline strictly; the approach might be 
made by studying the state in sections, as is done for the United States. That plan 
would mean an industrial or commercial problem to be worked out for each section. 
VI. Aids to the teaching of geography: pictures, globe, graphs, etc. 
VII. Current events: the necessity for using newspaper and magazine articles.

GEOGRAPHY—SEVENTH GRADE 205 
SEVENTH GRADE 
Read ‘‘Teaching of Geography in the Grammar Grades: Some sug- 
gestions,”’ pp. 189-194, carefully many times during the year. 
Consult your Institute lecture notes (1913, 1914, 1915) taken dur- 
ing the course in geography under Mr. R. D. Calkins. 
In the seventh grade the explanatory stage of the work is reached 
and the children are trained to seek out problems that ask ‘“‘Why cer- 
tain effects are produced.” The statements of the text provide 
much of the necessary problem material that will serve as a stimuli 
for the questioning mind of the pupil. 
The continent,studies included in“this grade are South America, 
Euriope, Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is suggested that the teach- 
er should not expect to study in detail more than four problems on 
any one continent, except- Europe, and-that Africa and Australia 
are to be studied as the colonizing ground of European peoples, in 
the main. 
A detailed study of weather maps showing ih highs and lows 
cause weather changes and a detailed study of rotation and revolu- 
tion of the earth are a part of the work of this grade. 
The subject matter here outlined is arranged in encyclopedic form purely for the 
teacher’s convenience. It should be taught in any order the teacher wishes. She 
will of course, be guided by her class-room project in her topic for the lesson attack. 
I. Principles of geography (Calkins): 
In most of the texts in use this work will include the following topics: 
1. Shape and size of the earth: 
Some proofs of the earth’s shape may now be given with hopes of their being un- 
derstood. Sailing around the earth and the appearance of ships at sea, as usually 
stated, prove only curvature. State them so they prove equal curvature in all di- 
réctions. Even here these proofs mean very little unless they can be actually ex- 
perienced. Let the child see that the size of the earth is an important factor; that 
because of its size, and its great barriers of oceans and mountains, the people, of the 
earth have been separated and isolated from each other; and that because of this sep- 
aration and isolation there have arisen differences of language, customs, manner and 
race. Latitude and longitude are measured in degrees and not.miles, because the 
earth is curved. As we move north or south over the earth, new stars rise above or 
sink below our horizon and from their change of position we are able to find our 
latitude. : 
2. Motions of the earth: . 
a. Directions as a result of rotation. , Reemphasize the fact that it is patetion 
which makes the finding of direction possible. Various methods of finding the 
north pole star and Great Dipper; shadow at noon; point the hour hand of a watch 
towards the sun, then half way between the hour hand and the figure twelve on 
the dial will be south; the compass points towards the north magnetic pole and not 
towards the true north pole. It does not always point north therefore, but in 
Michigan it varies but little from true north. 
b. Longitude and time, standard time, international date—Show how a spherical 
-earth rotating causes the sun to rise and set and cross the various meridians at 
different times, and how, by knowing this difference of time between places, we 
can find difference of longitude. Emphasize the fact that because the earth is
-P-A-G-E-217

spherical and rotates from west to east, sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight, and with 
it the new day, all come from the east, that New York has sunrise, noon, sunset and 
the new day before Detroit, and that the new day begins at the 180th meridian or 
the international date line and travels around the world to the west ending again 
at the date line when midnight reaches it. All of this, together with the length 
of the day, is a consequence of rotation. 
c. Seasons. 
In the third grade the pupils learned from observation that summer is warm- 
er than winter because its days are longer, its nights shorter, and the sun’s rays are 
steeper. The explanation of why the days are longer and the sun’s rays steeper in 
summer than in winter is too difficult to be attempted until now. It is believed 
that in connection with the motions of the earth it can be shown why this is so 
and why we thus have change of seasons. 
3. The atmosphere: 
a. Its composition, pressure. 
b. Water vapor. How it gets into the atmosphere and the conditions govern- 
ing the rate of evaporation; how it gets out of the atmosphere and the, various 
forms into which it condenses—fog, clouds, dew, frost, rain, snow, hail. 
A common error in teaching the relation of mountains to rainfall is here to be 
guarded against. The usual statement is that the wind blows against the cold 
side of the mountains, is cooled, and its moisture condensed into rain or snow. 
If this were the cause the vapor would gather from the atmosphere upon the cold 
rocks as dew or frost and there would be no rainfall. 
Whenever a gas is compressed it is heated as one may see by noticing how 
quickly a bicycle pump becomes heated in pumping up the tires. When the press- 
ure upon a gas is suddenly decreased it expands and becomes codl, as all know who 
have noticed how cool the air is as it escapes from the valve on a bicycle tire. Now, 
when air moves up a mountain slope it is rising into regions with less air pressure. 
As the pressure upon the rising air decreases it expands and cools just as does 
the escaping air from the bicycle tires. It is this cooling which causes the conden- 
sation into rain or snow. It is called cooling by expansion and is the chief cause of 
the cooling which produces rainfall everywhere. 
c. Air temperatures: 
.(1) How distribution of temperatures over the earth is represented on a 
map by isotherm lines. 
(2) Causes of unequal temperatures between the equator and the poles. 
(3) Causes of unequal heating of sea and land. 
CAUTION: The high temperatures of western Europe and western North America 
are due more to the unequal heating of sea and land than to the Gulf Stream and other 
currents. In winter the ocean is warmer than the land and would be were there no 
ocean currents. Winds blowing from the west carry these moderating temperatures 
to the west coast of Europe. (At the prevailing winds blew from the east the British 
Isles and Newfoundland would exchange climates. Put the emphasis upon ugequal 
heating of land and sea and the prevailing winds rather upon ocean currents.

e. Weather: - 
It is time that the schools do something to destroy the superstition and ig-

foretell weather accurately a year, or even a,month in advance. Teachers should 
look up this topic and be able to explain the weather changes as they occur. Write 
to the nearest weather bureau station and ask that the daily weather map be sent 
to your school. 
4. The ocean and ocean movements: 
The oceans, their extent, depth, nature of their bottoms, wind waves, tides and 
the chief ocean currents. The relation of wind to waves and to ocean currents should 
here be brought out. Show also how the currents generated by the winds are de- 
flected by the continents into their present courses. 
5. Rain and river erosion and land forms: 
Teach by observation in the neighboring fields how the water running’‘off after a 
storm erodes gullies in the hillsides, how these gullies grow wider, deeper and longer 
with each storm until they are finally cut to the depth at which water stands in the 
ground when they thus acquire permanent streams. Show by example if possible

7. Coast lines and the various forces and agents at work in changing them. 
IT. Study of the continents: 
“1. South America: 
a. Present physiographically in detail. (See outline for the Study of a Con- 
tinent, Fifth Grade.) 
b. Emphasize Argentina, Chili, and Brazil. 
c. Some suggestive problems for study outlined by members of the revision com- 
mittee: 
(1) The mass of South America is in the Torrid Zone. Why is this unfavorable to 
the development of the continent? 
(2) The highlands of the continent are on the border and the plains in the interior 
In what ways is this favorable and unfavorable to the development of South America? 
(8) Determine through the use of maps and texts the physical causes underlying 
the character and amount of vegetation in the selvas region, and on the savannas. 
(4) Account for the two extensive arid regions on opposite sides of the Andes High- 
land. How have they affected the development of South America? 
—(5) Why are the largest centers of population found on the border of South Ameri- 
ca? 
(6) Determine why Argentina is the most progressive country of South America. 
(7) The foreign commerce of Buenos Aires in 1912 exceeded that of Rio Janeiro 
by three hundred million dollars. Account for the greater commerce of Buenos 
Aires. 
(8) Find out why Brazil is the greatest coffee raising country in the world/ 
(9) What is the importance of the rivers of South America as highways of com- 
merce? 
(10) Why are there so many volcanoes in the Andes Highland, many of which are 
still active, and what has been their bearing upon life in the region? 
Note: These problems were, in the: , gotten from the text. The pupils should 
read the text carefully for statements oe develop. thought-provoking questions. 
Example: 
a. “The cultivation of coffee has proved so successful that Brazil now pro- 
duces more than one-half the quantity raised in the world.” 
b. “The rubber industry is well developed in the tropical Andean countries 
(Peru, Ecudaor, Colombia, Bolivia).” 
“Argentina is the most advanced of the South American countries.” 
“Brazil produces more than one-half the coffee used in the world.” 
“Brazil is the chief coffee-producing country in the world.” 
“Argentina is the leading country of South America.” 
“Argentina is most advanced of South American countries.” 
“Chile is the most important republic on the Pacific Coast of South America; 
id Eas Argentina in progressiveness.”” 
= V2. Panama Canal: a detailed study. 
(a) Suggested problems. 
(1) What commercial and military benefits does the United States government ex- 
pect to derive from the completion of the Panama Canal? 
(2) What will be the bearing’ of the Panama Canal on the development of the 
countries of South America?

rate nations. 
d. The British Isles: Physical character and conditions of the British Isles. 
Effects of isolation. 
e. Some statements in the text that might lead to the developing of thought- 
provoking questions from the pupils: 
(1) “In spite of its small size Great Britain is in many: respects the most pow- 
erful and most important country in the world.” 
(2) ‘Far too little food is produced in the British Isles to feed the people.” 
(8) “Great Britain has become one of the leading iron and steel manufactur- 
ing centers in the world.” é 
(4) “In spite of the limited supply of food, France is a great manufacturing 
country.” 
(5) “The position of the-highlands of France is favorable to commerce as we 
as to farming.” 
(6) ‘Paris, the capital of France, is the largest city on the continent of Eu- 
rope, and the third largest in the world.” 
(7) “Their [the French] artistic taste has had great influence upon the kind 
and amount of manufacture.” 
(8) ‘In these days of railroads Germany’ 's central position is superior to that 
of England for trade.” 
(9) “For transportation of goods Germany is especially favored by her rivers. 
There are also many canals and railroads.” 
(10.) “Such a climate, together with a fertile soil, helps to explain why agricul- 
ture is the principal industry in Italy.” 
(11) “There is more manufacturing in Italy than one might infer from the lack 
of fuel. “Why?”

EIGHTH GRADE 
Read ‘“‘Teaching of Geography in the Grammar Grades: Some 
Suggestions,” pp. 189-194, carefully many times during the year. 
The text, Tarr and McMurry’s Complete Geography, contains 
practically all the material that is printed in the separate texts for 
the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grades, and, in addition, it in- 
cludes Part VIII, which is a graphical and statistical review of the 
United States, comparing it with the other world powers. This 
Part VIII, then, should be made the working text for the eighth 
grade. This volume serves as a reference when information is to 
be looked up about a topic, and is, in a sense, an encyclopedia: 
A Summary of the Work of the Previous Grades* 
A summary of the work of the previous grades showing what geo- 
graphical knowledge the eighth grade child should have is as fol- 
lows: 
I. Principles of geography— 
1. Emphasis has been placed upon map-reading: and interpreta- 
tion through third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh grades. 
2. Emphasis has been placed upon globe use, chiefly in the fourth 
grade, and only such reference to globe study in the other grades as 
was necessary to establish relative positions. 
3. The text-book, which gives more facts and shows more rela- 
tions than the map, has been in use through the fourth, fifth, sixth, 
and seventh grades. 
4. Reading latitude and longitude should have been made as 
automatic as the multiplication or addition tables in arithmetic. 
This was begun in the fourth and has been a part of the fifth, sixth, 
and seventh grade work. 
5. Windbelts were begun in the fifth grade, the causes of wind 
taught very generally in the sixth, and in a more detailed and scien- 
tific way in the seventh. 
6. Climate, as a detailed study, was begun in the sixth. Rainfall 
maps and isotherms were a part of the sixth grade work. These 
were used to build further climatic conceptions upon in the seventh 
grade, and the daily Weather Bureau map was studied in detail in 
the seventh.

II. In subject-matter relating to the life on the continents the outline 
by grades, roughly, has been as follows: 
1. Third Grade: 
a. Fact and geographic experiences accumulated from the 
home environment and furnishing a basis for imagining the re- 
gions and the peoples of the world. 
(1) Example of Home Geography: Where did we get our loaf 
of brad? : 
(2) Excursions: maps traced of route taken; (emphasis placed 
on map-using when visiting the home regions). 
(3) Example of World Geography: Commodities from distant 
lands furnish a connection with home regions when teacher 
chooses. When other regions than the home are studied, the 
teacher choose certain type-regions unknown to child’s environ- 
ment: Sahara Desert for Africa; Switzerland for mountainous 
Europe; Amazon Valley for South America; Japan and China 
for Asia; Holland for Lowland Europe. 
2. Fourth Grade: The fourth grade work opens with globe les- 
sons which continue for from three to six weeks. The ideas giving 
meaning to globe symbols were partially gotten in the third grade 
type-region studies. The transition from reading the globe to 
reading the flat-map is a large part of the fourth grade work. Lat- 
itude and longitude lines are taught and used for directions mainly; 
east and west are traced upon parallels; north and south along me- 
ridians. Fact accumulations are kept up through continent study 
always, linked up with map-study and supplemented by the text. 
3. Fifth Grade: In the fifth grade the continents are studied in 
a more logical outline; and in addition to latitude and longitude the 
names and positions of the windbelts of the world are studied. 
(For the outline followed for continent study in this grade see the 
Fifth Grade Course in geography.) 
4, Sixth Grade: The sixth grade gathers into a detailed study of 
surface and climate all the facts that have been accumulating in the 
three previous grades and organizes these, showing the relationship 
between the factors of surface, climate, and the life of man. These 
facts are applied mainly to the continent of North America—first 
to the continent as a unit, then to its different regions, and finally to 
its political divisions. So life in North America as a whole, then 
in Canada, in Mexico, in Central America, and in the United States 
and its dependencies is seen in relationship to (1) position, form, 
size, and surface; (2) climate; (3) vegetation; (4) occupation; (5) 
distribution of population; (6) commerce.

GEOGRAPHY—EIGHTH GRADE 213 
NoteE:—The greatest elimination of pupils from the grades takes place in the sixth 
grade, A child going out into the world with the geograghical knowledge accum- 
ulated throughout these six years of school life should have a real equipment to 
start with. 
“5. Seventh Grade: In the seventh grade the explanatory stage 
of the work is reached and the children are trained to seek out 
problems that ask ““Why certain effects are produced.’”’ The state- 
ments of the text provide many of the necessary problem materials 
that will serve as stimuli for the questioning mind of the pupil. 
The continent studies included in this grade are South America, 
Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is suggested that the teach- 
er should not expect to study in detail more than four problems 
on any one continent, and that Africa and Australia are to be stud- 
ied in the main as the colonizing ground of European peoples. 
. A detailed study of weather maps showing how highs and lows 
cause weather changes and a detailed study of rotation and revolu- 
tion of the earth are a part of the work of this grade.

1. Text: p. 453. Compare the five largest nations in area with 
the five nations containing the densest population. Account for 
the density of population in each of the ten nations. 
2. Text: p. 454. The United States produces more corn than 
any other nation in the world. Why is this and how does this pro- 
duction of corn affect the finances of the United States and the com- 
fort of the world? 
3. Sheep and cattle are important raw material for the world’s 
existence. Note the distribution of the sheep and cattle grounds 
of the world, and discuss the activities growing out of these pro- 
ducing areas and the interchange of cattle and sheep commodities 
all over the world. 
4. “England keeps her cows in Australia, Canada and Argentina; 
cultivates her wheat in Manitoba, the United States and India; 
grows her cotton in the United States, India and Egypt; spins it 
at home andin India, China, Egypt and Mexico; makes her machin- 
ery in Germany and the United States.”"—What effect has this upon 
' the commerce of the countries mentioned? _.. 
5. Let. us see why Maryland, which is one of the smallest states, 
produces more canned tomatoes than any other state in the Union. 
6. Why should Maryland protect the oyster industry? 
7. The United States supplies European countries with most of 
their raw cotton. Why then do we in turn buy most of the Egyptian 
crop? 
8. Why is the development of the iron industry an index of a 
country’s progressiveness? 
9. Ought the United States government restrict the use of coal? 
10. Let us see some of the difficulties to be encountered in the 
construction of the proposed railroad in Alaska, and the advan- 
tages to be derived from it when completed. 
11. What important part in the work of the world does petroleum 
play? If there are any important countries that do not use it in 
any form, what takes its place? 
IV. Problem-study procedure: 
A problem formulated from one of the charts or graphs (Text pp. 
453-536 or from some other phase of the suggested subject matter) 
might take several weeks for its solution, ee three periods of 
geography for each week. 
1. The procedure might be— 
a. First inspect the graph, or deliberate over the statement. 
b. From their inspection the children and teacher together 
ask thought-provoking questions. =
-P-A-G-E-226

GEOGRAPHY—EIGHTH GRADE 215 
c. Class discussion of the problems as formulated and the 
most thoughtful ones chosen for study. 
d. The teacher sometimes organizes the topics for study that 
the problem suggests, sometimes the class-members outline the 
topics they think the problem demands. 
e. Then the topics outlined should be studied one at a time, 
using the index and the text. If a new topic is suggested as the 
study proceeds, that should be included in the outline. It should 
be put in its right place. Teachers may find as the lesson pro- 
ceeds that the original order of topics as outlined~Should be 
‘changed. And by the time the problem study is finished, it may 
be that the entire original outline of topics will be completely 
re-arranged. 
2. Such problems will demand: 
a. Graphs drawn by the pupils. 
b. Maps of producing areas. 
c. Maps of distributing areas. 
d. Maps of transportation. 
e. A knowledge of map-reading and interpretation. 
f. A knowledge of merchant marines of the different countries. 
g. A knowledge of climatic conditions, and physiography. 
h. A knowledge of tastes and advancement of people who pro- 
duce and consume. 
A knowledge of the scientific means for intensive produc- 
tion of the various commodities. 
Note: Where the class shows ignorance of latitude and longitude, 
winds, rotation of earth, etc., then the problem work should be 
stopped and those topics taught and drilled upon. 
3. In solving a problem the following general outline is suggested: 
a. Climate and topography. 
b. Raw material obtained from the farms, the plantation, 
“animals, the waters, the forests, or the mines. 
c. Manufacturing facilities. 
d. Transportation facilities. 
e. Social conditions including skilled labor and help. 
f. Financial conditions including tariff policies of different 
nations. 
g. Markets beth: home and abroad. 
4, “The cost of manufactured articles depends largely on: 
a. ‘The cost of the raw material at place of manufacture 
b. “The cost of labor. 
c. ‘The cost of power to drive the machinery.
-P-A-G-E-227

d. “The cost of getting the finished product to market. 
e. “The cost of interest on capital invested.” (From Gannett, 
Garrison, Houston; p. 47.) 
5. Manufacturing sites are located usually: 
a. Where raw material can be obtained cheaply. 
b. Where a plentiful supply of skilled labor exists. 
c. Where coal is plentiful, so as to insure cheap power, or 
where water power or electri¢ power can be obtained.

NATURE STUDY: PRIMARY GRADES 
Nature study appears upon the program of the primary grades as 
occurring two or three times a week, averaging about forty minutes 
weekly, but the work should be directed in such fashion that often 
more real, live, nature-study work or observation takes place at 
recess, or before and after school than at any other time. In regard 
to subject matter, whatever belongs to the natural environment of 
the children is legitimate material. Suitable choice is made to 
fit the needs and capacities of the children, the aim being to stimu- 
late keener observation through which to add enjoyment. Our 
subject matter includes phases of plant and animal life, physical 
phenomena which affect the lives of those in the community. 
Observation, Experiment, Discussion. The outlines are 
necessarily rich in suggestive material from which teachers are 
asked to select with care. The work of the first. and second grades 
is simple, consisting of apparently informal and incidental obser- 
vations in relation to directed activities, governed by the seasonal 
changes. The children should be encouraged to bring in caterpillars, 
- cocoons, flowers, plants, seeds, leaves; to make simple reports of 
what the robin, the squirrel, the hen, the rabbit do, and what they 
can do for them; to plant seeds, and watch the growth of a plant 
from seeds to flower. It should be the purpose to make the nature- 
study observation work a continuous year-round story, rather than 
to present small detached, unrelated bits, which can have but little 
meaning. 
The work of the third and fourth grades does not materially differ 
from the work of the previous grades. The attitude of reverence 
and respect should be extended through increasing knowledge gained 
in response to a need in the solution of some real live problems, which 
the children consider valid and of consequence. To this end it 
seems best to organize the work in fourth grade around some specific 
centers of interest suggested by the environment. These large 
problems while not excluding observation along other lines, demand 
concentration of effort on the part of both teacher and children 
in the attainment of a definite result. 
Laboratory Work. Garden work at home and the laboratory 
garden at school offer the best opportunity for real nature study. 
In the absence of this, some other means of stimulating effort will 
be necessary. Sincere work may be accomplished by means of 
specimens brought into the schoolroom, by excursions to accessible 
regions, and setting simple problems which call foraccurate observa- 
tion and clear, concise report.

Records of some kind are essential, records of growth and change 
by means of collections, of drawings, of pictures illustrating the 
points observed. The recorded observations of another whether 
in prose or poetry should be added whenever possible as a means of 
increasing enjoyment and giving visible means for expression oe 
emotions. ¥.

FIRST GRADE 
Nature study for little children consists of simple observations, © 
talks, and games, about things in relation to the life about them.’ 
It is-for the purpose of creating an interest in living things and de- 
veloping a respect and love for the most common things of every © 
day life. The story and the poem should be used freely to a ~ 
this attitude. . fe 
The outline is necessarily formal, but the work is meant’ to be 
most informal and “natural. To the child, always apparently in- 
cidental and accidental; to the teacher, always a part of a well- 
ordered plan which has for its point of attack something most in- 
teresting to the children. Usually pets form a bond of sympathy 
between home and:school, and for this reason should be presented 
spontaneously at an early stage. Objects which the children bring, 
or are encouraged to bring, aid the work, but whatever is used should 
be considered in relation to a definite plan for each season, a plan 
which has some unity, some continuity from season to season. 
Piecemeal work is to be avoided. Make use of growing plants, of 
the pet as a school visitor, of the fish in the aquarium to stimulate 
sympathetic and real, not pretended observation. A few minutes 
each day devoted to a few simple things will develop the habit of 
observation. Several problems, simple enough for little children 
to appreciate, can be utilized from season to season, or from month 
to month; as (1) walks and talks in spring and fall for purposes of 
observation (2) the bulb observed in the autumn,- put away to 
sleep and then brought out in time to bloom for an Easter gift to 
mother; or (3) the nasturtium seed planted for the competitive 
plant raising, or the flower in the window box. 
Collections of things made by the little children independently 
and on directed excursions should be used in various sense games 
through which they learn to recognize and to associate the names of 
plants, of leaves, of seeds, of fruits, of vegetables, of stones; to learn 
something of their qualities and something of their beauty and their

use. The teacher of the first grade should have an abundance of 
interesting objects; some birds’ nests, cocoons, queer looking seeds, 
buds and flowers for use, as occasion demands. 
Various projects are suggested as invaluable aids to stimulate 
observation and experiment and thereby furnish a basis for rational 
discussion within the child’s comprehension. Children learn by 
‘doing. The important thing.is to keep alive the questioning spirit. 
Train children to observe; talk, question; then look again.

SECOND GRADE 
Nature study in the second grade does not differ materially from 
the first, since the interests of the children are very much the same. 
Many of the problems begun in the first year should be extended 
from year to year until an intimate acquaintance is felt through 
repeated associations. 
The very best work results from the direct observation of the 
nature study material in schoolroom and out, the teacher stim- 
ulating attention and increasing activity “of thought through her 
suggestive questions and happy manner. The nature study lesson 
is, indeed, the “children’s hour,” often accidental and incidental, 
as far as they are concerned, but always well-planned and forming 
a part of a larger unity when considered from the teacher’s stand- 
point. It is needless to add that specimens in the schoolroom are 
a necessity, and that the excursion, however short, and outdoor 
work including the raising of a best plant, are vital to real nature 
study. Stories and poems are used to enhance the ethical significance 
and to give the children a medium through which to express their 
emotions. 
The outline following is not a minimum course of study but sug- 
gests a wide range of topics from which material for a series of les- 
sons can well be planned. The children and environment will de- 
termine largely the mode of attack. The seasons with their chang- 
ing and ever recurring activities form a thread of unity which if 
properly organized will prevent disjointed, scrappy work. In this 
grade as in succeeding grades the children should come to have a 
real and abiding acquaintance with some one bit of nature in the 
immediate environment. Develop a kind of intimacy and personal 
interest in ‘Our Tree,” ‘Our Plants,” “Our Garden,” ‘Our Birds,” 
and others.

THIRD GRADE 
A strong, general interest in nature, plants, animals, pets, and 
nature happenings is still manifest in the children of the third grade, 
and since their nature interests are many and varied the general 
character of the work does not differ from that of the previous year. 
The outline, presenting a wide range of subjects, aims to meet these 
varying interests of children and at the same time provide oppor- 
tunity for choice on the part of the teacher according to the needs 
of her children and their environment. A teacher’s lack of data 
is not sufficient excuse for lack of vital nature work which the lo- 
cality affords, since outdoor observations and books are available 
to meet her need for preparation. Unity and coherence in the work 
need emphasis and the various projects should be considered as 
parts of an all-the-year-round cycle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
NATURE STUDY—THIRD GRADE 229 
The same methods prevail as in the previous grades but with 
increasing intensity of purpose. The questioning attitude still 
persists and delight is still shown in simple identification. But the 
children are older; an increasing self-control and a degree of skill 
has been attained which enables them to concentrate their efforts 
to definite ends, if kept within their grasp. The exploring, collect- 
ing and constructive instincts are rising into prominence. Interest 
in excursions and collections is keen. Gathering and preserving 
specimens, observing live specimens brought into the schoolroom 
are important.- The constructive interest is centering upon the 
thing done or the product., The child’s ambition is often quite be- 
yond his skill, but his efforts are worthy of respect and encourage- 
ment. Gardening, the care of pets, and various simple experiments 
which help to solve some simple problems engage his attention. 
Garden work for third grade children assumes some dignity be- 
cause they are now old enough to engage in it with some advantage 
to themselves and others. Home garden work, of a very simple 
nature, usually raising one or two vegetables, should be encouraged, 
for this contact with-the soil, and observation of growth instils re- 
spect for all plant life. 
The raising of a bést plant in a pot for a competitive flower ex- 
hibit is'a bit of garden work in miniature, and affords opportunity 
for excellent, motivated work. 
“Go, See, Say and Do” is the motto of this grade. Excursions 
for the purpose of directing keen observations; truthful statement; 
insisting that children tell what they see, not what someone else sees 
for them; and all leading to action which in the main helps to foster 
and maintain life; these are the important factors in nature study. 
This method of procedure should develop a real and abiding inti- 
macy with some phases of nature in the immediate environment by 
giving meaning and purpose to what has been heretofore largely . 
isolated bits of observation. The children should come to have a 
personal interest in “Our Class Tree,” “Our Plants,” “Our Garden,” 
“Our Ants,” and this may form the nucleus for extending the horizon 
to increasingly larger units and larger problems iri succeeding grades. 
Expression in some tangible form is necessary to fix habits and to 
retain knowledge. Suggestions are given under the head of pro- 
jects for various kinds of activities during the year. A sufficient 
variety affords opportunity for selection to suit the needs of the 
children. Some written work is essential as an aid to correct and 
truthful statement.

FOURTH GRADE 
Nature study is for the purpose of giving enjoyment through in- 
telligent contact with nature. Knowledge gained in pleasant and 
purposeful ways in previous grades should be used as a foundation 
for a richer and fuller treatment of similar and not necessarily the 
same subjects in this grade. 
Specific nature problems suggested by the environment are pre- 
sented around which the work is organized. The problems are: 
Our Woods, Our Orchard, Our Park, The Garden, The Lawn, 
Pond Life. It is not intended that all of the work suggested 
shall be attempted by any one class, since it is arranged to meet the
-P-A-G-E-245
234 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
needs of different localities, and a teacher is free to choose some 
phase which makes a strong appeal to interest. Not more than 
two centers should be attempted during the year, and the problems 
considered in relation to these should be sufficiently compelling in 
their nature to stimulate both teacher and children to the attain- 
ment of definite results. 
Excursions definitely planned by both teacher and children and 
supervised by the teacher, supplemented by smaller organized 
groups under the guidance of a class leader; specific problems in 
outdoor work in the home and laboratory, garden; the competitive 
plant-raising; simple experiments conducted in the schoolroom, 
are the avenues through which observational work is directed. 
Some attempt is made to extend the knowledge of the home region 
to natural phenomena in regions remote, through imagination, 
stimulated by collected objects of various kinds and visits to the 
Horticultural Museum. . 
_ Literature, as in previous grades, should be used to enhance the 
significance of common things, furnishing the children with a me- 
_ dium of expression which adds to their permanent enjoyment. The 
story or poem may often be given as a contribution from one member 
of the class for the enjoyment of the whole, as a supplement to first- 
hand observation and crude attempts at expression. 
Knowledge and appreciation should be expressed in some tangible 
form, as (1) Audubon Societies which help to foster ideals in rela- 
tion to bird life; (2) respect for property, warning children against 
trespassing; (3) school activities; through which records of experi- 
ments of observations may be made. ot 
Time allotment: Two 20 minute periods, per week.

THE GARDEN 
The garden offers the best opportunity for vitalized nature study if the work can be 
arranged around definite working problems. To this end it is suggested that dis- 
cussions based upon observations and experiments with the Window Box Garden 
and the Competitive Plant Raising be used as a means to further interest in the larg- 
er aspect of garden work. Discussion grows out of demonstration and children will 
engage in the projects set forth both at home and at school.

OUR POND 
In some localities a running stream or a pond offers an unusual opportunity for 
observational nature study. The material is varied and interesting, since to the study 
of nature and life on land is added the study of nature and life in the water. Many 
interesting problems can be presented for solution 
PonD LIFE 
That piece of sky let in, that you do call 
A pond, but which I know 
To be a deep and wondrous world; for I 
Have seen the trees within it—marvelous things 
So thick no bird betwixt their leaves could fly 
But she would smite her wings: 
Go there—I say; stand at the water’s brink, 
And shoals of spotted grayling you shall see 
Basking between the shadows—look, and think 
This beauty is for me. 5,

NATURE STUDY: GRAMMAR GRADES 
SUGGESTONS FOR TEACHING NATURE STUDY IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES 
FIFTH GRADE 
A Local Study. “Nature study is necessarily restricted in the 
materials it uses to those which any particular environment affords. 
Hence the details of nature study courses must differ widely. The 
objects of nature which are of special interest in one community 
may be entirely lacking in another. In one community the outdoor 
interest may center in the forest, in another in the prairie, in another 
in the fields and the gardens, or in another in the seashore. But 
amid these widely different details as to the materials which nature 
study uses the same purpose runs and the same results are to be 
obtained. It is this great variety in the details that baffles many 
teachers who are more accustomed to follow directions than to 
formulate them. But it is one of the strong arguments of the ad- 
vocates of nature study that it is a subject whose very nature re- 
quires its teachers to be initiators rather than imitators. And a 
teacher’s growth in efficiency depends in part upon the compulsion 
to initiate in some directions rather than to imitate.’”—Coulter and 
Patterson: Practical Nature Study; pp. 14-15. 
Our resources for nature study materials in Baltimore County are 
indeed great, in the main. Our rural sections are a laboratory of 
everyday experiences with animals and plants that are the source of 
our everyday food supply, clothing, and shelter; animals and in- 
sects, plants and herbs that are beneficial or injurious to the pro- 
duction of these sources; wild flowers and plants that make our 
parks and gardens beautiful; and animals that make good pets. 
The most appropriate and educative work for these sections is ele- 
mentary agriculture and the motivation is best made by means of 
the corn and canning club movement. Our suburban sections, 
in the main, contribute almost the same experiences that are met 
in the rural sections. Our strictly urban sections, Highlandtown 
and Canton, particularly, may not seem at first sight to possess 
resources with their rowsandrowsof brick houses and their very small 
back yard lots and gardens. But Patterson Parkis very close and this 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
NATURE STUDY—GRAMMAR GRADE 249 
is not to be despised as a real laboratory for nature study excursions 
and experiences. The Patapsco River is not far away and its waters 
and its life can become the supply for aquaria and the study of water 
food stuffs. 
The revision committee this year recommends that the materials 
assembled in the old course of study under nature study, viz., 
weather conditions, physics, public or civic sanitation, and nature 
study proper, be now distributed, and each topic assigned to the 
subject to which it most largely contributes. For example—weather 
observations will be included in the geography outline, physics in 
the physics course, and sanitation under civics. The bulk of the 
observational nature study, the committee believes, should then 
be accomplished by the end of the fifth year. According to this 
plan there is no nature study course, as such, after the fifth grade. 
The sixth grade gets an introduction to science in its cookery and 
manual training, and a little of biology in its civics when it takes 
up a detailed study of the fly in its relation to the diseases of man- 
kind. The seventh grade takes up about twenty experiments in 
physics and the eighth grade builds upon these in physics and me- 
chanics. 
It has been suggested that we organize our work for the year 
around some nature study projects. This is a distinct advance over 
the third grade procedure and continues and builds upon the pro- 
jects of the fourth grade—our fields, our orchard, our lawn, our 
garden, our park, our pond. The following are the projects sug- 
gested as the basis for selection for the fifth grade; the outlines 
having been worked out by members of the revision committee:— 
. The excursion or the hike. 
. The vivarium. 
. The Audubon Society. 
Humane Society. 
. School and home gardens and window-boxes. 
. Patrons’ association prizes for school nature collections. 
. Beautifying the school grounds—laying out the lawn. 
. Sky observations. 
. Corn Clubs and Canning Clubs. 
10. Maps of the vicinity (to scale, radius of one mile), with trees, 
hills, streams, ponds, quarries, etc. noted. 
Norte: Choose not more than four projects for any one year. One 
project is sufficient if it presents phases that need to be studied for 
seasonal changes. 
Time allotment: ‘Two 25 minute periods per week or longer if other 
related projects grow out of the nature study topic.

THE HIKE 
BY LILLIAN HERRERA, HIGHLANDTOWN SCHOOL, AND RHONA GAYLEARD, VIOLETVILLE 
SCHOOL 
The excursion has become the recognized basis for the study of home geography. 
An outline for the principal points to be observed may be placed in a notebook so as 
to give definite views for the work. The nature study hike should be carefully 
planned (the child may or may not take a notebook according to the judgment of the 
teacher) Voluntary and happy observations from the pupils will open many ave- © 
nues of interest and become the subject for further study. 
A system of credits for valuable observations will be a strong incentive for the stalk- 
ing or hike. 
If we are studying our vicinity within a radius of a mile, then a plan to visit cer- 
tain sections for a well-defined purpose would be advisable, and a second visit to 
show change or development in the subject may be necessary. Suppose we select 
the woods. 
I. Project—The appearance of the woods in autumn clothes. 
1. Note foliage in September. 
2. Note changes after the lapse of a week or after a frost, note falling leaves. 
3. Buds placed away for the winter. 
4. Winter observations. 
5. Spring buds, sap, etc. 
6. Appearance of trees in spring. 
7. Maps or chart of trees located on the hike. 
II. Project—Some particular tree. 
1. Credits given for a fairly good record of the changes and development of a 
particular tree during each month of the year. 
2. When there was apparently a sameness. Why? 
3. The festival seasons of the tree. 
4, Purpose of the tree. 
TIT. Project—Map or chart showing the development of the vicinity in its attempt 
at improving and beautifying its conditions. 
1. Give credits to pupils who draw a chart showing what would improve the 
appearance of the community. 
2. Locate the ten prettiest places in the community and describe what makes 
them so. Tell the appearance during each season of the year. When in its glory? 
Note: The Boy Scouts movement makes use of the hike in a real educative way. 
VIVARIUM AND AQUARIUM 
BY LILLIAN HERRERA, HIGHLANDTOWN SCHOOL 
“No one piece of nature study apparatus is capable of serving so many and so 
various uses as an aquarium. It may be used wet or dry; filled with water it becomes 
the means of practical acquaintance with all kinds of aquatic life, both plant and 
animal; managed as a vivarium or terrarium it makes a fine insect-breeding case, a 
fernery, a place for a collection of living mosses, the home of frogs, tree frogs, turtles, 
salamanders, snakes, slugs and land snails. With one end arranged for water and 
the other for land, and filled with mosses and ferns, pitcher plantsand . . 
sdews it may be at once a paradise for all kinds of things, both aquatic and earesial’ 
Filled with earth, it may be used to germinate seeds in. By planting them against 
the glass and darkening with a black cloth we may study ‘root and all’ in its natural

environment, observe the root systems of various plants, and make all sorts of in- 
teresting experiments. If we wish we may plant a hill of potatoes; and we may cer- 
tainly plant against the glass all sorts of seeds of our forest, fruit, and nut trees.”

a cool place or outside where the cocoon receives moisture. In March, place them 
in the terrarium so they may emerge in their normal season, feed them with honey, 
poplar or lilac leaves; after observing the stages of development, let them go, or make 
a chart showing the cocoon, silky bed, chrysalis, and the full-grown moth. 
Making the cage—feeding the moth, observation of habits, making of charts, re- 
search work from reference libraries and encyclopedias.

THE AUDUBON SOCIETY 
BY EDITH LAWSON, HOWARD PARK SCHOOL 
Since birds form an interesting part of nature study an effective way to study them 
is through the Audubon Society. There is a difference between a society and a forty- 
five minute study of birds. The very fact that children are members of a society 
awakens a responsibility toward birds that they otherwise would not feel. Usually 
the children who take intense interest in birds lead in the work anyway and they can 
do much better if allowed to organize the class so that each member will feel his share 
of the responsibility about studying the value and care of birds. 
I, Aim of the Society: 
“To stimulate love and interest in birds, by giving a special scheduled time for 
the meetings, and exchanging ideas in an organized way, that will result in a 
general knowledge and care for our feathered friends in the community.” 
II, Introduction: 
1. Value of birds. 
a. Aesthetic. 
(1) Songs. 
(2) Vivid colors. 
b. Economical. 
(1) Facts proving the destruction of injurious insects—viz., tree sparrows, 
quail, robins, woodpeckers. 
2. What a bird really is. 
a. Compare parts of bird to human form. 
b. Common hen as type. 
(1) Feathers as clothing. 
(2) Feathers as ornaments. 
(8) Brightness of male bird’s coat.

f. Feet of birds. 
Birds that run, hop, scratch, wade, etc. 
g. Bird ways and habits. 
(1) Songs and calls. 
(2) Where seen: top of tree, lower branches of tree, on ground. 
3. Recognition of common birds: woodpecker, flicker, lark, blue jay, crow, spar- 
row, cedar bird, cardinal, wren, chickadee, robin, bluebird. 
a. By song. 
b. By nest. 
c. By coat. 
4, Individuality of structure of nests. (This is good for fall work since there 
are then many nests to be found.) 
5. Summer residents. 
6. Winter residents. (Keep chart of each.) 
7. Care of birds—attraction to homes. 
a. Discourage destruction of birds and their nests. 
b. Encourage destruction of bird-enemies. 
c. Supply food when necessary—winter. 
d. Build suitable houses or nesting places. 
(1) Ventilation considered. 
(2) Size and position of entrance considered. 
(8) Drainage. 
(4) Means of cleaning. 
(5) Color of house. 
The building of the house may be successfully handled as a contest between the 
different classes in the school. In this way the work of the Society is made known 
throughout the neighborhood; community co-operation is thereby established. 
The topic correlates well with the fifth grade study of wood in the industrial arts 
course under the topic of “shelter” or with concrete, another of the building materials. 
HUMANE SOCIETY OR BAND OF MERCY 
_ | BY FLORENCE MARTIN, CANTON NO. 1 SCHOOL

come the basis for studying the animals that are useful to man and those that he 
loves as pets: 
Miss FLORENCE MarrIN, 
School No. 1, Canton, Md. 
My Dear MapbaM: 
Replying to your letter of June 1, would say that under separate cover I am send- 
ing you literature that I feel sure will prove helpful to you in introducing humane 
work in your school, and would call special attention to the leaflet, “‘How to Form 
Bands of Mercy,” in which you will find full instructions for organizing, and direc- 
tions for reporting any bands so formed to this office that they may receive the free 
outfit which we offer to all bands sent in tous. I have no doubt you will find it very 
easy to interest your children in humane education. This can be done through 
nature work, and I would suggest that you have them provide watering places for 
small animals and birds, and see that they are kept clean and full. A child is always 
more interested in anything practical. If you are not already familiar with the color-

SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENS AND WINDOW BOXES 
BY ELENA FORESTI, PIMLICO SCHOOL 
Gardening: 
“Actually to grow a plant is to come into intimate contact with a specific bit of 
nature. 
“The working plan for school gardens must have relation to the economic and 
social conditions under which the school exists. The purpose may be analyzed as 
follows: 
1. “Ornamenting the grounds, comprising (a) cleaning and tidying them, (b) se- 
curing a lawn, (c) planting. This is always the first thing to be done. It stands for 
ideals of thrift, cleanliness, comfort, beauty, progressiveness. 
2. “Establishing a collection to supply material for nature-study and class work. 
3. “Making a garden for the purpose of (a) supplying materials (as in No. 2), 
(b) affording manual-training, object lessons and instruction in plant-growing, (c) 
teaching agriculture and horticulture. 
“The school garden is for the purpose of direct instruction. It is an outdoor labo- 
ratory. It is part of the school equipment, as books, blackboards, charts and ap- 
paratus are. The real school garden is not adapted to all schools; or, to speak more 
correctly, not all schools are yet adapted to the school garden any more than they 
are all adapted to an equipment in physics or chemistry. The making of a definite 
garden is an epoch in the life of each school; it marks the progress of the school in 
pedagogical ideals.”"—Bailey, The Nature Study Idea.

PRIZE CONTESTS FOR SCHOOL COLLECTIONS 
" BY DENA AITCHESON, FULLERTON SCHOOL : 
A trophy, to be decided upon by the proper authorities, is to be awarded at the end 
of the school year to the pupil or the class which presents the best arranged and most 
complete collection of one or more materials from the following list: 
Each teacher should select the one or two subjects for special study that are best 
suited to the environment of the school and the homes of the pupils. 
1. Herbarium. 
2. Trees—fall and spring leaves; bark and cross sections of each kind of tree. 
3. Butterflies—properly mounted. 
4, Insects—harmless kinds; greatest variety; properly mounted. 
5. Minerals—kinds and composition; specimens properly labeled. 
6. Birds’ nests—native; habits; color; collection of nests; identification of bird with 
nests. 
7. Plant raising contests. 
Pupils should also be taught about dangerous bees and insects and -the injurious 
plants, weeds, etc. Whichever groups are selected for collection, simple knowledge 
of the characteristics should be given after as much directed study in the open, as 
possible, has been carried on through the excursion or hike.

IMPROVING AND BEAUTIFYING THE SCHOOL GROUNDS 
BY OLIVIA HERSHNER, GOVANS SCHOOL, AND ANNA PADIAN, EVERGREEN SCHOOL 
“The first category—the improvement of the premises—is of universal applica- 
tion. Every school-ground can be picked up, slicked up and made fit for children to 
see. There are three stages or epochs in the improvement of any ground: cleaning 
up; grading and seeding; planting. To improve the school-grounds should be a 
matter of neighborhood pride. » It is an expression of the people’s interest in the things 
that are the people’s. 
“The first thing to do is to arouse the public conscience. Begin with the children. 
As soon as they are directed to see the conditions they will believe what they see. 
They are not prejudiced. They will talk about it; teacher, mother, father will hear. 
Get the children enthusiastic—it is easy to do—in removing stones and litter and 
rubbish, in filling in the holes, piling the wood, raking the grounds. 
“The cleaning up once done, and the civic pride once aroused to a pitch of keeping 
it done, the next thing to do is to make a base or foundation upon which all the gar-

dening or planting features are to stand; the land must be graded. In some cases the 
soil must be removed and new soil put in its place, for the soil about a schoolhouse is 
very likely to be poor sand or clay, or a mixture with building material and other 
things; but in general this labor will not be necessary if only a lawn and ornamental 
planting are desired. In some instances a lawn is impractical, but a good and even 
earth surface should always be secured. The early spring is the season in which to 
do all this shaping and seeding of the land. The spring fever is on and enthusiasm 
is new born. If the school is in the country, the farmers can be interested to do the 
heavy work. If the subject has been well discussed in the school for some weeks or 
months, it should not be difficult to organize the farmers into a ‘bee’ to grade, till 
and seed the ground. . . . . “Thenext year plant. Let the matter be dis- 
cussed in school. Ask the children to make plans. When the time is ready choose 
the simplest plan that seems to fulfill the requirements. Remember that during a 
large part of the year the school ground will be practically without care. The plant- 
ing must be able to maintain itself; if necessary, cover the outbuildings with vines, 
and screen them with bushes or trees. Use chiefly hardy and well-known trees and 
shrubs and herbs. Aim to have the grounds interesting because it appeals to the 
onlooker as a picture as a whole and not asa collection of plants.”’—Bailey: The Nat- 
ure Study Idea, 
BEAUTIFYING THE SCHOOL GROUNDS 
I. Laying out the ground (the plan): 
1. Grading. 
_ 2. Drainage. 
3, Walks. i. 
II. Preparation of the soil: 
1. Native soil. 
a. Top-dress with manure; plow under. 
b. In spring top-dress with well-composted manure; cross plow; harrow 
and roll. 
2. When graded and filled in— 
a. Allow soil to settle. 
b. Plant corn or potatoes to reduce weeds. 
c. Apply fertilizers. 
III. Kinds of soil: 
1. Fine, sandy loam over clay subsoil. (Experiment with different kinds to 
see which holds water best.) 
2. One or two feet deep. 
8. Earth from building foundations is unsuited for the purpose. 
4. Study earthworms as tillers of the soil. 
IV. Fertilizers: 
1. Old, well composted manure. 
2, Commercial fertilizers with lime and bone (Sefore seeding). 
3. After grass has started use land plaster, bone meal, nitrate of soda, hard- 
wood ashes. 
4, Fertilizers most generally used in shade or sun: bone meal, hard-wood 
ashes, lime. 
V. Lawn grasses: 
1. Color—‘Kentucky blue grass” the standard. 
2. Texture—fine, soft, bent grass the standard.

SKY-STUDY 
BY FREDA SIGMUND, HIGHLANDTOWN SCHOOL t 
“The stars are a constant reminder to us of the thousands of worlds outside our 
own, and looking at them intelligently, lifts us out of ourselves in wonder and admira- 
tion for the anfinity of the universe, and serves to make our own cares and trials 
seem trivial.” 
Before any project can be undertaken a general knowledge of the unimaginable 
size of the universe should be given, together with some idea of the light-year, the

ever-moving characteristic of the stars, the relative ages of stars, and the multiplicity 
of the heavenly bodies. 
Project I: 
The Big Dipper and the other polar constellations are the night clocks of the sailors 
of the northern hemisphere. Let us see if we can tell time by them. 
1. Observe the Big Dipper every night for one week, if possible at intervals of four 
hours. 
2. Observe it on the same night of each month for the year. Then make at least 
five charts showing the relative position of the Polar Star and the Dipper. 
Deductions: 
a. The Big Dipper rises about four minutes earlier each day or about two hours 
earlier each month. 
b. The Big Dipper seems to revolve around the Polar Star once every twenty- 
four hours (caused by the earth’s revolution). 
c. The Big Dipper revolves in the opposite direction from the hands of the clock. 
d. In January the Big Dipper is east of the Polar Star with handle down, while 
in July at the same hour it is west of the Polar Star with handle up. 
Project IT: 
To learn some of the constellations about the Polar Star. 
1. The Little Dipper. 
2. Cassiopeia’s Chair. 
3. Cepheus. 
4, The Dragon. 
These constellations never rise or set in our latitude but seem to swing around the 
North Star once in twenty-four hours. 
With this study the child should be taught how to draw an imaginary straight 
line from one star to another and to perceive the angles which such lines make when 
they meet at a given star. 
Project III: 
(January, February, March.) Study Orion in the southern half of the heavens. 
It is one of the most beautiful of the constellations. 
In conjunction with this the splendid red star, Betelgeuse, the white star, Rigel, 
and the wonderful Pleiades, can be studied. 
Project IV: 
A summer chart and a winter chart would be well worth while. 
Project V: 
Observe the moon as often as possible for a month, beginning with the full moon. 
Let the children learn the phases of the moon. 
In connection with this the children should look for the ‘Lady in the Moon” 
and thus be introduced to the physical geography of the moon in a very general way. 
Project VI: 
The sundial—the class can make a sundial to place somewhere on the school ground. 
This can be done during the geometry, geography, or nature study period. 
A careful study of the shadow should be kept until the children see that the sun 
travels a path that is higher across the sky in June than the path it follows in De- 
cember. ‘ 
Project VII: 
Study the kinds and names of cloud forms. By observation and records tell which 
clouds bring rainy, cloudy, and fair weather.

OUR CANNING AND CORN CLUBS 
Many corn clubs are in operation in the schools of the County— 
particularly in the rural sections, and even such village schools as 
Catonsville with its large suburban population have seen the ad- 
vantage of corn clubs and have used the project to further economic 
and agricultural interests of the community. Of the status of can- 
ning clubs, Miss Katherine Braithwaite, formerly instructor in 
Household Economics in the Catonsville High School, now Home 
Demonstrator for Baltimore County, makes the following state- 
ment: 
The canning club movement in Baltimore County is yet in its infancy, but we are 
hoping much for it. Briefly stated, the purpose of the clubs is two-fold as I see it: 
1. To bring the college to the farm wife, by teaching her daughter the most ap- 
proved methods of work. , 
2. To make farm life more attractive to the county girl, by opening up new chan- 
nels for increasing her income. 
In organizing the clubs I have selected those rural schools where household arts is 
not taught. That the work may carry over into the regular school work during the 
winter, we plan to serve hot soup at noon, the soup mixture being canned by the club 
during the summer. Simple demonstrations in cooking will be given, also training 
in the serving of lunches. 
At present I meet the clubs for one hour twice a month. The first fifteen minutes 
is given to the club meeting conducted by the president; a report is made by each 
member of the progress of her garden work, and garden literature, record books, etc., 
are given out. The meeting is then turned over to me for a sewing period. Canning 
demonstrations will be given during the summer. 
The activities of the club are as follows: 
1. Cultivation of one tenth acre of land. 
2. Canning of 75 containers of fruit and vegetables. 
3. Sewing. 
The following clubs have been organized in the County. 
WHITE SCHOOLS COLORED SCHOOLS 
1. Granite (Enrolled 18) 7. Roslyn (Enrolled 16) 
2. Perry Hall (Enrolled 23) 8. Sparks (Enrolled 16) 
3. Fowblesburg (Enrolled 19) 
4, Boring (Enrolled 9): 
5. Cowenton 
6. Poplar. 
I notice much initiative displayed in conducting meetings in those schools where 
Junior Children’s Aid Societies are organized, Perry Hall for example. 
The meetings during the summer when food will be canned will be two hours long. 
The bulk of the canning will be done in the individual homes. I shall visit the homes 
and gardens of the club members during the canning season. 
The work among the colored people last year is really bearing fruit this year.

  ARITHMETIC 
PRIMARY GRADES 
Arithmetic presents two aspects of number determined by how 
many and how much, the one containing the idea of counting, the 
other, the idea of measuring, upon which much of our work is based. 
These two fundamental ideas call for experience with things in 
school and out, through which a definite comprehension of the 
world on the quantitative side is gained. The tendency today is 
to relate arithmetic to the common, familiar affairs of the life about 
us, so problems are introduced, almost from the beginning, which 
grow out of real situations, thereby adding interest to mechanical 
routine. Motivated drills to secure accuracy and speed are recog- 
nized as valuable and rise to their greatest height for whole numbers, 
in the third and fourth grades where mechanical work of this nature 
in the fundamentals makes its strongest appeal. 
Clearness in thinking and accuracy in expression, both oral and 
written, are prime requisites. The language of arithmetic should 
become familiar through oral discussion and concrete illustration. 
For this and other reasons oral work should take precedence over 
written in the primary grades. A teacher should be acquainted 
with needs and purposes of the work of the succeeding grades in 
order to make the proper approach without waste of time and energy. 
Care is taken to keep the work of each grade within the limits of 
the child’s ability. To teach a subject prematurely often causes 
arrested development. 
The purpose of each recitation should be clearly defined in the 
teacher’s mind. Lesson plans in arithmetic are as essential as in 
history: a part of the time devoted to drill and review and a part 
to developmental work. Means and methods must vary with the 
subject, the class, and the individual. In the well-organized reci- 
tation all pupils are actively employed. It is a mistake to teach 
one or two children and leave the rest to cultivate the habit of in- 
attention and aimless mind wandering. Arithmetic should culti- 
vate the power of application, sustained attention and concentration 
- of effort to a definite end. 
Development Lessons. Acctiracy and facility..are essentials. 
The steps are peecniain) application, ‘testing, helping the epupil   
-P-A-G-E-272
    262 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
which train in thinking. Careful, painstaking habits, clear reason- 
oning without confusion of words based on a knowledge of arith- 
metical facts are means to this end. Careless, slovenly thinking 
on the part of a teacher tends to impress the same habits in the 
pupil. Train children to be self-reliant by developing confidence’ 
and certainty in one’s work. Accuracy shall be considered first, 
then facility. Speed is gained only when the steps in the process 
of thinking have been made clear. Teach first, then drill. 
Drill Lessons. Drill is important to fix what has been under- 
stood. Drill work motivated through simple contests of time and 
skill, various devices of card, blackboard and games should be freely 
used. Systematic reviews are essential, since frequency and re- 
cency of recall insure retention in the memory. Intelligent drill is 
absolutely essential, the teacher being a master of drill, and not a 
drill master. 
Oral and written work. Oral work should consume practically 
all of the period of recitation in first and second grades, three-fourths 
of the time in third and in fourth, and should lead to an increasing 
independence of paper and pencil in computation. Only such work 
as cannot be done mentally should be recorded on paper. 
Individual needs. Failures in classes should be met by a care- 
full diagnosis of the trouble: viz., lack of knowledge of the proc- 
esses, lack of drill, lack of ability to reason, or inability to compute. 
Each group should receive special attention at stated intervals, 
using a class period once a week for special work of this nature. 
By this means greater uniformity of result may be secured. Simple 
practice tests in the fundamental processes and tests for measuring 
arithmetical ability should be given at stated intervals by which 
to determine growth. Graphic representation of individual and 
class results stimulates effort in the attainment of automatic control.

FIRST GRADE 
Children love rhythmic repetitions in form, in color, in sound, or in 
motions. They love,to play games and keep score; they love to 
barter; and through these interests and acquaintance with number 
‘ideas along the same lines can be presented with ease, interest, and 
profit. Interest in number is as pleasurable and spontaneous as 
interest in learning to saad, and sho 
of the child’ 8 life. 6 The       
-P-A-G-E-273
  
ARITHMETIC—FIRST GRADE 263 
that number work should begin seriously the first year. It does 
indicate that we should not wholly eliminate it, but rather so direct 
the activity in number relations that growth is possible, and that 
injurious habits or attitudes are avoided. 
Much stress will be placed on simple number games in which 
counting and measuring are combined. Counting at first with 
things, and later without them, affords opportunity for placing 
numbers in a series.) Number games with domino cards, and other 
devices, with a leader keeping score, will lead easily and naturally 
to simple combinations, and to learning to write figures.) No at- 
tempt will be made to give formal work, but when there is oppor- 
tunity for presenting number ideas in relation to the \story, the 
game, the garden work, the industrial arts, and schoolroom activ- 
ities, as in distributing and collecting or any material in counting, or 
anything which will further that work, it will be utilized by the 
teacher. |In the second half year certain definite periods shall be 
set aside for a series of number games and plays, through which 
certain number facts are to be gained. Drills upon these facts will 
be given at intervals, but always as games, never as formal work. 
One of the chief reasons for delaying the regular number work in 
the first half year is the language difficulty. The time is most 
wisely spent upon reading and language, and in giving children 
experience which clarifies the language of arithmetic. 
Seatwork should emphasize rhythmical repetition of number and 
form through the use of lentils, seeds, sticks, paper in border units; 
translations from object to pictorial symbol, to conventional symbol 
in word and figures; records of simple combinations in keeping scores. 
Most of the work should be with ofvlagd until children have learned 
the relative value of numbers 1 to 10. All seatwork should tend to 
strengthen accuracy, ease and skill, and therefore no written sym- 
bols should be employed until the corresponding number idea is 
clearly defined in the child’s mind. 
After the names of numbers are learned, there will be a tendency —— 
to copy names without reference to numbers of objects which they 
represent. This should be avoided. Comprehension of number 
ideas rests upon objective work in this grade, and furnishes the basis 
for the real number work in the next grade. : '

SECOND HALF YEAR 
1. Counting. Let the children count from 1 to 10, by ones; 
from 10 to 100 by tens. Count the children who are absent, num- 
ber of rows of desks, rainy and sunshiny days, pages of a book, 
numbers on a calendar, street numbers on doors. Count by l’s*™ 
by 2’s, as—children marching by. Count by 2’s forward and back- 
ward; by 1’s, 2’s, 5’s, 10’s, 15’s, 20’s—to 50, 100. 
2. Addition, Let the children learn the obvious combinations of 
two numbers through manipulation of materials in making borders 
with seeds, lentils, sticks, tablets, nature materials, and through 
games. 
3. Subtraction. Teach the inverse cases of addition work for 
speed and facility in both addition, subtraction, through handling 
a variety of material. 
4. Measures. Children will have occasion to handle the ruler, 
to talk about the inch, the six inch; the pint, the quart, the pound, 
the dozen, the half dozen; to spend a cent, a nickel, a dime, a dollar; 
to name and number the days of the week, the month. Let them 
gain some idea of the units of measures through rational experiences. 
Initiative on the part of the children in suggesting number tests is 
encouraged. 
5. Symbols. Present the symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for 
recognition when the opportunity offers. Teach children how to 
write figures correctly. 
_6. Problems. Give many oral problems involving one operation, 
connected with industrial arts, with school activities, with games. 
7. Games. Such games as Tossing the Ball, and counting, Bean 
Bag, Ring Toss, Target, etc., in which simple scores are kept. 
NUMBER THROUGH GAMES 
In introducing number in the first grade through the medium of 
games the purpose is: 
a. To create a social situation, i. e., a situation where there is 
a real need for number. 
b. To present work through the concrete; believing in the 
theory that objects do not necessarily make a problem concrete, 
only the problem that is real being concrete to the child. 
c. To get the greatest amount of effort the class is capable of 
in solving problems for themselves. 
Points to be observed in mee number ghee games.

or three days. Too many children in a group make the game un- 
interesting. Maintain intense interest thus securing supreme ef- 
fort. Let children as they finish seatwork observe the game. 
2. Let children keep their own score no matter how long it takes 
to place initials and record score. Help them without comment when 
they need help. 
3. If children. cannot give score help them by placing number of 
points scored on floor or blackboard as— 
Mary, 11 
Susan, 111 
Fred, 1 
and letting them count with you. Soon they can count abstractly 
with ease. 
4. Later on when children have some ability in counting scores 
let no child claim his score unless he can count it correctly. 
5. Later the seatwork may be based on the games, as adding com- 
binations used in game, keeping scores, etc. Let the game come 
first and have many games before written work is required. 
6. Remember that the game is a game, not a lesson to the child. 
Play the game for the game’s sake. Those who play hardest will 
work hardest in counting scores. The power of concentrated effort 
to count scores in the game carries over in the application to other 
problems than those of the game. 
RELAY RACE 
A good game to teach counting by 1, 2, 5, 10 or any number desired. 
Make two cylinders of cover paper, one red and one blue. Write on the board: 
Reds, Blues. Choose a captain for the Reds and one for the Blues, letting the cap- 
tainschoose the children for their lines from the groups playing the game. The cap- 
tains also may record the scores. 
Directly, or some distance in front of each line place two circles.

Place the red cylinder in A, and the blue cylinder in C. At a given signal the cap- 
tains rush forward and move the cylinders to B and D. As they run to the back of 
the line they touch the hands of the children next inline. These two run forward and 
move the cylinders back to A and B. They touch the hands of the next ones in the 
line who run forward and change the cylinders. This continues until the last child 
in one of the rows has moved the cylinder and is back at the end of the line. The

with scoring 1. The number of races to be made should be determined by the teach- 
er before starting the game. Ten or twelve isa good number. Children tell which 
side wins and how much ahead they are. 
GAME OF BEAN Bacs 
Aim: 
To teach any addition combinations desired. To give children power to add any 
combination. . 
  
ALK. | E.S. | | 
  
9 HEL 
Before beginning the game-the teacher draws diagram like the above for recording 
scores. 
Have three bean bags. Draw three circles of different sizes on floor. The bean 
bag thrown into the smallest circle, will count the most. A simple way to begin is 
with 1, 2 and 3 increasing the difficulty of the combinations as children show ability. 
Each child throws the three bags at a turn. One or two turns may be given as 
time allows. One is enough. Children tell who is the winner. Later on, sides may 
be chosen if desired. This gives a good problem in adding—to add the total score 
of each side. 
GAME OF RING THE BELLS (To teach any addition combination desired) 
Use a large square box. Fasten a string (use a heavy cord), of small bells across 
the center. The object of the game is to throw bean bags into the box without ring- 
ing the bells. This may count six. If the bag goes into the box but rings the bells 
this counts three. A bag outside the box scores nothing. Any other number may be 
substituted according to ability of group. It is well to use the same numbers in suc- 
cessive games for quite a while. ‘ 
Children record their own scores and name winners of the game. 
GAME OF TENPINS 
To teach adding by 1, 2, 5 or any number desired. To teach tables if desirable. 
(Tenpins with balls may be purchased for ten cents.) 
Arrange tenpins on the floor in an equilateral triangle. Children roll three balls 
trying to knock down as many pins as possible. Each pin knocked down to count as 
many points as the teacher may desire. 
GAME TO TEACH More AND LEss: 
From a pile of corn, say fifteen grains, the child who is “‘It”’ selects any number of 
grains he desires and the class guesses the number. If a child guesses seven, for in-
-P-A-G-E-277
  
ARITHMETIC—FIRST GRADE 267 
WK 
stance, “It” answers: “‘I have more than seven or Jess than seven,” as the case may be. 
As each guess is made the child responds with more or less. The one guessing cor- 
rectly, now is “It.” 
Guess How Many 
This game is for quick sensing of number groups. 
Have on your desk a number of wooden disks or cubes, or small objects made of 
clay, cubes, apples, or small cylindrical shaped boxes. Arrange in groups. 
oo OLOnG 0.0 
°. One 2 0, oo 
Divide the class into two sections with a captain for each section. Have each 
child of one section come to the desk, close eyes and pick up in one hand a group of 
objects; guess the number. If the guess is correct he may give the cubes to the cap- 
tain of his side. 
The children of the other section then must try to get as many cubes as possible. 
Then have the captain of each section hold up each cube while all the other children 
count in concert the number his side has won. The side having the greater number 
wins. 
Do not allow a child to count the objects he picks up by ones. He must use one 
hand only. He will probably not be able to recognize by touch more than five. 
§ How Many Movep 
If this game is used in teaching the number four, have four children stand in a row 
at the front of the classroom. Ask, ‘‘How many children are going to play this 
game?” ‘Well, you are going to play, too.” Then have those at desks shut their 
eyes, until the word “Ready” is called. Have the children in the group move to 
other places in the room in order to get such comments as the following as soon as 
the eyes are opened. 
“Two children moved to the bookcase and two to the door. Four children are 
playing the game.” The two and two return to form the row again while this is 
being said in order to prove the statement. Eyes shut again. “Three children 
moved to the blackboard and one to the window. Four children are playing the 
game.” Eyes shut again. ‘One child moved to the cupboard, one to the door, one 
to the blackboard, and one to a desk. Four children are playing the game.” 
For the subtraction facts of four, have a group of four children. Have them 
take turns in hiding, to teach 4—3, 4—2, 4—1,  ‘‘Four children were in the row, one 
is there now, three children are hiding.” This reply should be given by a child as 
soon as all eyes are opened. If he replies quickly and correctly he should be allowed 
the fun of finding those hidden. 
PLAYING STORE 
Say to the children, “I am going to play mother. Billy and Helen may be my 
children. Iam going to the store and I’ll spend all the pennies in my purse for you.” 
“George may be the storekeeper.” Give George a number of little toys cut out of 
cardboard, or drawn on cardboard, also some candies made of clay. Have him place 
his stock along the blackboard ledge. 
Begin taking money out of your purse, asking the children at desks, “Is this for 
my children?”’ ‘No, it’s nota penny, it’sa quarter.” And, as other pieces of money 
are shown, “No, it’s not a penny, it’s adime.” ‘No, it’s not a penny, it’s a nickel.” 
“No, that’s not a penny, it’s a fifty-cent piece.” ‘‘No, that’s not a penny, it’s a 
dollar bill.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  i COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Then take out a penny each time until you have taken out the six in the purse, 
having all the children count as you do it. ‘How many pennies have I to spend for 
my children?” 
“What shall I buy for you, Helen?” “And for you, Billy?” Go to the store- 
keeper and buy, spending three cents for one purchase and three cents for the other 
to get the combination three and three are six. “Who can count up the money I 
spent? If you know how to count the money, you can be the mother, or the store- 
keeper.” Do the same with four cents and two cents, five cents and one cent. 
Then choose one who has been a good counter for the mother, and one for the store- 
keeper, and two for the children, and play again. 
ADDING AND SCORING 
Aim: to cultivate skill in calculation. Place upon the board the following numbers: 
9 7 
6 4 2 
Bos 5 
0 1 3 
Let there be three rows of children with an equal number of children in each row. 
Teacher points to a number on the board. Call on first child in first row to give 
the other number necessary to make ten. As, for example, the leader points to 8, 
the child should say 2. If the leader points to 7 the child should say 3. This 
child is given three different numbers—as above. If all three are answered correctly, 
he makes a score of 3 for his row, if he misses one of them he scores 2 for his row. 
Then the child in second row answers, and so on until each child has a chance. A 
child from each row is chosen to keep score for his row at board: as 
First Row Second Row Third Row 
3 2 3 
1 3 0 
2 1 3 
1 2 2 
2 2 3 
3 3 3 
12 13 14 
The row making the highest score wins the game. V 
The First Lessons in Number of a formal nature have an underly- 
ing thread or plan which emphasizes a rational beginning in some 
real, tangible, experiences. An opportunity is given for free play 
through which a need for some essential number facts is felt. Di- 
rected, organized work along definite lines is presented at first with 
things, later without them, but always in a play spirit by which the 
children come to recognize the adult point of view as a help rather 
than something imposed upon them. An appeal is made to the child’s 
interest in drills through numerous games. Groups of problems re- 
lated to the daily activities of community life familiar to the child 
are presented. 
The plan of procedure is as follows: 
I. Experience: 
a. Play, work.

THE STUDY OF.THE NUMBER “4” 
I. EXPERIENCE 
The children have counted the edges and corners of the paper they use. they have 
folded a window with its four panes and told imaginative stories of happenings as 
viewed from their windows or they have made a seed box. This may be used as a 
starting point for the formal study of “4” that is to follow. 
II. Srupy oF NUMBER WHOLE

Use squares, sticks, or seeds. Let children discover what makes 4. Each child 
tells what he has found and continues until all facts have been experienced. 
2. Directed work: 
Equal groupings or rhythmical work, as follows: 
Study of four: 2.and 2; 1 and 2 and 1.

in a horizontal row on your desk. What does it make you think of? 
2. How many chocolates have you? Each one is how how long? How many inches 
long is your whole chocolate piece? 
3. Move two squares to the right oneinch. ———————_ squares are at the right.

SECOND GRADE 
The object of the work of the first and second grades is to aid the 
pupils to image the objects and groups of objects in proper ber 
relations; to make clear and definite quantitative imagery. ]#This 
is accomplished in some measure by the incidental, informal work 
of the first grade since through the games, drawing, construction 
work, and out-of-school experiences some ideas of counting, of 
adding, and subtracting, together with simple estimates and com- 
parisons are gained. «these vague number concepts and number 
terms furnish the basis for more formal work in the second grade. 
The plan of procedure is fundamentally the same as far as utilizing 
the play spirit, and providing motive are concerned, but more at- 
tention is paid to drill by which to attain automatic memory results. 
While“all phases of number relation will be presented through 
objects in the analytic study of a number, the leading topic for the 
second grade will be addition with its inverse case, or subtraction. 
Counting will emphasize the relation of a number to a series, and 
the series idea is the basis of the number concept. Each number is 
recognized as occupying a certain place in the number scale, and 
should be committed to memory. 
\Objects should be used freely in all initial work, but should be con- 
tinued only so long as necessary. When they get in the way of the 
child’s thinking, of his securing memory results, then they are use- 
less. 
Oral and written addition and subtraction drills are given, and 
written work is placed on the board. From counting and analysis of 
number the children learn certain facts of the multiplication tables, 
while the inverse cases of these introduce them to division. With 
objects they find halves and fourths. In this way they learn the 
relation of pint to quart, quart to gallon, inch to foot, foot to yard, 
Telling time furnishes opportunity for teaching Roman numerals 
I to XII; number games call for higher numbers, and often, more 
difficult operations, and should not be withheld, therefore “carry- 
ing’’ in addition toward the end of the second half year is advisable.
-P-A-G-E-285
Ib 
ARITHMETIC—SECOND GRADE 
  Written work should be minimized, much of it being done under 
the supervision of the teacher. This necessitates blackboard work. 
Oral work should be distributed as follows: one-fourth of all time 
on counting, reading, and writing numbers; one-fourth on addition 
combinations; one-half of all the time given to analysis and syn- 
thesis of number work, with the corresponding applications to every 
day experiences. As nearly as possible all lines of work are carried 
along together. There is no necessity for limiting the number to 
100 as long as pupils are not confused. An idea back of the number 
presented makes it tangible to the child. The work includes count- 
ing, grouping, measuring, reading, and writing of numbers, ac- 
quaintance with units of measurement needed in various kinds of 
handwork in the various school and home activities. Games, drills, 
and memorizing should be used extensively but always kept within 
the pupil’s grasp. 
REFERENCE Books: Harris and Waldo, First Journeys in Numberland; Smith; 
Primary Arithmetic: Myers, Primary Arithmetic; Smith, Arithmetic Games; 
pono Education by Plays and Games; Thorndike, Arithmetic Series, Books I, 
Time allotment: Recitation, 15 minutes per day or 75 minutes per 
week. Oral work in the main, but occasionally tested by written 
record of abstract combinations. Seatwork, 15 minutes per day, or 
75 minutes per week. Total, 150 minutes per week. 
First HALF YEAR 
While 100 is indicated ,as the limit for counting, reading, and 
writing numbers, there is no reason for keeping within this limit as 
long as the pupils are not confused. 
1. Counting. Limit to 100. 
Count and write by 1’s to 50, and backward by 1’s from 50; by 
tens to 100, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3. 
By 5’s to 50, beginning with 1, 2, 3. 
By 2’s to 20, beginning with 1, 3,3 ; in preparation for addition 
and multiplication tables. 
Applications: 
Count schoolroom materials; pencils, books, erasers, crayons, by 1’s;5’s. Number 
of children by 2’s as in marching by 2’s; children in attendance by 2’s, absence, tardi- 
ness, age, size, weight, etc. In nature-study count number of seeds, parts of flowers, 
legs or wings of animals. Build up number series through the use of inch cubes, 
sticks, square tablets. Use card games for drill. ' 
2. Development of number relations: 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; 7, 14; 9, 18; 12, 24; 16, 32; 25, 50.

d. Applications to real problems—including measures, and other every day 
experiences. 
e. Development and drill upon one or more particular number facts in relation 
to the number whole. 
f. Addition, and subtraction stressed in written work, though multiplication 
and division and part-taking are maintained in oral work. 
g. Games. Table drills—which eventually lead to the completion of the 25 
addition combinations where a sum does not exceed 10, and the 45 easy subtrac- 
tion combinations. 
_ Lesson Plan: See “Study of 4” in previous grade for suggestive treatment of a 
number. (P. 269.) 
3. Addition. Teach the children to add 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9..to any figure not 
exceeding 10. The 25 combinations should be made strictly automatic through 
memory work, allowing no counting after first experience with things. It grows out 
of counting, but is quite different from counting. It is the memorized results of 
experience and must be mastered purely thorugh memory work. If a child hesitates, 
give the result. Adding must become autematic memory work, and teachers must 
test pupils on the combinations that pupils have committed to memory. The 25 
combinations to be taught in the grades are these:

and fourths of numbers as the complementary facts of multiplication,—are to be 
taught. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  ARITHMETIC—SECOND GRADE 279 
7. Fractions. 
‘Use and write fractions as needed in the applied problems, games, and objective 
seatwork. Let the meaning come from the objective seatwork. Use freely in part- 
taking as another form of expressing partition or division. Teach children to use 
the fractional form in expressing division in simple applied problems: 1|2, 2|2; 1/4, 
2|4, 3/4, 4/4; 1)3, 2/3, 3/3. 
8. Measures, 
Asneed for these arise in actual practice, teach the units of measure; the quarter, 
the half dollar, dime and nickel; foot, yard, pint, quart, gallon; how to tell time by 
the clock; how to write the current date; how to write a house number; the dozen, 
and half dozen. 
9. Symbols. 
Teach the signs of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, but put little 
stress upon them. Use the symbol only when confusion might arise without it. 
Do not use word and symbol. Familiarize the child with the column form. Teach 
the writing of numbers to three places. Write the house number. Roman numerals 
of clock face to XII. Emphasize the correct form. 
10. Problems. 
a. School activities—materials and their cost: scores in games, etc. 
b. Out-of-school activities; toys, fruits, vegetables, used in buying and selling; 
playing store; car rides. 
c. Original problems by children involving the new number relations. 
d. Problems without figures. Teach children to read arithmetic. 
11. Games. 
a. Drill: card games: toy money, target, bean bag, domino. 
b. Ring games in which scores are Beat: 
c. Thinking games. 
SECOND HALF YEAR 
1. Counting. Limit to 200. 
Count and write by 2’s to 50, 100; 5’s, 10’s to 100 forward and backward; by 
4’s to 48; 3’s, 6’s to 36; to 72; count by units of measure. Translation exercises, 
e. g.: 
. 2 pints equal 1 quart. 
3 pints equal 1*quart and 1 pint. 
4 pints equal 2 quarts. 
2. Development of number relations. 
Observe the following order: 12, 24, 36: 24, 48; 30, 60; 50, 100. 
Plan of procedure: | 
a. Rational out-of-school experience as starting point. 
b. Free play discoveries made by child of the number facts within the number,

ARITHMETIC—SECOND GRADE 281 
In the teaching of each group of combinations, the following steps are taken and 
always in the same order: 
Step A. Memorize perfectly the combinations as they stand above in both oral 
and written form. Give drill in pointing to the figures as they stand; move from right 
to left, and vice versa; from top to bottom Erase the sums, continue the exercise as 
before. If the slightest hesitation Appears, rewrite the sums. Drill until the pupil 
can readily give the sums at sight; also accompany these exercises with a thorough 
drill on the oral form. 
Step B. Use the several combinations in the different decades of the number scale, 
as the 60’s, 70’s, by prefixing the tens. Children need to have drill in the upper por- 
tion of the scale as well as the first part. 
Step C. Use each combination mastered in building columns; at first, two addends, 
increasing to four or more in single columns and three and four in double columns. 
Keep within the combinations of the groups. Carrying. Recognition of tens.

» THIRD GRADE 
Society demands ability to count; to read, and to write numbers; 
accuracy and rapidity in the four fundamental processes operating 
in integers and fractions; simple exercises in the application of these 
processes to the real problems of life; and a knowledge of the tables 
_ of measurements which are in common use. Whatever is given in 
the primary grades should emphasize these essentials and place 
them within the grasp of the child’s ability. ; 
The work of the second grade aims to familiarize the child with 
the relation of numbers in a series through much rhythmical count- 
ing. The twenty-five addition facts are mastered as pure memory 
work, and many multiplication facts gained through counting and 
éxperience with materials are made familiar to the child though not 
necessarily memorized by him. 
Material. The third year’s work begins with a review of the, 
previous work, and much is still to be accomplished. The 5 
plication tables are to be completed and memorized, the a 
and subtraction facts are repeated and extended until mast 
produces automatic recall. Application of the simple arithmetical. 
facts and the fundamental processes in simple one-step problems 
related to rational interests are presented in both oral and written 
work. 
Method. The language of arithmetic should receive considera- 
tion through the frequent presentation of problems without figures, 
through attention to the statement of a problem on the part of 
both ee and children, and to the reading of arithmetic with 
the intention of discussing the process involved. .Avoid confusion 
of ideas; see that the children thoroughly understand the prob- 
lem and the process before beginning to solve. Do not reduce the 
work to mere form, but keep it within the comprehension of the 
children. Additional aids to clearness are found in blackboard il- 
lustrations, in the use of concrete materials, in taking a similar 
simple problem with small numbers. In the beginning all concrete 
problems should involve only one of the processes and the same 
       
-P-A-G-E-293
ARITHMETIC—THIRD GRADE 283 
kind of problems should be continued until the form is thoroughly 
fixed. Much stress is placed on concrete oral work, as well as on 
abstract drills. While the reasoning and application phases of the 
work are,constantly kept developing there is no neglect of oppor- 
tunity to develop habituation in the use of number facts and proc- 
esses. 
Summaries and reviews are frequent, recurring at regular in-~ 
tervals. The Courtis Standard Tests in Fundamentals will be given 
three times a year, and graphs made to help each child to know his 
own rating. The work if kept within the grasp of the child’s ability 
will result in accurate individual work. Always teach slowly, and 
carefully, the process first, then drill. Do not teach by drill. Teach 
first, then drill, and the more effective the teaching the less need of 
drill. Both teacher and children should keep a record in a note 
book of the difficulties which arise, and consciously work toward 
their eradication. 
Small groups of children should be organized at intervals for 
special help, but in the usual recitation, the teacher should aim to 
hold the attention of the whole group by good teaching. To this 
end the outline which follows provides for systematic teaching and 
drill in the processes—a drill which must be continued beyond the 
primary grades, if the desired standard of accuracy and rapidity 
ecured. 
al Work. At least three-fourths of the time should be devoted 
ely, snappy drill in both abstract and concrete problems. 
Written Work. One-fourth of the time should be devoted to 
written work.

e. Teach a few combinations at a time rather than a table at a time. Each 
combination and its inverse should be taught together, and division and fractional 
parts used freely, as: é 
Three 6’s are 18. 18 +3 =6 ” 
Six 3's are 18. 18+6=3 
1-3 of 18 = 6 = 1/6 of 18 = 3 
6 is what part of 18? 
f. Carry forward the work in division, so that it includes the numbers that do 
not give an integer answer; as, 
18+3=6 19 + 3 = 64nd 1 rem. 
g. Mass the drill where it ey a needed; as in 3’s. in 
8x9 = 3x07 = 621 
h. Records should be kept 4 each pupil of his own difficult combinations, for 
reference, and future drill. 
2. Factoring: Find through experiment the aca which produce a number, as 
6x6 18,.x-22, 3x34

children, growing out of real situations. Smith gives you the method; Myers, and 
Belfield and Brooks give you problems with content; and the regular work should sug- 
gest others. Make them practical. The articles bought and sold should be articles 
known to pupils, articles that they will probably be buying. Have prices correct. 
Make price lists which contain accurate data, 
3. Problems without figures; one-step problems only, to develop power to read 
arithmetic intelligently, and to reason clearly.

VI. Devices: 
Use devices to keep work from growing monotonous. 
1. Cards for drill on combinations. Cards containing problems, both abstract 
and concrete, for seatwork drills. 
2. Charts for class use: Grocery list, presenting articles in common use with 
current prices. . Flower market sales. Earnings—by the hour, by the day, by the 
week, or month, of workers in the community; weight of children; test weights ob- 
tained by actual measurement. 
8. Cards: For individual use. Make cards, with a written problem on one side, 
and abstract drill work on the other. Use in competition work, letting a pupil keep 
a record of the number worked correctly in a month. 
4, A horizontal line of numbers on board with one number written below to 
be added to each one above, or to be subtracted, or multiplied by.” Use the square, 
circle, perpendicular line, and others. Change frequently. 
5. Competitive tests by rows, by classes, in oral work or in written, at board or 
seat. 
a. Devise team work, as three rows in class, indicate each row on board as 
A, B, C. Give a problem to the children in front seats. The one who answers 
correctly first scores one for hisrow. The next problem is given to the next three, 
and so on. 
b. A class or row stands:—each child is given a problem in turn. When he 
answers correctly, he sits. Those who fail, remain standing and are given aid.

Use charts and cards freely as a stimulus to effort. Apply addition and sub- 
traction in simple written problems involving children’s affairs and interests. Re- 
view the other fundamental processes, multiplication and division; in oral work 
mainly. 
Let the problems be children’s problems, not adult problems. A child’s inter- 
est in formal work is real; but it is short-lived. Problems must have content; there- 
fore connect them with everyday affairs. Keep the work concrete.

II, Measurements: 
Linear: Inch, foot, yard. 
Dry and liquid measure. 
Square: Compare square inch and square foot. 
1. All this work must be kept concrete, based upon actual estimation and 
measurement. Use Speer blocks, cubes, paper, blackboard illustrations, other 
material which children can observe and handle, and keep within the limit of simple, 
oral problems. ‘ 
a. Make estimates of: lengths; height; distances; e. g., edge of book, of paper. of 
window pane, of window ledge; of walk in school yard. Measure to determine 
actual distances, etc. 
b. Find perimeters of objects which pupils can see, handle, walk around, and 
measure with a tape or yard stick. 
c. Make measures: foot, yard, sq. in., sq. yd.

ARITHMETIC—THIRD GRADE 293 
d. Children should cut the sq. in., sq. ft., sq. yd., from paper, and use in cover- 
ing surfaces. The real, tangible experience in measuring lengths, heights, distances 
with tape, and the yard stick, and these very simple experiences extended to measur- 
ing surface by known units of measure, the square inch, the square yard, the 
square foot, will furnish an apperceptive basis for good work along these lines, 
without confusion. 
e. It is essential that the work be kept simple, concrete, and within the pupil’s 
range of experience.

V. Measuring Arithmetical Ability: 
1. Courtis’ Standard Tests. 
FOURTH GRADE 
The work of the third grade aims to secure automatic memory 
recall of addition and multiplication facts and to familiarize the 
child with the fundamental processes; however, with the summer 
vacation intervening and the tendency to forget in forty days one- 
half of what is apparently well learned, reviews are not only import- 
ant, but indispensable. Not only reviewing the work previously 
given but re-learning is necessary. Each child may well keep a 
record of the things forgotten, and thus the sooner succeed in ef- 
fective recall and make progress. The important thing on the one 
hand is to review the essential points of difficulty and to avoid aim- 
less rehearsal, and on the other to avoid encroaching upon the field 
of endeavor of succeeding grades. Three things should be kept 
constantly in mind: simplification, elimination, and the language 
of arithmetic. " 
Simplification leads to the use of rational one-step problems, to 
well-defined oral work which aids clear thinking, and to the avoid- 
ance of unwieldy numbers in abstract work. Elimination of pon- 
derous numbers, even for practice, as in multiplication or long di- 
vision is necessary; all work with fractions which does not deal 
with simple fractions and mixed numbers as needed in actual prac- 
tice; square and cubic measure, except to present the unit idea of 
the inch, the foot, the yard, in surface and volume, through concrete 
work wholly oral and objective, should be avoided. The language 
of arithmetic should receive consideration in daily work with prob- 
lems without figures, in the avoidance of complicated analyses or 
explanations and, on the other hand, an insistence upon a vocabulary 
which aids in a simple, clear statement when needed. 
Standardization is essential. In attempting to secure uniformity 
of results tests should be given from time to time by which growth or 
retardation is indicated. The Courtis Standard Tests aim to 
measure arithmetical ability, and are given at stated intervals dur-
-P-A-G-E-305
  ; ARITHMETIC—FOURTH GRADE 295 
ing the year. Graphs should be made to help each pupil to know 
his own rating. Following the plan begun in third grade, team- 
work should be encouraged by which the more skilled members of 
the class group become the drill masters of their less fortunate class 
members. 
Material. The fourth grade work is but an extension of what 
has already been begun. Long division is the new feature of the 
work which is not presented until midyear, in order that multiplica- 
tion be emphasized, and that short division be used wherever di- 
visors are of one figure, or of one figure followed by ciphers. Count- 
ing is continued, variety being introduced by beginning with 1, 2, 
etc., to 10, and adding 2’s, 3’s, to 12’s. The common weights and 
measures are formally set forth in tables and memorized. 
Method. This is pre-eminently the grade for mechanical drill. 
Abstract problems are performed with evident interest, without 
regard to their concrete significance. Speed and accuracy in hand- 
ling the mechanics of arithmetic in the four fundamental processes 
is the desired end. Pupils should be taught to check and prove 
all work. Check addition by adding the columns in reverse order. 
Check subtraction by adding subtrahend and difference together to 
give the minuend. Check multiplication by going over it carefully 
a second time. Check division by multiplying the quotient by 
divisor and adding the remainder, if any. The habit of checking 
and proving results should be established by practice. 
Oral Work. The habit of estimating approximately, or evalua- 
ting a problem should also be established to avoid unreasonable re- 
sults. Problems without figures are given to aid materially in de- 
veloping the power to read arithmetic intelligently, and to reason, 
using in solution a simple form. Oral work takes precedence over 
written, written work being used only when numbers involved are 
too large, or relations too complicated to be carried accurately in 
the mind. 
Each recitation time should provide for oral work the character 
of which may be one of the following phases: drills on tables, ad- 
dition, multiplication, measures and their applications; problems 
without figures; work with small numbers, emphasizing one pro- ¢” 
cess in the solution of one-step problems until the form is fixed. ( 
Require the simple statement of the result, except when you wish ~ 
~ to test the process by which the result is obtained. Then a brief 
analysis should be given. The record of the result is sufficient in 
written “Oral work.” 
At least half of the time should be given to drills, both oral and 
written, to secure accurate estimation. 
€
-P-A-G-E-306
  296 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Written Work. Written work embodies the same points, me- 
chanism and reasoning. Accuracy and speed in operation are secured 
only by abundant practice, and in reasoning by explaining why the 
mechanical work is performed as it is. Guard against written 
statements that may be untrue and a waste of time. By increas- 
ing their ability, to handle numbers orally, train pupils to use paper 
and pencil less. | In problems too difficult to solve orally, written 
expression should be clear, simple, and direct. The written work 
should be preceded always by these steps in oral discussion:— 
1. What is to be found out? 
2. What is given in the problem that will help to find this, or, 
what do I know? 
3. How shall I proceed? 
4. A statement of the work done. 
5. The operations performed. 
6. Does the work seem reasonable? 
7. The work checked. 
In brief: 
1, The situation—what? 
2, The method of solution—how? 
3 The record of work. : 
Conclusions will need to be arrived at slowly and carefully. Train 
the child to read arithmetic thoughtfully, and to express the arith- 
metical ideas in clear, concise, correct terms in both oral and written 
work, the simpler, the better. Illustrations, by both teacher and 
pupils, are additional aids in the solution of written problems. 
Make the work vital and keep it within the comprehension of the 
children. 
Time allotment: Recitation, 25 minutes per day, 125 minutes per 
week. One-third of the time is given to oral drills, one-third to 
discussion of problems; one-third to written testing. Seatwork, 
25 minutes daily, or 125 minutes per week. Total, 250 minutes 
per week.

c., Change of common fraction to decimal form to gain facility. 
The full development of this subject is left for the fifth grade. 
The work should be carried forward in this grade in simple and ob- 
jective form as needed. There should be little written work in 
simple fractions: and all oral work should be illustrated by means 
of paper and blackboard work to avoid confusion of ideas.. Observe 
that only such fractions are to be used in addition and subtraction 
whose denominators are determined by inspection. Simple decimals, 
introduced wholly through dollars and cents, may be changed to 
fractional form, as a convenience, thus $.12}4 may be handled as 
$14, 9.75 as $34. Some familiarity is gained through parts of a 
dollar (parts of a hundred), and the term per cent. is used. But all 
this work is kept within the very simple range of the pupil’s ex- 
perience.

In Third Grade ideas of linear measure have been gained through experience with 
units of measure, in., ft., yd., in measuring lengths, heights, distances in terms of 
inches, feet and yards. Continue concrete work within these limits, if pupils show

Keep all work within the grasp of pupils by presenting the work wholly in relation to 
surfaces which children can handle and measure, thus verifying their statements. 
Keep the work both oral and concrete. 
Estimates should be made of areas of books, of desks, of window panes, of win-

Upon completing the year’s work the pupils should have acquired 
automatic memory results in the forty-five combinations and multi- 
plication tables; and should have acquired the ability to read and 
write numbers within six orders; to use the four processes accurately, 
and with a fair degree of rapidity within the field of integers; to 
solve problems within the range of their experience involving these 
processes; to handle the facts of denominate numbers with ease; 
to use simple fractional forms intelligently. 
MATHEMATICS IN GRAMMAR GRADES: SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING. 
I. The Aim in Teaching Arithmetic (From Young: The 
Teaching of Mathematics). 
As purposes of the teaching of arithmetic these may be mentioned: 
1. “To teach the child the mathematical type of thought. 
2. “To arouse his interest in the quantitative side of the world 
about him; arithmetic is a commercial subject. 
3. “To give accuracy and facility in simple computations. _ 
4, “To impart a working knowledge of a few practical applica- 
tions of arithmetic. 
5. “To prepare the way for further mathematics.” 
II. What is comprehended in the solution of any piece of 
mathematical work (Young): 3 
“The execution ‘of any piece of mathematical work consists of . 
several parts, none of which may be neglected. ee 
1. “Grasping the problem—getting a clear idea of what is known 
and what is required. 
2. “Planning the work—deciding how to ascertain the desired 
information from the known facts. The first plan made may not 
be successful, but there should always be an intelligent plan. 
3. “Execution of the plan. This is carried so far that one is 
convinced either that the plan will not work (in which case he tries 
another), or until the result is attained. 
4. “Testing the result. Compare the result with the data of 1, 
and make certain that one has done what he set out to do. 
Ill’ Drill—Accuracy and rapidity: 
“There is not as much ¢rial and error with small children as there 
should be. There is too much mnemonic drill. There should be 
» more trial and error, but always with ver'fication.”” (Thorndike.) 
Accuracy and a fair amount of speed in the performance of simple 
atithmetical operations are demanded by practical needs.
-P-A-G-E-319
  ARITHMETIC—GRAMMAR GRADES 309 
“The employer maintains that it is difficult to hire a boy who is 
accurate and who has a mastery of even the four fundamental 
processes. ‘ 
“Teachers in the upper grades contend that the pupils who enter 
their classes are not prepared to carry the work because their think- 
ing is illogical and their ability in computation is poor.” 
The demand then is for accuracy in both thought and computation. 
David Eugene Smith says, “It is the loose manner of writing out 
solutions tolerated by many teachers that gives rise to half the 
mistakes in reasoning which vitiate the pupil’s work, and teachers 
are coming to recognize that inaccuracies of statement tend to beget 
inaccuracy of thought and so should not be tolerated in the school- 
There is a mathematical language, just as there is an automobile 
language, or a literary language, or a music language. Sufficient 
drill to insure this is indispensable: That this drill should be chiefly 
on the simplest and easiest combinations and not carried on into 
the more complex forms until the simplest are well mastered, has 
already been pointed out. 
IV. Practical applications: 
“In teaching practical applications of arithmetic the object is not 
so much to anticipate_all possible applications that the pupil may 
have occasion to make, as to develop the power to apply, and to show 
how indispensable arithmetic is in every day life. 
“It is better to teach the unchanging fundamental principles and 
7 operations and train to adaptibility in applying them wherever 
needed, than to attempt to give a semi-professional training which 
may be out of date by the time the opportunity comes to put into 
practice. 
“As to subject matter, the line may perhaps be drawn by including 
only such problems as average citizens might have occasion to use 
without following any particular trade or occupation. (This may 
include problems about many trades and occupations, but only such 
as would arise in the experience of those not following the trade or 
occupation in question.)” 
Thorndike says: “‘The best solution for making arithmetic touch 
the life-side is to have several or many text-books in arithmetic that — 
embody the real life the child may encounter: cash-girl, Saturday 
night clerk, keeping household accounts. 
“There are two kinds of problems: 
a. ‘The real problem or real life situation to the child. 
b. ”The described problem. This is harder than the real prob- 
lem. (Descrited problems are sometimes real situations.) 
‘ < 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  310 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
“The real problem should precede the teaching of the process. 
Then the mere manipulation should be freed from real life.”

man: The Teaching of Arithmetic): 
1. Inaccurate: 34+4=7+5=12X2=24 
Accurate: 3+44=7; 7+5=12; 12xX12=24

ber 
7. Inaccurate: 15°=1 hour of time Accurate: 15° correspond to 1 hour of 
time. 
VI. Accuracy and computation (checks, approximation 
and verification): 
The subject of checks is closely related to that of accuracy of 
computation. Even the professional mathematician does not 
guarantee the accuracy of his results until he has applied to them 
some adequate check. 
Some simple checks will be found in the basal text for the grade, 
and should be used regularly and systematically by the pupils. 
1. Checks and verification: 
“The child feels a strong need of a check, and will-have it. The 
only question is which—the book of answers, the dictum of teacher, 
or his own verification? Let him verify, even if he works only one- 
third as many problems. Each verification is a problem. When 
by repeated verification he feels himself that he can dispense with 
verification, and still guarantee the correctness of his results, let him 
do so. The essential thing is that he get the result right and know 
TED RG 
ue | ei 
ie   
 
-P-A-G-E-321
ARITHMETIC—GRAMMAR GRADES S14 
that itis right. He will in addition have gained what is more valua- 
ble than skill in computation,—well-grounded self-confidence. In 
actual life there are neither answer books nor kind teachers. The 
work must be right; mistakes usually mean loss to those who make 
them.” 
“Addition may be checked by adding up and down, subtraction by 
adding the difference to the subtrahend, multiplication by breaking 
the multiplier up into two factors and multiplying by each in turn, 
division by multiplying quotient and divisor, etc. The solution 
of every problem, however, is made up simply of a succession of 
these operations. Each one of these should be checked before 
going on. In many instances, especially where the numbers are 
small, repetition or careful scrutiny of the work of that step is suffic- 
ient check. Particular types of problems sometimes have conven- 
ient checks of their own; for example, in problems involving equa- 
tions, substituting the result found in the relations given in the 
problem; in square root, squaring the result, etc.” (Brown and 
Coffman.) 
2. Approximating or estimating as a check: 
If teachers would drill their pupils more frequently in approximat- 
ing results, the number of absurd and impossible answers would be 
reduced. In such questions as 48xX36=? achild should quickly 
note the approximate value of 48, which is 50, and of 36, which is 
35, and say, ‘“The answer will be about 1750.” Then the teacher 
should insist upon the verification of the approximation. Too often 
pupils submit an answer of $480 when the result should have been 
$4.80, or a result of $54.16, when the correct result is a hundred 
“times as large. 
Approximating results has this great advantage: it aids a child 
to sense the numerical value of numbers. In such a question as 
“318 divided by °/15?” the pupil too often goes heedlessly into the 
process. He may probably arrive at the correct result, but perhaps 
if you should ask him “‘About how much will the answer be?’’ he 
will reply heedlessly; approximated answers to this question, given 
by children in the same class, have brought forth such a range of 
answers as “‘4,” “8,” “14,” “16” when it should have been a habit, 
even in the sixth grade, for a pupil to have thought of “314 as about 
3,” of “hs as about 34.” “therefore, the answer will be about 6— 
really less than 6, but more than 5.” By verification the result 
can be proven as follows:

VII. Elimination: | 
The progress of our age and the needs of the day permit marked 
omissions in the subject matter of arithmetic, even as it was taught 
during the last decades of the nineteenth century. Some of the omis- 
sions are: 
1. G. C. D. or L. C. M. of large numbers otherwise than by 
factoring. 
2. Fractions with large or unusual denominators 
The following letter from the ‘Hochschild, Kohn & Co.” depart- 
ment store of Baltimore should help us to rationalize the work; it 
was written to one of the Baltimore County School children who 
asked for information regarding the fractions in use in the store: 
March 13, 1915. 
MASTER FREDDIE JONES, 
Bengies, Md. 
DEAR FREDDIE: Your card of March 9th has been received, and we are glad to 
amswer your question in regard to the fractions which we use in this store: 
The usual fractions, or parts of things, which we sell are parts of pounds, parts 
of yards and parts of dozens; we sell 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 3/4 of a pound of candy;'1/2, 
1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8 and 7/8 of a yard of cloth or ribbon; 1/12, 1/2. 1/3, 2/3, 
1/4, 3/4, 1/6, 5/6, 5/12, 7/12 and 11/12 of a dozen buttons, or of a dozen plates or cups 
and saucers, etc. 
These are the fractions which are used most often, though sometimes a customer 
may ask for exactly 7 inches of a yard of lace or 19 inches of ribbon. Can you tell 
what fraction of a yard we would sell her in such a case? Can you tell why we do 
not sell 2/8, 2/4, 3/12, 4/8, and 10/12 of anything? 
Do you like your arithmetic lessons, and do you find fractions easy or difficult? 
In any case they are very important for a boy to master if he is going to be a success- 
ful business man. Are they not? 
Very truly yours, ; 
HOCHSCHILD, KOHN & Co. 
3. Compound or complex fractions as a special topic may also 
well be omitted. | 
4. All measures not actually in use in the community at large: 
Troy, apothecaries, dram. 
5. Reduction of decimals to common fractions and decimals be- 
yond thousandths should receive little emphasis. 
6. Circulating decimals. The topic should be studied as a part 
of infinite series in algebra. . 
7. Square root and cube root except by factoring. 
8. Profit and loss as a separate subject. 
9. True discount. Bank discount has taken its place entirely. 
10. Partial payments in the form of state rules and irregular en- 
dorsements. 
. 11. Equation of payments.
-P-A-G-E-323
ARITHMETIC—GRAMMAR GRADES 313 
12. Compound proportion has been largely replaced by unitary 
analysis. Simple proportion is of some importance, but is best 
treated as an equality of two fractions. 
13. Business problems which do not conform to the usage of the 
day. 
14. Large numbers and exercises involving many numbers should 
also be excluded as a rule. 
Large numbers when used should usually be taken from real life: 
statistics from newspapers; financial facts of political, commercial, 
and industrial matters—where the use of large numbers is neces- 
sitated by the facts of the case. 
VIII. Definitions and rules (From Young, The Teaching of 
Mathematics): ¢ 
“Two extremes with respect to the treatment of rules have been 
advocated. ‘The first makes the work of arithmetic largely the me- 
chanical application of rules dogmatically stated. The other at- 
tempts to banish rules entirely from the subject. The golden mean 
would seem to lie in leading the child first to understand the pro- 
cess by repeated thinking out of all its steps; second, to notice 
that in all the problems the procedure has been the same, then to 
describe the process so that it can be applied in other problems 
without thinking out the whole process anew. This succinct di- 
rection isarule. In other words, rules are very valuable auxiliaries 
when they are reached by the child himself under guidance and assist- 
ance; when he recognizes a rule as a convenient way of stating for 
permanent preservation and use, the processes which he has found 
and used ina tentative manner. With respect to the topic to which 
it relates, the rule is a summary, at the close of the work; for the 
future, it is a tool to be used whenever needed.” 
IX. Varying forms of solution: 
Very few operations are so simple that they cannot be performed 
in different ways. Even the fundamental operations are no ex- 
ceptions. The question then arises: To what extent is it advisable 
to teach only one form of solution, and to require adherence to this 
form? 
It would seem that a simple form should be carefully taught at 
first; that will of course be used which, on the whole, is the most 
easily understood and applied. After it has been sufficiently mas- 
tered in theory and practice alternate forms may be introduced, if 
needed, and compared with the form first taught. After one mode 
of solving some type of problem has been sufficiently mastered, it 
is instructive and helpful to study other forms also, but it is ques-
-P-A-G-E-324
ee ee 
314 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
tionable whether as a rule advantage is gained by teaching a second 
mode while the first is not comprehended. “It is easier not to 
change horses in the midst of the stream.” 
X. Oral and written arithmetic: 
I. ORAL ARITHMETIC 
The importance of oral arithmetic is generally recognized. The 
term is here used to cover all work, of which none is written, whether 
it is actually rehearsed in words or simply performed in the thoughts. 
In this sense the typical form of arithmetic is oral; writing is‘an aid 
that is used when the numbers involved become too large or the 
relations between them too complicated to be carried accurately 
in mind. Written work is indispensable, but it is only so because 
of the weakness of the mind. Jn most of our classes too much written 
work is required. : 
“This gives a hint for the order of written and oral work. The 
oral work precedes;, in it are cultivated especially the idea of num- 
ber, intelligent grasp of the-numerical relations and processes, 
clearnéss of thought and speech, the power to grasp a problem clear- 
ly and to make simple inferences. In it, principles and methods 
are made clear by use of very small numbers; when these are under- 
stood the numbers are gradually made larger and the data more. 
complex. When no longer easily carried in the mind written work 
comes to the rescue, and of course has a technique of its own to be 
learned. 
“Written and oral work are complementary phases of the same 
subject, the same instruction. To separate them into two distinct 
subjects, with separate class periods, text-books and topics, is as 
unwise as it would be to have one class period regularly devoted to 
oral geography and another quite separately to written geography.” 
II. WRITTEN ARITHMETIC 
‘David Eugene Smith in Teaching of Arithmetic says: 
“The fundamental question is the same: Shall written work be 
considered from the standpoint of the answer only; as a business 
man would be inclined to do, or from the standpoint of the logic of 
the school, the often non-practical school? 
“We need to distinguish between two lines of work, equally ime 
portant; the one relates to accuracy and speed in operation, th- 
getting of an answer as a business man would, with no circumlocu- 
tion and no superfluous symbols or operations; this is the me- 
chanical part of the problem and there must be abundant exercise on 
this side. Then there is the equally important side of the reason- 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
ARITHMETIC—GRAMMAR GRADES 315 
ing, explaining why the mechanical work is performed as it is, why 
we multiply instead of divide, and how we know that the result is 
‘hours’ instead of ‘degrees,’ or ‘cents’ instead of ‘yards of cloth.’ 
Here the step form of analysis may be depended upon to show the 
pupil’s line of reasoning. These two lines of written work are, 
therefore, legitimate. What, then, is illegitimate in written work, 
and what are the dangers to be guarded against in that which we 
do adopt? As to the first, it may be laid down as an axiomatic fact 
that a form that states or seems to state a falsehood is illegitimate. 
That is, 30°+15=2 hours, is a false statement; it is not even ex- 
cusable on the score of brevity, since 30 x'/15 hr. =2 hrs. is as brief, 
is true, and is as easily explained as any form. So 6x15=90c. is 
a false statement and should not be tolerated, although 6 x 15 = 90, 
or 6 x 15c. =90c. is legitimate.” 
XI. The algebraic side of arithmetic: 
The use olf letters to represent numbers is within reach of the 
child’s intelect at an early age and can be understood easily and 
naturally. 
The formal study of equations for their own sake, their trans- 
formations and solutions, falls within the provisions of algebra. In 
arithmetic, and at the age at which a child usually studies arithmetic, 
any formal study of the more difficult phases of equations would 
be premature but from the first the child is dealing with the equa- 
tion form; e. g., 6+?=9. In arithmetic the equation is always a 
tool, and the extent to which it can be profitably used is marked out 
by the prob’em of arithmetic itself. Its very simplest phases suffice 
to make it a remarkably useful tool in arithmetic. 
The use of letters to represent numbers opens the door for the 
application to literal numbers of all the fundamental operations of 
arithmetic, as well as of the combinations of these operations, of 
fractions, factoring, and the like. A certain degree of mechanical .. 
facility in the manipulation of literal expressions must be acquired’ 
by practice, and if the simpler forms and types only are taken up, 
the beginning of this practice may well be made in the eighth grade. 
Children enjoy this variety of calculation, but care must be taken 
to keep the problems simple. 
Negative numbers may well be deferred to a later stage. They 
are not needed for the work in arithmetic, and their introduction 
may mark, in a sense, the transition from literal arithmetic to alge- 
bra; from the work of the grades to that of secondary school. 
“There are two difficulties in the beginning of what is ordinarily - 
called algebra—the first, the use of letters to represent numbers; the
-P-A-G-E-326
316 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
second, the generalization of the number concept from absolute to 
relative numbers, positive and negative. These two points are 
quite independent, and there is no reason why the difficulties should 
not be separated. The first and easier presents itself naturally in 
connection with arithmetic, and leads to literal arithmetic, the let- 
ters representing absolute numbers. When this idea has become 
quite familiar by use, the extension of the number concept may be 
undertaken.” 
XII. Home study assignments: 
The best home study assignments in mathematics that can be 
given is to have the pupils collect data on some given topic: e. g., 
grocery store prices; prices of cotton goods; measuring and record- 
ing diameters and circumferences of round objects; estimating 
areas of neighborhood lots. 
The home assignment, so commonly given, of having children 
work out a number of, say, ten, examples to be brought in the next 
day tends to establish habits of carelessness and dishonesty in the 
pupils who either too frequently neglect to do the work, or often- 
times have it done for them by a classmate, a brother or sister, ‘or 
a parent. 
XIII. Present tendencies in arithmetic (From Brown and 
Coffman, pp. 349-366): 
1. “To utilize the pupil’s experiences thereby appealing to his 
interests. : 
2. “Social efficiency means other than mere business efficiency. 
The pupil has the right to be informed in regard to the broader 
aspects of modern, social, industrial, and commercial activities. 
3. ‘‘An attempt to adapt the problem material to the needs and 
interests of the pupil, instead of adapting the pupil to the problem. 
Pupils should be encouraged to bring in problems that appeal to 
them as interesting. 
» 4, “Skill—accuracy and rapidity in computation. 
5. “Oral arithmetic. 
6. “In the analysis of problems the pupil is encouraged to choose 
the method that seems best to him, and then he is asked to justify 
his choice. 
7. “Rationalizing the problem. 
8. “Unity of arithmetic. This refers to underlying principles 
rather than to mastery oftrules and definitions. The pupil who does 
not see the unity in arithmetic fancies that he is dealing with some- 
thing entirely new from the mathematical point of view every time 
he takes up a new topic, whereas he may be dealing with a new 
’ phase of a topic long familiar to him.”

FIFTH GRADE 
(a) Read “Suggestions for Teaching Arithmetic: Grammar 
Grades,”’ pp. 308-317, carefully many times during the year. 
(b) Arithmetic has an arithmetical language. Children should be 
taught to use it when arithmetical topics are discussed. 
(c) In this grade there should be a thorough review of the funda- 
mental processes with integers. Then should follow a thorough pre- 
sentation of the fundamental operations with fractions both common 
and decimal; these with the business denominate numbers con- 
stitute the main work for the year. Percentage, as such, is not a 
serious consideration in this grade; the only phases of it that are 
taken up at all are the common fractional and per cent. equivalents 
used interchangeably in simple problems, mainly oral; e. g., Find 
25 per cent. of $16. 
(d) Please remember that the entering fifth grade child in Septem- 
ber is only of fourth grade ability. He has forgotten much during 
the summer vacation. Expect of him, then, what the fourth grade 
teacher expected of him in June and gradually introduce him to the 
more difficult fifth grade work. 
(©) “Remember it is with or against habits already formed that 
new habits are to be formed. Three or four thousand times when 
asked to divide, the child gets an answer smaller than the dividend; 
division of fractions upsets this, and changes the habit. Teachers 
do not notice this danger point as they should” (Thorndike). 
(f) Keep the fractions rational; use only such fractions as con- 
form to business uses. Remember that Hochschild, Kohn and Co. 
(see “Suggestions for Teaching Arithmetic: Grammar Grades” p. 
312) when writing to one of our County boys said: 
“The usual fractions, or parts of things, which we sell are parts of pounds, parts of 
yards, and parts of dozens; we sell 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 3/4 of a pound of candy; 1/2, 
1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8 of a yard of cloth or ribbon; 1/12, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 
1/4, 3/4, 1/6, 5/6, 5/12, and 11/12, of a dozen buttons, or of a dozen cups or saucers, 
etc. 
“These are the fractions which are used most often, though sometimes a customer 
may ask for exactly 7 inches of lace or 19 inches of ribbon. Can you tell what frac- 
tion of a yard you would sell her in such a case? Can you tell why we do not sell 
2/8, 2/4, 3/12, 4/8, and 10/12 of anything?”

SuBJECT MATTER 
N. B.—The subject matter is here arranged topically for the teacher’s convenience. 
It would be a great mistake indeed to follow this order in the daily lesson plan. 
Life does not deal for two months with whole numbers only, then for another two 
months with fractions. and so on; but it uses the mathematical knowledge that fits 
a situation. Teach arithmetic therefore rationally. 
1. Integers and their processes: 
(1) Addition. 
(2) Subtraction. 
(3) Multiplication. 
(4) Division 
Work for accuracy and rapidity. Use simple checks. 
Acquiring skill in the fundamental processes means— 
Accuracy and speed: Do not sacrifice accuracy for speed. Standardize the work 
by using the Courtis’ Research Tests three times during the year (September, Jan- 
uary, June), and make a graph showing the comparative ratings of your class in the 
three testings. Follow up the results of each test with practice work for the pupils 
who are below the standard in the fundamentals, and also in reasoning. Dr. Courtis 
has published sets of practice tests. a supply of which can be bought for $1.50 per 
class; they are published by the World Book Company, Yonkers, N. Y. Ginn and 
Company has a set of tests known as Minimum Essential tests; they are not so scien- 
tific as the Courtis tests, and are not standardized for either comparative class rat- 
ings or for time. Prof. Clifford Stone, of the Ohio State Normal School has published 
tests in both fundamentals and reasoning: (see Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity Publications.) There are also the Studebaker Tests published by Scott, 
Foresman and Co. 
2. Fractions. (The special work of the year.) 
a. Common fractions: 
Addition and subtraction of fractions involve the following, which must be 
studied before the advanced fundamental processes can be understood :— 
(1) Factors; multiples; cancellation; tests for divisibility; greatest common 
divisor, and least common multiple by factoring and inspection only: 
(2) Addition of fractions. 
(8) Subtraction of fractions. 
GEN (4) Multiplication of a fraction by an integer. 
| (5) Multiplication of a fraction by a fraction. 
(6) Multiplication of a mixed number by a mixed number (use ‘“‘of” and 
“x” interchangeably). 
(7) Division of a fraction by an integer. 
(8) Division of a fraction by.a fraction. 
b. Decimal fractions: as 
(1) Notation: Not more than six orders. (Base on notation of integers.) 
(2) Decimal counting. 
Decimal counting is a means to overcoming the common etrors in decimal 
notation. The common errors are: 
(a) To say hundredths and write tenths. 
(b) To say tenths and write hundredths. 
(c) To say thousandths and write hundredths, or ten thousandths. 
(d) To misplace the decimal mark when a whole number and a decimal 
are involved.

His error is noted, and he is made to write the y15-as a common 
fraction 15/10; to reduce it to a mixed number—1-5/10; to then write 
the mixed number as a decimal 1.5. 
Drilt should then be given on writing such numbers as 15 
tenths, 25 tenths, 29 tenths, etc. 
The exercise may then continue:

“In this year there should be a good deal Of oral work in the common per cents 
of business, pupils coming to feel that pencil and paper are unnecessary in finding 
12 1/2%, 25%, 33 113%, 50%, 66 2/3%, and 75% of ordinary numbers. As to 
the use of terms like ‘base,’ ‘rate,’ ‘percentage,’ ‘amount,’ and ‘difference,’ there is, 
as already stated, but little that can be said in their favor. They were invented 
in the rule stage of arithmetic, and have served their purpose. Of course, we need 
‘rate,’ it being a stock term of the business world. ‘Percentage’ is, however, rather 
confusing than otherwise, (1) because it is understood by the pupils as the name of 
the subject as a whole, and (2) because the business world does not use it quite as 
the school does. ‘Base’ means so many things in mathematics that its use is equally 
confusing, while in the case of ‘amount’ and ‘difference’ this disadvantage is still 
more noticeable. On the whole, therefore, it is as well not to use these terms, al- 
although they are found in most of our leading books today because of the demands 
of teachers. 
“Tt should also be remarkedythat if the use of ‘X’ is allowed, there is no 
excuse for the old formulas of percentage. They are nothing but condensed rules; 
if they are not explained, they defeat part of the purpose of studying arithmetic; 
if they are explained, they are much harder than the equation with the single letter 
x? 99 66 ‘multiples,” 
“Tt is well to bear constantly in mind, in the midst of the large number of 
_ possible cases of percentage, that the two important things in the subject are these: 
(1) to find some per cent of a given number; and (2) to find what per cent one num- 
ber is of another. All the rest is relatively unimportant, and on these two the em- 
phasis should accordingly be laid.” (D. E. Smith: The Teaching of Arithmetic,

does not use it quite as the school does. ‘Base,’ means so many things in mathe- 
matics that its use is equally confusing, while in the case of ‘amount ’ and ‘differ-__ 
ence’ this disadvantage is still more noticeable. On the whole, therefore, it EA! 
as well not to use these terms, although they are found-in most of our leading 
books today because of the demands of teachers. It should also be remarked 
that if the use of X is allowed, there is no excuse for the old formulas of percent- 
age. They are nothing but condensed rules; if they are not explained, they defeat 
part of the purpose of studying arithmetic; if they are explained, they are much 
hardef than the equation forrn with the single letter X. 
“It is well to bear constantly in mind, in the midst of the large eernee of Seale 
cases of percentage, that the two important things in the subject are these:— 
(1) to find some per cent of a given number; and (2) to find what per cent one 
number is of another. All the rest is relatively unimportant, and on these two 
the emphasis should accordingly be laid.” 
c. Fractions of 1%: 
In the percentage drills pay much attention to the fractions of 1%: 1/2%, 
14%, 118%, 110%, etc. ‘ 
d. Applications: 
(1) Profit and loss. : 
(2) Interest. 
(3) Commission. 
(4) Trade discount. 
(5) Taxes. 
(6) Insurance. * 
(7) Knowledge of percentage in school reports should be required. 
Note: It would be well for the teacher to visit the bank, the insurance office, 
the tax office, the custom house, etc., and see what real business transactions are. 
These forms of business might then be organized concretely in the schoolroom, 
and thus the operations of real life would be presented to the child. ‘ 
9, Interest (the principal application of percentage): 
a. Necessary language. 
b. Connection of percentage with interest for one year. 
c. Interest by the common method. 
d. Interest by the six per cent method. 
e. Interest by the aliquot part method. 
Note: Teach the “common method” and either the “six per cent” or the “aliquot 
part’ method.

business and of life is opening before them. It should therefore be 
the duty of the school, even more than in the preceding grades, to 
apply arithmetic to the genuine problems-of life, particularly with 
reference to the common occupations of the people.” Certainly 
every boy and girl at the end of the eighth grade should be familiar 
and should discuss with ease the number experiences involved in—

ditional mathematics covered in the household economics and manual 
training periods is added to the class teacher’s instruction.

HANDWRITING 
Primary Grades. All written work placed upon the blackboard 
should be as nearly perfect as possible, according to the system 
now in use. In the first three grades it is essential that the alphabet 
both capital and small, be placed upon the blackboard as a guide - 
and reference when in doubt. The blackboard work should present 
daily correct ideals of form, arrangement, and balance. All work 
which is hastily placed upon the blackboard for any purpose, should 
be immediately erased when the purpose is accomplished. Like- 
wise all imperfect work of pupils should be erased as soon as may be. 
Care should be taken in requiring children to read from the black- 
board only clear, legible script. Each teacher, therefore, needs to 
practice writing before her pupils. The only certain precaution is 
to rule the boards thus used, four to four and a half inches apart, 
both for the teacher’s and children’s use. 
In all written work expect the same degree of excellence of which 
the pupil shows himself master in the writing lesson, except where 
you designate you want speed regardless of form. This applies more 
particularly to grades beyond the second. Less written work, bet- 
ter ideals of excellence, to be attained by each grade, and use of 
the scale by which a pupil may measure his own progress will lighten 
our effort to secure the desired result. 
The handwriting scale should be placed upon the bulletin board 
or on the wall at a convenient height for the children’s use. The 
habit of testing writing results should be established by permitting 
and encouraging children to measure their writing at regular in- 
tervals. Measurements of handwriting should be made at least 
three times a year upon the work of a class, judgments being made 
by two or more teachers. In this way an idea of a standard for the 
individual and for the class is clearly defined and a greater uniform- 
ity of result can be attained. 
In the third and fourth years the habit of comparing written 
work with the writing-slip copy is essential to secure correct size, 
form, and slant. Without this daily reminder, by which to estab- 
lish the correct ideals, the writing is apt to become too small. 
Writing Position. Hygienic position, freedom of movement, 
and well-formed letters are the essentials in all work in writing. 
(330)
-P-A-G-E-341
HANDWRITING—PRIMARY GRADES 331 
Directions for writing position should be cheerfully and persist- 
ently given: (1) Feet flat; (2) Back straight; (8) Head up; (4) 
Both arms on desk; (5) Penholder pointing over shoulder; (6) Pen 
or pencil held lightly. 
Hygienic position is secured only by constant watchfulness during 
writing periods and the extension of these habits to study periods. 
Left-handed children need special attention, not so much to attempt 
to change to the use of the right hand as to correct any unhygienic 
position which may be assumed. Note the back and eyes in judg- 
ing positions. 
‘Freedom of movement is secured only by much practice at black- 
board and in large writing on paper, by which to gain habits of muscu- 
lar control. Large writing should be continued through the second 
year, and gradually work into the free use of the arm movement in 
forming the ordinary sized letters of the third and fourth grades. 
In the earlier grades the finger movement is necessary in getting 
the form of letters, but will yield to the free arm movement when 
this habit is acquired. 
Pen and ink will be introduced in the third year, and all copied . 
exercises should be done in ink. , 
Written exercises should not be used as a means of punishing a 
child for some offense other than carelessness in writing, and even 
when results are slovenly and poor, their cure is not effected by 
more writing, but by a change of attitude toward all work. Good, 
careful workmanship is found where the tone or atmosphere of the 
schoolroom emanates cheerfulness and earnest endeavor. Various 
means are used to stimulate individual effort by which to secure 
uniformity of result. None is of greater value than teaching the 
child to respect his work and to take pride in its appearance. It 
is not enough to work for accuracy alone. To this should be added 
the element of beauty. Both teachers and children need the in- 
spiration of “making useful things beautiful.” Study the following 
suggestions and apply art principles to daily life. 
BEAUTY IN SCHOOL WoRK 
Beauty is to count, side by side with accuracy. 
I. Adaptation: - 
1. Paper suited to the record. gf work: 
a. Wide ruled paper for written work in first and second grades. 
b. Unruled for number, drawing, and cutting. 
c. Arithmetic, language, and drawing papers to vary in size 
according to type of lesson. 
2. Pencils of good length and well-pointed.

IT, Arrangement: 
Throughout there is a nice adjustment of part to part which pro- 
duces a beautiful whole. The thoughtful study of arrangement 
should begin in primary grades and continue until the habit of plac- 
ing any work with regard to its ultimate appearance is established. 
1. A sheet should have a proper margin. 
Use margin markers or other device. The margin at right and 
left insisted upon in third and fourth grades, should be alike, margin 
at top and bottom about the same with the space at the top some- 
what wider. 
2. A sheet should have an orderly plan. 
The form depends somewhat upon the subject; but in general: 
a. Name and date at end of text, or 
b. Name after the title. 
3. A sheet should have balance: 
a. Placing of title, name, and date. 
b. Arrangement of content. 
Illustrations showing arrangement and balance:

c. Placing of illustrations: pictures of sketches made by the 
children. 
d. Spacing, as in arithmetic. 
e. Work checked by teacher by the proper placing of the 
“medal of honor;” opportunity to exercise judgment upon the 
good and poor work of the class, by having models properly 
mounted and placed before them which emphasize both accuracy 
and beauty in school work. 
Adapted from: School Sanitation and Decoration, Bailey and 
Burrage. 
FIRST GRADE 
Writing is begun in the first grade but the first exercises may be 
termed preparatory to the specific drill work, which may be well post- 
poned until children have been in school ten or twelve weeks. Much 
blackboard work will insure the use of the whole arm movement. 
Written work on paper when given should be large and done at 
first with large pencils or crayola. All written work is directed as 
it is important that correct habits and ideas of form should be de- 
veloped from the beginning. An average of ten minutes daily 
devoted to writing with specific attention to correctness of form is 
sufficient. Near the end of the year the First Grade Handwriting 
Scale is used to measure each child’s work, and this record is kept 
as a basis for measurement of future growth. All work should be 
done from a large copy placed upon the blackboard, and the writ- 
ing slips should not be placed in the children’s hands earlier than the 
second half year. Hygienic position, freedom of movement, and 
well formed letters are the essentials in all work of writing. These 
can be secured in first grade by direct supervision. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. 
The following steps are suggested: 
I. Devices other than writing to fix forms and secure drills: 
1. Trace with seeds or shoepegs letters and words written large 
on desk or paper. 
2. Making words with seeds from blackboard copy. 
8. Drawing of objects at blackboard which call for the use of free 
stroke, as bird’s nest, a poplar tree, a hoop, rounded hills. Many 
exercises are suggested by other school activities. 
4. Use script words in making sentences. 
5. Use letter cards to make words. 
IT. The Writing Lesson: 
1. Arranging following the teacher’s large script. The written 
work should be clear, distinct, large and perfect in form.
-P-A-G-E-344
    
334 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
2. Imitation of teacher’s copy in large and rapid movement at 
blackboard, or with soft pencil on large sheet of paper at desk, this 
last only when there is not available board space. 
3. First writing, free and untrammeled by lines; later, when some 
muscular control has been gained, writing on lined paper, one-inch 
space. Observe that capital and loop letters are made one inch, 
and the one space letters a little less than one-half inch. 
4. Drill upon troublesome letters or combinations, as oy, ad, bo. 
Drill upon making figures. 
5. By end of the year the children should have gained mastery of 
the relative proportion of capital, loop, and one-space letters. 
6. Do not put the copies into the hands of the children earlier 
than the second half year, but follow closely the form given. Always 
place the copy on the blackboard in large script. The alphabet in 
script should be upon all boards not later than October first. 
SECOND GRADE 
During the first year a fair degree of muscular control has been 
gained and now effort is made to secure legibility and some degree 
of rapidity. The writing is still large and all written work on paper 
is done on the one inch space ruled paper to insure habits of muscu- 
lar control. An average of ten minutes daily is sufficient time to 
devote to formal writing lessons, but as much of the other written 
work as possible should be done at the blackboard under direct 
supervision of teacher. Application of the Second Grade Hand- 
writing Scale should be made three times during the year to assure 
standards and measure progress. Writing slips may be placed in 
the hands of the children, but this does not exclude the large copy 
on the blackboard for discussion and study. Large script should 
be insisted upon, throughout the year. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. 
I. The Writing Lesson 
Observe the following suggestions: 
1. Desks clear; paper placed at a slight angle in the middle of 
the desk; pencils sufficiently long and well pointed. 
2. Secure hygienic position; feet flat, back straight, head up, 
both arms on desk, pencil pointing over shoulder, pencil held loosely 
between fingers. 
3. Get clearly in the child’s mind what is to be done. Do not 
allow him to write until this is definitely in mind. Make certain 
that the image of the letter form is clear and distinct. Use devices 
to stimulate interest in the characteristics of a letter form; the 
story, the use of colored chalk, air writing, tracing.
-P-A-G-E-345
  
HANDWRITING—THIRD GRADE 335 
4. As children write, pick out the general errors and correct at 
least one during the lesson. Continue in the next lesson until mas- 
tered. 
5. Remember that good writing is dependent upon good seeing, 
then establish good habits by drill. 
6. Write less and fix what you write; teach and clinch a few facts 
in each lesson. 
7. The blackboard, ruling four to four and a half inches apart, 
is the best possible means for all written work in this grade. 
THIRD GRADE 
During the first and second years much attention has been given 
to establishing habits of muscular control through blackboard work 
and large, round, legible script on paper. Some children gain this 
control much earlier than others. Some children in the third grade 
should continue the use of the large writing, but the tendency is to 
reduce the size of the letters more nearly conforming with the copy 
placed in the children’s hands. Daily comparison with the writing 
slip copy should be insisted upon to establish the ideal of correct 
size. Attention should now be given to arm movement, gradually 
leading the children to drop the finger movement which will disap- 
pear only when the arm movement is firmly established as a habit. 
Legibility, uniformity, and a fair degree of speed should be secured 
in this grade. The one-half inch ruled paper should be adopted 
for all practice work and for all permanent records. Pen and ink 
may be introduced the second half year. Application of the Third 
Grade Handwriting Scale should be made three times during the 
year as a means by which the pupil may recognize the stage of his 
own progress and to assure the attainment of a third grade standard 
by the members of thé class. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. 
I. The Writing Lesson: 
Observe the following points: 
1. Establish a certain routine, reducing waste in time and energy. 
a. Clear the desks; paper at slight slant; pencils of sufficient 
length and well-pointed; or, if pen and ink, inkwells in good con- 
dition. 
b. Distribution and collection of writing slips without friction 
or waste of time.  
-P-A-G-E-346
336 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
2. Get clearly in the child’s mind what is to be done. Do not 
allow him to use materials until this is definitely gained through 
observation, discussion, and further demonstration. _ Make certain 
that the photograph of the letter form is correct. Use devices to 
stimulate attention, to secure interest in detail upon the chief and 
distinguishing features of the letter. 
3. After work is begun, note the most common errors and spend 
time in correcting the wrong impression and inhibit the wrong habit 
by practice. Give some individual help, but teach the class. Train 
the children to criticise their own work by closely comparing with the 
copy. Insist that the copy shall cover all previous written work, 
so that only the perfect form is seen. 
5. See that each child’s writing is uniform in height, slant, and 
openness of letters. Accept no written work which does not ex- 
emplify the best writing of which the child is capable. All permanent 
records show the same degree of excellence as the written exercise. 
6. Remember that good doing is based upon good seeing. Ideals 
of good writing should be constantly shown in the blackboard work 
of teacher. Work done by pupils or hurried work done by teacher 
should be erased as soon as possible after it has served its purpose. 
Accurate, uniform, clear and distinct writing can be secured by pre- 
senting the constant ideals and establishing the habit through prac- 
tice. 
7. Arouse your children by movement exercises, and large free 
drill movement; by tests of uniformity, of form, of speed, and com- 
parison of work with classes. 
FOURTH GRADE 
The work of the third grade aimed to secure legibility, and a fair 
degree of uniformity in slant, size, and letter form. Some attention 
was given to arm movement, but the idea was gained, not the habit. 
The work of this year is to stress arm movement and fix the habit 
through practice, and by this means to secure some advancement in 
skill. A fair degree of speed will be attained. Pen and ink should 
be used in all drill exercises, and in all copied work. Where pupils 
show facility and ease its use may be extended to some first draft 
work. Application of the Fourth Grade Handwriting Scale or the 
Thorndike Scale should be made three or four times a year, permit- 
ting pupils to measure their own progress, and to maintain the stand- 
ard for fourth grade. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week.

  HANDWRITING—GRAMMAR GRADES 337 
I. The Writing Lesson 
Observe the following: 
1. Establish a certain routine, reducing waste in time and energy: 
a. Clear desks, paper placed at slight slant, pens and inkwells 
in good condition. 
b. Distribution and collection of writing slips, of paper with- 
out friction and waste of time. 
2. Teach the writing lesson. Do not permit the pupil to touch 
materials until the pupil has clearly in mind what is to be done. Use 
devices to stimulate attention. Observe, discuss, demonstrate. 
3. After writing has begun, note the most common errors. Take 
one of these, and present for drill. Continue with variations until 
mastered through practice. 
4, Secure uniformity, in height, slant, size, and openness of let- 
ters by insisting upon each. Accept no written work which does 
not exemplify the standard which the pupil can attain. Accurate 
and neat uniform work is secured only by attention on part of both 
teacher and pupil. 
5. The writing of teachers upon ‘blackboard should be large, well 
spaced, and exactly according to the present system, to establish an 
ideal. Hastily written work by teacher or work done by pupils 
should be erased as quickly as possible after it has served its purpose. 
6. Remember: 
a. Hygienic position: feet flat, back straight, head up, both 
arms on desk, pen holder pointing over shoulder. 
b. Stimulate arm movement by exercises. Extend to written 
work. 
c. Teach, then drill. See, then do. 
HANDWRITING FOR GRAMMAR GRADES 
I. What is handwriting ability? 
It combines-the units: 
. Style. 
. Beauty. 
. Legibility. 
. Evenness. 
Ease. 
. Character. 
. Speed. 
II. Problem of handwriting in the grades. 
It is not a problem at all in grades I, II, and III, as it is later in 
grades IV-VIII. In grades I-III the handwriting is “written 
spelling” and the skill side of it shoulb not enter. ‘‘With children

of six to seven years a pressure maximum is never found in the word, 
but each single letter, and at the outset each single stroke is written 
with equal pressure.”—Rusk. 
“Older children and adults make the first part heavy and run off 
at the last. As ‘eyefuls in reading’ so a person writes by ‘handfuls 
in writing’ and this totality of impulse is gotten by speed which 
comes in grades VI-VIII.”—Thorndike. 
ITI. Legibility. 
Legibility in writing depends upon: 
1. Correct spacing. 
2. Correct letter forms. 
3. Evenness of letter forms. 
Spacing is the main factor that determines legibility; evenness 
closely correlates with this but is not co-ordinate in importance with 
spacing and its importance is usually exaggerated while spacing has 
been underestimated. “It should be a habit to keep words four 
millimeters apart, letters one and a half millimeters apart, and lines 
seventeen millimeters apart.” 
4. Form of letters has a value for economy in education that is 
more important even than spacing or evenness. 
IV. Individuality in writing: 
“Position of writing-copy, body and fingers should be taught, given a fair trial, 
then [within limits] the child may violate them if he feels like it.”—Thorndike. 
“The handwriting of the child depends more on the copy than does that of the 
adult, but teachers, especially of the highest class, can readily recognize the writing 
of individual pupils.”—Rusk. 
“Children are found to differ widely (according to Ufer) in handwriting, under 
ten heads: 
1. Unnecessary additions, for example, flourishes at the feeue and end of 
the word. 
2. Angles in place of curves and vice versa. 
3. Differences in slope. 
4, Connection of letters one with another—with young children a complete sep- 
aration between letters does not appear to exist. 
5. Spacing of writing characters. 
6. Distance between single words. 
7. Absolute size of single letters. 
8. Relative sizes of letters and parts of letters. 
9. Observance of lines. 
10. Form and position of the auxiliary signs like the dot on the “i.” 
The writing of adults discloses typical sex differences: 
Originality is held to characterize a man’s hand, conventionality a woman’s. 
Consequently masculine hand-writing is thought to show a more extensive range of 
variability than feminine. The typical feminine hand appears to be colorless, 
conventional, and usually small. The typical man’s hand is bold, or careless, or 
experienced, and above all, individual. . e

HANDWRITING—GRAMMAR GRADES 339 
Experiments or unconscious imitation in handwriting demonstrate a greater 
imitative tendency among women than among men. The masculine type writes 
with more pressure than the feminine, somewhat more slowly, and more completely 
in total impulses. The pressure is rhythmically distributed over the word so that 
generally the highest or maximum pressure lies at a definite point in each word. 
Some individuals place this maximum at the beginning, others at the end of the word. 
It is a special characteristic of the masculine type that the pressure increases with 
the speed. The feminine type, to which, however, the writing of some men con 
forms, writes more quickly than the masculine, but with less pressure and not in 
such uniform total impulses. The pressure curve has in most cases several maxima, 
and it is characteristic of this type that with increased speed pressure decreases.”” 
—Rusk. 
V. Movements in writing: 
“The movements made in writing include 
1. “Those of the fingers in forming letters. 
2. “Of the arm across the page. 
3. “Of the movement of pronation, that is the rotation of the hand 
so that it may rest flat on the palm. 
s . . . The full arm movement with the elbow rest- 
ing on the desk is much more rapid than the finger and wrist move- 
ment. The latter permits of round forms and therefore a more 
legible hand; it is much slower than the full arm movement, re- 
quiring at least 16 per cent more time than the latter so that the 
loss of speed doubtless neutralizes any gain in legibility. Exper- 
ience shows that neither movement should be used exclusively; the 
freedom of the forearm, united with the more delicate touch and 
shaping power of the fingers, enables the pupil to write easily and 
rapidly with a minimum of fatigue.”—Rusk. 
VI. Technique. 
“The unit of writing performance would better be the word though 
the stress may need to be upon height, or form, or just one letter. 
It should begin with the word and continue with it.”—Thorndike. 
VII. Correlation between an individual's general intellectual ability 
and the same individual’s ability in handwriting. 
Thorndike found that evidence of “ability in thought and ability 
in movement are in adults only very slightly related. The correla- 
tion between scholarship grade and quality of handwriting is zero.” 
VIII. Speed and quality. 
“Rapidity is in and of itself a good sign. If we know nothing 
about one score or so of pupils save that they are rapid writers and 
nothing about another score save that they are slow writers, we can 
prophesy that at the same rate the former group will on the average 
do writing of a higher quality.”—Thorndike.

IX. Time-cost: 
Frank N. Freeman, in the Fourteenth Yearbook of the National 
Society for the Study of Education, Part I, in his report on hand- 
writing [p. 77] says: 
“The standard [quality for writing in grades 5-8] can be attained 
‘with an expenditure of time of not over seventy-five minutes per 
week. The writer is convinced on the basis also of some of the data 
that it could be attained generally, as it is in some cases, by the 
expenditure of a much shorter amount of time. When the most 
efficient methods are employed it will probably be found that the 
expenditure of from ten to fifteen minutes in the intermediate 
grades [4-6] suffices to fix the handwriting habit in its main outline; 
and that the expenditure of a small amount of time in the upper 
grades [7-8] will maintain the efficiency of the habit and increase 
it by the amount of progress which is represented in the standard.” 
Freeman gives the following standard for speed per minute by 
grades: 
SPEED STANDARD 
  
erat II Ill IV Vv VI VII VIII 
  
Letters per minute. 36 48 56 65 72 80 90 
Thorndike goes even further than this and says: ‘One is tempted 
to advocate the heresy that children are taught to write too well. 
I personally do advocate it. If school boards would furnish, for the 
use of children electing writing as a study in the last two grammar 
grades, typewriting machines, I should certainly advise the transfer 
to typewriting of a child in those grades whose writing at sixty 
letters a minute consistently reaches 13 [see the Thorndike Scale]. 
For the amount of practice required to advance such a pupil to 
quality 16 [see the Thorndike Scale] at a rate of 75 letters a minute 
would much more than suffice to advance him to errorless machine 
writing at that rate. The value now attached to the high qualities 
of handwriting is, of course, largely fictitious. Employers who 
can afford such high qualities of writing, buy machines, to produce 
them. For writing cash checks, simple book entries, labels, and 
the like, a good plain hand or our quality 12 [see the Thorndike 
Scale] is entirely adequate. 
“Tt seems likely also that handwriting has been, and is, a case of a 
common practical fallacy, which may be called ‘learning for learning’s 
sake.’ When certain facts or acts of skill are teachable, teachers 
tend to teach them regardless of any intelligible service performed by
-P-A-G-E-351
  HANDWRITING—GRAMMAR GRADES 341 
them other than the doubtful one of ‘disciplining’ the mind or hand 
or eye. Since, for instance, arithmetical methods of extracting 
cube root have been learned by teachers and can be taught to chil- 
dren, we teach them, regardless of the fact that no person in his 
senses would extract a cube root in that manner. Similarly it is 
doubtful if any intelligent person would [except to become a teacher 
of handwriting] pay the necessary time-cost to acquire the ability 
to write at 75 letters or over per minute at quality 17 or better. 
He would of course, learn to typewrite instead. And if an intelli- 
gent person has been artificially induced to get that ability in school, 
he promptly loses it thereafter.” 
X. Standardization: The recent movement in scientific testing of 
handwriting to determine its efficiency.

Education, Part I, Minimum Essentials in Elementary School Subjects—Standards 
and Current Practices. 
Some conclusions reached in these publications are as follows: 
1. The scale: 
Thorndike says: Handwriting may profitably be studied from three points of 
view: that of the physiology and psychology of movement, that of the part it may 
play in the intelligently directed activities of child life in schools, and that of the 
direct examination of the quality and speed of handwriting secured by various 
forms of school training. But to any study of it there is one very desirable pre- 
liminary—some means of measuring the quality of a sample of handwriting. 
At present we can do no better than estimate a handwriting as very bad, bad, 
good, very good, or extremely good, knowing only vaguely what we mean thereby, 
running the risk of shifting our standards with time, and only by chance meaning 
the same by a word as some other student of the facts means by it. We are in the 
condition in which students of temperature were before the discovery of the ther- 
“mometer or any other scale for measuring temperature beyond the very hot, hot, 
warm, lukewarm, and the like of subjective opinion. We opine roughly that, at 
a fairly rapid rate, writing movements in which the forearm shares will produce a 
better quality of handwriting than movements confined more exclusively to the thumb 
and fingers, but no one could estimate with surety and precision how much better 
the best rapid “free-arm” writing is than the best equally rapid “‘finger-movement” 
writing. We opine roughly that drills in which good writing serves some end of 
consequence to the children will be more efficient than drills for mere penmanship, 
but no one could estimate how much more efficient they will be We know that some 
schools secure better writing at a given speed than do other schools. but no one could 
tell how much better in any terms sure of understanding and agreement; for we have 
no scale to measure handwriting by. No pupil, teacher, or superintendent of 
schools knows how well any child, class, or group of children writes in anything ap- 
proaching the sense in which we know how hot any liquid is or how long a wire is, . 
It is possible, however, that some critics may deny the value of the average judg- 
ment of competent people in general and declare that though that judgment pro- 
nounces two handwritings equal in merit, he knows that that they are not equal.
-P-A-G-E-352
342 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE. COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Now inconceivably he might be right. But the chances are enormously against 
his being right, and science naturally cannot count his assurance as of more weight 
than that of any other judge of equal competence. 
Some more sophisticated critic may object, not that he knows that this scale is 
wrong and prefers his own supposed competence to that of forty of his peers, but 
that no one can know whether this or any such scale is right. For, he will add, 
any such scale is subjective, representing only what certain individuals think about 
the merit or value of samples of handwriting. In this there is some truth. There 
is no value in average opinion as such. The world was round, when the most com- 
petent judges thought it flat, as it is today. If it should some time be proved that 
evenness of width of line was the sole criterion of real merit in handwriting, the 
scale would be wrong. 
But in the case of handwriting the only available criterion of real merit or quality 
or goodness is the average judgment of competent people. A hundred years from 
now merit in handwriting may mean something different from what it now means 
and a new scale may be required. But what it then means will then be determined 
by the average judgment of competent men and shown in a scale derived just as 
this one has been derived. 
Another criticism may be that the scale does not guarantee agreement among 
the observers using it to measure a sample of handwriting. The same sample, may, 
it will be said, be measured by one person as equal in merit to 8, by another as 
equal to 10, and by still another as equal to9. This is true, but it is not the fault 
of the scale. Observers will disagree in their measurements made with the scale, 
but not nearly so much as in measurements made without it. No scale guarantees 
absolute agreement. Observers measuring the length of this line —-————— to 
tenths of a millimeter will not agree. But they will agree better than they would 
if they had no scale and judged its length as a savage might. 
| 2. The use of the scale: 
| } “The topic of this section is fitly treated in the one statement: Any measure- 
ment of the quality of handwriting may be made more accurately and conveniently 
with the scale, either actually present or held in memory, than without it. The 
reader may apply this statement to whatever cases his interests suggest. I shall 
mention a few of the commoner uses and explain the function of the scale as a stand- 
ard held in memory. 
The classroom teacher has to measure the quality of a single pupil’s handwriting 
in order to assign him a rating in comparison with his fellows and, better still, in 
comparison with his own past performances. If she uses the scale either by giving 
its numerical measurements outright or by letting her “A,” “B,” “C’s,” or “75,” 
80,” “82,” etc., per cents, or excellents, goods, fairs, etc., mean certain points on 
the scale, her ratings will have a definite meaning to the pupil, can have the same 
meanings that similar ratings by other teachers in the school have, and may be used 
to measure the actual improvement of the pupil month by month and year by year. 
She can more easily and more accurately measure the relative values of the different 
methods of teaching which she may from time to time employ, of different lengths 
of periods for drill, and the like. 
A principal or supervisor or superintendent of schools needs to measure the quality 
of the handwriting of individuals, of classes, and of all classes of the same grade, 
jn a school or system. If he has such measures honestly made by the scale, he can 
compare the work of one teacher with that of another, the work within his own school 
with that of other schools or cities and with that of his own city five years later, 
the work of schools using one system of writing with that of schools using other 
systems, and the like.
-P-A-G-E-353
  HANDWRITING—GRAMMAR GRADES 343 
If he tried without the scale to estimate the superiority or inferiority in handwrit- 
ing of twelve-year-olds in City A to twelve-year-olds in City B, he would have to 
collect many samples in both cities and have them graded alike. He could define 
the amount of difference found only by actually exhibiting it in samples or by making 
out a scale like ours, defining it as I have done, and expressing the difference as such 
a distance on the scale. With the scale in use in both cities, on the contrary, if 
marks are honestly given by the teachers, the superiority or inferiority of any group 
will be measured by the difference in the scale-values of the marks themselves. _ 
The scientific student of education will use the scale to measure the quality of 
samples of handwriting from individuals, classes, cities, groups chosen for grade, 
age, sex, method of teaching, or length of time devoted to writing. and from any 
other sources. He will also be able to use any marks or ratings honestly given by 
teachers or others. 
Whoever has any occasion to define a standard of quality in handwriting can define 
it. unmistakably and conveniently by the scale. Business men can decide. what 
quality they wish the schools to secure in the boy fourteen years old who is to apply 
for clerical positions. A supervisor can inform all the teachers of, say, grade 7 that 
the minimum requirement is, say, quality 11, at a rate of 50 letters per minute, 
that the average pupil must be made to write at quality 13 at a rate of 60 letters per 
minute, and so on. Whatever standard is set will be absolutely defined by those 
who set it and will be clear to all those who are to follow it. 
The pupil himself may profitably know and use the scale. He may see by it what 
is expected of him and may tell how nearly he reaches the standard and how much 
he has gained. : 
Even if precision is not desired in the estimate of the quality of handwriting— 
even if good and bad or satisfactory and unsatisfactory are the only ratings to be given 
—the scale is none the less useful. For if good and bad, or satisfactory and unsatis- 
factory are to mean anything, they must mean handwritings above and below some 
point on some scale of merit. They can be properly defined only by locating that 
point. And until some better scale is available that point can be located only by 
exhibiting samples or by stating the numerical value these samples would have on 
our scale. 
To put the whole matter in a word, any measurement of the quality of hand- 
writing should be made by the scale and reported in terms of the scale, for substan- 
tially the same reasons that any measurement of the length of an object should 
be made with a linear scale and reported in meters or feet. 
Measurements may be made by the scale without the comparison of the sample 
with the actual scale itself. Just as one uses his experience of feet and inches as 
a mental standard whereby he estimates more or less accurately the length of pencils, 
tables, windows, and the like, without an actual rule or tape, so one may come to 
estimate that this sample of writing is about quality 16, that one about quality 
9, and the like, from the mental standard left from examination and use of the actual 
scale. The scale should always be present for reference in any measurement which 
requires exactitude, but it will do its greatest amount of service, not by actually 
serving as a foot-rule for quality in handwriting, but by creating in the minds of 
teachers mental standards to be used in even the most casual ratings of everyday 
schoolroom life. To one who uses the scale, quality 18 or quality 15, or quality 
7 comes to be a definife agent in determining all judgments, just as 18 inches or 15 
pounds or 7 dollarsis. Just asa child learns to think about length correctly and with 
fair precision without a rule in his hand by having measured off lengths with it,
-P-A-G-E-354
344 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
so teachers may come to think about handwriting correctly and with fair precision 
without the scale before their eyes, by having measured handwritings with it. Just 
as the thermometer teaches us to supplant the vague ‘‘very cold,” “‘cold,” ‘‘moder- 
ate,” “warm,” “hot,” and “very hot,” by “about 0,” “about freezing,” “about 60 
degrees,” ‘“‘about 70 degrees,” “‘about 80 degrees,” ‘‘nearly 100,” and the like, so 
the graphometer can teach us to supplant the vague “illegible,” “very hard to read,”’ 
“a good plain hand,” and the like, by judgments which mean something definite 
and constant to those who make and those who hear them. 
In general the experience in constructing this scale gives great encouragement to 
the hope that for many educational facts, units and scales may be invented that 
shall enable us to think quantitatively in somewhat the same way that we can 
about facts in physics, chemistry, or economics. It has been commonly supposed 
that the great complexity of such facts as examination papers in spelling, mani- 
festations of interest in history, acts of moral significance, habits of industry, es- 
says, poems, inventions, replies to questions demanding logical inferences and other 
like results of education, prevents the samples composing any one such group from 
being measured by any one linear scale at all comparable to a foot rule or thermometer 
or galvanometer. 
3. Minimum essentials in handwriting: 
Freeman, in the Fourteenth Year Book, says: 
In the case of a subject like handwriting, the object of which is the development of 
skill, minimum essentials are to be considered, not as absolute requirements, but 
as dependent in a measure upon the time and effort which are required to attain them. 
It is germane to the subject, then, to consider both the amount of skill which it is 
desirable that a pupil shall attain from the point of view of the demands of society 
and of his later life, and also the time which is required in order to attain this skill. 
The subject, then, may be approached from either side. We may ask, on the one 
hand, what degree of excellence in writing the pupil should possess in order to be 
able to meet the demands which will be made upon him; or we may ask, on the 
other hand, what degree of skill is attainable under specified skill in the school. 
We shall attack the second phase of the problem first, and assume for the time 
being that a reasunable amount of skill is desirable and necessary for every elementary 
school pupil. 
The distribution in time which was spent upon handwriting in the cities which 
replied to this question is shown in Table II. It is seen from this table that there 
is a wide variation in this matter. Some cities spend no time in certain grades, 
or spend upon an average only about 45 minutes per week, while other cities spend 
nearly three times as much time as this. One city, in fact, spends upon the aver- 
age five times as much as do two other schools. 
In endeavoring to interpret these facts it is not necessary to assume that the amount 
of time spent has no effect upon the efficiency of handwriting teaching. It does 
appear to mean, however, that it is not desirable to spend more than ten or fifteen 
minutes a day when this time is spent all in one period. The data which are at 
hand do not give sufficient information upon which to base a conclusion as to the 
best amount of time to give. Suchaconclusion could best be based upon experiments 
in which different amounts of time were tried out with the same class or with the 
same school, and with other conditions remaining the same. The conclusion which 
can be drawn from the data, however, is that the superior attainment of the schools 
in the upper half of the whole group is not due to spending a greater amount of time 
in handwriting teaching.
-P-A-G-E-355
HANDWRITING—GRAMMAR GRADE 345 
If we compare curves for legibility and for speed, we see that the former advances 
steadily and at about an equal tate from the first grade.to the eighth; while the curve 
for_speed advances rapidly up to the fifth grade and then very slowly from the fifth 
grade to the eighth. The difference in speed of writing between the second grade 
and the fifth is 2934 letters per minute; while the upper grades on an average gain 
only 12 %/10 letters per minute above the fifth grade. This break in the rapidity of 
advance in speed furnishes a point of attack and raises the question whether it is 
necessary and desirable. 
If we ask ourselves the reason for this difference in the speed and legibility, part 
of the answer probably is to be gotten from the fact that legibility is more readily 
tested in the school and that more attention is paid to it than to speed. The per- 
manent result of the child’s writing is represented in the quality of the writing, 
while the rapidity with which he writes is not evident merely upon the inspection 
of the paper. The teacher will therefore more readily notice and will be more 
likely to criticize deficiency in legibility than deficiency in speed. 
While the diminution in the rate of increase from the fifth grade on is a natural 
one, and is to be explained by the lower rate of increase in motor ability at this time, 
yet the efficiency which has been attained in a number of schools shows that the drop 
is not necessary. Furthermore, the actual speed which is attained even in the upper 
half of the schools by the time of the eighth grade is lower than it should be. Less 
than 80 letters a minute is slow writing, and the standard which is laid down, of 
90 letters per minute, is well within the bounds of reason. 
The data which have been presented indicate that this standard can be attained 
with an expenditure of time of not over 75 minutes a week. The writer is convinced 
on the basis also of some of the data that it could be attained generally, as it is in 
some cases, by the expenditure of a much shorter amount of time. When the most 
efficient methods are employed it will probably be found that the expenditure of 
from ten to fifteen minutes in the intermediate grades suffices to fix the handwriting 
habit in its main outline; and that the expenditure of a small amount of time in 
the upper grades will maintain the efficiency of the habit and increaseit by the amount 
of progress which is represented in the standard.—Fourteenth Year Book, Part I. 
In Baltimore County we are planning to make a scale for hand- 
writing based upon the system now in use in our schools, which is 
that advocated and published by the Baltimore Business College.

Primary Grades. Health is the prime requisite for efficiency 
and any infringement of law serves to impress its truth all the more 
forcibly. The school recognizes the value and aims to provide 
means which will insure the normal development of body and mind. 
To attain these ends, however, the school and home should closely 
co-operate toward the maintenance of conditions favorable to growth. 
For this reason parents and teachers should be familiar with prac- 
tical hygiene, and games and plays which promote physical welfare. 
Whenever opportunity offers, informal health talks are given emphasiz- 
ing cleanliness of person, care of body, of our responsibility for order 
and beauty in our surroundings, and in simple ways, social welfare 
as affected by health. The most important of these conditions, 
within the reach of all, are an abundance of fresh air and sunshine, 
and a proper temperature, both conducive to a wholesome, sunny 
atmosphere in which human plants can best grow.: 
At school, the best place for physical exercises is the open air. 
The concrete walks can often be used to advantage. A part of the 
short recess periods should be frequently devoted to the learning of 
games under the direct supervision of the teacher, or of playing 
games learned in indoor play. Of necessity, some of the physical 
work must be done in the schoolroom.. Wide halls and playrooms 
are preferable to classrooms wherever available. Good ventilation 
is secured by lowering all windows a short distance from the top 
and raising them from the bottom at regular intervals during each 
session. The air needs to be changed every thirty minutes. The 
temperature should be about 65 degrees. At all times the lighting 
of the room should be carefully regulated, sufficient always to give 
a cheerful atmosphere and to avoid gray shadows. Children should 
be seated according to height, exceptions being made of those hav- 
ing defective sight and vision. Special care should be taken to 
provide pupils with desks of the right height; to place work upon 
boards in such position and clearness that no unnecessary eye strain 
results. Since habits of posture are established by daily practice 
it is of great importance that daily application be made of lessons 
in sitting, standing, walking, running, writing, reading, going up 
and down stairs until correct habits are attained. The correct use 
of the voice is also essential, corrective measures being given in

connection with music and reading, but it is necessary to warn against 
singing during strenuous physical exercise. Divide the class into 
an orchestra and players, the former providing the music while the 
latter participate in the game. 
Play. The work of whatever nature should be so planned that it 
will be interesting and recreative, for the value of an exercise de- 
pends very largely upon the amount of enjoyment it gives. The 
plan which follows is sufficiently varied to meet the needs of the grow- 
ing child and is the outgrowth of the play spirit inculcated by the 
teachings of Froebel who first recognized that play is an important 
factor in stimulating healthful, physical and intellectual growth. 
The right attitude toward play should be developed through fos- 
tering, directing and developing the right kind of games and plays 
adapted to each period of development. 
Imitative Plays. In the earlier years the characteristic tendencies 
of imagination, imitation and love of rhythm predominate in the 
spontaneous play of the child as a means by which to express him- 
self. Imaginative and imitative plays based upon daily familiar 
experiences, give oppportunity to lead children to graceful bodily 
expression and individual interpretation. Naturally there is a 
lack of definiteness in these games which are chiefly recreative. 
Rhythmic Games. The rhythmic work consisting of folk dances, 
interpretative work of social and nature plays, marching, and steps, 
aids and abets the imaginative and imitative work by establishing 
through practice, definite, recurring rhythms, as aids to acquiring 
ease, erectness, grace in carriage and freedom of movement. 
Playground Games. Indoor and outdoor games which test phys- 
ical skill, speed, endurance and control are needed as children grow 
older, and their interest changes. 
Simple apparatus for the playground consisting of swings, a bal- 
lancing log, see-saws, and a sandpile; balls, bean bags, beanbag 
board, ring toss, and other games which children are encouraged to 
_ bring from home for indoor games, are invaluable aids. 
Results. These are the means used to enhance physical develop- 
ment, presented in large measure through the medium of play 
which taken all together aim to give training in self control, self re- 
liance, leadership and sportsmanship. Play should be considered a 
part of the school work. 
Strict observance of the rules of the game, and above all “fair 
play”’ in spirit as well as in practice must at all times be insisted upon. 
Development of character is attained through expression in natural

activity rather than through precept. Respectful and courteous 
intermingling of boys and girls in games of common interest should 
be encouraged. 
The Play Festival. Play festivals in which classes of the same 
grade and of different grades in the same school and neighboring 
schools participate should be held annually as an incentive for daily 
practice and to encourage the play spirit in the community.

FIRST GRADE 
“Come, let us live with our children. Play is not trivial, it is 
highly serious and of deep significance. Cultivate and foster it. 
To the calm, keen vision of one who truly knows human nature, the 
spontaneous play of the child discloses the future inner life of the 
man.”’—Froebel. 
During the pleasant days of autumn and spring teachers should 
play with their children at recess as often as seems wise. Games 
taught indoors should be played out in the open air whenever op- 
portunity offers. Often a larger pupil may be encouraged to direct 
the games of a group of smaller children. 
A teacher should be entirely familiar with all the details of the 
game before attempting to teach it, thus avoiding waste of time, 
inattention, restlessness and often chaos. The game is to teach 
harmony, social adjustment, economy of effort, alertness, as well 
as bodily grace. 
Avoid unnecessary talking, use quiet tones, maintain a cheerful 
manner, secure a joyous response from the class, without that ner- 
vous reaction attendant upon hasty or ill advised commands. : 
Remember that the younger the children the greater the need for 
a change in activity. If for any reason, the game is a quiet one, or 
one in which only a few children take part, a quick march, a lively 
run, or a lively game of ‘Follow the Leader” should be given before 
resuming work. 
Keep the room well ventilated at all times, and flood with fresh 
air during the game period. 
Remember that children should be self-active. Allow them to 
help in the arrangement of the game, choice of players, and judge 
contests. 
Remember that they respond when interest is strongest. Foster 
the spirit of healthful play. Develop the right spirit in competition, 
a desire to work for their side and to accept defeat gracefully.
-P-A-G-E-359
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION—FIRST GRADE 349 
Remember that children work best when motive is well defined. 
Keep in mind a definite result toward which each game contributes 
its share. Play is educational when there is a clear understanding 
of its purpose, when alertness, attention, accuracy of motion are 
demanded; when fair play, exercising courtesy, is emphasized; 
when bodily control is secured by teaching economy of effort. 
Remember that games should be closely correlated with other 
phases of the work using them as but another medium of expression. 
For this reason the spirit of the game is introduced to advantage in 
the presentation of lessons, in rest periods for purposes of relaxa- 
tion, in sense games as a means to train the habits of observation as 
experiment, in rhythmic work to give delight in interpretation to 
music and in simple drills to establish correct habits of posture. 
The work is varied according to the needs of the children, each 
phase containing an element which makes an appeal to their in- 
terest. The following course is suggestive indicating the type of 
work and the amount which can be accomplished during the year. 
Suggestive detail may be found in Graded Games and Rhythmic 
Exercises by Newton, and in Education by Plays and Games by 
Johnson. Good folk dances with music may be found in Hofer’s 
Singing Games, and Burchenal’s Folk Dances. Story Gymnastics 
by Stoneroad gives excellent suggestions for imaginative plays 
based upon appropriate and seasonal experience. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day. 75 minutes per week. 
I. Posture Drills: 
1. Sitting. Secure good posture. Sit well back in seat, hands in 
lap, feet flat on floor. ; 
2. Standing. Secure good posture. Ease of movement in ris- 
ing. Stand clear of desk. Drill on quietness and ease of movement. 
3. Recitation, asin reading. Head up, chest out, good breathing, 
book held in left hand, right hand free, facing audience. 
4. Writing. Both arms on desk, paper on slight slant, loose grip 
of pencil. 
5. Breathing. Inhale, exhale with face toward window. 
6. Singing. Same as 1 except back is away from seat. 
7. Dismissal. Plan by which to save unnecessary waste of time, 
e. g. give commands: Rise, Stand, Pass. All pass in single file 
to cloak room without passing through other aisles. 
8. Give definite drills upon getting to and from blackboards, of 
forming a circle for a game, to secure ease, quietness, speed, etc.

  The directions Hee playing are given in detail in the books indicated 
and will not be presented here. Other games may be used instead 
of these if simple ones are selected. One game a month is adequate; 
not so many games, but the few well played, the aim. Teach the 
words carefully and in all running games insist upon the orchestra 
to accompany the players. Teach the game first as an indoor game; 
then apply to outdoor activity. 
III. Schoolroom Plays: 
1. Sense Games. 
a. Sight. Hide the Thimble. Graded Games, pp. 7, 51. 
Children lay their heads on their desks, or they may leave 
the room, while one hides the thimble or ball. 
Devise other games with nature objects, colored paper, cubes. 
Air drawing of surfaces, as square, circle. 
b. Sound. Blind Man’s Buff. Locate the person in center 
by the movement. Graded Games, p. 52. 
Devise exercises in speaking, in singing to train the ear. Send 
a child into the hall who may speak or sing. Let the class guess 
the singer. Place the singer behind the child who is blindfolded. 
c. Touch. Use fruits, flowers, leaves, nuts, objects. Place 
the object in the hands of the child who is blindfolded. Test 
his sense of form. 
d. Taste. Train children to recognize sweet, sour, bitter, 
pungent. 
e. Smell. Train children to recognize odors of a few flowers. 
2. Imaginative and imitative games, 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
PHYSICAL EDUCATION—FIRST GRADE 351 
a. Imitative activities suggested by the other lesson material, 
as gathering leaves, swaying trees, a butterfly flying, birds flying, 
soldier boy marching, horses stepping high, a rabbit leaping, 
squirrel running, and others. Work for accuracy in the interpre- 
tation which should be worked out by the children themselves, 
taking the best as the model for imitation. Make this work worth 
while. Keep in mind the definite purpose of poise and control, 
and aim to exercise arms, legs, body, head, and co-ordinate the 
breathing exercises with them. 
b. Follow the Leader. Graded Games, pp. 2, 17, 21. The 
children represent the activities of which they sing while marching 
or standing in the aisles. They sing to the tune of “Here We 
Go Round the Mulberry Bush,” as, “This is the way we all will 
walk, all will walk, .etc.” 
c. “Did You Ever See a Lassie?’ ‘When I was a Shoe- 
maker.” Graded Games, p. 3. The children stand in the aisles. 
One takes his place before the class, and at the proper time goes 
through the motion which the children imitate in rhythm of the 
song. 
d. The King of France. Soldier Boy. Graded Games, pp. 4, 
5, 6. Make paper caps for occasional use, as a bit of costuming 
adds interest. 
3. Games for general activity. 
a. I say “Stoop.” Graded Games, p. 34. The teacher says 
to the class “I say Stoop.” Both teacher and children stoop at 
the command. Repeat the command several times. The teacher 
says, “I say Stand,” and stoops. Any child moving on the word 
“stand” is caught and takes his place. Continue until several 
have been caught. 
b. Running. Graded Games, p. 15. All the children run to- 
’ gether, or only a few at atime. Run lightly around the room up 
and down the aisles, running on toes, lifting knees high. At each 
step use arms in various movements, e. g. [1] Run as if on soft 
grass, [2] Run as if through fallen leaves, [3] Still running in 
place without advancing. [4] Change time from slow to fast. 
[5] Imitate birds flying. 
c. Squirrel game. Graded Games, p. 7. Tests child’s alert- 
ness and control in running lightly about the circle or in and out 
among the desks. 
d. Jumping. Graded Games, pp. 16, 99. [1] Crossing the 
Brook. Imaginary stones on floor. Children step from stone to 
stone. [2] Jack Be Nimble. Place a candle—a box or cube— 3
-P-A-G-E-362
  Gaz COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
in front of alternating rows. The children in two rows form a 
company one facing the rear of the room. As each child comes 
forward he jumps and passes on following the children of the sec- 
ond row. Many other games are suggested in reference books 
and teacher and children can invent games which correlate with 
the daily work. 
IV. Rhythmic Exercises: 
1. Finger plays and song plays: Simple singing games repeated from the kinder- 
garten are suited to children of this grade. Among these, selections from the Finger 
Plays by Emilie Poulsson should be used freely at rest periods during the day. The 
following are suggested: “Merry Little Men,” “Squirrel,” ““The Beehive,” ‘‘The 
Corn,” “Mrs. Pussy,” “Making Butter,” “Santa Claus.” Also “The Pigeons,” 
“The Postman,” “The Birds’ Nest,” and others, found in Songs of the Child World 
by Riley and Gaynor, and the Bentley Primer. 
2. Folk dances, and traditional games: 
a. Farmer in the Dell. Graded Games, p. 9. 
b. Looby Loo. Graded Games, p. 10. 
Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. Graded Games, p. 21. 
See Saw, Marjorie Daw. See Directions for Playing. 
Hickory, Dickory, Dock. See Directions for Playing. 
Ride a Cock Horse. See Directions for Playing. 
Flower Ring. See Second Grade. 
Hickory, Dickory, Dock.—Dance 
“Hickory, dickory, dock; 
The mouse ran up the clock; 
The clock struck ‘One;’ 
The mouse ran down; 
Hickory, dickory, dock.” 
Children form a circle facing the center. They raise their arms upward to a 
vertical position on the words, “Hickory, Dickory, Dock,” sway from the waist 
toward right, then left, then right. Coming to erect position they tuck the backs 
of fingers against waist. 
When singing the second line the children take three creeping steps forward to 
center of circle, then stand still and listen while singing ‘The clock struck One,’ 
clapping hands on the word “‘One.”” 
While singing the fourth line, take short running steps backward, with fingers 
tucked in at waist. While singing the last line repeat swaying movement with 
arms vertical. 
Clasping hands take three steps toward the right and on the fourth count un- 
clasp hands, turn to outside, reclasp hands and continue walking without breaking 
rhythm. Repeat, turning in or out to end of music. 
SEE Saw, Marjory Daw 
Partners form a double circle facing each other. Take hands and place right 
foot forward. mmo ao 
“See Saw, Marjory Daw, 
Johnny shall have a new master, 
He shall have but a penny a day 
Because he can’t work any faster.”
-P-A-G-E-363
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION—FIRST GRADE 353 
While singing the first two lines, sway in toward the middle of the circle so that 
one partner sways backward, bending left knee, and other partner sways forward, 
bending right knee. Then sway away from the center of the circle, each partner 
bending the opposite knee. Continue the movement eight times. 
While singing ‘He shall have” all step to the right, crossing the left toe in front 
and shaking the left forefinger. Repeat in opposite direction while singing “but 
a penny a day.” 
While singing the last line partners join hands and swing each other in a circle 
with four skipping steps. 
RIDE A Cock HorsE 
Partners form a single circle facing in line of direction. The one in back places 
hands on partner’s shoulders; the one in front places hands on hips. 
“Ride a Cock Horse 
To Banbury Cross. 
To see an old lady 
Ride on a white horse; 
With rings on her fingers, 
And bells on her toes, 
She shall have music 
Wherever she goes.” 
While singing the first four lines all gallop eight steps around circle by placing 
the right foot forward and bringing the left foot up to the right with a hop. 
Immediately face center of circle and extend arms vertically upward. Jump up 
lightly on the toes on the words “rings” and “‘fingers” and at the same time shake 
fingers. : 
Quickly place backs of hands on hips. While singing the word “bells,” hop on 
the left foot and touch right toe in front, then on the word “toes,” hop replacing 
right foot and touching left toe in front. 
Take four skipping steps, swinging partner and coming back to place, while sing- 
ing the last two lines. 
3. Marching. Arrange children according to height. Keeping time in place. 
Accenting the time. Single file around room; marking time; halting. Change 
from slow to fast time, and observe that each child keeps step. Measure distance. 
March forward and backward in aisles, as in “King of France.” Play “Soldier Boy.” 
“Ten Little Indians.” Graded Games, pp. 4, 5, 6. 
4. Steps. Skipping. Use the “Skipping Game.” 
V. Health Lessons: 
Cleanliness. Emphasize the necessity for clean hands and face, and for wash- 
ing the mouth after mealtime. 
Talk with children in most informal fashion. Opportunities will be found in the 
daily inspection of hands, face, after playtime, and in the study of the social and 
industrial life such questions as the following will arise: 
1. How mother gets children ready for school; bathing, dressing, care of ears, of 
hands, etc. What the children do for themselves, washing face and hands, caring 
for teeth, etc. 
2. Why mother works so hard to keep our clothing clean and fresh. How little 
children can help. 
3 Why mother airs the rooms; by opening windows; airing bedding, etc. 
Fresh air in the school room. 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
354 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
4, How to keep our desks and floor space clean: Why use door mat to keep street 
dust from our rooms? 
5. What to do with our handkerchiefs. 
6. Why fruit should be washed before eating. Gentle and careful manners in 
eating. Dangers of the common drinking cup. Teach the making of the simple 
paper cup. 
Through mothers’ meetings, where it is necessary, the mothers should be inter- 
ested in the necessity for keeping the children’s bodies and teeth clean, and in giving 
them simple and wholesome food, plenty of sleep, and opportunity for fresh air and 
sunshine. 
SECOND GRADE 
The work of the second year does not differ materially from the 
first since the children have still the same interests, but the increased 
mental grasp, and co-ordination of muscles securing better self- 
control gives opportunity now to perfect the former results. The 
games, rhythmic exercises, drills, of the first year may be repeated 
as requests are made by children, and new games added for variety 
and interest. Much attention should be devoted to the formation 
of correct habits of sitting, standing, walking, talking, using at- 
tractive means to attain alertness, poise, and self-control. In 
singing games, words should be carefully taught, enunciation as 
well as tone kept clear and sweet. The class should be divided into 
the orchestra and the players. When the physical exercise is stren- 
uous, as in running, or marching, emphasis should be placed upon 
accuracy of movement, readiness of response to commands, and 
joyous interpretation. A teacher needstobecheerful in her presenta- 
tion, and exercises used throughout the day to interpret other school 
activities afford opportunity for rest and relaxation, and at the 
same time promote an atmosphere in which good will, loyalty, 
co-operation, and respect for law and order develop spontaneously. 
Rhythmic work, consisting of folk dancing, and marching, are 
most effective means, because children love rhythm whether in 
song, poem, or game, and at this age they respond to it naturally. 
This is the time to cultivate the rhythmic sense, and strengthen 
the observational powers, and secure that automatic response which 
develops ease, naturalness, and grace of body. 
Playground games of the previous year are repeated. Many of 
these may also be used as indoor games. The following outline 
suggests the lines of work for the year with which a teacher should 
be familiar. The work is arranged according to seasonal activities 
and sequence of difficulty, and enough is presented to afford an op- 
portunity for choice according to the needs of the class.
-P-A-G-E-365
  
PHYSICAL EDUCATION—SECOND GRADE 355 
Choose two games: One folk dance, and one step in marching for 
each month. Work with these new elements until accuracy, ease, 
uniformity of response, coupled always with joyousness, has been 
attained. Health talks will be given in informal fashion, establish- 
ing habits of neatness, and order through daily inspection and attend- 
ing comment, and in the study of social and industrial life. This 
is the habit forming stage. Establish habits through cheerful 
doing. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day. 75 minutes per week. 
I. Posture Drills. 
1. Sitting. At rest. Secure good posture. Sit well back in the 
seat, hands in lap, feet on floor. 
2. Standing. Secure good posture. Ease of movement in rising. 
Stand clear of desk. Drill on ease and quietness of movement. 
3. Recitation. 
a. Sitting. Sit with back away from seat at active attention. 
Secure natural ease and economy of movement. 
b. Standing, asin reading. Head up, chest high, good breath- 
ing, book held in left hand, right hand free, facing audience. 
4. Writing. Both arms on desk, paper at slight slant, loose grip 
on pencil, head well up. 
5. Breathing. Inhale, exhale facing open windows. Use arm 
movement, head movements, and body movements, and body 
* movements freely in these exercises. 
6. Give definite drills in passing to and from blackboards; in 
forming a circle for a game; in marching. Assign definite places 
until automatic response is habitual by which ease, quietness and 
economy of efforts are gained. 
7. Dismissal. Devise a plan by which economy of time and move- 
ment are accomplished. Few commands, given by signals or words 
from black boards. 
A three minute daily drill will secure the desired result. As often 
as possible devise an imaginative play which will add an element of . 
pleasure to what otherwise is mechanical and uninteresting. See 
Stoneroad: Story Gymnastics for suggestions.

The directions for playing these games are given in detail in the 
books indicated above and will not be presented here. One game 
may be emphasized each month and though listed as an out-door 
game may. be played in-doors as well. A teacher should play out- 
doors with the children as often as possible for purposes of adding 
pleasure as well as to note results in unsupervised play. 
III. Schoolroom Plays. 
1. Sense games. 
a. Sight, hearing and re-action. ‘Have You Seen My Sheep?” — 
Graded Games, p. 23. Children in seats. One child walks around 
the room, touches some one on the shoulder and says, “Have you 
seen my sheep?” to which the child replies by describing the dress 
of a third child who, upon recognizing his own description runs 
around the room and tries to regain his place before the questioner 
can tag him. If the child is tagged he becomes the “shepherd 
b. Sight and control. ‘Hide the Stone.” Graded Games, p. 7. 
A stone or any object may be used. While the class cover 
their eyes the stone is hidden by one player where it can be seen 
without moving anything. The class go by rows to hunt. If 
a child sees it he lets no one know it, but moves to the other side 
of the room as if still looking, and then goes to his seat. The 
first one to be seated is the winner. It may also be played by

having only one child as the hunter who is guided in his hunt by 
the class singing. As he approaches the object of his search the 
music grows louder, away from it, softer. 
c. Hearing. “Jacob and Rachel.” Graded Games, p. 24. 
An old game, but excellent in training children to step softly 
and to elude the pursuer. 
Echo. [1] Song Birds. [2] A Musical Top. Each of these 
may be used to train children to recognize voices, musical tones. 
Children cover their eyes while one child selected by the teacher 
steps into the cloak room, and sings a phrase from a familiar song. 
The one guessing correctly may choose some one to leave the room. 
A musical top may be played as a circle game. One child enters 
the center, is blindfolded, and as the children move about one is 
chosen to step behind her and sing a song. Guessing correctly, 
she returns to the ring. 
d. Touch, Taste and Smell. Devise exercises similar to 
those suggested in first grade. Many occasions will arise in con- 
nection with nature study and industrial arts. ,

Directions for playing the Grandmother Game on the playground. 
1. Children form a double ring facing each other, boys in outside circle, girls in 
inner circle. Girls hold skirts in hands, boys have arms folded on chests. Partners 
look at each other and cross feet first to left and then to right in time to music as 
they sing, “I will teach you, etc.,” to “As my grandma used to do.” 
2. Partners or opposite children clasp their right hands, raise them high, while 
left hands are firmly placed on hips. Dance to left on first line of “Tra, la, la, etc.,” 
to right on second line, to left on third line, and to right on fourth line. 
3. Partners unclasp hands, girls grasp skirts, boys fold arms on chests; then 
bow to each other, girls placing right foot forward the left back and courtesying, 
while boys place feet together and bend from waist as they sing, “I will make a 
bow to you.” Partners again clasp right hands, raise them high, then change 
places in the circles, and bow again as before, as they sing, ““As my grandma used 
to do.”

PHYSICAL EDUCATION—SECOND GRADE 359 
When playing ‘‘Grandmother Game” in the class-room where single seats are used, 
alternate rows face each other, and dance up and down the aisles instead of in a 
circle. When so played, children must turn around themselves, instead of changing 
places as is done in the ring, when singing, ““As my grandma used to do.” 
FLOWER RING 
Give to each row of children the name of a common flower as “violet,” daisy,” 
etc. They form a ring around the room, join hands, and as they walk or skip, sing 
the following verse: 
“We children form a flower ring, 
And in a circle dance and sing. 
Not one of us goes in or out 
Only the daisies turn about.” 
(Tune: Smith Primer, p. 100.) 
Those children whose names are called in the song, turn around and face the out- 
side of the ring. The play is continued until all have turned, facing the outside of 
the ring. The next verse is sung, ending with the words: 
“Not one of us goes in or out 
But the whole circle turns about.” 
On the word “turns,” all turn and face in again. 
3. Marching. 
a. Single file, children arranged according to height. Marking time, halting 
accenting the time; changing from slow to fast time; running step, lightly on 
toes; reversing; introduction arm movements. Use “King of France,” ‘Ten 
Little Indians.” 
b. Marching by twos, with long steps, slow music, with short steps, quick 
music; with tiptoe, light music. March and bowing as partners meet. Aim for 
a light, free movement, without dragging or scuffing of feet, arms free except when 
used in some concerted movement. 
4, Steps. 
a. Skipping by ones, by twos, to music. 
b. Heel. March on heels. 
c. Toe. March on toes. 
d. Heel and toe. Graded Games p. 78. 
e. Waltz step as used in the Swing. Graded Games, p. 73. Children in a 
circle, with hands joined. Run forward lightly three steps. Run backward 
lightly, three steps. 
V. Health Lessons: 
1. Emphasis on the care of the teeth, the danger of the common drinking cup, 
and in putting pencils and other things used in common, into the mouth. 
2. Cleanliness of person, of desk space, of schoolroom, of food. 
3. Inspection of children’s hands and faces after strenuous play on the play- 
ground should be made daily. At luncheon-time habits of neatness and careful 
and gentle manners should be instilled. Informal discussions will arise in connection 
with the study of social and industrial life, and such problems as the following may 
be given: 
4, Why we should chew our food well. Eat slowly. Pass cups by the handle. 
Why wash our hands before eating. How to clean our teeth. Why keep our desk  
-P-A-G-E-370
  360 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
space clean. Why have fresh air in the room every hour. Why have sunlight and 
air in our homes. Why rugs are the best floor covering. Why keep our feet dry 
and warm. Why have comfortable shoes. How to keep city streets clean, 
THIRD GRADE 
Children are beginning to realize their ability to accomplish 
things and their desire to see practical results makes it possible to 
emphasize technique. They will co-operate to secure enough skill 
in the attainment of certain ends when the motive for-such drill 
arises out of their own childish experiences. The spirit of com- 
petition is developing and should be used to worthy ends. 
Simple gymnastic exercises growing out of some other problem, 
such as a folk dance, or other rhythmic work should be emphasized 
in this grade. Still keep alive the play spirit in presentation, but 
work for exactness and accuracy in the concerted movement of the 
whole group. . Aim to present daily a cycle of movements which 
include breathing, arm, leg, trunk, head and hand exercises. Vari- 
ations and recognition of sequence are needed to stimulate precision 
and energy in execution. Waste no time between exercises. Do 
no unnecessary talking and give individual criticisms quietly. 
Maintain a cheerful, quiet manner. 
Rhythmic exercises based upon imaginative and imitative plays 
are continued, giving the children an opportunity for interpretation 
of ideas through bodily rhythms. Folk dances and marching to- 
gether with simple steps develop ease and grace of movement, and 
train boys and girls in courtesy which makes for refinement. ° 
Games for indoor and outdoor play are suggested and the teacher 
should frequently participate in the outdoor games for the purposé 
of giving added pleasure to the children as well as to supervise 
their play and help them to establish right ideals of the game and 
true sportsmanship. Many games which test skill should be given. 
This is the time when children like to run races of short distances, 
use hoops, and jump rope. Relay races, hoop rolling contests, 
jumping rope, marble games are competitive and need to be regu- . 
lated under the sympathetic guidance of the teacher. Train chil- 
dren to exercise judgment upon the qualities of alertness, skill, 
poise, courtesy. 
Some apparatus should be provided for outdoor play in addition 
to the swings, balancing log, see-saws for younger children. Climb- 
ing poles, tether ball, giant stride, and means for high jumping may 
be used.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION—THIRD GRADE 361 
Provide quiet games for indoors on rainy days, such as dominoes, 
fox and geese, fish pond, word games, guessing games of various 
kinds, bean bags and ball. 
Health talks emphasizing cleanliness of person and surroundings 
will be given informally in connection with daily inspection and as 
the occasions arise in other lessons. 
Choose two games; one folk dance, and one step in marching 
for each month. Work with these new elements until accuracy, 
ease, uniformity of response, coupled always with joyousness, has 
been attained. This is the habit forming stage. Establish habits 
through cheerful doing. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day. 75 minutes per week. 
I. Posture Drills: 
1. Sitting. At rest. Secure good posture. Sit well back in the 
seat, hands in lap, feet on floor. 
2. Standing. Secure good posture. Ease of movement in rising. 
Stand clear of desk. Drill on ease and quietness of movement. 
3. Recitation. 
a. Sitting. Sit with back away from seat at active attention. 
Secure natural ease and economy of movement. 
b. Standing, asin reading. Head up, chest high, good breath- 
ing, book held in left hand, right hand free, facing audience. : 
4. Writing. Both arms on desk, paper at slight slant, loose grip 
on pencil, head well up. 
5. Breathing. Inhale, exhale facing open windows. Use arm 
movements, head movements, and body movements freely in these 
exercises. 
6. Give definite drills in passing to and from blackboards, in 
forming a circle for a game, in marching. Assign definite places until 
automatic response is habitual by which ease, quietness and econ- 
7. of efforts are gained. 
7. Dismissal. Devise a plan by which economy of time and 
movement are accomplished. Give few commands, by signals or 
words from blackboard. All pass in single file to cloak room with- 
out passing through other aisles. 
A three minute daily drill will secure desired result. As often 
as possible devise an imaginative play which will add an element of 
pleasure to what otherwise is mechanical and uninteresting. See 
Stoneroad: Story Gymnastics for suggestions.

Directions for playing “Bow low” on the playground: 
a. Children form a double ring, facing each other; opposite partners clasp right 
hands, raise them high, hips firm with left hands, look at each other, and dance 
to the right as they sing the first line, to left as second line is sung, to right for the 
third line and to the left for the fourth line. 
b. As they sing “Bow low” the girls or inner circle have hands on hips and bend 
knees, while the outer circle or boys fold arms on chest, stand feet close and bend 
from waist. Children face each other, and clap three times with “Clap three times.” 
Repeat for second ‘“‘Bow low, clap three times.” 
c. When singing the seventh line “Tra, la, etc.,” the children clap their own hands 
together on “‘tra,” right hands together on “tra,” right hands of opposite person 
on “la,” their own hands together on second “a,” left hands of partners on third 
“Ja,” hands together on fourth “la,” right hands on the fifth “la,” together on sixth 
“Ta,” left hands together on seventh “la,” and together on the eighth “la.” Right 
hands of opposite partners are clapped together on “Tra” of last line, each child 
turns himself around and claps three times as the “las,” in last line are sung. 
d. Repeat, “Bow low, clap three times,” bowing and clapping as previously di- 
rected, but instead of clapping for “Tra, la, la,” the children support their right el- 
bows with left hand and shake right forefingers at opposite partners as they sing, 
“Tra, la, la, la, la.” and change hands supporting left elbows, and shaking left 
forefingers at partners for the remaining four “las.” During the singing of the last 
line, support right elbow in left hand, shake right forefinger once on “Tra,” then 
turn around and clap three times as the eighth “las” are sung. 
When played in class-room rows face, one row impersonating girls, the other boys. 
Dance up and down aisles instead of forming circles. 
How Do You Do, My PaRTNER 
First and second rows as partners walk out and around the room followed by the 
third and fourth, then the fifth and sixth rows. When all are around the room 
they halt, face partners and sing: 
“How d’ you do, my partner? 
How d’ you do today? 
Will you dance in a circle? 
I will show you the way.” 
While singing the first line, all make a deep bow. On the second line, partners 
clasp right hands and shake. Keeping the right hands clasped, partners grasp left 
hands on the third line, then turn, facing in line of direction while singing the last 
line. 
All skip forward around the room while repeating the tune with “4a, la.” 
V. Health Lessons: 
1. Cleanliness. 
a. Attention to the necessity for cleanliness of the hogy. 
b. Care of the hair, nails, mouth and teeth.

FOURTH GRADE 
The work of this grade does not differ from that of the previous 
year save that even greater emphasis may be placed upon technique 
since this is primarily the period when drill does not seem irksome. 
The element of competition makes a strong appeal and should be 
wisely used in both indoor and outdoor games. There is a demand 
for tests of power and a wholesome pride in dfficulties overcome. 
Familiar games may be varied slightly so as to add new features of 
: increasing difficulty as the pupils become more skillful. Variations 
in gymnastic exercises are essential to add interest by which to 
secure the necessary precision and energy in execution which will 
bring physical benefit. 
Daily exercises which include breathing, arm, leg, trunk, head and 
hand movements are continued and whenever possible related to 
* some larger problem, as the folk dance or other rhythmic exercises, 
_in preparation for some event. Motivation of physical exercises 
is essential to success. An outdoor program of play, or play festival 
is a desirable end to keep in view from the beginning of the year. 
Class contests and interschool contests should be arranged for at 
the-close of school. _ For this reason, the aim of each exercise is clear- 
ly presented as a part of a larger whole which spurs the pupil to 
keener effort. 
Folk dances and rhythmic work are continued, working for exact- 
ness and accuracy, securing that ease and bodily grace which de- 
velops poise and control. In out-door plays stress is placed upon 
games which test skill in control, in endurance, and speed. Games
-P-A-G-E-376
  366 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
involving running, jumping, skipping, are characteristic. Train 
pupils to exercise judgment with alertness, quiet control, and poise. 
Play at recess periods should be compulsory, and out of doors 
when weather permits. The presence of the teacher participating 
in the games is always welcome and benefical. Emphasis should be 
placed upon fairness, honesty and generosity in the game until the 
play group disapproves instantly of all attempts by individuals to 
secure advantage to self at the expense of fair play. 
Provision should be made for rainy days by having such games 
in the classroom as dominoes, checkers, parcheesi, fox and geese; 
geography, arithmetic, literature, and nature [usually card] games; 
and quiet, thinking games, such as riddles, guessing and charades. ° 
Health lessons will be given incidentally as occasion arises in 
connection with nature study, geography or industrial arts. Habits 
established in previous grades are continued by vigilance on the part 
of the teacher, whose watchful care and example coupled with ju- 
dicious criticism and praise develops a wholesome class pride in 
personal appearance, and responsibility toward neat and attractive 
surroundings. 
Time allotment: 15 minutes per day. 75 minutes per week. 
I. Posture Drills: 
1. Sitting. Secure good posture. Sit well back in the seat, 
hands relaxed, usually in lap, feet on floor. 
2. Standing. Secure good posture. Ease of movement in ris- 
ing. Stand clear of desk. Drill on ease and quietness of movement. 
3. Recitation. 
a. Sitting. Sit with back away from seat at active attention, 
Secure natural ease and economy of movement. 
b. Standing. As in reading. Head up, chest high, good 
breathing, book held in left hand, right hand free, facing audience. 
4. Writing. Both arms on desk, well forward in the seat, paper 
at slight angle, penholder pointing over right shoulder. oe 
5. Breathing. - Inhale, exhale, facing open windows. Sai 
with arm, head, trunk movements. 
6. Give definite drills upon passing to and from blackboards, ‘ : 
for marching. Assign definite places’ until automatic respon 
habitual by which ease, quietness, and economy of effort are sere 
7. Dismissal. Devise a plan by which economy of time ‘and 
movement are accomplished. Give few commands, by signals or , 
words, preferably the former. All pass in single file to cloak: room” 
without passing through other aisles.

IT. Calisthenics: 
1. Emphasize some element selected from the folk dance or the 
rhythmic exercise by further drill to improve technique. Always 
help the pupil to recognize the purpose or need to stimulate enjoy- 
ment in the acquisition of accurate response control. 
2. Develop a cycle of exercise for daily practice which includes 
breathing, arm, leg and trunk movements using two-count exer- 
cises; four-count exercises; relating two parts of the body in alter- 
nation; relating two parts of the body in combination. Vary the 
presentation and present a sequence in difficulty. 
3. Lesson Plan for three minute daily drills: 
a. Formation. Class rise, take distance, and place according 
to height. Pupils should usually be seated according to height. 
Secure good standing position; heels together, toes turned out- 
ward. 
b. Breathing exercise. Inhale, exhale, facing open windows. 
Arm and breathing exercise. 
. Arm and finger movement. 
Leg movements. 
Trunk exercise. 
Leg movements, with steps. 
Head movements. 
i. Resting, in seats in good sitting position, 
4 Emphasize each phase in separate lessons with variations until 
automatic vigorous response has been attained.

SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN 
THE GRAMMAR GRADES* 
FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH GRADES 
. Value of physical education in the daily curriculum: 
- ‘There are three phases of life within each human being—the 
physical, mental, and moral—and each must be developed to make 
‘the perfect man. And yet it is surprising that we devote.such an 
infinitesimal part of the school time to physical training. ce 
“Ts it not time for us to realize that the proper physical develop- 
ment of the child has to do not with fifteen or twenty minutes of 
gymnastic drill given five times a week, but with all the physical 
activities of each’ of the daily twenty-four hours of the week?”— 
Wm. A. Baldwin. 
To increase a child’s usefulness in the community through health 
and power by stimulating love and respect for his own body, and 
arousing his moral nature through a sense of law and justice that 
comes with a game is no small thing to lose from daily living, and 
this he must lose when no period is provided for physical training. 
II. Essential characteristics of the years from 10-12 in a child’s 
life process: 
“In general there is a lessened rate of physical growth, particu- 
larly for boys, but rapid structural development; there is an apparent 
lull in the demands upon the system; it is the period of greatest 
immunity from disease, the specific intensity of life culminating in 
this period—at eleven to twelve in girls, and at twelve to thirteen 
in boys; the development of the special senses and their association 
is continuing; the co-ordination of muscular action and feeling 
seems to be the special import of this period in the nervous system; 
it is the time for the development of facility and skill; it is a period 
of great physical actvity; now comes the height of interest in running 
games. The element of co-operation in plays and games is develop- 
ing, although the individual still remains prominent.”—Johnson: 
Education by Plays and Games.

VITAI LAMPADA 
(Play the Game!) 
There’s a breathless hush in the Close tonight— 
Ten to make and the match to win— 
A bumping pitch and a blinding light, 
An hour to play and the last man in. 
And it’s not for the sake of a ribboned coat, 
Or the selfish hope of a season’s fame, 
But his Captain’s hand on his shoulder smote 
“Play up! Play up! and play the game!” 
The sand of the desert is sodden red,— 
Red with the wreck of a square that broke;— 
The Gatling’s jammed and the colonel dead. 
And the regiment blind with dust and smoke. 
The river of death has brimmed his banks, 
And England’s far, and Honour a name, 
But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks, 
“Play up! play up! and play the game!” 
This is the word that year by year 
While in her place the School is set 
Everyone of her sons must hear, 
And none that hears it dare forget. 
This they all with a joyful mind 
Bear through life like a torch in flame, 
And falling, fling to the host behind— 
“Play up! play up! and play the game” 
—HeEnrY NEWBOLT. 
Through the good work of the director of the Public Athletic 
League in Maryland, Dr. Wm: Burdick the State Legislature [1918] 
showed that it was thoroughly cognizant of the principle of right 
living and good citizenship for it enacted a law that will give every 
boy and girl in the State and County the opportunity for the best 
kind of physical education. The law reads, in part: 
1. Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, that there 
shall be established and provided in all the Public Schools of this State and in 
all schools maintained or aided by this State physical education and training 
for pupils of both sexes during the following minimum periods: A. In the ele- 
mentary public schools at least fifteen minutes in each school day and also at least 
one hour of directed play outside of regular class-room work in each school week. 
B. In Public High Schools at least one hour in each school week and also at least 
two hours of directed play or athletics for all pupils outside of regular classroom 
work in each school week.
-P-A-G-E-381
PHYSICAL EDUCATION—GRAMMAR GRADES 371 
Section 2. And be it enacted, that the State Board of Education upon 
recommendation of the State Superintendent of Schools shall appoint a Super- 
visor of Physical Education whose duty it shall be to direct and carry out the 
provisions of this act under the direction of the State Superintendent of Schools 
Section 3. And be it further enacted, That immediately after this appoint- 
ment the Supervisor of Physical Education, under the direction of the State 
Superintendent of Schools, shall organize his work and shall formulate the neces- 
sary and proper plans, courses and regulations for carrying out the provisions 
of this Act which when approved by the State Board of Education shall be fol- 
lowed in providing physical education and training as required under section 1 
of this act. 
IV. Habit formation: 
Work for correct posture, for correct breathing, and make sure 
that there is abundant fresh air to breathe. Dr. Luther Halsey 
Gulick says, ‘No child should be permitted to go through school, 
any more than through West Point, with a bad back. There is no 
excuse for it, unless the child is an actual cripple, and it is one of 
the greatest stigmas which can be laid upon us teachers that there 
are children leaving us who do not carry themselves properly, per- 
haps none greater than the way we carry ourselves,” and Miss Alta 
Wiggins, director of physical education in the Buffalo schools, adds: 
“The teacher of every grade has a fine opportunity during the first 
month of school to give pupils a good start in the formation of cor- 
rect school habits before they begin to form incorrect ones. It is 
not too soon the first day to insist that all sit up in a proud, strong 
way; that all stand with straight knees, crown of the head high, 
neck touching the back of the collar, and to walk about with light, 
elastic step. These habits are not developed by much talking on 
the part of her teacher, but through her example, showing that she 
persistently keeps herself up to the standard which she has set for 
those under her care. Often a kind glance, a lifting of the head, 
a little greater effort at arching the chest forward, or some other 
significant gesture of the teacher, accomplishes more than any 
amount of talking.” 
V. General points in subject-matter and method: 
Physical development is an essential and important part of edu- 
cation, and is especially helpful to students who are doing much 
mental work. Hence it is necessary to give those physical exer- 
cises that are beneficial to the body and which in return develop 
rhythm, control, grace, and co-ordination.
-P-A-G-E-382
  372 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
It has been found that a certain type of physical work instead of 
being a help, has been a hindrance; the stiff, jerky movements 
devoid of grace and rhythm only produce rigid bodies; stiffness and 
rigidity are antagonistic to intellectuality. The development of an 
elastic frame should be the aim of all physical teachers, and the first 
step must necessarily be to get the body elastic. The flexibility 
of body and the control of masterly, graceful and purposeful move- 
ments should be made the basis of all physical education. Efficiency 
of movement attains the maximum result with the minimum amount 
of exertion. This is the outcome of continuous and intelligent 
practice. 
The first step in learning a muscular movement is to get a clear 
idea of the movement. The teacher who gives this clear idea, must 
have a clear idea herself, and must also be able to perform the move- 
ment accurately. If clothing or some physical disability makes it 
impossible for the teacher to do this, a chart of pictures can be used, 
or one of the more advanced pupils can serve as a model. Wording 
and speaking of commands must be such as will secure exact unison 
in the work of the class) The command must leave no doubt 
, whatever as to what is to be done, how it is to be done, when it is 
to be done. The tone of the voice in which commands are spoken 
is very important. Speak as if interested, enthusiastic, and con- 
fident. 
F OUTLINE OF WORK 
L. Subject-maiter: 
1. Forms of activity should be selected that will function in rendering the future 
life more efficient; this will be accomplished by— 
a. Affording opportunity for the development of social and moral values, 
such as group activity, loyalty, honesty, etc. 
b. By relieving the individual of the element of inactive and fine co-ordina- 
tion which prevails in the academic classroom studies. 
c. By increasing the strength of the heart, lungs, and muscles, sufficient for 
the needs of the individual. 
d. Inhibiting unskillful co-ordination and bad postures through training in 
skillful co-ordination and good postures that are the types of those to be used in 
life. 
2. These forms of activity should be correlated with the present interests of the 
individual. 
3. These forms of activity should express an idea, feeling or emotion, or should be 
performed with reference to some objective aim. 
Zh, Organization of subject-matter: 
I. Forms of activity should consider the age and health of the individual. 
2. Tuey should consider the si sex after the sixth grade.

  3. They should consider the development of the child as an individual with refer- 
ence to the accessory muscles, and also with reference to the development of puberty. 
4, They should be developed from the ae the complex. Coarse, rapid work 
should come before highly co-ordinated work. 
III. Kinds of exercises: 
1. Hygienic. 
2 Recreative. 32"Educational. 
TV. Hygienic exgreises: 1. Open..windows during exercise. 
2. Precede the day’s lesson by.deliberate deep breathing: 
a. Standing feet apart; clear nostrils by use of handkerchiefs. 
b. Breathe in through right side of nose closing left; hand lowered slowly, 
breathe out; repeat two or three times. 
Breathe in through left side of nose, closing right; hand lowered slowly 
breathe out; repeat two or three times. 
c. Both hands down at side, breathe in and out. 
d. Feet together, breathe through both nostrils, in—out. 
e.. Deep breath, press (drawing in abdomen); relax; breathe out. 
ide Work : for correct st: standing a and sitting.positions: 
Fundamental standing - Positions: 
Feet together. 
. Knees straight. 
Work up to body. 
Head erect. 
Eyes to the front. 
Shoulders down. 
. Arms quite loose. 
4, Asa eer exercise, fundamental standing position aims to do three things: 
a. To strengthen muscles used in holding good posture. 
b. To stretch some tissues and control others, so as to correct the effects 
of bad posture. 
c. To train the muscular sense and proper nerve centers so that correct 
posture will be taken. 
This exercise should be given before and after each lesson. 
As bad postures are apt to be most common in the seventh and eighth 
grades, we should work for correct posture from first grade to the eighth. 
5. “In place! Rest!—” 
Move right foot one foot length to rear, and assume an easy posture without 
leaving floor position. 
Purpose.—To cultivate normal posture and serve as a starting position for 
other exercises. 
(The class should always be at rest during explanation.) 
V. Order of exercises: 
When time given to gymnastics is short and the work is done in the class room, 
it is often best to attempt little more than posture, a few rhythmical, and some 
aesthetic arm and leg movements, always planning to provide More-vigarous ex- 
ercises at other times in the form of plays and games. meaogop a]

374 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
1. Introductory exercises: order movements, facings, simple arm and feet posi- 
tion, and opening order are good examples of order movements. We may call any 
new movement an order movement. ° : 
2. Leg movements: these exercises are intended to give the general effect known 
as “warming up;” which includes a slight rise in the temperature of the body, mod- 
erate increase of the heart action and breathing, and sending more blood to the mus- 
cles. The heat that causes the warming up arises from the chemical action that 
takes place in the muscles during exercise. Since we wish a large amount of chem- 
ical change without fatigue, we choose exercises that employ the larger muscles 
in the body rather than the smaller ones. Marching, heel raising, running and other 
movements where the lower limbs lift the entire body make the best movements 
or this group. 
3. Arch flexions: these are backward bending of the neck and upper portion of 
the spinal column, taken with the object of correcting round shoulders. This fault 
of posture so common among school children, always flattens the upper part of the 
chest and lessens the range of the breathing movements and so diminishes the capa- 
city of the lungs. By the practice of arch flexions the muscles supporting the chest 
are developed and also those that hold the spinal column erect. The tissues across 
the front of the chest and shoulders are stretched at the same time, making it grad- 
ually easier for the person to hold normal posture and to breathe deeply— 
Head bending backward with support of back of school seat. 
Head bending backward from preliminary standing position. 
Holding head backward while taking arm movements. 
Trunk bending backward with support by pupils. 
e. Arms upward, head dropped on chest—raise head to counts of three. 
4. Heave movements: heave movements are movements of the arms that help to 
expand the chest. Typical heave movements sometimes called the true heave 
movements are those in which the body, is suspended by the arms, as in climbing, 
swinging on rings, etc. 
Large muscles passing from the chest to the upper arm are used in these 
movements exerting an upward pull on the ribs, and thus enlarging the chest. 
Since these “suspension” exercises are too severe for some pupils, and as 
apparatus is not always provided—milder arm movements having a similar effect 
are used: arm-raising, arm stretching, neck firm, etc., are examples. 
5. Balance movements: These are for general improvement of posture and cul- 
tivation of ability to maintain the balance under difficulties. 
Heel raising. 
Leg raising (this should be taken right and left in alternation). 
Knee bendings. 
Knee raising. 
Marching on balance movements. 
Poising on toe of one foot. 
6. Back exercises: in order to cultivate control of the posture of the trunk and to 
develop and train the back muscles to hold the trunk properly, we used positions 
in which the trunk inclines so as to throw the weight of the upper part of the body 
on the back muscles.— 
a. Trunk forward and downward with easy arm positions. 
b. Fail out, arms forward. 
c. Fall out, arms outward.

_ 7, Abdominal exercises: the purpose of abdominal exercises is to cultivate the 
ability to maintain good posture of the trunk, to. strengthen the abdominal muscles, 
and to stimulate the digestive organs.— 
a. The trunk is to be held in normal position in all the exercises which aid 
in promoting good postures. 
b. Incline backward from sitting position. 
c. Stride forward. 
d. Kneeling position or half kneeling position. (Kneeling position—incline 
backward from knees, 45 degrees.) 
e. Leaning forward and supporting the weight of the body on the hands and 
feet. 
Leaning position with hands on top of desks—pupils standing in aisles 
of school room. 
f. Raising knees; hang from the hands. 
8. Lateral trunk exercises: these are movements in which we bend the trunk 
laterally, twist it, or incline it sideward for the purpose of increasing the mobility 
of the spinal column, improving the posture of the trunk and stimulating the ab- 
dominal organs. 
A peculiarity should be noticed in the use of stride sideward as a starting 
point for side bendings. It is the easiest position for beginners to learn side bend- 
ing, since it gives a wide base of support. 
9. Running and Jumping: Here is the climax of the lesson. The work should be 
the strongest and most difficult of all. 
Games when space permits are useful: running, jumping, and more vigorous 
fancy steps are the exercises most used. 
VI. Recreational a: i ises: 
The play impulses of children have one all-important office, that of giving rise 
to habits and permanent interests. There is a time when boys love and must learn 
to play ball, and other team games, or be deficient in such sports. 
There is a time when the habit of activity, that is, the habit of work and of 
enjoyment, is formed; and its opportunity lies in beginning the right connection 
between play and work at the right time. The ages 10-12 years mark the right time 
for beginning team work.

Dances make the children think more clearly and quickly; develop good com- 
radeship and create happiness and pure joy. 
Dancing develops the muscles, making them long, firm, and graceful, while 
athletics tend to develop them round and hard. 
To be able to execute the dance movement one must feel the rhythm. The 
figures and the steps are better described than the real essence, atmosphere or spirit 
which gives so much pleasure.

A. GENERAL DIRECTIONS: 
In a good gymnastic lesson the following points should be considered. 
. Ventilation: All windows lowered a short and equal distance by a monitor. 
. Temperature: 65 degrees. 
. Lighting: Adjustment of curtains to admit sufficient light. 
Good posture in sitting and standing. 
Ease of movement in rising and sitting. 
Promptness in obeying commands. 
Correct name of exercise given as designated. 
. Correct signals and commands given as designated.

10. Tone of voice adapted to movement taken. 
11. Accuracy of position taken for exercise. 
12. Precision in execution. 
13. Energy in execution. 
14. Good carriage of body while exercising.

17. Individual criticism when necessary quietly given from side and back of 
room. 
18. Uniformity of motion. 
19. Quietness. 
20. Cheerfulness of manner in execution. 
B. SEATING: 
Since it is injurious for pupils to sit in cramped positions in seats which are too 
small, or to sit in seats so high that their feet do not touch the floor, the Board of 
Education requires that: 
“Each teacher having in her room a set of adjustable desks shall, at the begin- 
ning of each half year, measure the pupils with the measuring rod provided with 
each set of furniture and see to it that desk and seat are adjusted to fit the child 
at all times.” 
C. ARRANGEMENT OF CLASS FOR EXERCISES: 
At the beginning of each half year, the teacher should assign to each pupil a 
place for physical exercises to‘be taken after rising. The arrangement should be 
according to height, with the shortest pupils in the front row across the room. 
D. EXPLANATION OF PRINTED TERMS: 
Signals for taking arm or leg positions printed on the preparatory drill will not 
be printed on the later lessons. 
The italicized signal in the center of the page above the dotted line is the signal 
on which the position for the exercise is taken. 
The italicized signal below the dotted line in the center of the page is the signal 
for returning to standing position. 
Signals in a brace are to be repeated as many times as it is desirable to take the 
exercise. The signal farthest to the right finishes the exercise. 
“Teacher count” means to count ONE AND, TWO AND, etc., returning to 
starting position on AND. 
“Teacher count four” means to make four successive movements. 
“Take the movement on six counts’”’ means that one movement is to be done 
on six counts. 
When the abbreviation Rep. for the word Repeat is printed at the right of 
the figure designated the number of times an exercise is to be taken a pupil returns 
to standing position before repeating the exercise. 
E. APPLICATION OF WoRK: 
It is of the utmost importance that a practical application of the lessons in writ- 
ing, rising, sitting, standing, walking, ascending, and descending stairs be insisted 
upon at all times during the day, thereby forming correct habits.

Cornish May Dance. 
An even number of couples, numbered One and Two form a circle facing in 
line of direction. 
Partners join inside hands and place outside hands on hips. During seven 
measures of the music all run forward twenty-eight steps swinging inside arms. Dur- 
ing eight measures couples number One, without dropping hands, turn around and 
face couples number Two thus forming groups of four. 
At the beginning of the second part of the music couples run four steps toward 
each other, then four steps back to place. During third and fourth measures girls 
come diagonally forward two steps take right hands and swing each other four steps 
and return to places on two steps. 
During repetition of first two measures of the second part fours join hands 
and with eight steps make a complete circle to left. On third measure couples One 
run forward under raised arms of couples Two. On last measure turn and face in 
line of direction ready to start forward again. 
Note: These first three folk dances are for the fifth grade; all the rest are for 
grades sixth to eighth. 
Swiss May Dance. 
“The cuckoo is singing, the May it is here; 
In the fields and the forests, the green doth appear. 
Then dance, children, dance, while the sky it is blue, 
Turn ’round and turn under, while I go with you.” 
Partners form a double circle, join inside hands and place outside hands on 
hips. 
Starting with the inside foot take six light running steps forward while singing 
“The cuckoo is singing.” Partners face each other, step back with inside foot mak- 
ing deep courtesy on six counts while singing “the May it is here.” Repeat, run- 
ning in opposite direction and singing “In the field and the forest, the green doth appear.” 
During the singing of the third line partners clasp right hands and, starting 
with left foot, change places by taking three running steps. Place right foot back 
and on three counts make deep courtesy to partner. Repeat returning to original 
places. 
Partners again clasp right hands and, while singing the last line, those of the 
inside circle make one complete turn under raised arms and run forward to the next 
dancer of the outside circle. On the last six counts new partners make deep courtesy. 
Repeat the whole with new partners.

PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE 
FIFTH. GRADE 
Ages 10-12: Characteristics of this period in the child’s develop- 
ment: 
This is the most important period in elementary education so far as details of 
school work and the formation of habits are concerned. The body is not growing so 
rapidly, the brain has practically ceased growing, and there is not the great func- 
tional advance which is to accompany the advent of puberty in the period follow- 
ing. There is a lull in the demands upon the system—it is a time of storing up 
energy. There is less liability to disease. . 2 ' The heart is 
gaining in proportionate size and strength as compared to the arteries, and there 
is less liability to fatigue than in the previous period. The child is at the height of 
physical activity. More games are played now than at any other age. 
In the nervous system while the brain has practically ceased growing in weight 
it is changing rapidly in structural development. According to Clouston, the special 
import of this period in the nervous system is the co-ordination of muscular action 
and the senses. The co-ordination begun in the previous period, but not developed 
to the fine point of adjustments, are now given depth and scope. This is the time 
when there must be laid the foundation of any future great skill. Skill in games, 
in manipulation, in the use of tools, in the playing of musical instruments, correct- 
ness and facility in the pronunciation of foreign languages cannot be so surely ac- 
quired if delayed beyond this period. It is therefore the period for drill and the 
forming of neuro-muscular habits. 
Reasoning remains comparatively weak throughout this period, but is slowly 
strengthening. A tendency to critical judgment is appearing. The perceptive 
powers continue active. and the child is capable of close observation. It is still 
an eye and ear period. Memory is likewise strengthening, particularly memory 
for objects and their names. Imagination is active, suggesting here the value of 
objects and pictures for illustration. The animistic tendency is disappearing and 
superstitions are decreasing. The child is quite susceptible to suggestions, but he 
is influenced more by companions than by adults. Hé is never so removed from 
grown-ups as at this period. He is still selfish and self-assertive, yet gaining in 
social interest. He begins to form societies or clubs largely for games, athletics, 
and predatory expeditions, but he unites with others rather for his own profit. In 
the co-operative games the individualistic element still remains prominent. -There 
is an increased regard for rule and law. 
In the matter of games, interest in running games is culminating. 
Interest in collections is at its height. The methods of collecting are by ain 
and, in this period increasingly, by trading and buying. In nature interest in 
pets, particularly in dogs and in the training of dogs, is rapidly increasing, reaching 
culmination in the next period. Interest in nature collections is high." Great interest 
in dolls is continuing. . - In construction interest increases 
in the details and skill of Sgstnn sti In literature the dormant interest of the 
boy is shown in preference for action and adventure. There is added interest in 
history, in historical biography, and in general literature. The general puzzle in- 
terest culminates in mechanical puzzles at eleven years of age, in geometrical 
puzzles at from twelve to thirteen.

The games and plays of this period will be of great number and variety, involving 
great activity, considerable skill, often some co-operation, and will tend to further 
the development of the finer motor adjustments and the co-ordination of muscular 
action with sense judgments which it is the special office of this period to develop. 
They will also involve all the developing powers of the child, each peculiar need of 
the boy and girl being met by the emphasis upon this or that feature of the activity 
which the awakening interest will determine.—Johnson: Education by Plays and 
Games. 
Certainly as Dr. Johnson outlines, in the large, the physical and 
mental nature of the fifth and sixth grade child, we are in a posi- 
tion to say that the following course of study offers a splendid op- 
portunity to direct the daily regimen of the fifth grade child from 
the time he rises in the morning until, and after, he goes to bed at 
night. 
It is to be hoped that the teacher will take advantage of the Boy 
Scouts’, the Girl Scouts’ and the Campfire Girls’ movements, if her 
pupils belong to any of these organizations, by allowing the pupils 
to give talks describing the activities that go on in the camps. 
Each teacher should make a daily inspection of the hygienic con- 
ditions in the class room if habits of cleanliness are to be fixed and 
if she values the hygienic and sanitary conditions that affect the 
life of her pupils. The inspection will take note of the following 
“conditions: 
1. Personal cleanliness of the pupils: hair, teeth, nails, nose, 
clothes. 
2. Ventilation of the room; fresh air; the best temperature for 
energy in work; experiment for this. 
3. Physical exercises at intervals during the day. 
4. Blackboard-writing for eye strain. 
5. Posture for correct muscle and bone habits. 
6. Size of school desks in relation to size of pupils. 
7. Breathing habits; [watch for mouth breathers, and, for them, 
if possible, consult a physician]. 
8. Speech habits. 
9. Lunch inspection, care, and suggestions for eating, with op- 
portunities provided for wholesome conversation while lunch is 
being eaten.

sweet oil. 
(2) Alkali poisoning—lye, ammonia, etc. 
Give vinegar or lemon juice followed by olive oil. 
III. Physical exercises and recess recreations: 
Physical exercises five minutes each day and the free play on 
playground provide a laboratory for the teacher which will enable 
her to see whether the children are experimenting with the knowl- 
edge they have gained about their bodies, and are obeying the prin- 
ciples of physical conduct upon which their own health, and that 
of their comrades, is based. The physical exercises give develop- 
ment to the following: 
1. Good position. 
2. Arm movements. 
3. Leg movements. 
4. Arm and leg combination movements. 
_ 5. Head movements.

SEVENTH GRADE 
Ages 13-15. Characteristics of this period in the child’s development: 
Just as there was, at about the age of eight or nine a period of readjustment of 
motor ideals, so at about twelve, the last year of the previous period, there is a time 
of halting, uncertainty, and readjustment of social ideals. We are now at the 
threshold of a new birth, a new conception of life and of the use of powers. 
This is the period of most rapid bodily growth. The heart increases rapidly in 
size relative to the blood vessels, and there is a marked increase in blood pressure. 
There is also a rapid increase in lung and chest capacity, in strength of grip of hand, 
and in control of accessory muscles. The sexual organs are developing rapidly. 
While the brain is not perceptibly increasing in weight, there is a rapid structural 
change and accelerated development of association fibers. It is the period of great- 
est tendency to nervous disorders, and there is an increased liability to disease. 
This is the time of the most rapid development of the heart, and emotions. Love, 
pity, fear, anger, jealousy, emulation, ambition have a new awakening. There is 
frequently great emotional instability. Anger and pugnacity increase; sympathy 
increases. There is periodic laziness, awkwardness, self-consciousness, tendency 
to reverie, dreams of greatness, self-assertion. There is a tendency to affection 
and mannerisms, to slang, to desire to show off, to freakishness and pranks. 
There comes now a new tendency to imitation and suggestion. There is a shift- 
ing of susceptibility to influence of companions, to susceptibility to influence of 
adult ideals and example. There is a striking increase in susceptibility to religious 
influence; also the greatest liability to incorrigibility, misdemeanors, and crime. 
There is a desire to leave home, yet susceptibility to homesickness. There is a 
keen sense of humor, a tendency to practical joking, great sensitiveness to praise, 
censure, or ridicule.
-P-A-G-E-407
  PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE—SEVENTH GRADE 397 
There is now an increasing tendency to rudimentary organizations, gangs, clubs, 
and great interest in competitive and co-operative games; also in taking and giving 
of ‘stumps.’ The circle of favorite games is narrowing, and sex differences become 
prominent. There is great admiration for physical prowess, hero worship, love of 
adventure, and love of hunting and camping. 
Reasoning is strengthening. There is on the whole less liability to errors in 
reasoning. The memory is increasing and the imagination is very active. The 
general reading interest is at its height. A genuine historic interest appears; also 
interest in drama. The collection interest gains in definiteness and permanency. 
There is great interest in nature and the training of animals. There is an increase 
in the regard for money and for trading. The puzzle interest involves mainly 
language and arithmetical puzzles. There is an increased interest in music and in 
rhythm. 
The environment in this period, then, should furnish opportunity for games and 
plays involving great physical activity and adapted to develop the large muscle 
areas, to continue the development of the finer motor adjustments, and to relate 
individual activity to a social group. These plays should develop the manly qual- 
ities—courage, generosity, staying power, and social consciousness. The increased 
interest along the many lines mentioned above should be a means for supplying 
many varied activities tending to direct the attention and interests without rather 
than within, relieving the peculiar and often morbid emotional tendencies of this 
time. The narrowing circle and increased intensity of interest make this a favorable 
time for fixing permanent interests in some line—in athletics, nature, science, lit- 
erature, music, or art.—Johnson: Education by Plays and Games. 
Each teacher in each grade should make a daily inspection of the 
hygienic conditions in her classroom if habits of cleanliness are to 
be fixed, and if she values the hygienic and sanitary conditions 
that affect the life of her pupils. The inspection will take note of 
the following conditions: 
1. Personal cleanliness of the pupils: hair, teeth, nails, nose, 
clothes. 
2. Ventilation of the room, fresh air, the best temperature for 
energy in work with experiments to help establish a working tem- 
perature. 
3. Physical exercises at intervals during the day. 
4. Blackboard writing for eye strain. 
5. Posture for correct muscle and bone habits.

Ages 13-14. Characteristics of this period in the child’s development: 
Just as there was, at about the age of eight or nine a period of readjustment of 
motor ideals, so at about twelve, the last year of the previous period, there is a time,
-P-A-G-E-409
    
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE—EIGHTH GRADE 399 
of halting, uncertainty, and readjustment of social ideals. We are now at the 
threshold of,a new birth, a new conception of life and of the use of powers. 
This is the period of most rapid bodily growth. The heart increases rapidly 
in size relative to the blood vessels. and there is a marked increase in blood pressure. 
There is also a rapid increase in lung and chest capacity, in strength of grip of hand, 
and in control of accessory muscles. The sexual organs are developing rapidly. 
While the brain is not perceptibly increasing in weight, there is a rapid structural 
change and accelerated development of association fibers. It is the period of great- 
est tendency to nervous disorders, and there is an increased liability to disease. 
This is the time of the most rapid development of the heart and emotions. _ Love, 
pity, fear, anger jealousy, emulation, ambition have a new awakening. There is fre- 
quently great emotional instability. Anger and pugnacity increase; sympathy in- 
creases. There is periodic laziness, awkwardness, self-consciousness, tendency to 
reverie, dreams of greatness, self-assertion. There is a tendency to affectation and 
mannerisms, to slang, to desire to show off, to freakishness and pranks. 
There comes now a new tendency to imitation and suggestion. There is a shift- 
ing of susceptibility to influence of companions, to susceptibility to influence of 
adult ideals and example. There is a striking increase in susceptibility to religious 
influence; also the greatest liability to incorrigibility, misdemeanors, and crime. 
There is a desire to leave home, yet susceptibility to homesickness, There is a 
keen sense of humor, a tendency to practical joking, great sensitiveness to praise, 
censure, or ridicule. 
There is now an increasing tendency to rudimentary organizations, gangs, clubs, 
and great interest in competitive and co-operative games; also in the taking and 
giving of “stumps.” The circle of favorite games is narrowing, and sex differences 
become prominent. There is great admiration for physical prowess, hero worship, 
love of adventure, and love of hunting and camping. 
Reasoning is strengthening. There is on the whole less liability to errors in reas- 
oning. The memory is increasing and the imagination is very active. The general 
reading interest is at its height. A genuine historic interest appears; also interest 
in drama. The collection interest gains in definiteness and permanency. There 
is great interest in nature and. the training of animals. There is an increase in the 
regard for money and for trading. The puzzle interest involves mainly language 
and arithmetical puzzles. There is an increased interest in music and in rhythm. 
The environment in this period, then, should furnish opportunity for games and 
plays involving great physical activity and adapted to develop the large muscle 
areas, to continue the development of the finer motor adjustments, and to relate 
individual activity to a social group. These plays should develop the manly qual- 
ities—courage, generosity, staying power, and social consciousness. ‘The increased 
interest along.the many lines mentioned above should be a Yneans*for supplying 
many varied activities tending to direct the attention and interests without rather 
than within, relieving the peculiar and often morbid emotional tendencies of this 
time. The narrowing circle and increased intensity of interest make this a favor- 
able time for fixing permanent interests in some line—in athletics, nature, science, 
literature, music, or art.—Johnson: Education by Plays and Games. 
Each teacher in the grade should make a daily inspection of the 
hygienic conditions in her classroom if habits of cleanliness are to

  GENERAL SCIENCE 
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES 
Up to the Sixth Grade the study of nature has consisted mainly 
of lessons based on zoology and botany. In the Sixth Grade, phys- 
iology, personal hygiene, and civic sanitation form the core of the 
science work. In the Seventh and Eighth the course in general 
science is mapped out tentatively and is drawn mainly from the 
field of physics. It should be supplemented by the chemistry of 
foods, cookery, and textiles in the home economics course for the 
grade and by the introduction to biology that comes with the study 
of the insects that bring disease to mankind. 
The seventh and eighth grade teachers after consultation, may 
apportion the outline between the two grades. A single laboratory 
may be secured, upon request, from the office of the supervisor. 
Just as soon as the course is established in all the schools the seventh 
and eighth grade teachers will be called together to give criticisms, 
and suggestions for revising the work. Fortunately, or unfortun- 
ately, the work must be done without a textbook in the hands of 
the pupil, (that will come later) but each teacher will be supplied 
with a desk copy of a manual of simple experiments: 
Note: For the arrangement and planning of the outline we are indebted to 
M. E. G. McCloskey, principal of the Agricultural High School, Sparks, Baltimore 
County. 
I. Air: Some of its characteristics: 
Air is a material, a gas occupying space. 
Experiment 1. Try to push an empty wide-mouthed bottle held upright with 
mouth downward, into water in a deep bucket. There is something which pre- 
vents the water from entering. Was the bottle really empty? Bicycle and auto- 
mobile tires and inflated footballs show evidence of being filled. Another appli- 
‘cation is the diving bell used for men working below the surface of the water. 
Experiment 2, Wet the palm of the hand and hold it tightly over the mouth 
of a lamp chimney while you push it,down into water. (A large cork to close the 
end of the chimney will serve the purpose better.) The result is the same as with 
the bottle. Now take the hand from the top of the Sey and again push it 
down into the water. Result? Why? 
Experiment 3. Fill the bottle used in Experiment 1, ane invert in water, being 
careful that the water does not run out. Using a rubber tube or bent glass tube 
blow water up into the bottle. The air takes the place of the water, and the water 
drives it out. This illustration shows the principle by which men remain alive 
for some time below the deck of a wrecked ship, but are drowned at once if a hole is 
cut in the deck.

GENERAL SCIENCE 405 
II, Air has weight and causes pressure: 
Experiment 1. Fill a chemical flask partly with water and heat over an alcohol 
lamp until the water is boiling in the flask. Then insert a tight cork into the mouth 
of the flask and remove from the flame. Allow it to set until quite cool, and then 
cool further by pouring cold water over it. After time the flask will burst, not 
out but in, from the pressure which the air on the outside (15 pounds to the 
square inch) exerts on the flask. The equalizing pressure has been removed from 
the inside by making a partial vacuum there. (The bottle has been filled with 
steam which drives out the air. When this is condensed it occupies much less 
space and the inside pressure is removed.) 
Experiment 2. Construct an intermittent siphon using a funnel, one-holed 
cork, and bent glass tube. Fill the funnel slowly. When the water has passed 
over the highest point of the delivery tube, gravity starts the water flowing from 
the outlet. This continues until the surface of the water in the funnel tube has 
been lowered below the inlet tube, when it ceases to flow until the water has again 
filled up the delivery tube. This forms a natural siphon, which flows at regular 
intervals. It is the cause of springs which flow and stop, flow and stop, etc. 
Experiment 3. Using a flask, a straight glass tube, a bent tube, a two-holed rub- 
ber stopper, and a water glass. Fill the flask with water and invert so that the 
straight tube is below the surface of the water in the glass, and the bent tube 
runs to a waste bucket. The attraction of gravity starts the water flowing from 
the bent tube. The removal of this water from the flask lessens the pressure of 
air in the flask, and the outside air pressure, becoming greater relatively, forces 
the water up the straight tube from which the air has been exhausted. 
Note: Experiments 2 and 3 give the principles upon which pumps and me- 
chanical siphons work. Water flows in air-exhausted tubes 34 feet, if they are 
mechanically perfect, practically about 32 feet. Water can not be raised with a 
siphon higher than this, nor can the valve of a pump which sucks water up be more 
than this distance above the surface of the water. Mercury being 13 times as 
heavy as water rises 1/13 as far, and this principle is used in the construction of 
the barometer. The greater the air pressure on any particular day the greater 
is the rise of mercury in the air-exhausted tube. As the density of air is greater 
at sea level than on the high lands, so will the barometer reading be greater at sea 
level. 
Experiment 4. Fasten a candle to the bottom of a shallow pan with a small 
amount of water in the bottom. Light the candle and set a lamp chimney over it 
The flame burns for a moment and then dies out. Remove the chimney, light the 
candle, and place the chimney over the flame again so that there is an open space 
between the bottom of the chimney and the surface of the water. The candle con- 
tinues to burn. Set it down in the water and it goes out. Light the candle again 
and set the chimney over it and in the water, first having inserted a piece of card- 
board the width of which is equal to the diameter of the chimney, and which is 
about three inches long, into the upper end of the chimney. The flame will con- 
tinue to burn, and if a lighted match is held on each side of the cardboard the direc- 
tion of the current of air on each side may be discovered. 
From this experiment the principles of combustion, and breathing may be 
drawn. The candle, to burn, needs oxygen from the air. When the oxygen is 
used up carbon dioxide takes its place, and it being heavier than air does not flow  
-P-A-G-E-416
  406 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
out of the chimney. If, however, the air is allowed to come in at the bottom of 
the chimney a circulation is set up and a continuous supply of fresh air is furnished. 
The heat from the candle warms the air above the flame causing it to rise in the 
chimney and out of it while the cold air, which contains more oxygen. rushes in 
from below to replace it. The use of chimney for fires in houses, and tall smoke- 
stacks for manufacturing plants may be explained from this. House and barn 
ventilation are explained from the last part. 
III. Expansion and contraction of liquids, gases, and solids from change in tempera- 
ture. 
Experiment 1. Usinga flask fitted with a one-hole cork and a straight glass tube, 
fill with water until the surface of the water is just above the cork in the tube. Heat 
slowly. The water will expand and rise in the tube. When cooled it will lower to 
its original place. The blacksmith uses this principle when he heats a tire to ex- 
pand it, places it over the wheel, and cools it. When it cools it contracts and sets 
tight over the felloe of the wheel. We use it when we open a glass stoppered bottle 
(in which the stopper is set) by pouring hot water over the neck, thus expanding 
the neck, not the stopper. In the construction of bridges in which long steel spans 
are used only one end is fastened, the other being free to move on rollers to care 
for the expansion and contraction due to change in temperature. Land and sea 
breezes are due to expansion and contraction of the air over certain areas. 
Water reaches its maximum density at 4 degrees centigrade. Unlike other 
materials it expands both below and above this figure. Consequently water freez- 
ing in a container is likely to burst it. The water of a lake when freezing becomes 
lighter on the top than at the bottom, and the ice remains on the surface. Other- 
wise the ice would sink and the lake would become a solid mass of ice, and all life 
in it would be destroyed. 
A gas expands 1/273 of its volume for every degree’s rise in temperature, 
and contracts a like amount for a fall in temperature. This accounts for the reason 
why cold air is more invigorating than warm air. We breathe in more oxygen . 
in the same volume of air. Figure the number of cubic feet of air we must breathe 
to consume 10 square feet of oxygen, if oxygen makes up one-fifth of the air, at 40 
degrees C. and 20 degrees C. below zero. These temperatures on the centigrade 
scale correspond approximately to 100 degrees F. and 0 degrees F. 
IV. Cooling by evaporation. 
Experiment 1. Fill each of three 4 oz. bottles half full of ether, alcohol, and 
water respectively. The bottles should be provided with corks and should have 
been standing in the room long enough to acquire room temperature. Hold a 
thermometer with a string attached to the end and swing it slowly through the air 
until it acquires a reading of the temperature of the air and until the mercury be- 
comes constant. Record this as room temperature. Insert the thermometer in 
the ether bottle until the bulb is below the surface of the liquid. After one-half 
minute record the temperature as that of ether in a closed vessel. Repeat the oper- 
ation with alcohol, and water. 
Experiment 2. Pour into evaporating dishes enough of each liquid to cover 
the bulb of the thermometer. Pour about the same amount into a test-tube and 
set aside. Place the thermometer in the evaporating dish which contains the ether, 
watch the temperature until it ceases to change and record. Repeat with alcohol 
and water, and with the ether in the test tube.
-P-A-G-E-417
GENERAL SCIENCE 407 
Record as follows. 
Temperature of room = 
Temperature of bottle of ether = 
Temperature of bottle of alcohol = 
Temperature of bottle of water = 
Temperature of ether in dish 
Temperature of alcohol in dish = 
Temperature of water in dish = 
Temperature of ether in tube = 
Experiment 3. Place a drop of each liquid on your hand, and notice the order 
in which they disappear. What feeling do they impart to the flesh? Can you 
connect this with the rate of evaporation. In evaporating, a liquid or solid must 
obtain heat, and it usually does so from the nearest available medium, in this way 
lowering the temperature of the medium. We would expect that those which 
evaporate the more rapidly would absorb’ heat the more rapidly. How does this 
check with your observations? 
Experiment 4. If we were to increase the rate of evaporation, we would ex- 
pect to cool the surrounding medium still more rapidly. Wrap a bit of absorbent 
cotton about the bulb of the thermometer and dip it in water. Wave it through 
the air to increase the rate of evaporation and note the temperature. Record it 
when it becomes constant. Repeat with alcohol, and again with ether, and record 
the constant temperature. 
This principle is of practical importance in certain of the ice manufacturing 
machines, in which a portion of the water put in the machine is evaporated by re- 
moving the air pressure on it, and in so doing removes sufficient heat from the rest 
of the water to cause it to solidify. Climatic conditions near large bodies of water 
are affected by this condition, being cooler in summer when the water is evaporat- 
ing, and warmer in winter when the water is freezing. Dew, rain, fog, and hail are 
formed when the temperature of the atmosphere is lowered sufficiently to bring 
about saturation. Additional cooling brings about condensation and precipitation. 
V. Soil and its water holding capacity: 
Experiment 1. Fill two lamp chimneys, one with clay and one with sand, 
both rolled fine, and packed in the tubes. Set in a pan of water and record the 
height of the water as it rises in the tubes. Water tends to fill empty spaces in the 
soil, and will do so when it is able to wet the sides of the space, then rising to the 
space above. The chimneys must have a bottom made of cheese cloth to hold 
the soil. 
Upon this depends the rise of the water from the water table in land to supp-y 
water for the use of plants during a dry spell in the summer. It is very important in- 
agriculture. The kind and condition of the soil affects the rate of rise very much, 
largely, because the air space determines whether the water is able to rise or not. 
Farmers try to get their soil in such condition that the water will rise freely. The 
same thing is illustrated by the rise of oil in a lamp wick, and the spread of ink on 
a blotter. 
VI. Work and working capacity: 
Exberiment 1. The principle of work accomplished depends upon the force 
employed times the space through which it moves, i.e. W=F times S. Thus with 
a pulley or series of pulleys the work accomplished is equal to the amount of force 
used multiplied by the space through which the force travels. This is to obtaina 
mechanical advantage. Speed is sacrificed to obtain power. 
   
-P-A-G-E-418
  408 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Experiment 2. Theory of moments. Suspend a meter stick so that it bal- 
ances. Then let a mass weighing say 300 grams be hung by a thread 15 cm from 
the fulcrum. Then suspend 100 grams at a point on the opposite side where it 
will again cause the stick to balance. This point will be found to be 45 cm. from the 
fulcrum. The product Fl’=WI1”. No matter where the weights are placed on 
either side of the fulcrum, the product of the acting force by its distance from the 
fulcrum will be equal to the resisting force W times its distance from the fulcrum. 
Explain by the same principle, the capstan, jack-screw, worm-wheel, vise, and 
windlass, all of which are used to obtain mechanical advantages for work to be done, 
and while using less force than work accomplished move through more space than 
does the work accomplished. 
The work accomplished is never equal to the energy expended because of 
mechanical inefficiency. That which is lost is transformed to heat, which is said 
to be due to friction. If we pound a piece of metal we soon find that it becomes 
hot. In this case little work is accomplished and most of the energy is transformed 
to heat. 
Method: 
By experimenting with some of these household applicances show how 
and why they help us and how much the lever gives us the advantage in our 
work. 
By further experimentation the three classes of levers may be discovered. 
Note: It is left to the discretion of the teacher not to make the work too 
technical but to develop sufficient knowledge of the subject to make the work scien- 
tific and at the same time to keep it very simple.

of the machine here, and also the Jaw of work. 
VII. Magnetic fields and magnetism: 
Experiment 1. Lay a bar magnet in a groove in a board. Place a large sheet 
of paper over it, and sift iron fillings evenly over it. Tap the paper gently with 
a pencil. The filings will be found to arrange themselves in symmetrical curves 
running from one pole to another. Hold a compass in a number of positions over 
the board, and see whether there is any connection between the direction of the 
curved lines and the direction of the needle. These lines indicate the direction of 
the magnetic force, and are called magnetic lines of force. Make drawings of 
these lines of force, indicating on the drawings both the north and south poles. 
Using combinations of magnets, determine the nature of the magnetic field in each 
case and make drawings of them. 
Experiment 2. Mark one end of a knitting needle with a file for the sake of 
identification. Stroke it from end to end with the north pole of a horseshoe or bar 
magnet. Note its effect upon the compass. As we continue to stroke it with the 
magnet it produces greater effect upon the compass, until it becomes “saturated,” 
when further stroking produces no change upon the compass. Drop the needle 
on the floor and test its effect upon the compass. Strike it several blows with a 
hammer and again test with the compass. The effect of the magnet upon the 
compass will be found to be lessened by jarring and striking. 
Experiment 3. Magnetize a long darning needle. When the whole needle 
is dipped in iron filings, there will be found to be an appreciable effect upon the 
filings all along the needle. Break the needle in two parts and test the ends with 
the compass. Again break one of the halves and test again. It is assumed that 
a magnet consists of rows of molecular magnets arranged end to end. 
Experiment 4. Note how much deflection one of the pieces of magnetized 
darning needle produces upon the compass. Then place it in a stirrup made of 
copper wire and heat to redness. When tested with the compass after cooling 
it will be found to give very little if any deflection of the compass. The heating 
sets the molecules of the metal in motion and they lose the magnetism they hold. 
If heated again and transferred while hot to a position ‘between the Poles of a horse- 
shoe magnet, and then tested after cooling, it will be found to give considerable 
deflection on the compass. 
Experiment 5. Hold a small steel nail between the poles of a horseshoe 
magnet so that it does not touch the magnet, and strike it several sharp blows with 
a hammer. When removed it will be found to be magnetized. Test the poles 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
410 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
with the compass, remembering that north pole attracts south pole, and repels 
north pole. T ‘urn it end for end between the poles of the horseshoe magnet and 
strike several blows again. On testing with the compass it will be found that the 
poles have been reversed in the nail. 
Lessons on terrestial magnetism may be drawn from this. The use of the 
compass by woodsmen, and mariners, etc. 
VIII. Explanation of the electric bell. Induced magnetism. Movement of electric 
currenis through conductors. Conductors and non-conductors. 
Experiment 1. The electric bell is one of the simplest applications of the 
electro-magnet. When the button P is pressed the electric circuit is closed, and a 
current flows in at A, through the magnet, over the closed contact point C and out 
again at B. As soon as the current is established the electric magnet E becomes 
* magnetized and pulls over the armature a, and E becomes demagnetized. The 
armature is thrown back against C by the elasticity of the springs which supports 
it. The contact is then made again, the current begins to flow and the process 
isrepeated. The circuit is automatically made and broken, at the “make and break” 
C, and the hammer is set in rapid vibration against the gong. (An illustrative draw- 
ing of the electric bell can be secured at the supervisor’s office.)

HISTORY: PRIMARY GRADES 
The present course of study presents some modifications of the 
old, both as to subject matter and method, but the outline offered 
here is by no means final. It simply represents what seems to be 
at the present time best adapted to the particular needs of our 
pupils. 
The work of the earlier grades cannot with exactness be called 
history. It is rather a study of social situations, aiming to help 
little children to gain an intelligent grasp, as far as their capacity 
permits, of the great whole world in which they live. From a study 
of the near and immediate home relations with which they are fam- 
iliar, they are led through the work of the father and mother to 
community activities which provide them with the necessities of 
life. The universal family idea is emphasized through strongly 
marked contrasts found in the home of the Eskimo and the home of 
Hiawatha. 
In the second grade the elements of time and change are intro- 
duced through a study of selected types of primitive life. Con- 
stant comparison with present day life aided by concrete illustration 
helps the children to interpret the complex social life about them. 
Through studies of simple societies, using the primitive forms 
selected as typical and by comparison, the history aspect grows 
until in the third grade the children complete the cycle from the long 
ago past to the present. The remote takes on a new aspect in its 
relation to the near and immediate and this ever widening circle 
now termed local history includes not only the community, but 
the town, the state, and her neighbors. The sequence is from the 
present back to the past, then to the present, the sweep of the circle 
increasing in scope each year until there is developed from a vague, 
crude idea the definite elements of time, place, movement, and change 
which mark the beginnings of the historic sense. 
The fourth grade begins a new cycle of work, based upon the 
local history of the previous grade, in answer to a natural question 
or problem which should arise, viz.: How, when, where,—did people 
in the old world find out about the new? For the first time a 
logical succession of events, each depending on the preceding, is 
presented beginning with the world history as it affected the col- 
onization of Maryland and her neighbors. The European back- 
(412)

  HISTORY—FIRST GRADE 413 
ground of American history, the discoverers and explorers, and the 
colonists are treated in a simple manner, and the children are able 
to see the transplanted European change into an American. The 
children grow in historic judgment. 
Vivid portrayal of accurate information regarding persons, places, 
events, and the common things of former times is the key to good 
history concepts. Concrete illustrations, through pictures, draw- 
ings, objects; constant comparison with present day conditions, 
feeding the imagination with authentic information to make more 
vital connection with the past, and at the same time placing the 
present in its right perspective is the province of history. 
What the primary grades aim to give: 
1. Orientation of the child in his environment. 
2. Vague, crude beginnings of the historic sense developed as 
evidenced in the appreciation of the elements of time, place, move- 
ment, and change in relation to the historic concept. 
3. Significant data full of accurate detail, plenty of color and 
warmth. 
4. Simple problems, the solution of which to be gained through 
sufficient data already given. Mere guess work to be avoided alto- 
gether. 
5. Correlation of geography and history facts. 
6. Opportunity for oral composition and the dramatic effort as 
means to increase enjoyment and retention of historical data.

FIRST GRADE 
Socializing the Child. The work is not history in its true 
sense, but rather industrial history, which includes history, civics 
and social life; and its purpose is to socialize the child by present- 
ing familiar and typical experiences in the home and environmeht 
which will enable children to grasp the idea of social interdependence 
through concrete illustration. 
The: conditions, activities, industries and occupations of the im- 
mediate environment provide the basis for the first year’s work and 
much of the second. The common and familiar affairs of everyday 
life are thus made to seem worth while, are dignified by the serious 
consideration given them through sympathetic appreciation and
-P-A-G-E-424
  414 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
study. Much of the work in nature-study, hygiene and construc- 
tive activities is closely related to the social and industrial life, 
and as far as the children are concerned should form one unified 
whole. 
The method used may be designated as informal discussion of 
simple problems within the scope of little children illustrated by 
means of pictures, blackboard drawings, stories told and drama- 
tized, songs and games. Constructive work affords the opportunity 
for doing which goes hand in hand with the simple talks about com- 
mon and familiar things. A summary of the method of procedure 
may be indicated as follows: 
\. a. First-hand experiences in the home excursions, or dramatiz- 
ations in the ‘‘make-believe’’ world at school. 
b. Doing or making something in response to an apparent need 
—a child’s problem. 
c. Story-télling by the teacher. Dramatization by the children. 
d. Informal talks with children, gathering facts—few and simple 
—in relation to some definite aim. Oral composition, both class 
composite and individual effort. 
e. As children gain power to read, the Language Reading Unit 
based upon the oral composition or class story is used for reading. 
f. Creative work with materials, in constructing, drawing, 
modeling, writing, furnishes opportunity for expression of ideas 
gained through first-hand everyday experience, through excursion, 
through story and dramatization, through songs and games. 
Time allotment: This work closely correlates with Industrial 
Arts. Recitation: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. 
Seatwork: 15 minutes per day; 75 minutes per week. Industrial 
Arts: Three 30 minute periods per week. Total: 240 minutes 
per week.

SECOND GRADE 
Social and Industrial Life. The work of the second grade is 
not history in its true sense, but rather the social and industrial 
history which includes history, civics, and social life; and its pur- 
pose is to socialize the child by presenting familiar typical exper- 
iences in the home and environment which will enable the children 
to grasp the idea of social interdependence through concrete il- 
lustration. 
The familiar experiences deal chiefly with the fundamental needs 
of man: food, clothing and shelter, and since these activities are a 
part of the child’s environment are easily approached from his 
native interests, and are related to the evolutionary and historical 
standpoint through the study of primitive life. Modes of living 
among people of primitive conditions will be contrasted and com- 
pared with present day modes. Two sets of conditions far apart 
in time are thus introduced and by comparison the concepts of 
time and change are gradually developed, becoming more significant 
in the succeeding grades. This work forms a foundation for the

local history of the third grade. Celebration of national holidays 
gives opportunity for historical facts which are important in de- 
veloping patriotism. All the work aids in forming national ideals. 
Children living in city surroundings need to study types of indus- 
tries and activities in the environment in their relation to country 
life, and should become familiar with country life through excur- 
sions, visits, pictures, and helpful discussions. 
Children living in the country need to study types of activities 
in the environment in their relation to city life, thereby becoming 
familiar with significant phases of city life by the same means. 
The starting point, is, therefore, dependent upon the needs of the 
children. The aim is to make concrete the unfamiliar, and to use 
the known for purposes of comparison. 
Method. The method used may be designated as informal 
discussion of simple problems within the scope of little children, 
illustrated by means of pictures, blackboard sketches, stories told 
and dramatized, and songs and games related to industrial activity. 
Constructive work affords the opportunity for doing which goes 
hand in hand with the simple talks about common and familiar 
things. A summary of the method of procedure may be indicated 
as follows: 
a. First hand experiences in the home and community, .excur- 
sions and dramatizations. 
b. Setting a problem through doing or making something in 
response to a need which to the children seems valid. 
c. Informal talks with children, collecting and arranging facts 
in relation to the problem. Oral composition, both class composite 
and individual effort. 
d. Language-reading units based upon the oral composition. 
e. Creative work with materials in constructing, drawing, 
modeling, writing, furnishes opportunity for expression of ideas 
gained through first-hand every-day experience, through excursion, 
through story and dramatization, songs and games.

THIRD GRADE 
Local History. The work of the second grade aims to socialize 
the child by presenting familiar and typical experiences and to 
develop the concepts of time and change through two widely differ- 
ing sets of conditions—the modern and the primitive. This forms 
a basis for the local history of the third grade. The children do not 
find it difficult to pass from the immediate present in their own 
locality to a remote past, and this ever widening circle of experience 
includes the beginnings of true history. For the first time a logical 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  HISTORY—THIRD GRADE 2 43 
sequence of events, each depending upon the preceding, is pre- 
sented. The sequence is from the present back to the past, then 
to the present, the sweep of the circle increasing in scope each year 
until there is developed in a crude way the elements of time, change 
and movement which mark the beginnings of the historic sense. 
The work, then, of the first three grades forms one cycle. 
Local history contains a natural interest and reality which makes 
it possible to extend the line of vision beyond the home, town and 
neighborhood to the county, state, and to a limited extent, to 
neighboring states. The national holidays give opportunity to 
present national characters. 
The purpose is to instil a love of country, sowing the seeds of 
patriotism, through deepening the respect and love for those in the 
community and extending this to those in the state and nation who 
have helped to make it great. 
This is accomplished through graphic presentation of simple and 
interesting history material. Stories are told, excursions are taken 
to historic spots, whenever feasible; pictures are utilized, and con- 
‘structive work made and used in illustration, thereby making the 
history facts simple and concrete, avoiding formal, didactic pre- 
sentation. In this grade the history story and the dramatic effort 
go hand-in-hand. Some of the historical characters and events 
worthy of dramatization are indicated below, and preparation for 
the drama and the costumes should be made for regular use, year 
after year. The following are suggested: Indians and Pioneers; 
Thanksgiving Day; Betsy Ross and the Flag; The Star Spangled 
Banner; The Burning of Peggy Stewart. Others may be added. 
In this grade no book is placed in the hands of the children but 
they need to record the simple history facts gleaned from various 
sources in some permanent form; by means of pictures, post cards, 
or other illustrations together with the summaries in the form of 
class stories for purposes of retention and recall, thus making in- 
dividual history books. 
The method of procedure briefly summarized is as follows: 
1. Excursion to some point of local interest as a basis for talks 
on local history; pictures, and other illustrative material used 
when the excursion is impossible.

HISTORY—THIRD GRADE 439 
Suggestive Treatment of Local History Stories. The data 
for the Local History Stories related to the Community and the 
County is secured through the co-operation of teachers of the 
Third Grade, and the students of the Seventh and Eighth Grades 
under the direction of their teachers. The material obtained 
by conferences with the oldest residents in the community, by 
consulting pamphlets and publications of local persons and land 
companies, by reading historical books, is, for the most part, formal 
and didactic in nature. There arises, then, the need for its adapta- 
tion to suit the capacities of the children. In adapting the material 
to meet the specific interest of children, certain salient points are 
selected as worthy of presentation and organized into an interest- 
ing unit in three ways, each dependent upon the other, viz.: 
1. The Outline: made by teacher, or by teacher and children, as 
a basis for informal discussion of some pertinent facts, both social 
and historical. 
2. The History Story: the data organized in story form and writ- 
ten from the standpoint of the adult to be adapted in presentation 
to the comprehension of the children. 
3. The Children’s Reading Story; based upon some one interest- 
ing incident in relation to the larger whole to be used as reading 
material. 
The following illustrations indicate these three types. 1. The Out- 
line—Westport. 2. The History Story—The History of my Home 
Town. 3. The Children’s Reading Story—Grandfather’s School.

HISTORY—THIRD GRADE 441 
The old Reistertown turnpike, which straggled up Stony Hill and on through 
Pikesville to Reistertown, was a lonely and uninteresting thoroughfare on which long 
lines of white-hooded country wagons weekly threaded their way to Baltimore mark- 
ets from Manchester and other distant places. Each day a lumbering stage-coach 
jolted over the rough road enroute from Baltimore to Reistertown. Would-be 
passengers met the coach at the old “Hand House” on Paca Street, or they could 
book passage where the Commonwealth Bank now stands on Howard Street when the 
_stage would call for and deliver them at any point along the route to Reistertown. 
By the roadside, on the brow of Stony Hill, an enterprising Pennsylvanian opened 
a tavern for man and beast. “The Three Mile House”’ proved a convenient place 
for countrymen to put up for the night as it insured an early morning start for the 
distant farm or when coming in the markets. 
Ere long ‘The Hammet House” opened its doors directly opposite the aussie 
tavern and here the county squires and huntsmen were lavishly entertained in tap- 
room and dininghall of this aristocratic hostelry. Many rollicking tales are told of 
this rendezvous for Baltimore County sports who here regaled themselves when re- 
turning from the tournament or chase. 
About 1785 John Hook of Manchester decided to no longer drive his country van 
o’er the weary miles from Pennsylvania to Baltimore, so he, with his wife, the young 
daughter of Daniel Boone, settled in a log house on the Reistertown Road near 
“the bridge” or the present neighborhood of Wylie Avenue. Life proved very 
lonely here for these pioneer settlers, but John was saving money so they endured 
much, Other members of the Hook family and their friends built for themselves 
cabins or farm-houses in the neighborhood, until in 1800 fifty or more families were 
scattered between Pikesville, Baltimore, Pimlico Road and Liberty Pike. This 
little settlement became known as ‘‘Hookstown”’ and the Reistertown turnpike, the 
“Hookstown Road.” 
Among others came Father Henry Smith, a retired circuit rider of the Methodist 
Church, who built for himself a substantial home on Hookstown Road near the five- 
mile stone, and named it Pilgrim’s Rest. His books which have become classics in 
Methodist circles were written here. He, together with others of the Hook settle- 
ment, founded a Methodist Society about 1811. Prayer-meetings were held in a 
log church near Pilgrims’ Rest on Church Lane. In 1822 a stone chapel replaced the 
log meeting-house. Here a gallery in the rear was reserved for the negro slaves who 
always worshipped with their masters. The singing as heretofore was without music 
and one hymn-book served for four or five members. This meeting-house was named 
McKendree Chapel for a loved bishop of that day. The village grave-yard gradually 
grew around the chapel and still endures, an old landmark now myrtle and ivy-grown, 
where many moss-covered tombstones mark the last resting place of Hookstown’s, 
early settlers. For many years the chapel’s deep-toned bell called the villagers to 
prayer, but in 1894 the old building was razed to the ground and McKendree church 
as it stands today was erected beside the parsonage near Pilgrims’ Rest. 
Each day the stage-coach dropped the village mail at the post-office and store 
kept by Joseph Feelemyer and here too, chance visitors alighted to meet their wait- 
ing friends. The old post-office still stands in its modern dress on the turnpike near 
Church Lane and is today occupied by members of the Feelemyer family. 
For many years the village school was a log house on Church Lane near McKendree 
Chapel and the master “boarded ’round” and made himself generally useful in 
neighborhood affairs. Pilgrims’ Rest was a rare retreat for such men as the “Mas- 
ter” or traveling preachers. When Dr. Hill with his trunk descended from the stage-  
-P-A-G-E-452
  
442 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
coach into Hookstown it was at Pilgrims’ Rest that he found a welcome accorded 
him until he became established. In 1895 a modern district school was erected on 
the turnpike above Church Lane. 
PART II 
LATER Day TRANSPORTATION 
The little settlement of Hookstown jogged on for many years aroused only by the 
advent of the stage-coach, but one day in 1870 a horse-car plodded up Stony Hill 
and on to Pikesville, carrying passengers from Cumberland Street and the Hooks- 
town Road on to Pikesville for the small sum of 25 cents. For 15 cents they were 
dropped at Rogers Avenue in Hookstown, and the stage-coach soon felt the competition 
for people crowded around the egg-stove in the Pikesville car and talked of the prog- 
ress of time as they jolted over the miles of lonely country roads. For several years 
a number of representative citizens of Hookstown and Pikesville, headed by Patrick 
Walker, had been negotiating with land-owners for the right of way and had at last 
succeeded in laying a single track from Baltimore to Pikesville. 
To many who traveled on the car-line the trip to the city was a long talked-of 
event, and Maying-parties found their way from the city to Seven-Mile Lane in 
search of the sweet blossoms that skirted highway and hedges. Picnickers together 
with those on business bent made the car-line a very popular thoroughfare out of 
the city. About this time the steam railroad laid its tracks through the village en- 
route to western Maryland, but made its first stop out of the city at Pikesville. 
But other things were destined to awaken the sleepy town: a racing company had 
established its tracks on the Pimlico Road between Rogers and Hayward Avenues 
and they negotiated with the railroad to place a platform at Church Lane near Pil- 
grims’ Rest from which point they carried a boardwalk out Hayward Avenue to their 
tracks. A railroad station was erected on Garrison Avenue in 1872 and many for- 
sook the horse-cars to steam quickly to adjacent towns and distant places. The 
Pimlico Company now laid a switch to connect with the railroad near Church Lane, 
but when the electric cars were established aout 1392 it was only used to convey 
freight to the track. For a stated sum neighboring farmers were permitted to side- 
track fertilizers and other chattels for private use. i 
The electric railway used the old horse-car route to Pikesville along which a modern 
thoroughfare known as Park Heights Avenue has been developed. A branch rail- 
way to West Arlington has been connected with the main road at Belvidere Avenue 
for the convenience of cross-country residents. 
PART III 
THE NAMING OF My Home Town 
As the wheels of time jogged on many changes came to the little village of Hooks- 
town on the crest of Stony Hill. For years it had reposed quietly within its bound- 
aries with nothing more enlivening then the advent of the horse-cars to Pikesville 
and the laying of the Western Maryland Railroad tracks to Westminster. But one 
day in 1870 a racing company purchased a tract of land on the old Pimlico Road from 
Roger’s Avenue beyond Hayward Lane and established its tracks. They negotiated 
with the railroad to place a platform known as Pimlico Landing at Church Lane from 
which point a board-walk was laid out Hayward Avenue to the clubhouse. But, alas, 
Hookstown now threatened to be submerged into Pimlico, at which the good old 
Methodist community rebelled. Indignation meetings were called in the log school- 
house on Church Lane, and one citizen, Mr. Oakford, offered a site on Garrison Avenue, 
about one-half mile below Pimlico platform to the railroad on which to build a station
-P-A-G-E-453
  
HISTORY—THIRD GRADE 443 
to be named for the town. To this the railroad agreed, but the citizens unanimously 
protested that Hookstown was no longer a suitable name as the Hooks had either 
died or removed elsewhere; so another meeting was called, each citizen being advised 
to come prepared to offer a new name for the old settlement. 
The evening came, the meeting was called, and the secretary placed the various 
names upon the blackboard. Belvieu, Belvidere, Ashburton, Auburndale, and others 
were suggested and voted upon. ‘The interest was tense as the voting was close, and 
all seemed uncertain what name to select, when an aggressive little Jew, well known 
and popular in the village, arose to his feet and shouted ‘‘I vote that we name him 
‘Arlington’ for the home of the great George Washington!” The absurdity of his’ 
gross ignorance of history made a hit and the place was unanimously named Arling- 
ton. The name was in due time placed above the door of the little railroad station 
and Arlington took its place among the railroad towns of Maryland. 
GRANDFATHER’S SCHOOL 
By GRacE MERRYMAN 
“Grandfather,” said ten-year-old James one afternoon when he came from school 
“we had moving-day at school today. The teacher said that we might move our 
books into any seat which was preferred. I moved into the front seat near the win- 
dow, where the sun shines in. I think it is the most pleasant seat in the school 
room.” : 
“Yes,” said grandfather, “I think that must be a delightful place to sit and 
study.” 
“Did you sit in that seat when you went to school?’’ asked James. 
“My dear boy,” replied grandparent, “‘do you know that I received nearly all 
of my education in the old log granary which stands out here beside the lane?” 
“In the old log granary beside the lane!’’ exclaimed James, ‘‘ Was that little build- 
ing ever a schoolhouse? Please tell me about it, grandfather.” 
“Well,” grandfather began with a contented sigh, ‘“‘It has been more than seventy- 
five years since I started to school. The old log granary stood out in the lane at the 
corner not far from the county road. It was probably built there because there was a 
spring near by where we went each day to get water. There were no wells in those 
days. Even all of the houses were built near springs. 
“Our seats were nothing but rough, wooden benches with no backs, just such as 
you might sit upon at a picnic. They were not to be compared with your smooth, 
comfortable seats, each with a desk in front to write upon.” 
“Did you not have a desk, grandfather?” asked James. 
“The desks, James, were nothing but boards fastened around the sides of the room, 
and when we had writing to do we sat there.” 
“Where did you keep your books, pens, and pencils, grandfather?” 
“We had but few books, James. We were not given beautiful and suitable books 
at school as you are. We had to furnish our own books, and many who could not 
afford to do this, brought any book they had at home. But few pupils had books 
alike and there were no grades. For pens we used goose quills sharpened to a point, 
and we often had to take them to the teacher to be resharpened.”’ 
“How funny to think of having pens sharpened,” said James, and then after think 
ing a moment he eagerly questioned, “Do you think I could make a goose quill pen, 
grandfather?”
-P-A-G-E-454
  444 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
“Bring me a feather,” said grandfather, ‘“‘and I will make one for you.” 
James ran to the barn and soon came back with a fine, long feather from a goose’s 
wing. Grandfather quickly sharpened one side of the quill to a point and told James 
his pen was ready for use. James went to the desk, got a piece of paper and the ink, 
and after writing for a few moments, he said slowly, “Well, grandfather, it writes, 
but I think I like my steel pen best. I enjoy hearing you tell about your school, 
but I think I would rather attend my own school.” 
“You are right, James,” said grandfather, “your school is far better than mine was 
when I was a boy.” - 
FOURTH GRADE 
The work of the third grade has aimed to awaken an interest in 
local history by making the children familiar with the historical 
landmarks of the immediate community, county, and state, to- 
gether with a few of the national heroes. This has developed a 
taste for historical reading and an interest in history itself. The 
work of the fourth grade meets the need of this widening interest, 
and upon this foundation aims to give the pupil through types of 
discovery and exploration and colonization, some understanding 
of how the world has come to be known as we find it today. 
Each phase of the work is planned to give some expression of the 
world’s history, how the movement for discovery and colonization 
originated, and that emigration to and settlement in America were 
only a repetition of what was happening from earliest times, and 
that emigration and discovery are still going on. The names of 
the travelers and discoverers and pioneers appear as the history 
makers of earlier times, but in the history of the United States, 
and of North America, as a whole, it has lasted from the time of 
Columbus, almost to the present. McMurry says: ‘No other 
country has had such a pioneer history, such a race of men as the 
early Friends, the Virginians, the Puritans, the French, the Scotch- 
Irish, pushing westward to subdue and civilize a continent.” 
The child as he reviews the great achievements on land and sea, 
should be influenced to overcome difficulties through the contem- 
plation and appreciation of the valiant deeds of real heroes. 
Story-telling and dramatization should be continued in this grade. 
There should be the development of topics, often based upon some 
very simple problem, which increases the power to organize the 
points in the oral presentation and to read with discrimination from 
the text-book. Much illustrative material, particularly pictures 
and maps for map-reading should be used. Children should be 
encouraged to make collections of pictures that may stimulate the 
imagination in picturing times and historic events different from 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
  
HISTORY—FOURTH GRADE 445 
our own. Such devices as the “time string,” or some concrete rep- 
resentation may aid in developing ideas of time and change. 
Children of this grade should keep a history note book in which to 
record the simple problems, or lesson assignment, the outlines made 
by teacher and children, and the written summaries, both class and 
independent, made by the children. Whenever feasible some il- 
lustrative work should accompany the record. 
The teacher’s plan or organization of material is the basis for the 
training in logical thinking. Problems for this grade must be 
kept simple and to the point. Irrelevent material must be cast 
out and only that retained which is pertinent to show development.

HISTORY: GRAMMAR GRADES* 
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES: SOME 
SUGGESTIONS 
A New Point of View. The following excerpts are taken from 
the chapter “History for the Common Man” in The New History 
by James Harvey Robinson, published by the Macmillan Company, 
and used with the permission of the author. In this, our day, science 
and industry, hand in hand, are playing such important roles that 
they have revolutionized social, industrial and commercial ways. 
Professor Robinson discusses the changed and changing interests 
of the present age and asks of the past an explanation of the present, 
suggesting the kind of information we need to cull from history 
to explain why we today are as we are and contrasting it with the 
useless information we so frequently get from the records of past 
events: 
HISTORY OF THE COMMON MAN 
Should a student of the past be asked what he regarded as the most original and 
far-reaching discovery of modern times, he might reply with some assurance that it 
is our growing realization of the fundamental importance and absorbing interest of 
common men and common things. Our democracy, with all its hopes and aspira- 
tions, is based on an appreciation of common men; our science, with all its achieve- 
ments and prospects, is based on the appreciation of common things. 
It is our present business to see what can be done for that very large class of boys 
and girls who must take up the burden of life prematurely and who must look for- 
ward to earning their livelihood by the work of their hands. But education has not 
been wont until recently to reckon seriously with the common man who must do com- 
mon things. It has presupposed leisure and freedom from the pressing cares of life. 
This conception can be traced back to the Greeks, who established the tradition 
that education should be “‘liberal”” and based on “‘liberal arts,” by which they meant 
those studies and that training which they believed appropriate for a freeman who 
was supported by slaves and who had before him a life of leisure. When a particular 
study suggested in any way practical usefulness, it lost forthwith its “liberal” charac- 
ter, for it could only be advantageous to a slave. It has proved very difficult to 
get away from this long cherished conception of education, for we do not realize 
vividly enough the changes which have taken place since Aristotle painted his portrait 
of the “highminded” man. The Greeks had neither democracy in our sense of the 
term, nor natural science as we understand it, with its multiform applications to life. 
Slavery has disappeared, and the ancient occupations of the slave have undergone

such a revolution, have been so diversified and shown such possibilities of improve- 
ment with the advance of scientific discovery, that modern industry bears little re- 
semblance to the simple handicrafts of earlier times. Industry has become exceed- 
ingly interesting and worthy. We have no right to exclude it from our education as 
the Greeks did. 
With this conviction firmly implanted in my mind, I propose to point out the 
réle that history may be made to play in the education of boys and girls who are 
being taught to manage machinery and carry on other industrial operations with 
the immediate end of supporting themselves. When I first began teaching history, 
I must admit that I did not see its uses very clearly. This was due largely to the 
fact that I had a very inadequate notion of what the past of mankind really means for 
us. I have gradually come to realize how completely we are dependent upon the 
past for our knowledge and our ideals; how it alone can explain why we are what we 
are; and why we do as we do. 
History, too, is in this sense not fixed and immutable, but ever changing. Each 
age has a perfect right to select from the annals of mankind those facts that seem 
to have a particular bearing on the matters it has at heart. And soit has come about, 
as Maeterlinck has pointed out, that, with increasing insight, historic facts ‘which 
seemed to be graven forever on the stone and bronze of the past will assume an en- 
tirely different aspect, will return to life and leap into movement, bringing vaster 
and more courageous counsels.” 
This is a very important point, and I am anxious to emphasize it before I go on, 
for I have no idea of recommending for industrial schools the particular kind of his- 
tory that commonly goes by that name, since it is not suitable for our purposes. 
Our so-called standard works on history deal at length with kings and popes, with 
courtiers and statesmen, with wars waged for territory or thrones, with laws passed 
by princes and parliaments. But these matters form only a very small part of his- 
tory, for the historian may elect to describe a Roman villa or a primitive steam engine, 
or contrast the theology of Luther with that of St. Thomas Aquinas; he can trace the 
origin of Gothic architecture or of the Egyptian calendar, portray the infatuation of 
Henry VIII for Anne Boleyn, or Bismarck’s attitude toward the socialists, or the 
hatchets of neolithic man. This list of illustrations but feebly suggests the range and 
inexhaustible variety of man’s interests and achievements. Some of these things are 
usually included in our textbooks, some are not. 
What assurance have we that, from the boundless wealth of the past, the most 
important and pertinent experiences of mankind have been sifted out and brought 
into due prominence by those who popularize history and squeeze it into such com- 
pendious forms as they believe best adapted to the instruction of youth? I think 
that we have no such assurance. Voltaire long ago pronounced history to be simply 
-a tale that we have agreed upon—wne fable convenue. 
Until recently the main thread selected was political.’ Almost everything was 
classed under kings’ reigns; and the policy of their governments and the wars in which 
they became involved were the favorite subjects of discussion. Political history is 
the easiest kind of history to write; it lends itself to accurate chronological arrange- 
ment, just because it deals mainly with events rather than conditions. It must, 
moreover, have seemed more important to readers when kings and courts were far 
more conspicuous than they now are, and when fighting was regarded as the one un- 
mistakably genteel pursuit of the leisure classes. 
It is clear that our interests are changing, and consequently the kind of questions 
that we ask the past to answer. But I think that this process of eliminating the old ©
-P-A-G-E-485
HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 475 
and substituting the new might be carried much farther; that our best manuals are 
still crowded with facts that are not worth bringing to the attention of our boys and 
girls and that they still omit in a large measure those things that are best worth tell- 
ing. 
In order to make the situation quite clear, let us imagine that some broad-minded 
and sympathetic spirit, deeply impressed with the tasks that face us today—like 
Maeterlinck himself, for instance—had managed to learn a great deal about the past 
of mankind without ever looking into a standard history or an historical manual 
great or small; that he had been guided miraculously to the real sources of historical 
knowledge and had familiarized himself with all the vestiges of the past thought and 
activities of mankind, not only the written records, but the remains of buildings, 
pictures, clothing, tools, and ornaments. Let us suppose, then, that he undertook 
to prepare a book for children, in which he proposed to tell them what he believed 
would be most interesting to them, and most illuminating, as they grew up and began 
to play their respective parts in social life. Would he dream of including the battle 
of Aegospotami, the Samnite wars, the siege of Numantia by the Romans, the crimes 
of Nero, the Italian campaigns of Frederick Barbarossa, the six wives of Henry VIII, 
or the battles of the Thirty Years’ War? It is tolerably safe to say that none of these 
things, which our manuals always include, would even occur to him as he thought 
over all that man had done and thought and suffered and dreamed through thousands 
of years. 
Our writer, not being especially interested in battles and sieges or the conduct 
of kings, and having no idea of teaching his readers how to be good generals and 
statesmen, would in all probability select some other thread for his narrative than 
the old political one. He might decide that what men knew of the world, or what 
they believed to be their duty, or what they made with their hands, or the nature and } 
style of their buildings, whether private or public, were far more suggestive tousthan / 
their rulers at particular times or the wars that they waged. So in considering the 
place to be assigned to history in industrial education, I have no intention, as“I 
have already said, of advocating what has hitherto commonly passed for an outline 
of history. On the contrary, I suggest that we take up the whole problem afresh, 
freed for the moment from our impressions of “history” vulgarly so-called. 
} j Let us begin by asking ourselves what, considering the needs, capacity, interest, 
- and future career of the boys and girls in industrial schools, is it most necessary for 
ftrem to know of the past in order to be as intelligent, efficient, and happy as possible 
in the life they must lead and the work they must do? In order to answer this ques- 
‘tion intelligently, we must first determine the position in which the pupils are placed, 
and the nature of the demands which their special kind of education imposes. Sec- 
ondly, I propose to give some illustrations of those things in the social memory of 
mankind which are most essential for them to know and recall from time to time, and 
which I venture to think will prove more enlightening than any other information 
/ that can be given them. 
| History alone can explain the machinery which the operative must tend. It 
js the very last link in a chain of marvelous discoveries reaching back hundreds of 
thousands of years to the bits of flint which were among man’s earliest implements 
and which may have started him on his long career of mechanical invention and social 
development. The operative will learn from history how the present division of 
labor, of which he seems to be the helpless victim, has come about; he will perceive 
_its vast social significance and will comprehend the rather hard terms on which things 
get made rapidly, cheaply, and in great quantities. An understanding of this may

476 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
suggest ways in which as he grows older, he can become influential in bettering the 
lot of himself and his fellows without seriously diminishing the output; and conciliate 
economic efficiency with the welfare of the workmen—which is, after all, as important 
a problem as exists in industrial life. 
For example, it seems to an outsider as stupid as it is disastrous that, with the 
simplification of processes through the division of labor, there has not been a counter- 
vailing tendency to enable the workman to carry on in succession a series of contri- 
butions to the completed product. The grinding monotony might be relieved, from 
time to time, by a reasonable alternation of duties so as to bring into play a new set 
of muscles and of mental adjustments. There are, assuredly, a considerable number 
of disadvantages in prevailing practices which a more intelligent, sympathetic, and 
alert set of ry could co-operate in abolishing or alleviating without serious 
economic sacrifice. 
Besides giving the artisan an idea of social progress and its possibilities, history 
will furnish him a background of incidental information which he can utilize in his 
daily surroundings, and which will arouse and foster his imagination by carrying him, 
in thought, far beyond the narrow confines of his factory. It is impossible to do more 
than enumerate a few of the most conspicuous and impressive facts in man’s develop- 
ment, which would arouse the attention of the boys and girls, and might, as the years 
went on, give them an outlook in life that they would get in no other way. We 
might begin with the well-known fact that man is by no means the only artisan in 
our world. Without his tools, he would be unable to compete with the spider, the 
bee, or the wasp. Certain birds construct very elaborate dwellings for themselves 
and their families, but man’s ancestors, to judge from his nearest relatives which 
exist today, could do no more than make a rude platform of boughs. When our 
distant forbears began to walk firmly on their hind legs and thus found their hands 
free, then it was that their good, big brains began to undergo those changes that make 
them so superior to those of the highest apes. In this long process we may assume 
that two factors have been specially potent in developing the peculiarly human heri- 
tage of culture, as distinguished from the instinctive and often marvelous skill of 
other animals: these are language and the invention of tools. 
In the beginning, man was a far more clumsy and inefficient artisan than the wasp; 
but he had the great advantage, if he happened to be particularly clever, of being able, 
not only to do something from time to time that his ancestors had never done, but 
to transmit this improvement to succeeding generations. How the wasp developed 
its skill we do not know; but, as it now is, so it remains—it neither increases nor 
declines, as does human culture, for the simple reason that it does not have to be 
taught to each generation by the last. Could we imagine a child today growing up 
absolutely untaught and unaffected by the example of those around him, he would, 
in all probability, be little superior in point of civilization to a baboon. In short, our 
achievements are not innate,—we owe practically all of them to past generations. 
The accumulation of culture and its transmission by education in the widest sense of 
the word is the chief distinction and duty of our species. A great part of our devel- 
opment, and a great part of the heritage that has been transmitted to us from age 
to age, is associated with our implements. By his tools man can be traced back thru 
hundreds of thousands of years. Indeed, only the stones and bits of flint that he 
modified to his uses survive from the very remote periods. The French anthropol- 
ogists have established a succession of eras in the history of the old stone men, bases 
on the variety and finish of their implements. The history of man, then, begins 
with his industries; and I am not sure that his industries, in a broad sense of the term,
-P-A-G-E-487
  HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 477 
have not always constituted as good a single test of his general civilization and as 
satisfactory a clue to its vicissitudes as can be found. 
After the last advance of the ice sheet in Europe, and perhaps not more than 
seven to ten thousand years ago, the so-called “neolithic” phase of civilization 
clearly emerges, with its ground stone implements, its pottery, agriculture, and do- 
mestic animals. This stage, before the gradual introduction of metals, seems to have 
prevailed generally in both the old world and the new. It lies back of the civiliza- 
tion of Egypt and Babylonia; it was the condition in which the Europeans found the 
peoples of America, four centuries ago; and it may still be studied in various parts of 
the earth where it continues to exist. There should be no difficulty in explaining 
vividly to the child this intermediate grade of civilization,—so complicated from the 
standpoint of the chimpanzee, so simple from the standpoint of that of Greece or 
Rome. 
The recent discoveries in Egypt indicate that some four thousand years before 
Christ a marked advance beyond the neolithic age had already taken place there. 
A rapid and graceful system of writing had been developed, copper was beginning 
to be used for vessels, and, when properly hardened, it became available for tools. 
The ancient Egyptian seems to have been an ever industrious and practical person, 
to whom business made a strong appeal. The bookkeeper is a conspicuous figure 
in the paintings which have come down to us. 
The range of Greek manufactures might also easily be brought into instructive 
relation with both their art and their conceptions of life, in such a way as to give 
a far more adequate notion of this extraordinary people than one is likely to derive 
from the textbooks that tell of their political assemblies and constant wars. We 
still have many examples of their lovely vases and cups and platters, their bracelets, 
earrings, and mirrors. We can form an excellent idea of their furniture as well as 
of their temples and theatres. 
While the Greeks prized beautiful things as no other people before them, so far 
as we know, manual labor was viewed with contempt by the leisure class. This 
could not be otherwise at a time when almost all industrial operations were carried 
on by slaves, a class constantly recruited by captives, and sufficiently large to manu- 
facture all the necessary commodities. Seneca repudiates with warmth the idea 
that the practical arts were invented by men of exceptional genius. He declares 
that, on the contrary, they are vulgar devices of the lowest of humanity, and should 
be left to slaves. Moreover, Aristotle, in his Metaphysics, speaks as if all possible 
practical inventions had long ago been made. So the philosophers and the institu- 
tion of slavery combined in ancient Greece to discredit industry. Thus it came about 
that the use of one’s hands and head in the making of useful articles was condemned 
as degrading; and the more completely one could free himself from such usefulem- 
ployment, the more prospect he had of rising to the full dignity of a man and a philo- 
sopher. 
The Romans took over the Greek industries that suited their purposes, and these 
were transmitted to medieval Europe, with such modifications as change of taste 
and alterations in the general habits of life called for. The growth of the towns in 
the twelfth century was accompanied by interesting developments of craft guilds, 
and the master workmen in the various trades began to play a far more important 
and dignified role in public affairs than ever before. Moreover, the common artisan 
ceased to be a slave, or even a serf, so that one of the gravest disadvantages attach- 
ing to manual labor in Greece and Rome disappeared in western Europe five or six 
centuries ago. The beginning of this rehabilitation of industry is, perhaps, reflected
-P-A-G-E-488
  
  478 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
in the prevalence of surnames derived from homely occupations. The time came 
when no one was ashamed to be called Taylor, Turner, Weaver, Smith, Fuller, Coop- 
er, Brewster, Hooper, Chandler, Fletcher, Potter, Horner, or Currier. 
From the thirteenth century on, there began to be premonitions that industry 
might sometime be revolutionized by new discoveries. A method of smelting iron 
was discovered, for instance, so that it could be cast, instead of forged, after merely 
softening, as previously. The alchemist, in his search for an elixir which would turn 
copper into gold, and lead into silver, and prolong life indefinitely, came upon hitherto 
unsuspected properties in the substances he experimented with and so laid the foun- 
dations for what was becoming applied chemistry. Yet no very striking changes in 
industry occurred before the eighteenth century. In the days of Louis XIV, when 
inventors were already becoming rather common, the people of western Europe still 
continued to spin and weave with very simple devices. Merchandise was still carried 
about on slow carts, and letters were as long getting from London to Rome as in the 
time of Constantine. A 
But two great truths were gradually dawning on the more thoughtful. One was 
the importance of the seemingly homely, common, and inconspicuous things about 
them; the other was the possibility of making use of our knowledge of common things 
to promote the general welfare. Neither the ancient nor the medieval thinkers had 
paid much attention to the material world. They withdrew themselves from nature, 
and, as Lord Bacon said, they ‘‘tumbled up and down in their own reason and con- 
ceits,” and sought the truth in their own little heads and not in the great common 
world about them. When men of first-rate ability turned from a consideration of the 
good, the true, and the beautiful, and of the precise relation of the three members of 
-> the Trinity to one another, and began to wonder what makes milk sour quicker in 
hot weather than in cool, and why an object seen through a glass bottle is magnified, 
they had already made the transition from the old to the new attitude ofmind. 
Patient observation, experimentation, and calculation, in the spirit of modern 
research, did not begin to be carried on in Europe, on a large scale, before the open- 
ing of the seventeenth century; and since that time the progress in accumulating 
knowledge and applying it to the relief of man’s estate has been absolutely without 
precedent in the history of the globe. The story of modern invention and of its re- 
volutionary effect on our life and our ideals of progress cannot be even sketched out 
here. But it is infinitely more absorbing and vital than the record of kings, conquests 
and treaties, and of the deliberations and decrees of public assemblies, which have 
so long been regarded as constituting orthodox history. 
Moreover what child could fail to follow eagerly, if the matter were but clearly 
put to him, the marvelous doings of the steam engine, which has shown itself far 
more potent to alter man’s ways than all the edicts of all the kings and parliaments 
that have ever existed? In 1704, an Englishman, Newcomen, devised an awkward 
form of steam engine, which would work a pump—a lumbering, slow, inefficient, un- 
promising contrivance, which was destined, nevertheless, to grow into the most 
rapidly revolutionizing force in the history of the world. The pump enabled the 
miners to keep under control the water that would otherwise have impeded them in 
extracting both coal and iron. By the use of the iron, new machines could be made, 
and with the coal, they could be run. So, with iron and coal and steam both old and 
new kinds of products could be turned out in unprecedented quantities; and with iron, 
coal and steam they could be dispatched to all parts of the earth. Factories equipped 
with the new machinery grew up, and cities centered around the factories. So it 
has come about that the tool has again come into its own as the agent and symbol of
-P-A-G-E-489
  
  HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 479 
man’s progress, and that the past one hundred and fifty yedts have seen vastly great- 
er changes than the whole five thousand years that elapsed between the reign of 
King Menes I of Egypt and that of George III of England. Just as the use of a stick 
and a piece of flint began the intellectual development which slowly raised man above 
the ape in his habits of life, so a new method of operating his tools—the steam engine— 
ushered in an expansion of his activities, interests, and social and moral problems, the 
end of which is not yet. 
As we are all keenly and sadly aware, the Industrial Revolution, while greatly 
adding to our comforts and to the range of our experiences by bringing the whole 
world together and rendering it in a certain sense accessible to all of us through easy 
and rapid intercommunication, has left the mass of workers whose lives are passed in 
factories in almost a worse plight than that of the Greek and Roman slaves. It was 
evidently too much to expect of our western world that it should effect such an abso- 
lutely unprecedented metamorphosis of the material conditions of life, and at the 
same time guard against all the evils to which the tremendous changes involved 
might give rise. Long hours of monotonous mechanical work in tending a tireless 
machine or in repeating some minute operation in the highly efficient but often in- 
human division of labor on which our modern industrial system rests, together with 
insufficient and precarious wages and demoralizing concomitant, conditions, form at 
present the debit side of the balance sheet. 
As an offset, promising speedy betterment, we have a growing sense of social jus- 
tice, a higher appreciation of economic and social expediency, and an enthusiasm for 
democratic education. The unthinking charity of the Middle Age has become the 
organized social work of today, which is begotten and fostered by a union of human 
sympathy and exacting scientific research. If the machine has produced a new form 
of slavery, it has also produced its antidote. It holds out the possibility of abolishing 
poverty altogether, in the sense of suffering from hunger, cold, and nakedness. For 
there is now energy enough at man’s disposal, in steam and electricity, to supply him 
with the necessities of life in such abundance that, if properly distributed, no one 
need be in physical want. What is still more fundamental, with the Industrial Re- 
volution has come a respect, not to say veneration, for labor, which Aristotle would 
hardly have comprehended. Instead of dreaming of a perfect existence, free from 
all participation in the task of supplying our material needs, Tolstoi and many others 
see the ideal life in a happy combination of useful manual labor and leisure. The 
effect on body, mind, and temper of productive manual work, carried on intelligently, 
under suitable conditions, and for periods adjusted to the strength of the worker and 
to his other duties in life, would unquestionably be most salutary And while we 
have not yet arrived at this happy adjustment, except in rare cases, we at least no 
longer scorn manual labor as such, nor do we deem it inherently degrading. 
Let us return now to the question of the relation of all this to industrial education, 
which is in itself but the latest product of the long historic process which we have been 
tracing. To me it seems obvious that just the sort of facts that we have been review- 
ing are precisely those which we should be particularly anxious that the boys and girls 
in the industrial school be aware of and should lay to heart, in order to gain that atti- 
tude of mind which not only would make them the best kind of artisans, but would 
give them an intelligent appreciation of their work and enable them to co-operate 
in the process of eliminating the evils from which they suffer. And how can these 
facts be so easily, so permanently, and so naturally impressed on the pupil’s mind as 
by the kind of historical study which has been outlined in this brief summary of the 
long story of manual labor? Such study will not only meet the special needs of those

& 
whose « ducation we are issing, but it will furnish at the same time the best, 
perhaps the only, means of cultivating the breadth of view, moral and intellectual 
perspective, and enthusiasm for progress which must always come with a perception 
of the relation of the present to the past. 
I. Aims and Values: What is it that history alone can contri- 
bute to the education of the human being that no other subject 
in the curriculum can? What can it contribute to a greater extent 
than any other subject? Prof. Henry Johnson in The Teaching of 
History [1915] answers these questions: 
History of the scientific type is dominated . . . by the idea of development. 
Krom this point of view, nothing either was or is, everything either was or is in a con- 
tinuous process of becoming. Here then is a conception that renders history not 
only unique but indispensable, and makes clear at once the most fundamental and 
the most comprehensive aim that can be formulated for historical instruction, name- 
ly to make the world intelligible. . . . 
The world to be made intelligible through school instruction in history, is the gener- 
al social and political world. The more special forms of development enter only as 
they affect that world in general. The mode of procedure is obviously to exhibit 
successive societies in action, to convey by means of concrete examples definite im- 
pressions of human beings, living together, making peace, organizing a church, con- 
structing a government, demanding higher wages, obeying or defying social conven- 
tions, seeking amusement—impressions, that is, of what society has been and is, how 
society works, and what the causes and consequences of social action are. Such may 
properly be the controlling aim of historical instruction, for it meets a fundamental 
need and meets it in a way that only historical instruction can meetit. . . . 
In the first place, the facts must be historical and must be recognized by the pupil 
as historical. This implies some consciousness of historical evidence and requires 
the introduction of exercises to develop the consciousness. 
In the second place, differences in peoples, customs, and institutions must be em- 
phasized. History is occupied fundamentally with differences. If the present were 
not different from the past there could be no history. The conception of our own in- 
terests, problems, and standards of judgment as different from those of the past is a 
necessary step toward understanding our own interests, problems and standards. 
In taking this step the mind acquires at the same time the larger vision that should 
dispel provincialism and may affect conduct. 
In the third place, the idea of change must be emphasized. Development is 
change, and a changing social world can be made intelligible only by reference to 
antecedent changes. . . . Yet change is often dimly perceived by those who 
have studied history. The notion that we run, or should run the same course that 
our fathers have run persists in spite of our accumulating evidence to the contrary. 
There are serious statesmen who measure the United States of 1915 by the standards 
of 1789. . . . The immediate effect upon the pupil of feeling that he is living in © 
the midst of progress is to give him a better appreciation of the present and of the 
larger opportunity that awaits him in the future. 
II. The Problem of Grading History: What are the A B C’s 
of history? The matter is not so easy to determine as it seemsto 
be for mathematics or geography. Professor Johnson’s opinion is: 
Particular facts relating to external conditions and activities are plainly the A B 
C’s of history. They are the facts most readily apprehended. They can, without 
 
-P-A-G-E-491
HISTORY—-GRAMMAR GRADES ( 481 
prohibitive strain on the intelligence be so treated as to pelt out from the befinning 
differences in conditions and thus be made tovillustrate the fundamental historical 
idea of change in the world. They can be so selected as to cultivate from the begin- 
ing asense of proportion. . . . It is among the merits of externals of normal life 
in the past—buildings, clothing, food, tools, roads, bridges, conveyances, weapons, 
occupations, amusements—that they are, as a rule sufficiently different from those 
of the present to produce, without over-emphasis upon what is exceptional and ex- 
treme, that effect of picturesqueness which is deemed essential in arousing the in- 
terest of pupils. This makes it possible to look in a serious way for facts that are 
really characteristic of former times and to seek in characteristic facts for the really 
characteristic elements. Even the fundamental historical idea of continuity car 
to some extent be illustrated. All that is necessary is to present action following 
action, to make the story of action a continuous story, to give it a beginning, a middle, 
and an ending, and to apply the same principle to a series of stories. Finally, ex- 
ternal conditions and activities are the key to such mental experiences as are admis- 
sible for beginners. 
If the views here presented are correct, the general distinction between elementary 
history and more advanced history is fairly clear. Elementary history is made up 
essentially of particular facts. It is history presented in the form of concrete ex- 
amples—actual remains, physical representations of actual remains and of actions, 
verbal description rich in material for imagery. Advanced history is history pre- 
sented in the form of general concepts. i 
The problem of adapting history to the ea aoa is, therefore, essentially a prob- 
lem in presentation. Facts presented concretely are elementary; facts presented ab- 
stractly are advanced. For the earlier years of the elementary school, history should 
be made up essentially of concrete examples. It should be descriptive and narrative 
rather than analytical. Generalizations when introduced should be of a kind that 
can be readily resolved into concrete particulars. This does not mean that history 
in the elementary school must be a series of pictures and thathildren should have no 
opportunity to reason, to generalize, and to apply their conclusions. It only means 
that the data for reasoning, for generalization, and for application must be concrete 
data. History thus constructed and thug presented for five and six years will lead 
naturally in the upper grades to history more largely made up of collective or general 
facts. With pupils of ten or eleven, concrete particulars must still be paramount; 
with pupils of seventeen or eighteen, concrete particulars must still be continued, but 
discussion should and may turn largely on generalized history. (The Teaching of 
History, pp. 48-51.) 
III. Some of the Various Aspects of History: 
One of the fundamental problems is what to teach. History is the whole story of 
man in society, and we may study any of its numerous aspects that we wish to in- 
vestigate and work on as long as there is any evidence available from which we can 
learn. The phases of history that have been most studied are the political and the 
military—the story of kings and presidents, statesmen and generals, the rivalries 
and quarrels of states, battles and sieges. But one may also seek to know how men 
have gained their living and increased their comfort, the story of industry and prop- 
erty, the way in which the world’s work has been done; or the story of the classes of 
society, and how it happened that there is a great wage-earning class with special 
problems, working to improve the lot of its members; or what men have thought 
about their place in the world and universe and how they should regard the problems 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
482 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
of life; or how men have at different times sought to train the young and prepare 
them for their serious work in life. One might study the history of fine arts, or of 
costumes, or of amusements, or of cooking. 
The question of what is of most value for the children of the elementary school 
must be determined on the broad basis of the aims of education in general and of the 
study of history in particular. {See section on Aims and Values (pp. 480-481) and 
Professor Robinson’s chapter on History for the Common Man (pp. 473-480)]. For 
any large topic a test to consider is whether it helps to explain anythirtg in the life 
of our own times, not necessarily in a direct way, but whether it helps to show where 
some condition or problem of today comes from and why we have it in the form we do. 
Looking at the matter from this point of view we at once perceive that a history 
course dealing largely or wholly with politics and wars, to the neglect of industrial, 
social, intellectual, and educational history, will fail to offer the least help on many 
of the most important aspects of the world in which we live. Some attention to these 
other phases will be needed if we wish to get from the history work anything like its 
full value. Even if something has to be sacrificed in the matter of romance and the 
picturesque, one cannot be guided simply by the test of what is most entertaining; 
but the fact is that there is much greater opportunity for highly interesting stories, 
_ work appealing to human interests, in social and industrial history, than is commonly 
" supposed by teachers who have made no study of the possibilities. Almost every 
one of the recent textbooks shows the newer tendencies. 
What should be done about the history of wars? This subject is being most severe- 
ly reduced in the readjustments. Opinions differ as to whether the study of the mili- 
tary phase should be actually discouraged, but in planning a course of study the ques- 
tion is one of relative values. How can the available time be used to best advantage? 
With so much of genuine worth that may be done, there can be no question that the 
time that has until recently been devoted to battles and campaigns, especially for 
the Revolution and the Civil War, ought to be greatly reduced. Some suggestions 
are given in the Outlines. In general, a good procedure is to take time for nothing 
more than (1) a study of the geographical setting for the war and the nature of the 
military problems that each side must face, (2) the main outline of the chief campaigns 
bndertaken with the degree of success or failure, (3) the study of one or two typical 
uattles. Of course the cruel, brutal, exhausting, and sordid side of war as well as 
the heroic and romantic should be brought out. 
Care should be taken not to study the various aspects of history as if they had no 
relation to each other. Politics, wars, industry and business, social ideals and cus- 
toms, all influence and help to determine each other.—Gambrill. 
IV. Biographies: Usually teachers go to extremes about the 
use of biographies, overdoing them in Grades 1-6 and almost wholly 
neglecting them in Grades 7-8. An individual is not necessarily 
more concrete than his time, and certainly seeing the life of a peo- 
ple, or a great movement, or a great war through one or even several 
individuals means a rather limited survey. “Biography on the 
whole, can be made more historical by making it more biographical, 
by grouping men about events rather than events about men, and 
by studying men first of all as men.” 
, Personal studies of the leading men of a period is an invaluable 
aid to making that period seem real and vital. particularly to chil-
-P-A-G-E-493
  HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 483 
dren of the seventh and eighth grades who are beginning to be very 
much interested in personalities. One difficulty lies in getting the 
descriptions of characteristics of prominent men and women, and 
of interesting incidents that will bring out characteristics; for this 
greater library facilities are necessary than are found in most schools. 
Standard biographies ought to furnish the necessary data and this 
matter of personal study could well be planned as report work, 
one pupil being responsible for describing one personality; another 
pupil, for a different personality; and so on—the burden of collateral 
reading thus being distributed among the members of the class. 
Seventh and eighth grade pupils might be called upon to assist 
the fourth and fifth grade teachers in this matter; it would be good 
practice for an eighth grade girl or boy to make Benjamin Frank- 
lin “real’’ to a fourth grade child; or General Nathaniel Greene to 
a fifth grade child. [For an interesting chapter on this subject read 
Johnson: The Teaching of History, pp. 161-178.] 
V. Use of the Textbook. In the choice of a basal text for a ~ 
grade, or for a topic, many elements enter. A textbook, no matter 
how carefully selected, can seldom contain all the information 
necessary for any topic; and since textbooks necessarily must be 
written with the universal child [if there be such a person] in mind, 
some irrelevant information is often included for the child of the 
immediate locality. What is to be done? The only plan to fol- 
low is to discard parts of the text, if they are not needed, and sup- 
plement the work with collateral reading. With one well selected 
basal text for the grade, with library facilities in the school-building 
that supply books for collateral reading and report work, with aid 
from the public libraries, the Sunday School libraries [if they can 
give any], and the libraries in the homes of the pupils, with current 
magazines and newspapers—the teacher will carry on her work. 
How to use the text-book is determined by an understanding of 
teaching children how to study. 
FACTORS IN TEACHING “How TO STUDY” 
Note: This topic applies to geography as well as history; in- 
deed, to all the subjects in which study assignments are made and 
discussed. 
1. Mechanics that aid in the use of text-books. 
An understanding and intelligent use of title-page, preface, index, table of 
contents, and appendix of a book. 
2. Factors in study: 
a. Clear statement of problem or assignment: . 
The type of assignment is a determinating factor for study at home or in 
school.
-P-A-G-E-494
  
484 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
b. Problems should arise in any lesson that cannot then be solved—these 
should be assigned immediately for study: 
Culmination of a lesson ought to mean a summary of what has been stated, 
but also a formulation of the questions yet_unsolved. Many of these should 
have been raised by the class 
c. Individual or group assighments for repeat work. 
d. Recalling the problem many times in the course of the recitation to test 
whether progress of the lesson shows continuity and unity. 
e. Doubting or challenging, not accepting the thinking of others; search for truth 
f. Verifying: 
Using other texts, dictionaries, encyclopedia, gazetteers, year-books. 
g. Noting the books that give information: 
Bibliographies. 
h. Taking notes, annotations, outlines. 
i. The child should be made conscious of the need of discrimination. 
Not all of any book is needed. 
j. Understand that a definite answer cannot be given to all questions. 
k. Memorize thought. 
[1] understanding [thinking it over]; [2] analyzing into the principal thought 
units; [3] seeing the whole as a richer thing, in relation to its parts and to other 
like or unlike wholes. 
1. Habit for questioning to be set up. 
[1] carefulness about details; [2] critical judgment, [3] ability to ask thought- 
ful and challenging questions; [4] the desire to use only reliable texts; [5] the 
right system of taking notes and making outlines; etc. 
Supervised Study Assignments and Independent Study Assign- 
ments: Inone history lesson-movement, covering a period of, say, 
five lessons in the seventh grade, based upon a problem-topic, 
the teacher’s study assignments should serve as a basis for a later 
analysis with her pupils about their methods of study. In the study- 
periods the pupil must look up references, evaluate facts, confront 
new problems that arise, note his own misconceptions, consult 
bibliographies for concrete source-materials, and arrange his data 
to be brought to class for discussion. Almost every history lesson 
thus becomes a directed or supervised study lesson. 
Now, when an independent history study lesson is assigned to test 
habits of study that have been gained by the class from the rich 
suggestions for developing study ideas that have been worked out 
between pupil and teacher together, the pupil will make his selec- 
tion, and study accordingly. For example, suppose a class in the 
seventh grade is assigned to study independently the First Con- 
tinental Congress, with these directions: 
1. How shall this lesson be conducted when we take it up in the class room? 
2. Find information-materials and bring them to class when you are ready for 
the discussion. j 
3. Note all points you do not understand, and be ready to ask any questions 
that you think are pertinent to the topic.
-P-A-G-E-495
  
  HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 485 
Might not the mental process the child will go through, when he 
is left to himself, be something like this?— 
“This is a congress, called together for the purpose of discussing the Boston Port 
Bill, and other Intolerable Acts imposed upon the Americans by the British Parlia- 
ment. We can learn more from a dramatization of this Congress than in any 
other way. Such a plan will help us to remember the leading men who were 
present; we will have to look up their biographies, in order to see if we can find 
any special speeches they made. We will have to find whether our own text gives 
much information. We ought to have the document that grew out of this Congress. 
We ought to have the minutes of the Congress, if we can get them. This is the 
way we studied the Albany Congress and we had a most interesting time with it. 
I think no better way can be found for such congresses than to dramatize them.’ 
Now, what happened when the child, studying independently, 
thought this out for himself? He really was imitating a method of 
study procedure that the teacher had disclosed to him from a 
previous history project. 
All through the elementary school, study-lessons should be di- 
rected as seat-work preparations for recitation lessons. Indeed, 
most of the recitation lessons should be supervised study lessons. 
VI. Reference Books: Collateral Reading. The matter of 
interesting and vital reference works to supplement a text, is a very 
important factor in the teaching of history. Another, quite as 
vital, is the use of these interesting books after they are selected. 
Children at least as early as the fifth grade may be taught to use 
the table of contents and index, and to follow the footnotes. 
Reports on assigned topics or problems can then be made by groups 
of children, some using one reference, some another. 
Henry Johnson, in The Problem of Adapting History to Children 
in the Elementary School, says: ‘Doubts may, with profit, occasion- 
ally be raised in the minds of children as to the unerring accuracy of 
books 4 There are doubts. What shall be 
done ith. them? Shall they be ignored? Shall they be covered 
by the dogmatism of the author? Suppose the assurance is in the 
writer and not in the knowledge, that what he writes is history only in 
the sense of his story, with the emphasis upon the fis. Is it wholly 
beyond the province of elementary instruction to take any account 
of what histories are made, of what is involved in reading them 
intelligently?” 
Let us set up a reasonable amount of doubt then in our own 
minds as well as in those of our pupils. The definitive word has 
seldom been said about an event in history. It is much better to 
hear in class discussions some such remarks made by the pupils as 
“Well, Fiske says this,’”’ or ‘“Parkman says that,” than it is to have  
-P-A-G-E-496
  
  486 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
the pupils submit to one point of view because no other point of 
«view has been afforded them. 
’ VII. The Idea of Place and Distance. Distance or spacial 
apprehension develops much earlier than the perception of time. 
It is brought out “by the force of circumstances which requires the 
child to find his way about his environment. Only those distances 
which we have actually traversed are properly understood by us; 
of others which we have not experienced we can hardly have an 
adequate idea. ‘ : The comprehension of perspec- 
tive representation is, as a rule, but moderately developed in six- 
year children. When children are required to interpret pictures 
spacially they frequently assign quite the reverse meanings to the 
spacial relations.” [Rusk: Introduction to Experimental Education, 
[Longmans] pp. 64-65.] 
“ Down town,’ ‘across the river,’ ‘up the road,’ have a meaning. 
Five hundred miles away often has not. Often all distances of more 
than a few miles are alike only ‘a long way off.’ But children learn 
comparatively early to read maps, and, if accustomed from the first 
to visualize the material background of history, are in a position by 
. the age of ten or eleven to deal with the place relation as they deal 
with the time relation.”—Johnson. 
VIII. Maps. See that the developing child gets the map habit. 
Geography and history should go hand in hand. One feels like 
going so far as to say that seldom should there be a history lesson 
in which geographical conditions play an important part without 
a wall map, an outline wall map, and a pupil’s outline desk map. 
Physical maps should be used throughout the study of a topic in 
which the physical environment is known to have affected the life 
of the people. The Sydow-Habenicht physical maps now in use 
in our schools are unusually clear, attractive and illuminating 
for history purposes. The McKinley Publishing Company of 
Philadelphia furnishes outline wall-maps for 18 cents in quantities, 
and desk outline-maps for 32 cents, 45 cents, and 77 cents per hun- 
dred according to size. The United States Geological Survey pub- 
lishes quadrangle maps of small areas that can be purchased at 10 
cents each. 
A word should be said about the use of contemporary maps; they 
are at times absolutely necessary for the understanding of the situ- 
ations involved in boundaries and treaties. 
There is a place in history for the quick sketch-map drawn from 
memory. It is a “test of control” of certain phases of knowledge 
involving particularly the place relations so necessary to an under- 
standing of history.  
-P-A-G-E-497
HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 487 
W. R. Shepherd’s Historical Atlas covers the whole range of his- 
tory from the ancient Orient to the Panama Canal, and is almost, 
indispensable for classroom use. (Out of print until after the present 
European War is over.) It contains over two hundred maps in 
color, which are exceptionally accurate and attractive (Henry Holt 
& Co.; $2.50 net). Other atlases are MacCoun: An Historical Ge- 
ography of the United States (Silver, Burdett & Co., 90 cents); Dow: 
Atlas of European History (Holt); Everyman’s Atlas (5 vols., 35 
cents each, Dutton). A copy of the Foster ‘‘Historical Chart” has 
veen placed in many of our schools as a part of the history teach- 
ing equipment. The grades—four to eight—should be using it 
whenever it meets their needs. 
IX. Time-perception. Time perception develops much later 
than the spacial or place apprehension. “One hundred years ago 
cannot mean anything to the small child, indeed we are told that 
children of eight years cannot go beyond six months, everything 
before that seeming to be simply in the past. We may say that he 
can distinguish the relative position of near events, but distant 
events appear all in the same place, this plane receding with in- 
creasing experience.’’—Rusk. “ 
Use the child’s own life as a unit to get back of. The time ane 
knotted at regular intervals, slips of paper, the line on the board 
or the time block, are devices that may be used to good advantage 
not only in the lower, but also in the upper grades. “By the age of 
ten or eleven, even children have counted enough days and exper- 
iences to realize the difference between the long ago to Washington 
and the long ago to Pericles sufficiently to justify the use of dates.” 
—Johnson. 
X. Dates. There has been a reaction against the memorizing 
of numerous dates, but we may easily swing too far to the other 
side. Let us distinguish between use and memorizing. A great 
number of dates may be put on the blackboard or otherwise used 
without any attempt to memorize them. Dating an event should 
be happening continually, not necessarily in exact figures, but by 
approximation and in relation to other events in point of time; for 
instance—‘“‘the discovery of America, 1492, marks approximately 
the close of the 15th century;” ‘Columbus was about nine years old 
when Prince Henry of Portugal died [1460];” “Clay, Calhoun, and 
Webster were born within four years of each other and all died about 
the same time [1850-1852].” A few exact significant dates should 
be known at the close of each year’s study.

XI. “How we Know” the Facts of History. “A first grade 
can be led to see that something is learned about the Indians from 
things dug up out of the ground, something from writings of white 
men who reported what they saw, and something from stories told 
by Indians about themselves and later reported. by white men. 
First grade children will themselves often suggest that the Indians 
_ did not write books. A fourth grade can be led to think of different 
ways of knowing about people, and the relative merits of the differ- 
ent ways of knowing about them. A sixth grade can be taught 
the use of indexes and tables of contents and something of the sig- 
nificance of references to authorities. A seventh grade can be led 
to solve some simple problems in criticism. From the first, there 
can be exercises involving essential aspects of the historical method 
of study from the research for material to the organization and ex-. 
position of results.”—Johnson: The Teaching of History, p. 360. 
XII. Correlation with Other Subjects. 
1. Geography: Correlation here does not mean that history is to be 
determined by the other courses in the curriculum, nor the other 
courses determined by the history. History is taught as history; the 
geography that illumines history is the whole body of geographical 
knowledge that is taught through the geography topics; and when 
a special phase of it is needed for a history lesson, such as reading a 
physical map or tracing out the lack of development of a people 
because of its physical surroundings—the geography study then 
becomes a matter of an aid to history and is taken up as a part of 
the progress of the lesson-movement of the history proper. So it 
is with English and literature, and the other subjects that history 
must call upon for help. 
2. English: In the English periods the following devices might be 
used to reinforce the history work: keeping of journals or diaries; 
writing letters, the pupils imagining themselves in certain historic 
situations, for instance in Washington’s Army at Valley Forge, or 
with Jefferson Davis at Columbia, South Carolina, after the fall of 
Fort Sumter; memorizing famous speeches; taking part in debates; 
dramatizing with historical accuracy, some of the most important 
of the world’s events. A dramatization, well worked out, means 
hard work for the teacher. She must carefully select leaders, and 
provide more material for collateral reading than the ordinary 
school library affords if the details of the play are to be critically 
accurate. 
3. Civics. Ideas of political parties, government, the constitu- 
tion of the United States and its amendments, should be developed
-P-A-G-E-499
HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 489 
as the national history is studied, and reviewed and applied to cur- 
rent situations in the civics periods. And, always, if possible, con- 
crete evidences of civic problems immediately touching the life of 
the child should be made the point of departure for the work. 
4. Industrial Arts [See Industrial Arts Course, pp. 639-671]. 
XIII. Further Aids. : 
1. Construction work: ‘Set free the constructive activities of the 
children and encourage them to reproduce as many of the objects 
of interest in the story as they can find tools and materials to shape; 
the building of the miniature forts, log huts, palisaded enclosures, 
caves, breastworks, canoes, boats, ships, costumes of explorers, 
scenes of Indian life, and other characteristic things.’”’—McMurry. 
2. Source materials: In contemporary diaries, letters, personal 
reminiscences, newspaper cartoons, and songs, the teacher will find 
a most useful fund of particulars about personalities and life of thé 
time. The use of such source materials, however, demands some 
critical ability on the part of the teacher and some trouble to cull 
out parts the pupils can read with ease and profit. For helpful 
suggestions about the kinds and use of sources see Johnson, The 
Teaching of History, pp. 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 196, 126, 371. 4 
3. Local traditions and stories: Every neighborhood has a fund of 
traditions and stories about its immediate history. These should be 
used if possible, and wherever men and women are still living in 
the neighborhood who havestaken part in a significant event, they 
should if possible, be asked to contribute to the history work of the 
school by speaking at the school assembly or by personal interview 
with the teacher and pupils. 
4. Excursions: Probably no aid is so valuable and at the same time 
so little used in America as the history excursion. , Occasionally 
we undertake a trip with the class to historic Annapolis, or to 
Washington, when Congress is in session; but this is usually done 
as a special reward to members of a seventh or eighth grade class, 
and seldom as a definitely expected and planned-for unit of work 
when the course for the year is being mapped out. Excursions can 
be of many kinds—to a monument just a block away from the school, 
a matter of a half hour or so of time; to a more distant point that 
might take the entire day with several days of study and preparation 
previous to the trip; to a more distant place, covering a larger 
period of time, even several days. Such excursions are seldom 
planned for the elementary school because of the difficulty involved 
in their management, and we usually think of such an excursion as 
belonging to the secondary school or the college field; but it is not
-P-A-G-E-500
  490 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
beyond possibility that history excursions will become in the future 
a more important part of our planned procedures. 
5. Concrete details: Just what is a concrete detail? It is a par- 
ticular, single thing whether it be an idea or an object; and should 
be clearly differentiated from a generalization which sounds gghcrete 
but is not. Professor Johnson points out that a “King’’ may be 
anything but concrete to a child, and he warns us to analyze what 
such generalizations as “‘slave power in America,” “ringing with 
applause,’ ‘“‘Cotton is King,” really mean to us. A picture of 
Washington’s camp-chest with a minute description of its contents; 
John Hancock’s every day coat of handsome scarlet velvet with 
ruffles on the sleeves stands out clearly when it is associated even 
with a Perry print of John Hancock himself; Washington’s war 
horse ‘Nelson, a tall old sorrel with white face and legs,” grazing 
luxuriously in the richest grass and clover Mount Vernon could 
afford, and upon whose back the ‘‘Commander-in-Chief of the Ameri- 
can armies had received the surrender of Lord Cornwallis;” a letter 
from Jefferson Davis to Governor Pickens of South Carolina de- 
scribing his difficulties about securing men and ammunition fol- 
lowing the fall of Fort Sumter; the accurate reading of a physical 
map with some definite problem like ‘‘Cotton is King” in mind; 
a vivid word picture of a man’s personal characteristics, or a battle- 
field, or a speech; a real situation—these are samples of concrete 
details without which history may be as meaningless to a child as 
abstract science is. 
6. Placing memorial tablets upon historic spots and buildings in 
the neighborhood: The hunting out of an historic spot in the neigh- 
borhood and placing a memorial tablet or sign upon it could be 
made a great event in the life of the school. There is no neighbor- 
hood, no matter how apparently uninteresting, that has not a past 
history as vital as that of any well-known and sacred spot in the 
country. Not very long ago it was suggested to the principal of 
a school in a rural community that his pupils might work out the 
historical development of that section. In despair he said ‘There 
is nothing of historical interest here.” A patron standing near 
replied “Our church is the second oldest Presbyterian church in 
the United States.” The patron gave the keynote of interest and 
a task could have been marked out right there to verify the informa- 
tion (an example of a concrete lesson in historical evidence), to 
secure the co-operation of the vestry of the church in going over the 
records, to secure permission to put a tablet upon the church (the 
tablet to be designed in the fine arts period and made in the manual
-P-A-G-E-501
  
~ HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 491 
training shop), and to plan for a day of celebration when the tablet 
was ready for unveiling which might indeed be the occasion for an 
historical revival for the whole neighborhood. Where the school 
cannot manage such projects alone it could, at least, start the 
movertent which might then be left to women’s clubs, civic associa- 
tions, and farmer’s granges to consummate. 
7. Pictures, Casts, Models, Museums: Encourage the collection 
of pictures, for pictorial representations aid the imagination to 
reconstruct the past as no other medium can. But it is not enough 
just to make a collection of any and all sorts of pictures, they must 
be accurate just as sources and historical evidence must be; and 
besides they must be used thoughtfully and intelligently. It is 
even conceivable that several days might be spent upon the study 
of the same pictures, for pictures may be as much the source of 
information as the printed page. The pictorial illustrations in the 
text-book should be made use of if they have any direct connection 
with the text; too frequently the text fails us here. 
Models are more easily interpreted than pictures, but to produce 
the best results they must be of proper size and of accurate pro- 
portion. Prof. Johnson in The Teaching of History, pp. 202-268, de- 
votes two chapters to the discussion of pictures, models, charts, 
museums, and maps. He says among other things that such 
materials as casts, models, pictures, charts, and maps can be arranged 
in a museum in kstorical order. This is shown in museums in 
Munich and Stocholm. In Stockholm, Sweden, the collection is 
very complete and because of it standards are historically altered. 
There is also an outdoor museum in Stockholm that represents a 
miniature Sweden by districts and periods; houses, furniture, books, 
costumes, crops, birds, animals, etc. 
In America the historical museum at Doylestown, Pennsylvania, 
is perhaps the most interesting. It collects materials showing the 
historical development of such things as transportation, lights, etc. 
In some respects it rivals Stockholm, though its scope is narrower. 
Something is being done with this idea in the National Museum at 
Washington. 
Use the Stereoscope; those of Underwood and Underwood are 
the best, on the whole. There are books to accompany the pic- 
tures, with maps. 
The reflectoscopes and radiopticons of the Thompson Company 
are a good kind [Thompson Co., Madison Ave., and 23rd Street, 
New York.]; and the Buckeye Radiopticon, for postcards primarily, 
is a good machine for the purpose at $5.00.

The Hensell models [26 pieces] illustrate Greek and Roman His- 
tory; the Gall and Rebhann models also illustrate ancient history; 
the Rausch models [more than 200 pieces] most of them illustrating 
general European history as well as German history, are all recom- 
mended. They are described in a catalogue [50 cts.] obtainable 
from the Stechert Company, New York City. 
8. Moving pictures and Phonographs: Add to all the foregoing 
aids the possibilities of the moving picture machine, and the phono- 
graph for “canning history” and we have a prospect for “making 
the past real’ that is not beyond our fondest dreams. 
XIV. Reviews and Examinations. In all reviews [the right 
kind of examination is really a review], the emphasis should be 
placed upon the relative significance of events, not upon pure memor- 
iter facts. A representative person who appears in several signi- 
ficant events will be reviewed by each event and seen in a new 
light in relation to the event; an event that has significances of 
several different kinds is reviewed each time it comes up and a new 
significance is added to it. Ex. The story of ‘The coming of the 
factory to America’’ will bring out several inventors; it will also 
_ need to be recalled in discussing the “Labor Movement,” and in 
dealing with legislation about wages and workers. 
In examinations, it is the use of historical knowledge that should 
be put to the test, if the examination is to be at all significant. An 
examination in geography given by qne of our County principals 
about two years ago [1913] will illustrate the point: 
Children of an eighth grade were asked to open their geographies 
to the graphs on a certain page; select a graph that had not been 
studied in class; organize a problem from it; draw a map illustrating 
the conditions of the problem; formulate an outline of topics for 
discussion that the problem demanded before it could be solved; 
and give a short list of reference books from their classroom exper- 
ience that might be useful in solving the problem. Certainly such 
an assignment forms a basis for a most intelligent use of knowledge. 
Of the history examination, Professor Johnson says: 
“The memory test should not be allowed to dominate the history 
- examination. It is, indeed, doubtful if more than a fourth, or per- 
haps a third, of the examination should be devoted to tests of ability 
to remember. The remainder of the paper could then be devoted to 
tests of ability to do; to interpret a map or picture; to analyze a 
paragraph or a page of history; to find materials on a given topic; 
to solve by use of given materials a simple problem in criticism; 
to recognize in given facts differing degrees of probability; to judge 
 
-P-A-G-E-503
    
HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 493 
from a given description some historical character; to discover in 
given conditions, past and present, resemblances, differences, re- 
lations, tendencies; to organize a given collection of facts; to 
select from the work of a term or a year, facts of special importance 
and to explain why they are important.” 
XV. The Celebration of Holidays. No mention is made in . 
the outlines for the various grades of the celebration of holidays. 
One plan for the holidays should be followed in all the grammar 
grades. Too often the celebration of a holiday is made the oc- 
casion to break the continuity of the history program by introducing 
history pertaining to the holiday in question, which is studied for 
several weeks, or perhaps the entire month, before the holiday 
celebration. A general hodge-podge is often the result. Take, as 
an example, the Sixth Grade course—imagine a month of Colonial 
history in preparation for the Thanksgiving celebration, a month of 
study of Christmas customs just anywhere and everywhere, a month 
of study of the life of Washington for February 22, a month of study 
of Easter customs, a month of study of the Civil War for Decora- 
tion Day—all interposed between the European topics outlined for 
the grade. One can picture the result; certainly there would be 
nothing left of continuity. Might not a better plan be to draw 
from the history course itself a contribution to the holiday, if pos- 
sible? Take the Sixth Grade again as an example—at Thanks- 
giving, the Sixth Grade is probably in the midst of the study of 
Rome; then a play based upon “how the Romans gave thanks to 
their gods” would certainly review and reinforce the historical 
knowledge of Rome already accumulated, and at the same time 
bring out the idea of an ancient Thanksgiving celebration, that 
will serve as a contrast to a Colonial Thanksgiving which is a legit- 
imate part of the Seventh Grade work in its study of the American 
Colonial period. If the Sixth Grade happens to be studying the 
Middle Ages by the time Christmas has arrived it might well con- 
centrate upon the early celebrations of the new Christian nations, 
or of our own American customs directly traceable to the early 
Germans. When it comes to the celebration of Washington’s 
birthday, to which the grade history as attended contributes noth-. 
ing, the work for this special day might be taken care of by 
either the literature, English composition or fine arts courses; if 
literature, it may be to trace out ‘‘Washington in literature” finding 
what the authors of his own time wrote about him, or how the later 
American writers regard him; if English composition, it may be the 
writing of an original verse about Washington; if fine arts, it may
-P-A-G-E-504
494 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
be the printing of a poster announcing a “Washington program” 
to be given by the fifth or the seventh grades since these two 
grades are right in the study of the historical background of Wash- 
ington’s life. 
Thus the history course determines the character of the celebra- 
tion, the holiday drawing from the history course and reinforcing it. 
XVI. The History of Maryland in our Schools. In the third 
grade which takes up environment studies, the history is arranged 
as follows: (1) the school community; (2) the county as a whole; 
(3) the state; (4) the nation. By this plan some concrete stories of 
Maryland’s development are studied in the Third Grade; the Fourth 
Grade gets a picture of colonial Maryland; the Fifth, of Maryland 
in the Revolution with some stories of typical incidents and of 
people of the State who have contributed to national thought and 
feeling; the Sixth, studies nothing of Maryland history, but takes 
up a detailed study of Maryland geography which gives the physical 
setting for Maryland’s industries and commerce; the Seventh, 
studies in an intensive way Maryland’s part in Colonial life, in the 
Revolution, in the “Critical Period,” and in the War of 1812, par- 
alleling the history of the State with the Nation’s development; 
the Eighth continues this plan and brings the history down to date. 
For the Third, Fourth and Fifth grades, a set of Passano, Mary- 
land, Stories From Her History, has been placed in each building, 
and for the seventh and eighth grades a set of Gambrill, Leading 
Events of Maryland History. Selected pages or passages of Gam- 
brill might well be read by the Fifth Grade child. 
XVII. Where to Get Information: Bibliographical Aids. 
Even the most learned specialist must make extensive use of books 
that tell him where to obtain information about subjects he may 
be studying. Such aids are indispensable tools for the teacher 
who makes any pretence of careful preparation, certainly for the 
busy teacher of the elementary school who has not been especially 
trained in history and who has to prepare work in other subjects 
as well. Ordinarily the teacher in the grades will want a selective 
list and if possible one that critically describes the books mentioned: 
at other times, in connection with some intensive study or for the 
preparation of a dramatic exercise, more extended lists may be 
needed. The following list will indicate some of the more import- 
ant and useful works; what the teacher uses must depend in large 
measure ‘upon what is accessible as well as upon what might be 
most useful in a given case. Always note carefully the publication

For the wide range of topics covered by the course for the Sixth Grade material 
will be found in several of the books in the foregoing list as will appear from the 
annotations. For others see the special reference lists for the grade. 
Periodicals: The American Historical Review is edited by a committee of distinguished 
scholars representing the American Historical Association; published quarterly, 
it provides critical reviews of the newest books in the field of history. The 
History Teachers Magazineappearing monthly, prints classified lists of new books, 
and brief reviews. Various standard magazines devoted to more general fields 
(e.g., the Review of Reviews, the Literary Digest, the Independent, the Out- 
look, the Book Review of the Sunday edition of the New York Times) give book 
notes of value.

XVIII. Plan of the Course of Study. The old course of study 
has seemed open to objection on the ground that it violates the 
principle of continuity or orderly evolution, in some cases failing 
to make a well-connected story within a grade and in others be- 
tween the grades. The experience of the teachers pointed the way 
to other possible improvements, and the work of several years in 
the Institute under Prof. J. M. Gambrill has aided in the plan for 
a critical and constructive revision. A practical difficulty in carry- 
ing out the old course arose from the lack of suitable textbooks for 
some grades where the selection of topics was unusual. 
It has been decided, after consulting with specialists, that under 
all the circumstances it is wiser to make the Report of the Com- 
mittee of Eight of the American Historical Association the basis 
of the present course. The following estimate is quoted or sum- 
marized from the only comprehensive appraisal that has been 
published; it appeared in full in the History Teacher’s Magazine 
for February, 1912, and is the report of an address at the meeting 
of the American Historical Association at Buffalo in December, 1911, 
by Prof. J. Montgomery Gambrill of the department of history, 
Teachers College, Columbia University. 
SHALL THE COURSE OF STUDY RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE 
OF EIGHT BE ADOPTED IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS? 
“The material of the course may readily be grouped into three units: (1) Primary 
work, for grades one to three, devoted to anniversaries, Indian life, and sixteen 
“heroes of other times;’ (2) Intermediate work, grades four and five, devoted to 
“historical scenes and persons in American history;” (3) Grammar-grade work, 
grades six to eight, devoted to American history preceded by ‘those features of an- 
cient and medieval life which explain important elements of our civilization, or which 
show how the movement for discovery and colonization originated,’ and accompanied 
by some attention to contemporary Europe. The Committee was very much alert 
to the danger of anything ‘ideal’ or ‘visionary.’ . In fact, the one feature 
of the course which, eons by itself, can be called radical, is the material out- 
lined for the sixth grade. 
“We can best appraise the Committee’s work by considering the three units in 
inverse order. The plan of focusing the course around American history is funda- 
mentally sound. Many of the aims of history teaching can be realized from almost 
any phase or period of the subject; but the great central aim of our history teaching 
is now recognized as social, the developing of an understanding of the organized 
society of which the pupil is a part, and the ability and disposition to perform in- 
telligently and honestly his duties as a citizen. For this reason the history work of 
pupils of every country should culminate in the history of their own nation. But 
the conception of national history must never be narrow, lest it result in the fostering 
of the provincial narrowness and vicious chauvinism which have been all too common 
in our own country. This principle applies with special force to American history, 
since its institutions in their origin are European, and the roots of our civilization are 
in other lands. The Committee has explicitly recognized the necessity for making 
American history the crowning feature of the work, and for using that term in a very 
broad and liberal sense. While reserving the right to differ on points of detail, we 
may say, therefore, that this feature of the Committee’s work is deserving of very high 
aise. 
“The material prescribed for the intermediate grades cannot be so readily approv- 
ed. In devoting the entire fourth and fifth years to stories from American history,
-P-A-G-E-507
  
HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 497 
the Committee flagrantly violates its own principle, repeated and emphasized (pp. 
xiii and 125) that each topic should be presented but once, ‘fully and finally.’ With- 
out subscribing fully to this principle, one may easily disagree as to the advisability 
of devoting these two years to American history. Children of this age may be keen- 
ly interested in Greek, Roman, and medieval stories that give some conception of 
these civilizations and make familiar some of the great names in their history. These 
subjects might well lead up to a simple view of the more romantic aspects of the period 
of discovery and colonization in America. Time might thus be gained in the sixth 
grade for a more detailed and intensive study of Europe during the period of explora- 
tion and discovery in America, and thereby bring the entire colonial period within 
the sixth grade, giving time for more extended study to the later periods of American 
history and to important European topics. This sort of work has been successfully 
tested in various schools. . . . 
{But the Committee also had to consider! “the practicability of getting the course 
adopted by school authorities and efficiently carried out under existing school con- 
ditions. . . . Large numbers of pupils leave school every year, notwithstand- 
ing our compulsory laws; the figures regarding this elimination differ materially, but 
it 1s conservative to say that only one-third of those entering survive for the high 
school, and only one-tenth complete its work. Mr. Leonard Ayres, who has made 
wide investigations in this field, states that the general tendency is toward keeping 
Deane all the pupils to the end of the fifth year, and one-half to the end of the 
eighth 20. 3 
“There is no such thing as a standard course of study for elementary schools, 
either in theory or in practice, not even an arbitrary one, such as the college entrance 
requirements for the high school. 
“The Committee may easily and properly have been influenced by all these 
factors in the case. In regard to the intermediate work, for example, they may 
have felt that it is of great importance for the children leaving school at the end of 
the fifth or sixth grade to have made at least a slight study of the history of their 
own country. Whether they believed this or not, they may have realized that a 
large number of superintendents would entertain such an opinion. They may have 
felt that a course superior from an educational point of view would present too many 
and too great difficulties for the main body of teachers as they are. They may have 
felt that it would be hopeless to expect superintendents and boards of education 
to adopt a course which on the whole represented too wide a departure from the com- 
mon. Some of us may disagree with them on these points, we may feel that they have 
been too conservative, but at least we can understand their problem and respect 
their deliberately formed judgment. . . 
~ “Admitting, then, all that may legitimately or reasonably be said against the 
Committee’s course, there would still be no sufficient reason for withholding our 
indorsement. If the Committee’s work was so palpably bad that a very large 
percentage of competent judges disapproved its essential features the case would be 
different; but no such contention can be maintained, and if we wait for a general 
agreement on all the details of a course, the assistance we desire to give the element- 
ary schools will never be rendered. Almost everybody admits that the Committee’s 
course possesses many sterling merits. It presents for the first time in this country, 
a complete and co-ordinated course of study in history for the elementary schools, 
and is the product of four years of intelligent and presumably painstaking study 
by a committee of eight competent scholars and educators. There is no obligation 
upon anyone who accepts the essential ideas of the course to follow the exact selec- 
tion of topics and organization of material prescribed by the Committee. (Such is 
the Committee’s own statement.) Let these be improved upon wherever teachers 
and supervisors are competent to improve upon them. After ten or twelve years of 
experience we can have a careful and thorough revision of the Report of the Com- 
mittee of Eight, just as we have had of the Report of the Committee of Seven. In 
the meantime, here is a standard for the great body of elementary schools to follow. 
“Shall we miss the opportunity that is presented merely because we do not agree 
that the Committee of Eight course is wholly satisfactory? With the utter lack of 
any accepted standards or uniformity of practice, with the great body of teachers 
untrained for this special field, with the supervisory officials unprepared to grapple 
with the problem, would it not be folly to neglect the opportunity to supply authorita-  
-P-A-G-E-508
    
498 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
tively what is needed? Let us by all means bend every effort to secure the wide adop- 
tion of the course and to convince superintendents that this much history work at 
least paola be offered, and can be offered, under present conditions in the element- 
ary schools.”” 
It must be emphasized however that we have not adopted in 
toto the course outlined by the Committee of Eight; we have simply 
made it the basis for distributing the work through the grades. 
In the grammar grades the principal change occurs in the last two 
years: the Committee of Eight makes the dividing point between 
the Seventh and Eighth Grades the year 1783 in American history; 
we make it approximately 1820. The advantages of the modifica- 
tion are that we thus get in the Seventh Grade the whole story of 
‘the planting, independence, and firm establishment of an American 
nation; we leave more time in the Eighth for the fuller study of 
the recent history, conforming to a strong tendency of the time; 
and we provide for those pupils who, under the plan of grading in 
Maryland counties, do not take the Eighth Grade work, but enter 
the High School at the end of the Seventh Grade, a course which 
at least introduces them to some of the important tendencies and 
problems in the history of their country. The teacher should care- 
fully examine the divisions of the whole course, including that for 
primary grades, and compare with the Report of the Committee 
of Eight [Scribner, 50 cents]; such a comparison will disclose the 
particulars in which the latter has been modified for use in Baltimore 
county. Let the teacher work critically with this course, so that 
her studies and classroom experience may form the basis for the 
revision of the future. 
Very properly the Committee of Eight declares that it does not 
expect rigid adherence to detail in carrying out its course. Much of 
the Committee’s work is not well organized to show relations and 
interpret events, and in this respect, particularly, there is oppor- 
tunity for the makers of courses of study and textbooks to contribute 
improvements that may be of service for a future revision. In pre- 
paring the County course, we have used the broad outlines of the 
Committee of Eight and made a fresh arrangement of material 
within the larger divisions. 
XIX. The Topical Outlines. The topical outlines for the grades 
are primarily for the teacher. An outline for students should not 
give summaries of information, generalized conclusions, and ex- 
planations of events; for such material the pupil should make his 
own outlines, after the necessary study and class exercises. If 
outlines are furnished to the student by the teacher, they should 
simply indicate the broader organization and set the problems of 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
  HISTORY—GRAMMAR GRADES 499 
the work, the student supplying the rest. A statement of cause 
or effect, a good generalization, can be memorized as mechanically 
as a date or a name, and the result is even more nearly useless. 
For the character of the outline for the Fifth Grade, see special note 
at the beginning of the outline. 
The outlines are intended especially to provide a topical organiza- 
tion of the material of the grade, the topics being selected with a 
view to indicating significance and relations with the greatest clear- 
ness possible. It is seldom that a grade teacher has enjoyed the 
opportunity of anything like adequate preparation in this difficult 
field, and it seems wise to provide outlines that will do more than 
merely state in simple form the main topics for the children to 
study. More material is provided under some topics than it will 
be possible to teach to the grade, but the teacher will do more ac- 
curate and stimulating work by having it allin mind. If some things 
that are unfamiliar appear, the topic at least serves to direct the 
teacher to the problem, while the references indicate sources of 
information. : 
At the same time it has been the general plan to introduce to a 
great extent a form of topic that can be used by the pupil, concrete 
and simply descriptive of a line of change or development. Many 
hints regarding presentation are introduced. It should also be 
remembered that one can be both scholarly and simple. Scholar- 
ship does not mean ponderous words and hard phrases; it simply 
means in a wide sense, truthfulness. The Committee of Eight well 
says: “Let it be borne in mind that whilst the arrangement of sub- 
ject matter should be thoroughly scholarly, its handling may be of 
the simplest; the presentation of each larger topic is to be free of 
all technicalities of language and thought.” 
In conclusion, it cannot be insisted too strongly that no teacher 
can do good work by confining her study and preparation to the 
work of her grade, and still less by preparing on only one topic at 
atime. Generally true as this is of all work, it is especially true in 
history, where few details have much significance or value for us if 
considered by themselves alone. The Seventh Grade teacher needs 
to know as well as possible the European beginnings of America, 
the heritage from the mother land; the Eighth Grade teacher can- 
not possibly do the work of the grade well without a good knowledge 
of what precedes it. All is part of the same story. The teacher of 
every grade should aim to know as well as she can the story of Amer- 
ica and its relation to Europe. With so much else to prepare for,
-P-A-G-E-510
  
500 COURSE OF STUDY, BALT!MORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
this will take time, but it is essential to good work and should be 
an end kept in mind.

FIFTH GRADE 
The work of the Fourth and Fifth Grades should present one con- 
tinuous story. The first part tells of the discoverers, explorers, 
and colonizers of North America and ends with the struggle between 
England and France for control of the continent that closed with 
the French and Indian War. The last part of the story, that for 
the fifth grade, begins with an account of life in the colonies just 
previous to the Revolutionary War, tells of the quarrel that brought 
on the War, and through concrete and interesting examples, shows 
how the colonial Americans became a nation, and how through its 
significant people and its significant events, the nation has grown 
to its present size, importance, and ideals. 
The teacher of the Fourth Grade should be familiar with the part 
of the story to be studied in the Fifth Grade and should realize 
that her. work should contribute to an understanding of the later 
events. The Fifth Grade teacher will be constantly referring back 
to colonial ways of living and thinking, and therefore she, too, 
must know the story intimately from beginning to end. A careful 
study of the outlines for the Seventh and Eighth Grades will prove 
of valuable assistance to the teacher’s organization of her own 
study of the subject. Remember that any kind of history can be 
taught to children if we only know how to teach it; the difficulty 
is not in the subject itself but in adapting the material to the child. 
Read carefully and critically the “Teaching of History in the 
Grammar Grades: Some Suggestions,’ pp. 473-500. 
The following outline is not strictly an outline. Because the work 
is entirely new this year it seems wise to include some interesting 
incidents not usually found in convenient places, some source ma- 
terial and some suggestions for method, in order that the teachers 
may be helped while they are preparing their own outlines. We 
will follow the same co-operative plan we have followed in the past: 
whenever a teacher hands in an outline plan that she has found to 
work successfully in classroom and that she thinks will help other 
teachers, the plan will be mimeographed and given to all the teachers

of the grade. It is not expected that any teacher will teach all the 
material in this outline; but she should understand everything in 
the outline, since she is to make a choice of topics. We have en- 
deavored to include only important and significant data. The 
main headings are planned to outline a continuous story. The 
outline is as follows: 
~I. How the Americans lived on the eve of the Revolution. 
II. Why the American colonists quarreled with their Mother 
Country. 
III. The rebellious colonies form a Congress and declare them- 
selves independent of England. 
IV. The War for Independence and how it was won. 
V. The new nation goes into business for itself. 
VI. Doubling the size of the country: The Louisiana Territory. 
VII. The War of 1812: The United States fights for the freedom 
of the seas. 
VIII. Coming to the Age of Machinery. 
IX. Life in the different sections of the republic: an industrial ’ 
and a social contrast. : 
X. The republic expands to the Pacific. 
XI. The North and South quarrel over the extension of slavery 
to the territories. 
XII. One nation or two? 
XIII. The progress of the Age of Machinery. 
XIV. The United States gains “‘over sea’’ possessions. 
I. How the Americans lived on the eve of the Revolution: 
In New England; in the Middle Colonies; in the South. 
How the colonial American spent his day; ‘what his house looked like; what he 
ate; how his house was furnished; what kind of a school he attended; how he 
played; how he worked; how he got his letters and news; how he travelled; how he 
was governed; what he thought of the Old World and of England the home of his 
fathers. (Mainly a review topic.) On the frontier, the “back country.” 
The Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Conrad Weiser will make an interesting story 
of the Indian interpreter who played an important part in frontier affairs at the time 
of the French and Indian War. (For material for this topic see Bolton, Scotch-Irish 
Pioneers (Bacon and Brown); Faust, The German Element in the United States (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin); Weiser, Conrad Weiser; Walton, Conrad Weiser. 
II. Why the American colonists quarreled with their Mother Country: 
The Revolutionary War followed fast upon the French and Indian War. Three 
thousand miles away from the mother country, with the ocean between, the Colonial 
Americans had built up a life quite different from that in Old England. England did 
not understand this and though the colonist wanted to be loyal to his King and to 
his old home, he had an intense love and devotion to his new province and “‘a local 
‘patriotism that was more real than any other feeling he had ever had for England,’
-P-A-G-E-512
  502 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
In England the colonial was considered of very little importance, and when he was 
thought of at all he was regarded as quarrelsome, disobedient and unloyal, and seldom 
as an equal. 
Great Britain was a great manufacturing and trading country. The colonists 
did very little manufacturing, and what they did was expressly forbidden by the 
Mother Country. They had built up a triangular trade with Africa and the West 
Indies: the sugar and molasses of the West Indies was changed into rum in New Eng- 
land and taken to Africa for the purchase of slaves, which in turn were taken to the 
West Indies and the South and sold for cotton, sugar, and molasses. This trade 
Great Britain tried to regulate so as to force the colonists to buy only from British 
sugar islands, which would make the price ruinously high. Her interference led to 
smuggling on the part of many of the leading colonists, and out of smuggling grew the 
first signs of the long and serious war which was to follow. John Hancock, one of 
Boston’s rich merchants, was called in England the ‘“‘Prince of the Smugglers;” 
later a price was put upon his head, and upon that of Samuel Adams, the agitator 
and leader of the ‘‘Boston Tea Party.” 
All of this material must be thought out selectively with the fifth grade child in 
mind and must be made as simple and interesting as possible. Stories of typical 
men and incidents of the time will form the best basis for the work to be accomplished. 
1. Patrick Henry: 
The story of Patrick Henry, the Virginia orator and agitator, one of the first and 
most ardent advocates of independence, should show the Virginia feeling against the 
Stamp Act, will help to make real’the ‘“‘Old Capitol” at Williamsburg (called by Vir- 
ginians the ‘ Heart of the Revolution”) the First Continental Congress, and the Rev- 
olutionary Convention of Virginia. 
The King’s people in Virginia Stamp Act times were called “‘Old Field Nags;” 
and Henry’s people, the “High-blooded Colts;” the latter ‘‘were in the main young 
men, poor, pushing and perhaps impatient of the parliamentary restraints put upon 
them by custom, for the House of Burgesses was organized with all the stereotyped 
regal formalities.”’ 
A picture of the “Old Capitol,” at Williamsburg where he made his famous speech 
should be shown the class. George Wythe was there and Thomas Jefferson, still a 
student, watched proceedings from the lobby. Jefferson said: “I attended the de- 
bate at the door of the lobby of the House of Burgesses and heard the splendid display 
of Mr. Henry’s talents as a popular orator. They were great indeed; such as I have 
never heard from any other man. He appeared to me to speak as Homer wrote.” 
(For interesting incidents of Henry’s life see Morgan, Patrick Henry, Lippincott. 
Stories for children will be found in Gordy, Stories of Later American History; South- 
worth, Builders of our Country, Bk. II.) 
2. Samuel Adams: 
This story will bring out some New England customs, the town meeting, taxes, 
etc.; what a “‘penman” could do for the people; what the ‘Committees of Corres- 
pondence,” which Adams organized, were: what a “‘mob-leader” did; the part he 
played in the ‘‘ Boston Tea Party;”’ how far-reaching hisinfluence wason public opinion. 
A rhyme written by General Gage at this time expresses his feeling: 
“And as for their king, John Hancock, 
And Adams, if they’re taken 
Their heads for signs shall hang up high 
Upon the hill called Beacon.”

HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 503 
3. Beniamin Franklin: 
In the fourth grade Franklin stood out as a successful and useful citizen of Phila- 
delphia and one of the first modern Americans—an inventor, a traveler, a philan- 
thropist, a scientist. He now takes his place as one of the foremost American leaders 
and men of affairs. He is in England as Colonial agent for Pennsylvania and Massa- 
chusetts when the Stamp Act is being discussed; his examination by Parliament and 
his reply to the prime minister probably led to the repeal of the Stamp Act. He 
returned to America, became a member of Congress, served as agent to Canada to 
adjust matters after Arnold’s campaign, was appointed a member of the commission 
to draw up the Declaration, et: For the details of his life see his Autobiography, 
and Ford, The Many-Sided Franklin. 
4, The Battle of Lexington and Concord, April 19, 1775: “The shot heard round the 
World.” 
It is difficult to make such a battle real in a modern classroom, but illustrations 
will help. The effect of the news throughout the colonies can best be conveyed to the 
fifth grade child by the thrilling story of the “express” riders who relayed the news 
from Lexington to South Carolina. ‘Through rain, sun, and star light these name- 
less riders and their brave horses pushed on. Surely they deserve a page in history.” 
The following schedule gives the idea: 
April 19, 1775—The Battle. 
April 20, 1775—General Putnam at Pomfret, Connecticut, got the news. 
April 21, 1775—Arnold at New Haven got it. 
And so on. 
Each rider carried his letter to a member of the “Committee of Safety” for the 
town into which he rode; the “‘Committeeman”’ signed the letter, writing another to 
accompany it if there was time, and sent out a fresh rider if the other was exhausted; 
so it went. 
New York got the “express” Sunday, 23, at noon; it was signed by New Haven, 
Fairfield, Norwalk, Stamford, and Greenwich. 
Elizabeth got it in the evening, the 25th; Woodbridge got it at 10 o'clock 
that night; New Brunswick, at midnight; Princeton 334 hours later; Trenton at 
6 a. m.; Philadelphia at noon sent the news on to Chester; Newcastle got it at 9.p. 
m.; Elkton, in Maryland, at 4 a. m., April 21, Baltimore, at 10 p. m.; at Annapolis 
(Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Tilghman, and others signed the paper). On went 
the riders to Alexandria, to Dumfries, to Fredericksburg, to Williamsburg, to Smith- 
field (May 3,) to Edenton, to New Berne (May 6), to Washington, North Carolina, 
to Georgetown, and at last to Charlestown, South Carolina. 
“What a ride and for what a cause!”

III. The rebellious colonies form a congress and declare themselves 
independent of England. 
1. The Second Continental Congress and the Declaration of Independence. 
Localize the Declaration of Independence by our Fourth of July celebrations to- 
day.

erson, were all members of this Congress. Make clear that at the opening of the Con-  
-P-A-G-E-514
    
504 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
gress many of the delegates, Washington and Franklin among them, did not believe 
in separating from the Mother Country. In June, 1775, while on his way to Cam- 
bridge, Washington promised the assembly of New York to do all that he could to 
bring about peace and harmony with England. “Six months later he raised the 
Continental flag in front of his headquarters at Cambridge and in a few weeks more 
he was openly advocating independence.” 
On July 4th, independence was declared, on July 8th the Declaration was read to the 
people of Philadelphia gathered in State House Square. Its commemoration began 
even the next year; ‘Thomas Burke, writing from Philadelphia, July 5, 1777, notes 
the celebration at that city on the preceding day, at which ‘a Hessian band of music 
which were taken at Princeton performed very delightfully, the pleasure being not 
a little heightened by the reflection that they were hired by the British Court for 
purposes very different from those to which applied.’ ” 
For the pictures and short sketches of the signers of the Declaration see Century 
Historical Reader: The Colonists and the Revolution, pp. 157-179. Maryland’s 
signers were William Paca, Samuel Chase, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carroll- 
ton. 
2. George Washington—Elected Commander in Chief of the American Army: 
The fourth grade work has shown Washington as a fearless young Virginian answer- 
ing the call of duty as a messenger of the Virginia Assembly to the French on French 
River, and later as General Braddock’s aide in the French and Indian War. 
Now Congress chooses him to take charge of its army believing that he, above all 
others, will guide the country safely through the struggle. Modestly Washington 
said: ‘‘Since the Congress desire, I will enter upon the momentous duty, and exert 
every power I possess in your service and for the support of the glorious cause. But 
I beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in this room that I this day, declare 
with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored 
with.” 
On July 14th, Nathaniel Greene of Rhode Island wrote from Boston—“His Ex- 
cellency General Washington has arrived amongst us, universally admired. Joy 
was visible in every countenance and it seemed as if the spirit of conquest breathed 
through the army. I hope we shall be taught to copy his example, and to prefer the 
love of liberty to all the pleasures of domestic life.” 
Give a clear picture of the camp in Cambridge, and Washington’s headquarters 
(the house afterwards owned and occupied by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow); make 
the class see the troops from the various colonies arriving day after day, while pleasure 
parties of townspeople come out to see the great army in the making. Nathaniel 
Greene said “‘If they saw Washington, they would say ‘That is his excellency,’ 
‘That is General Washington,’ remarking about his blue coat, with buff colored 
facings, the rich epaulette on each shoulder, the buff underdress, the elegant small 
sword, and the black cockade in his hat” (Greene: Life of Nathaniel Greene). 
There is a place here for describing Washington’s camp chest for it traveled with 
Washington everywhere during the war. Show a picture of it (one can be found in 
Lossing’s Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution, Vol. 11, p. 200)—“An old fashioned 
hair trunk, 21 in. long, 15 in. wide, 10 in. deep, filled with table furniture used by 
him during the Revolution. It contains a coffee and tea-pot; 3 saucepans; 5 glass 
flasks for honey, salt, coffee, port wine, and vinegar; 3 large tin meat dishes; 16 
plates; 3 knives and 5 forks; 5 small bottles for pepper and other materials for mak- 
ing soup; tin boxes for tea and sugar; and a candlestick and tinderbox.”

HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 505 
IV. The War for Independence and how it was won: 
1. The rank and file in the army under Washington: 
This story will bring out the difficulties Washington encountered in his task of 
making an army for the United States out of the independent little bands sent by 
the different colonies; what a day in camp meant; what trenches were like then; 
difficulty of getting food supplies; enlistments; providing their own guns; suffer- 
ing from want of fuel; home-sickness; dissatisfaction; smallpox in camp; hospitals; 
picket duty; serving in the “‘grass guard” to watch the horses while feeding; repair- 
ing huts; cutting roads; tramping roads through brush; constructing earth-works; 
making cartridges; how disobedient soldiers were punished, etc. ‘‘Peter Young for 
being drunk, was sentenced to ride the wooden horse for fifteen minutes, with two 
guns tied at his feet, and ten minutes without guns, as an adequate punishment for 
his crime.” ‘‘He who fell asleep while on duty was punished by twenty lashes on the 
bare back, or more if the enemy was near enough to make the crime a dangerous one.” 
“A penalty that afforded real amusement was given one Bowen—‘sentenced to wear 
a clogg chained at his leg three days,” or in that to Griffith, guilty of selling Major 
Carne’s cordage, ‘to wear a clog four days with his coat turn’d wrong side outwards.’ ” 
Probably the most interesting information on this topic can be found in Bolton, 
The Private Soldier under Washington, (Scribner.) 
2. In the northern campaign with Washington: 
Still with the rank and file the class can follow Washington through Long Island; 
in New York anxiously watching and working to keep the colonies from being “‘cut 
in two;” around Philadelphia with the terrible winter at Valley Forge; watching the 
whipping into shape that Baron von Steuben (a soldier trained under Frederick the 
Great) gave the army; taking part in the Christmas night capture of the Hessian 
soldiers at Trenton; and finally, hearing the glad news of Burgoyne’s defeat at the 
decisive battle of Saratoga. 
3. The part women played in the war: 
The winter at Valley Forge offers good material as a point of departure for the 
part the women played in the war. Martha Washington and Mrs. Greene were both 
in the habit of spending winters in camp with their husbands and they did much to 
relieve and comfort the poorly-clad and suffering soldiers. Mrs. Reed of Philadel- 
phia; and Mrs. Lee, wife of the Governor of Maryland, were women who led in pub- 
lic movements in their respective cities to help the cause of independence. (See 
“‘Woman’s Work for Soldiers” in Hart, Contemporaries, Vol. II, pp. 467-469; and 
Ellet, Women of the American Revolution.) 
4, Making a flag for the New Union: 
This seems to be the place for a story of the American flag. General Washington 
felt the need for a flag for his camp at Cambridge. There were thirteen different 
flags, even more, from the thirteen different colonies, all waving in the breeze of the 
Massachusetts camp. The story of how Benjamin Franklin’s Congressional Com- 
mittee proposed a flag for Washington called the “flag of the United Colonies of 
America;”’ its description; its first use before the camp at Cambridge; and the adop- 
tion in 1777 of the “‘flag of the thirteen United States” (the story connected with 
Betsy Ross); is well told in one of the Century: Historical Readers: Colonists and Re- 
solution, p. 225-230. Another book, The American Flag, valuable because of its 
colored illustrations and its history of the flag, together with a collection of patriotic 
poems, was compiled and edited by Harlan Hoyt Horner for the New York State 
Educational Department, 1910.  
-P-A-G-E-516
506 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
If the teacher chooses she can bring the story down to date or wait until after the 
events of 1820 before taking up the thread again. She will need to have the follow- 
ing data: The flag of 1795, fifteen stripes and fifteen stars, was carried in the war of 
1812, and was the particular form used in the flag that floated over Fort McHenry 
when Francis Scott Key wrote our stirring natonal anthem, “The Star Spangled 
Banner;” then came the flag of 1818; and then the law that after July 4, 1819, there 
should be thirteen stripes and a star for each state then in the Union, stars to be add- 
ed as each new state was admitted (this to take effect the fourth of July next follow- 
ing its admission). This is the flag we now use. 
5. Nathan Hale, the martyr spy: 
This story will bring out one type of patriotism that war demands. Because it 
is very difficult for the teacher to secure the most accurate and up-to-date details 
upon such a topic, the following data have been culled from a recent Yale University 
Study: Johnson, Nathan Hale, 1776, to be used as the basis for a story of Hale. 
“His sacrifice is an ideal act of patriotism. With a touching and noble regret that he 
could do no more, he surrendered in his country’s behalf the most that a man can 
give—his life and his good name. So Nathan Hale becomes endeared to us.” 
“On the evening of September 22, the regular daily orders from the British Com- 
mander-in-chief to his army contained an unusual announcement: 
“ “Head Qrs., New York Island, Sept. 22nd, 1776. 
‘Parole, London. ‘Count: Great Britain. 
‘A spy from the enemy (by his own full confession) apprehended last night, was 
this day executed at 11 o’clock in front of the Artillery Park.’ ” 
The spy was Captain Nathan Hale. 
The word reached the American lines that same evening. Captain John Mon- 
tressor, an engineer in the British army and aide to Sir William Howe, approached 
the American outposts at old Harlem Lane bearing a letter to General Washington 
respecting the exchange of prisoners. Montressor, in telling the news about the great 
fire that had just destroyed the lower portion of the city said some Americans whom 
the British believed had set the town on fire were immediately caught and thrown 
into the flames; and he further stated that an American officer, Captain Hale, had 
Been executed in their camp that morning asaspy. Two days later Washington sent 
his aide, Lieutenant-Colonel Tilghman, of Maryland, to General Howe’s lines to dis- 
cuss further the exchange of prisoners. With Tilghman went Captain William Hull, 
a dear friend of Nathan Hale, who has written the account of Hale’s death just as 
Engineer Montressor repeated it again to them. 
The story of Washington’s anxiety after the Battle of Long Island which left New 
‘York practically at the mercy of the British army and threatened “‘to divide the 
colonies in two,” the critical situation, and Washington’s ignorance of what was going 
‘on behind the works and the camps across the East River—all can be so vividly 
portrayed as to make Hale’s decision to attempt to get this information a crowning 
climax. It will-bring out how the secret service of the army was managed; what a 
pickéd body such as Knowlton’s Rangers, to which Hale belonged, meant; and how 
carefully Hale thought through the whole matter before he decided to undertake the 
mission. He said to his friend, Captain Wm. Hull, who begged him not to under- 
take the mission: “I am fully sensible of the consequences of discovery and capture in 
such a situation. But for a year I have been attached to the army, and have not 
rendered any material service, while receiving a compensation for which I make no 
return. Yet I am not influenced by the expectation of promotion, or pecuniary re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 507 
ward; I wish to be useful, and every kind of service necessary to the public good, 
becomes honorable by being necessary. If the exigencies of my country demand a 
peculiar service, its claims to perform that service areimperious. . . ..... 
I will reflect, and do nothing but what duty demands.” After he had decided to 
undertake the mission, he made his plans, and “‘disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster, 
in a plain suit of citizen’s brown clothes, with a round, broad brimmed hat, shoes 
without buckles, and with nothing but his college diploma,” he started to explore the 
enemy’s lines on Long Island. The story of the ten days is lost in mystery; but the 
story of the capture has often been told as well as of the cruel treatment Hale prob- 
ably received from the notorious Provost-Marshall Cunningham after the death 
sentence was pronounced. ‘“‘We can picture the ladder, the hangman, the grave at 
his feet, we can see him face it all heroically,” and we can hear him say, “I only re- 
gret that I have but one life to give for my country.” 
A few of Hale’s letters, and some of his poems will find ready interest if read to the 
class. Incidentally much information can be gained by the teacher herself from 
reading this biography carefully; it contains contemporary notices regarding the war 
that were published in ‘“‘The New London Gazette,’ and many letters from Hale’s 
own correspondence. \ 
6. Fighting with Greene in the South: 
“General Nathaniel Greene was second only to Washington” from the beginning 
of the war, to the end of his great campaign in the South. Washington said to Con- 
gress when he announced Greene’s appointment to the command of the Southern 
army, “I think I am sending you a general.” 
Col. Pickering said: “I remember that, as I was passing the night at Providence, 
on my way to New York, with my regiment, in 1776, the conversation turned upon 
the possibility of Washington’s being killed, and who, in case of such misfortune, was 
best qualified to take his place. Greene, it was acknowledged by all, was the proper 
man.” 
He was a Rhode Islander, a splendid business man, and a brilliant soldier, and from 
the beginning of the war he served with Washington and was his staunch friend. The 
British spoke of him as a soldier as dangerous as Washington. He put the army on 
its feet when he was given charge of the commissary at Valley Forge; and though 
the conditions that confronted him on his arrival at Charlotte in December, 1780, 
to take command of the army in the South, were probably worse than at Valley 
Forge and even more discouraging, “with tireless patience he set about changing 
this shadow of an army into a fighting force.” The troops were sadly in need of 
clothes; ‘‘some of the cavalrymen were armed with swords made in blacksmiths’ 
shops and some of the militia had no arms at all. Cooking vessels were almost as 
scarce as arms; tents were almost unknown; the men held their ragged clothes to- 
gether with thorns from locust trees, and food was so scarce that Gen. Lighthorse 
Harry Lee said ‘If we leave here, I know not on what we will employ our teeth.’ ” 
He moved his men to a more comfortable camp on the Pee Dee River close to Corn- 
wallis’ post at Winneboro, South Carolina; and began the famous race with Corn- 
wallis during which King’s Mountain, Cowpens, and Guilford Courthouse shattered 
the British army, and led to its surrender at Yorktown. 
Nathaniel Greene ended his days on the estate on the Savannah River that Georgia 
bestowed upon him. (It was while visiting at Mrs. Nathaniel Greene’s home in 
Georgia after General Greene’s death that Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin.) 
North Carolina and South Carolina were also generous in their gifts of land to him, 
as an appreciation ‘“‘of his worth as a man and his greatness as a soldier.”  
-P-A-G-E-518
508 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
A song the soldiers and the people found popular at the close of the war which was 
sung to the tune of “Yankee Doodle” contains the following stanza: 
“Cornwallis led a country dance, 
The like was never seen, sir; 
Much retrograde, and much advance, 
And all with General Greene, sir. 
They rambled up and rambled down, 
Joined hands and off they ran, sir; 
Our General Greene to old Charlestown, 
And the Earl to Wilmington, sir.” 
For interesting details consult Greene: Life of Nathaniel Greene. 
7. General Daniel Morgan and the Battle of Cowpens: the turning point in the war 
in the South: 
This story should ring out the activities of the Tories in South Carolina which 
probably had a larger Tory population than any other of the thirteen states. Active 
under Arnold at Quebec, at Saratoga, and winning for himself renown for his cour- 
age and daring, this Virginia farmer (born in New Jersey however) was sent by Wash- 
ington with “Lighthorse Harry’ Lee, Colonel William Washington, von Steuben, 
Lafayette, Colonel Otho Williams of Maryland and a few other specially picked men, 
to serve Greene in the Southern campaigns. Morgan’s defeat of ‘Tarleton and his 
Legions,” the famous Tory band of South Carolina, and the capture of nearly all of 
the band, made Greene, even with his miserable little “shadow of an army,” take 
heart. In the retreat that followed across North Carolina and on into Virginia, 
Morgan and Greene played a spirited game of “race” with Cornwallis in pursuit. 
Channing says Morgan deserves to be more widely known. (See Graham: Life of 
General Daniel Morgan.) Lossing in his Pictorial Field Book tells the following story 
of Morgan and Tarleton: 
“In Salisbury one night while the Royal Army rested to take up the pursuit of 
Greene and Morgan the next day, the British officers were hospitably entertained by 
Dr. Anthony Newman, though he was a Whig. Dr. Newman’s two little sons, in the 
presence of Colonel Tarleton and others, were engaged in playing the war game of the 
battle of Cowpens with grains of corn—a red grain for the British officer, a whie for 
the American. Washington and Tarleton were particularly represented, and as one 
pursued the other, the little fellows shouted as in real battle ‘Hurrah for Washing- 
ton!’ ‘Tarleton, run!’ ‘Hurran for Washington.’ 
“Tarleton, irritated beyond measure, muttered fiercely, ‘See those fierce little 
rebels.’ ” 
Lossing also tells a story of Lord Cornwallis at the time he was in pursuit of Gen- 
eral Greene: ‘‘Cornwallis passed near the plantation of the ‘Widow Brevard,’ and 
ordered it to be desolated. When asked why he was.so cruel toward a poor widow, 
he replied: ‘She has seven sons in the rebel army.’ ” 
8. Colonel Francis Marion, the “Swamp Fox’’ of the Pee Pee and Santee Rivers: 
With a ragged regiment ‘‘of leather capped men and boys he darted in and out of 
the marshes falling with lightning swiftness on any careless foes.” He became a 
terror to the British in South Carolina and greatly aided Greene by thus annoying 
and hounding the enemy. 
The story of Marion should form the point of departure for explaining the part guer- 
jlla warfare played in the south. In South Carolina where the Tory element was 
particularly strong and where Cornwallis established a system of imprisoning, hang- 
ing and impressing all patriots who remained in the states and devastating their
-P-A-G-E-519
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 509 
homes, all who would not take the oath of allegiance to the King fled to the swamps 
and mountains of the interior, and under Marion, Sumter, Pickens, and Williams 
kept up the partisan warfare that became so famous. 
Otho Williams (of Maryland), in describing the first occasion when he saw Marion’s 
men, said ‘Their number did not exceed twenty men and boys, some white, some 
black, and all mounted; but most of them miserably equipped; their appearance was, 
in fact, so burlesque, that it was with much difficulty the regular soldier was restrain- ed.” 
Marion was of Huguenot origin (a native of South Carolina), ‘a small, hardy, 
taciturn man, acclimated to swamps and fevers, a lover of horses, a hard rider, 
inspired with all the generosity, chivalry and humanity towards enemies, which was 
so dear to the Southern heart; and of an intelligence that seemed to fit him for high- 
er military command than he ever attained.” (See Fisher: The Struggle for Ameri- 
can Indpendence, Vol. II, p. 245.) Marion in one of his letters describes the methods 
and conditions of warfare in South Carolina: 
“On September the 4th marched with 53 to attack a body of 200 Tories who in- 
tended to surprise me; surprised a party of 45, killed and wounded all but fifteen, 
who escaped ;—met and attacked the main body, and put them to flight, though they 
had 200 men. . . .Marched to Black Mingo Sept. 24th, where there was a guard 
of 60 men of the militia:—attacked them on the 28th: killed three, wounded and took 
13 prisoners. So many of my men were desirous of seeing their wives and families 
which have been burnt out; that I found it necessary to retreat the next morning.” 
(Gordon, American Revolution, Vol. III, p, 455.) 
9. The War on the Sea: 
a. The beginning of the navy. ‘“‘The blockade of Boston, in 1775, made it 
necessary for the British soldiers and the inhabitants of Boston to secure food, 
clothing, and military supplies either from Halifax, the other colonies, or from 
England. Colonel John Glover of Marblehead ‘as much at home on sea as on 
shore’ secured a commission from Washington to fit out one or more vessels at the 
expense of Congress to capture British transports on their way to Boston. Sev- 
eral small fishing schooners, the Hancock, Lee, Franklin and Warren were put into 
service; they were armed with ‘swivel guns and four-pounders’ and manned with 
small companies of soldiers. The Lee captured the British ship Nancy off Cape 
Ann and brought her into Gloucester Harbor. Two thousand muskets and bay- 
onets, eight thousand fuses, thirty-one tons of musket balls, barrels of gunpowder, 
and military tools of many descriptions formed the cargo of this ‘instance of divine 
favor’ as Washington termed it.” (Channing’s History of the U.S., Vol. II, pp. 
175-176.) This little fleet of Washington’s, as it was called, captured about 35 
prizes. d 
b. The Privateersmen and how they worried the British. ‘More than 2000 
American privateers ranged the seas at one time or another during the war. They 
swarmed in the West Indies; they cruised along the Atlantic coasts; they sought 
their prey in the British Channel and the North Sea. They actually cruised off 
the ports of Spain, in plain sight from the shore, capturing British vessels laden 
with fish from Newfoundland—selling ships and cargo to the Spaniards at much 
below their value. . . . They added greatly to the expenditure of English, 
interfered with transport service, and made government and people more willing 
to acquiesce in ‘American Independence.’ ” (Channing, Vol. II, p. 311.) 
For an interesting account of ‘Life of a privateer and the capture of a British 
prize,” see Hart: American History Told by Contemporaries, Vol. II, pp. 497-499.

c. Vessels owned and commissioned by individual colonies: 
The Marine Committee of the war was made up of thirteen members, one for 
each colony and included such men as Robert Morris, Samuel Chase (Maryland), 
and John Hancock, a most ardent and patriotic body of men. It had charge of 
naval affairs until 1779 when a “Board of Admiralty”’ made up of three commis- 
sioners and two members of Congress had charge until 1781. Then Robert Morris 
was appointed Agent of Marine and he managed most ably until the time the 
Constitution was adopted. 
Perhaps the most vivid and concrete way to present this is to make a story 
of Maryland waters and the Chesapeake during the war: 
“Baltimore fitted out more privateers than any other American city. These 
vessels were famous for their speed and the skill with which they were handled. 
. . Ithas been claimed with some reason that Baltimore was the most zealous 
and patriotic city in the country in point of damage inflicted on the enemy.” 
(See Gambrill: Leading Events of Maryland History, p. 129.) 
Maryland’s ship was the Defence (1776). The British sloop of war Otter be- 
gan operations to capture small crafts in Chesapeake Bay and destroy the Defence, 
not quite completed, in Baltimore harbor. Captain Nicholson in command of the 
Defence, determined to retake the prizes, and got his ship ready, shipped a number 
of volunteers, with a portion of Captain Smith’s company as marines, and bore 
down upon the enemy. He was accompanied by several smaller vessels crowded 
with men. The morning was hazy, and the British were taken completely by sur- 
prise. The tenders escaped with difficulty and all the prizes were recaptured, 
manned, and cleared for action. 
“The Otter, frightened by the prompt action and formidable appearance of 
Nicholson’s squadron bore away for Annapolis. But finding this place equally 
well fortified . . . she, with her tenders, dropped down the bay without hav- 
ing won either booty or success.” (See McSherry, History of Maryland, pp. 155- 
156.) 
In December, 1775, Congress established a Continental navy and the gallant 
Captain Nicholson received a commission in the new navy and took command of 
the continental frigate Virginia. Capt. William Halleck and Joshua Barny were 
other Marylanders who entered into the continental service and sailed with Com- 
modore Hopkins from Philadelphia early in 1776 while thousands watched the 
little fleet of five ships, hoist the stars and stripes as they passed down the river. At 
the Capes the Hornet and Wasp, two schooners of Baltimore, joined the fleet which 
sailed for the West Indies. ‘‘This little fleet of eight vessels: Alfred, Columbus, 
Andrea Dorea, Cabot, Providence, Hornet, Wasp, and Fly carried 110 guns, and were 
manned by men without naval discipline, They were to do the work of opposing 
78 British men-of-war mounting 2078 guns.” 
d. The real navy: 
“As early as 1776, Congress had authorized the building of three ‘line of battle’ 
ships intending to match Great Britain on the sea. Such a long line of coast as ours 
needed a strong defense. But there was no money to complete the building of 
those ships; the America begun at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1777, in 1781
-P-A-G-E-521
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 511 
was still only a hulk; the other two were never begun.” She was finished in 1782 
and given to France in part payment of our war debt to her. Robert Morris 
spoke of our navy as the “‘country’s infant and unfortunate navy.” Ina letter to 
France in 1776 he tells of some of the difficulties that made it impossible to goon 
with plans for the navy: the lack of sea-coal, disappointments in efforts to cast 
cannon, the need for all the possible men on shore. Then he gives a rather full 
and complete list of ships available for the-navy at the time, and which Congress 
had to content itself with purchasing from time to time. (See Hart: American 
History told by Contemporaries, Vol. II, pp. 556-559.) For an explanation of 
such naval terms as “‘ships-of-the-line,” “frigate, ‘‘sloop of war,” used at the 
close of the 18th century, see “‘Types of Ships” in A Short History of the United 
States Navy by Clark, Stevens, Alden, Kraft, pp. 44-51. These pages are simply 
told and can easily be read by the fifth-grade child. 
Another interesting book is The Romance of the American Navy by Frederick 
Stanhope Hill (Putnam). 
e. The story of John Paul Jones of Virginia: 
Appointed head of a list of 13 lieutenants in 1776; in May, 1776, given his first 
independent command of the brig Providence Congress promoted him August, 
1776 to full rank of Captain with orders to cruise for prizes along the Atlantic 
coast; by bold maneuvers he made several close escapes himself and captured 
sixteen prizes or more; he was given command of the Alfred in 1777; June, 1777, he 
was put in command of a new 18 gun ship Ranger the first vessel to fly the Stars 
and Stripes then recently adopted” and sailed to European waters. “In Feb- 
ruary, 1778, we find him in Quiberon Bay off the coast of France exchanging salutes 
with a French slfip; the ‘first American vessel to exchange salutes with a foreign 
nation’ writes Jones proudly.” In April, 1778, he left Brest and sailed to the 
English coast to set fire to some shipping in Whitehaven harbor and while off the 
Scotch shore he hoped to take noblemen as hostages to insure the better treatment 
of our prisoners in England. After a battle of an hour and a quarter off the Irish 
coast opposite Whitehaven he captured the British ship Drake. 
Meanwhile France and England had gone to war. Jones tried to get France to 
give him a command for they could render him great service by so doing. After 
many efforts and five months of waiting he went himself to the court and finally 
was given a very old hulk of 40 guns, named the Duras. This he rechristened 
The Bon Homme Richard” in honor of Benjamin Franklin’s ‘Poor Richard’s Alma- 
nac.” Four other ships were added to this squadron and fitted out at L’Orient. 
Jones was able to man his own vessel with 100 American prisoners recently gotten 
from England. With the help of his first lieutenant, Richard Dale, Jones’ ship 
was able to do good service. With his squadron he sailed up the west coast of 
Ireland, rounded the Orkneys, intending to destroy shipping at Leith. On Sept. 
23, 1780, came the encounter with the Baltic Fleet of 40 merchantmen under con- 
voy of the two British men-of-war, the Serapis and The Countess of Scarborough. 
The encounter with the Serapis, “the most striking naval victory of the war” 
is best described in John Paul Jones’ own words (See Hart: American History Told 
hy Contemporaries, Vol. II, pp. 587-590). 
Jones was knighted by France, and was presented a sword by the King. On 
his return to America, Congress gave him a vote of thanks, and appointed him to 
command the “America,” still ‘on the ways” at Portsmouth. Later he went to 
France, then to Russia as vice-admiral, and returned to France where he spent 
most of the remaining years of his life, honored by the French and an intimate
-P-A-G-E-522
512 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
friend of Lafayette. He died July 18, 1792. Napoleon said of him in 1805 “Had 
Jones lived to this day, France might have had an admiral.”” His remains now lie 
in the crypt of the Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis, Maryland. (See Hill, 
The Romance of the American Navy, pp. 61-92.) 
10. George Rogers Clark: how he captured the Great Northwest: 
He put a stop to the Indian warfare which the British commanders roused the 
Indians to wage against the backwoodsmen of the Colonies ‘‘and he gained for the 
country the great stretch of land north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi.” 
“At Detroit, Mackinac, Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and Cahokia, were small forts 
built of logs. These structures had originally been erected by the French fur-traders 
to protect their stocks of goods and in times of danger served as rallying points. 
When the English took possession (at the close of the French and Indian War), 
they were considerably strengthened, and under this remodeling some of them came 
to be formidable fastnesses in a wilderness where besiegers were chiefly savages with- 
out artillery. As a rule, the curtains were guarded at the four corners by solidly 
built blockhouses, serving as bastions, these houses being generally two stories in 
height and pierced for rifles and cannon. One or more of the curtains were formed 
by the rear walls of a row of log-cabins, the others being composed of palisades, great 
logs standing on end, the bottoms well buried in the ground and the tops sharp- 
pointed; around the inner edge of these wooden ramparts, the roofs of the cabins 
formed a gallery, on which crouched those of the defenders who were not already en- 
gaged in the blockhouses. The heavy-timbered gate, with its massive forged hinges 
and bolts, was guarded with particular tenacity. In the event of the enemy forcing 
this, or making a breach in the curtains by burning or scaling the palisades, the block- 
houses were the last towers of refuge, around which the contest was waged to the 
bitter end. 
“At the time of which we are speaking (The Revolutionary time) these frontier 
forts were generally commanded by British captains, with a few regular officers and 
privates to form the nucleus of the garrison . . . . Clark was well aware of 
the condition of affairs north of the Ohio. . . . (He) realized that so long as the 
Northwest was suffered to remain a safe rallying-point for war-parties, Kentucky 
would continue to suffer . . . and very likely the settlers be wholly exterminat- 
ed or at least driven from the field.” 
The sending of spies to Kaskaskia and Vincennes, Clark’s consultation with Pat- 
rick Henry, then Governor of Virginia (August, 1777), the aid given by the legisla- 
ture of Virginia, the secrecy of the undertaking, the collecting of frontiersmen, “many 
of them Scotch-Irish borderers in home-spun and buckskin,” many of them “mean, 
brutal fellows,”” many of them thoughtless adventures, the incidents of the journey 
out to the Kaskaskia,—all are well told in Clark’s Journal which is easily available 
for the teacher. For a convenient and helpful account, see Thwaites: How George 
Rogers Clark Won the Northwest, McClurg Co. 
Thwaites says: “‘The English peace commissioners (1783) at first claimed the North- 
west as a part of Canada; but throughout the protracted negotiations Jay and Frank- 
lin persisted in demanding the country Clark had so gallantly won and was hold- 
ing. . . . (Franklin argued) that unless room for growth were given the United 
States, a permanent peace could not be expected between the two countries—that 
the tide of emigration westward over the Alleghanies could not be stemmed. . . . 
Nevertheless, Jay and Franklin could have found no footing for their contention, had 
Clark not been in actual possession of the country.”

11. Some foreigners who helped the Americans win their freedom: 
Some of them are Kosciusko, the Polish hero; Pulaski, also a Pole; Baron de Kalb; 
Baron von Steuben of Prussia who proved invaluable in disciplining and organiz- 
ing Washington’s raw troops at Valley Forge, and, most illustrious of all on the roll, 
Lafayette (Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette) “who with 
youthful enthusiasm, left wife and fortune and great social position to serve freely 
the cause of liberty. No other foreign soldier entered so completely into the spirit 
of the Americans and viewed with such sympathy all their shortcomings. Lafayette’s 
service in America proved effective in winning American hearts to France as did 
Franklin’s mission in securing for America the friendship of that nation.” (Van 
Tyne: The American Revolution, p. 216.) 
“ Against the King’s commands, he ran away, bought a ship to run away in, board- 
ed it in Pasajes, a port of Spain, and with a commission as Major-General in the army 
of a land three thousand miles away that he had never seen, sailed with eleven 
chosen companions.” April 25, 1777, he landed at the port of Georgetown at the 
mouth of the great Pee Dee River, South Carolina. At first he found only a cool re- 
ception, for foreigners had been coming in by the boatloads and Washington, annoyed 
and worried about them because Congress was poor and could not pay, was always 
glad when a shipload of them left again for their native land. ‘‘But Lafayette was 
different from the others, and when Lafayette with his boyish enthusiasm said that 
he wished to serve in the American army upon ‘two very singular conditions, namely; 
that he should receive no pay, and that he should act as a volunteer,’ Congress was so 
impressed that it gave him the rank of Major-General in the Army of the United 
States.” Washington took him into his ‘military family” and soon grew very 
fond of him; indeed a friendship sprang up that lasted all their lives. 
Wounded at Brandywine; a general before twenty because of his “‘bravery and 
military ardor;” victor at the Battle of Monmouth; one of the court that passed 
judgment on Andre; back again in France in the winter of 1779-80 to persuade his 
King to send an army to America (he yielded to Lafayette’s wishes and sent “7500 
men, comprising some of the best regiments in the French service, and officered by 
men who were famous, or to become so”); returning with this fleet under Count de 
Rochambeau, July, 1780; landing in Newport harbor, where the news of the surrend- | 
er of Charleston to Sir Henry Clinton greeted them:—it is surely an interesting tale. 
The march southward in Feb. 1781,to capture Arnold then stationed as a British 
Major-General with 1400 men in Virginia; the chase across Virginia “from one side 
to another” with Cornwallis; the shutting up of Cornwallis in Yorktown; and the 
surrender, Oct. 19, 1781, where the “boy” as Cornwallis called him turned the tables 
upon him, complete the story. 
“When Lafayette passed through Baltimore at a ball given in his honor, he ap 
peared sad, and on being questioned by one of the ladies as to the cause, replied, I 
cannot enjoy the gayety of the scene while so many of the poor soldiers are in want 
of clothes.’ ‘We will supply them!’ was the reply of the fair querist; and next 
morning the ball-room was transformed into a clothing manufactory. The ladies of 
the city, old and young, gathered to the task, and much was done to relieve the suff- 
ering of the soldiers.” (Gambrill: Leading Events of Maryland History, p. 130) 
In 1824 General the Marquis de Lafayette returned to this country its honored 
guest. ‘‘His journey through the land was like a triumph. Flowers and decora- 
tions brightened his path, cheering people and booming cannon welcomed his ap- 
proach.”
-P-A-G-E-524
514 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Scudder in his George Washington, pp. 203-204, tells the following incident: 
“After the surrender of Yorktown and the departure of the French, Washington 
established his headquarters at Newburgh on the Hudson. There he remained with 
his army until it was disbanded; and the house in which he lived is carefully preserv- 
ed and shown as an historical museum. 
“There is a pleasant story told of Lafayette’s affectionate remembrance of his 
life there. Just before his death, which occurred in 1834, he gave a dinner party in 
Paris to the American minister and some friends who had been old associates. Later 
in the evening, when the hour for supper came, the guests were ushered into a room 
which was in strange contrast with the elegance of the apartments they had been 
in. The ceiling was low, with large beams crossing it; there was a small single un- 
curtained window, and several small doors. It looked more like an old-fashioned 
Dutch kitchen than a room in a French house. A long, rough table was meagerly 
set. A dish of meat stood on it, some uncouth-looking pastry, and wine in decanters 
and bottles, ready to be poured into glasses and camp-mugs. ‘Do you know where 
we are now?’ asked Lafayette as his companions looked about puzzled, and as if in 
adream. ‘Ah! the seven doors and one window! and the silver camp-goblets!’ ‘We 
are at Washington’s headquarters on the Hudson, fifty years ago!” He had repro- 
duced the room to surprise his friends.”

quis de LaFayette, Vol. 11; and (for children) Burton: Lafayette, the Friend of American 
Liberty. A.B. Co. 
12. The Surrender of Cornwallis. 
The Yorktown campaign was so intimately connected with the coming of the 
French troops that those two subjects can conveniently be treated as one. Char- 
lemagne Tower: Marquis de Lafayette, Vol. 11; H.P. Johnston: Yorktown Cam- 
paign; and Cornwallis’ own account of the capitulation to be found in Hart’s Con- 
temporaries, Vol. 11, pp. 615-619, will give all the material necessary for a complete 
picture of the event. The teacher may find that Cornwallis’ account alone together 
with the following information from Scudder’s George Washington presents enough 
data out of which to make a story:— 
“There was great rejoicing in camp at the surrender, which was long remembered. 
Washington issued orders that the army should give thanks to God: ‘Divine serv- 
ice. . . . is to be performed tomorrow in the several brigades and divisions. 
The Commander-in-chief earnestly recommends that the troops not on duty should 
universally attend, with that seriousness of deportment and gratitude of heart which 
the recognition of such reiterated and astonishing interpositions of Providence de- 
mand of us.’ 
“The citizens of Fredericksburg gave a great ball and Washington’s mother, whose 
home was in Fredericksburg, was the guest of honor.” 
(If more convenient use one of the standard histories of the Revolution—Van 
Tyne, Fisher, F. V. Greene, Fiske, Channing (Vol. III of his History of U. S.) 
13. Maryland’s worthy part in the war: 
That Maryland men and women did play a worthy part is a matter of real pride 
and pleasure to all Marylanders. 
Probably the most interesting story to tell is that of Tench Tilghman: Born near 
Easton, Maryland; graduating at the College of Philadelphia and entering into mer- 
cantile life in Philadelphia (a point of contact with Robert Morris and the ‘Will- 
ings); entering the army early in 1775 as a lieutenant in an infantry company;—he
-P-A-G-E-525
  
HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 515 
became in August, 1776, one of General Washington’s aides and his military sec- 
retary, and continued in this office until the close of the war, participating in all the 
battles of the main army. Wherever Washington was, there was Tilghman. 
From the battle-field of Yorktown Washington sent him to carry news of the vic- 
tory to Congress at Philadelphia. He was to spread the news as he rode through the 
country. He covered the distance in four days, arousing President McLean at mid- 
night. On October 24, 1781, cannon were fired in Philadelphia in honor of the victory 
that happened five days before. For this memorable ride Congress recognized Tilgh- 
man’s service by voting him “‘a horse properly caparisoned and an elegant sword, 
in testimony of their high opinion of his merit and ability.” 
Washington said of him: ‘Colonel Tilghman has been in every action in which the 
main army was concerned, and has been a faithful assistant to me for many years, 
a great part of which time he refused to receive pay.” 
After the war Tench Tilghman came to Baltimore to establish a branch of the 
Robert Morris mercantile house; there he died in 1786, still a young man. 
It would be interesting to have the class find out where Tilghman’s mercantile 
house was located in Baltimore and where he lived while in the city. A history 
of Talbot County would supply the full record of his life. 
But it may be that some teachers will prefer to select other names from Mary- 
land’s honor list and make a story of them. The list includes among others—Col. 
Otho Williams, Maj. Mordecai Gist, Col. Nathaniel Ramsay, Col. John Eager How- 
ard, Col. John Gunby; Lieut. Joshua Barney and Commodore Nicholson of the navy; 
and the women who helped relieve suffering and misery. Something will depend up- 
on the locality in which the school is located. Monuments in the neighborhood, 
memorial tablets, copies of the “Maryland Gazeite,” buildings of Revolutionary 
times now standing, stories about old residents whose brave deeds have been a sub- 
ject for fireside discussion ever since the war—all these might become the starting 
point for beginning the study of the Revolution. They are “remains” and such 
concrete, definite remains are a teacher’s opportunity for “making the past real’’ 
to her students. 1 
14. Paying the war debts: the other side of the war— 
War is an expensive thing and the war debts Congress had to assume should be 
made clear to even the ten year old child. This story will give some idea of the 
coins in use and their value; paper money, its value—‘‘not worth a continental” — 
and why it declined in value; paying soldiers; borrowing from France, Holland and 
Spain, etc. The central figure of the money situation was Robert Morris, the Phila- 
delphia banker. The great service he rendered the country is as great as that of the 
greatest soldier of the time and must be so recognized. Robert Morris will be of 
peculiar interest to our county children because he began his colonial life as a boy 
of thirteen in the town of Oxford on the Eastern Shore of Maryland: This small 
boy from Liverpool crossed the Atlantic in one of the poor ships of the time, to join 
his father who was an agent in Oxford for a Liverpool tobacco house. Of Oxford we 
read ‘‘no other port on the bay was so busy, and it was not unusual for seven or 
eight ships to be anchored there at one time, unloading European goods and taking 
on American cargoes, which were made up for the most part of tobacco. The story 
of Morris’ humble origin; his arrival in Maryland, his education under Rev. Mr. 
Gordon at Oxford (of whom Robert said when his father reproved him for inatten- 
tion to his studies ‘‘I have learned sir, all that the master could teach me”); his ap- 
prenticeship to Robert Greenway, a merchant of Philadelphia and a friend of his 
father; his clerkship.in the mercantile house of Charles and Thomas Willing where 
   
-P-A-G-E-526
    516 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
he rose rapidly because of his business ability, one day cornering the market on flour 
by buying up all that a ship in the Delaware had brought when its Captain told 
him that prices on flour had advanced in Europe, and by so doing raising the prices in 
Philadelphia; his father’s death and his great sorrow over the loss; his partnership 
with the Willings, and the rapid rise of ‘‘ Willing and Morris” as a leading house in 
Philadelphia and their trading with Europe and the West Indies; the activity of 
Morris in resenting the Stamp Act; the entrance of both Mr. Willing and Robert 
Morris to Congress early in the Revolution;—all of these details will bring out 
Robert Morris’ power to meet and cope with financial situations. 
Oberholzer in his Robert Morris, Patriot and Financier tells the story of Philadel- 
phia’s resistance to the Stamp Act: 
“On October 5, 1765, the nose of the Royal Charlotte, an English merchant vessel, 
under escort of the Sardine, an English man-of-war, appeared around Gloucester 
point. The ship, which was filled with ‘the horrible stamp paper,’ had been lying 
at anchor down the river for seven days. The officers feared to bring her up. It 
was well understood that the colonists would resist the landing of the paper. When 
the Charlotte finally hove in sight, all the other ships at their wharves, and in mid- 
stream displayed their flags at half mast. The bells ef the city were tolled. Drums 
muffled with crape were beaten up and down the city streets by particularly sable 
negroes. . . . Men closed their shops and offices, and the highways were filled 
with people who ran hither and thither excitedly. A crowd collected at the State 
House where, at four o’clock in the afternoon, a meeting was held, to decide what 
course should be pursued to prevent the execution of the King’s tyrannous measures. 
. » John Hughes, a well-to-do Philadelphia shop-keeper, had been chosen to re- 
ceive and sell stamps. . . . A commttee of seven was appointed to visit Hugh- 
es. . . . (and ask him) whether or not he proposed to take up his commission 
and perform the duties of his office (as the King’s stamp agent. . . . Robert 
Morris . . . (was) spokesman of the committee . . . (Morris threatened) 
that the populace would undoubtedly come to the house and tear it to the ground, 
stone by stone, if he (meant) to receive the stamps and collect the tax. . . . . 
was obliged to pledge himself to take no steps to distribute the stamps until the citi- 
zens of Pennsylvania and Delaware wished him to perform the duty.” 
In April, 1776, Robert Morris, was commissioned by Congress to suggest methods 
and provide ways and means for securing money to carry on the war. This was the 
beginning of his long service in borrowing, lending and expending money for the 
business of war. He was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence who 
at first ‘faltered at the thought of a separation from the mother country.” 
Soon the calls for “‘needful,”’ as he called it, to carry on the war began to come in 
“loud, large, and constant.” When Washington was ready to make the attack upon 
Trenton, all Morris could send him from Philadelphia was 410 Spanish dollars, two 
English crowns, a French half-crown, and 10 1-2 English shillings. ‘Later when 
Congress began its extensive emission of incontrovertible paper money, Morris who 
had ever been opposed to this policy, wrote to Congress in Baltimore: ‘It is mortify- 
ing for me when I am obliged to tell you disagreeable things, but I am compelled to 
inform Congress that the Continental currency keeps losing its credit.’”” From the 
first it took two paper dollars to induce a holder to part with one silver dollar; a pair 
of shoes cost $3 and a hat $12. ‘Five years later it took 1000 of these paper dollars 
to buy a silver dollar, and men lit their pipes and the barbers of Philadelphia plaster- 
ed the walls of their shops with this disgraced and worthless money.”
-P-A-G-E-527
    
HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 517 
Read in Hart’s Contemporaries, Vol. II, pp. 601-603, what William Pynchon said 
in his diary about business life during the War—‘‘So! So! So! members of Congress, 
whither is your credit going? Down hill, surely; but they will bring it up with a 
heavy tax.” 
15. The Treaty of Peace: 
Peace did not come all at once after Yorktown. After the French fleet left, Wash- 
ington established his headquarters at Newburgh on the Hudson to wait for news 
from the American peace envoys that would enable him to disband his army and com- 
pel the evacuation of the British from New York. 
Boundaries, fishery questions, treatment of American Loyalists, the paying of war 
debts—all had to be settled. These negotiations dragged on for nearly two years. 
“On April 18, 1783, the eighth anniversary of the night when Paul Revere roused 
the minute men of Lexington to meet the British regulars on the village green, Wash- 
ington proclaimed hostilities at an end; and by the splendid example of his single- 
minded patriotism, persuaded men and officers to go to their homes without a farth- 
. ing in their pockets, confident in the power and good will of the new government to 
reward them according to their deserts.” 
The final articles of peace were signed September 3, 1783, the British soldiers got 
ready to leave America and on November 23rd the last English ship sailed out of 
New York harbor. Washington was there to see them off. 
“A few days later many of his old friends gathered in the long hall at Fraunces’ 
Tavern in Broad Street to say farewell. It was a touching scene. Washington’s 
voice faltered, he said a word or two, they drank a solemn toast; and then Washing- 
ton said: ‘I cannot come to each of you to take my leave, but shall be obliged if 
each of you will come and take me by the hand.’ General Knox stood nearest, and 
he held out his hand. The tears were in Washington’s eyes as he turned to his old 
comrade and grasped his hand. He drew thestrongmantohimand. . . kissed 
him. Not a word could either of them speak. Another general followed and anoth- 
er, each greeted with the same affection; then Washington left the room, passed 
through the corps of infantry which stood on guard, and walked to Whitehall, fol- 
lowed by the whole company, a silent procession. He entered the barge, turned as 
the boat pushed off, and waved his, hat in silent adieu. The officers returned the 
salute in the same way and in silence marched back to Fraunces.’ ” 
Probably the most important point to bring out in the “Treaty of Peace” is the 
boundaries, though a little might be said about the Loyalists. Nathaniel Greene 
who had fought against them in the South now wanted a lenient policy adopted to- 
ward them saying ‘‘the country needed population and must stand for difference of 
opinion.” In discussing the boundaries a contemporary map is preferable. 
Washington went to Philadelphia; from there to Annapolis where Congress was as- 
sembled; there on December 23, 1783, he resigned his commission. 
V. The new nation goes into business for itself: 
The boundaries of the new republic; with the leading cities and their populations, 
will connect this topic with Topic IV. 
When the maps showing the boundaries after the Treaty of Paris are discussed with 
the children and copied by them, questions are apt to arise about the country be- 
yond the mountains and what had been going on there while the war was being fought 
along the coast. ‘‘George Rogers Clark and the Northwest”’ will serve as a discus- 
sion point also and the topic will very naturally lead to a story of the life of the back- 
woodsmen of the time.

e. The Ohio Company: The town of Marietta and the State of Ohio: 
The review of George Rogers Clark and the Great Northwest might well lead 
on to a simple discussion of the importance of the Northwest Territory, the Ordi- 
nance of 1787, and the Ohio Company. 
The teacher must keep in mind the importance of the Northwest territory at 
this time and the common interest of all the states in that region. Maryland’s 
refusal to ratify the Articles of Confederation was because she foresaw the import- 
ance of the territory, and declared that Virginia’s claims to it (for Virginia laid 
claim to the Ohio country at the close of the Revolution) was neither just nor wise; 
Maryland then took the stand that until the other states relinquished their claim 
to this territory and until Congress took control of it she would not ratify the 
Articles of Confederation. Fiske says: ‘Just as it was Massachusetts that took 
the decisive step in bringing on the Revolutionary War when she threw the tea in- 
to Boston Harbor, so it was Maryland that, by leading the way toward the crea- 
tion of a national domain, laid the corner stone of our Federal Union.” 
Maryland came into the Union in 1781. 
The prominent Marylanders who helped to bring about the passage of the Ordi- 
nance of 1787 were Daniel Carroll, William Paca, James Forbes and George Plater. 
While Washington was waiting at Newburgh for the terms of the Treaty of 
Peace to be concluded, some of his prominent officers were planning to establish 
a military colony in the Ohio territory. One of these was Gen. Rufus Putnam, the 
“builder of forts” in the Revolution. The matter was placed before Congress 
which was at the time trying to provide a temporary government for the Terri- 
tory. The plan of government was published in the “Ordinance.” It provided 
for a governor and three judges who could adopt such laws of the original states as 
seemed wise and necessary: “‘So soon as the district should contain 5000 free male 
inhabitants it could establish a representative assembly; there was to be no follow- 
ing of the law of primogeniture; children of proprietors dying without a will were 
to receive equal shares of the estates. Slavery also was forbidden. Freedom of 
worship, morality and education, were to be encouraged.”

  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 519 
Rufus Putnam started out from Massachusetts in April, 1788, with surveyors, 
mechanics and laborers to make the first settlement under the Ordinance. The 
story is told for children in Montgomery, “‘The Beginner’s American History,” 
pp. 150-156. 
“They took with them their energy, their skill, and their love of freedom, and 
also the religious ideals and thirst for knowledge that was a mark of the times.” 
They carried no slaves. 
At the same time a certain “John Brown traveling from North Carolina into 
Tennessee by way of the Ohio and Tennessee river carried with him his wife and 
sons, his household furniture, tools, ammunition, and bales of goods, some books, 
and four negro slaves together valued at $933.33 1-3.” 
Significant facts are told here that ought to bring out a question about slavery 
in the two territories. 
2. The Philadelphia Convention, May 2, 1787; making the Constitution. 
The calling of the Convention, and the tardy arrival of the delegates from the 
States can be pictured for the class (the meeting called for May 2nd, many delegates 
not arriving until May 25th). Washington made a triumphal entry into the city 
on the 13th. The meeting convened May 25th with Washington as chairman. 
The business was secret: and the proceedings were considered ‘so important that 
earth was scattered over the pavement of the State House to silence the rattling 
wheels, and sentries were stationed at the doors to warn intruders that they might 
not enter to disturb the proceedings.” 
“On Sept. 17th, citizens of Philadelphia who took up their copies of the Pennsyl- 
vania Advertiser found to their surprise that the columns were completely filled with 
the new Constitution. This was their first intimation of what the convention had 
really done” —“ Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the States . 
in witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.” 
Then followed the business of the ratification of the Constitution by the States. 
It was not done all at once. When New Hampshire and Virginia announced the 
ratification the following interesting advertisement appeared in one of the Philadel- 
phia papers, the Pennsylvania Packet, July 14, 1788: 
“SHIP NEWS—EXTRA 
“Arrived safe in port, the ship ‘Federal Constitution,’ Perpetual 
Union, commander. In her came passengers Flourishing Com- 
merce, Public Faith, Confidence, Justice.”

York by Secretary Thomson of the newly organized Senate; how Washington re- 
ceived it: his preparations to travel north; demonstrations on the way especially in 
Maryland; the arrival in New York; the Inauguration, April 30, 1789; Mrs. Wash- 
ington’s arrival in New York; Washington’s reception: how their formality offend- 
ed many of the democrats; removing Congress to Philadelphia for ten years while a 
capital was being built.

4, Locating the capital: 
“Congress was always on the wing.’’ A comic political poem of the time makes a 
New York housemaid say to her friend in Philadelphia: 
“As for us, my dear Nancy, we’re much in a pet, 
And hundreds of houses will be to be let; 
Our streets, that were just in a way to look clever, 
Will now be neglected and nasty as ever; 
Again we must fret at the Dutchified gutters 
And pebble-stone pavements, that wear out our trotters. 
“This Congress unsettled is, sure, a sad thing— 
Seven years, my dear Nancy, they’ve been on the wing; 
My master would rather saw timber, or dig 
Than see them removing to Conogocheague— 
Where the houses and kitchens are yet to be framed, 
The trees to be felled and the streets to be named.” 
Congress decided upon the Potomac River as the location of a permanent capital 
and Washington chose the site. ‘He chose that of the present city of Washington, 
(named for the ‘Father of his Country’). A district ten miles square, on both sides 
of the river, was ceded to the United States by Virginia and Maryland. It was pro- 
vided that the public buildings should be erected on the Maryland side, and the 
part ceded by Virginia was afterwards given back to that state. Both Maryland 
and Virginia appropriated large sums of money to be used for the erection of these 
buildings. The corner-stone of the capitol was laid by Washington on Sept. 18, 
1793, and the seat of government was removed to the new capital in June, 1800.” 
(Gambrill, p. 144.) Mrs. John Quincy Adams (Abigail Adams) describes the Na- 
tional Capital in 1800 in one of the letters to her daughter, Mrs. W. S. Smith (see 
Hart: Contemporaries, Vol. III, pp. 331-333), and tells of the “infamous roads; the 
unfinished condition of the Capitol itself: the high cost of wood; the necessity for 
drying the wash in the great audience room:” etc. 
Robert Morris was active in promoting the building of the city, buying up lots, 
and putting up brick houses. He made little if any money on the project. 
5. Establishing public credit: 
Alexander Hamilton and his life on Nevis, one of the islands of the West Indies, 
will serve to show the important part the West Indies played in the history of the 
times; his arrival in New York; his early acquaintance with Washington; their friend- 
ship; his part in the Revolution; his ability in financial matters early recognized by 
Morris; his appointment to be Secretary of the Treasury in Washington’s Cabinet; 
his great service in establishing the public credit—all these details can be made of 
real interest to the child of this grade, if told simply and related to the child’s own 
knowledge of credit at the present time. The class knows from the story of Robert 
Morris that the country was in debt and in a sorry state financially. The debt to 
foreigners amounted to nearly $12,000,000; to our own citizens more than $42,000,- 
000. Besides this, the separate states had large debts, of which the general govern- 
ment later assumed about $18,000,000. 
His belief that the debts should be paid at face value and that the States’ debts 
incurred during the Revolutionary War should be paid out of the common treasury 
laid the foundation of public faith in the government’s promises. He did his work 
so well that forty years later Daniel Webster said of him: ‘He smote the rock of 
national resources, and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth. He touched 
the dead corpse of Public Credit, and it sprang upon its feet.” He raised the money

by a tariff or duty laid on imported goods. Later, an excise tax was laid on distilled 
spirits; a member of Congress said this was like “drinking down the national debt.” 
REFERENCE: Sparks, The Men Who Made the Nation, (Macmillan). 
VI. Doubling the size of the Country: the Louisiana Territory: 
Thomas Jefferson and the purchase of Louisiana; the “‘Lewis and Clark” ex- 
ploring expedition. 
1. Thomas Jefferson: 
Thomas Jefferson has already been mentioned as the ‘‘Father of the Declaration 
of Independence”—now as president he comes more clearly into view. 
“Tall in stature, he was not outwardly an impressive figure. His red, freckled 
face wore a frank, good natured expression, but he lacked dignity and poise. ‘His 
whole figure had a loose, shackling air’ wrote a contemporary; ‘A laxity of manner 
seemed shed about him . . . even his discourse partook of his personal demean- 
or. It was loose and rambling.’ With his blue coat and red waistcoat, his green 
velveteen breeches, yarn stockings, and slippers down at the heels, he seemed to an 
English visitor, who saw him in 1804, ‘very much like a tall, large-boned farmer.’ 
Jefferson would have been the last to resent this epithet. No man had a more pro- 
found respect for tillers of the soil.” (Johnson: Union and Democracy, pp. 128- 
129.) Henry Adams said, if Jefferson could have had his way he would have made 
the United States ‘“‘an enlarged Virginia—a society to be kept pure and free by the 
absence of complicated interests, by the encouragement of agriculture and of com- 
merce as its handmaid.” ‘He hated cities and factories and dreaded the growth 
of the manufacturing and capitalist class.” 
Jefferson and Patrick Henry were friends. Jefferson heard Henry make his fa- 
mous “taxation without representation” speech in the House of Burgesses in 1765; 
he stood in the doorway, ‘an entranced listener, thinking that Henry spoke ‘as 
Homer wrote.’ ” 
His father (of Welsh descent) died when Thomas was but fourteen years old; his 
will said that Thomas was to receive a classical education, and that he should never 
be permitted to neglect his health and strength. Jefferson went to school to Rev. 
James Maury of Huguenot descent, with whom he studied Greek and Latin; there 
he became noted for his scholarship, industry, and shyness. He could run, chase 
foxes, and was a bold and graceful rider. 
When only sixteen, never having seen a large town or even a large village, he start- 
ed off for William and Mary College, in Williamsburg. Details of his life there can 
be woven into a single story. It is interesting to note that Jefferson, John Marshall, 
and Henry Clay, all studied law under George Wythe, one of the greatest lawyers of 
that day. Other details of his career are—his democratic reform, his idea of educat- 
ing the people; his life in Paris; his inauguration; ‘‘peace, his passion;” the pur- 
chase of Louisiana; New Orleans, the gateway of the Western territory; France re- 
gains Louisiana from Spain and our Western people fear that the mouth of the river 
will be closed to their trade; Livingston and Monroe, working for our interests in 
France, seize the opportunity to purchase Louisiana for $15,000,000. Livingston 
after signing his name to the treaty “‘rose and shook hands with Monroe and Mar- 
bois; ‘We have lived long,’ he said with emotion, ‘but this is the noblest work of our 
lives,’ ”

of Thomas Jefferson.

2. The Lewis and Clark Expedition: 
Material for the “Lewis and Clark’’ Expedition story (1804-05) is easily available 
and nothing more need be said about it here. Every public matter has its advocates 
and opponents; the following verse from one of the issues of the ‘“‘ United States 
Gazette,” of that time says 
“‘Herostratus of old, to eternize his name 
Sat the temple of Diana all in a flame; 
But Jefferson lately of Bonaparte bought 
To pickle his fame, a mountain of salt.” 
VII. The War of 1812: The United States fights for the freedom of 
the seas. 
(vIn 1805 Nelson at Trafalgar made England mistress of the seas. All Europe was 
then engaged in a war in which England tried to break the power of Napoleon in 
France. Then “‘no flag appeared on the high seas except those of England and the 
United States.” England needed sailors so she allowed her men-of-war to cruise 
along the American coast, overhaul American trading vessels and take seamen who 
could not prove they were. American born; “then she further insulted this country 
by saying no neutral ship might trade with France or her allies until she had first 
touched at a British port and paid re-exportation duties.” We went to war. (See 
the Seventh Grade course of study.) 
For Fifth Grade purposes possibly the most concrete incidents to tell are: (a) a few 
actual stories of impressment; (b) a story of a ship that got captured; (c) an adventure 
of a particular privateer; (d) an account of the bombardment of Fort McHenry and 
the writing of the “Star Spangled Banner,” our national anthem, by Francis Scott 
Key; (€) the Battle of New Orleans which will bring out the story of Andrew Jackson. 
Madison was President at the time; the names of Henry Clay and John C. Cal- 
houn, the two ‘‘war hawks” who helped bring on this war with England, and that 
of Daniel Webster who fought in Congress to avoid the war, should be mentioned 
here. See Hart: Conetmporaries, Vol. III, pp. 385-389 for an experience of impress- 
ments told by Capt. Basil Hall, a Midshipman on board the British man-of-war 
Leander which searched vessels for British seamen; Gambrill: Leading Events of 
Maryland History for the War of 1812 and Maryland’s Part in it; Montgomery: A 
Beginner’s American History for the story of Andrew Jackson and the battle of New 
Orleans, told for children. For the more ambitious student of history, Henry 
Adams’ History of the U.S. under Jefferson and Madison, the standard work and de- 
lightfully written, will give all the concrete details that might be needed (9 vol. 
Scribner). ’ 
VIII. Coming of the “Age of Machinery”: 
“Inventors are as useful as statesmen. They have changed the manners and cus- 
toms of the world and opened new occupations to men and women. They have made 
a new basis for aristocracy and established a premium for personal worth. They 
have drawn continents closer together and given direction to world politics.” 
1. The coming of the factory to America: 
We will have to go back to the factory conditions in England at this time in or- 
der to get the stories of Richard Arkwright and other inventors of spinning machin- 
ery; Edward Cartwright and the power loom; and James Watt and his steam engine. 
When the story of the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney is added we have 
the inventions that really revolutionized the industry and commerce not only of 
England and America, but of the world.
-P-A-G-E-533
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 523 
Just after the Revolutionary war Tench Cox, a Philadelphia manufacturer, made 
vigorous efforts to secure a set of the Arkwright models. He sent an agent to Eng- 
land who offered a large reward for a full set, in metal, of the models. At the 
same time advertisements appeared in the papers of the United States: pro- 
moting manufacturing in every possible way. 
Samuel Slater, apprenticed to Arkwright, heard of the liberal bounty granted by 
the legislature of Pennsylvania to a person who had succeeded but poorly in con- 
structing a carding machine, and of further rewards for the promotion of manufac- 
ture; he decided to come to America secretly, because it was unlawful for such a work- 
man to leave England or for any one to bring away drawings. His offer to Mr. 
Brown of Pawtucket to produce “‘as good yarn as they do in England” was accepted 
and in 1790 the first factory in America was completed at Pawtucket—the ‘‘Almy, 
Brown & Slater Co.” 
The Rhode Island Agricultural Society said of Slater at his death: 
“What shall the people of New England do for him who first brought us the know- 
ledge of manufacturing cloth by machinery moved by water! In England, he would 
in life be ornamented with a peerage; in death, lamented by a monument in West- 
minster Abbey. The name of Slater will be remembered as one of our greatest pub- 
lic benefactors. ‘Let not the rich in this adopted country envy the product of his 
labor, his extensive opulence, his fair and elevated character. Let the poor rise up 
and call him blessed; for he has introduced a species of industry into our country 
which furnished them with labor, food, clothing, and habitation.”—Brooks, Story of 
Cotton. 
By 1814 Francis C. Lowell had built the first complete mill in America, at Wal- 
tham, Mass., all the processes of carding, spinning, weaving, and printing being 
carried on under the same roof. 
2. Improved methods of carrying passengers and freight: 
a. The story of Robert Fulton and the first successful steamboat in America 
(1807). 
For a recent biography of Robert’ Fulton, see Dickinson: Robert Fulton, 
John Lane Co. Montgomery's A Beginner’s American History contains a story 
for the child. Add to these the following references which might be consulted for 
all the stories of inventions:

4. Improving postal service: 
The post roads alone will make an interesting project to study. A map of the 
post routes in 1790 (See Sparks’ Expansion of the American People, p. 250) con- 
trasted with one in 1840 and one at the present time would be instructive. 
In 1792 the postal routes were extended from Richmond, Va., across the moun- 
tains to Danville, Kentucky. By 1800 they were extended into Tennessee: to Syra- 
cuse, New York; up the Susquehanna to northwestern Pennsylvania; through the 
Northwest to Zanesville. By 1803 Cincinnati and Detroit were connected by a 
route. The average rate for all letters was about 10 cents but newspapers were 
carried free. 
5. Improving the farmer’s crop: Cyrus McCormick and his reaper (1834). 
“In 1800 we were a nation of farmers. . . . As we advanced westward there 
were vast quantities of rich land which could be cheaply bought. The settlers on 
this land were men of brains as well as brawn, and in tilling of the soil they used better 
methods than had ever been used before. In 1825 they had thrown aside the wooden 
mold-board and were using the cast-iron plow. By 1835 they were using threshing- 
machines to separate the grain from the straw instead of beating it out with the flail 
or treading it out with the slow feet of oxen. In 1840 scythes were being cast aside 
and the McCormick Reaper—first patented in 1834—was making it possible for one 
man with a team of horses to cut as much grain as ten men could cut with a scythe 
or cradle.” (Forman: History of the United States, p. 298.) 
Note: The plan might well be carried out here of teaching only such inventions as 
were in use by 1840, leaving the others to be discussed under Topic XIII: ‘The pro- 
gress of the age of machinery.”” The teacher should decide whether Elias Howe’s in- 
vention of the sewing machine (1846), and McClay’s invention of shoe machinery are 
to be included in the early or the later stage. For further material on inventions and 
manufactures see: Coman, Industrial History of the U. S., Bogart, Economic His- 
tory of the U. S., Wright, Industrial Evolution of the U. S., Carlton, History and 
Problems of Organized Labor, and Callender: Economic History of the United 
States (Ginn & Co,). 
IX. Life in the different sections of the republic: an industrial and 
social contrast. 
1. A cotton plantation of the South—“‘King Cotton” 
Probably Brooks, The Story of Cotton (Rand, McNally, Co.) gives as interesting 
and graphic an account of the Southern plantation life as can be found conveniently 
anywhere. The outline of the story as he tells it covers the following points: 
“The master’s domain: the field hands; cotton picking and the gin; wagon drivers; 
the steward; the cobblers, carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths; other activities of 
the slaves; duties of the mistress; life and comfort of the slaves; relation of ‘master’s 
children to the slaves; attachment of master and servant; attending church; some of 
the evils of the plantation system.” 
Life on such a plantation in the South resembles closely the feudal life of the middle 
ages. Its charm can be vividly pictured; and its disadvantages for progress also 
shown. 
2. A new England factory town: 
(A plan for this story will be worked out during the year.) 
3. A Middle States (Pennsylvania) farm: 
(A plan for this story will be worked out during the year.)

4. A Western community: 
(Such as Eggleston describes in his Hoosier School Boy and Hoosier School 
Master.) 
(A plan for this story will be worked out during the year.) 
Note: As each story is worked out it will be mimeographed and given to all the 
teachers of the Fifth Grade Group. Probably the best references for the teachers 
are Callender: Economic History of the United States, pp. 271-487; and Coman: 
Industrial History of the United States and others mentioned at end of Section 
VIII. 
X. The republic expands to the Pacific: 
Use the “expansion” topics as the occasion for review. This topic represents the 
third “wave” of expansion. ‘The first great wave” was that when the stream of 
pioneers—Boone, Sevier, Robertson, etc., ‘empire builders,’ passed through the 
Alleghanies into the forest lands of the Ohio, the Tennessee, and the Cumberland 
Valley (See Roosevelt: The Winning of the West). . . . . The “second wavel’ 
followed the War of 1812, filling the Indiana and Illinois territories to the north and 
the Mississippi and Missouri territories to the south and bringing in five new West- 
ern states (Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois, Alabama, Missouri) (1816-1821). 
“The third and most wonderful era of westward expansion (1835-1848) carried our 
boundary across the Rockies and Sierras to the Pacific Ocean.” 
Keep in mind the importance of the connection between westward expansion and 
slavery. 
1. Texas: : 
The study of Texas and the war with Mexico will bring out two interesting men 
—‘Davy” Crockett and Sam Houston. Keep clearly in mind the American claims 
against Mexico. By the treaty of 1819 we had relinquished Texas. Senator Ben- 
ton, of Missouri, the Congressional champion of the far West said in Congress “with 
true western passion” —“The magnificent valley of the Mississippi is ours, with all 
its fountains, springs and floods, and woe to the statesman who shall undertake to 
surrender one drop of its water, one inch of its soil, to any foreign power.” He was 
ready for a war with Spain, believing that it would give the United States the Floridas 
and Cuba; and that it would “free the New from the Old World.” The United 
States was willing then to relinquish any claim to Texas that it might gain Florida 
(1820). Later we made attempts under Adams and Jackson to buy Texas, for al- 
ready it was filled with many of our people carrying on life just as it was carried on 
in the Southern states. Texas fought against her Mexican rulers and became in- 
dependent; then she asked to be admitted into the Union as a state. Texas was ad- 
mitted in 1845; and a war with Mexico followed which resulted in our acquiring 
California and New Mexico for which we paid 18 million dollars to the Mexican gov- 
ernment (1848). 
Sam Houston deliberately settled in Mexico to help plan a revolt of the Americans 
against Mexico. He was elected Commander-in-Chief of the Texan troops. In the 
attack on the Alamo, an old Texan fortress at San Antonio, David Crockett, a dar- 
ing Tennessee hunter and marksman, lost his life after a desperate hand to hand strug- 
gle with the men of Santa Anna’sarmy. It will interest the class to know that Ulysses 
S. Grant and Robert E. Lee fought in the war with Mexico in 1848. 
2. Oregon: 
Oregon’s story is that of the “fur trader, missionary and settler.” As early as 
1792 Captain Gray with a Boston trading ship sailed into the Columbia river; Lewis  
-P-A-G-E-536
    
526 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
and Clark, by exploring the Louisiana territory, strengthened the claims of the United 
States to the Oregon territory. John Jacob Astor attempted to plant a trading post 
at Astoria which his men treacherously turned over to the British at the opening of 
the War of 1812; the British rechristened it Fort George. South along the coast 
Spanish Missions at San Diego, Monterey and San Francisco sold hides and tallow to 
Yankee trading ships on their way to China for the products of the East. Routes 
across the continent from St. Louis to the Platte, the Green, the Yellowstone and 
the Snake Rivers were being found, and a wagon route through the Rockies was made 
from Salt Lake, across the Sierras, and the deserts of Nevada and Utah to the coast. 
Lectures on the Oregon Country and its riches were (in 1830) being given in New 
England. In 1832 Nathaniel Wyeth of Cambridge, Massachusetts, led a party of 
New Englanders to establish a trading and fishing post on the Columbia River. 
Missionaries and their families soon followed. Among them was Rey. Marcus 
Whitman. Mr. Whitman took a wagon through South Pass and over the mountains 
to the Snake River, and began an agricultural colony which about 6000 persons had 
joined by 1843. The United States had, in 1818, made a treaty with England for 
joint occupation of the territory with the. understanding that either country could 
bring the agreement to an end by giving the other a year’s notice. This, in 1846, 
President Polk did; and England, yielding to our claim, withdrew and left us a terri- 
tory as large as Texas which included the States of Oregon, Washington, Montana, 
and Wyoming. 
3. John C. Fremont, the “‘ Pathfinder” and his guide, ‘‘ Kit” Carson: 
When it became evident that many explorers from the Eastern States were emigrat- 
ing to the Oregon Country, Congress sent (because of Senator Benton’s persuasions) 
Lieut. Fremont “‘to explore the West for the best pass through the Rocky Moun- 
tains that would accommodate the oncoming emigration.”” With “Kit” Carson, a 
famous hunter, for guide, he explored the South Pass and found it easy for traveling 
purposes. The next year he went out again to find other paths and reached as far 
south as the Missions of Monterey in California. He stopped at Captain Sutter’s 
Fort on his way to Monterey and afterward returned to the fort where he succeeded 
in protecting and aiding the Americans in California until the Mexican War was 
over. 
4. Gold and the rush for the Pacific—‘ The Forty-niners” :— 
On the very day the treaty of peace was signed with Mexico, when California be- 
came a territory of the United States, gold was discovered at Sutter’s Fort (Jan., 
1848). The children can compare stories their fathers and grandfathers have to tell 
of the rush for the Klondike with the stories of the famous “1849” rush to the Pacific. 
In one year the population of California increased from 6000 to over 85,000 souls. 
Says Muzzey: “The ‘Forty-niners,’ as these gold seekers were called, came almost 
wholly from the free states of the North. Migration across thousands of miles of 
desert country did not tempt the plantation owner with his slaves. Consequently, 
when delegates from the new California immigrants met at Monterey, in September, 
1849, at the call of the military governor, Riley, to devise a constitution, they drew 
up a constitution excluding slavery by a unanimous vote.” 
And those immigrants—“ Merchants, farmers, physicians, lawyers, artisans, shop- 
keepers, and servants abandoned their business to stake out claims in the gold valleys 
from which thousands took their fortunes in a few weeks. The fever extended even 
to the Atlantic coast. Men started on the nine months’ sail around Cape Horn, or, 
crossing the pestilence-laden Isthmus of Panama, fought like wild animals for a 
passage on the infrequent ships sailing up the Californian coast. Others went

‘overland,’ making their way slowly across the Western deserts and mountains in 
their unwieldy ‘prairie schooners,’ the monotonous dread of famine and thirst varied 
only by the excitement of Indian attacks.” (Muzzey: American History, pp. 356- 
357.) 
XI. The North and South quarrel over the extenston of slavery to the 
territories. 
Incidentally, from many of the preceding stories, the child has gained some know- 
ledge of the slavery question in the States and in the Territories. The teacher might 
go back even to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and recall that no slavery. was al- 
lowed there. This may bring up the question as to what was done about slavery in 
the Louisiana territory; in Texas, in Oregon, and in California. 
This story may have to include a simple explanation of the Missouri Compromise, 
the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854. (See outline for 
Eighth Grade.) It is certainly possible that fifth grade children, if the history- 
lessons are well planned for developing thoughtful questions from the children may 
have asked such questions as “‘What did Benjamin Franklin think of Slavery?” 
“Did Patrick Henry have slaves?” ‘Of course, Jefferson and Washington had 
slaves, but did they really believe in slavery’?’ 
The names of three men will stand out prominently in this discussion of the terri- 
torial regions: Henry Clay, the ‘“‘Pacificator”’; John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, 
a firm sectionalist, and a “States Rights” man; and Daniel Webster of Massachu- 
setts, the staunch “Nationalist.” 
Make these three figures stand out clearly and let the class see them, debating the 
vital question on the “floor of Congress.” Show their pictures to the class, tell a 
few incidents that will reveal the character of each man, and in a simple, concrete 
way give both sides of the sectional feeling regarding slavery. 
1. Henry Clay the “Mill Boy of the Slashes.” 
Born in Virginia in the sections of the “‘slashes”’ (Patrick Henry’s. section also); 
his parents; his meager education; his removal to Richmond; his work in a mercantile 
house there; his clerkship with the celebrated lawyer, Chancellor George Wythe; 
his determination to become a lawyer; his removal to Lexington, Kentucky, then a 
frontier town; his power to defend criminals; one of the “young Republicans” dur- 
ing the War of 1812; his long and interesting career in Congress: his interest in the 
Cumberland Road; his interest in the question of slavery in the territories; his part 
in the Missouri Compromise not failing to avoid the error which attributes to him the 
authorship of the Thomas Amendment which proposed the line of 36° 30’; his person- 
al characteristics—manner, power of his speeches. Schurz, Henry Clay. 
2. John C. Calhoun: 
Born near Abbeville, South Carolina; his early education; his later education at 
Yale University; at the law school of Litchfield, Connecticut; his views on the leading 
questions of the day; an example of the Southern sectionalist as John Quincy Adams 
was of the Northern, his debates with Clay and Webster in Congress. Hunt’s 
Calhoun. 
3. Daniel Webster: . 
Born among the hills of New Hampshire; his parents; his sisters and brothers; the 
“‘woodchuck story;” his interest in nature; his love for books; his education at Phil- 
lips Exeter Academy and Dartmouth College: his removal to Boston, Massachu- 
setts, where he became a lawyer famous for his speeches and debates, the most famous 
of which was that with Senator Hayne of South Carolina on the floor of the Senate; 
the effect of his personality and his speeches together.

The following information taken from Muzzey, pp. 358-359, may help the teacher 
to keep the question of this time clear in her own mind for, unless she is herself per- 
fectly clear about the compromises and the Kansas-Nebraska bill, she cannot hope 
to make the subject clear to children. (This, of course, must be an oral explanation, 
adapted to the intelligence of the class.) 
Compromise of 1850.—The Missouri Compromise (1820) had excluded slavery from 
the Louisiana territory, north of 36° 30’. The following table shows the questions 
that were being angrily debated about 1848-50, and the demands of each side: 
(Muzzey, p. 359). 
Question of 
(1) California 
(2) New Mexico 
(3) Texas 
(4) District of Co- 
lumbia 
(5) Fugitive slaves The South demanded 
organization as a territory, 
admitting slavery 
legalization of slavery by 
Congress (at least below 
36° 30’) 
the same boundaries as the 
Texan republic claimed in 
1836 
no interference with slavery 
by Congress 
a strict law enforced by na- 
tional authority, with no The North demanded 
immediate admission as a free 
state 
the application of the Wil- 
mot Proviso 
a reduction in the size of 
Texas without any money 
compensation 
abolition of slavery 
jury trial for every negro 
claimed as a fugitive slave 
jury trial for negroes 
“The debates on the compromise measures called forth some of the finest speeches 
ever made in the Senate.” 
“Clay proposed that (1) California should be admitted as a free state; (2) the rest of 
the Mexican cession should be divided by the thirty-seventh parallel of latitude into 
the territories of Utah on the north and New Mexico on the south, both organized 
on the “‘squatter-sovereignty” principle; (3) the boundaries of the slaveholding state 
of Texas should be cut down from 379,000 to 264,000 square miles, but in return 
Texas should receive $10,000,000 from the government to pay her war debt con- 
tracted before 1845; (4) the slave trade (but not slavery) should be prohibited in the 
District of Columbia; (5) a new fugitive-slave law should be enacted, making the re- 
covery of runaway negroes much easier than under the old law of 1793. This meas- 
ure of Clay’s was called the ‘Omnibus Bill,’ on account of the number of provisions 
which it included.” Lodge, Daniel Webster. 
XII. One Nation or Two? : 
The quarrel over the territories broke out afresh when Douglas introduced the 
Kansas-Nebraska bill (1854) which upset completely the terms of the Missouri Com- 
promise. Clay, Calhoun and Webster now are all dead and the politics of the coun- 
try are in the hands of other men. 
For the first period of this topic, say 1850-1860, two persons will stand out as 
representing the opinion of the two sections of the country: Abraham Lincoln and 
Jefferson Davis. 
1. Abraham Lincoln: 
For an interesting account of his life see Helen Nicolay: The Boy’s Life of Abra- 
ham Lincoln. The story should bring out a clear and simple idea of fugitive slaves, 
the Dred-Scott decision, the “Underground Railroad,” and the Lincoln-Douglas 
debates.
-P-A-G-E-539
HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 529 
2. Jefferson Davis: 
Probably the best account for our purposes of the life of Jefferson Davis are those 
of Oliver Dyer: Personal Recollections of Jefferson Davis; W. E. Dodd: Life of Jeff- 
erson Davis; Trent: Southern Statesmen of the Old Regime. 
This story should bring out the idea of a state seceding from the Union, and the 
principles for which the Southern Confederacy with Jefferson Davis as its president, 
stood. 
The declaration of war and the events of the Civil War make Gen. Ulysses S. 
Grant and Gen. Robert E. Lee stand forth as the most prominent figures. 
3. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant: 
His characteristics as a man and a soldier; emphasize his determination, bull- 
dog persistence, and fertility of resource. The siege of Vicksburg well illustrates his 
qualities. How he rose to be commander-in-chief and won thé war. 
REFERENCE: Johnston’s Leading American Soldiers (Holt), pp. 137-193. 
Gen. Robert E. Lee: 
4, His characteristics, his soldiers’ love for him; his leadership of the southern army 
—(a) defense of Richmond; (b) Chancellorsville; (c) Gettysburg; opposing Grant in 
the closing year of the war. Bring out Lee’s charm as a man; his conscientiousness, 
his reluctance to leave the Union and refusal to accept chief command of the Federal 
armies; his brilliance, dash, and ingenuity as a soldier; his sensible and noble attitude 
at the close of the war. 
REFERENCE: Johnston’s Leading American Soldiers, pp. 256-311. 
XIII. The progress of the Age of Machinery. 
Part of this topic will have been touched upon in the industrial arts periods; part 
in the discussion of current events; part in geography. The history periods should, 
then, organize the disjointed information and trace the historical development of 
the various inventions showing the influence of each upon life today. 
1, The Trans-continental railroads. 
REFERENCE: Paxson, The New Nation, p. 25. 
2. How electricity aids home life, travel, transportation, trade. 
a. Lighting by electricity; Thomas Edison. 
b. Hearing by electricity; Alexander Bell and the telephone. 
c. A new language by electricity; “Wireless” and Guglielmo Marconi. 
d. Riding by electricity; trolley-cars, railroads, automobiles. 
3. The flying machine and the automobile: How the gas engine made them possible: 
The Wright brothers and the aeroplane. (See the July, 1915, “St. Nicholas” for 
“What everyone should know about the aeroplane”.) Growing uses for the auto- 
mobile. 
4. Bessemer and the steel industry (steel, iron, coal): 
Growth of cities; the skyscrapers, a type of building peculiarly American; apart- 
ment houses; great bridge constructions; etc. 
5. The building of the Panama Canal—Colonel Goethals: 
The story should bring out the topic of civic sanitation and the great work and 
sacrifice of Jesse William Lazear who gave his life for the cure of yellow fever in the 
West Indies. Upon Lazear’s work was based that of Col. William C. Gorgas in 
ridding the canal zone of the mosquito and malarial fever. (Connect this with the 
campaign in Baltimore against mosquitoes under the direction of Colonel Gorgas, 
1915.)
-P-A-G-E-540
  
530 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
6. Immigration and some problems it has brought: 
Ellis Island; making Americans out of immigrants at Hull House, Chicago, and 
Jane Addams’ great work there: 
This topic should trace the development of immigration from colonial times to 
the present. In that sense it will be a review, recalling the early German and Scotch 
Trish immigrants; the influx of large numbers of Chinese for work on the transconti- 
nental railroads; etc. Bring out the changing nature of the problems’ of today— 
Hungarians, Poles, Russians, and Italians from Eastern and Southern Europe. 
7. The American “ Workers:” Labor Unions. 
This is a topic that will touch the life of every child in our schools. The news- 
papers of the day tell of strikes in the great industrial plants; the “I. W. W.” holds 
meetings in every large city and the newspapers print notices of their meetings; great 
corporations like the Standard Oil Company, the Ford Automobile Co., etc., are known 
objectively at least through the products they turn out for man’s use; in many of the 
families represented by the pupils in our schools there are men who belong to labor 
unions, men who employ men who belong to labor unions, men who are clerks for big 
corporations that employ hundreds of employees. Here and there, all along the way 
from the ‘‘Period of Discovery”’ in the Fourth Grade to the close of the ‘Progress 
of the Age of Machinery” in the Fifth Grade /abor in some form has been discussed. 
The children themselves can get a great deal of the information for the current phases 
of this topic from their parents at home, from the daily newspapers and from the 
industrial arts topics. For the teacher who wishes some help on the topic probably 
the best reference is Carlton, History and Problems of Organized Labor (Heath), 
dealing chiefly with the American situation. Brief chapters on the labor movement 
may be found in recent treatises on economics, e. g., Seager, Principles of Economics 
(Holt, 1914). 
XIV. United States gains “‘over-sea’’ possessions: 
1. The purchase of Alaska: 
2. The Spanish-American War: 
This is such recent history that the pupils themselves will surely be able to 
bring to school stories their mothers and fathers, their uncles and aunts, their grand- 
fathers and grandmothers tell about the “War with Spain.” ‘The sole aim of the 
United States was to put a stop to a condition of affairs in the Island of Cuba that 
had become intolerable” says Dr. Latane. By the terms of the treaty, Spain ceded 
to the United States, Porto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, the United States pay- 
ing $20,000,000 for the Philippines. 
3. How the United States has dealt with other countries: 
Her peace policy and her part in the International Peace movement. (The 
School Peace League (Boston, Mass.) publishes much material that may be obtained 
without cost. See also Gulliver, The Friendship of Nations, Ginn & Co.) 
Evidence of her peace policy is shown by the frequency with which she has arbi- 
trated many questions: e.g., numerous claims of her citizens against foreign States; 
the Alabama claims; Alaskan Boundary with England; Newfoundland fisheries with 
England; etc. 
The “open door’’ policy in China—John Hay. 
If any child should bring up in class the question of the ‘Monroe Doctrine” it will 
be possible to explain it simply: President Monroe, in a message to Congress said 
that the U. S. does not meddle in the affairs of Europe, and he thought European
-P-A-G-E-541
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 531 
nations should not meddle with any independent country of the new world, or try 
to plant any more colonies. See MacDonald’s Documentary Source Book of Ameri- 
can History, No. 80. 
The principle of the “freedom of the seas” for which the United States fought 
in 1812 is still before us in the great European War of 1914-. President Wilson in 
a message to Germany declares that the United States will always contend for the 
freedom of the seas ‘‘ without compromise and at any cost.” 
Where to Get Material: Attention is called to the fact that 
the work of the Fourth and Fifth Grades covers the same general 
field as that of the Seventh and Eighth. The topics are of course 
different and their treatment must be widely different to be ap- 
propriate to the younger children, yet to accomplish good work the 
teacher of the lower grades must know a great deal more than is given 
in the thin little stories that are so often considered good enough 
for children, and must have a better sense of proportion and con- 
tinuity than she could obtain by studying a few selected stories 
to be given the class. It is strongly urged that teachers of the lower 
grades make a careful study of the topical outlines for teachers of 
Grades Seven and Eight. The main sources of information are 
the same, and lower grade teachers are referred to the list of bibliog- 
raphies in the introductory section, p.495, and to the references 
at the end of the Eighth Grade course. Throughout the Fifth 
Grade course frequent references are given to reliable works in 
which more or less extensive information may be obtained about 
the topics assigned. It is realized that this field is a large one, that 
the teachers cannot with their other work be special students of 
the subject, and that the course is very largely a new one for the 
grade. The teacher cannot make all her preparation the first year, 
but she should have in mind from the first the absolute necessity 
for much study outside the common school text-books and readers, 
if she is to make her work interesting and valuable. 
N. B.—Credit and great praise must be given the group of forty fifth grade teach- 
ers who worked with the zest of research students, during the year 1916-1917, to 
gather together a body of concrete historical data to add to the course of study. 
The material was mimeographed (about100 typed pages) and given out to the Fifth 
and Seventh Grade teachers for the fields of those two grades are, in part, the same. 
The following types of materials will show the character of their concreteness and 
vividness. 
Peter Faneuil’s letters. 
Extracts from The Boston Post. 
Drake: Tea Leaves of 1773. 
Newspapers of Revolutionary times:

SIXTH GRADE 
“The pupil should never be allowed to forget that America is the 
child of European civilization, that it received a great heritage of 
laws and traditions, and that its own life is unintelligible save as it 
appears in its place in the history of the world.”—Bourne. 
The work of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Grades should pre- 
sent one continuous story. The first part, that for the Sixth, pre- 
sents the European beginnings of American civilization, discloses 
how and why the New World was discovered by the Old, and shows 
America as the heir of Europe. 
Read carefully and critically “The Teaching of History in the 
Grammar Grades: Some Suggestions,” pp. 473-500. 
Outlined in the large, the course covers the following topics: 
UA. Greece, the first great European teacher. 
5 Il. “Rome, Mistress of an enduring world empire.” 
4111. How Germany and France ‘began. 
IV. England in the Middle Ages. 
“-V. Life in the Middle Ages. 
“VI. Great changes bring about the beginnings of our own times. 
‘VII. The expansion of Europe and the beginning of America. 
European Ancestors of America 
I. Greece the First Great European Teacher: 
1. Greece, the sailor’s country: 
The climate; the soil; the size; the sea; the sea in old Greek stories; some famous 
mythical sailors; these topics will bring out how the early Greeks regarded the Medi- 
terranean and the regions of the world unknown to them. 
“Greece is a sailor’s country. Long arms of bays cut into the land and invite men 
to try the gentle water. Long points of land jut into the sea like ships’ prows, and 
islands close together beckon a boat from one to another out from the mainland. So 
Greeks very early became seafaring people.”—Hall: Europe, the Mother of America.

HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 533 
“We are taught from early youth to divide the world into continents and are apt 
to think of the Mediterranean, which washes three of the five, as marking a bound- 
ary line between Europe, Asia and Africa. . . . This view is natural enough in 
London, but appears strange in Constantinople, where business men cross twice 
daily, in suburban steamers, from one continent to the other. It has always been 
misleading from the point of view of physical geography, for the countries round 
the Mediterranean form, both structurally and climatically, a distinct region of the 
world’s surface. But it is historically and politically misleading also. . . . For 
to the Greeks the Mediterranean area was always a unity and the Mediterranean 
itself not a frontier, but a highway; they saw the world as ‘a rim of convergent 
coastlands encircling the Midland Sea, which is our Sea.’ ‘Our Sea’ or ‘This Sea’ 
was indeed their only name for-it. With the countries immediately around it they 
were tolerably familiar; but the Hinterland beyond, which differed in climate, struc- 
ture and manners, always remained to them mysterious. 
“Every Englishman is familiar with ‘the sea;’ but the sea of the Greeks is not the 
sea that we know. Landlocked on all sides, as its name implies, except for the nar- 
row exits at Gibraltar and the Dardanelles, the Mediterranean seems in summer as 
gentle as an inland lake. Yet to call it a lake is to belie its possibilities. It is in 
fact double-natured, sometimes a lake far better adapted to oars than to sails, some- 
times an ocean, not adapted, as a timid Greek navigator might say, for either; or, 
to put it in his own language, a lake when the gods are kind and an ocean when they 
are spiteful.”—Zimmern, The Greek Commonwealth. 
2. Greece expands to the far-away shores of the Mediterranean World; its colonies: — 
Reasons for expansion; early explorers; Greek ships; the peoples of the Eastern 
Mediterranean; the peoples of the Western Mediterranean; Greek trade; trading 
posts and “‘factories;” starting colonies; the towns on the Black Sea, “Magna 
Graecia;”’ the Gallic settlements—(‘‘Spain the California of those days”) the fringe 
of colonies on the Africian coast; “Hellenizing”’ the tribes around the settlements. 
(The Rhone, the Po, and the Nile Rivers were the only highways into the hinter- 
land.) 
3. The growing Greek cities; differences among them:— 
Sparta, the soldier’s city; Aegina the sailor’s city; Corinth, the “merchant town;” 
Athens, the “Beautiful,” the city of great poets, artists, orators, and generals. 
Bring out, very simply, the characteristics of life in several different types of cities 
in order to get at the character of the Greek people as a whole. Upon the child’s 
understanding of this will depend his understanding of why the different Greek cities 
acted as they did when concerted action was necessary. 
Life in Sparta and Athens should be studied in detail. Let the class really live the 
life of the city:—city scenes; the city wall (Sparta had none); great statues and build- 
ings; streets; houses: the market place; the people; the home itself; schools; the pub- 
lic games on the Olympian field; the government; famous Spartans; famous Athen- 
ians. 
(Athens’ trade will bring out the fact that though three miles from the coast, she 
had a port, Piraeus, with which she was connected by a long lane with high strong 
straight walls on both sides, the famous “‘Long Walls.” Piraeus was an important 
point both for trade and war. Themistocles planned and built it in preparation 
for the great war with Persia.) 
There is a chance here to use some well selected source material. Asan example of 
this—Webster: Readings in Ancient History, pp. 98-102, gives Plutarch’s account
-P-A-G-E-544
534 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
of Alcibiades’ boyhood and youth, which might be used to advantage with sixth 
grade children, to show some details of education and the customs of the times. 
4. How the Greeks governed: 
Many questions relating to government will have been brought out in the discus- 
sion of liie in the great cities but the subject should be treated somewhat more fully 
than the other topics have made possible. 
a. Old tribal days: council of elders, assembly of fighting men, chieftain who in 
time becomes a shepherd king. “Germs of later European political institutions 
and even of our own in the United States today”’ (Robinson and Breasted, p. 129). 
b.. Rise of the city-state, ‘‘the only nation which the Greeks knew. Each city- 
state was a sovereign power; each had its own laws, its own army and gods, and 
each citizen felt a patriotic duty toward his own city and no other.” King, coun- 
cil, assembly. The stronghold on the acropolis. Close relation of religion and 
government. King as ruler, judge, general, and priest. Disorder often existed. 
c. How some men came to be large landholders, and formed a class of heredi- 
tary nobles. Their control of council, dominance in the government, oppres- . 
sion of the poor. The “tyrants” how they gained power, methods of govern- 
ing. ‘Age of Tyrants:” 
“As a group, the leaders of this age made an impression upon the mind of the 
people which never entirely disappeared. 
“They were the earliest statesmen in Greece, if not in history, and some of them 
were led by high-minded motives in their control of the Greek states. The people 
loved to quote their sayings, such as ‘Know thyself,’ a proverb which was carved 
over the entrance of the Apollo temple at Delphi; or Solon’s wise maxim, ‘Overdo 
nothing.’ There came to be collections of such sayings, and the most famous of 
the men of the age were grouped together as the ‘Seven. Wise men.’—{Solon of 
Athens, Periander of Corinth, Chilon of Sparta, Thales of Miletus, Pittacus of 
Mitylene, Bias of Priene, and Cleobulus of Lindus.) 
“The Age of the Tyrants was a period of unprecedented progress among the 
Hellenes, in industries, in commerce, and in the higher life which we call civiliza- 
tion.” (Robinson and Breasted: Outlines of European History, pp. 158-159.) 
d. Rise of democracies; how aided by tyrannies. 
e. Study of development of political institutions in Athens, one of the leading 
cities, as a type—kingship, aristocracy, wealth and the oligarchy, tyranny, demo- 
cracy. Archons. Draco and written laws. Solon and his reforms, relation of 
government to social problems— 
“The verses of Solon (which in a later day when the Greeks had begun to write 
prose would have taken the form of political speeches) pictured the distressing con- 
dition of the Attic people with startling effect. . . . Tosave the peasants, he 
declared void all mortgages on land and all claims of creditors which endangered 
the liberty of a citizen. . . . Furthermore, citizens who had been sold into 
foreign slavery to satisfy such claims Solon repurchased at the cost of the State, 
and they returned as free men to Attica. But Solon was a true statesman, and 
to the demands of the lower classes for a new apportionment of lands held by 
the eupatrids he would not yield. He did, however, set a limit to the amount of 
land which a noble might hold. 
}. “Further, he proclaimed a constitution which gave all but the very lowest class- 
es a voice in the control of the State. It was not democratic, for it recognized an 
aristocracy of birth. There were three political classes according to income.
-P-A-G-E-545
  HISTORY—FIFTH GRADE 535 
Only the men who belonged to the first class, with the largest income (five hundred 
measures of grain, or of oil and wine together), could hold the highest offices in the 
State; but the humblest free craftsman could vote in the Assembly of the people. 
Otherwise, the established institutions were little changed by Solon. He left also 
a written code of law by which all free men were for the first time given equal 
rights in the courts. Some of these laws have descended to our own time and are 
still in force. 
“Solon is the first Greek statesman of whom we obtain an authentic picture, 
chiefly through those poems of his which have survived to our day.”” Robinson 
and Breasted, pp. 155-7, 
“The most fatal defect in Greek character was the inability of these states to 
forget their local differences and jealousies and to unite into a common federation 
or great nation including all Greeks.” Robinson and Breasted, p. 134. 
5. Greece and her neighbor Persia fight for world power:— 
“Just at this point when the Greek was standing on the threshold of a new world, 
the Persian hosts suddenly advanced to the Aegean Sea and absorbed the Ionian 
* cities.” Had the Greeks developed the power to throw off this great Asiatic foe? 
Greece had two foes: one in the West, Carthage,—another in the East, Persia. 
Bring out characteristics of Persian life; study pictures of the great Persian temples 
and give enough details to show why Persia was a dangerous enemy of Greece: 
King Darius; Battle of Marathon, “which the Athenians celebrated as their bravest 
victory for hundreds of years;” the work of Themistocles in preparing Greece for 
the next onslaught of Persia which he knew would come by sea; the long wait for 
the Persians (they were installing their new King, Xerxes); Thermopylae; the Battle 
of Salamis (480 B.C.); the end of the struggle—‘‘ Athens the queen of the sea and the 
savior of the Greeks.” 
6. The “Age of Pericles;” the glory of Greece.” — 
The Delian Confederacy; Pericles’ great imperialistic dream to make Athens the 
“head of a noble Greek empire;”’ his thirty years of progress; the jealousy of the 
other cities, particularly Sparta; the war between Sparta and her allies, and Athens 
and her allies—‘‘the whole Greek world from the Aegean islands to Magna Graecia 
was dragged into it;” Athens forced to submit to Sparta. 
Discussion of progress and social life in the Age of Pericles will make the names of 
Phidias, the great sculptor and architect (who built the wonderfully beautiful Parth- 
enon); Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus, the great writers of tragedy; Aristo- 
phanes, writer of comedies: Socrates and the Sophists; Herodotus, the “Father of 
History” and Thucydides, historian of the Peloponnesian war—stand out and their 
personalities should live again in the class-room. 
7. Sparta becomes the leader of Greece. 
8. Thebes takes on the leadership, and breaks Sparta’s power:— 
Epaminondas, the great commander and creator of the Theban navy; breaking 
Sparta’s power: “‘holding Athens in check on the sea.” 
But it is a ‘one man power’ and at Epaminondas’ death, neither Athens, Sparta, 
nor Thebes could resist a conqueror from the outside. 
9. Alexander the Great of Macedon, conquers Greece and the great East. 
Macedon’s growing power; King Philip (350 B. C.); Demosthenes the great 
orator and his burning appeals to the Athenians; the young Alexander; Ar-

andria; ‘‘Hellenizing” the world. The three centuries following the death of Alex- 
ander (323 B. C.) are termed the “‘Hellenistic Age”, for Greek ways, with Alexandria 
as the center of distribution, were being adopted and modified by all the peoples 
of the world. At the same time “the culture of the Orient” gradually began to 
change Greek thought. Several Greek scientists are of interest—Euclid, great 
geometer; Ptolemy, the geographer; Hippocrates, “Father of Medicine;” Eratos- 
thenes, who calculated the circumference of the earth and was very close to correct. 
10. Enduring Greek influences upon our present civilization. 
The work and method of the Greek architects and sculptors; the Greek 
idea of beauty; Greek literary ideals; the science of grammar; the alphabet; Greek 
philosophy; many of the principles of geometry; Greek ideals of athletics. 
“The Greeks had brought the world to a higher level of civilization than 
men had ever seen before, but they had not been able to unite and organize it. 
Not even their own Hellas was a unified nation. The world which the Greeks, 
as successors of the Orient, had civilized was now to be organized and unified by a 
uch less gifted but more practical race, whose city on the Tiber was destined to 
become the mistress of an enduring world empire.’’ Robinson and Breasted, p. 239. ° 
II. Rome, “Mistress of an enduring world empire,’ organized the 
ancient Mediterranean world and spread civilization. 
1. The beginnings of the city of Rome: 
Its location in the Mediteranean world; Romans, a part of the Latin tribe 
(one of many tribes of Italy); Rome’s fortunate location on the hills overlooking 
the Tiber; a good harbor; neighbors; her busy dock (the ships of Greece and Etruria 
there, Roman ships in time built with these as models); Roman gods; kings. 
“The Greek merchants bring written invoices and bills. The Romans, unable 
to read them at first, are slowly learning to spell them out, and thus finally to recog- 
nize a Greek word here and there. Ere long they are scribbling memoranda of their 
own transactions in these Greek letters, which in this way become likewise the 
Roman alphabet, slightly changed of course to suit the Latin language used in Rome. 
It is this alphabet which descended from the Orient through Rome to us. 
“The Greek merchant on the dock has a sack full of copper coins and a smaller 
purse filled with silver ones. These too the Roman tradesman learns to use, against 
the day when his own city shall begin to coin them. He is obliged to accept also 
the measures of bulk and of length with which the Greek measures out to him the 
things he buys. The peasant hears the merchants on the dock speaking Greek. 
He too learns the Greek words for the clothing offered for sale, for household utensils 
and pottery and other things connected with traffic. These words become part of 
the daily fund of Roman speech. 
“The Latin peasant looks on with wonderment at all this world of civilized life 
of which he knows so little—a world in which these clever Greeks seem so much 
at home.” (Robinson and Breasted, pp. 249-251.) 
2. Rome becomes a republic: 
It is an imperial republic; ruled by nobles—(‘“‘patricians’”’), and developed 
much like the government of Greece: (a) a written code of laws engraved on twelve 
tables of bronze: (b) Senate, a council of old men who largely controlled affairs; 
(c) two Consuls, elective magistrates of the same power; (d) the peasantry (“‘ple- 
‘beians”) composed of the people of the district immediately surrounding the city. 
A story of the Roman Forum can be made to bring out many of the details 
of political and social life of the time: occupations, dress, business, religion, pol-
-P-A-G-E-547
  
  ™ HISTORY—SIXTH GRADE 537 
itics, the army, a Triumph, etc. (See Lovell: Stories in Stone From the Roman 
Forum.) In addition, there should be a detailed study of life within a Roman 
home. (See Johnson: Private Life of the Romans.) 
3. Rome conquers all Italy: 
Border wars; Etruscan wars; wars with the Gauls, with the Samnites; with 
the cities in Magna Graecia; “‘Sometimes she was beaten in the bloody battle, 
but in general she won and kept adding new lands to her territory until she was 
mistress of all the land from the Arno River to the southern tip of the country— 
a great territory 500 miles long.”—Hall. 
Then followed the business of establishing Roman rule in the conquered terri- 
tory, building military roads and organizing an army so that she might keep 
what she had gained. Money from trade with all parts of the country begins to 
be a power. (There is opportunity for much good map-work in this topic.) 
4. Rome and her neighbor Carthage compete for commercial supremacy: 
Relative strength and weakness of the two; Carthage, ‘‘Mistress of the seas,” 
boasted that a Roman could not wash his hands in the sea without asking her per- 
mission; the fleets of Carthage and her dominions; Sicily “‘a stepping stone be- 
tween the two countries” becomes the first ‘‘bone of contention;” a war twenty 
years long gave Sicily to Rome; again after more than twenty years they contend 
again, this time for Spain, and Hannibal is defeated; Spain is added to Roman 
territory;—once more they contend for all the rest of the Carthaginian colonies— 
this time on the shores of Africa. Carthage is destroyed. 
“A new empire—Italy, Sicily, Spain, Africa, and the islands of the sea—had 
grown up in the West, and Rome was mistress of it.” 
5. Many changes creep into Roman life because of her “world dominion”: 
Influx of Greek slaves and captives of war from the Greek cities in Italy 
and Sicily; the capitalists; Greek slaves become teachers of Roman children who 
learn to read Greek and to love Homer; one or two of these famous Greek teachers; 
sending Roman youths to Athens to receive a Greek education; Horace, the Roman 
poet, said that Rome, the conquerer, was being conquered by the civilization of 
the Greeks. Books, music, works of art, and architecture—these the Romans 
borrowed from the Greeks; and they spent their own efforts in building up “‘a 
more stable and powerful organization than any devised by the Greeks.” This 
topic will show how military power began to undermine Roman institutions: 
Marius and Sulla; the rise of Julius Caesat; Pompey. 
6. Pompey makes Rome mistress of the Eastern Mediterranean. 
“By the year 60 B. C. most of Alexander’s huge empire was in Roman 
hands;”—the effect upon Rome of coming in contact with the “‘richest and most 
cultured people of the world.” 
7. The conquest of Gaul: 
Caesar extends the boundaries on the west to the Rhine River and to Brit- 
ain: 
XK war with barbarians; conditions of the vast hordes of barbarians in West- 
ern Europe; Rome now becomes the teacher; Caesar in Britain; Caesar writes the 
wept his “conquest;’’ the effect of the conquest upon the Roman people. 
‘he Gallic wars afford an opportunity for using the constructive activities 
of the sixth grade child; they might build a miniature Roman camp showing the 
military conditions and reproducing many of the weapons used in the warfare of 
that time. . °

8. The Great Roman Empire: Rome rules the world: 
Caesar, “Dictator” for life, the first emperor; the Age of Be een eee 
science, social life, travel, education. 
“The population of this vast Empire, which girdled the Mediterranean, in- 
cluding France and England, was made up of the most diverse peoples and races. 
Egyptians, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Italians, Gauls, Britons, Iberians (Spaniards)— 
all alike were under the sovereign rule of Rome. One great state embraced the nomad 
shepherds who spread their tents on the borders of the Sahara, the mountaineer 
in the fastnesses of Wales, and the citizens of Athens, Alexandria, and Rome, heirs 
of all the luxury and learning of the ages. Whether one lived in York or Jerusalem, 
Memphis or Vienna, he paid his taxes into the same treasury, he was tried by the 
same law, and looked to the same armies for protection.”’ (Robinson and Breasted. _ 
Outlines of European History, pp. 276-277.) eae 
9. A new religion in the Roman world; the coming of Christianity: 
Beginnings; Christian martyrs; missionaries; power and growth; a Christian 
emperor, Constantine—the ‘‘triumph of Christianity.” 
10. Rome’s power declines: 
11. Enduring influences of Rome upon our present civilization: 
She unified the whole Mediteranean world under one Empire, thus brought 
together the contributions of all to civilization; her principles of law and govern- 
ment—‘the idea of an absolute ruler, organ izeand centralized government, 
generous adoption of foreigners, laws and the habit of obeying law.” (Hall, Europe, 
the Mother of America.) The idea of “good roads,’ their value and the process 
of their construction. 
III. How Germany and France began. 
/ 1. The barbarians of the North invade the Empire and complete the work of break- 
ing it up. 
The German tribes—Franks, Vandals, Goths, Burgundians, Saxons, Lom- 
bard’s (See Tacitus’ description, Leaflet No. A 27, McKinley Co.’s Illustrated 
Topics for Ancient History); how they fought; the Goths under Alaric conquer 
Rome, and spread into Gaul (France); the scorn of the “Gallic gentlemen” for 
these, barbarians; the Franks, become Christians under Clovis, conquer parts of 
the old Roman Empire: Charlemagne, king of the Franks. 
2. Charlemagne and his great Empire: 
Charlemagne’s wars, his laws; the Frankish assemblies (held twice a year, 
first in one city, then in another); education; books; his people’s love for him; 
reforms and progress; his enemies, the Northmen. 
Let the pupils read parts of Einhard’s life of Charlemagne; it is simply told 
and isacontemporary account of the great man, Einhard being Charlemagne’s 
son-in-law. 
3. The beginnings of Germany and France. 
Charlemagne’s death; the dividing of his empire; East Frankland—Germany; 
West Frankland—France; the Mohammedans appear; growing power of he 
Northmen. 
4. Enduring influences of Charlemagne’s life and work upon our present civilization: 
“The eighth century—that immediately preceding Charlemagne’s “Cort 
tion—is commonly regarded as the most ignorant, the darkest, and the. most 
barbarous period of the Middle’ Ages, yet in spite of this dark picture there was 
promise for the future. It was evident, even before Charlemagne’s time that 
Europe was not to continue indefinitely in the path ef ignorance.” Latin was

kept alive particularly by the church; education (reading) was encouraged; Ro- 
man textbooks were continued in use; books were more carefully copied than before, 
a matter of no small moment to us even to this day, since through the copying of 
manuscripts the annals of the past. were preserved for us. i 
5. Age of disorder; the great landholders rise to power; feudalism, 
IV. England in the Middle Ages. 
1. The Norman conquest: 
The Angles and Saxons; King Alfred and learning; invasion of the Danes; 
the coming of William of Normandy; Normarfrule; castle life established, “‘Dooms- 
day Book,’’ laws, progress of England under William. 
2. Englishmen learn to desire good government: 
* The good laws of Henry II; King John and the “Great Charter,” the beginnings 
of Parliament. 
3. England acquires territory: Wales and Scotland: 
Border warfare; Edward I conquers Wales; the title of the “Prince of Wales;’% 
he conquers Scotland (Wallace and Bruce). a 
4. England and France contend for supremacy: a war of a ‘Hundred Years:” 
(Treat briefly). 
V. Life in the Middle Ages: 
Life in country and town;~tastle life; religion and the church. Among the 
topics will be— : 
/ Classes of the people; Feudalism: getting, and holding land; vassals; the 
castle; the warlike spirit of the age) Rnights, tournaments and sieges;-knightly 
training and ideals—times of chivalry; pastimes; the common people: workers, 
farmers, the manor land; dues, taxes, hard living, revolts of the workers;4how vil- 
lages and towns grew up; townsmen and tl “guilds,” shops, and laws; trading; 
religion; monasteries and education. 
VI. Great changes bring about the beginnings of our own times. 
1. Great social changes: 
The great social changes that mark the transition from the Middle Ages 
to modern times took place slowly, and no exact date can be assigned, but wé may 
think of them,as coming to climax between 1400 and 1600. The changes include 
especially: ay the rise of great national states, in place of the loose groupings under 
the feudal regime; (b) the break-up of the powerful, universal Christian church 
of western Europe—the Protestant Revolt; (some inventions: printing from 
movable type, paper, Arabic numerals, the compass, the astrolabe, etc.; _@) the 
expansion of Europe through the finding of a water route to the East and the dis- 
covery of the western world, leading in turn to the Commercial Revolution— 
cities on the Atlantic coast become the chief ceriters of trade instead of those in 
Italy, the volume of trade increases enormously, great quantities of silver and gold 
aye brought to Europe from the new world and increase the world’s supply of money 
and thus make it possible to carry on the larger trade; the magnitude of the new 
trade leads to the formation of chartered companies (corporations) and fosters the 
elopment of a class of capitalists. 
2, National rivalries for over-sea possessions and for expanding commerce: 
These great changes led to intense national rivalries for possessions over- 
“sea and for the expanding commerce. The general facts must be developed for the 
children through the study of simple incidents and selected persons. For our 
. 
%

540 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
purpose the expansion of Europe in the west is the most important topic, because 
its study answers for us the questions of how the Old World found the New and what 
Europeans did in America. 
VII. The expansion of Europe and the beginnings of America. 
1. The crusades and thetr results: 
Reasons for pilgrimages; reasons for the Crusades; result of the Crusades 
—an increased interest in travel, a direct acquaintance with the great trading cities 
of the South and East; a growing interest in commerce and expansion, a more 
widespread desire for education. @% 
2. A new route to India is wanted. How it is found: 
Disturbance of travel by the Turks; Marco Polo’s travels and the geograph- 
ical knowledge he gave the world; Prince Henry of Portugal and other famous 
Portuguese sailors—the uncovering of the African coast; the new route to India— 
found at last! 
3. Spanish ships find a New World: 
hristopher Columbus and the Discovery of America: 
The man—Christopher Columbus; Spain’s interest in the finding of a new 
route to India; Columbus’s first voyage (new islands); his later voyages (more 
coasts explored); Spanish settlements begun. 
5. Spanish conquests in the New World: f 
The search for gold and silver; in the islands; in Mexico; the use of slaves. 
6. French atiempts at settlements in the New World and their failure. 
7. Elizabethan England, and the English “ sea-dogs”’: 3 
Changes and progress of life of the times of ‘Good Queen Bess;”” England 
on the seas—(Cabot should be recalled) Hawkins, Drake, Raleigh; jealousy of 
England and Spain; England’s aid Be revolt of the Dutch against Spain; the 
Spanish armada—England becomes ‘“Mistress of the seas.” 
8. Sir Walter Raleigh’s attempts to plant colonies in the New World: 
America in the literature of the time—Richard Hakluyt, his writings, their 
influence;—failure of Raleigh’s colonizing efforts. 
9. The situation in America; at the close of the 16th Century: 
On the eve of English and French colonization. 
WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION 
Text for the Grade: Hall, Our Ancestors in Europe. 
Read the section under the above title in the introductory article—‘‘The Teach- 
ing of History in the Grammar Grades: Some Suggestions,” pp. 473-500. Much 
will be found there of interest to teachers of the Sixth Grade. By far the most use- 
ful and convenient single volume for reference in connection with the course of the 
Sixth Grade is Robinson and Breasted, Outlines of European History, Part I (Ginn 
and Co., 1914, $1.50); this book presents a remarkably fresh study of ancient civ- 
ilization, and one of the best brief accounts for the Middle Ages and the transition 
to modern times; it is written in a very attractive style and beautifully illustratéd. 
A brief but well selected bibliography is given on pp. 697-712, which will serve all 
ordinary purposes. Attention may also be called to Allsopp, An Introduction 1 
English Industrial History (imported by Macmillan, 60 cents); it gives in “bi 
compass an admirably clear, concrete account of the story of industry and society 
in the Middle Ages and how the old conditions broke down, and contains a simple 
plan ofa manor. For a specially helpful book on bibliographies for English history; 
see Cannon, Reading References for English History (Ginn & Co., 1910, $2.50),

Cross, A History of England and Greater Britain (Macmillan, 1914, $2.50), is the 
most recent comprehensive volume on English history; it contains selected refer- 
ence lists by chapters, with annotations. 
For the general field of modern European history consult the Cambridge Modern 
History, 12 vols. (Macmillan, 1900-1910, $4.00), it is a co-operative work, each 
volume containing from twenty to thirty separate chapters, written by nearly as 
many contributors. 
A list of special books for children will be made during the year; it will be the 
outcome of classroom work and will include only the books that the teacher has 
found to prove successful with her pupils and oe stand the test of historical ac- 
curacy and literary charm. 
SEVENTH GRADE 
The work of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Grades should pre- 
sent one continuous story. The first part presents the European 
beginnings of American civilization, discloses how and why the new 
world was discovered by the old, and shows America as the hej 
of Europe. The teacher of the Seventh Grade should be thoroughly 
familiar with this background and make frequent use of it for com- 
parative studies and for tracing lines of development. The second 
part of the story begins with the permanent settlement of the At- 
lantic coast by the English and their rivals, tells how and why these 
Europeans came here to live, what problems they had to meet, how 
the English obtained the mastery over all rivals, developed their 
industries and institutions and increased in numbers until they 
formed an American people, how tlais people broke away from the 
mother country to form a new nation, their problems in forming a 
new government, of their period of grave foreign entanglement, and 
of how>they enlarged their territory and successfully built a new 
and distinctive nation. From this point the work of the Eighth 
Grade proceeds, and the teacher of the Seventh Grade should also 
be familiar with the rest of the story and realize that her work should 
contribute to an understanding of the later events and of the con- 
ditions and problems of the present time. The Committee of Eight 
makes 1783 the dividing point, but the one indicated here, about 
1820, seems better because it carries the story to the establishment 
of a real nation, and allows more time for the study of recent his- 
tory, which is one of the strongly marked tendencies in the teaching 
of history.

Grammar Grades: Some Suggestions,” pp. 473-500.

study [sixth grade], and also Strayer: The Teaching Process, pp. 
183-195, which contains a plan worked out with page assignments 
from Gambrill’s Leading Events of Maryland History. 
Outlined in the large, the course covers the following topics: 
I. How the Old World found the New. 
II. Colonization: Europeans come to live on the Atlantic Coast 
of North America. 
III. Formation of an American people. 
IV. France and England fight for the mastery of North America. 
V. Birth of a new nation: Thirteen English colonies establish 
the United States of America. 
VI. The Problem of organizing a permanent union of States. 
VII. The making of a new nation [1790-1825]. 
‘How the Old World found the New: 
‘his topic should be briefly reviewed from the work of the preceding year, 
dealing with larger phases only and aiming especially to make the following points 
stand out: 
1. The History of our country begins with the coming of Europeans. 
2. During the 16th century Spain ts the one successful nation in the west, finding vast 
quantities of gold and silver, exploring much of the interior of South America, 
Central America, and the southern part of North America, and building up a great 
colonial empire. 
3. The rivals of Spain explored parts of the New World, chiefly coasts, and thus 
laid the basis for claims to land, but such attempts as they made to plant colonies 
failed completely. 
4, The Commercial Revolution: the future of America was greatly influenced 
by the shifting of trade centers to the Atlantic coast of Europe, the formation of 
great chartered corporations, and the great increase in the world’s supply of precious 
metals. 
5. Geography of the North Atlantic world: the ocean highway, western Europe, 
eastern North America. 
II, Colonization: Europeans come to live on the Atlantic Coast of North America. 
1. Settlements at the opening of the 17th century: 
At the opening of the 17th century the only European settlement on the 
Atlantic coast is the feeble colony of Spain in Florida. With the opening of this 
century the rivals of Spain, despite the jealousy of the latter, succeed in getting a 
foothold. Soon England, France, Holland, and Sweden successfully plant colonies 
on the Atlantic coast. A few years later England comes into possession of the 
Dutch and Swedish settlements; the two great rivals remaining are England and 
France, which fight for possessions in a series of wars during the next century. 
2. Why these Europeans came to America, with special reference to the English. 
3. Why the people who bore the expense of sending out settlers were willing to do so. 
Why the government gave encouragement. 
4. How the settlers got to America; travel; ships and the voyage. 
5. Difficulties and problems of the first settlers in a new colony; how they secured 
food, clothing, and tools; how they lived. 
6. Why did the colonies, so feeble at first, grow in population, wealth, and com- 
fort? Great migrations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-553
HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 543 
The foregoing topics may best be studied in this grade through specific 
topics—selected typical colonies, incidents, and persons. It is wasteful and in- 
effective to distribute the available time equally to all thirteen colonies; concentrate 
on more detailed studies of a few representative ones (but not failing to mention 
the others briefly), giving the most extended study to Maryland, as the home col- 
ony. (See pp. 494, 541.) Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts 
(including Plymouth and the Massachusetts Bay colony) are suggested. The 
study will extend to about 1690, but the idea is not so much to cover a particular 
chronological period, as it is to deal clearly with the planting and early history of 
the several colonies. With the six topics outlined in mind, the teacher will neces, 
sarily bring out such points as the motives of all concerned in planting a colony- 
terms of the grant, character of the settlers, how they were governed, climate and 
character of the country, industrial conditions, part played by religious ideas, re- 
ations with the Indians, leading men. 
III. Formation of an American people: 
1. Making of Americans: i 
The preceding section should bring out clearly how the colonies began, and 
show the progress of the new communities until. they become firmly rooted. 
At first the people are simply Europeans in America, but with the lapse of years 
they think of America as home, their children and grandchildren regard this as 
their native land, and gradually an American people is formed. Their institutions, 
cust ms, and mental attitudes are necessarily based on those of the mother land, 
but Onevitably they are modified, often to a great degree, by the conditions of the 
Newi World. By the middle of the 18th century such a change has unmistakably 
occurred, but it must be remembered that there is no American mation as yet, senti- 
ment is still directed toward the colony, which now has its own history, traditions, 
and customs, while England is still looked to as the. protecting Mother Country, 
distinguished from “foreign” countries by this relation as well as by the ties of 
language and blood kinship. This statement is of course made with reference to 
the Continental English colonies, the central object of study, but it applies generally 
to the tendencies of all new settlements in America, 
2. Why the study of colonial Americans is important: 
The study of these colonial Americans is important, because we cannot other- 
wise understand the Revolution that made them an independent nation, and 
because they and their immediate descendants are the people who built that nation 
and contributed the institutions and ideas from which so many conditions and 
modes of thinking in our time have developed. Yet generalizations like the fore- 
going cannot be presented profitably to children, no matter with what elaboration. 
They must be made to appear from the study of life among this colonial people, 
carried on very concretely. 
3. Life in the English colonies in the 18th century: 
This subject presents difficulties chiefly because sectional and local differ- 
ences dre in many particulars. very marked, so that it seems as if several distinct 
peoples are being studied. Yet this very fact is one of the elements in the histor- 
ical situation, and must stand out along with the other fact that there was much in 
common and many respects in which the differences were superficial or unimportant. 
Probably most teachers will handle the problem best by taking the three sections— 
New England, Middle, Southern, or type colonies in each, avoiding needless re- 
petition and selecting some topics for general treatment where more convenient.
-P-A-G-E-554
544 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
The “back” country, with its frontier fringe, may be regarded in many ways as 
a separate section. The following summary may be suggestive of the ground to 
be covered: 
a. The people, not neglecting the non-English immigrants, of whom the Scotch- 
Irish and Germans are most important. Others, such as the French and Dutch, 
were often important in particular localities. 
b. Industries and occupations; classes of people; land, bringing out the ways 
of acquiring land, and the enormous importance of vast areas of cheap land. 
c. The labor problem, and its fundamental importance in the development 
of the resources of a great new country. Reasons for the plan of “indentured 
servants” and slavery. 
d. The home and the daily work: house, furniture, dishes, dress, implements, 
heat, and light, food, etc. The great differences here throw light both on social 
classes and on community progress. 
e. Money and other means of exchange. 
f. Commerce and shipping; shipbuilding, reasons and importance; relation 
of trade to other industries and British laws. 
g. Religion and churches. Warring sects. Growth of toleration. 
h. Education; schools and colleges; practical education in the home and 
daily work. } 
i. Intellectual conditions; superstition, notably the witchcraft delusion; 
treatment of disease; literature; newspapers. 
j. Relations with the Indians; peculiar importance of the Iroquois. 
k. Government: what the community needed to have its government do; 
legislature, governor, courts; voters; how laws were made and money collected 
and expended. Ina simple, natural way it will appear that there were different 
types of colonial government—the corporate or self-governing, the royal province, 
and the proprietary province, the essential difference lying in the relation of the 
executive to the voters. (This will be needed later to explain why our state 
governments took the form they did.) 
In teaching the topic great care should be taken not to get lost in a mass of 
details, possibly of more or less curious interest but devoid of significance. The 
definite purposes of the study should be kept in mind. Large general facts should 
by the close of the study stand out clearly and be full of meaning, e. g., the isolation 
of colonial life, the self-sufficiency of the community and even of the single farm 
or plantation (especially in frontier regions) as compared with modern conditions, 
the absence of the factory and of the use of machinery. It is also wise to note 
conditions that made for inter-colonial co-operation, cohesion, and those which 
worked in an opposite way; these can be brought together later for closer study 
in connection with the Revolution and the organization of a lasting Union. 
4. Relations of the English colonies with Mother Country: 
a. Government: 
Here the problem of what was needed must be looked at from the point 
of view of the rulers of England; why colonies were desired, and what notions 
prevailed in Europe as to how they should be treated; some comparisons; which 
of the types of government found in the colonies would the English rulers prefer; 
how it would look to the colonists; friction with the governors, using actual 
cases; tendency to increase the number of royal provinces. (The people them- 
selves usually preferred royal to proprietary government.) Board of Trade and 
Plantations; this topic will merge with the following topics:
-P-A-G-E-555
HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 54- 1 
b. Commercial and industrial relations: 
The mercantile theory in its essentials can be quite simply explained 
for this grade. Desire of European countries to make their colonies profitable 
to the merchants and manufacturers of the mother country, sources of revenue 
to the government, and a means of promoting the growth of shipping and mari- 
time enterprise. England on the whole more liberal than other nations, yet 
selfish and grasping as the colonists saw things. Simple outline of the chief 
British laws regulating shipping, commerce, and industry—always concretely. 
Lax enforcement of some laws. Respects in which they protected and aided 
colonists. Theory that the mother country paid for these advantages by giving 
to the colonies the protection of its navy and army against foreign nations. 
IV. France and England fight for the mastery of North America. 
1. Expansion of the French. 
First settlements; wonderful explorations of traders and missionaries; claims 
established to the valleys of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi, the Great Lakes 
Region, and Hudson watershed. 
2. Life in New France. 
Vast territorial extent; scattering of population and the reasons; the fur 
trade, importance as an industry, adventurous and lawless life of the woodrangers; 
inter-marriage with the Indians, half-breed children, ability to get along well with 
savages; remarkable missionary efforts of the Jesuits and other Roman Catholic 
orders; the fisheries; farming, peasant class, landlords; importance of religion and 
influence of the church authorities, exclusion of dissenters and its effects; how the 
people were governed—no voters, even for neighborhood control, no meetings to 
discuss public business, absolute power of governor, intendant, and council; people 
of the settled communities inclined to be submissive and dependent. 
3. Struggle between France and England. 
As Spain declined England and France became the two great imperial 
Powers and rivals. (There was a short conflict between England and Holland, 
which had managed to seize the rich Portuguese possessions in Polynesia and was 
competing with England for the “carrying trade” even of the British empire itself, 
the fact which was responsible for the “Navigation Act” passed under Cromwell 
and made permanent in 1660; this fact will have been discussed in connection with 
the story of British colonial’ policies and can be referred to here.) It should be re- 
membered that the fight over America was merely a phase in time and place, of a 
world-wide and long-continued struggle for dominant power. Mastery in the 
West Indies, possession of India, and the “balance of power” in Europe were in- 
volved, and were often of larger importance than America in the minds of the rulers 
of England and France. The concluding phase of this great struggle occurred in 
connection with the American Revolution, owing to the fact that France aided the 
rebellious colonies, and Spain and Holland also fought England. Although the 
American colonies became independent, England had firmly established herself 
as the leading colonial Power of the world. During this long struggle the great 
English “‘sea power” had been built up. While all this cannot be fully studied 
in the Seventh Grade, enough should be done in a simple way to show the setting 
of the American conflicts. 
4, Struggle for possession of North America: first phase. 
This extends to1764. Recall a few minor clashes and conflicting claims 
prior to 1689; in the latter year began the series of four intercolonial wars that end- 
ed with the expulsion of French power. These wars, which have been commonly
-P-A-G-E-556
546 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
referred to by the name of the reigning English sovereign or, in the case of the last, 
as the French and Indian War, might well be designated by number—first, second, 
etc. The first three are distinctly different from the fourth; the latter began in 
America when the expanding English colonists clashed with the French, the others 
began in Europe over other questions, and were taken up incidentally in America. 
The fighting was to a great extent raiding with Indian allies, though some important 
attacks on New France were made. The first and third did not alter the situation 
in America, the second resulted in important gains of territory by England. They 
all illustrate the part played by the Indians and the special importance of the Iro- 
quois (which is true of the fourth war also), and the work of Sir William Johnson 
might well receive some attention, especially as it will be very interesting to the 
children. There is no need for a detailed study of these wars; enough should be 
done to bring out the points above mentioned, and to indicate their influence in 
promoting intercolonial co-operation. 
5. Final struggle for the possession of North America, 1754-1763. 
a. Conditions leading to armed conflicts in the Ohio valley. When the 
westward extension of the English settlers carried them across the mountains, 
a clash was inevitable. 
b. The great work of William Pitt as prime minister of England, following 
a period of failure. 
c. The French and Indian War: 
Not much time should be put on the actual fighting. An interesting 
study of the geographical conditions may be, made, to show the points of contact 
and military problems, and indicate where the battles would have to occur. The 
relative advantages and resources of the two sides may be compared. The 
crowning victory of the war at Quebec, because of its importance and picturesque 
interest, might be made the one battle study. 
d. Treaty of Paris (1763): terms of the peace. 
Franklin, Jay, and Adams, the American negotiators. 
e. Results of the sweeping victory of Greal Britain 
These were of the highest importance. The weakness of England’s con- 
trol over her colonies was revealed by the wars; thus pointing out the need 
of those changes which were soon attempted with the effect of precipitating the 
Revolution; the colonists received military experience, developed their confidence 
and self-reliance, and learned to co-operate with one another; the removal of 
the French menace made England less afraid to offend the colonists and the 
latter feel less need of protection; determined the ultimate character of American 
civilization—English ideas and institutions instead of French or a division. All 
this the teacher should have clearly in mind, but it would be a mistake to elabor- 
ate or harp on them with the young student at this point; they can be developed 
here so far as proves easy and natural, and driven home later, from time to time, 
in connection with the appropriate developments. 
V. Birth of a new nation: Thirteen English colonies establish the United States af 
America. 4 
1. The British Empire: Great Britain and her possessions in all parts of the world. 
a. Importance of the West Indies and of India. 
b. The Continental American colonies—review briefly the relations with the 
Mother Country, political and commercial. 
Bice Weaknesses in the imperial organization exposed by the French wars: 
impossibility of mobilizing the real military strength of the colonies; ineffective-
-P-A-G-E-557
  HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 547 
ness of “requisitions;” illegal and treasonable trade of colonists with the enemy. 
Recall the necessary facts from the study of the last war to illustrate these facts 
in a simple, concrete way. 
2. New plans for strengthening the Empire are proposed by the English Govern- 
ment: 
a. Strict enforcement of the acts of navigation and trade. 
b. Keeping a standing army in the colonies. 
c. Strengthening the governors by paying their salaries instead of leaving 
them dependent on the Assemblies representing the voters. 
d. Direct taxation by act of Parliament, to help pay the expenses of govern- 
ing and protecting the colonies. 
3. How England tried to put the new plans into effect, and what the colonists did 
about it: 
It must be remembered that the features of the new policy were not all 
proposed at once or by one person, but appeared in the course of several years, 
and involved the general idea and purpose of imposing a stricter control over the 
colonies. 
a. Writs of assistance, 1761; why they seemed necessary if the Acts of 
Trade were to be enforced; why they were so objectionable to the colonists; 
James Otis. 
b. The ‘“Parson’s Cause” to introduce Patrick Henry and the feeling of 
resentment which he expressed against British interference with laws passed by 
the colonial assemblies. 
ce. The Sugar Act, 1764; the preamble expressly declares the intention of 
Parliament to cause a stricter enforcement of the laws of trade, and to raise 
money ‘‘towards defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing 
the said colonies.” (For serious effects in New England, see Coman, Industrial 
History of the United States, pp. 92ff.) Strong protests. 
d. The Stamp Act, 1765; provisions and purpose. How the colonists pre- 
vented the enforcement of the Act; mob violence; Sons of Liberty; organized 
opposition, especially the Stamp Act Congress and its Declaration of Rights. 
Attitude of Pitt. Repeal; Declaratory Act. 
e. The Townshend Acts, 1767; provisions; protests and resistance. The 
taxes, except that on tea, repealed in April, 1770. 
f. Growth of the Revolutionary movement; boycott agreements; troops 
sent to Boston; the “Boston Massacre” (March, 1770); attitude of King George 
III, his minister, Lord North; Gaspee destroyed, 1772; committees of corres- 
pondence; “Boston Tea Party,” 1773, similar acts against the tea tax in An- 
napolis, Charleston, and other cities. 
g. Repressive Acts passed by the British Government, 1774. Boston Port 
Bill, Massachusetts Charter Act; Impartial Justice Act, Quartering Act. Re- 
sponse of the colonies; general support of Massachusetts. 
h. The Quebec Act, June, 1774. Resentment against the Act on religious 
grounds and becauseof desire for the western lands. Refer to the proclamation 
of 1763, setting aside the country west of the mountains for the Indians, and 
the grounds of colonial objection. 
4. Patriots and Loyalists: the Revolution as a civil war. Whigs and Tories in 
England.
-P-A-G-E-558
  548 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
5. Organizing the Revolution: growth of Union. 
Local revolutionary bodies; committees of correspondence; First Continental 
Congress (Sept. 5, 1774), and its work, especially the declaration of rights, 
“Association,” address to the people of Great Britain, and petition to the king; 
armed conflicts, Lexington and Concord (April 19), Bunker Hill (June 17), 1775; 
Second Continental Congress, May 10, 1775, makes itself a provisional government 
to carry on the contest. Declaration of the causes of taking up arms by Congress, 
and the proclamation of rebellion by the king, August 23, amounted to official 
declarations of war. 
6. Independence. 
Growth of bitterness; failure of attempts at reconciliation; Paine’s Common 
Sense; radicals against conservatives, the former win. Story of the Declaration; 
analysis of the document. 
7. Why the Revolution occurred: a study of fundamental causes. 
a. Spirit of freedom and independence: very strong among the ruling classes. 
Many of these who came to the colonies were radicals, dissenters, or people of 
more than usual enterprise and self-reliance. Such qualities were developed by 
the struggle with the wilderness. Being 3,000 miles away from England, with 
the ocean between, and being allowed so much freedom by England, they natur- 
ally came to have a strong desire for their own way. 
b. The colonies had not developed representative democracies like those of 
today, but they had gone much further in that direction than the English had 
done; they had the idea that every man of adequate property ought to vote, and 
that every important community should be represented in the legislature, while 
in England there were large cities that sent no members to Parliament, and the 
laws about voting were confused and unfair. ‘‘Representation” did not mean 
the same thing in both countries. 
c. England had never worked out any orderly plan of empire, never passed 
any series of laws clearly defining the relations of the colonial governments to 
that of England. These circumstances made a quarrel likely in theend. Moreand 
more the colonists came to want self-government. When England tried to make 
a stronger empire, with stricter control by the Mother Country, the clash came. 
d. Why did the break occur when it did? Rapid growth in wealth and 
numbers in the 18th century (population increased more than one-third every 
decade from 1720-1770). Successful conclusion of French wars brought matters 
to a crisis. Some shrewd observers had predicted that if the French were ex- 
pelled the colonies would revolt. 
e. The break did not come over mere abstract principles of government, 
but in connection with very substantial economic interests that affected large 
numbers of people. 
It would be a mistake to begin the study of the Revolution with a long study of 
causes, and even at this point it would be useless to dictate such statements as the 
foregoing. An appreciation of these points should be made to grow simply out 
of the study of the course of events and by recalling what is known of the colonial 
period. Pupils should be encouraged to summarize the results in an individual way. 
8. The war for independence. 
It is common to spend entirely too much time on the military history of the 
war; no detailed study of the fighting is necessary, though the student may be en- 
couraged to read more about it himself. The following topics are suggested and the 
part of Maryland should receive attention.
-P-A-G-E-559
  HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 549 
a. Compare the problems and advantages of the two sides: geographical 
study to get at the plans of campaign, population, military and naval forces, 
industries, which had advantage of strong government, transportation problems, 
the loyalists. 
b. Conditions in the American army; life of the private. 
c. Outline of the several plans of the British for conquering the country: 
first and second campaigns for the Hudson valley; against Philadelphia; for the 
conquest of the South. Valley Forge and why such conditions could exist. Fight- 
ing in the West. One or two battles might be studied as types, e. g., Brandy- 
wine, Cowpens. 
d. The French alliance and its importance. 
e. Fighting at sea; John Paul Jones. France, Spain, and Holland against 
England. 
f. Industrial conditions during the war. 
g. Problem of paying for the war: “requisitions,” loans, paper money, un- 
paid soldiers; Robert Morris. 
9. Results of the war. 
a. Treaty of Paris: short study of the work of the American envoys and their 
problem; terms of the peace. 
b. Full opportunity for the American people to make of themselves what 
they could. A strong and lasting influence in other parts of the world (see sug- 
gestion under “‘Results” of French wars). 
VI. The Problem of organizing a permanent union of the States. 
1. The United States of America. 
a. Political problems created by independence: need of forming state gov- 
ernments to replace the colonial, and a general government to replace the im- 
perial. 
b. How the state governments were formed and what they were like: conventions; 
departments and officials, powers and duties; compare with colonial govern- 
ments, bringing out close resemblances and reasons for the differences. 
c. General government. When the Second Continental Congress assembled 
in May, 1775, armed conflicts had already occurred at Lexington and Concord, 
and a few weeks later occurred the battle of Bunker Hill. Confronted by actual 
war, which must be directed by some general authority to have any chance of 
success, the Congress, as the only body representative of all the colonies, assumed 
the powers of a provisional government, an intermediate step which must be taken 
in every revolution. To provide for a permanent constitutional government, 
the Congress drafted Articles of Confederation and submitted them to the states 
for ratification (1777). These finally adopted in 1781. Delay due chiefly to the 
position of Maryland about the western lands (See Gambrill: Leading Facts in 
Maryland History, pp. 135-137). 
2. The Confederation was the first constitutional union. It was the first attempt 
to solve their problem of federal union, of wisely dividing the powers of govern- 
ment between the states and the general government. What was the plan? 
Brief outline of the organization and powers it could exercise as a basis for study- 
ing the actual workings. 
3. How did the country get along under the Articles-of Confederation? 
a. Commerce, foreign relations, taxes, disorder, interstate quarrels, etc. 
The story of this “critical period”’ will yield a summary of thee chief defects of 
the Articles, i.e., the respects in which the government lacked power to do things
-P-A-G-E-560
  550 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
of common concern that needed to be done for the whole country, and the re- 
spects in which it could not really do the things it was supposed to have power 
to do. 
b. The west; conflicting’ claims of the states, service of Maryland to the 
Union; Ordinance of 1787, the start of territorial government. 
4. Why did the Americans fail so badly in the first effort to solve the problem of 
federal union? 
Their previous history gives the answer. The Revolution was fought by 
colonies that wished to control their own affairs, especially commerce and taxation, 
through their own assemblies; naturally they wished to give up as little power as 
possible to a central government. Looking at the situation this way pupils can see 
how certain they would be to make the mistake at first of giving the general govern- 
ment too little power for the general good. 
5. The Federal Convention of 1787. 
a. Why and how called. Classes of people who would especially suffer 
from the feebleness of the Confederation government; interests of the creditors 
of the government and business men who suffered from the bad commercial 
conditions and “‘hard times.”” Washington, Hamilton, and others who led the 
demand for a stronger government. 
b. Problems of the Convention and the work it did. The mistakes of the 
Articles must be avoided, but how? Large state men inclined to be nationalist, 
those from small states to insist upon “‘state’s rights.” Sectional antagonisms, 
North and South, East and West. Doubtful extent of Convention’s power. 
Principal plans that were proposed; compromises. Practical character of the 
work; built very largely on experience of colonies and states and Confederation, 
and knowledge of English experience. Men who were leaders in the work. Secret 
meetings and the reason. 
6. The Constitution: 
Outline of the chief provisions, showing how weaknesses of the Articles 
were corrected; did not attempt to regulate details, compare with state constitution 
of our own time. The great, vital peculiarity is the plan of having every citizen 
directly subject to and served by iwo different governments, each responsible for a 
different field of authority and activity; e.g., control of the commerce with foreign 
nations belongs to the Federal government, control of education and protection 
of the citizen from violence belong to the state. A few powers essential to any 
government, notably taxation, may be exercised by either, and are thus “concur- 
rent.”” It is not advisable to undertake an elaborate study of the Constitution at 
this point; consider the broad fundamental features, and why they were included. 
The actual working of the national government—regulating commerce, making 
treaties, the procedure in passing a law, admitting a new state, etc., can be studied 
in the concrete cases that will come into the story of the country’s progress to the 
present time. 
7. The new Constitution adopted by the States: 
Nine states needed; ratifying through conventions; arguments advanced 
for and against ratification. The study of one or two states where the struggle 
was serious (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Virginia) will perhaps be the best 
way of treating the topic. Virtual promise of the leaders in the fight for adoption 
of a Bill of Rights to be added by amendment. Final adoption. Reference to the 
peculiar position of Rhode Island and North Carolina. Maryland’s part. 
 
-P-A-G-E-561
  HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 551 
VII. The Making of a new nation: 
1. The people of the new nation: 
“a. Census of 1790; total population, different elements. Consider dis- 
tribution; proportion of rural and urban, number and size of cities, only 5% west 
of mountains, etc. 
b. Conditions of life not much changed since middle of 18th century; brief 
review with some modifications will serve to introduce the national period. Im- 
migration very small between the eve of the Revolution and 1820. 
c. Some characteristic American attitudes of -mind were developed or 
stimulated by the war and the launching of the national government: pride in 
the size and resources of the country, great faith in its future, enthusiasm for 
“liberty’”’ arid democracy. But restrictions on the suffrage were still common, 
and property qualifications for holding important offices were usually high. 
(Ch. of Bassett, The Federalist System, reprinted in Hart, Social and Economic 
Forces in American History, is very helpful for the general topic.) 
2. Putting the new government into operation: 
a. First election; president and vice president; Congress and its organiza- 
tion; the inauguration of the president. 
c. Organizing the three departments: Congress, officers and rules for 
conducting business; judges, clerks, and marshals for the courts; heads of ex- 
ecutive departments to assist the president. Appointments by the president 
to fill the offices created. How the “cabinet” began. 
c. Some necessary laws: providing for coinage and money, taxes to get 
funds to run the government (tariff and excise). Providing for the debts of the 
Union, conducting a post office system, choosing the capital. Influence of Ham- 
ilton in planning measures to establish the credit of the nation. 
d. Adding a bill of rights to the Constitution: first ten amendments. 
e. Importance of getting things started right. (precedent), and of wise, 
firm administration. Significance of the Whisky Rebellion. Washington as a 
statesman; his special fitness to be the first president; his Farewell Address. 
3. Relations with foreign countries: 
a. France—The French Revolution. War between France and England; 
questions raised in the United States, and differences of opinion. Genet. 
b. England—Violations of the treaty of 1783 on both sides; controversies 
over the rights of neutral trade; no minister from England (until 1791). Attempts 
to adjust matters; the Jay treaty. 
c, Spain—boundaries; question of navigation of the Mississippi; commerce. 
Treaty of 1795. 
d. Continued trouble with France. French resentment at Jay treaty 
and refusal of U. S. to aid them; treatment of our commissioners; X. Y. 7. affair. 
Remember that the anti-French party controlled the American Government at 
this time. Congress abrogates the treaty of alliance (of 1778), July, 1798. Fight- 
ing at sea, 1798-1800. 
4, Beginnings of political parties and party strife: 
a. Show how in a democracy differences of opinion about the nature and 
policy of the government are sure to arise, and become the basis of parties; refer 
to Patriots or Whigs, and Loyalists or Tories, during the Revolution; Federal- 
ists and Anti-federalists in connection with the movement for a stronger central 
authority that culminated in the adoption of the Constitution.
-P-A-G-E-562
  552 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
b. Show how differences of opinion grew out of the many problems con- 
nected with putting the new government into operation” and in connection with 
“Relations with foreign countries” (see sections 2 and 3, division VII). The op- 
posing leaders, Hamilton and Jefferson. 
c. The Federalists favored: a strong national government, therefore a 
broad or loose interpretation of the Constitution, a large national debt so as to 
keep prosperous citizens interested in the success of the new Union, dignified forms 
and ceremonies; government aid to promote business prosperity, e.g., by a na- 
tional bank and “‘protective”’ tariffs; strong army and navy; control of govern- 
ment by men of property and education; friendly relations with England. 
d. The Republicans (called “democrats” in derision by their enemies, 
sometimes spoken of as “‘Democratic-Republicans”; must be carefully distin- 
guished from the later Republican party). They were the party in opposition 
to those in power, and stood for: strong state governments, with a minimum of 
power for the central government, therefore favored strict “‘construction” or 
interpretation of the Constitution, opposed the assumption of state debts and vio- 
lently objected to such policies as the creation of a national bank, dreaded a strong 
army and navy. They believed that the masses of the people, not a select few, 
should control. Favored agricultural interests instead of the mercantile, fearing 
the ‘“‘money power.” Very friendly toward France and the French revolutionists. 
5. Period of Federalist control: 
a. Washington had little spirit of partisanship, but usually favored the 
views of his Federalist advisers; his dependence on Hamilton; resignation of 
Jefferson. Federalists clearly dominant during Washington’s second term; 
violent attacks on him by partisan newspapers; he declines a third term—the 
beginning of a custom; the Farewell Address. 
b. John Adams elected in 1796 after a party contest; violence of party 
strife during his administration; naturalization, alien, and sedition acts; Vir- 
ginia and Kentucky Resolutions. 
c. Overthrow of the Federalists in the election of 1800; the change as 
a “political revolution.” 
6. Period of Republican Control: : 
a. Jefferson, the great leader of the new regime. Recall his earlier career, 
already familiar; private life; personal characteristics; views on public questions; 
his services in Virginia. | Madison, secretary of state (recall his earlier career), 
Gallatin, secretary of the treasury: the two ablest helpers. 
b. Some acts of the new administration that carry out the party policies, 
e.g., simple inauguration, with reference to the debt, army, and navy; repeal of 
excise, repeal of naturalization act and passage of more liberal one, repeal of 
judiciary act. 
c. The Republicans continued in control until after the Federalists had 
gone to pieces, the latter failing to nominate a candidate against Monroe in 1820. 
Thereafter a reorganization of parties occurs, and in the following decade the 
Democrats and Whigs appear. The Republican regime thus lasts throughout 
the remainder of the seventh grade course, but with important changes in its own 
character. At this point it is enough to launch the party on its career; as the 
changes occur they may be noted and at the end summarized. 
7. Territorial expansion: doubling the area of the country. 
a. Importance to the West of free navigation of the Mississippi and the 
port of New Orleans. Recall troubles with Spain; “right of deposit” secured.
-P-A-G-E-563
HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 553 
Alarm in U. S. when port is again closed, after news that Louisiana had been 
ceded to France. Jefferson sends envoys to try to buy the island of Orleans and 
the Floridas. 
b. Recall briefly the previous history of Louisiana; explored and held by 
France, which lost it in 1763, the eastern part of the Mississippi basin to England, 
whence it passed to the U. S. in 1783, the western part to Spain. Napoleon gets 
it back. ° 
c. Napoleon offers to sell the whole of Louisiana to the U. S., and the en- 
voys accept. Terms: price, area and undefined boundaries, rights promised 
inhabitants, etc.. President and Senate ratify the treaty; House appropriates 
money. Constitutional question, inconsistency of Republicans. 
d. Great importance of the annexation of Louisiana: vast area and re- 
sources; certain to increase influence of West—jealousy of New England; future 
connection with slavery and influence on immigration, forces Republicans to 
commit themselves to broad construction. (This is another case in which it is 
useless to memorize ‘‘results;”’ develop lightly here, as far as intelligible, letting 
the understanding grow as things happen later.) 
e. Reaching out for Oregon.—Lewis and Clark explorations, information 
gained about the new territory, new claims on Oregon. Mention of claims by 
Spain, England, Russia, reserving for fuller study later. 
f. Desire for the Floridas: brief reference to reasons for interest, claims 
and disputes, avoiding confusing details. Cession to the United States by treaty 
of 1819. 
8. Napoleon and the great wars in Europe. 
Emphasizing the prolonged and desperate character of the struggle, and 
disposition of the belligerent nations to disregard the rights of neutrals. Interesting 
comparisons may be made with the Great War of 1914. 
9. The United States and the Napoleonic wars: struggle for the rights of neutrals. 
(Notice the close parallel in many respects with the Great War of 1914— 
in issues raised, entanglement of the U. S., industrial effects, etc.) 
a. How the war creates a great demand for American foodstuffs, causes 
a rapid increase of American shipping and carrying trade. Figures, especially if 
indicated on graph, can be very effectively used to show the effects of the war 
in its various phases (figures in Day, History of Commerce, p. 489, graph in Ashley, 
American History, p. 258). 
b. Desperate efforts of England and France (decrees and orders in council) 
to injure each other commercially, seriously affect American trade. Ruinous 
result of measures pushed through by Jefferson to punish England and France, 
the Embargo (1807); this followed by Non-intercourse and Macon Bill No. 2. 
c. Important questions raised regarding the rights of neutrals, and con- 
tentions of the U. S. for the freedom of the sea: Is a “‘paper blockade” binding? 
Is food contraband? Do “free ships make free goods?” Question of “‘con- 
tinuous” and “‘broken” voyage. Right of search. These may be handled very 
simply and concretely. 
d. Impressment of American seamen by British warships: desertions from 
British navy to American merchant marine; question of naturalization; high 
handed practices of British naval officers; Leopard-Chesapeake outrage and 
popular demand for war. 
e. Jefferson’s peace policy; opposed to war; believed nations could be in- 
fluenced by “‘reason” and “interest.” Resorts to delay and economic war- 
fare, opposes strengthening of navy and army.
-P-A-G-E-564
554 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
f. Drifting toward war: American grievances against both belligerents but 
England, in control of the seas, had much greater opportunities to inflict in- 
jury. Growing bitterness. Congressional elections of 1810 bring in numbers 
of “Young Republicans,” eager for war; their leader, Henry Clay, supported 
by John C. Calhoun. The “President and the ‘Little Belt.’ ” 
10. War with England, 1812-1815: Fighting for the freedom of the seas. 
a. The declaration of war and its statement of grievances. 
b. The U. S. unprepared for war; England preoccupied in Europe. Com- 
parison of the two in resources and advantages. The military problems; im- 
portance of naval power. American mistakes and mismanagement. 
c. New England’s resentment and opposition to the war. 
d. Brief study of the general aspects of the military and naval side of 
the war: attempts to invade Canada; fighting at sea and victory of single Amer- 
ican ships; blockade of the coast, part of the privateers; battle on the lakes; 
British invasions of 1814—capture of Washington, attack on Baltimore and the 
Star-spangled Banner, battle of New Orleans and Jackson. 
e.: Treaty of peace (Ghent, 1814); important questions not formally settled. 
f. Results of the war: international—on standing of U. S. and rights of 
neutrals; in the U. S.—fostered national spirit, led to final downfall of Federalists, 
developed nationalist tendencies of the Republicans, which adopted many of 
former Federalist policies, increased national debt, checked foreign commerce 
and promoted manufactures. (See suggestions under “Results” of Revolution.) 
11. Growth of the West (to about 1820). 
a. Country west of the mountains: geography and resources, opportunities 
for settlers, public land laws; importance of the transportation problem, influ- 
ence of steamboat. i 
b. Rapid influx of people from the East, the moving frontier line; con- 
ditions of frontier life (compare with early colonial settlements), qualities of char- 
acter and social and political ideals that were fostered. 
c. Admission of new states to the sisterhood of the Union, 1791-1820. 
This may fairly include Vermont, for the western parts of the older Eastern 
states must be considered in many ways as western in character and influence. 
The new states alter the weight and influence of older sections, such as New 
England; western ideas play a large part in the public life of the nation. 
d. Typical leaders of the new West: Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson. 
e. Consider again the importance of the annexation of Louisiana in the light 
of the preceding topics of this section. 
12. Invention, Industry, and Transportation. 
a. At the beginning of the Republic: country agricultural (crude methods) 
and commercial (taking our agricultural products abroad, bringing manufactured 
goods and luxuries from abroad); primitive conditions -of travel; absence of 
machinery and use of steam or electricity; methods of manufacture. 
b. Effect of the European wars is first to increase the devotion to agri- 
culture and shipping, then to divert effort and capital to manufactures, which 
continue to grow after the War of 1812. 
c. In England machines are invented for spinning, weaving, carding, and 
the other textile processes and the steam engine is developed and made. to 
drive this machinery; in America the cotton gin is invented. These changes 
create a vastly larger demand for cotton, the production of which soon becomes

HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 555 
the leading industry of the South; and after a time the new machinery and en- 
gines are introduced in the North, especially in New England, the factory system 
begins, and American manufactures become increasingly important. 
d. Building of a successful steamboat by Robert Fulton; great importance 
in building up the West and promoting internal development. Building of 
canals and good roads; aid given by the states, the question of Federal aid. 
Reference should be made to the building of railroads a few years later. 
13. The institution of slavery and its sectional tendencies. 
a. Northern states, in which slavery was not profitable, provide for its 
abolition, 1777-1784. Provision in the Ordnance of 1787. Recognition of a 
sectional division—Mason and Dixon’s line. 
b. Early national legislation: the fugitive slave act of 1793; act abolishing 
foreign slave trade (1807, in effect Jan. 1, 1808), co-operation with England 
in trying to break it up. 
c. Early abolition discussion, non-sectional; the colonization movement(1816-), 
Liberia. 3 
d. The Missouri question and the Compromise of 1820.—Rapid growth 
of the West raises the question of the status of slavery in the Louisiana territory; 
the different problems raised, the fight in Congress, provisions of the compromise 
and the principle on which based Results. 
J4. Growth of national. spirit. 
a. The Republican party becomes nationalized: Recall the series of events 
showing this tendency—e.g., Louisiana Purchase, Embargo Act, war measures 
and other laws based on “implied powers,”’ broad construction. Climax reached 
in passage of laws (1816) for protective tariff and second Bank of the U. S., 
marking complete reversal of early position. Influence of “Young Republicans.” 
b. Foreign relations. 
The attitude of the Congress of 1811 clearly showed the rise of a new spirit 
of national self-respect, resentment against the aggressions of foreign nations; 
also a sentiment for conquest and expansion. Effects of the war and the 
economic independence that followed it. Adjusting the national boundaries: 
British treaty of 1818 (line of 49°, Oregon); Spanish treaty of 1819 (Florida, 
Louisiana line, gives up Oregon north of 42°); Russian treaty of 1824 (abandons 
claims south of 54° 40’). The Monroe Doctrine (1823): conditions in Europe; 
conditions in Latin America; England’s proposal; Monroe and J. Q. Adams; 
principles laid down—U. S. would consider it unfriendly for European powers to 
attempt to interfere with independence of American republics, plant new colonies 
in America, or establish monarchical system in America; U. S. not to interfere 
in European affairs. Great importance; reference may be made to later appli- 
cation, especially French in Mexico, 1861-66, and Venezuela boundary in 1895. 
c. Decisions of the Federal Supreme Court about the meaning of the Con- 
stitution; Chief Justice John Marshall. Important as this question is, the 
attempt to deal with it in general terms is worse than useless. Select a few 
typical, important cases and study them in enough detail to arouse interest and 
show just what the Court did and why it was important. The following are sug- 
gested: McCulloch vs. Maryland (1819), for doctrine of implied powers and broad 
construction; Martin vs. Hunter’s Lessee, declaring a state law unconstitutional; 
Cohens vs. Virginia (1821), holding right of appeal from state suipreme court to 
Federal courts; Dartmouth College case (1819), states cannot impair obligation
-P-A-G-E-566
  556 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
of contracts; Gibbons vs. Ogden (1824), regulation of commerce. The greatest 
pains should be taken to present these simply and apply them to familiar things; 
for example, it might be shown how the Dartmouth College decision limits the 
power of Maryland to tax the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. 
d. Nationalizing influence of the West—Apparent from the study of the 
topic as outlined (Topic 11). 
e. Beginnings of American literature. 
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON 
N. B.—The Course of Study of 1909 included a study of The French Revolu- 
tion because it was believed at that time that we should study the two great revolu- 
tions side by side. For the first time in the history of mankind the idea of manhood. 
suffrage was revealed by the French Revolution. The revision committee in 1915 
felt that because the course in American history might become too heavy, it would 
probably be just as well to omit the French Revolution. It was decided, however, 
to print the outline leaving it to the individual teacher to settle for himself whether 
he should include it in his schedule. Now, in 1918, when twenty-two nations of the 
world are allied to fight against German autocracy it seems very necessary and 
vital to include more European history in our curriculum. The seventh grade 
teachers are therefore urged to teach the French Revolution, not in detail as a war, 
but correctly developing the principles it establishes—“‘liberty, equality, fraternity.” 
I. How the People of Europe Lived in the Eighteenth Century (France the center of 
the study). 
1. Work, trade, and social classes. 
a. Tilling the soil; very crude methods that were used; the manor-life of 
the peasants; serfdom and the survival of the old servile dues and disabilities. 
b. Manufacture and commerce; the towns and the system of guilds; gov- 
ernment restrictions on industry and commerce; position of the “middle class” ° 
or bourgeoisie. 
c. The three “estates.” 
(1) Privileged classes—clergy and nobility; special privileges and monopolies. 
(2) “Third Estate” comprising the vast majority of the people; the real 
mass of the nation; restrictions and discriminations under which they suffered. 
(3) Important differences within each of the “‘estates:” within the third 
estate, between the peasants and workers on the one hand and the bourgeoisie 
(wealthy or well-to-do middle class) on the other; the poorer clergy, distinc- 
tions among the nobles. Privilege the real key to class differences, which often 
cut across the lines of the “estates.” 
2. Science and attitudes of mind. 
a. Spirit of scientific study instead of dependence on authority; spirit of pro- 
gress and reform. 
b. Francis Bacon had prepared the way; Newton; academies and institu- 
tions for scientific study. 
c. Advocates of social and political reform; Voltaire; writers for the En- 
cyclopedia; Rousseau; attacks on religious privilege and intolerance; the Italian, 
Cesare Beccaria, in his treatise on Crimes and Punishments, attacks the cruel and 
unjust methods of dealing with persons accused of crime. 
3. How people were governed. 
a. Autocratic or class rule prevails, even in England.
-P-A-G-E-567
HISTORY—SEVENTH GRADE 557

fusion and unfairness in laws and administration; special privilege; extravagance 
and abuses of the court; Louis XV and “After us the deluge.” 
c. The “enlightened despots’ and their ideas: Frederick II of Prussia, Cather-

a. Demand for liberty and equality; Declaration of the Rights of Man. 
b. Reforming the government; beginnings of a constitution. 
c. Seizing church property; bringing the clergy under civil control; general 
attack on privilege; flight of many of the nobles and clergy. 
d. Constitution of 1791: king, ministry, legislative assembly.

EIGHTH GRADE 
The work of this grade is continuous with that of the Seventh; 
read the remarks at the beginning of the course for the Seventh 
Grade. The numbering of the main toptcs for the two grades is un- 
broken, to indicate this continuity. [Grade VII, Topics I-VII in- 
clusive, Grade VIII, Topics VIII-XV inclusive.] Naturally the 
work of the Eighth Grade will begin with a review but this should 
be brief, informal, and devoted only to the largest topics, so as to 
secure the right point of departure. As particular topics, such as 
slavery and political parties, are taken up they should be introduced 
by such specific reviews as may be necessary to intelligent study. 
Here we are working up directly to our own times, and every 
effort should be made to give the story practical interest, to throw 
light on the conditions and problems of our country today by show- 
ing how they came to be. 
Read carefully and critically “The Teaching of History in the 
Grammar Grades: Some Suggestions,” pp. 473-500. 
For the study of the history of Maryland in this grade, see “‘Teach- 
ing History in the Grammar Grades: Some suggestions,” pp. 494-

VIII. The Industrial Revolution and the Transformation of 
Society. 
IX. Industrial Reorganization in the United States. 
X. Political Re-organization and, the Growth of Democracy. 
XI. Development of American Society, 1820-1860. 
XII. Nationalism or Sectionalism? 
XIII. Crisis of the Union: One Nation or Two? 
XIX. The New Union. 
XV. Our Own Time and Its Problems. 
VIII, The Industrial Revolution and the Transformation of Society. 
1. Coming of the Age of Machinery. 
This means in brief the coming of the age of machinery and the application 
of science to industry and common things, with the corresponding changes in 
society. It has fairly made the world over, and may be rated at least equal in 
importance to any other great change in all history. No one can really under- 
stand the world today without knowing something about the Industrial Revolution. 
2. Textile manufacturers in England. 
The change began in England in the second half of the 18th century, with 
the inventions of Hargreaves, Arkwright, Crompton, Cartwright, Watt, and others. 
These made possible the carrying on of textile manufacturers by machinery driven 
by steam and water power, instead of by the crude methods of hand carding, the 
spinning wheel, and the hand loom. 
3. The progress of the Revolution: 
The progress of the Revolution is best studied by showing how the work- 
ing out of the early changes mentioned would force others. To get machines and 
fuel, the coal and iron industries must be improved and developed; the need of 
machines to make machines would develop new industries; better instruments for 
testing temperatures, weight, measures, etc. would be required; the enormous value 
of motive power leads in time to applications of electricity and the gas engine; 
larger supplies of raw materials are needed and more food for the cities that spring 
up, hence improvements in agriculture, the use of machinery, more scientific methods; 
vast increase in commerce and business demands similar improvement in trans- 
portation and communication—steamboat, locomotive and railroad, electric cars, 
elegraph, telephone, wireless, improved postal service. 
4. Economic and social changes. 
Much larger capital needed for the new industry and commerce; growth ot 
corporations, and in time the trust problem. Vast increase in wage-earning 
class, because workers can no longer own tools and market the product; their 
dependence on capitalist employers, struggle for organization, conflicts; new class 
consciousness; socialism. Communities cease to be isolated in the old sense. Crowd- 
ing to industrial centers; growth of grea cities; new problems in social reform. 
New problems in education. Power-driven machinery and new means of communi- 
cation make possible the modern newspaper and magazine. 
Note: The foregoing paragraphs are bare suggestion of this great change 
and the lines on. which it may be studied. Though commonly neglected in schools, 
they are as much a part of history as kings and wars, and much more important.

5. England becomes the leading industrial and commercial nation of the World. 
England got the start in the Industrial Revolution and for a time managed 
to keep the secret of the new machines. Thus she became immensely wealthy 
and began her real career as the leading industrial and commercial nation. All 
Napoleon’s decrees could not keep English goods out of the Continent, because 
they were better and cheaper. But after a time the new methods were of course 
adopted on the Continent, and society was there transformed in the same way, 
with all the accompanying problems. We can now appreciate much better the 
changes that occurred in the U. S. 
IX. Industrial Reorganization in the United States: 
1. The story of American industry. 
Carefully review the story of American industry from 1789 to 1816 (Topics 
under VII, especially 9, a-f, and 12). It will then appear that a strong tendency 
tofdevelop manufactures developed in the United States just as the Industrial 
Revolution got well launched in England. 
2. Beginnings in the use of machinery and power in the U. S.; evading the English 
restrictions. 
Samuel Slater, ‘father of American manufactures,” with only his memory 
of the English factories to guide him, sets up the new cotton machinery at Paw- 
tucket, R. I. about 1790. Yet in 1804 we had only four cotton factories, and bought 
most of our manufactured goods from England. Then came the stimulus to Ameri- 
can manufactures; the rapid growth is best shown by a few figures. 
, 3. The United States becomes a manufacturing country. 
a. In 1807 there were 15 cotton mills with 8,000 spindles; in 1811, 87 mills 
with 80,000 spindles, employing 4,000 workers; in 1815, 500,000 spindles employ- 
ing 76,000 workers. 
b. “The first complete factory in the World.” 
Steam power used at Ballston, N. Y., 1810. Francis Lowell, at Waltham, 
Mass., uses the power loom, and brings all the new processes under one roof, 
making ‘“‘the first complete factory in the world, 1814.” 
4, Insecurity of the new manufactures, due to war conditions. . Effects of the re- 
turn of peace: importations in 1814; $13,000,000; in 1816, $147,000,000. English 
manufacturers, anxious to sell their accumulated goods and to ruin the new Ameri- 
can industries, ship enormous quantities at low prices. Hence a strong demand for 
a “protective” tariff, that would enable the infant industries to survive and grow. 
Petitions to Congress, 1816-17, from 40 industries. On the other hand, communi- 
ties that could. not or did not engage in manufactures objected that a protective 
tariff made them pay more for manufactured goods, without any corresponding bene- 
fit. Act of 1816 and its successors. 
5. Rise and growth of iron and coal industries in the U. S. 
Importance of Pennsylvania; growth of Pittsburgh. Iron manufactures rose 
from 20,000 tons in 1820 to nearly 290,000 in 1840. Increasing demand for coal; 
use of anthracite. 
6. Extension of cotion culture: 
The use of new machinery and power, and the growth of American manu- 
factures, greatly increase the demand for cotton, which can be profitably met be- 
cause of the invention of the cotton gin and the vast areas of new land in the south- 
west. A large part of the crop exported. Figures best show the growth of the 
industry. Rapid development of the southwest; by 1834 Alabama, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, and Tennessee, produced over two-thirds of the cotton grown in the U. S.
-P-A-G-E-571
HISTORY—EIGHTH GRADE 561 
7. The new West: 
a. Review Topic 11 of VII, continuing study on same lines. 
b. Rise of internal commerce. Based on sectional character of industries: 
(a) Southwest, rapid development of cotton culture, sugar in Louisiana, tobacco 
in Kentucky and Tennessee, products sold to other sections or abroad, especially 
cotton to Northeast and England; (b) Northwest food products (meat, grain, 
butter, cheese, fruits, etc.), found a market in the Southwest; (c) Northeast, 
manufacturing and commercial. Importance of navigable streams and the in- 
vention of the steamboat. The place of the older slave states is obvious. (See 
Callender, Selections from the Economic History of the U. S., ch. vii.) 
8. Progress of transportation and communication: 
(See outline for the Fifth Grade). 
a. Recall crude conditions of travel and transportation at the time the 
republic began. Improvement. (Review, 12, d, VII.) 
b. Natural routes of travel: a geographical study. 
c. Improved roads; canals. Special importance of Erie Canal; Chesapeake 
and Ohio Canal. 
d. The revolution made by the steamboat and the locomotive. Story of 
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad; improvement in railroads, locomotives, cars, 
and management; increase of mileage. 
e. Invention of the electric telegraph; successful use in 1844. The ocean cable. 
f. Improving postal service; cheapening of rates. 
9. Use of machinery in agriculture: plows, wagons, reapers, binders, threshers, etc. 
10. American inventions: 
a. The record of the U. S. is remarkable, but there is little use in memorizing 
lists of inventions and inventors. They should be taken up in some signi- 
ficant connection, in the manner already indicated in these outlines. They are 
American contributions to the age of machinery and applied science. Besides 
those above mentioned, the following at least should receive notice: screw pro- 
pellor, Ericsson, 1836; vulcanizing rubber, Goodyear, 1839; sewing machine, 
Howe, 1846; steam cylinder printing press, Hoe, 1847. 
b. Increase in number of patents. 
It should be remembered that the few big inventions studied are merely 
examples; hundreds of inventions of value were made, covering the manufacture 
of textiles and every other field of industrial activity, transportation, and human 
comfort and safety. The increase in number of patents granted is suggestive: 
e.g., in the decade ending 1800, about 300; in that ending 1850, nearly 6,000; by 
1860 the annual increase was over 4800. 
X. Political Reorganization and the Growth of Democracy. 
1. Review briefly the history of political parties, 1789-1820 (use needed tppies 
from Seventh Grade, especially 4, 5, 6, and 14—a of VII). 
2. In 1820 there is no party conflict; the course of events has been such as to 
cause a general outburst of national feeling (Topic 14 of VII), and shatter the fac- 
tious Federalists. Apparently only one party is left. Such a condition could only 
be temporary; natural divisions of opinion would soon occur, new leaders would 
arise, and there would be new parties. This is just what happened. 
3. Personal rivalries of new leaders: Clay, Calhoun, Jackson, J. Q. Adams, 
Webster, Crawford. 
4. Election of 1824 may be made an inieresting study, showing the working of 
factions and personal rivalries, the germs of new party divisions; the transition  
-P-A-G-E-572
  
  562 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
to a new era, end of the “Virginia Dynasty,” democratic tendencies in making 
nominations—discrediting of Congressional caucus, candidates proposed by state 
legislatures and mass meetings; the election thrown into the House. Charge of 
“corrupt bargain’? between Adams and Clay. Under Adams the process of re- 
organization goes on, the issues becoming a little clearer and the leaders forming 
groups; the Adams men or “Ins,” the Jackson men, or “Outs;” bank, tariff, in- 
ternal improvements by Federal government, strong central government are dis- 
cussed. 
5. Jacksonian democracy and the emergence of new parties: 
a. Election of 1828: Jackson vs. Adams. 
Bitterness of the campaign; charge that the “will of the people” had 
been defeated in 1824; interest of the masses of the people; weight of the West 
and the frontier influence; Jackson considered a léader of the “plain people,” 
leader of a new democracy. 
b. Significance of the election of 1828. 
The election marked the climax of tendencies toward democracy in theory 
and practice; briefly review the changes, 1789-1829: extending the right to vote 
to larger numbers of men, a movement toward manhood suffrage; reducing the 
qualifications for office holding; tendency to elect more officials by popular vote, 
fix short terms, require “rotation in office;” attempts to popularize party con- 
trol, the “boss” and the ‘“‘spoils system.” x 
c. Spirit of the Jacksonian era. The tendencies mentioned in the preced- 
ing section continued and acquired greater vigor and success. It was a time of 
great enthusiasm for democracy and agitation for recognizing it in public life. 
It was also a time of intense patriotism, taking the form of uncritical pride in 
the country’s history and unlimited confidence in the country’s importance and 
future; this spirit in its best form is represented in Bancroft’s famous history. 
The influence of the West was of special importance (recalling studies of West- 
ern life will show why); it took the lead in the new tendencies. 
d. Policies of Jackson’s administration. 
His aims, views of his position, advisers; civil service; destruction of the 
bank; vigorous foreign policies; opposition to monopoly and privilege; strong 
assertion of the president’s powers—“‘the reign of Andrew Jackson.” 
e. Democrats and Whigs. : 
The political conflicts result in the completion of reorganization, Note 
also the development of party machinery, as in national conventions and plat- 
forms. 
“Two-thirds rule” of the Democrats. 
The minor parties may be mentioned. 
f. Financial measures, speculation, the panic of 1837, and the independent 
treasury system. 
g. National elections of 1836 and 1840. 
Excitement and emotional appeals in the latter; the Whigs in power; death 
of Harrison and succession of Tyler paractically reverses election—illustration 
oi playing politics with vice presidency. Whigs were unable to carry out 
their program, and a few years later the issues of the time became subordinate 
to the slavery question and dropped out of active controversy until after the 
Civil War.

. HISTORY—EIGHHT GRADE 563 
XI. Development of American society, 1820-1860: 
1. The people. 
a. Census returns show rapid growth of population, and changing distribution. 
b. Immigration. 
Influence of vast tracts of land, great expansion of industry, development 
of transportation; need of laborers for construction work, roads, canals, rail- 
roads, etc. European conditions, such as Irish famines and poverty, suppres- 
sion of liberal movement in Germany. Races, religion, social condition, new 
problems; ‘‘native American” movement, “‘Know Nothing” party. 
c. Intra-migration and changing distribution of people: 
From East to West, reasons; comparisons of the sections at different 
periods; growth of cities in number and size, causes. Previous studies of West 
and Industrial Revolution give basis for intelligent study of this topic, as well 
as of others in the whole section XI. 
2. Humanitarian reform. 
a. Administration of justice: milder punishments, better prisons and prison 
methods, abolition of imprisonment for debt. 
b. Care of defective and dependent classes: paupers, insane, etc.; Dorothea 
Dix. Reform schools. 
c. Temperance movement: war on the duel. 
3. The woman’s movement: 
Demand for educational opportunity, just laws for personal and property rights, 
and the suffrage. 
4, Educational reform and intellectual organization. 
a. Horace Mann and the common schools. 
b. First training school for teachers (1839). 
c. Progress of secondary schools. 
d. Colleges; land grants for higher education; technical and professional schools; 
beginning of co-education. 
e. Improvements in textbooks and buildings, lengthening of term, found- 
ing of educational journals, etc. 
f. Public libraries; museums; lectures; publishing houses; learned  so- 
cieties; etc. 
5. Social unrest: the “yeasty pertod.” (After 1830.) 
a. Theories of socialism and communism (connect with the Industrial Rev- 
olution and the growth of a wage-earning class. But the agitation was often 
conducted and communities founded by reformers who were not laborers); com- 
munities, Brook Farm, New Harmony, etc. 
b. The spirit is shown in the various and widespread movements for social 
change (as indicated throughout XI). 
6. Religion. 
Much religious activity; home missions, American Bible Society; foreign missions, 
national organization, division on slavery question; influence of immigration; 
religion in the newer Western communities—“camp meetings,” “revivals,” circuit

XII. Nationalism or Sectionalism? 
1. What is the Union? 
Is the Union a band of states, living in a partnership under the terms of an 
agreement or “compact” called the Constitution? Or, is it a strongly-bound 
national Union, “one and indivisible?” If it is charged that the Federal Govern- 
ment is exceeding its powers who shall decide the dispute—the states or the Federal 
Supreme Court? These are the questions about which controversy raged until it 
culminated in civil war. It is important to remember that: the people of a state 
or section did not choose their side by accident or by abstract reasoning, but ac- 
cording to their interests as they understood them at a given time. Hence a man 
may change his views, as did Calhoun; states and sections are inconsistent from 
time to time as circumstances change; and even the Supreme Court represented 
different theories as its membership and the times changed. The leading problem 
of this aspect of the period 1820-1860 is to follow the struggle of the two tendencies: 
the natural divisions of interest between sections, so that one could best advance 
its wishes by having the states strong, while the other could best do so by having 
the central government strong. 
Not much time should be taken at the beginning to define the issue because 
it is too abstract to mean much that way. Simply do what is necessary to set the 
problem clearly, then let the course of actual events and concrete cases give the 
material for later generalizations which can be made with intelligence. Recall 
the differences of opinion in the early period when the government was being or- 
ganized, then the strong nationalist movement that brought on the War of 1812 
and so greatly changed the old Republican party, and this was followed by new 
differences and another alignment of parties. 
2. The protective tariff and nullification. 
a. The tariff question: 
Brief review of the tariff question, especially 1816-1828. The two points 
of view; some sentiment in South for protection at first, growing belief 
that it was an unfair tax to that section, change best illustrated by Calhoun— 
his position in 1816 and his “Exposition” after the “tariff of abominations” 
in 1828.

tations. Slave “quarters,” clothing, food, care, how they worked; discipline, 
laws; treatment in general. Free negroes. Effect on attitude toward manual 
labor. 
c. “Cotton is King:” 
Tremendous growth of cotton culture, due to Industrial Revolution, cotton

c. Summary, stating briefly and clearly the causes, immediate and under- 
lying. Both in this section and throughout the study of sectionalism the teacher 
should strive especially for a spirit of fairness on the part of pupils; it is not for 
the teacher or class to settle the question of who was right or wrong, since that is 
a matter of individual opinion. Find out what happened and how the issues 
were viewed from each side of the controversy, bringing out the sincere devotion 
to right as they saw it by the leaders of both sections, and by the people of both.

There are so many other important topics that military history must be 
briefly treated (See comments on other wars in this outline). The blockade. Chief 
campaigns and great leaders; what the Federal armies and navy had to accomplish 
to win the war. It is easy to select from the many great battles a few for type 
studies, e.g., Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, siege of Vicksburg. Fight 
of-the “Monitor” and the “Merrimac” or “Virginia” is of special interest as the 
first between ironclads, marking the beginning of a new order in naval warfare; 
it is an excellent chance also to study a disputed result.

France, Great Britain), beginning 1868. 
10. Industrial and business conditions: 
This topic is best treated in connection with the development extending in- 
to our own times, but may be touched in connection with the crisis of the Union. 
The South suffered economic ruin, later to be succeeded by a wonderful develop- 
ment; in the North great business prosperity prevailed, the people were spared 
the ravages of invasion, and business was stimulated by the high war tariff and the 
demands of the war. Rise of big corporations; development of commerce and trans-

derful progress of the age of machinery and the rapid development of industry 
accompanying it, made an era of “big business.” Larger and larger sums of 
money needed for this business, growth of corporations (in which hundreds or 
thousands could invest) in number and amount of capital. How there grew

XV. Our Own Time and Its Problems: 
The topics of the preceding group should be brought up to the present time, 
but it will be well to use such a topic as XV in order to make the course definitely 
culminate with a study of the conditions and problems of our own times. This 
study will be all the more effective if made in connection with topical reviews to 
bring out the main lines of development (see p. 492). Thus it will be possible to 
realize the central purpose, to show how the life of our own times came to be what it 
is, and to aid in the intelligent study of its great public problems. In this latter 
part especially, the history work correlates most closely with the civics and prac- 
tically merges with it. 
THE GREATER EUROPE 
N. B.—The Course of Study of 1909 included part of this outline on “The 
Greater Europe” because it was believed at that time that we should study the 
growth of nationalism not only in our own country but also in the other leading 
World Powers. 
   
-P-A-G-E-585
  HISTORY—EIGHTH GRADE 575 
The revision committee in 1915 felt that because the course in American history 
might become too heavy, it would probably be just as well to omit the European 
history altogether. It was decided, however, to print the outline, leaving it to the 
individual teacher to settle for himself whether he would include it in his schedule. 
Now, in 1918, when twenty-two nations of the world areallied to fight against German 
autocracy it seems very necessary and vital to include more European history in 
our curriculum if we are to understand why the cataclysm has come upon us—-the 
greatest since the break-up of the Roman Empire, indeed the greatest in the history 
of the world. Eighth grade teachers, therefore, are urged to teach the European 
history in order to develop intelligently the principles that underlie nationalism, 
internationalism and imperialism, and to make vivid to boys and girls the problems 
that will confront the world in the process of reconstruction at the end of the war. 
I. England and the Growth of Democracy. 
1. Repeal of the Test Act (1828) and Catholic Emancipation (1829). 
2. Reform Bill of 1832; improved representative system and rise to political 
. power of the “middle class;” later reform bills (1867, 1884, 1885) and the admission 
of the workers to a share in the government. 
3. Social reforms: factory laws and other measures to protect the workers; 
public education; old age pensions (1908); social insurance (1911); taxing the 
large landholders (Lloyd-George budget of 1910). 
4, Recent changes to complete the supremacy of the House of Commons and 
the ministry representing them, over the House of Lords as well as over the king. 
5. The British and the self-governing colonies, especially Canada. 
6. The New British Education Bill (1917.) 
7. The Labor Parties in Great Britain (1918). 
II. The Growth of Nationalism. 
Compare with the struggles for nationalism in the U. S. 
1. Unification of Italy: Cavour, Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel; the kingdom of 
Italy and its problems. 
2. Unification of Germany: the customs union; Bismarck and William I; 
defeat of Austria and formation of the North German Federation (1866); the war 
with France (1870-71); proclamation of the empire (1871). The Menace of Prus- 
sianism. 
8. France under the Third Republic; the war with Germany (1870-71) and 
overthrow of the second empire; problems of the republic, strongly democratic 
tendencies and influence of radical parties in public affairs. 
III. Spread of European Civilization. 
1. “Imperialism” and what it means; the competition for trade and oppor- 
tunities for the investment of capital. 
2. Africa: explorations of Livingston and Stanley; most of it seized by the 
European Powers. 
3. Asia: 
a. China and its relations with Europe and America; great changes; set- 
ting up a republic. Wot 
b. Japan: its rapid and wonderful transformation; becomes Europeanized 
and a world Power; war with Russia (1904-05); annexation of Korea; alliance 
with England. Relations with the U. S. 
c. Interests of European nations and of the U. S. in the “Far East.” 
IV. The World Crisis—War of 1914.

WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION 
Graves VII—VIII 
To make the work either interesting or profitable the teacher must know much 
more than the text book can give. It is not possible here to give adequate reference 
lists; the teacher is referred to the topic Where to Find Information under ‘Some , 
Suggestions for Teaching History: Grammar Grades,” pp. 494-495; to a list of 
historical atlases on pp. 486-487 and to the selected and annotated references in the 
Teachers’ Year Book for the State of Maryland, 1912, pp. 74-92. 
Several recent books ought to be especially mentioned here:—Bassett, A Short 
History of the United States (Macmillan, 1913, $2.50); The Riverside History of the 
United States, edited by Wm. E. Dodd, (1915) containing the four volumes: I, 
Becker, Beginnings of American People; 11, Johnson, Union and Democracy; I, 
Dodd, Expansion and Conflict; IV, Paxson, The New Nation (Houghton); Chan- 
ning, History of the United States (3 vols. to be completed in 12 vols.) (Macmillan, 
$2.50 a vol.); McLaughlin, Readings in American History (Appleton, 1914, $1.50); 
West, Readings in American History (Allyn and Bacon, 1914); Muzzey, Readings 
_in American History (Ginn, 1915). 
All seventh and eighth grade teachers should read the Fifth Grade Course for 
its outlines and the references included in the outlines. The ground covered is the 
same though the treatment is very different, necessarily, and the references mentioned 
there will help not only the fifth but the sixth, seventh. and eighth grade teachers. 
For the European topics possibly Robinson and Beard, Development of Modern 
Europe, 2 vols. (Ginn and Co.) is the best text available. (Brought up to date by 
Prof. Robinson, 1918.)

  CIVICS: GRAMMAR GRADES 
The Point of View. Civics is one of the school subjects in which 
new tendencies are now apparent. There is a growing opinion that 
more attention should be given to the subject, in the elementary as 
well as in the high school, but at the same time a commonly-ex- 
pressed feeling that the traditional study of the machinery of gov- 
ernment with much emphasis on constitutions, is both tedious and 
ineffectual. New books are beginning to appear in response to 
this demand, and such topics as city planning, city health, drain- 
age and sewerage, cleaning the streets, housing, smoke and noise 
abatement, freight terminals, public recreation, schools, and the 
public library, are made the basis of the-work-before-the study of 
formal Government. Thus we are tending toward a study of much 
in elementary social economy and relatively very little on the actual 
machinery of government, some critics will say too little. Cer- 
tainly such material is of vastly more interest and value to children 
in the grammar grades than the memorizing of constitutions and 
the details of election machinery and terms of office. The space 
actually given to government in the narrower sense is used largely 
to explain the practical workings and the nature of the public 
services performed and the child’s immediate surroundings, matters 
of which he hears discussed at the table perhaps daily, are made 
the point of departure. From city, to state, to nation, is the order 
of procedure. 
“Just as the mother cannot act intelligently in the home unless 
she knows about the play of outside forces in the home, so the citizen 
cannot act intelligently in the community unless he views it in its 
proper relation to the state and nation.” Perhaps the garbage cart 
is the only community institution which is purely local in character. 
All other essential matters—water, milk, food, clothing, shelter, 
education, income, and freedom—cannot be determined iby com- 
munity action; they are of state and national concern.” Beard, 
American Citizenship. 
The work of the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, and 
’ of the Public Athletic League and the Girls Playground Associations 
should be utilized wherever possible; their publications are avail- 
able, and the children in our schools are members of such associa- 
tions. To avoid waste, and to make both play and life activities 
conform—teachers should definitely plan to use these activities.

But probably the best procedure is to link the civics program of 
the school to some vital social welfare agency in the community 
so that boys and girls may be educated in an understanding of the 
problems that confront society, problems that are related to local 
government, to national government, and to good citizenship 
generally. In 1915, a plan was made to set forth such a project by 
having the schools affiliate with, and supplement the work of the 
Compulsory Attendance Department, of the Maryland Childrens’ 
Aid Society, and of the Juvenile Court. The following details will 
make clear the ideas that led to the organization of a Junior Chil- 
dren’s Aid Society [named Junior “Children’s Aid” to show its re- 
lation to the Maryland Children’s Aid Society] and the develop- 
ment of its work. 
THE JUNIOR “CHILDREN’s AID SOCIETY” OF THE BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
OBJECT 
The object of the Junior Children’s Aid Society is to secure the interest of school 
children in the great problems underlying community welfare, especially i in the prob- 
lems of their own neighborhoods. 
PLAN 
The plan is to bring about an organization of branches of the Junior Children’s 
Aid Society in the schools of Baltimore County; these organizations to have officers 
and stated meetings for definite objects. Each branch is to organize its activities 
so that they will best aid the Baltimore County Children’s Aid Society in its work 
for unfortunate children. All the funds and donations turned over by them to the 
Maryland Children’s Aid Society are to be used to enable neglected and poor chil- 
dren to take advantage of a public school education. 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE “8 
With much material, in the Course of Study that could be related tothe work of 
she Junior Children’s Aid Society, it became a problem to get the classroom work * 
to organized that no other phase of civics and sanitation in the-Course of Study 
should suffer, and yet that good use should be made of the topics that relate to 
the work of the Children’s Aid Society. The following plan was devised by prin- 
cipals, teachers and supervisors: 
1. All children, by virtue of being promoted into the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh ~ » 
and eighth grades, and the four years of high school, become ‘“‘ipso facto” members : 
of the Junior “Children’s Aid Society.’’ ’ 
2. All children in these grades who pay the membership dues of ten cents become » a 
active members of the Society, with the privilege of voting and holding office. 
3. Active members meet once a month to transact the business of the Society. 3 
4, The principal and one or two teachers of the school, act as advisors to the So- 
ciety. These teachers are chosen or volunteer to do the work, because they, them- 
selves, have a social consciousness, and believe fully in the aims of the Society and 
the results that can be accomplished. 
5, A program committee of each local society, chooses from the list of topics, 
subjects to be presented at an assembly once a week, each grade being responsible
-P-A-G-E-589
CIVICS—GRAMMAR GRADES 579 
according to schedule for presenting a topic. For instance, should a sixth grade be 
assigned to. take charge of this Friday’s assembly, and should the topic for dis- 
- cussion be: “The Baltimore County Water Supply, and how it affects the health 
of the County people,” then the sixth grade for two or three weeks prior to the as- 
“sembly will be studying in the class-room this topic of civic sanitation and the various 
aspects of the problem of supplying Baltimore County with water will be discussed 
at the assembly by the children of the sixth grade. They and their teachers decide 
just -how to present, in an interesting way to the whole school, this matter of water 
supply and disease, and the relation of disease to compulsory attendance. 
At regular intervals, then, each grade has charge of an assembly topic, at which 
civic problems are discussed, and the work has been done in the class-room, under 
the direction of the teacher, has grown out of the Course of Study, and, yet, becomes 
one of the activities of the Junior “Children’s Aid Society.” 
It may seem a far cry from the time when a ten-year-old child in a fifth grade 
studies these problems in school just as he studies arithmetic and English, to the 
time when he is a full-fledged citizen of the world, and a responsible father to the 
next generation of school children. But we believe that such an educational pro- 
gram as has been tentatively outlined here will make young citizens grow up with 
an intelligent knowledge of some of the vital problems that confront our congested 
cities, and our isolated districts. 
Nothing could be more vital than an understanding of this big problem in its 
larger phase of educational possibilities, rather than in its smaller phase of charitable 
opportunity. For it is always true that, if a starving child, ragged and emaciated, 
is raised up before a multitude of people, all hands will go down into pockets, and 
money will be poured out for the child’s benefit. There is too much of this kind 
of charity in the world. It became our problem to have the children pay not only 
membership dues, but to begin to study the causes of poverty; poor attendance at 
school; preventable disease, which when not prevented makes the school attendance 
officers’ problem more difficult; and all the things that have to do with child-wel- 
fare; so that, through the process of education, a new way of looking at all of the 
problems that confront society might be given to this growing generation of boys 
and girls who are themselves to be citizens in a few years ready to take up their 
work in the world. ; 
To do this it seemed logical to examine the Course of Study to decide which topics 
in it shed any light at all upon problems of child-welfare. 
The hygiene and civics courses offer the opportunity. Here is a list of the topics 
chosen from the Course of Study that give rich material for children to discuss and 
debate at their society meetings.

V. From Eighth Grade Civics Course: 
1. State charities—asylums, almshouses. 
2. State penal institutions. 
3. The campaign against tuberculosis. 
CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS 
Glancing over this list one may well ask how does such a problem as “Good 
Roads” relate to the subject of child-welfare? The answer is this: In some com- 
munities there are poor roads and clay soil. In these communities we have found 
that the poorer children are kept out of school very frequently because they have no 
shoes. Upon investigation it was discovered that in many of the families only 
the cheapest shoes could be purchased; the poor roads and clay soil cut out these 
shoes in almost less than ten days’ time, and an economic problem was, therefore, 
set up in these families to provide money to purchase another pair of shoes, pos- 
sibly for two, three, or even four children in a family. And where the income for 
a family of nine persons is only $12.00 a week, the economic problem for that family 
is almost impossible of solution. 
The following reports from several schools show how the work is developing: 
FRANKLIN HIGH SCHOOL 
The pupils of Franklin High School assembled in Landstreet Hall on December 
19, 1916, to hear the report of the committee that visited the Juvenile Court. 
The assembly opened with the song, “Day by Day the Manna Fell.” This was 
followed by a talk on the History and Development of the Juvenile Court by Baker 
Clarke. He emphasized the fact that the Juvenile Court started because of the bad 
effects of putting children with older criminals. He cited many instances of the 
good work done by this court. Then Ethel Uhler and Mabel Hobbs gave interest- 
ing talks on the various cases tried on the day they visited the court. Especially, 
interesting were the accounts of the case of the small boys who stole rifles and killed 
aman. They both thought that the boys were not real criminals but victims of 
circumstances. If the boys had had the proper home training in all probability 
they would have been better children. Following these came a short talk on the 
atmosphere of the court by Edwin Fromm. He laid stress on the fact that the 
court was conducted in the most informal manner possible. After this the presi- 
dent read the report of the Thanksgiving offering and a letter from Miss Lucas
-P-A-G-E-591
  
CIVICS—GRAMMAR GRADES 581 
telling how the articles were distributed and thanking the society for their offering. 
The Junior Children’s Aid Society’s leaflets were distributed among the members - 
of the society. The meeting closed with the singing of ‘“‘America.” 
Towson HicGH SCHOOL 
a ee January meeting of the Children’s Aid was conducted by the president, Parks 
uffey. 
After a short business meeting the Seventh Grade took charge of the literary 
part of the program.

on “The Responsibilities of the Next Generation.” 
An original play, “Hooverism.” was presented by the third year and was enjoy- 
ed very much by everyone. iio 
The program ended with the singing of the Christmas carols and some patriotic 
songs by the Glee Club. ‘ 
_ The High School classes provided clothing, gifts and food for several families 
in the neighborhood. e

HIGHLANDTOWN SCHOOL 
The Junior Aid meeting of Highlandtown School was held on March 23, 1917, 
the topic being “Milk.” The meeting was opened with the singing of “The Star 
Spangled Banner.” Some interesting accounts were read by the pupils. The sub- 
jects were “Board of Health,” “Pasteurization of Milk” and the food elements 
and bacteria were explained fully. There were several recitations; a duet, “I Am 
Going a Milking,” was rendered by two small children. A violin solo was given

Our principal, Miss Porter, gave the members an introduction to Mr. Getier 
He then began his talk. His subject was “‘The First Aid to the Injured.” With 
each talk he gave demonstrations with the Boy Scouts of Pimlico School. 
The talks were on drowning, snake bites, fainting, methods of carrying the in- 
jured, and in each talk the main point was to “‘keep cool.” 
After the lecture the classes marched out and were dismissed from their class 
rooms.

How to Beautiry Essex 
As our homes are in Essex we would like to see it become one of the most progres- 
sive towns on the eastern side of Baltimore. A great many of these improvements 
can be brought about by the children of Essex School. 
Our first and simplest pee will be to keep the schoolground, highway and gutters 
free from paper and rubbish. We can make our home beautiful by planting trees 
and flowers and keeping the grass mown. Our sheds can be made attractive by 
whitewashing them and planting and training vines over them. To promote the 
healthfulness as well as the beauty we must keep the gutters open and throw all 
waste and garbage at a safe distance from the house. 
If we are going to-endeavor to make Essex beautiful we must organize as a body 
and war against a common dumping ground. In fact I think the children of Essex 
School should form a “ Junior Civic League,” for the following purposes: 
1. To keep Essex free from dumps. 2. To plant trees along highways. 3. To 
suppress all obscene and unsightly advertisements. 4. To help keep Essex free 
from saloons. 
If we should succeed in carrying out our plans the better class of people will build 
homes in Essex; the town will build up rapidly; the churches and school improve 
and grow; the older people would become interested and form a society for improve- 
ment. Our town will then be a beautiful and ideal place in which to live.

A Dramatization—A Visit to Towson Courthouse 
(N. B.—The following play shows how a civics topic can be worked up as a project 
that correlates with the English of the grade. The first two acts were written by Miss 
Lula Fox, a fifth grade teacher in the Garrett Heights School at Hamilton; the last act 
was written by the pupils of her Grade. It shows how difficult civics material may be 
made concrete to young children. The play was presented at a school assembly and at a 
Patrons’ ClubMeeting.) Ree

Characters—Mr. W. H. McCallister, J. H. Perry, August Famme, T. J. Thomp- 
son, Herbert Schmuck, Henry P. Mann and George J. Miller, all members of the 
Association. 
Mr. Perry—We are the Hamilton Improvement Association. This gentleman 
(pointing to Mr. McCallister) is Mr. Wm. H. McCallister, our president. 
Mr. McCallister—(Pointing to gentlemen in return) These gentlemen are Mr. J. 
H. Perry, our vice-president; Mr. August Famme, our secretary; Mr. T. J. Thomp- 
son, our financial secretary; Mr. Herbert Schmuck, our treasurer, and Mr. Henry 
P. Mann and Mr. George J. Miller, members of our executive committee. 
Well, gentlemen, what new business have we for tonight? 
Mr. Thompson—How about those fire plugs, Mr. President? Don’t you think 
it about time we were asking the County Commissioners to provide us with some 
more? Our town has grown so fast of late that the twenty-one plugs we have are 
far from being adequate. How would you advise us going about getting more? 
Mr. Schmuck—While we are looking after fireplugs, why not ask for more hose? 
We need additional hose more than the extra fire-plugs. So don’t forget that. _ 
Mr. Famme—Well, it is very good to have plenty of fireplugs and hose, but it 
seems to me we need more lights on some of these dark avenues worse than fire- 
plugs and hose, so put them in also. We may escape a fire for some time but these 
dark streets are with us always, 
Mr. Perry—True indeed. While we are asking we might as well ask for much 
as for little, so Mr. President, suggest a plan to secure all these things. 
Mr. McCallister—Well, gentlemen, the way to get these things is to so pester 
the County Commissioners that they will be glad to give them to us to get rid of 
our asking. The proper thing to do is to send a delegation to Towson to wait on 
the County Commissioners and ask for what we want. If we do not get them by 
the-first asking go again and again. until they give us what we want. 3 F 
Mr. Mann—I agree with you, Mr. McCallister, and move that a delegation, with 
the president as chairman, be appointed tonight to wait on the County Commis- 
sioners, and ask for these things 
Mr. Miller—I second the motion. 5 
Me peer ae have heard the motion, all in favor say “‘Aye.””

Mr. McCallister—Opposed say “No.”

The motion is carried. I appoint Mr. Famme, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Schmuck 
and myself a committee to wait on the County Commissioners at their next meeting, 
and ask for these things. 
All in favor of the meeting adjourning say “Aye.” 
All “Aye.”

to there is no time to waste. I understand there is a delegation from Hamilton 
coming over today to ask for a number of things. Mr. Yellott, we will let you 
talk to them as they are from one of your districts. 
Mr. Yellott—Very well, I will try to satisfy them. But I do hope Mr. McCal-

Mr. Yellott—Well, Mr. Mac, what do you expect us to give you Hamilton people 
today? Don’t you think you are pretty well cared for? With the extra help we 
are giving you for your fire department and lights, and the State Roads Commission 
widening your road, you ought to feel that you are the favored few. 
Mr. McCallister—Well, we don’t feel that way We are here today to ask for 
nee fire plugs and lights. These gentlemen can tell you how badly they are need- 
Mr. Famme—Indeed we can. Our towns of Hamilton and Lauraville have grown 
so fast of late that the twenty-one fire plugs afford us poor protection. Only last 
month the homes of Mr. Townsend and Mr. Horn burned to the ground because 
there were no fire plugs nearer than one-half mile. We feel sure you wish to do 
better by us than this. 
Mr. Rittenhouse—But, gentlemen, you have put the matter off too late. All 
of the money of 1916 is spent, and we cannot possibly do anything for you until 
the levy for 1917 is made. 
Mr. Thompson—Will you promise to help us when the new levy is made and you 
have the money. : 
Mr. Schlee—I think the matter should be left in the hands of Mr. Yellott, as it 
is one of his districts represented, and the money should come from the sum ap- 
propriated for that district. 
Mr. Bosley—Yes, this is Mr. Yellott’s affair. I am sure he will treat you right. 
Mr. Yellott—Well, I think I can promise a few fire plugs, and lights during the 
year of 1917, and will put you down among the first to be served. But I want you 
to understand that you are getting the full amount of your taxes spent right at 
Hamilton and Lauraville. The taxes collected in your community amount to 
about $27,000, and our clerk will give you a few figures to show just where you stand. 
Mr. Gallagher—Will you write this down—$27,000 received for year 1916.

Mr. Yellott—Yes, you people of Hamilton and Lauraville are a pretty fair class 
of citizens, but you have one or two delinquents in your midst. Just go into the 
Juvenile Court and hear the case being tried there today.

I had the right to keep him home when I pleased. I go to work early and do not

Judge—Mr. Hershner, have you notified Mr. Coblentz that Robert has not been 
attending school regularly? 
Mr. Hershner—Your Honor, I have notified Mr. Coblentz several times and ex- 
plained the law thoroughly. But it seems as if he would not obey. 
)Judge—Miss Johnson, have you anything to say concerning Robert? 
Miss Johnson—I saw Robert on the street smoking, and heard him swearing. 
I told him he ought to go to school, but he was very impudent and said his father 
told him to stay home. 
Judge—Mr. Coblentz, you have heard the reports of Miss Johnson and Mr. 
Hershner concerning your son. Have you anything more to say for yourself? 
Mr. Coblentz—No, sir. 
Judge—You know the law, do you not? 
Mr. Coblentz—Yes, Sir.

and I ‘fine you $25. You must send Robert to school regularly or we will take him

- ‘How Donations oF Foop, CLOTHING, AND SUPPLIES CONTRIBUTED BY THE JUNIOR 
‘ey CHILDREN’s AID SOCIETY HAVE BEEN USED 
(N. B. —To get the complete idea of the organization the work of the children alone 
will not suffice, so we are including here the report of the Directors for the Baltimore 
County Children’s Aid Society. It will show better than anything else how the schools 
are contributing to the work of the parent association.) 
To me it is a remarkable record that nearly all of the Junior Children’s Aid So- 
cieties, in addition to their membership dues, have given donations of clothing, 
food, toys and supplies. Some Societies have repeated these donations two and three 
times since October Ist. The Baltimore County worker does not know how she 
would have been able to meet the numerous demands upon the Society without 
this generous help from the Junior Children’s Aid. 
When Christmas of 1916 came around there were many children without the ne- 
cessities required to make this day one of joyful celebration. Besides the many 
fine things that the Junior Children’s Aid members did as individuals in their own
-P-A-G-E-597
  CIVICS—GRAMMAR GRADES 587 
community, they furnished a bountiful Christmas for ninety-three children and 
thirty-five adults of food, toys and clothing. Needless to say these one hundred 
and twenty-eight individuals remember with true gratitude that in their distressing 
circumstances they were not forgotten. 
CLOTHING AND FooD THE Two Most UsEFUL GiFTs 
Very frequently I am called upon to go into families where children are out of 
school because they lack shoes and clothing. If I had to buy these in every case 
the small funds at the command of the Baltimore County Children’s Aid Society 
would not anything like go around. When I get such an application now, the first 
thing I think of are the supplies which the Junior Children’s Aid Society have ac- 
cumulated for distribution. Very often I do not have to spend a dollar. I do 
not know how much money this has saved during the past year, but I am sure it 
must be somewhere between one hundred and two hundred dollars. 
Then, too, I have applications from families where some one is out of work or 
the wage earner is sick. I have found one family after another without food to 
keep them strong and well. When this has happened, I have always been able to 
use the food donated by the Junior Children’s Aid to good advantage, and again 
have been able to save money to spend upon other important work that I have to do. 
The best thing about all these gifts of the Junior Children’s Aid Society is that they 
have been voluntary, showing the civic and social responsibility felt by its members 
and so well expressed in the motto selected by “The Civic Sentinel,” ‘““Am I my 
brother’s keeper?” 
SEE THE JUNIOR CHILDREN’s AID Society GRow 
The number of Junior Children’s Aid Societies in 1916—twenty-three. 
The number of Junior Children’s Aid Societies in 1917— thirty-nine. 
An increase of 16 organizations. 
The number of members in 1916 was 1,984. 
The number of members in 1917 is 3,580. 
An increase of 1,596. 
While the organizations and members have increased at such a gratifying rate, 
the effective work of the Junior Children’s Aid Societies has also increased. Thus 
far this year the total number of unfortunate children helped by the Society has 
reached the splendid total of 228. Of this number, 38 were families referred by the 
compulsory school attendance department of the County. In these 38 families, 
there were 135 children. 
Now that I have left the County to take up other work, I want to say to each 
member of the Society that I appreciate more than I can say your helpful interest 
and I sincerely hope that you will support the work done by Miss Louise Tilghman, 
my successor, in the same enthusiastic, helpful way that you supported me.

BALTIMORE COUNTY JUNIOR CHILDREN’S AID SOCIETY 
REPORT FOR 1917-1918 
The Baltimore County Junior “Children’s Aid Society” was organized in 1915 
for the purpose of interesting school children in the great problems underlying 
community welfare. 
At the beginning of the scholastic year of 1917-1918 there were thirty schools 
already organized for Junior Aid work. Since November, Mrs. Cook and Mr. 
Hershner have visited ten schools, and talked to four hundred children, about 
how they could assist Baltimore County in the compulsory school attendance and 
Juvenile Court Work. There are now forty-one organized, with a membership of 
3,728 children. 
Donations of clothing, food, toys and the membership fees of ten cents have 
kept many of the Baltimore County children in school, well-fed, and clothed. 
The boxes at Thanksgiving and Christmas were an enormous help and displayed 
plainly the sincere interest of both teachers and pupils. At Christmas forty-three 
 
-P-A-G-E-598
  
  588 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
baskets were distributed, and thirty-two families received other presents. The 
problem of distribution was greatly assisted by members of the Boy Scouts Troops. _ 
Through the assistance of the ‘Ladies’ Aid Society” of the Towson M. E. Church 
all clothes donated by the Junior Children’s Aid have been mended before they 
were distributed. 
The membership fees of the Junior Aid have been used for the relief of school 
children. Seven children who were not able to attend school because of the 
lack of shoes, were supplied through the Junior Aid Funds, while two other chil- 
dren who were suffering for the want of glasses were also relieved through the same 
source. There are now being sent to the dentist each week, school children who 
will receive attention also through the Junior Aid. 
The results from the physical examination made by the Public Athletic League 
Doctor are in many cases being referred to the Baltimore County Children’s Aid. 
Wherever there is need for attention which cannot be given by the home the relief 
will be given through the Children’s Aid, assisted by the Junior Children’s Aid. 
The following table gives the membership enrollment to date (May 31, 1918).* 
(N. B.—Here followed a list of the forty-one organized schools. We have omitted 
the list because of space. The total membership is 3728 children.)

FIFTH GRADE 
There are some civic facts a Fifth Grade child should know. The 
accumulation of these facts may be incidental (but not accidental), 
growing out of current local happenings in the educational, social, 
business and political world. The facts should be reviewed when- 
ever concrete instances are met that call them forth until they are fix- 
ed as a body of knowledge that the Fifth Grade child will carry on with 
him in life. Later, this knowledge of civics will become the basis 
for his reasoning about governmental matters when he assumes his 
burden of citizenship. It is just as important that girls know these 
facts as boys. The following questions are suggested as the basis 
for the work. Definite specific instances in current life should be 
made the pownt of departure for the lessons. Evidences of the topic 
under discussion should precede the formulations. Ex. [1] Reduc- 
tion of the prices of gas and electricity will serve as a point of de- 
parture for the discussion of the Public Service Commission, [2] 
railroad rates, railroad accidents and telegraph systems for the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, [3] a piece of local road con- 
struction for the work of the Roads Commission.

MUSIC 
SUGGESTIONS FOR ALL GRADES 
N. B.: For much of the material in this outline we are indebted to 
Mrs. J. C. Low (Henrietta Baker Low), recently Supervisor of Music 
in the Baltimore City Schools. 
I. Aims and values: 
1. Before music can be successfully taught, there must be a 
very clear understanding of its aims and values by all of those con- 
cerned in its teaching. Music properly taught ought to make for 
a better school spirit and a better community spirit, in that it in- 
volves the action of a concerted whole—the result being propor- 
tioned to the way in which school classes and community groups 
act as wholes, not as individuals. It is, therefore, an invaluable sub- 
ject for the training of a “‘social conscience’”’—a civic spirit. With 
this as an aim no one may be excused from music—each individual 
must be taught to do his share in perfecting a group ideal. The 
subservience of the individual to the group cannot too early be 
impressed upon our American children, and the most interesting 
and concrete way to do it is through chorus-singing in the public 
schools. The material selected must voice the interests of the group; 
the methods of teaching must be as simple and human as may be, 
and individuals must be urged to high endeavor in order that the 
resulting expression may be social expression and not individual 
.exploitation. Leaders must be developed, the weak trained to help 
themselves and thereby the whole; and organization and co-opera- 
tion with other groups must be a feature of the work. In addition 
to this big aim, there are many secondary ones among’ which may 
be mentioned: 
2. Secondary aims: 
a. The cultivation of the musical and literary sense, with 
the best song literature. 
b. The daily application of the principles of tone-and enun- 
ciation to speech of any kind: recitations, reading, and ordinary 
conversation. 
c. The breathing and posture demanded for correct sing- 
ing must be made into habits of living—not merely music habits. 
d. Opportunities for training in public behavior should be 
promoted by the music song-festivals.

e. The music must open an avenue of artistic enjoyment 
not only to the school-child, but to the homes connected with the 
school. 
For this reason the school must encourage community choruses, 
community informal singing, people’s orchestras, people’s bands, etc. 
f. The music should furnish the means to enlist the support 
and interest of churches and Sunday Schools, private and pa- 
rochial schools, clubs, of all kinds; neighborhood organizations, 
moving picture parlors—in short, music offers the medium through 
which the community may act as a united whole. 
g. A repertoire of good social songs must be taught in 
school and promulgated assiduously in the community through the 
co-operation of the agencies named in (f). This is one of the 
simplest ways to secure such co-operation. 
II. A complete scheme of public school music should take into account 
the following factors: 
1. The teaching of singing in the schools from the first grade 
through the high school; such teaching to apply to every child in 
every grade for the entire course and to include artistic rendition and 
sight-reading—the cultivation of taste to be paramount. 
2. High school orchestras and glee clubs included in the music 
work. Instruments furnished if need be. 
3. The teaching of instruments in the seventh and eighth grades 
in classes, by professionals. Instruments furnished if necessary. 
Note. Children of these grades are at the best age for begin- 
ning the study of an instrument. If no other time can be found, 
those studying instruments might be excused from singing lessons . 
at that time. 
4, The crediting of music in the high schools so that talented 
children may not be put at a disadvantage through their music- 
study. 
5. The giving of concerts by choruses of high school students 
in connection with a visiting orchestra. This to serve two purposes: 
interesting the students in orchestral performance, and interesting 
the neighborhood in the work of the schools. 
6. Enlisting the co-operation of musical clubs and organiza- 
tions in giving free concerts to school children or concerts at a 
minimum cost. 
7. The finding of specially gifted children with the view of 
setting them in the way of earning a livelihood through their gift. 
8. The formation of community singing classes and community 
orchestras outside of schools, to improve the community and the 
schools through the community.
-P-A-G-E-605
MUSIC 595 
9. Informal community singing at stated times under the juris- 
diction of the school authorities. 
10. The furtherance by school authorities of all efforts look- 
ing toward class organization and co-operation of all neighborhood 
agencies for the benefit of music. 
11. People’s music festivals, small and large, under the aus- 
pices of the school authorities. 
12. A music bureau in connection with the supervisors’. office, 
which shall issue reading matter, explanatory and suggestive in 
musical matters, and at the service of all.for improvement of com- 
munity music. 
III. General points for class-singing efficiency: 
1. In the first three years of school life it is not too much to 
expect that: 
a. Monotones shall be eliminated. 
b. A soft, light, high sustained singing tone shall be es- 
tablished. 
c. An extensive repertoire of good songs (good English and 
good music) shall be known to the children. 
d. Musical feeling for rhythm, the phrase, climax, etc., 
shall be established. 
2. In Grades IV to VIII, inclusive, all the foregoing are to be 
expected in addition to simple sight-reading, with part singing in 
the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. In these three grades, too, 
active participation in community music should be made a feature. 
3. A habit of correct posture and breathing shall be established. 
4. A relaxed jaw, making possible clear enunciation, shall be 
a habit; this habit to function in all spoken speech. 
5. Simple, natural, solo singing shall be encouraged in every child. 
6. A love for singing that will function outside the school 
should be the aim of the teacher. 
TYPE PROGRAMS : 
SUGGESTED Poss BILITIES FOR WEEK OF SonG. (February 17-23, 1918.) 
1. Union of several classes each day for Assembly Singing, with relatives and 
friends invited, and asked to join in singing. Time, preferably, at end of school day. 
2. Interest one pastor in the community, if possible, and urge him to get the 
others interested in a Union Service at one of the churches on some evening of 
the week. Churches can utilize their choirs, organists and assembly rooms without 
trouble. Use ‘‘Fifty-five Songs.” 
3. Ask each pastor to have one special song-service on the Sunday preceding the 
Week of Song and that they speak on that date of the value of song in worship, in 
the home, in the community, etc. 
4. That all parties or home-gatherings of any kind, during that week, spend at 
least one half hour in singing.
-P-A-G-E-606
596 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
5. Ask any social or musical organization in your neighborhood to give a song- 
party or concert during the week. 
6. Write to “National Week of Song,” care of Normal Instructor, Primary 
Class, Dansvile, N. Y., for prepared articles suitable for publication in your local 
paper, (free of charge). Write at once. 
7. Arrange for a “Community Sing” in some big hall of the neighborhood. Have 
a chorus to lead, made up, if possible, of some or all of the Church Choir singers, 
and at least one hundred upper grade boys and girls. If desired, this chorus might 
sing one or two numbers alone, but their chief business should be to inspire all 
present to sing. Ask any violinists or musicians of the neighborhood to co-operate. 
Defray expenses of printing words or buying song books, etc., by a silver collection. 
Leader: Organist, choir singer, teacher, or musician of the neighborhood. Have 
some good public speaker make a short address at this meeting on a topic concern- 
ing the immediate welfare of the community (fifteen minutes, at most). ’

THE CHRISTMAS PROGRAM 
Use of Carols in School: Take no one into this chorus who does not know the words 
and relax his jaw. The chorus should face the audience when singing. 
bs 
Make one class or one grade the choir, and the soloists responsible for certain 
selected portions of each carol, and use the whole assembly only for big effects.

planning and thru the news-letter let home folks know what you are planning and 
what their share is. The list of Carols to be sung. the records of them and the school 
plans should be in every home in the community not later than November 15th. 
2. If possible have a school celebration with carols (school organizing, directing and 
. taking leading part) and a community celebration with carols in which community 
organizations take the lead. Neighborhood musicians ought to arrange to provide 
vocal and orchestral help for this one and the largest hall should be used for the gather- 
ing of all the people. : 
3. Send a copy of the accompanying letter to each Sunday School Superintendent 
in your community; see that these letters are sent before Friday, November 15th. 
Enclose “‘ Directions for use of Carols” and lists of records:

Dear Sir: 
This year we are panos to teach init)... dees sees ee Ue school, six Christmas Carols taken 
from “Ten Traditional Carols” ($4.00 per hundred) and “‘Hark the Herald Angels,” “O Come All 
Ye Faithful” and “Joy to the World,” found in all hymnals. These carols should be known to all 
children because they have stood the test of time and are worthy of being committed to memory— 
both words and music. Would it be possible for you to arrange to use these same carols in your Sun- day School Christmas service? We want, if possible to arrange for a big community celebration and 
if the carols were taught both at day school and Sunday school, we might be sure of having them 
faultlessly committed. We believe that school-teaching of the carols will lessen your labor in Binday 
school and we feel that this close co-operation of day-school and Sunday school would add to good 
fellowship in the neighborhood. ; 
If you have any wishes with regard to the performance in Sunday school that we might help you 
carry out in our day-school teaching we should be glad to co-operate. 
May we have an answer before Friday, November 23rd? 
Yours very sincerely, 
N. B-—We enclose a copy of our report forms so that you may see how we are trying to make school nee help the neighborhood. We send too, lists of records which may be used for learning 
the Carol 
II. Directions Concerning the Use of Carols at Home: 
1. Let one of the language lessons be a letter te the family, telling something of 
the carol practice at school and what the object 1s. Let pupils also incorporate in 
the letter, the number and prices of the records which record the Carols. See that 
every family gets a letter the week of November 10th. 
2. Give a short talk on the happiness of singing together at home. (To save 
repetition this might be done at the assembly.) People cannot sing together unless 
they know the same songs. Could the children teach words and music of the carols 
at home so that the entire families might sing? (Week of November 10th.) 
3. Ask the children to learn the carols beautifully, so as to sing them to parents for 
a treat at the close of the day. ’ 
4, Appoint groups of not more than three children to visit all the old and sick 
people and sing the carols to them, if the people like. “Young and old need each other. 
N. B.—If the family wishes, they may sing from records of the first three (See 
November Outline). 
Holy Night 
First Noel These are especially good for singing around 
God Rest Ye Xmas tree. 
Good King Wenceslas 
6. Again and again call the attention to the talking-machine records of our Carols. 
Suggest their use for family singing. 
7. If the children are asked to sing at Christmas parties or entertainments, sug- 
gest that they use one or more of these Carols. 
8. Suggest that they teach the carols to friends who do not go to their school, so 
that these friends may know the carols when the community comes together 
N. B.—Keep the community affair constantly in mind.

MUSIC 599 
III. Suggestions for Community Use of Carols: 
-1. Whenever possible send word to the clergymen of the neighborhood that the 
children are learning these carols, and ask that, if possible, some of them be used in 
the Sunday school and Church services. 
2. Form a group or groups (at least twenty-five children in a group) selected 
from all grades, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, and ask them to go about the neighborhood 
singing their carols before the houses. A little judicious advertising might bring a 
candle in the windows of those who want singing. Ask people of the neighborhood 
to join. 
3. Arrange, if possible, that the school and all neighborhood organizations combine 
to give a Christmas Community celebration. This is the biggest thing the school can 
do to make the music function in the Community; but getting the whole neighborhood 
to co-operate is a bigger thing than the singing. 
4, Remember that self-direction is the aim you have in mind. Let your children 
suggest, plan, work for the Christmas celebration. Do nothing for them that they can 
do for themselves,

FIRST GRADE 
The following course offers the minimum of work and song- 
material. All musical effects must be gotten by imitation of the 
teacher who must teach by rote. If sight-reading is to be attempted 
it should be begun in Grade IV, using as simplest and least expen- 
sive the Congdon Primers Nos. I, II, and III, one of each of these 
books in children’s hands. 
I, Aims: 
1. To establish light, head-quality of tone. 
2. To establish breathing at beginning of phrases. 
3. . To cure all monotones. 
(For directions write the Supervisor’s office.) 
4. To establish habits of position and attention. (Write the office.) 
5. To establish habit of relaxed jaw in speaking as well as singing. 
6. To secure clean-cut enunciation in singing, with an absolute avoidance of 
any sliding of voice from note to note; this clean-cut enunciation to be carried 
over into all spoken speech. Make it a habit, not a happening.

IV. Teachers’ Directions: 
1. Please watch position carefully whenever singing is done. Correct posi- 
tion means: 
Feet on floor squarely (if sitting or standing). 
. Push back on seats of chairs as far as possible. 
Backs erect, mot touching chair backs. 
. Chest out. 
Head up. 
Eyes front. 
Note: (a) Allow no stiffness of shoulders or arms in attempting to get good 
positions. The body is relaxed but the chest and back are not. The chest and 
back hold up the relaxed body. (b) Please be very strict in all these position pomts. 
2, The following details are to be watched in all singing: 
a. Use a pitch pipe or instrument for pitching and pitch high. 
b. Rhythm. (Whenever possible let a movement suggested by something 
in the song, accompany the singing. For instance in the Thanksgiving Song, 
let the class pretend to use sickles and swing them rhythmically. Return to the 
movement whenever the rhythm is bad.) 
c. Precise intonation. (Allow no sliding of voice from note to note. Make 
each pitch clean and distinct.) 
d. Times and tunes. (Have them exact.) 
e. Tone. (Let it be soft, high, sustained.) 
f. Pronunciation. (Round vowels and clean cut consonants.) 
g. A relaxed lower jaw. 
h. Breathing deeply at every phrase. 
i, Interpretation. (Bringing out the meaning of the song.) 
Read the suggestions, pp. 593-600, carefully. If sight reading is 
to be attempted it should be begun in Grade IV, using, as simplest 
and least expensive, the Congdon Primers No. I, II, III; one of 
each of these books should be in the children’s hands. 
From time to time, lists of songs, with directions for teaching, 
will be issued from the office.

SIXTH, SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES 
Since most schools have a small attendance in the upper grades it 
is well to combine Grades VI, VII, and VIII for music. <A book in 
the hands of these pupils is absolutely essential. 
Soprano should be sung by Grade VI. If there is a second part, 
assign it to Grades VII and VIII. 
Boys with changing voices should sing a low third part, but these 
boys require almost weekly testing, so that their parts may be prop- 
erly assigned. Allow no boy under twelve years to sing low.

2. Allow no stiffness of shoulders or arms in attempting to get good positions. 
The body is relaxed but the chest and back are not. The chest and back hold up 
the relaxed body. 
3. Please be very strict in all these position points. 
4, The following details are to be watched in all singing: 
a. Use a pitch pipe or instrument for pitching, and pitch high. 
b. Rhythm. (Whenever possible let a movement suggested by something 
in the song, accompany the singing. For instance, in the Thanksgiving Song, 
let the class pretend to use sickles and swing them rhythmically. Return to the 
movement whenever the rhythm is bad.) 
c. Precise intonation. (Allow no sliding of voice from note to note. Make 
each pitch clean and distinct.) : 
d. Time and tune. (Have them exact.) 
e. Tone. (Let it be soft, high, sustained.) 
f. Pronunciation. (Round vowels and clean-cut consonants.) 
g. A relaxed jaw. 
h. Breathing deeply at every phrase. 
i, Interpretation. (Bringing out the meaning of the sang.)

  DRAWING: PRIMARY GRADES 
The love of the beautiful is as instinctive as any emotion, and its 
cultivation is essential to the complete fulfilment of our personality. 
The aim of art instruction in the curriculum is to aid in “the ex- 
pression of energy in terms of beauty” (Dow) by developing the 
esthetic side of the child’s nature. “We want.to open the eyes and — 
minds of the children everywhere to the sunshine of beauty, to carry 
happiness and ideals into the hearts of young people, and into the 
homes from whence they come.”—Munsterberg. 
This may be done by developing appreciation through associa- 
tion with the beautiful. Within the realm of the school this means 
the unconscious influence exerted by good pictures upon our walls, 
by the shrine of beauty presenting its bit of color, arrangement and 
harmony, by placing in the hands of the children for closer observa- 
tion pictures by great artists, and other works of art; by providing 
opportunity for expression in art mediums; by training children to 
exercise judgment through class criticisms, thereby increasing the 
capacity for enjoyment. 
It seems important to introduce the children to a wide range of 
visual materials rather than to force the accuracy of observations 
in any one direction. The subjects for study are closely related 
to other subjects such as nature study, industrial arts, geography, 
history, reading and literature as well as to holiday seasons and 
activities in the home. This includes the seasonal coloring of 
plants and landscapes, the illustrations of dramatic incidents, the 
decorations of such articles as the children have occasion to make 
during the year, and a simple study of the.great masterpieces which 
the children love. 
With the younger children both material and method are adapted 
to their needs and ability, and the work is used mainly as a medium 
of expression through which ideas are clarified. In the first three 
grades the play spirit predominates, the mere joy of making things, 
or of trying to make them, and to make them beautiful as well. 
There is an attempt to make the work purposeful to the children 
by setting such problems as they can appreciate and accomplish. 
Spontaneous, joyous work results in original delightful representa- 
tion. Later, as the children grow older, in the fourth grade, there 
comes a dissatisfaction with crude results and technique may be 
emphasized. Lessons in the main become perfunctory unless re- 
lated to some project having permanent value as judged from the 
utilitarian standpoint.

  DRAWING—FIRST GRADE 607 
The materials used are crayons, charcoal, chalk, scissors, paper, 
blackboard. The time devoted to drawing is one hour a week. In 
the first and second grades the periods may well be limited to twenty 
minutes each, giving three directed lessons a week. Much help may 
be given by means of blackboard sketches and pictures, but all such 
help must be removed while the children are drawing. Line drill 
for freedom of movement and light sketching should be frequent in 
all grades. A few minutes spent in this way at the beginning of 
the lesson is valuable. Large sheets of paper must be used for il- 
lustrative drawings. Aim to have nature drawings life size. The 
size and shape of the paper should fit the purpose of the. lesson. 
An undirected seat exercise, similar in kind, should invariably fol- 
low the directed lesson. Drawing lessons should supplement other 
lessons whenever possible.

FIRST GRADE 
Drawing is a little child’s delight and it is an easy step to pass 
from the unguided home efforts in graphic representation to the 
carefully planned work of the schoolroom. Closely correlated with 
all school activities as a natural medium’ of expression, and freely 
used in seat work it is an invaluable aid in clarifying and fixing 
visual images. 
Imagination and imitation, two characteristics of this period, are 
allowed full sway in the illustrative or imaginative representation, 
thé children handling crayon, charcoal, scissors and paper, and clay 
with enthusiasm and interest. Form being a most symbolic char- 
acter in the expression of a first grade child, the teacher often works 
with the children helping them to get ideas of form, of proportion, 
and relation. Ideas of arrangement are given by illustration and 
suggestion. Some work with figures in mass is given and hints as 
to backgrounds are introduced. Children should work agythe black- 
board, freely using the broad side of the chalk. The aim is to keep 
the children alive, alert, joyous, securing originality rather than ac- 
curacy and precision in representation. 
Children love to color pictures and to meet this desire hectograph 
copies and outline pictures from various sources are presented for 
coloring. Cuttings of flowers, birds, animals, houses, made by the 
children themselves, and children of older classes for them, may be 
colored.
-P-A-G-E-618
  608 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
In the illustrative work, black or brown crayola is preferable as a 
medium, since the child’s love of color tends to distract his interest 
from the story representation and colors should therefore be used 
sparingly. Pictures in the text books should be studied for the 
pleasure that they give and for the art ideas they present. 
Rhythm and color make a strong appeal to children of this age and 
these art principles based upon the early art instincts are applied 
in first grade work. Rhythmic borders are made with seeds and 
lentils, sticks, leaves and other nature units, repeated in drawing or 
cutting, mounted upon cards or used in the decoration of little 
booklets. Patterns for the paper used in the doll house, for the 
trimming on the doll’s dress; the Christmas tree on the Christmas 
card, and the Easter bunny on the Easter card, are simple and in- 
teresting problems. 
Recognition and use of color forms the basis of interesting lessons 
in finding and matching colors. Color days, as “Yellow Day” in 
the autumn and “Green Day” in the spring, are productive of much 
enjoyment. Sense games developing close observation of color form 
are invaluable. Color cards arranged from collections made by 
children should be made. 
Objective drawing is of necessity very simple, the main purpose 
being to cultivate observation and the record of growth. Specimens 
of grasses for first lesson$ are simplest and best, since no elements 
other than the one color and growth are present. The most im- 
portant things to consider are great simplicity of models and the 
lines of growth. Represent growth in neutral tones, brown or 
black crayola, then follow by a lesson in which color is used to sat- 
isfy the child’s love of color. In the outline which follows, models 
are suggested in each grade through which the same art principles 
are applied. Use the model suggested whenever it is available and 
do not encroach upon those selected for the succeeding grade. 
Aim in every drawing for good size and good placing on paper. 
See that the paper is suited to the correct placing of the object. 
Give judi@ious praise, discouraging nothing save carelessness. 
Through class criticism upon good and poor work train children 
to exercise judgment. In distribution and collection of material, 
reduce waste of time and energy to a minimum. 
Time allotment: Drawing and Industrial Arts will alternate. Per- 
iod: 30 minutes per day or 150 minutes per week.

SECOND GRADE 
In the second grade, the problems are of much the same charac- 
ter as in the first year, differing more in subject-matter and in variety 
of shape and arrangement than in art principles. Color is empha- 
sized here as in previous grades. Color days may be continued 
when studying primitive life. Colors used for dyeing and decorating 
cloth, baskets and ornaments will be reproduced upon clay models, 
in simple rugs and other articles. 
Rhythmic work, or simple design with lentils and sticks may be 
continued. Spots, lines and animal and plant units are used to 
decorate booklets for school work, and Christmas and Easter cards. 
These may be made with crayon, water color, or applied cuttings. 
Emphasize practice for free arm movement, correct position, and 
easy pencil holding. i 
The illustrative work based upon childish experiences, home life, 
and primitive life is continued with special emphasis upon propor- 
tions as well as good placing of things in the picture. The landscape 
background is presented along very simple lines and it is used as 
the background for some game or story to be illustrated. Here as 
in first grade, the illustration is made in brown or black crayon, 
as color tends to distract attention away from form and position. 
If introduced, it should be used sparingly.  
-P-A-G-E-622
  612 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Nature models should be kept simple for objective drawing, and 
usually each child should be provided with a specimen; parts which 
children cannot successfully sketch should be removed. The lune 
of growth is the most important consideration; this includes repre- 
sentation of stem and the manner of growth upon the stem. Teach 
children to observe and then record the result of their observation. 
Suggestive models are listed for each grade, and while others 
may be used which involve no greater difficulty it seems advisable 
not to encroach upon those of the succeeding grades. Work first 
for observation of growth, record in black or brown crayon, then 
follow with a lesson in color to add interest. In this grade the di- 
rected lesson in objective work should be followed by seatwork 
upon the same or similar model. 
The blackboard or paper should be used freely by the teacher to 
illustrate methods of handling the crayon or water color, to show 
what she sees at certain points, but upon no account is the work 
to be copied by the children as this prevents the exercise of observa- 
tion so much desired. 
Pictures in books, on the wall and small copies obtainable from 
picture companies should be studied for the enjoyment they give, 
and incidentally for art appreciation. Free hand cutting of simple 
objects, and to illustrate stories in reading and literature needs 
emphasis. Asa means for utilizing seatwork to worthy ends posters 
of scenes in modern and primitive life should be made from cuttings. 
Practice for free arm movement, correct position and easy pencil 
holding is essential. Blackboard work by the children in illustrative 
and object work should be encouraged. 
Aim in every drawing for good size and good placing on paper. 
See that the paper is suited to the correct placing of the object. 
Give judicious praise, discouraging nothing save carelessness. 
Through class criticism of good and poor work of the class, train 
children to exercise judgment. ,

THIRD GRADE 
The work of this grade marks an advance over the previous year 
in the more extended use of water color asamedium. Growth, pro- 
portion and arrangement have been considered and are continued 
with greater emphasis upon color and relation of objects. 
The near and far relations are presented in many ways: in land- 
scape, the appearance of the near tree, the tree in the distance; in 
nature or objective drawing, the relation of two objects, the one | 
that seems nearer and its representation. Paper devices, without 
much formal discussion, are used to develop ideas of foreshortening, 
and to show relation of objects to each other. 
In nature drawing specimens, stili simple but interesting, should 
be in the hands of the children for close observation. Avoid crossed 
stems or crowding. A proper background is necessary. When a 
few models only are obtainable always place them up high before 
the children so they will get a side view which will give much more 
interesting results. Teach children to observe, then record what 
they see. Illustrations on paper or blackboard by the teacher to  
-P-A-G-E-626
  616 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
indicate methods of handling the brush, and technique in drawing 
are valuable aids, but in no case is the work left for copy. Train 
children to note light and dark effects and try to represent them in 
a simple way. Remember that the size and shape of the paper 
should conform to the specimen, that proper placing is necessary, 
that greater exactness in representation of growth and color tones 
indicate progress. Children should mount drawings — suitable 
backgrounds of harmonizing colors. - 
Illustrative work is continued as seatwork with hidiged cutting 
as well as sketching. Children in action are a special study in the 
third grade. Sports and games of children at home and abroad 
furnish rich opportunity for realistic work and are closely related 
to geography and history. Notebooks should contain occasional 
illustrations. More definite work is done with the landscape, with 
more attention to details in producing an artistic whole. Two tones, 
three tones in the landscape, light and dark, or shade and tint in na- 
ture drawing are emphasized. Color scales showing the colors used 
are made. 
Posters made from cuttings and drawings that illustrate scenes 
from history, literature, or geography give opportunity for group 
work. Pictures in books, on the wall, and small pictures obtainable 
at small cost should be studied for the Leer they give and 
incidentally for art appreciation. 
Rhythmic work or design comes in response to some felt need, as 
the decoration of some booklet of work, a Christmas card, an An- 
imal Book as a gift for first grade children, or some other similar 
project. Units for rhythmic work are kept simple, growing out of 
flower or animal study, or suggested by the history or literature. 
Simple spots and lines made by using the brush and crayons are 
repeated in pleasing designs originated’ by the children. Also use 
units made by cuttings and by the use of simple stencils. 
Aim to have every drawing large and free, avoiding all small, 
insignificant work. 
Each directed lesson should be followed by an undirected seat 
exercise similar in kind. 
Through judicious class criticism, train children to exercise judg- 
ment. Give judicious praise, discouraging nothing save careless- 
less. In distribution and collection of material, reduce waste of time 
and energy to a minimum. 
Time allotment: Drawing and Industrial Arts will alternate. Per- 
iod: 30 minutes per day; 150 minutes per week.

FOURTH GRADE 
In the previous grades the children have been satisfied with their 
efforts, showing but little discontent with crudeness of result. The 
children of this grade show a marked desire and ability for a more 
grown-up point of view. The play spirit of the earlier grades is 
followed by an objective interest in the drawings, and imperfections 
discourage and disgust them. Emphasis is therefore placed upon 
technique, since the desire to do well necessitates drill. The work 
leads to a closer visual analysis and should enable children to gain  
-P-A-G-E-630
  
  620 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
skill in accurate seeing and artistic, truthful execution. Much more 
time is given to the development of one problem though the subject 
matter does not differ materially from that given in the preceding 
grades. 
Growth, proportion, arrangement, relation of objects, color values, 
dark and light massing are emphasized. Rhythm and subordina- 
tion have been presented, and are continued in a more definite way. 
Simple terms may now be learned in this grade in relation to the 
study of suggested models. These are worked out as the applica- 
tion demands their use, hence motives for work should be found 
which seem rational and not imposed for the mere sake of drawing. 
Book covers for work, gifts for other classes and for members. of 
the family, illustrations for history and geography, notebooks, 
posters illustrating scenes from literature, landscapes to post in the 
frame for this special purpose, are suggestive. Toward the end of 
the year printing is taken up in connection with a class book of 
work, following a simple device to secure a reasonable result. 
The study of landscapes from pictures in text books and collec- 
tions made by pupils, reviews therelation of sky and ground, plac- 
ing of objects in background and foreground, and emphasizes the 
new element—a road in the landscape and how to represent it. 
The study of figures is taken from the dramatic work, keen in- 
terest being aroused by the Greek stories, Viking tales, and his- 
tory stories. 
Objective work centers around a few interesting models. Studies 
of these are repeated in various mediums; with pencil, in outline, 
studying growth, shape, relation; with crayon or water color, study- 
ing color and bright and dark effects in relation to the other qual- 
ities. Color scales are indicated. Special attention is given to 
mounting upon harmonious backgrounds. Aim to keep the draw- 
ings large and train each pupil to record the result of his own seeing. 
All small, insignificant work should be avoided. Failure at any 
point indicates need for drill to improve technique. Avoid the repe- 
tition of models used in the previous grades and secure added in- 
terest by this element of freshness. Often pupils should be given 
opportunity to repeat work in undirected seat work of a similar] 
nature. This requires that class criticism not only indicate errors| 
but remedies as well, and thus furnish an incentive for improve-| 
ment. 
In this grade a study of three great masterpieces and the artis 
producing them is made, and pupils should be urged to make 
book containing reproductions of famous works of art. A list o

Introduction to Grammar Grades. The following scenes 
from a play by James Parton Haney, Director of Art in the schools 
of New York City, should be read by all teachers and thoughtfully 
pondered. It was written for the magazine “‘“Good Housekeeping;”’ 
the parts selected here are used with the permission of the author. 
As you read ask yourselves the questions: (1) Is our art teaching 
functioning in the tastes and the homes of the people? (2) Are we 
setting up artistic ideals in the community? 
THE STRANGER 
A MODERN MIRACLE PLAY 
By James Parton Haney 
From the remote time of Euripides to the present of Clyde Fitch and David 
Belasco the drama has been used for the double purpose of pointing a moral and of 
telling a tale. Sometimes the moral has been foremost, sometimes the humor, 
tragedy, or pathos of the tale. 
At this moment the taste of the public is tatis moved towards plays of the mystic 
order, where the imagery but thinly hides a pointed moral, and where the foibles 
of our kind are held up to a mirror, reflecting shapes we recognize at sight. Thus 
the stage has been held for months by modern translations of Everyman, sometimes 
in search of the Bluebird of Happiness, sometimes beset by Conscience in the guise 
of the Lodger of the Third Floor Back. 
Why not, then, a Masque of Art, a little fable in the form of a drama, wherein 
_ Shall walk our acquaintances, engaged in what some ribald spirits conceive to be 
* the solemn farce called “Art Teaching,” but which others esteem a tragedy, with 
only occasional touches of humor to relieve its times of tears set all too close together. 
With this idea in mind, this little play has been written. It is a mere sketch or 
skeleton, a drama without a hero or heroine, without a villain, and with no love 
interest, unless we except the emotion which our mysterious Unknown inspires. 
It is called ‘‘The Stranger” and its sub-head reads in the formal language of the 
old dramatic titles:-‘“A Modern Miracle Play in Four scenes, and an Epilogue 
wherein it is seen how Everyboy and Everygirl bring a STRANGER to School; and 
how the STRANGER causes much Mystery and is at last discovered by Them.” 
The scene is in Everytown, and the time, the Present. Costumes are by the 
town tailor and milliner and properties by the town’s trades-people. 
There is no incidental music, save that in the distance, in the second act, can be 
heard the metallic whine of a gramophone playing “‘Everybody’s Doin’ It” and 
“Billy.” Other vulgar airs may be imagined, if these records are not known to 
the reader. 
It is unnecessary to add that as this is a Miracle Play none of it is true; its situa- 
tions are but the fancies of the playwright. 
ScENE III 
A street in the main part of Everytown. Different store windows show millinery 
dresses, furniture, stationery and printing. In the distance a new town library is being 
erected, with boardings about it covered with glaring advertisements.

626 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
EVERYBOY and EVERYGIRL are discovered coming down the street. In the foreground 
ts a STRANGER of tall, slim build. His face is kindly, with deep-set twinkling eyes. 
About these, many humorous crowsfeet gather apparently planted by endless pleasure in 
his daily work. His hands are noticeable for their long and slender fingers, and his 
gestures, though few, are very graceful. 
STRANGER—Pray pardon me, but are you residents, here? 
EVERYBOY (pointing down the street)—Yes, that’s our house, the one with the two 
cupolas and the fancy piazza. 
STRANGER—I was anxious to know what is to be the architecture of the new library. 
EvERYBOY—You can search me! It’ll have columns though. I saw the founda- 
tions for ’em. 
STRANGER—Ah! I thought perhaps the plans had been printed. 
EVERYBOY—Yes, so they were—in the papers, but I didn’t notice particularly. 
The columns are in front and the roof is low. I guess it’s what you’d call “Old 
Style.” Anyhow, it’s different from Boomer’s Business Block that was built last 
year. The architect for that was one of our town builders and I guess he studied 
up the latest styles before he built it. 
STRANGER—Perhaps he did. 
EveryBoY—I know him, and I’ll bet he didn’t copy anything. He’s a hustler; 
he’d rather invent new styles than copy old ones. 
STRANGER—Yet some old styles were very beautiful. Have you earned in school 
to know some of the famous buildings from which we’ve drawn so much I see about 
me? 
EveRYBOY—How do you mean “‘in school”—in the drawing room with FAITH, 
our teacher? 
STRANGER—Yes, with your teacher, FAITH. 
EveryBoy—No, she doesn’t teach anything about buildings. 
STRANGER—Perhaps she teaches you about design as it appears in the hats and 
dresses I see in the windows here. 
EVERYGIRL—Oh, you’re making fun. 
STRANGER—No, I’m serious. 
EVERYGIRL—Why, we study design; but our designs are for curtain borders. 
I’ve just made a picture after Corot, and my brother is making a design for a candle- 
sconce, and at home he is making a pillow with a girl’s head on it—burning it—you 
know how. 
STRANGER—Yes, I’ve seen such. But let me ask: Isn’t that window there with 
its dresses only a big design? 
EVERYGIRL—What do you mean? 
STRANGER—Why, that curtain behind is the background, is it not? And the 
dresses are the big spots, and that row of hats is a border. 
EvERYGIRL—That’s funny. I never thought so, but it is a design—only it’s 
not a very good one. 
STRANGER—I think you're right, but why isn’t it good? 
EVERYGIRL—Why, it looks so scattered. 
STRANGER—Just so; but how about the dresses themselves—are they designs too? 
EVERYGIRL—I can’t see how; they have no spots and borders. 
STRANGER—Oh, but haven’t they? Look at that brown one—hasn’t that some 
big masses? 
EVERYGIRL—You mean the yoke and those cuffs?
-P-A-G-E-637
  
FINE ARTS 627 
STRANGER—Exactly. 
EVvERYGIRL—But how can it be a design with that great line of trimming running 
cat-a-corner across the front? q 
EveRYBoy—(with some heat) If that’s a design it’s a mighty bad one. 
STRANGER—True again! 
EveRYBoY—I see; you mean the dresses are designs, but some are good and some 
are bad. 
STRANGER—Yes, that’s just what I had in mind. 
EveryBoy—And do you mean that about the shop windows too—that every one 
is a design? 
STRANGER—Yes, everyone is a design. 
EVERYGIRL (keenly interested) —And is that true of the hats, too? 
STRANGER—Well, what do you say? How about those two in the middle of the 
next window? 
» EveryGIRL—I like the blue one’s shape—but that’s only a cheap hat. Why, 
the other has a real willow plume. 
STRANGER—Yes, but does the willow plume make it a good design? 
EvERYGIRL—Why—Why—(lost in the struggle between admiration of cost and 
pattern)—the most expensive ought to be the best, oughtn’t it? 
STRANGER—Beauty, unfortunately, is not determined by price. 
EVERYGIRL—Well, that willow is a fright, but I never would have dared to say 
it, because—they’re all the style now. 
STRANGER—Would you make yourself ugly for fashion’s sake? 
EvERYGIRL—How funny you are! No, of course not—that is, not real ugly. 
But one must follow the fashion, musn’t one? Why, we're just buying a new wall 
paper for our parlor—because it’s in style, though (doubtfully) it’s not the kind of 
design I think you’d like. 
STRANGER—Why not? 
Everysoy (breaking in)—Sis is right; you’d faint at it! It’s got roses the size 
of a plate and tulips bigger; but Ma heard it was the fashion, so she fell for it. 
STRANGER—But perhaps the wall paper will make the room a good design. 
EveryBoy—The room! You mean to say you look at a room as a design, like 
these hats and dresses and shop windows? 
STRANGER—Well, you shall say. How about the walls? 
EverRYBoY—Why—why—of course the pictures make spots on ’em. 
STRANGER—Y es? 
EverRyBoy—The big pictures make big spots and the little ones little spots, and 
the mantelpiece and the windows are the biggest. Why, of course—I see; only I 
never thought of it that way before. 
EVERYGIRL (who has been absorbed in thought before the window of hats)—Have you 
ever been to our school? 
STRANGER—No. 
EVERYGIRL (wistfully)—Couldn’t you come and talk to our class—I think Faith 
would let you—and tell us about design in hats and dresses and things? 
EvERYBOY (eagerly)—Yes, and about houses and rooms! My father would like 
us to know about things like that. He’s all for use—he’s a printer, and I’m going 
to be one. Doesn’t this design business cut any ice in printing? 
STRANGER—It certainly does. 
EVERYBODY (with decision)—Well, come along then. FattH will let you talk, I 
know, and you can begin about the house and then go on to the other things.

Enter EVERYBOY and EVERYGIRL dragging STRANGER by the hand. 
EVERYBOY (eagerly)—Oh, Faitn, here is a gentleman we met on the street who is 
so interested in design! 
EVERYGIRL—And he knows all about hats and dresses and things and he says he’ll 
talk to our class if you'll let him. 
EveryBoy—Yes, but he’s to begin with a talk on wall paper and the home, be- 
cause Sis and I have a hurry up call for that information. Can’t he give us a lesson? 
FaitH (demurring)—Why, this is very sudden. (Politely to Stranger.) Of course, 
we are always glad to receive visitors, but—but (with an inspiration)—have you 
had a Normal Art School training? 
STRANGER—No, that I have not had. 
FaitH—Then I’m afraid you wouldn’t teach according to our methods. 
EVERYBOY (anxiously)—Oh, FAITH, just let him try. You'll like it. Why he 
had sister hypnotized in two passes, and he made us see designs everywhere—in 
the windows, and in dresses and hats. Just let him make a start—you’ll like it. 
FaitH—Well, the young people seem so eager. I’m not sure that it’s right, but 
T’ve an hour without a class, so if you really care. 
EveRYGIRL—Lovely! I’ll. get some of the class from the study hall. (Runs out.) 
STRANGER—So, I’m to begin on the home, am I? 
EveryBoy—Yes, start in on the wall paper. 
STRANGER (fo Faith)—Have you anything here I could use to illustrate home 
furnishings? 
FairH—Why, yes. (She rummages in a closet and produces a stencil with one 
torner torn, and. a wood-block showing an archaic flower surrounded by a massive border. 
She offers these to the STRANGER.) The stencil I use to explain borders and the wood- 
block is for all over patterns. 
STRANGER (smiles)—Thank you; but for my lesson I shall need something more. 
(Pulls a pad from his pocket and hastily writes several brief notes.) (To Everyboy) 
Will you get two or three of your classmates to secure this material quickly; 
Everysoy—Back in a jiffy—don’t start till I come. 
STRANGER (smiling)—Do not fear. I will not—indeed I cannot. 
(Exit EVERYBOY, running.) 
FaitH—Now I must ask your name. The children were so impetuous I didn’t 
get a chance to learn what to call you. 
STRANGER—Ah, my name? Different people call me by different names. At 
present you may call me STRANGER. Perhaps later, when you’ve known me longer, 
you'll guess what my real name is. 
(Curtain.) 
(The same scene 15 minutes later.) 
Fait and the STRANGER are discovered. He has just finished clearing the board of 
tts scraps of drawing and writing and is about to take down the Japanese drawings 
and the pictures ‘‘a la Corot.” 
Enter EVERYGIRL, with an eager group of young people, followed by EVERYBOY 
with three of his companions bearing several packages, which they open, disclosing some 
big catalogues of furniture makers, others of certain manufacturers, a half dozen trade
-P-A-G-E-639
FINE ARTS 629 
magazines on furnishing, some samples of draperies, a roll of wall paper and a score of 
gray mounting boards. STRANGER rapidly selects various examples from the books 
and has the boys and girls cut these out and mount them on the gray cards. These he 
pins in pairs along the blackboard, each pair showing a good example contrasted with 
@ poor one—chairs, curtains, window draperies, wall papers and the like. 
As the last pair are hung in place, the STRANGER turns and begins to draw upon the 
board. The children watch him delightedly as lamps, chandeliers, hangings, and bits 
of pattern flow from his flying chalk. He turns with a smile. 
STRANGER—Now, we're ready. But you must draw too—this isn’t to be a lis- 
tening lesson, but a “‘doing ” one. First we’ll talk about this simple room wall, 
with its doors, its wainscot, its pictures and its mantelpiece. Let us determine 
whether this is a design, and if so what is the center of interest in it. (Everyboy’s 
hand flies up and others follow slowly.) 
At this moment DousT appears and she stands acutely interested as STRANGER 
passes questions about the room and the pupils draw patterns made up of bits of room 
decoration—a picture between two windows, a group of pictures on a wall panel, a 
mantelpiece with its ornaments, eic. 
As STRANGER stops this analysis and turns to talk about the wall paper, DOUBT 
passes over to FAITH and whispers. 
Doust—Who is teaching? 
FairH—Some one the children brought in to give a lesson on the home. His 
teaching is different from mine, but the pupils seem to like it. 
Doust—What is his name? 
FarrH—He told me I might call him STRANGER but I suspect that’s not his real 
name. 
Doupt—Where have I seen him before? Ah! Now I remember. It was in a 
great industrial museum, filled with the work of famous craftsmen. He attracted 
my attention because as he walked through the many rooms he seemed so happy 
and so much at home. 
(Curtain.) 
EPILOGUE 
Between Scene IV and the Epilogue an interval of six months is supposed to 
elapse. 
In this time the STRANGER has developed his lessons on the home and has gone 
on to teach similarly in regard to dress, the architecture of the town, its commercial 
and its civic art. 
The pupils have made many notes and scores of sketches. They have recited 
frequently from their notes and have become familiar with the books which deal 
in a simple way with the topics referred to. The note books are filled with clippings 
from many sources, illustrating good and bad examples of design in the subjects 
studied and they have helped gather illustrative material for the class room lessons. 
The class room itself has been metamorphosed. ‘The headless Nike is gone. The 
bulletin board bears three or four well spaced and well arranged notices. A great 
exhibition panel on one side is covered with mounted cards of dress, furniture and 
interior decorations and room decorations, and a similar panel on the other side 
bears a score of designs by the pupils of similar problems solved by themselves. 
The blackboard is covered with sketches of lamps and lamp posts which have form- 
ed illustrations for a lesson on civic art. 
The stranger’s reputation as a teacher has spread. Dousrt has frequently come 
in, in company with many of the parents of the pupils, PRACTICAL has become

interested through reading his son’s notes on Commercial Art and has induced 
the STRANGER to give some talks at the Public Library. These have dealt with 
improvement of the town through attention to the advertisements on the boards 
ings, to the development of a civic center, to the clearing up of the clutter of shed- 
around the railroad station, and the making of this space a gateway to the town 
set out with a fountain, trees and flowers. On the strength of these talks a “‘Com- 
mittee on Town Betterment” has been organized. 
The scene shows the steps of the town library after the STRANGER’s last lecture. 
This has described how EVERYTOWN is to be made a beautiful place of well kept 
homes, lovely parks and civic buildings designed in a common scheme—partly by 
the work of the new town committee and partly by the training of EvERyBoy and 
EVERYGIRL and their mates to an understanding of what makes for beauty in things 
that touch the home and public life of each citizen. 
The STRANGER’S last words of this talk are still ringing in the ears of all: “Be 
jealous of everything that tends to make life ugly, for ugliness and evil are consorts. 
You'll seldom find one without the other.” 
STRANGER—Now, good friends, I must leave you. 
Doust—You mean you are leaving EVERYTOWN? 
STRANGER— Yes. 
Dovust—But you'll return, will you not? 
STRANGER—Yes, I’ll always be at your call so long as FaITH carries on our lessons 
and PRACTICAL keeps the new committee pressing forward the good work. (All 
crowd around him to say farewell.) 
_ FairH—But you haven’t told us your real name yet—nor just what is your real 
business. 
STRANGER—Well, I’ll tell you my business and then you shall say who I am. 
My business is to quicken in people everywhere a sense of what is truly fine—to 
make them grow in taste through constant choosing between good forms and bad 
—to make them understand that beauty is not something to be put up by others 
for them to admire, but something which they should create whenever they dress 
themselves, deck their rooms, plan their houses, or set forth the windows of their 
shops. 
It is mine to show to PRACTICAL that the laws of beauty affect his prosperity 
at every turn and that to know them is to have a business asset of immense value. 
It is mine to show to COMPLACENCY that these same laws apply to her life and that 
for her to know them is to enable her to add to the home its most seductive charm. 
Most of all, it is mine to show FAITH how she may apply this teaching to the class 
room, making her work touch in vital ways every phase of the life the chiid sees 
about him—for know you, FaitH, Doust, CoMPLACENCY, and PRACTICAL, that it 
is to EVERYBOY and EVERYGIRL and their children that we must look to see the civic 
spirit grow and burgeon into finer and finer forms as these citizens grow to be sensi- 
tive to everything that touches their town and its civic welfare. 
As the STRANGER speaks, FaitH’s eyes have grown clearer and brighter and the color 
has mounted to her cheeks. PRACTICAL is leaning forward smiling and EVERYBOY’S 
and EVERYGIRL’s breath is coming in little gasps of excitement. As he concludes, 
EVERYBOY and EVERYGIRL speak with one voice. 
Everypoy and EVERYGIRL—Why, you must be Art. 
ALL (echo)—Why, of course you’re Art! 
STRANGER (smiling)—Did I not say that when I was no longer a stranger to you 
you would know my name without the telling? 
 
-P-A-G-E-641
    
FINE ARTS 631 
PRACTICAL (with conviction)—Why, I thought so, long ago, but your lessons were 
so full of common sense and useful I couldn’t believe it was you. 
(Curtain.) 
I. The purpose of art teaching: 
The true purpose of art teaching is the education of the whole 
people for appreciation. 
Prof. Arthur Wesley Dow, in his Theory and Practice of Teach- 
ing Art, says: 
A training that calls for a very direct exercise of the critical powers, developing 
judgment and skill, is a training that will increase the individual’s efficiency what- 
ever his calling may be. 
The general public has not thought of art education in this way, but has acknowl- 
edged the value of “‘drawing,”’ especially when it can serve some utilitarian purpose. 
A better understanding of the true usefulness of art recognizes creative power as 
a divine gift, the natural endowment of every human soul, showing itself at first 
in the form that we call appreciation. 
This appreciation leads a certain number to produce actual works of art, greater 
or lesser—perhaps a temple, perhaps only a cup—but it leads the majority to desire 
finer form and more harmony of tone and color in surroundings and in things for 
daily use. It is the individual’s right to have full control of these powers. 
Even from the economic side, that education is deficient which leaves one unable 
to judge of form and color when he is constantly required to use judgment. This 
lack of appreciation is responsible for an immense waste of labor, skill, and money, 
in the production of useless and ugly things. Works of fine art stand among the 
things which the world prizes most highly. A nation’s ideals are revealed in its 
art, and its art has greatest value when it is the expression of the spirit of the whole 
people. 
In a sympathetic public is found the life-giving influence which creates works 
of fine art, and the measure of their excellence is the measure of the nation’s appreci- 
ation. 
The attainment of such an end as this places public art education above mere 
training in drawing, painting, or modeling, and above the so-called practical appli- 
cations. The work must be organized for a steady growth in good judgment as 
to form, tone and color, through all grades from the kindergarten to the university. 
The main question at all stages is whether the art work of the school is making 
this good red blood of appreciation and giving to the individual the greatest pos- 
sible encouragement to express himself. 
II. The art language. 
In the space-arts the elements are but three: 
Line—the boundary of a space. 
Dark-and-light—the mass, or quantity of light. 
Color—the quality of light. 
These constitute a language for all forms of space-art whether representative 
or decorative; architectural, sculptural or pictorial. There is no necessity for any 
twofold division into representation and design. Design is rather the very begin- 
ning, the primer of art, and there is one sense in which all good space-art may be 
called design. 
Under the heading of Line may be grouped all kinds of line harmony, beauty of 
color, or proportion of spaces, relations of size—all drawing, whether representative 
or decorative.

632 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Under Dark-and-Light, elementary and advanced tone study, painting; com 
position of masses in architecture, patterns and pictures. 
Under Color, the theory of color, relations of hue, dark and light color, and in- 
tensity—color harmony. 
When there is a natural relation between the art lesson and some other topic 
the art teacher takes advantage of it. The opportunities are many to ally the art 
work with history, mathematics, geography, and literature. Obviously there is 
an intimate connection between the manual arts and the work in design and draw- 
ing; but the art course to realize its purpose, must he a unit in its aim, through all 
grades. It must stand, first and last, for growth in critical judgment and apprecia- 
tion of harmony.” 
The progressive training through all grades in a perception of fine relations of 
space, tone and color, and the skill acquired in execution are assets alike to the one 
who goes on to the higher grades, and the one who leaves school to enter the ranks 
of wage earners. The industries need trained minds more than trained hands. 
III. Genetic psychology of drawing development in the individual: 
Dr. Geog Kerschensteiner, director of education in the schools of 
Munich, Bavaria, says: 
1. A child draws what he knows, not what he sees, and at first with little reference 
to proportion or harmony. 94 per cent of all children do this until the seventh 
year. 
2. As a result of observation, the feeling for form, line, shapes, correct position, 
proportion, and rhythm,—come. 
3. Later the silhouette stage develops—two dimensions, no perspective. 
4, Last, the perspective stage appears—slight perspective, overlapping, and three 
dimensions. Few reach this stage of their own initiative, and not many before 
ten years of age. ‘ 
5. The conscious stage of perspective (beginning n boys at seven and girls at 
nine) develops slowly. Even at ten and thirteen, respectively, children barely 
understand it. 
6. To draw well children need: 
Good observation. 
Clear memory. 
Lively imagination. 
Strong emotional nature. 
Aesthetic sense. 
Manual skill. 
IV. Conclusions from the study of art in childhood (Kerschensteiner): 
1. Method and matter must be judged by their value and the meaning to the 
child alone. (There should be no uniform or mass teaching, but the method should 
consider individual differences.) 
2. Drawing activities arranged in a hierarchy, are as follows: 
a. Wigwagging of the scribble pencil (purposeless). 
b. The child sees meaning in the scribble. 
c. His mental image next directs, guides, and controls the drawing move- 
ments. 
d. He recognizes and names the product. (His own idea of the object.) 
e. He draws stories.  
-P-A-G-E-643
  
  FINE ARTS 633 
f. He copies pictures. 
g. He copies objects in nature, and begins to use representation (two di- 
mensions). 
h. He foreshortens areas—(angles, receding of lines). 
i. He distinguishes between light and shade. 
8. Systematic art instruction should be given after ten years of age. 
4, Puberty shows signs of pure art development. 
5. Artistic drawing is not a language that any large number of adults will ever 
speak—therefore stress appreciation. 
6. Mechanical drawing and graphs in science should be studied by all pupils. 
7. Art intensifies life so art products are made and enjoyed. There should be 
pictures on school walls, the children having a voice in their selection. 
8. Pictures should be exchanged from room to room. 
9. More time should be given to seeing pictures, less to drawing. A wise teach- 
er will find out how individual children choose pictures. Children should be en- 
couraged to make picture collections or picture books, and they should be circu- 
lated as books of fiction and travel are. 
10. There should be: 
a. Art museums for experts. 
b. Art museums for aid of artists themselves. 
c. Art museums for the working people. 
d. Art museums for children. 
e. Art museums, with lantern lectures, special rooms, special days for teach- 
ers and children. 
11. The art teacher must know: 
a. A little of the theories of art. 
b. Great men of art. 
c. How to make a choice selection of pictures that appeal to her soul. 
Note: The following course has received valuable contributions, 
criticism and suggestion from Miss Olivia Keech, supervisor of 
drawing in the Baltimore City Schools. 
General points: 
1. The brush and water color is the medium in the first three 
grades. 
2. Crayon is the medium for color in the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
grades. 
3. Water color (flat washes) is the medium of expression for the 
seventh and eighth grades. 
4, There must be practice papers in drawing as in writing, or any 
other subject that involves technique. The “result papers” grow 
out of the practice papers. 
5. Each lesson period should open with a few minutes’ practice 
| in studying directions, covering with pencil, drawing in the air and 
on paper long lines for freedom of movement. 
_ 6. We make a mistake by attempting too much in both drawing 
and designing in the elementary school.

7, When spray or flower lessons are given the specimens should 
be put in a position that shows the natural growth, and not pinned 
on paper. To do this, clay or small-necked bottles should be used 
to hold the specimens. 
FIFTH GRADE 
FALL WorK 
I. Leaf Study (Out of this should grow the idea of “‘foreshort- 
ening’’). 
Single Leaf study: 
Leaves should be held: 
Opposite the eye. 
Below the eye (Side view only). 
Above the eye. 
First—Silhouette with brush and ink. 
Second—Block in the outline with pencil. 
II. Simple sprays of leaves (two or three leaves only). 
First—Silhouette. 
Second—Outline with pencil. 
REFERENCE; Prang, Art Text Book V, pp. 20-21. 
III. Tree Study: 
Block in the outline for proportion and characteristic shapes. 
(Study: maple, apple and poplar.) 
IV. Lettering: 
Learn the plan, then practice the letters. (Ref. Prang, Art 
Book V, pp. 69-70.) 
Plan a book cover and letter the title. (Use a one-word title 
only, and make all letters the same height.) 
(Lettering should be begun early in the year’s work and the | 
effects should be seen in map-work in geography and history, and © 
in the industrial arts work.) : | 
WINTER WORK 
I. Study of objects. Foreshortening of the circle. 
| The chief points for study are good blocking for shape and ao 
portion, and representing thickness of edges. 
For illustration use small pans or paper rolled into a hollow 
cylinder. These should be held: © 
At the level of the eye. 
Below the eye. 
Above the eye. 
(The teacher should aid the pupils by drawing ellipses on the 
board as they appear to the eye at different levels, so that the pupils 
may compare the ellipse on the objects they see it with the ellipses 
on the board.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-645
FINE ARTS—SIXTH GRADE 635 
(Practice ellipses with free arm movement, at the blackboard 
and on paper.) i 
II. Study of Oljects—For near and far position. 
Use a group of two objects—cylinder and sphere, or two cyl- 
inders of different heights, or a tumbler with an apple, or a tumbler 
with an orange. 
IIT. Design: 
Cutting squares for shape and size relation. Designs should 
be developed in black and white, or in two values. 
Apply to mats, rugs, bags, book covers, etc., and also outline 
on clay for tiles. The principal problems of this grade are designs 
for the industrial arts project. 
SPRING WORK 
I. Leaf Sprays. Foreshortening reviewed. 
Use green crayon instead of pencil. 
ITI. Flowers: 
Paint simple spring flowers (as the tulip and jonquil), in ink 
silhouette, studying only shapes and growth. 
III. Landscape: 
Sky and ground; trees in the distance; near and far trees and 
a road. (All these studies are related to the foreshortening of the 
circle.) ‘ 
General: 
Take the class for a visit to an Art Gallery—The Peabody, Wal- 
ters’, the Maryland Institute,—the Handicraft Shop; a church or a 
cathedral—to study pottery, rugs, mosaics, posters. Wherever 
possible use the stereopticon or radiopticon to show pictures of 
cathedrals, designs, birds, flowers, etc., to show line harmony and 
color composition. 
SIXTH GRADE 
Fatt Work 
I. Leaf Study: 
The idea of “foreshortening” (begun in the fifth grade) is 
continued. 
Leaves should be held: 
Opposite the eye. 
Below the eye (forward and backward views). 
Above the eye. 
First—Silhouette with brush and ink. 
Second—Block in the outline with pencil. 
Finish the work in accented outline. Read Prang, Art Text 
Book VI, p. 22, for character of line,

II. Leaf Sprays: 
(More leaves than were used in the fifth grade.) 
First—Silhouette with brush and ink. 
Second—Block in the outline with pencil. 
Third—Finish in three values (lead pencil) following the scale. 
TI. Tree Study: 
Block in the outline for proportion and characteristic shapes. 
(Study oaks, elms, and evergreens.) 
IV. Lettering: 
Practise letters and use them in some decorative way, studying 
good spacing and pleasing proportions. 
WINTER WORK 
I. Study of objects—thickness of edges. 
Review foreshortening and add the problem of thickness. The 
teacher should make blackboard sketches of a flat edge, a round 
edge, and a rolled edge; the pupils should find these edges on ob- 
jects in the room, and should imitate the teacher’s sketches. 
Sketch from a round-edged bowl and a flat-edged flower pot, 
with careful study of shapes, proportions, and thickness. Finish 
in accented outline. 
IT. Study of objects—for near and far position: 
Use a group of two objects; study the contour of sides, thick- 
ness of edges, good size and right placing. 
IIT. Design: 
Cutting of both square and oblong spaces for size and shape 
relations. 
Change the square design to fit oblong shapes. Apply to 
box tops, bottoms of work bags, belts, etc., and use appropriate 
lettering when needed. 
SPRING WORK 
I. Leaves and sprays (More difficult than those used in the fifth 
grade.): 
IT, Flowers: 
Draw, using colored crayons, spring growths, such as the pussy 
willow, catkins, etc., or simple flowers. 
ITI. Landscape: 
Same as the fifth grade, but treated differently. The treat- 
ment here is crayon, but the color should be grayed by using pencil 
under it. 
General: 
Take the class to visit a picture gallery—the Peabody, Walters’, 
the Maryland Institute, the Handicraft Shop, a church, a cathedral,

  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
Suggestions for the Teaching of Industrial Arts in the 
Grades. The growth of industry in modern times has been such 
as to place it at the very front among the interests of communities 
and nations. And this rapid development of means for cheap manu- 
facture and transportation has resulted in the withdrawal of the in- 
dustries formerly carried on in the home and the transplanting of 
them into factories and shops. The child of today is thus de- 
prived, except in a few cases, of the opportunity to observe or to 
participate in the industrial processes which form the basis of our life 
and achievement. 
Under the industrial conditions of the present day, with the bindeiet 
human modern machinery and the highly specialized activities in 
which each worker does but a small part of the work, there is danger 
of the worker becoming a mere tool and having no real understand- 
ing of the great work that is going on around him. 
In 1910, of all the people in the United States engaged in gainful 
occupations, 70.5 per cent were employed in productive industry 
of some kind. In the manufacturing industries alone in the same 
year there were employed over 145,000 children under sixteen years 
of age. Such conditions clearly indicate the need of some form of 
industrial education for this great mass of children who are forced 
into the industries without the advantages of even a pre-vocational 
education. 
For many years the schools have tried to meet this need through 
various forms of manual training, but in this work too much stress 
was placed on skill and execution and too little on the thought con- 
tent of the work. During the last five or six years the growing em- 
phasis placed upon the social meaning of education has caused 
attention to be turned more and more to the subject matter or con- 
tent side of manual training, and under the new term, zndustrial 
arts, it has become a study for interpreting the industries, giving a 
knowledge of materials and processes, and developing a general 
industrial intelligence. 
In the first three grades the work centers mainly around the ac- 
tivities of the home and the community and these activities are 
imitated in projects made of paper, cardboard, clay and other ma- 
terials which are easily manipulated. Too much emphasis should 
not be placed upon accuracy, precision, or technical excellence of 
a high order in any phase of constructive work in these grades, nor

should the industrial idea be the most dominant; but the chief 
aim should be the expression of ideas in industrial materials and the 
growth of interest, intelligence, and judgment in occupational ac- 
tivities going on in the child’s immediate environment. In the 
fourth and fifth grades the industrial motive should receive increas- 
ing emphasis and processes employed should be as far as possible 
typically illustrative of those actually used in the industries. 
Because the simplest industrial processes are often the most primi- 
tive the approach to them is frequently made through the study of 
primitive life. When textile processes, for example, are to be stud- 
ied, the need of clothing may be emphasized, and means suggested 
for gratifying thisneed. Projects for carding, spinning, and weaving 
may be carried out in simple ways and illustrated by reference to 
actual operations in bygone times, but to rediscover every step in 
the original development of these arts is to miss the true purpose 
of industrial education. The industrial aspects of the study, as 
distinguished from the historical, require that the child should ac- 
quire in some way and at some time—presumably in many ways . 
and at widely separated times—a fairly well rounded conception of 
textile processes and become familiar with the most important types 
of textile products. It is not enough to acquire a knowledge of the 
primitive process of spinning and then to pass on to the weaving of 
a simple rug Spinning is an important industry in modern life; 
it means yarns for all manner of fabrics made from a great variety 
of raw materials; it means thread of all kinds; it means cordage; 
and yet the processes are simple, and, by actual demonstration, 
supplemented by illustrations gotten from magazines and papers 
or by visits to neighboring factories, the children can get an adequate 
conception of the extent of these industries and of their bearing upon 
everyday life. 
Dean James E. Russell, of Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity, says, “Of late, primary teachers have adopted clay as a con- 
venient medium for expressing art forms. The result is thirty 
plaques, thirty ink wells, or thirty vases—all very pretty, decorated 
and glazed, when put in a row on exhibition day. So far I have no 
criticism. My complaint is that they stop right there. The chief 
processes in the clay industries are very few; hand molding, turning 
on the potter’s wheel, pressing into set forms, and building up in 
permanent shape, as in cement and concrete construction. Why 
not, then, pass from hand moulding, which can be approached 
through primitive types, to the use of the potter’s wheel? A single 
demonstration of this machine, with the use of illustrations which
-P-A-G-E-651
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 641 
may be had in abundance, will give the clue to the entire round of 
the pottery industries. A few samples varying from unglazed earth- 
enware to fine china, will complete the teaching equipment. Next 
come brick and terra cotta. But who has ever heard of brick- 
making in school? I should like to hear of it because it is an im- 
mense industry, the products of which are visible on every hand— 
soft brick, hard brick, fire brick, red brick, yellow brick, ornamental 
brick, terra cotta. Why should not our children know more about~ 
these things than we do? I venture to say that ten hours of in- 
struction judiciously spread over two or three years, and properly 
correlated with nature study and geography, will give to sixth grade 
children a better appreciation of one of the staple building materials 
than ninety out of every hundred adults have today. Is it worth 
the time? If so, the time can be found.” 
The materials of most significance in the industries are (1) foods, 
(2) textiles, (3) woods, (4) paper, (5) metals, (6) clays and allied 
earth products. Upon these materials our course in industrial arts 
is based. 
The facts concerning the production, manufacture, and distri- 
bution of the materials constitute the subject matter of the work. 
This is closely correlated with the history, geography, nature study, 
art, and arithmetic of the grade and helps to vitalize those subjects 
as nothing else could. The work is filled with problems upon which 
to base the most practical kind of arithmetic, the need of patterns 
and designs furnishes a motive for the art work, while the evolution 
of an industry is but the history of the race through its successive 
stages of development. 
Projects made of each material are planned not so much to de- 
velop technical skill, as to interpret and explain the manufacturing 
processes. Professor Bonser says: ‘‘Degrees of excellence in fin- 
ished projects are to be measured in terms of the child’s own best 
efforts, without much repetition, rather than in terms of adult 
excellence.” 
Every project made should meet the following requirements: 
1. It should be suited to the child’s stage of development. 
2. It should encourage some independence of thought and lead 
to an understanding of the materials and tools used. 
3. It should be made for a definite purpose. 
4. It should lead to an interpretation and understanding of some 
industrial process. 
5. It should have a social value.
-P-A-G-E-652

The aim of the work as a whole is to bring the life in the school into 
closer touch with the life outside the school; to help the pupils be- 
come alert, intelligent and appreciative in any industrial situation in 
which they may be placed; to develop better judgment in deter- 
mining the worth of products, better judgment and taste in the 
selection of clothing and furniture, and more knowledge of the 
necessary food elements and therefore more care in combining them. 
The success of the work will depend upon the teacher’s understand- 
ing of the spirit, the meaning, and the significance of industrial arts.

FIRST GRADE 
The work of the First Grade deals largely with those phases of 
social and industrial life which contribute to the home and an attempt - 
will be made to so relate industrial arts to the simple study of in- 
dustrial activity that in the child’s mind there shall be little differ- 
entiation between discussion and doing. The main object is to 
establish a point of view or general attitude toward everyday things 
the children have, rather than to accumulate any amount of knowl- 
edge or develop technique. The children are introduced to various 
industries and materials and they learn a few simple facts, as much 
as a little child can assimilate, in relation to foods, textiles, woods, 
paper, metals, clays and allied earth-products, and projects will be 
presented which the problem sets and the children can accomplish. 
This outline is closely correlated with the history for this grade. 
Aside from the work given to clarify the ideas in relation to in- 
dustrial activity, opportunity is also provided for constructive work 
from the standpoint of expression. It is the manipulation of ma- 
rials in relation to school activities. 
x" Observe the following suggestions in presenting lessons: 
a. Distribute and collect material without friction, and waste of 
time. 
b. Discuss the project, and make directions simple, clear, and 
direct.

SECOND GRADE 
The work of the first grade is prescribed within a comparatively 
small, undifferentiated circle. The work of the second grade en- 
larges this circle of vision, and is still closely related to the lives and 
experiences of children, but with the introduction of some aspects 
of primitive life, there is an opportunity to define a little more clearly 
the study of industrial activity. The children are very much in- 
terested in the purely informational side when it is presented clearly 
and simply. Pictures are used, excursions are taken, informal dis- 
cussions are held. But the children’s chief interest centers in doing 
and making, and in the object made as an end in itself. The facts 
pertaining to foods, textiles, woods, paper, metals, clays and allied 
earth products will be presented very largely through a series of 
projects which help to clarify ideas and strengthen the general at- 
titude. 
As in the first grade the handwork will present two phases, viz.: 
(1) constructive activity in relation to the industrial problem; and 
(2) materials used for purposes of expression in answer to school 
needs. 
Some of the projects are a means to a better understanding of 
present industrial problems, others to aid in appreciating the prob- 
lems of primitive peoples and indirectly a clearer conception of our 
own. The problem arises in the discussion and the project is the 
result. 
In relation to the problem of school needs: Each lesson should be 
given as a result of a felt need, viz.: to serve some immediate use in 
school or home, which the children recognize as valid. Cuttings 
and foldings can be used in posters or to illustrate stories, or to make 
an illustrated booklet for individual or class purposes. 
Constructive work with materials affords opportunity for growth 
in skill, in neatness and accuracy, in the development of good taste. 
Each problem should be carefully considered by the teacher in 
order to secure results: 
1. Materials needed. 
2. Plan of procedure; worked out by the teacher to test order of 
difficulty. 
3. Models of illustration. 
Observe the following suggestions in presenting lessons: 
a. Distribution and collection of materials without friction, and 
waste of time. 
b. Discussion of the project, and the dictation, directions for the 
process for making should be simple, clear, and direct.

2 THIRD GRADE 
The work of the second grade aims to establish a point of view, 
and thereby create an interest in an appreciation of industrial 
activities, and upon this foundation the children of the third grade 
are led to recognize and to think of the things which serve their 
needs—food, clothing, shelter, as the products of industry, together 
with the materials, and the workers who produce them. The ne- 
cessities of life are supplied by transmuting or changing raw materials, 
clay, textiles, paper, wood, food, into manufactured products, so 
the work involves a study of these industries. 
The study of an industry requires that some informational ma- 
terial shall be given through discussion, pictures, excursions, and
-P-A-G-E-657
INDUSTRIAL ARTS—THIRD GRADE 647 
by doing some kind of constructive work. Sometimes the whole 
or a part of a period may be devoted to discussion, but the child’s 
chief interest lies in manipulation. Industrial arts ties up closely 
with geography and history and often the information is presented 
under these heads, but time is also taken for the manipulation of 
materials. Often part of the work is accomplished at home or in 
moments of leisure at school. It is not the purpose of the work 
used in illustration of the subject to emphasize the training of the 
hand though some skill in manipulation should be attained. _ Care- 
less work is not to be tolerated and a standard for third grade is 
the degree of perfection which is possible to secure through unaided 
effort. (A genuine desire for good work is stimulated through an 
interest in the project which develops a desire to do one’s best in 
order that the finished product may bring satisfaction. 
The work is kept on the level of the child’s constructive ability 
in order that he may do things by himself, thereby developing in- 
dependence and initiative’ In many instances neither patterns 
nor definite directions are given, simply the broad outline which the 
children are to fill in according to their own interpretation. 
. Another phase of constructive work affords some opportunity for 
growth in skill, in neatness and accuracy dnd the development of 
good taste. These are projects in relation to school needs. Most 
of this work will be the outgrowth of discussion and dictation by the 
teacher. . Both teacher and children should choose materials with 
care. A definite plan of procedure worked out by the teacher to 
test order of difficulty, and models for illustration should be freely 
used as incentives to good work. Observe the following suggestions 
in presenting lessons. 
a. Distribute and collect essai without friction and waste of 
time. 
b. Discuss the project, and give clear and direct dictation to aid 
in the process of making. 
c. Use blackboard illustrations freely. Make it a point to have 
both the illustration and steps in the dictation on the board. 
d. Exercise class judgment through judicious criticism. 
Nore: Save samples of projects made, for exhibit purposes. Chil- 
dren need to see work of classmates. : 
The outline which follows covers both phases of the work. Cut- 
tings, drawings, foldings, modelings, and any other free manipula- 
tive work done as seatwork should be effectively used in the pro- 
duction of posters, sandtable scenes and house problems similar 
to those of the second grade. A series of posters illustrating the

FOURTH GRADE 
The knowledge and appreciation gained by the children in the 
third year, of the workers of the world, their products and the ma- 
terials with which they work, is used as a foundation for enlarging 
ideals of service and interdependence in this grade. The same un- 
derlying principles guide in the selection of data for study; the 
fundamental needs of man—food, clothing, shelter, communication
-P-A-G-E-662
  652 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
and transportation—and the same need for dynamic effort is present 
since information is clarified by demonstration. The study of a 
chosen industry requires that informational material shall be 
given through some problem set which leads to observation, discussion 
and experiment. Pictures, excursions or visits to the place of in- 
dustry, talks with the industrial worker, collection of materials, and 
sometimes products are invaluable aids to clarify ideas. The study 
of an industry calls for some constructive work, for since children’s 
chief interest centers in doing things and in the object as the result | 
of effort, their appreciation of industrial activity goes hand in hand 
with knowledge if they are permitted to share experience with the real 
worker. Sometimes the whole recitation period is devoted to dis- 
cussion of the industry, sometimes only a part of the period, the 
rest of the time being given to manipulative work. The construc- 
tive work is therefore used to illustrate some phase of industrial 
activity or to supply school needs. Projects are related to some 
definite industrial problem or some specific school need which the 
children clearly understand. Often a subject in industrial arts is 
so closely tied with history or geography or nature study that the 
informational facts will be presented under these heads, and it wll 
be necessary only to briefly review them in the industrial art perioid 
to place them in their proper relation to the proposed constructive 
work. 
Constructive work through materials affords opportunity or 
growth in skill, in neatness and accuracy, in the development fof 
good taste. Both teacher and children should choose materials 
wisely. A definite plan of procedure should be worked out by the 
teacher to test order of difficulty. Models for illustration also serve 
as incentives to good work. 
Observe the following suggestions in presentation of lessons: 
a. Distribute and collect materials without friction and waste of 
time. 
b. Discuss the project, and give clear, and direct dictation to aid 
in the process of making. 
c. Use blackboard illustrations freely. Make it a point to have 
both the illustrations and steps in the dication on the board. 
d. Exercise class judgment through judicious criticism. 
Time allotment: Two half hour periods per week or eighty hours 
per year. If necessary, a drawing period may occasionally be taken 
for manipulative work. Some of the work will simply be demon- 
strated before the class, while collections and mounting are usually 
made outside of school hours. Time distribution: 35 lesson periods

FIFTH GRADE* 
Read carefully the Suggestions for Teaching Industrial Arts, pp. 
639-642, as the principles underlying the work are given here. Keep 
constantly in mind the meaning of the term industrial arts—an 
interpretation of the processes by which raw materials are transformed 
into products of greater use and higher value. 
Use the graphs on the pages following, which give statistics of 
Maryland’s manufactures, and of Maryland’s workers (both men 
and women) engaged in the various industrial occupations. 
I, Paper— How the race provides ttself with records.” 
1. Introduction:—Let the pupils discover, by adroit questioning, the materials 
in the room that have the most important effect upon their school life. Paper, 
books, printing—ought to stand out as absolutely necessary in their work. From 
this lead back into the home to find out the importance of paper there; then out 
into the community. 
The topic might also be introduced through The Story of the Alphabet by Clodd.

II. “ How the race provides itself with clothing.” 
1. Introduction:—Taking the child’s own clothing as the point of attack let each 
child bring samples, with their prices if possible, of materials that are used for cloth- 
ing in his home. Discuss these as to their various uses and value as clothing and 
classify them. 
Discuss the materials used as clothing (wool, cotton, silk, linen, rubber, furs, leath- 
er) and the suitability of these materials for different seasons, climates and occupa- 
tions. 
Discuss the main qualities one would desire in material used as clothing: (a) that 
it be pure; (b) that it will not fade; (c) that it will not spot; (d) that it will not shrink. 
2. Projects: 
a. Woven rug, belt or bag, introducing a pattern; making of a sewing bag or 
any article requiring easy sewing (by the girls); make arm bands of felt or cloth. 
(Select one of these.) 
b. Make charts of samples with their names, prices and widths. (Required.) 
c. Make tests for pure wool and pure silk. 
d. Make tests for fast colors and for setting colors. 
e. Make tests for shrinkage. 
f. Make collections of pictures that show weaving processes. Have each 
child keep in a notebook all directions given, and the result of all experiments 
made.) 
3. Subject matter: 
a. The sources for the raw materials used as clothing. 
b. Their relative value as clothing materials; relative value of prices. 
c. Short history of the evolution of weaving. (See outline at the end of this

ton goods, which are taken up in the third and fourth grades. 
e. Study the manufacturing processes of either silk or linen. 
f. Compare the clothing industry with other industries. 
g. Get statistics about the life and wages in a clothing factory.
-P-A-G-E-670
660 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
h. What is being done to improve conditions in these factories? 
i. Sweat Shops, Child Labor Laws, Consumers‘ League are important topics 
that should be discussed with the class. (See “The Survey” for information and 
pictures.) 
4, Correlated subject matter: 
In the geography topics (which will be studied some time during the year) 
the cotton producing states will help to recall this topic, as will also silk production 
in Asia, the wool countries of the world, and the flax producing areas. 
In the history topics the story of the “Coming of the Factory to America”’ will 
shed light upon industrial conditions in the early nineteenth century and will show 
how the spinning loom, steam and the cotton gin helped to revolutionize the manufac- 
turing of textiles. 
5. Correlated arithmetic: 
Estimate the cost of a child’s outfit (boy’s and girl’s) either for a single garment 
or for a wardrobe. Compare the cost of a child’s clothing for a month or a year 
with the salary budget of the father whose income is about the median income for 
your community.

III. “ How the race provides itself with shelter.” 
1. Introduction:—The reading might provide a motivation through castle life. 
The stories of Arthur and Robin Hood both suggest castles. A castle could be built 
on the sand table of small concrete blocks; if sand paper is used, then the architectural 
lines will be the most prominent idea. 
Another introduction might be made through a discussion of the building going 
on in the neighborhood of the school. A visit to watch the men work on the building 
would prove stimulating and instructive. 
2. Projects: 
. Clay tile or bricks. 
. Pottery—vases and dishes. 
. Concrete flower box. Select one. 
. Kite, bird, house, doll house (to be presented to one of the lower grades).

What effect this has on the furniture business. 
(2) Earthen materials: 
Bricks: 
History—Sun-dried bricks used in ancient times by the Egyptians, 
Assyrians and Babylonians. Many of these have great historic value 
on account of the inscriptions on them. Bricks were introduced into 
England by the Romans. 
The first bricks in America came from England. The value of bricks 
produced annually in our country now is over $78,000,000. How does this 
compare with the clothing industry? 
Kinds—common brick, pressed brick, fire brick, pavement or vitrified 
brick, hollow tile. 
© Use of each kind—common brick for inside walls and foundations; 
pressed brick for finishing, both interior and exterior; fire brick for walls 
of fire-proof buildings and for lining the fire-pots of furnaces and stoves; 
vitrified bricks contain lime, are very hard and are used for paving; hollow 
tiles are used for drainage.

1. Introduction:—Much of this topic will be taught in the geography, physiology 
and arithmetic periods. The phases so taught should be gathered together and or- 
ganized as a review around the topic “Foods.” Where new phases appear they 
should be taught in the industrial arts period Children should become acquainted 
with the main food elements: protein, fat, carbohydrates, water, and mineral. 
2. Projects: 
a. Make soup, cook rice, cook eggs, boil potatoes, cream left-over potatoes, dry 
fruit and cook it, prepare raw vegetables and raw fruit for the table. (Select

d. Make experiments to show that rotting fruit and vegetables will contami- 
nate perfect specimens with which they come in contact. 
e. Make a collection of food labels, wrappings, and containers. 
3. Subject matter: 
a. Needs of food: 
(1) To make new tissue in growing bodies. 
(2) To build up worn out cells. 
(3) To supply heat and energy. 
b. Kinds of food: 
(1) Flesh-making or building up foods. These are divided into two classes: 
proteins—lean meat and fowl, cheese, dried peas and beans, milk; and mineral 
foods—green vegetables such as lettuce, spinach and cabbage.
-P-A-G-E-673
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS—FIFTH GRADE 663 
(2) Heat and energy producing foods or starch and sugar foods—bread, rice, 
sugar, crackers, macaroni, potatoes and beans. These foods are called car- 
bohydrates. 
(3) Fat producing foods—fat meat, butter, nuts, sugar and starches. 
(4) Foods containing water—all foods, especially fruit and vegetables. 
c. A balanced diet: 
(1) A proper diet should always contain some elements from each of the five 
classes of food. 
(2) The proportion of food elements needed depends upon the age and the 
occupation of the consumer. A growing active child requires about an equal 
quantity of protein and carbohydrate,while a full-grown person needs several 
times as much carbohydrate (fuel food) as protein (tissue food.) A person 
who has much physical exercise needs more carbohydrates than one who leads 
a quiet life. 
d. The care of food: 
(1) Moist foods (milk, meat, bread, cake, vegetables) should be kept in a 
cool place to prevent fermentation. 
(2) Dry foods (flour, meal, sugar, salt, dried meat and dried fruit) should be 
kept in a dry, well ventilated place. 
(3) Milk should always be kept in a covered vessel and in one which has been 
sterilized by boiling. 
(4) A refrigerator to be sanitary should be frequently and thoroughly cleaned. 
(5) Cellars which are used as storage places for fruit and vegetables should 
have an annual coat of white-wash. 
(6) Weevils and beetles infest flour, meal and breakfast foods which are not 
properly protected. Hence flour and meal should be put through a fine sieve 
before using. 
(7) All food should be covered to protect it from flies which are great carriers 
of disease. The only way typhoid fever enters the body is through the alimen- 
tary canal. 
e. The preparation of foods in mills, packing houses, dairies, canneries, and 
bakeries:-— 
(1) Use of machinery in the preparation of food. 
(2) Pure food laws and government inspection. 
(3) Utilization of by-products. 
(4) Attractive wrappings for food products. 
(5) Advertising of food products. 
f. Transportation of food products: 
(1) Live animals in cattle cars. 
(2) Perishable products by refrigerator cars. 
(3) Perishable and nonperishable products by freight, express and parcel 
post. 
4. Correlated literature and art: 
a. The Windmill, Longfellow; The Mill, Phoebe Cary; Lucile, Owen Meredith, 
Chap. XVII and XIX.

SUGGESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
The following suggestions for a discussion were planned by Miss Olivia Hershner, 
Principal of the Lutherville School, who conducted a conference on industrial arts 
for all the Fifth Grade teachers of the County, March 9, 1918. The purpose of the 
conference was to make a survey of the work in order to determine whether the course 
is being interpreted by the teachers as efficiently as possible: 
I. CLOTHING 
1. Do you think if children were making a project with woolen material they 
would be interested in such things as the following? 
(a) Story of where wool is grown. 
(b) Story of how wool is made into cloth. 
(©) Some facts to remember in buying woolen clothing. 
(d) Some health problems in connection with woolen clothing. 
2. Name some of the points, which you consider most important for a fifth grade 
child, in the study of “‘linen.”” 
3. Do you think a fifth grade child should be able to discuss and apply the follow- 
ing suggestions? 
(a) Pressing and cleaning of clothes. 
(b) Learning to darn. 
(c) Patching saves clothing. 
(d) What it means to be well dressed. 
(e) The choice of colors for clothing. 
(f) Selecting a hat. 
(g) What to think about in buying materials; in buying ready made garments. 
(h) Some tests for choosing materials. 
(i) Ability to decide whether a pattern is printed, woven or embroidered. 
4. How have you correlated the work on “clothing” with the geography for the 
grade? Do you wait until the subject comes up in geography or do you make the 
opportunity for teaching the geography that relates to some phases of the textile 
industries? 
II. SHELTER 
1. In teaching shelter, which is more important, to study the different kinds of 
materials such as wood, bricks, cement, etc,. from a subject matter standpoint, or 
in some such way as the following:— 
(a) Have children build a miniature house, discuss different kinds of materials 
and thoroughly study the one used. 
(b) Arrangement of rooms. 
(c) Furnishing a bedroom, dining room, kitchen. 
(d) Care of the home—dusting, cleaning, laundering, etc. Is this practicable? 
If not, what will take its place? 
III. FOODS 
The course. of study outlines the subject matter on foods as follows: 
1. Needs of food. 
2. Kinds of food. 
3. A balanced diet. 
4. The care of food. 
5. Preparation in mills, canneries, etc. 
6. Transportation of food products.  
-P-A-G-E-675
INDUSTRIAL ARTS—FIFTH GRADE 665 
Study the following outline and decide whether it is the more suggestive of the 
two 
1. What we know about food and why we take it. 
2. Luncheon at school; study of the proper food for school lunches. 
3. The home supper. 
4, The home breakfast. 
5. The home dinner. 
6. Some other facts as arrangement of kitchen, ways of caring for food, buying 
proper amount and kinds. 
GENERAL QUESTIONS 
1. Do you use your correlated literature and pictures simply for pleasure and add- 
ed interest, or do you study the poems thoroughly and use the pictures for language 
work? 
a Which of the industries do you most enjoy teaching? Why? 
INFORMATION ON PAPER-MAKING 
(The type of detailed information a teacher of industrial arts should know about 
each of the five or six great industries that tie the busy life of the world together 
into one organic whole.) : 
(Adapted from The Story of Paper Making by F. O. Butler.) 
I, History: 
Men have in all ages been proud of their own achievements and have an in- 
stinctive desire to keep a record of those achievements so that the coming genera- 
tions might profit by their observations and experiences. 
The first method of transmitting knowledge was by oral tradition, but this 
often led to misunderstandings and imperfect knowledge, and as the races advanced 
in learning and civilization they realized that something more permanent and ac- 
curate was necessary; that without written records of some sort there could be little 
if any progress, since each generation would have to pass through the same stages 
of ignorance and inexperience. They naturally looked to nature for help and there 
found many materials which they used to record their history. 
1. Stones heaped in piles to commemorate great deeds or events. Frequently 
mentioned in the Bible. 
2. Stone obelisks carved in the hieroglyphs of the Egyptians. 
3. Clay tablets, carved and then baked in the sun. From these we get most 
of our history of the Assyrians and Babylonians. 
4, Skins and bones of animals, also used by the Egyptians. 
5. Wooden blocks and the bark of trees, 
6. Ivory and wax tablets. 
7. Metal plates, even of gold and silver, 
8. Leaves of the olive, palm and poplar tree. 
9. Papyrus, a reed-like plant found on the banks of the Nile. Its fibres were 
separated and laid edge to edge forming a flat surface of any desired size. 
10. Parchment made from the skins of sheep and goats. It was first used in 
Asia Minor, and is used in our day for diplomas and some public documents. 
II, Invention of paper: 
Paper from wood pulp was invented by the Chinese in the second century, 
B.C. For many years they kept the process a secret, but in 704 A. D., the Arabs 
captured a city in China and took some prisoners, who were skilled in paper-making. 
From them the Arabs learned the art, and the knowledge then spread to Greece and 
Rome, and all parts of Europe. i 
“Tt has been suggested that in regions where the water-plant called the conforna 
grows, Nature herself teaches the method of making paper from vegetable fibers 
beaten to a pulp. The plant consists of slender green filaments, similar to what is  
-P-A-G-E-676
  666 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
by the sun, it is finally, in some overflow of the water, cast upon the shores to dry, as 
veritable sheets of paper. But if Nature taught the process, man was slow to dis- 
cover the teacher, or to learn the lesson.” 
It was in 1189 A. D. that the art of making paper from pulp was introduced 
into France. At that time the French people were far in advance of the English 
in cultivation and in regard to the refinements of life. They were energetic, and 
took great delight in construction, manufacturing, and building. Profiting by their 
knowledge, they prosecuted this art with such zeal that they were soon in a position 
to supply not only the wants of France, but those of surrounding countries as well. 
The people of the Netherlands were stimulated by the example of France, and for 
a long period the French and Dutch were the best, and indeed, almost the only 
papers produced in Europe. No reliable record can be established as to the first 
paper-making in England. 
The first British patent for paper-making was granted to Charles Hildegard, 
February, 1665, for “‘the way and art of making blue paper used by sugar bakers, 
and,others.” A decade later, in January, 1675, was granted the second patent, 
already referred to in this chapter, which was for the making of “white paper for 
the use of writing and printing, being a new manufacture and never before prac- 
ticed in any way in any of our kingdoms or dominions.” 
The beginning of the industry in America was almost coincident with the grant- 
ing of patents for the manufacture of paper in England. A paper mill was estab- 
lished by William Rittenhouse, a native of Holland, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, 
in the year 1690, one of the builders and owners being William Bradford, a Phil- 
adelphia printer, who was afterward the owner of the first printing office in New 
York City. It was through him that Benjamin Franklin in 1723, received his first 
introduction to a temporary home, and employment in Philadelphia. The paper 
at this first American mill was made from linen rags, and the product was about 
two hundred and fifty pounds per day. The mill was on a stream subsequently 
called Paper-mill Run, which empties into the Wissahickon. 
The manufacture made rapid strides in this young and growing country, so 
that in 1770 there were forty paper mills in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
and Delaware. The advance among the leading nations of Europe during the same 
period was equally rapid. The manufacture was introduced into Massachusetts in 
1717, and into Norwich, Connecticut, in 1758, but the progress in New England 
was not so rapid as in the states where it had been first established. 
The first mill to be established in the northern. part of New York was erected 
at Troy in 1793. About that time, or in 1801, the postmaster of the city issued a 
special plea under the heading, “Please save your rags,” in which he said: ‘“‘The 
press contributes more to the diffusion of knowledge and information than any other 
medium; rags are the primary réquisite in the manufacture of paper, and without 
paper the newspapers of our country, those cheap, useful, and agreeable companions 
of the citizen and the farmer, which in a political and moral view are of the highest 
national importance, must decline.” He then went on to show how, with sufficient 
rags, the paper mills of the state could meet all demands; how the patriotic saving 
of rags had been inculcated and was practiced in New England, saving to Connecti- 
cut alone $50,000 a year, and how the thrifty New England housewife had reduced 
the methods of saving to a science, or rather to a fine art, and closed as follows: 
“The rich, who regard the interest of their country, will direct their children 
or domestics to place a box in some convenient place as a deposit for rags, that none 
may be lost: by being swept into the street or fire; the sales of which saving will 
reward the attention of the faithful servant, and encourage the prosperous enter- 
prise of prudence.” . i 
As we have already seen, the early paper-mills were greatly hampered by the 
scarcity of rags, and matters grew worse instead of better during the last fifteen 
years of the century. But the year 1800 brought some relief. Matthew Kooper, 
of France, who in the following year succeeded in making paper from straw and wood, 
invented a process by which 700 reams of clean, white paper were turned out weekly 
from such old written, printed, and waste paper as had previously been thrown 
away. In the face of a rag famine, such a process was a great boon to the paper 
manufacturer.  
-P-A-G-E-677
INDUSTRIAL ARTS—FIFTH GRADE 667 
Well might the “Boston News Letter” of 1769 exclaim in quaint old rhyme:. 
“Rags are as beauties which concealed lie, 
But when in paper charming to the eye! 
Pray save your rags, new beauties to discover, 
For of paper truly every one’s a lover; 
By the pen and press such knowledge is displayed 
As would not exist if paper was not made.” 
Man’s untiring endeavor, his constant effort through the centuries to find 
something better suited to his needs, had in a figurative sense succeeded in turning 
stones into paper, It remained for two apprentices of Rittenhouse, who erected a 
third paper mill in Pennsylvania in 1728, to advance the claim that this could be 
done literally, that stone, the primitive material on which had been carved the 
first written characters of the race could be converted into a paper resembling 
asses’ skins. We have no means of knowing what the so-called stone was, nor what 
process was followed, but it is safe to assume that both material and methods were 
similar to those employed at the present time in the manufacture of asbestos paper. 
There are now about 1100 mills in the United States, with an annual output of 
about 4,000,000 tons. New York State produces the most, then comes Maine, Wis- 
consin, and Massachusetts. 
Paper ranks fourth among the staple commodities. Foodstuffs first; clothing 
-second; and iron and steel third. 
III. Manufacture: : 
For over 100 years no material but wood was used to make paper, but now it 
is also made from cotton and linen rags, straw, hemp, esparto grass, and old paper. 
For many years the work was all done by hand, but about 1800 a paper mak- 
ing machine was invented in France by Louis Robert. Shortly afterward Henry 
Fourdrinier invented a machine, which with a few modifications is the one used in 
all paper making factories today. 
The first process in paper-making is to reduce the material to a pulp. With 
wood this is done either by boiling it in chemicals or by grinding it on great mill- 
stones. The rags for paper must first be thoroughly cleansed and bleached; they 
then go into a large boiler called “the beater,’’ where they are threshed and beaten 
toa pulp. The pulp is spread in thin layers on a fine wire cloth which is kept in 
constant motion to drain off the water and web the pulp together; this web is then 
passed between heavy rollers and dried. 
This forms print paper , and wrapping paper, but for writing paper, the sheets 
must be dipped in a “size” made of animal glue or gelatine, which fills up all pores 
and gives a smooth surface; again it must be pressed and rolled. 
To produce the various colored papers, aniline or vegetable dyes are mixed 
with the pulp. 
The water-mark on paper is made by having the desired mark woven on a wire 
cylinder which is rolled over the web of pulp while it is on the wire cloth. This 
makes an impression which can always be seen by holding the paper to the light. 
United States ranks first in paper-making, producing about one-third of the 
world’s supply. 
Some important mills are at Holyoke and Dalton, Mass.; Lockport and Chica- 
go, Ill.; Hamilton, Ohio; and in all the New England States. 
Some kinds of paper are: writing, drawing, printing, wrapping, blotting, felt, 
tissue, carbon, photographic, filter, paraffin, etc. 
Uses of paper:, 
Bags, boxes, collars, cuffs, tubs, buckets, car-wheels, lead pencils, matting and 
rugs, dishes, drinking cups, boats, barrels, towels, napkins, etc. 
Related knowledge: 
Rolls for newspaper contain from 15 to 25 thousand feet or from 3 to 5 miles. 
One-fourth of the output of paper is for newspapers. 
In 1776 there were 37 publications, newspapers, and periodicals in the United 
States; in 1900 there were 20,806. : i i i 
Only 2% of the drain of forests goes to paper-making, railroad ties and mine 
supports consume much more. 
Wood pulp is measured and sold by the cord. 
The chief woods used are Scotch fir, spruce, poplar, aspen, hemlock. 
Linen and cotton rags make much finer grade paper than wood.
-P-A-G-E-678
  668 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
At Dalton, Mass., the United States government has mills in which the paper 
for paper money is made. Here they use only new linen rags. 
There is a tariff of about 10% on all paper pulp and finished paper that comes 
into the country. i 
When the recent reciprocity bill was passed by Congress it permitted all wood 
for pulp cut from private lands in Canada, and print paper made from such pulp 
to be admitted free, but wood cut from government lands is still subject to duty. 
Paper contributes more largely than any other material to the general progress 
of the country, for it is through it that new discoveries, theories, and inventions 
are proclaimed.

INFORMATION ON THE EVOLUTION OF WEAVING 
I History: ‘ 
The study of textile development is the study of race development. At first 
man and woman did the same work but with the discovery of fire came a division
-P-A-G-E-679
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS—FIFTH GRADE 669 
of labor. The woman stayed by the fire to keep it burning and there developed 
the home industries while the man worked in the field or hunted in the forest. 
An old Christian sarcophagus tells the story of God’s condemning the world 
to labor by representing an ear of corn being given to Adam to signify that men 
should be tillers of the soil, and a sheep being given to Eve to signify that women 
should be weavers. é 
Ornamentation of the body with shells, feathers, paint, etc., preceded clothing, 
but as the race advanced in civilization the necessity for shelter and clothing led 
to their invention. _ 
The idea of weaving was gotten from birds, spiders, and caterpillars and was 
first adapted to the interweaving of branches to cover the floors of damp caves, 
1. Basketry: 
Belongs to the Stone Age. 
All savages have some form of basketry. 
Simplest form—plaiting of strips of bark, bamboo, grasses. 
Finest baskets made in Corea and Siam. 
Sacs and Fox Indians used strips of slippery elm and white ash bark, split 
with nails and crossed with cords. 
Basketry and matting are more beautiful among uncivilized people than 
among civilized people. t 
Indians wove thoughts, hopes, prayers, into their baskets. 
Their patterns have never been surpassed and are still used in much of the 
present day weaving. 
Hats developed from baskets. 
2. Pottery: 
Original meaning is coiled cooking basket. 
The first form was in baskets lined and covered with clay to preserve them 
in cooking. 
Then the clay was shaped without the basket. 
The oldest pots were coiled because baskets were coiled. 
Coiled pottery is still made by students of art but all of our most useful 
vessels are either made on the potter’s wheel or are cast in molds. 
3. Clothing: 
First, skins of animals, feathers, and paint. _ 
Second, bast cloth—made by pounding the inner bark of trees into a flat 
sheet. This bast cloth was used in Mexico, Central America and South America. 
The Hawaians excelled all other people in the making of bast cloth. 
Felt is still beaten out and not woven. 
The weaving of grasses, hemp, and hair for baskets suggested the weaving 
of material for clothing. 
The Textile Art proper is the use of yarn, thread, or braid or it is the art 
by which threads are crossed and interlaced to form a compact material. 
The Apaches were the most beautiful weavers. They are sometimes called 
the Navajo spiders. 
4. Looms: 
a. Hand looms. : 
Ga (1) Simplest form in shape of letter “D,” used by savages of British 
uiana. 
(2) Rectangular loom of Indians, usually held in a vertical position and 
the weaver stood while working with a bone knife for separating the warp 
threads and a bone or a wooden needle. 
(3) Loom with heddle for lifting warp threads. 
(4) Loom with batten or bar for pushing the woof threads into place. 
(5) Loom with cloth beam for making a continuous cloth. 
b. Foot_looms: ‘i 
(1) Similar to the hand looms with heddle, batten, warp beam and cloth 
beam, but both heddle and batten are worked by a treadle. 
(2) Much used in early colonial times., Still used by the Japanese and 
the people of the East Indies. : 
c. Power looms: f 
Used now in all factories and mills.
-P-A-G-E-680
  670 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
All motion controlled by water, steam, or electricity. 
The first power loom was invefited by Dr. Edward Cartwright, a clergy- 
man from the south of England (1784). By 1800 his power loom came into 
general use and Parliament, in 1809 voted him a gift of £10,000 for the bene- 
fit his invention had rendered to manufacturing. 
The Jacquard loom invented in 1702 by a Frenchman of that name is 
the most perfect loom for weaving intricate patterns, but it is very expensive 
and wears out easily. . 
For the story of the “Coming of the Factory to America,” see the Fifth 
Grade Course in History, p. 522, 
5. Fibers used in weaving: 
a. Vegetable: 
Fruit fibers—cocoanut and cotton. 
Stem fibers—flax, hemp, cedar. 
Leaf fibers—pineapple, plantain, palm. 
Grasses and bark. 
Egyptian rushes. 
Rafha. 
Lowest forms of vegetation (especially lichens and mosses) are not 
fibrous but are useful for dyes. 
b. Animal: 
Sinews of reindeer. 
Hair of llama, camel, goat, and horses. 
Wool of sheep. 
Silk of silk worms and of certain spiders in Java and New Guinea. 
c. Mineral: 
Silver. 
6. Dyeing: 
Began in countries rich in flora. 
Dyes made from bark, sap, roots, leaves and fruit of various plants. 
Indians generally used bark for dyeing, frequently traveling miles to secure 
the needed bark. se 
The ancient Phoenicians were noted for the gorgeous purple dye they used. 
The Hawaiians made figured goods by applying different colors with bamboo 
pens or brushes or stamps cut on bamboo strips. In’ somie islands these stamps 
were made several feet square. 
Vegetable fibers do not take dye as readily as animal fibers. 
Silk dyes more easily than wool. 
Cotton requires a mordant to hold the colors. 
Vegetable dyes were formerly used exclusively but for the last twenty years 
nearly all our dyes are made from coal tar, from which over fourteen thousand 
colors have been produced. — 
7. Social aspects of weaving industry: 
a. Respect for primitive people. 
b. Appreciation of their struggles. 
c. Their heritage to us. 
d. Sympathy with toilers. 
e. Sweat-shop system. 
f. Consumers’ League.

HOUSEHOLD ARTS 
I. Aims: 
1. To cultivate an appreciation of the home, and prepare the 
girls to be more efficient home-makers. 
2. To form right habits: attention, neatness, order. 
3. To teach relation of food and clothing to good health. 
4. To develop reasoning, originality, discrimination and invention. 
5. To train in economy of time and material. 
6. To awaken an interest in social problems; as sweat-shop 
labor and factory conditions, for example. 
7. To train in business methods. 
8. To inculcate, through class work, unselfishness, courtesy and 
and pleasing manners to others. 
9. To develop the sense of beauty and fitness. 
The course in the elementary school gives a survey of the whole 
field of Household Arts, presented in the form to suit the previous 
training and ability of the pupils. Considerable general informa- 
tion has been given the pupils in the previous grades through the 
industrial arts course. Food, clothing and shelter are important 
topics even in the primary grades. This furnishes a basis for the 
specific work of the special courses which begin in the sixth grade 
and are taught by special teachers of Household Arts. The lessons 
have been planned to form a definite sequence, both for the grade 
and the whole course, continuing through the four years of the high 
school. 
Since the understanding of the underlying principles in working 
processes makes knowledge transferable and therefore most valuable, 
practice and theory are combined in every lesson. The degree of 
emphasis, however, varies with the previous training of the pupils. 
In the sixth grade special attention is paid to the technical processes 
with the theory necessary for a knowledge of materials and an under- 
standing of the working principles involved. Each succeeding year 
increased emphasis is placed on the scientific side of the work in pro- 
portion as the establishment of correct habits renders the pupil more 
skillful, and through the practical work, automatic control is secured. 
Frequent reviews are necessary. Important lessons are repeated 
each year, variation being given. in the practical application 
of the principles involved. 
The pupils should become familiar with the technical terms 
which occur in the study of foods and textiles, and the simple tests 
for their identification. The formation of correct habits is very 
(672)  
-P-A-G-E-683
    HOUSEHOLD ARTS 673 
important in elementary work. Therefore emphasis should be 
placed on neatness, accuracy, quickness, independence. A few 
minutes spent in review or an occasional contest are valuable factors 
in securing this result. 
The students should know what they are going to do before 
starting. Outlining the steps of the work in proper sequence before 
starting is a good practice for beginners. 
Special seasons of the year—Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter— 
should be emphasized and appropriate lessons planned. 
Home work may be encouraged and the interest of the home 
may be increased by allowing certain credits for duties performed 
under home supervision. This is one of the new and unsettled 
problems and requires carefully planned and supervised procedure, 
but may prove a valuable means of securing the co-operation of 
the home and school. 
II. Class spirit—discipline: 
» the Household Arts class furnishes large opportunities for life 
experiences. The home atmosphere should be cultivated. Un- 
selfishness, courtesy, self-control are essential to the success of the 
home spirit. Orderliness is necessary for satisfactory work. Lib- 
erty, not leisure, freedom and ease, not disorder, is the goal. Re- 
sponsibility placed upon pupils is valuable training in independence. 
III. Note-books: 
The student’s note-book contains the record of the lessons, and 
other information needed for later reference. 
The book should be kept neat and up to date. Frequent ex- 
aminations and marking of books help in securing satisfactory 
results. 
IV. Illustrative material: 
Valuable illustrative material can be found in magazines, daily 
papers, advertisements and dealers’ catalogues, which, collected by 
pupils and placed on the bulletin board, will add to the interest of 
the lessons. This selection of proper material is valuable training 
in discrimination and judgment. 
Many firms and manufacturing concerns will send materials 
as advertisement, if requested. Pictures, photographs, post-cards 
are helpful aids to the teacher. 
Interesting charts can be made by the class, showing source, 
production, manufacture of various products. The blackboard 
should be used for sketching and explaining or outlining important 
points in the lesson. 
The Government Bulletins are valuable reference material.

  674 COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
V. Special lessons: 
The month of December should be set apart for Christmas 
work. The Christmas spirit—the spirit of giving should be em- 
phasized. The preliminary lesson decides the success of the month’s 
work. Magazines, former gifts, and other available materials 
brought to the class by teacher and pupils, afford a basis for dis- 
cussion and selection of suitable gifts, and arouse enthusiasm. Final 
decisions should be made at this time. Appropriate gifts to parents 
should be a conspicuous part of the plan. Simple gifts to hospitals, 
shut-ins, or the less fortunate should form a part of the Christmas 
work, where possible. All gifts should be simple and inexpensive, 
the ethical value being emphasized. Fancy, over-decorated work 
should be discouraged. 
To be most valuable the Household Arts courses must be 
closely related to the other interests of the pupda-ehe grade work, 
the home, and the community. 
VI. Correlation with grade work: 
There must be real correlation of sympathy and interest, and 
a general knowledge of both phases of work by the special and grade 
teachers if successful correlation of subject-matter be attained. 
There are many opportunities for mutual helpfulness: 
A. Conferences with principals and teachers. 
B. Visiting class work. 
The grade teacher is a welcome visitor to the home economics 
lessons of her class. 
It is equally valuable for the teacher of Household Arts to 
visit the grade room and see the class under normal conditions. 
C. Subject-matter: 
Any weakness shown by the class in any of the fundamentals 
should be reported to the grade teacher. 
English: ; 
Composition on special topics relating to home economics, 
the special teacher marking for subject-matter, the grade teacher 
for English. 
Arithmetic: 
Calculating costs of lessons, menus, and clothing budgets. 
Study of comparative costs and availability of materials 
used. ° 
Geography: 
Location of products.

In the same way correlation can be made with history, physi- 
ology, art, and other school subjects. . 
“Correlation with the home: 
A. Discussion and comparison of home and school recipes and 
methods. 
B. Collecting and filing favorite home recipes. 
C. Afternoon teas prepared and served by various classes to 
their mothers. 
D. A note or occasional visit to the home of an absent or sick 
child. 
E. Home work in practical affairs—cooking and sewing, in which 
parents will be interested and willing to co-operate. 
Correlation with community: 
A. Planning a tea or furnishing refreshments for a meeting of 
the Patrons’ Club. 
B. Inviting trustees and others interested in school affairs to 
one of the meals prepared by a class. 
C. Talking to the neighborhood clubs on topics relating to 
Household Arts. 
D. Arranging an exhibit of class work and inviting patrons and 
friends of the school. 
E. Inviting parents of contesting classes to a contest in cooking 
and sewing.

that require long or intricate cooking should be avoided in elementary 
classes. Special emphasis should be placed on the method of work 
and results obtained. It’ is important to show reasons for failure 
in the finished product. Satisfaction with poor results is dangerous 
to cultivation of proper ideals; therefore comparison and criticism 
of the finished product are necessary and important, and should 
  form a prominent part of each lesson.

CLOTHING AND TEXTILES 
The course extends from the sixth grade elementary through the 
fourth year high school; but much foundation work is done in all the 
earlier elementary grades. Food, clothing, and shelter are import- 
ant topics even in the primary grades. 
The sixth grade is taught by the class teacher; the succeeding 
grades by the special teacher of Household Arts. 
The aim has been to present the subject through a logical and sys- 
tematic arrangement of lessons. The first lesson on weaving reviews 
previous work and leads to darning. The study of textiles begins in 
the first lesson with the study of warp and woof of material. 
The next topic is clothing which furnishes the motive for the study 
of commercial patterns, the principles involved in proper selection 
of material, knowledge and use of sewing stitches, and important 
lessons on the relations of clothing to health. It is intended to be 
educational as well as technical and if either is sacrificed the value 
is correspondingly weakened. This subject is especially adaptable 
to close correlation of school with the home and community. While 
the course should give technical skill in the practical processes in- 
volved, it should also stimulate thought, train in judgment and in- 
it ative, and arouse an interest in economic problems. 
*In the sixth grade the pupils are given the problems of making 
a complete set of underwear and a dress for a twenty-six inch doll. 
Commercial patterns are used and the method of procedure is iden- 
tical with the selection and making of an outfit for the pupils’ own 
use. 
The reasons for using the doll as the basis of the work is as follows: 
1. Of nterest to girls—it relates directly to life. 
2. Interest is maintained because more rapid changes ofwork 
are possible. 
3. Economy in time and material.

4. As any model, it affords a means of working out principles 
and seeing results more quickly than in large size. 
5. To teach care of child: 
a Bathing. 
b. Hair—protect hair with cap. 
c. Eyes—danger of allowing too strong light. 
d. Proper clothing. 
Making clothes for doll. 
1. To develop the mother instinct. 
2. To teach care of children. 
3. To cultivate interest in others. 
Special aims: 
1. To teach correct methods of sewing with a direct application 
to making the girl’s clothing, using the smaller clothes as a means. 
Dolls’ patterns are made on the same plan as the larger ones. 
2. The selection of material should be made to meet stated con- 
ditions, as age and use. 
Use made of doll: 
Some classes donate dressed dolls to some unfortunate children 
or use them at school fairs, or keep the clothes for themselves which 
is their privilege. In any case the school doll must be kept at school. 
*Note: The dressing of the doll is not compulsory for all classes. 
It has been found that some ‘sixth grade girls have outgrown their 
interest in dolls. The course should be made flexible enough to 
allow as a substitute a more real project like the making of garments 
for themselves or for Red Cross purposes. 
3. All material for the doll’s clothes are furnished by the school. 
Important lessons—darning, patching, buttonholes, should be 
practiced until satisfactorily done. This can be done by having 
material prepared, on hand, and ready for use during periods when 
the students are compelled to wait for the teacher. A record of the 
required pieces of work should be kept, each piece checked off as 
completed. Whatever the plan adopted, it should arouse the in- 
terest and spirit of competition.

SEVENTH GRADE 
The course in clothing and textiles of the seventh grade is a repeti- 
tion of the fundamental principles and processes learned in the sixth 
grade, the practical application being the student’s clothing. There 
should be frequent reviews of difficult technical processes. New 
problems should be tried out on practice pieces before they are 
applied. 
Sewing machine work is introduced either by use of school or 
home machines. 
Where there is no machine in the school, allow the pupils to baste 
long seams at school, and sew them on the machine at home. The 
amount of home work should be limited, and carefully planned and 
supervised, otherwise careless work will result.

MANUAL TRAINING 
Manual Training in the upper grades beginning with the sixth, 
assumes a specialized form, and emphasis is laid upon technical skill, 
as well as the subject matter taught. While the projects made are 
those connected with the various interests of the boy’s life, in most 
cases, we aim to lead along the line of our great industries. Talks 
are given to the pupils in the history and workings of our great 
American industries, so that they will have a view of centres other 
than those connected with their home and immediate environment. 
Opportunities are given the boys for the expression of their own 
ideas, and to this end directions are given in response to questions, 
rather than from mere dictation. 
The individual is encouraged to observe for himself and after the 
fundamental processes incident to the successful completion of any 
constructive work have been mastered, a freer scope is given for 
original work properly directed by the instructor. 
Manual Training is brought into as close relation with other school 
subjects as is possible. 
Emphasis is laid upon increasing accuracy in the use of tools and 
materials; upon the proper technique of the simpler drawings, and 
upon neatness, accuracy, good construction, proper: design, and 
finish. 
It is planned to have every project take some useful form. The 
different projects undertaken by the same grades throughout the 
county do not necessarily involve the same technique, but are de- 
signed to meet local community or environment needs. 
The projects undertaken may be classified as follows: 
(1) Process projects, designed to teach = construction, 
tool processes, and technique. 
(2) Science projects designed to prove some law in physics, 
mechanics, or to better facilitate the teaching of some great Ameri- 
can industry. 
(3) Community projects, designed for some specific purpose, or 
suggested by the pupil, for use in the classroom, the shop, the school, 
or the home. 
The instructor makes a study of every project planned in order to 
develop ability on the part of the pupil along the following lines: 
(a) The making and reading of the mechanical drawing. 
(b) The best mechanical construction.

The course of study in the sixth grade has been planned to utilize 
and extend the knowledge and experience gained in the fifth grade 
course in Industrial Arts. 
SIXTH GRADE 
Time, 40 hours. 
I. Cardboard: 
Evolution of geometrical solids with their applications. Use 
measurements to sixteenths, binding with laps. 
Teach proper use of drawing board, T-square, triangles, scale, 
compasses, cutting to lines, scoring for pasting, the proper use of 
glue, and method of pasting. Horizontal and vertical lines; the 
parts of a circle, and the geometric forms involved should be em- 
phasized. 
Models used: Cube, square prism, square pyramid, triangular 
prism, triangular pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, pentagonal pyra- 
mid, octagonal pyramid, rhombic prism, octohedron, octagonal 
prism, flight of steps, crystal forms, cylinder and Greek cross. 
Teach modifications of type-forms and applications of the same 
in mats, boxes, trays, whiskbroom holders, bill holders, and angle 
protractors. 
One of the most essential features of cardboard construction, 
other than cultivating the sense of form, the knowledge of distance, 
space and volume, the habits of neatness, accuracy, and concentrated 
application, is the correlation of this work with Mechanical Drawing. 
We have found through experience that a good, strong course in 
cardboard construction is a most valuable adjunct to the pupil, when 
he takes up the subject of Mechanical Drawing. 
IT. Projects: ; 
Key tag, plant label, calendar back, thermometer back, brack- 
et shelf, sundial, match-scratch, sailboat, windmill, scissors rack,

STAINS AND FINISHES 
a. Stains. 
Why should we finish wood? 
To produce color, and to give an 
added beauty. 
To preserve wood. 
The preparation of the wood may be 
divided into the folowing steps: 
Plane. 
Scrape. 
Sandpaper. 
Dust. 
Wet down with water. 
Let dry. 
Sandpaper. 
Dust. 
The different stains may be divided 
into four classes, viz: 
Oil stains. 
Aniline oil stains. 
Water stains. 
Made from anilines. 
Made from dyes other than anilines. 
Spirit stains. 
Stains due to chemical changes. 
b. Oil stains 
Advantages. 
Easy to prepare. 
Easy to apply evenly. 
Do not raise grain. 
Disadvantages. 
Tendency to hide grain.
-P-A-G-E-703
MANUAL TRAINING—SEVENTH GRADE 
Give a muddy effect. 
Do not penetrate wood very deeply. 
Impossible to stain hard-wood with 
them and at the same time keep 
the grain and the texture of the 
wood clear. 
Oil stains in general are made: 
Of pigments ground in oil—thinned 
turpentine. 
The pigments most commonly used 
are: Burnt and Raw Umber, Burnt 
and Raw Sienna, Vandyke Brown, 
Drop Black and Medium Chrome 
Yellow. 
Applied with brush and rubbed clean 
with cotton waste. 
The colors may be varied by mixing. 
Examples: 
Two parts drop black. 
One part medium chrome 
Cream yellow. 
Dissolve in turpentine. 
Burnt umber. 
Antique oak Black. 
Raw sienna. 
i Venetian red. 
Walnut stain { Asphaltum. 
c. Aniline oil stains 
Colors clear and easily obtainable but 
crude and too bright. 
Made by mixing colors soluble in oil, 
with turpentine and boiled oil. 
Colors most commonly used are: Bis- 
mark brown, dark yellow, dark blue 
and black. 
These are dissolved in three ounces of 
turpentine, one ounce of boiled oil 
and one teaspoon of color. 
. Applied with brush and rubbed clean - 
with cotton waste. 
d. Water stains 
Advantages. 
Cheap and clear. 
Do not obscure the grain as oil stains 
are likely to do. 
Penetrate deeply 
It is possible to secure a darker color 
than with oil stains. 
Brushes are easily taken care of. 693 
Disadvantages. 
Hard to make and raise the’ grain 
of the wood. 
The difficulty of raising the grain may 
be overcome by washing the wood 
before staining and then sandpaper- 
ing or by staining first, and then 
sandpaper and stain again if neces- 
sary. 
Water stains are made from anilines. 
As Bismark brown dissolved in water. 
And from dyes other than anilines. 
As logwood dissolved in water. 
e. Spirit stains 
Advantages. 
Easily prepared and applied. 
Disadvantages. 
Expensive. 
Colors not permanent. 
The application is the same as for 
oil stains. 
Made by dissolving in alcohol or 
naptha and any kind of dye. 
Examples: 
Black—Aniline black cut in alcohol, 
gives bluish effect, but if the wood 
thus stained is rubbed with boiled 
oil, it becomes black. 
Golden oak—Dissolve asphaltum in 
naphtha, or equal parts of as- 
phaltum and gold size japan, add 
turpentine and thin to proper 
consistency. 
Mahogany—Dissolve Bismarck brown 
in alcohol. 
f. Stains due to chemical changes 
Substances like ammonia, potassium 
bichromate and acetate of iron give 
chemical reaction on certain. woods. 
Ammonia; process known as fuming; 
expose wood for day or more to strong 
fumes of 28 per cent ammonia, in an 
air-tight box. 
Bichromate of potash dissolved in 
water gives a reddish brown. 
Sulphuric acid (best on cypress), gives 
a purple color. 
In general we may say that oil stains 
are better for soft wood, water stains

FINISHING 
STAINS AND FINISHES 
a, Fillers: 
Object of filling: 
To give a level and non-absorbent 
basis for varnish or other finish. 
Fillers are made: 
Of silex in needle-shaped particles 
mixed with raw linseed oil, japan 
and turpentine. 
Application: 
With brush along the grain of 
wood. As it dries it becomes a 
grayish color and then it is 
rubbed off across the grain. and 697 
It should be applied after staining 
wood, and allowed to stand at 
least forty-eight hours before 
varnish is applied. 
Use: 
More necessary on open grain 
woods such as chestnut, oak and 
mahogany than on close grained 
woods such as white wood, maple 
and pine. 
Fillers are of different colors for 
the different kinds of work and 
wood. 
For example: 
Oil darkens wood, and if wood is 
to be kept light a filler without 
oil, as whiting and turpentine 
should be used. 
For golden oak, use golden oak 
filler and for mahogany use 
mahogany filler. 
Finishes or polishes: 
The polishes may be divided into 
three different classes: 
Oil. 
Wax. 
b. Varnishes: 
Spirit varnishes. 
Oil varnishes. 
c. Oil: 
Advantages: 
Its permanency. 
It stands both wetting and warmth. 
It gives a dull, glossy finish. 
It brings up figure. 
Process of application: 
Apply either raw or boiled linseed 
oil diluted with five parts of 
benzine or turpentine. 
The advantages of dilution are 
that it gives a better penetrat- 
ing mixture and leaves a thinner 
film on the wood. 
Rub considerably day after day, 
little and often, with unlimited 
friction. 
d. Wax: 
Used before the French polish and 
varnish were introduced. ‘ 
Advantages. 
Cheap. 
 
-P-A-G-E-708
  698 
Easily prepared. 
Easily applied. 
Disadvantages: 
Will not stand wetting. 
Easily marred. 
Requires constant care. 
Becomes slightly sticky with 
warmth. 
Likely to turn white in crevices, 
Preparation: 
One part of melted beeswax and 
one part turpentine. 
Process of application: 
Rub wax evenly over surface, with 
stiff brush or fingers, let dry for 
several hours, then rub with 
piece of cloth or felt. Apply 
several coats, leaving over night. 
then rubbing with a warm cloth. 
e. Varnishes: 
Function: 
To cover wood with a hard trans- 
parent covering that is non-por- 
ous and impervious to moisture. 
Classes of varnishes: 
Spirit varnishes. 
Oil varnishes. 
f. Spirit varnishes: 
Are made from resinous gums cut in 
Time, 50 hours. 
  COURSE OF STUDY, BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS 
alcohol, benzine, acetone, etc. 
Dry with great rapidity, leaving a 
hard coat of the resin. 
Shellac: : 
Most common and most useful of 
spirit varnishes. Basis is a com- 
pound resinous substance exuded 
from an East Indian scale insect 
(carteria lacca) found mostly in 
Assam, 
French polishing: 
Finest of shellac finishes. 
Process of: 
g. Oil or copal varnishes. 
Are made principally of linseed oil 
and turpentine with copal as the 
base. (Copal, a fossil resinous sub- 
stance of vegetable origin.) 
h. Process of varnishing: 
Surface of wood perfectly even and 
smooth. 
Staining, 
pleted. 
Apply with brush until the varnish 
has flowed over the work evenly. 
Set in dry dustless place. 
When dry, repeat the process from 
three to six times. filling and drying com- 
MECHANICAL DRAWING 
The working out of plans for the projects made and the making 
of drawings illustrating the relation of views and cross-sectioning. 
The mathematics of this grade should include the estimating of 
the amount of lumber in logs of given sizes and computing the cost 
of individual models.

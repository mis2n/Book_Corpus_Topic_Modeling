Foreword 
HE fundamental theory of the teaching of Music in the Primary Grades is that 
l Music is for all children and should be within the teaching ability of every teacher. 
Interest and spontaneity on the part of both teacher and pupils are the absolute 
essentials of successful primary singing. Obviously these qualities are within the reach 
of every teacher. It should be as natural for a child to sing as it is for him to laugh. 
His joy of living, his sense of companionship find natural utterance in simple songs. 
The song, therefore, should be the basis for instruction from the first lesson in the 
kindergarten to the last lesson given to the normal school graduate just entering upon 
her duties as a teacher. By teaching pupils of any grade a number of beautiful songs, 
a center of interest in Music is established upon which may be developed the more 
formal side of music instruction. When love for the song is firmly rooted in the child’s 
heart and his interest is keen, is the time to begin the more formal interpretation of the 
rudiments of Music. 
The ‘Bentley Song Series” covers the work of the Primary Grades, One to Four 
inclusive. The ‘Song Primer’? is a Teacher’s Handbook. It is to be used by the 
teacher in the First Grade to teach the songs by rote to the children. In the Second 
Grade, with Book II of the series in the hands of the children, the teacher will find in the 
“Song Primer’’ specific teaching plans for each song, with many piano accompaniments 
charmingly arranged. In the Second Grade the child thus learns to read by sight the 
songs he learned to sing by rote in the First Grade. The ‘‘Song Primer” also furnishes 
a plan of presentation for the work in the Third and Fourth Grades, and should be in 
the hands of every teacher conducting the Music work. 
The “‘Bentley Song Series”’ is a collection of songs inspired by many years observance 
of what children need and love to express, and they are written entirely from the point 
of view of the child. Every song in each book has been tested in lower grade classes; 
its value as a rote or study song has been established by actual experiment. These, 
then, are not the songs which children may or ought to love to sing, but they are the 
songs which children delight in, and from the singing of which they get the largest 
spontaneous participation of body, mind and spirit. 
It is from such an early musical experience that they will develop a liking for music, 
an appreciation of music, and an ability to take part in group singing. Interest, Apprecia- 
tion, Participation—these are the qualities which the “Bentley Song Series’ develops 
in the primary music course and which will carry over into the life of the child.

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF 
FLOWERS, TREES, FRUITS, 
AND PLANTS 
  
PLANT LORE 
Wuen the legends and fables of simpler times pertain 
to trees and flowers, they are especially luminative of the 
mental processes of unschooled men; for the vegetable world 
has changed little in three thousand years, and the marks 
and colors that explain some beliefs are still impressed on 
the leaves and petals. The symbolism adopted therefrom 
is wide in meaning, and to this day is in common use. It 
is poetic, hence it appeals to every intelligence; for while 
we affect to prize poetry for its beauty, to the savage 
it was native speech, inasmuch as his vocabulary was alle- 
goric—a humanization of the skies, the sunsets, the storms, 
the flowers. We sometimes hear that ours is a material, 
dull age, yet we perpetuate terms and usances which ally 
us to the childhood of the race, and which stand for imagina- 
tion and sheer loveliness. We still speak of laureled brows, 
palms of victory, the rose of beauty, the lily of purity, the 
oak of strength, willowy grace, fig-trees of shelter, and corn 
of abundance; we extend the olive branch of peace, we put 
our legs under our host’s mahogany, we indicate poison by 
nightshade and toadstools, and health by flowers and fruits. 
Though Bacchus is no longer with us, we emblemize him

in our reference to the vine. Moreover, states and nations 
choose their flowers, and certain Scottish Highlanders still 
wear them as badges of their clans. The liking for these 
things, their service to the eye, antedates history, and 
although Shakespeare lived when there was no botany, and 
only an enjoyment of nature in place of the study of it, 
his chance mention of one hundred and fifty trees and 
plants hints at the regard such matters enjoyed in those 
days. 
The very religions of all lands have fruits and trees in 
their cosmogonies, and plant-lore opens a quaint human 
document in its disclosure of that self-complacency which 
assumed the earth to be a strictly human property, in which 
all was for the service of man, and nothing existed of its 
own right. Out of this notion came the doctrine of signa- 
tures—‘‘a system for discovering the medicinal uses of a 
plant from something in its external appearance that re- 
sembled the disease it would cure.’? For instance, the 
leaves of aspen shook, hence it must be good for shaking 
palsy; gromwell had a stony seed, so it was prescribed 
for gravel; saxifrage grew in cracks in the rocks, therefore 
it would crack the deposits known as stone in the bladder; 
knots of scrophularia were prescribed for scrofulous swell- 
ings, the pappus of scabiosa for leprosy, the spotted leaves 
of pulmonaria for consumption (notice how these beliefs 
and uses have named certain species), nettle tea was for 
nettle rash, blood-root for dysentery, turmeric for jaundice, 
because it was the color of a jaundiced skin; wood sorrel, 
having a heart-shaped leaf, was a cordial, or heart restora- 
tive; liverwort corrected an inactive liver; dracontium, or 
herb dragon, was a cure for snake poison; briony cured 
dropsy, because its root suggested a swollen foot. 
The estimate of plants is denoted not merely in their 
common use as food and ornament, but in the adoption of 
10
-P-A-G-E-13
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    their names by people, civilized and other. Until the god- 
dess Carna was invented, Italy’s soil produced no vegetables 
without men’s help, excepting spelt and beans; hence in 
her particular feasts the usual offering was beans. In the 
Roman courts or in public bodies where questions were put 
to vote, the ancient ballot was a bean, a white one repre- 
senting innocence; a black one, guilt. Such, then, was the 
importance of the bean that we need feel no surprise that 
one of the foremost families in Rome, the Fabians, to wit, 
should have taken the name of it. The Ccepiones of that 
day were merely the Messrs. Onion; the Pisones were the 
Peas; Cicero was Mr. Chick-pea; the Lentucini were the 
Lettuce family. To this day we have in like wise, among 
our friends, the Pease, Beans, Pears, Cherrys, Berrys, 
Olives, Coffeys, Nutts, Chestnuts, Oakes, Pines, Birches, 
Roses, Lillies, and Asters, while our Indians, excelling us 
in variety and fitness of names, give such to their daughters 
as Wild Rose, Budding Poppy, and Bending Lily. And 
as it was honorable to employ the name of a plant, a tree, 
a flower, in naming a dignified family of a dignified race, 
it came about easily that such plant or tree or flower was 
in place about the homes, the tombs and temples, of that 
family, and that in time it was borne upon the family 
coat-of-arms. 
Names do not always mark resemblances, for they are 
sometimes freaks of accident or have gone astray through 
wrong spellings. For instance, our ‘‘butter and eggs’’ was 
originally bubonium, because it cured buboes—then; but 
a slip in a letter made it bufonium, and as bufo is toad, 
we have the name of toad-flax, which means nothing. In 
like manner, Jerusalem artichoke was twisted into girasole 
artichoke; tansy is alleged to be a corruption of athanasia, 
or immortality, though what the two have in common no 
man can guess; while borage is a mispronunciation of

courage, for that (cor-ago: I bring heart) was supposed to 
be heightened by drinking decoctions of the herb. 
‘When the doctrine of signatures began to transcend the 
visible signs written on the flower or leaf, it widened the 
possibilities of medical practice wonderfully. Thus, the holy 
or blessed thistle (carduus benedictus), at first a cure for 
itch, became by force of its blessed state a sovereign remedy 
for sores, vertigo, jaundice, bad blood, red face, red nose, tet- 
ter, ring-worm, plague, boils, mad-dog bite, snake poison, deaf- 
ness, defective memory, and other ailments. Another va- 
riety of the plant, the ‘‘melancholy thistle,’’ was a cure for 
the blues if taken in wine. But the thistle was not the 
only blessed plant, by any means. One species after an- 
other developed saintly associations, and by virtue of them 
became a cure for more than its ‘‘signature’’ would indi- 
eate. All flowers that bear the name of lady were dedi- 
eated to Our Lady the Virgin. Such are the lady’s slipper, 
lady’s hand, lady’s tresses, lady’s smock, lady’s mantle, 
lady’s bedstraw, lady’s bower, lady’s comb, lady’s cushion, 
lady’s finger, lady’s garters, lady’s hair, lady’s laces, lady’s 
looking-glass, lady’s seal, lady’s thimble, and lady’s thumb. 
Beneficent influences exerted by plants thus fortunately 
named or associated were instanced in a wider crop of super- 
stitions than had grown from the mystic or significant mark- 
ings, but the sanctifying of plants through their association 
with saints and angels was no new thing in Christian times. 
The heathen gods had their floral favorites, and the first 
garland was culled from the trees of heaven by the Indian 
Venus, Cri, who put it on the head of Indra’s elephant. 
The animal, intoxicated with the perfume, flung the wreath 
to the ground, thereby so angering Siva that he cursed 
Indra for permitting the sacrilege and threw him to the 
earth also, thus condemning him to lose his vigor, and all 
the plants on earth to lose eternal life. The Greeks and 
12

Romans planted sacred flowers in their gardens, those espe- 
cially loved by the Greeks including the rose, lily, violet, 
anemone, thyme, melilot, crocus, chamomile, smilax, hya- 
cinth, narcissus, chrysanthemum, laurel, myrtle, and mint. 
Laurel, narcissus, hyacinth, myrtle, cypress, and pine were 
nymphs or youths transformed from human shape; the 
mint was a woman whom Pluto loved; the mulberry was 
stained with the blood of lovers; it was Lycurgus’s tears 
that begot the cabbage. The plane sprang from Diomede’s 
tomb. The rose-tinted lotus arose from the blood of a lion 
slain by Hadrian. The vine sprang, by miracle, near 
Olympia, and sports and ceremonies incident to its festivals 
in early Hellas are perpetuated as faint memories in the 
use of the eucharist and loving-cup. 
It took some of the early investigators a long time to 
overcome their repugnance to making practical use of plants 
associated with lengendary harm and violence; indeed, 
accurate observation of the remedial effects of plant juices 
and decoctions is a matter of recent days, although we find 
tokens of therapeutic study in other centuries. The rose- 
mary had no ‘‘signature,’’ but we discover reason in its 
use, whether the effects agreed with the allegement or not, 
in that it was prescribed for carrying by mourners and 
attendants at funerals two hundred years ago, the odor 
being hostile to the ‘‘morbid effluvias’’ of the corpse. It 
was also burned in the chambers of fever patients. So, in 
time, this rose-of-Mary (it is really ros marinum) because 
a token to wear in remembrance of the dead, and later it was 
prized as a stimulant to all memories. 
Poisons appear to have been studied almost as early as 
simples. Forbidden things of the dark were used in incan- 
tations, and the mysteries of diabolism and magic could 
not have been practised without vegetable material. Monks- 
hood was used to breed fever; deadly nightshade caused the

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    eater of it to see ghosts; henbane threw its victim into con- 
vulsions ; bittersweet caused skin eruptions; meadow saffron 
and black hellebore racked the nerves and caused their 
victim to swell to unsightly proportions; briony set the nose 
a-bleeding; eyebright sowed seeds of rheumatism in the 
bones. 
Larger and finer meanings are read into the older 
legends of the plants, and the universality of certain myths 
is expressed in the concurrence of ideas in the beginnings 
of the great religions. One of the first figures in the lead- 
ing cosmogonies is a tree of life guarded by a serpent. In 
the Judaic faith this was the tree in the garden of Eden; 
the Scandinavians made it an ash, Ygdrasil; Christians 
usually specify the tree as an apple, Hindus as a soma, 
Persians as a homa, Cambodians as a talok; this early tree 
is the vine of Bacchus, the snake-entwined caduceus of Mer- 
eury, the twining creeper of the Eddas, the bohidruma of 
Buddha, the fig of Isaiah, the tree of Ausculapius with the 
serpent about its trunk. These trees of the early cosmog- 
onies are not all actualities, by any means. There is no 
botanical class for the tree of Siberian legend, which sprang 
up without branches. God caused nine limbs to shoot from 
it, and nine men were born at its foot: fathers of the nine 
races. Five of the branches, that turned toward the east, 
furnished fruit for men and beasts, but the fruits that 
grew on the four western branches God forbade to men, and 
he sent a dog and a snake to guard them. While the snake 
slept, Erlik, the tempter, climbed into the western branches 
and persuaded Edji, the woman, to eat the forbidden fruit. 
This she shared with her husband, Torongoi, and the pair, 
realizing their guilt, covered themselves with skins and hid 
under the tree. : 
These relations between the human and the vegetable 
world are also indicated in legends of curses and blessings, 
14
-P-A-G-E-17
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    wherein faiths have grown from incidents, and in not a few 
of these instances the fortunes of men, towns, and even 
dynasties are related to trees. The old pear of the Unster- 
berg, for instance, would signify the end of imperial power 
by withering, and when the German empire was dissolved 
in 1806 it ceased to blossom; but in 1871 it suddenly woke 
to life and bore fruit. 
To primitive people who thus symbolized natural phe- 
nomena, vegetable life was, in a manner, glorified, because 
it sustained all other life. The tree supplied lumber, fuel, 
house, thatch, cordage, weapons, boats, shields, and tools, 
as well as fruit and medicine. 
Everywhere the flowers are a calendar of the seasons, 
and in early moral codes and proverbs the tree is a likeness 
of strength and graciousness. The Brahmins have fitting 
metaphors for the kindness of the oak in shading the wood- 
man who hacks its trunk, and of the sandalwood that re- 
sponds to the blow of the ax with perfume, the meaning 
of these symbols being that the perfect one will love his 
enemies. The mystic is added to the symbolic through the 
ages, in that the leaves have been speaking to those who 
listened. The palm, stirring in the wind, spoke to Abraham 
in language that he translated as the words of deity, and 
Mahomet commands its worship as the tree of paradise, the 
date being chief of the fruits of the world, for it came out 
of heaven with wheat, chief of foods, and myrtle, chief of 
perfumes.

  EARLY CHRISTIAN LEGENDS 
A THRONG of legends bring to mind Christ’s agony and 
crucifixion, and some of them are betokened in usages of 
the present day. For example, it is believed in Austria 
that hawthorn and blackthorn were the materials from 
which the wreath of torture was fashioned; hence on Good 
Friday there is a sport of retaliation in which Christian 
hoodlums put ‘‘thorn apples’’ into the hair of little Jews. 
The veritable crown was reported by the faithful to have 
passed into the hands of Baldwin, who gave it to Saint 
Louis. That king received it as a penitent, barefooted and 
elad in a hair shirt, bore it to Paris in splendor and solem- 
nity, and built that perfect piece of Gothic architecture, the 
Sainte Chapelle, as a casket for the relic, though some of 
the thorns have been given to other churches, and they have 
as miraculously multiplied as have fragments of the true 
eross. The hawthorn is so covered by white blossoms in 
the spring that its long spikes are hardly seen, but they are 
eapable of inflicting a painful wound. On the way to Cal- 
vary a bird fluttered down to the head of the Victim and 
pulled out a thorn that was rankling in his brow. The 
sacred blood tinged the feathers of the little creature, who 
has worn the mark since that day, and we call him robin 
red-breast. Hawthorn often flowers in a mild English 
winter, and the famous one of Glastonbury habitually puts 
forth blossoms at Christmas; at least, it is known to have 
been in bloom on Christmas day so recently as 1881. This 
holy thorn is—or, shall we say in our doubting time, was— 
believed to have been carried into England in the year ’31 ° 
by Joseph of Arimathea, when he went to teach Christianity 
to the Britons. On reaching Wearyall Hill, near the present 
16
-P-A-G-E-19
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. sich: ceaseless a ciaeieeainladeieaicaeeaiiiaimeoeimiaiaaiibias 
town of Glastonbury, he struck his walking staff into the 
earth to indicate his intention to abide there; and leaving 
it thus, with its end in the soil, the sap stirred to fresh life, 
put forth leaves, and flourished for centuries, a noble speci- 
men. Some declared that it bloomed at the moment when 
the rod was forced into the frozen ground. The sale of its 
flowers, twigs, and cuttings brought large revenues to the 
monastery: that was built near the scene of the miracle. 
It was finally destroyed by the Puritans as a reproof of the 
superstitions charged upon the followers of the Roman 
church. 
Another famous hawthorn is that of Cawdor Castle, 
scene of the ‘‘Macbeth’’ tragedy. The first thane of Caw- 
dor was told in a dream to load an ass with gold, allow it ta 
wander free, and build a castle where it stopped to rest. 
This the dreamer did, and the donkey lay down under a haw- 
thorn. The heavenly injunction was so implicitly obeyed 
that the architect built the first tower with the hawthorn in 
the centre, and its aged trunk is still seen in the dungeon, 
its branches penetrating the breaches in the wall, and its 
root extending far under the flagging. Once a year Lord 
Cawdor assembles his guests about the trunk, and they 
drink health to the hawthorn, thereby signifying health to 
the house. 
Some maintain that Christ’s crown came from the 
acacia, or shittim wood, while others say that the holly was 
the bush from which the crown of thorns was torn. Indeed, 
the name of the latter means ‘‘holy,’? and it was only 
through a careless shortening of the vowel that it came to 
be as we know it. The use of this plant for Christmas 
decoration still further proves this association with Scrip- 
tural incident. 
The purple of the jack-in-the-pulpit and the red stain 
of the Belgian rood selken mark where the blood of the 
2 17 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    crucified fell in the hour of agony, as the color of the red 
bud, or Judas tree, tells how the tree burned with shame 
when Judas hanged himself upon it. | Speedwell, or ger- 
mander speedwell, is in the botanies disguised as veronica 
chamedrys, yet in that name is a token of its history, for 
on the way to Calvary Christ paused for a moment while 
Saint Veronica wiped the blood and sweat from his face. 
The cloth she used in this ministration was stained there- 
after with a miraculous portrait of the Saviour a vera 
ikonika, or true image; whence, Veronica. Where the 
blood dropped on the flowers she was wearing, they shared 
in the sacred impress, and so they took her name, because 
they are thought to show a human countenance like that 
upon her napkin. 
Cyclamen—‘‘cock of the mountain,’’ the Arab calls 
it—strange flower with bent back, curved petals, and crim- 
son eye looking down, as if expectant of the earth to yield 
treasure to it, abounds in Holy Land, where it was dedicated 
to the Virgin because the sword of sorrow that pierced her 
heart is symbolized in the blood drop at the heart of this 
flower. For the like reason it was also known as the 
bleeding nun. 
Other legends respecting the crucifixion are indicated 
in the name of ‘‘blood drops of Christ,’’ as applied in Pales- 
tine to the scarlet anemone; in the selection of the flowering 
almond as a symbol of the Virgin; in the repute of the bul- 
rush, or cat-tail, that it was the sceptre that the Jews put 
into the hands of Christ when they mocked him as their 
king; in the monkish declaration that the red poppy con- 
tains a divine revelation, since it bears the cross in its 
centre ; in the Canary Islands the custom of cutting bananas 
lengthwise because when cut across they show the symbol 
of the crucifixion; and in the story that the figs of the 
Cistercian convent in Rome, when cut through, show a green 
18

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    eross inlaid on a white pulp, with five seeds at its angles 
representing the five wounds. The Rose of Sharon is also 
held to be a symbol of the resurrection, for when its blos- 
soms fall they are borne by the wind to a distant place there 
to root and bloom anew. Vervain (verbena hastata), once 
used for garlanding the poor brutes led to the sacrifice 
in Rome, has long been known as the holy herb. The 
Greeks so called it; the Druids and Romans employed it in 
magical and mystic ceremonies, and as a drug; hence it was 
easily adapted into the Christian legends, and it became one 
of the crucifixion flowers. 
Because the spurge yields a milky juice, it is called Vir- 
gin’s nipple, though we lack a tradition that connects the 
plant with any word or act of the Virgin. The white lily 
as well as the hierochloa, or holy grass, is sacred to her. 
‘Madonna lilies’? burst into bloom on Easter dawn; they 
put forth from the rod of St. Joseph, and were borne by 
the angel of the annunciation. Walking in the garden of 
Zacharias, whither she often repaired to meditate on the 
burden laid upon her as the bride of God, the Virgin 
touched a flower which till then had exhaled no fragrance, 
but at that contact gave forth a delightful perfume. This 
was doubtless the lily. A careless use of the name by older 
writers leaves us in doubt as to the plant referred to in the 
sermon on the mount. 
The little flower we call Star of Bethlehem, whose bulb 
is roasted and eaten by orientals, is part of that very light 
which shone in the heavens at the birth of Christ: for after 
- it had led the wise men and shepherds to the manger it 
burst, like a meteor, scattering acres of flowers about the 
fields. It was as if it had been drawn from the glorious 
company of the skies by the great glory of the Babe. 
Joseph, going out at dawn, gathered handfuls of these blos- 
soms from the wintry earth, and, pouring them into the

    lap of Mary, said, ‘‘See, the star in the east has fallen and 
borne fruit in kind.’’ 
Then, there is hellebore, otherwise black hellebore, 
Christmas rose, or Christmas flower. This was held in esti- 
mation from early times, though it was believed to absorb 
its ill odor from the sick. The Greeks regarded it as a 
remedy for madness, and in sending the insane to Anticyra, 
where it abounds, they afforded one of the few instances of 
anything like attention to the needs of the suffering and 
unfortunate in a land and age that were without almshouses, 
hospitals, and asylums. Down to the time of Queen Eliza- 
beth it was the hellebore cured melancholy, and the Ger- 
mans, who connected it with Huldah, the marriage goddess, 
later gave to it the name of Christmas rose. The story of 
its birth is this: On the night when heaven sang to the 
shepherds of Bethlehem, a little girl followed her brothers, 
the keepers of the flocks, under guidance of the light. 
When she saw the wise men gathered at the inn, offering 
vessels of gold and fabrics of silk to the child and its mother, 
she hung timidly back on the edge of the crowd, and was 
sad because her hands were empty; because the look in the 
face of the babe had filled her with admiration and wonder, 
and she wished to testify her love. She had no goods, no 
money to buy them, so after a little she turned away toward 
the silent hills. But when she had gone back to her flocks, 
at the border of the desert, under the lonely stars, a light 
suddenly shone about her, and behold, one of the announc- 
ing angels—a glorious creature whose robe was like molten 
silver, whose locks were as the sun. ‘‘Little one, why do 
you carry sorrow in your heart?’’ he asked. 
‘‘Because I could carry no joy to the child of Bethle- 
hem,’’ she answered. 
With a smile the spirit waved a lily that he carried, and 
suddenly the ground was white with Christmas roses. The 
20

girl knelt with a joyous ery, filled her arms with the 
flowers, and hastened to the village, where the people made 
way for her, looking with wonder on the burden she bore 
that winter night. As she reached the manger the holy 
one, turning from the gems and gold of the magi, reached 
forth his tiny hands for the blossoms, and smiled as the 
shepherdess heaped them at his feet. 
The chrysanthemum, which was born at the same time 
as the babe of Bhethlehem, was the token to the wise men 
that they had reached the spot whither the sta: had bidden 
them; for, searching along the narrow ways of the village 
toward the fall of night, these rulers of tribes and ex- 
pounders of doctrine wondered greatly what should be 
disclosed to them. There was no excitement among the 
people, to denote a strange event; there were no weleoming 
sounds of music, dancing, or the feast; all was silent and 
gloomy, when at a word from King Malcher, the caravan 
stood still. ‘‘ It is the place,’’ he cried, ‘‘ for look! Here 
is a flower, rayed like the star that has guided us, and which 
is even now hanging above our hcads.’’ 
As Malcher bent and picked it, the stable door opened 
of itself and the pilgrims entered in. Malcher placed the 
chrysanthemum in the hand extended to receive it—the 
hand of a little, new-born babe—and all went to their knees 
before the shining presence, bearing as a sceptre the winter 
flower, white likeness of the guide star. 
Cacti are of power over witches, and that queer speci- 
men of the race, the ‘‘old man,’’ with its long gray spines 
like hair, is to the Mexican the soul of a baptized Christian, 
hence not to be touched by unclean hands.

    FAIRY FLOWERS 
    
FLowemrs were as naturally associated with fairies as 
with sunshine, moonbeams, and other bright, beautiful, or 
tricksy things. The ‘‘little people’’ hid in flowers, made 
their cloaks of petals, their crowns of stamens, their darts 
of thorns, their cradles of lilies, their seats of fungi. As 
the burly gods of the Norsemen and the majestic deities of 
Greece represented nature as force, so the fairies personated 
nature’s gentler, daintier attributes. They were the souls 
of the flowers, mischievous when the flowers exhaled a 
poison ; beneficent when the flowers were wholesome. 
The mottlings of the cowslip and the foxglove, like the 
spots on butterfly wings and on the tails of pheasants and 
peacocks, mark where elves have placed their fingers. On 
the foxglove these marks are dull and threatening, deno- 
tive of the baneful juices that the plant secretes, and which 
as digitalis (digitus: a finger) we turn to account in our 
pharmacopeia. This evil quality gives to it the name of 
dead-man’s-thimbles in Ireland, and its patches are held 
to resemble those on the skins of venomed snakes. In 
Wales, the plant is known as the fairy glove, but it is 
Virgin’s glove or ‘‘gloves of our Lady”? in France, while 
in old English herbals it is witch’s glove, fairy thimble, 
fairy’s cap, folk’s glove; yet in Norway Reynard claims it 
again, for there it is fox bell. A legend of the North is that 
bad fairies gave these blossoms to the fox, that he might put 
them on his toes to soften his tread when he prowled among 
the roosts. 
The anemone is a fairy shelter, curling up as night or 
storm approaches, and thus protecting its oecupant, but the 
wee creatures sit oftener in the cowslip cups, and those 
human and undoubting souls that ean listen at such a time 
with the ear of childhood hear a fine, high music, like 
a harmonized hum of bees. This oftenest comes from the 
22
-P-A-G-E-25
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    flowers when the sun is shining on them. In England the 
cowslip used to be the key flower, or key wort, or St. 
Peter’s wort, because the umbel is supposed to resemble 
the bunch of keys carried by St. Peter; indeed, the Germans 
still call it the key of heaven. 
Fairies protect the stitchwort, and it must not be gath- 
ered, or the offender will be ‘‘fairy led’’ into swamps and 
thickets at night. One of the oddest of beliefs is that St. 
Johnswort and ragwort are a day disguise of fairy horses. 
If you tread them down after sunset a horse will arise from 
the root of each injured plant and that night will gallop 
about with you, leaving you at dawn either at home or far 
abroad, as it may happen. They have a kinder plant in 
China, although it bears the name of sin; for, being eaten, 
it changes a man to a fairy and gives him a long lease of 
youth. 
England has a fungus known as fairy butter, and our 
country has fairy rings of toadstools and coarse grass that 
spring in the footsteps of the sprites as they dance. The 
fruit of the mallow is fairy cheese, toadstools are fairy 
tables, and the tiny cup fungi, like nests with eggs, are fairy 
purses. Our elm is elven, or elf tree, and fayberry is a 
name still extant for gooseberry. In Denmark a fairy is 
an elle, and elle-campane and elle-tree, or alder, are favorites 
with the ‘“‘little people.’? Should you stand beneath an 
alder at midnight on midsummer eve, you may see the king 
of the elles, or elves, go by with all his court. The alder 
has understanding, too, and will weep blood if it hears talk 
of cutting it down. 
Originally the alder and the willow were two fishermen 
who refused to spare time from their labors to join in the 
worship of Pales, whereupon the goddess turned them into 
those two trees, and to this day they haunt the banks of 
streams, leaning over them as if watching for fish, and the 
willow letting down its lines into the water.

NARCOTICS AND STIMULANTS 
  We who eat and wear and smoke the plants and drink 
their sap and juices find in them not only sustenance and 
shelter, but dreams, medicine, and death; the sharpening 
and dulling of our nerves; support for the weak and refresh- 
ment for the fainting. We find, moreover, oblivion and in- 
spiration, so frail an instrument is this whereby we move 
and think, and so obedient to suggestions from without. 
There are persons so sensitive that a breath of air blowing 
from poison ivy will cause them to break out in an unseemly 
manner, though we are told that Indians make themselves 
immune to its outward poison by the occasional eating of its 
leaf. Out of the visions created by the action of drugs on 
the brain or nervous centres have come not merely the conse- 
eration of plants themselves, but the growth of religious 
practices and beliefs. We find in nearly all cosmogonies 
a recognition of the tree, and at this day among savage 
tribes vegetable life is exalted, as is that of humanity and 
the animals, in rites, observances, and faiths. The use of 
plants among priests and medicine men indicates their 
remedial value in disease, and whatever confers health or 
happiness is by implication heavenly in its origin. It is 
an article of savage faith that certain of these plants are 
universal in their power, though we may doubt if serpents 
eat fennel to sharpen their sight, or hawks eat hawkweed for 
the same purpose. It is a fact, however, that cats, dogs, 
and other carnivore resort to herbs as medicines and stimu- 
lants. 
The mescal (anhalonium Lewini) is a variety of cactus 
that grows in the desert all the way from Oklahoma to 
Mexico, and from it the aborigines gather the bean or button 
4
-P-A-G-E-27
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
which, in Moqui phrase, enables man to commune with God. 
The plant is revered in the same manner as is the rattle- 
snake who bears away the prayer for rain after the snake 
dance. Mescal produces on the optic nerve something of 
the same effect as rubbing the eyes. In spite of govern- 
mental and scientifie objection, it continues to be used, and 
apparently causes a local inflammation or congestion which 
reflects itself in a sense of bright colors in kaleidoscopic 
patterns and shifting clouds. To obtain these consolations, 
the bean is swallowed, and the colors sometimes take on 
fantastic shapes wherein one reads prophecy. 
Few, if any, races have escaped the influence of narcotics 
and stimulants, and, inconsistent though it seem, those who 
do with the least of them are not the most progressive 
peoples. The Chinese smoke opium, it is true, and the 
Indians tobacco, but civilized man has accustomed himself 
to opium, tobacco, wine, tea, coffee, and cocaine. The 
use of plants that estranged the senses from their sane 
functioning accounts for not a few religious practices. 
The Druids made their altars under the oak because that 
tree inspired to prophecy. Brahmins drink soma, the 
juice of asclepias acida, to obtain second sight, for it is ‘‘the 
essence of all nourishment.’’ The Delphic oracle ate laurel 
leaves, sacred to Apollo, to hasten the toxic effect of the 
voleanic gases which ascended the cleft where the sacred 
tripod was placed. Prophets slept on beds of laurel, also, 
as certain dream interpreters among the Russian peasantry 
sleep on beds of ‘‘dream herb,’’ or pulsatilla pateus, for a 
like purpose. 
Among stimulants or irritants, not many of us would 
include the pretty yarrow, or milfoil, of our waysides, 
with its delicately fragrant and finely divided leaf, yet its 
other name of field hop points to its former use in beer, and 
the drink made from it is said to be more devastating than 
25
-P-A-G-E-28
    MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    the ordinary kind. In the Orkneys it is both a tea and a 
eure for melancholy, while in Scotland it is a salve. In 
Switzerland it sharpens vinegar, and in sme other countries 
it is ‘‘old man’s pepper’’ and cures toothache. Its botani- 
eal name of achillea records its use by Achilles in healing 
the wounds of his soldiers. 
Tobacco was known to our Indians before white men ever 
heard of it, and they smoked it both for pleasure and as a 
ratification of contracts for centuries before the landing of 
Columbus. The first pipe was a tobago, or double roll of 
bark, placed at the nostrils and held over a bunch of the 
burning leaf, but the men of the north have had their stone 
pipes for a thousand years, no doubt, and they were shaped 
from the sacred rock at the command of the Great Spirit, 
who ordained the ceremonial of smoking in confirmation 
of brotherhood, the pipe passing from mouth to mouth as 
the loving cup passes at our tables. 
Smoking suggests coffee, without which it is hardly 
worth while. Coffee grew in Arabia for ages before it was 
the good fortune of the dervish Hadji Omar to discover it. 
This happened in 1285. He had been driven into exile from 
Mocha because of his attempts to establish the strange cus- 
tom of honesty among its governors, and in the extremity 
of his hunger he ravened upon coffee berries that were 
growing wild in the environs. They were pretty bad, so 
in the hope of softening their acerbity he tried the experi- 
ment of roasting them. This made them more tolerable, 
and they yielded a pleasant savor and an entrancing smell, 
but they were viciously hard. Hadji then boiled them in 
water, and they became more nearly edible, but the water 
was the best part of them. By eating and drinking of the 
coffee, he did not satisfy his appetite, yet he so effectually 
suppressed it that it was the next thing to having dined. 
Here, then, was a discovery! He hurried back to inform 
26
-P-A-G-E-29
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  the public of it, trusting to be forgiven for his reforms. 
And he was not only forgiven, but was promoted to be a 
saint. It took centuries to introduce the berry to a wider 
circle of admirers, for even in the middle of the sixteenth 
century it was disapproved by the priesthood of Constanti- 
nople, who said that the habit of idling over the coffee- 
cups was taking worshippers from the mosques, and that 
the coals on which the beans were roasted were the coals of 
hell. An enemy of coffee declares that its introduction 
to the world of men was made when an Arab herder in the 
fifth century discovered that his goats, having ignorantly. 
eaten it, were cutting capers like those possessed of devils. 
He tried the berries himself, found they were a slow poison, 
introduced them delightedly to his ‘‘system,’’ and so died, 
beloved and indorsed by millions. 
Tea has left its record on American history, for who 
knows if the Revolution would have revolved without the 
Boston tea party? In the want of the herb the Yankee 
housewife solaced herself with substitutes derived from cat- 
nip, nettles, tansy, and other doubtful plants, and although 
she sternly refused to accept an article unjustly taxed, there 
is no doubt that she sighed for the better fortunes of her 
English sisters and brothers. In an old commendation, 
tea ‘‘easeth the brain of heavy damps; prevents the dropsie; 
consumes rawnesse; vanquishes superfluous sleep; purifieth 
humors and hot liver; strengthens the use of due benevo- 
lence.”’ 
In Okakura Kakuzo’s ‘‘Book of Tea’’ we discover that 
the brewings of the herb are more than a stomachice com- 
fort: they have spiritual importance, and there is even a 
“‘teaism,’’ ‘‘founded on adoration of the beautiful among 
the sordid facts of every-day existence.’’ The leaves were 
formerly powdered before being placed in the water, and 
some heavy-handed cooks crushed them in a mortar, worked 
27

  them into cakes, boiled them with spices, ginger, salt, orange 
peel, milk, rice, and onions! In the Cha-king, or holy 
scripture of tea, a book of three volumes, we learn that the 
best leaves must be wrinkled like a Tartar’s boots, curled 
like a bull’s dewlap, must unfold like mist from a valley, 
shine like a lake in the breeze, and in dampness and softness 
suggest the earth refreshed by rain. Another poet describes 
the effect of his various drafts: the first cup moistens his 
throat; the second relieves his loneliness; the third revives 
memories of books and stimulates him to write them; the 
fourth causes a sweat in which all that is wrong in life 
passes out at the pores; the fifth completes the purification ; 
the sixth summons him to the gods, and the seventh wafts 
him into their presence. The Japanese tea-room is kept 
bare and simple, that the fancy, liberated by the draft, may 
not be arrested from its flights by the intrusion of unim- 
portant objects.

  PLANTS OF ILL RENOWN 
  THERE was once in the middle of Java a certain tree 
that dripped and breathed poison, destroying animal and 
vegetable life for miles around. Even the birds fell dead 
when flying past. It stood alone in a valley which it filled 
with vapors, and all about it the earth was covered with the 
skeletons of men and animals that had strayed into the 
neighborhood. This famous upas tree (upas is Malay for 
poison) was the only one in existence, but the name is still 
applied to a tree of the same order as the breadfruit and 
mulberry. Its juices, mixed with pepper and ginger, are 
smeared upon arrows to make them irritating, and its bark 
yields a fibre used in native cloth which will cause itching 
unless it is soundly washed before wearing. On so slight 
a basis was the legend of the upas reared. 
Allied to the dreadful tree of Java is the rattlesnake 
bush of Mexico, with its venomous thorns. From this arose 
a story of a tree of serpents that wound its arms about 
men and animals that tried to pass, and stung and strangled 
them to death. Nearly as vexatious is the kerzra flower, of 
Persia, for if you so much as breathe the air that has passed. 
over it you must die. Nor is the manchineel an object of 
fond regard, inasmuch as death comes to any that shall 
rest beneath its branches and suffer themselves to sink into 
the sleep that its exhalations will induce. 
Trees usually bring luck to their owners, but the walnut 
is an exception. It is thought to kill vegetation near it, 
and to bear especial enmity to the oak. Paschal II hewed 
down a walnut in Rome because he discovered that the evil 
soul of Nero was living in its branches, and after the de- 
struction of the tree the Church of the People was built 
29
-P-A-G-E-32
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC.   
  upon its site as a security against the demon. Thus it 
appears that the walnut is hospitable to wicked spirits. 
By some similar token, the yew was long thought to be 
dangerous to life and health, although thousands of men 
made bows from its wood and carried them without hurt 
except to other people. 
While the powers of good control various of the plants, 
others are under spell of evil creatures who work their will 
by poisons, but who also show themselves to those they 
would afflict. Belladonna is so beloved of the Devil that 
he goes about trimming and tending it in his not abundant 
leisure. He can be diverted from its care on only one 
night in the year, and that is Walpurgis, when he is pre- 
paring for the witches’ sabbat. If on that night a farmer 
looses a black hen the Devil will chase it, and the watchful 
farmer, suddenly darting on the plant, may pluck and put 
the weed to its rightful use; for by rubbing his horse with 
it the animal gains strength, provided the herb is gained 
in the way here indicated. The apples of Sodom are held 
to be related to this plant, and the name belladonna, or 
beautiful lady, records an old superstition that at certain 
times it takes the form of an enchantress of exceeding love- 
liness, whom it is dangerous to look upon. 
We may dismiss as mythical the travelled tale of a 
Venus fly-trap which was magnified into quite another mat- 
ter before Captain Arkright was through with it, for such 
tales grow larger the farther they go from their beginning. 
It was in 1581 that the valiant explorer learned of an atoll 
in the South Pacific that one might not visit, save on peril 
of, his life, for this coral ring inclosed a group of islets on 
one of which the Death Flower grew; hence it was named 
El Banoor, or Island of Death. This flower was so large 
that a man might enter it—a cave of color and perfume— 
but if he did so it was the last of him, for, lulled by its 
30
-P-A-G-E-33
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
lll 
strange fragrance, he reclined on its lower petals and fell 
into the sleep from which there is no waking. Then, as if 
to guard his slumber, the flower slowly folded its petals 
about him. The fragrance inereased and burning acid 
was distilled from its calyx, but of all hurt the victim was 
unconscious, and so passing into death through splendid 
dreams, he gave his body to the plant for food. 
Dreads such as are recorded in this narrative extended to 
the humblest forms of vegetation, and our uncanny fungi 
have not escaped the ascription of many evils. True, their 
reputation for poisoning is in part deserved, though there 
are more beneficent mushrooms than mischievous, and, as 
Hamilton Gibson proved, hundreds of tons of wholesome 
food go to daily waste in our fields for lack of knowledge 
among the people to recognize the edible varieties or to know 
when to gather and how to cook them. The common puff- 
ball is ripe for the kitchen while it is in its white state, 
for instance, but is past eating when it has turned leathery 
and throws out its gust of ‘‘smoke’’ or spores when trodden. 
. A giant puff-ball is reported which held food for at least 
one family, inasmuch as it weighed forty-seven pounds and 
was three feet thick! It is the threads of old puff-balls that 
supplied our grandfathers with tinder in the days when 
fire was started with flint and steel, and their dust was also 
used to stop blood flow, as some use cobwebs in emergencies 
to-day. Punk, in use on our Fourth of July, is also made 
from fungus. In parts of England the puff-ball is Puck’s 
stool and Puck’s fists, and some etymologists identify Puck 
with pogge, or toad. ; 
Why are toadstools so named? Surely none ever saw 
a toad seated on one of them. The stools are apt to be 
kicked to pieces by the peasantry, especially if they are 
found growing in pixie rings, for then they surely shelter 
elves and if an elf peers at you then quinine should be 
31
-P-A-G-E-34
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
taken, for you are ‘‘due to come down with fever.’’ If it 
is a cow that is looked at by the elf, she is thenceforth 
bewitched, and will give sour milk, or discover a disposition 
to dance and turn somersaults. These pixie rings are 
merely growths spreading centrifugally and sometimes over- 
lapping. As grass inside the rings is shadowed by the 
fungi and loses a measure of its sustenance to them, the 
country folk ascribe the bare appearance of the sod to the 
dancing of the elves. The rings disappear in three or four 
years, and then it is said that the fairies have taken offense 
and gone elsewhere. The spores dropping from the parent 
plant exhaust the soil as they take root, and for that reason 
the growth is outward, not inward, the circles constantly 
widening toward new feeding grounds. The low form of 
life known as lichen spreads in a similar manner. 
It is the purple streaks on its stem rather than the scathe 
in its juice that gives a bad name to water hemlock— 
the plant that put Socrates to death—for these streaks are 
copies of the brand put on Cain’s brow when he had com- 
mitted murder. The plant bears the names of spotted cow- 
bane, musquash root and beaver poison, in America, and 
is related to carrot, parsnip, parsley, fennel, caraway, 
celery, coriander, and sweet cicely, the latter also unwhole- 
some. 
Jack-in-the-pulpit, or Indian turnip, known in England 
as lords-and-ladies, is another plant from which it was 
wise to keep a distance. Its name, arisema triphyllum, 
signifies bloody arum, because its spathe is purple where 
Christ’s blood fell upon it at the crucifixion. 
In our own country the laurel or kalmia was regarded 
with such dislike that people were warned against eating the 
flesh of birds that had fed on its berries. Even worse than 
laurel is the savin, called likewise magician’s cypress and 
devil’s tree, because it was used by wizards in some of their 
82
-P-A-G-E-35
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
most sinful ceremonies. Our common milkwort, polygala 
vulgaris, is beneficent, and increases the milk of mothers 
who carry it in procession or wear it as a garland in Roga- 
tion week; but the Javanese variety, polygala venanta, is 
a dreadful herb, inasmuch as the native who touches it must 
sneeze himself to death. Another plant of fell property is 
the garget or poke, although its young shoots are boiled and 
eaten like asparagus, and its tincture is administered for 
rheumatism by granny doctors. 
The catalogue of roadside mischiefs would be incomplete 
without the henbane—bane of hens—or hog’s bean, whose 
scientific mask is hyoscyamus, and which is held to be of 
so evil an aspect, with its woolly leaves and unsanctified- 
looking flowers, that one hardly needs to be warned from it. 
Witches use this in their midnight stews, and the dead in 
hades are crowned with it as they wander hopelessly be- 
side the Styx.
-P-A-G-E-36
  FLOWERS, TREES, FRUITS AND PLANTS   
  ACACIA 
Ovr locust tree, the blossoms of which exhale ravishing 
odors in the spring, is the American variety of acacia, the 
““inecorruptible wood’’ of which was made the ark of the 
covenant and the altar of the tabernacle. It also pro- 
vided thorns for the crown of Christ. The Buddhist, to 
whom it is sacred, burns its wood on his altars; and a species 
of it, known as the sami, is used by Hindus in the cere- 
monial begetting of fire for sacrifices. 
A folk-tale of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty is almost 
identical with a legend of our Arapaho Indians, except that 
in the American story a blue feather replaces the acacia. 
The Egyptian narrative is as follows: 
Bata, a predecessor of Joseph, is loved by the wife of 
his elder brother, but he will none of her, so, enraged, she 
tells her husband, Anpu, that Bata has attempted violence 
toward her. Bata proves his innocence, but he can no 
longer find comfort in his old home, so he mutilates him- 
self and departs, leaving Anpu to mourn his loss and kill 
the deceitful woman. 
Reaching the valley of the acacia, Bata removes his soul 
and places it in the topmost flower of that plant for safe- 
keeping. The gods pity the young exile, and the Sun orders 
that a mate be made for him, ‘‘more beautiful in her limbs 
than any other woman in the land.’’ Bata is comforted in 
her society, but tells her that while he is hunting she must 
keep to the house. She does not obey, but in his absence 
walks by the shore. The Sea reaches after her, roaring to 
the acacia to detain her; but the most the tree can do is 
to lower a branch and tear out a lock of her hair, which it 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
drops into the sea. This floats to the Egyptian shore, where 
they are washing Pharaoh’s linen. The perfume of acacia 
blossoms, clinging to the hair, so sweetens the Nile waters 
that it is imparted to the garments, and the King asks its 
origin. <A priest tells him that the fragrance comes from 
the hair of a daughter of the gods. In his eagerness to know 
her, Pharaoh sends to all parts of the world. Bata slays 
all but one of the invaders of the acacia valley, but this one 
brings a larger foree and abducts the woman. She is will- 
ing, and asks Pharaoh to destroy the tree on which her 
husband’s soul is concealed. The king sends another troop 
into Bata’s land, and the tree is cut down. Bata falls dead. 
Far away, Anpu, sitting at his meat, calls for a pot of 
beer. It foams and boils. He calls for wine, but that is 
foul. By these signs he knows that his brother is dead, 
and he sets off for the acacia valley, to recover his soul, if 
possible. The body is there, but the tree that guarded the 
soul is gone. After a three-years’ search, he discovers the 
seed-pod of an acacia, and in the hope that it may contain 
his brother’s spirit, he puts it into a cup of water. The 
thirsty soul drinks until no drop is left. Then Anpu fills 
the cup again and puts it to the lips of his dead brother, 
whose limbs had shaken as the seed-pod absorbed the water. 
The corpse drinks eagerly, then stands erect again—a man. 
He goes to Pharaoh, sends away his wife, and on the king’s 
death reigns for thirty years, being succeeded by Anpu. 
ACANTHUS 
The acanthus has been immortalized in architecture by 
the Corinthian column, the capital of which is a free copy 
of its leaves. Its use was suggested in this manner: 
A little girl of Corinth died and was buried in a spot 
where the acanthus grew. Her old nurse, carrying to the 
35

tomb a basket of the dead child’s toys and ornaments, placed 
it upon one of these plants. When the young leaves came 
up they were bent by the burden into a curve and prettily 
framed the basket; and the sculptor Callimachus, chancing 
by, was so charmed by the grace of their lines that he 
perpetuated them in stone. 
ACHYRANTHES 
This plant is indigenous to India, and in one of the 
religious ceremonies of the Hindus a flour of its seed is 
offered at daybreak to the god Indra. Many demons had 
this hero-deity slain, but the monster Namuchi finally over- 
powered him, and Indra was glad to make peace with him 
by promising that he would never again slay any creature 
with either a liquid or a solid, by day or by night. This ap- 
peared to Namuchi to embrace all possible contingencies, 
but Indra plucked a plant, which is neither solid nor liquid 
—at least, in his reasoning—and, falling upon Namuchi 
in the dawn, when it is neither day nor night, he slew that 
astonished creature. As soon as the demon was dead, the 
achyranthes sprang from his skull, and with this plant 
Indra flogged all the other demons out of existence. 
ACONITE 
We call this plant ‘‘monkshood’’ in America, because 
of its upper petal. Its cap-like form gives it the name of 
‘“troll’s hat’’ in Denmark, and ‘‘iron hat’’ and ‘‘storm hat’’ 
in Germany, where it is also ‘‘the devil’s herb,’’ for it is 
associated with the spells whereby witches invoke the devil. 
In Norway it is ‘‘Odin’s helmet,’’ there recalling the tarn- 
helm, or cap of darkness, which made its wearer invisible. 
The plant’s power for mischief has been recognized since

  the earliest recorded times, and even appears in the age 
of myth, as shall forthwith be disclosed : 
When Theseus returned from his wanderings he did 
not at once reveal himself to his father, Aigeus, but resolved 
to learn first how he might be affected toward him. ‘‘I have 
delivered the land from many monsters,’’ he told the old 
king, ‘‘and I ask for payment.’’ Then entered Medea, 
the beautiful witch, and, standing close to Theseus, so that 
the subtle perfume of her garments soothed and enticed 
him, she poured a flashing liquid into a golden goblet. 
‘“Welcome to the hero, the destroyer of evil,’’ she said. 
“Drink from this cup the wine which gives rest and life 
and closes every wound. It is the cup that gods might 
drink.’’ 
Taking the vessel into his hand, Theseus held it toward 
her, seeming about to drink to her eyes. Then he stood 
transfixed, for while Medea’s face was lovely, and the cloud 
of hair about it shone like the sunset, the eyes into which 
he had looked were glittering and reminded him of a 
snake’s. ‘‘The wine is nectar from Olympus, and its odor 
enraptures the sense, but she who brings it is fair beyond all 
other mortals,’’ he said. ‘‘It will give a finer flavor to 
the cup if she will taste it first, that the perfume of her lips 
may linger in the wine.’’ 
Medea faltered and grew white. ‘‘I am unwell,’’ she 
answered. 
“Drink, or, by the gods, you die at my hands!’’ cried 
Theseus, for he read the meaning of her hesitancy. The 
king and court looked on speechless with astonishment and 
fear. With a swift movement, Medea dashed the goblet 
to the floor, and ere the prince could strike had fled in her 
dragon chariot, never to be seen again. As the spilt liquor 
spattered over the floor, it caused the marble to crack and 
dissolve to powder, seething as it gathered into pools. 
87

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
Then the prince disclosed himself, and the palace was filled 
with rejoicing. 
While from its action on the marble we should assume 
Medea’s poison to have been a violent acid, tradition says 
that it contained aconite. It was with the juice of this 
plant that ancient armies anointed their spears and arrows, 
that a scratch might cause death, and it is said to be still 
used by some savage tribes. Chiron, the centaur, discov- 
ered the mischief in it by accidentally dropping an arrow 
thus poisoned on his hoof, dying in the discovery. By 
reason of its maleficence it was dedicated to Hecate, queen 
of hell, in whose garden it was sown by Cerberus, the 
three-headed monster who guards the place of shadows. 
ALLIGATOR TAIL 
In the old days alligators believed that life offered noth- 
ing more profitable than napping, eating, and lying in a 
shady swamp. But finally men penetrated the jungle, 
to the astonishment of the saurians, and as these men’s rude 
speech resembled the universal tongue of the jungle, some 
of the alligators understood. The men said such reptiles 
occupied the water on the other side of the mountains, and 
one stranger declared, ‘‘Our people over there believe alli- 
gators to be gods, so they feed them and care for them.’’ 
Here was a prospect to rouse wild hopes among the lis- 
teners. After the strangers had departed, several young 
alligators scrambled up the banks and awoke a veteran of 
their family. The veteran was unmoved. ‘‘Those strange 
animals that have been talking here are called men,’’ he 
told them. ‘‘Once they were monkeys, and lived in trees. 
They had to come down and walk on the earth because they 
cut off their tails, and ever since they have been so vain, 
because they are different from the rest, that there is no be- 
38
-P-A-G-E-41
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF I'LOWERS, ETC. 
    lieving anything they say. They do not worship alligators, 
you may be sure. On the contrary, they worship only 
themselves. ’’ 
The young alligators ascribed the veteran’s blase air to 
an indisposition to move, So hundreds of them set off for 
the promised land. At night they were tired with their 
unusual exertions, and, crawling into the marshes of the 
river known as the Winding Snake, they fell asleep. As 
they lay there the water gods discovered them. Now, these 
gods, having bidden the saurians keep to the hot lands, 
resented this curiosity and intrusion on the secret places. 
So they seized every alligator and thrust his head into the 
earth, leaving his tail gyrating in.the air. As alligators 
they ceased to be, but as plants they continue to this day, 
and explorers in the wilderness have, among other obstacles, 
to buffet their way through plantations of the tree known 
as the rabo de lagarto, or alligator’s tail. These trees stand 
as a warning to all the alligator tribes never to leave the 
lowlands. 
ALMOND 
The Princess Phyllis, and the youth, Demophoon, whose 
ships had been wrecked on the Thracian coast, fell in love 
with each other, and it was agreed that they should wed. 
But first Demophoon, his ships being repaired at the cost of 
his host, the Thracian king, set sail, with the promise that 
he would return as soon as he could put his affairs in order. 
Alas for the frailty of his sex, he was met at home by a 
maid so much fairer, in his eyes, that he forgot his promise. 
Phyllis watched at the shore, her heart leaping whenever a 
sail appeared on the horizon. In time she grew ill, and at 
last faded away in grief. But she was not carried to the 
grave, for the gods betokened their admiration for her con- 
stancy by turning her into an almond tree, and in that 
form she kept her watch, her arms still beckoning the un- 
39
-P-A-G-E-42
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
faithful one. So she stood when Demophoon returned, 
whether repentant or in quest of some advantage does not 
matter now; at all events, he learned what had happened, 
and, conscience-smitten, he sought the tree, fell at its feet, 
and embraced its trunk, watering its roots with tears, where- 
upon it burst into bloom for gladness. And in the Greek 
tongue the name of the almond became phylla, 
In Tuscany branches of almond are used to find hidden 
treasure, as the hazel is used elsewhere. Catholics assign 
the tree to the Virgin; Mahometans see in it the hope of 
heaven; and in Hebraic lore it was an almond that budded 
and fruited in the Tabernacle in a day, when Aaron had 
held it as his rod. 
Now, this rod of Aaron, being preserved with reverence, 
reached Rome and became the staff of the Pope, whereof 
another story. Wagner has familiarized the world with the 
Tannhiuser legend, though it long had currency in other 
than its musical form. The hero of the tale was a min- 
nesinger, and while on the way to take part in a singing 
contest, he came to a cave in the hill-side, at the entrance 
of which stood a woman of surpassing loveliness. Obeying 
her invitation, the minstrel followed her far into the moun- 
tain, where the cave broadened into a splendid chamber. 
It was Venus, queen of love, who had summoned him. 
Thought of time, duty, and memory of his fellow creatures 
slept in his mind for years; but there came a day when the 
perpetual revel palled, and he hungered for the coarser 
fruits of the earth. In vain he begged his captor to lead 
him to the outer world again. At last he fell on his knees 
and implored the Holy Virgin to rescue him. At the end 
of a long prayer, with closed eyes, he felt a cool breath 
touch his cheek, and, looking up, he discovered that he 
was on the Horselberg, back in the world, the sun shining 
overhead, He wept for joy. 
40
-P-A-G-E-43
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    A priest to whom he confessed declared that no other 
man had so offended, and that absolution could come only 
from the Pope. Tannhduser plodded wearily to Rome and 
appealed to the holy father. The recital of his experience 
filled Pope Urban with horror. ‘‘Guilt like yours,’’ he 
eried, ‘‘can never be forgiven! Before God Himself could 
pardon you, this staff that I hold would grow green and 
bloom!’’ The doomed one went his way, and in course of 
time found himself at the Horselberg once more. In sud- 
den desperation, he called aloud to Venus to take him back. 
The goddess did so, and three days after the mountain had 
closed upon them, the Pope’s staff suddenly put forth 
almond flowers and leaves. A great horror and a great 
sorrow filled the holy father, for he understood that God’s 
judgments are gentler than ours. He sent messengers in 
pursuit of Tannhauser, but to no purpose. He was lost 
to the world. 
Another legend concerns the novice in a monastery, 
who, in order that he might learn patience and obedience, 
was commanded to water a branch of styrax daily for two 
years, although he had to carry the water from the Nile, 
two miles away. Patience was rewarded when the branch, 
seemingly dead, burst into flower. Indeed, these legends 
of blossoming staffs and branches go back to the Romans, 
at least, for Virgil tells of the miracle in his Aineid. Tur- 
pin’s history of Charlemagne also relates an occurrence 
of this sort, but more unusual and startling, for the spears 
of the emperor’s troops, which had been thrust into the 
earth when he made camp, became a forest during the night 
and shaded the tents. In Jewish lore the terebinth grew 
from a staff carried by one of the angels who visited Abra- 
ham. It is also said that the staff carried by Joseph, when 
he sought the hand of Mary, broke into leaf in token of 
heaven’s sanction of the compact.

    AMARANTH 
In the faith of the ancients, amaranth, ‘‘the never- 
fading,’’ gemmed the fields of paradise. Though the aspho- 
del was the flower of death, the amaranth, as the flower 
of immortality in the symbolry of the Greeks, was used 
for funerary purposes. The Swedes have a national recog- 
nition of the flower in their Order of the Amaranth. That 
variety of the plant which we call ‘‘love-lies-bleeding,’’ be- 
eause of its bloody crimson, and that in France is ‘‘the 
nun’s scourge,’’ sirze to the Gallic mind it suggests the 
flagellations endured by penitents, is almost the only form 
of it familiar in our gardens. In countries that confess 
the Roman faith, the amaranth is one of the flowers chosen 
to decorate the churches on Ascension Day, thus showing the 
persistence of its Greek association with the life hereafter. 
Globe amaranth, prince’s feathers, cock’s comb, flower gen- 
tle, velvet flower, flower velure, and floramor are recent and 
ancient names for the plant. 
ANEMONE 
When Adonis had fallen, pierced by the fangs of the 
boar in whose pursuit he was more eager than in his re- 
sponse to the proffered love of Venus, that goddess be- 
dewed the earth with tears, and as too precious to evaporate 
back into air, the earth, with heaven’s alchemy, translated 
them into anemones. Their English name of wind-flowers 
commemorates the belief that they opened at command of 
the first mild breezes of the spring. To the Chinese, they 
are flowers of death, hence there is a wide association of them 
with grief and suffering, and they are often regarded as 
dangerous—a recent notion, for the Romans gathered them 
as a cure for the malarial fevers that the mosquitoes carried 
into the city from the Campagna.

In another legend, the ‘‘little wind rose,’’ as the Ger- 
mans name it, was a maid attached to the court of Chloris, 
where she was seen and loved by Zephyrus, the god who 
caused flowers and fruits to spring from the earth by 
breathing on it. Chloris fancied that the wind god was 
about to sue for her hand; hence, on discovering his pas- 
sion for Anemone, she drove that nymph from her presence 
in anger. Finding her broken-hearted, and hence dismal 
company, and having also to make his peace with Chloris, 
Zephyrus abandoned the poor creature, but in taking his 
leave changed her into the flower that bears her name. 
The ancients gathered the anemone to decorate the altars 
of Venus, since they were the tokens of her love, and also 
to wreathe the faces of the dead. The idea of immortality 
seems to have long pertained to it, and it is still known in 
parts of Europe as the Easter flower, or flower of the resur- 
rection. As ‘‘the cow bell,’’ it garlanded the cow in 
the Easter festivals of the Germans. In the holy land it 
is ‘‘the blood-drops-of-Christ’’ (a name oddly given to the 
wall-flower, also), for the sacred blood fell upon the anem- 
ones that were springing on Calvary on the evening of the 
crucifixion, and they. became red from that hour. As the 
fathers employed the triple leaf of this plant to symbolize 
the three personalities of the godhood, it also took the name 
of ‘‘herb trinity.’’ 
APPLE 
There is much symbolic use of the apple, and it appears 
in folk-lore as well as in Scripture; for it is grown in all 
lands where the sun is not too weak or too hot. We connect 
it with the oldest legend in the world—though there is really 
nothing in Scripture to show that the fruit with which 
Satan tempted Eve was not a pomegranate or a pear. The 
apple was also related to Venus, and praised by Solomon.

It was eaten by Swiss lake-dwellers, and prized by the 
Greeks and Romans, who tell how Atlanta lost her race by 
stooping to pick up the golden apples dropped by her com- 
petitor, whose life was forfeit if he failed to reach the 
goal ahead of her. It is the apple that unhappy Tantalus 
strives to reach, that he may ease hell’s torments, but its 
boughs are ever tossing upward as he has them almost 
in his grasp, just as the stream flows away from him when 
he stoops to drink. The apple of discord, and the apple 
of the Hesperides, are familiar figures in poetry. 
In the Norse legend Iduna kept a store of apples which 
the gods ate, thereby keeping themselves young. Loki, the 
fire-god, stole the fruit, and affairs went badly till the 
other deities had recovered it. 
A golden bird that seeks the golden apples of a king’s 
garden figures in northern fairy tales. The Poles tell 
how an adventurous youth, by fixing a lynx’s claws to his 
feet and hands, climbs to the summit of a glass mountain 
where grow golden apples, and there frees a princess from 
enchantment. In a German folk-tale, a girl who consents 
to act as godmother to a babe of the dwarfs is rewarded 
with an apronful of apples that turn to gold as she emerges 
from their underworld. The apple-tree supplanted the 
May-pole as a phallic symbol in England, and young 
people danced about it, singing their hopes for a year of 
plenty after sprinkling it with cider. In various lands the 
fruit or seed or blossom is used in divination, and I have 
seen Yankee cooks toss a paring over the shoulder, when 
they were peeling the fruit for sauce or pies, that they 
might learn the initial of their future husband, the paring 
as it fell being expected to shape itself to those letters. In 
England a girl will name a number of seeds for her pros- 
pective sweethearts, and the seed that stays longest when 
moistened and placed on her forehead indicates the man 
who will marry her.

The legend of St. Dorothea has two versions, one of 
which (see under head of roses) represents her as return- 
ing from heaven with flowers for the gibing Theophilus, 
while in the other she sends fruit. This latter recounts 
that the lawyer cried tauntingly to the saint, when she was 
led to death for heresy, ‘‘Send me some fruit from heaven.’’ 
““As you wish, Theophilus,’’ she answered; then asked 
the guard to halt a moment while she prayed. Suddenly a 
beautiful boy was discovered standing near, whom no one 
had seen to approach. In his hands was a basket of flowers, 
and, lying upon them, three great apples, streaked with 
emerald green and ruby red, vied in color and perfume 
with the blossoms. The saint said, ‘‘Give these to Theo- 
philus, and tell him there are more in paradise, where I 
hope to meet him.’’ A little later her head was struck off. 
Theophilus, smelling and tasting the fruit, was filled with 
wonder at the miracle, and presently embraced the faith 
he had despised, thereby winning martyrdom for himself, 
and with that heaven. 
In Persia, the apple is the fruit of immortality, as we 
learn from the tale of Anasindhu, a holy man who lived 
in a-wood with Parvati, his wife, speaking only thrice a 
year, and giving all his waking hours to meditations on 
virtue. The reputation he gained for wisdom and good- 
ness made him thc admiration of his country; but he had 
his heavenly reward also, for Gauri gave him an apple as a 
token that the gods wished him to live such a life forever. 
He placed it at his lips, but before tasting it his wife came 
into his mind—his overlooked and discontented wife. She 
had shared the hardships of his secluded life; why not 
its blessings, now that they had come? But to his aston- 
ishment she refused the fruit. ‘‘Why should I wish immor- 
tality?’’ she asked. ‘‘I could never be happy here in the 
forest, seeing no other faces, sharing no happiness with 
others, and begging from every passing pilgrim.”’ 
45  
-P-A-G-E-48
< MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  Anasindhu was indignant. ‘‘If the gods wish me to 
live thus, is it for you to protest?’’ he cried. And she, be- 
ing a woman, was silent. But after a little she asked, ‘‘Can 
you not be as useful to the gods and more useful to men in 
town? . Are you always to live in this wretched place? 
What harm to see our fellow creatures, to hear music, to 
eat better food, to see the palaces and temples and splendor 
of the capital? Oh, I would have servants and a golden 
carriage and a palanquin of perfumed wood, and you should 
be the king’s minister, and all should hold you in awe and 
obey you. And you should build great temples and be 
admired.’’ 
“T can not do these things, woman—I who beg and am 
poor.’’ 
‘But you can sell the fruit of immortality for a price.”’ 
The holy one was shocked, yet the woman artfully 
showed how the money could be put, not merely to his 
advantage, but to the welfare of the race and the glory 
of the gods. ‘‘In the first place,’’? she said, ‘‘you have 
nothing to prove that it is an apple of life, and if a spirit 
has merely made you a subject of pleasantry, you will be 
none the better for eating, and none the worse for losing 
it. If it is really a gift of heaven, you will never be happy 
on earth if you continue this joyless life, whereas you may 
glorify the gods if you sell it, and be happy in good works 
so long as you may live, even if you are not chosen the more 
surely for immortality for this service.”’ 
Anasindhu was struck by this pleading, and the end of 
it was that he went to the city and sold the apple to the 
king. But the king also aspired to holiness. He thought 
how selfish it would be in him to monopolize the gifts of the 
gods; he reflected on the charities that the pious hermit 
would doubtless give with the money received for the fruit ; 
he thought of the gain in heaven that would come of re- 
46
-P-A-G-E-49
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  nunciation. ‘‘No,’’ he eried; ‘‘I am not worthy to be 
immortal.’’ In the garden, where he went to meditate, 
he saw his queen. ‘‘Hat,’’ he exclaimed, ‘‘for this is the 
apple of immortality. There is none in the world so worthy 
to live as you, none so beautiful, none of such a bird-like 
voice, none of such gentleness. Eat, and delight the world 
with your beauty forever.’’ 
The queen smiled brilliantly and took the fruit with 
thanks, while the king, after kissing her feet, returned 
to the palace. But when it was dark, and he was asleep, 
the queen crept forth into a shaded place whence presently 
came the sound of kisses. And in the morning the captain 
of the guards walked proudly about the garden with the 
apple in his hand. Yet he was not happy. He looked at the 
fruit with longing, for it was a queen’s gift, but he remem- 
bered also a little serving-maid whom he loved more dearly 
than his queen. ‘‘I will make her a goddess,’’ he mur- 
mured. ‘‘She shall have the apple, and her beauty and 
goodness shall never fade.’’ 
But, lo! on the next day a girl in humble dress fell at 
the king’s feet and offered to him a withering apple. He 
started when he saw it. ‘‘Great ruler,’’ she said, ‘‘I am 
only a servant, but there has come into my hands this apple 
which, being eaten, confers immortality. I am not worthy 
to touch so great a gift. I pray you eat it and become 
as the gods, doing great deeds and worshipped by all 
mankind.’’ 
The king grasped the apple and demanded, ‘‘Who gave 
you this?’’ 
“My betrothed, sive; the captain of your guard.’’ 
The captain was sent for. When he saw what his sweet- 
heart had done he was much afraid, but confessed at last 
that the queen had given the fruit to him. At this the 
king, in a blaze of anger, ordered him to instant execution, 
47
-P-A-G-E-50
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC.   
  and commanded that the queen be burned in the square. 
‘“‘And this is human grandeur!’’ he reflected bitterly. 
““Yesterday I was happy; to-day I am the most miserable 
of men.’’ Then, calling his chief priest, he commanded 
him to give all his riches to the poor, dressed himself in 
his oldest garb, and left his kingdom forever, to sleep at 
the roadside and beg his way through the land. As he left 
the palace, Anashindu came by dressed in silks, and riding 
in a golden litter attended by many servants. The king 
extended the apple to him. ‘‘Take it,’’ he cried, ‘‘for there 
is none other in this kingdom worthy to receive it. Be 
immortal, and, if you can, be happy.’’ 
Anashindu gladly took the fruit and put it at his lips. 
‘“‘There is no doubt,’’ said he, ‘‘that the gods wish me to 
live forever.’’ But as he opened his mouth a jolt of the 
litter caused him to drop the apple, and a dog that was 
running by gulped it at a mouthful. So immortality is 
denied to men, but in the East a dog is wandering from 
hamlet to hamlet, unable to die, and taking little happiness. 
A sombre tradition concerns the Micah Rood apples, 
or bloody hearts, that made their appearance in Franklin, 
Connecticut, but are now widely cultivated in other towns 
and States. They are sweet of flavor, fragrant, hand- 
somely red outside, and while most of the flesh is white, 
there is at the core a red. spot that represents human blood. 
Near the end of the seventeenth century there lived in 
Franklin a farmer named Micah Rood, who was regarded 
by his neighbors as of rather a worthless sort, fond of 
leisure yet fond of money. In the early days of the colony 
trading was done mostly by roving peddlers, and while 
these gentry gained modestly in their dealings with people 
who were of the narrowest means, they sometimes carried 
sums that would excite the cupidity of men less moral than 
the New Englanders. One day a peddler, making the 
48  
-P-A-G-E-51
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
rounds of the settlements, was found dead on the Rood 
farm, with a gash in his head and his pack empty. Rood 
was suspected, and either knowledge of this suspicion or 
the proddings of his conscience forced him into strict seclu- 
sion. If he had robbed the man, he had small good of his 
plunder, for he spent money no more freely than before. 
Indeed, he became neglectful of his farm, and his house 
fell into disrepair. That year the tree beneath which the 
peddler had died did a strange thing: it put forth red 
apples instead of yellow, each with a blood stain at its 
heart, as if in witness against the murderer; and the gossips 
would have it that the decay of the farm and the air of 
misfortune that clouded the life of Micah Rood in his last 
days were the results of his victim’s curse. Rood died 
without revealing his secret, if he had any, but his tree 
lived, and its fruit has been grafted on hundreds of other 
orchards. 
Although there is plenty to prove that St. Dunstan 
pulled the devil’s nose with hot tongs, and so freed himself 
from temptation for all time, the farmers of the south of 
England will have it that the saint, who was brewer as well 
as blacksmith, sold his soul to the fiend on condition that 
his beer would have a better sale than his neighbor’s cider. 
As part of the bargain, all apple-trees were to be frosted 
or blighted on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of May, so these 
dates are watched anxiously by farmers. The 19th is not 
only St. Dunstan’s Day, but brings Frankum’s Night, 
when one Frankum compacted with witches for a specially 
good crop of apples, and got a frost instead, as he deserved. 
The apples of the south of England are famous for the 
quality of cider that they make. The monks of Tavistock 
Abbey had a fine orchard, and the drink they brewed from 
it would turn almost any man into a monk; yet at times f% 
was edgy or sharp, and as mixing it with wine was expen-

    sive, to say nothing of the effect of the blend on heads 
that should be filled with pious thoughts, the abbot 
offered a prize for some process that should make 
rough cider smooth. Ere many days a little old 
man with a limp applied for work, saying that he 
knew all about orchards and cider-presses, and would be 
satisfied not to lodge in the monastery—an empty cask 
would do. The appearance and conduct of the man roused 
the curiosity of Father John, who had the making of the 
cider, and, peeping into the barrel when the ancient was 
napping, he was not half astonished to discover that the 
stranger had one foot shaped like a hoof, while a yard of 
snaky tail was hanging out at the bung-hole. As quickly 
as the good friar could pipe new cider into that sleeping 
apartment he did so, and with a vast spluttering and curs- 
ing the hired man leaped out of the cask, shot into the air, 
and disappeared ; incidentally giving off such quantities of 
hot and sulphurous breath that the cider was almost boiling. 
Father John gave a grunt of satisfaction that he had rid 
the monastery of so dangerous a guest, and when the drink 
was cool he had the hardihood to taste it. His eyebrows 
went up, and his heart, too, for the cider was sweet and 
rich and smooth. So he took his lesson from the devil, 
and thereafter poured the harsher kinds on burning 
sulphur, making it the best of all cider. Devon men call 
fine cider ‘‘matched,’’ because it has been treated with 
brimstone. And that is how it happened.

Old Peboan sat alone in his ragged tepee. His locks

. no game for three days. ‘‘Help, Great Spirit!’’ he cried, 
at last. ‘‘It is I, Peboan, the winter manitou, who calls. 
I am old, and my feet are heavy. There is no food. Must 
I go into the north to find the white bear?’’ He breathed 
on the morsel of fire; it flared for a moment, and it was 
as if a warm wind stirred the deerskin cover of his lodge. 
Peboan crouched over the little flame and waited. He knew 
that the Great Spirit would hear him. Presently, the tepee 
door was lifted and there appeared a handsome girl with 
fawn eyes full of liquid light. Her cheeks were rose; her 
hair, of deepest black, fell over her like a garment; her 
dress was of sweet grass and young leaves. In her arms 
were willow twigs with velvet buds upon them. ‘‘I am 
Segun,’’ she said. 
_ “Come, Segun, and sit by my fire. I have called for 
help from the Great Spirit. What can you do?’’ 
“Tell me what you can do, yourself,’’ answered Segun. 
“‘T am the winter manitou. I was strong when I was 
young. I had only to breathe and the streams would stand 
still, the leaves would fall and the flowers die.’’ 
“T am the summer manitou,’’ the maiden replied. 
‘“Where I breathe the flowers spring. Where I walk, the 
waters follow.’’ 
“‘T shake my hair, and snow falls like the feathers of 
the swan. It spreads as a death-cloth over the earth.’’ 
“T shake my hair, and rain comes, warm and gentle. 
When I call the birds answer. The grass grows thick under 
my feet. My tepee is not close and dark like this. The 
blue lodge is mine—the summer sky. Ah, Peboan, you can 
stay no longer. The Great Spirit has sent me to say that 
your time has come.”’ 
The old man looked up and drew his furs yet tighter 
about him, but his strength went out in the effort. His 
head fell upon his shoulder, and he sank at length upon the 
51

earth. The patter of melting snow began to sound. Segun 
waved her hands over the prostrate manitou, and he grew 
less and less till at last no trace of him was left. His furs 
turned to leaves, his tepee to a tree. Some of the leaves were 
hard with ice, but Segun, stooping, placed them in her hair ; 
then, as they changed color, she put them into the ground 
and breathed on them. At the touch of the warmth they 
freshened and flushed and gave out a delicate perfume. 
“‘The children shall find these,’’ she said, ‘‘and they will 
know that Segun has been here, and that Peboan has gone 
away. This flower is my token that I possess the earth, 
even though there is snow about it. When the rivers run 
the air shall be sweet.’’ And this was the planting of the 
trailing arbutus. 
ARUM 
The arum vies with the skunk cabbage in its eagerness 
to take the air after the long confinement of winter; hence 
it is out of the earth almost before the snow has cleared, 
though it shows less haste in blossoming, for its flowers are 
often delayed till June. When these flowers convert to red 
berries, and the hood that covered them disappears, we 
see why the plant gained the name of ‘‘bloody men’s fin- 
gers.’’ It has many other names, however, such as snake’s 
food (which of course it isn’t), adder’s meat, poison berries, 
Aaron, Aaron’s root, Aaron’s rod, cuckoo pint, cuckoo 
pintle, priest’s pintle, parson in the pulpit, parson and 
clerk, devil’s men and women, cows and calves, calf’s foot, 
starchwort, karup, friar’s cowl, wake robin, wake pintle, 
lords and ladies, passion flower, and Gethsemane. 
Because of the poison in its root, and its curious faculty 
of increasing in temperature while its sheath is expanding, 
the arum was long regarded as a plant to be avoided, 
although it is significant that the evil being who invented 
52

EE Nr mere es on ne, eee 
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  starch, for the torture of his fellow creatures, extracted 
that malefic substance not merely from corn and potatoes, 
but from the arum, thereby deepening its disgrace. 
Two thousand years ago, it was believed that there was 
food in the arum, and that when bears awoke from hibernat- 
ing they were restored to vigor by eating it. When the 
spies of Israel went into the promised land, it was said that 
they carried Aaron’s rod, as a part of their belongings, 
and used it in transporting the bunch of grapes they picked 
at Eschol, since the fruit was so heavy that two men could 
lift it only by attaching it to the staff. When they arrived 
with the grapes they mechanically struck the rod into 
the ground, and the arum grew upon that spot to symbolize 
the abundance they had proved. To this day the plant is 
held to indicate a season’s fertility, and farmers in some 
parts of the world gauge the size of their crops in advance, 
by the size of the spadix of the arum. 
ASH 
The name ‘‘ash’’ was derived from the Norse aska, 
meaning man, for it was from a twig of this tree, crooked 
like an arm, that Odin fashioned the first of our race. 
Achilles used an ashen spear, and Cupid made his arrows 
of the wood. The clubs of early warfare were often of ash, 
for its wood is tough and lasting. Its names of ‘‘husband- 
man’s tree’’ and ‘‘martial ash’’ indicate its importance in 
the industries and arts of battle. Pliny, in his unnatural 
natural history, assures us that evil creatures have a dread 
of it, and that a serpent will cross fire rather than pass over 
its leaves. English mothers would rig little hammocks to ash 
trees where their children might sleep while field work 
was going on, believing the wood and leaves to be a protec- 
tion against dangerous animals and more dangerous spirits.

    A bunch of the leaves guarded any bed from harm, and that 
house which was surrounded by an ash grove was secure in- 
deed. ‘‘May your footfall be by an ash’s root,’’ is an old 
English form of wishing luck. The Germans gave honey 
from the ash to the new-born babe, just as the Scottish 
Highlanders give a drop of its sap to the infant as his 
first food. During Yule-tide festivals the ashen log was 
burned, and the ashen fagot carried the sacred fire from 
the old year to the new. In England the burning of ashen 
logs and fagots at Christmas was the gladdest occasion of 
the year, and the first withe that broke in the fire indicated 
the early marriage of the girl who had chosen it. 
In Seandish legend, the foundation of the world was 
the sacred ash Ygdrasil, which sprang from the void, ran 
through the earth (a disk with a heavenly mountain in the 
centre), and threw its branches into the higher heavens. 
Its leaves were clouds, its fruits the stars. Its three roots 
delved into hell, or Hela’s realm, where, before the creation, 
was no light, no life. At each root gushed a spring—the 
spring of force, the spring of memory, the spring of life. 
Beside the main stem were the wells, that of Mimir in the 
north, from which the ocean flows; and that in the cheery 
south, where the waters of Urdar spread, with swimming 
swans that symbolize the sun and moon. Says the Voluspa: 
‘*An ash I know called Ygdrasil, high and refreshed by 
purest water that comes back in dew, it stands ever green 
over Urdar.’’? Midgard, or the world, was attached half 
way up the trunk and supported by the branches. Outside 
of the habitable land stretched the ocean, and on the earth’s 
extreme rim, lying on the surface of the sea, lay the serpent, 
its tail in its mouth as it encircles the world, symbolizing 
continuity and eternity. Still outside the ocean were moun- 
tains forming a barrier to any adventurous foot that might 
wander so far. On the fruit of the tree, which Iduna, god- 
54
-P-A-G-E-57
    
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    dess of life, threw down to them, the gods lived and in- 
creased in strength, though other forms of the legend say 
that the fruit was not ash-berries, but apples. Three sis- 
ters, or norns, representing the past, present, and future, 
kept the tree flourishing with melted snow from the northern 
hills. 
Other Norse legends are associated with Ygdrasil: 
Odin’s leaving his eye to Mimir as a pledge means only that 
the light of his eye was darkened when the sun sank every 
evening in the sea—when he descended to learn wisdom of 
the dwarf. The life-giving mead that Mimir drank every 
morning was the daybreak. The fourth day of the fourth 
week was Ash Odinsday, or Wodensday. And every year 
the people were taught of Ygdrasil by the priests: how its 
life pervaded all lesser things, making of men who shared 
it the relatives of beasts and even of the trees; how be- 
neath the tree is hid the gialler horn that shall sound over 
the world when comes the twilight of the gods, or day of 
judgment; how on that day Ygdrasil will bow, the sea 
rush foaming over the land, heaven open, and the fire 
spirits leap from below, spreading ruin everywhere. Yet 
after the destruction Ygdrasil shall grow again, larger and 
more beautiful than before, the gods will reassemble, men 
shall live, and the chain of being will be carried higher than 
it has yet reached. 
There is a little tree known as the sorb, roan, rowan, or 
mountain ash, that saved the life of Thor when he was swept 
away by a flood in the Vimur. Feeling himself lifted from 
his feet in the current, he laid hold on the tree, and so 
came into vogue the saying, ‘‘the sorb is Thor’s salvation.’’ 
For a long time after the North was nominally converted, 
it was still the custom for ship-builders to put at least one 
plank of sorb into the hull of every ship, in the belief that 
Thor would look after his own. 
55
-P-A-G-E-58
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    The Scottish Highlanders put a cross of rowan over 
their doors in order to keep their cows in milk, for no witch 
would enter where this cross was placed. To make the 
eattle doubly safe, hoops of rowan were fashioned that 
the cows might be driven through them on the way to stable. 
Good fairies are kind to children who carry rowan berries 
in their pockets, for these berries may at one time have 
been prayer beads, the occurrence of the ash near Druid 
monuments giving rise to a belief that it was sacred in 
more than one faith. 
In Iceland, the tree springs from the graves of innocent 
persons who have been put to death, and lights will shine 
among its branches; yet it is a mischievous thing, for 
whereas Thor’s plank will save a Norwegian ship, it will 
sink one made in Iceland; it will destroy a house, moreover, 
and if buried on the hearth will estrange the friends who 
sit around it. 
The variety of ash called the service tree, which is related 
to the shad bush of this country, has edible berries, and 
yields an intoxicating beverage. As the spirit of this tree 
watches cattle, a Finnish shepherd will sometimes plant a 
stick of it in his pasture, when offering prayers for the 
protection of his stock. 
AVOCADO PEAR 
The avocado, or alligator pear, a soft and rather salve- 
like fruit, used pleasantly in salad, was a favorite food of 
Seriokai when he inhabited the wilds of Guiana, and he 
often rambled about the forests of the Orinoco gathering 
store of it. During one of these excursions the tapir saw 
the woman, fell in love with her, and at last won her heart. 
When the unsuspecting Seriokai went to gather fruit, as 
usual, his wife followed close with a stone ax, for cutting 
56 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    fuel. As the man was descending an avocado tree she 
struck at him so vehemently that his right leg fell from his 
body, and he lay helpless. 
Gathering up the fruit, the woman hurried to the tapir’s 
hiding-place, and the wicked couple went away together. 
Seriokai was found by a neighbor, who stanched his wound 
and took him home, where he was nursed back to health. 
So soon as he could, he mended his leg with a wooden 
stump; then, armed with bow and arrows, he started after 
the runaways. Although their path had long been oblit- 
erated, the Indian traced them through the wilderness by 
the avocado trees: that had sprung from the seed scattered 
by the faithless wife. 
It was a long and weary following. He climbed moun- 
tains and forded rivers, but always there were avocado 
trees stretching away and away, and leading him nearer to 
his revenge. The trees grew smaller, showing that they 
were young. They shrank to saplings. They became mere 
sprouts. At last there were no trees, but only seeds, and 
then footprints. And so, at last, he overtook them. 
The outraged husband sent an arrow through the body 
of the tapir just as the beast bounded off from the edge of 
the world, and, seeing her companion so transfixed, the 
woman leaped also. Hot in his thirst for vengeance, Serio- 
kai followed, and he still hunts the unrepentant ones 
through space. He is Orion, the woman is the Pleiades, and 
the tapir is the Hyades, with bloody eye. 
BALM 
Garden balm, or melissa, cured hypos and heart troubles. 
Paracelsus saw in it the elixir of life. Taken in wine, it 
cured the poison of snakes and of rabid animals. Of faith 
in its medicinal virtue we have a tale from Staffordshire: 
57
-P-A-G-E-60
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    It was the Wandering Jew who was crossing the moors on a 
Whitsun night, suffering from thirst. He knocked at a 
cotter’s door and craved a cup of beer. This the cotter 
gave to him, and the Jew, refreshed, commented on the 
pallor and weakness of the man. ‘‘You are ill?’’ he asked. 
“Yes, past help. It is a consumption will end me pres- 
ently.’ 
“‘Friend, do as I bid you, and by God’s help you shall 
be whole. In the morning put three balm leaves in a pot 
of thy beer and drink as often as you will. On every 
fourth day put fresh leaves into the cup, and in twelve days 
you will be whole.’’ 
The sick man pressed the stranger to stay and break 
bread with him, but the Jew’s doom of unease was upon 
him, and he rushed away into the night. The peasant 
culled the balm, and in twelve days was sound in health 
again; wherefore the memory of the man who has been 
wandering about the earth since the crucifixion is not wholly 
evil. 
BALM OF GILEAD 
It is said that not an ounce of true balm of Gilead leaves 
the Turkish empire, although it was long an article of com- 
merce. Joseph’s brothers were trading in it when an excess 
of the business spirit prompted them to sell him into 
slavery. The tree amyris yields it in three forms: xylobal- 
samum, which is obtained by steeping the new twigs; carpo- 
balsamum, expressed from the fruit; and opobalsamum 
which is extracted from the kernel. The best, however, is 
the balm, or sap, obtained from incisions in the bark. It 
was believed that, so powerful was this substance, if one 
would coat his finger with it he could pass it through fire 
or even set fire to it without suffering. Hence we continue 
to use the phrase, ‘‘There is balm in Gilead,’’ when we 
58

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  would signify that there is healing and comfort for the ill 
and afflicted. In the East the balm sweetened the bath, for 
it was deemed that when the pores of the skin were open, 
they would absorb the perfume and return it to the air. It 
was also a safeguard against plague. 
BASIL 
Basil, or sweet basil (ocymum), bears the name of king 
(from the Greek, basileus), for reasons unknown, unless it 
be that it was once a king over pain. It was a subject of 
almost fantastic differences of opinion between medicine 
men in the old days, some declaring that it was a poison, 
and others a cure. Some hold that the name basil is short- 
ened from basilisk, a fabulous creature that could kill with 
a look. 
In India, where the basil is native, it is a holy herb, dedi- 
cated to Vishnu, whose wife, Lakshmi, it is in disguise. To 
break a sprig of the plant fills him with pain, and he com- 
monly denies the prayers of such as trespass against it; yet 
it is permitted to wear the seeds as a rosary and to remove 
a leaf, for every good Hindu goes to his rest with a basil 
leaf on his breast, which he has only to show at the gate 
of heaven to be admitted. In Persia and Malaysia basil is 
planted on graves while in Egypt women scatter the flowers 
on the resting places of their dead. These faiths and ob- 
servances are out of keeping with the Greek idea that it 
represented hate and misfortune, and they painted poverty, 
in apotheosis, as a ragged woman with a basil at her side. 
In Roumania, the maid who has set her cap for a young 
man will surely win his affection if she can get him to 
accept a sprig of basil from her hand. In Moldavia, too, 
if he so accept it, his wanderings cease from that hour, and 
he is hopelessly hers. In Crete, where it is cultivated as a 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    house plant, it symbolizes ‘‘love washed with tears,’’ but 
in parts of Italy it is a love-token, and goes by the name 
of little-love and kiss-me-Nicholas, a name that of course 
invites the swain when he discovers it in the hand or in the 
hair of his mistress. Voigtlanders hold it to be a test for 
purity, as it withers at the touch of the unchaste. 
Isabella, whose story has been told by Boccaccio, Keats, 
and Hunt, in tale, poem, and picture, was a maid of Mes- 
sina who, left to her own resources by her brothers—they - 
being rich and absorbed in business—found solace in the 
company of Lorenzo, the comely manager of their enter- 
prises. The brothers noted the meetings, but, wishing to 
avoid a scandal, they pretended to have seen nothing. 
Finally they bade Lorenzo to a festival outside of the city, 
and there slew him. They told their sister that Lorenzo 
had been sent on a long journey, but when days, weeks, 
even months, had passed, she could no longer restrain her 
uneasiness, and asked when he would return. ‘‘What do 
you mean?’’ demanded one of the brothers. ‘‘What have 
you in common with such as Lorenzo? Ask for him farther, 
and you shall be answered as you deserve.’’ 
Isabella kept her chamber for that day, a victim to fears 
and doubts; but in her solitude she called on her lover, mak- 
ing piteous moan that he would return. And he did so; 
for when she had fallen asleep, Lorenzo’s ghost appeared, 
pale, blood-drabbled, with garments rent and mouldy, and 
addressed her: ‘‘Isabella, I can never return to you, for 
on the day we saw each other last your brothers slew me.’’ 
After telling where she might find his body, the speaker 
melted into air, and in fright she awoke. Unable to shake 
off the impression of the scene, she fled to the scene of the 
tragedy, and there, in a space of ground recently disturbed, 
she came upon Lorenzo, lying as in sleep, for there was a 
+ preserving virtue in the soil. She was first for moving the 
60
-P-A-G-E-63
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  corpse to holy ground, but this would invite discovery, so 
with a knife she removed the head, and, borrowing ‘‘a great 
and goodly pot,’’ laid it therein, folded in a fair linen cloth, 
and covered it with earth. Some basil of Salerno she then 
planted, and it was her comfort to guard the growing plant 
sprung from her lover’s flesh, and water it with essences 
and orange water, but oftener with tears. Tended so with 
love and care, the plant grew strong and filled the room 
with sweetness. Her home-staying and the pallor of weep- 
ing led the brothers to wonder, and, thinking to cure her 
of a mental malady, they took away the flower. She cried 
unceasingly for its return, and the men, still marvelling, 
spilt it from its tub to find if she had hidden anything 
beneath its root; and in truth she had, for there they 
found the mouldering head which, by its fair and curling 
hair, they recognized as Lorenzo’s. Realizing that the mur- 
der had been discovered, they buried the relic anew, and’ 
fled to Naples. Isabella died of heart-emptiness, still la- 
menting her pot of basil. j 
BEAN 
By what mad inversion of reasoning, defiance of obser- 
vation, or perversion of use came the bean into its ancient 
disrepute? If one reads the records truly, it begat insan- 
ity; it caused nightmare; to dream of it meant trouble; 
even ghosts fled shuddering from the smell of beans. The 
goddess Ceres, in doing good to men, set apart the bean 
as unworthy to be included in her gifts. The oracles would 
not eat it lest their vision be clouded. Hippocrates was 
that kind of physician who taught avoidance of it, lest it 
injure sight. Cicero would none of it, because it corrupted 
the blood and inflamed the passions. The Roman priests 
would not even name it, as a thing unholy. 
61
-P-A-G-E-64
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
lle 
The only tradition concerning the bean relates it to the 
philosopher Pythagoras, who spread among the Egyptians 
the belief that on leaving their bodies certain souls became 
beans. Believing, then, that the bean was half-human, he 
refused to eat it. Being pursued by enemies who required 
his life, because he was reputed to be a magician, he came 
to a bean-field, and, recognizing in the vires only fellow 
souls that he could not trample, he stood still and permitted 
himself to be killed. 
BEECH 
In Tuseulum the hill of Corne was covered with beeches, 
curiously round like evergreens in a topiarian’s garden, 
and dedicated to Diana, to worship whom the people came 
from miles around; and one of these trees was a favorite 
of the orator Passenius Crispus, who read and meditated 
in its shade, embraced it familiarly, and often testified to 
his regard by pouring wine on its roots. It was of beech 
that Jason built the Argo, too—all but its speaking prow— 
and Bacchus quaffed his wine from beechen bowls, possibly 
eut from the purple beech, which shows wine stains in its 
leaves. 
Our Indians occasionally buried their dead in trees 
and under them, that no wild animals might reach the bones, 
and it was to save the body of chief Polan that it was 
hidden under a beech after the battle of Sebago Lake in 
1756. His brothers pried the tree out of the earth till a 
hollow was left below the roots in which they placed the 
dead in panoply of war, his silver cross on his breast, and 
bow and arrows in his hand; then the sapling was straight- 
ened, and it grew to a fine height, feeding on the corpse 
and marking the resting place of the brave with a noble 
monument. 
One of the marriage ceremonies in India is an exchange 
62
-P-A-G-E-65
    
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  between bride and groom of a betel for an areca nut. The 
betel is esteemed for no less than thirty virtues, which pos- 
sibly become implanted in those who chew its leaves indus- | 
triously. Indeed, there should be compensations for this 
employment, and one of them is that it dulls appetite. It 
is said that among the wretchedly poor of India and other 
eastern lands the betel is chewed less to sweeten the breath 
than to allay the bite of hunger. In the belief of the 
Hindus the plant was brought from heaven by Arjoon, who 
stole it from a tree he found there. In memory of this 
performance, the Hindu who desires to plant a betel steals 
the shoot. 
BIRCH 
The birch, praised as lodge and canoe, used as plate, pail, 
basket, and cloak, was also the paper for the books of Numa 
Pompilius, written seven hundred years before Christ, and 
the sybilline leaves bought by Tarquin were of its bark. 
And it must have been highly useful in the past, for it was 
variously a safeguard against lightning, wounds, barren- 
ness, gout, the evil eye, and caterpillars. The fasces of the 
Roman lictors—bundles of rods with battle axes in the 
center—were of birch wood, and its expression of authority 
lingers with us, though the schoolboy, smarting from it, 
found surcease from sorrow in nibbling at the black birch’s 
spicy bark. It is a graceful tree, the birch, though its 
dwarf variety has never regained the stature it enjoyed 
before Christ was beaten by rods of it, for it was stunted, 
then, with shame. 
The Russian still believes the tree a symbol of health, 
because its ‘‘wine,’’ or sap, is a ‘‘cure’’ for consumption, 
its oil a lubricant, its bark a torch, and it is a cleanser, for 
in the sweat baths the defendant is flogged into a perspira- 
tion with birch. In the top of a birch the Virgin disclosed 
63
-P-A-G-E-66
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
herself to the faithful of Buian—a disclosure that folk- 
lore associates with that of the Wild Woman of the Wood, 
who shows herself to a German shepherdess, asking her to 
stop her spinning, and dance. The shepherdess, dazzled 
by the shining white of the stranger’s raiment, and admir- 
ing the beauty which is heightened by a crown of wild flow- 
ers, complies, and the twain dance together gleefully for 
three days, the Wild Woman stepping so lightly that she 
does not bend the grass. Then she fills the girl’s pockets 
with birch leaves that turn to gold as soon as she has reached 
home. In Russia, however, the genius of the forest is 
masculine, and is invoked by cutting down young birches, 
placing them with points inward, in a circle, then standing 
in the inclosure and calling him. When he appears he 
is conducted respectfully to a seat on a stump, facing the 
east; his hand is kissed, and he is implored to grant various 
favors, which he does willingly enough if the petitioner will 
give his soul in return. 
BLACKBERRY 
Blackberries are luxuriant in Cornwall, where John 
Wesley, preaching to the pour people of that county, had to 
subsist largely on the fruit he picked along the roadsides. 
“We ought to be thankful that there are plenty of black- 
berries,’’ he remarked to a brother in the church, ‘‘for 
this is the best county I ever saw for getting a stomach, 
and the worst I ever saw for getting food.’’ It is in that 
quarter one hears the story of the Princess Olwen, fair 
daughter of a dark, sour man, and twin of a dark and 
bitter woman who in nature was her father over again. 
Between the two girls there was no quarrel till the king’s 
son stopped at their door to beg a cup of milk: for it was 
Olwen, the fair, who gave it, while it was dark and jealous

Gertha who had hoped to ensnare him. In order to leave 
the field to Gertha, the father sent Olwen away to be cared 
for by a witch. Of course, the prince went back in a day 
or so for another cup of milk, and was so visibly sad when 
Gertha poured it for him that she hated her good sister 
more than ever. The prince soon learned where Olwen 
had been sent, and went to see her, but was told that she 
had died and that a blackberry, blooming out of season 
across the way, marked her grave. The witch had turned 
the girl into a bush, but released her back to her human 
form when the prince had gone, not realizing that a wizard’s 
wit is as good as a witch’s, and that the prince had an 
adviser at his court who was skilled in white magic. This 
man of science put the prince into the form of a chough, 
that he might fiy to the witch’s hut and see what would 
be happening; and the young man was delighted to meet 
his adored Olwen, released from her bush, and willing, when 
he was a man again, to go with him to the ends of the earth. 
They were making desperate love when they were discov- 
ered by the witch, who ended the meeting by changing the 
girl to a vine, while the prince, as a bird, flew to his palace. 
“Put the form of a bramble on Olwen forever,’’ shouted 
the wicked old parent, when he learned how the prince had 
outwitted him, ‘‘and make her fruit green and black by 
turns, and sour, and the stems thorny.’’ But the court 
wizard, as he disguised his lord for another flight, cautioned 
him, ‘‘To your love, and kiss the bloom, and when the 
berry is sweetest, bring it.’? And when the berry was 
black and shining and full of honey the prince carried it 
to the wizard, who undid the spell of the witch and restored 
Olwen to her own fair form. 
Perhaps because of this brief association with virtue the 
devil hates blackberries, and, having nothing better to do 
when St. Michael had defeated him, he specially cursed

  the plant, so that it never bears fruit till St. Michael’s day 
has passed. A better reason for the devil’s hatred is that 
it furnished the crown of thorns that pressed the brow of 
Christ, and it was also the burning bush in which the Lord 
appeared to Moses. On St. Simon’s day, October 28, the 
fiend stamps around the blackberry patches, and not a berry 
appears after. As if his other feats of villainy were 
not enough, the devil throws his cloak over the bushes and 
withers them whenever and wherever he can, though in 
Treland it is not the arch-rascal, but Phooka, one of his 
imps, that does the mischief. If you have loose teeth, snake 
bites, rheumatism, pop eyes ‘‘that hang out,’’ and a few 
other ailments, eat the leaves as a salad, and you may 
feel better; and if you burn or scald yourself apply the 
leaves, wet with spring water, saying, ‘‘There came three 
angels out of the East. One brought fire and two brought 
frost. Out fire and in frost. In the name of the Father, 
Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.’’ 
BLOOD TREE 
The tree with whose juice the Aztees dyed their cotton 
of a fine dark red, and which their descendants tap to- 
day, has its blood legend: In Amatlan lived a prince whose 
delight it was to deck himself in gold and precious stones. 
He had a corps of bandits in his employ, and whenever 
a merchant went from one town to another, his spies in- 
formed him, and, doffing the raiment of a prince, he rode 
with his company to a defile in the hills or the depth of the 
woods and there awaited his victim, who went on with empty 
saddle-bags and an aching heart. 
When the prince had shared with his troopers, reserving 
the lion’s share for himself, he dismissed his band, all but 
a single slave, with whose help he buried his treasure.

    As the slave bent to place the plunder in the pit, the prince 
slew him, tumbling the corpse into the hollow and covering 
it, with his own hands, for the ghost of a person buried with 
treasure would guard it forever. 
For years the prince pursued his evil course, but the 
reckoning came. After a successful foray he withdrew to 
bury the loot, after his fashion, but this time the slave who 
was to dig the pit turned suddenly upon his master and 
with a blow of a spade clove his skull. He flung the body 
into the cavity, covered it, and carried away the treasure. 
And presently blood trees grew above every pit where dis- 
honest money had been hidden, but the sap of the tree 
that sprang from the grave of the robber prince was the 
deepest red of all. 
BOX 
Box, trimmed in grandfather’s garden to hedges and 
borders, and in older pleasances tortured into shapes of 
animals, decanters, and rolling-pins, has become so rare in 
this country that stout plants which have taken a hundred 
years to grow are valued at a hundred dollars or more. As 
it resembles myrtle or bay, the box was regarded with appre- 
hension by the ancients, for they feared that if it were 
used by mistake for that other tree in the rites of Venus, 
that goddess would revenge herself by destroying their viril- 
ity. Boxwood was a precious stuff, to be carved and inlaid 
with ivory for jewel caskets. Its branches were convenient 
for the Jews, also, when they would celebrate the Feast of 
Tabernacles; and to this practice of symbolizing or conven- 
tionalizing the lodges in the wilderness with a green bough 
may be due that of masking English fireplaces at Whitsun- 
tide with foliage. The Turks plant the tree in cemeteries, 
and in rural England it was till lately the custom to cast 
sprigs of it into the grave at burials.

    BRIONY 
In medieval Atri, Italy, stood an old tower with briony 
striving for a hold on its wall. And this vine tells 
a story that has lived through several centuries. We have 
Longfellow’s version in his ‘‘Bell of Atri.’ It was the 
king’s order, proclaimed through the region by heralds, 
that if any citizen suffered wrong he was to ring the bell 
in the tower and demand justice, and it would be given to 
him. It was not often that the bell rang, for the people 
were disposed to honesty and peace; hence the bell-rope 
frayed with age, and some one tore off a branch of the 
briony and braided it upon the end, leaving it fresh and 
green and covered with leaves. 
There lived in Atri a knight who, from a joyous and 
adventurous youth, had lapsed into a mean and saving age. 
Of the relics of his active days he held to only one—a poor 
old horse outworn in his service. But his daily thought 
was how to save, and at last he said, ‘‘This horse is useless. 
The pennies I squander for hay could as easily go into my 
eash-box. There is plenty of grass. He shall go into the 
roads and live for himself.’’ 
So the equine wreck was whipped into the highway, and 
the stable locked against him. The poor beast shambled 
on till he came to the bell-tower, and there was the rope, 
new mended with briony, the first green, inviting thing he 
had seen in weeks. He laid hold of it in earnest, and his 
tugging caused the bell to rock on its trunnions. The 
people, always curious as to trouble, came pouring out of 
their houses to learn of the matter. Great was their aston- 
ishment when they recognized in the lean old hack, ringing 
for justice, the horse of the miser knight. The magistrate 
of the town, reading a lesson in the incident, commented on 
the pride that went forth on horseback and came back afoot, 
68 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
adding that greatness was not in wealth or titles, but in 
deeds, and deeds of kindness most. On being told what 
his horse had done, the knight was not much disturbed, and 
affected to treat the matter lightly, saying that he could 
do as he liked with his own; yet for shame’s sake he made 
no resistance when the multitude marched back with the 
animal and saw him safely installed in the stable of his 
owner. The people exacted an assurance that he would be 
treated with better humanity in future. 
BROOM 
Planta genista, or broom, has lent its name to the 
Plantagenets since the day when Geoffrey of Anjou thrust 
it into his helmet, as he was going into battle, that his troops 
might see and follow him. As he plucked the badge from 
a steep bank, which its roots had knit together, he cried, 
““This golden plant shall be my cognizance, rooted firmly 
amid rocks, yet upholding what is ready to fall. I will 
maintain it on the field, in the tourney, and in the court 
of justice.’? Another origin is claimed for the heraldic 
use of this yellow flower in Brittany, of which province it 
is the badge. There a prince of the house of Anjou assas- 
sinated his brother and seized his kingdom, but derived no 
comfort from the power and riches that crime had won, 
so that he was fain to leave his castle and make a pilgrim- 
age of repentance to Holy Land. Every night on the 
journey he scourged himself soundly with a brush of 
“‘genets,’’ or genista. Louis XII of France continued the 
use of this token, and his bodyguard of a hundred nobles 
wore the broom-flower on their coats, with the motto, ‘‘God 
exalteth the humble.’’ 
‘When Christ was praying in Gethsemane on the night 
before the tragedy he was disturbed by the sawing and

erackling of a broom plant. It continued its noise till 
those who sought him approached, with Judas at their head, 
when, seeing the array of swords and spears, he said to the 
broom, ‘‘May you always burn with as much noise as you 
are making now.’’ It was the broom and chick-pea, also, 
that by their rustling and snapping so nearly disclosed 
the hiding-place of Mary and Jesus when they had taken 
refuge among them from the soldiers of Herod. Hence the 
plant has reason for the humility which its employment 
for sweeping continues to enforce, and it has additional 
disgrace in that it was a choice of witches who chose to 
ride abroad on it at night. 
BUGLOSS 
Among the plants that thrive in the unlikeliest of places 
is the bugloss, with its furry stems and juiceless-seeming 
leaves. The flowers issue as magenta, but fade to a blue 
of quality that suggests red litmus paper after it has been 
dipped into alkali. It was anciently held to be a plant of 
lies, because the root of one variety, anchusa tinctoria, was 
used to falsify the complexions of fayre ladyes. It pro- 
vided a rouge before carmine had been discovered. In 
common speech the plant is viper’s bugloss, rather than 
bugloss, because its seeds are thought to resemble snake 
heads, that likeness under the doctrine of signatures specify- 
ing it as a cure for the bites of serpents. 
CABBAGE 
It has become generally forgotten that the man in the 
moon was sent there because of his predilection for cab- 
bage. His hankerings for this fragrant vegetable had be- 
come so keen that one evening he could resist them no 
70 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
longer, and, having no cabbages of his own, he filched one 
from his neighbor. Such conduct is not uncommon, but 
this particular evening happened to be the 24th of Decem- 
ber, and he who would steal cabbages on Christmas eve is 
worthy to be translated. He was. Comes a child in white, 
riding, who says, ‘‘Since you will rob on this holy night, 
let you and your basket go to the moon!’’ Whisk! He 
was lifted beyond all temptation, and where all who see may 
offer him as on object lesson to youth. 
But there is another legend concerning the cabbage: 
Lycurgus, prince of Thrace, having destroyed the vines 
in Dionysius’s vineyard, was bound to a vine as punishment, 
and he lamented his lost liberty so earnestly that his tears 
had substance and took root as cabbages, in which is sym- 
bolized the old belief that the cabbage is an enemy of the 
grape and will cure intoxication.. Indeed, the cabbage has 
been held as an enemy of all other plants, because it draws 
to itself the fatness of the earth and starves its neighbors. 
It was so sacred a plant, despite its stupefying properties 
and its smell when cooking or decaying, that the Ionians 
swore their oaths upon it; and fairies travel on the stalks, 
as witches do on broomsticks. 
CACTUS 
The arms of Mexico are an eagle with a serpent in its 
beak, resting on a cactus. When the Aztecs set off on their 
pilgrimage, seeking the land of plenty and security, their 
wise men told them to build where they should find an 
eagle, a snake, anda cactus. Reaching what is called by the 
people of the present Mexico City the plaza of Santo Do- 
mingo, in 1312, they beheld that for which they were seek- 
ing, and there they rested, and built, laying the foundation 
for a finer and greater state than they had dreamed.

Sorcerers in Peru are said to use the thorns of the cactus 
to accomplish the death or injury of people at a distance, 
after the manner known to Voodooists. An image of the 
person to be afflicted is made of rags or clay, and this the 
Peruvian wonder-worker jabs with cactus thorns, mutter- 
ing spells the while. 
The cactus stores water in regions almost waterless, 
hence it is precious to those who are lost in the desert; and 
it also exhibits a glory of bloom that is little appreciated 
by those who live in countries where the wild flowers are of 
gentler aspect. Of the six hundred species, we make use 
of the nopal as a food for cochineal, while others yield fruit, 
fodder, and cordage. It is believed in some parts of the 
South that if a horse rubs against a cactus and is pricked 
by its spines, his white spots will be poisoned, whereas if he 
has no white spots he will not suffer. 
CAMELIA 
This flower is named for Kamel, a Moravian Jesuit, 
who, returning to Spain from the Philippines in 1639, had 
audience with the queen, Maria Theresa, and gave into 
her hands a glossy shrub bearing two flowers of intense 
white. The queen accepted the gift, and immediately dis- 
mantled it of its blooms, for her husband, Ferdinand, was 
pacing the next room in a fit of melancholy, and she wished 
to divert his thoughts. Fortunately, that celebrity was in 
a mood to be pleased, and he ordered the plant to the royal 
greenhouses. 
The camelia is a type of purity, since it is not only of 
the whiteness of snow, but is devoid of odor. Yet the 
younger Dumas has bestowed a sinister meaning on it by 
naming the erring heroine of his famous play Camille, or, 
“*the lady of the camelias.’’

CAMPANULA 
Campanula speculum, also known as bell flower, is held 
to resemble an ancient mirror; hence its name of Venus’ 
looking-glass. Venus, it seems, owned a mirror which had 
the power of adding to the beauty of what was reflected in 
it. She mislaid this treasure, on one occasion, and it was 
found by a shepherd, who, suddenly enraptured of his own 
perfections, stood as a fixture, gloating. Cupid, who was 
seeking the glass, came upon him, and, half in amusement, 
half in vexation that his mother’s treasure should be thus 
handled by a yokel, struck it out of his fingers and left 
him wailing. But the object, being divine, left its impress 
on the sod in a host of flowers—the campanula. 
There is a variety of this flower known as Canterbury 
bells, which takes its name from a resemblance to the bells 
rung by pilgrims while wending toward Canterbury to pray 
at the tomb of Thomas 4 Becket. 
CAMPHOR 
As disclosed in one Japanese legend, the spirit of the 
camphor tree has power over the elements. One of these 
trees, a big and gnarly specimen, stands in the temple 
grove at; Atami. Here once lived a pious hermit, who from 
his place of meditation could look over the water and warn 
the sailors of coming storms, or of those rufflings of the 
surface that indicated the incoming of a school of herring. 
In one of the seasons of scarcity the priest, weary with 
praying and advising, fell asleep and dreamed that the shore 
was heaped with fish. He was about to go to the water and 
give thanks to the sea spirits, when he awoke, terrified by 
a roaring and hissing and the uproll of vast clouds out of 
the sea. A volcano had exploded under the ocean, vapor 
13

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
darkened with dust was rushing for miles into the air, and 
the steam had killed the fish, which lay in heaps along 
the beach. The ground shook, and the people, half-choked 
with steam and gas, were running inland in alarm. There 
was a great lurch in the ground in which the camphor tree 
split from crown to root, and a beautiful figure stepped 
from the trunk, and, holding toward the hermit a branch 
which the earthquake had shaken down, bade him take it, 
wave it three times above the boiling ocean, and in the final 
turn cast it into the water in the name of the goddess 
Kwanon, the lady of mercy. 
The hermit hurried to the shore and in a loud voice 
ealled on the sea to be calm, whereupon the eruption ceased, 
the fish swam safely once more, excepting such as had left 
their bodies to feed the villagers, and there was peace. 
The priests say that the goddess who emerged from the 
camphor tree, as if she were the soul of it, was the goddess 
Kwanon herself. 
CANNA 
Our canna, with its pompous banners of red, is dear 
to the oriental in that its seeds are the beads of the Indian 
rosary. According to the Burman, the canna sprang from 
sacred blood. The diabolic Dewadat, jealous of Buddha’s 
influence and fame, and hearing that he was to undertake 
a journey, climbed upon a hill and awaited the saint’s com- 
ing. He had poised a monstrous boulder at the brink of 
a slope, and when the object of his hate was passing the 
fiend pushed the mass over. The boulder plunged to 
Buddha’s very feet, where it burst into a thousand pieces. 
A single fragment, striking the good man’s toe, drew blood, 
which, as it soaked into the earth, arose again—the canna; 
while the earth, with equal sensibility, opened just under 
the feet of the wretched Dewadat and swallowed him.

    CARNATION 
In our grandparents’ day the carnation was known as 
the pink, because the more popular varieties were pink in 
eolor. In that very fact’ some essayed to read the occasion 
for its later name, for pink is the hue of carne, or flesh; but 
we are also told that carnation is no more than coronation, 
because the spicy-smelling blossom was used for crowns 
and garlands with which the ancients decked themselves. 
The flower was held in affection, too, because cooks had 
learned to use it as a seasoning for dishes, and experts in 
drinking also found that it gave tang to beer and wine. 
The flowers were candied, like rose-leaves, and these con- 
serves ‘‘wonderfully above measure do comfort the heart.’’ 
C= is a popular belief that the plant springs from the 
raves of lovers, hence it has come to be used as a funeral 
ornament’; but it should also be a flower of rejoicing, inas- 
much as it is one of those that appeared on earth for the 
first time when Christ was born. 
The Italian house of Ronsecco displays the carnation in 
its armorial bearings for the reason that it was a parting 
gift of the countess Margharita Ronsecco to her lover, Or- 
lando, when he was hurried from her side on the eve of 
their bridal, to rescue Christ’s tomb from the Saracens. 
A year later a soldier brought her news that Orlando had 
fallen in battle, and he returned the lock of her shining 
hair that Orlando had carried as his talisman, together with 
the withered carnation, which his blood had changed from 
white to red. Margharita discovered that the flower had 
begun to set its seed, and these she planted in memory of 
her beloved. The plant budded, and there was revealed a 
white flower, such as she had given to her knight, but with 
a red centre like none ever before seen in a carnation.

CAROB 
There is a Talmudic legend that finds its counterpart 
in the folk-lore of half the world, the version we best know 
being ‘‘Rip Van Winkle.’’ The Hebraic narrative sets 
forth that the Rabbi Chomi, wandering abroad, came upon 
an old man who was planting a carob by the wayside. 
Chomi laughed at him for his foolishness. ‘‘Do you expect 
to gather fruit from it—you, with your hair of white? It 
takes thirty years for the carob to ripen, and before that 
time you will be gathered to your fathers.’’ 
“It is true, master,’’ replied the old man humbly. ‘‘I 
am not planting for myself. I have eaten carobs that other 
men have planted, so why may not I do the like for other 
men? The sons of my sons will eat of this and thank me.’’ 
Chomi wandered till he was overcome by weariness and 
dropped upon the earth to rest. When he awoke the sun was 
rising, and, grieving for the anxiety he had caused to his 
family by sleeping in the field all night, he arose and began 
to retrace his steps. But his limbs had suddenly grown 
weak and shrunken, his joints were stiff, his head was 
heavy, and his thoughts were slow. After a time he came to 
the spot where he had met the old man, and he started in 
wonder, for instead of a sapling there was a great carob, 
filled with ripened pods. A boy was looking up at it with 
longing, and to him Chomi put the question, ‘‘ Who planted 
this tree?’’ 
“‘My grandfather. He put it here the day before he 
died.”’ 
Chomi turned away and resumed his journey, doubting 
the truth of his senses. Passing his hand over his face, 
in the way people have who have freshly waked, he was 
startled by discovering a long white beard. Arriving at 
his town, he did not know a single face. Yet he knew the 
16
-P-A-G-E-81
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
house of his son when he had reached it, and entered there 
with joy. But the woman nursing an infant in the corner 
was a stranger to him, and the bearded man who turned 
to question him he had never seen before. ‘‘I ask pardon 
for my mistake,’’ the rabbi faltered. ‘‘I took this for my 
—for the house of Chomi’s son.’’ 
“‘Chomi’s son was my father, and both he and Chomi 
have been dead these many years.’’ 
“Dead! My son! Is he, then, dead?’’ 
“Perhaps you knew my father,’’ said the bearded man. 
“Tf so, you are welcome.’’ 
““Yes, I knew Chomi.’’ 
“How could that be?’’ 
“T am Chomi.’’ 
‘‘Chomi? Impossible! It is seventy years since he 
died. He wandered away, and somewhere in the wilder- 
ness he fell prey to beasts.’’ 
“*No, no! I tell you, I am Chomi. I am not dead.’’ 
He grew so weak that he could no longer stand, and 
his grandson—for the bearded man was the son of Chomi’s 
son—supported him to a couch. He lingered there for some 
days, but his heart was heavy and his soul eager for the 
beyond. And so, as the pods were opening on the carob 
tree that had been planted under his eye, he blessed his 
survivors, and passed into the everlasting sleep. 
CEDAR 
When the fragrant cedar was cut for Solomon’s temple 
and cunningly carved by artisans, the trees grew plentifully 
on Lebanon, but they are now disappearing there and 
everywhere because of the ruthlessness of men. As it was 
a tree of good fortune, much of its wood was demanded for 
figures of saints and gods—idols, in common term, The

name, ‘‘life from the dead,’’ that it bore two thousand years 
ago, betokens it an emblem of eternity, but this name may 
have signified no more than that its oil drove insects from 
the tombs. Because of its preservative qualities, the Egypt- 
ians used it for mummy-cases, and it has proven wonder- 
fully lasting, for carved figures of a supposed age of three 
thousand years have been taken from the burial places and 
may be seen in our museums. 
In a Chinese tradition, the king of a country set his evil 
eyes on the wife of a faithful subject, whom he threw into 
prison on a baseless charge, to have him out of the way, 
and there the husband died of grief, while the unhappy 
woman flung herself from a height to escape the hateful 
attentions of the monarch. Even in death the twain were 
divided, by the king’s order, but, a cedar sprang from each 
of the graves, as if to reprove and lament his wickedness, 
and, rising to a vast height, interlaced their roots and 
branches. They were known as ‘‘the trees of the faithful 
loves.’ 
CHAMOMILE 
This humble and rather rank-smelling wayside plant, 
with its innocent, daisy-like flower and finely-cut leaf, is an 
ingredient in a tea wherewith ‘‘granny doctors’’ used to 
afflict the youth of the country, in the attempt to ‘‘break 
up colds’’ and exercise like mercies. It is hardy, doing 
its best on the cold and foggy shores of New Brunswick, 
where its blossoms vie in size and seemliness with those 
of our own whiteweed or daisy. It has a wide range, 
however, and was esteemed in Egypt to the degree of rever- 
ence, for it was sanctified to the gods. Incidentally, it 
cured the ague, and among the Romans it was one of the 
innumerable remedies for snake bites.

CHERRY AND PLUM 
It surprises the stern citizen of the west to learn that 
years are given by the Japanese to such a matter as flower 
arrangement. The art originated in Japan with Buddhism. 
In the fifteenth century Yoshimara disclosed his system, 
which he had developed that he might present his floral 
offerings in a way that would be acceptable to the gods. 
So the Japanese are pilgrims to cherry groves and iris 
gardens, they decorate their houses, they devise special 
flower arrangements for feasts and seasons, and they show 
the stems and leaves as integral in beauty and importance 
with the blossoms. Combinations they seldom use, for 
they believe that the single flower should show its beauties 
to the full. They avoid symmetry, and never crowd flowers 
into masses. 
But it is the orchards in which the Japanese most de- 
light. April, their cherry month, instals the simple pleas- 
ures of the year. The cherry is small and crooked in its 
native hills, but skilful nurserymen have evolved from that 
type the large and gorgeous bouquets on stalks that are 
the gathering-places of festive companies. The newspapers 
announce the probable date of the buds’ opening as gravely 
as an American newspaper announces the opening of a 
social season. On Sunday, when labor leaves its tools, and 
the housewife her home industries, the Japanese throng to 
the parks where the trees are flowering, and there is much 
eating and drinking, much singing and jollity. 
It is the unfolding of the plum blossoms that really 
marks the spring in Japan, and this is a great occasion 
in ‘‘the silver world,’’ as the plum grove near Tokio is 
called. After the plum, ‘‘eldest brother of the hundred 
flowers,’’ and used with pine and bamboo as an emblem 
of long happiness, sheds its petals, and its fragrance be- 
9  
-P-A-G-E-84
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    comes a memory, the brighter cherry makes the wood’s 
edge gay and the nightingale sings among its branches in 
the moon. As the Japanese cherry has no food value, its 
fruit being small, acid, and not abundant, and its bark 
alone having uses in the arts, its perpetuation is due to the 
islanders’ keen sense of color. It was an emperor of the 
fifth century who, sailing on a lake beneath the cherries, 
held forth his saki cup to drink, and some of the pink 
petals fluttered into the wine, crowning his cup as the 
Romans crowned their goblets with roses. So pretty were 
these silken flakes as they swam on the saki, that the em- 
peror kept the practice of taking his wine beneath the trees 
at every season of bloom; hence wine-drinking is now a part 
of the celebration. : 
A later emperor, who praised the cherry in verse, caused 
it to be planted abundantly about his palace and so estab- 
lished it in common favor. And that the regard for its 
beauty is genuine may be inferred from that tablet at the 
Sumadera monastery which bears the warning, ‘‘ Whoever 
cuts a branch from this tree shall lose a finger.’’ The gods 
of the woods resent an injury to their favorite cherries, 
pines, and cedars, and the maid who has been disappointed 
in love seeks her redress by presuming on that fact. If 
she has resigned hope of winning back the recreant lover she 
dresses as if for a conquest, and in the middle of the night 
attaches three lighted candles to her head dress, and a mir- 
ror to her neck. In her left hand she carries a straw 
image which represents the deceiver, in her right a hammer 
and nails; then, in the temple grove she nails the doll to a 
tree and prays the gods to take the traitor’s life, promising 
that as soon as this is done she will draw the nails and 
trouble the tree and the gods no more. For several nights 
she goes to the sacred grove and repeats her prayers, adding 
a nail at each visit, confident that the gods will sacrifice 
80.

a life in a land where lives are so many, to keep their trees,

‘t was to support the cherry at Iyo that one Japanese 
gave his life. He was a soldier who in youth had played 
under its branches, and yearly, when not on service, sat in 
its rain of April blossoms. Time passed, and he attained 
great age; his wife, his children, and all his other relatives 
were dead. All that linked him to the past was the cherry 
tree. One summer it died. In this he seemed to read the 
command of nature to himself. The people planted a 
young and handsome tree close by, and he pretended to be 
glad, but his heart was sore. When winter came, he bowed 
himself under the dry branches and said, ‘‘ Honorable tree, 
consent to bloom once more, for I am about to give my life 
for you.’’ Then, spreading a white cloth on the ground, 
he committed hari-kari, and as his blood soaked into the 
roots and his spirit passed into the sap, his tree burst into 
bloom. And every year it blossoms on his death day, even 
though the ground is white and all other trees are leafless. 
We have no legends of the cherry, except that one was 
eut by the youthful Washington, but the Reverend Mr. 
Weems, who gives this touching and ennobling instance, 
has been, to put it rudely, discounted by the historians. 
We have, however, one historic fact concerning the cherry 
that is worth record, because it affects the comings and go- 
ings of millions in the American metropolis. Broadway 
should not only have been broad, as it is not, but straight, 
and in the original plan it was so; but where Grace Church 
stands was a cherry tree beneath which Hendrick Brevoort, 
tavern-keeper, loved to smoke his pipe on warm evenings. 
‘When map-makers arrived with a street plan which contem- 
plated the extension of Broadway, and the Herr Brevoort 
found that it ran straight across the roots of his cherry 
tree, he went to the officials and swore it was not to be 
6 81

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
thought of; so they, realizing that the city would never 
grow so far as his tavern, obligingly diverted the street, 
and he peacefully smoked his pipe beneath his tree for 
some years longer. The site of the peaceful inn where he 
sold his flip and mulled his ale is one of the busiest spots 
in Gotham to-day, and the multitudes who follow the crook 
of the street westward as they go up-town do not know that 
they are turned out of a straight path by a cherry tree that 
died long, long ago. »_ 
The plum is held by our Pawnees to symbolize plenty, 
but in parts of Europe it is held to be unlucky, because its 
stone is said to inclose the damned soul of a suicide. The 
myrobalan plum, too harsh for food, but used as medicine, 
was no such matter to the Hindu, for the wife of Soma- 
earman struck it thrice with her wand, whereupon she 
ascended as an eagle and alighted on a golden hill in a city 
of gold. Like all stone fruits, the cherry and plum con- 
tain a trifle of prussie acid, most virulent of poisons; 
hence their reputation and effect may be related. 
CHESTNUT 
We in America have done little to keep our chestnut 
in favor by trying to improve its size and quality, but 
in Europe the tree is so well esteemed that venerable speci- 
mens receive all the care that is given to famous oaks and 
elms. One in the grounds of Tortworth Castle is a thou- 
sand years old, and was noted for its size in the eleventh 
century. A group of five chestnuts on Atna, that grew into 
a single tree a hundred years ago, making a trunk seventy 
feet thick, was known as the Tree of a Hundred Horsemen. 
It has been suffered to fall into ruin, but is perpetuated 
in old accounts and engravings. It was on the chestnut that 
Xenophon’s army lived during the retreat, and indications 
82
-P-A-G-E-89
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
of a sacred significance are found in the solemn eating of it 
on St. Simon’s day, and distribution to the poor on the feast 
of St. Martin. 
‘What we know as the horse-chestnut is thought to have 
obtained its name from the likeness to a horse’s hoof in 
the leaf cicatrix; indeed, it may have been in accord with 
the doctrine of signatures that the nuts, crushed as a meal, 
were given to horses for various diseases. The horse- 
chestnut originated, however, in Turkey, where it was 
ereated by a Mahometan saint—Akyazli. This anchorite, 
desiring to roast his meat, thrust a stick into the earth to 
support it over the fire, and such was his sanctity that 
heaven caused the wood to strike into the earth and increase 
to the tree we know. 
CHICORY 
In the meadows about our New England towns, there is 
in summer a pretty show of pink and blue blossoms, shaped 
like those of the dandelion, but growing from scraggy 
plants: the chicory, or succory. Its leaves, when young 
and tender, are pleasant as a salad, but it is somewhat out 
of estimation because it has become a common adulterant 
for coffee. 
The plentiful rays of the flower make it almost inevitable 
that it should have become the subject of a sun legend, 
and we find it in Roumania, where Florilor, ‘‘the lady of 
the flowers’’—a name she enjoyed in virtue of her gentleness 
and surpassing beauty—attracted, first the notice, then the 
admiration of the sun god, who descended from the skies 
to make love to her. Realizing the disparity in their posi- 
tions, and doubting if he meant marriage, Florilor repelled 
him, to his indignation and astonishment. In retaliation 
for the slight, he commanded her to become a flower. She 
took the form of chicory, in which shape she is compelled 
83

not only to observe the sun from dawn to dark, but, as 
in mockery, to wear his likeness. So its old names are sun- 
follower and bride of the sun, and the Germans name it 
the way-light. 
For centuries the plant has been prized as a love potion, 
the seed being secretly administered by the lover to his mis- 
tress to secure her affection. In a German story, a girl 
whose lover had gone away on a voyage devoted her life 
thereafter to sitting at the wayside and looking for him. 
She kept her watch so constantly that she finally took root 
and became the pale blue flower known as the watcher of the 
road. One version of the story attributes the woman’s 
desertion to good cause, and where that idea prevails the 
plant is known as the accursed maid. 
CHRYSANTHEMUM 
In 246 B.C. the throne of China was occupied by a cruel 
monarch, who learned that in the islands off his coast was 
a rare plant that would yield an elixir of life. But only 
the pure in heart could touch it without causing it to lose 
its virtues. Evidently the emperor himself could not do 
the errand, nor could he rely on his court; but a young 
doctor in his employ suggested that three hundred young 
men and three hundred girls should undertake to cross the 
narrow seas and search for the flower. The emperor ap- 
proved the plan, and ere many days the expedition was 
on its way to what is now Japan. Whether they ever 
found the flower we do not know, but the junks never reap- 
peared, and the emperor died. But there is a notion that, 
having landed on the pleasant islands out of his majesty’s 
reach, the physician concerned himself a great deal more 
with furthering flirtations than he did with even so glorious 
a bloom as the chrysanthemum—if he found it. He may

have selfishly extracted its juices for his own advantage. 
It is a part of the legend that he knew when he was well 
off, and that he remained king of the new country, which 
his followers replenished with a stock more moral, able, 
and vigorous than they had left in China. 
But the chrysanthemum is of Chinese origin, and was 
introduced into Japan only a couple of thousand years ago. 
It became the national flower in the fourteenth century 
after a ‘‘war of the chrysanthemums”’ that may be likened 
to the war of the roses, save that, owing to the lack of 
quick-killing devices, it lasted for fifty-six years. The 
kiku, as it is called, symbolizes the sun, and in the orderly 
unfolding of its petals marks perfection, a like symbolism 
being denoted in the erystal balls which the Japanese cut 
so skilfully, as they stand for the orb of the sun, betokened 
on Japan’s flag. The flower is less varied in the Mikado’s 
country than in ours, where new strains are sold for extra- 
ordinary sums, but it grows in beauty and abundance and 
is admired by all classes, the commonalty cheerfully paying 
their two and a half cents a head to see the annual show 
in the Dango-Zaka, or florists’ quarter of Tokio where 
figures shaped of withes and plaster are clothed entirely 
in chrysanthemums, which likewise become figures of 
animals and boats, and are even placed on floral waves 
as foam. This is topary at its most grotesque, though 
the flowers are not cut, but rooted in the straw with which 
the figures are stuffed. Every night the exhibits are 
drenched with water, and in this way the flowers are kept 
for weeks. Flowers are sold cheaply at this great bazar 
and in the gardens whole acres blaze with red, white, and 
yellow. The Japanese have two hundred and fifty varieties 
of chrysanthemum, but other florists are creating new 
strains with bewildering frequency, by the crossing of 
forms and colors, symmetrical and ragged, prim and flam- 
85
-P-A-G-E-94
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    boyant, streaked, spotted, and single-hued, straight and 
curled, a foot wide or an inch. Our catalogues show more 
than five hundred varieties, one of which is green and one 
lavender, the nearest that the flower can approach to blue. 
Extreme oddities are so far removed from nature’s intent 
with the flower that they seldom produce seed; yet many 
thrifty forms of to-day did not exist twenty-five years ago. 
It is said that blossoms are made to show color on one-half 
the disk and white on the other by covering up the latter 
half so that the sun shall not strike it. The plant has been 
urged into bushes twelve feet high, and it has been en- 
couraged to hide close to the earth and put out stars no 
bigger than buttercups. Coming at the ripeness of the 
year, it symbolizes human perfection. Its lasting qualities 
give to it a meaning of longevity which is taken literally in 
Kai, where a certain stream is bordered with these flowers. 
As the petals fall into the water, the people drink of it, 
believing that it will increase their days on earth, and to 
the same end they sometimes place chrysanthemum petals in 
their wine cups. ‘ 
Chrysanthemums grow all over the Mikado’s empire, 
save in Himaji, where it is ill luck to raise them, for this 
reason: In a castle of thirty towers in that city lived a lord 
who employed a servant named Okiku (kiku, chrysanthe- 
mum,) to look after his bronzes, figures of brass, jewels, 
shrines, carvings, crystals, porcelains, and other works of 
art. Among these objects were ten dishes of gold. In 
counting the dishes one morning she discovered that. one 
was missing, and, though innocent of its loss, she so dreaded 
her employer’s anger that she cast herself into a well. Her 
ghost returns nightly to count the golden dishes, and cries 
loudly when it has counted nine, so distressing the populace 
that Okiku’s flower—the spectre plant—is no longer grown 
there.

CINCHONA 
Quinine—known also as Jesuits’ bark, Peruvian bark, 
and cinchona—has been a popular medicine for nearly a 
century. Its virtues were discovered in a singular manner, 
according to the legend: A high wind had thrown some 
cinchona trees into a pool which had been used by certain 
people as a reservoir. They noted the unusual harshness 
of the water, and sought a supply elsewhere. One man 
who had fallen ill of a fever, being consumed with thirst 
and wandering near the tarn where the trees were steeping, 
went face downward at the shore and drank greedily. He 
began to mend of his illness directly, and went about telling 
of the bark that had imparted its virtues to the water. 
Its curative powers being thus made known to the Countess 
of Cinchon, vice-queen of Peru, she caused the bark to 
be powdered and experimented with by the faculty, the 
drug being therefore known originally as ‘‘countess’ pow- 
der,’’ and so introduced to Europe. 
CINNAMON 
The spice which is known as cinnamon is the inner bark 
of the laurus cinnamonum, whose leaves, woven into 
wreaths, decked the temples of Rome, while an oil extracted 
from the wood was used to anoint the sacred vessels and the 
persons of the ‘priests themselves in the Hebrew taber- 
nacles. So greatly was the bark esteemed in Arabia that 
only priests were allowed to collect it, and they were re- 
quired to give the first bundle to the sun god, placing it 
on his altar, where he was expected to light it with a ray 
of fire. As cinnamon most abounded in valleys where 
poisonous serpents were, the men who gathered it were 
forced to wear bandages on their hands and feet to protect

eee 
them against stings, and this fashion of reserving it from 
the touch of naked flesh may have had its part in sustain- 
ing its aristocratic reputation. 
CITRON 
Such popularity as the citron has, among those who 
use it as an addition to their dietary, is due to the Jews, 
who carry it to the synagogue, in the left hand, during the 
Feast of Tabernacles, and eat it as a conserve during that 
observance. It was regarded almost with reverence in the 
Middle Ages, for it was so powerful an antidote for poisons 
that criminals, condemned to die by snake bite, often ate 
freely of citrons and returned from the ordeal in health and 
gayety of spirits, leaving the authorities in sad plight as 
to what to do with them, since, having been bitten by law, 
they were legally dead. In India the citron was carried 
by widows going to immolation in the suttee, and probably 
in that case it symbolized life turned bitter because of the 
death of the mate.   
CLEMATIS 
Our clematis, once called love, for its clinging habit, 
was also traveller’s joy, because it afforded shade for inn 
porches and at roadsides where the wayfarer might refresh 
himself. Wild vine, smoking cane, tombacca, devil’s cut, 
devil’s twine, Bohemian plant, ladies’ bower, virgin’s bower, 
old man’s beard, and beggar’s plant are other and puz- 
zling names. Tombacca and smoking cane indicate the 
use of its stems as filling for pipes and substitutes for 
cigars, as boys occasionally smoke rattan. The gray, in- 
substantial down that floats the seeds to new anchorage 
justifies the comparison with an old man’s beard, and the 
apparently insulting name of beggar’s plant came from the 
practice of pxefessional mendicants abroad, who rub its 
88
-P-A-G-E-97
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    leaves on cuts made for the purpose till they have created 
ulcers of hideous aspect. The plant secretes an irritating 
juice that causes a superficial sore, and where pauperism 
is encouraged by miscellaneous giving, an invented affliction 
of this nature appeals to the charitable as strongly as do 
pretended lameness and assumed blindness. 
CLOVER AND SHAMROCK 
The considerable family of which clover is the type is 
widely distributed and highly useful. Honey is made from 
the clover of our fields, and the deliciously fragrant wild 
clover, that forms bushes six feet high, is a common haunt 
of bumble-bees. The long-headed crimson variety lately 
introduced into the Eastern States makes a field of color 
as brilliant as a flower garden. The leaves, too, are as 
oddly marked as are those of ornamental plants. At the 
quaint cemetery of St. Roch, in New Orleans, you are 
sometimes accosted by children who ask if you will buy 
clovers with Jesus’ blood on them. You pay your nickel 
only to discover, shortly after, that patches of the plant 
with a red, heart-shaped spot on the upper side of the leaf 
are to be found all over the cemetery. Although this is 
called the mark of Jesus’ blood, there is no local or other 
warrant for such a tradition. On the contrary, the old 
people of the French quarter recall the tale they had of 
their parents, to the effect that a girl who died on the 
eve of her marriage was buried here, in old St. Roch, and 
in despair her lover shot himself beside her tomb. His 
blood flowed over the sod, and all the clover that grew there 
afterward had the spot of red on its leaves. 
Clover has long been esteemed a flower of good luck 
when it has four leaves instead of three, and we still use the 
phrase ‘‘in clover’’ to denote good fortune and plenty, 
89
-P-A-G-E-98
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    although that symbol expresses rather the joy of grazing 
animals on being turned loose in a field of it than any super- 
stition as to luck. Those wise in visions tell us that even 
to dream of clover is fortunate. 
The clover which we call wood sorrel was anciently a 
charm against snakes and other poison-dealing creatures; 
and witches, too, would none of it. On going into fights 
soldiers would tie a sprig about their sword-arms, or to the 
handles of their blades, that they might be secure from the 
foul strokes of enemies who had black and secret ways 
of killing. The Arabic word for the trefoil is shamrak, 
and Persia makes it sacred as ‘‘emblematic of the Persian 
Triads.’’ Our wood sorrel is white with faint ruddy or 
purple streaks in the petals. A pink variety appears in 
England earlier than the white, but, as in other flowers, 
the farther north we go, the more of white appears in the 
flower, bluebells being white in Russia, and red campion 
emulating the snow in Arctic lands. Wood sorrel is ‘‘the 
hallelujah’’ in Spain and Italy, because of its blossoming 
when the Hallelujah is sung, after Easter; the Welsh name 
it fairy bells; the Scots call it hearts and gowk’s meat. 
Cuckoo sorrel is a common name for it in the British islands, 
where it appears when the cuckoo begins to sing. 
Among the plants one no longer eats is this same wood 
sorrel, once used as a salad. Sheep or field sorrel, which 
is of a different botanical family, is still used as greens, 
though it is sharp to the untrained palate. 
The acid of wood sorrel (oxalic, from the botanical name 
of the plant, oxalis) is extracted as ‘‘ salt of lemons,”’ a 
chemical in some demand for commercial purposes, but a 
rank poison. Its leaves yield five per cent. of acid. Be- 
eause of their heart shape, the doctrine of signatures pre- 
scribed them as a remedy for heart troubles. The variety 
cultivated in Bolivia as oca has a tuberous root as well 
90 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
prized as the artichoke; another four-leaved variety is 
used on Mexican tables; the Peruvian species, arracha, is 
also eaten, both root and leaf stalk. 
Wood sorrel is held by many to be the original sham- 
rock, as its Persian name implies, although the plant com- 
monly worn as such on the 17th of March, when all the 
world bows to St. Patrick, is Dutch clover. It is a little 
disconcerting that the authorities are not a unit as to what 
shamrock is. The Erse word seamrog is from seamar, three- 
leaved, and og, meaning small. It occurs variously as 
seamrog, seamsog, seamroge, shamrote, shamrocke, shamrug, 
seamar-oge, and chambroch. The plant actually used by St. 
Patrick may have been Dutch clover, or ¢rifoliwm repens, or 
trifolium minus, or wood sorrel. Early references to it in 
Irish literature represent it as a food plant, Campion, in 
his history of the island, printed in 1571, speaking of 
“‘shamrotes, water cresses, and other herbes they feed 
upon.’’ Matthias Lobel, a Flemish botanist, tells of the 
purple and white trefoil, and says of the white variety 
that it is good for fattening cattle, but that it is also ground 
into meal for consumption by the peasantry. Spenser, the 
poet, also relates how, during the wars of Munster, the 
people escaped starvation by feeding on cress and ‘‘sham- 
rokes’’; and Fynes Moryson describes them as devouring 
this herb of sharp taste, the acrid wood sorrel, one may 
fancy, ‘‘which as they run and are chased to and fro, they 
snatch like beasts out of the ditches.’’ If, however, the 
ditches contained water, the plant was probably cress, which 
we still use as a garnish to our meat. 
The religious association of the shamrock, and its adop- 
tion as the emblem of Ireland, is due to an inspiration of 
the pioneer of Christianity in that country: After his land- 
ing St. Patrick found his pagan subjects in deep trouble 
over the Trinity. Preach and argue as he might, he could 
91  
-P-A-G-E-100
oN MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  not prevail on them to accept its possibility till, looking 
down on the earth, in the course of one of his homilies, 
he chanced to spy the little divided leaf of the shamrock. 
It exemplified his point to a nicety. Stooping, he plucked 
it and showed how, though a leaf, it was yet three leaves 
in one. After the Irish accepted Christianity, they used 
the shamrock as their sign, the three leaves typing, in their 
formulary, the national virtues of love, heroism, and wit. 
The leaf was already in general use as a defense against 
witchcraft in St. Patrick’s time, and many a peasant 
plucked a trefoil before he ventured across the moors and 
bogs where banshees cried and fairies stole the souls of way- 
farers. It was the power of the shamrock, indeed, over 
poisonous and maleficent things, that enabled St. Patrick 
to drive the snakes from Ireland, for he had only to hold 
it toward them to see them go scuttling into the sea. 
COLUMBINE 
The pretty flowers of scarlet, red, purple, and white 
that grow on our rocky hillsides and also make a handsome 
show in our gardens, take their name of columbine from 
( the Latin columba, a dove. The scientific name of aquilegia 
Shows that it suggests quite another sort of bird from the 
dove to some observers, for that is derived from aquila, an 
eagle. Its old name of lion’s herb points to a belief that 
it was ‘‘a favorite plant of lions.’’ 
An association has been formed to make this the national 
flower of the United States, as the rose is the flower of 
England and the lily of France, for its common name sug- 
gests Columbus and Columbia, its botanical name associates 
it with the bird of freedom, it can be raised from seed in 
almost any of our gardens, and it is native to nearly all 
of our States.

CORNEL 
The Rome of centuries-to-be having visioned itself in 
splendor before the imagination of Romulus, that founder 
of empire began to set bounds and sites for its defenses, 
and, wishing to advance the walls to the Palatine, he hurled 
his spear from a distance and saw it plunge into the earth 
upon that hill. The handle of the weapon was cornel wood, 
and where it struck the earth it put forth roots and branches 
and so became a great and thrifty thing, foreshadowing 
in its growth the spread and strength of the Roman state. 
It came to be so vehemently regarded by the populace that 
if any one observed it in a drooping condition, as would 
happen now and then in a hot and drouthy season, he set 
up a shout of alarm that brought the citizens hurrying to 
its rescue with pails of water. < 
The Greeks have it that the first cornel (cornus mas-\, 
cula), or Cornelian cherry, sprang from the grave of Poly- 
dorus, who was slain by Polymnestor, and that it dripped © 
blood when Aineas tried to tear its limbs from the trunk. / \ 
CORNFLOWER 
Since the German imperial family’s adoption of the 
centaurea.kyanus, it has gained in popularity on both sides 
of the sea. Queen Louise, of Prussia, flying from Berlin 
before the advance of the first Napoleon, hid in a field of 
grain with her children, and beguiled the tedium by braid- 
ing cornflowers into wreaths for their little heads. The 
blue flower was remembered by one of those children, the 
gruff old Emperor William, who, when he retaliated on 
the French by conquering the third Napoleon, made the 
centaurea his emblem, and it was adopted by his people, 
in whose fields it grows abundantly. Like the poppy, which 
also grows in the grain, the cornflower is thought to have 
93
-P-A-G-E-102
j \ 
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  its origin in the east. Among its names are blue bottle, blue 
cap, blue bonnet, blue bow, bluet, flake flower, bachelor’s 
button, and hurt sickle. In its name it commemorates the 
centaur Chiron who, poisoned by an arrow dipped in the 
blood of the hundred-headed hydra, covered the wound with 
its flowers and so recovered. The hydra legend persists 
vaguely in a belief that if cornflower is burned snakes will 
fly the premises. The qualifying adjective, kyanus, eom- 
memorates a Greek youth who worshipped Flora with ardor 
and was forever gathering flowers for her altars. When 
he died, in a field, with unfinished garlands strewn about 
\vin, the goddess gave-his name to the blossoms, and they 
weré known as the kyanus. 
COTTON 
According to the story of a colored ‘‘auntie,’’ this is 
the beginning of cotton: Many years ago there lived at a 
swamp’s edge a tiny fairy who occupied her time in spin- 
ning, and made the most beautiful and delicate fabrics 
imaginable. Her wheel whirled so fast that it was nothing 
but a blur, such as a fly’s wings make when he is tangled 
in a flower, and her spindle was the sting of a bumble-bee— 
her uncle—who had left it to her, for any good use, in 
amends for a life so grouchy that none of the other creat- 
ures would have anything to do with him, 
Still, one inhabitant of the swamp was worse than the 
bee, and the fairy was as mightily disturbed when she dis- 
covered that he had taken up his abode on the very next 
bush. He was an enormous spider, big as a bird and hide- 
ously gorgeous with red, blue, and yellow. He took some 
pride of himself as a spinner, but when he saw the shining 
tissue that the fairy was weaving, he realized that his own 
art was cheap and poor in comparison, and he was jealous, 
and determined to destroy her. She caught up her wheel 
94
-P-A-G-E-103
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
and spindle and ran, with the spider in pursuit. She asked 
the mouse for shelter, but he was afraid and shut the door; 
she begged the toad to protect her, but he only ran out his 
tongue. Finally a firefly came along, with his lantern lit. 
He saw the fairy; he saw the spider; and, calling on the 
fairy to follow, he fled with her across the field, lighting 
the way, for it was now night. They soon reached a bush 
that bore a handsome pink blossom. ‘‘Jump into the 
flower !’’ commanded the firefly. Still clutching her wheel, 
the fairy put her last strength into a spring and alighted 
in the heart of the blossom. The spider was close upon 
her, but as he put his ugly claw on the lower petal to draw 
himself up after her, she gave him such a stab in the leg 
with her spindle that he lost his hold and fell to the ground. 
In another second the flower closed over the fairy, gather- 
ing its petals so tightly that the spider could not get in. 
He wove his web about it, believing that he would catch her 
when she ventured out in the morning; but when morning 
came, she did not appear. The spider kept watch; but 
finally the petals dropped to the earth, and when he saw 
no fairy he knew it was all up, so he bit his own body, and 
died. But the fairy was not dead. She remained snuggled 
in the little ball that the plant put out behind the blossom, 
and in a few days the ball opened, and all the beautiful 
fabrie she had been spinning while in hiding poured out in 
a tassel of snowy white. And men wove the threads to make 
garments for themselves, and they bless the fairy of the 
cotton plant and are glad when she escapes the weevil as 
well as the spider. 
CROCUS 
The crocus, first gem of the earth in spring, we prize 
for its beauty only; but the little bloom was once valued for 
other reasons. The stigmas of the saffron crocus, the fall 
variety, were a cordial, and the juice of the flower was 
95
-P-A-G-E-104
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. - 
    
esteemed by the women of Rome as a hair-dye, for which 
latter reason it was disapproved by the fathers of the 
Church. Henry VIII. forbade the use of crocus as a dye 
for linen by the Irish, who had formerly employed it for 
this purpose, believing that cloth so cvlored did not require 
to be washed as often as white, and that the stain had 
some sanitary virtue. Until recently, saftron gave a lively 
hue to cakes, and in cookery during the six weeks of Lenten 
fast it kept up the spirits of the public, although the faith 
that it would do so may signify no more than that the 
ancients used it to decorate their banquet-rooms and tables 
and wreathe about their wine-cups, for the effect of banquets 
and wine is to lift the spirits. In Cashmere, saffron was 
long a monopoly of the rajah, but an English traveller, who 
penetrated the country as a pilgrim in the day of Edward 
III., stole a bulb at the risk of his life, concealed it in his 
hollow staff, and so reached his home in Walden, where he 
planted it, and such a harvest of flowers came from that 
single root that the place has been Saffron Walden ever 
since. The plant and its dye were greatly esteemed in 
India, and it is said that when in their wars the rajahs 
saw themselves doomed to defeat they put on their saffron 
robes of state, gathered their unhappy wives about them, 
and submitted to be burned to death. 
The spring crocus was so named by the botanist Theo- 
phrastus, who applied the Greek word kroke, or thread, to 
its stigma, but tradition, old in his day, had it that the 
flower sprang from the warmth of Jove’s body on a bank 
where he had lain with Juno on Mount Ida. Yet another 
legend has it that saffron is that child Krokos who, being 
accidentally killed by a quoit flung from the hand of Mer- 
eury, was dipped into celestial dew and changed into a 
flower, while our spring crocus came from some drops of the 
elixir of life that Medea was preparing for the aged Adson.

    CROWFOOT 
This cheery yellow flower from Illyria has its counter- 
part in the buttercup, or, if you like the old English names 
better, the king’s cup, gold cup, gold knobs, leopard’s foot, 
and cuckoo bud. These ranunculi—the botanical name 
from rana, a frog, shows that they like to grow where frogs 
are plenty—are acrid, and cattle avoid them, as a rule; 
but the crowfoot is alleged by Pliny to have this merit: 
that it stirs the eater into such a gale of laughter that he 
scarce contains himself; in fact, unless he drinks pineapple 
kernels and pepper in date wine, he may guffaw his way 
into the next world in a most unseemly manner. 
With one species of the plant the ancients smeared their 
arrows; to poison them, yet the root of another kind, the 
double crowfoot, or St. Anthony, would cure the plague if 
rubbed on the spot most affected, and was good for lunacy 
if applied to the neck in the wane of the moon, when it 
was in the sign of the bull or the scorpion. 
CROWN IMPERIAL 
The golden cups of the crown imperial, or fritillary, 
are held to resemble a crown when viewed in mass, and 
the commanding aspect of the plant lends color to its 
claim of empire over the lesser creatures of the garden. 
This Persian lily was a queen whose beauty, instead of 
contenting her husband, the king, made him jealous, and 
in a moment of anger and suspicion he drove her from his 
palace. She, conscious of her innocence, wept so constantly 
at this injustice, as she wandered about the fields, that her 
very substance shrunk to the measure of a plant, and at 
last, in mercy, the Divine One rooted her feet where she

had paused and changed her to the crown imperial, still 
bearing in its blossoms somewhat of the dignity and com- 
mand she had worn in her human guise. 
CUCUMBER 
As a phallic emblem, the cucumber symbolized fecundity, 
and of the sixty thousand offspring of Sagara’s wife, in 
the Buddhist legend, the first was a cucumber, whose de- 
scendant climbed to heaven on his own vine. Jews and 
Egyptians revelled in cucumbers, but at the contemplation 
of them, the English owned to a fright, that lasted for cen- 
turies, not daring to taste lest they should ‘‘kill by their 
natural coldness.’’ ‘‘Cool as a eucumber’’ is a common 
saying, and as the fruit is mostly water its malignity has 
been exaggerated, 
CYPRESS 
Cyparissos, a boy much liked by Apollo, was in turn 
attached, not to a god, but to a stalwart playmate—a stag 
that grazed on sacred Ceos. Having killed the animal in 
an accident, he begged the gods to let him mourn forever, 
and, that he might do so comfortably, Apollo changed him 
to a cypress, dark, drooping, distilling tearful dews. Venus 
wreathed twigs of the cypress for her brow when she 
mourned Adonis; the tragic muse, Melpomene, was crowned 
with it; and its wood coffined the Egyptian mummies. 
Still, it was also used for roofing temples, which are for 
the worship of the principle of life, no less than for con- 
solation in death, for it was fragrant and strong and 
lasting. 
A cypress near the tomb of Persian Cyrus had the un- 
happy faculty of leaking blood every Friday—the Ma-

hometan Sabbath—hence it was an object of veneration ; but 
elsewhere it was freely cut and is thought to be the gopher 
wood of which Noah’s ark was made. As its cone shape 
suggested flame to the Oriental, it was planted before 
temples of the fire worshippers in Persia, and Zoroaster 
himself lived in its shadow. Even in Cyprus—so named for 
the tree—it was worshipped as the symbol of a god. Ceres 
plugged the crater of Aitna with it and thus imprisoned 
Vulean at his forges beneath the mountain. The oldest 
tree in Europe is held to be a cypress at Somma, Lombardy, 
one hundred and twenty-one feet high and well grown in 
Cexsar’s day. Napoleon, who spared so little, allowed it to 
remain when he built his road across the Simplon. 
DAHLIA 
Josephine, empress of the French, was born on the 
West Indian island of Martinique, but though this is within 
easy reach of Mexico, the birthplace of the dahlia, she never 
knew the flower till she had gone to France. The Swedish 
botanist, Dahl, had done so much for its cultivation and 
improvement that his name was bestowed on the plant, and 
it bloomed in such splendor at Malmaison, where Josephine 
planted it with her own hands, that she declared it her 
favorite flower. She invited princes and ministers to visit 
Malmaison that they might see it, but she would not allow 
a bloom, a seed, or a root to go out of her possession. A 
Polish prince who possibly would not have lifted his hand 
to pick one of the blossoms had they been free for all comers 
bribed a gardener to steal a hundred of them, paying him a 
louis apiece. After this Josephine petulantly refused to 
cultivate them any longer.

DAISY 
The wee, crimson tippit flower of Burns, and known 
to the English as the daisy, is with us a pot and bedding 
plant, save where it has made an escape from gardens, 
which is not to a large extent as yet. Our own daisy 
is a more glorious creature—the white weed, detested by 
farmers, but beautiful in their fields in June. It is near to 
the chrysanthemum in form and height and leaf, and is so 
plentiful and so lovely that it should have a better con- 
sideration in the discussion respecting the choice of a 
_national flower. 
§ The French and German name of marguerite is per- 
missibly applied to the daisy because that means pearl, 
nd_signifies the delicate whiteness of its petals. It also 
wears that name in honor of one of the six Saints Margaret: 
the daughter of a heathen priest who drove her from his 
home in Antioch when she would not renounce the Christian 
‘aith. The devotee became St. Margaret of the Dragon, 
and her flower appropriately bears her name because in her 
prayers and meditations she always kept her face toward 
heaven. Various Marguerites of history have made the 
daisy their flower also. She of Anjou had her courtiers 
broider it on their cloaks and robes.’ Queen Margaret, 
mother of Henry VII., wore three white daisies. Margaret, 
sister of Francis I., wore it. And it is also claimed as the 
flower of the ‘‘maid Marguerite, meek and mild,’’ of An- 
ioch, whose prayers for women about to become mothers 
saved many lives and enshrined her in their loves. Bellis, 
the botanical term for the old world daisy, comes from 
the Belides, dryads of the mythologic age, one of whom, 
while dancing on the green, was seen by Vertumnus, god of 
spring. That observer, smitten with a sudden passion, 
ran forward to clasp the white and graceful creature in 
100

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    his arms, when, to his grief and wonder, she turned an eye 
of fear and aversion on him, and, through divine aid in the 
transformation, sank to the earth in the form of the little 
daisy. ae 
The daisy has several names in Europe that commend 
themselves for quaintness or poetry. The Welsh call it 
trembling star; the Scottish gowan means the same as bellis; 
the French have christened it the little Easter flower, a atl 
the German name of Easter bowl also allies it to the Norse 
divinity, Ostara, goddess of spring—whence our word Easter. 
Other German names are little goose flower, Mary’s flower, 
a-thousand-charms, meadow pearl, and measure of love. 
The last name comes from the practice of maids who have 
given their hearts, without knowing whether they are to 
get them back again, and who resort to the flower to read 
the fortune of their affection, repeating Marguerite’s for- 
mula, ‘‘He loves me—loves me not,’’ as they pull off petal 
after petal. The last petal and the last phrase determine 
the situation—unless the young man in the case determines ___ 
otherwise. 
DANDELION 
An Algonquin tale of the love of the south wind for 
the dandelion, which is made in likeness of the sun: Shawon- 
dasee, the south wind, heavy, drowsy, lazy, likes to lie in the 
shade of live oaks and magnolias, inhaling the odor of 
blossoms and filling his lungs so full of it that when he 
breathes again you detect the perfume. One day Shawon- 
dasee, gazing over his fields with a sleepy eye, saw at a 
distance a slender girl with yellow hair. He admired her, 
and but for his heaviness he would even have called her 
to his side. Next morning he looked again, and she was 
still there, more beautiful than ever. Every day he looked, 
and his eye sparkled when he saw the maid in the warm 
101
-P-A-G-E-112
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
green prairie. But one morning he rubbed his eyes and 
looked hard a second time, for he did not trust them 
at first: A woman was standing where the maid had been 
at sundown, but what a change! The youth was gone, the 
brightness fled. Instead of a crown of golden glory, here 
was a faded creature wearing a poll of gray. ‘‘Ah,’’ 
sighed Shawondasee, ‘‘my brother, the North Wind, has 
been here in the night. He has put his cruel hand upon 
her head, and whitened it with frost.’? Shawondasee put 
out such a mighty sigh that it reached the spot where the 
girl had stood, and behold! her white hair fell from her 
head, tossed off upon that breath, and she was gone. Others 
like her came, and the earth is glad with them; but in the 
spring Shawondasee sighs unceasingly for the maiden with 
the yellow hair as he first saw her. 
Dandelion is a corruption of dent de lion, or lion’s 
tooth, and the plant is so called because the leaf does not in 
t st resemble a lion’s tooth or any one else’s. As a lion 
was once a symbol of the sun, and as the flower suggests 
that luminary, the association of the plant with the lion is 
more excusable on such a ground than on that of a resem- 
blance between its leaf and teeth. 
DHAK 
The palassa, or parana, or dhak tree of India (butea 
frondosa), sprang from the lightning, and its triple leaf 
is held to typify the thunderbolt, therein resembling the 
rod of the fire-carrier, Mercury. It is employed by the 
people of the east in such ceremonies as the blessing of 
eattle and sheep, to make them rich in milk and wool. 
In some accounts the dhak yields the nectar of the 
Hindu gods, the soma (see soma), which perpetuates life, 
and in the Vedas it grew from a feather dropped by a 
102
-P-A-G-E-113
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    falcon that had stolen soma from the demons who guarded 
it. One of the angry fiends shot an arrow after the bird, 
causing the plume to fall, take root, and yield the fluid for 
which the gods were athirst. It yields red sap and red 
bloom, symbols of the divine fire, and as the falcon was 
sacred, the tree born of its feather became sacred also. 
EBONY 
The heavy black wood of which so many canes and 
‘batons have been made was the subject of an uncanny 
superstition in the time of Sir John Mandeville, that ready 
believer, or awful prevaricator. It was that the wood 
changed to flesh at certain times, and yielded an oil which, 
if it were put away and kept for one year, would change 
into ‘‘good flesh and bone,’’ though of what animal the his- 
torian forgot to tell us. The blackness of ebony has made 
it a frequent figure in our language, as when we speak of 
ebon night and the ebon-hued negro. It was fitting that 
the throne of Pluto, in the nether world, should be carved 
from this timber, and the Pythian Apollo is also said to have 
been shaped from it, as were the statues of many of the 
Egyptian gods. 
an EDELWEISS 
Edelweiss (noble white), a velvet flower, greenish-white, 
and of unobtrusive aspect, is by reason of its modesty over- 
looked, save by thrifty urchins who gather it to sell, and 
travellers, who regard it as the type flower of the Alps. 
In one legend the edelweiss is related to heaven, so near 
to which it grows, for an angel, wearying of her celestial 
home, longs to taste once more the bitterness of earth. She 
receives permission to take her shape of flesh again, but, 
unprepared to mingle with a humanity that even to her 
103  
-P-A-G-E-114
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    sympathetic eyes is enacting a tragedy of poverty, crime, 
oppression, misfortune, and discontent, she chooses a home 
among the highest and wildest of the Swiss mountains, 
where she may look off upon the world, yet be not of it. 
The angel soul of the visitant illumines her face and trans- 
figures her form to marvellous beauty. Having been seen 
by a daring climber, the icy fastness where she hides her 
loveliness is invaded by men eager to behold, and, from 
the joy of beholding, doomed to love her, hopelessly. She 
is kind but cold to all, and, unable to endure the sight of 
so beautiful a presence and be separated from it, her lovers 
join in a prayer to God that as they may not possess her they 
may at least be relieved from the torment of her loveliness. 
The prayer is answered: the angel is taken back to heaven, 
leaving her human heart in the edelweiss, as a memento 
of her earthly residence. 
EGG-PLANT 
As the Arab women use henna juice to redden their palms 
and soles, so the egg-plant is used to blacken the teeth of 
women in Japan, but for a different purpose, for whereas 
the henna stains are regarded as beautiful, the blackened 
teeth are a confessed disfigurement. Tradition says that 
the custom arose from the wish of a handsome young wife 
to eure her husband of a causeless jealousy. The color is 
obtained by dropping peel of egg-plant into water that 
contains a red-hot iron. After applying it to the teeth, 
they are brushed till they shine like metal. The practice 
was continued until the empress appeared in public with 
white teeth, when society in Tokio dutifully followed her 
example. Among the commoners, however, the use of tooth- 
dye is continued to a considerable extent. 
The variety of egg-plant known as the apple of Sodom, 
104
-P-A-G-E-115
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    or Dead Sea fruit, is often pierced by an insect, whose sting 
has the effect of shrivelling it and converting its inside to 
bitter dust. The name of Dead Sea apple, however, is 
applied to a gall nut, like that borne on our oaks, which 
also results from the stings of insects. The true egg-plant 
which bears that name because of its shape, and not for its 
flavor, was anciently believed to be a poison, especially to 
wits, wherefore it had the names of raging apple and mad 
apple. 
ELDER 
Lurking in swampy isles and borders, and hiding un- 
known things in its shadows, the elder came to be regarded 
as having a supernatural consequence: it was possessed of 
a spirit, and none might destroy it without peril to himself. 
Its name associates it with Hulda, or Hilda, mother of 
elves, and the good woman in northern myth. In Denmark 
Hulda lived in the root of an elder, hence the tree was 
appropriately her symbol, and was employed in the cere- 
monies of her worship on the Venusberg. If the forbidden 
wood is used in buildings, the occupant will presently com- 
plain that mysterious hands are pulling his legs. The 
dwarf variety is believed by some to grow only where 
human blood has been shed, and in Welsh its name signifies 
plant-of-the-blood-of-men. 
Yet the elder has its virtues, and on the night of 
January 6 you may cut a branch from it, first having asked 
permission, and spat thrice if no answer comes from the 
wood. With the branch you will mark a magic circle in a 
lonely field, stand at the centre, surrounded with such 
kinds of bloom and berry as you have saved from St. 
John’s night, and, so prepared, you will demand of the 
devil, then abroad, some of his precious fern-seed that gives 
to you the strength of thirty men. Though the evil one is 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
foot-free on that night, he is still under the spell of the 
good Hulda, and when a wand of her wood is directed 
against him he must obey, and the fern-seed will be brought 
by a shadowy somebody, folded in a chalice cloth. 
Incidentally elder wood cures toothache, keeps the house 
from attack, fends off snakes, mosquitoes, and warts, quiets 
nerves, interrupts fits, removes poison from metal vessels, 
keeps worms out of furniture, and guarantees that he who 
cultivates it shall die in his own house. If this cross be 
planted on the grave—as in the Tyrol, where peasants lift 
their hats to the elder—the beatitude of the buried is under- 
stood when it bursts into bloom and leaf; if it fails to 
flower, the relatives may draw their own conclusions. 
ELM 
America claims the elm, though its original is said to 
have come from Italy, where it was often used as a support 
for vines. As it yielded no fruit, the ancients had but 
a small opinion of it, and, like other such trees, they put it 
under protection of the infernal gods and made it a funeral 
emblem, as we afterward made the willow. To our Indians, 
‘it was a demulcent, even a food, and the Iroquois called 
the red or slippery elm ‘‘oohooska,’’ meaning ‘‘it slips.’’ 
In classic legend the elm was a creation of Orpheus, or 
a gift of the gods to him, for when he had returned from 
the vain attempt to release his wife from Hades and be- 
taken himself to his harp for consolation, the listening earth 
took new life, and crowding over it came a grove of elms, 
marching to his song, and forming a green temple in whose 
shade he often pondered, and uttered melody while he re- 
mained on earth. Thus it should be the tree of Orpheus, 
but by some strange perversion it became the tree of Mor- 
pheus, god of sleep, and dreams hovered and roosted in its 
106
-P-A-G-E-117
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    branches, ready, it would seem, to pounce on the unwary 
who stole a nap beneath it and fill him with conceits and 
terrors. In saintly heraldry the ‘‘attribute’’ of Zenobio is 
an elm putting forth fresh leaves, for this holy man restored 
so many from the dead and lived so prayerful a life that 
the people crowded about his body at the funeral, exactly 
as they crowd to-day about the hearse of a beloved rabbi in 
New York, to touch his coffin and obtain healing. In the 
crush the corpse of Zenobio was thrown against a withered 
elm and instantly on this contact the tree put forth a 
crown of leaves, showing that he had brought the tree to 
life as he had raised men and women from the tomb. 
It has been claimed that the lotus, which, being eaten, 
causes the traveller to forget his native land and be content 
forever in the country of the stranger, is no lotus at all, but 
the species of elm known as European nettle, also called 
hackberry and sugarberry. 
Sundry of the famous trees of this country are elms. 
Such was the Penn treaty tree, which stood in a suburb 
of Philadelphia until 1810, marking the spot where the 
only fair agreement was ever made between white men and 
Indians. That under which Washington took command 
of the American army in Cambridge is still standing, de- 
spite the appeals of a street railroad company for more 
track room. 
Our New England green with its border of monumental 
elms, has a likeness and precedent in old England, where 
an elm on a village common was a gathering place for the 
people when they were to debate public matters, or hold 
court for the trial of minor cases. In at least one instance 
it served as a stake for the burning of a poor wretch ‘‘ for 
the profession of the gospel.’’ 
There are not infrequent instances in folk tales of the 
dependence of human lives on those of plants and trees, 
107
-P-A-G-E-118
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
and one such instance has been noted in the superstition 
relative to the great elm of Castle Howth, near Dublin. 
For years this tree received care, its limbs being propped 
or tied when threatened with decay, in the belief that when- 
ever a branch was broken the head of the Howths would die, 
and that when the tree itself should have lived out its life 
the family would become extinct. 
ERYNGO 
The hapless maid Sappho loved a boatman, a stalwart, 
‘handsome fellow, and to compel his love she wore sprigs 
of eryngo, or sea holly, for it was a faith of that age that 
whosoever would conceal this upon him and set his mind 
on the object of his affection would clinch that object to 
him as with bands of steel. But the boatman was of low 
tastes, and when she read odes to him he responded with 
indifference. Sappho could not abide these rebuffs, and 
ended the pain of them by rejecting the eryngo, singing 
her death-song on a cliff, and casting herself into the deep. 
Eryngo was formerly used as a tonic and confection. 
Lord Bacon is authority for it that when taken with am- 
bergris, yolks of eggs, and malmsey, eryngo roots are nour- 
ishing and also strengthen weak backs. According to Plu- 
tarch, if a goat took a sea holly into her mouth, it would not 
only bring her to a standstill, but affect the whole flock, 
so that they would remain like a group of statues, gazing 
into vacancy, till the herdsman, discovering the cause of 
the trouble, violently possessed himself of the herb and so 
broke the spell. 
FERN 
Few ferns have commercial value, though a New Zealand 
variety is used as a food, and the fragrant shield fern, 
yielding an odor that is compared to both primroses and 
108  
-P-A-G-E-119
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
raspberries, is boiled by the Siberian Yakoots as a substitute 
for tea. The commoner brake, or bracken, or eagle fern— 
pteris aquilina—so called from a fancied likeness between 
its frond and an eagle’s wing, and which grows to seven 
feet in British Columbia and fourteen feet in South Amer- 
ica, is believed to be the ‘‘fearn’’ of old England that gave 
to the villages such names as Landisfearn, Fernham, Fern- 
hurst, Farndale, Farnham (fern home), Farnsfield, Farns- 
worth, Fearnall, Fearnow, Farningham, and the like. Rarer 
than this variety is that known in old times as lunary and 
martagon, but in our day as moonwork, rattlesnake fern, 
and (in extreme cases) botrychium lunaria. This would 
have been a most unsafe thing to have growing about one’s 
doorstep, because on putting it into a keyhole, it will open 
a door; it will unlock fetters; it will loosen the shoes from a 
horse’s feet if he but cross a pasture where it grows. In- 
deed, one of its ancient names is unshoe-the-horse. But 
rarest of all is the fern of Tartary called the barometz, 
or Seythian lamb, the root whereof, with its hairy rootlets, 
is likened to a sheep or dog. 
Lucky-hands is the name given by a limited number of 
people to that fern which is called aspidium filiz mas. Its 
unexpanded fronds resemble hands, and fronds as well as 
roots were used to keep off spells of warlocks and witches. 
Glass made from the ash of it had magic properties. Some 
say that the ring of Genghis Khan contained it, for when- 
ever he wore it he could understand the ways of plants and 
the speech of birds. But the really precious part is the 
seed, for the plant flowers only once, and then in the dark. 
If you are abroad on St. John’s night and look closely, 
you may see the dark red blossoms open, but only then, and 
at dawn they have fallen and been wholly absorbed into the 
earth. In the belief that it is good to see them, Russian 
peasants spend that night tramping through dells where 
109
-P-A-G-E-120
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  the pretty plants are found. If the flowers do not appear, 
you may still, possibly, see the fern seed, shining like 
molten gold in the dark, and the seed is most precious of 
things, for if you scatter it, at the same time making a 
wish that the treasures of the earth be revealed, you shall 
see these treasures in a dim, blue light, as if the earth were 
glass. The sap of the flowering fern, when drunk, con- 
fers eternal youth. This seed can be gathered only on 
Christmas, just before the clock strikes midnight; and keep 
your wits about you, for the Devil has the care of it. At 
the appointed time take your stand at a lonely cross road, 
where a corpse has recently been carried, and where un- 
eanny things are flocking, half visible to you. These creat- 
ures will sometimes cuff your ears, or knock off your hat, 
or will try to make you speak or laugh by making myste- 
rious noises in the shrubbery, or by whispering fantastic 
ideas into your head. You must resist all temptation to 
make a sound with your lips, for if you do, either you will 
be changed to stone or torn to pieces. Just go forward 
silently till you find the fern with its seed glowing and 
sparkling, lay a chalice cloth under, lest the devil extend 
his hand to catch it, and collect such of the seed as falls 
before sun-up. When you begin the search you will see 
hideous snakes running over the frozen earth, yet they 
are only guides that lead the way to what you seek, and in 
following them should you become entangled in that fern 
which causes one to lose his way and sense of distance, 
change your shoes, putting that of the left foot on the 
right, and vice versa, and you will regain the road. 
The invocation of the spirit of the plant against magic 
seems to be indicated in a practice among the Syrians of 
printing the form of the lady fern on the hand of a woman 
about to be married. A leaf of this fern, known to them 
as bride’s gloves, is laid on the hand, bound into place,

then the ruddy dye of the henna tree is washed over the 
skin. The back of the hand, covered by the leaf, is Pee 
tected, and the form of it remains as long as the stain. © 
‘Tt is obviously the thin, black, shining stalk that gives 
to the adiantum its name of maiden hair, for the Greek 
adiantos signifies dry, and refers to the hair of Venus, 
which was not bedraggled when she arose from the sea, 
wherefore this fern was anciently Venus’s hair, and also, 
Virgin’s hair, and, for unguessable reasons, was dedicated 
to Pluto and Proserpine, the gods of hell. Was the Greek 
myth carried to England, or how came it that in that 
country the fern was still a plant of mischief? True, the 
male fern averts sorcery and the evil eye, but you must not 
earry a fern, or snakes will chase you till you throw it 
away. All ferns are haunts of the fairies, who in Corn- 
wall are the spirits of such as died in paganism, before 
the coming of Christ, and are punished for lacking the true 
faith by the shortening of stature and the strange life of 
the woods. 
FIG 
The fig, first known, probably, in the east, is relative 
of almost as many useful forms of vegetation as the rose. 
In its family are the famous but now little dreaded upas, 
the nettle, the Indian hemp, the hop, the breadfruit, the 
mulberry, the rubber, and other plants of milky sap. Fig 
wood was used by Egyptians for mummy eases, better wood 
being scarce in their almost treeless country, and roaming 
tribes have pitched their camps in its shade. The * “nit. 
still forms an important part of the diet of these wanderers, | 
especially that of the ever-blooming species, known as the 
syeamore-fig or mulberry fig—to primitive tribes, as sacred 
as the oak to the Druids. Beneath it the nature worshippers 
performed rites, some of which were better unperformed,

for which reason, no doubt, as well as for Judas’s choice 
of it to hang himself upon—he seems to have destroyed 
himself on all the trees in the wood, from the rose-bush to 
the palm—imps have been hiding in it ever since: ‘‘obscene 
monsters,’’ St. Jerome called them. Yet another saint, 
Augustine, to wit, found it no such matter, for when he had 
cast himself, despairing, under a fig tree, unable at the 
moment to believe some statements in the Scriptures, the 
fig spoke to him in a child’s voice, bidding him read anew: 
which he did, and his doubts were solved. It is dangerous 
for some people to sleep under a fig, for they will be waked 
by a spectral nun, who offers a knife and asks how it will 
be taken. If the victim offers to take it by the blade, she 
will pierce his heart with it, but if he grasps it by the 
handle, she is compelled to give him good fortune. Christ 
deepened the fig in disrepute when he cursed it for its bar- 
renness, with the result that it lost its leaves and died. 
Even its wood was worthless, for when they cast it into 
the fire it merely smoldered and would not burn. 
The fig furnished our first parents with what one old 
Bible called ‘‘breeches,’’ and some scholars claimed it as the 
original tree of knowledge, instead of the apple. When 
Mary sought shelter for the infant Jesus from the soldiers 
of Herod, it was a fig that opened its trunk to hide them 
till the pursuers had gone by. And in eastern mythology 
we also find the tree associated with the divine, for Gautama 
dreamed of his approaching empire under that form of fig 
known as the banyan or peepul, ‘‘the sacred tree of many 
feet,’’ and when he had achieved deity he sat beneath it as 
enthroned. Vishnu, too, was born in the cathedral shade of 
the peepul. These trees grow to vast size and vast age, 
the Holy Bo, of Ceylon, grown from a scion of Buddha’s 
tree, being ‘‘the oldest and most venerated idol in the 
world,’’ according to Kipling. The banyan near Surat,

OOCOCC——_—_—_—_—_———_—_ 
India, is held to be three thousand years old, and is never 
touched with steel, lest the god who lives in it be offended. 
One near Patna spread over nine hundred and twenty feet 
and was supported by sixty stems growing downward to 
the earth from its horizontal branches. Another immense 
ficus in the ruins of Padjajarian, Java, ‘‘the Vegetable 
Giant,’’ is visited by many pilgrims, who believe that the 
souls of the dead occupy its branches. 
In classic myth the fig is Lyceus, a Titan, changed to a 
tree by Rhea, while another story ascribes its invention to 
Bacchus. It was growing on the site of Rome when the 
cradle of Romulus and Remus stranded under its branches, 
and was worshipped there, down to the time of the empire, 
the women of the city wearing collars of figs as symbols of 
fecundity in the Bacchic feasts and dances, and the men 
carrying statues of Priapus carved from its wood, in the 
holiday processions. In Rome, when Calchas challenged 
his fellow prophet, Mopsus, to a test of soothsaying, and 
the latter, answering his question, told him, ‘‘Yonder fig 
tree has 9999 fruit’’—which proved to be the case—Cal- 
chas, unable to guess anything of equal importance so 
nearly, hated himself to death. 
FIR 
The fir, which has been a sacred tree ever since it was 
hewn for the ceiling of the Temple at Jerusalem, was Atys 
—he whom Zeus changed to a tree, that he might thus 
appease the anger of Cybele, for Atys, a priest of Cybele, 
had lapsed from virtue: hence his punishment. So strong 
was the regard for the tree in France that when St. Martin 
arrived and began to raze the temple erected to heathen 
gods, his proposition to destroy the firs roused such anger 
that he was forced to desist. Some remains of its heathen

    association linger in the Hartz, where girls dance about it 
in their religious festivals, singing songs that are not Chris- 
tian, and decorating it with lights, flowers, eggs, and gew- 
gaws. In circling about it thus, they prevent the escape 
of an imp concealed among its branches, who must give 
to them whatever is in his keeping or resign hope of going 
free. This is held to be the origin of the Christmas tree, 
and the imp has grown to the benevolent St. Nicholas, 
Santa Claus, or Old Nick, who is believed by Grimm and 
other students of folk-lore to be no other than Odin himself, 
Christianized somewhat out of likeness. When you light 
up the tree on Christmas eve, making sure it is a fir and not 
a pine or spruce or hemlock, for we use all sorts of ever- 
greens in our celebration, you may learn your fate, if you 
have courage to look at your shadow on the wall. If the 
shadow appears without a head, it signifies that you are to 
die within the coming year. If you will cut off a branch 
and lay it across the foot of your bed, it will keep away 
nightmare. A stick of fir, not quite burned through, fends 
off lightning, and a bunch hung at the barn door keeps out 
evil spirits that want to steal the grain. 
In Christmas celebrations in the neighborhood of the 
hill in the Hartz mountains known as the Hubinchenstein, 
cones gathered from the firs growing thereon are silvered 
and used for ornament, and if you ask why, you learn that 
long ago, when a miner fell sick, leaving his wife and chil- 
dren in straits for food and fuel, the wife climbed the 
Hubinchenstein, intending to pick up cones, which she 
might possibly sell for another day’s living. As she en- 
tered the wood, a little old man with a jolly face and long 
white beard emerged from the shadows and pointed to a fir 
tree that he said would yield the best seeds. The woman 
thanked him, and when she reached the tree there was such 
114
-P-A-G-E-125
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    a downfall of cones that she was frightened. The basket 
was extraordinarily heavy, too; indeed, she could barely 
reach her home with it, and the reason for this was soon 
evident, for when she emptied the cones upon the table, 
every one was of silver. 
In the northern countries respect for the fir, as king of 
the forest and home of the wood genius, is so genuine that 
some choppers refuse to cut it, and when a monster fir is 
thrown down by storm in Russia the wood is not sold, but 
is given to the church. 
FLAX 
Hilda, the earth goddess, having taught to mortals the 
art of weaving flax, revisits us twice in the year, emerging 
from her cave near Unterlassen, in the Tyrol, and going 
about to see if the people are still profiting from her in- 
struction. She comes in answer to the summer’s call, 
when the flax is putting out its blue, and her first concern 
is to know if enough has been planted. In winter she looks 
to see if the women have flax enough for spinning on their 
distaffs, or if there are hints of a proper industry in the 
fresh linen of the household. If she fails to find these 
tokens it means that the family is thriftless, lazy, or unfit, 
and she inflicts punishment by blighting the next year’s 
crop. 
Because Hilda is the goddess of plenty, flax, in the re- 
gard of some of the northern people, has become the type of 
life. When a German baby does not thrive they place him 
naked on the grass and scatter flaxseed over him, in the be- 
lief that such of the seed as, falling on the earth, takes 
root and flourishes, will join his fortunes to the plentiful 
life that is everywhere about him; so he must begin to grow 
when the little plants appear.

FLOWERS OF PARNASSUS 
Legend clothes Parnassus with poetry as nature clothes 
it with beauty. Many flowers of our gardens were born 
there, and they come to us bearing not only color and per- 
fume, but history and allegory. This storied hill loomed 
above Delphi, where Apollo spoke through his oracle. It 
towered into a region of snow, but its sides were green 
with olive, myrtle, and laurel; and on a ridge of the moun- 
tain the Thyades held their revels in honor of the vine. 
Here grew the narcissus, translated body of that swain who 
wept himself to death for love of his own image. When 
Adonis died he became the adonium (in one version of the 
story), and the tears that Venus wept for him changed into 
anemones. The adonis autumnalis, also known as May 
flower, pheasant’s eye, and rose-a-ruby, is stained red with 
his blood. Here grew the beech, wherewith victors in the 
games were crowned, till Daphne had become a myrtle, 
when the leaves of that tree were substituted, since Daphne 
was loved of Apollo, god of arts and grace and light. Here 
sprang roses, first white, but changed to red for shame 
and pity when Venus, running toward the dying Adonis, 
was pricked by their thorns. The snowdrop bloomed here, 
but to the Greek it was the magic moly, wherewith Ulysses 
protected himself and his companions from the spells of 
Circe, when they had been wrecked on her island. Those 
who had drunk from the cup she offered became swine, 
but Hermes had provided the hero with a moly root that 
made it safe for him to drink. 
Here grew the elichrysum, an ‘‘everlasting’’ named for 
the nymph Elichrysa, because she had woven it into a 
wreath for Diana; here grew mandragora and enchanter’s 
nightshade, of evil note; the dark hellebore, the fatal hem- 
lock, and the agrimony wherewith Mitkridates countered 
116

  the poison administered by his courtiers; here was the eye- 
bright, or euphrasy, named for the grace, Euphrosyne, 
and restorative of sight to hurt eyes; here the yellow gentian 
and vervain used by Medea in her enchantments; here 
grew the filbert which is the metamorphosed Princess Phyl- 
lis; the fleabane that drove vermin from couches; the gilli- 
flower, called clove for its spiciness, and blooming for men 
in paradise; the mullein or hag taper, a funeral torch and 
gathered by witches for their incantations; and the hawk- 
weed, dedicated to the bird that names it and eats it to 
clear its sight. Juno’s tears (coiz lacryma) bloomed! 
among the trees sacred to the gods who sat on Olympus, 
not far distant. Daphne’s chase by Apollo is recalled by 
the laurel, for she was transfigured into that tree. The 
orchis commemorates the assault of the satyr Orchis on a 
priestess of Bacchus, his death at the hands of the out- 
raged worshippers, and the conversion of his body to this 
flower. Parsley gathered in Parnassus’s shadow wreathed 
the conquerors in the Nemean and Isthmian games, for it 
was chosen by the strenuous Hercules as his first garland; 
yet it decorated graves and biers, and was so commonly 
accepted as a funeral plant that a body of Greek troops 
was once thrown into rout by meeting some mules laden 
with parsley—a certain forecast of ill fortune. With the 
loosestrife, or lysimachia, growing here, king Lysimachus 
found that he could quiet unruly oxen, if he placed it about 
their necks. Here might be plucked the primrose, the flori- 
fied Paralisos, the poppy created by Ceres that she might 
forget grief in the sleep it induced, and the violet where- 
with Diana changed the nymph she would save from the 
embraces of her brother Apollo. To his Delphian temple, 
they carried the rampion, or campanula ranuculus, on 
golden plates, to be eaten as food or used as a funeral decor- 
ation. Here Syrinx, chased by Pan, was rescued from him

by a sudden conversion either into a reed, or the syringa 
that still blooms for Greece; and tansy, bearing its old name 
| of athanasia, recalls Jove’s command to give eternal life to 
Ganymede, his cup-bearer, by causing him to drink of it. 
Thyme, which also covered Mount Hymettus, renewed 
fainting spirits, and symbolized vitality. 
The country hereabout is also favorable to the growth 
of quinces, which were consecrated to Venus and called 
golden apples. It was possibly with this fruit, not with 
apples of real gold, that Hippomenes won his race against 
Atlanta, for she could not forbear to stop and pick them 
up when he threw them to the ground. It was fondness 
for them that induced Hercules to fight the dragon of the 
Hesperides gardens. 
FORGET-ME-NOT 
Not many of the flowers retain their legends in their 
names, but the forget-me-not indicates its own history: 
A young man walking beside the Danube with his sweet- 
heart notes her admiration for some flowers—blue as her 
eyes—that grew on an islet in the stream. He tosses off 
his shoes and hat and coat, kisses her hand laughingly, 
and leaps into the river to pluck them for her, regardless of 
the current, the fangs of rock that lift through the foam, 
the cold of the evening, and the protest of the girl. He 
crosses safely, plucks the morsels of color, and is almost 
at the bank again when he is wrung by a cruel cramp, 
and can no longer hold his way against the whirl and surge 
of the rapid. The roar of the fall, not far below, is in his 
ears; he realizes that his hour is come. Looking into the 
white face of his beloved, he flings his bouquet at her feet 
with his last strength, cries, ‘‘Forget me not!’’ and disap- 
pears. She never does forget him, but wears the flowers 
in her hair till her own death.

The flower was adopted by the fourth Henry of Eng- 
land in his exile, with the motto, or petition, ‘‘Remember 
me.’’? An order of knighthood in the fourteenth century 
wore the flower as a device. In Italy they tell you that it 
is a flower of love, and is the changed form of a pretty 
maid who was drowned. In France, where it likewise 
symbolizes affection, it is sometimes known as ‘‘the eyes 
of our lady.’’ 
An old tradition cites that when Adam—one version 
says, God—named all the plants in Eden, as he supposed, 
he overlooked this plant because it was so small. After- 
ward, as he passed through the groves and gardens, he called 
these names, to find if they were accepted, and every plant 
bowed and whispered its assent. His walk was almost 
over when a small voice at his feet asked, ‘‘By what name 
am I ealled, Adam?’’ and, looking down, he saw the flower 
peeping shyly at him from the shadow. Struck with its 
beauty and his own forgetfulness, he answered, ‘‘As I for- 
got you before, let me name you in a way to show I shall 
remember you again: You shall be forget-me-not.’’ 
A Persian relates how in the world’s morning an angel 
sat weeping at the gates of light, for he had loved a daugh- 
ter of the earth, and so forfeited his place in heaven. He 
had first seen the girl at a river edge, decorating her hair 
with forget-me-nots, and as punishment for losing his heart 
to her he was barred from paradise till the woman had 
planted forget-me-nots in every corner of the world. It was 
a tedious task, but for great love she undertook it, and so 
for years, in all climes and weathers, they wandered over 
the globe together, planting this little flower. When the 
task was ended the couple appeared once more at the gates, 
and behold, they were not closed against them. The woman 
was admitted without death. ‘‘For,’’ said the keepers of 
the way, ‘‘your love is greater than your wish for life; 
119  
-P-A-G-E-130
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  and as he on whom you have bestowed yourself is an angel, 
so love of the heavenly has raised you above corruption. 
Enter, therefore, into the joys of heaven, the greatest of 
which is unselfish love.’’ 
GENTIAN 
This lovely flower has its American analogues in the 
fringed gentian, the inspiration of Bryant’s poem, and the 
closed gentian, with its strange, unopened, bud-like promi- 
nences of intense and glorious blue. Physicians-of-old held_ 
the pli is . i i indi- 
gestions, dog -bites;-stubborn-livers,-weariness, lameness 
‘and other maladies. It bears the name of Gentius, king of 
Illyria, who discovered it to be useful in medicine. 
In Hungary the plant was Sanctus Ladislas Regis 
Herba, in honor of Ladislas, the king, whose reign was 
vexed by a plague. In despair, Ladislas went into the 
fields bearing his bow and arrow, and prayed that when he 
shot at random the Lord would direct the shaft to some 
plant that might be of use in checking the ravages of the 
disease. He shot, and the arrow was found sticking into 
a root of gentian, which he immediately culled, and with 
which wondrous cures were wrought. 
    GERANIUM 
The geranium has many forms, ranging in showiness 
from the much cultivated garden varieties to the humble 
erane’s bill of the shadowed roadside, and in the old world 
common among hedges. It is a splendid thing in the east, 
is our geranium, almost worthy to be called a tree. There 
heaven created it to honor the virtues of the Prophet, for 
when Mahomet washed his shirt one day, he hung it to dry 
120
-P-A-G-E-131
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    on a lavender mallow at the water’s edge. It did not take 
long for the moisture to evaporate, but in that time a 
wondrous change had taken place, for the plant was no 
longer a mallow: it was head high, adorned with flowers 
of brilliant red and exhaling a spicy and piquant odor. 
It had changed into a geranium, the first of all its tribe. 
Of the wild variety common in England and America 
and known as herb Robert, statements conflict as to the 
meaning of the name. Some hold that it was intended to 
commemorate certain concealed virtues of the highwayman 
Robin Hood, but in the belief of others it bears the name 
of a gentler Englishman, Saint Robert, founder of the 
Cistercian order, who was born on the 29th of April, when 
this herb commonly unfolds in the mild air of the old 
country. At all events, it was this saint who used it as a 
eure for Ruprecht’s plague. An easier solution of the 
name is offered by a Scottish botanist, Dr. Macmillan, who 
traces it to the Latin rubor, or red. 
GINSENG. 
Ginseng is in demand by the Chinese, and the plant is 
gathered for export by American rustics, from Vermont to 
the hills of Georgia. The Chinese carry the dry root as an 
amulet, and their name for it is genshen, meaning man’s 
wort. The roots, which affect rocky places, are compelled 
to turn and twist in getting into the ground, that they may 
avoid stones and enter crevices. In appearance it is some- 
what like the mandrake, and as the mandrake is held 
to be shaped like a man, it follows, according to the doc- 
trine of signatures, that appears to be still effective in the 
east, that it is intended for men’s use; hence it is esteemed 
not merely as a prophylactic and demuleent, but as a charm 
against evils. It is good for ills and weaknesses that have 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    been inherited; it refreshes memory, calms passion, and 
begets pleasant dreams. Though the Tatars would shoot 
an arrow at random, saying that where it fell ginseng would 
be found, it is so no longer, for the Chinese have as indus- 
triously rooted the plant out of their dominions as we are 
destroying it to-day, we being a reckless race that seldom 
thinks to sow where it reaps. Our shipments of it aggre- 
gate probably fifty thousand dollars a year, but the individ- 
ual earnings of the gatherers seldom amount to as much 
as they could make in an equal time in the fields. A hunter 
may tramp over wooded hills and undergo wuch hard- 
ship in collecting a dollar’s worth. 
GRASSES, GRAINS AND REEDS 
The most common form of vegetation in all parts of the 
world, a form that is familiar in poetry and art, pervades 
tradition to but a slight extent. It appears as a simile 
in our own and other religious teachings and histories, and 
wherever the Bible is read the sayings will be recalled, 
‘All flesh is grass,’’ ‘‘If God so clothe the grass of the 
field, how much more will he clothe you!’’ Grass-blades 
were once eaten to achieve second-sight and prophecy, and 
sods were thought to be barriers against witches. Sods 
were also given with title deeds as proof of a valid transfer. 
Conquerors exacted grass and water from the enemy in 
token of submission. In some of the wars in India, when 
a tribe was overcome, the fighters would go upon their 
bellies and eat grass from the ground, as an assurance 
that they had become as cattle under the hands of their 
enemies. Indeed, when the Cid surrendered to King Al- 
fonso, he and his fifteen knights knelt and ate grass. The 
Masai hold grass in the hand or tie a wisp of it to the dress 
when they would denote welcome, they throw it over one 
122
-P-A-G-E-133
    
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    whom they wish to bless, and they cast it into rivers as a 
peace-offering to the water spirits, tokening therein an 
appreciation not unlike that of the Romans, who gave 
a crown of it to the captain who should deliver a town 
under siege, the trophy being known as the corona obsidio- 
nalis, or siege crown, and also the corona graminea, or 
grain crown. It was woven of grass that grew in the 
beleaguered camp. 
The Hindus, who speak of kusa grass as the ornament of 
sacrifice, and the purifier, use it in fires of incense on the 
altars of the Hindu trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. As 
Brahma once sat on a tuft of it, and thereby made it holy, 
so the wise and wonderful, who in the east, as elsewhere, 
live to meditate, strew their floors with kusa, and carry 
blades of it for good fortune, as harder-headed people carry 
four-leaved clover. 
Albeit grass is the commonest of weeds, and witch grass 
is one of the worst pests with which the farmer has to con- 
tend, there is only one poisonous variety, namely the 
lollolium temulentum, which is the tare of Scripture, that 
the enemy sows in the night. In a Welsh superstition there 
is danger in tussock grass, because it is occupied by fairies, 
who must be treated with consideration or they may revenge 
themselves. 
Early botanists, who formulated the doctrine of signa- 
tures, observed in the shaking of grass a token that it must 
be usefully employed in human diseases, so the kind known 
as quakers, or shaking grass, became a cure for chills and 
fever. In an English tradition of last century, the grass 
did not merely tremble on the happening of a tragedy; it 
refused to deck the grave of a man unjustly put to death. 
In the churchyard at Montgomery is a bare spot of the 
size and shape of a coffin. It is told that a young farmer 
jneurred the enmity of two prosperous neighbors, who 
123

brought a false accusation and had him arrested for high- 
way robbery. He was convicted and sent to his death— 
for in those times robbery was a hanging matter. Before 
the execution he said, ‘‘If I am innocent of the crime for 
which I suffer, the grass, for one generation at least, will 
not cover my grave.’’ So soon as the bell began to toll 
for the hanging, the sky darkened, and as Davies put his 
foot on the scaffold there was a glare of lightning and an 
appalling roar of thunder that struck terror to his accusers, 
and the multitude that had assembled to see the killing 
fled, erying that the end of things had come. In 1852, 
thirty years after the hanging, a village clergyman in Mont- 
gomery wrote that the grass had not yet covered the grave, 
and that, although attempts had been made to induce a 
growth, it always died, leaving the soil cold and bare, as if 
burned off by lightning. 
The rush, or reed, came into existence when the burly, 
jealous Cyclopes, Polyphemus, found Galatea in the arms 
of the shepherd Acis, whom she loved. Polyphemus crushed 
his rival with a stone, and Galatea, unwilling to leave him 
in his gory state, yet unable to restore his life, caused the 
blood of the shepherd to change to water and flow forever. 
When it had completely lost its color a form like that 
of the dead youth appeared waist deep in the stream, and 
while the weeping nymph looked on the arms began to 
lengthen, the shoulders to sprout green blades, and pres- 
ently the brook was edged with a growth of rushes. 
The reed or rush, long associated with kingship, seems 
to have represented the royal sceptre. We learn that 
Moses’s cradle anchored among rushes that beaconed above 
his head, as pointing the way to high station among his 
people. We see the reed placed in the helpless hands of 
Christ as he is mocked before his death. It is reported 
that William the Conqueror fell on the floor at his birth.

It was then the fashion, and for long after, to strew halls 
and churches with rushes, to relieve their bareness and 
collect dirt, it being easy to change them for cleaner. The 
little William, rolling among these rushes, grasped a num- 
ber of them in his tiny hands, whereupon all the bystanders 
who had been invited to witness the function, broke into a 
cheer, for this was promise of kingship. 
When Isis set sail to recover the body of Osiris she wove 
her boat of papyrus, and the crocodiles respected it, allow- 
ing it to proceed along the Nile in peace. It was of this 
great water-grass also that the basket boat of the little 
Moses was made, when he was committed to the river, and 
boats of the same grass have been made in our day, though 
its more important use is the making of paper, sheets of 
which made from papyrus two thousand years ago are still 
in existence. 
Bamboo represents shelter and friendship, in Indian 
symbolism. Though its flowers irritate delicate noses, pro- 
ducing something like hay-fever, its huge stems are used 
for houses, corrals, fences, furniture, and furnishings, 
and we are told how Chinese not rich enough to own a 
garden make a raft of bamboo which they cover with earth, 
and so raise vegetables on lakes and rivers. 
Our Indians of the southwest relate the preservation 
of man and the brutes through the deluge to the canebrake: 
When the earth was about to be overwhelmed, the red Noah 
called his family and the representative animals to enter 
the hollow of a monster cane-stalk with him, and, closing 
the break, they mounted higher and higher into its wood 
as the waters spread and deepened. Now and then the 
big rush threatened to break in the sway of the storm, 
but by repeatedly strengthening it with scarfs of cloud 
they kept it fast. At last the flood had reached its height, 
and, crawling up on the side of the cane, the preserver of

    the race reached its tip, and, pulling off the feather he 
wore in his hair, he swept it against the sky, in memory of 
which act the canes have worn feathers ever since. 
In the cosmogony of Japan it was a bulrush, budded 
at its tip and piercing the misty heaven from the misty 
earth, that carried the seed of life into the infinite. The 
bud opened and from it came four pairs of heavenly be- 
ings, the last couple, Izanagi and Izanami, god of the air 
and goddess of the clouds, undertaking the creation of the 
earth. They first cast rice grains abroad, to dispel the 
darkness that prevailed; then the air god let down his 
spear and stirred the sea, which began to eddy, turning 
faster and faster till by its speed it had brought up land 
from the bottom and thrown it out at the feet of the gods. 
When this earth had dried a little, the rice had root-hold, 
and so the means of supporting animal life was provided, 
while the spear remained where Izanagi had thrust it and 
became the centre of the earth, around which all things 
turn. Then the gods begat the sun goddess, who in turn 
begat all the flowers that lend beauty to this whirling 
sphere. 
This rice-straw figures curiously in one of the Japanese 
legends, for it is because the straw held firm that Japan has 
a summer: Amaterasu, goddess of day, had fled, discon- 
tented, to a cave, to escape the persecutions of her jealous 
brother of the dark—he known as Susano, the moon god. 
So long as she hid her lignt, there could be no warmth, no 
vegetation, not even any water, for in the chill did not 
the springs freeze fast? A conspiracy was planned among 
the earth dwellers to lure her from retirement. Bight hun- 
dred girls were assembled before the cave and told to laugh 
their heartiest. Amaterasu, startled from her melancholy, 
stepped into the air for a moment, and so soon as she was 
at a little distance from the grotto and the world was filled

    with light again, they held a mirror to her face and bade 
her look at her new rival. Never before having seen her 
own countenance, the goddess stood admiring it long enough 
for the plotters to close the cavern’s mouth with a stout rope 
of rice straw. Finding the way into the earth barred, real- 
izing, too, how prettily she had been tricked, the sun 
goddess laughingly confessed the cleverness of the earth 
people, and mounted again to her place in the sky. Then, 
as if to amend for the suffering she had caused by with- 
drawing light and warmth from her worshippers, she sent 
her grandson, Prince Plenty, the Rice Prince, to live among 
them, granting into his keeping the magic mirror, from 
which all Japanese mirrors have been designed for cen- 
turies, and which indicate the sun in their round and shin- 
ing shape. This Rice Prince lost hold on the heavenly 
life by coming to our planet; he was the son of gods, made 
man, and he devoted his life to the teaching and guidance 
of the human race. Although generations of kings come 
and go in other lands, the Prince’s line has continued un- 
broken, the oldest royal family in the world; for the Rice 
Prince is ancestor of all the mikados who have ruled Japan. 
Japanese farmers who have not been reached by the mis- 
sionaries still pray to the god of rice for plenteous harvest, 
and hold the grain as a symbol of generation as well as 
of abundance—a symbol that has extended to other lands, 
for even in our own country bridal couples are showered 
with rice when they set off on their wedding journey. 
In India the Brahmins throw the rice over the shoulders of 
the couple after they have mixed it with saffron, and when 
the children arrive the little fellows are taken into an apart- 
ment where the father empties a quantity of red rice over 
their scalps, to keep off the evil eye. 
Long ago the priests of Japan lived on roots and plants, 
but while meditating on the ineffable, one of the brother-

  hood found his thoughts drawn to earth by the behavior of 
a mouse that was skurrying to and fro, carrying something 
to its nest. The priest set a trap, caught the little creature, 
and, having tied a thread to its leg, followed it as it seuttled 
across the hills and into a watery country he had never 
seen before, where wild rice grew plentifully. This the 
priest found so good that he sent for his people to cultivate 
it, and when it had become the food of the nation the mouse 
entered into the respect of the public to that degree that 
you shall find him in bronze, paint, ivory, and porcelain, 
for he, too, is sacred. The Arabs do not admit this: they 
claim the first rice grains to have been drops of sweat 
from the brow of Mahomet. 
The other nations have their lore of grain, which in the 
north was under protection of Hulda, or Bertha, benevolent 
earth mother. In her anxiety that her fields should have 
a plentiful crop of seed, she protected them against damag- 
ing visitors by stationing were-wolves at the boundaries. 
Loki, the mischievous fire god, would sometimes steal past 
the wolves and sow his wild oats; and when heat shimmers 
over his farm the Jutlander says, ‘‘Loki is sowing his wild 
oats.’? Two weeds still carry his name, in the north: the 
polytrichium commune, which are Loki’s oats, and the yel- 
low rattle, or rhinanthus, which is Loki’s purse. For some 
reason rye-fields at that time were affected by devils, of 
whom the peasantry were so afraid that when they reaped 
the harvest they left the last sheaf for these imps to quarrel 
over while they hurried the rest of the crop into the barn. 
But demons never quarrelled over the bed straw, galeum 
verum luteum, because it was too holy for their touch: it 
filled the manger where the child Jesus lay ; hence it became 
a custom to strew such of it as had been used in the Christ- 
mas festivities over the fields, to bless them and increase 
the harvest; also to spread it in the stalls as a litter for

  cattle, to keep them from disease, and lastly, to heap it on 
the floor as a bed for the whole family on Christmas night. 
‘When the Spanish adventurer Cortez came to this west- 
ern world, he was more concerned for gold than he was for 
grain, yet he became the unwitting agent in the begetting 
of more wealth for us than he could ever have taken away, 
had he lived till now: for it was from a few kernels of 
grain, brought by one of his party through sheer oversight, 
and shaken upon the earth of Mexico, that the crops of this 
country are alleged to grow. So largely is our wealth a 
matter of wheat, rye, oats, and barley, that if we were a 
more imaginative people, we should be justified in a revival 
of the ancient festivals, held at harvest time, in honor of the 
goddess of grain, who in her various names and aspects is 
Ceres, Rhea, Hera, Demeter, Cybele, Tellus, and Isis. 
Proserpine, passing six months on earth and six in 
Hades, types the plant that sleeps in winter and flourishes 
in summer, and this tale of the nymph who is spirited away 
to lightless depths to emerge again for a season has its 
eomplete or partial likeness among primitive peoples, east 
and west; in fact, a survival of the ancient rites of Greece 
is found in India, where the bride is crowned with corn 
as a symbol of fertility. Grain was Egypt’s wealth, and 
in many tongues we read the parable of the man who bade 
his son search diligently, for there was buried treasure in 
his field. The son plowed and dug for years, and discov- 
ered no buried coin, but his plowing resulted in splendid 
crops, and from these he earned much money, so that he 
was content; and when he had become so, and had earned 
the right to rest, he understood that the treasure was the 
earth’s fatness, and that in increasing its yield of yellow 
grain he had lived more happily and usefully than if he 
had uncovered gold. 
It has been claimed for millet that if eaten on New Year

day it will make the eater rich, and this despite the poverty 
of many whose diet is millet, mostly. The unaccountable 
wanderings and shiftings of these fancies, as we deem them, 
but of symbols and figures as they often are, discover con- 
nections in beliefs that appear widely unrelated at first 
glance. For instance, this belief in New Year luck relates 
millet to an earlier faith among the Germans that it was 
the food of the great storm dragon, and also to the fancy 
that grain took its color from gold. For when the thunder 
beast, from his hiding in the clouds, dropped red lightning, 
it signified that gold had fallen on the earth where the bolt 
had struck, whereas if he spat blue fire it meant that he 
had sown millet for his own eating. Hence gold and millet, 
being made by the same power and process, were in a meas- 
ure transmutable. In Persia, the myth takes a different 
form, yet is recognizable as a relative, for there the dragon 
is still an inhabitant of the sky, and is a more pleasing 
object than the lightning: he is the rainbow. And instead 
of throwing gold to the earth, he drops it gently, so that 
you shall find treasure where the end of his body rests upon 
the ground. 
No amative significance attaches to grain in America, 
but there is a custom in New England of pairing young 
men and women at the corn huskings, when neighbors aid 
one another to strip the ears of maize, and this carries with 
it the privilege of a swain to kiss the girl beside him if he 
finds an ear with red kernels. In old England the last ear 
of grain in harvest is cut by the prettiest girl, who permits 
no such consolation to her admirers. 
/ There is one grain known to every city child: the se- 
/same; for was it not by that magic name that Ali Baba 
/ opened the cave of the forty thieves? The sesame, or se- 
_samum, is described as an oily pulse that is sown before

    of death, whence the orientals use it in services of repent- 
ance, expiation, or purification. Sesame is mixed with rice 
and honey in the cakes offered to the dead, and ‘‘the offer- 
ing of the six sesames’’ being duly made, at six different 
times, the giver believes that the departed has received 
his admission to heaven. When an Hindu funeral is over 
and the body is burned, the friends leave half a pound or so 
of sesame on the bank of the river where the burning has 
occurred, and on which the ashes are drifting, that the 
dead may feed on it and gather strength for the long 
journey into the hereafter. 
HAWTHORN 
While Christ was resting in a wood during the pursuit 
prior to his crucifixion, the magpies covered him with haw- 
thorn, which the swallows, ‘‘fowls of God,’’? removed as 
soon as his enemies had passed. From this circumstance 
the plant gained holiness, and in the chapter on Christian 
legends may be read how Joseph of Arimathea planted the 
white thorn of Glastonbury, which, to prove its saintly asso- 
ciation, flowers on Christmas eve, no matter what the 
weather. A kindred instance is recorded in the life of 
Charlemagne, when he Imelt before the crown of thorns, 
which is alleged to have been fashioned from the hawthorn. 
The wood, dry for centuries, burst into bloom and the air 
was filled with a wondrous fragrance. 
After thousands of Calvinists had been put to death dur- 
ing the St. Bartholomew’s massacre, the wearied slayers, 
surfeited with slaughter, were fain to allow the survivors to 
escape. But the priests spurned the flagging spirits of the 
people by declaring that heaven applauded the stamping 
out of heresy, and had proved it by kindling into new life 
the hawthorn bush in the cemetery of the Holy Innocents,

“‘as if it had drunk the blood of heretics and gained new 
strength from it.’’ So the populace marched to the grave- 
yard, where, true enough, the hawthorn, or ‘‘holy thorn,’’ 
had put forth a wondrous mass of bloom; and, seeing it, 
the men who had done what they truly believed to be the 
will of heaven, fell on their knees and worshipped the inno- 
cent flowers of the ‘‘albespyne.’’ 
At Bosworth field the crown of Richard III. was hid in 
a hawthorn, and, being recovered after the death of that 
misshapen monarch, was placed on the head of Richmond, 
who thereon took as his device a crown in a hawthorn. 
HAZEL 
Moncure D. Conway associates the name of hazel with 
the Syrian hazeh, meaning hazy, since mysteries associated 
with the ancient religions were of that effect on beholders 
and participants. He also believes that our word hazing 
is derived from the same root, that being a process of induc- 
tion into the mysteries of study, the excesses of which 
were best corrected with the hazel rod of the schoolmaster. 
The hazel, too, was a tree of Thor, and protected buildings 
and graves against lightning. It took on sanctity because 
the holy family was sheltered by a hazel in the flight to 
Egypt. It is used as a means of securing crops, warding 
off lightning, curing fever, and driving devils out of 
cattle. It takes only three hazel pins to preserve a house 
from fire, if they are driven into its beams; also, a hazel cut 
at twelve o’clock on Walpurgis night and carried in the 
pocket will prevent the one who carries it from tumbling 
into holes, though never so drunk. If you cut it on Good 
Friday or St. John’s eve, you can lash your enemy with 
it in your own apartments, and without seeing him. Merely 
name him and lay stoutly about you, and your foe will

dance and bellow, no matter if he is a thousand miles 
away. 
The hazel is the caduceus of Mercury, which roused in 
All who were touched by it love of kin, country, and the 
| gods; and, as everybody knows in our time, it is the divining 
rod, cut in a Y from a dividing branch, one handle held in 
the right hand, the other in the left, its point toward the 
ground, and so held it is to indicate hidden springs, or 
gold and silver. It is told that Linnaeus, having no belief 
in these tales, hid a purse of a hundred ducats under a 
ranunculus, and bade a fellow find it with a hazel wand, 
if he could. An unasked company, hearing of money in 
the ground, tore up the pasture and destroyed the ranun- ° 
culus and other plants, so that the owner of the ducats could 
no longer tell where he had hidden his wealth; but the man 
with the hazel, disregarding all guesses and advice, pres- 
ently marked the spot where, sure enough, the coin was 
hidden, and from which it was safely removed. Another 
such experiment, said the botanist, and he would believe 
in the witchery of hazel himself. But it was observed that 
he risked no more of his ducats in experiments. 
‘When Adam was expelled from paradise God pitied 
him to the degree that he allowed him to create new animals 
by striking water with a hazel rod; and he, having so 
produced a sheep, Eve, forsooth, must try her prentice 
hand and bring a wolf into the world, which forthwith 
sprang at the sheep. Adam regained the rod, and with it 
summoned into existence a dog that conquered the wolf. 
The first Christian church at Glastonbury, England, 
was a wattled house of hazels; it was a wand of hazel with 
which St. Patrick drove the Irish snakes into the sea; and 
the pilgrim’s staff was made of this wood and often buried 
with him when he died of disease or exhaustion on his way 
to Jerusalem, Magicians used it also in summoning fiends;

    Circe employed it in turning her lovers into swine; in one 
version of the legend, Aaron’s rod was made of it; and such 
was the sanctity it obtained from that circumstance that 
oats fed to horses in Sweden are touched with hazel boughs, 
in God’s name, that no harm may come to them from the 
eating. In that country, too, the hazel nut is one of the 
magical agents in making its carrier invisible. Divining 
rods must there be cut at night on the first of the new 
moon, or on Good Friday, or Epiphany, or Shrove Tuesday, 
the cutter facing east and lopping a branch from the east 
side of the tree. 
HEATH 
The heath, or heather, that decorates the Scottish hills, 
commemorates in its name the efforts of the Christians to 
convert the Picts. When the latter were visited by armed 
missionaries who ordered them to cease the worship of 
false gods, the Picts unreasonably gave battle, and the 
plants that were bedewed with the blood of the heathen 
became the heathen, or heath, for short. When all except 
two of the tribe had been killed, these survivors—father 
and son—were taken before Kenneth, the conqueror, who 
promised them life if they would tell him how to make heath 
beer. They remained silent. Thinking to force the older 
man to compliance, the king put the son to death before the 
father’s eyes. In anger and disgust, the old man refused 
to grant any favor to so brutal a victor, and the secret of 
the drink was never known, although, for shame’s sake, Ken- 
neth suffered his prisoner to live. In the Jura the secret 
still survives, for the peasants of that region continue to 
make a beer in which two parts of heath tops are combined 
with one of malt. But the heath of the Jura is not stained 
with a people’s blood.

    HELIOTROPE 
The Greek word heliotrope means to turn toward the 
sun. We apply the name to a modest flower of purple color 
and delightful odor, that came from Peru, and, being 
adopted into France, was called there herb of love. What 
the original heliotrope was, we do not know with certainty, 
but it is supposed to be a plant known in Germany as 
God’s herb, and to have many healing qualities. In the 
Greek myth the sun god Apollo is loved by Clytia, for 
whom he cares so little that he goes a-wooing the princess 
Leukothea. Clytia reveals the liaison to the king, who, 
furious at the misconduct of his daughter, buries her alive. 
Apollo returns to the heavens without so much as a look 
for the unhappy Clytia, who, bitterly conscious of the mis- 
chief she has done, falls to the ground and lies there for 
nine days, watching the passing of Apollo in his chariot, 
and praying for a look of pity. Seeing her wasted with 
privation and sorrow, the gods have mercy and change her 
into the heliotrope. She still lies at length upon the earth 
and looks toward heaven with half averted eye, as waiting 
complete forgiveness and acceptance. So our purple helio- 
trope is wrongly named, in that it does not turn toward 
the sun. Various plants have been instanced as foundation 
for Ovid’s story: sunflower, wartwort, spurge, salsify, 
anagallis, elecampane, aster, marigold, and blue marigold. 
HELLEBORE 
This plant (see early Christian legend of the Christmas 
rose) is commonly called black hellebore, because of the color 
of its root. It was a cathartic medicine so long ago as medic- 
inal use was made of plants, and it also purged human habi- 
tations of such evil spirits as had gained entrance, provided

    the perfuming of the house was accompanied by proper 
rites and hymns. Cattle were blessed with hellebore that 
had been dug within a circle drawn on the earth with a 
sword, the digger first asking leave of Apollo and Askle- 
pias. Arrows were rubbed with hellebore, that the flesh 
of animals to be killed with them should be tender. The 
plant cured insanity; and one of the earliest instances of 
a care for the soul-sick is found in the shipping of patients 
of a gloomy temper to Anticyra, where the herb grew plenti- 
fully. 
HEMLOCK 
Hemlock—conium maculatwm: not the tree we call hem- 
lock—was prescribed instead of the gallows and the axe 
as a means of death for certain political offenders in the 
past, and was a common drug of suicide, since it was sup- 
posed to give a painless death. The plant was considered

test they be chilled into a paralysis. It was mixed with the 
hell broths and ointments brewed and blended by witches 
for mischiefs, and in Russia and Germany it is still re- 
garded as the devil’s own property. It was by means of 
hemlock that the philosopher was put to death, after having 
annoyed Athens beyond endurance by exploiting his love 
for argument. by the ancients as so deadly that snakes would wriggle awa; 
even from a leaf of i ast_as their ribs would carry them 
HEMP 
“« To stretch hemp ’’ is a cant phrase for hanging, hence 
the plant that furnishes the means for death might be 
thought to be of evil omen; but since more rope is used 
for goodly purposes than for shutting off the wind of 
rogues, the weed has a kindly aspect, especially for maids 
who wish to see their future husbands before they are led 
136
-P-A-G-E-147
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    -to the altar, that they may make their plans wisely and put 
in train their fascinations. The damsels must run around 
a church at night, scattering hemp seed as they go, and 
repeating, ‘‘I sow hemp seed. Hemp seed I sow. He 
that loves me best, come after me and mow.’’ And, looking 
over her shoulder, the sower experiences a pleasing terror, 
for she will behold the wraith of a man, chasing her with 
a scythe which he swings through the phantom crop that 
springs in her footsteps. Sicilians use hempen threads 
as a lure for lovers, for there would seem in this to be a 
suggestion of the tying of hearts together. An ill use that 
is made of hemp is that of extracting the hashish. The 
eater of this intoxicant bewilders his brain with grotesque 
and unearthly visions. Under its influence the Arabs be- 
lieve they can hear the words and even read the thoughts of 
others at a distance. 
HOREHOUND 
Horehound candy was popular in our fathers’ day, be- 
cause it was ‘‘good for the system.’? Horehound, horse- 
radish, coriander, lettuce, and nettle are the five bitter 
herbs ordered to be eaten by the Jews at their Passover 
feast, and the name of the first also bespeaks antiquity 
of service, for it is the seed of Horus, which the Egyptian 
priests dedicated to that god; but how the name of hound 
attached to it nobody knows. In Egypt horehound was like- 
wise bull’s blood and eye-of-a-star. It was one of those 
many plants that defended the eater against poison. 
HOUSE-LEEK 
The house-leek, which is not a leek, and grows in old 
gardens and on old walls as readily as in houses, may 
have taken its name from a command of Charlemagne 
137  
-P-A-G-E-148
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
— 
that it should be planted plentifully on the roofs of houses 
in his kingdom that it might protect them against ‘‘thun- 
der.’’ This curious little plant, with its rosettes of leathery 
leaves, was anciently known under the names of Jupiter’s 
beard—not in the least like anybody’s beard—Jupiter’s eye, 
ayegreen, and thunder flower. , It cured fevers inflicted by 
witches; babes dosed with the juice of it were assured of 
long life; and if a person rubbed it over his fingers he 
could then handle hot iron—once. 
HYACINTH 
The hyacinth symbolizes misfortune and sadness, though 
to the gardener none is more welcome than this early 
visitor, with its luscious perfume and softly radiant color. 
The name was borne by a handsome boy, who was beloved 
by both Zephyrus and Apollo. The lad preferred the god 
of day to the inconstant master of the winds, but in ex- 
pressing his preference he did not realize what danger he 
incurred. Apollo having challenged the young fellow to a 
game of quoits, Zephyrus lingered in the wood, resolved 
to take his revenge. When Apollo hurled his discus at the 
mark, the wind god deflected it full against the brow of 
Hyacinthus, and killed him. But the sun god declared 
that while the beauty of the boy had departed, it should 
be recorded in the finer beauty of a flower, and he sum- 
moned the hyacinth out of the earth, sighing upon it ‘‘ Ai, 
Ai!”’ which words of grief some will affect to see, in Greek 
character, on hyacinth blooms. Yet because the sound is 
like that of i (eternal), the plant has come to signify 
remembrance; hence it used to be sculptured on tombs. 
The wild hyacinth, or bluebell, otherwise known as wood 
hyacinth, St. George’s flower, and bending Hndymion, 
represents benevolence in florography, and all hyacinths ex-

    pressed. affection of old, no less than ill ending, for Venus 
bathed in their dew to increase her beauty, and they formed 
the couches of Jove and Hera, and of Adam and Eve. 
HYPERICUM 
Like fern seed, the hypericum, or St. Johnswort, has a 
way of revealing itself on the eve of St. John in a golden 
glow, surpassing the brightness of its flowers in the sun. 
It was the early missionaries to the north who, finding this 
plant devoted to witches that fought against the sun (dark- 
ness and ill weather in symbolry), gave to it a new and 
wholesome consecration, which was no doubt suggested by 
its ruddy sap. This, the good fathers said, indicated the 
blood of the martyred John the Baptist, and, thus blessed 
by name, it began to bless in purpose in that it keeps off 
the witches who, of all nights in the year, are abroad 
on Walpurgis night, the eve of St. John. When a sprig 
of St. Johnswort is placed above the door, along with a 
cross, no witch or demon can enter. The Tyrolese moun- 
taineer puts the wort into his shoes, believing that so long 
as it is there he can climb or walk without fatigue. 
INDIAN PLUME 
An Indian girl living near Lake Saranac loved a youth 
whose straightness of form and swiftness in war and the 
chase had caused him to be named The Arrow; but before 
the time set for the wedding a fearful pestilence appeared 
and ravaged all the Adirondack villages. The Arrow was 
among the first to die. The people implored the Great 
Spirit to be merciful, whereupon he showed himself on the 
crest of the Storm Darer. It was their sins, he said, that 
had brought punishment on them: they had grown too fond 
139
-P-A-G-E-150
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
of war and bloodshed; they had held too lightly their pacts 
with other tribes; they had been’ careless in good deeds; 
they had grown haughty and selfish. Nothing but the 
blood of one much beloved would appease his wrath. 
The people of Leelinaw’s village gathered to consider 
this revelation. After a time Leelinaw arose and entered 
the circle. ‘‘I am a blighted flower,’’ she said, ‘‘it is my 
blood that shall flow for you. Place me beside The 
Arrow.”’ 
So speaking, she caught a stone knife from the belt of 
the priest, and slew herself. 
The Great Spirit saw from his mountain top, and his 
heart was softened. He swept away the pestilence; but he 
did more, for he eternalized the memory of the sacrifice 
by causing the flower we call the Indian plume, or Oswego 
tea, to spring from the spot where Leelinaw’s blood had 
been shed. 
TRIS 
No plant more sweetly recalls the gardens of our grand- 
mothers than the iris, or fleur-de-lis. Though showing by 
its hollow stem that it prefers to be near water, it grows 
in all manner of soil, and was generally to be found near 
the porch of the farm-house, where its blossoms, blue, 
purple, white, or yellow, were eagerly looked for as the 
spring advanced. It vies with amethyst in the depth of its 
color, and with the lily in its delicate, almost watery text- 
ure. In flower poetry it typed wisdom, faith, and courage ; 
but in the rude medical practice of earlier days it cured 
—‘spleens,’’ coughs, bruises, fits, dropsy, snake-bites, and 
* anger, and one had only to lay its petals on a black-and-blue 
spot for a couple of days to restore the bruised flesh to its 
natural condition. Scrofula and other blood diseases were 
cured by creating an open wound and inserting a bead 
140
-P-A-G-E-151
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
of iris root. The root was also to be used for infants to 
cut their teeth upon, and the practice of placing beads of 
iris, or orris, as it is oftener called in the drug-shops, about 
the necks of the little ones extended itself to adults, who 
wear them for ornament. Leghorn and Paris export 
twenty millions of these beads in a year. Orris is also used 
to throw upon fires atid give out a pleasant odor; to 
remove the smell of liquor, garlic, and tobacco from re- 
formable breaths; and to simulate violet in sachets. 
The Iris is really meant when we speak of the lilies of 
France and Florence. Near the Italian city, it is raised 
for the sake of its fragrant root, while in France it was 
conventionalized on the royal arms and standards. King 
Clovis, of France, had for his coat-of-arms three black 
toads. In peace they served him well enough, but every 
time he went to war the toads on his shield were soundly 
battered, and some fear was felt lest the swords of the 
enemy pass through them and pierce the body of his maj- 
esty. But one day a holy hermit, gazing from his cell in 
contemplation, was startled by the appearance of an angel 
bearing a shield as blue-bright as was the sky, with three 
flowers of iris enameled on it and shining like the sun. 
The old man took the shield, with news of its heavenly 
origin, to Clotilde, the queen, who gave it to the king. 
Clovis expunged the toads from his armorial bearings, and 
in his next fight bore the angel’s shield, observing, when 
it was over, that all stains of battle had disappeared, and 
that the lilies shone. From that day his armies triumphed 
in every field, and France, inheriting not only his prowess 
and his fame, but the shield itself, adopted the lilies for the 
royal standard. The iris then symbolized Christianity, 
which faith Clovis at once adopted, in accordance with his 
vow to do so if he should win a victory against the Germans. 
Doubters say that he never wore the toads as a blazon, 
141

but took the iris on his accession to the throne. The blos- 
soms, being badly represented by the rude artists of that 
day, were mistaken for toads. At all events, they became 
more like lilies as time went on, and kept their place till 
the Revolution brought in the symbolry of the cock, the 
eagle, the Roman fasces, and the bee. The seventh Louis 
adopted the iris in his crusades of 1137, for it appeared 
miraculously pictured on his white standards; hence it 
became known as the flower of Louis, though its earlier 
name may have been flower de luce, or flower of light. At 
first the royal standards were thickly sown with this em- 
blem, but Charles V. reduced them to three, to typify the 
trinity. 
JAMBU, OR SOMA 
A huge tree bearing a great fruit, known to the Hindus 
as the jambu but to botanists as eugenia jambos, is the 
“fruit of kings’’ that gave its name to the continent Jamb- 
duvipa, and was one of the four trees—ghanta, kadamba, 
ambala, and jambu—that marked the cardinal points where 
the four giant elephants held up the world. Four great 
rivers run from this tree, in the cosmogenic myth, for its 
fruit was then as large as elephants, and breaking as they 
fell, when ripe, they released the flood now ealled the 
Jambu River. This stream, fed expressly from its fruits, 
is therefore sacred, and a stream of health, as near to the 
precious soma of the gods as mortals may hope to know. 
Brahma having breathed upon the tree and imbued it with 
eternal life, it exhales the perfume of his breath. The dead 
climb into its branches for new strength as they begin 
the journey to the sky where the immortals are. It is as the 
soma, however, that the tree is king of plant life in the 
world, for soma yields the divine ambrosia, the drink of 
eternity. When the gods arrived on Mount Himayant in 
142 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
their boat of gold, the costus, or kushtha, threw forth such 
a light that it revealed this neighbor tree, which, in its 
earlier aspects, yielded night and day before the sun and 
stars were created. It formed a visible body for Brahma 
himself, bore every kind of fruit known to the world, 
and the gods sit in its shade drinking soma and constantly 
renewing their youth. 
The Hindu soma is thought by some scientists to be 
asclepias acida, a name that seems to relate it to our milk- 
weeds. In the Punjab, where it is known as the moon 
plant, it represents or emblemizes the moon god, who seems, 
in turn, to have a care for it, and the sap, fermented and 
described as ‘‘a very nasty drink,’’ is an elixir of life. 
The juice is variously called sharp and acid, and astringent 
and bitter; hurtful in large doses, because it is a narcotic, 
and, without inducing sleep, benumbs the body and dan- 
gerously lowers vitality. To the Oriental mind, always 
eager for equivalents and parables, the milkiness of its sap 
symbolizes the motherhood of nature, while the division of 
its blossom into five petals has a mystic meaning for the 
Indian; hence, the yogi, or wise man, drinks soma at 
his initiation into the mysteries of priesthood, and sees 
that which the common man may. not, who is unworthy 
to taste it. 
i JASMINE 
We who know the jasmine only as a greenhouse plant 
with a few white blossoms do not realize the possibilities of 
the species, for in tropical lands it becomes a tree-cloud of 
flowers, white and pink, and deliciously fragrant. And 
in spite of the abundance of flowers in the hot countries 
the people prize them as we do not always prize our 
sunsets and our northern lights. True, we are developing 
a better appreciation of the common and neglected beauties 
143

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    of the wood and wayside, but we make no such use of 
flowers, even in our social functions, as the Mexicans and 
Central Americans make of rose, flamboyant and jasmine. 
They are sold in the towns for little money, hence the people 
can afford them for decorations as we can afford the 
goldenrod and daisy, and they use them lavishly in their 
churches and homes on feast days. 
Many flowers died of sorrow on crucifixion night, but 
the jasmine merely folded its leaves and endured its pain, 
and in the morning, when it reopened, it was no longer 
pink, as it had been before: it had turned pale, and was 
never to show color again. In the east it is highly esteemed, 
and the Indian women braid it into their hair when they 
receive it from their lovers, inasmuch as it promises long 
affection. It is worn in bridal-wreaths for that reason, 
though its oriental name of dark-and-thoughtful suggests 
no connubial delights, nor is its legend gladsome, for that 
represents the despair and suicide of a princess who dis- 
covers that the sun god has transferred his love from her to 
a rival. From her tomb sprang the night jasmine, known as 
the sad tree, whose flowers still shrink in reproach and 
horror from the sun, shedding their petals at the dawn. 
To the Arabs, again, it is a flower of love, imaging the 
charm of a sweetheart, though they call it the yas min, 
which means, despair is folly, and suggests an Omar Khay- 
yam mood of heedlessness rather than the tenderness of 
love. 
JUNIPER 
Venerable antiquity pertains to the German tradition 
of the juniper: that a boy entering a chest to pick up an 
apple is caught and killed by his step-mother, who boils 
his flesh for soup, and buries his bones under a juniper. 
She is disconcerted when the tree takes fire and a bird leaps 
144
-P-A-G-E-155
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    from its branches, flying over the land and spreading the 
story of the murder. The bird carries gifts to the boy’s 
sister, and breaks the head of the wicked woman by causing 
a mill-stone to drop upon it; after which exploit the bird 
reénters the flames of the juniper and takes on human 
shape: he is the boy once more. 
Under the following circumstances, the juniper serves 
as a thief-catcher: Bend a young juniper toward the earth 
and hold it down where you have placed it with two 
weights: a big stone and the brain-pan of a murderer. 
You are then to say, ‘‘Juniper, I bend and squeeze you till 
the thief’’ (here you name the suspect) ‘‘returns what he 
has taken, to its place.’’ So soon as the rascal feels an 
unaccountable impulse coursing through his legs and mind 
to restore the abstracted property, your injunction is in 
process of fulfilment, and you are then in all speed and 
kindness to release the tree from its cramped position. 
/ To the Greeks the juniper was a tree of the furies, 
/though it had not then been distilled to gin. Its berries 
/ were burned at funerals to keep off demons, while its 
green roots smoked as incense on offerings to the god of hell. 
It is one of the trees that opened their arms to afford hiding 
to Mary and Jesus in the flight to Egypt. It sheltered 
Elijah, too, from King Ahab; and the idea that it is a 
refuge for the weak or hunted continues in the supposition 
that hares find safety in its shadow when hounds pursue, 
and that its odor will kill any scent that dogs can follow. 
In later years it was burned in, or its sap was smeared 
over, dwellings and stables, to keep off evil spirits, and in 
Italy it is a protection against witches, because when they 
find one at a door they are compelled to count all its leaves 
before they can enter—a task so hopeless that they usually 
give it up.

    LARCH 
Have a larch about the house, for when burned it dis- 
turbs snakes. Sundry Romans built their bridges of this 
timber, because they regarded it as almost fire-proof. A 
ship of larch that had been floated after sinking in twelve 
fathoms of water was declared to be absolutely indestruc- 
tible by fire, so hard had the sea made it. To the French, 
this tree, the pinus laria, yields a manna that would appear 
to be little different from the gum that keeps so many 
American jaws wagging, for it is chewed by mountaineers 
in order to ‘‘fasten their teeth.’’ This gum was also used 
by witches, along with the blood of basilisks, the skin of 
vipers, the feathers of the phenix, the scales of salamanders, 
and other commodities that were commoner once than they 
are to-day, in the dreadful stews which were boiled at mid- 
night as a preliminary to cursing the neighborhood. 
LARKSPUR 
This flower had on its petals the letters A I A, signify- 
ing Ajax, terror of the Trojans. Disappointed in a divi- 
sion of the spoils after one of his battles, this hot-tempered 
soldier rushed into the open and wreaked his anger on a 
flock of sheep, stabbing several with his sword before he 
recovered from his madness. Ashamed of the spectacle he 
had made of himself, he turned his sword into his own 
vitals and perished. His blood, pouring over the sod, flow- 
ered into the air again as the delphinium Ajacis, but some 
who are able to read only so far as the first two letters of 
his name on the petals, construe them as the wailing cry of 
Ai, Ai! still to be heard in the east when Fate oppresses. 
The name delphinium is applied because the buds were held 
146
-P-A-G-E-157

{ 
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
to resemble a dolphin; but it has suggested many things to 
many eyes, for it is also known as lark’s heel, lark’s toe, 
lark’s claw, lark’s spur, and knight’s spur. 
LAUREL 
However it came by its symbolry, the laurel, or sweet 
bay, was prized by the Greeks as an averter of ill, and hung 
over their doors to keep off lightning. From a token of 
safety, it became a badge of victory. Generals sent dis- 
patches to the emperor encased in laurel leaves. The 
leaves were woven into garlands and crowns for victors 
in the games, as were myrtle, olive, pine, and parsley. 
If laurel were put under a rhymester’s pillow, they made a 
poet of him, and if he read his verses in a university he was 
crowned with the leaves and berries; so we have the word 
baccalaureate, which means, laurel berry; and as the stu- 
dent was supposed to keep so closely to his books that he 
had no thought for matrimony, the derivative word bache- 
lor came to be applied to an unmarried man. Laurel also 
gave power to soothsayers to look into the future. The 
Delphian oracle chewed its leaves before seating herself 
over the volcanic fumes on the tripod, and those who asked 
her service appeared with laurel crowns and nibbling the 
leaves that grew about Apollo’s temple. It shocks us a little 
to discover of the emperor Tiberius that his faith in the 
protecting power of laurel was such that whenever a storm 
blew up he clapped on a laurel crown and crawled under 
the bed, remaining in this unkingly attitude till the trouble 
was over. While standing under a bay tree one was safe / 
against wizards; and the berries kept off various diseases ; 
at least, Nero believed so, for during a pestilence he retired 
to Laurentium that he might save his precious health by 
breathing air that the laurels had purified.

We should be in an oratorical plight indeed if we were 
deprived of our laurel. It is long since we have used it for 
personal decoration, though at intervals the triumph of a 
musician is confessed in the laurel wreath that is passed 
across the footlights. Where did the fashion begin? Un- 
countable years ago, when Apollo chided Cupid for wanton 
conduct, and the boy revenged himself by shooting the god 
with his golden arrow, dooming him to love the first woman 
~he should meet. Not content with that, he sped a second 
shaft, with a leaden tip, into the breast of the offended 
deity, so branding him that he was bound to create a feel- 
ing of repugnance in whomsoever that woman might be. 
Ere long Apollo met the wood nymph Daphne, and laid 
siege to her heart, but Daphne was repelled, and the more 
eager he became, the more frightened and indignant she. 
At last she found that her only safety lay in flight, but 
Apollo was close at her heels, and when it became plain 
that her pursuer must overtake her, she prayed to the gods 
to take away the form that had enchanted him and deliver 
her from his persecutions. Hardly had that wish been 
uttered ere her feet struck into the earth; her arms, that 
she had flung aloft in appeal, began to thicken, and they, 
too, became immovable; her face disappeared in knots and 
wrinkles; her fair skin turned brown; her hair, that a 
moment before had been streaming on the wind, now rustled 
as leaves; and Apollo, coming up with outstretched arms, 
clasped nothing but a laurel tree. Though the god was 
cast down in sorrow, his love was unquenched. He still 
preferred his Daphne to all the trees of the field, and he 
ordained that locks of her shining hair—the leaves that 
should be borne in winter as well as summer—should crown 
all who excelled in courage, service, or the creation of 
beauty.

———— OOOO 
LEEK 
The Egyptians and the Druids viewed the bulbs of the 
allium species—lily, onion, garlic, and leek—as represent- 
ing the universe. Each successive layer about the centre 
eorresponded to the successive heavens and hells of ancient 
cosmogonies. The leek was much used in secret ceremonies 
in the temples of the Nile. ‘‘To eat the leek,’’ which is 
synonymous with eating crow pie and humble pie, is a 
phrase that extends into the antiquity which saw the rising 
of the pyramids, for an inscription uncovered in one of 
those monuments shows that the leek was a common food 
of the poor: hence its association with humility. 
In the Egyptian legend, Dictys, who corresponds to the 
Greek Endymion, was drowned while gathering the leek 
from a river, to the grief of Isis, the moon goddess, who 
loved him. Greece respected the leek because Latona, hay- 
ing lost her appetite, found it again when she had eaten 
freely of leeks. The leaf of the leek, too, is ‘‘the ribbon of 
Saints Maurice and Lazarus,’’ and it is the cord by which 
St. Peter’s mother sought to be lifted out of hell, in an 
odd legend of the Sicilians. It appears that this woman 
was stingy and grudging to a degree, and in all her life 
had never given anything away except the leaf of a leek, 
which she threw to a beggar to quiet his pleading. When 
she died and was consigned to eternal torment, she begged 
her son to intercede with the Lord in her behalf. Peter 
begged the favor, but was coldly received. Said the Lord, 
“«The woman never did a particle of good; still, I will send 
an angel to her with this leek leaf, and if it is strong 
enough to lift her out of hell, let her be free.’’ The angel 
flew to the pit and offered the end of the leaf to Peter’s 
mother, but no sooner had she risen a few feet than all 
the rest of the damned laid hold on her so that they might 
149
-P-A-G-E-160
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    be lifted, too. She kicked wildly at the host, and struggled 
so viciously that the leaf broke and she fell into gloomier 
depths than ever. 
The Poles assume that the leek was the reed borne as a 
mock sceptre by Christ when He was crowned with thorns, 
and they place its flower-stalk in the hands of His statue 
on certain holy days. 
White and green, the hues of the leek, are the Cymric 
colors, and on the Ist of March the Welsh wear them 
in celebration of St. David: It has been alleged that St. 
David, being a holy and frugal man, subsisted considerably 
on leeks, inasmuch as they grew wild in his neighborhood. 
On leaving his cell to engage the Saxons in battle, he or- 
dered his soldiers to put leeks into their caps, that in the 
turmoil, when men were striking at close quarters, the 
Welsh might not only spread terror into the ranks of the 
foe by charging the air with this most appalling smell, but 
could also know one another. The device was not unusual, 
and several heraldic cognizances had their beginnings in the 
custom, notably that of the Plantagenets in the planta 
genista. As the Welsh carried the field on this occasion, 
they continued to wear leeks in memory of their victory. 
LILY 
Because of its purity, it is especially fitting that the lily 
should represent the Virgin and decorate her altars, for her 
tomb was found to be filled with lilies and roses after her 
ascension. This miracle was accomplished in order to allay 
the doubts of St. Thomas, who could not be persuaded 
that the Virgin had really risen from the dead; but, stand- 
ing beside her flower-filled tomb, he saw her hovering in 
the air; and when she had flung her girdle to him he was 
forced to believe. In the symbolry of the Church, the lily 
is also the ‘‘attribute’’ of St. Francis, St. Joseph, St. 
150 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  Barnard, St. Louis de Gonzague, St. Anthony, St. Clara, 
St. Dominick, St. Katharine of Siena, and the angel 
Gabriel. 
The lily fell from grace in Gethsemane when Christ 
walked there on the night before his death, for every other 
flower in that garden bent its head in sympathy and sorrow 
as he passed. The lily, shining in the darkness, said in the 
conceit of her own beauty, ‘‘I am so much fairer than my 
sisters that I will stand erect on my stalk and gaze at him 
as he goes by, in order that he may have the comfort of my 
loveliness and fragrance.’’ As he saw the flower, he paused 
before it, for a moment, possibly to admire, but as his eye 
fell upon it, in the moonlight, the lily, contrasting her self- 
satisfaction with his humility, and seeing that all other 
flowers had bent before him, was overcome with shame, and 
the red flush that spread over her face tinges it still. We 
eall it the red lily for that reason, and it never erects its 
head as it did before that night. 
The decorative qualities of the lily have always been 
appreciated. In our own days Mr. John S. Sargent has 
introduced it phopdantsy in his celebrated painting ‘‘ Car- 
nation Lily, Lily Rose.’’ 
Like Diana and Juno, Lilith, the font wife of Adam) 
éarried the lily as an emblem. oF 
The-Greeks and Romans regarded it, as we do, as a sym- \ xh 
bol of purity, and they crowned the bride and groom with } 
wreaths of lily and wheat, indicating a cleanly and fertile ~~ 
life. Among older nations, it typed virginity and inno- 
cence, like most of the white flowers; hence the lilies on our 
altars at Easter—relics of a sun worship begun in Egypt— 
will sometimes have their anthers removed, that the lilies 
may remain virgin. The symbolic use of the lily persists, 
and it was long regarded as of good fortune, Judith wear- 
ing it on the night when she went to Holofernes, to keep off 
the evil she intended to inflict on him. In Spain it was held 
151
-P-A-G-E-162

    that the lily could restore human form to any who had 
fallen under enchantment and been changed to beasts. 
In a garden in that land, in 1048, an image of the Virgin 
was seen to issue from this flower, and as a sequence to this 
apparition the king, who lay ill of a dangerous disease, 
suddenly left his bed as sound as ever he was. In recog- 
nition of the divine help, he organized the Knights of St. 
Mary of the Lily, three centuries before a similar order 
was instituted by the ninth Louis of France. 
Under the rain the lilies of the Caucasus used to change, 
sometimes to red, sometimes to yellow. Maidens tell their 
fortunes in these revealments, for, having chosen a bud, 
they look at it after the shower, and if it has opened yellow 
they suspect their lovers of unfaithfulness, but if it is red 
they know them to be true. In an eleventh-century legend 
of that land, an officer returning to his home in the hills, 
after the pains and trials of war, brings with him Plini, 
son of a fellow soldier, whom he adopts. The lad, intro- 
duced to the general’s home, meets his daughter, Tamara, 
a blushing damsel who has known so little of the world 
that she is as innocent as the birds that sing among the 
vines and trees at the door. Plini, finding her ignorant 
of books, teaches her to read and speak the Greek, even as 
the poets spoke it. He finds her unskilled in music, but 
under his instruction she learns to sing and play on the 
harp. They study together, they walk the fields hand in 
hand; time is not for them, for the world rolls on in an 
eternity of happiness. But Tamara has been. promised to 
an official of consequence in the Georgian state, and, learn- 
ing of this, Plini and Tamara realize that they love each 
other; that apart they can hardly endure to live. Still, 
the girl is dutiful, and will not listen to her lover when 
he pleads with her to fly with him to Greece. She promises 
only to pray for a way out of the difficulty, and, hoping 
to obtain it, she visits a monk who lives alone in the moun- 
152
-P-A-G-E-163
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
tains. Her retinue remains outside while she questions 
the old man in his hermitage, and it is thrown into terror 
by a storm in which the place is pelted with lightnings and 
shaken by thunder. When this has passed Tamara is no 
longer seen. The attendants rush into the presence of the 
monk and demand that she return to them. ‘‘God has 
heard our prayer,’’ he answers. ‘‘Tamara is no longer 
troubled. Behold her!’’ 
The people follow the monk’s gesture with their eyes 
and observe a splendid lily in his garden where none grew 
before, and its fragrance comes to their nostrils like incense. 
But the people are doubters, and they will not believe the 
miracle. They drag the recluse from his cell, search the 
building and the shrubbery, and with cries of anger fall 
upon and kill him. Not content with this, they set fire 
to all that will burn, destroying the house, its statues of 
the saints, its ancient trees, its library, so that when they 
go to break the news of the girl’s disappearance the lily 
stands alone in a field of ashes. 
In the excess of his grief Tamara’s father dies, but 
Plini hastens to the scene of the floral transfiguration and, 
standing before the flower, cries, ‘‘Is it indeed you, Tam- 
ara?’’ And there is a whisper, as of wind moving through 
its leaves: ‘‘It is I.’? The youth bends above the lily, and 
his tears fall on the earth beside it. Yet, blinded as he is 
by grief, he cannot but observe that the leaves turn yellow 
as with jealousy. The next drops fall into the flower 
itself, and it flushes red with joy. That night he falls into 
such a passion of weeping that the Lord changes him into 
a rain-cloud, that he may the oftener refresh the lily that 
was his love. And in after years, when dryness bakes the 
earth, the girls go out from their villages and strew lilies 
over the fields, singing Tamara’s song as they march. See- 
ing these flowers, the cloud arises and pours warm tears 
over the land.

A boy regarded as an ‘‘innocent,’’ or imbecile, was 
accepted by a kind abbot as an inmate of his monastery 
near Seville. The brethren did their best to instruct him, 
but as he seemed to remember nothing from hour to hour 
he was put at work in the fields and about menial tasks in 
the building. He did with patience what was expected of 
him, but was shy because of his infirmity, and at every 
chance would steal into the church, where he might sit 
alone, murmuring to himself, ‘‘I believe in God; I hope for 
God; I love God.’’ And there, after a day in the garden, 
they found the guileless fool, his hands folded, a serene 
smile on his face: dead. The words he had so often re- 
peated were carved on the cross at his head when they 
buried him. Shortly a lily sprang from the grave, and, 
curious to know its origin, the abbot ordered the body to 
be exhumed, whereupon it was found that the heart of the 
innocent had become the root of the flower. 
In a folk-tale of Normandy a knight who had resisted the 
charms of the sex till he had acquired a reputation for 
coldness that exempted him from its assault, was accus- 
tomed to spend much time in graveyards, where he would be 
seen in a listening attitude, as if he expected some message 
from the dead which would show him the way to happiness. 
And the way came as he did not expect it, for, so wandering 
among the tombs, he met on a fair morning a woman of 
beauty such as he had never before imagined. She was sit- 
ting on one of the marbles, dressed in precious stuffs, with 
glowing jewels at her waist, and hair as yellow as the pollen 
of the lily she held in her hand. Her presence breathed 
a sweetness that filled him with admiration and awe, and, 
kneeling, he kissed her hand, at which salute the lady 
woke, as from a dream, and, smiling on him, said, ‘‘Sir 
knight, will you take me to your castle? You have sought 
me long, and I have come at last, for I have been waiting 
the hour when I might disclose myself. That happiness 
154

    you have denied to yourself so long, it is mine to give. 
But before I go with you I must exact one promise, and it 
is that none shall speak of death when I am near. Think 
of me as representing the life of the world, the bloom of 
youth, the tenderness of love, and think of this as yours 
forever.”’ 
The knight, enraptured, lifted the maid to his horse; 
the animal cantered away without seeming to feel her added 
weight, and as they rode through the fields the wild flowers 
bent their heads, the trees murmured musically, and fra- 
grance filled the air, as from unseen beds of lilies. So 
they were married, and were very happy. If now and then 
some touch of his old sad manner was seen in the knight, 
his wife had only to place a lily against his brow and all 
melancholy disappeared. Christmas eve arrived, and a 
great banquet was ordered. Flowers of magic size adorned 
his table, the dames sparkled with smiles and jewels, and 
the lords wore so brave a mien it was inspiriting to look 
at them. And while they feasted a minstrel sang, now of 
love, now of war, of knightly adventure, of noble deeds 
and high resolves; then, tuning his harp to a more reverent 
strain, he sang of heaven and the earning of it through 
death. At the word the lily wife turned pale and began 
to fade like a flower touched with frost. Her husband 
caught her in his arms with a ery of anguish, for now she 
began visibly to shrink, and in a few moments grief and 
bewilderment possessed him, for, behold, he was clasping 
a lily in his arms, and its petals were dropping to the floor. 
A great sighing was heard in the air, and the room was 
filled with a sweet odor. The knight turned away with 
a despairing gesture and went out into the darkness, never 
again to be seen by those about his board. And out of 
doors a change had come. It had grown cold and bleak, 
and the angels were scattering over the earth the lily petals 
of the snow. ,

No sweeter flower blooms than the lily of the valley. It 
expresses the virtues of purity and humility. There is 
somewhat calming in its whiteness, and something holy in 
its perfume. It seeks quiet, half-shaded places, as if avoid- 
ing the ruder contacts of the world. Little May bells is one 
of its German names, and in England the old names of May 
flowers and May lilies are still applied, but these are trite, 
and ‘‘ladders to heaven’’ commends itself as a better. To 
the French, a tender meaning tells itself in ‘‘the tears of 
Holy Mary.’’ Ostara, Norse goddess of the spring, was a 
patron of the flower that marked her coming. We find 
a fitting use of it in the Saga of Frithjof, where Inge- 
borg, lamenting her hero, describes his grave as covered 
with these tender blooms. Lilies of the valley are appro- 
priate gifts to be offered by young swains when they visit 
their ladies; and, indeed, the homage and implication of 
purity and sweetness is poetry in itself. Is it any wonder 
that the perfume distilled from these holy flowers should 
have been held so precious in other times that only gold 
and silver vessels were fit to receive it? 
In the allegory which has been localized as a legend in 
Sussex, England, St. Leonard met the frightful dragon, 
Sin. For three days he struggled against it, sometimes 
almost fainting, often desperate and fearing, yet never 
giving over the fight. On the fourth morning he had the 
satisfaction of seeing the creature trail its slimy length 
into the wood, weak with pain, never to encounter with him 
again. Yet it had left its marks. Wherever its claws or 
tusks had struck him and his blood had dewed the earth, 
- heaven marked the spot and sanctified it, for there sprang 
the lily of the valley. Pilgrims might trace his encounters 
in white all about the wood; and those who listened could 
hear the lily bells of snow chiming a round to victory.

    LILAC 
The lilac, which comes from Persia and retains the 
name it bears in that land, lilag meaning flower, was car- 
ried to Europe in the sixteenth century and brought to 
this country by the Puritans. It grows wild in southern 
Asia and southwestern Europe, but with us, who have 
known it as prince’s feather and duck’s bills, and also as 
laylock and blow-pipe tree, because pipe-stems were made 
from its smaller branches, it is a loved occupant of the 
garden; and what more beautiful than a lane of lilacs in 
May with heavy heads nodding over the walk and dripping 
dew and perfume? Though picked for May festivals it 
was introduced charily indoors, for to many it was a flower 
of ill luck—a result of the association of its purple color 
with the hues of mourning. An old proverb declares that 
she who wears lilacs will never wear a wedding ring, and 
to send a spray of lilac to a fiancé was a delicate way of 
asking that the engagement be broken. An English noble- 
man having ruined a trusting girl and caused her death 
of a broken heart, a mound of lilac blooms was placed upon 
her grave by friends, who averred that in the morning the 
flowers had become white, though when put upon the grave 
they were rosy mauve. This, the first white lilac, is pointed 
out to-day in the churchyard of a hamlet on the Wye, in 
Hartfordshire. 
LINDEN 
To the old Germans, the lime, or linden, was a holy 
tree, yet a haunt of dwarfs and fairies; and under it the 
dragons lay so often, for the shade, or for some protecting 
property, that they became known as lindenworms. The 
custom of magistrates of sitting beneath it to give sentence 
also lent importance to the lime and caused it to be known 
as the tree of judgment. In the mythology of the north, 
157

    when Sigurd, after killing the dragon Fafnir, bathes in 
its blood, a linden leaf falls on his shoulder and makes it 
vulnerable to Hagen’s spear, since it prevents the blood 
from touching the skin at that point; hence the linden was 
a tree of ill-fortune. Like other trees, it is occasionally 
bound up in the fortunes of a family or tribe, an instance 
being that of the ‘‘wonderful tree’’ of Susterheistede, 
which was to be green so long as the Ditmarschens kept 
their freedom, but was doomed to wither when they lost it, 
as the event proved; but the people say that the day is com- 
ing when a magpie will build in its branches and rear five 
young, and the ancient liberties will then be restored to the 
land. 
A tradition of the tree had fresh telling in America when 
Prince Henry came to us on his friendly errand, with Ad- 
miral Baron von Seckendorff as chief of his suite, for 
the history of the Seckendorffs begins in the year 1017 in 
this wise: When Henry II. was on the throne, the favorite 
pastime of the court was hunting. In one of his expedi- 
tions, the emperor roused a bull, which attacked him 
fiercely. Henry had only a sword for his defence, and had 
nearly given up hope, when the underbrush was shaken, 
and a young man bounded into the clearing with a. lance, 
which he cast into the body of the bull. As the animal sank 
with a groan, the young man respectfully uncovered, while 
the king mopped his brow, and gazed from the bull to the 
spearman, as if doubting their existence. On coming to 
himself, he embraced his preserver, crying, ‘‘So brave a 
man is destined to father a race of heroes;’’ and led him 
to.a linden, where his retinue had now assembled. There 
he related the incident, his story being greeted with 
applause. — 
“What is your name?’’ asked the king. 
“‘Walter,’’ replied the stranger. 
158
-P-A-G-E-169
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  Henry reached into the tree and, breaking off a branch 
with eight leaves, bent it into a wreath and placed it on 
the young man’s brow. ‘‘I have no chain of gold to give 
to you here,’’ he explained, ‘‘so take this spray of linden 
as a sign of better favors from your emperor.’’ Then, com- 
manding him to kneel, the monarch dealt the accolade, 
saying, ‘‘Rise, sir knight; and because you have risked 
your blood for mine, be your device a red linden branch 
on a white field. The lands and castle of Seckendorff are 
yours.’’ 
The linden is one of the elements in the well-known 
tale of Philemon and Baucis, the contented old couple who 
served Jove and Mercury in their humble cot, when those 
gods descended in disguise, and who, in recompense, were 
spared from destruction in the deluge that overwhelmed 
their neighbors in Phrygia. Their home was transformed 
into a temple, and there they served as priest and priestess 
to the end of their days, which were long in the land. That 
neither husband nor wife might survive after the other 
was gone had been their prayer; so at the appointed time, 
when they came into the morning light, they knew that 
they should never see the sun again through human eyes, 
for on the head of each was a crown of leaves, not new 
placed, but growing. There was time for a last embrace. 
‘‘Good-by, my love,’’ said Philemon, and ‘‘Good-by, my 
dear,’’ said Baucis. Then, hand in hand, they faced to 
the east and spoke no more. Slowly their human guise was 
lost. Their forms, bent and withered, passed into the 
shapes of trees with corrugated trunks, but not trees that 
expressed age. On the contrary, they ascended high and 
higher, unfolding large and larger crowns of leaves to the 
sky, and so they stood for ages and may stand yet: Phile- 
mon an oak, Baucis a linden. Something of human spirit 
lingered in both and the Scythian soothsayers turned to

the linden when they were to prophesy and twined its 
leaves about their fingers when they sought inspiration, as 
if it spoke to them. 
LOTUS 
The symbolic use of the lotus is various and remarkable. 
It is the representation of the sun and moon; the attribute 
of silence; the symbol of female beauty; the breath of 
gods; the source of nectar that gives eternal life; the cradle 
of Moses; the seat of Buddha; a memorial of the ark; the 
resting place of great spirits. Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess 
of love, is couched upon it, the fragrance of her body 
filling the heavens; Kamadiva, the Hindu Cupid, floats 
down the Ganges on this flower; the Japanese Mercury, 
Fudo, glides through the air on lotus sandals; the new-born 
Buddha, in setting foot on earth causes a lotus to spring 
from it, and in his first seven steps northward a lotus marks 
each footfall. With the Egyptians it is the flower of 
Osiris, the sun god; and Horus, or Harpocrates, son of 
Osiris and god of silence, sits like Buddha, on a lotus, with 
finger on his lip, enjoining peace. This peace of eternity 
is expressed in the contemplative figures of Buddha, which 
the Japanese carvers have put into such exquisite form, 
and which represent the god as seated on an opened flower, 
ready to listen to the prayer of the faithful, that begins, 
“OQ God, the jewel of the lotus.’’ In the Greek legend this 
“bride of the Nile’’ is the body of a lovely nymph, who, 
deserted by Alcides, flung herself into the river and was 
drowned; but among the mystic orientals it is an emblem of 
the world, for Brahma, springing into life from the navel 
of Vishnu, alighted on a lotus, and from that rostrum com- 
manded all worlds into being. 
This flower, simple, decorative, and attractive in its 
form, appears in the architecture of Egypt, in the capitals 
160
-P-A-G-E-171
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
of its temple columns, in paintings and wall ornaments of 
the east, in the carpets of Turkey and Persia. No doubt 
it was first regarded merely for its beauty, and painters and 
sculptors used it as we might use the daisy or the maple 
leaf, without a thought of symbolism: but its petals, flaring 
to the light, suggested sun rays, and so it entered into the 
aspects and appliances of sun worship. Professor Good- 
year, in his ‘‘Grammar of the Lotus,’’ gives to it a high 
place in the arts of thirty centuries before Christ. He 
evolves the Ionie capital from its twisted sepals; the Greek 
fret or meander he also traces to that; and the fret or 
key pattern doubled is the swastika, earliest of symbols 
and ornaments, to be found in pottery and on the temple 
fronts of the old world and the new, where it represents 
light and dark, death and life, male and female, good and 
evil. The triangle of its calyx has doubtless served, like 
the shamrock, as text for those who expounded the Trinity, 
and the old figure of the cornucopia, showering plenty on 
the world, may easily have come from these seed vessels. 
The seed were closed in balls of clay and thrown into the 
water, that they might root and create new plantations; 
hence the saying, ‘‘Cast thy bread on the waters and thou 
shalt find it after many days.’’ For, despite the sanctity 
of the lotus, the Egyptians, Chinese, and others eat the 
bread made from its kernels; but in their case it seems to 
exercise none of the spell ascribed to it by the poets, who 
tell of lotus-eaters that care for no other food and so remain 
where it grows, forgetting their own countries and all 
pertaining to them. The lotus was a sacred flower in 
Egypt four thousand years ago, and was used to decorate 
guests at banquets, the stem being wound about the head 
and the bud hanging on the forehead. The Japanese still 
make ceremonial use of the lotus, which they buy on holi- 
days for temple decoration, and they use its leaves or pads 
11 161 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
to wrap up food that is offered to the dead. In Siam, where 
the lotus is the national flower, this heaven is suggested in 
the great ponds of lotus in the king’s park near Bangkok. 
MAGUEY 
Maguey, or agave, is often known as the century plant, 
because it blooms so seldom that most people believe it 
flowers only once in a hundred years. As a matter of 
fact, it blooms once in eight years in its own country, but 
in a cooler climate can be persuaded not to bloom at all. 
In Mexico it throws its leathery leaves to a height of fifteen 
feet, and its stalk, a veritable candelabrum, bearing about 
four thousand white blooms, is twenty-five feet high. When 
it has flowered it seems to have fulfilled its mission and dies 
down, leaving the ground to be occupied by sturdier off- 
spring, often from the old roots. Miles of country are 
covered by the maguey, for it has a commercial value in that 
it is food for cattle, its cores are baked for food, it fur- 
nishes thatch for cabins, fuel for kitchens, and fibre for 
thread and paper. The spike at its leaf-tip is used as a 
needle, its flower-stalk is a house-pole, and it stores water 
for the thirsty. These sweet juices, the agua miel, or honey 
water, that would otherwise go to the making of flowers, 
are drawn from a hollow cut in its heart, fermented, and 
made into pulque, or native beer. A plant will yield six 
quarts a day for four weeks, and is then exhausted. 
Pulque induces laziness and sleep, but the more fiery 
mescal, also made from a variety of this plant, involves the 
applicant in riot. 
The maguey is associated with the Virgin of Totoltepec, 
where the Aztecs had reared a temple to their gods, but 
which the Spaniards invaded to place the Virgin among the 
ruder statuary—a thing allowed, for peace’s sake. When 
162
-P-A-G-E-173
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    the people, unable to endure the arrogance, the persecutions, 
and the looting any further, arose and drove them forth, 
the Spanish troopers hid the image beneath a maguey, near 
the top of Totoltepee. Twenty years afterward a Christian- 
ized Aztec, wandering near the hill, was dazzled by a light, 
and, looking up, beheld the Virgin, who, smiling at him 
kindly, said, ‘‘Dear son, my image is hid near where you 
stand. Find it and enshrine it.’’ Cequauhtzin found it 
under the maguey, and took it home for safe-keeping. 
In the morning it was gone, but an ‘‘inward voice’’ told him 
it had gone back to the hill, and sure enough he found it 
once more, under the maguey. Again he took it to his 
house and put it into his stoutest chest, making his bed on 
the lid; yet in the morning the figure was gone again, and 
he found it a third time under the maguey. To the 
Fathers he went and told all that had happened, and they 
saw that the Virgin’s wish was that a shrine should be 
built over the plant in whose shade she had rested for so 
many years; accordingly, the splendid church of Our Lady 
of the Remedies was erected on the hill-top, the Aztec tem- 
ple being destroyed to make room for it. This church 
is now a resort of thousands seeking health and pardon. 
The slab in the altar records that ‘‘This is the very spot 
where the Holiest of Virgins was found under a maguey 
by the chief, Don Juan Aguila’’ (the Indian’s Christian 
name), ‘‘in the year 1540, where she told him, on appear- 
ing before him, that he should seek her.’’ 
A curious mark of patriotism was shown by the Mexi- 
ean congress in 1830, when it ordered that no legal docu- 
ment should be written on any other material than the 
paper of the national plant, the maguey. One writer offers 
a theory that Mexico means no more than the land of the 
maguey, the word mex-tli signifying a maguey, personified.

MAIZE 
It was a common belief among the American Indians 
that corn was of divine origin; that it was the food of the 
gods that created the earth, and when they flew back to 
heaven, pained by the ingratitude of men, seeds of maize 
fell from their hands, and, rooting on the earth, sprang up 
to be the food of millions. Our farmers kill the crow, but 
some of the Indian tribes protect it, for this bird was the 
seed-bearer who brought the corn from heaven. But two 
legends of the Iroquois tell another story. One is, that a 
chief, having climbed a mountain where he might be alone 
with the Great Spirit, begged the deity to give more food 
to his people, for they wearied of meat and berries, and 
longed for the food of the gods. The Great Spirit bade 
him go to the plains with his wife and children in the 
moon of rains, and wait for three suns. This the man did, 
and while waiting he and his family slept. Others came 
to seek them, and behold, the old man and his wives and 
children had changed to corn. The prayer had been 
answered. 
The other tale is of a man who for love of a beautiful 
girl would sleep in the wood near her wigwam, fearing lest 
some accident might happen, or a daring hostile creep into 
the camp and steal her. On a summer night he was 
awakened by soft foot-falls leaving her lodge, and, spring- 
ing up, he saw her walking in her sleep. He followed, but 
the faster he pursued, the faster she ran, till at last, in a 
field, he overtook her and clasped her in a strong embrace. 
It was Apollo and Daphne again, for, to his astonishment, 
he grasped, not a girl, but a plant such as he had never 
seen before, a tall and graceful stalk, with leaves as long 
as grass. The fright of waking far from home, and in 
the grasp of a man, had caused the girl to pray that she 
164
-P-A-G-E-175
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
might be so changed, and her hair became the silk and 
her lifted hands the ears that are now eaten. It was a com- 
mon belief among our eastern Indians that human beings 
could change their shapes in time of need, unless they were 
under the spell of an evil spirit. 
Corn dances, celebrating the bounty of nature, are prac- 
tised among many tribes, and among the Hopis of the 
southwest there is perpetuated a drama which symbolizes 
the growth of corn and the beneficent and malefic powers 
that affect it, figured in the appearance and conduct of 
strange creatures, represented in part by the Indians them- 
selves and in part by rude figures operated from behind a 
screen. The front of the stage represents a field of growing 
corn, with actual blades in mounds of earth, and this field 
is swept by the demons of storm and drouth, while shamans 
perform saving incantations, and heroes end the play by 
overwhelming the demons. 
In one of the earliest of the Indian corn legends, the 
First Mother was born of a beautiful plant. Seeing her 
children suffer during a famine, she begged her husband, 
the First Father, to kill her and scatter her body over the 
fields, so that the distress of hunger would be ended. The 
First Father appealed to the Great Spirit, who bade him do 
as his wife desired. So he scattered the fragments far and 
near, and after a time green blades came up, ripened, 
and were corn. So it is that the wise say, ‘‘A man is a 
grain of corn. Bury him and he rots. Yet his spirit lives 
and leaps from the earth again, to make him as he was.”’ 
The Chippewas tell how the demigod Wunaumon, sor 
of Hiawatha, lived alone, a mighty hunter, from whom 
the beasts flew or slunk away when they saw his shadow 
on the earth, He roamed freely through the forests of 
the Mississippi, and in one of his long tramps reached 
the prairies, which were like an endless lake of land save

    that far away he saw a strip of wood. ‘‘I will know 
what is there,’’ he said, and with great strides gained the 
other side of the country. As he stood under the trees a 
stranger came to meet him—a stranger with a shiny coat 
which was hard, like husks, and a flowing, ruddy feather 
in his sealp-lock. He was short and stubby, not likely, one 
would say, to offer battle to the big Wunaumon; indeed, he 
seemed to have no such intent, for after a short talk he 
produced a pipe and exchanged a whiff or two with the 
hunter. But the spirit of fight was in Wunaumon, who, 
looking down at the stranger, remarked, ‘‘I am very strong. 
Are you?”’ 
“*T have the strength of a man,’’ said the little fellow 
candidly. 
“T am Wunaumon. What is your name?’’ 
‘*T will not tell unless you beat me in wrestling. Throw 
me, and you shall find out. And it will be worth while to 
try, for you shall win more than the knowing of my 
name.”’ 
““Come, then, Red Feather!’’ cried the hunter, strip- 
ping off his ornaments. 
“T am not Red Feather. Try me, and perhaps you 
shall know. If you conquer, it will be for the good of all 
your people.’’ 
They struggled, feinted, broke away for breath, and 
went at it again, without the slightest advantage of one 
over the other, for hours. Wunaumon looked at his little 
adversary with astonishment. At last, as the sun began 
to sink, he braced himself for a mighty effort. He planted 
his feet far apart and threw his arms about the other 
wrestler with a hug like a bear’s. Something seemed to 
burst, and the man collapsed. 
‘‘Ha, Red Feather, I have beaten you!’’ cried Wunau- 
mon. ‘‘Now tell me your name.”’

  “T am Mondahmin. I give my body to your people. 
Where I have fallen cover me with fine earth; then come 
back to me often. You shall see me again, and I will 
bring gifts out of this land for you.’’ 
‘Wunaumon laid the body in the earth, covered it with 
dust, and in a month he came back to see two green 
feathers waving on the grave. The wind passed, and a 
voice like singing came from the plumes, saying, ‘‘This 
is corn, the gift of Mondahmin. Watch it, take the seed to 
your people, and tell them to make a feast to Mondahmin 
in the Moon of Fruits.’’ 
This did the hunter god, and the seed sprang up in 
strong, tall stems, bearing store of delicious grains that 
people planted, so that in times of famine it might save 
the lives of many. For this was that Mondahmin, who, 
after the Great Spirit had destroyed all men but one, by 
dropping the world into the great lake, came from the 
unknown and won the new-created sister of the survivor. 
He was the fifth of the spirit suitors for White Earth, and 
her brother had told her to keep silence till the fifth had 
come. The first was Usama. When White Earth refused 
him, his blanket fell from his shoulders and he became 
tobacco. The second was Wapako, and when she turned 
from him, this round and pudgy man rolled down the 
hill, a pumpkin. Next came Eshkossim, the melon; and 
Kokees, the bean; and they too fell as if dead when White 
Earth refused them. But at the eall of the fifth voice, 
which was like a musical rustling in the trees. White 
Earth looked the new-comer in the face and took him for 
her husband. After the wedding feast great rains fell, 
and from where the other suitors had disappeared sprang 
up the leaves of tobacco, pumpkin, melon, and bean, but 
tallest and most prized were the stems of corn, the plant 
ef Mondahmin.

MALLOW 
Our common little mallow, whose seed-pods—the 
““cheeses’’ of children—are eaten seriously in the east, ap- 
pealed to Mahomet so greatly, through his joy in a rope 
woven of its fibre, that he glorified a plant of it into the 
pelargonium—an achievement worthy of Burbank. Taken 
in the morning, the mallow protects one from disease for 
that day. Marsh mallow, however, was held to be ‘‘twice 
as good’’ a medicine, and nobody is much hurt by eating the 
confections sold as ‘‘marshmallows,’’ even in these days of 
adulterations. As ointment, the mallow cured those affected 
by witchcraft, and it had the more wonderful effect of pro- 
tecting from hot metal. 
MANDRAKE 
Because of its supposed power as an aphrodisiac, the 
fruit of the mandrake was apples of love to the Greeks, 
but devil’s apples to the Arabs. More than twenty solemn 
books have been written on the medicinal, spiritual, and 
diabolical nature of this plant, with its forked, flesh- 
colored roots that were carved into figures of men and car- 
ried as charms. It was a most dangerous plant to dig, 
hence it had to be pulled from the ground by a dog, that 
died of fright on hearing it seream—the shriek ‘‘like man- 
drakes torn from the earth’’—for the sound was death or 
madness to any that heard. The dog’s owner tied the tail 
of his faithful animal to the stem, first making the sign 
of the cross thrice over the plant, retreated to a safe dis- 
tance, whistled to the dog, closing his own ears tightly, and 
up came the angry vegetable. In time men acquired a bet- 
ter control over the plant, or themselves, for it sufficed 
to pry it out with a sword, if the digger would keep to 
168

windward of it and direct his face to the west. If he failed 
to dislodge it, the earth opened and he disappeared forever 
in the grasp of a fiend. Having taken the root, the 
owner is to keep it in a white cloth, in a box, bathe it 
every Friday, and save the water in which it is washed, 
as it has medicinal properties. This ‘‘earth manikin’’ 
brings luck to the house, and, carried under the coat, : 
protects one against reverses in courts of law. Possibly for 
this reason it was a more than suspicious circumstance 
to have a mandrake about one’s premises. It branded the 
owner as a wizard, and in 1630 three women were put to 
death in Hamburg on no other charge than that of having 
mandrake roots in their homes. The devil had a special 
watch upon these objects, and unless one succeeded in selling 
one for less than he gave for it, it would stay about him 
till his death. Throw it into the fire, into the river, smash 
it, fling it from a cliff, lose it in the woods, so soon as you 
reached home there would be the mandrake, creeping over 
the floor, smirking, human-fashion, from a shelf, or en- 
sconced in your bed. 
After dread of the mandrake had worn away to some 
extent, it was still observed with respect, was handed down 
from father to son, and in one case was kept in a coffin and 
infolded in a picture representing a thief on the gallows, 
with a mandrake growing at his feet. Sometimes the root 
bore a startling likeness to a human head, one such speci- 
men being shown in the College of Surgeons, in London: 
a double bulb, each showing every feature of a human coun- 
tenance, including a beard. German miners said that the 
root went far into the ground, and that it was the kobolds 
who cried when they saw it disappearing upward. 
The merits of mandrake became practical, as years went 
by, and referred less to fortunes than to health, since it 
tended to cure barrenness, nightmare, cramp, and tooth- 
169

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    ache, and protected the owner against robbers and bad 
weather. A common association of the plant with a buried 
corpse is thought to arise from the burial of Medusa’s 
head under the Agora at Athens: whence its name of man- 
dragora, and it may be because of the stupefying and fatal 
effect of Medusa’s gaze, while she lived, that this output 
from her tomb should be regarded as an opiate and poison. 
Shakespeare speaks of ‘‘poppy, mandragora, and all the 
drowsy spirits of the east.’’ In Iceland, where it is 
thieves’ root, because it grows from the mouth of a rascal 
who has been hanged, it will draw to itself the money from 
unguarded pockets if the owner puts beneath the man- 
drake a coin which he has just stolen from a poor widow 
at a high festival of the church, between the chanting of 
the Epistle and the Gospel. 
MANGO 
Travellers in the tropics endure mingled emotions in 
their experience with the mango, the exceeding juiciness 
whereof suggests that it be eaten in overalls, and which, 
when all is said, tastes to most of us like a door-mat soaked 
in turpentine. But the mango is prized by the blacks and 
the browns who live in the shade of it, and in a Canarese 
legend it is the tree of life itself. In that story a king 
had a magpie that flew up to heaven, and returned bringing 
mango seed, which it gave to the king, saying, ‘‘ Plant this, 
and when it has grown, eat of its fruit; for it will give 
everlasting life to all who taste it.’? The king put it into 
the ground forthwith, and in due season the tree had grown 
large, fair, with glossy leaves and glowing, ruddy fruit. 
It chanced, however, that the first mango he chose had 
been poisoned, for a snake in the grasp of an eagle flying 
overhead had dropped some venom on it. In some doubt

    as to its wholesomeness, the king ordered an old man in 
his court to eat the mango, and, the poison working in his 
vitals, he fell in torment and died. The king, astonished 
and angered, took the unfortunate magpie by the neck and 
beat its life out, and for a long time after nobody dared 
touch the tree. It was called, in fact, ‘‘the poison mango,”’ 
and might have been cut down and burned had it not been 
for an old woman who had been flouted and whipped by her 
son and his wife, and had resolved to commit suicide 
by eating a mango, that her death might be charged upon 
the undutiful pair. She ate the fruit and instantly was 
as a maid in her teens. Others, hearing of the wonder, ate 
also of the fruit, became young, and rejoiced. But the 
king did not eat. He thought on his wickedness in killing 
the affectionate bird that had brought to him the tree of 
eternal youth, and in remorse he slew himself. 
In a Hindu parable a mango tree is denoted, filled with 
fruit. A black man chops at it with his axe; a blue man 
tears off a branch; a red man pulls off fruit; a yellow 
man perches on a bough, eating ripe mangos; and a white 
man pauses on his way to pick up a fruit that has fallen 
to the ground. This is an allegory of life, and the use we 
make of it. The black one, with his axe, seeking only 
destruction, is the conqueror, or criminal; the blue man is 
the careless egotist who spoils, but in smaller measure; the 
red man will not injure the tree, but he is still greedy 
enough to require the best; the yellow man is temperate 
and wise, taking only what he needs and leaving enough for 
others; but the white man shows humility and accepts what 
the rest neglect, living content with the smallest share, 
pausing in his walk and service only long enough to take a 
single fruit, for the hungry will afterward pass that way. 
Yet the fruit he eats is sweetest,

  MAPLE 
Various legends concerning Manabozho—or Hiawatha, 
or Hoyawentha, or Glooskap—relate to trees and plants. 
For example, it is said that he flogged the birch, so often 
used in the flogging of others, and left the rings about its 
bark; that he gave thorns to the roses, out of his love for 
them, that the animals might not eat them; that he stole 
the first tobacco from a giant, and that the smoke of it, as 
he blows it abroad in the fall, makes the haze of Indian 
summer. The blood from sundry cuts in his flesh flowed 
to stain the red willow, which has never since lost its color; 
blisters from his burned back have become lichens on the 
rocks. As a crowning gift to his people, he created maple 
sugar, though this latter tradition is disputed by some 
eastern tribes, who assert that the sugar was discovered by 
a squaw who, having to cook moose-meat in early spring, 
and being at a distance from water, tapped a maple-tree 
and drew enough of the sap to fill her kettle. Having run 
away from her domestic duties to gossip with the neighbors, 
she was horrified, on her return, to discover that the liquid 
had boiled to nothing, and that the meat was immersed 
in a sticky mass of unpleasant aspect but inviting odor. 
To offer such a joint to her husband, whose step was even 
then heard in the wood, was to endure a beating, so she fled. 
‘What was her astonishment, on creeping to the camp, a 
little later, to discover her lord luxuriously seated at the 
fire, licking his fingers, which were coated with the brown 
substance, and quite neglecting the burned and hardened 
meat. She made bold to approach and was about to apolo- 
gize for her neglect when the brave arose and, throw- 
ing his hands about her neck, addressed her in terms of 
thankfulness and endearment; for she had discovered 
what was worth much moose-meat, and should continue to

be his bride forever. In that episode was discovered a 
solace and a source of revenue that has advantaged good 
New Englanders and Canadians to this day, and may have 
had its influence upon the latter in their choice of the maple- 
leaf as the provincial insignia. When frosts touch the 
earth, and the year fades to its sunset, it is the maple, more 
than all other trees, that glorifies the landscape and turns 
the hills to heaps of ruby and topaz. 
Anciently, the maple was an emblem of reserve, because 
of the quietness of its flowers. Its root cures lameness of 
the liver, says Pliny. Cicero had a table of maple-wood 
that cost ten thousand sesterces, and another was sold to an 
opulent Roman for its weight in gold. Maple, too, was a 
common material for cups, in the scarcity of gold and glass, 
and the fair Rosamund drank her fatal draught from such 
an one. 
The Hungarians tell how a king’s blonde daughter falls 
in love with a shepherd, who has charmed her with a maple 
flute—still blown in Cornwall on May day to bring in the 
spring with music. This daughter went into the fields 
with her two sisters to gather the first strawberries of the 
season, their wretched old parent thinking so much more of 
his victuals than of his kingdom or his kindred that he 
promised his crown to the first who should return to him 
with a basket of the fruit. The blonde’s basket being first 
filled, her prospects maddened the brunettes with jealousy; 
hence, they killed her, buried her under a maple, and 
divided her berries between them, returning with a probable 
story that a deer had eaten her. Vain were the lamenta- 
tions of the king; vain, too, the pipings of the shepherd on 
the hill, for, blow as he might, the maple-wood made no 
answer, nor would his lady appear. On the third day the 
sheep-herder, passing the maple where the princess had 
been buried, noticed a fair new shoot that had sprung from 
173
-P-A-G-E-184
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
the tree. He cut off the branch and fashioned a new and 
better (flute), which began to sing when he put it at his 
lips, not in wordless notes, but in downright speech: ‘‘ Play, 
dearest! Once I was a king’s daughter; then a maple 
shoot; now I am a flute.’ Astonished at this disclosure, 
he rushed to the palace, demanding audience of the king, 
who was amazed, as well he might be, when, on putting the 
wood to his own mouth, he heard it say, ‘‘Play, my father! 
Once I was a king’s daughter; then a maple shoot; now 
I am a flute.’’ Wishing to test his senses, he called the 
wicked daughters and commanded that they blow into the 
instrument, but as each did so it eried, ‘‘Play, murderer! 
Once I was a king’s daughter; then a maple shoot; now I 
am a flute.’’ Realizing what a crime had been committed, 
the king drove them from his home, while the shepherd 
went back to his sheep and solaced his loneliness with the 
voice of his beloved. 
MARIGOLD 
Like other yellow flowers, the marigold was an expres- 
sion of light—‘‘the bride of the sun,’’ ‘‘the golden flower”’ 
—yet, strangely enough, it has been chosen to express 
jealousy and fawning. In one legend it is a girl who, 
consumed with envy of a successful rival in the affections 
of a young man, lost her wits and died. But while in one 
floral dictionary it stands for envy, it more clearly means 
constancy, because of its bright face, its ‘devotion to the 
sun, its cheer. Odd are the names the members of this 
family have borne: death flower, cowbloom, gouls, goulans, 
goolds, king cups, butterwort, bull flower, pool flower, care, 
horse blob, water dragon, drunkard, publican-and-sinner, 
yolg of egg, Mary bud, gold flower, shining herb, and left- 
hand-iron, the latter name coming from Provence, where 
it was suggested by the likeness of the open blossoms to a

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
shield. The Greek name, kalathos, or cup, from which 
its botanic name of caltha is derived, may indicate that 
the Greeks had their own story of its origin, and in Ger- 
many a tale survives that strongly recalls the Greek: A 
maid, Caltha, fell in love with the sun god—so deep in love 
that she lived only to see him. She would remain in the 
fields all night, that she might meet the first glance of his 
flashing eye. So consuming was her love that she wasted 
till she had become entirely a thing of spirit, rising from 
the earth and losing herself in the rays that shone about 
the being of her adoration. And where she had long stood 
the first marigold appeared, its form and color recalling 
the sun, and on its petals a drop that might have been dew 
or a tear of happiness at the maid’s translation. 
Quite other is the marigold of Mexico, for its petals are 
red—the blood of Aztecs put to death by Spaniards in their 
eagerness for land and gold. It was alleged that the Virgin 
wore the plant on her bosom; hence the name of Mary- 
gold; but a likelier origin is marais (marsh) or meer (pond, 
or lake,) since the marsh marigold, so called, elects damp 
places to enliven with its color. 
MARJORAM 
Marjoram is one of those rare plants that yield no 
poisonous quality. It not only gives spice and savor to 
viands, but was believed to have antiseptic value, and was 
therefore used in chambers of the sick and for strewing 
over church floors at funerals. The German name of the 
plant, ‘‘happy-minded,’’ and its older name of joy-of-the- 
mountain, indicate a festal rather than funereal signifi- 
eance. In Greece and Rome it was one of the hymeneal 
flowers, because Venus created it, and it is the touch of 
her fingers that lingers as a perfume) In Cyprus they

ascribe its origin to Amarakos, a page in the household 
of the king, who, passing through the palace with a jar of 
perfume in his arms, slipped on the marble floor, and 
dropped the vase, which was shattered into a thousand 
pieces. The king arose to chide him, which so terrified 
Amarakos that the life instantly went out of him, and he 
lay white and still in the bath of floral essence. From 
his burial-place arose the plant we call marjoram, cor- 
rupting it from his name—when we do not ruthlessly dub 
it origanum vulgare. 
From Cyprus the marjoram found its way to the main- 
land, and as dittany it blooms as far away as England and 
Germany. In those countries it was formerly prized as a 
charm against witcheraft, for no person who had sold 
herself to the devil could abide it. 
MELON 
For some reason this fruit stirred the ire of Elias, pos- 
sibly because he had eaten thereof and they disagreed with 
him, and on Mount Carmel, when you climb to the top, you 
shall see a field of stones which were melons once, but which 
he cursed so bitterly that they became more indigestible 
than ever and hardened into their present shape. 
A king of Tuscany was once father to triplets, whom he 
never took the trouble to look at, because his sisters, jeal- 
ous of his queen, told him they were not human, but were 
a eat, a snake, and a stick. The king believed them, cast 
his wife into prison as a witch, and ordered the progeny 
to be thrown into the sea. The gardener, to whom the 
last task was allotted, took the poor little people to his 
home, reared them as if they were children of his own, 
and taught them to raise flowers and fruits. One of the 
first fruits that came from their garden was a watermelon, 
176 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
III IIIIIIUCLHL ESIyUyCxL ESIiL—— — — LL SSSSSS==— 
so big and tempting that it was deemed fit for the king, 
so to his table it went. When he cut it, behold, its seeds 
were precious stones. ‘‘Oh, wonder!’’ roared the monarch. 
“‘Can a melon produce stones?’’ 
“*As easily as a woman may give birth to a cat, a stick, 
and a snake,’’ declared a maid of honor. 
‘*What do you mean ?’’ blustered the ruler. 
Then they labored with his primordial intellect till at 
last he understood; whereupon he released his wife, took 
his children home, and, instead of drowning his sisters, 
ended the scandal by making a public show of them at the 
stake—and incidentally exposing his preceding imbecility. 
MIGNONETTE 
To work in the garden of a summer morning, when 
the breeze, blowing over the mignonette, brings the delicate 
rapture of its odor and the hum of bees who are plundering 
its sweets, is to know a moment of old paradise. To be sure, 
the charm of the flower is in its perfume; it has no splendor 
for the eye; but its constaney and generosity of bloom en- 
dear it to every one whose patch of ground is big enough for 
heaven to brood upon. The mignonette, or sweet resada— 
meaning, to soothe—is one of the blessings we owe to the 
Orient, where it expresses health. Nor is it difficult to 
imagine, if, indeed, it is imagination that affects us in this 
ease, that lesser aches and ills are charmed away by in- 
halation of its fragrance. There are subtleties of cure, of 
stimulation and narcosis, in odors that our nose-blind race 
has forgotten. Because of its modesty, mignonette can 
be blent with almost any combination of blossoms, and be- 
cause of the readiness of its growth, it is a favorite 
wherever it is known.

  MIMOSA 
Most curious among forms of vegetation is the sensitive 
plant, that folds its leaves together and hangs as if wilted 
when it has been pinched or struck. It seems as if it were 
moved by an instinct to ‘‘play ’possum,’’ as animals will 
do to prevent their falling prey to carnivore that will not 
touch a dead body. The sensitive plant has sturdier rela- 
tives, however, to whom a pinch is no great matter. One 
of these is the Egyptian mimosa, which supplies the gum 
known as frankincense. 
In a Greek legend, the sensitive plant was the maid 
Cephisa, who inspired Pan with so violent a passion that she 
fied from him in terror. He, pursuing, caught her in his 
arms just as her appeal to the other gods for protection was 
answered in her transformation to the mimosa. In an 
old belief, the delicacy of the plant was so extreme that if 
a maid passed by after a sin, it would fold its leaves as if it 
had been touched. 
MINT 
Pluto was not a deity to inspire love, even in the heart 
of his wife, when, after long waiting, he was able to steal 
one. Men figured him as a dark and angry god, who flour- 
ished a staff as he drove unruly spirits to their last abodes 
of gloom. Pluto spent most of his time in the underworld, 
yet he did visit the light occasionally, and on one of his 
emergings he saw and loved the nymph Mintho. Now, his 
wife, Proserpine, watched him more closely than he knew; 
not that she was fond of him, but, being a woman, she could 
not endure to divide the affections of her lord. Hence at 
the first opportunity she revenged the slight he had put 
upon her by turning her rival into an herb, in which guise 
she lost some outward beauty, yet still attracted men by 
her freshness and fragrance.

Of the several varieties of mint, the catmint, or catnip, 
commends itself especially to the feline race. In an old 
belief this herb will not only make cats frolicsome, amorous, 
and full of battle, but its root, if chewed, ‘‘makes the most 
gentle person fierce and quarrelsome.’’ 
The mint called pennyroyal, which has value in the rural 
materia medica because it purifies the blood, disperses fleas, 
and, smeared on the face with vaseline and tar, keeps off 
gnats and flies, was used by witches in a malignant medicine 
which caused those who swallowed it to see double. 
MISTLETOE 
Our custom of decorating the home with mistletoe goes 
back for centuries, to the ceremonials of the Druids, and is 
a reminder of their winter custom of keeping green things 
indoors as a refuge for the spirits of the wood, exiled 
by the severities of cold and snow. Because of its pagan 
associations, mistletoe was long forbidden in the church. 
Five centuries ago, however, assemblies were held in public 
squares to greet the sacred plant, and its continued use as 
a protector against spells is reported in Worcestershire, 
where the farmer offers it to the first cow that calves after 
the new year, thereby securing his stock against illness and 
trouble for a twelvemonth. In Germany, if you will 
take the trouble to carry a sprig of mistletoe into an old 
house, the ghosts who live there will appear to you, and 
by means of it you may force them to answer your ques- 
tions. 
The symbolism of mistletoe in Druid rites was spirit, 
hence its relation to spirits, for, like the orchids, it grew 
not on the earth, but in the air, on the sacred oak; at least, 
it was most prized when found clinging to that tree. When 
the Druids required it at the end of the year, it was cut 
by a white-robed priest with a golden sickle, and was not 
179
-P-A-G-E-190
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  allowed to touch the ground, a white cloth being held for it 
as it fell. Two white bulls were then slain beneath the 
oak where it had grown, and the twigs of the parasite were 
distributed among the people, who placed them over doors, 
or twined and carved them into rings and bracelets, to keep 
off evil; for it is a remedy against fits, witches, apoplexy, 
poison, tremors, consumption, and the like. 
The wide extension of the plant is due to the birds that 
eat its sticky berries and carry its seeds from tree to tree. 
Its fruit ripens after snow begins to fly, for which perver- 
sity it may be said to entitle itself to renown for strength. 
Virgil says that Atneas could go down into Tartarus only 
on condition that he bore a mistletoe in his hand. Probably 
it kept off devils. The old Saxon name of mistl-tan means 
‘different twig’’; that is, it differs from the twig of a 
tree to which it may affix itself. But it was not always 
the lean parasite that it is to-day; it was a tree till its wood 
was used for the cross of Christ, when it shrank to its 
present proportions. The old-time monks named it ‘‘ wood 
of the cross,’’ and swallowed chips of it, or water in which 
it had been steeped, or wore fragments about their necks as 
cures for all diseases. 
Mistletoe was common in America before the landing of 
old-world peoples, and is not, therefore, an introduction 
from Europe. It was better known abroad, however, and 
to the Norsemen, as to the Druids, was fateful. 
Freya so loved her son Baldur that she asked all things 
of earth and air to cherish him. But one plant she over- 
looked : the mistletoe, hardly seen in a notch of a tree, even 
when its berries whitened. This plant grew on an aged 
oak, near Valhalla, and in the shadow of the oak Baldur 
dared the gods to harm him, offering himself to their rough 
sport, standing unmoved and unhurt when they shot their 
spears and arrows against him. Loki, jealous of the favor 
180

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
 ——————————————— 
and beauty of Baldur, disguised himself as a woman and 
asked Freya why her son never suffered pain. Freya 
told him it was because the creatures and things of the earth 
and air and water had promised to be kind to him; therefore 
nothing would bruise him or cause his blood to flow. 
“And there is nothing that can touch him?’’ Loki asked. 
“‘Nothing,’’ answered Freya, ‘‘except the mistletoe. 
But that is so small and feeble it could hurt nothing.’’ 
Loki went back to the wood in his own shape, plucked 
the stoutest twig of mistletoe he could find, trimmed off its 
leaves and berries, and sharpened its end to a point. Soon 
after, the gods again assembled about Baldur, testing his 
invulnerability against bows and slings. Hodur, the blind 
one, stood apart, and Loki went to him. ‘‘Why don’t you 
share the sport?’’ he asked. 
“*T can not see, and, besides, I have nothing to throw,’’ 
answered Hodur. 
“You can at least play at the game,’’ insisted Loki. 
““Throw this, in fashion of a spear.’’ 
He put the weapon fashioned from the mistletoe into 
Hodur’s hand, and turned his face toward the spot where 
Baldur stood. Hodur threw, and the point pierced the 
breast of the young god, stretching him lifeless on the 
earth. By the combined power of all the gods, Baldur was 
restored to life. They made the mistletoe promise never 
again to lend itself to harm, and, to make sure that it kept 
its vow, they dedicated it to Freya and gave her special 
authority over it. It promised never to do harm to any 
so long as it did not touch the earth, and that is why, 
thousands of years after, people who have never heard of 
Baldur and Hodur and Loki, hang the mistletoe in their 
houses in the season of gladness, and kiss one another as 
they pass beneath it, for it brings happiness, safety, and 
good fortune so long as it is not beneath our feet.

MORNING-GLORY 
Looking up to the new day with its mild eyes, and 
plentifully starring its vine with color, the morning-glory 
needs only perfume to be of exceeding value. It is one 
of the most persistent of plants, and, once sown, is sure 
to continue itself without other attention than the planter 
may give to uprooting the thousand offspring that gather 
about it when life renews at the end of winter. It should 
be the emblem of courage and energy, despite the tran- 
siency of the flower. That wild form known to the Eng- 
lish as large bindweed, but to the French as belle of the 
day, appears less beautiful when we learn that, mashed or 
boiled, it was applied to vulgar swellings that disfigure the 
human countenance. Poetry should have dissevered morn- 
ing glory from the mumps. Gerarde, however, will not 
sanction it for even this purpose, for, says he, ‘‘It is not 
fit for medicine, and unprofitable weeds and hurtful to 
each thing that groweth next them, and were only adminis- 
tered by runnagat physickmongers, quacksalvers, old women 
leeches, abusers of physick and deceivers of people.”’ 
Still, the English country folk were not afraid of it: they 
even pickled the young shoots of sea bindweed as a sub- 
stitute for samphire. 
MOSS 
The modesty of moss has not led to its neglect by the 
myth-makers, for we know that the supercilium veneris, 
the hair moss used by Lapps for bedding, is claimed for 
both Freya and for Thor’s wife, Sif. We are told, also, 
that the byrum, now spread over walls of Jerusalem, is the 
hyssop of Solomon; and as hyssop had a medicinal worth, 
it may have been the particular moss that covered the cross 
of King Oswald, in Northumbria, and worked miracles 
182
-P-A-G-E-193
Ce eee 
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
after his death. For example, a citizen crossing the ice 
toward this venerated object fell and broke his arm, where- 
upon a friend tore some of the vegetation from the cross, 
clapped it upon the injured member, and the bones knit 
instantly. Another moss of a marvellous sort is that which 
grows on a human skull in a church-yard, for this is a cure 
for ‘‘chin cough”’ and fits. 
Lycopodium selago, or club nose, probably the golden 
herb or cloth of gold of the Druids, was likewise remarkable, 
not as a medicine, but as a protection against unearthly 
creatures and black magic; only, it must be gathered by a 
person whose feet were clean as well as bare, and who had 
offered sacrifices of bread and wine. Thus qualified, he 
picked the moss with his right hand pushed through his 
left sleeve, and placed it in a new cloth. The Druid nuns 
on the island of Sain, in the Loire, made the gathering yet 
more difficult and interesting when they required the moss 
for the altars of Ceridwen, the Isis of their faith, or their 
warriors asked it to poison arrows. The maid who gath- 
ered it was stripped of clothing, that she might better per- 
sonify the moon. She must avoid iron, for if that touched 
the moss, calamity was near. The selago being found, a 
circle was drawn about it, and she uprooted the moss with 
the tip of her little finger, her hand being covered, mean- 
time, with a white cloth never used before. 
Until our theatres were ‘‘electrified,’’? lycopodium was 
an agent in imparting the delightful terrors of a storm— 
that, and cannon-balls rolling down zigzag troughs to 
simulate thunder, and peas shaken in a box to imitate the 
sound of rain; for dried club moss ignites almost like 
powder. 
The moss wives of German lore are good fairies who 
live in hollow trees, couch on moss, and when startled 
hide themselves in this green growth. Their time is largely

oceupied in weaving moss into the most delicate fabrics, 
soft as silk, luminous as velvet, and colored in the green, 
gold, brown, and red of the woods. When a person has 
done a kindness to them, or they have taken him under 
their protection, they prove their interest by embroidering 
for him one of these moss cloaks. They give other benefac- 
tions, too, for a poor child who had climbed the Fichtel- 
birge to gather strawberries for her sick mother, was met 
by a tiny moss wife who asked for some of the berries. The 
child cheerfully allowed the little creature to take her fill 
from the basket. On reaching home she found that all the 
remaining berries had turned to gold. 
MOTHERWORT 
Drink motherwort and live to be a source of continuous 
astonishment and grief to waiting heirs. Its English name 
denotes its medicinal value for women, and in Japan it is 
also a herb of life. A certain stream in that country 
courses down a hill that is covered with this plant, and 
people drinking of the waters are wonderfully preserved 
and endowed with long life. Saki, or Japanese brandy, is 
supposed to contain a wee bit of motherwort, its flowers 
being dipped into the liquor; and a beer is also brewed 
from them. The Japanese motherwort festival, on the 
ninth day of the ninth month, is signalized by the drink- 
ing of these fluids, and mixing flowers of the wort with 
rice. Cups of saki are dressed with the flowers that 
neighbors pass from hand to hand with wishes for a long 
life. 
MULBERRY 
The Greeks dedicated the mulberry to Minerva, because 
of some attribute of wisdom that its growers have not 
always shown, for when James I. introduced the tree into

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    England in 1605, to raise silkworms and create a new 
industry, he brought in the black mulberry, which the 
worm will not eat, instead of the white. An equally disas- 
trous attempt to introduce it into the United States involved , 
many farmers and nurserymen in loss. One of the trees 
early grown in this country was planted at Clay Court 
House in 1840 by a Scotch peddler who was taken ill 
in that place, and in the intervals of his gripes he prayed 
for some sedative, or even poison, for he was so deep in 
misery that he desired his death. As if in answer to his 
prayer, a small plant intruded itself on his notice: a plant 
of minty and therapeutic odor—pennyroyal, probably— 
which he eagerly bit upon. His torment was appeased, and 
in gratitude he marked the place by planting a mulberry 
seed he had brought from Scotland. Milton’s tree at Cam- 
bridge still bears fruit, but the mulberry planted by 
Shakespeare in his Stratford garden was cut down by the 
man who bought the property, because people bothered him 
so by asking to look at it. The mulberry is worshipped 
outright in Burmah, where the European superstition is 
not shared: namely, that the devil blacks his boots with the 
berries. In the east it is an innocent custom to make a 
thick preserve from it on the 15th of the first month, because 
a fairy, in payment for that dainty, engaged with one 
Chang Ching to make his mulberries yield an hundredfold 
more than they had ever done before, and he had a won- 
drous crop of silk in consequence. 
Pyramus and Thisbe are the classic forerunners of 
Romeo and Juliet. These two young Babylonian lovers 
were parted by their cruel parents, yet contrived to meet 
secretly, and between-whiles they breathed affection through 
a chink in the dividing wall. Their favorite tryst was in 
the shade of a white mulberry at the tomb of Ninus, out- 
side of the city gates. One day Thisbe, having first 
arrived, was frightened by a lion that made its appear-

ance, fresh from the plunder of a sheepfold. She sought 
refuge in a cave, but in her haste she let fall her veil. It 
was torn by the claws of the beast and drabbled in the 
blood of a lamb it had slain, and when Pyranus discov- 
ered it, he set up a loud lament, convinced that he had 
lost the maid. ‘‘Since you are gone,’’ he cried, ‘‘my blood 
shall mingle with yours.’’ After moistening the veil with 
his tears, he plunged his sword into his heart. After wait- 
ing till she felt sure the lion had gone, Thisbe ventured 
from her hiding place and came to the tree once more. A 
human form was lying under the mulberry. It was her 
Pyramus, and as she caught his head to her bosom the last 
glance of his glazing eye was fixed on her. Exclaiming, 
“As love and death have united us, let us be buried in one 
tomb,’’ she struck the steel into her own soft breast, with 
such force that the blood spouted over the berries hanging 
overhead. As her eyes turned toward the heaven, blue 
and calm beyond the branches that shadowed her, she 
gasped, ‘‘You tree, bear witness to the wrongs our parents 
have done to us. Let your berries be stained with our blood 
in token of their misdoing.’? The lovers were buried to- 
gether and since that day the mulberry has been red. 
MUSTARD 
As a condiment, mustard has been known to men for 
centuries. It is noted in parable, for the smallness of its 
seed and the comparative consequence of the plant make it 
a type of small beginnings and large endings. There is a 
parable by Buddha which tells how a mother, bereft of her 
child, carried the little body from house to house, imploring 
the people to heal it. To a wise man she put her constant 
inquiry, ‘‘My lord and master, what medicine will heal 
my boy?’’ 
186

——______} 
Looking on the still face, he answered, ‘‘He requires 
a handful of mustard-seed from a house where no child, 
husband, parent, or servant has died.’’ 
She hurried on, but wherever she asked, ‘‘ Has there been 
no death in this house?’’ the answer would be, ‘‘ Assuredly, 
for the living are few and the dead a multitude.’’ 
Day followed day; still her search promised no ending. 
She understood its uselessness at last, and knew the wisdom 
of the physician, for she realized the selfishness of her grief. 
Others had suffered and sorrowed as much as she. So 
she parted from the dead child in a wood, and, going back 
to the wise man, confessed that she had not found the 
mustard-seed, but had found his meaning. 
“*You thought that you alone had lost a son,’’ said he, 
“but death rules all.’’ 
In India the mustard symbolizes generation, and it is 
told that a farmer, having plowed over the site of a temple 
in which the nymph Bakawali had dwelt immovable for 
twelve years, her body having been transformed to marble, 
sowed mustard over the freshened earth. This, ripening, 
was eaten by his wife, who till then had been childless. 
The pair soon became the parents of a little one, lovely as 
a nymph, whom they named Bakawali, and who was be- 
lieved to be no less than the original Bakawali, still in 
progress through the states of being. 
MYRRH 
Gum of balsamodendron is one of the precious sub- 
stances used in religious observances, and its employment 
for this purpose began at least two thousand years ago. 
It blended with the oil wherewith the priests were anointed, 
anciently, and ran down the beards of Aaron and his sons 
when they were exalted to leadership. With it the Jews 
187

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
gave fragrance and sanctity to the tabernacle, the ark, the 
altars, the cups, and other holy vessels, During the year 
required for the purification of women, myrrh was employed 
for the first six months and other perfumes after. It is a 
tradition that Nicodemus bought a hundredweight of myrrh 
and aloes in which to embalm the body of Christ, follow- 
ing a custom of the Egyptians. Incense smoked before the 
sun god at Heliopolis thrice a day, myrrh being chosen 
for the noon offering, another resin at daybreak, and a 
blend of aromatics at evening; and the Persian kings re- 
garded themselves as sufficiently holy to wear myrrh and 
labyzus in their crowns. Indeed, the ceremonial use of the 
gum by royalty occurred so lately as the reign of George 
III., who made in the royal chapel a ‘‘usual offering’’ of 
gold, frankincense, and myrrh, in memory, ostensibly, of 
the gifts that the wise men laid at the feet of the infant 
Christ. 
Yet, if ancient legend be true, myrrh is a sufficiently 
jrreligious matter, being no less than the tears of that 
wretched Myrrha who, conceiving an unnatural attachment 
for her own father, the king of Cyprus, was pursued by him 
out of his kingdom. Recovering her reason in exile, and 
wandering for months in hostile deserts, she came at last to 
the Saban fields, in Arabia, and there, her strength gone, 
she implored the gods both to pardon and to punish. The 
gods changed her into myrrh, in which guise she remains, 
weeping tears perfumed of repentance. 
MYRTLE 
Myrtle, which figures so largely in poetry and myth, 
is thought by some to be the bilberry or whortleberry, or 
bay. Indeed, the bay is a variety of myrtle, and has 
among its congeners the giant eucalyptus, the guava, pi- 
188
-P-A-G-E-199
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
mento, clove, and pomegranate. There is reason to 
assume, however, that the myrtle of the ancients was the 
myrtle that abounds in southern Europe and has extended 
into other lands. In its human origin it was Myrtilus, the 
rogue son of Mercury, who took a bribe from Pelops to pull 
a pin from his master’s chariot-wheel. This enabled Pelops 
to win a race and thereby claim his master’s daughter. 
The master showed scant gratitude, for he seized the aston- 
ished young rascal and incontinently flung him into the 
sea, scorning the traitor he had made. But the sea would 
none of him, either, and tossed him ashore, where, in mercy, 
his human form was taken from him, and he became a tree. 
In another legend the myrtle, which loves salt air, is a 
creation of Venus, who was known in some states of Greece 
as Myrtilla, or Myrtea, and whose head was decked with it 
when Paris judged her most beautiful of the gods. In that 
legend a girl Myrene, who had been carried from home 
by a robber band, was rescued by Venus, who made her 
priestess in her temple. During one of the festivals, My- 
rene chanced to see a member of the pirate crew, and in 
her rage for vengeance pointed him out to her lover, promis- 
ing to yield to his entreaties if he would put the robber to 
the sword. The lover succeeded, but Venus, angered by 
her priestess’s desertion, cast the young man into a fatal 
illness and changed Myrene into the myrtle. When Venus 
found that her wayward son, Cupid, had fallen in love with 
Psyche, it was with a myrtle rod that she beat the weeping 
nymph, and again, when pursued by satyrs, it was a myrtle 
that received her into its friendly shadow. In a legend 
possibly yet older, the myrtle was created by Minerva, and 
the subject of the metamorphosis was Myrsine, a sprightly 
maid who had beaten the goddess in a foot-race. 
Rogero, the Moorish knight, landing from his hippogrift 
on an unknown coast, tied his steed to a myrtle tree, while 
189  
-P-A-G-E-200
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    he slaked his thirst at a fountain that bubbled forth in a 
neglected garden. He had laid aside his helmet, shield, 
and weapons to rest, when a voice issued from the tree, 
saying, ‘‘Do I not suffer enough, that I must endure this 
rudeness?’’ The knight, hurrying to untie his winged 
monster, answered, ‘‘ Whatever you are, tree or mortal, I 
ask forgiveness for my unwitting fault, and am ready to do 
what I can to repair it.’’? Tears, like thin gum, trickled 
down the bark, and the tree spoke again: ‘‘I am Astolpho, 
paladin of France and by renown one of the bravest. Re- 
turning from the east, we reached the castle of dreaded 
Alcina, who took me, a willing subject, to her island seat. 
There we passed happy days till, tiring of me, as of all who 
yield to her, she changed me to this form: a myrtle. Of my 
friends, some are here as cedars, olives, palms; some she 
changed to springs and some to rocks and some to beasts. 
Beware, for this may be your fate.’’ 
Rogero attached too little importance to the warning. 
He, too, met Alcina, and, bewildered by her beauty, suffered 
himself to be led to her palace, with its walls of gold and 
pillars of diamond. In the end he also was changed into a 
myrtle; but, recovering his human form through white 
magic as powerful as her black, he avenged himself on the 
enchantress and released Astolpho and his friends. 
To the Greeks, myrtle was an emblem of immortality. 
because it kept green throughout the year; and because the 
work of great men is immortal, in humanity’s conceit, the 
populace bound myrtles on their favorites’ brows when they 
had produced successful plays and epics. In the markets a 
large space was always reserved for the sale of these shrubs 
and they figured in feasts and ceremonies. One of the 
wreaths of myrtle carried in the procession of Europa at 
Corinth measured ten feet in diameter. 
Being a tree of love, the myrtle was viewed askant by 
the pious of the ancient world. When the festival of the 
190

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
Bona Dea came around, it was allowable for the Romans 
to use every plant, flower, and leaf in the decorations, save 
only the myrtle, which was barred on the ground that it 
encouraged sensuality. Yet the Greeks wore the leaves not 
only in their celebrations, but in their religious mysteries. 
The custom of crowning people with myrtle, especially 
brides, was passed on by the Romans to the Jews, and by 
them to the Germans, who are fond of it as a wedding 
ornament, and to the Bohemians who employ it contrari- 
wise for funerals—a lovely custom, this bowering of the 
dead in green, signifying immortality. To the Jews, who 
used myrtle in their feast of tabernacles, and to their rela- 
tives, the Arabs, the myrtle was reminder of the bounty of 
deity when Adam was expelled from paradise, for the first 
father was allowed to take with him wheat, chief of foods; 
date, chief of fruits; and myrtle, chief of scented flowers. 
NARCISSUS 
Narcissus is that Narkissos of the ancients, a seemly 
youth who won the love of Echo, but did not love her in 
return. In despair, she faded to a voice, and you shall 
hear her calling, sadly, in waste places. But the youth 
had his punishment: having caught sight of his own reflec- 
tion in a spring, he was lured back to lie on its brink for 
hours, admiring the face he saw there. He would not eat 
nor sleep for love of the image, and worshipped so ardently 
that he died of sheer weakness; or he may have fallen 
forward into the spring and been drowned. When the 
nymphs came to remove the body to the funeral pyre, they 
found no corpse, but in its stead the white flower we call 
poet’s narcissus. It came at once into the favor of the 
gods and men and was planted everywhere. Pluto used 
it to entice Proserpine to hell, or else to so dull and drowse 
her senses and those of her attendants that her danger

was not seen. In the Greek belief, it wreathed the harsh 
locks of the Eumenides. It also starred the brows of 
the Fates, and when the dead went into the presence of the 
gods of the underworld, they carried crowns of narcissus 
that those who mourned had placed in their white hands 
when the last good-byes were said.- 
We learn from Sophocles that narcissus was the crown 
vf the goddesses on Olympus, blooming constantly, moist 
and fragrant with the dew of heaven. If the Greeks wove 
the narcissus about the brows of dreaded Dis and the Furies, 
if they placed it in the coffins of their dead, it was because 
it gave off an evil emanation, producing dulness, madness, 
and death. Indeed, narke, the Greek word from which the 
flower really takes its name, signifies narcotic. 
NETTLE 
Tender-handed, grasp the nettle, and it stings you for your pains. 
Grasp it like a man of mettle, and it soft as silk remains. 
This ancient saw many good people believe and take on 
other men’s authority, for the nettle is an irritating plant, 
its stems being covered with fine, sharp hairs that have 
a poisonous effect on the skin they pierce. It is, or was, 
occasionally stewed into a tea by country women and ad- 
ministered to the helpless and unfortunate as a cure for 
anything that might be the matter with them. It is one of 
the five bitter herbs which the Jews were commanded to 
eat at the Passover. The Roman nettle, that thrives in 
England, was planted there by Cesar’s soldiers, who, not 
having breeches thick enough to enable them to withstand 
the climate, suffered much in the cold, raw fogs; so, when 
their legs were numb they plucked nettles and gave those 
members such a scouring that they burned and smarted 
gloriously for the rest of the day.

  OAK 
In the speech and letters of all men, the oak is the 
symbol of strength. It was Jove’s tree; the Thunderer’s 
of the North, no less; Merlin worked his enchantments 
in its shade; beneath it the Druids held their mystic rites. 
The Hebrews held it in liking, for under it Abraham re- 
ceived the angels; Saul, his sons, and Deborih were buried 
beneath it; Jacob hid in one of them the Shechem idols; 
it was an oak from which Absalom was hung by the hair; 
the anger of Ezekiel was roused by the images of wrong 
gods that ‘‘stood in every thick oak’’; and in its shadow 
towered the angel who spoke to Gideon. Doubtless it was 
the service which this excellent tree has given to mankind 
that keeps it in use in oratory and poem, as it is useful in 
the arts. It has furnished us with house, ship, arm, tool, 
funnel, and food. 
Back in the golden age the oaks dripped honey, and men 
lived in peace and comfort with no shelter but their boughs. 
In the silver age they left these coverts and stripped away 
the branches for their huts, thus isolating themselves and 
departing from their primitive communism. In the brazen 
age they shaped from the wood handles for their weapons. 
In the iron age, the age of crime and violence and greed, 
the oaks were wrenched from the hills for battle-ships, aid- 
ing to curse where once they blessed. Hrisichthon, the law- 
less and irreverent, ordered his servants to fell an oak that 
stood in a grove of Ceres. They, fearing the anger of the 
gods for such a sacrilege, debated till Erisichthon, whose 
anger was not to be slighted, either, grasped the ax from 
the hands of the unwilling woodmen and assailed the trunk 
himself. A spectator who reached forward to take away 
the implement caught the blow of the ax on his neck, so 
that his head rolled at the tree’s foot and bathed the roots 
18 193  
-P-A-G-E-204
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    in blood. Now furious, Erisichthon attacked the oak with 
such energy that it fell, amid the cries of the beholders. 
But he enjoyed no triumph from this act. From the fallen 
body of the tree came a voice saying, ‘‘I who live in this 
tree am a nymph of Ceres, and in my death hour I warn 
you of punishment.’’ Retribution came speedily. The 
goddess whose nymph had been so cruelly slain condemned 
the cutter to unending hunger. He squandered all his for- 
tune on food; he ate continually; yet nothing nourished 
him, and he died at last, gnawing at his own flesh. An- 
other instance of the speaking tree is found in the oaks of 
Dodona, which retained their power to talk, even after cut- 
ting, for the prow of the Argo, being fashioned from one of 
them, directed the crew and warned Jason to purge himself 
of the murder of Absyrtus. 
Of old it was noticed that oaks were oftener struck by 
lightning than were most other trees, hence it was supposed 
that Jupiter launched his arrows at them in warning, 
when he would express his displeasure at the perversity of 
the human race, the oaks being worthier and stronger to 
receive these bolts than other objects. The oak known as 
the holm, or ilex, a funeral tree in which the ravens croaked 
forebodings, ‘‘drew lightning’’ to that degree that ancient 
farmers planted it as a lightning rod, or spite vent for the 
gods, which may account for its sombre reputation. When 
Christ’s fate was known in the forest the trees held council 
and resolved not to lend their wood for the execution. 
Every tree that the ax-men tried to cut, splintered and 
broke, or dulled the tool with knots, till the ilex was 
reached. That alone remained whole, and of that the in- 
strument of death was shaped; but though it thus became 
accursed, Jesus forgave it as content to die with Him, and 
in the shade of an ilex he reappeared to the saints. 
The Greek drus, a tree, gave the name to dryads, and 
194
-P-A-G-E-205
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
later to Druids; and belief in dryads merged into a faith 
in fairies, the northward progress of this belief being trace- 
able into far countries. These fairies affected oaks, making 
their homes in hollow trunks and going in and out by the 
holes where branches had fallen; hence it is healing to 
touch the ‘‘fairy doors’’ with a diseased part, if church-bells 
have not driven the elves away. The barbarians thought 
so much of a certain oak in Hesse that St. Boniface swore 
to cut it down. A tree so esteemed could be nothing less 
than an idol. As he laid his ax to the trunk, the heathen 
stood afar off, looking to see him maimed or blinded, cursing 
him under their breath, yet too frightened for interference. 
When half-severed the great creature trembled, and it 
seemed as if a blade had flashed from the sky, for of a 
sudden it split into four equal pieces, and came to the 
earth spread apart, like petals of a great flower. Now, 
there may have been some who saw in this no greater favor 
for the new gods than the old, but the saint claimed it as 
a show of approval for his effort, and several were con- 
verted on the spot; so in a few days the timbers of Thor’s 
oak were hewn into an oratory, where they celebrated the 
new faith. Other oaks were resanctified from the worship 
of Thor to that of Christ by carving crosses on their stems, 
and legend confuses us when we find that whereas the fair- 
jes avoided the signs of the Christian faith in some parts 
of the world, in others they fied to these protected trees, 
even as men did. In one pathetic happening, we find the 
tale of Apollo and Daphne transferred to Germany: A 
young farmer marries an elf, believing her human, but 
when he embraces her she changes suddenly into an unre- 
sponsive oak. If we pass eastward from Germany the oak 
is still a tree of legend, and among the blonde Lithuanians 
we discover traces of their ancient forest worship. They 
were a quiet people, even when savagery encompassed them, 
195

 ———————————————————_—_—_——————————— 
and were much buried in woods, which they worshipped as 
abodes of deities—secretly worship to this day in isolated 
communities. Offerings from the people were placed at 
the feet of the biggest oaks, and the chief priest, or krive, 
known also as judge of judges, headed a hierarchy of no less 
than seventeen orders of priests and elders of forest wor- 
ship. Lithuania was not christened till the fifteenth cen- 
tury. 
Despite these heathen practices and associations, despite 
the ancient belief that from it came the race of men, the oak 
presently became acceptable to disciples in the new faith, 
and was early regarded as the tree of Mary. In a Greek 
legend its roots went down to hell; but in early Christian 
lore its boughs are heard praying to heaven. The druide, 
as the Gaels called the oak, was sought by the very ones who 
had rebuked the popular affection for it. In Ireland St. 
Bridget at Kildare abode in ‘‘the cell of an oak’’ and 
founded there the first religious community of women in 
that island; at Kenmare, St. Columba had her favorite oak, 
and a tanner who had impudently peeled the bark from it 
to season leather for shoes was smitten with leprosy for his 
insolence; another saint, Colman, was the guardian of an 
oak, a fragment of which kept in the mouth, safeguarded 
the faithful against hanging, if they had been forgetful in 
their morals. Augustine chose an oak for his oratory, also, 
when he addressed King Ethelbert to convert him. The 
chair of St. Peter, in the Vatican, is an oak board in a 
frame of acacia. 
It was to be expected that superstitious people would 
ascribe virtues to a tree that meant so much for their faith, 
their practices and their history, hence even in our country 
we find survivals of that belief in the curability of diseases 
by pushing the patient no longer through the ‘‘fairy doors,’’ 
but through the forks of an oak, or a gap made artificially,

with axes, and thereafter to be repaired with loam. The 
tree is benignant even to the Wandering Jew, for he can 
have no rest unless he finds two oak trees growing in the 
form of a cross. There he can fling himself to the ground 
and take the sleep that has been denied to him for months. 
St. Anthony’s fire, toothache, and other disorders were 
cured by the wood, bark, or even by the moral influence of 
the oak, and people fastened locks of their hair to it when 
they sought its help, and fed its galls to spavined horses. 
In Finland they tell of an oak so tough that it grew 
only bigger and stouter when attacked by woodmen with 
their saws and axes—a legend that embodies popular re- 
spect for the tree: a respect that in Saxony took shape in 
a law forbidding its injury. Similar protection was given 
to the Stock am Hisen, in Vienna, an ancient tree into which 
every apprentice, starting on his year of wandering, after 
the good Teuton fashion, thrust a nail for luck. It is the 
survivor of a holy grove in which, originally, the cathedral 
stood. Many are these oaks of history and observance: 
the Parliament oak; the oak of Robin Hood; John Lack- 
land’s oak in Sherwood Forest; William Rufus’s in New 
Forest; the Volkenrode oak of Gotha; the oak at Saintes, 
France, estimated to be two thousand years old; Westman’s 
oak of Dartmoor; the oak of Dorset, sixty-eight feet around, 
with a chamber sixteen feet wide in its trunk, that was 
fitted as an ale-house; the Wadsworth oak on Genesee river ; 
the oak at Flushing, New York, that served George Fox 
as a Quaker meeting-house; the oak at Natick, Massachu- 
setts, a ‘‘peace tree’’ of the Indians and a shelter for Eliot 
when he translated the Bible into Algonquin. The oak 
that inspired Morris to his adjuration, ‘‘ Woodman, spare 
that tree,’’ grew, not as might be supposed, on his premises, 
but in St. Paul’s churchyard, a few steps from roaring 
Broadway.

    In a tradition of the Mission Indians, Wyot, son of 
Night and Earth, guardian of all things, told of his death 
ten months in advance—‘‘when the great star rises and 
the grass is high.’’? He bade his people gather shoots of 
bushes and make a basket for his ashes, for he had taught 
the arts to them; and when they burned his body and en- 
tered on a season of mourning his spirit did not suffer in 
the fire: it ascended to the skies and became the moon, or, 
in another version, a bright star, believed to be Vega. The 
frog, then a creature fair to look on, with flesh white and 
red, and big eyes, had yet thin and ugly legs, and the sight 
of men with legs more shapely made her jealous and wishful 
to injure them; hence, when Wyot was drinking at a spring 
she fouled the water and spat in it three times, accusing 
him of her defects of shape. Wyot drank the water and 
became ill, dying as he had said, in May, with a promise 
that from his ashes should spring a precious gift to all his 
children. And while his soul went skyward his mortal part 
became the oak. Seeing it fair and strong, the people who 
had cherished it said to the crow, ‘‘Go to the great star 
and find Wyot, that we may know all the uses of the tree 
he has given to us.’’ The crow flew high, but came back; 
then the eagle was dispatched, and he, too, returned with- 
out a message; all the birds in turn undertook the errand, 
but none was strong enough to reach the star. Finally the 
humming-bird was told to seek the absent one, and he flew 
from the earth with the speed and straightness of an arrow. 
After some days he reappeared and gave the words of 
Wyot: ‘‘The tree I have given to you with my body is 
for the sustenance of all people and animals and birds. 
Men will make flour of its nuts and this flour can be made 
into cakes.’ So the feast of acorns became a yearly ordi- 
nance, and the acorn is still a food of the Mississippi 
Indians.

It is recorded that Jeanne d’Are went to her death the 
sooner because she had been accused of frequenting the 
Fairy Oak of Bourlemont, hanging it with garlands, danc- 
ing and skipping about it during mass, and reviving the 
worship of its spirit, who in return, had given to her the 
charmed sword and banner with which she led her country- 
men to victory. But of late centuries it is oftener the 
saints who have appeared in the trees, and so late as the 
nineteenth we hear of a girl, frightened by thunder, taking 
refuge under an oak on the Roman Campagna—the most 
dangerous place one can choose in a storm, for tall trees 
draw the lightning—and begging the Virgin to save her 
from the elements. The Virgin, neglecting the rest of Italy 
to protect one who had presence of mind to pray to her, 
appeared and remained beside the young woman, allaying 
her fright and keeping every drop of rain from the leaves, 
although it poured a deluge roundabout. 
There used to stand in Bologna a famous cork tree, a 
variety of oak, in which a pious shepherd placed a statue 
of the Virgin. That was well enough, save that the young 
man had thoughtlessly borrowed the image from a church, 
without asking leave of the clergy, because he conceived that 
they were neglecting it. And to this tree he would repair 
every day and play his flute before the Virgin. Having 
been caught in the act, and the robbery being brought home 
to him, he was sentenced to death, and the statue was taken 
back to the church; but that night it indignantly stalked 
out of the building, away from the keeping of the neglectful 
fathers, and, opening the prison door, released the inno- 
cent thief, so they were found together in the tree next day. 
They were taken down, locked up, but the miracle was re- 
peated, until the people were convinced that it was the 
Virgin’s will, so the tree became a shrine. Perhaps from

that incident began the practice. of hanging small images 
of the Virgin in oak trees in country districts. 
Father Bernardo, a holy hermit who lived far from 
cities, was often besought to solve moral problems and guide 
his people in worldly transactions. Though his time was 
mostly spent in prayer, he derived comfort from his ‘‘two 
daughters’’: terms playfully applied to little Mary, the 
daughter of a vine-dresser, who brought delicacies to soften 
the hardness of his fare and cheer him with her prattle, and 
a big oak that defended his hut from snow and rain. 
This oak was his daily companion. He watered its roots 
if it thirsted, talked to it, caressed it, and fancied its 
thanks in the murmur of its leaves. Once, when the coun- 
try had been devastated by freshets that swept away his 
cabin, he found refuge in the tree, and thither went the 
speaking ‘‘daughter,’’ carrying food and cover, for after 
three days of imprisonment among the branches he was like 
to die. Several lumbermen wanted to eut the tree into 
beams, but Bernardo would never consent, and during his 
life the oak suffered no injury. As his last days drew 
near he implored heaven to mark ‘‘his two daughters’? in 
some way to signify the use and beauty of their lives, but 
at first it did not appear as if this were to be done, for 
Mary became the wife of an artisan, and the big oak 
was at last sacrificed for-its wood, which Mary’s father 
converted into wine casks. As the young woman sat nurs- 
ing her infant before one of these casks a handsome stranger 
drew near, just as the older boy of Mary ran to her with a 
little cross he had fashioned from a couple of sticks. As 
if struck by the incident, the young man asked leave to 
make a picture of the group. Hardly waiting permission, 
indeed, he seized the cover of the cask and on its smooth 
surface outlined the picture known to the world as the 
‘‘Madonna delle Sedia.’’ For the young man was Raphael.

    And thus the prayer of Father Bernardo was answered,

OLEANDER 
In an humble home in Spain a girl lay ill of fever: 
Her mother had done what her small means allowed for her 
comfort, yet the patient made no gain toward recovery. 
Reduced almost to illness herself by the sense of unavailing 
service, the mother fell on her knees at the bedside and 
offered a fervent prayer to St. Joseph for the sufferer’s 
recovery. A reviving shock of joy went through her when 
she raised her head and found the room shining in a rosy 
light that seemed to emanate from a figure which bent 
above the child—a man of lofty aspect. The stranger 
placed on the child’s breast a branch of flowering oleander, 
pink and unfading, as if freshly plucked in paradise. Then 
the light faded, and when the mother rubbed her eyes to 
see the man more clearly and thank him for his coming, 
the chamber was empty, save of the patient and herself. 
But she saw that the girl was in a calm sleep, the first | 
since her illness, and bowed her head anew with tears of 
gratitude. The recovery was swift, and from that day the 
oleander became the flower of St. Joseph. 
In spite of this legend, the plant has an unpleasing repu- 
tation. We of the north, who prize it for its beauty and 
spend much for greenhouse specimens, do not suffer from 
its presence, but in Greece and Italy it was a funeral plant, 
and poison to cattle. The Hindu calls it the horse-killer; 
but he so appreciates its charm that he decorates his tem- 
ples with it, and of its lovely clusters he makes wreaths 
for the brows of his dead when they go to the burning 
ghat.

OLIVE 
The olive is significant of security and peace, because 
it was with the olive-branch that the dove returned to the 
ark, and it is of record in holy writ because it figures in the 
parable of Jotham. Its oil has been in use for thousands 
of years, and was the base of those perfumed ointments 
sold for so large a price in Rome and Athens. !t kept alight 
the lamps in the Tabernacle. It anointed the heads of 
priests and kings. When peace was sought between war- 
ring nations, the messengers bore olive-branches, as did 
the Athenian who sought the Delphic oracle, or waved them 
in the temples of Artemis to avert the plague. Young 
saplings that rise about the parent stem afford our com- 
mon simile of olive branches, as applied to offspring. 
It is Minerva’s tree—the olive. She bade it rise from 
the earth when Neptune caused a salt spring to open on 
the Akropolis. For in the contest between Athena and 
Poseidon for possession of the city that afterward took 
her name, the deities declared that whichever of the twain 
bestowed upon it the gift best worth men’s acceptance 
should command the city’s worship. Poseidon came out 
of his element to create the horse; but Athena created the 
olive, and every gourmet owes a silent thanks to her as he 
nibbles its fruit or pours its oil upon his salad. And so 
the city went to Athena, not Poseidon. The commoners of 
the city believed its destinies inwrought with that of the 
olive, so the lamps of their Parthenon were lighted with its 
oil; and as the favor it enjoyed in Athens led to its being 
planted roundabout, it came into use to mark corners and 
boundaries of estates. The general reverence led Solon 
to promulgate a law for its planting, as the symbol of 
freedom, hope, mercy, prayer, purity, and order. In 
neighboring Italy this sanctity continues to our day, for a

    branch of olive hung above a door will keep out devils and 
wizards. In the Temple at Jerusalem, the doors, posts, 
and cherubim were of its wood; and the importance of the 
tree is suggested in the name of Mount of Olives, and 
Gethsemane, the latter word meaning ‘‘olive-oil press.’’ 
When Adam felt his end approaching he sent Seth, 
his son, to the gates of paradise for the promised oil of 
mercy. Although four hundred and thirty-two years had 
passed since the exile, the path made by Adam through the 
fields and woods was as plain as if marked but the day 
before, for no grass might grow where feet accursed of God 
had trodden. Seth walked on and on till at last he saw 
a tree of wondrous size and beauty, standing in an open 
place where four great rivers sprang from a single foun- 
tain. Although it bore not a leaf, the tree was of com- 
manding height and grace. A serpent twined about its 
trunk (here we see a likeness to Ygdrasil), and in its top- 
most branches sat a child in shining vestments: the child 
appointed by heaven to give the oil of mercy when the time 
for pardon should have come. As Seth looked upon these 
things and basked in the loveliness of the landscape, an 
angel advanced from the tree, bringing three seeds from 
the forbidden fruit, which were to be placed in Adam’s 
mouth when he was buried. So when Adam died, Seth did 
as the angel commanded, and lo, from the seeds sprang 
three several trees: a cypress, a cedar, and an olive. When 
Moses started on his wanderings through the wilderness, © 
he took these saplings to the Valley of Consolation, the 
tears and blood of the consecrated keeping them alive in the 
forty years of marching up and down through the little 
state. One of them was the burning bush in which Moses 
saw the Lord. When, at last, the saplings that had rooted 
in the mouth of Adam were planted, they grew, within 
thirty years, into a single tree, beneath which David wept 
203

    for his sins. Solomon, more philosophic and practical, saw 
its chief beauty in use, and, like any modern investigator, 
hewed it down to see what manner of timber it would 
make. It seemed to be sound, but, strangely enough, no 
amount of shaping and trimming could make it fit its place 
as a beam for the Temple in Jerusalem, and, finding it 
blessed or cursed with some uncanny quality that kept it 
from the use of men, Solomon preserved it as a sacred relic 
in the grounds of the Tabernacle itself. Here one day a 
woman of the Romans, one Maximilia, carelessly leaned 
against it, then sprang away in fright, erying, ‘‘ Jesus 
Christ, thou son of God, help me!’’ for flame had leaped 
from it and ignited her robes. At the call the fire ceased, 
but the Jews, who had seen and heard, said she was a witch. 
““T'o say that Jehovah had a son is blasphemy,’’ said they. 
‘‘We will hunt this woman from the city.’’ And they did 
so. Years afterward the incident came to mind again, 
for this was the first speaking of the words, ‘‘Jesus Christ.’’ 
Finally, the timber was thrown into a marsh, where the 
queen of Sheba crossed it, to dry ground, when she visited 
Jerusalem. As her feet rested there a vision arose before 
her, and she saw Christ suspended on a cross at the hill-top, 
undergoing shameful death. And so it came to pass, for 
after a time the log floated to the surface of the morass 
again, and on the night of the betrayal it was lifted out 
and shaped into the cross, some say by the hand of Christ 
Himself. The pale color of the olive leaves is due to their 
still reflecting the glory that shone on them when the 
Sufferer was transfigured on Olivet. 
THE ONION AND ITS KIND 
That fragrant lily we call the onion has long been 
esteemed, not merely for its culinary uses, but as medicine, 
and it also figures im verse and tale as a symbol. The 
204

leek was a food of the poor in the orient, therefore it came 
to mean humility, though it also became the emblem of 
Wales, because it had the Cymric colors, green and white. 
Garlic, another relative of the onion, is given to dogs, 
cocks, and ganders in Bohemia, to make them fearless and 
strong. Onions are endowed with magic properties, and 
if hung in rooms where people congregate the vegetable 
draws to itself the diseases that might otherwise afflict them. 
In the onion the Egyptians symbolized the universe, since 
in their cosmogony the various spheres of hell, earth, and 
heaven were concentric, like its layers. 
The onion is sacred to St. Thomas, and at Christmas be- 
comes a rival to the mistletoe. At the old holiday sports, 
a merry fellow who represented the saint would dance into 
the firelight when the Yule log blazed, and give to the girls 
in the company an onion which they were to cut into quar- 
ters, each whispering to it the name of the young man from 
whom she awaited an offer of marriage, waving it over her 
head, and reciting this spell:   
Good Saint Thomas do me right, and send my true love come 
to-night, i 
That I may see him in the face, and him in my kind arms 
embrace. 
The damsel will be in her bed by the stroke of twelve, 
and if the fates are kind she will have a comforting vision 
of the wedding. 
ORANGE 
Certain poets would have us believe that the golden 
apples of the Hesperides were no apples, but mere oranges 
—too common, surely, to justify the heroics of Hercules, 
for that much tried man, in his picking of the fruit, in- 
volved himself in a journey to Mount Atlas, and a battle 
with the fearsome dragon that guarded them; yet his labors 
205 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
brought no gain, for, as the fruit would not keep, except 
under the eyes of Hesperus’s daughters, Minerva carried 
it back; so Adgle, Arethusa, and Erythia regained their 
golden apples, as the Rhine maidens regained the stolen 
Rhine gold. They would even have us believe—these poets 
—that when the crafty Hippomenes outfooted the swift Ata- 
lanta it was only oranges that he cast over his shoulder. Be- 
cause Jupiter gave the orange to Juno when he married her, 
orange-blossoms are still worn by brides, though the flower’s 
waxy whiteness and luscious perfume entitle it to popular- 
ity for its own sake. 
ORCHID 
Beautiful as is the orchid, there was nothing beautiful 
in its origin, for the first Orchis was the son of a nymph 
and a satyr, hence a fellow of unbounded passion. At a 
festival of Bacchus, being warm with drink, he attacked 
a priestess, whereupon the whole congregation fell upon 
him and rent him limb from limb. His father prayed the 
gods to put him together again; but the gods refused, tem- 
pering their severity, however, by saying that whereas the 
deceased had been a nuisance in his life, he should be a satis- 
faction in his death, so they changed him to the flower that 
bears his name. Even the flower was alleged to retain tem- 
per, and to eat its root was to suffer momentary conversion 
into the satyr state. 
PALM 
The palm supplies rude tribes with food and shelter, 
oil and fuel. From its dates the Babylonians made wine. 
It stands in the desert as a mark of cooling water wells, 
and lines the shore with graceful plumes. In Egypt the 
admiration for its shapeliness expressed itself in capitals 
of temple and palace columns, which are conventionalized 
206
-P-A-G-E-219
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
from its tufts of leaves. In the dawn of history the tree 
signified riches, generation, victory, and light; hence the 
Greeks sanctified it to Apollo and venerated it as immortai. 
The date palm is held in respect among the Tamaquas 
of Mexico as the founder of the human race after the flood. 
In the east it was Mahomet who created the palm, causing 
it to spring from the earth at his command. Typifying 
Judea, it was the seal of that nation on the coins of the 
Roman rulers, for to the Jews it was a token of triumph, 
to be carried in procession, and waved before conquerors; 
a reminder, too, of the pleasant wells of the promised 
land, and the successful wars they waged to reach them. 
Palestine, indeed, is said to take its name from the palm, 
and its Hebrew name, tamar, was given to women, signify- 
ing their grace and uprightness. We still keep Palm Sun- 
day in memory of the day when Christ entered Jerusalem 
and the people waved and strewed palms before Him—an 
incident now denoted in the wearing of crossed fragments 
of palm in hats. Before that time the Jews had their own 
palm festival, when they retired from the city for a week 
to live in tents and cabins of palm branches, passing a 
season of merry-making and family reunions, for it memo- 
rialized the final suecess after forty years of camp life. 
To sufferers for religion, the angels brought palm branches 
before their souls fled through the smoke, and so the tree 
came to be called a token of martyrdom. On All Souls’ 
Day, palms are thrown into the fire, and as they rise in 
smoke they are seized in proof of victory by the souls that 
day released from purgatory. 
In the traditions of some countries the palm was the 
forbidden tree of paradise, and in the coat of arms of 
South Carolina we read a suggestion of this myth, for we 
find there a palm circled by a serpent. In the northern 
lands fragments of palm were precious, for not only would

they subdue water devils, but with a leaf of it one might 
cast down the Wild Huntsman himself. In superstitious 
uses, it prevents sunstroke, if the person seeking its pro- 
tection has burnt it as a sacrifice during an eclipse; it 
averts lightning if a cross of its leaves be laid on the table 
while the storm is raging; it cures fever if bits of the leaf 
are swallowed; it drives away mice when placed near gran- 
aries; and if one would be rid of fleas he puts a palm leaf 
behind the Virgin’s picture on Easter morning, at the first 
stroke of the resurrection bell, saying, ‘‘ Depart, all animals 
without bones.’’ .For one year the fleas will stay away; 
which is a great comfort. 
It was a palm that St. Christopher used as a staff when, 
in his pre-Christian character of Offero, he bore the weak 
and small across the raging river and so carried Christ 
Himself. As the giant stood marvelling that so great a’ 
weight could be expressed in so small a body, Christ bade 
him thrust his staff into the ground, where it would blossom 
in token of the importance of his service. This he did, and 
it burst into flower and fruit, for it was a date tree. And 
the dark mind was enlightened. He understood that it 
was no man child of a common sort he had carried through 
the river, and he knelt and worshipped, taking the name, 
Christofero, or Christ-bearer; and, having lived and died 
in the odor of sanctity, he was gathered to the saints. 
Another saint is Clara, founder of the order of Poor 
Clares, who renounced the world on Palm Sunday, receiving © 
from St. Francis of Assisi the palm branch which in those 
days was the mark of sanctity. 
In the legends of the holy family, the Virgin commanded 
the palm to bend its leaves above the little Jesus during 
the flight into Egypt, in order that the babe might have 
its shade. At another time when the mother of Christ 
was hungry and asked her husband to gather dates for her, 
208
-P-A-G-E-221
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
Joseph demurred, but the infant Jesus ordered the tree 
to bend so that she could pluck the fruit, and this it did so 
willingly that He blessed it and chose it as a ‘‘ symbol of 
salvation for the dying,’’ promising that when He entered 
Jerusalem in triumph it should be with a palm in His hand. 
In her ‘‘Legends of the Madonna,’’ Mrs. Jameson tells 
how the Virgin was comforted, after the crucifixion, by an 
angel who appeared, crying, ‘‘Hail, Mary, blessed of God! 
I bring a palm that has grown in paradise. Let it be car- 
ried before your bier on your death, for in three days you 
shall join your son.’’ The angel then took his flight, leav- 
ing the branch on the ground, where it shone and sparkled 
gloriously. And when the friends and disciples were come 
from the mount of sorrow, Mary gave the palm to John 
and asked him to bear it at her burial. That night, amid 
the sound of singing and a gush of strange perfume through 
the house, the Virgin died with angels about her bed and 
such a blaze of light arising from her body that those who 
prepared it for burial were nearly blinded. And the palm 
was carried to her tomb, where another miracle occurred, 
for she was rapt to heaven in the flesh and weleomed by 
choiring angels and players upon harps beyond number for 
multitude. Looking into the tomb afterward, it was found 
to hold no corruption, but to be filled with roses and lilies. 
We have a palm in the southwest that is peculiar to that 
region: the desert fan, or Washington filifera, from whose 
fibres the Indians make their baskets, ropes, and roofs, and 
with which they sweeten their meal of mesquite beans. Be- 
fore the coming of trouble, in the form of the white race, 
the Cahuilas carried each male child to the mountains, 
soon after birth, and there allotted to him a particular tree 
which served him as reminder of the deity. It was his 
to care for and to worship as a natural altar, and when 
he died it was killed by burning. The Caribs tell us that

when the deluge began to cover the earth, people tried to 
escape by climbing the cocorite palm, whose top reached 
heaven. An old woman in the lead became dizzy and 
frightened when half way up, and so became stone, as did 
all those who tried to pass her; but all who climbed the 
komoo palm were saved. 
PANSY 
Our pansy is a development from the violet, the little 
spots which show clearly in the white violet having been 
enlarged through cultivation to the markings that have 
so queer a suggestion of a face. An old German tale 
represents that it once had as fine a perfume as the violet, 
but as it grew wild in the fields the people sought it with 
such enthusiasm that they heedlessly trampled the grass 
needed for cattle, and even the vegetables required for their 
own tables. Seeing the wreck that was wrought by this 
eagerness, the flower prayed to the Trinity to take away 
its odor, that it might be no longer sought. This prayer 
was granted, and it was then that it took the name of trin- 
ity. To the monks, it was the flower of trinity, or herb 
trinity ; to the laity, it was three faces in a hood; in heathen 
days, it was Jove’s flower; with Christianity, it became the 
flower of Saint Valentine; heart’s ease is another title; and 
of the accepted name of pansy—which is our way of saying 
pensée, a thought—there are quaint spellings, such as 
panses, penses, paunces, pancyes, and pawnces, these versions 
occurring in old poetry. Other odd names for it are ladies’ 
flower, bird’s eye, pink of my John, Kit run in the street, 
flamy, cull me, call me, stepmother, sister in law, the longer 
the dearer, kiss me quick, kiss me at the garden gate, cuddle 
me, jump up and kiss me, and kiss me ere I rise.

PASSION FLOWER 
In an old Spanish tradition it was the passion flower 
that climbed the cross and fastened about the scars in the 
wood where the nails had been driven through the hands 
and feet of the Sufferer. ‘The early fathers saw in its bud 
the eucharist, in its half-open flower the star in the Hast, 
and in the full bloom the five wounds, the nails, the ham- 
mer, the spear, the pillar of scourging, and the crown of 
thorns, in its leaves the spear-head and thirty pieces of 
silver, in its tendrils the cords that bound the Lord. This 
growth upon the cross was not remembered by the people 
of Jerusalem, but was revealed to St. Francis of Assisi 
in one of his starving visions. It had turned in his sight 
from Lady Poverty, the object of his worship, to the 
flowering plant. When the Spaniards found the flower 
growing in the jungles of South America they regarded it 
as a promise that the natives should be converted, and a 
curious drawing made by one of the priests shows not only 
a likeness to the implements of the crucifixion, but the 
objects themselves in miniature: the column, nails, crown, 
and cup. In allusion to the habit of the flower in half 
closing to a bell form, a churchman wrote, ‘‘It may be 
well that in His infinite wisdom it pleased Him to create 
it thus shut up and protected, as though to indicate that 
the wonderful mysteries of the cross and of His Passion 
were to remain hidden from the heathen people of those 
countries until the time preordained by His Highest Maj- 
esty.’? Naturally, so marvellous a plant was sought and 
acclaimed by clerics of all degrees, and by the sick and 
crippled, and so eager is the eye of faith that after the vine 
was naturalized in Europe the people long continued to see 
in it those signs and wonders that we do not. When the 
Jesuits announced, in 1600, that the objects of the passion 
Qil

    were disclosed in the flower, an indignant botanist, an 
early Huxley, exclaimed, ‘‘I dare say God never willed 
His priests to instruct His people with lies; for they come 
from the Devill, the author of them.”’ 
PAULOWNIA 
Centuries ago there stood in the dragon gorge of Honan 
an imperial paulownia, or kiri, that ruled the forest by 
reason of its height, its symmetry, and the profusion of its 
flowers. And so it stood for ages, singing to the wind 
in its own voice. A wizard wandering that way listened, 
and at a touch of his wand he changed the tree into a harp, 
which, however, was to yield its music only to the greatest 
of musicians. The emperor summoned the masters and 
ordered them to strike its chords, but always when they 
did so the notes were harsh. Then Peiwoh came, and, 
instead of smiting its strings with command, as the others 
had done, he touched the harp lovingly, asking it to speak 
in its own voice, and not in the music of men. There was 
no vanity in the man, hence the kiri sang once more, sound- 
ing like the breath of a storm across the woods, recalling 
the carol of birds, and suggesting the sound of rain, of dis- 
tant thunder, of waterfalls, of falling timber—all the 
sounds of the wilderness it knew and loved in its life. 
The emperor, delighted, asked an explanation of the mas- 
tery and mystery. ‘‘It is that I encouraged the kiri to 
choose its own themes,’’ answered Peiwoh. In which 
allegory the art spirit stands confessed. 
PEA 
This delicate and nourishing vegetable was a food of 
hearty old Thor, the thunderer, in whose honor, on Thor’s 
day (Thursday) it is still eaten in Germany. The pea 
212
-P-A-G-E-225
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
came by an ill reputation, because, when the fires which 
were kindled on St. John’s eve drove away the dragons 
that had been soaring roundabout, dripping pestilence from 
their wings, those canny brutes, not daring to descend to 
the hills where the flames appeared, carried up stores of peas 
and dropped them into the wells and springs, where, rotting, 
they raised a doleful stench and created miseries in the 
inwards of the public. 
Peas are used in divination, and ancient ceremonies 
testify to a regard that in our day of good cooking should 
be no less. Scottish and English lads and lassies are 
rubbed with pea straws by way of consolation when they 
have been jilted. When an eligible miss in shelling peas 
discovers nine in a pod, she puts the pod on the lintel and 
holds her breath, for the first male person who enters 
thereafter will marry her—if he is not already married, 
and is not related. 
PEACH 
A popular folk-tale of Japan recites that an old woman 
washing clothes at a river was startled by a rolling and 
splashing in the water, and presently there came to her 
feet a large, round object of pink color. She drew it with 
difficulty to the bank, where she discovered that it was a 
peach, containing food enough to serve her and her hus- 
band for several days. On breaking it open, they were 
amazed to discover, cuddled inside the peach stone, a tiny 
child. The little fellow was cared for by his foster parents, 
who gave to him the best training and schooling that their 
means afforded. When he attained his growth he invaded 
the Island of Devils, defeated its inhabitants, and seized 
their treasure, which he poured at the feet of the aged 
213  
-P-A-G-E-226
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  couple in reward for their love and their service in deliver- 
ing him from the peach. 
Collectors of porcelains and other works of Chinese 
art have observed the peach as a decorative figure, but have 
not always known that in presenting a vase or dish so 
ornamented the giver implies a hope of long life for the 
recipient. For in China the peach is the emblem of 
longevity, the bowls and plates on which it appears in 
picture being intended as birthday gifts. 
PEEPUL 
The peepul, pippala, or asvattha of India, which botan- 
ists insist should be called ficus religiosa, is sacred to Bud- 
dha, and shades many of his shrines and temples. It is 
the tree of wisdom, for Buddha sat beneath it in that long 
trance of acquired merit, when he stripped his memory 
of earthly things and enlarged his mind to the understand- 
ing of heaven. The sacred fires are fed with peepul wood 
and wood of the acacia sumi, the peepul symbolizing the 
male principle, the acacia the female, and the flame being 
ereated by rubbing sticks of the two. Priests drink the 
divine soma from vessels of peepul, and they who eat of 
its fruit when they reach paradise become enlightened, 
for this fruit is ambrosia, food of gods. 
The Hindus, who have almost as much regard for this 
tree as have the Buddhists, represent Vishnu seated on its 
leaves; but they share in the preservation of the peepul, or 
bo, at Anuradhapura, Ceylon, which is held to be a scion 
of the veritable tree under which Buddha received illumina- 
tion. In Thibet, the Buddhists declare that the peepul is 
the bridge whereon all worthy souls pass from earth to 
heaven.

PEONY 
The peony, or prony, is cited by Pliny as the earliest 
known of medicinal plants. In his very remarkable nat- 
ural history we learn that the woodpecker is especially 
fond of it, and that if he sees you picking the flower, he 
will fly at you and pick your eyes out. The name of the 
plant perpetuates that of Apollo in his character of physi- 
cian, for as Peon he healed the wounds the gods received 
in the Trojan war. From that fact, the early doctors of 
medicine were known as pwoni, and medicinal plants were 
peonie. To this day, it is a practice among the peasantry 
of Sussex to put strings of beads carved from peony roots 
about the necks of their children, not merely that they may 
eut their teeth upon them, but that the beads may avert 
illness of all sorts, as well as the machinations of evil spirits. 
Apollo, being the healer and giver of light, heat, and 
other blessings, was praised in the hymn which took his 
name, and which we still call the pean. Thus in nomen- 
clature the peony has a more than aristocratic lineage: it 
is divine. Yet it was a cause of strife and sorrow even on 
Olympus, for A‘sculapius, having been stirred to jealousy 
by the success of Peon—who now appears, not as the dis- 
guised Apollo, but as a man—in curing a hurt for Pluto, 
put his rival to death. Pluto, however, saved his physician 
from the common fate by changing him into the flower he 
had employed in his wonder work. In one ancient belief 
the flower sprang from a moonbeam, and in yet another its 
origin was not a physician, but a blushing shepherdess, 
Pronia, whose charms had stirred the love of Apollo. 
In the east, where peonies abound, and where the Japan- 
ese cultivate five hundred varieties, rearing them to arbo- 
real dimensions, they tell of a Chinese scholar whose chief 
recreation was in the care of these flowers. Living so

largely in their company and in that of his books, it was 
natural that he should be startled, though agreeably so, by 
the visit of a lovely maid, who appeared, unannounced, at 
his door and asked to be taken into his employ. He cheer- 
fully complied with her request, and his cheer increased 
as time went on, for he discovered presently that she was 
not only servant, but companion ; she had received an excep- 
tional education, knew court etiquette, wrote like a scholar, 
and was poet, painter, and friend. The young man intro- 
duced her to his acquaintances with pride, and they were 
astonished no less at her accomplishments than at her grace 
and beauty. She always obeyed him with gladness, till the 
fatal day arrived when a visit was expected from a famous 
moralist; then the scholar summoned her in vain. Uneasy 
at her absence, he went in search, and on entering a shad- 
owed gallery he saw her gliding before him like a spectre. 
Before he could overtake her, she had flattened herself 
against the wall and sunk into it till she was a mere picture 
on the surface, though her lips continued to move. ‘‘I 
did not answer when you called me,’’ she confessed, ‘‘for 
I am not a human creature: I am the soul of a peony. It 
was your love that warmed me into human shape, and it 
has been a joy to serve you. But now that the priest has 
come, he will disapprove your love, and I can not keep 
my form. I must return to the flowers.’’? In vain the 
scholar argued and implored ; she sank more deeply into the 
wall; the colors of the picture that she made grew fainter; 
at length she faded altogether, and there was no trace of 
her from that day. And the scholar went about in 
mourning. 
PIMPERNEL 
Scarlet pimpernel is called ‘‘poor man’s weather glass,”’ 
from its habit of closing before rain, and is a fair marker 
for the hours likewise, since it opens at about seven and

closes at two, according to English observers. As it grew 
on Calvary, it was sovereign against spells, and would even 
draw splinters from the flesh. This formula, however, is 
to be said for fifteen days running, twice a day, night and 
morning, if the splinters have been driven in by witches: 
Herbe pimpernel, I have thee found 
Growing upon Christ Jesus’ ground; 
The same gift the Lord Jesus gave unto thee 
When He shed His blood on the tree. 
Arise up, pimpernel, and go with me, 
And God bless me, 
And all that shall wear thee. Amen. 
PINE 
Becoming jealous, Cybele, mother of the gods, put an 
end to the flirtations of a shepherd whom she loved by 
changing him into a pine. Having thus estranged him 
from his proper shape, she passed much time beneath his 
branches, mourning; wherefore Jove, himself a frequent 
heart-breaker, had such sympathy for her that, in order to 
make this memorial seemly at all seasons, he ordained that 
its foliage should be ever green. The Chinese regard the 
pine, plum, and bamboo as embleming friendship in adver- 
sity, because of this quality of enduring cold without los- 
ing their summer aspect. We find constancy indicated in 
a Roman legend of a youth and maid who died of grief 
because their love was thwarted, the one changing to a pine 
and the other to a vine, growing together for centuries 
in a fast embrace. There would seem no reason for the 
diabolie character that Sulpicius gave to the pine in his 
life of St. Martin, for its uses, its beneficence, and its 
beauty justify all good report. 
The tree takes its name from pinus, a raft, because the 
wood, being easy to cut, was employed for the boats and 
floats of primitive men. Hence the Greeks held it sacred

to the sea god. That men listened to its musical breathings 
thousands of years before science marred the poetry of 
nature is proved in the belief that the pine was the mistress 
of Boreas, the wind, and Pan, the all-god. It bore chil- 
dren, in the German tradition, and every hole and knot 
in the trunk is the point from which a wood spirit escaped 
into the outer world, sometimes growing and becoming 
as other women, as in Sweden, where a famous beauty 
of Smaland was accepted as a member of a family. Her 
history was in some doubt, but she did her part in the 
house and farm work, and no question of her human quality 
was raised, unless by strangers, who were astonished by her 
height and her bright beauty, and who, listening to the 
lulling tones of her voice, thought them as soft as the mur- 
mur in a pine. All went well with the family till a knot 
in a pine board of the house wall fell out, and a way of 
escape to the forest was so opened. The woman crept to 
the place and listened to that music of the outer world, 
that world of her youth and her dreams, and, longing in- 
tensely to return to it, her body shrank and shrank till she 
was a tiny elf. With a smile and a tear, she looked 
about her home of years, nodded a good-by, and was gone 
from that place forever. 
Near Ahorn, Coburg, an image of the Virgin was 
miraculously concealed in a pine trunk, but made itself 
known to the priest, who caused a church to be erected 
on the spot; and it was probably the steeple of this same 
edifice that a witch twisted out of the vertical, involving 
the place in the scorn of neighbor villages for the slowness 
of the congregation in putting it straight. Matters were 
remedied when one of the Ahorn peasants, choosing a pine 
that was stout enough to endure it, made it proxy for the 
steeple, and by pulling, hauling, and invoking persuaded 
the tower to imitate the motions imparted to the pine.

For this tree developed mysterious powers and properties 
when it was discovered that its cone, cut lengthwise, exhib- 
ited the form of a hand—the hand of Christ. When Mary 
was in flight she stopped beneath a pine, and, concealed 
from her enemies, rested sweetly in a cool, green chamber 
filled with balsamy fragrance, the tree, as if to prove the 
love of the plant world, having lowered its limbs about her. 
Herod’s soldiers passed, and the baby, raising his hand to 
bless the tree for its shelter, thus marked the fruit of it. 
These cones are eaten by Indians, and were used as 
food by the Romans also, who held that they imparted 
strength. Thieves in Bohemia are said to eat them even 
yet, believing that the oily nut makes them shot-proof. 
The pine is also a cure for gout, cataract, and for sundry 
diseases of live stock. It was esteemed by our Puritan 
fathers, for when they landed at dismal Plymouth it was 
the only green thing they saw; hence they took it as a de- 
vice, stamping it upon their pine tree shillings and other 
coinage, and imposing it on the state seal of Massachusetts. 
Other pilgrims came, and lopped away the woods, the 
forest margin retreating northward, and so Maine came 
to be known as the Pine Tree State, a haven for the wild 
things, a place of ponds and streams that disappear when 
the woods are cut and the uncovered soil converts to dust 
under the pelt of the sun. 
Folk-tales of many lands contain allusion to the pine. 
One of them is told in Japan: An aged couple had a dog 
that, scratching in the earth, uncovered gold. <A jealous 
and mean-hearted neighbor asked the service of the animal, 
on hearing of this fortune, for he believed that equal luck 
would fall to him: but instead of revealing buried treasure, 
the dog uncovered a quantity of filth, so enraging the 
jealous one that he killed the animal and buried it under 
a pine. Nourished by the body, the tree grew to a noble 
219

    size and kept the spirit that was in the dog and that it 
continued to exercise toward its beloved master, who, 
having occasion to pound his grain, shaped a piece of 
its wood into a mortar. So long as he used it, barley 
appeared to well up from the bottom, and there was never 
lack of food. The neighbor, hearing of this miracle, asked 
for the loan of the utensil, and the same ill luck he had 
earned by envy and ill temper came upon him again: all 
that the mortar turned out for him was mouldy and 
wormy ; so, in a passion, he broke it into pieces. But the 
old man gathered up the fragments, even though the 
wicked one had burned them, and proved their magic 
power by casting them against the trees in winter, or 
against trees that were dead, thus causing them to burst 
into’leaf and bloom. This new wonder brought the old 
man into favor with his lord, for whom he restored many 
trees, and who rewarded him with gifts of money and 
silks, to the renewed anguish of his neighbor. The bad 
one, thinking to commend himself equally to the nobleman, 
gathered ashes from the pine and tried to create blossoms, 
but their virtue had passed, or his hands were not the 
hands to evoke it; moreover, his talent for bungling led 
him to experiment just as the prince was passing, when 
the dust blew straight into the eyes of the nobleman. He, 
thinking himself insulted by a rude or careless fellow, 
caused the envious one to be whipped. 
Pines are often represented in Japanese art, and one of 
them, a sacred tree at Lake Biwa, near Tokio, has a roof to 
protect it from the elements. It is ninety feet high, has 
a circumference of thirty-seven, and throws its three hun- 
dred and eighty branches to an extreme of two hundred 
and eighty-eight feet. These limbs sag so heavily that they 
require support, and the visitor has sometimes to stoop in 
passing through their green aisles.

PLANTAIN 
We have two varieties of this weed: one with rounded 
leaves, bearing a single spike of insignificant blossoms that, 
when in bud, we give to caged birds; the other with a 
long, ribbed, sharper leaf and taller spear of flowers. 
The first we call bird plantain; the second English plan- 
tain, though it is as thoroughly domesticated here as the 
house sparrow which we still call English. Across the 
water this latter variety is known as ribwort, and also 
as kemp—a word derived from the Danish kaempe, or 
soldier, which use of the word seems to have come from a 
sport of children in knocking the heads from these stalks 
with others of the same size, held in the hand, turn and 
turn about. Other names that signify its uses in this 
contest are fighting cocks, soldiers, devil’s heads, hard heads, 
and French-and-English. 
Because the bird plantain came from Europe with the 
early settlers, the American Indians call it ‘‘the white 
man’s foot.’’ This round-leaved plantain is way-bread in 
parts of England, but not because it is prized as food. It 
loves the places where men walk, and will inhabit there by 
preference. Once in seven years it becomes a bird and 
begins its search for cuckoos on the wing, that it may serve 
them. Its fondness for cultivated ground evidently gave 
rise to the Indian name, and the sight of birds rising from 
it after feeding was occasion for the fanciful belief. 
POMEGRANATE 
Pomegranate, a symbol of hope in Christian art, is 
thought by some scholars of antiquity to be the tree of life 
that flourished in Eden. In Turkey, when a bride throws 
its fruit to the earth, the seeds that fall out will indicate

  the number of her children, the significance of which prac- 
tice was emphasized by the old masters, who show St. 
Catharine holding a pomegranate, as tokening the fruitage 
of the faith. Yet this was a fruit of hell in early myth, 
because through eating it Proserpine was forced to return 
to that dismal region and spend a half of every year. 
Demeter, or Ceres, goddess of the earth, and mother of 
Proserpine, or Persephone, left Olympus in anger when 
her daughter was given by Zeus to Pluto, god of hell, for 
wife. Ceres came to earth to live among men, blessing 
all who were kind to her and eursing all who were not. 
So often did she visit penalties on the multitude that Zeus, 
realizing his over-haste, determined to restore more pleas- 
ant relations between earth and heaven, and summoned 
Pluto to give up Proserpine. Not daring to disobey, Pluto 
released her, but just as she was leaving he urged that she 
eat a pomegranate he had given to her, and in yielding 
to his desire she gave him the continued hold that doomed 
her to forego the light and warmth in the winter months. 
This conditional release did much for the human race, how- 
ever, because Ceres was now so happy in her daughter’s 
company that she was kind once more. 
This legend has been variously interpreted as a season 
myth, illustrating the release of the earth from winter dark- 
ness; as a moon myth, denoting the retirement and emer- 
gence of the heavenly lamp; as a symbol of immortality 
and resurrection ; and as a token of nature’s fertility, Pros- 
erpine being the seed that is dropped into the darkness 
of the soil, only to emerge again, brighter than before. 
But the pomegranate signified the power of the world of 
darkness, therein becoming a type of all fruits that ger- 
minate below the earth, and send their seed back to it in the 
given season. This faith or symbolry of the Greeks doubt- 
less travelled to the east, for we discover it in the Chinese 
222

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
idea that the pomegranate signifies fertility. Women who 
wish children offer this fruit to the goddess of mercy, and 
the porcelains designed for her temples are decorated. with 
its pictures. 
The original pomegranate was claimed by Bacchus, for 
it had been a nymph of his affection whom he changed into 
the tree, and whose blossom he shaped like a crown in order 
to fulfil the prophecy of a soothsayer that she should wear 
one. Pomegranates that sprang from the graves of King 
Eteocles and of Meneceus, a suicide, proved their human 
relationship by exuding blood. 
POPLAR 
Philologists variously account for the name poplar: 
that it means populus, because the Roman populace gath- 
ered about it for public meetings; that it comes from 
papeln, meaning to babble, for its leaves are always chat- 
tering. The groves of Academus were of poplar, and the 
tree was sacred to Hercules because when bitten by a snake 
he found a remedy for the poison in poplar leaves. The 
Pillars of Hercules, that long marked the seaward bound 
of the Roman empire, were erected to commemorate that 
event. Another Greek myth says that when Hercules had 
brought the oxen of Geryon from their places, and had 
killed the giant Cacus, he wrenched a bough from a near-by 
poplar, such as grew thickly, on Mount Aventinus, and 
crowned himself in token of his victory. His next labor led 
him into hell, where the smoke and fire blackened the upper 
side of the leaves, while the under sides were kept cool by 
the sweat of his brow, and since that time the poplar leaf 
has been silver-lined. 
The tree is also related, mythologically, to Pheton, who 
tried to drive the sun chariot of his father, Apollo, and who, 
223  
-P-A-G-E-238
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
unable to control his horses, swerved up and down and from 
side to side of the course, now burning and blistering the 
fields, anon drying up the Nile, and lastly killing so many 
of humankind that Zeus, hearing the cry of the people, 
unseated the incapable driver with a thunderbolt that 
hurled him headlong into the river Eridanus. Here the 
Heliades, his sisters, came to bewail him, and as their tears 
fell into the water they changed to golden drops which we 
now call amber; and after a little the mourners took on 
the form of the trees that had given the precious gum: 
the poplar. 
It would seem that spoons are no recent invention, for 
Jupiter suffered a loss of some, and, having reason to 
believe that they had fallen into or been hidden in a tree, 
he bade Ganymede seek them through the wood. The mes- 
senger first asked of the oak. Stirring with wrath, the big 
tree answered, ‘‘What know I of spoons? I have leaves of 
emerald and a thousand silver cups. I am king of trees, 
and no thief.’’ 
Ganymede asked pardon and moved on to the birch. 
“‘T have silver of my own,’’ she answered. ‘‘I am sheathed 
in it. I have no need of other.’’ 
Again the gods’ cup-bearer begged forgiveness and re- 
sumed his search. The beach scattered its prickly nut- 
sheaths over him; the elm swung down its branches till 
they threatened to crush his head; the fir was shaken as by 
a storm, and hurled cones at him in a volley. So the ques- 
tioner came to the poplar. ‘‘Why should I be charged with 
keeping the goods of Zeus?’’ it asked. ‘‘See, there is noth- 
ing concealed upon me.’’ And forthwith it tossed up its 
limbs—for they grew low then—intending to show that 
nothing was hidden beneath them; but the spoons had not 
been securely stowed, and as the wooden arms lifted, down 
fell the plunder in a tinkling shower and lay on the earth 
224
-P-A-G-E-239
    
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    as white as the leaves, which now showed a deathly pallor 
on their under side. Ganymede picked up the stolen silver 
and hastened back to Olympus, leaving the poplar trem- 
bling with apprehension. For its theft and its falsehood, 
Zeus condemned it to hold up its arms forever. 
All over the world we find a religious expression of the 
idea that success or salvation is to be gained only through 
pain. The early Christian traditions extended the pain 
beyond the victim, making it shared by inanimate nature; 
by the flowers; and especially by the poplar, for out of its 
wood the cross was made, according to one version, and 
for that reason it has never ceased to shudder for the part 
it played in the great tragedy. Some say that Christ Him- 
self had to fashion the cross from poplar trunks, for which 
reason the Latins hold it sacred, and not a few of the 
French Canadians refuse to cut ‘‘popple’’ in our lumber 
camps. Its trembling began at the moment when the sacred 
blood was poured upon its wood. But another reason for 
this motion is that it marks its wrath when Judas chose 
to hang himself upon it after his treachery had become 
known. It is also said that when Joseph and Mary were 
flying from the cruelties of Herod they passed through a 
grove of poplars. All other trees had bent as the holy 
family went by, but the poplar held itself aloof and would 
not move its head. The infant Jesus gave one look at the 
stubborn tree, whereon, struck with remorse, it began to 
tremble, and has never ceased to do so. 
POPPY 
Every one knows this brilliant flower that sparkles 
amid the grain-fields of the old world, where it is regarded 
as the blossom of a weed and of evil omen, for its color 
hints at blood. It became the symbol of death when the 
16 225

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
son of Tarquinius Superbus asked him what should be done 
with the people of a conquered city. Tarquin made no 
verbal reply, but, going into the garden, he slashed off the 
heads of the largest poppies, therein commending the 
massacre of the best and most influential citizens. When 
Persephone was stolen by Pluto, her mother, Ceres, began 
a search for her that led through all Sicily, climbing Avtna 
to light torches that she might keep on her journey through 
the night. Unable to restore her child, the gods caused 
poppies to spring about her feet, and, curious as to their 
meaning, she knelt to look at them closely. She inhaled 
their bitter, drowsy breath, and put the seeds into her 
mouth, and presently the plant bestowed upon her that rest 
which her weary body needed. Poppies were offered to the 
dead, therefore, with a fine symbolism, since they signify 
sleep. The Saxon name for the plant, popig, is said to have 
reference to the mixing of its seeds with pap administered 
to children in order to make them sleep: and as opium is 
yielded by the flower, we have the origin of those soothing 
syrups that are still administered to the helpless. Growing, 
as it did, in corn, it was dedicated to Ceres by the ancients, 
who painted her picture with wheat ears and poppies in 
her hair; but it also belonged to Venus Genetrix, because the 
number of its seeds instanced fertility. One of its queer 
names, ‘‘cracking rose,’’ recalls a practice of striking a 
poppy petal between the hands in order to ascertain whether 
or no a lover is faithful. If it breaks, it signifies that he 
is not true, but if it holds together and makes a consider- 
able report, it is a cause for rejoicing. 
It is said that after the battle of Neerwinden the fields 
were covered with scarlet poppies, which the people looked 
upon as the spilled blood of twenty thousand soldiers, and 
a sign of heaven’s anger at the evil deeds of men. In the 
east, too, where the flower has the name of little dawn, 
226
-P-A-G-E-241
    MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
the plains and vales that armed hosts have struggled to 
possess are still splashed with these flowers, ‘‘blooming in 
barbaric splendor, gloating on the gore of soldiers slain.’’ 
And if the Neerwinden story seems too modern for accept- 
ance as folk-lore, we have a still newer instance, arising 
from our wars with the Indians in the west. After the 
massacre of Custer and his men by the Sioux the Indians 
alleged the appearance on the battle-field of a new flower 
which they called Custer’s heart. It had long, hard leaves, 
eurved like a cavalry sabre, and so sharp as to cut the hand 
that tried to tear them from the ground. The plant sprang 
from the blood of the slain fighters on that day in 1876. 
The red poppy is not native to America, but the lovely 
escholzia is—the representative of the species which has 
been chosen as the State flower of California, where it 
lights the mountains as if revealing the gold hid in their 
ledges. The yellow poppy, or corn poppy, of Europe is 
a shore plant, and recalls in its other name, glauciere jaune, 
Glaucus, son of Neptune and a sea nymph, who elected to 
live on land. Still, he was fond of fishing, and, having 
made a good catch on a certain occasion, he was astonished 
to see the fish wriggle into the herbage and eat of it vora- 
ciously, with the result that they obtained strength to leap 
back into the sea. Determined to know the virtue of this 
diet, Glaucus bent and nibbled at a few of the grasses and 
poppies, whereupon he felt himself so impetuously drawn 
to the ocean that he leaped in and never came back to the 
shore. 
Among the gorgeous new strains that gardeners have 
ereated in the poppy family sundry show a cross shape of 
the pistil, which recalls the old Christian tradition that holy 
blood stains the flower; but an English legend causes the 
poppy to appear from the blood of a dragon slain by the 
holy maid Margaret.

PRIMROSE 
Our evening primrose, @nothera lamarckiana, now do- 
mesticated in Europe, has modified the theory of evolution 
by showing that, in its own case, at all events, the mutations 
which are starting points for new species are sudden appear- 
ances; not, of need, monstrosities, but, say, the development 
of smooth leaves from serrate, low stalks from high; and 
experiment proves these mutations to be steadfast in the 
progeny. These facts are known as the result of studies by 
Professor Hugo de Vries, of Amsterdam, who did not arti- 
ficially fertilize the plants, as professional growers do, but 
merely planted the seed and watched for results. In fifteen 
thousand specimens he found ten aberrants, and after 
four generations he discovered seven different types, the 
seven numbering three hundred and thirty-four mutants. 
A less recent interest in the primrose, and of another 
type, was created by Lord Beaconsfield, when he adopted it 
as his flower, just as Napoleon took the violet for his own; 
hence ‘‘Primrose Day’’ is a new feast in the calendar, and 
one about which myths are as likely to grow in future as 
we know them to have originated in the past from events of 
equal unimportance. Among the little ushers of the spring, 
the primrose keeps its popularity in cities where, indeed, the 
flowers peddled in the shops are one of the few signs of 
the advancing season. It is no rose, to be sure, any more 
than is the evening primrose, but is so named through a 
twisting of the Italian fiore de prima vera (first flower of 
spring). Early Englishmen came nearer to the Italian 
name in their primerole. Though accounted as one of 
the most harmless of plants, we are told that the pretty 
variety, primula obconica, sold so largely from American 
greenhouses, utters a poisonous exhalation, causing head- 
ache, and rash on the hands and face. How it may be with 
228

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
others I do not know, but this variety affects me no more 
than does any other, when it is kept indoors, on tables and 
windowsills. 
Wherever English people are, the primrose is especially 
prized. Hulme tells of one exhibited in Melbourne, Aus- 
tralia, to no less than three thousand people, including 
rough miners and bushmen, who had heard of its arrival 
from their old home. They would have taken it amiss had 
they been accused of sentiment. It has been deeply senti- 
mental in its origin, for it was a human creature once: 
Paralisos, son of Flora and Priapus. Having died of heart- 
break for loss of his sweetheart, he was changed by the gods 
into this rustic and cheerful blossom. 
PUMPKIN 
A sage in India, whose name was Iaia, was so rapt in 
things not of this earth that when his only son fell ill and 
died, he could not, for his life, imagine what to do. After 
some days, conceiving that it would be well to remove the 
body, he inclosed it in the largest pumpkin he could find 
and carried it to the foot of a mountain, not far away. 
Happening to visit this region later, he opened the pump- 
kin, and was startled when a volley of fish was discharged 
from the vegetable, also a few whales. Although these 
creatures fell to the ground, so much water ran from the 
pumpkin that they were able to wriggle away in the cur- 
rent. In some astonishment, the wise one reported this 
phenomenon to the people on the plains, and four brothers 
hurried to the hills to catch the fish for food. Iaia pursued, 
for he was fearful lest they harm the pumpkin, but they 
reached it first, and lifted it, but, seeing him on the road, 
dropped it again, breaking it in half a dozen places. From 
each of these fissures flowed a river that swelled and swelled 
229
-P-A-G-E-244
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    till the earth was covered with water, and most of it never 
dried away, but is what we call the ocean. Which is a 
strange version of the universal deluge legend. Possibly 
this momentary importance of the pumpkin is denoted in 
the respect that is still paid to it by the Chinese, who call 
it the emperor of the garden and a symbol of fruitfulness, 
health, and gain. 
RADISH 
If you will wear a crown of blue flowering radish, called 
in Germany hederich, you can go about your employments 
in peace, for no witch or wizard will be able to spoil your

Here in prosy America the radish seems never to have 
had its due as a symbol or a poem;’it is merely a hors 
d’auvre, to be nibbled between the entrée and the roast. 
But in imaginative Germany it has inspired legends, one of 
the oldest being that of Rubezahl, who is the soul of a rad- 
ish, a harsh, peppery, odious creature. He steals a princess 
and shuts her in his castle, so she can not avoid listening 
to his protestations of love. She begs him to solace her 
loneliness with other company, so he touches a number of 
radishes, which instantly take on human form, but which 
ean keep it only so long as a radish can keep its leaves. 
When these companions fade, she begs others; so, to show 
his power, Rubezahl changes another radish to a bee, and 
the princess, whispering her plight into its ear, sends it off 
to seek her human lover in the great world. The bee does 
not return. Another radish becomes a cricket, and that also 
is pushed out of window with a message to her lover. It 
never returns. Still pestered by the attentions of Rube- 
zahl, the princess beseeches him to count the radishes he 
has left with her, and he begins to do so, whereupon the 
girl, seizing his wand, changes one of the radishes into a 
horse and gallops off on it to meet her lover.

RAGWEED 
If ever you are in that wild part of Cornwall where 
Castle Peak lords it over the moors, a new experience 
awaits you, if you dare to stay out late. Choose some 
night when a harsh wind is blowing, and clouds are skurry- 
ing across the moon: then you shall see gray, misty figures 
stealing over the heath. They are witches, gathering rag- 
weed. When they have picked a bunch of strong stems 
the hags bestride them and off they go, flying faster than 
the clouds and mixing with them as the ride goes forward 
to Castle Peak. If you follow, you shall see them gathered 
at its top, dancing, mingling in obscene worship, or brew- 
ing poisons and compounding spells that are to bring 
death, illness, poverty, wreck, and devastation to their 
neighbors. Clutch your rosary tight, that night, and wear 
your crown of radish flowers, for if you are seen spying on 
this company it will go hard with you. 
RESURRECTION PLANT 
Now and then will be found in city shops, or in the 
packs of those who hawk merchandise through the town, a 
dried plant which is offered for sale as the ‘‘resurrection 
plant.’’ It covers the space of a hand, and, placed in water, 
its infolded leaves relax and discover a certain symmetry. 
Often, too, the wetting restores a semblance of life. This 
anastatica hierochuntica, or holy resurrection flower, is also 
ealled the rose of Jericho, rosa Hyrici, Mary’s hand, and our 
lady’s rose; yet it is not a rose, and in nowise resembles 
one. It grows in the desert, where it is said that the winds 
frequently uproot it, since it can have no deep hold on the 
sand. It requires faith to accept the further allegation 
that wherever it chances to stop it sends down a root and 
continues its interrupted growth till the next high wind.

The early Christian church dedicated the plant to the Vir- 
gin, and in the east and in parts of Europe it is prized 
by women who believe that they shall become mothers of 
many. Wherever the holy family paused in its flight to 
Egypt this plant sprang from the earth, the first rising 
from the plain of Jericho to greet the infant Saviour. 
ROSE 
Loved by the world and loving it, the rose is the type 
of beauty. It is grown and worn in all but Arctic lands 
and the equatorial belt. Its essence, the fragrant attar, 
carries to the earth’s ends a memory of its sweetness. It 
has been the symbol of faction, the symbol of peace, the 
emblem of prospering nations. Its part in history is still 
told in rites and tributes, for in London the custom holds 
of laying the city sword on a bed of rose-leaves on Michael- 
mas day—a memory of the Wars of the Roses. - The rose 
figures from the earliest times in the art, the poetry, the 
traditions, of the people, and has its place in the legends 
of the saints. It is with a rose of gold that the Pope re- 
quites service to the faith. It is a rosary by which piety 
still numbers its prayers and aves. The rose blooms in 
precious stones, among the treasures of kings and princes 
of the church; it flowers on storied windows; it glorifies 
tapestries and vestments, silks and canvases, even as it 
blows in gardens. From the earliest speech, it has figured 
in poetry and song. It comes from China, Japan, Persia, 
Damascus, Caucasus, Provence, Iceland; it borrows the 
name of Sharon; we have the Austrian briar and the double 
yellow of Constantinople; we pluck the banksia of Scot- 
land and the harsh plant of the Dead Sea border; we have 
our own lovely roses that will not leave America, for they 
say that the blooms of Virginia die if they are transplanted.

We find our flower conventionalized in objects of art and 
even on the reverse of our coins, for Edward III. struck the 
rose nobles in 1334; Edward IV., ‘‘the Rose of Rouen,’’ 
continued to mint them, while on this side of the sea we 
had our Rosa Americana in pennies and ha’pence before 
the Revolution. 
In Hindu mythology Vishnu was floating on the water, 
to allay the burn of noon, when a lotus beside him began 
to open its petals. When it had completely unfolded, 
Brahma was discovered within, cradled in its silk. The 
two gods discoursed on the relative merits of the flowers. 
Brahma, rising from the lotus, pointed to it as the supreme 
expression of natural beauty, but Vishnu said, ‘‘In my 
paradise is a blossom a thousandfold more lovely and sweet 
than yours. It excels all other flowers in perfume, and its 
whiteness is that of the moon.’’ 
Brahma derided this claim, adding, ‘‘If you prove to me 
that you speak truth, I will resign my place in the trinity, 
and you shall be chief god.”’ 
As Vishnu’s paradise was far from India, the two gods 
called to them the serpent of infinity, and on his back they 
travelled out into space till Vishnu’s palace revealed itself. 
The serpent stopped before its gates, which swung open 
when Vishnu had sounded a note on his conch. Brahma 
refused all refreshment, so eager was he to see whether his 
companion could fulfil his boast, and the two passed through 
a corridor of mother-of-pearl to a court where was a tree 
that bore a single rose. This was an immense flower, white 
as the snows of the Himalayas, and a perfume breathed 
from it like the incense of an altar, only far sweeter. ‘‘The 
fairest thing in heaven or earth,’’ said Vishnu. But a still 
fairer was to appear, for the rose opened its petals widely, 
and Lakshmi stepped forth. ‘‘I am sent to be your wife,”’ 
she said submissively. ‘‘Because you were faithful to the 
233
-P-A-G-E-248
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    rose, the rose is faithful to you.’’ Vishnu took her in his 
arms, and Brahma, bowing toward the ground, exclaimed, 
“Tt is as you have said. Vishnu shall be chief god hence- 
forth, for in his paradise is the rose, and that is supreme 
above all flowers.’’ 
The humanization of the rose in Lakshmi suggests the 
Roumanian legend of the rose-bush: that having achieved 
the utmost of beauty whereof a plant was capable, it sur- 
passed itself in one huge bud, which, opening, gave birth 
to a handsome prince. The young man grew and took his 
part in the affairs of men, but the juices of the rose still 
mingled in his blood, and he yearned for the tranquillity 
of his infancy. The knowledge that he might serve men 
through beauty, whereas in war and rapine he lived only 
for harm, eventually led him back to the scene of his birth. 
Trandafir (that was his name) stood in the wood alone and 
said to the trees, ‘‘I am of you. Where is the great rose- 
bush that bore me?’’ And the trees answered that it was 
dead. Then he asked of the birds, but all declared they 
could not remember it—all but one: the nightingale. ‘‘The 
rose-tree is gone,’’? he sang, ‘‘and I am come to chant a 
dirge over the spot where it stood. It was a noble tree, 
and it had a prince for a flower.’’ 
“‘T am that prince,’’ answered Trandafir. ‘‘I am weary 
of the human life. I wish to go back to the life of fra- 
grance and serenity: the life that menaces no other life, and 
leaves the world better when it is ended.’’ 
Then said the nightingale, ‘‘May it be as you wish, O 
prince. I will stay till I have sung your soul back into 
a rose.’’ 
With a sigh of content, the prince cast himself upon the 
earth in the spot where he had been born, and at nightfall 
the bird began to sing, softly, then louder and more sweetly. 
The music mingled with the prince’s dreams and cast out

all memory of the world of men. He sank into the moss 
more deeply; roots began to extend themselves from his 
limbs and penetrate the mold in all directions; his eyes 
closed to the earth, lifting only to the sky; and at dawn, 
behold, a rose-tree, which was Trandafir. 
We live in a bleak, material age, yet we can be thankful 
that so much of its ancient romance lingers in our flower. 
Can you be a Saxon peasant long enough, in your imagina- 
tion, to conceive the sincerity of his belief that when a little 
child dies those who are watching at the window can see the 
shadowy form of Death steal from the house, enter the gar- 
den, and there pick a flower? Or, can you regard with 
more than adult lenity for the conceits of the children of 
our race, that belief of the Scandinavians that the rose 
was under protection of fairies and dwarfs, whose king was 
Laurin, lord of the rose garden? This inclosure had four 
gates, and should one intrude after the gates were closed, 
woe was his portion, while the daring thief who plucked 
a flower was to lose a hand or foot. 
/ The medicinal use of roses goes as far back as the known 
history of the plant. Milto, a maid who gave a daily offer- 
ing of flowers to Venus, was not forgotten by that goddess 
in a time of need, for when her beauty was threatened by a 
tumor on the chin, Venus appeared to her in a dream and 
bade her apply roses from her altar to the swelling. The 
cure was so effective that when King Cyrus saw her he was 
smitten by her beauty and obtained her as a wife. ‘Accord- 
ing to Pliny, the rose, in his day, formed not only a part 
of perfumes and ointments, but of physic, entering into 
“emplastres and collyries or eye-salves.’’ He gives thirty- 
two remedies compounded of its leaves and petals, and we 
have his prescription for making rose wine. It was alleged 
that the drinking of rose wine and sleeping on pillows of 
rose-leaves allayed nervousness, as all fragrance is likely 
235

  to do, but we are also told how Heliogabalus, having sick- 
ened from bathing in rose wine, eating overmuch of rose 
salads and conserves, and lolling on rose-couches, was re- 
stored to health with a ‘‘rose draft,’’ thereby discovering 
homeeopathy to a waiting world. 
They had, in the old days, rose water, rose ointment, 
rose conserve, sugar of roses, roses kept in wax, rose essence 
to burn on coals, rose sauce, rose cream, rose tinctures, pas- 
tels, pastes, syrups, lozenges, and cordials. The flower 
was served at table, either as cress and parsley are used 
to-day, as a garnish, or as a salad, for the leaves were 
sprinkled on meats, and the juice expressed to savor certain 
dishes—a proceeding that ‘‘gave no harm, but gave a com- 
mendable taste thereto.’? Gourmets used quince preserves 
flavored with rose as a quip to their meat; there was rose 
vinegar, made of sour wine in which flowers had been 
macerated; there were rose souffiées for the ladies, if any 
were too delicate to drink the rose liqueur, and at this day 
rose fritters are served by the Chinese on their new year. 
Science has tried to make of this flower something other 
than the rose, but always with indifferent success. It is 
almost a fixed principle in botany that blossoms showing 
two of the primary colors will not enlarge into the third. 
Thus, asters are red and blue, but never yellow; chrysanthe- 
mums are red and yellow, but never blue; pansies are never 
red; lilies are never blue; so with carnations; and the blue 
rose has been sought, yet never realized, in spite of occa- 
sional rumors from London and Persia.) Yellow may be 
changed by the expert horticulturist into red or white, 
as in some strains of the chrysanthemum, or pink into yel- 
low, as in certain carnations; blue, also, will pass into pur- 
ple and red, but not into yellow; and as there is a red 
and a yellow rose, there will be no blue one. Indeed, one 
or two floriculturists assert that there is no true white

rose; that all which are so called disclose a tinge of pink or 
yellow near the base of the petal. A grower in Portland, 
Oregon, who has succeeded so well with the variety known 
as the Marchioness of Londonderry as to produce a bloom 
seven inches in diameter, calls attention to this quality, for 
he discovers that if placed beside snow, milky quartz, or 
any other object of absolute white, his pet blossom shows 
a tinge of yellow. 
Artificial treatment has increased the varieties of this 
flower. The Greeks knew four of them, and they still 
grow in the Morea, but the Crusaders brought other species 
from the east, the damasks of Damascus being carried by 
them in 1100 a.p., to Provence, whence they flourished 
exceedingly, as they did in all the western lands. We are 
told of one in Caserta, Italy, that clambered to the top of a 
poplar sixty feet high, and of one in Toulouse with a stem 
eleven inches thick, that bore sixty thousand flowers in a 
summer. Five centuries after its introduction to France 
the rose had taken on a score of forms; in 1800 there were 
forty-six; and now their name is legion. Taking, not the 
legend maker’s, but the botanist’s, ascription, the flower 
was born in Persia, and it is believed to have been intro- 
duced into Europe by Alexander the Great. 
The rose is brother, sister, and cousin to a score of valued 
herbs and trees: to the apple, pear, raspberry, strawberry, 
blackberry, to the luscious sweetbriar that we sniff in the 
Rocky Mountains on a summer morning, and leave unpicked, 
wildest, shyest, happiest of the family; yet valued most are 
the stately creatures of the garden, a noble company: the 
Persian, golden, imperial; the white, for brides, for children 
at their christenings, for maids at their funerals; pink for 
youth and modesty; crimson for fulness of life, for splen- 
dor, for wreaths of conquerors.. Mystic, beautiful, with our 
faces against theirs, we drink the breath of the earth that 
237

has turned to spirit; inhaling their fragrance, we taste the 
air of paradise. 
One of the prettiest survivals of old-world custom is 
the crowning of the rose queens. She of Salency, near 
Paris, has a titular descent from the fifth century, the first 
to hold the office being the sister of St. Medard, Bishop of 
Noyon. That girl succeeds to the title who is judged to be 
the kindliest, prettiest, and most modest. She must also 
have a respectable parentage, for the rose queen of Salency 
is practically vouched for by the lord of the district, her 
name is proclaimed from the pulpit on the Sunday after 
his choice, and all who knew of any impediment to her 
acceptance of the honor are bidden to make it public. On 
the 8th of June, the Rosiére, in white, attended by twelve 
girls in white and blue, twelve boys, and her relatives, goes 
to the castle, where the Seigneur receives them and leads 
the procession to the church. Vespers being sung, the 
erown of flowers is blessed and placed on the recipient’s 
head, while a purse of five dollars is put into her hand, and 
the Te Deum is sung after another march through the 
village. The names of all the Rosiéres are carved in the 
chapel of St. Medard, but a few have been effaced, because 
the girls fell from grace afterward. The coronation seems 
to have been associated with a practice in rural France of 
giving to daughters a rose crown as a marriage portion, 
except where there were no sons to inherit the more stable 
property. 
At Toulouse the love of the French for roses was also 
shown in the award of one of these flowers for the best poem 
offered at a public reading. Mary Queen of Scots sent to 
the poet Ronsard (who had been baptized in rose-water) 
a silver rose worth two thousand five hundred dollars for 
his festal poem. Indeed, such was the esteem of the rose 
in Europe that in the middle ages it had a Sunday of its 
238

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
own: for then it had become the Virgin’s flower, Venus 
having left the earth, reluctant, in the train of the bright 
gods of Greece. Rose Sunday perpetuated the tradition 
that after the Virgin ascended to heaven roses and lilies 
were found to have filled her tomb. And it is odd that we 
should find the revival of the observance in our matter- 
of-fact United States, for here Rose Sunday is celebrated 
every year. Itis worthy of note that the ceremonies attend- 
ant on it are most faithfully followed in the Universalist 
Church, which is as far removed as possible from the 
Church of Rome. It is a pretty observance, when babes are 
brought for christening. As each child receives its name, 
it takes from the pastor’s hand the ‘‘gift of the rose, a 
symbol of the unfolding of the beautiful life.’’ 
Though not a moral tale, ‘‘The Golden Ass’’ contains 
a certain symbolism in that the rose becomes the means of 
salvation. Here Apuleius relates the transformation of a 
young man into a beast, thereby indicating the effect of 
passion in degrading the human subject and leading him to 
folly. To secure his redemption, he is to eat a rose, and his 
trials, difficulties, and sufferings while seeking this remedy, 
form the substance of the story. At last the rose is dis- 
covered in the hand of a priest of Isis, the goddess having 
revealed herself in a dream, that the youth might know 
where to find it. On eating the rose, he regains his human 
shape and becomes a priest himself. 
It may be no occult relation which the rose has to relig- 
ious history and practice. The use of the rosary is one 
of the oldest of these applications, for although adapted to 
the uses of the Roman church by St. Dominick, beads were 
used for ‘‘telling’’? prayers by the Mahometans, also by 
Egyptian anchorites, Chinese Confucians, and Hindu and 
Japanese Buddhists, long before the birth of the dominant 
religion of Europe and America. Such beads were often 
239  
-P-A-G-E-254
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
carved into a rude likeness to roses, and were sometimes 
made of rose-petals pressed into spheres.. The fifteen large 
beads of the chain represent pater-nosters, and the one 
hundred and fifty small ones stand for Ave Marias. Buddh- 
ists use a chain of one hundred and eight beads, for they 
have one hundred and eight sins. The word bead, or bede, 
by the by, means prayer. This rosary, or rosenkrantz, is 
prefigured in pictures, statuary, and decorations as a 
wreath or garland of roses, sometimes placed on the head, 
as a mark of respect, sometimes worn in token of a festival 
spirit and social gaiety. Just when the flowers were given 
over for their conventional representations we do not know, 
although in the thirteenth century London had mechanics 
known as paternosters, whose work was the turning, pierc- 
ing, and mounting of beads for devotional purposes. These 
men lived and worked in Paternoster Lane, close to St. 
Paul’s. Yet the prayer beads were older than the pater- 
nosters, for Lady Godiva, she of the famous ride through 
Coventry, bequeathed her circlet of gems, by which she had 
often ‘‘told’’ her prayers, to the monastery she had 
founded. 
The Christian legend of the rosary is this: A young 
man who, in his free days, had twined a wreath of roses 
every morning to crown a statue of the Virgin, became a 
monk, and the tasks put upon him in the convent often left 
him no time for this pleasant practice. He asked an aged 
brother what he would advise as a substitute for the offer- 
ing, explaining that even as he had suffered the prick of 
thorns in gathering the flowers, for the Virgin’s sake, so 
his conscience rankled now. He was told to say his Aves 
in great number every evening, for prayers were as accept- 
able as flowers in heaven. Once in a dark wood where he 
had stopped to pray, a band of robbers overheard him, 
for, quite unknown to himself, he had paused near their 
240
-P-A-G-E-255
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
camp. When the fervent tones of prayer reached their 
ears, they stole softly through the brush and stood watching 
him from the shadows. As he prayed a light slowly issued 
from the earth and enveloped him as a luminous mist; it 
hovered about his head; it increased and took on form, that 
of an august and beautiful woman. This shape he did not 
see, any more than he had seen the bandits; but the woman, 
bending down, placed her hand at his lips and drew from 
them fifty splendid roses, for his words had taken form as 
flowers, and binding them into a shining chaplet she placed 
them on his down-bent head. The robbers, startled and im- 
pressed, joined their prayers to his, asking forgiveness for 
their evil life and promising to amend it forthwith. Indeed, 
they presently became inmates of the same monastery as 
the man who had been the unconscious instrument in their 
conversion. 
Roses are often pictured on the brows and in the hands 
of saints who suffered martyrdom for the church, and it 
is recorded of St. Vincent that the bed on which he died 
was formed of them. He had borne serenely the tortures 
whereto he had been condemned, so Diocletian’s proconsul 
resolved on other measures. ‘‘Release him,’’ he com- 
manded, ‘‘and let us see what effect luxury will have on 
his stubborn nature. Let his friends come to him, give 
him wine and food in plenty and of good quality. If he 
keeps his stern views of duty and doctrine after that, we 
may try the torture again.’’ So the saint was taken from 
the rack, and as a first indication of his new and worldly 
life he was laid on the couch of flowers; but though he had 
made no outery he was too far spent with suffering to know 
or care on what manner of bed they placed him, and so, 
on petals red as the blood he had lost, he sighed away his 
life. 
The rose is the ‘‘attribute’’ of St. Rosa of Viterbo, 
16 241

famous for charity and austerity in the thirteenth century, 
and of St. Rosalia of Palermo. The latter, whose statue 
stands before the cave on Monte Pellegrino, where she lived, 
—high above the world, alone, at almost constant prayer,— 
began her life as a recluse at the age of sixteen and died 
in her hiding place, unknown to her former friends. When 
her body was found it was uncorrupted, although she had 
been dead for days, and on her head was a crown of roses 
of such size and splendor that they could have come only 
from the gardens of heaven. 
In the annual feast of the Madonna of the Snows, which 
is celebrated in the Borghese chapel, showers of white 
rose-leaves are thrown from holes in the ceiling, ‘‘like a 
leafy mist between the priests and worshippers.’’ This is 
to commemorate the appearance of the Virgin in a fall of 
snow on Mount Esquilin. . 
The early Christians held our flower in esteem, Clement 
of Alexandria maintaining that it should be used only in 
religious functions, for Christ had worn a crown of thorns, 
and the rose, by wearing thorns also, commended itself to 
holy purposes. It is a curious circumstance that in a few 
instances the flower became an expression of a wrong action 
or a rejected faith. During a session of the Christian 
synod at Nismes in 1284 every Jew in town was forced 
to wear a rose on his breast, in token of a holiday spirit he 
did not feel, while in Germany it had to be worn as a 
punishment for immoral conduct, indicated in its red color 
and its thorn. More pleasing was the custom in the Enga- 
dine, which entitled a man accused of crime, but acquitted 
on the same day—impossible expedition in the law!—to 
receive a white rose as a token of innocence from the hand 
of the prettiest girl in the village. 
Ceremonial regard goes back for many centuries, for the 
Romans looked on the secular use of flowers that had been 
W442

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
dedicated to the gods not merely as in bad taste, but as 
sacrilegious; indeed, the banker Lucius Fulvius was sent 
to prison for sixteen years by the senate for appearing in 
public with a garland of sacred roses on his head, while P. 
Munatius was put into chains for stripping the roses from 
a statue of Marsyas. These acts were regarded as a mem- 
ber of the Roman church would view the stealing of flowers 
that had been placed on the altar as a decoration for the 
mass. 
Gerarde—he of the Great Herball—declares that the 
rose ‘‘doth preserve the chiefest and most principal place 
among all floures whatsoever, being not only esteemed for 
his bountie, vertues and his fragrant smell, but also be- 
cause it is the honour and ornament of our English 
sceptre.’” For of course its significance in Britain is de- 
rived from the wars of the roses, which began in 1450 with 
the plucking of white and red roses in the Temple garden, 
London, as badges for the rival houses of York and Lan- 
easter. These flowers—worn in the caps of the contestants, 
or pictured in broideries and illuminations on clothing, 
shields, and armor—marked the factions in a civic struggle 
that lasted for thirty years and cost the lives of one hundred 
thousand men. When the war ended, with the marriage 
of Henry VII., of the Lancastrian branch, to Elizabeth, 
Duchess of York, a rose appeared in a monastery garden 
in Wilts that bore both red and white petals. Until then 
the bush had borne roses of red on some of its branches and 
of white on others. 
In one legend the rose was created by Cybele and nour- 
ished by the nectar of the gods. In another it had its origin 
in the carelessness of Cupid, for the little god, hurrying 
to a council of the deities on Olympus with a vase of nectar, 
was heedless of his footing, and, stumbling, spilled the 
precious liquor on the earth. It bubbled up again in roses.

The rose had Zephyr for a lover, and would open only 
at his caress. Cupid, having kissed it, was stung on the lip 
by a bee concealed in its cup, and his mother, to punish the 
insect, captured so many bees that the youngster beaded 
them along his bow string from end to end, while Venus, 
still moved by anger, planted their stings along the stem 
of the flower by which the boy had got his hurt. Yet an- 
other Greek tradition relates that the rose grew red with 
shame when it saw that it had pricked the foot of Venus 
as she chased Adonis. With its ‘‘divine oil’’ she had 
covered Hector’s body after his death, and so preserved it. 
For this was the flower of Venus; hence it was given to the 
diners at banquets as a reminder that love affairs, told when 
spirits were high and tongues adventurous, were not to be 
babbled over the cups, or under other circumstances and in 
other places. Hence arose the use of the rose as a symbol 
of secrecy, and in time the giving of flowers simplified and 
conventionalized into the hanging of one blossom over the 
table, whence the term, ‘‘under the rose.’’ There is an 
authority who says that the phrase ‘‘under the rose,’’ as 
implying secrecy, dates from 477 8.c., when the Spartans 
and Athenians were intriguing with Xerxes for giving 
Greece into the hands of that emperor. The meeting was 
held in a bower of roses near the temple of Minerva. As 
the plotting was carried on with extreme caution, it be- 
came a custom to allude to that and similar meetings as 
held ‘‘under the rose,’’ and for some time after, the long- 
locked Athenians would wear roses in their hair when they 
wished it to be known that they addressed a friend or 
friends in confidence. 
In one of their early legends, the Greeks represent the 
first rose as a maid of intellect, pride, and beauty, whose 
hand had been sought by kings. In the Homeric days men 
seem to have made love by platoons. Rhodanthe bade

them earn her favor by feats of arms, then, to be rid of 
them, she entered a temple of Apollo and Diana, hoping to 
find concealment there. But her lovers were unexpectedly 
prompt, for they attacked the temple itself. Rhodanthe, 
hurrying into their presence with a ery of protest, appeared 
in such a glow of anger that her beauty was heightened, 
and the lovers cried anew, ‘‘Let her be a god and replace 
Diana!’’ Swept from her feet by the host and lifted to 
the pedestal which the effigy of the moon goddess had occu- 
pied till that moment, Rhodanthe assumed an air so uncon- 
sciously commanding that Apollo, looking from his chariot, 
and fierce at this insult to his sister, shot his sun arrows 
at her till she wilted like a plant. Her feet rooted to the 
stone, her arms shrank and crooked and took on leaves, 
and presently her charm had transformed to roses. The 
only relic of her pride was the thorn. 
Among the Romans were sybarites who slept on beds 
stuffed with rose petals, and we hear of one afflicted youth 
who could not sleep because a petal had been crumpled. 
Veres travelled in a litter canopied with a net of these 
flowers, so that their odor was never out of his nostrils. 
In the rose feasts of Nero, that luxurious tyrant is pictured 
as necklaced and crowned with flowers, lying on pillows 
stuffed with petals, which were also strewn over the floor, 
while fountains flung up rose-water. He spent one hun- 
dred and fifty thousand dollars for roses at a single supper. 
Wine served at his banquets was flavored with rose, and 
among the desserts was usually a rose pudding. Before 
and after the feasts his guests were free to bathe in marble- 
lined pools, and the water was perfumed with roses. 
Imagine Rome on a feast day, when the shrines and 
triumphal arches were garlanded with roses, when chariots 
were gay with them, when senators and generals did not 
disdain to carry bouquets of them in their hands, for they 
245

had been given as tokens of admiration by the populace. 
“People were not content unless roses swam in the Falernian 
wine,’’ according to one authority, for their petals lent their 
fragrance to the drink. At the Baie regattas and water 
parties, the Lucrine Sea was strewn with flowers. It fol- 
lows that rose culture was an important industry, and that 
the output on some of the rose farms exceeded anything 
of which we have knowledge in America. Cleopatra, at 
her banquet to Antony, carpeted her hall to the depth of 
an ell with roses. Heliogabalus bathed and even swam in 
rose wine. Such was the attention given to the cultivation 
of the rose in gardens that Horace laments the want of 
room for useful vegetables. There were traders who dealt 
in nothing but these flowers, and gardeners who made a 
specialty of grafting, pruning, budding, fertilizing, and 
smoking them. Children were accustomed to plant a rose 
on the day when their parents returned from a long jour- 
ney, and the soldier would plant one when he returned from 
war. It was usual for Romans of wealth and station to 
provide in their wills for the planting of flowers about their 
tombs, and we read of one who left a certain sum for the 
planting of three myrtles and three roses above his ashes 
on each anniversary of his birth. These ashes of the dead, 
after incineration, were sprinkled with wine, incense, and 
rose-leaves before they were poured into the urn, and on 
the Rose Feast (May 23) the urns were decorated by sur- 
viving relatives. According to Tacitus, the whole battle- 
field of Bedriacum was strewn with laurels and roses, and 
this annual feast ended with a banquet at which each par- 
ticipant received roses, which he placed on the tombs of 
those he most revered. At all the banquets of the rich 
these blooms were freely employed, the triclina being stuffed 
with them, others being scattered over the floor, and the 
participants sprinkled with sweet waters. We hear of

- caravans despatched with roses from Milan to the Emperor 
Carinus in the year 281, and of fleets laden with them 
sailing from Alexandria and Carthage. Portraits, statues, 
and tombs were festooned with these flowers, they were 
flung before returning troops in the triumphs, and tossed 
into the chariots of the generals. So common was the 
practice of strewing roses over graves that the cemetery is 
still called ‘‘the rose garden’’ in parts of Switzerland, 
and the flower is sculptured on the tombs of girls in 
Turkey, where it is believed that the rose came from 
Mahomet. ‘The tradition is that when he made his journey 
from heaven the sweat that fell from his forehead bloomed 
from the earth as white roses. 
Flowers are of ancient use in funerals, and lend them- 
selves as easily to them as to weddings and christenings, 
softening grief and cold by their bright color and glad 
odor. Not only were they so used by the Greeks and 
Romans, but savages strewed them on the biers of their 
dead. In Wessex and Cornwall a wreath, denoting purity, 
was carried before a girl’s body to the grave, by some 
maid of her age, then hung over the seat she had occupied 
in churech—white roses. The red rose, per contra, was for 
life—love—the blood of broken hearts, or hearts that 
throbbed with happiness, and when an English girl died 
during her engagement she was buried with red roses on 
her breast. 
St. Denis, guardian saint of France, was bewitched in 
a strange and lonely land. He had no food but vegetables 
and fruit, for not a creature could he slay, and his horse 
was his only company. Wandering, he knew not whither, 
he found, after a time, a tree bearing purple berries, and, 
being hungry and thirsty, he fed upon them eagerly. It 
was not a meal to increase one’s bulk, but, after a little, 
his head grew so heavy that he was forced to drop upon 
247

    all fours, and, coming shortly to a spring, where he bent 
to drink, he tried to cry out, being so moved by astonish- 
ment; but only a snort came from his lips. The fruit had 
completed his enchantment. His helmet and armor had 
fallen off, showing his body covered with hair, horns 
branched from his forehead, his eyes were large, round, 
and frightened: he was a deer. Galloping back to the 
tree from which he had eaten, he fell on the earth and 
groaned in hopelessness. Then, to his surprise and com- 
fort, he heard an answering complaint. ‘‘ I am Eglantine, 
the king’s daughter,’’ spoke the tree, ‘‘punished for my 
too great pride. For seven years I must wear this shape, 
and for as long a time you must keep the form of a hart. 
But there will grow in this desert a purple rose, and if 
you eat of it your human form will return to you, and you 
will have power to free me. Then you must cut this tree 
and put me at liberty.’’ 
Nothing more said the tree, though the transformed 
knight waited and listened, and almost daily returned to 
visit and to lie beneath its branches. At the end of the 
seven years, which he counted with great impatience, keep- 
ing company with his horse, a deep sleep came over him, 
but his horse did not share it. The steed rambled away to 
a mountain where many roses bloomed, and among them 
was a bush of purple flowers. A branch of this the faithful 
creature picked and carried to its master. St. Denis, 
waking and seeing the flowers beside him, was filled with 
joy, and he eagerly devoured the blossoms, which caused 
him to lapse into another sleep. In the morning he arose 
as a man, and, with many tokens of gratitude to his horse, 
he found and resumed his armor and rode away to the 
tree where Eglantine awaited deliverance. With one tre- 
mendous blow of his sword he severed the trunk, and it 
fell to the earth in a fire and cloud of smoke. As the air 
248

  cleared, he saw standing before him a beautiful girl with 
downeast eyes. ‘‘I do not know whether you are angel, 
fairy, or woman,’’ he said, ‘‘but I am right glad to set 
you free and would continue to serve you, if I might.’’ 
The maiden asked only that he would take her to her 
father’s palace, where she was doubtless mourned as dead. 
Her vanity was gone; her lesson had been learned. And 
as she had some memory of the way, they crossed the wil- 
derness in safety, and so into the unenchanted and beautiful 
world for which they had grieved so long. In time they 
reached the palace, where great welcome was given to 
them and St. Denis received high honor. Even the horse 
was cared for with lavish hospitality. The rose of salva- 
tion was then named Eglantine, in memory of the princess. 
In Persia they commemorate with a feast of roses an 
incident in the life of Zoroaster, or Zarathustra. The in- 
fant sage was taken from his people by the king, whose 
astrologers had warned him that the babe would be a 
menace to him, and was placed on a pile of burning logs. 
The little Zoroaster did not even wake, for the brands 
became flowers—a bed of roses. Those flames were first 
caught up by priests and have been transmitted as a holy 
fire, which has been kept alive to this day, and give rise 
to the name of fire-worshipper as applied to those who 
accept the Zoroastrian doctrine. 
It is in Persia, too, that the bulbul; or nightingale, be- 
gins to sing when the roses blow, for so the bird tells his 
love for the flower, and at dawn, overcome by weariness 
and by the perfume, he falls to the earth beneath the bush. 
When Allah made the rose queen of flowers, instead of the 
white and sleepy lotus, the impassioned nightingale, flying 
toward the perfume, thrust one of the thorns against his 
breast, and so spilling his blood over the petals, changed 
them to red; and even now the Persian tells you that he

presses against a thorn that he may be kept awake all 
night to worship and to sing. And as he sings, the rose, 
responsive, bursts from bud to bloom. 
From this land of Persia we have the attar, or oil of rose. 
It is told how the favorite sultana of Jehangir prepared 
the bath for her lord by throwing rose-leaves into the water. 
A little shining fluid came to the surface, and, fearing 
that this might irritate his majesty, she had the pool 
skimmed clear of it. Such a fragrance arose from the 
oil that the idea of preserving it was at once suggested. 
Avicenna, the Arabian doctor, conceived the idea of extract- 
ing this substance by distillation, and even now in some 
Persian houses the guest will receive an asperge of it as 
he enters. Avicenna’s discovery was made in 1187. 
Naturally, the rose figures in oriental poetry, and the 
Gulistan (place of roses) is an expression of the national 
spirit, of love, of music and of all delights. It was 
reserved for two western poets, however, to tell the Ro- 
mance of the Rose, for this was begun in the thirteenth 
century by Guillaume di Lorris and continued by Jean de 
Meung in the fourteenth. In this we read—if we have 
patients to follow a matter of twenty thousand verses— 
how Dame Idleness takes the poet to the Palace of Pleasure 
and gives him into the charge of Love, Sweet-Looks, Cour- 
tesy, Youth, Joy, and Competence, who lead him to a 
bank of roses. He chooses one, but at the moment Love 
with an arrow stretches him helpless on the earth. Com- 
ing to his senses, he determines to regain the flower, and 
in a symbolic narrative that suggests ‘‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’’ 
now aided, now deterred, by Welcome, Shyness, Fear, 
Slander, Reason, Pity, Jealousy, and Kindness, he finds 
the object of his search. 
Our gracious flower sprang in the footsteps of the just, 
bloomed on their graves in the belief of the faithful, and 
250
-P-A-G-E-267

  was ever regarded as sanction and proof of their virtue. 
It embodied the spirit of goodness, and even in our day 
the Cuban poet Cazals planted on his mother’s grave a 
rose which he insisted was kept alive by his mother’s spirit, 
and spoke to him in the wind, just as Paganini, who had 
held his violin to the lips of his dying mother, heard her 
voice in the instrument whenever he played it afterward. 
One of the legends of the crucifixion names the rose 
brier, or dog rose, as the plant chosen for the 
crown of thorns. It was by the dog rose that Satan 
tried to climb back to heaven, and this is one of 
many ‘‘ trees’’ on which Judas was hanged. As drops of the 
Saviour’s blood fell on the earth, roses sprang from the 
spot and blossomed. And in Bethlehem was the Field of 
Flowers, to which a girl was taken to be burned on a 
wrongful charge of crime. She prayed for a miracle to let 
her innocence be known. In answer to her prayer the 
flames died and the fagots burst into leaf, their last embers 
expanding into crimson roses, while the unburned wood 
and ashes became roses of white. A similar tale is told by 
the Ghebers, of Abraham, when he was thrown into fire at 
Nimrod’s order, adding that he was not even wakened by 
the flames, but slept among the flowers till morning. The 
relation of this story to that of Zoroaster is plain. 
Another sun legend, this from Roumania, is of a prin- 
cess bathing in the sea, who, being seen by Apollo, so 
filled his heart with love that for three days he forgot to 
urge on the horses of the sun, remaining stationary in 
the sky, watching for her reappearance and delighting in 
her memory while she slept. As a consequence of his 
neglect to move forward and bring night to the world’s 
relief, the heat was so great that the girl was fain to leave 
her house and bathe for coolness the oftener. When he 
had descended to declare his love, his fervent kisses filled

her with such confusion that she hung her head and 
blushed, and that attitude and color of modesty have per- 
tained to her ever since, for she is the rose. 
St. Francis of Assisi, being tempted by the devil to leave 
the monastic life and go back to the ease, comfort, and 
cleanliness he had left, was so tormented by these sugges- 
tions that he left his cell, went into the bleak hills, and 
rolled in the snow. Now, there were at that place many 
rose-bushes, and as it was the deep of the year, without 
life on earth, they were as stalks and fagots. His poor rag 
of a gown was no protection, and the thorns cruelly tore his 
flesh. Yet he bowed himself repeatedly against them, 
thinking on the thorns of the Crucified One and suffering 
willingly. He went out with the feeling, unexpressed to 
himself, that his cell would be a more tolerable place for 
the contrast with the sharp weather, and he would go back 
to it, narrow, hard, comfortless, as it was, with a sense of 
gladness. By physical pain, his thoughts would be at 
least diverted from the images of luxury and satisfied 
desire. Nature pitied his plight, however, and heaven 
sorrowed for his tempting, for straightway the sun shone 
bright, a warm wind breathed across the land, and lo! 
the blood of Francis, that dripped from the thorns, burst 
into flower as roses. The saint gathered many and placed 
them on the earth: a gift to Christ and Mary. His offer- 
ing was accepted, for angels came, and, gathering the 
flowers, arose with them to the sky, their fragrant petals 
showering about the praying figure. 
Mythologists may relate this legend to the older one, 
lately quoted, that red roses grew from thorns that had 
pricked the feet of Venus, and so were crimsoned as she 
ran through the wood seeking Adonis; that yellow roses 
were smitten to that color by the setting sun on the day he 
died, while white roses sprang from her tears. The tale

that the red rose was originally white, but blushed with joy 
when Eve kissed it in Eden, is doubtness of later origin than 
the Venus myth. There is, however, a Talmudic legend, as 
ancient as the Greek, that tells how the rose was painted 
red: 
At midnight before the vernal equinox, when Cain 
and Abel were to make their offerings to the Lord, a vision 
came to their mother, Eve. She saw a little lamb bleeding 
its life away on Abel’s altar, and the white roses he had 
planted about it were suddenly full blown and red. Voices 
cried about her, as in despair, but they died away and only 
a wonderful music was heard instead. Then, as the 
shadows lifted from her eyes, a vast plain unfolded, more 
beautiful than the paradise she had left, and grazing there 
were flocks watched by a shepherd whose robe of white 
was so fine and shining that the eye was dazzled by it. He 
wore a wreath of roses which Eve recognized as having 
lately grown about the altar, and he struck the strings of 
a lute, waking entrancing harmony. 
Day broke, and, dismissing the vision as an idle dream, 
Eve watched her sons as they went forth to make sacrifice 
to the deity. She heard the cries of the little creatures 
of the flocks as they were put to death, and was glad that 
her children were willing to do this thing in the belief 
that suffering was agreeable to the author of life and 
love. At evening her sons were still afield, and as dark- 
ness came she went to seek them. Her dream returned 
to her, and she was disturbed. The fires on the two altars 
had burned out, and the bodies of the lambs were charred 
and broken. From a cave hard by sounded roarings of 
despair: she knew the voice for Cain’s. And before his 
younger brother’s altar lay the most pitiful sacrifice of all: 
the body of Abel, cold and rigid; and his blood had bespat- 
tered all the roses he had planted. Eve sank upon the 
253 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
body of her son, and again the vision of the night returned: 
she saw the shining one again, and it was Abel who shep- 
herded in the new paradise. He wore the roses, but they 
were beautiful and fragrant, and, striking the harp in a 
triumphant measure, he sang, ‘‘Look up and see the stars 
shining promise through your tears. Those cars of light 
shall carry us to fields more blooming than Eden. There 
sighs and moans change to hymns of rapture, and there 
the rose that has been stained with innocent blood blooms 
in splendor.’’ 
Then Eve was comforted, and, gathering the roses he 
had planted, she bound them about his cold brow as she 
had seen him wear them in the vision, and buried him 
before the altar, just as the rose of a new day unfolded in 
the east. 
This is the legend of St. Dorothea, of Cappadocia. For 
her faith she was arrested and taken before the governor, 
Sapricius, who threatened her with grievous injuries unless 
she renounced Christ. She answered only, ‘‘Do your 
worst. I shall feel no pain, so long as I am ready to die 
for Him.”’ 
““To whom do you refer?’’ asked the ruler. 
“He is Christ of whom I speak, the Son of God.’’ 
“‘Where is He?”’ 
‘Over all the earth and in all the heaven. It is from 
heaven that He summons us—heaven, where the lilies 
. always bloom, the roses are in flower, the fields are always 
green, and the water of life springs forth continually.’’ 
A mocking lawyer, named Theophilus, cried at this, ‘‘T 
should like to see those roses. I beg you, send me some.’’ 
Dorothea answered simply, ‘‘I will.’’ 
The governor, persuaded that it was necessary for the 
political safety of his province to suppress this dangerous 
band of Christians, ordered the girl to the block, and after 
254

    her head had been struck off, Theophilus told his compan- 
ions, with laughter, how he had obtained the promise of 
roses from heaven. While he jeered there appeared be- 
side him a figure of the saint, tall, fair, exceeding white, 
and in her hand she bore a bunch of roses of wondrous 
size and color, which exhaled such fragrance that all the 
room was filled with it. They shed light as well as per- 
fume, and the mocker fell back in astonishment, remorse 
weighing at his eyes and plucking at his heart. Dorothea 
bade him take the flowers, which he did, and, convinced 
that the faith she had upheld was true, he chose it and made 
public confession of his choice before the same stern 
officer who had ordered her to be slain. Like her, he 
went forth to receive the baptism of blood, bearing the 
heavenly roses to the grave. 
Still better known than these traditions is the story 
of Elizabeth of Hungary. There are variants on this 
theme, the commoner representing her husband as a coarse 
tyrant; but such he was not. The cruel one was a plot- 
ting cleric, who had forced himself into the household as 
confessor, and used his place to gain money and power. 
Princess Elizabeth, suspecting guile of no man, was con- 
stant in her charities, and no doubt was as constantly 
imposed upon. On the day of the miracle Elizabeth was 
carrying food to a sick person when her husband came 
galloping through the wood and stopped before her. 
Noting that she carried a burden in a fold of her dress, 
he dismounted and reached toward it. ‘‘ You should not 
tire yourself in these works,’’ he said. ‘‘ Give me the 
parcel, and I will carry it for you. Happily those whom 
you bless with your charities are better able than you to 
walk these rough paths and carry bread and wine.’’ 
Half bashfully, half playfully, Elizabeth held her bur- 
den closer to her breast, and the husband also in mingled 
255

sport and earnest tried to wrest it from her. The wrapping 
fell away, and lo! the warmth of her heart had changed the 
bread and meat to white and red roses of amazing size and 
of such fragrance that the winter air seemed changed to 
summer. Standing apart from her in astonishment, the 
husband saw the lifted countenance of the saint shining 
with a soft, strange light, and in a low voice and on 
his knees he begged one flower, which he put into his breast. 
Then he rode away with downcast eyes, for he knew that, 
much as he loved his wife, and much as she loved him, 
heaven was between them. 
Famous among rose-trees is that of Hildesheim in Han- 
over, which is believed to be more than a thousand years 
old. Ludwig the Pious assembled his knights and his dogs 
one autumn morning in the year 814 and prepared for a 
day of happiness. He armed himself and his people with 
instruments for stabbing and cutting and set off to waste 
the innocent life of the forest that surrounded his castle. 
In haste to begin the killing, the company could hardly 
restrain its impatience while a priest invoked God’s bless- 
ing on the knives and spears, and on the dogs that would 
presently tear the flesh from victims of the sport. So soon 
as the Amen was pronounced, the troop galloped away with 
shouts and laughter, leaving untasted the holy bread and 
wine, used in the communion, on the ground where the 
priest had put them. Next day a rose bush was found 
shadowing the sacrament. It had sprung up as soon as the 
king was gone, and increased miraculously, and there the 
king ordered a chapel to be built. 
The golden rose is a decoration bestowed by the Popes 
on members of royal, noble, or distinguished families, 
soldiers, literary men, or, it may be, on congregations or 
even cities, that at the end of a year are proved to have 
256
-P-A-G-E-273
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
a | 
done much for the Church. The practice of bestowing this 
costly gift began in the twelfth century, and it was a sub- 
stitute for tokens of varied character, for we are told that 
one of the Popes sent a golden shirt to a king who had been 
zealous for the faith. The rose is blessed on the fourth 
Sunday in Lent, but if nobody appears worthy to receive it, 
it is put away in a cabinet of the Vatican, to be brought out 
and, if possible, awarded, next year. The first of these 
roses was a simple image of a flower, shaped with skill, 
but without decoration. As time went on it increased in 
size, a stem was added, then leaves, then the petals were 
doubled, then they were dewed with rubies and diamonds, 
and finally it evolved into a small bush bearing two or 
three flowers and set in a pot bearing the papal name and 
arms. One of these offerings, sent to a queen of France, 
weighed eight pounds and represented a value of one 
thousand eight hundred dollars in metal. Of late the 
stones and pearls that ornamented the branches have been 
omitted, and in recent days not even pure metal is used, 
for the token is of silver gilt, of small intrinsic value. 
There attaches to it an omen of ill fortune, that makes 
even devoted members of the Church unwilling to receive 
it, although American women to whom it has been given 
seem to be immune from evil consequences of the acceptance. 
Countess O’Leary, Marquise de Mermville, and the wife of 
General Sherman are these Americans. But among the 
women of its history, it is true that many were doomed to 
early or painful death, poverty, dethronement, or other 
misfortune. Joanna of Sicily, the first rose queen, was 
strangled; the Queen of Naples, Empress Josephine, Prin- 
cess Isabella of Brazil, the Queen of the Belgians, the 
Queen of Portugal, the Queen Regent of Spain, ex-Empress 
Eugenie, the Empress of Austria, Bloody Mary (daughter

    of Henry VIII., who himself received three of these roses), 
all suffered desertion, exile, political opposition, or assas- 
sination. 
Some early legends of the rose have been here set down, 
but the Orient has others, for it was in the east that the 
first moss rose grew. It had been like others until an angel 
slept beneath it. Waking, he thanked the bush for its 
shude and perfume and asked if he could grant any favor 
to it. ‘‘Yes,’’ replied the bush. ‘‘You have praised my 
beauty. I would wear one other grace, to prove that I 
can hear sweet words, yet retain modesty.’’ The angel 
touched it, and its stems and buds were clothed and soft- 
ened. To our day it has kept this delicate covering. 
Other myths of the Orient equal this for age, for they 
say that the rose disappeared from paradise when our 
parents fell, into knowledge. Long afterward there lived 
a Jewish maid, one Zillah, whose charms had spoiled the 
sleep of a young man, Hammel. His love she rejected; 
hence, wrathful and embittered, he charged her so explic- 
itly with lapses from virtue that the people demanded her 
death. She was tried, in the old harsh manner of a day 
when a man’s word weighed more than a woman’s oath, 
was found guilty and condemned to the stake. When 
Zillah was bound upon the fagots and the torch applied 
to them, the flames leaped forth like lightning, and pierced 
Hamil’s guilty breast; he toppled into the fire and was 
burned to a cinder at his victim’s feet—feet that were 
unscorched. As the wood sank beneath the girl’s weight, 
it was seen to lose its glow and take on a more tender 
hue than flame, while the smoke ceased to roll, and she 
breathed a ravishing sweetness in its stead. For the coals 
were roses—red where the brands had suddenly cooled to 
flowers; white where the wood had been unburned. Stand- 
ing on this cushion of bloom, unscathed and with height-

ened beauty, Zillah needed no words to proclaim her 
innocence. The priests were saddened as they thought how 
nearly they had debased their sacred office to abet the crime 
of Hammel. 
It is in a cold country, Russia, namely, where we would 
not look for a love of flowers, that we find an odd survival 
from that love. Until lately, and maybe even yet, a sentry 
paced a beat at Tsar-skoe-selo, the imperial domain, nine- 
teen miles from St. Petersburg. He never knew why, nor 
did the officers who stationed him, except that, ‘‘it was 
orders;’’ but it is because Empress Catherine a century 
ago commanded a soldier to guard a bush that had budded 
in a sheltered place in the garden, that no careless courtier 
or visitor might injure it. The roses ripened, were picked 
for the empress’s table, but nobody remembered the sentry, 
and as orders had been issued to maintain this beat, the 
guard detail included the bush. The roses faded, yet the 
sentry tramped on. What was a mere soldier? Winter 
came, yet still he paced, back and forth, in the arctic 
weather. The bush died. Catherine died. Sentries died, 
and others kept the earth worn smooth. And still the sen- 
tries pace, watching the ghost, the memory, of a flower. 
It is of another sort of soldier they tell in France, the 
General La Hoche. He, with other accused aristocrats, 
was immured in the Conciergerie. One morning there came 
to him from some unknown friend a splendid bouquet of 
roses. The haggard prisoners cried in delight at the sight 
and begged for them when he appeared at the leanly 
furnished table where they took their meals. Beginning 
with the women, fair daughters of misfortune whose pretty 
heads were so soon to be shorn away by the guillotine, 
he distributed the trophies, and it seemed as if the flowers 
brought light and hope into the gloomy place. The babble 
was almost cheerful. But while all tongues were wagging, 
259

the door grated on its hinges and an officer in black 
appeared, followed by a file of soldiers. He carried a 
paper holding a list of those who were to die. ‘‘Citizen,’’ 
said a young woman to La Hoche, ‘‘I shall wear your rose 
to the scaffold.”’ 
‘‘And we also,’’ cried the others. 
And when the tumbrils passed through the street the 
ruffians of the pavement looked in wonder, for every man 
held a rose to his lips, and every woman wore a rose in her 
bosom, a rose pale as death, or red as the blood that was 
shortly to be spilled in the name of justice, liberty and love. 
ROSEMARY 
This plant, which is not a rose and is not dedicated 
to Mary, takes its name from the Latin, ros marinum, or sea 
dew, for it is fond of the water. The Romans made 
decorative as well as ceremonial use of rosemary, crowning 
with it the guests at banquets, employing it in funeral 
rites, wreathing it on their household gods, and purifying 
their flocks with its smoke. They believed that the odor 
of the plant tended to preserve the bodies of the dead, and 
the lasting green of its leaves made it an emblem of eter- 
nity, for both which reasons they planted it near tombs. 
In northern England, a relic of this custom is seen in the 
bearing of rosemary in funeral processions, the sprays be- 
ing cast on the coffin in the grave. As a plant of remem- 
brance, it formed a part of bridal wreaths. When Christ- 
mas was the heartiest of holidays, rosemary decked the 
hall of feasting, the roast, the boar’s head, and the wassail 
bowl, this service in possible memory of the rosemary’s 
opening to hide the Virgin and her child from Herod’s 
soldiers—a legend it shares with the juniper and other 
trees. And because Mary spread the linen of her babe on 
260
-P-A-G-E-277
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
a rosemary, it flowers in memory of him on the day of the 
passion. In Sicily it is a heathen plant, for fairies nestle 
under it, disguised as snakes, which circumstance has not 
prevented its extensive cultivation, even in monastery gar- 
dens, where it was prized for its medicinal qualities. 
Mixed with rue, sage, marjoram, fennel, quince, and a few 
other matters—pity that the recipe could not have been 
preserved !—it kept one young so long as he wished to be. 
If a maid is curious as to her future, she may obtain 
information by dipping a spray of rosemary into a mixture 
of wine, rum, gin, vinegar, and water in a vessel of ground 
glass. She is to observe this rite on the eve of St. Magda- 
len, in an upper room, in company with two other maids, 
and each must be less than twenty-one years old. Having 
fastened the sprigs in their bosoms and taken three sips 
of the tonic—sips are quite enough—all three go to rest 
in the same bed without speaking. The dreams that fol- 
low will be prophetic. 
RUE 
Rue, herb of grace and memory, stands for repentance 
also, and we have made the word into a verb, the villain 
of melodrama assuring the heroine that she will rue the 
day when she refused to place herself in his power, as she 
invariably doesn’t. It drives away the plague if you 
merely smell of it; it keeps maids from going wrong in 
affairs of love, if only they will pause to eat it when 
tempted; it makes eyes keener and wits more eager; it 
heals the bites of snakes, scorpions, wasps, and bees. For 
internal poisons, it seems to have been no less effective than 
for snake bites; at least, Mithridates, whose subjects were 
continually trying to poison him, felt a need to accustom 
his stomach to innutritious material in the faith that if he 
eould not live on it, he could at least keep a-dying for an 
261 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
unconscionable while. And this antidote, which he would 
take after meals or before a glass, consisted of twenty rue- 
leaves, two figs, two walnuts, twenty berries of juniper, and 
a pinch of salt. 
If all this be not enough, you may, with rue, keep off 
epilepsy, dizziness, insanity, dumbness, inflammation of the 
eyes, and the evil eye. Boil gun-flints with rue and ver- 
vain, and the shot will reach your victim, human or defence- 
less. Lastly, carry a bundle of rue, broom, maiden-hair, 
agrimony, and ground ivy, and you may know every woman 
for a witch who is one, no matter how plain or otherwise 
she appears to you. 
SAGE 
It has been claimed that when the Virgin had begun 
her flight into Egypt she sought refuge from the hunters 
of Herod in a sage, which she blessed, whereupon the plant 
put forth a blush of fragrance in all its leaves. 
A later tale, which may have its roots in a sun or season 
myth of pre-Christian time, represents the sage as a nymph 
living in a hollow oak beside a pool where jonquils sprang, 
dulling her shyer beauty. But she had no jealousy. She 
looked into the water mirror and saw her own face there, 
without pride, and she looked on the blossoms of the 
wood and loved them. Long she lived there in peace and 
happiness, and did not know the human face. But the 
silence of the wood was disturbed by a call of horns and 
baying of hounds, and the king rode that way, hunting. 
As he came to the foot of the oak, where Sageflower stood, 
her modest beauty charmed him. It was death for her to 
love a mortal, yet so deep was the affection which the 
sight of the young king stirred in her breast that she made 
no attempt to check it. He had only to tell her of his love 
to receive her confession. ‘‘The fine days are gone,’’ she 
262  
-P-A-G-E-279
  
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    said, ‘‘ but solitude is still beautiful. Let us remain here 
alone together. It lightens my heart to be with you. You 
ask my love: I give you my life.’’ The king did not under- 
stand, and he folded her passionately in his arms. Sage- 
flower returned his caress, but her arms relaxed, her head 
drooped. The king placed her on the bank and hurried 
to dip water from the pool to revive her. But the heat 
of love had been more than the fragile Sageflower could 
endure. She had faded out of life. And the king went 
away, mourning. Which is a poetic way of saying that 
the flower loves the sun and fades in the heat after fertiliza- 
tion. 
Sage is a plant of wide range. Its ghostly tufts dot our 
Western deserts, and it also flourishes in our gardens, where 
it is picked for the stuffing of geese and turkeys. An 
ornate variety is the salvia, whose plumes are very flames 
of scarlet. In the middle ages, when plants were much 
more remarkable than now, the common sage prolonged life, 
heightened spirits, kept off toads, enabled girls to see their 
future husbands, mitigated sorrow, and averted chills. 
SAINT FOIN 
Saint foin—onobrychis sativa—memorized a saint of the 
name of Foin, in popular fancy in England; but the name 
is French and signifies holy hay. When the Holy Family 
arrived at Bethlehem and could obtain no room in the 
inn, a place was found in the stable, and the only bed that 
offered even there was the stone manger. So Joseph went 
about the fields gathering wisps of hay and stubble, which 
he spread as softly as he might, that his wife should suffer 
as little as possible; and most of this hay was the plant 
of rose-colored blooms that we now call lucerne, or cock’s 
head clover. The frosts had killed it, so that it was wholly 
263  
-P-A-G-E-280
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
dry, and on that rude but fragrant couch the little Jesus 
slept peacefully. When the wise men came, and He was 
lifted, that they might worship, behold, the saint foin 
had come to life again, and a circle of blossoms marked 
where His head had lain. So the Italians will deck their 
mangers with such plants as show green at Christmas, 
or with moss, as a substitute for the holy hay that was 
pressed by the infant Saviour. 
ST. JOHNSWORT 
Hypericum perforatum is supposed to show its red spots 
on the 29th of August, the day on which St. John was 
beheaded: hence its name of St. Johnswort; but it also 
wears the names of devil’s flight, and devil chaser, because 
if hung in windows on the anniversary of St. John’s birth, 
the 24th of June, it will keep away ghosts, devils, imps, and 
thunderbolts. Should you be tramping about the fields of 
the Isle of Wight, however, you must beware of trampling 
on this herb, for if you do a fairy horse will rise from 
its root, squarely under you, so that you shall find your- 
self mounted for a ride. All through the night the steed 
will carry you, up hill, down dale, and just at dawn will 
sink into the earth, wherever he happens to be, leaving 
you with the prospect of a weary walk to breakfast. Taken 
internally, the plant cures melancholy, ‘‘if it is gathered 
on a Friday in the hour of Jupiter, and worn away about 
the neck ’’; and if hung on the wall of a bedroom it enables 
a young and hopeful maid to dream of her future husband. 
SAL 
Shorea robusta, known to India as the sal, is a sacred 
tree, for the mother of Buddha held a branch of it when 
that founder of a faith was born, as if in token that it 
264
-P-A-G-E-281
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
—U~—TIIIIi IEE —————L—LLLZ£*{_— == 
should serve him for protection in his life; and when 
that life was about to end, Prince Buddha lay in the shelter 
of two sals at Kucinigara and took food at the hands of an 
artisan who dwelt in the grove of sals hard by. At the 
instant when the wife of Brahma was announcing that 
Buddha had entered paradise, the thunder rolled, the 
earth shook. But the life went out in beauty, for the sal 
trees bending above him burst into bloom, although it was 
not the flowering season, and while soft music sounded from 
the heavens, the trees showered their blossoms over him, 
covering the form of the perfect one with color and 
perfume. 
Tree marriage is a custom among the lower castes in 
India, the girl being mated to a sal, or even to a bunch of 
blossoms, if she can not find a man to marry her. There is 
a superstition that if a girl weds a tree and afterward a 
man, the dangers of a second marriage will all be imposed 
upon the tree, and it must thenceforth suffer the illnesses 
and injuries that might be visited on the bride; but another 
reason for the ceremony is that in wedding a tree the wife 
acquires something of its strength and fertility. 
SAXIFRAGE 
Burnet saxifrage (pimpinella saxifrage) is indeed a 
plant of magic value, for if a woman eats it, at least, in 
Italy, her beauty will increase. If a soldier will steep 
his sword in the blood of moles and the juice of pimpinella 
before going into battle, the blade will bite harder and do 
more mischief. Yet in a tale of Hungary it is as powerful 
to cure as it is to hurt, for King Chaba, having fought a 
terrible battle against his brother, that left him with 
fifteen thousand wounded soldiers on his hands, healed 
every one of their cuts with the juice of this little plant.

SHEPHERD’S PURSE 
Our common little peppergrass, or shepherd’s purse, 
was once known as pickpocket and pickpurse, because it 
sowed itself eagerly and so robbed the farmer of the fer- 
tility of his land. Among its other titles are St. James- 
wort, poor man’s pharmacetty, toywort, caseweed, and, 
in Ireland, clappedepouch. This last has reference to the 
likeness of its seed pouches to the leather wallets carried 
by licensed beggars and lepers, who would stand at the 
erossways by days together with a bell, wooden clapper, 
and pouch, summoning the public to give money or be vili- 
fied. Peppergrass is a name confined to New England, 
and betokens the smart of its flower stalks in the mouth 
when they are chewed. 
SILK COTTON 
In the West Indies grows a tree with huge roots that 
extend half way up the trunk in buttress-like extensions, 
and rounded masses of foliage in whose shade the native 
vendors doze while waiting to sell their wares. Yet the 
white man would pass under it with a shudder, could he 
believe, as the negroes do, that the tree is inhabited by 
cloudy forms and that death lurked in its trunk. Obeah, 
or voodoo, is a form of magic which in parts of the Antilles 
is unfortunately real. One may express such contempt 
as he will of the spells and incantations by which the obeah 
man seeks to injure the enemy of his client—for these 
conjurers sell their influence, like lawyers—but subtle 
murder has been done by these malignants, especially 
through the use of vegetable poisons. Where possible, they 
will obtain underclothing of the intended victim, steep it 
in the poison, and he dies a mysterious and lingering 
death, Diseases, too, have been disseminated through the 
266
-P-A-G-E-283
     
-P-A-G-E-284

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    use of infected clothing and articles of household use, 
Yet discovery and conviction of the conjurer are difficult, 
for he is held in such dread by the natives that they dare 
not confess what they know of him. His employers are not 
always so ignorant as his protectors; at least, one who was 
hanged in Jamaica involved several planters and white 
people of consequence in his confession. 
Now, this obeah man is in league with spirits, good and 
evil, such as the duppies, rolling calves, the mial people, 
the fan-eyed, and Anansi—a devil absurdly Englished as 
Aunt Nancy. And among the evils these creatures do is 
to steal the shadow of a man or woman, and thereby cause 
a decline in health, a wasting in substance, that has but one 
end: death. When a shadow is stolen it roosts in the silk 
cotton tree, invisible for much of the time, but a tree may 
be so filled with stolen shadows that in quiet weather they 
ean be heard whispering and rustling among the leaves. 
A negro will rarely put an ax to the tree, for fear of these 
larve, and also because the deaths that live in the trunk 
will enter his soul through his nostrils if he tries to 
destroy it. To the end of pacifying the deaths, and the 
shadows, and the duppies, a sort of worship, as of the 
Druids, is ordained. When an obeah man has charmed 
away a shadow, the unhappy one who misses that adjunct 
hies him at once to an angel man, or shadow-catcher, to 
pray it out of the keeping of the ceiba, or silk cotton. A 
high price is charged for the job, for the angel men who 
guarantee success are few and are highly important persons. 
The Caribs and Indians of Guiana have a tradition, 
which folk-lorists may relate to Ygdrasil of the Norsemen, 
in that God created a wonderful tree that yielded all vege- 
tables good for men—the banana, maize, cassava, potatoes, 
yams, and all fruits besides. At the command of a voice 
in the skies, men set themselves to cut down this giant. It 
267
-P-A-G-E-286
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  took them ten months to destroy it, and it fell with a 
mighty crash. Then, at the command of the voice, the 
people took leaves and cuttings, planted them in mellow 
lands, and they sprang, not like the parent tree, but as 
bananas, yams, maize, mangos, and cocoanuts. And this 
mythical tree seems to relate to the silk cotton, in that the 
ceiba was the seat of the Mighty One. Its branches lifted 
to the clouds, and when he scattered twigs and bark these 
fragments changed to living creatures; so were men made, 
as well as birds, beasts, fish, and reptiles. But not so came 
the white race: it was only the withered and useless leaves, 
that fell upon the waters and drifted to distant places, that 
fermented into the tribe of spoilers and slayers, all to be 
drowned when the time came, in the great deluge that 
poured from the Haytien gourd. 
SNOWDROP 
When the first winter lay white upon the earth, Eve 
sorely missed the beautiful things of the fields. An angel 
who pitied her seized a flake of the driving snow and, 
_ breathing on it, bade it live, for her delight. It fell to 
the earth a flower, which Eve caught to her breast with 
gladness, for not only did it break the spell of winter, 
but it carried assurance of divine mercy. Hence the 
flower means consolation and promise. In another legend 
Kerma, finding her lover dead, plucked a snowdrop and 
placed it on his wounds. It did not rouse him, but at the 
touch his flesh changed to snowdrops, hence the flower is 
also an emblem of death. Even now in rural England the 
flower is in ill repute, and it is unlucky to carry the first 
spray of the season into the house, while it is downright 
indelicate for a person to give it to one of another sex, 
since it implies a wish to see the recipient dead. This 
galanthus nivalis is variously known in England, France, 
268
-P-A-G-E-287
  
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    Italy, and Switzerland as virgin flower, snow piercer, win- 
ter gallant, firstling, blackbird flower, little snow bell, little 
white bell, baby bell, spring whiteness, and white violet. 
SPEEDWELL 
The legend of St. Veronica, associated with the veronica, 
or speedwell, is mentioned in the early Christian legends. 
The plant has other attributes, however, than that of sug- 
gesting the picture of Christ on the handkerchief where- 
with the saint wiped the blood and sweat from His face 
as He went to His death. Its ‘‘true blue,’’ as well as the 
story of Veronica, has caused it to be chosen as the emblem 
of woman’s fidelity. Long ago it was valued for its 
medicinal qualities and for them it attained the distinc- 
tion implied in its German name of ehrenpreis, or, honor 
prize. It was a shepherd who discovered its worth as a 
curative, for he saw a deer, wounded by a wolf’s bite, rub 
itself against an oak, then lie in a speedwell patch. The 
stag remained in its nook for a week, eating of the speed- 
well from time to time, and when it came forth the wound 
was cured. Now, the king of that country had been smitten 
with a leprosy and was lying on his bed, so ill he doubted 
if he should ever again rise from it. To him the shepherd 
made his way with a dish filled with new-gathered flowers 
of the speedwell, and related what he had seen. The mon- 
arch applied them to his bleeding skin and also drank a 
decoction brew from the plant. As a result, he left his bed, 
sound in health and full of thanks for the blessings that 
the Lord had showered upon the earth. 
SPRINGWORT 
Springwort, or blasting root, to be found on St. John’s 
night among the ferns, is hard to lay hands upon, because 
it has the magical quality of seeming to dodge about. 
269
-P-A-G-E-288
ec eae 
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
Once it had the power to open locks, hidden doors, and 
entrances to forgotten caves, like the ‘‘sesame’’ of Ali 
Baba, and if a horse treads on it the springwort will surely 
pull his shoes off. This variety of euphorbia may be had 
in this manner: In the nesting season track a woodpecker 
to his hole, and plug it while he is foraging. As soon as 
he finds the place occluded, he will hurry away for spring- | 
wort, which, by its magic, will cause the plug to be ejected, 
so the watcher, who is standing below, may pick up the 
weed the bird has dropped. This belief is older than 
Pliny, who declares that an electric force in the plant draws 
out the obstruction. Later peoples have believed spring- 
wort to be a product of water and lightning, and that birds 
carrying it above either a fire or a vessel of water must let 
it fall. In Suabia it is burned on a mountain top, as a 
lightning averter. 
SPRUCE 
From strips of spruce, the Haida Indians, of British 
Columbia, make not only remarkable mats, but hats and 
baskets, so finely woven that when swollen with moisture 
they hold water like bags of skin or jars of pottery. They 
are rudely and quaintly decorated with figures that sym- 
bolize tribal myths and history. A legend relates that 
two girls, being treated cruelly by their stepmother, de- 
cided to leave their home. They were found by a man who 
took them to his lodge and married them.. After some 
years, they felt a longing to revisit the scenes of their child- 
hood, but this meant a journey of some difficulty and dis- 
tance. Their good totem spirit bade them weave two 
baskets apiece from spruce strips, small enough to fit over 
the end of the thumb. These they were to fill with dried 
meat and deer tallow. Now, these little baskets, holding 
less than a mouthful apiece, were as the baskets that con- 
270
-P-A-G-E-289
  
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
tained the loaves and fishes, for though the two girls ate 
all they wished, the supply never diminished. When they 
arrived at the parental lodge, the baskets suddenly swelled 
to the proportion they would have reached had they con- 
tained the food actually used on the trip, and the strength 
of many people was needed to carry them into the house. 
The old stepmother was still there, and, being easily per- 
suaded to eat of the contents of the baskets, gorged to that 
degree that she could no longer breathe, and so died, in a 
rapture of sufficiency, and her stepdaughters were avenged. 
STRAMONIUM 
The vexatious ‘‘jimson weed’’ is so called from its 
abundance in Jamestown, Virginia, when the English set- 
tlers, thinking its seed might have food properties, ate of 
it, cutting strange antics as a consequence. This plant, 
which in dignified botanies is datura stramonium, is valued 
by the Indians of the southwest for medicinal properties 
unlike those discovered by the faculty in cities of the 
whites, the Zufiis using it both as a narcotic and anodyne, 
applying it externally to cuts and bruises. The powdered 
root and flower is the common form of the medicine, and 
when the rain priests go out at night to beg the birds to 
sing for showers, they carry’a little of this powder in their 
mouths, believing that the birds will cease to fear them 
when they do so. When one asks the spirits of the dead 
to pray for the rains, he chews a piece of the root, but he 
must obtain this from the rain priests, or from the Little 
Fire Brotherhood, to whom it is sacred. A priest may 
also give it to one who has lost property by theft, to the 
end that the victim may see the image of the robber in'a 
vision and accuse him to his face next day. 
The Zufii legend of the plant is that it is the descend- 
a7 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
ant of two children, a boy and a girl, who displeased the 
gods by wandering about their place of council and telling 
their mother of the strange things they saw. Their curi- 
osity and gossip led the gods to change them into plants, 
on eating whereof the people continue to tell of what they 
see. 
STRAWBERRY 
Strawberries, of which Swift said that God could doubt- 
less have made a better berry, but doubtless He never did, 
were sacred to Friga, and when the new religion spread 
over the darkened north the Virgin inherited from her 
heathen predecessor the right to this fruit. Indeed, it was 
considered that the Virgin acquired such fondness for it 
as to demand all of it that grew, and if a mother presented 
herself at heaven’s gate with the stain of strawberries on 
her lips the Mother of the Merciful One would cast herdown 
to everlasting torment for trespass on her fields. One 
reason for this belief is that infants ascended to heaven 
disguised as strawberries; hence the people of the earth 
never knew when they were committing cannibalism by 
eating them, and the safer way was to avoid. As John the 
Baptist was contemporary with the Virgin, however, he 
lived fearlessly on this berry, and to denote admiration 
for the preacher, Don John, of Portugal, adopted it as his 
device, as did sundry of the English nobility, for strawberry 
leaves are shown in gold on various of their coronets. 
SUGAR 
Sugar, whose sap sparkles in snowy crystals on the 
tables of the world, is somewhat of a luxury in the regions 
of its growth. Solemn Orientals may be seen chewing it 
as they ride and walk, and the boy, who discloses various

  attributes of his species, whether you find him in Green- 
land or Jamaica, not infrequently contrives to possess him- 
self of a couple of feet of the cane, and sucks it 
as cleaner children mouth sticks of candy in lands of sup- 
posedly better fortune. The Hindu planter burns the 
cane that may be left after harvest, as a sacrifice to Nagbele, 
spirit of the plant, but one reason for his so doing is that 
it may bear no flowers at the end of the season, for to have 
flowers of sugar bloom on one’s land is not merely bad form, 
but bad luck, as it signifies that a funeral must presently 
occur in the planter’s family. 
SUNFLOWER 
Various plants have been known as sunflower, and 
the chrysanthemum, the dandelion, and the elecampane— 
a bouquet of which fair Helen carried when she was to 
elope with Paris—suggest the day god as truly as the 
honest, coarse, assertive sunflower of our farms. The sup- 
position that the helianthus annuus is called by a more 
familiar name because it turns its face to the sun is com- 
mon; but the clumsy blossom and the stiff neck on which it 
stands, are not readily moved. Being an American plant, 
it could not have been the sunfiower of which Ovid tells, 
hence we are to imagine that when Clytie, dying of grief 
at her desertion by the sun god, was turned into a flower, 
it was & more modest one. 
Being such an obvious symbol of the globe of light, our 
big sunflower was much esteemed in Peru by the sun wor- 
shippers. Their priestesses, in the sun temples, wore copies 
of these flowers in gold, to the great joy of the Spaniards, 
who immediately possessed themselves of these shocking 
evidences of unauthorized religion, and put the objectors 
to the sword.

TAMARISK 
Osiris and Isis came to the earth to persuade mankind 
to better living, and their services so endeared them to the 
people that the jealousy of dark and bitter Typhon was 
aroused, and he plotted to put his brother Osiris to death. 
Typhon invited a multitude to join him in sports, and dur- 
ing the merry-making he challenged such as might to lie 
in a chest made from precious wood, promising to bestow 
it as.a gift on him who should fit it most nearly. He had 
previously taken the measure of Osiris, so of course the 
sun god fitted it, but no sooner was he lying at his length 
than Typhon clapped down the lid, bound it fast, and 
flung the chest into the Nile. Isis lamented her husband’s 
absence, and searched for him everywhere. The casket 
had gone ashore at Byblos and become entangled in a 
tamarisk, which the warmth from the body of the god 
caused to grow with wondrous speed’and to such a height 
that it was the marvel of the nation. In its ascent it inclosed 
the coffin. The king of Phenicia, fearing that some sub- 
ject might use the tree for base purposes, cut it down for 
a column of his palace, and when Isis discovered the casket 
hidden in its core, she hurled a thunderbolt against the 
pillar to split it. She then concealed the body of her lord, 
but Typhon stole to the place at night and cut it into four- 
teen pieces, which he flung into the river. Isis recovered 
all these fragments but one, and this the goddess eked out 
with a piece of sycamore, that she might complete the 
image of her husband when she buried it in Philw, where a 
great temple was built to his memory.

and relieved the hunger of Israel in the wilderness came 
from the tamarisk, and a manna still made at Mount Sinai

    THISTLE 
In a Greek story, Earth made the thistle in a moment 
of grief, that she might express her love for Daphnis, 
shepherd and musician, poet and hunter, when he had 
passed beyond the knowing of it; but it was associated 
in the north with Thor, the thunderer, who protected it 
and those who wore it, and who called the spiny thing a 
lightning plant. From the inexhaustible mine of German 
folk-lore is extracted a tale of the humble weed: A merchant 
who was passing through a lonely country, and who must 
have neglected to wear his thistle on that day, was met 
by a peasant who, noting the tokens of prosperity in the 
stranger’s costume and belongings, was filled with envy and 
bitterness. Seeing the road empty, save of themselves, he 
fell upon the merchant and put him to death. The victim, 
dying, fixed his eyes on the murderer and solemnly de- 
elared, ‘‘The thistle will betray you.’’ Whatever this 
warning meant, the peasant showed contempt for it by 
gathering up the merchant’s gold and making off. Still, 
as every one knows, riches bring discontent, and the 
peasant lost his spirits, became suspicious, fearful ; he hesi- 
tated to spend the money he had stolen, yet he dreaded 
its loss at the hands of other thieves. His neighbors espe- 
cially noticed his dislike for thistles, for he would avoid 
them in walking through the fields. They asked the why 
of it, and he answered, ‘‘I dare not say, and the thistle 
ean not say.”’ ‘‘But what have thistles to do with you?”’ 
they insisted. And in the end, half-demented by remorse 
and dread, he confessed the crime and was hanged. On 
the scene of the murder, in Mecklenburg, a thistle grows 
where the merchant fell, and it is seen that its buds and 
branches resemble human heads, arms, and hands.

while the carline thistle perpetuates the name of Carolus 
Magnus, or Charlemagne, who, perturbed by an outbreak 
of plague during the prosecution of a war, and fearing that 
the loss of his soldiers by disease might force him to 
abandon his enterprise, prayed earnestly for help. An 
angel who descended from heaven in answer told him to 
shoot his crossbow and note where the arrow fell, for there 
he would find an herb to stay the epidemic. The bolt fell 
upon a thistle, which, boiled and administered to the in- 
valids, cured them speedily. It was this belief in its 
efficacy as a drug that gave to one species the name of 
blessed thistle, holy thistle, and our lady’s thistle. This 
plant was the badge of the Order of the Thistle, founded 
in honor of the Virgin in France in the fourteenth century. 
Another order of the same name is held to be the oldest 
company of nobility in the world, having been created 
by Archius, King of Scots, after his victory over Athelstan 
in the tenth century; but this assertion is denied by those 
British historians who claim the creation of the knights for 
James II. of England. The choice of the thistle as a 
Scottish national symbol dates back to the Danish wars. A 
marauding Danish army, thinking to surprise a camp at 
night, advanced barefooted on its foes, but a soldier, step- 
ping on a thistle, could not forbear from uttering a howl 
of pain. At this the Scottish camp bestirred itself and 
defeated the invaders, hence ‘‘the guardian thistle’’ became 
seal of the kingdom, with the fitting motto, Nemo me impune 
lacessit. 
For all this, the thistle is not cultivated assiduously ; 
indeed, legislatures have fulminated against it, and it is 
usually treated as an enemy to be rooted out of the soil 
wherever found; yet the ass thrives on it, and the question 
is put to doubters of its nutritive value, ‘‘Did you ever 
see a dead donkey?” Moreover, a man who was lost in the

Fe 
Yellowstone country, years ago, supported life for some 
weeks on thistle roots. An old writer commends it as a 
vegetable and pot plant—its thorns being removed—and 
declares that it ‘‘changes the blood’’ as the season changes. 
If it lives up to the further claim that it cures ague, jaun- 
dice, and, in wine, ‘‘expels superfluous melancholy out of 
the body and makes a man as merry as a cricket,’’ we may 
have our thistle patches in the future, as well as our beet 
and turnip gardens. 
TULIP 
In a folk-tale of Devon, the pixies, having no other 
eradles for their children, put them at night into the 
blown tulips, to be cradled by the winds. A woman who 
had gone into her garden with a lantern and found the 
tiny babes asleep in the flowers was so delighted that she 
planted more tulips at once, and soon there were cradles 
enough for all the fairy people round about, and she would 
steal out in the moonlight to watch the wee creatures folded 
away in the satin cups and swinging in the perfumed 
breeze. The fairies, watchful, but seeing that she wished 
them well, rewarded her goodness by causing the tulips to 
take on bright colors and smell sweet, like the rose. And 
they blessed the woman and her cottage so that she had 
luck and happiness so long as she lived. When the woman 
died, a worldling occupied her cottage: a hard, money- 
making man, one of whose first acts was to destroy the 
garden as of no use, and plant parsley where the flowers 
had bloomed. This roused the ire of the little people, and 
every night when it fell dark they would troop out of the 
wood and dance on the vegetables and tear and hack at their 
roots and throw dust into their blossoms, so that nothing 
thrived on that land for years, and the parsley leaves grew 
fringed and ragged as you see them now. But the grave 
277

  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC.   
  
where the woman was buried they kept green and fair. 
At the head nodded a cluster of beautiful tulips, gorgeous 
in color, sweet of smell, and these bloomed long after all 
other flowers had faded. In time other men without eyes 
for beauty came into the region, so the woods disappeared, 
the grave was beaten flat by passing feet, the flowers were 
rudely broken, and the fairies withdrew to the fastnesses 
of the hills. From that time the tulips lost size and splen- 
dor and fragrance though they keep enough of beauty to 
endear them to every gardener. 
Turkey has made the tulip the subject of an annual 
festival; and, indeed, the sight of a great tulip garden, 
glowing like stained glass, is worth going far to see. In the 
spring we wait impatiently that uprush of color from the 
earth which is denoted in the tulip, and when the snows 
are gone. and earth and sky soften with the first rains, 
we bethink us of the season-myth of Isis, hurrying to the 
help of Horus as he lay wounded on the battle-field. It 
was a bleak and wintry plain where the god had fallen, 
fertilizing its yet unbreathing life with his blood, but as 
she knelt beside him and vented her tears, each drop arose 
from the earth again, a flower; for, behold, the spring was 
come. 
The Persian swain gives a tulip—it is the Persian 
thuliban (turban) that named it—to his beloved to signify 
that his love flames like its color, and his heart is charred 
to a coal by its ferocity, just as the flower’s base shows 
black. Gerarde observes the plant more reverently, for 
he maintains that it is the ‘‘lily of the field’’ that toils nor 
spins, the others declare for the lilium Syriacum as the 
object of the apostrophe. 
That was a curious chapter in the history of popular 
rages which is disclosed in the ‘‘tulip mania’’ of Holland 
in the seventeenth century. Rare strains.were sold for 
278
-P-A-G-E-301
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
nearly as much, during that excitement, as we have since 
paid for new varieties of chrysanthemums—and in our 
twentieth century men have paid ten thousand dollars for 
a fresh form of the Japanese flower, and seventy-five thou- 
sand dollars for the privilege of owning the first of a 
handsome variety of carnation. Some indication of the 
extravagance of growers and speculators may be found in 
Dumas’s tale of ‘‘The Black Tulip,’’ which is not abso- 
lutely a work of fancy. Government finally stopped specu- 
lation in tulips after the bulb of the Viceroy had been sold 
for four thousand three hundred and three guilders. 
VALERIAN 
Valeriana jatamansi is the spikenard which ranks with 
saffron, myrrh, and frankincense as a perfume. The pre- 
cious ointments of the east contained this substance; it was 
poured upon the feet of Christ by the Magdalen; its 
smoke has long ascended before the altars of the Roman 
church bearing with it the prayers of the worshippers; 
hence its use is ancient, but sometimes secular, for Chaucer, 
who calls it the setewale,—‘‘as swete as is the rote of licoris 
or any setewale’’—was used to it as a seasoning for 
broths. The odor of valerian is inviting not only to men, 
but to some animals, for cats and rats enjoy rolling in it 
and chewing its roots and leaves. 
In a Hindu legend a man who is compelled by an 
emergency to leave his house, directly after his marriage, 
plants a spikenard in his garden and shows it to his bride, 
telling her that he will be safe so long as it is in health. 
Years pass before he can return, and, wishing to test the 
woman’s constancy, when he reaches his home he puts 
on the rags of a beggar and enters his garden. Yes; the 
nard is there, a flourishing tree, giving off fragrance and

yielding beauty to the eye; but more beautiful than all 
_is his wife as she kneels before it, trimming and watching 
its branches and occasionally pearling its leaves with a tear. 
He throws off his disguise and the wedded life begins in 
happy reality. 
VIOLET 
One would suppose that the violet would be welcome any- 
where, but a fear of it still lingers among English rustics, 
for whom it had its funerary uses, like rue and rosemary; 
but while those plants are thrown into the grave ‘‘for 
remembrance’’ the violet guarded the mourners against 
poisonous exhalations from the cemetery. 
Violet perfume is expressed for toilet uses, tons of its 
blooms are thrown about in the Italian carnivals, in winter 
it sells for fanciful prices, whole conservatories being de- 
voted to its cultivation near the cities, and it is turned 
into confections for rich demoiselles. The violet, like the 
rose, has been used as a food, not merely to color and gar- 
nish puddings, broths and other dishes, but as a salad, 
mixed—think of it!—with lettuce and onions! A dish 
known in England as vyolette consisted of the flowers, 
boiled, pressed, and brayed with additions of milk, rice 
flower, and honey. These employments, however, have 
never lessened the sentimental regard for the blossom, for 
to this day in parts of Germany it is a custom to decorate 
bride-beds and cradles with it, a practice extending back 
to the Celts and the Greeks. | In a myth of the latter people 
the violet sprang for Io, a priestess of Juno’s temple, with 
whom Jupiter was almost caught in one of his flirtations. 
Not having time to conceal her, he changed her into a 
white heifer; but grass not being good enough for so deli- 
eate a creature, the god created the violet as her special 
food. So the Greeks named it ion, and the nymphs of 
280
-P-A-G-E-303
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    
Ionia—which bore that name because it abounded in violets 
—consecrated the flowers to Jupiter. From Ionia to the 
mainland was but a step, hence the Athenians made the 
flower the symbol of their city. Even in that day its mort- 
uary service had begun, for when a Greek was buried 
his body was eoncealed with violets, and they were also 
placed about his grave, or tomb, so that the dread recep- 
tacle was carpeted with color and fragrance. A violet of 
gold was a prize in the Provencal singing tourneys, for the 
half superstitious fondness for the flower and its cere- 
monial use had passed easily into Christian lands. Though 
raised for Io, it in some way became sacred to Venus and 
its perfume was held to be not only soothing, but stimulat- 
ing to the ardor of affection. Cw e have only the poet Her- 
rick’s authority, however, for believing that it was Venus 
who made the violet blue. She had been disputing with her 
son Cupid as to which was more beautiful: herself or a bevy 
of girls, and Cupid, a disobedient scamp, with no fear of 
his mother before his eyes, declared for the girls. This sent 
Venus. into such a rage that she beat her rivals till they 
turned blue and dwindled into violets. 
The old gods having died, the violet passed to the Vir- 
gin, and in some countries it is usual to place it, in wreaths, 
upon her altar, though roses and lilies are commoner. 
Among the flowers on which the shadow of the cross fell on 
the day of the crucifixion was the violet, and, like others 
in that shadow, it drooped in sorrow, thereby tokening its 
consecration to Christian service. Its color is suggested in 
the purple of church mourning and the wearing of ame- 
thyst jewels by persons in orphanage or widowhood. Ma- 
hometans regard it almost with reverence, because it was 
a favorite of the Prophet. 
Napoleon was known as Corporal Violet because this 
was his favorite flower, and when sent to Elba he declared 
281
-P-A-G-E-304
MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  
that he would return when the violets bloomed. During 
the exile his adherents might recognize one another by the 
little blossom. And the emperor was true to his promise, 
so there was a wonderful display of violets when he re- 
entered the Tuileries. It was much worn during his reign, 
and came to be so well known as his emblem that on the 
restoration of the Bourbons it was treasonable to wear it 
in public or even to carry it in bouquets. Even the Re- 
public forbade its representation, as it forbade the exhibi- 
tion of the royal bees. When the Bonapartes returned to 
power the violet again became popular, and when Napoleon 
the Little led Eugenie to the altar the sturdy women of 
the markets offered a huge cluster of violets to her. Till 
then she had been all smiles, but when the purple mass 
appeared she turned pale, her figure lost its queenly dig- 
nity, and tears sprang to her eyes. The women whispered, 
“Tt is the funeral flower : the token of ill luck.’?’ And when 
Eugenie had become an exile in England and wore mourn- 
ing for her son, killed by savages in Africa, they said, 
“The flowers foretold it.’? And purple, being a funeral 
color, it was fitting that her husband, the emperor, should 
be carried to his tomb under a pall of woven violets, as he 
was. 
Of late the violet has been mentioned in reports of the 
medical faculty, claims having been made for its uses in the 
alleviation and even cure of cancer. Infusions and poultices 
of the leaves are alleged to be of benefit, these reviving a 
practice of the time of James I., for in his day the herbalist 
Culpepper wrote, ‘‘It is a fine and pleasing plant of Venus, 
of a mild nature and no way hurtful. It is used to cool 
any heat or distemperature of the body, either inwardly or 
outwardly, as in inflammation of the eyes, in imposthumes 
and hot swellings, to drink the decoction of the leaves and 
flowers made with water or wine, or to apply them as 
poultices to the affected parts.’’

Our eastern tribes of red men have a legend that a 
Hercules who had killed a giant heron that preyed on his 
people invaded the fastnesses of the witches in the moun- 
tains, brought away the medicine roots that cured the 
plague, and defeated a hostile tribe, saw in the camp of 
the heathen people a girl so fair that his rest was broken 
from that hour. He stole from his own lodge, night after 
night, to run through woods and over hills, to guide his 
canoe across ponds and rivers, that he might be near his 
loved one and breathe the same air with her. He recited 
her perfections to the stars and sang his love in terms of 
such music that the birds listened and their warbling was 
sweeter when they had heard. After he had waited for 
several moons to meet the girl, his patience was rewarded, 
for she wandered into the wood one day, and springing 
from his concealment, he seized and ran with her toward 
his own village. Her people, who followed all the night, 
and at dawn came up with the pair, were the more furious 
when they saw that the girl had already plighted troth to 
her captor, for she had wound the braids of her hair about 
his neck, in token that they were married. No time was 
given for explanations: the tribe fell upon both the abduc- 
tor and the maid and killed them on the spot, leaving the 
bodies on the earth as they marched gloomily back to their 
camp. When the sun shone warm in spring a shy new 
flower appeared amid the winter wreckage that the winds 
had showered over the dead lovers: it was the violet; and 
to the red man this signifies courage, love, and devotion, 
for the birds carried its seed to every land, as if they 
were carrying tokens of these qualities for the delight of 
men and maids. And on the little petals may be seen the 
strands of the Indian girl’s hair, which she had bound as a 
tender chain about her lover’s neck. And the red men 
know the plant as ‘‘heads entangled.’’

THE VINES 
Once a year, when the moon is bright, the spirit of 
Charlemagne arises, clothed in the shadows of his ancient 
state, and wanders beside the Rhine, enjoying the green of 
the vines and the fragrance of the grapes he planted there. 
Then he crosses the stream on a bridge of mist and light, 
and if, on reaching the centre, he is seen to lift his hand in 
blessing, a rare vintage will follow. For in his day, as 
in ours, the vine was one of the glories of the Fatherland, 
as it is of other countries that produce the cheering 
juice. It has become the symbol of refuge and shelter, and 
we still speak of the vine and fig-tree as typifying home. 
In Italy some relic of its ancient use as sanctuary appears 
to be denoted in the play of children, who make it ‘‘goal,”’ 
where they are safe from the touch of the boy who must 
tag his playmates. In days old and new it crowned the 
revel and bespoke the joys of the cup that cheers and also 
inebriates. For as the pawnbroker is known by the sign 
of the three gilt balls, adapted from the Lombard coat of 
arms, and as the barber perpetuates on his pole a represen- 
tation of the bandaged arm that betokened his former trade 
of blood letting, so the bush, till recent years denoting that 
drink was for sale beneath it—though we have the Shakes- 
perean assurance that good wine needs no bush—was but 
a fragment of the vine that yielded the grapes. 
When we speak of the vine we commonly mean that 
which produces grapes: the ‘‘life-giving tree’’ whose leaves 
crowned Bacchus, and whose spirit filled his sinful old skin. 
Saturn gave it to Crete, Osiris gave it to Egypt, while 
Geryon carried it to Spain. The spies that Israel sent into 
Palestine returned with a bunch of grapes so heavy that it 
took two of them to carry it. In Persia a woman who had 
intended to poison herself drank some juice of the grape

that had become fermented, and astonished herself and her 
family by her playfulness and mirth, also by her long 
sleep and headache. She had made a discovery, and before 
the frightfulness of her example was realized the fame of 
the spoiled grape juice had gone abroad. 
Vines of all kinds ask for human liking and forbear- 
ance. Their grace, their dependence on other objects for 
support, the beauty of their leafage and efflorescence, have 
caused them to appear often in literary figures, and the ivy 
and oak, as representing woman and man, are a common 
enough item in toasts and other preconcerted eloquence. 
Every vine, unless it might be poison ivy, and that is less 
harmful than is popularly supposed, may be said to express 
the gentler qualities. Hymen’s altar was decked with ivy, 
in token of the clinging love of woman; and if you wear 
a wreath of it, you are empowered to distinguish between 
good women and bad, for you will learn to know witches 
when you see them. You may also eat its berries as a 
medicine against plague.— The cultivation of the ivy may 
date as far back as the Arthurian reign; at least, when 
Isolde died, lamenting her Tristan, King Mark, in his 
anger, buried them apart; but an ivy that grew from 
Tristan’s breast soon met another that grew from Isolde’s 
grave, and the vines twined together, declaring the loves 
of the unfortunates. Seeing this, the king recognized: 
their love as natural, if not righteous, and buried them 
together in his church. 
What is known as ground ivy, or periwinkle, yellow 
bugle, gill-by-the-ground, haymaid’s cat’s foot, ale hoof, 
and tun hoof, was a substitute for hops in ale, but that was 
probably before the time of Henry VIII. who amended for 
his morals, as well as he could, by introducing into England 
turkeys, mackerel, beer, and hops, the latter in Russia 
typifying joy and plenty, and so serving as a crown for 
. 285  
-P-A-G-E-310
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
  
  brides. But the hop surely was never so powerful a medi- 
eine as the ivy, for all parts of the latter were once used 
by the faculty: stem, root, leaf, bark, and gum. If cooked 
in wine, its extract was sovereign against burns and sores, 
and Bacchus, the wise god, taught his worshippers to crown 
themselves with its leaves when they drank deep, and so 
prevent a frenzy. It was a common belief, when ivy was 
a crown for poets and conquerors, that it was a proper 
head-dress for topers likewise, for it preserved them against 
the self-sought effects of aleohol. Because of these worldly 
associations, the church long refused to allow the plant to 
be brought indoors, even as a holiday decoration for its 
altars, but it has become an outward decoration for more 
churches than houses, and at Christmas takes its place 
with other green things, signifying neither the ambition of 
the soldier, the afflatus of the poet, nor the drunkard’s base 
content, but enduring life. 
That toleration of the heathen vine had become estab- 
lished so early as the twelfth century, this legend of Flor- 
ence will signify: In that time there stood beside a con- 
vent in the city a tall tree clothed with ivy, such as covered 
also the walls of the retreat. The brethren preserved a 
tradition that if the ivy fell from the tree it would also 
perish from the walls, and if the walls were once uncovered 
the place itself was in danger. A fearful plague broke 
out in Florence. Appeals for help came from every hand. 
As the monastery was rich and populous, the citizens 
flocked to it in numbers, beseeching aid, but the abbot told 
them, sternly, that the affairs of monks were affairs of 
heaven, not of men; hence he begged them to be gone, for he 
could give no succor. Indeed, the rules of his order forbade 
the inmates to go forth into the world; they could not

relieve the sick, minister to the dying, nor bury the dead. 
A family entered the monastery grounds, nevertheless, a 
day or two later, and begged for refuge. The gate-keeper 
answered, ‘‘The brethren are at prayer and cannot be in- 
terrupted. But you may take the shelter of the trees.’’ 
Half ill, wholly disheartened, the fugitives plodded wearily 
into the garden and flung themselves upon the earth in the 
shade of the ivy, hoping that food and medicine might pres- 
ently be served. They found a certain rest in the silence, 
and coolness, the color of the flowers was sweet in their 
nostrils, the chanting of the monks was pleasant in their 
ears; but hour after hour went by, and still there came no 
help. The fever was beginning to work. Toward sun- 
down the eldest of the family, divining that there was to be 
no shelter for him or his loved ones that night, arose and 
solemnly cursed the monastery and its inmates, while his 
youngest child, in petulance, hacked at the ivy on the tree 
till it was severed from its root. When at last the monks 
had finished their services for the day and come into the 
garden for the air and to lighten their eyes with the sun- 
set, the people who had asked their shelter were at the last 
gasp: the swift plague had done its work. Next day the 
ivy was dead on the tree, and its leaves were falling over the 
earth, brown and withered. Gathering his monks about 
him, the abbot offered new prayers for the salvation of the 
monastery, realizing for the first time that one might be as 
selfish in his search for heaven as in the search for wealth 
and power and pleasure. He urged them to amend for 
their mistake, and to that end he set aside the rule of close 
confinement and bade them go abroad and give service 
where they might. They did so willingly, but it was too 
late. Already the plague was sweeping through the town, 
and now it appeared among the brethren themselves, As

    the ivy on the convent grew sere and dropped its leaves, so 
the souls of men who had lived for tranquil years behind 
this mask of green cast off their bodies and sought the 
light. No hand replanted the ivy: the doom foretold had 
come, and to-day the buildings are in ruin. 
WALLFLOWER 
Troubadours and knights often affected the wallflower, 
carrying it in their caps during their enterprises up and 
down the world, to express constancy to the feminine ideal. 
It doubtless came to type that virtue because of its clinging 
to the wall where it had been set; also because of its indom- 
itable flowering the whole summer long. The cheiranthus 
cheiri—Chaucerized as cherisaunce, and likewise known 
as heart’s ease, wall violet, winter gilliflower, blood-drops- 
of-Christ, and bloody warrior—had its legendary origin in 
a castle on the Tweed, whose lord had a fair young daugh- 
ter, who fell in love with the laird of a neighbor clan, 
desperately hated by her father. Their secret was discov- 
ered, with the result that the maid was confined to the 
castle. But the Romeo in the case loved his Juliet with 
a fervor that dared all things, so in the disguise of a 
minstrel he obtained entrance, and, sitting in apparent 
carelessness beneath the window where he knew she was 
listening, he strummed his lute and sang a tale which 
he knew would translate itself readily to her ear. When 
she heard a moor-cock call in the night, she was to slip 
from her room to the rampart. He would contrive to throw 
to her a rope which she was to fasten to a battlement and 
let herself down into his arms. The call was sounded, the 
maid erept out upon the platform, and caught the rope that 
was thrown to her, but she fastened it improperly and so 
fell to the cruel stones and died. The powers of white 
288

    magic that prevailed about the place took belated pity and 
changed her body to the wallflower, so a new form of 
beauty appeared where one more prized had been. 
WALNUT 
The Greeks, who knew it as the Persian tree and royal 
tree, dedicated the walnut to Diana, and her feasts were 
held beneath it; yet, like the Romans, they gave to it other 
than a chaste significance when they strewed its nuts at 
weddings, to denote fecundity. In later times, yokels 
have used the nuts in telling fortunes, for spirits, commonly 
of evil, lurk in its branches and exert an influence over its 
fruit, and over those who use it. There was a walnut in 
old Rome that was so filled o’ nights with mischievous imps 
that they became a public scandal, and some centuries 
ago it was found necessary to cut it down and build the 
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo on its site. It is a com- 
mon belief that its leaves and husks are so astringent as to 
be harmful to other vegetation, especially to grass and 
herbage on which they fall in autumn, wherefore the tree 
came to an ill renown, as poisonous. The use of the juices 
of its nut husks to stain the face, impart a gypsy com- 
plexion, or serve as other disguise, should give the lie to 
this assertion, but in England it is common to find hostility 
to the walnut among farmers, who declare that the black 
walnut will not only prevent the growth of plants and 
grass beneath it, but will blight all the apples round about. 
In some countries the peasantry will assemble about the 
tree and heartily cudgel it, though if you ask why they do 
this thing they tell you that it is to make it yield more 
plentifully. In Russia they have a dreadful saying: ‘‘A 
dog, and a wife and a walnut tree: the more you beat them, 
the better they be.’’ Possibly it is the nut of the whipped

    tree that used to be found effective in averting thunder- 
bolts, fevers, and spells, and it has a most precious prop- 
erty in that, if dropped under a chair in which a witch is 
seated, she will find it impossible to rise. The Lithuanian 
legend of the deluge will in part explain these virtues, for 
in that the deity was eating nuts while the waters over- 
whelmed the earth, and the righteous, climbing into the 
shells as they fell upon the surface of the sea, found in each 
an ark, and so escaped the death that was dealt to the 
wicked. 
The walnut is a melancholy tree, for in parts of the old 
world, as you walk beneath it of an evening, you may hear 
the servants of the devil whispering, snickering, and gib- 
bering in its branches. A famously bad tree of this type 
was the walnut of Benevento, for the unchristianized of its 
neighborhood worshipped it and performed unhallowed rites 
in the darkness which was made by the spread of its 
branches. They jogged on in their wickedness and content 
till the time came to let understanding into their heads, 
and this ungrateful task fell to the Emperor Constantius. 
There was a great deal of dissatisfaction when he camped 
before their walls and announced that he was to be a mis- 
sionary to them, nor did it appear to mend matters when 
one of their own people, a Saint Barbatus, upbraided them 
and assured them that the siege, with all the horrors that 
it promised, was the result of their own slowness in accept- 
ing the true religion. Still, if that was all that lay in the 
way of preventing farther hostilities, they would reform at 
once; so they were baptized, voted him bishop, and the first 
use he made of his new authority was in cutting down the 
walnut. As it fell, a serpent was seen to glide beneath 
its roots, and, having his suspicions of the reptile, the saint 
sprinkled holy water on it, whereupon the disguise fell off, 
and the Evil One was discovered. Having confessed him- 
290
-P-A-G-E-315
  MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF FLOWERS, ETC. 
    self, he vanished. So entirely was the curse removed from 
the walnut that when Saint Agatha crossed the Mediter- 
ranean from Catania to Gallipolis a nut shell sufficed for 
the journey, and she continues to make it in this little bark, 
every year. 
WATER-LILY 
In the German fable, the water nymphs hide from the 
eyes of men by taking the shape of water lilies, resuming 
the forms of women when the strangers have passed, while 
the evil nix, or water sprite, lurks beneath the round 
leaves of the plant and will do a mischief, if he can, to any 
who try to gather his ‘‘sea roses.’? The Teutons have long 
employed the lily in ornament and in their heraldry. 
Seven ‘‘swan flower’’ leaves decorated the Frisian arms, 
and King Herwic bore a banner of blue embroidered with 
the same device. This flower, rising through pure water 
and unfolding to the sun in petals of snow, has been fitly 
chosen to represent chastity, and the Wallachians, who 
know it as a scentless flower—it is the American nymphea 
only that is perfumed—make it the judge of all other 
blooms, for they hold that every flower has a soul. If 
those others have used their odors generously and well, 
they are admitted to St. Peter’s gate to bloom thence- 
forth in paradise’; if not, they wither and disappear. In 
the east the water flower is carried before the dead on the 
way to burial, as typing the virtues that made the de- 
ceased beloved; yet in the folk-lore of the plant it is averse 
to.love, being too pure, no doubt, and a couple of thousand 
years ago by carrying a water lily one could break the 
effect of a love potion secretly administered by some too 
enamored maid or swain. 
Although the man who renamed the Lake of the Clus- 
tered Stars escaped hanging, for all that he called it Tup-

per’s Lake, that sheet of water is as beautiful under one 
name as the other. Here, on its hilly shore, abode the 
Saranacs, of whom Wayotah (Blazing Sun) was the chief, 
and Oseetah (The Bird) the fairest maid. Oseetah loved 
the tall and sinewy leader; she delighted in his tales of 
war and his boasting; but her parents had promised her to 
a younger and less warlike man, and it was her parents, 
rather than her inclinations, that she felt bound to obey. 
Wayotah laid strong siege to her heart, but although she 
marked her flights with tears, she still avoided him until, 
on his return from a successful campaign against the 
Tahawi, he followed her across the lake in his canoe. She 
eluded him when he sought to embrace her; she was silent 
when he asked her to sing; then, when grown more eager, 
he advanced toward her with outheld arms, she ran up 
on a rock projecting over the water and, looking back at 
him with a glance that made confession of her love, yet 
raised her hand to warn him back. Wayotah was not to 
be warned. He was close beside her and smiled as he 
sought to grasp her hands; but before her intent had been 
divined, she plunged into the lake and the waters zlosed 
above her. The young chief leaped in to the rescue, yet, 
strangely, nothing could he see of her: she had disappeared 
as the rain-drop vanishes in the stream. After long wait- 
ing and long search, he returns to his village and tells his 
people of this happening, whereon there is long lamenting, 
and the girl’s parents are sore stricken. Next day a 
hunter comes running to the village with amazement in 
his eyes. ‘‘Flowers are growing in the water!’’ he cries; 
and the people hurry to see. Their fleet of canoes is 
speeded toward the Island of Elms, and there it is as the 
messenger has said: the lake is white and gold with bloom, 
and the air deliciously perfumed. ‘‘This was not so yester- 
day,’’ exclaim the men, ‘‘Tell us what this means,”’ de-

mand the women, of their prophet. He answers, ‘‘This 
bed of flowers is Oseetah, changed in death to these forms 
of life. Her heart was as pure as these petals; her love 
burned like the gold they inclose. Watch, and you will 
discover that the flower unfolds in the warmth of the sun, 
and when it sets its life will be darkened, and it will close 
and sleep on the surface of the lake.’’ Then Wayotah went 
into the forest and sat with head bowed toward the earth. 
WILLOW 
People who have been brought up under the kindly 
influences of old china will remember the plates and cups 
of willow pattern that decorated their sideboards; but it is 
likely that many of them have never heard the tradition 
attaching to the picture. The tale is this: Koong Shee, 
winsome daughter of a mandarin, loved Chang, her father’s 
secretary. When this attachment was discovered, the stern 
parent forbade the marriage and imprisoned the girl in 
the house shown at the left of the plate, with a lake before 
it. From the window she could see the water and the willow 
that overhung the bridge, and she wrote despairing poems 
telling how she longed to be free that she might see the 
peach tree bloom. Chang smuggled comfort to her in mes- 
sages inclosed in shells of cocoanuts that were sent for her 
refection, and she committed to the lake a shell with a tiny 
sail: a sail of ivory on which was written, ‘‘Do not wise 
farmers gather the fruits they fear may be stolen?’’ Chang, 
wandering by the shore, disconsolate, saw the shell dancing 
over the water, lifted it out, read the message, and took 
heart. The meaning was plain: if Chang wanted his bride 
he must take her. And he did. Disguised as a travelling 
priest, he gained admission to the pavilion where the fair one 
was kept, and, gathering her jewels and other consolations, 
293

——————————————T========= 
the two fled hastily, crossing the bridge where the willow 
rioted in defiance of all the natural laws. Before they had 
crossed the bridge the old mandarin was after them with a 
whip, and if you look closely you will see the escaping 
pair, Chang with the jewel box, Koong Shee with a distaff, 
and the parent with the lash, crossing the bridge in sedate 
procession. Being young, nimble, and eager, the lovers 
were presently out of reach, and, taking the boat, which is 
pictured as crossing the lake in the middle distance, found 
safety in the pagoda-like house on the farther shore, and 
there they lived in peace till the rich old eodger who had 
expected to become the husband of the girl discovered 
their retreat, and set fire to their home, burning them to 
death. The plate farther illustrates what happened, for 
you will observe that just above the willow are two doves 
in full flight. They are the spirits of the lovers continu- 
ing in another form the endearments that jealousy inter- 
rupted in their human shape. 
Willow figures in a Japanese tale or allegory as the 
humble companion of a tall and luxuriant bamboo. It was 
when the world was young and new plants were coming into 
it every little while, some of them to be pleasantly greeted 
by the early comers, others snubbed, somewhat as quiet 
mortals have been snubbed by those more aggressively con- 
scious of superiority. And so, when an unknown plant, a 
timid, pleading sort of thing, came out of the ground be- 
tween the bamboo and the willow, the bamboo tossed her 
plumes and turned away, muttering that there were too 
many upstarts. The willow, old, gnarly, but more kind, 
whispered through its leaves to the little plant, bidding it 
take courage, for the sun was shining and the rain falling 
for everything that grew. Still, the liking of the infant 
was for the bamboo: it stood so tall and proud and shapely. 
“Let me take hold of you till I can feel my strength,’’ it 
294

  pleaded. But the bamboo swung itself away, and bade the 
child plant keep its distance. Again the willow spoke: 
“‘Qrip your little green fingers into my bark. I shall not 
mind. You will find in my shadow strength and protec- 
tion. Lean against me and don’t be afraid.’’ Still look- 
ing toward the bamboo, the little plant crept over the grass 
to the willow, and the old tree seemed to lift it to itself. 
After a time it was not the willow that sheltered the vine 
so much as it was the vine that sheltered the willow, for it 
had grown to its top and was flaunting banners of green 
as if in gladness at the completion of the ascent. Tree 
and vine established a loving unity and were fair to look 
on. And having put out all its leaves, the vine began to 
bud. Once again the bamboo deigned to look at it. ‘‘And 
what,’’ it asked, ‘‘are those unsightly knobs that are grow- 
ing on that vine? Some disease, belike, that the creature 
has brought among us and may afflict the entire country.”’ 
The willow made no answer and whispered the vine to take 
no notice; so with a rustling sneer the bamboo tossed its 
head again and contemplated the distance. But when the 
next sun arose the buds burst and the old willow was 
decked from crown to foot with glorious color and bathed 
in perfume. And the owner of the land called his friends 
to see the wonder, for it was a gift of the gods. His men 
gazed in admiration. ‘‘We must clear a space about it,’’ 
said the lord, ‘‘to see its beauty the better. Keep the wil- 
low, but cut this bamboo.’’ ‘‘It is a fine and straight bam- 
boo,’’ his laborers objected. ‘‘Yes, and so is much of its 
kind, whereas no man has seen the like of this vine before.’’ 
And that was done which had been ordered. And the 
beauty of pride and the pride of beauty were as naught. 
It is claimed that the weeping willow took its name, not 
from the drooping habit of its branches, but from associa- 
tion with those of Israel, who hung their harps upon it 
295
-P-A-G-E-322

and gave themselves to tears because they were troubled. 
Long before that time, the sisters of Phaeton, wailing his 
death when he fell from the car of the sun, were changed 
into willows, and the long green streamers they put forth 
were as cascades of tears. The tree has been fond of damp- 
ness ever since. And on such a grove of willows the sor- 
eeress Circe hanged those of her suitors who least pleased 
her, the others being changed into beasts. The association 
of the willow with death and the uncanny is denoted also 
in the custom of planting it in cemeteries—a custom inaugu- 
rated by the Chinese, thousands of years ago. Sprays 
of willow are strewn on coffins in China, for, being of long 
life, it is a reminder of immortality; and it is often used 
as a decorative motive in Chinese art. In some countries 
its branch is a wand of divination and implement of pro- 
tection against evil spirits; at least, it preserved Orpheus 
from the fiends when he descended into hell. The willow 
bears a curse, inasmuch as it is one of the several trees on 
which Judas hanged himself, being planted by the devil in 
order to lure people to suicide by the peculiar restful swing- 
ing of its branches. It begets snakes, while its ashes drives 
them away. It is a meeting place and abiding place of 
witches, for if a witch embarks deliberately on her career 
of evil, her first step is to a willow, where, sitting on its 
root, she solemnly forswears God and all holy things; then, 
writing her name in her own blood on the book that the 
devil offers, she consigns herself to eternal torment. So, 
if you shall be tramping a desolate country alone between 
the middle of the night and the break of day, and shall 
hear a voice luring or laughing from a thicket of willows, 
beware, for it is Kundry, the witch of ‘‘Parsifal,’’? who is 
there. She is that Herodias who asked the head of John 
the Baptist, and who, as Christ went to his death, laughed 
at Him. Christ turned one reproving look upon her, then 
296

bade her go into the world and wander till his return, for- 
bidding her the solace of tears when she was weary of her 
fate—a form of the legend of the Wandering Jew. 
Apart from tales and superstitions that associate the 
willow with tragedies and mishaps, is the English faith 
that it had virtues on Palm Sunday when used as a substi- 
tute for the palm; for its branches on that day became 
valuable for healing and the aversion of spells. It had 
of old a purifying agency. The agnus castus, a variety 
of willow, yielded beds for maids in the festivals of Ceres, 
where they might sleep and retain their innocence, its repute 
coming down to later times when it became the piper mona- 
chorum, because its odor expelled impure thoughts. Hence 
monks made girdles of its withes, declaring that ‘‘it with- 
standeth all uncleanness or desire to the flesh.’’ 
In our country the weeping willow is an exotic, the 
first one coming to us through the agency of Alexandev 
Pope, the English poet, who stripped it, a tough green 
withe, from a box of fruit sent from Smyrna to his friend 
Lady Suffolk. ‘‘Perhaps,’’ said he, ‘‘this will produce 
something that we have not in England.’’ Pope set the 
twig into the earth on Thames bank, at his villa in Twick- 
enham, and a young British officer tweaked a small limb 
from it long after, intending to plant it in our soil. He 
came with the king’s troops to the Colonies, and, never 
doubting the success of the royal arms, had decided to 
settle in America on the conclusion of the war and end his 
years on the big estates he expected to receive from the 
beaten enemy. When the war ended he gave the twig, which 
he had preserved in a wrapping of oiled silk, to John Parke 
Custis, son of Mrs. Washington, who planted it on the 
Abingdon estate, in Virginia, where it rooted and flourished, 
and from that ancestor have come all the weeping willows 
in America. The willow at Twickenham was chopped down 
297

by the Briton who bought the property, because travellers 
eame in such shoals to worship under it and cut souvenirs 
and ask questions, that they interfered with his privacy. 
Another willow that has multiplied itself from cuttings, and 
grows by proxy in many lands, is that on St. Helena’s 
island, beneath which Napoleon often sat and thought on 
his fallen fortunes. On the night of his death it was 
uprooted by a storm. 
WORMWOOD 
Wormwood, absinthium, is the poisonous ingredient in 
absinthe that causes so many antics in Europe. If it be 
rubbed over a child’s hands before he is twelve weeks old, 
wormwood will keep moths out of his hair, and he will never 
suffer from heat or cold. Curiously, this herb was steeped 
in the wines of the ancients in order to counteract their 
alcohol, and it likewise defended one against hemlock, shrew 
mice, and sea dragons. The variety known as mugwort 
takes the name of artemisia from Artemis, wife of Mausolus, 
though some say it is Artemis, the Greek Diana, and it 
was therefore used in female disorders, as well as in the 
secret incantations wherewith one brought the spirits of the 
dead and the fiends of the netherworld to the surface. 
“Bat muggins in May’’ and escape consumption, poison, 
tire, bills, beasts, and other disorderly besetments. Made 
into a eross and put on the roof, mugwort will be blessed by 
Christ Himself, hence it must not be taken down for a 
year. 
A Russian, passing through a wood, fell into a pit of 
serpents who guarded a shining stone which served them 
as food if only they licked it, and she, too, was kept alive 
in this manner. In the spring the snakes bound themselves 
into a ladder by which she climbed out of their den and so

—— ooo 
into the world of light and green things. As she was about 
to leave them, the queen of the snakes granted to her 
the power of understanding the speech and uses of plants, 
on condition that she never named the mugwort; but when 
suddenly asked by a stranger what grew beside the path, 
she answered, ‘‘Tohornobil’’? (mugwort), and her mystic 
knowledge forsook her. So one Russian name for it is 
‘herb of forgetfulness.’’ 
YEW 
The yew attains great size and great age, one in the 
churchyard of Fortingal, Perthshire, being said to be 
two thousand five hundred years old. One in Hedsor, 
Buelas, is twenty-seven feet around, and three thousand 
two hundred and forty years of age, but the oldest living 
thing on earth is a yew in Chapultepec, Mexico, one hun- 
dred and nineteen feet around and six thousand two 
hundred and sixty years old. 
Yew furnished bows in the day when the archer was 
your only soldier, and the only hunter. This use of it for 
bows gave to the tree its botanical name, taxus baccata, or 
bow yew. With bows fashioned from its tough wood, Robin 
Hood and his robbing horde enforced their demands in 
Sherwood Forest. After swearing fealty. to Richard, life 
was dull for Robin, and he did not sorrow deeply when the 
king died, leaving him free to resume his career; but times 
had changed: poaching, theft, and violence were not in 
their old favor; the pestered community declined to accept 
them as jokes any longer. So they took to hunting the 
hunters. Then Maid Marian, wife or mistress of the ban- 
dit, died, and life lost its relish for him. Next came an 
order from the new king, urging that all highwaymen 
be hunted down, and offering rewards for Robin, who was 
hurt presently in a fight with the king’s men. He bade

    Little John help him to Kirkley Hall, where his sister, 
abbess of a convent, kept a room prepared for him, and 
where he was made as comfortable as possible. But his 
wounds were beyond surgery. With his horn at his lips, 
he sounded the three blasts by which he was used to summon 
his band, and Little John ran in, knowing that the end was 
near, for the sound was faint. As he entered the room, the 
dying man asked for his good yew bow and arrows. ‘‘Bury 
me where this arrow falls,’’ he entreated; then, fitting an 
arrow to the string, he shot. The missile fell at the foot 
of a yew which might have yielded such a bow as he held 
in his unconscious grasp. <A sigh, and Robin Hood was a 
memory. The mortal part of him they buried, as he had 
bidden, under the yew. 
That Robin’s yew was growing in a graveyard is signifi- 
cant of a practice that extended back to the Ptolemies in 
Egypt, and was implanted in Greece and Rome where yew 
fed the cinerary fires, was carried in procession at funerals, 
and placed in the grave before the body was lowered— 
this last a ceremony that survives in the Egyptian custom 
of throwing basil over tombs, in the masonic rite of casting 
acacia into a grave, and in a growing usage of lining graves 
with evergreen to soften the asperity of the cold, wet earth. 
There was a sanitary motive for planting yew in cemeteries, 
inasmuch as it was believed to drink up the poisonous ex- 
halations from ground infected by the dead—true, in a 
measure, of all plants. An English legend gives a ghastly 
significance to this churchyard tree, for it recites that a 
priest, having fixed the eyes of love on a girl of his congre- 
gation, became so enraged at her refusal to elope with him 
that he killed her and cut off her head. This relic being 
hung upon a yew limb imparted sanctity to the tree, for it 
symbolized martyrdom for righteousness’s sake, and the 
people collected pieces of the bark as charms, especially

    prizing those filaments that might be likened to hair. Hence 
the name of the town where the tragedy was enacted: Hali- 
fax, meaning, holy hair. In Vreton, Brittany, is another 
holy yew that sprang from St. Thomas’s staff, and was so 
revered that not only did the people refrain from touching 
it, but birds would not pick its berries. A band of pirates, 
seeing how stout it was, climbed into it to cut bows and 
spears, but while at this employ the branches broke and in 
their fall the skulls of the rogues were cracked beyond 
repair. 
YLANG-YLANG 
Like the locust and wistaria, the ylang-ylang of the 
Philippines bears its flowers in drooping, greenish-yellow 
clusters, which emit a delightful fragrance. For years 
the perfumers of Europe and America have used them in 
their preparations, and until the coal tar products of the 
synthetic chemist have driven flower juices out of the 
market, the ylang-ylang will continue to be prized, by all 
except the Tulisanes. And why not by them? Well, to 
begin at the beginning, they had incurred the displeasure 
of Naga, greatest of the many gods that were worshipped 
in Panay, and whose likenesses in the groves and temples 
were of a particular wood, held sacred to his use, a rare 
wood, hard and handsome. Every town and hamlet had 
its statue of Naga, and it received worship and offerings 
each day. Naga was not a handsome god; at least, he had 
several mouths, one above the other, a disfigurement, or 
circumstance, that has left its effect on the handles of the 
native bolos, which are sometimes carved with faces sug- 
gesting his. 
What it was that excited the ire of Naga against the 
Tulisanes has been forgotten in the night of history. But 
Naga determined to exterminate them, and, to that end, 
801

he blighted their crops so that they should die of hunger; 
and marked them for accident and pestilence. 
abide it no longer, but came trooping down from the moun- 
tains, and took a fearful revenge on Naga by smashing 
all his images and burning all the trees from which they 
had been carved. 
The other tribes gave battle, and eventually drove the 
Tulisanes back into the mountains, but the dreadful prob- 
lem of providing new statues of the god confronted the 
victors, for unless such figures were erected in the towns 
the people would forget him, and he would not receive his 
due of praise. It was resolved to release a captive bird 
and use as wood for the statues that of the tree on which 
he should alight. The bird perched on the ylang-ylang. 
Then, behold, a miracle: the tree, which had never borne 
fruit nor flower before, now burst into bloom, and each little 
bird-like flower filled the air with a fragrance such as till 
then had never been breathed. Naga had sanctified the 
tree; and from that time all the likenesses that were made 
of him were carved from its wood. Is it any wonder that 
the Tulisanes regarded this survival of their enemy in the 
clouds with discontent?

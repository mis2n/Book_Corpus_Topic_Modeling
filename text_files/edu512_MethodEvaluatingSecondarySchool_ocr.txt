CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
A study of secondary-school units involves an investiga- 
tion of the curricula in which the unit is employed. 
This study in the field of High School Curriculum has been 
attemptéd in the hope that there might be determined, in so 
far as facts could be gathered, a basis, or the possibility of 
some basis, of choosing and relating—and, therefore, of 
evaluating—the kind and amount of curriculum material 
in the secondary-school program. Several reasons have 
justified the attempt. Chief among these is the fact ‘that 
curriculum ideas have been changing rapidly for the last 
decade; and as these ideas have changed, special demands 
have been felt for some fundamental bases to which those 
who are forming curricula might go and secure guidance or 
suggestion. 
Primary sources have been sought in this study. The 
actual records of 19,999 high-school graduates have been 
taken and have been tabulated in such a way as to show defi- 
nitely the units in each department of study. No consider- 
ation has been given to letters or to questionaires or paper 
curricula, but in every instance the office of the schools from 
which the high-school student graduated is the source of 
the data of these 19,999 graduates. 
The data of certain city, town, and county high schools of 
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Arkan- 
sas, and Texas were worked through, each as a special 
group. After the analysis of the work of each group, an 
interpretation was attempted, and from these interpreta- 
tions certain conclusions have been presented. These con- 
clusions are not in any sense presented as absolute values, 
but more as bodies of truth, the purpose of which is to be 
suggestive and directive. 
This has not been solely a statistical study, although it 
has been based entirely on statistical records. These could 
probably serve as bases for extended statistical investiga- 
tions. It is hoped that there has been secured an array of 
facts such as will enable one at a glance to answer the ques- 
tion: What studies have survived through graduation, and 
how have they arranged themselves in the typical secondary 
schools of the Central South? “Survival” should mean those 
studies which have been taken through the four years by 
each individual pupil. From such survivals as summarized
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 A Method of Evaluating 
and interpreted there ensues an evaluation of the several 
subjects of the curriculum. 
In such a large area of investigation and with so many 
possibilities of inaccuracy, especially in large schools, it 
may be possible that some error has crept in, but every ef- 
fort has been made to present in accurate form each body 
of facts in the several tables. 
Many personal experiences have motivated the task, and 
it has been prosecuted with the conviction that there are 
values of the high-school unit which can be determined best 
through subject relationship and will be of permanent in- 
terest, as well as of fundamental importance, in the field of 
secondary education. 
No definite and defined results have been sought and no 
major premises have been held. No brief has been held 
for the purpose of sustaining any belief or theory regard- 
ing any part or phase of the study. The findings are im- 
partially presented as cold facts and allowed to make their 
own appeal. Certain tendencies have been sought out in 
different situations, and varying survivals of the curricula 
noted in different ratios under different conditions; yet 
throughout these tabulations of fact no questions have been 
asked and no hidden reasons have been desired. The one 
effort has been made to present the actual structure of the 
high-school curricula as shown in the work done by those 
who have graduated from the high schools of the South. 
No critiques or treatises or suggestions of any kind as made 
by the schools have been considered as explanation of the 
facts. Paper curricula have been discarded, and the rec- 
ords of the high-school graduates have been allowed to stand 
for themselves. These records as presented, it is confidently 
believed, will serve as a basis, vital and effective, in the 
evaluating of secondary-school units.

CHAPTER II 
THE PROBLEM STATED 
The work attempted here can be well set forth through 
some incidents coming within the knowledge of the writer. 
A graduate student of Vanderbilt University matriculated 
with a baccalaureate degree that was found deficient, and 
certain departments had to be brought up to a standard 
which was fixed by the university. Within this baccalau- 
reate material there was a group in Science, a group in 
English, and other groups in Greek, Latin, French, Math- 
ematics, and Science. The question arose as to what credits 
would be required for making up the deficiency. The stand- 
ard by which this question was solved remains a mystery. 
Would it have been possible to complete the baccalaureate 
standard with other subjects? If not, what values lay in 
the required combination? How much value could have 
been given to the different fields not laid down in the cata- 
logue? The adjustment was made, and a body of material 
which had not been built to measure up to academic stand- 
ards was so pieced and patched that it could maintain itself 
under regular scholastic standards. 
A second incident was that of a high-school principal, 
when the graduates of the school were faced with the re- 
quirement of college entrance. Before deciding what to 
give to the boys and girls of the high school, it was neces- 
sary to know what the colleges to which they were going 
were requiring for entrance. Investigation showed that 
some required one thing and some another. Since the body 
of material, therefore, varied in almost every instance, the 
question arose as to what group of subjects could be made 
fundamental in the courses of the high school, and then as 
to what other courses could be added. There came to be a 
body of material required of all, as well as certain things 
elective for all. 
A third instance developed with the High School Inspector 
in Tennessee. New curriculum conditions arose to meet 
statutory enactments. One of these laws was to the effect 
that counties might receive special money from the state 
only on condition that such aid be used for the Departments 
of Agriculture and Home Economics in the high schools. 
Partial details were worked out in the law, and the State 
Board of Education was faced with the problem of outlining 
a body of curriculum requirements to meet these legal de--
-P-A-G-E-12
    12 A Method of Evaluating 
mands which had been passed in the interest of better citi- 
zenship. Therefore, the old high-school course of study 
had to be remodeled. Some questions that arose were as 
follows: 
If Agriculture is taught, what are the other subjects that 
cling most closely to the type of experience represented in 
this science? Does Chemistry have a more vital place in an 
agricultural course than does Latin? If Home Economics 
is to be the center of a curriculum, what other subjects 
should be more closely allied to this department than to any 
other? There was forced upon tlhe committee the necessity 
of a dogmatic position by outlining strict regulations in 
courses of study and by fixing definite scholastic stipulations 
for the state subsidy. The committee worked through the 
social conditions of the state, and was forced to conclude 
that Roemer' is right in his conclusion that the high school 
in the South has not been focused to meet the needs of the 
people of the South. 3 
In an attempt to solve this problem of why some units 
should be in and others be out of the curriculum, it has been 
felt in this study that an appeal to practice would afford 
the only basis of working toward a reasonable answer. 
Some vital questions that should be answered are: 
What has actually been the high-school curriculum pur- 
sued by the high-school graduates of the South? Have the 
towns been following the same lines of activity as have the 
cities in curriculum administration: and unit evaluation? 
Has the influence of the small high schools in the country 
been projected along the same lines of practice in adminis- 
tering unit value? What principles of administration have 
served to show the value placed upon the units of subject- 
matter? ) 
Throughout the country, whether in the industrial North 
or in the “functional” West or in the more or less static 
South, the need of a workable standard is evident. To what 
shall we turn in order to know how much of this or what 
kind of that is to be actually included in the course of study? 
In order to discover what subjects have survived and in 
what manner, through the outlined curricula of the sec- 
ondary schools, with all the dynamic social agencies at work 
upon them, it is incumbent upon any scientific or dependable 
investigation to bring out the facts as they are. When the 
different facts of survival are counted and related one to the 
other, and then interpreted after all possible combinations 
have been made, can we not at least claim that there is a

ages
-P-A-G-E-13
Secondary-School Units 13 
basis here for a practice that will stand the closest scrutiny 
and invite the fullest consideration in determining curric- 
ula? Procedure has been taken, therefore, in this study on 
the basis that the desired subject has survived in every in- 
stance. There is an unconscious development in all units 
of growth through use, whether in one institution or in an- 
other, and it is assumed herein that this can be discovered 
for secondary education through the records of the grad- 
uates of the high school. If this is discovered with any 
degree of certainty, it can be used in some way as a real 
basis for the evaluation of subject units, and thus for their 
formation into the proper curricula. Whatever material is 
to be counted as having the most worth in the curricula of 
the high school must first submit itself to an investigation 
along the lines suggested above. 
There is a fundamental basis of value in the ‘relationships 
of unit material. The approach to the problem is, there- 
fore, focused upon the individual subjects, one by one, and it 
is sought to show how each subject is related to other sub- 
jects. 
The standards which have been formulated for the tests 
of a standard secondary school do not apply in a sufficiently 
vital way to the evaluation of unit material, because they 
have not focused definitely the value of a unit upon its rela- 
tion to other units. It is believed in this investigation that, 
in addition to the standards now operating, there is a vital 
value in unit relationship, which has been either disregarded 
or overlooked. It does not displace any other principle or 
standard in operation, but supplements and strengthens the 
body of standards already in use. What is meant by unit 
value? By worth-while material? By curriculum value? 
Are there coherent relationships obtaining within any cur- 
riculum? Upon what bases can such coherences be discov- 
ered and administered? These are the questions at the 
heart of this study. 
This fundamental basis of the determination of value for 
each unit of work done springs primarily from student in- 
terests. The objectives of life, whether for business or for 
college, are served at one and the same time. If his inter- 
ests center in Mathematics or in Science or in History, there 
are certain attendant interests which gather around these 
and serve as supplementary groups of values. There are 
definite items of study—and, therefore, units of work— 
within the school that connect logically and naturally to each 
separate interest. Thus the question is asked: What are 
the allied interests of the group of students who are partic- 
ularly desirous of taking a major portion of their work,
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 A Method of Evaluating 
say, in History or in Latin? The same question applies to 
every other department within the high school. The plan 
which attempts to answer this question should have basic 
consideration in value determination for curriculum mate- 
rial. Such a plan is sought here. 
It is proposed to show how subjects group themselves in 
the work of high-school graduates. If the student’s inter- 
ests center in Mathematics and a major is taken in it, then 
the evaluation of his Mathematics unit should be made in 
terms of the supplementary work which is taken with it to 
form a coherent schedule with that leading subject. Such 
a leading subject may be called a “core.” A core subject 
comes to be the nucleus of a group of material that forms 
itself through practice around this subject. This group of 
material will be called the “core curriculum,” and this prin- 
ciple of choosing curricula will be called the “core principle.” 
Each curriculum is called after its core subject, as the Latin 
core curriculum, or the Commerce core curriculum, etc. 
Whatever accompanies the core of Mathematics or of Eng- 
lish or of History, and so on through every schedule of the 
individual student, is the underlying basis of determining 
the unit value of the core subject. 
If students are allowed to choose their work by this plan, 
their individual course of study will come about in some 
such way as the following: If the pupil is interested in 
Home Economics and desires to major. in this field, then the 
Home Economics curriculum will be chosen. : The basis of 
this curriculum has been worked out through practice, and 
is immediately available for the pupil to see exactly what 
lines of effort have been mapped out by others who have . 
gone through the same course. Also, if a pupil should be 
interested in industrial curricula, there will be found al- 
ready outlined in practice the subjects which are most 
nearly related. Thus a simple direction will be provided for 
all those who are passing through high school and desire 
some standards by which to be guided. In the absence of 
counselors, any student can see.the lines of subject-matter 
as they have been made by others in their department. 
The city material employed in this study has been secured 
from the cities of Atlanta, Birmingham, Chattanooga, Dal- 
las, Knoxville, Little Rock, Louisville, Memphis, and Nash- 
ville. These cities represent the Central South; and while 
they vary in many ways, they have enough of homogeneous 
‘factors to justify their grouping. There have been taken 
from the high schools of these cities 7,353 cases of regular 
graduates. Their work has been considered for the full 
four years in which they were students of these high schools.
-P-A-G-E-15
  
Secondary-School Units US) 
Each case was considered separately, and the records were 
transcribed from the individual record cards on file in the 
office. This material of the cities has been supplemented 
by similar material from fourteen towns of Kentucky, Ten- 
nessee, and Louisiana. These represent 1,816 cases and ex- 
tend over a range of four years. In addition, 10,839 cases 
of graduates of county high schools from the states of Lou- 
isiana and Tennessee have been studied. The material con- 
cerning the graduates of the towns and of the county high 
schools. is used as amplifying and explaining that of the 
cities. Altogether, there have been studied 19,999 cases of 
high-school graduates taken from their record cards. 
The data have been subjected to a threefold analysis: 
1. Distribution tables have been made showing (1) the 
total number of units taken, (2) the number of units car- 
ried in each year of the school, and (3) the total number of 
units of each department in each school year. 
2. The formation of core curricula from the majors of 
each department has been made. Each core curriculum is 
formed by abstracting from each department the major 
units and their accompanying subjects in whatever quan- 
tity. If other subjects accompany the department majors 
in smaller quantities than majors, then they are represented 
as minors—less than minors, or sub-minors; and when no 
amount of any department is found to accompany the lead- 
-ing major, this has been tabulated as zeros, all of which 
when represented together, as the curriculum, is called the 
“core curriculum scheme.” 
3. A tabulation of the coherences and sequences has been 
made from each core curriculum. A distribution of the pu- 
pils in each core as they carry different amounts of any 
department shows how coherent each core is. 
The grand totals of the investigation are shown in each 
table following under appropriate headings, and give a gen- 
eral view of the scope of the results in each phase of facts 
gathered. ;

CHAPTER III 
THE DISCUSSION OF THE CREDIT UNIT 
It would seem too obvious to state that secondary curricula 
have not sprung full grown from some mysterious educa- 
tional source, but have developed through an evolutionary 
process from very small beginnings. This is true for each 
individual subject in the curriculum. There is always great 
uncertainty in the source and growth of subjects, but the 
one vital fact concerned with the growth of curricula is that 
there is an unfolding of value in all subject-matter. This is 
the secret. of progress. Illustrations of the above state- 
ments are self-evident to those who have made curriculum 
studies. The findings of Davis, Stout, Brown, and Cubber- 
ley are filled with proof of this gradual acceptance in the 
changing social life. The Latin School, of Boston, is an 
illustration. The old Franklin Academy might have re- 
mained if another Franklin Academy had not been formed 
to meet the new demands. The same thing is true in the 
South, especially in the State of Tennessee, where the old 
academy, or private school, retains much of its former vigor 
because of succeeding generations demanding the traditional 
and unified values. The secondary-school curriculum stands 
as a product of the past, but it is more than that. It is ever 
reaching forward to catch better things, and strives to 
embody as it advances every vital educational principle. 
How can new things enter the curriculum and still afford 
a unified group of vital values consistent with the demand 
of society, whatever that society may be? How each part of 
this new material can be related to the other parts—and, 
therefore, to the whole high-school program—is the one issue 
which faces the proper evaluation of the credit unit. The 
method which must be used to determine the changes that 
are to take place when new material replaces old material 
is, therefore, the problem to be solved. 
The proper perspective of unit values has been disre- 
garded oftentimes in the introduction of this or that unit of 
subject-matter. If there was a dim possibility of some ob- 
jective producing the desired result before school authori- 
ties, then a special appeal was likely put forward. For ex- 
ample, if the school need money and the only opportunity 
to receive this money be through some subsidy, say, for vo- 
cational work, then this vocational objective is presented as 
the most important reason for the acceptance of the subject.

    Secondary-School Units oi 
The political forces seize. upon such a method of approach 
and urge immediate action in the light of the educational 
need, whereas really the need was not so much educational as 
it was financial. So it is that unit values of subject-matter 
may often enter a school program. 
Thus might multiplied instances of curriculum thinking 
and acting be found in actual use as efforts are being made 
toward solving this problem of choice. But so far there 
has been no definite or suggestive standards set up by means 
of which it may be known with any weight of reasonable 
certainty why one unit of credit should be given and not 
another.. The paramount question is, therefore: Upon what 
theory or practice can one unit be recognized in a certain 
group of material and justified therein? 
Historically, the unit of curriculum material has been 
changed only as it has been forced to do so. As the early 
groups of high-school material expanded and social pressure 
increased for different subjects, something had to be done. 
Naturally the old subjects fought for their places. The first 
compromise was to rearrange and divide the several subjects 
already in use so as to meet the new demands of measure. 
The credit unit, therefore, came into educational practice 
because of certain fundamental demands. The fact that it 
is defined as a unit signifies that it has administrational 
value. A definite quantity of material had to be finished 
under new organizations by the teachers. The division of 
subjects into units of instruction for use naturally led to a 
certain part of this material being known as credit or unit 
material. Among these influential sources of division there 
are different standards which have been developed from 
different angles. Could a new basis be established which 
would involve less of the subjective and more of the objec- 
tive standards? Is it enough for a subject to be considered 
good and counted as a worthy unit, or should it stand the 
test of working itself out with all the other units for the 
good of the whole to meet the best aim and not merely a 
good aim? 
The high school has usually had two chief objectives in 
view: (1) entrance to college, (2) entrance into vocations. 
The colleges found it necessary to establish some means of 
measure for the material which would be accepted by them 
for entrance. These requirements were fixed by the fun- 
damental approach of dividing the material which had been 
given in the high school. They had the authority to fix their 
own entrance requirements, and this served to fix the pro- 
grams of the high school. These developed greatly through 
changing demands of the colleges. This is shown by the
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 A Method of Evaluating 
difference between the groups of subjects recognized by the 
colleges for entrance in 1890 and the larger group which is 
recognized to-day.” It is of greater interest possibly to 
note how many groups of subjects have forced themselves 
into the college curriculum from year to year. A progres- 
sive social order compelled a revision again and again of all 
this material. But now if a high school determines its func- 
tion to be other than college preparation, then the curricu- 
lum is made up of such units as the high-school standardiz- 
ing agencies think best: ‘Throughout the years the attitude 
of the college toward the high school has changed from direct 
demands, through a long period of adjustment, to the atti- 
tude of to-day, which is that of wholesome coéperation.”5a 
The first important effort to standardize high-school 
courses was that of the Committee.of Ten. This commit- 
tee was appointed by the National Education Association 
(1891), and was composed of nine subcommittees of ten 
members each. It was the duty of each subcommittee to 
deal with the individual subject to which they had been 
assigned. These subjects consisted of: Latin, Greek, Eng- 
lish, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy 
and Chemistry, Natural History including Biology, Botany, 
Zodlogy, Physiology, History, Civil Government and Polit- 
ical Economy, Geography, Physical Geography, Geology, 
and Meteorology. Inasmuch as they looked upon this ma- 
terial as preparatory to college, and as the attitude was a 
scientific one, we should not be disappointed with their work, 
for the high schools of the nation were projected largely 
toward college. Their first work was a division of material 
into four separate curricula: (1) Classical, (2) Latin-Scien- 
tific, (8) Modern Languages, (4) English. These curricula 
were recommended by the committee for trial under the gen- 
eral recommendations which were made by the conferences. 
Four subjects were made continuous—namely, Mathematics, 
History, Languages, and Science. One striking difference 
in the treatment of individual subjects was a large amount 
of time given to Foreign Languages. Two special princi- 
ples were evident: (1) A choice between the Classical and 
the Latin-Scientific course should come as late as possible 
in the program of the high-school student. The idea was 
that no choice should be made by him until excursions had 
been taken into the chief fields of knowledge. (2) The idea 
of elimination from the high school at the end of the second 
year was presented as a basis of dividing material. No 
recommendation was fixed which required elementary and

advanced units of work, but the suggestion was made and 
has been worked out along these lines in succeeding prac- 
tice. These principles affected very seriously the type of 
work which was planned for each year of the high school 
and fixed a tendency toward unit value, chiefly of time. 
“Trouble and all but chaos developed between the colleges 
and the high schools.’’* In the interest of more scientific ad- 
ministration, the Carnegie Foundation offered its help and 
rendered a most valuable and efficient service in the intro- 
duction of the Carnegie unit as a means of evaluating the 
high-school material. The statement of the secretary is 
the best description of the work done: 
“The border line between the secondary school and the 
college resembles nothing so much as a species of border 
warfare. The four-year high school was introduced as the 
only common basis upon which the colleges were likely to 
unite as a means for preparing for college, and it introduced 
a simple method of estimating the contents of a high-school 
curriculum. The principle upon which the measurement 
was based rested tpon the fact that during each of his four 
years in the high school a student could pursue steadily 
three or four studies at one time, and would accumulate, on 
the average, fourteen such study units during his four-years’ 
course. The chief advantage of using these units at the 
time lay in the fact that after their acceptance by the various 
colleges and schools they formed a common means of esti- 
mating the high-school curriculum. . . . There was pre- 
viously no common measure for comparing the work done 
in one school with the work done in another. . . . The 
employment of these units not only enabled a comparison 
to be made, but has constituted one of the influences making 
toward uniformity of the high-school curriculum.” He con- 
tinues to say: “These units have now served their main 
purpose. They were never intended to constitute a rigid 
form of college admission, but merely a means of compar- 
ing high schools. . . . The conception of college admis- 
sion no longer contemplates a certain number of units, but 
the completion of a satisfactory four-year high-school 
course.” 
How well this Carnegie unit has worked out is best told 
by the recent work’ of the secretary of the Carnegie Foun- 
dation: “The unit was defined as a course of study extending 
over a period of one year, representing about thirty-six 
weeks, with five recitations each week of forty-five minutes 
in length for each recitation.” “Such was the mechanical

  34 A Method of Evaluating 
perfectness of this outline that administrators became more 
or less. fixed with the idea that any kind of class work which 
met the condition of the time element would be called-a unit 
course of study.” “So flexible has been this definition,” 
says Dr. Furst, “that the unit causes students and schools 
to claim, and colleges to grant, excessive credit.” The fig- 
ures presented in his study show that “there is a distinctive 
expanding by the.colleges in the counting of units.” He 
says further: “It is scarcely to be expected that half of the 
matriculants in three institutions should offer for entrance 
more than four years of secondary work, or that a similar 
offering should be made by one-third or more of the stu- 
dents in half a dozen other institutions, or that in ten others 
a fourth or a fifth of the matriculants should have had such 
exceptional preparation. Sixteen and seven-tenths per cent 
of the 8,547 matriculants offered more units than can be 
secured in a four-year secondary curriculum.” 
“The definition of the unit,” states Dr. Furst further, “is 
exceedingly varied—so much so that there are scarcely two 
alike, and it would be possible to argue from approximately 
one-half of them that a unit represented something other . 
than a fourth of a high-school year.” “A unit of five fifty- 
five-minute recitations a week through a year of thirty-six 
weeks represents nearly twice as much work as four forty- 
minute recitations a week for a year of thirty-two weeks. 
It would probably be desirable for the association to bring 
about agreement concerning a definition of a unit that would 
be printed in the catalogues of almost if not all of its con- 
stituent institutions.” 
“The offering of four units in history by 1,787 students 
and of four units in mathematics by 1,185 students may be 
explained either by unusually extended courses in these sub- 
jects or perhaps by some such generous definition of a unit 
as probably underlies the offering of 4.5, 5.5, 6, and 6.5 units 
in a single subject by 103 students.” “The opposite end of 
the scale might be called the area of hospitality. The offer- 
ing of 6,500 half units, particularly in the sciences, is very 
questionable. The hundred miscellaneous subjects in which 
2,640 half units were offered include arithmetic, chorus, de- 
bating, glee club, penmanship, poultry, and war gardens, as 
well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Norwegian, and Russian. 
Frequently these half units represent a combination of two 
subjects, sometimes of three or four. A score of students 
also offered fragments of units as small as one-third,. one- 
fourth, one-fifth, or one-tenth of a unit. The number of 
single units also, 17,081, is large. By far the largest pro- 
portion of the offering, however, is evidently made up of
-P-A-G-E-35
  Secondary-School Units 35 
substantial courses of study of two or three or four years’ 
duration in the same subject.” 
“Tt is sufficient to say that after the general agreement of 
the value of a unit of high-school subject-matter, the col- 
leges and the schools, for the most part, went forward with 
uniformity of action upon a plan of certification for high- 
school graduates.’ It came to be the ambition of every 
school to be so affiliated with the colleges that they might 
have certification courtesies.” This is mentioned at this 
point for the sole purpose of emphasizing the fact that all 
unified action taking place between colleges arid high schools 
rested upon the common understanding of the value of the 
unit. After the schools had once fallen into the use of a 
certain list of subjects about which they knew there would 
never be any question from college authorities, they natu- 
rally look forward to a definite and easy transit for their 
high-school graduates to college. The path of least resist- 
ance is, after all, one factor which enters into the spirit of 
’ certification ‘practice. The practical working out of the full 
admission policies to college through a certificate was inter- 
fered with by the varying standards of the schools. Schools 
and colleges could not maintain the close contact which they 
had in the early days of certification. The former concen- 
tration of the high-school unit subjects came to be highly 
specialized. Every special course required special credit 
units, and there naturally arose a questioning attitude of 
what units should be accepted. A critical attitude grew up 
among the high-school students that resulted in their think- 
ing more about units and credits than they did about the 
actual work. The differentiated courses of study served to 
bring about a special advantage to those who had judgment 
enough to pursue courses in sequence. Thus the conven- 
tional and traditional preparatory courses were broken 
away by the spirit of high-school autonomy. 
Liberalizing tendencies have developed within the col- 
leges. The comprehensive examination introduces new fea- 
tures which represent the breaking up of the old forms of 
unit credit and a loosening of old high-school standards. 
The fact that candidates are required to come from accred- 
ited schools is the only thing which prevents this plan from 
being a type of perfect unit freedom, since examination is 
given on the work of the senior year only, and the student 
is allowed to be examined upon the content of English and 
any other three subjects selected from four groups: Latin, 
Mathematics, Modern Language, and Science. A’ require-

-P-A-G-E-36
  36 A Method of Evaluating 
ment is also made that a four-year course must be com- 
pleted; but this would not prevent freedom of standards 
within the high school, since a four-year course might be 
completed in less than four years. 
The entrance plan at Dartmouth College is a type of this 
free tendency. Any graduate of a four-year high school 
may be admitted if the record is shown to be from the upper 
quartile of the graduating class and three units of English 
completed with two and one-half units of Mathematics. 
Such plans contain the germ of a system which is strug- 
gling against a long list of external and more or less irrel- 
evant requirements, and foreshadows the time when a more 
simple and more fundamental plan of standardization for 
college entrance can be made to function within the sec- 
ondary school. There seems no reason why such a plan 
should not result in complete satisfaction for the school, and 
also for the colleges, preparing at the same time for life and 
for college entrance. It would appear that the comprehen- 
sive-plan idea has been of vital significance to. the basis of 
determining unit value. The significance of this is readily 
seen. Ifa high-school graduate can enter college by taking 
an examination in three subjects, then he will most likely be 
found measuring his high-school course in terms of these 
three subjects. If also this examination is to test his thor- 
oughness and his general ability in these fields, his whole 
attitude will be changed during the prosecution of his high- 
school work. Therefore, this new form of examination has 
introduced into the evaluation of the unit a new element 
which is most vital and one which should be conserved. 
Whether or not it requires an examination to conserve this 
value is another problem. 
The Committee on the Articulation of High School and 
College (report of 1911) recommended that admission to 
college be based solely upon the completion of a well-planned 
high-school course, and presented a fourfold argument for 
this thesis. The validity of these arguments has not been 
seriously questioned by any educational authority. If the 
well-planned high-school course referred to has ever become 
operative or its standards set, such has not been found. 
It is significant that such a basis, from the highest authori- 
ties of the problem, was projected at this time. The com- 
mittee was just closing its work, and this can well be re- 
garded as the one utterance of extreme importance. 
Simultaneously with the formulation of this report, the 
University of Chicago adopted a new plan of admission, the 
chief provisions of which were as follows: Fifteen units of 
high-school work shall be offered, including 3 units of
-P-A-G-E-37
   Secondary-School Units 37 
nglish, an academic major of 3 units, an academic minor 
of 2 units, 2 additional academic units, 5 units of any work 
accepted by an approved secondary school for its own grad- 
uation. This plan has continued in operation at the Univer- 
sity of Chicago, and is apparently satisfactory to that insti- 
tution. 
If the University of Chicago, with its leadership stand-. 
ards, saw fit to adopt such a policy, it could have had prob- 
ably no other basis than the one which is herewith pro- 
posed—namely, that a unit in one group of subjects is not 
the same unit as it is when forming a part of another group 
of subjects. It should be mentioned at this point, however, 
that the one outstanding basis upon which this Chicago en- 
trance curriculum can have any real value is the basis of 
unit relationship. 
There has developed intense dissatisfaction in the man- 
ner of blindly administering the mechanical unit. The Car- 
negie Foundation says: “As a counter, it was of great 
value.” (Fourth report.) Pearson says the unit was a 
failure.” But such a charge can be true only as it serves to 
become a basis of subterfuge and not a dynamic educational 
factor. We turn away from the formulation of the unit as 
any mechanical measure to an educational basis, which is 
more simple and which is believed to be more vital—namely, 
that of the influence which exists between any one unit of 
material and the other accompanying subject units which 
have significant relationship to it in the program of the stu- 
dent. ° 
Before considering facts to justify such an idea in a new 
basis of administration, let full consideration be given to the 
method now employed in the accrediting of secondary- 
school material. The voluntary associations of the colleges 
and secondary schools constitute the clearing house of val- 
ues in the field of accrediting. The organization of these 
associations was a direct necessity. When the question 
arose as to what unit of credit should be granted by the col- 
leges to the secondary schools and what should not be 
granted, the most natural evolution of the machinery to 
meet this need was a conference of the people involved. 
These conferences developed into associations, and it has 
been the purpose of all of these associations to develop ac- 
quaintance between the colleges and high schools for a basis 
of codperation for the purpose of solving the common prob- 
lems that have arisen or that might arise. The outcome of 
all the work has been the setting up of definite standards, 
the most fundamental of which has looked forward to the

Maryland, 1917.

38 A Method of Evaluating 
  answering of the question: ‘What unit is being offered by 
the high school and what credit can be given for this unit?” 
A body of accrediting standards is operative. 
These standards are all extremely vital, and must be pre- 
served at all cost, although the regional associations have 
probably become centers of exclusive standards. The value 
of a credit unit would seem to be within them strongly that 
of an inspection value. The various elements which are 
enforced within any school upon the accredited list may or 
may not have especially high value as the inspector deter- 
mines. The curricula of the school and the teaching force 
and the equipment, etc., must all be subjected to “thorough- 
going but sympathetic” inspection. This inspection value 
must rest upon the fundamental basis of the inspector to 
relate the various elements. No scale of relative work has 
been presented, nor can such well be made; and so the sum 
of the elements which make up the final rating of the school 
is arrived at ina general way. Of course, it is understood 
that good teachers and good teaching are recognized and 
that equipment is a fundamental matter, and the length of 
time and the size of classes and the other objective stand- 
ards are all basic; but these must be balanced by standard 
number 6—namely, that of inspection. 
These association standards are all necessary, and must 
be embodied in the definition of a unit, but they do not in- 
clude all that can be meant by a unit. The most vital ele- 
ments of unit definition are included in the basic principles 
of time given and the indispensable service of « syllabus; 
but these approaches lead forward to the principle of unit 
relationship, which is presented in this study as the most 
vital method of evaluating unit material. 
When the Carnegie Foundation’s secretary* made the 
statement that high-school units had served their main pur- 
pose, he substituted for them “the completion of a four-year 
‘high-school course.’”’ ' What stipulations were to be set for 
this satisfactory four-year high-school course had never 
been determined. Further, “the time is ripe for the intro- 
duction of a simple and adequate method of transition from 
the high school to the college,’ and also that “the scholarly 
significance of the high-school course must be preserved.” 
What is the method that will accomplish this end? 
Definition making has been the special theme of those who 
have discussed the standards of secondary-school units. 
Whenever any standards are questioned or are recommended 
for readjustment or renewal, the problem has always be- 
come a new one as to how the unit will be affected and con-

sequently be defined. It would seem to be maintained by 
those defining the unit that if the unit of high-school work 
could be properly defined, then all curriculum technique 
would be solved and likewise all college-entrance problems. 
This led Johnston,'° as chairman of the Unit Committee of 
the North Central Association, to lay plans which are still 
being realized. These plans were taken up and worked over 
by Koos,11 who contended that definition making had gone 
forward on the wrong basis and should be supplemented by 
new procedure. His idea was that there had been too much 
neglect of administrative considerations in connection with ‘ 
the definition of the unit, and he felt that, instead of the 
unit being represented by a syllabus or by a body of formu- 
las handed down by experts, investigation should be made 
of how the work of the unit in each subject of material has 
been going forward. Accordingly, he investigated the 
North Central Association, and formulated the “valid” aims, 
the “efficient methods,” and the “kinds of materials” with 
which each subject has served the needs of high-school pu- 
pils. He hoped by the proper presentation of the findings 
of his study to make a unit more than a mere list of topics 
bound together in some course. Such a vital study influ- 
enced greatly the field of secondary education and led to 
greater investigations within the association. 
The problem of standardization for the unit of work re- 
duces itself to one of course relationship. If all the ele- 
ments of the standardizing association. are employed, the 
unit does not of necessity become correctly related to the 
content of the high-school course. 
Beyond the elements of associational accrediting as now 
practiced lies a great field of significant values, which should 
determine the intelligent weighing of a secondary unit. The 
problem within this field centers around the contact of each 
subject as it is articulated or related to the other subjects 
of the curriculum system. 
But how are these curriculum systems to be wrought out, 
and upon what principles do they actually rest in their ad- 
ministration? Let us look into the facts of this investiga- 
tion.

CHAPTER IV 
PRESENTATION OF DATA 
The content of the work of the graduates, as shown in the 
tabular sections, must be kept in mind as having emerged 
from the offerings of the several schools under the local 
plan of curriculum administration. This fact can have lit- 
. tle direct bearing on the results of the study, but is stated 
out of fairness to the students and to the scientific attitude 
in which the results should be regarded. As the principles 
vary from one city to another, certain considerations can 
be given toward one result or another in proportion to the 
possibilities involved. At this point only rests the possi- 
bility of some reasonable interpretation of the tables by com- 
paring one city with another. Hence, the determining facts 
of administration in each city should be reviewed briefly. 
It has been found that the majority of cities have pre- 
scribed differentiated curricula, thereby necessitating the 
pupils to choose a curriculum when they enter the school. 
Atlanta, Birmingham, Knoxville, Louisville, and Memphis 
have used this method. A method of general prescription 
and election has been followed by Chattanooga, Dallas, 
Little Rock, and the Technological High School of Atlanta. 
Certain constants in each instance have been required with 
certain electives. Only one city, Nashville, has presented a 
system of free elections. In the administration of these 
curriculum principles certain things should be said to char- 
acterize the technique which has been applied. Without 
exception, where differentiated curricula have been offered 
there has been given a plan of changing from one curricu- 
lum to the other. Graduation from a certain curriculum 
has not always meant that the students entering that curric- 
ulum have continued through the four years. Specifica- 
tions of different natures have been made in different cities 
to compass this possibility of changing from one curriculum 
to the other. In practically every instance a change has 
been discouraged, but too much emphasis cannot be laid 
upon the fact that changes have been made because of the 
possibilities set forth within each year of each curriculum. 
There has been everywhere the principle of prescription and 
election for the subjects outlined. It is significant to note 
that first-year subjects in one school are not always first- 
year subjects in another school. Of extreme value is the 
fact that stipulated subjects for each year cause a very rigid
-P-A-G-E-41
Secondary-School Units Al 
prescription. If the school does not offer the subjects, the 
pupils cannot take them; and if the school does offer a sub- 
ject only in a certain year, then the pupil must take it at 
that time. 
The principle of major and minor election is emphasized 
in Nashville, Chattanooga, Little Rock, and Dallas. In ad- 
dition to these majors and minors, there is also a principle 
of requiring certain scattered units, such as is done in Chat- 
tanooga, where one unit of Science and one of History must 
be taken—if these happen not to be included in the majors 
and minors. Hume-Fogg High School, at Nashville, affords 
an example of the principle of free election. Inasmuch as 
the principle operates from an administrative standpoint 
under very definite restrictions, the principal and adviser 
might supersede the desire of the individual pupil. Theo- 
retically a pupil can graduate from this high school without 
any English or Mathematics or any of the major studies. 
It should be kept in mind that the technique for which this 
study is striving is the relation of value between the subjects 
which make up the curriculum. How has this been done, 
and what conclusions can be reached as to how it should best 
be done to establish the most vital relations for the units in- 
volved? 
A résumé of the requirements of each city studied will 
show the facts under which the students did their work.

Unless for very special reasons, every pupil in the Chat- 
tanooga High School must take four regular subjects. 
Sixteen credits are required for graduation. One of 
these credits may be given for Music, Physical Training, or 
Military Drill; but 15 of the 16 units must be regular school 
subjects. A credit means the completion of a subject, re- 
citing 4 or 5 periods per week throughout a school year. 
To meet the varied needs of our students, the greatest lati- 
tude in the choice of subjects, consistent with the require- 
Either the regular English course or course in Public Speaking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46

ments of a general education, is allowed. However, for 
graduation, three of these credits must be in English, three- 
in any other department, which may be called the pupil’s 
major subject, and at least two in one foreign language. If 
not included in the previous exactions, 1 unit of Algebra, 1 
of History, and'1 of Science will be required, and no credit 
will be given for the completion of only a half year of any 
subject which requires a whole year for completion. Eco- 
nomics, Civics, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry, General Sci- 
ence, Physiology, Commercial Arithmetic, and Penmanship 
are half-year subjects, the last course being open only to 
commercial students.

Requirements for Graduation, Choice of Subjects, 
Promotion, Ete. 
Hume-Fogg High School. 
1; Requirements for graduation are 16 Car- 
negie units. The term “Car- 
negie unit” represents a year’s 
study in a secondary or high 
school, with recitations of from 
forty to sixty minutes, four or 
five times a week, constituting ap- 
proximately a quarter of a full 
year’s work. 
2. In choosing work for graduation, “the 
student shall have absolute free- 
                           
is, departments—with no change 
of subjects selected until com- 
pleted, except for special reasons 
and the approval of the principal 
of the high school. Should any 
student in the high school show 
notable deficiency in the elemen- 
tary subjects which are supposed 
to have been mastered prior to 
the student’s entrance to high 
school; then the principal of the 
high school shall have the right to 
require such student to take up 
and successfully complete such 
subjects before graduation.” 
8. In the application of this rule the princi- 
cipal’ s general policy will be to re- 
quire an adherence to at least two 
subjects for three or four years 
and two or three subjects for two 
years each. One of the three or 
four-year subjects ought to be 
English. 
4. In the first year students will choose four 
subjects, or departments, in 
which they will pursue work lead- 
ing toward graduation. The de- 
partments from which studies 
may be chosen are the following: 
English, Foreign Language

general, take for graduation: 
English, 3 years; Foreign Lan- 
guages, 4 years in one, or two 
years each in two; Algebra, 
114 years; Geometry, 114 years; 
other work as required by the 
college chosen and in compliance 
with the high-school require- 
ments. 
6..Students who desire commercial work es- 
pecially and intend to graduate 
should distribute the work over 
the four years in school and take 
a broad and thorough course in 
other lines. Students unable to 
pursue a four-year school course 
and desiring a special course in 
commercial work may secure per- 
mission to take work more or 
less resembling the following: 
First year—English, Commercial 
Arithmetic, Penmanship, Type- 
writing, Stenography, or Book- 
keeping; second year—English, 
Typewriting, Stenography, Book- 
keeping, and one other subject. 
7. No credit is given toward graduation for 
less than a year’s work in a sub- 
ject, unless the subject is only a 
half-year study. 
8. Students must not enter or drop studies 
except in accordance with general 
rules or by special permission of 
the principal. : 
9. Students will carry four studies, unless 
permitted by the principal to do

otherwise. One additional subject 
giving half credit, such as Pen-

sion, but such students should not 
apply for a fifth regular subject.

IX. NASHVILLE. 
Hume-Fogg High School. 
No prescriptions; all studies elective. 
The constants which are evident in the cities which offer 
prescriptions and elections can be summarized as follows: 
English: Four cities, 3 units; three cities, 4 units. 
Mathematics: Two cities, 3 units; three cities, 2 units; 
two cities, 1 unit. | 
History: Four cities, 2 units; three cities, 1 unit. 
This is a strong argument for the tendency which has de- 
veloped in high-school curriculum-making. 
From the analysis made of the cities, every tendency is  
-P-A-G-E-55
Secondary-School Units 55 
shown toward that of free election. About the only stand- 
ards which remain are those which center around the selec- 
tion of work by majors and minors. Complete differentia- 
tion, therefore, has come about, and the outstanding guide 
to efficiency in the creation of a worth-while curriculum is 
that of coherence. 
SUMMARIES OF THE STATUS OF THREE SUBJECTS IN SCIENCE 
AND FIVE SUBJECTS IN HISTORY 
In the curricula of the nine cities which have been stud- 
ied it is of vital importance to note as examples within the 
curricula how the following subjects are treated: Are they 
required or elective? In what year are they required or 
elective, or both required and elective? 
SCIENCE. 
1. General Science showed that it was elective in the first 
year in eight instances; elective in the second 
year in one instance; required in the first 
year in four instances ; required in the second 
year in one instance. 
2. Biology showed that it was required in the first year in 
four instances; elective in the first year in 
two instances; elective in the second year in 
one instance; elective in the third year in 
one instance; elective in the fourth year in 
two instances; and required in the second 
year in three instances. 
3. Physiology showed that it was elective in the first 
year in two instances; elective in the second 
year in two instances; elective in the third 
year in one instance; elective in the fourth 
year in one instance; required in the first 
year in one instance. 
HISTORY. 
1. Ancient History showed that it was elective in the first 
year in nine instances; elective in the second 
year in three instances; required in the first 
year in two instances; required in the sec- 
ond year in two instances. 
2. Modern History showed that it was elective in the sec- 
ond year in one instance; elective in the third 
year in eight instances; required in the sec-
-P-A-G-E-56
56 A Method of Evaluating 
ond year in two instances; required in the 
third year in one instance. 
3. American History showed that it was elective in the 
third year in four instances; elective in the 
fourth year in three instances; required in 
the third year in one instance; required in 
the fourth year in eight instances. 
4. Civics showed that it was elective in the first year in 
six instances; elective in the third year in one 
instance; elective in the fourth year in six 
instances; required in the first year in-three 
instances ; required in the second year in one 
instance; required in the fourth year in six 
instances. 
5. The word History, without specification as to what 
kind of History, showed that it was elective 
in the first year in one instance; elective in 
the second year in ten instances; elective in 
the third year in four instances and elective 
in the fourth year in four instances; re- 
quired in the first. year in two instances; re- 
quired in the second year in one instance; 
required in the third year in one instance; 
required in the fourth year in two instances. 
From such a tabulation the following conclusions can be 
drawn: 
1. There exists no well-defined status in these subjects in 
the outlined curricula of these cities. 
2. Such a condition would indicate one of two things: 
(a) These are, for the most part, elective over a 
wide area. 
(b) These subjects are required under very defi- 
nite restrictions, and, therefore, are not 
shown in the regular outlines. 
In order to sée more clearly the relation of the tables one 
to the other, the data has been presented in Sections I, II, 
and III. Each of these sections is described in turn. 
SECTION I. 
This part of the data represents a quantitative unit study 
of each school and of each city involved. It presents an 
administrational background by showing the variety of the
-P-A-G-E-57
  Secondary-School Units 57 
subjects, their distribution by high-school ‘years, and their 
placement within each of the high-school years. Accord- 
ingly, there are three sets of tables presented. 
Tables I and II and Their Ranking 
These constitute companion tables and show the follow- 
ing things: 
1. The offerings of each city which show the relation of 
the curriculum in the several departments. The groupings 
of subject-matter has been found to fall into nine depart- 
ments. 
2. The total number of units in each department. This 
represents a scheme of importance and indicates to some 
extent whether the curriculum is well balanced or not. 
3. The rank of the number of units in each department, 
as English, Mathematics, History, Science, Latin, Modern 
Language, Commerce, Home Economics, and Industrial. 
4. The average number of units per pupil through com- 
bination of the tables. For the cities as a whole: English, 
3.5; Mathematics, 3; History, 2.4; Science, 2; Latin, 2.6; 
Modern Language, 2.2; Commerce, 1.7; Home Economics, 
1.7; Industrial, 1.2. 
5. The grouping of several departments by comparison 
so as to show the department importance. English, Math- 
ematics, and History are evidently of about the same im- 
portance. Latin and Modern Language are about the same. 
Home Economics would be one-fourth of Mathematics and 
one-third of History, and so on with each individual sub- 
ject comparison can be made. 
6. The rankings of each city and the importance of the 
units in the curriculum. Such comparisons show readily 
the basis of emphasis in the curriculum offerings. 
Tables III and IV 
Table III is a tabulation of the amount of subject units 
which have been taken in any school year within the de- 
partments. This analysis of the departments establishes 
relationships within the department just as subjects were 
related by departments in Table I. The significance of 
this table is determined by the amount of recognition which 
is given any special subject, whether or not it is continued 
from year to year or whether it belongs in the first year or 
second year or third year or fourth year of the high school. 
The value of this distribution is shown by the results, which 
represent the following year-ratios:

From this table the comparison of each study has been 
made in each subject for each year. For illustration, in 
Atlanta, Modern Language has a distribution of 55: 515: 
692: 439, while Knoxville has a distribution of 4: 4: 214: 
195, and Nashville 25: 256: 265: 227. A comparison of 
distribution in rank presents the following scheme: Mem- 
phis—1, 2, 38, 4; Chattanooga, 4, 3, 1, 2; Little Rock—4, 3, 
1, 2; Dallas—4, 3, 1, 2; Birmingham—3, 4, 1, 2; Knoxville— 
8, 4, 1, 2;. Louisville—4, 2, 1, 8; Atlanta—4, 2, 1, 3; Nash- 
ville—4, 3, 1, 2. 
: Tables V and VI 
A more detailed analysis of the subject-matter within the 
departments is shown by Tables V and VI, which represent 
the number of units of each subject in each department in 
each high-school year. A summary of this table is given, 
which affords a ready guide to the following questions: 
_ Do subjects find themselves given in more than one year in 
the high school; if so, to what extent? What is the general 
practice of each city and of the combined cities? The data 
as tabulated shows clearly where any subject is found and 
in what amount, thus affording a fundamental basis for the 
discussion of the value of the unit. For instance, if first- 
year Algebra extends through the four years as follows— 
93% : 5.5% : 5.5%: .5%—then there is a basis of the evalu- 
ation of this work which is different from the basis which 
would be: used if first-year Algebra is found only in the 
first year of the school. If first-year Spanish extends 
through the four years in the following ratio—24% : 28%: 
38% : 10% —upon what basis can be figured the proper value 
of a unit of first-year Spanish? The same basis holds good 
for every other subject in the program. 
By combining the three phases of unit administration 
presented in the analysis of the departments of study in 
Tables I and II and of the distribution of these subjects 
through the school years, as in Tables III and IV, and by 
the individual placement of this subject, as in Tables V and 
VI, a typical program of studies may be arrived at. The 
next step will be the analysis of these larger groups into 
smaller groups, which we shall call “core curricula,” be- 
cause they are formed around one subject of the program 
as a core.

SECTION II 
Analysis of Subjects Into Core Curricula 
Analysis of the subjects by departments into core curric- 
ula has been made on the basis that each department has its 
own relative basis of worth. Therefore, each subject has 
been tabulated wherever a major of this subject has been 
taken, and the record has been made so as to show the total 
number of units that have been placed with it so as to form 
an individual course of study. This has been done for each 
department, as Science, History, Mathematics, and the rest. 
The treatment of the Latin core curriculum will serve as an 
explanation. Out of a.total of 12,448 units of Latin stud- 
ied in the nine cities, 8,792 of these were taken in major 
groups. These major groups have been formed into Latin 
core curricula, with the result that subjects which are taken 
with Latin rank themselves as follows: English, Latin, 
Mathematics, History, Science, Modern Languages, Home 
Economics, Industrial, Commercial (see table for number 
of units). Thus the subject relationships establish them- 
selves into core curricula for each department as the sub- 
jects are analyzed one by one. 
Division Into Majors 
The departments and subjects have been formulated into 
core curricula and their total number of units ranked and 
further analyzed into the number of majors that each sub- 
ject core carries with it in its curriculum. 
The number of majors in each school of each city in- 
cluded in this study, with their rankings, have been added, 
so that individual comparisons can lead to desired conclu- 
sions. For illustration, the Girls’ High School of Atlanta 
and the Girls’ High School of Louisville may be compared ~ 
as follows: History, 81: 195; English, 81: 193; Modern 
Language, 9: 59; Latin, 13: 95; Science, 5: 11; Mathemat- 
ies, 28: 127; etc. 
City high schools of Knoxville and of Little Rock com- 
pare as follows: History, 236: 290; Modern Language, 1: 
14; Latin, 95: 57; Science, 131: 24; and so on. 
Division Into Minors 
Further analysis of the total units of the core curricula 
were made into the number of minors which accompany the 
major subjects. All subjects taken in minor relationships 
are included in each core. A tabulation of the minors in the 
Latin core is presented, with its ranking.
-P-A-G-E-60
60 A Method of Evaluating 
Division Into Sub-Minors 
Further analysis of the core units is made to show the 
number of sub-minors—that is, any subject with one-half, 
one, or one and one-half credits—that accompany the minors 
and the majors in this core curricula. 
Division Into Zeros 
A further analysis is made in each curriculum of the 
number of subjects which are not represented in the sub- 
jects of the core curriculum. This is significant as a basis 
of determining curricula, inasmuch as it is as important to 
know what subjects are not included and to what extent, as 
well as to know what subjects are included. 
Formulation of a Core Scheme 
From the tabulations of the total units in each core cur- 
riculum and the analysis into each core of the majors, mi- 
nors, sub-minors, and zeros, there has been presented a ta- 
ble which schedules subject by subject and city by city each 
of the core curricula, called the “core scheme.” This is a 
compendium of the findings through the analysis of the 
subject material item by item, and forms a ready reference 
in determining the constituents of any one core curriculum. 
SECTION III 
Sequences Within Each Core 
The coherence of the subjects within the curricula has 
been shown in the core scheme, but the solidarity of. the 
coherence can only be shown by the type of sequence in each 
city and school. The sequences have been made for each 
core curriculum for each city, and serve as a ready guide for 
the solidarity of all curricula. 
The method of using this material in the form presented 
has been that of comparison and of interpretation. The 
facts have been presented and stand alone, so far as their 
causal relationships are concerned, with the reasonable as- 
sumption that all conditions are fairly equal. Little hope 
can be entertained from the final report that the results 
could be at all normal, since the conditions under which the 
subjects were taken were largely prescription and restric- 
tion. Enough of tendency and fact are shown to justify 
the technique of reconstruction as justifiable. Too long has 
conservatism and academic imposition guided the student of 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  Secondary-School Units 61 
the secondary. school instead of his meaningful choice of 
coherent and purposeful subjects. 
There is value for a unit in the recognition given to all 
units. When a school gives emphasis to a unit, obviously 
more value is believed to be attached to it. The distribu- 
tion background tables, I to VI, enable a broad perspec- 
tive to be gained. Emphasis in each department and sub- 
ject and placement of years afford a ready guide toward the 
core-curricula analysis.

As a background of what constitutes a well-regulated cur- 
riculum for a high-school graduate, it is necessary to know 
what the actual number of units is in each department of 
study. There have been gathered the definite number of 
departments operative within the schools of each city, and 
also the total number of units taken within each department 
of study, given in Table I. 
It is obvious that the various studies have been grouped 
into nine large departments, and that the relationship of 
each department to the other is definitely presented city by 
city. Ina broad way it is necessary to answer the question 
as to what importance has been attached to the subjects of 
each department. In answering this problem, the entire 
administrational background of the untis of the school is 
presented in tabular form. 
Table II, as a companion table to Table I, serves to show 
the relationship of the number of students to the number of 
credit units, since it gives the number of students taking 
each subject. A definite ratio, therefore, is evident between 
each subject, and this likewise forms a background for any 
values of administration which may attach themselves to the 
various subject departments. It is relevant to know in the 
study of each city what subject is standing first and what 
subject second, and so on through all the departments. The 
totals of the units, in Table I, show that the subjects have 
ranked themselves as follows: English, Mathematics, His-
-P-A-G-E-63
  
Secondary-School Units : 63 
tory, Science, Latin, Modern Language, Commerce, Home 
Economics, and Industrial. 
The total number taking each study (Table II) for all the 
cities may be compared with the number of units, taken in 
Table I, in the following relationship: English, Mathemat- 
ics, History, Science, Modern Language, Latin, Commerce, 
Home Economics, and Industrial. Expressed in forms of 
alphabetical rank by departments, we have the following: 
Table I—English, Mathematics, History, Science, Latin, 
Modern Language, Commerce, Home Economics, Industrial ; 
Table II—English, Mathematics, History, Science, Modern 
Language, Latin, Commerce, Home Economics, Industrial. 
It is evident that English, Mathematics, History, and 
Science are occupying about the same position of relative 
importance. There is very little variation from the form 
for each city as compared to the form for the combination 
of cities. In a general conclusion it is noticed that about 
20 per cent reduction of the English is equal toMathematics, 
20 per cent reduction of Mathematics is equal to History, 
20 per cent reduction of History is equal to Science. Mod- 
ern Language is practically the same as Latin, Mathematics 
plus Industrial is equal to English, and so on through various 
combinations. 
In the relationship of the number of units of all the cities 
to the number of each city it should be noted that English 
is rank A in all the cities. Mathematics is rank B in seven 
of the cities, C in one, and E in one; History is rank C in 
four, rank B in two, and rank D in three; Science is rank D 
in four, rank E in three, rank C in one, rank Fin one. The 
problem arises from this relationship. as to why each city 
does not follow the same scheme, and, therefore, have the 
resulting rank of the same type. According to the table, 
why does Little Rock have A, H, E, D, B, G, F, C, I, while 
Nashville has A; G, F, D, E, C, H, B, H? It is because of 
this disparity in rank that further analysis must be made 
in order to secure a basis upon which the relationship of the 
various studies in each department can be judged as to their 
importance in the scale of subjects. 
The fact that schools may vary in purpose, and, there- 
fore, one subject may occupy a superior rank to another 
subject as the cities are compared, should be set aside, be- 
cause we assume in this study that the cities are all on the 
same footing. While Louisville, Birmingham, and Atlanta 
are the three cities which have more than one school repre- 
sented in this study, it is, nevertheless, true that a combi- 
nation of the schools in each of these cities amounts to the 
same thing as if there were only one school. If we should 
’
-P-A-G-E-64

  A Method of Evaluating 
place the Boys’ High School and the Girls’ High School and 
the Manual Training High School, all of Louisville, into one 
large school, we assume that the results of the study would 
be exactly the same as those obtained by having studied the 
schools separately.

Table III gives an additional view of the background of 
the subject-matter by dividing the-departments of study 
into year divisions. The subjects which are taken in the 
first year, in the second year, in the third year, and in the 
fourth year are given, and will serve to give a definite rela- 
tionship of value to each subject from the standpoint of the 
school. Whether or not a subject is receiving constant and 
proper recognition is best tested as to whether or not it has 
been continued through the school years. If 1,000 children 
begin English in the high school and 1,000 finish, this in- 
dorsement is sufficient to ‘justify the evaluation of English. 
And so it is with every other subject in the curriculum if it 
is offered under the same conditions. The fact that there 
are handicaps to the student cannot be considered in the final 
record of the subject; for if students do not have a chance 
to take certain materials, the popularity or unpopularity of 
those subjects cannot be charged to any other source than 
that of those who have made the curriculum. Reference 
must be made here to the necessary differential which is of 
necessity introduced in the treatise on constants and vari- 
ables by the several cities. In Table III the distribution 
of each subject by years is apparent. The placement of 
each subject is important, for whether a subject is advanced 
or elementary has everything tovdo with its fundamental 
relationship. Attention is called especially to such instances 
as the following: In the department of Modern Language, 
Atlanta offers a distribution through the four school years 
of 55—515—692—439, while Knoxville has 4—4—214— 
195, and Nashville 25—156—265—227, and so on through 
the other cities, with variations that leave us in a quan- 
dary as to what is the proper arrangement within the four 
years for Modern Language, if there is to be only one sys- 
tem of accrediting. Considering the four years of high
-P-A-G-E-67
  
Secondary-School Units 67 
school in rank alphabetic order, this is the result: Mem- 
phis—D, A, B, C; Chattanooga—D, C, A, B; Little Rock— 
D, C, A, B; Dallas—D, C, A, B; Birmingham—C, D, A, B; 
Knoxville—C, D, A, B; Louisville—D, B, A, C; Atlanta— 
D, B, A, C; Nashville—D, C, A, B; four cities, following the 
scheme of D, C, A, B, two cities C, D, A, B, two cities D, B, 
A, C, and one D, A, B, C. 
The department of Latin offers an interesting relation- 
ship within the four years, as follows: In the case of Mem- 
phis, 599—512—295—218 ; Louisville, 834—738—437—212 ; 
while Birmingham offers 739—690—402—382; and Nash- 
vile, 258—251—201—144. What has happened in each 
seems not to be evident unless the records of each subject be 
considered. This scheme is presented in the study of core 
relationships later. 
Some other special relations may be mentioned, however, 
to emphasize the need of the study just mentioned. If 
Memphis, in the department of Mathematics, offers 1017— 
594—376—219, upon what basis of adjustment could Bir- 
mingham present 1051—1032—764—515, or Knoxville 
498—499—434— 351? Compare, on the other hand, first 
and fourth years of Mathematics with Nashville, 181—202; 
Louisville, 1507—404; and Little Rock, 5183—207. 
What can be the explanation of Science if Chattanooga 
in the first and fourth years offers 35—96 ; Louisville, 752— 
737; and Dallas, 36—223? In all the departments, after 
those of English, Mathematics, History, and Science, there 
seems to be even greater discrepancies and disparities in 
the ratios of placement of the department material by school 
years. 
Table IV sets forth the number of pupils taking the sub- 
jects which are shown in Table III, and serves as a basis of 
checking the amount of work taken by each pupil in each 
year of the school. Here is found the distribution of the 
year loads for each subject and each school. From the 
standpoint of balanced curriculum and the placement of the 
units this is a most significant table. A glance will show 
how variant are conditions under which the different units 
are evaluated. Note the ratios as mentioned just above in 
several instances, which might be multiplied indefinitely.

‘Distribution of subjects in this department is impossible, since the units are not 
sufficiently standardized to label them as belonging to any special year. 
In the records of these sub- the yearly amounts are given, the same as in Table III. Hence, only 
jects difficulty was found at times in establishing thoroughly what units constituted 
the Commercial and Industrial departments.
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 A Method of Evaluating 
A more detailed analysis of the subject-matter of each 
department is developed in Tables V and VI. It is shown 
exactly where each subject of each department is taken and 
the amount of each, thus setting forth the significance of 
the placement of each individual unit of study. From these 
formulated data may be found the answer to the question: 
Where can any special. subject be found, and in what 
amount? Some of the questions which are answered may 
be illustrated as follows: Does first-year Algebra occur in 
any other place than in the first year of high school? Does 
Plane Geometry come in any other year than the third year? 
When Arithmetic is taught, is it of equal importance in the 
first and second and third and fourth years? Where do we 
find the greatest amount of Biology or Physiology? And so 
on through each subject. 
This table is the background for the evaluation of the unit 
in a very vital way, especially for elementary and advanced 
units. Note the summary for the distribution of the de- 
partments through the four school years.

88 A Method of Evaluating 
Table VI is a companion table for Table V, and shows 
the number of pupils taking the subjects as they are ad- 
ministered through the four. years of the high school. It 
answers the questions: If any subject, as first-year Algebra, 
is taken in the fourth year or in any other year, to what 
extent is this a practice? How many pupils actually took 
any subject in any special year? Thus the facts of prac- 
tice are discovered as to what year individual subject-matter 
is placed in. Comparisons and inferences may be made 
indefinitely. Questions about the value of the unit in any 
department should be referred to the companion Tables V 
and VI. From the summary a basis of comparison is had 
with the practice of each city. The composite shows a 
background of practice in each subject year by year, but 
of itself establishes no forms. If a distribution of any sub- 
ject seems irregular as compared with that of another sub- 
ject, it may be due to the meager offerings of the school, 
due directly to money shortage for faculty uses. And so to 
many other possible causes. Explanations cannot be made 
of conditions that exist, but these conditions are to be used 
in weighing the value of the subjects found. If 5 per cent 
of the students take Chemistry in the second year, can this 
unit have the same value as the 50 per cent taking Chem- 
istry the third year or the 45 per cent in the fourth year? 
If 24 per cent of the students taking Botany do so in the 
first year, can this have equal value as that given 12 per 
cent of the Botany students who do it in the fourth year? 
Should unit value be the same for first-year Language, no 
matter in what year it may be taken? Of the 5,152 units 
in Latin, are the 423 first-year units taken in the second, 
third. and fourth years of the same value as the 4,729 taken 
in the first year? Is Plane Geometry a first or second-year 
unit of equal value as when taken as an advanced unit? 
Is an equal amount of Civics in the first year and the fourth 
year to equalize the value of the unit? Will an Algebra 
unit in Birmingham, where all are given in the first year, 
be worth more or less than in Nashville, where 60 per cent 
of the students take it the first year, 26 per cent the second 
year, 9 per cent the third year, and 5 per cent the fourth 
year? These problems and others are referred to further 
analysis in the work of the core curricula, in which the chief 
value of any unit will be based upon its relationship to a 
core subject of a coherent curriculum.

Secondary-School Units 91 
There is value to units in the emphasis of distribution of 
the departments, in the amount of work given each year, 
and in the kind of each subject with its amount in each 
school year. The comprehensive tables give this back- 
ground of actual practice, showing how the high-school 
graduates arrayed their work. If it were possible to make 
corrections for restrictions that were unsatisfactory or un- 
desirable to the students, we would have an ideal back- 
ground form by which to organize a type curriculum and a 
firm basis of unit evaluation. 
The next section of data divides the material into related 
parts. 
SECTION II 
Data 
In Section I of the data the analysis of the administra- 
tive background of the study has been presented in Tables 
I to VI; in Section II further analysis is made of the de- 
partments; and from them the core curricula are formed 
in Tables VII to XII. 
As Tables I to VI formed a basis of perspective for the 
whole study, so Table VII forms a basis of finding the core 
curricula. When a department, as in Table I, has an ag- 
gregate number of units, these may be divided into the 
units taken in majors—i. e., three or more units each—and 
of the units that are less than majors. Of the total units 
in any department, a definite number will fall into majors, 
which number of units represents the foundation of the 
core. When any subject of each department has been taken 
in a major or more, this subject is lifted out of the depart- 
ment units, along with all the units that go with these ma- 
jors, to constitute the curriculum of the student. Each core 
subject has its accompanying subjects analyzed by the 
scheme of majors, minors, sub-minors, and zeros. 
There is a distinctive attraction within all these subjects 
that must be examined. When Latin has taken the lead, 
what has followed? Or when Science has taken the lead, 
what has been the concomitants? Therefore, the relation- 
ships of these subjects within the core groupings must be 
determined. 
First, the background for core relationship must be the 
total number of units within the core. Analysis is made, 
therefore, for each core of the total number of units. Let 
the Latin core illustrate. Out of a total of 12,448 units 
examined in the different cities, 8,792 of these have fallen 
into. the Latin core; and so in a similar manner with each 
subject which becomes a core subject.
-P-A-G-E-92
92 A Method of Evaluating 
Each core subject is taken from the total units which the 
graduates completed in their high-school course, and the 
units that fall together about this core subject are pre- 
sented as the basis of method and of content for curriculum 
making. 
Further analysis is made of the core curriculum into its 
relationships. 
The first part of the analysis is the answer to the ques- . 
tion: How many units of each department accompany each 
core subject? (Table VII.) The second part answers the 
question: How many majors fall in this distribution of units 
of the core? (Table VIII.) The third part answers the 
question: How many minors accompany the majors from 
these total units? (Table IX.) The fourth part answers 
the question: How many sub-minors go with the majors and 
minors to make up the curriculum? (Table X.) The fifth 
part answers the question: How many subjects are not rep- 
resented in the curriculum, and, therefore, do not have any 
relation to the core? (Table XI.) 
The number of the units in each core has been called 
“core totals ;” the number of majors in each core group has 
been called ‘‘core majors;” the number of minors in each 
core group has been called “core minors;” the number of 
units in each core group below minors has been called “core 
sub-minors;” the number of subjects not represented has 
been called “core zeros.” 
When all these groupings of core totals, majors, minors, 
sub-minors, and zeros are thrown together, they form a 
core scheme, which is the detailed description of what hap- 
pens in building a core curriculum. 
In order to secure the placement of each number of units 
in each analysis, it is necessary to get a simple scale of 
guidance for the several departments in each core rela- 
tion. History will rank higher in one core than in another, | 
or Science will be low in one core curriculum grouping, but 
high in another. There has been made a scale in each core 
by the letter rank. Ranking has been made of each subject 
in each core, and this accompanies the number of units 
tables. In the reading of the zeros it is necessary to keep in 
mind the fact that the highest number represents the least 
work in that department. If “zeros” rank the highest, that 
means always that the subject is least important in that 
relationship and that the highest or largest number of peo- 
ple have taken nothing in this core. The core scheme gives 
the full basis for curriculum practice, and constitutes all 
the details necessary to know what has taken place through 
the practice set forth in this study. How many majors of 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
Secondary-School Units 93 
History should accompany the other subjects in a Latin 
core curriculum, or how many majors and minors? The 
core scheme serves as a complete practical commentary on 
this and similar questions. 
Emphasis should be placed upon the significance of the 
study as made for four years, and, therefore, the basis of 
comparison for the individual years for each city. Rank- 
_ ings have been made for each year for each city and each 
school, and thus the record of each can be placed alongside 
the composite. These yearly records are not included in 
this volume, but are bound in a volume in the library of the 
George Peabody College for Teachers, where they are avail- 
able for reference. The same is true for the rankings.

Table VII is presented in Sections VIIa, VIIb, etc., one 
table for each core curriculum. 
In Table VII each department subject is presented with 
the total number of units of the other subjects in the order 
of a descending scale. 
The problem presented by this table is that of how much 
subject-matter. and in what order it forms itself, can be 
found gathered about any one subject as a nucleus. When 
Commerce is a leading subject of the student, what sub- 
jects are taken with it, and are, therefore, considered as the 
significant and essential studies to complete a Commercial 
course? Or when Latin is the basic study, what subjects 
are added in order that a curriculum is completed around 
Science as a center? What are the subjects that make up 
the program of the student? And so on with each of the 
eight departments. English is excepted, because of the fact 
that it is practically required of all students.

Table VIII, as Table VII, has eight divisions—one for 
each core curriculum; and so with Tables IX, X, and XI; 
but in this section of data only one division is given from 
each table as a type. This abbreviation is justified, since 
all the-data omitted in Tables VIII, IX, X, and XI are given 
in the core scheme—(Table XII). The Latin division of 
these tables has been chosen as a type—(Tables VIIIe, [Xe, 
Xe., and XIe). All other divisions are retained in a bound 
copy of original material in the Peabody College library for 
reference. . 
The core subject is analyzed into the number of majors 
and the concomitant subjects of that core. This serves as 
a significant background in that it shows clearly where the 
emphasis is being placed and the number of major selections. 
The type of question answered in this table is, e. g.: If 
there are 64 majors in the Home Economics core of Mem- 
phis, how many majors of other subjects will accompany 
that? Why is it that Memphis, with 64 majors in the Home 
Economics core, has only 7 majors of Science; while Nash- 
ville, with 61 majors in the Home Economics core, has 19 
majors of Science? Or if Birmingham, with 76 majors in 
the Home Economics core, can have 63 majors in Math- 
ematics as a part of this core, why should Louisville, with 
69 majors in the Home Economics core, have only 17 majors
-P-A-G-E-99
  Secondary-School Units 99° 
in Mathematics? Thus the relationships are presented 
throughout each core. 
Some of the vital problems which arise from Table VIII 
may be presented in individual cases. First of all, we may 
compare one city with another. The Girls’ High School of 
Atlanta and the Girls’ High School of Louisville give to us 
the following condition: History, in the ratio of 81 to 195: 
English, 81 to 193; Modern Language, 9 to 59; Latin, 13 to 
95; Science, 5 to 11; Mathematics, 28 to 187; Home Eco- 
nomics, 3 to 2; Industrial, 4 to 0. The Boys’ High School 
of Louisville and the Boys’ High School of Atlanta:  His- 
tory, in the ratio of 69 to 81; English, 69 to 80; Modern 
Language, 11 to 22; Latin, 10 to 18; Science, 2 to 44; Math- 
ematics, 31 to 81. The Central High School of Birmingham 
and the Central High School of Memphis: History, in the 
ratio of 444 to 84; English, 444 to 84; Modern Language, 
29 to 19; Latin, 241 to 11; Science, 211 to 6; Mathematics, 
171 to 17; Home Economics, 12 to 2. The City High School 
of Knoxville and Little Rock: History, in the ratio of 236 
to 290; Modern Language, 1 to 14; Latin, 95 to 57; Science, 
131 to 24; Mathematics, 198 to 155; Home Economics, 15 
to 24. The City High School of Nashville and Memphis: 
History, in the ratio of 304 to 84; English, 303 to 84; Mod- 
ern Language, 15 to 19; Latin, 48 to 11; Science, 40 to 6; 
Mathematics, 43 to 17; Commerce, 28 to 0. These illus- 
trate the relationship in the History core only. Among 
those, therefore, who major in History this ratio is vital; 
but no conclusion can be reached until the ratios of each 
core have been established, subject by subject, and, there- 
fore, majors by majors, minors by minors, etc. 
_ The most vital comparison between the schools is that of 
ranking each subject according to the tables. 
The majors of each core subject have been duly ranked 
in the order of their importance as judged by the number 
of units in the core relationships. A reference basis, there- 
fore, of a Commercial curriculum can be found in such a 
table of rankings. There is a general correlation which is 
evident throughout the scheme for every school. 
The only variations from this general scheme of any sig- 
nificance is found in the special schools, as they are sepa- 
rated from the high schools. It is not expected that the 
Boys’ High School of Louisville would show a basis of cur- 
riculum arrangement for the Dupont Manual. Training 
School of the same city, since these schools were separated 
on the very basis of the argument offered herewith. 
In the ranking of the majors for the city as a whole it 
shows almost perfect uniformity, Mathematics taking rank
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 A Method of Evaluating 
C in every core, with Science taking rank E as an average 
in every core, and History taking rank D as an average in 
all cores. Therefore, it is evident that English, Mathemat- 
ics, History, and Science constitute in every instance the 
four fundamental subjects. 
But a more significant comparison may be found in the 
rankings of the schools within the cities that from every 
standpoint seem to be homogeneous. Consider the Math- 
ematics core as it appears in Knoxville, Memphis, and Lit- 
tle Rock in rank alphabetic order: A, B, C, H, E, D, I, F, G; 
A, B, D, C, F, H, G, BE, 1; A, B, F, D, EB, T, C,/G, A. 
The apparent correlation of the rankings of the majors 
one by one with the rankings of the group units as a whole 
is strongly positive. Evidence of this is furnished by the 
following parallel schemes: Core totals for Mathematics 
(cities) —A, F. D, E, B, G, H, C, I; core majors for Math- 
ematics (grand totals) —B, F, D, E, A, H, G, C, E. 
With a continued parallel comparison with the core totals 
of the cities and the core majors of the cities compared with 
the core totals of the towns and the core majors of the towns, 
and with the core majors of the towns and the core majors 
of the county high schools, there is a likeness in the scheme 
that serves as a fundamental basis for the curriculum in its 
several relationships for the subjects one toward another.

102 A Method of Evaluating 
While the minors must be regarded as supplementary to 
the majors, it is obvious that a special emphasis is devel- 
oped here in the setting forth of the definite number of 
oe which are compared subject by subject and city by 
city. 
It is significant to note that in the Mathematics core Mem- 
phis offers 121 minors in Modern Language and 12 minors 
in Commerce and 99 minors in History and 8 minors in 
Home Economics, while Atlanta, with practically the same 
number of units examined, offers 113 minors in Modern 
Language and 124 minors in Commerce and 365 minors in 
History and 220 minors in Home Economics; or even more 
emphatic is the record of Birmingham, with about the same 
number of units studied, which offers in the Mathematics 
core 430 minors in Modern Language and 49 minors in 
Commerce and 193 minors in History and 36 minors in 
Home Economics. 
Table X shows the number of sub-minors in each city 
from each department that accompany Latin as a core sub- 
ject in the same manner as Table VIII and Table IX dealt 
with majors and minors. While the majors and minors of 
the curricula are the most important, it is still necessary to 
know how they are supplemented within the core. Hence, 
the final analysis of sub-minors and zeros in Tables X and 
XI. The core curriculum is not complete for any core sub- 
ject until every subject. is represented, until even the small- 
est unit has a definite value and must be given its place, 
though it be 1-5 or 1-10 of a unit. In the schools of the 
. cities there was a tendency everywhere to multiply small 
unit values. Various tendencies of industry and extra- 
curricular material seem to lie at the base of this. In talk- 
ing with the principal and teachers, I arrived at this con- 
clusion. For several reasons I was unable to tabulate all 
the work of the small units as well as it should have been 
done. 
In larger measure the subjects were known to be of sup- 
plementary value; and, therefore, the record was not as 
clear as it might have been. Whatever values the small 
unit may have intrinsically or otherwise, emphasis is here 
placed upon the function of finishing the curriculum around 
the core subject. Even this smallest unit of work can con- 
tribute to coherency and value of all the other units. 
Table X is one of the eight division tables of the sub-minor 
core curriculum, and serves as a type, as did Tables VIII 
and IX. 
Table XIe shows the number of cores in each city from 
each department that accompany Latin as a core subject.
-P-A-G-E-103
  Secondary-School Units 103 
Its chief purpose as a part of Table XI is to emphasize the 
absence of unit material in any subject of the core curricu- 
lum. It serves to call attention. in the scheme as to how 
many cases did not have a school in making up a certain cur- 
riculum. It also serves as a balance in checking the amount 
of material in the number of cases contributing or not con- 
tributing to the curriculum, and serves to evaluate in reverse 
order the factors of the curriculum. 
The problem of what happens when nothing is taken in 
any. one subject which may have appeared as a core subject 
in some cities and yet has been reduced in other cities to 
zero makes a valuable contribution to the tabulation of any 
individual subject. In the cities of practically the same size, 
_ so far as unit study may go, we find in the History core of 
Birmingham 698 cases not taking Commerce, while in At- 
lanta only 258 and in Memphis 147. In Knoxville 236 cases 
take no Industrial subjects in the History core and in Little 
Rock 234, and in Nashville 217 take no Industrial subjects 
in the History core. 
In the Mathematics core of Memphis we find 295 taking 
no Commerce, while in Birmingham 396 take no Com- 
merce and in Atlanta 581. In the same Mathematics core 
Nashville offers 139 who take no Commerce and Little Rock 
215 and Knoxville 352. 
The various subjects change position as they enter ‘dif- 
ferent cores, not only in the zeros, but for each of the other 
classifications of sub-minors, minors, and majors. Each 
subject may be compared through each core for each city.

Table XII shows the composition of the core curricula of 
each city by the combination of majors, minors, sub-minors, 
and zeros, with the number of units and cases involved in 
each department. From the tabulation of these curricula 
tables it is easily observed that the work of the high-school 
graduates has fallen into definite lines of work. Thus there 
is a ready analysis of the amount which has fallen into each 
department and the types of these amounts, whether majors, 
minors, or sub-minors. Quantitative relationship and place- 
ment can be deduced for any subject in any curriculum. 
From such a table a norm of practice can be established as 
a guide for those who would make curriculum building a 
thing derived from social demands and to serve social needs.

  120 : A Method of Evaluating 
The combining of the total number of units with the total 
number of majors in each core and the total number of 
minors, sub-minors, and zeros in each core tabulated has 
been called the “core scheme”—that is, the scheme of rela- 
tionship which has been formed by various distributions in 
each subject in each core in each city. It is readily discerned 
how each subject has been distributed within each city. 
For example, most of the units of Mathematics in the Com- 
merce core are in majors, while in Little Rock by far the 
largest number in Mathematics is in minors, but in Louis- 
ville by far the largest number in Mathematics in this same 
core is in sub-minors. 
In the Commerce core the Science department takes a dif- 
ferent angle from that of Mathematics, for in all the cities 
except Nashville the mode is found in sub-minors. In this 
same core (Commerce) Modern Language in all the cities is 
preéminent in the minors. Likewise there is a basis of 
comparison throughout each core for the scheme as a whole. 
This offers a compact and ready means of comparison for 
each city in each department in all core curricula, and en- 
ables a basis of evaluation to be developed through the place 
any unit may occupy in the core scheme. A typical curric- 
ulum in the Latin core would be as follows:

Likewise from each typical city core curriculum are the 
endless relationships that serve as fundamental in planning 
the respective curricula desired. For illustration, from this 
Latin core, in order to secure 8,792 core units of Latin, 
12,448 raw units had to be sifted. From these 8,792 core 
units 2,328 core majors were formed, and the relationships 
within the curriculum follow several general principles.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Secondary-School Units 121 
The order of department importance is: Latin, English, 
Mathematics, History, Science, Modern Language, Home 
Economiés, Industrial, and Commerce. In the majors ac- 
companying the core major, Mathematics nearly doubles 
History, the next in importance. Modern Language and 
Science are about the same amount in both units and ma- 
jors. Science has about 60 per cent of the Mathematics 
units, but offers less than 25 per cent as many majors with 
Latin and gives 23 per cent of its units in sub-minors. 
Nearly 35 per cent of the students do not take Modern Lan- 
guage, only; 6.5 per cent take no History, 2.5 per cent take 
no Mathematics, 15 per cent take no Science, 75 per cent 
take no Home Economics, 89 per cent take no Commerce, 
and 91.7 per cent take no Industrial units. Hence, manifold 
relations may be developed within the core curricula. In 
each case there are principles that are directive and sug- 
gestive to the curriculum builder. In each curriculum the 
unit finds a contributing value in every point of contact, and 
is made of great worth or valueless only as it touches cohe- 
rent and worthy material that functions toward a definite 
aim. In each of the core curricula the apparent aim of the 
graduates was to secure a meaningful program, and no 
aaa proof could be found than the factual result as it 
stands. 
SEcTION IIT 
Description of Data 
The third section of the data is that of the number of se- 
quences found in each city without regard to any other prin- 
ciple, and is a simple tabulation of the number of majors 
and minors from each core curriculum, grouped together so 
as to form a basis of comparison. Those curricula which 
have only one major taken by high-school pupils are placed 
in Group 1. If there is one major and two minors, then 
this study is placed under the heading 1-2; if one major and 
three minors are taken, then it is placed under the heading 
1-3; and so on through all the groupings. 4-3 represents 
four majors and three minors; 5-3 represents five majors 
and three minors. A combination of these groupings for 
the separate cores shows very readily whether or not any 
school has placed much or little importance upon the se- 
quence of subjects and how the student has arranged his 
work in any curriculum. If many majors and minors form 
the mode of any curriculum, as 4-3, this is a strong ten- 
dency toward better and higher values than if the mode 
came in 2-2. Thus curriculum coherence can. be tested.

This summary shows the number of pupils in each core 
who have taken within that core curriculum sequences indi- 
cated. 1s means that they took from one to two majors; 
2s means that they took from two to three majors; 3s means 
that they took from three to four majors; 4s means that 
they took from four to five majors; 5s means that they took 
from five to six majors; 6s means that they took from six to 
seven majors; 7s means that they took from seven to eight 
majors. Obviously the steps between the majors are made 
up of minors. : 
From this summary it is easy to determine the coherence 
of each core in quantity of material. This shows the solidar- 
ity of each curriculum and serves as a basis of comparing 
one core curriculum with the other in coherency. 
Table XIII shows the manner in which all coherent groups 
of any amount of majors and minors fall together in each 
core curriculum of each city. Tabulation is not made of the 
kind of material in each core, but only of the groups as they 
occur in any department. The purpose here should be to 
discover how compact the core curriculums are in order to 
supplement the facts of Table XII in curricula combinations. 
In the History core the mode is three majors, while the 
Commercial core has its mode in two majors. The Math- 
ematics core is about equally divided between groups of four 
majors and of three majors, which is likewise true for the 
Latin and Science cores. The Industrial core is chiefly in 
three major groupings, while the Home Economics core is 
almost equally distributed between two and three and four 
majors. This distribution. is, no doubt, strongly weighted 
by requirements in each curriculum of the several schools, 
and does not represent much of free election. However, 
there is enough latitude in the requirements of the city pro- 
grams to enable the student to show tendencies toward their 
choice in relating their work. The best use of Table XIII 
will come from combining it with the core-scheme table 
(XII) in each curriculum.

  CHAPTER V 
INTERPRETATIONS AND APPLICATIONS 
In the combination of data from the city tables shown in 
Division A, from the town tables shown in Division B, and 
from the county high-school tables shown in Division C, a 
composite of results is found. All the possibilities of such 
combination cannot be stated. Emphasis should be placed 
upon the basis of value for the unit of subject-matter, as- 
the curricula are formed from the practice of the 19,999 
graduates of high schools in city, county, and town. 
In order to avoid a cumbersome body of tables and to pro- 
mote clarity, only the city tables, which form Division A of 
the data, have been presented as corroborative and explan- 
atory. The tables of Section B and Section C have been 
placed in the same order in the library, to which reference 
can be made. All numbers of tables correspond in each 
section. Table I of the cities carries the same facts about 
the city graduates as Table I of the towns carries for the 
town graduates and as Table I of the county high schools 
does for the county high-school graduates. 
E 
A typical high-school program, according to the general 
tables (I to VI) of the cities, the towns, and the county 
high schools studied, would be something such as is de- 
scribed below. For the cities it would be composed of at 
least nine curricula, and the rank order of importance of 
each department of study contained within these curricu- 
lums would be: English, Mathematics, History, Science, 
Latin, Modern Language, Commerce, Home Economics, In- 
dustrial. The average number of units taken in each one of 
these departments would be approximately: English, 3.5; 
Mathematics, 2.8; History, 2.2; Science, 1.8; Latin, 1.7; 
Modern Language, 1.6; Home Economics, .78; Commerce, 
.98; Industrial, .45. 
For a typical town program there would be the same cur- 
riculums, with the following relationship of departments in 
rank order: Mathematics, History, Science, Latin, Modern 
Language, Home Economics, Commerce, Industrial. 
The average amount of work per pupil in each department 
would be approximately: English, 3.8; Mathematics, 3.2; 
History, 2.8; Science, 2.2; Latin, 1.9; Modern Language, 
-95; Home Economics, .9; Commerce, .6; Industrial, .3. ;

130 A Method of Evaluating 
For a typical county high-school program there would be 
the same curriculum, with the following relationship of de- 
partments in rank order: English, Mathematics, History, 
Science, Latin, Home Economics, Modern Language, Com- 
merce, Industrial. 
The average amount of work per pupil ibn in each de- 
partment would be approximately as follows: English, 3.9; 
Mathematics, 3.6; History, 3.3; Science, 2.8; Latin, 1.5; 
Home Economics, 1.1; Modern Language, .8; Commerce, 
.5; Industrial, .2. 
In the typical program for all schools combined in city, 
town, and county, the subjects of each curriculum are in rank 
order as follows: English, Mathematics, History, Science, 
Latin, Modern Language, Home Economics, Commerce, In- 
dustrial. 
The average amount of work per pupil taken within 
each department is approximately as follows: English, 3.8; 
Mathematics, 3.2; History, 2.7; Science, 2.33; Latin, 1.6; 
Modern Language, 1.1; Home Economics, .99; Commerce, 
-67 ; Industrial, .29.

How are subjects distributed over the four school years, 
and in what amount? Tables III and IV in each section of 
the data afford the facts, which may be expressed below. 
The year load of each type of school may be purely adminis- 
trative, but the facts are of leading significance toward 
value in each department and each subject of the depart- 
ment. 
The typical city program will show a raw distribution of 
units through the four years in the following ratios: Eng-
-P-A-G-E-131
  
Secondary-School Units 131 
lish—65: 64: 64: 58; Moder Language—12: 26: 37: 27; 
Latin—41: 36: 22: 16; Science—38: 19: 32: 31; Mathe- 
matics—62: 56: 43: 28; Commerce—12: 12: 20: 18; In- 
dustrial—10: 10: 7: 6; History—36: 40: 28: 39; Home 
Economics—12: 10: 16: 12. 4 
The typical town-school program shows a distribution of 
the units through the high-school years in the following 
ratios: English—12.6: 12.7: 12.4: 11.6; Mathematics—13:. 
12: 11.4: 4.7; History—6.5: 8.4: 8: 11.8; Home Econom- 
ics—38.2:. 2,9: 3.5: 3.8; Commerce—lL1: 11: 6:°4; Indus- 
trial—6: 13: 18: 17; Latin—7.6: 7.6: -4.8: 2.7; Modern 
Language—17: 35: 52: 42; Science—9: 5.7: 5.7: 6.7. 
A typical county high-school program cannot be shown, 
with the amount of each year, because of the failure of the 
records which were examined to show whether or not sub- 
jects were given in the first, second, third, or fourth year. 
Some of the records examined were sufficient to do this, but 
enough were not available to justify a combination of tables 
to this end. Therefore, Tables III and IV of the county 
high schools could not be made in accord with the same facts 
as in the cities and towns. 
In the typical program of schools in the cities and towns 
the subject and amount within the high-school years appear 
in the following general ratios: English—77: 77: 77: 69; 
Modern Language—14: 29.6: 42: 31; Latin—48.5: 44: 26.7: 
18.5; Science—47: 24.7: 37.7: 38; Mathematics—74.7: 68: 
54.8: 32.3; Commerce—12.3: 13.6: 21.5: 21; Industrial— 
21.5: 11: 7: 5.8; History—42.7: 48.5: 35.5: 50.5; Home 
Economics—15.4: 13.7: 19: 15.3.

TOWN DISTRIBUTION 
The distribution of the various subjects throughout the 
years of the high school for the towns exhibit a different 
situation from that condition described for the cities above. 
The departments are more compact, and the subjects follow 
an individual placement in a much more accurate way. The 
situation for the towns is as follows: 
Mathematics—First-year Algebra is found only in the 
first and second years, with more than 99 per cent in the 
first year. Second-year Algebra is found only in the second 
year, there being only two exceptions. Plane Geometry is 
placed entirely in the fourth year, with a single exception 
of one town, in which nine cases were taken in the third 
year. Arithmetic is divided between the first year of the 
high school and the fourth year; and while no data was 
obtained to that effect, it is presumed that the first-year 
Arithmetic is not in any way the same type of study as was 
taken in the fourth year. Out of 266 cases of Arithmetic 
in the towns, 65 per cent of them are in the fourth year 
and 25 per cent in the first year. Trigonometry is confined 
entirely to the fourth year. 
History—Ancient History extends throughout the four 
years of high school as follows: First year, 56 per cent; 
second year, 41 per cent; third year, 2 per cent; fourth 
year, 1 per cent. Medieval and Modern History extends 
throughout the four years of high school as follows: First 
year, 1.5 per cent; second year, 48 per cent; third year, 
46 per cent; fourth year, 4.5 per cent. United States His- 
tory extends throughout the third and fourth years of high 
school as follows: Third year, 34 per cent; fourth year, 66 
per cent. English History extends throughout the four  
-P-A-G-E-135
Secondary-School Units 135 
years of high school as follows: First year, 10 per cent; 
second year, 3 per cent; third year, 55 per cent; fourth 
year, 32 percent. Civics extends throughout the four years 
of high school as follows: First year, 13 per cent; second 
year, 10 per cent; third year, 25 per cent; fourth year, 52 
per cent. Current History extends only through the fourth 
year of high school. Political Economy is found only in 
the fourth year of high school. 
Science—Agriculture extends throughout the four years 
of high school as follows: First year, 9 per cent; second 
year 34 per cent; third year, 50 per cent; fourth year, 7 
per cent. General Science extends throughout the four 
years of high school as follows: First year, 85 per cent; 
second year, 12 per cent; third year, 1.5 per cent; fourth 
year, 1.5 per cent. Biology extends throughout the four 
years of high school as follows: First year, 1 per cent; sec- 
ond year, 90 per cent; third year, 7 per cent; fourth year, 
2 per cent. Botany extends throughout the four years of 
high school as follows: First year, 68 per cent; second year, 
20 per cent; third year, 9 per cent; fourth year, 3 per cent. 
Physics extends throughout three years, and is distributed 
as follows: Second year, 1 per cent; third year, 67 per cent; 
fourth year, 32 per cent. Physical Geography extends 
throughout the four years of high school as follows: First 
year, 78 per cent; second year, 19 per cent; third year, 2.5 
per cent; fourth year, .5 per cent. Chemistry extends 
throughout three years of high school as follows: Second 
year, .5 per cent; third year, 14 per cent; fourth year, 85.5 
per cent. Physiology extends throughout the four years 
of high school as follows: First year, 75 per cent; second 
year, 24 per cent; third year, .5 per cent; fourth year, .5 
per cent. Zodlogy extends throughout the four years, and is 
distributed as follows: First year, 32 per cent; second year, 
50 per cent; third year, 10 per cent; fourth year, 8 per cent. 
The other subjects of the towns could not be tabulated 
from the data with sufficient accuracy to enable any definite 
placement of subjects to be determined. The subjects here 
have placed themselves in a much more definite way than 
they were placed in the cities. Whether or not this is due to 
the small number of teachers or to the meager equipment, 
these facts point out very clearly that the curriculum of the 
towns have been administered in a much more restricted 
way than those of the cities. Wherever offerings in 
special groups have been made in the towns, the students 
have not availed themselves of the opportunity, but have 
followed certain regular lines of material as set forth above, 
and each subject has been placed in practically the same
-P-A-G-E-136
136 ‘ A Method of Evaluating 
position in the majority of instances. The tabulation of the 
towns enables their curriculum record to be divided into 
two parts—first, the regular channels, and, second, the 
exceptions. In most instances just enough exceptions have 
been taken to show that some thought has been given by the 
authorities to the possible value of subjects other than the 
so-called “old-line” studies. 
It has been impossible to secure data from the county 
high-school records that would enable a division to be made 
so as to show in what years the subjects have been taken. 
Most of these records have been presented on small cards, 
which are but summaries of the amount of work done, while 
the manuals and regulations under which these schools have 
done their work will allow the subjects to be taken any- 
where. Thus it has been impossible to discover any line of 
placement. 
From the above description it is obvious that a typical 
background for the choice of curriculum material can be 
found standardized through practice; or, if not standard- 
ized, that there is presented here a sufficient amount of 
practice to justify the claim that there are certain tenden- 
cies, and, therefore, sufficient justification for accepting the 
principle as a guide for practice in the future. It may not 
be possible to accept in toto any scheme of unit formation 
developed here or hereafter, but the principle of unit evalu- 
ation finds a basis here from many viewpoints. Will the 
unit of Mathematics be of the same value in every instance, 
no matter what the accompanying subjects? Will it be of 
the same value, no matter in what year of school it is taken? 
Can the school that gives 102 majors of Latin, with 835 
units of Mathematics, give Latin the same value as the 
school which gives 150 majors.of Latin out of 1,436 units 
of Mathematics, or the one giving 50 majors of Latin out 
of 1,041 units of Mathematics? 
In the cities of Atlanta and Memphis about the same 
number of total units has been studied; and of these, 
Atlanta presents 302 majors of History and Memphis 
150 majors of History; while Louisville, with 50 per cent 
more of total units studied than these two cities men- 
tioned, has only 150 majors of History. On the contrary, 
Nashville, with less than one-half the units of Louisville, 
has 242 majors of History. How can any just basis of 
evaluation of the unit be developed with such discrepancies 
and disparities and inequalities as arise from these simple 
comparisons? Does any unit have a chance to receive its 
proper emphasis when conditions are allowed to obtain such 
as the typical History item just given? It is apparent that
-P-A-G-E-137
  
  Secondary-School Units 137 
in terms of other subjects a major in History varies so 
greatly that any result accepted would seem great injustice 
somewhere. The strongest hope of correcting such a con- 
dition is the application of the core principle to the forma- 
tion of curriculums and to the evaluation of the units. 
But how shall the core principle be interpreted in the 
light of other curriculum principles? Does the core-cur- 
riculum principle destroy any of the accepted principles of 
curriculum building? Let application be made to some of 
them, and let it be seen how they will unite in practice. 
1. The objectives of secondary education must be met, 
no matter if these are applied ab extra, as in the Cardinal 
Principles, or in any other theoretical conference resolution, 
or ab intra, as Bobbitt would work with his multiplied 
objectives. All these may be carried out best through the 
adaptation of the core-curriculum policy... Within each pro- 
gram to be planned is found the liberalizing elements offered 
in wide detail, and at the same time the personal dynamic 
of the pupil preserved. Under this new principle the indi- 
vidual can do both, with no injury wrought to either side. 
The Commission on Reorganization set forth the large 
objectives not so much for the purpose of shaping scientific 
curriculum-making as to form an intelligent background 
from which all could work. The additional problem to be 
solved in making the commission’s work effective is to 
bring it about that the pupil shall see the objectives and 
realize the importance of each one.. The core principle 
provides such an attitude for.each pupil. 
2. The needs of the pupil are paramount. Only under 
such a new principle can this principle be realized. It is 
not scientific curriculum-making to force unit evaluation 
upon the pupil through prescribed curricula and hedge his 
desires or possibilities, as is done by differentiated pro- 
grams. The tacit unfairness of the practice is upheld in 
the facts developed in this study, showing that many stu- 
dents change from one course begun to some other. This 
was especially evident in the Louisville High School and also 
in Memphis. Under a core principle the individual is 
guided toward his needs, and each step is an emphasis to 
choose, with the authorities of the school, each advancing 
subject so closely related that every hope can be realized, 
no matter what his ultimate goal may be. 
8. The school must be made more and more articulate 
with life’s demands. Whatever this functional principle 
may mean, no curriculum can be superimposed. The re- 
sults of the Elyria Survey or the Los Angeles Survey or of 
any approach that would diagnose life’s needs and interests
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 A Method of Evaluating 
in the school can never be realized under a post hoc policy. 
The core principle uses the same philosophy as in these 
surveys, but its technique is pari passu, and also may add 
to the opinion of the student the weight of an advisor. 
4. The curriculum must embody the content of the social 
need and reflect the interests that are to be dominant in a 
worth-while social whole. Under such a principle there 
may be as many ways of treating unit material as there 
are curriculum-building agencies. Communities go to seed 
in opinions just as do individuals. Boards may determine 
in a one-sided way the program of their schools, while prin- 
cipals may go on forever riding hobbies that tend to disin- 
tegrate the social ideals. The core principle would step in 
here as a balance wheel to do no violence, but to give an 
opportunity for breaking a social or educational deadlock 
and for opening a way for greater progress. 
5. A principle of growth should be evident in every cur- 
riculum so that the school will have living programs. With 
an idea like this, the one point of emphasis is: What real 
adjustments are to be made when new material is intro- 
duced into the curriculum? The type of the new subjects 
introduced will constitute the dead or the living curriculum. 
The secret of a living curriculum is change. This change 
proceeds from rigid groupings to free elections. If the 
school is wide-awake and adds new vital courses and dis- 
cards old studies no longer demanded, we call that “prog- 
ress” and say that the school is “alive.” No principle could 
operate better to clarify progress in the new courses than 
the core principle. Social demands are best discovered 
through individual demands. When programs are ar- 
ranged about subjects as cores, all questions are answered 
about live issues and dead ones in the curriculum. 
6. All curriculums must have some things in common, 
and thus the principle of constants and variables has come 
to be generally accepted. In the earliest days of secondary 
schools all curricula were made up of constants. Gradu- 
ally choice entered, coming to be more and more empha- 
sized, until a few units at the present time constitute the 
constants. Some schools have no constants. If such a 
policy is continued, there is no conflict with the core prin- 
ciple, for each pupil will find it easy to include in the core 
this body of constants, the irreducible minimum of his 
course. 
7. If the constants and variables constitute the curricu- 
lum, then the administration of these shall be under the 
principle of some prescriptions and some elections. In the 
city systems where several courses are offered the student
-P-A-G-E-139
  Secondary-School Units 139 
has the choice of the course, and then the plan must be fol- 
lowed. If conflict arise in his thinking as to certain units 
included which are not desired, then a change is enterprised 
to anothér outlined course. No violence is done this princi- 
ple by the core curriculum, for the student will gradually 
come to the course where the election and prescriptions 
suit him or he will drop out entirely. If his course devel- 
ops around the core of his choice, he will naturally choose 
the sequences laid down in the catalogue. 
8. The principle of flexibility in the program cannot be 
violated by the core principle, since the idea is the same with 
added significance. The core provides for a fuller sequence, 
and, therefore, a richer possibility in the student’s program, 
with a reversed emphasis that whereas the burden was on 
the curriculum to find the pupil, now the pupil must find 
the curriculum that coheres within itself and at the same 
time meets his every need. The only possibility of error in 
discussing this new principle in the light of flexibility is that 
of admitting that the differentiated curricula of the past 
have not been vocationally coherent. 
9. The principle of free election leaves nothing to be said 
against the core principle. It. finds a strong ally, since the 
only danger in an outlined course under free election is that 
the program will not be coherent. Sequences and coheren- 
cies are guaranteed by the core principle, and thus the a la 
carte plan of curriculum-making needs this supplementation. 
10. A principle of arranging progress within the years of 
the curriculum will be aided by the core principle. Not 
only will each pupil pursue continued studies, but gather 
all the related material thereto as the years advance. The 
chief problem in a core curriculum is that of choosing ad- 
vanced units. Thus the curriculum of loosely strung units 
will not obtain. The principle of requiring only advanced 
units in the upper years of the school, and thereby securing 
advancement within the departments of study, is the real 
genius of the core curriculum. By such a plan majors and 
minors are properly related to the core and to the interests 
of the pupil from low to high values through periods of 
difficulty. Thus under a core principle of curriculum build- 
ing for each high-school pupil, with each unit properly eval- 
uated, there can be no conflict in the process of reconstruc- 
tion with any established principle. 
How can the value of the unit be interpreted under such a 
plan? 
The value of any program will always be that of the com- 
posite strength of the standards which are set. It is a weak 
definition of a curriculum to say it is 16 Carnegie units.
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 : A Method of Evaluating 
The real value of the unit can never be properly stated as 
one-fourth of a year’s work. There are too many elements 
to be considered. This study would maintain that the one 
most significant factor in the evaluation of the unit is its 
relationship to the other units within the program. This 
is working out the idea expressed by Judd when he pleaded 
for an intelligent coherence within the curriculum. It is 
the expression of the Articulation Committee when it called 
for a unified course of study in a four-year high school as 
the basis of college entrance. It is the idea of Stout, who, 
as chairman of the “Committee on the Unit” of the North 
Central Association, reported in 1917: “No unit is well or- 
ganized unless it articulates with the former years and car- 
ries on upward. There must be progress within the unit 
so that the topics mature as advance is made in the work.” 
When a curriculum has been formed of Latin, four years; 
English, four years; Greek, four years; Mathematics, four 
years, there can be no question as to the value of one unit of . 
either of these subjects. They are inseparably tied to- 
gether and derive their value from their relationship one 
toward the other. Compare the value of one unit of Latin 
in this curriculum with a unit of Latin in the following cur- 
riculum: English, three years; Latin, two years; History, 
one year; Science, one year; Greek, one year; Music, one 
year; Manual Training, two years; Agriculture, one year; 
Spanish, two years; Bookkeeping, two years. 
The value of a unit for college entrance can be estimated 
by the college authorities, and likewise the curriculum 
within which the unit is found. . If students enter for the 
B.A. degree, it would be reasonable to suppose that the 
value of their curricula is the same. It is reasonable to 
suppose also that if the values of curricula are the same, 
the sum total of the values of the units of the curricula are 
the same. How can the value of a unit of Latin or a unit of 
Greek or a unit of Science be determined from the four in- 
stances below: 
Four boys entered the same university in September, 
1922, and matriculated for the same degree. What does 
the value of a unit mean under each scheme? They of- 
fered: No. 1—English, four units; Latin, four units; Greek, 
three units; German, two units; Mathematics, four units. 
No. 2—English, four ‘units, Latin, four units; French, two 
units; Mathematics, three and one-half units; History, two 
units. No. 8—English, four units; Latin, four units; 
Greek, three units; Mathematics, three and one-half units; 
History, two units. No. 4—English, three units; Mathe- 
matics, three units; History, three units; Physics, one unit;
-P-A-G-E-141
  Secondary-School Units 141 
Spanish, four units; Civics, one-half unit; General Science, 
one unit; Physiology, one-half unit. It would seem from 
these four conditions that different unit standards have 
been applied and that the method of securing the value for 
No. 1 would not hold good for securing the value for the 
others. 
Likewise another university requires fifteen units for 
admission, as follows: English, three units; Mathematics; 
two and one-half units; some foreign language, two units. 
Thus seven and one-half units are required and seven and 
one-half units are elective. Three of these seven and one- 
half units are restricted to vocational subjects. The elec- 
tives are listed and total forty-two subjects. The question 
arises: What value would certain electives have if this list 
had been lengthened to eighty-four subjects or to one hun- 
dred and sixty-eight for the choice of the entrants? 
How does the value of a unit explain its standards in the 
study of the North Central Association High School by 
Koos in 1917? He states that the number of units granted 
to students that were graduated in four years or less range 
. from 14 to 21.4; that 11.8 per cent of those graduating did 
so with less than 16 units; that 87.3 per cent of those grad- 
uated with more than 16 units. Is a unit one-fourth of a 
year’s work? Also in Furst’s study of college entrance 
(above), where 95.5 per cent of the institutions required 
15 units for graduation and units offered: for entrance by 
the matriculants were as follows: 15 units, 36.3 per cent; 
less than 15 units, 9.2 per cent; more than 15 units, 54.5 
per cent; 1514 units, 15.6 per cent; 16 units, 22.2 per cent; 
1614 units, 5.6 per cent; 17 units, 4.8 per cent; from 1714 
units to 2614 units, 6.8 per cent. What is the unit value 
of the last three groups? Values in curriculum may be 
of as many kinds as desired by the one who counts. 
Value for material under the principle of core curriculum 
becomes value in relationship. One department of study is 
at the head of the list of subjects that remain together be- - 
cause of their mutual helpfulness. This core and its at- 
tendant subjects establish themselves through standard 
usage and come to have curriculum value. This curricu- 
lum will always have a unified value, which has been brought 
out so as to meet a definite and distinct demand or need. 
Actually it has not been so, but has degenerated more or 
less into an accumulation of unit material without combina- 
tions or significant relations. In the core curriculum the 
units of subjects have already combined through practice 
and speak a common message. The purpose has been uni- 
fied. If the best measure of the value of a curriculum is
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 A Method of Evaluating, 
the way in which it has met its objective, then a core cur- 
riculum has already proven its value, because it was formed 
on the highest educational bases by the individual to meet 
his needs. 
Unit value in relationship in a core curriculum comes, 
therefore, to be a certified value. The relations of the sub- 
ject contained in the curriculum have been approved and 
evaluated by enough cases to justify a conclusion. This en- 
ables a type of school to develop itself toward values that 
might not have an opportunity to reach other standards. A 
small high school can be a coherent school and meet all the 
demands of sequence and of internal harmony of organiza- 
tion and every other vital part of a genuine curriculum 
value. After all, it should not be the amount of equipment 
or of other standards for the school. so much as it is how 
well the subjects are related to a central purpose, if real 
value is produced in the curriculum. c

  <,A PREFACE 
This book has been written in the hope that it may 
be of service to teachers attempting to work out the 
new methods of curriculum organization who feel 
handicapped by a lack of concrete teaching material 
arranged in a form suitable for ready reference. 
The purpose of the book is to outline briefly the 
theory underlying the modern conception of the 
course of study, to give concrete suggestions for the 
organization of the curriculum according to those 
principles, and also references that may be used in 
the classroom for developing a course along these 
lines. The traditional course of study is arranged 
by subjects; it does not attempt to organize these 
subjects according to their relationship to life. The 
newer point of view is that the curriculum is an in- 
strument for interpreting to the child the world in 
which he lives. It is therefore organized in terms 
of social life. 
The book is not intended to be exhaustive in treat- 
ment. For instance, no attempt is made to include 
all industries. The industries which are taken up 
are those concerned with supplying man’s funda- 
mental needs, and represent type studies which sug- 
gest a method of organization which may be applied 
to any industry. Nor is it intended that the subject- 
matter should be used in the order here given. The 
logical method is necessarily followed in a textbook 
for teachers. No attempt is made to indicate the 
grade in which the material should be used. The 
aim has been to aggregate a core of universally use-

ful subject-matter which should be in the possession 
of every elementary school child. 
Though concerned entirely with subject-matter, 
the book is based upon the belief that subject-matter 
should be developed in connection with a program 
of educational activities. The whole course of study 
should bear relation to the child’s activities and his 
immediate environment, thus giving him a sense of 
the reality of what he is studying. In this way the 
curriculum of the elementary school will best fulfill 
its function of making clear to the child his place 
and relationship to the society in which he lives.

“<The social work of the school is often limited to training 
for citizenship. ... But it is futile to contract and cramp 
the ethical responsibilities of the school in this way... . 
To isolate the formal relationship of citizenship from the 
whole system of relations with which it is interwoven; to 
suppose that there is some one particular study that will 
make the child a good citizen; to suppose, in other words, 
that a good citizen is anything more than a thoroughly 
efficient and serviceable member of society, one with all his 
powers of body and mind under control, is a hampering 
superstition which it is hoped may soon disappear from 
educational discussion.’? 
Joun Dewey, ‘‘Moral Principles in Education.’’ 
‘CAt present the impulses which lie at the basis of the 
industrial system are either practically neglected or posi- 
tively distorted during the school period. Until the instincts 
of construction and production are systematically laid hold 
of in the years of childhood and youth, until they are trained 
im social directions, enriched by historical interpretation, 
controlled and illuminated by scientific methods, we certainly 
are in no position even to locate the source of our economic 
evils, much less to deal with them effectively.’’

INTRODUCTION 
The Contribution of the Nineteenth Century.—The 
last century witnessed an absolute revolution in our 
manner of living. In the space of a few short years 
the applications of science to industry produced an 
expansion the like of which was never before known 
in the history of the world. The inventions which 
were the immediate cause of the industrial revolu- 
tion followed one another with such rapidity that 
almost within the memory of those now living our 
whole economic life has undergone a complete trans- 
formation. Transportation facilities and devices for 
communication have been so perfected through the 
applications of steam and electricity that what would 
a comparatively short time ago have been regarded 
as miracles are now matters of everyday occurrence. 
By means of these changes industry has progressed 
from the individualized task of provisioning the 
isolated family to the associated work of the many in 
supplying world-wide needs. The world for the first 
time in history has become a physical unity in which 
millions of human beings co-operate in the produc- 
tion and exchange of goods. 
The nineteenth century not only gave us these 
economic advantages; it is also noted for the con-

summation of political democracy. The development 
of government throughout the ages represents the 
struggle for the freedom of the individual within 
the social group. As we pass from age to age we 
see the emergence of larger and larger groups into 
political control. Conditions on the American con- 
tinent in the eighteenth century were calculated to 
favor full democratic control. The life of the early 
settlers in subduing the vast stretches of wilderness 
of the western world developed a hardy, energetic 
people clinging tenaciously to the privileges of in- 
dividual liberty. When, at the close of the century, 
our revolutionary forefathers wrote into the Declara- 
tion of Independence that ‘‘all governments derive 
their just powers from the consent of the governed,’’ 
they but converted into a political principle an ideal 
which had been engendered in the hearts and minds 
of the people by their economic and social experi- 
ences. All our most characteristic political phrases 
exemplify the belief that government is a co-opera- 
tive affair, the result of the combined efforts of the 
many.’ American nationality has embarked upon a 
political enterprise in which it is assumed that the 
average person is fitted to pass intelligent judgment 
upon our common life, that every man has the ability 
to control the lines upon which our economic, our 
social, and our political affairs shall develop. It is 
a recognition of the fact that the highest develop- 
ment of the individual and social progress are mu- 
tually interdependent. A society can not develop 
further than the capacity of the individuals that 
compose it. A democratic society must depend upon 
the level of intelligence of the average of its mem-

bers. Therefore, individual opportunity is limited 
only by individual capacity. This political ideal is 
in harmony with the scientific knowledge of the best 
psychological and social development of human 
beings. 
This in brief summarizes the contribution of the 
nineteenth century ta the world’s advancement. 
The Achievement of the Nineteenth Century Sets 
the Task for the Twentieth._—As a result of the work- 
ing together of all these forces we have today a 
highly complex, rapidly moving world, in which each 
individual must come in contact and enter into free 
social relationship with a great many other human 
beings. The world as it is now organized calls for 
co-operation on a large scale, yet few adults living 
today have an intelligent understanding of their re- 
lationship to the processes with which their daily 
lives are concerned. It is natural that the great 
advances brought about by the industrial revolution 
should first manifest themselves on the material side. 
The trouble is that our cultural growth has not 
equalled our economic progress; our philosophy has 
not kept pace with action. The changes thus far 
made in society by the industrial revolution have 
been technical; they have not yet become effective 
in our social ideals. As yet we are scarcely aware 
of the social and ethical values implicit in the indus- 
trial régime in which we are living. The result is 
that our lives are governed by a duality of aims: 
the practical and the ideal. The daily round of 
events forces us into active relations with the 
economic world, but our thoughts and feelings are
-P-A-G-E-14
    6 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
not intelligently and sympathetically engaged to- 
ward it. It is possibly too much to expect that we 
should realize fully the significance of the great 
changes that society has so lately passed through, 
yet in our failure to do so lies the great danger to 
present-day life. Ideal and ethical factors, divorced 
from their vital connection with everyday affairs, be- 
come weak and ineffective, powerless to affect con- 
duct, while our economic life will remain hard and 
crude so long as it is unenlightened by social and 
spiritual values. In the consummation of world 
commerce and world communication, and in giving 
political sanction to the principle of individual 
liberty and equality, the nineteenth century pre- 
sented us with the mechanism of association, blazing 
the way for a type of life that is social in the real 
sense of the term. But this mechanism must remain 
inert until we achieve an intelligent conception of 
interdependence, and a realization of the respon- 
sibilities of associated living. The vision of millions 
of human beings, remote in time and space, all work- 
ing together to make the earth a better home for 
mankind, is surely one to stir the deepest reaches 
of the imagination. And this is the vision that is 
necessary to enable us to see within our daily round 
of experiences anything except routine utilitarian 
values. When this vision prevails, there will be 
ushered in a period of social reconstruction which 
will match in greatness the economic expansion of 
the nineteenth century. 
The Present Social Situation Essentially a Prob- 
lem of Education—All the inconsistencies of the

social situation find their reflex in present-day educa- 
tion. A general survey of educational method would 
reveal it wavering between two ideals: inherited be- 
liefs and points of view struggle to produce what 
has been traditionally conceived of as a liberal cul- 
ture, while everyday life demands suitable prepara- 
tion. The social implications and responsibilities of 
education in a democracy are as yet not generally 
appreciated. The democratic régime is open to 
serious dangers which can be escaped only through 
the processes of education. The fate of democracy 
is bound up with the advancement of social educa- 
tion. It is obvious that the liberation of individual 
capacity unrestrained by the refining influence of 
social discipline would be a menace to society. Free- 
dom of thought for the individual entails respon- 
sibility to think in social terms. Participation of 
the individual in social affairs is safeguarded only 
by social intelligence. This is especially true at 
present when social relationships are so varied and 
so close. All factors have combined to make modern 
life one of absolute interdependence. The indi- 
vidual has given control of the security upon which 
his life depends into public keeping because he has 
found that greater progress results from this ar- 
rangement. This condition creates a great public 
trust to which everyone is individually responsible. 
Life itself in a democratic society provides social 
education for the individual, but this at best is 
chance and partial. Intentional education should 
consciously aim to produce what is unconsciously 
wrought by the cireumstances of life. It is the par- 
ticular task of those engaged in twentieth-century  
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE | 
education to construct a type of education which will 
harmonize the ideal of liberal culture with that of 
social serviceability, which will develop the indi- 
vidual and at the same time discipline his powers 
to social uses. Thus only can the achievements of 
the nineteenth century be made tributary to life. 
Then and only then will social democracy, that last 
fine flower of evolution, flourish upon the earth. 
TwENTIETH CENTURY EDUCATION 
The crucial question then for education today is: 
how shall we educate for intelligent participation in 
a social democracy? If we are to accomplish this, 
we must first of all make the school itself a genuine 
social institution. Modern psychology has made it 
clear that we cannot prepare children for any par- 
ticular mode of life except through experiences 
which habitually call into play the particular quali- 
ties which we wish to develop. If we wish children 
to become highly intelligent social beings, every 
arrangement within the school must be adjusted to- 
ward that end. The first necessity is that a real 
community organization of which the pupils are the 
responsible members be substituted for the tradi- 
tional classroom conceived of as a place set apart in 
which to learn and recite lessons. How can this 
change be brought about? 
The answer to that question involves considera- 
tion of the conditions necessary to community life 
and the relationship of the various school resources 
to the establishment of community life. Mere living

INTRODUCTION 9 
together in physical proximity does not constitute 
a community, as we know. A social group is an 
association of people having some common purpose. 
They are jointly engaged upon some enterprise in 
which each one participates according to his par- 
ticular abilities and desires, and gradually they are 
welded together into a social unity by the strong 
bonds of common experiences and interests. The 
school must set up an environment which requires 
social co-operation. The child lcarns by experiences; 
he learns to be social through shared experiences. 
The simplest way to produce this result is through 
the introduction of group activities as the articu- 
lating core of the curriculum. When children co- 
operate with their fellows in work and play projects 
of common interest to them, under conditions per- 
mitting education, social discipline enters into the 
very process of learning. 
The Choice of Activities—The introduction of ac- 
tivities into the school program is in harmony with 
the psychological development of children. The 
child is essentially active, but not all of his activities 
are of equal social value. One of the most important 
tasks of the school is, therefore, the selection of such 
activities as are best adapted to each stage of child 
growth and which at the same time hold the greatest 
promise as a preparation for the social responsibili- 
ties of adult life. 
In choosing activities, other things being equal, 
those which are socially most fundamental should 
come first as the foundation upon which to build the 
rest later. Throughout the ages from the earliest  
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
times down to the present the industries concerned 
with supplying the fundamental necessities of life 
have been the dominant force in upbuilding and 
maintaining social structures. Men have had to work 
in order to live, and through their work they have 
not only supplied the necessities of life, but have 
developed the various institutions upon which social 
life rests. The elew to understanding the world 
comes, therefore, through a study of these industries 
and their relationship to the other phases of life. 
Insight into the fundamental processes by which 
society keeps itself going is essential for children, 
since upon them will fall the responsibility of ad- 
vancing those activities. This is especially important 
now when the social situation surrounding the child 
is so complex as to be incomprehensible without 
analysis and explanation. A half century ago the 
child seemed to have some place in the normal 
scheme of things. On all sides his elders were en- 
gaged in pursuits of high educational value to him. 
He saw the wheat growing in the field, ground into 
flour at the nearby mill, and made into bread in the 
kitchen. He saw the sheep sheared, the wool carded 
and spun, and made into clothing. The entire indus- 
trial process stood revealed from the production of 
the raw materials to the finished articles actually put 
to use. As he grew older he shared in these experi- 
ences. Life was full of interest and meaningful em- 
ployment. All of this is changed today by the 
changed conditions under which we live. The child 
of today has no such opportunity for real experiences 
at home, and the activities which he sees going on 
about him are too complicated to have meaning for
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION ll 
him. This is the situation with which modern educa- 
tion has to deal. There is no better way of giving 
children an insight into the complex situation of the 
present than to give them experiences in its funda- 
mental processes. It is only thus by coming into 
active relations with them that they can understand 
them. Children who have experienced the whole 
round of activities from the production of the raw 
material to its manufacture into forms adapted to 
use and need have the key to understanding the 
common problems of man, the successful solving of 
which is essential to the life of man ‘upon the earth. 
Upon such activities may be built a knowledge of 
human beings in their essential relationships of liv- 
ing together in society. If these activities are made 
co-operative group projects, social organization and 
social discipline will result. 
The Relationship Between Activities and the 
Course of Study.—It is possible, of course, to develop 
activities in school in such a way that they become 
mere modes of routine employment. Such was the 
method of much of the old-fashioned busy-work, or 
of vocational education interpreted in the narrow 
sense. The entire emphasis is put upon the mechan- 
ical side, upon the development of skill. Such 
a method neglects the very purpose for which activi- 
ties should be undertaken in school. Every activity 
that is educationally worth while is set in a net-work 
of social connections. Education should see that 
activities are so undertaken as to render as many 
of these connections perceptible as possible. The 
enriching subject-matter which gives significance to
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
activities constitutes the course of study. We must 
work out the social possibilities of activities and 
organize the curriculum accordingly. Activities 
oriented by a liberal scheme of subject-matter rise 
above the level of training and become educative in 
the best sense of the term. 
The Organization of the Course of Study.—The 
traditional course of study consists largely of in- 
formation distributed among the various branches 
of study, planned out according to logical arrange- 
ment, divided up into lessons, memorized and recited 
upon. Sometimes there is an attempt to correlate 
the various studies, sometimes they are taken in 
unrelated bits. Such an organization of subject-mat- 
ter is external to the processes of learning, and it 
fails to show the relation between what is learned 
and life. If education is to reproduce conditions of 
life, the activities of children, guided into funda- 
mental social occupations, and built up by enriching 
subject-matter which shows their meaning and rela- 
tionship to social life, should be the correlating prin- 
ciple of the curriculum. Thus organized, knowledge 
is assimilated and enters into experience. By this 
method subject-matter, whether it be geography, 
history, science, or whatever, will be sought as it is 
needed to illuminate a situation. All the studies in 
the curriculum have a relationship to social life and 
are there for the purpose of interpreting that life 
to the children. A rational attack upon subject- 
matter means cutting across the artificial subject 
boundaries whenever necessary and using subject- 
matter of whatever kind in accordance with need.
-P-A-G-E-21
INTRODUCTION 13 
This is in accordance with the psychologically rather 
than the logically developed program of studies. 
Such a use of subject-matter is not the old external 
conception of correlation in which, as Dr. Dewey 
remarks, the teacher is at some pains to weave a 
little arithmetic into the history lesson. It is rather 
the method of the new scientific technique of cur- 
riculum-making which aims to reveal to children 
through the instrumentality of the various subjects 
the relationships of things in life. 
If the course of study is not laid out in advance 
and followed in logical steps, the matter of records 
assumes an important place as a part of school tech- 
nique. Through some such plan as suggested on 
the accompanying Curriculum Record it is possible 
for a teacher to keep a record of the development 
of the course of study, classified under subject head- 
ings, and thus note the progress of subject-matter 
in its relation to experience. 
The Nature of Thinking—Thinking of the most 
valuable type does not take place without some ex- 
citing cause. It arises out of the need of meeting 
some problem and reflecting upon the best way of 
solving it. This leads to planning, judging, deciding 
upon the goal to be reached and the successive steps 
necessary to the realization of one’s aim. Activities 
should be developed in school through the successive 
solving of problems as they emerge. When we have 
a co-operative attack made by a group upon a prob- 
lem of common interest to them, we have thinking 
functioning socially. Such a type of thinking may 
be developed in school by substituting for the tradi-
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
tional recitation, which is usually only the testimony 
of memorized facts, the exceedingly valuable social 
experience afforded by group discussion. Such dis- 
cussions will involve group-planning for the group; 
it will give opportunity for division of labor based 
upon individual differences through individual in- 
vestigations; it will arrive co-operatively at conclu- 
sions after individual reports have been made to the 
group. Individuals pool their experiences and abili- 
ties for the advancement of the group. Whena child 
realizes the need of a group and volunteers to supply 
it by individual effort, we have the individual project 
operating upon a social rather than upon an in- 
dividualistic plane. By this method we build up 
within the group judgments that no individual could 
have evolved for himself. It is one of the best anti- 
dotes for one-sided generalizations and individual 
bias. 
The erucial demand of the présent is for the appli- 
cation of intelligence to the economic and social prob- 
lems with which we are confronted. Education must 
be dedicated to this task. Only those who have been 
trained through years of practice to think in this 
way will be able to order social changes instead of 
being overwhelmed by them.*

THE FAMILY, 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    “*T believe that school life should grow gradually out of 
home life; that it should take up and continue the activities 
with which the child is already familiar in the home. 
“I believe that tt should exhibit these activities to the 
child and reproduce them in such ways that the child will 
gradually learn the meaning of them, and be capable of 
playing his own part in relation to them. 
“*T believe that this is a psychological necessity, because 
it is the only way of securing continuity in the child’s 
growth, the only way of giving a background of past ea- 
perience to the new ideas given in school. 
“‘T believe it is also a social necessity because the home 
is the form of social life in which the child has been nur- 
tured and in connection with which he has had his moral 
training. It is the business of the school to deepen and 
extend his sense of values bound up in his home life.’’

the community, and the dependence of both upon the whole 
world. 
*
-P-A-G-E-68
“‘The rational method of observation, recognizing the real 
concentration of life around each member of society, ex- 
plores the concentric circles of social activity from the actual 
standpoint of the observer. The child should begin to study 
economics literally,—the law of the household,—he should 
learn the civics and ethics and history of the household, in 
the practice of normal household relations. The economy 
of politics and ethics and history of the school, and then 
of the parents’ shop, and then of the neighboring factory, 
and later of the whole town, are the best educational material 
that the sociologist can recommend. In other words, the 
social desideratum is that the developing member of society 
shall become analytically and synthetically intelligent about 
the society to which he belongs. The precision of his social 
intelligence in general depends upon the exactness of his 
knowledge of details in the life which he most intimately 
shares. 
“‘Observation of the structure, functions, and forces of 
life in one’s own community is the normal beginning of true 
and large social intelligence and action. 
“*The change in school methods which I am urging is the 
introduction of this laboratory study of the social facts, 
processes, and forces nearest at hand, as exhibiting typical 
social relations in all nations, times, and places.’’ 
ALBION SMALL, 
‘The Demands of Sociology Upon Pedagogy.’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
THE COMMUNITY, 
The appreciation of unity of interest in the home 
community forms the basis of the conception of unity 
of interest in the larger world community. The home 
neighborhood is the pupil’s immediate domain of 
observation and experience. From it he derives a 
stock of ideas that should furnish an understanding 
of the fundamental principles of associated living: 
of how men co-operate for the better satisfaction of 
their common needs. 
Community organization offers certain advan- 
tages which could not be secured otherwise. How 
each of these arrangements contributes to the wel- 
fare of the home. 
TRANSPORTATION 
The importance of transportation as grograpny 
an element in community life. Show in- 
tricate and varied relationship between transporta- 
tion and community well-being: economic—connect- 
ing producer and consumer ; social—furthering inter- 
course and exchange of ideas; political—making 
possible the union of local units into units of larger 
size. How the development of industry depends 
upon transportation facilities. What transportation

means to the farmer, what it means to the city 
dweller. 
Means of Transportation.—Streets, roads, canals, 
natural waterways, railroads, ocean. Various kinds 
of vehicles and power used. Advantages of each. 
Streets 
The importance of streets to the economic and 
social life of the community. The necessity for clean, 
well-lighted, well-paved streets. How these are 
secured by community organization.   (For reading references on these subjects, see ‘‘ Problems 
of Municipal Sanitation, p. 81. For references on the 
evolution of the department of street-cleaning, see ‘‘Street- 
cleaning,’’ p. 187.) 
The Street-Car 
The growth of a community depends upon the 
transportation facilities within the community. The 
expansion of a community goes hand in hand with 
local transportation systems. The trolley has been 
a powerful agency in extending cities over larger 
areas, and in relieving congestion. Rapid transit 
enables people to live in the suburbs.

REGULATIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF A 
COMMUNITY 
Under the conditions of modern life aan 
interdependence is so complete that un- 
less co-operation is secured great harm may result. 
The family now exercises no control over the things 
essential to maintaining life. It is dependent for 
every article of food and clothing, for heat, light, 
water, ete., upon the products of other places 
brought to it by other people. The aggregation of 
large numbers of people in small areas has given 
rise to certain problems. Many of the dangers of 
community life are beyond the control of the indi- 
vidual. They require the co-operation of the whole 
community.
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE COMMUNITY 79 
‘When communities were small it was possible for 
all the people to meet together to discuss matters 
of common importance and determine what should 
be done. With the greater complexity of modern 
life it has become necessary to have a special group 
of people responsible for these things. Government 
is the machinery of association—the means by which 
the individual secures the benefits of community 
living.

SOCIAL EVOLUTION 
The historic explanation of fundamental present-day 
social agencies shows how each of them arose and developed 
in response to some need of mankind. 
Human culture has developed through group experiences. 
It is a complex of forces, geographical, biological, psycho- 
logical, and economic, which combine to affect human affairs. 
The responses to them in the form of activities and achieve- 
ments are recorded by history.

  “*The complexity of contemporary life is so great that 
wt is dificult for children to grasp its fundamental sig- 
nificance, so that it is frequently necessary to analyze the 
situation into simpler elements. By going back into the 
past and showing how various social arrangements came into 
existence im response to man’s needs, and by tracing their 
development step by step their present complex aspect may 
be explained. It is for this reason that the study of primi- 
tive life ts of great importance in throwing light upon the 
origin of a number of the necessities of our everyday life. 
It may be taken with great profit in connection with the 
study of community life. Such a motive indeed presents 
the only legitimate excuse for undertaking the study, and 
suggests the type of work to be undertaken. In primitive 
life we have man of a rather simple type in direct contact 
with the forces of nature, and face to face with fundamental 
economic and social problems. It is easy for even young 
children to grasp the significance of the situation, and to 
appreciate the ingenuity and inventive genius of man, by 
which he brings the forces and resources of nature under 
the control of his purposes, and thus lays the foundation for 
our own supremacy.’?’

shed their foliage were represented by the oak and 
the birch. A thick undergrowth provided places of 
refuge for animals in need of protection. Wild peas

and a variety of wild grasses grew in the open spaces. 
The First People.—Characteristics. Differences - 
between man and animals. The early history of man-

of mind, gradually gained control of his environ-

The Fishing Stage 
THE EARLY SEA PEOPLE (First Steps in the Conquest of 
the Waters) 
In the course of time the hunting grounds became 
exhausted and it became necessary for the people 
to find new sources of food supply. They migrated 
till they came to the sea, and gradually learned the 
arts of fishing and traveling upon the water. The 
shoals of deep sea fish that came to the shore in the 
spawning time tempted man to follow them. At first 
he learns to make fishing tackle and to trap fish in 
the shallow places near the shore. Later he invents 
the boat and follows the deep sea fish. Thus he gains 
control of an alien element and greatly increases his 
food supply. 
Dogs found in traps. Young in hollow log.

  118 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
The Pastoral Stage 
The change from hunter and fisher life to pastoral 
life means a change from a life absolutely dependent 
upon natural resources to a life that could depend 
upon the production of food. It marks a great step 
in human progress. The transition was, of course, 
gradual and was brought about by necessity. Ani- 
mals had become very scarce because of wasteful 
hunting, and because they were developing skill in 
eluding the hunter. Population was increasing and 
a given area could no longer support the people 
living upon it. Therefore man was forced to find 
some new way of increasing his food supply. 
Steps which Led to the Domestication of Animals. 
Improvements in traps enabled the hunters to take 
the animals alive. Some of these kept as pets no 
doubt increased in numbers. As the grass-eating 
animals are less fierce, they easily lend themselves 
to domestication through care. Early man perceived 
the advantage of raising animals as a source of food 
supply. Their domestication enabled him to be 
assured of his food supply and to increase it at will. 
It therefore offered him greater security of life. 
Moreover, the animals were hardy and easily cared 
for, and therefore gave him increased leisure for 
other things. Like hunters, the pastoral people were 
still forced to be nomads. They still had to find 
water and pasture for their flocks. 
Pastoral life brought with it new duties and new 
problems. The flocks had to be protected from the
-P-A-G-E-127
THE STUDY OF PRIMITIVE LIFE 119 
wild beasts that preyed upon them. This required 
thought and care. It required a large community to 
herd the flocks and therefore the young men had to 
remain with the tribe. The effect of this was to 
strengthen tribal organization. Sympathetic rela- 
tions developed within the group. Group loyalty 
was developed. The tribe father was the head of 
the tribal organization. The spirit of reverence was 
developed by the patriarchal family. 
Home-Life.—As the shepherds were still nomads 
home-life was necessarily simple. The necessity for 
frequent transportation reduced the dwelling and 
furnishings to the lightest weight and the most 
portable form. Domestic conveniences were neces- 
sarily limited. 
There was great advance in the textile arts at this 
time. Wool was spun, dyed, and woven into clothing. 
The soil was cultivated to some extent. Sometimes 
the tribes halted during the growing season until the 
grain was harvested, and then moved on. 
Transportation.—This is the time of the beginning 
of transportation. Having tamed animals, man now 
began to use them to carry burdens. The value of 
the horse or the ox to the shepherd. Tents, tools 
and weapons were laid on a skin and hauled by the 
horse or ox. To prevent the skin from wearing out, 
wooden skids were put underneath. Still later a 
roller suggested by a fallen tree led to the invention 
of the wheel. 
Increased leisure led to the development of the 
arts: The dance, music, singing, story-telling. These 
play and art activities were the natural develop- 
 
-P-A-G-E-128

ments of their work. Weaving songs and games, 
pantomimes, dramatizations offered relief from the 
monotony of work. 
The conditions of nomad life prevent the advance 
beyond a certain point in civilization. There could 
be no permanent community life and therefore no 
special political life or code of law. Law is still 
unwritten custom. The great characteristic of this 
period was its humanizing effect.

The Agricultural Stage 
The development of agriculture was gradual. 
Primitive man in his pursuit of plant foods observed 
that plants found by experience to be good as food 
grew far apart and were often choked out by other 
plants about them. He began pulling up the useless
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE STUDY OF PRIMITIVE LIFE 121 
plants. In searching the ground for seeds he had 
scratched the surface with his digging-stick and he 
observed that plants grew better when the soil 
around them was stirred in this way. He noticed 
how the seeds of plants fell to the earth and grew 
into new plants, and learned that he could produce 
new plants at will by planting seeds and caring for 
the plant as it grew. This is the crude beginning of 
agriculture. 
Agriculture probably began with the cultivation 
of grains. They are highly nutritive and can be 
stored throughout the winter. They therefore solved 
the big problem of early man, which was to increase 
his food supply and render his future more secure. 
He found that he could greatly increase the produc- 
tive power of the soil if he prepared it before plant- 
ing the seeds. By dragging a stick along he produced 
a furrow. The first plow was the forked limb of a 
tree. He first cut the grain with a rude knife; later 
he found that a bent knife (sickle) cut better, while 
a knife fastened to a handle was better still. Thus 
the various processes were gradually learned. 
The development of agriculture brought with it 
various new problems. ‘A vegetable food supply re- 
quires much more care and attention than animal 
foods. It is subjected to various dangers such as 
storm, drought, insects, ete. Constant watchfulness 
and care are necessary. It also required staying in 
one place for some time, as it takes some time for 
the plants to grow and the crops to be harvested. 
When man began tilling the soil he gave up the 
nomadic life. 
Settlement in one place led to other changes in 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    
   122 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
mode of life. As the home did not have to be moved, 
it took on a more permanent character. Rude houses 
took the place of the tent. Comforts and con- 
veniences could also be acquired. At this time the 
idea of private property developed and took shape. 
Man became tied to the land. He had put his labor 
into the soil and therefore wished to reap the reward 
of it. 
Neighbors dwelling upon the soil had common in- 
terests, and a more advanced social organization is 
possible. The wandering nomadic tribes are gradu- 
ally converted into groups dwelling together. Roads 
are improved, wheels are used on vehicles. Furni- 
ture is invented, and articles conducive to comfort 
and pleasure begin to appear. 
Private property demands law. People must con- 
form to the society of which they have become a 
part, customs crystallize into law, and the settled 
state gradually grows up. 
Gradually diversified occupations are developed, 
cities are built, trade begins and wealth begins to 
accumulate. The way is now open for unending 
development. Civilization may be said to begin with 
agriculture.

SECTION 4 
THE STUDY OF PIONEER LIFE 
This study shows the mode of life necessary before the 
industrial revolution in contrast to life today with its many 
conveniences. The pioneer, the frontiersman, the colonist 
must depend upon his own efforts to win from nature the 
things essential to maintaining life. Gradually the pioneer 
develops community life in which he begins to depend upon 
others. The beginnings of division of labor and co-opera- 
tion. 
This work is not restricted to any particular locality. 
The aim is to give various concrete stories illustrating 
typical conditions.
-P-A-G-E-134
  
“,.. Nearly everybody was a farmer or cattle-raiser, 
whatever his ostensible occupation; the absence of the nar- 
row specialist is as striking as the presence of the jack-of- 
all-trades. Of manufacturing there was little except along 
the line of home-industry for local use. Consumption was 
of simple things locally produced. The food was grown for 
the most part by the eater of it, clothes were home-spun 
where they were not made of the pelts of animals, houses 
were the product of the personal industry of their owners 
aided by co-operation in the ‘raising’ process on the part 
of the neighbors. In a word, the consumption of materials 
took place near the spot where they were produced. 
““This was necessarily the case in view of the rudimentary 
character of distribution. Roads and vehicles were alike 
primitive, and the water-ways, though these were not well- 
charted and safeguarded, provided the best means of com- 
munication. In view of these conditions exchange took on 
of necessity a primitive type. It was developed on a small 
and local scale, and was largely barter-trade. 
“*It was noted above that the settlements produced locally 
for local consumption. There was in them economic self- 
sufficiency and independence that worked out into a general 
mood corresponding to these qualities. ... Hence a democ- 
racy inherent in the nature of things and representing the 
type of adaptation of society to environment inevitable for 
success in the life-conditions. . . . Hence the impatience of 
control, revolution, and the founding of a democratic 
republic.’’

How the Pioneer Family Traveled. How They

There were no railroads. The trails of animals and 
the paths made by the Indians were the original 
roads. Roads were few and in very bad condition. 
The water-ways provided the best means of trans- 
portation, but was slow and the use of boats and 
water-ways was necessarily limited. There were no 
steamboats.

gather crops, protect their homes in time of danger 
—the beginning of co-operation. 
The beginning of division of labor and specializa- 
tion. Individual differences in people. Some people 
are better at one thing, some at another. Interests 
and abilities vary. One man especially skillful at 
one thing begins spending all his time at it. Has 
not time to raise food and perform all the other 
activities necessary to sustaining life. Has to depend 
on someone else for these things. The beginning of 
excharige of work. In the course of time the com- 
munity comes to have different kinds of workmen 
upon each of whom it can depend for some kind of 
service, while each of them depends on others to 
supply the want that he has neither the time nor 
the skill to supply for himself. Thus differentiation 
of occupations and interdependence develop in the 
simplest communities. This division of labor is 
found to be advantageous to the community. Wants 
are satisfied best by relying upon the person who 
can do the thing needed best. Typical industries of 
a community. Those established first for the satis- 
faction of primary wants, others grow out of these.

Exchange of Goods.—Division of labor leads to

need to obtain others. This is the beginning of trade. 
Bartering the first form of exchange of goods. The 
disadvantages of barter—if a person had a bushel 
of wheat and needed a pair of shoes, he would have 
to find a person who had shoes and needed wheat. 
It was also difficult to make an exchange of equal 
value. At first some characteristic commodity was 
chosen as the standard of value. There was little 
money in circulation and little need of money. The 
first money used in the colonies.

Social Life-—When self-maintenance is assured, a 
society naturally turns to the satisfaction of those 
wants above the mere necessities of life. The social 
life of a community grew naturally out of its 
economic life. The settlers turned some of their 
work into play. Homely festivals, like the harvest 
home accompanying the harvest, apple-parings, 
quilting parties, husking-bees and corn-shucking 
were typical. In these social gatherings young and 
old found wholesome enjoyment. Everyone had to 
do his part in support of the home and neighborhood. 
This produced a simple, home-loving people; it de- 
veloped such virtues as frugality, diligence, skill, and 
self-reliance. Why the store was the social center— 
Saturday night, after the week’s work was done, 
there was time to do the necessary errands. The 
post office was usually connected with thergtore.

Colonial Industries—The economic life of the 
original settlers was extremely simple, as we have 
seen. Beginning with the natural division of labor 
determined by natural aptitudes, it was not long 
before these industries took the entire time of those 
who engaged in them. The country was one of mag- 
nificent natural resources; the population was grow- 
ing by a steady stream of emigration from Europe. 
Such conditions presented favorable opportunity for 
the development of specialized industries. The first 
industries to be developed were the extractive indus- 
tries, the fundamental industries that support life. 
Other industries sprang up as needs and opportuni- 
ties directed. Means of transportation were limited, 
and methods of distribution as yet undeveloped. 
Under these circumstances industry could not de- 
velop beyond the needs of the local market.

Agriculture.—Agriculture was one of the first in- 
dustries to flourish. The methods were crude and 
primitive. The number of cultivated plants were 
few. Farming implements were clumsily made of 
wood. Nevertheless the climate and the soil were 
favorable to the production of crops. 
Lumbering.—The colonists were surrounded by 
great forests, and there early began to cut down the 
trees and utilize the lumber for various purposes. 
The first saw-mill was established in 1654. 
Ship-Building.—In New England the forests came 
almost to the water’s edge, so that ship-building 
naturally became an important industry. Ship-yards 
were scattered all along the New England coast, 
and the ship-builders gradually developed a very 
superior type of wooden ship. 
Fishing.—There was abundance of fish in the New 
England waters, and when the supply there gave 
out, the fishermen made use of their ships and fol- 
lowed the fish north to the Newfoundland Banks. 
The whaling industry also flourished at this time. 
Textile Industries—These were scattered through- 
out the country in the homes. 
This is the way people lived in America up to 
about 1800. ‘Life at that time forms the greatest 
contrast to modern life. How did those great changes 
come about that have made such a great change in 
our mode of living? The nineteenth century marks 
the beginning of a new era in the world’s history. 
It marks one of the greatest stages in man’s power 
to master nature.

THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRIAL 
REVOLUTION 
The characteristic which distinguishes industrial 
life today from that of any other period is the uni- 
versal use of machinery run by steam or electrical 
power. The inventions which brought about the 
change from the pioneer type of life to modern life 
have practically all been made in the last one hun- 
dred and fifty years. Change succeeded change with 
such rapidity that within this short time the whole 
manner of people’s living has been completely 
revolutionized. This has caused the period to be 
known as the industrial revolution. 
From Hand-made to Machine-made Goods 
The first of the great changes which brought about 
the age of machinery took place in England in the 
making of cloth. For centuries England had been 
the great sheep-raising and wool manufacturing 
country of the world. Though sheep can live almost 
anywhere, they thrive particularly well on the kind 
of soil found in England. The great industry in 
England at the beginning of the eighteenth century 
was the manufacture of woolen goods. These goods 
were made by families in their cottages. The wool 
145
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
was still combed by hand, spun by the spinning- 
wheel and woven by the old cumbrous hand loom 
just as it was in our country. So much cloth was 
required that every village had its weavers, and 
young and old throughout the countryside were en- 
gaged in spinning yarn. The pieces of goods when 
finished were slowly gathered up from the hamlets 
and drawn over the poorest roads by the most primi- 
tive conveyances to the ships to be exported. This 
method of making goods was, of course, very slow, 
and wasteful of time. The explorations of the fif- 
teenth and sixteenth centuries and the formation of 
colonies had brought about enlarged markets for 
English goods, so that hand labor could no longer 
supply the demand. So people began casting around 
for ways of improving their methods of making 
cloth. 
The first important improvement was made by 
John Kay, a weaver, who in 1733 invented a con- 
trivance called the flying shuttle, which enabled a 
weaver to drive his own shuttle back and forth. 
Previously the old hand loom had required two 
weavers; now one weaver could do the work formerly 
done by two.

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 147 
Spinning was now the great obstacle to progress. 
It was a slow process; good work was done if a 
pound’s weight of yarn was turned out by a worker 
inaday. Every woman in those days was a spinster, 
and even the children helped. Even so the supply 
of yarn was always short of the demand. It took 
ten spinners to supply one weaver, and frequently 
weavers had to spend a great deal of their time 
searching the neighborhood to get enough yarn to 
keep their looms busy. This situation led to various 
improvements in spinning. 
In 1765 James Hargreave invented a machine 
called the spinning-jenny, which by means of a wheel 
spun eight threads at once, whereas the old spinning- 
wheel had been able to spin only one.

In order for inventions to develop further two 
things were now necessary: a sufficiently strong ma- 
terial of which to make machines, and more adequate 
power to run them, While Hargreave, Arkwright,
-P-A-G-E-157
        THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 149 
and Crompton were busy making improvements in 
spinning and weaving, other inventors had been at 
work on these problems. 
Iron is invaluable for making machines because 
of its strength, malleability, and durability. It had 
been known for some time. Steel, which is a pure 
grade of iron made in a certain way, had also been 
used for centuries for weapons, armor and the like. 
But both iron and steel were scarce and expensive 
owing to the difficulty of obtaining them. Iron as 
it occurs in nature is mixed with rock, and it requires 
great heat to melt it out. Up to this time iron had 
been worked up in the crudest fashion. <A pair of 
bellows operated by hand or water power was used 
to supply the blast required to melt the metal for 
casting. Charcoal made from wood was used in the 
smelting furnace and the metal was hammered out 
by hand. The iron industry was on the decline at 
this time because of the destruction of the forests, 
which resulted in a scarcity of fuel. The demand for 
iron which sprang up when machines began to super- 
sede implements of handicraft, led to attention to 
methods of iron working. The need for fuel was 
pressing. Many unsuccessful attempts had been 
made to get a satisfactory substitute for wood as 
fuel. Coal had been known for centuries and Eng- 
lish people had discovered that underneath their soil 
was a great deal of this rock-like substance that 
would burn and give a great heat. It had not been 
extensively used, however, because of the difficulty 
of working the mines. There were a few mines, or 
pits as they were called, but the mines, if dug to any 
great depth, constantly flooded with water. Numer-    
-P-A-G-E-158
       150 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
  ous attempts had been made to keep the mines free 
from water. 
The expansive power of steam had likewise been 
known for centuries, but the knowledge had not been 
put to any wide-spread use. As early as 1714 New- 
comen, a blacksmith, had succeeded in inventing a 
pump run by steam, which would pump water out of 
the mines. It took almost as much coal to run it, 
however, as was produced by its use.

In 1740 Benjamin Huntsman succeeded in improy- 
ing methods of making steel and produced a better 
quality than any before in existence. 
The primitive method of supplying the blast by 
huge bellows was superseded in 1760 by Smeaton’s 
eylinder blowing apparatus. 
But the chief obstacle to further progress was the 
old cumbersome steam-engine used in the mines. In 
1776 James Watt set himself to improve upon New- 
comen’s engine so that it would not use up so much 
coal, and the first successful engine was constructed. 
In 1780 Watt’s engine was used for the first time to 
raise coal to the surface. It consumed coal but it 
pumped the water out of the mines and thus the
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 151 
miners were able to produce considerably more coal 
than the engine used up. Coal could now be used 
for making iron and for producing steam as power 
for machines.

When the steam-engine was adopted, a steady and 
continuous blast was secured in the iron industry 
by the use of steam as a motive force. The produc- 
tion of iron was increased enormously. Between 
the years 1766 and 1784 great improvements were 
made in changing cast iron to wrought or malleable 
form. In 1785 Henry Cort greatly improved exist-
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
ing processes by the puddling furnace and rolling 
mill. All these improvements greatly cheapened the 
production of iron and led to its application to every- 
day life. 
The new improvements in machinery were speedily 
applied to the textile industry. The inventions made 
in spinning had made it hard for the hand loom to 
weave cloth fast enough. It was now necessary that 
weaving should overtake spinning. In 1789 Dr. Cart- 
wright invented a power loom run by steam. By its 
use one weaver could attend to four or five looms at 
once, so that wool could now be woven in great quan- 
tities. The amount of cloth produced was remark- 
able compared with what had been done before the 
introduction of the power loom.

The new methods of manufacture, applied at first 
to the manufacture of wool, were found to be so 
advantageous that they spread quickly to all sorts 
of industries. By the close of the century the use of 
steam had become general, and machinery run by 
steam power had entirely superseded hand and water 
power. Mills were established everywhere for the 
manufacture of machine-made goods.
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 153 
From the Home to the Factory 
‘All these changes had a great effect upon the way 
people lived and worked. The new machines required 
an entire reorganization of industry. The change 
from hand labor to machine industry necessitated 
taking the operation out of the home. Machines 
were too costly for the cottage weavers to buy, and 
the cottage was too small to hold them. Steam power 
had to be provided to run the machines. This neces- 
sitated housing them in large buildings especially 
constructed for the purpose, and therefore the first 
factories were built. Those who were engaged in 
the mills had to leave their homes and work in the 
factories built by men with enough money to build 
and equip them. This is the beginning of the sharp 
distinction of the two classes of society: labor and 
capital. The introduction of the factory has been 
the principal cause of the rapid growth of cities. 
Workmen had to live near their work, and cities have 
developed around great manufacturing centers. 
The Development of Transportation 
The application of steam to industries enormously 
increased production. Great development in indus- 
try would, however, have been impossible if atten- 
tion had not at the same time been given to improv- 
ing methods of transportation. The mills had to be
-P-A-G-E-162
EEE 
154 HOME AND COMMUNITY LIFE 
constantly fed with raw materials, and the finished 
products hauled away. Roads at this time were few 
and very poor. Materials were often carried away 
from the mills on pack horses as the roads soon 
became useless for heavy vehicles. To make hauling 
easier two rails of wood were sometimes laid down 
and then the wheels of the carts would move more 
easily and fewer horses would be needed to draw 
them. Water transportation by means of canals was 
at this time more rapid, and a great many canals 
were constructed., One horse could draw over a good 
road one ton of goods at the rate of two miles an 
hour; the same horse could draw thirty tons on a 
canal. However there was strong demand for more 
and better roads, and in 1802 Telford and Macadam, 
two engineers, made many improvements in road 
beds and in draining roads. 
The Coming of the Railroad.—Neither roads nor 
canals were adequate. So long as the horse remained 
the means of pulling the load, neither the load nor 
the speed could be increased beyond a certain point. 
Lack of transportation facilities were now a serious 
obstacle to further progress. Goods must be dis- 
tributed more rapidly. The need for some new means 
of transportation was clear to everyone. The first 
improvements took place in connection with mining. 
In the course of time mine owners asked themselves 
why a steam-engine which could pump water out of 
mines could not be made to draw carts over a little 
track. The honor of first applying steam to hauling 
loads belongs to Richard Trevisthick, who in 1804 
built the first engine that would run. In 1813 George 
Stephenson improved upon the work of Trevisthick,
-P-A-G-E-163

constructing an engine which drew trucks of coal 
from the coal mines to a canal.

was opened.

  CHANGES IN AMERICAN LIFE SINCE 1800 
The Establishment of the Factory 
By the close of the American Revolution the fac- 
tory system had already become established in Eng- 
land. Our forefathers very naturally wished to 
follow conditions in England, but this .was very diffi- 
cult. England sought by every means to retain to 
herself the benefits of the great spinning and weav- 
ing inventions, and to prevent the introduction of 
machines into this country. England at this time 
held the key to the industrial world just opening up; 
without machinery no one could compete with her. 
The English parliament therefore passed laws for- 
bidding the export of machines, or models, or plans 
of machines. 
The great question in America at this time was 
how to secure machinery like that in use in England. 
Rhode Island was the first state to erect a factory 
equipped with machines like the English models. It 
was built by Samuel Slater, an Englishman, at Paw- 
tucket, in 1790. When Slater was fourteen years of 
age he was bound out as an apprentice to a partner 
of Sir Richard Arkwright in England. Accidentally 
seeing a notice in an American paper of the efforts 
that were being made to establish factories, he deter- 
mined to come to this country. He knew that he 
could carry no plans or models of machines with him, 
159

so he remained in England until he knew every part 
of the business so thoroughly that he could construct 
machines from memory, and thus bring his knowl- 
edge over in his head. He landed in America in 
November, 1789, and in January, 1790, he be- 
gan building machinery like the English machines, 
mostly by hand. On the twentieth of December, 1790, 
he started the first factory in America.

Up to this time most cloth in America was made 
of wool; there was very little cotton manufactured. 
The reason for this was the difficulty of separating 
the cotton from the seeds. A great deal of cotton 
grew in the south, but it took an old colored woman 
nearly a whole day to clean a pound of cotton, while 
the best workers could prepare only five or six 
pounds a day. Eli Whitney, a young Yankee who 
was down south studying law, realized the difficulties

with which the planters had to deal, and having a 
gift for mechanics, set to work to make a cotton- 
cleaner. In 1792 his gin (short for engine) was 
perfected. By its use one man could clean upwards 
of a thousand pounds of cotton a day. After the 
invention of the cotton-gin, cotton production in- 
creased by leaps and bounds in this country, spin- 
ning and weaving were greatly stimulated, and cot- 
ton goods became a popular commodity.

The factory, however, needed perfecting. Origi- 
nally the processes of cleaning the fiber and spinning 
it into yarn were carried on in one set of works, while 
the weaving was still done in the homes in the neigh- 
borhood or in another establishment. Although the 
power loom had been invented in 1785, it did not 
come into general use in this country until after the 
War of 1812. 
In 1811 Francis Lowell of Boston visited England 
and spent much time inspecting factories with a view 
to improving machinery in the United States. His 
visit was about the time that the power loom was 
coming into general use in England. Mr. Lowell 
returned to America, and in 1814 set up a factory 
in which were machines for spinning and also for 
weaving. This factory was the first in the world in 
which all the processes necessary to the manufacture 
of goods from the raw material to the finished prod- 
uct were united under one roof.
-P-A-G-E-171
  CHANGES IN AMERICAN LIFE 163 
The Invention of the Sewing Machine.—Although 
the processes of making cloth were now done entirely 
by machines in factories, the sewing of the clothing 
was still done entirely by hand. This was a slow 
and expensive process. Many attempts were made 
to invent a machine that would do stitching. The 
first successful machine was constructed by Elias 
Howe, in 1844. This invention was of immense im- 
portance to the textile industry. Machines, at first 
used in homes, were soon introduced into factories 
and operated by power. Many improvements were 
made in Howe’s machine so that all the complicated 
processes of sewing—hemming, gathering, braiding, 
ete., could all be done by machines. Thus the making 
of clothes was converted from a domestic to a factory 
industry. The use of machinery reduced time and 
labor, and thus the cost of clothing. This is the 
beginning of the ready-made clothing business. 
Thus while England furnished the foundation of 
the factory system, America completed the process.

The Development of Transportation 
In 1800 the greater part of America was a great 
trackless wilderness, except for the trails made by 
animals or Indians. Road-making was difficult, and 
the cost of wagon transportation heavy. The rivers 
were the great natural highways to the west, and 
water routes were used wherever possible. Unfor- 
tunately many parts of the country were not touched 
by natural water-ways. At this time England was 
building canals, and this country naturally followed 
her example. In 1825 the Hrie Canal was built, 
uniting the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. This 
greatly reduced freight rates and was followed by 
a fury of canal building.

Many inventors were working on the problem of 
applying the steam-engine to boats. Fitch began 
experimenting in 1785, and in the summer of the 
next year made a trial trip on the Delaware at the 
speed of eight miles an hour. This demonstrated 
the possibility of steam navigation. Other men were 
working, but defects in engines, size of paddle- 
wheels, and other details prevented these first at- 
tempts from being commercially profitable.

The first man to make the steamboat a practical 
success was Robert Fulton. In 1807 the Clermont 
was launched and made the trip from New York to 
Albany in thirty-two hours. From that time steam- 
boats came into general use for inland navigation.

Although steamboats were now used extensively 
for inland navigation, the great majority of our 
ocean ships were fast sailing vessels, the famous 
Yankee clippers. England with strongly developed 
iron and coal industries began building iron ships, 
but our builders with so much timber in this country 
still clung to the wooden ship. The American ship 
required only two-thirds the number in the crew of 
the English ship, crossed the ocean three times while 
the English ship crossed twice, was cheaper to build 
and cheaper to run. The English ship was eventually 
improved, however, and in time surpassed the 
American wooden ship. Iron ships were found to 
be more durable than wooden, and could be made 
to carry a much larger cargo. The Cunard Line was 
established in 1839 and subsidized by the British 
government. It was at this time that England gained 
the supremacy in the shipping world, and the Ameri- 
can merchant marine declined. With the use of iron 
ships, articles could be carried to the farthest parts 
of the world in ever-increasing quantities.

The use of power-driven machinery could not

iron was smelted with charcoal just as it had been 
in England. The presence of coal in America had 
long been known, but the difficulty of transportation 
had prevented its general use. In 1825 the first suc- 
cessful attempt was made to generate steam with 
coal. In 1837 the first furnace for smelting iron with 
coal was built. Real development in the iron industry 
took place after this.

The Growth of Railroads.—As the population of 
the United States began to push westward, the need 
for transportation facilities increased. The water- 
ways were found to be inadequate. After the prac- 
ticability of the locomotive was demonstrated in 
England, English locomotives were introduced into 
this country, but were found to be unsuitable for 
conditions here. American engineers soon began to 
build locomotives. The first railroad in America was 
the Baltimore and Ohio, built in 1835. The earliest 
railroads were short lines, built to connect water- 
ways. The rails were wooden beams with straps of 
iron nailed to the upper surface. The introduction 
of the iron rail permitted a heavier load and greater 
speed.

Up to this time steel was very little used in the 
construction of railroads or in other industries be- 
cause it was so expensive. By 1850 the need for 
cheap steel was acute. Shortly after this Sir Henry 
Bessemer, an Englishman, invented a process of 
making steel by blowing air through the molten 
metal in an especially constructed vessel called a 
converter. The steel business now increased by leaps 
and bounds. The world of industry entered what 
might be called the age of steel.

It was impossible to span deep rivers and ravines.

construction now proceeded with great vigor. Com- 
panies were formed and capital invested. Steel rails 
were substituted for iron, and great improvements 
made in tracks and road-beds. Instead of light 
wooden coaches, long steel coaches were built, and 
larger and more powerful locomotives capable of 
hauling many thousands of tons. Later develop- 
ments in railroad construction were in the nature 
of improving the speed, safety, and comfort of the 
lines. Important contributions in these connections 
were made by Westinghouse and Pullman.

The ‘Automobile.—The automobile is one of the 
latest and most important agencies of transporta- 
tion. Although steam-engines had been in use for 
over a hundred years, prior to 1885 there was no 
practical vehicle for general use run by power. 
Various obstacles had to be overcome, and one of 
the biggest problems was that of finding suitable 
power. Steam was found to be impractical. In 1885 
Gottlieb Daimler produced the first practical gaso- 
line motor. Then began a series of improvements 
embracing every part of the vehicle. ‘A multiplicity 
of devices has made the automobile cheap and strong, 
so that we now have motor vehicles of every kind.

The Development of Means of Communication 
The Coming of Electricity—Before 1800 com- 
paratively little was known about electricity and 
magnetism. But while steam-engines were being 
developed other scientists were working with this 
great natural force. 
Forerunners of the Telegraph.—Franklin had 
made many experiments with electricity for his own 
amusement. To him is due the first practical ap- 
plication of electricity in the lightning rod.

can not run faster than sixty or seventy miles an 
hour. Electricity travels thousands of miles a second. 
As soon as it became known that electricity trans- 
mitted its effects through conductors, it was sug- 
gested that this method be used for transmitting 
signals beween distant points. This is the genesis 
of the modern telegraph. 
When Wires First Talked.—In 1837 the first re- 
cording telegraph was perfected by S. F. B. Morse. 
The telegraph developed along the lines of the rail- 
roads, and proved very valuable in insuring the 
safety of the roads. The first long distance telegraph 
was from Washington to Baltimore in 1844. The 
telegraph was also found very valuable to the devel- 
opment of business. It spread rapidly, and today 
over the whole world is a net-work of wires.

Other Applications of Electricity 
Since 1837 there has been an almost continuous 
record of progress in the development of electricity. 
It may be transmitted to great distances; it can be 
produced cheaply and in quantity. This has led to 
its application in many phases of industry. 
The Use of Electricity for Illumination—The first 
application was the arc light in 1879. This was suited 
to street illumination, but not for houses. In 1880 
Edison invented the incandescent lamp used for

lever. The first printing press in this country was 
established at Cambridge in 1639. The first news- 
paper was printed in Boston in 1690. ‘At the time 
of the Revolution there were only 37 newspapers in 
this country. These were small sheets with an aver- 
age circulation of about three hundred copies. 
Richard Hoe invented the cylinder press in 1847. 
After 1850 the old hand press was superseded by 
the rapid rotary machine operated by steam. The 
manufacture of wood pulp began about 1854. After

the cast-iron plow into general use in 1825 marked 
an epoch in agriculture and led to other im- 
provements in farm implements. After 1830 farm 
machinery of all kinds was rapidly introduced. The 
invention which had the greatest effect upon agricul- 
ture was that of the reaping machine by Cyrus Mc- 
Cormick in 1834. These machines enabled one man 
with a team of horses to cut as much grain as twenty 
men could cut by hand. Other improvements fol- 
lowed, and agricultural progress was rapid in the 
nineteenth century.

Money and Banking 
_ As the population of the colonies grew and busi- 
ness interests multiplied, the need for money steadily 
increased. There could be no real industrial devel- 
opment without an adequate supply of money. The 
attention of Congress was early called to the neces- 
sity of providing a medium of exchange that should 
have stable and uniform value. Hamilton, the finan- 
cier of Washington’s cabinet, established a coinage 
system in 1792. Banks were established, and the 
eredit system established to finance enterprises.

The Development of Methods of Merchandising 
In the developments of the last century organizing 
ability was naturally first centered upon methods of 
production. Improvements in production and de- 
crease of costs make for increased sales, and selling 
was at first a simple matter and took care of itself. 
But as the amount of goods produced increased, 
methods of merchandising had to be improved to 
take care of this increase in output. The department 
store is the modern solution of the problem. In 1876 
John Wanamaker opened the first department store 
in America, with each department organized under 
a buyer as head. This was the beginning of the 
various modern distributing systems, of which the 
mail order house and the chain store are other 
phases.

The Growth of Cities 
The industrial revolution has had a tremendous 
effect upon the growth of cities. With the coming 
of the railroads old towns increased enormously in 
population and many new ones sprang up. In many 
cases these towns grew so rapidly that sanitary con- 
ditions became very bad. This brought about the 
necessity for the organization of many departments 
of municipal government to safeguard the life and 
property of the citizens.

windows of his house. About 1850 lamp-posts were 
placed in the more important thoroughfares. After 
the discovery of oil in Pennsylvania, oil lamps were 
used. Later came gas, and in 1880 electric lights.

social equality, existed long before it was recognized 
and employed as a guiding principle in institutions 
and laws. The people came to America in order to 
live and believe as they wished. They were most 
of ‘them from approximately the same class of 
society. The conditions of life in America fostered 
the feeling of equality and personal liberty. In life 
in the wilderness personal qualifications rather than 
social status were what counted. The frontier type 
of life, which has been characteristic of America up 
to a comparatively recent time, tended to develop 
a hardy independent race of people engaged in a 
struggle with a beneficent nature which yielded re- 
ward to honest labor. All of this made for the 
development of the feeling of liberty, independence, 
and self-reliance. These conditions deeply influenced 
the political ideas of the early settlers.

Summary 
Without the inventions and improvements made 
within the last hundred years we should still be 
living the life of the pioneer. Large scale produc- 
tion and the improvements made in methods of 
transportation and distribution have enormously 
increased our supply of material things at low cost. 
These marvellous inventions have radically altered 
the daily life of the people and their ways of making 
a living. They serve to explain the world in which 
we live with its busy cities and its gigantic factories. 
It has created work for many new classes of workers 
—inventors, scientists, merchants, manufacturers, 
business men, and the mighty army of day laborers 
and office workers who make the wheels of industry 
go round. Increase in business has made for greater 
and greater specialization. The business world of 
today consists of a great network of interdependent 
industries, organized to produce great quantities of 
goods at the lowest possible price. 
Labor and Capital—With the numerous inven- 
tions the way was opened to the development of the 
great industries of the country, and the industrial 
expansion of recent years has been steady and rapid. 
The factory system furnished a profitable field for 
the investment of capital, and there has been a ten- 
dency of capital to be invested in greater and greater 
amounts. This situation has led to various indus- 
trial combinations. Today the investment of capital
-P-A-G-E-203
CHANGES IN AMERICAN LIFE 195 
in business enterprises has reached vast proportions. 
Huge corporations are capitalized at many millions 
of dollars. Although there is a greater distribution 
of wealth among the masses than at any other period 
of the world’s history, the power of wealth has be- 
come concentrated in the hands of a comparatively 
few people. This is the time of the great captains 
of industry. There is on the other hand the great 
increase in the number of people working for wages, 
and the sharp distinction between two classes in 
society—labor and capital. This situation has 
created the crucial problem of modern life—the 
struggle for the equitable division of the wealth 
created by the industrial revolution.

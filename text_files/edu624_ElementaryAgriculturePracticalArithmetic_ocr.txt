PREFACE 
As the population of our country increases, it is 
fast becoming evident that two things must be done: 
poorer soil must be cultivated, and what is already 
under cultivation must be made to produce more. In 
either case more thoughtful methods in agriculture are 
absolutely essential. The farmer of to-morrow, who 
is to-day the farmer’s boy, must know how to farm 
better than his father does. In order to do this, he 
must acquire a more or less complete knowledge of 
the sciences on which agriculture is based. 
The farmer of the future must be able to read farm 
papers understandingly, or better still, he should be 
trained for his life work in some agricultural school 
as doctors, lawyers and teachers are now trained. It 
is the purpose of this book to give to the farmer’s 
child, who studies it, a start in such necessary knowl- 
edge. The language used is plain and simple, and 
may be readily understood by any bright boy or girl 
of twelve years of age. All scientific terms are defined 
in a simple way whenever it has been necessary to 
introduce them. 
Each chapter is followed by a set of practical farm 
problems to be used as exercises for the arithmetic 
class. These problems have a definite relation to the
-P-A-G-E-8
subject matter which they follow, as well as a close 
relation to farm life. Wherever appropriate at the 
close of a chapter some experimental studies are 
added. It is believed that the working out of these ex- 
ercises will enable the farmer’s children to solve ordi- 
nary practical problems arising on the farm, and pre- 
pare for the more complex ones of experimental agri- 
culture. 
It is hoped that the careful study of this book will 
lead to a deeper interest in farm life, and to a more 
careful and systematic study of the soils, crops, feeds, 
fertilizers, and the like, by the children in the rural 
schools and perhaps, incidentally, by the farmers 
themselves. 
It is a wholesome indication of the trend of educa- 
tional thought, that the legislatures of several states 
have made compulsory the study of agriculture in the 
district schools. 
We trust that this little book, by combitting the 
subjects of arithmetic and agriculture, will be of 
material assistance to teachers in their efforts to do 
effective work in both branches.

CHAPTER I 
THE GROWTH OF PLANTS 
What Makes Plants Grow.—If{ you were asked, 
“What makes a pig grow?” you would reply, “Milk, 
grass, corn, etc.,” but if you were asked, ‘“‘What makes 
a plant grow?’ would you answer so readily, “The 
food which it consumes?” But this is precisely what 
you should reply. Plants, like animals, must have 
food and drink, and like animals, they perish without 
them. At some later time, we shall tell you what 
these foods are, in such a way that you will readily 
recognize them at sight. Kor the present, however, 
we shall observe the way in which plants grow and 
find out, if possible, the source from which they get 
their first food. 
The little pig, or lamb, or calf lives and grows upon 
the milk of its mother until it is large enough to 
search for its own food. It then begins to use the 
same food as the larger animals of its kind. Now, 
from what source does the little plant get its first 
food?
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
How Plants Store Food.—If{ you will carefully 
remove the skin from a bean that has been soaked 
over night, and then separate it into two parts, you 
will discover two tiny leaves near one end, between 
the two halves of the bean. Extending in the oppo- 
site direction is a tiny stem and root. This little plant 
is called the germ or embryo, and it is this germ which

C—Cotyledon. 
later develops into a full grown plant. The two halves 
of the bean serve as a storehouse for food, and are 
called cotyledons. Ifa kernel of corn is taken instead, 
and examined in the same way, the same kind of little 
plant will be found. Instead of two leaves pointing 
upward, as in the bean, but one will be found in the 
corn. The peanut will be found to resemble the bean 
in this respect; wheat and rye resemble the corn.
-P-A-G-E-11
  WHY PLANTS GROW II 
Classification of Plants ——In the spring, as soon as 
the young plants begin to come up, go out into the 
garden and field and notice how many leaves are first 
seen from the seed. In one list write the names of all 
plants showing but a single leaf or sprout, and name 
that list monocotyledons. In another list write the 
names of all plants showing a pair of first leaves and 
call these plants dicotyledons, and you will have begun 
the systematic study of botany. If you are interested, 
you will not wait for spring, but will want to begin 
now, which you may do by planting all kinds of seeds 
grown on the farm in sawdust in an old pan kept 
in a light, warm place. You can ‘hen examine these 
seeds from day to day and watch their growth. 
Gernunation.—lIf you keep these seeds wet they will 
grow well for a few days, and then they will wither 
and die. Now, why is this? Because the little plant- 
let lives on the food contained in the seed until this 
food is all used up, and the plant has attained sufficient 
size and strength to get its food from the soil. But it 
cannot get stifficient food from the sawdust, and of 
course it starves to death, just as a little pig would 
starve if it were not given sufficient food. 
Why Plants Store Up Food.—When asked why 
plants store up so much food matter in seeds we 
usually answer, “To furnish food for animals and 
men.” Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Nature intended this food matter, not for man, but 
for the little plantlets, found in the seeds, to use for 
their own growth until they are large enough to get it 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
for themselves directly from the soil. Make this 
experiment: Irom soaked beans or kernels of corn, 
cut away about two-thirds of this food matter, being 
very careful not to injure the 
ma } pS embryos, and watch the 
YI Dwi sprouting of what remai me prouting what’ remains. 
y | These sprouts will wither 
and die much sooner than 
those from perfect seeds, be- 
cause not enough nourish- 
ment is left to supply them 
with food until: they are 
large enough to get it from 
the soil. This should teach 
us that we cannot be too

the growth of the plant. The if we wish strong, healthy same results will be obtained 
by using small and large plants and, consequently, seeds. Try it. good crops. 
Every farmer’s child must have noticed how pota- 
toes shrivel up when they sprout in the cellar. This 
is due to the fact that the young sprout uses up a 
part of the potato as food for its own growth. 
Necessity of Motsture, Heat, Air, and Light.—But 
there are other things necessary for the growth of 
plants. Grain rarely grows in the bin or stack, and 
if it does, you will say that it is because the grain 
is too wet. Moisture, then, is another requisite for 
plant growth. But even wet grain fails to grow in 
the winter time because heat is necessary. Neither Ny

. 
will crops grow in ground covered with water, because 
all growing plants must have air, and much water 
keeps the air out of the soil. There is still another 
requisite to plant growth, and that is light. No plant 
grows well in dense shade, and without sunlight plants 
always have a yellow and sickly appearance. 
Summary.—Good seeds and proper conditions of 
soil, moisture, air, heat and light are essential to plant 
growth, and a part of the study of agriculture consists 
in determining just how to control these conditions. 
“What?” you ask, “Can the farmer control the amount 
of heat, air and moisture in the soil?” He can, and 
it is the purpose of this little book to teach the farmer’s 
children how it may be done. 
A good bulletin on the subject treated in this chapter may be 
had free on application to the Secretary of Agriculture, Wash- 
ington, D. C., or to your Senator or Representative in Congress.

I. Place a folded newspaper in the bottom of a 
cigar box, a crayon box, or on a plate; moisten with 
water, and place another folded newspaper over the 
first one. Between the papers place one hundred of 
the seeds to be tested, and set aside in a warm place 
for a few days. Keep the paper moist but not wet. 
At the end of a week the number of sprouted seeds 
represents the percentage of good seeds. 
2. Select ten very small seeds and an equal num- 
ber of very large seeds of the same kind, and plant

them at equal distances in parallel rows in the same 
box. Note which make the most rapid and vigorous 
erowth during the first week; the second week; the 
third week. 
3. Select seeds from a supply that has been pre- 
viously tested and found to be good. Place a dozen 
of these seeds on paper in each of three dishes. Cover 
the seeds in the first dish with water and keep them 
completely covered. In the second dish keep the seeds 
half covered with water. In the third dish keep the 
paper on which the seeds are placed always moist, but 
do not allow water to stand around the seeds. Which 
seeds germinate most rapidly? Why? What finally 
happens to the seeds immersed in water? Explain. 
4. Plant some seeds in moist soil and others in 
the same kind of soil kept very wet. Note the dif- 
ference in germination and growth. Explain. 
5. Start some beans growing well in each of two 
boxes side by side on the window sill; then cover one 
lot with another box or a paper cone. At the end of . 
a week remove the cover and note the effect that 
absence of light has had on the growth and appearance 
of the plants. 
6. Provide for the growth of seedlings against 
glass. This may be done by planting seeds in a glass 
jar, a tumbler, or even in an old crayon box set on 
end, the other end removed, and a piece of glass put 
in the place of the cover. By pressing the seeds close 
against the glass their germination and growth can 
be easily observed from day to day.

To the Teacher: The above list of problems is intended to 
suggest others. Ask the pupils to find the current prices of corn, 
oats, barley, hay, etc. What is considered a good crop per acre 
of each of these? Then estimate the cost of labor. Have 
them furnish all the necessary data. This they can get from 
home. Make up a list of problems similar to the above from 
data furnished by the pupils. Let one pupil furnish data for one 
set of problems, another pupil furnish data for another set, and 
so on. Pass the honors around. You should have both parents 
and pupils interested before you have progressed far with this 
work. Observe this policy throughout the course of instruction 
in this branch. It will be observed that there is a logical order 
in arrangement of the problems; in many cases the conditions 
necessary for the solution of a problem are found in one preced- 
ing it.
-P-A-G-E-18
  CHAPTER II 
THE PLANT AND WATER 
Kinds of Plant Foods.——We have already seen that 
the seed furnishes the food for the little plantlet until 
it is large enough to get food from the soil, in much 
the same way that the mother cow furnishes milk for 
her calf until the calf is large enough to find its own 
food. If asked, “What are the foods which a cow 
eats?” you would probably answer, “Grass, hay, straw, 
oats, bran, etc.”’ Not many of us could answer 
so readily if asked to give a list of plant foods. There 
are but a dozen of them, and half of these are nearly 
as well known to you as cattle foods. The most 
familiar are: water, lime, iron oxide,* soda,} ammonia, 
and sand.t ‘The other six are: magnesia, potash, car- 
bon dioxide, and three acids, viz.: phosphoric, hydro- © 
chloric, and sulphuric. 
Plants and Water.—Now let us consider these plant 
foods. Every one knows that plants cannot live with- 
out water, but few persons stop to think of the enor- 
mous amount of water consumed daily by an acre of 
growing vegetation. You may make this experiment: 
Put exactly the same amount of water in each of two

-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE PLANT AND THE WATER 19 
similar vessels—tumblers, glass fruit-jars or even old 
tin cans will answer. Pull up a thrifty bunch of clover 
and put its roots into one of these vessels of water. 
Stand both on a table or shelf side by side. Ina few 
days you will notice that the water in the vessel 
containing the clover is disappearing much more rap- 
idly than that in the other vessel. As soon as the 
clover begins to wilt take it out of the water and by. 
  Relative amounts. of Relative amounts” of 
water at the beginning of water at the end of the 
the experiment. experiment. 
measuring compare what remains in the two vessels. 
Of course, both have lost by evaporation—that is, both 
have “dried up,” as we say—but, if the vessels are of 
the same size, there should be equal evaporation. 
Why, then, should not the remainders be equal? Be- 
cause the clover plant has been using up water. The 
difference between what remains in the two cans repre- 
sents the amount used by the clover plant. 
How Plants Use Water.—Plants make use of water 
in two ways. In the first place, they use it as food 
just the same as animals do. In the second place, a 
plant cannot eat solid food. It has neither mouth nor 
teeth and it must take in its food in liquid form
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
through its roots. The solid foods mentioned above 
dissolve in water—just as sugar dissolves in coffee— 
and in this dissolved condition they are easily taken in 
by the roots of the plant. Substances such as salt, 
that dissolve ins water, are said to be soluble, and the 
plant fluid containing these dissolved substances is 
called sap. The solid food, with a portion of the 
water, is taken from the sap to be used in plant growth, 
and the remaining water is passed off to the air 
through little holes in the leaves. This is the reason 
why plants need so much water. Grain uses up 
hundreds of tons of water per acre during the growing 
season. 
Moisture Can Be Regulated.—But you ask: “Can 
the farmer regulate the amount of moisture in the 
soil? Does not that depend wholly upon rainfall?” 
No, it does not depend upon rainfall. If the ground 
is too wet, the farmer can drain it by ditching or tiling, 
and by careful cultivation he can keep the moisture 
in the soil in times of drought. Just how this is done 
is left for later discussion. 
Experimental Study of Water in Plants. 
1. Place a clean, dry glass vessel over a growing 
plant. A. fruit-jar or a tumbler will do. In a few 
hours what appears on the inner surface of the glass? 
Where does this moisture come from? How can you 
show that it does not come from the soil? 
2. Place a thrifty clover plant in a clean, dry glass 
jar and seal it tight. In a few hours what appears on

observe. 
3. Place some cut flowers that have begun to 
wither in a vessel containing cold water, immersing 
all except the blossoms. ° Set in a cool place for several 
hours. What change occurred? Explain.

Table showing proportions of water in farm crops. 
One bushel of root crops contains about 55 pounds of water. 
One bushel of potatoes contains about 45 pounds of water. 
One bushel of corn (dry, shelled) contains about 5 pounds of 
water. 
One bushel of wheat contains about 6 pounds of water. 
One bushel of oats contains about 3 pounds of water. 
One ton of dry hay contains about 300 pounds of water. 
One ton of green feed contains from 1,500 to 1,800 pounds of 
water. 
NoTtE: This represents only the water left in the plants and 
seeds as a part of them. By far the greater amount used by the 
plant passes off to the air through the pores in the leaves.

CHAPTER III 
PLANT FOODS 
Lime.—Lime is known to every child. It is known, 
too, that lime will dissolve slowly in water, and thus 
become available for plant food. Large quantities of 
lime are found in the soil. Of course, it comes from 
the lime rock. 
Soda.—Soda, or saleratus, as it is sometimes called, 
is also easily dissolved in water. Soda is made from 
common salt and the plants get it from the soil. 
*[ron Oxide.—Ilron oxide gives the red or yellow 
color to rocks and soils. It dissolves in water, especially 
after a little acid is added. 
The Use of Acids——But what is an acid? The 
commonest kind of acid; without which no farmer’s 
wife could well get along, is vinegar. Acids are 
usually sour in taste, and their presence in the soil as- 
‘sists water in dissolving rock. A copper penny can be 
made bright, or an old brass ring to look like gold, 
by rubbing it with a little vinegar. This is because 
the acid dissolves off the tarnish and leaves the clean 
surface exposed. Some of the plant foods dissolve 
much more readily in water to which a little acid has 
been added. Soda is a good example. Put a tea- 
* |ron-rust,
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
spoonful of it in a cup about one-fourth full of water 
without stirring. Add a little vinegar and notice what 
takes place. The soda disappears because the acid 
acts on it. Gas is given off very rapidly, causing it 
to bubble and “foam.” This gas is carbon dioxide, 
one of the four acids named in the last chapter. These 
acids help the water to dissolve the plant foods in the 
soil and are themselves taken in as plant foods. 
*Szilica.—Silica needs no discussion. By some it is 
believed to be the food that gives stiffness to the stalks 
of barley, oats and other grains, which, when grown 
on rich bottom land, usually “lodge” partly because 
they are unable to get sufficient sand from the soil. 
Ammonia.—Ammonia is known by its odor. It is 
used for cleaning clothing and windows. If you go 
into the barn on a warm morning when the barn has 
been closed during the night you will get a strong 
odor of ammonia from the horse manure. Ammonia 
is always given off to the air when animal matter 
decays. It contains the element, nitrogen, so essential 
to plant growth. 
Carbon Dioxide.—Carbon dioxide is a plant food 
ind it is also found in the air. You will remember it as 
the gas that came off when you put vinegar on soda. 
This gas is always given off to the air when vegetable 
matter burns or decays. You are throwing it off from 
your lungs with every breath that you breathe. So, 
too, are all animals. ‘Here is a simple test for it that 
any child can easily make. Put a piece of fresh lime in 
some water, shake well and let it stand until it settles 
* Sand.

and the water is perfectly clear. Pour off this clear 
liquid into another bottle. This clear liquid is lime 
water. Some of the lime has been dissolved. Taste 
it to satisfy yourself. Now pour some of the lime 
water into a tumbler and with a straw blow bubbles 
through it. It gets milky because of the carbon 
dioxide in your lungs. Now mix up some more “soda 
water” and add vinegar. Carefully tip the tumbler so 
that the gas can run into the lime water. It is heavier 
than air and will run over the edge of the tumbler 
like water. Shake the lime water. It is milky again. 
This shows that the gas given off by the soda water 
when vinegar is added is the same as the gas given off 
by your lungs. Make one more experiment: 
Place a little lime water in a saucer and set this on 
the floor in your sleeping room over night. In the 
morning it, too, will be found to be milky. This shows 
the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. 
Magnesia.—Magnesia is known to most of us. It is 
the white powder used to whiten the skin and prevent 
soreness from the wind. 
Potash.—Potash is found in wood ashes and gives 
to lye, made therefrom, its soapy feel. 
Sources of Plant Foods.—The water, soil and air 
are the sources of plant foods. The-air contains two 
—ammonia and carbon dioxide—soil and water the 
other nine. All of these foods except carbon dioxide 
dissolve in water and enter the plant by its roots. 
Carbon dioxide is taken in directly from’the air by the 
plant through the little holes in the leaves.
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 . ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Plant Starvation.—Now, if these foods are not 
found in sufficient quantity in the soil, the plant grows 
slowly and finally dies. Again, the soil may contain 
plenty of plant food, but it may not be in a form read- 
ily soluble by the water, and the plant suffers from a 
lack of food, just as one may starve within ten feet of 
plenty of food that is securely locked up so that he can 
not get at it. One problem which the farmer is called 
upon to solve is, how to make the soil of his farm 
more easily soluble. 
Effect of Too Much Food.—Plants may be killed 
by too much food. Who has not seen spots of grass 
killed out where the cattle have been salted or have 
dropped manure? This is because the plants have 
taken in too much solid food. Plants can live on so 
small an amount as one part of solid food dissolved in 
a million parts of water, and more than one part ina 
thousand kills them. One way to kill noxious weeds 
is to cover them with salt, lime, or ashes, so that they 
will get more than one part of this food in every thou- 
sand parts of water that they use. 
Soil Exhaustion——From what. we have learned it 
is clear that, if the farmer raises grain on his farm to 
sell, and never returns manure to the soil, he will rob 
it of its plant food, and it will soon begin to show 
evidence of being “worn out.” Plant foods are being 
continually used up by the growing plants, and re- 
moved with them, and none are returned to take their 
place. The heavier the crop the greater will be the
-P-A-G-E-27
PLANT FOODS 27 
loss. ‘Tobacco and root crops, being so much heavier, 
exhaust the soil faster than small grains. 
But worn-out soil does not mean soil in which all 
the different kinds of plant foods are used up. In 
fact, soil usually contains all plant foods in inexhaust- 
ible quantities with but three exceptions, namely: 
potash, phosphoric acid and the nitrogen found in 
ammonia. To restore the fertility of the soil means 
only to restore these three substances. The general 
rule for fertilizing soils will be taken up later. 
Experimental Study of Plant Foods. 
I. Make a collection of the following plant foods: 
Lime, iron-rust, soda, ammonia, magnesia, acid, sul- 
phur, and sand. Place each specimen in a small bottle 
and label properly. 
2. Potash may be easily prepared from wood 
ashes. Place about two quarts of wood ashes in a pan, 
cover with water, and let stand for a few hours, stir- 
ring frequently. Then allow the ashes to settle and 
pour off the clear liquid into another tin dish. Place 
this lye on the stove and evaporate all the water. The 
dry powder found on the bottom of the dish is potash. 
A little potash dissolved in water makes it feel soapy. 
This “‘soapy feel” is the test for potash. Put some of 
the potash in a small bottle, label, and add to the 
collection. 
3. It is very difficult to obtain uncombined phos- 
phoric acid. The easiest way to procure it is in com- 
bination with lime. Burn a bone to whiteness, crumble 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
it up, and put it into a bottle. This powder is a com- 
bination of lime and phosphoric acid. Now, if a little 
water is poured over this powder and a small quantity 
of sulphuric acid added, the lime will soon settle and 
the clear liquid will be phosphoric acid. 
4. To prepare nitrogen, provide a glass bottle 
with a large neck, a piece of wire, a bit of cotton, 
a little alcohol, and a shallow dish containing lime 
water to the depth of two inches. Twist one end of 
the wire around a small piece of cotton, and then bend 
it nearly double about three inches from the end bear- 
ing the cotton. Dip the cotton in alcohol and light it. 
Resting the wire loop on the bottom of the dish with 
the torch standing upright, place the inverted empty 
bottle over the torch so that the bottle rests on the 
bottom of the dish and the bend in the wire. Soon 
the flame dies out because the fire uses up the oxygen 
in the bottle. The oxygen has united with the carbon 
of the alcohol, forming carbon dioxide. Without 
taking the mouth of the bottle from the water, remove 
the torch, put one hand under the mouth of the bottle 
to close it tight, invert the bottle quickly, and shake. 
The lime water becomes milky, showing that the car- 
bonic acid gas has been taken up by it. The colorless, 
odorless, invisible gas now remaining in the bottle is 
nitrogen. 
Plunge a lighted taper or splinter into the gas and 
the flame is immediately extinguished, showing that 
the gas is not air.

CHAPTER IV 
SOIL 
How Soils Are Made.—A good deal has been said 
about soils, and it may interest you to discuss how soils 
are.made. The soil in Wisconsin, and most of the 
northern states, contains much hard gravel mixed with 
fine soil. This “drift,’’ as it is called, varies in depth 
from a few inches to hundreds of feet. Underneath 
this drift is solid rock. Any “well-driller’” will tell 
you this. He can also tell you how far he has had to 
geo down into the earth, before striking rock, in the dif- 
ferent wells that he has drilled. Further he will tell 
you that this rock does not resemble the stone or 
gravel above it. Where, then, did this drift come 
from? 
Glacial Drift and Rock Decay.—Many years ago, 
before man made his appearance on the earth, a great 
mass of ice and snow, called a glacier, moved down 
from the polar regions, scraping up the loose earth, 
rocks, and stones as it passed slowly along, crushing 
and grinding them together, wearing off hilltops, fill- 
ing up valleys and depositing the gravelly material 
from which this soil, wherein the farmer now sows his 
seed, is made. The reason why the stones that may
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
now be picked up are so hard is that only the hard ones 
could withstand the grinding. ‘The softer ones were 
ground up and helped to form soil. In the western part 
of the state of Wisconsin,in eastern Iowa, and in north- 
ern Illinois is a tract known as the “driftless area,’ over 
which the glacier did not pass. Here the soil may be 
seen in the actual process of formation. The rock on top 
gradually “rots” and breaks up. The water washes the 
  Drawing, showing how rock Drawing, showing glacial 
gradually breaks up and de- drift deposited on top of the 
cays from the top downward. solid rock. 
lighter portions down and spreads them out at lower 
levels.. The rain and snow work their way into the 
cracks of the rocks and, freezing there, break them up 
into smaller pieces. Even the wind breaks off small 
pieces and carries them away. Great drifts of sand, 
like snow, may sometimes be seen piled up by the 
action of the wind. Plants die and decay, and thus 
help to build up the soil. Roots of trees sometimes 
work their way into crevices of the rock and, growing 
there, split off great pieces. Roots also secrete a kind 
of acid that helps to dissolve the rock. The gases in 
the air help in breaking up the rock, thus forming: soil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  SOIL 33 
Animals, too, like the gopher and woodchuck, burrow 
into the earth and help to tear up and break down 
the rock. When they die their bodies decay and be- 
come a part of the soil. Earthworms, or “angle- 
worms” as they are called, feed on the soil and break 
up the particles into still finer ones. 
Agencies of Soil Formation.—These are the agen- 
cies, then, that assist each other in the formation of 
soil: Glaciers, wind, water, frost, plants, animals, and 
eases in the air. 
Kinds of Soils —What kinds of soils are formed by 
all these agencies? It must be remembered that all 
soil originally came from the rock, and the kind of 
soil must therefore depend on the kind of rock from 
which it was made. ‘That is, we have sandy soil in 
sandstone regions, and in limestone regions clay is 
usually found. Some black soil, found on low land, 
is made. principally from decayed leaves and plants. 
This soil is called humus. Humus mixed with clay 
and sand is called loam. If there is more sand than 
clay in the mixture it is called sandy loam, and if there 
is more clay than sand in the mixture it is called clayey 
loam.* 
The Treatment of Soils.—Of course, these soils are 
found mixed in every possible proportion. This fact 
leads to a great variety of soils, and it is the farmer’s 
business to learn the nature of the soil on his farm and 
how best to handle it. Loamy soils are the best farm 
lands, because of the ease with which they may be 
cultivated. They are warm soils and hold moisture 
* The kind of soil is determined by the relative amounts of 
large and small soil particles.
-P-A-G-E-34
    34 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
well. A sticky clay soil may be improved in texture, 
and warmed up at the same time, by a plentiful addi- 
tion of barnyard manure containing much straw. This 
vegetable matter makes clay more like loam. The 
same treatment is also good for sand, as it in- 
creases the capacity of sand for holding moisture and 
makes it like loam. If it were possible, and less ex- 
pensive, many barren sandy places might be made fer- 
tile by adding to them plentiful quantities of swamp 
muck. This treatment would convert them into a loam 
of good quality. Plowing under full grown crops 
of rye or clover has much the same effect. Either 
method adds humus to the soil and tends to make it 
more loamy. Rye grows well on sandy soil, and clover 
is a good crop to raise on clay for plowing under. A 
good loam contains all the foods needed by growing 
plants. 
Plant Foods that Become Exhausted.—As has been 
said before, only three of these foods, with the possible 
addition of lime, ever become exhausted. You will 
remember that these three are nitrogen, potash and 
phosphoric acid. It is the purpose of the next chapter 
to tell how you may judge from the character of the 
soil, and the growing crop, which one of these plant 
foods is most needed. 
Experimental Study of Soils. 
I. Ruba pinch of soil between the thumb and fore- 
finger. Are its particles fine or coarse? Spread a little 
on the palm of the hand. Are the particles all of the

same size? Does there seem to be any decayed vege- 
table matter in the soil? What is the color of the par- 
ticles? Are they all of the same color? 
2. Small samples of soil may be spread out in a 
thin layer on white paper and further examined with a 
magnifying glass. 
3. Thoroughly dry a sample of fine sand without 
lumps, and fill a water-tight tin can with it. Fill 
another can of exactly the same size with loam pre- 
pared in the same way. From a graduate’ pour water 
on the sand, allowing time for it to soak in. Soon the 
sand will have absorbed all the water it can hold, and 
the level of the water will be even with the surface of 
the sand in the can. What has become of the water 
which you poured onto the soil? How much water have 
you used? Now do exactly the same thing with the 
loam soil and compare results. Which soil has more 
pore space? 
4. Fill three soil tubes? respectively with fine dry 
sand, clay, and loam. Set the filled tubes in separate 
*A graduate may be made by ruling lines one-eighth inch apart 
on a strip of paper and pasting the paper vertically on a glass 
tumbler. 
*To prepare soil tubes: Take some tall glass bottles, wrap a 
cloth wrung out of cold water around each about half an inch 
from the bottom, and place the bottles on a hot stove. The 
sudden expansion of the bottom will usually break it off even. 
Smooth the edges with a file or on a grindstone. Plug the neck 
of each bottle with cotton, and turn it upside down. A rack for 
holding these tubes in an upright position can easily be made by 
nailing slats or stretching wire or strong cord across the top of a 
small box. Compact the soil by tapping the tube gently on the 
table.

amount of water. When it soaks out of sight pour in 
more. Use your graduate for this, so that you will get 
exactly the same amount of water in each tube. Which 
soil holds water best? Which soil allows it to soak 
through most rapidly?

CHAPTER V 
THE SOIL AND THE CROP 
Lack of Plant Food in Soil.—As suggested in the 
last chapter, the crop will usually tell the farmer by 
its appearance the kind of food it most needs. How- 
ever, the only way by which he can find this out for 
a certainty is by making careful experiments with the 
three essential fertilizers. Good, fertile, well-drained 
soil, properly cultivated, usually produces healthy, dark 
green plants with strong, good-sized stalks and numer- 
ous well-filled seeds. 
Nitrogen.—Now, the growth of the stalk and foliage 
of the plant is largely due to the nitrogen in the soil, 
provided, of course, that the drainage is good and 
other conditions of heat, light, air and moisture are 
favorable. If the plant has a yellow and sickly appear- 
ance and, with proper cultivation, refuses to grow, it 
is likely starving for want of nitrogen. What should 
the farmer do? 
The Best Fertilizer —Barnyard manure is an almost 
perfect fertilizer; that is, it has the right amounts of 
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash in it in a form 
readily obtainable by the plant. A plentiful application
-P-A-G-E-39
THE SOIL AND THE CROP 39 
of barnyard manure will improve the next crop, and is 
the best remedy for yellow and sickly plants. 
Plants as Fertilizers —In the next place, clover, 
alfalfa, peas and like plants which bear their seeds in 
pods may grow well on this kind of soil, because they 
have the power of using the nitrogen of the air ina 
way that will be explained later. These plants store 
up the nitrogen that they take from the air, and if they 
are plowed under when full grown they add this store 
of nitrogen to the soil, besides forming an excellent 
soil mulch. While generally not so good as barnyard 
manure, clover is an excellent means of restoring nitro- 
gen to the soil. In some cases it does more for the 
soil than barnyard manure can, and it is easier of . 
application. 
Commercial Ferttlizers.—Another fending consists 
of applying commercial fertilizers containing nitro- 
gen directly to the soil. These may be bought in the 
market, but as yet they are little used by western farm- 
ers, because manure and clover are ordinarily cheaper, 
more convenient and easier to apply. Guano, saltpeter, 
fish and animal refuse from slaughter houses are the 
principal commercial fertilizers that contain large 
amounts of this much-needed plant food. 
Phosphoric Acid.—A shortage of phosphoric acid in 
_ the soil is usually shown by small, undeveloped and 
shrunken seeds. The grain does not “fill well,” as the 
farmer says. The ground has been carefully prepared, 
tilled and drained. What is he to do? Nothing is 
simpler. Apply phosphoric acid fertilizers to the soil.
-P-A-G-E-40
  
40 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Here, again, barnyard manure, because it is a nearly 
perfect fertilizer, is one of the best and most easily 
obtainable for the purpose. Ground bones, burned 
bones, marls and rock phosphates are the fertilizers of 
commerce and are being more and more extensively 
used. 
  EFFECT OF POTASH APPLIED TO MARSH SOIL. 
Source of Potash.—Fotash is especially essential to 
the production of fruits, potatoes and root crops. In 
most cases, when other conditions are perfect, under- 
sized, shriveled and imperfect fruits and roots are 
due to a lack of potash. Here again barnyard manure’ 
is the usual remedy. Wood ashes are especially val- 
uable because of the potash which they contain. They 
should never be wasted, but saved and put on the land.
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE SOIL AND THE CROP 41 
Potash salts may be bought on the market, but like 
other commercial fertilizers they have not yet come 
into general use. 
Chemical Effect of Commercial Fertilizers on Soil. 
—There is still another use to which commercial fer- 
tilizers, like lime and land plaster, are put. They are 
used not so much because they are themselves plant 
foods, but because of the chemical effect which they 
have upon the soil. Your attention has already been 
called to the fact that plants sometimes starve with an 
abundance of food near at hand, but in a form in 
which they cannot use it for food—locked up, as it 
were, like bread and butter in a pantry. Ifa boy were 
starving because his food was “locked up” he would 
want the key. No boy will die of starvation with a 
well-filled cupboard, unlocked, in the house. Neither 
will plants starve when suitable food is obtainable. 
Now, lime and land plaster are two keys that unlock 
other plant foods in the soil and change them into a 
form in which the plants can use them. It is, princi- 
pally, for this reason that they are used. 
Summary.—To sum up what has already been said: 
  THE BOY’S CHORES.
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 | ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Barnyard manure is called a perfect fertilizer because 
it contains all the elements that become exhausted from 
the soil, namely : nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. 
It is usually easy to get, and for these reasons is 
generally recommended. Clover, plowed under, will re- 
store nitrogen to the soil because it has power to take 
nitrogen from the air, a power which few other plants 
have. Wood ashes are rich in potash and should never 
be wasted, but sown on the soil. Commercial fer- 
tilizers, containing what the soil especially needs, may 
be bought and applied. When they are wisely applied 
the profit from their use may be large. The subject of 
fertilizers and fertilization is a large and very important 
one to the farmer. It needs much thought and care- 
ful study, and is only touched upon here in the briefest 
possible manner. The problems which follow will help 
to emphasize the points made in this chapter.

CHAPTER VI 
WEARING OUT THE SOIL 
Soil Exhaustion —From what we learned in the last 
chapter, it is easily seen that the farmer who raises 
grain and tobacco to sell, and who returns nothing to 
the land in the form of fertilizers, is literally “selling 
his farm.” He sells soil in small quantities, it is true, 
but he sells it nevertheless. There can be but one re- 
sult from this kind of farming. No matter how rich 
the soil, sooner or later it will wear out. The poorer 
the land the sooner will its fertility become exhausted. 
Over-Cropping Land.—In the early history of Wis- 
consin much wheat was grown, the land in many cases 
yielding as high as forty bushels per acre. But the 
yield rapidly decreased until no more than ten or fif- 
teen bushels could be grown. The farmers gave up 
selling wheat, and the wheat belt moved on to the. 
west. Why was this? Simply because wheat, a heavy 
feeder as shown by the tables, wore out the soil. No 
fertilizers were returned to take the place of the soil 
matter taken off with the wheat, and in a few years the 
wheat crop starved out. What is true of wheat is 
equally true of every other crop, in the proportion in  
-P-A-G-E-45
  
WEARING OUT THE SOIL 45 
which it uses up in its growth nitrogen, phosphoric 
acid and potash. 
How Fertility May Be Retained.—Progressive 
farmers have learned that grain farming does not pay, 
and they have gone into dairying and have prospered. 
Why is dairy farming so 
much better? Because the 
erain and hay raised on 
the farm are fed there and

Clover Enriches the Soil—Again, the dairy farmer 
raises much clover, and clover, as you have already

from the air.

CHAPTER VII 
LEGUMES 
Restoring Nitrogen to the Soil—From a study of 
the table on fertilizing substances in different soils, 
and a comparison of this table with the one on fer- 
tilizing substances in farm crops, it will be seen that 
nitrogen is the element which, from ordinary soils 
and under ordinary conditions of farming, is likely 
to be the soonest exhausted. Ordinarily, then, the 
farmer’s attention should be turned to methods of 
restoring nitrogen. Ifa sufficient quantity of manure 
were produced on the farm, of course the best method 
of fertilizing would be to apply barnyard manure to 
the soil, as it not only contains nitrogen, but also phos- 
phoric acid and potash, the other needed elements. 
But it is not always possible to do this. There is a 
class of plants, however, called legumes, that have the 
power to add nitrogen to the soil. Peas, beans, clover, 
alfalfa, cowpeas, hairy vetch, and soja ‘beans belong 
to this class. It is the purpose of this chapter to 
explain the manner in which these plants add nitrogen 
to the soil. 
Composition of Air.—The air that we breathe is 
composed largely of two gases—oxygen and nitrogen.
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Both are colorless, odorless and invisible. About one- 
fifth-of the air is oxygen and the other four-fifths 
nitrogen. Oxygen is a very active element, combining 
readily with other substances. It is the oxygen that 
causes iron to rust, coal to burn, or wood to decay. If 
the air were pure oxygen, any fire once started could 
never be put out, and even our bodies would take fire 
and burn. 
Nature of Nitrogen.—On the other hand, nitrogen 
is a very inactive element and does not combine readily 
with other substances. Its presence in the air dilutes 
the oxygen and makes it less active. It is well known 
that tea can be made so strong that no person can 
drink it. It may be readily diluted and its strength 
greatly lessened, however, by the addition of water. It 
is much the same way with oxygen. It is so active that 
it must be mixed with nitrogen before it can be used by 
man and animals. It is mixed in the air, there being, 
as has been said, about four times as much nitrogen as 
oxygen in it. Farm crops cannot use this “free” nitro- 
gen in the air. 
The Use of Bacteria.—There are, however, little 
plant-like germs, called bacteria, which live in the soil, 
that can and do feed upon this free nitrogen in the air. 
These germs are a kind of parasite and are usually 
found associated with the legumes, i. e., with peas, 
beans, clover and the like. They fasten themselves to 
the roots of these plants and build their homes there. 
Their little “nests” look like tiny potatoes and are 
called tubercles. They are about as large as pinheads

and are to be found adhering to the roots of clover, 
beans and peas. Pull up a bunch of thrifty clover, or 
any other legume, and examine its roots for these 
tubercles. A peculiar thing about these germs is that
-P-A-G-E-52
  se ———_ 
  52 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
they do not seem to thrive without the legumes and the 
legumes do not thrive without the germs. Sometimes 
clover refuses to grow on certain soils. The reason may 
be that there are no germs in the soil. Such soils should 
be “inoculated,” i. e., the germs should be planted 
there, and then the clover will grow. These germs are 
sent out by the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture in little cakes, somewhat resembling yeast cakes 
which may be dissolved in water and sprayed on the 
land, or the seed inoculated with this solution.

Clover Restores Nitrogen to the Soil—In order to 
restore nitrogen to worn-out soil it is only necessary 
to seed with clover or some other legume. The germs 
found in the tubercles on the roots of the legume will 
feed upon the nitrogen of the air and store it up in the
-P-A-G-E-53
  LEGUMES 53 
legume. If this crop is plowed under, nitrogen is 
added to the soil, which is consequently enriched and 
at the same time improved in texture, especially if it 
be a clayey soil. This is the secret of clover growing 
on the farm. It is the common practice among farm- 
ers to cut the first crop of clover for hay and plow 
under the second crop. Thus the clover is made to 
serve a double purpose—first furnishing food for stock, 
and next a supply of nitrogen for the soil.

  CHAPTER VIII 
TILLING THE SOIL 
Tillage.—Tillage stands next in importance to fer- 
tilization, and with many soils it is even more impor- 
tant. Tillage is here meant to include both the prep- 
aration of the soil before planting and, with the crops 
that admit of it, the cultivation of the crop after it is _ 
planted. | 
Effect on Roots.—As we have learned, the plant is 
fed by its roots that penetrate the soil in every direc- 
tion. These feeding roots are very small and work 
their way between the soil particles, gathering up the 
dissolved food and passing it into the plant. If the 
soil is coarse and lumpy these little rootlets cannot get 
at the food locked up in the lumps, but can feed only 
upon their surface. Proper preparation of the soil 
will break up these lumps, pulverize them, and allow 
the roots of the plants to get at the food matter which 
they contain. Again, water cannot easily dissolve 
plant foods in lumpy ground. Stirring the soil will 
hasten the solution of this food matter. These facts 
may be easily shown by experiment. 
How Solids Dissolve-—Throw a handful of fine salt
-P-A-G-E-56
56 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
into a tumbler of water. Into another tumbler put a 
lump of salt or a piece of rock salt about the same 
size. Which dissolves the sooner? Stir both and note 
the effect of stirring. Does stirring hasten solution? 
Now put the same amount of fine salt in each of two 
glasses. Stir one, but do not disturb the other. 
The Effect of Stirring Soil—yYou have noticed, in 
the above experiments, that lumpy salt dissolves much 
more slowly than fine salt, and that stirring always 
hastens solution. It is just so with plant foods con- 
tained in the soil. Lumpy soil holds the plant foods 
so that the plant cannot get them, and cultivation 
has the same effect upon them that stirring has upon 
the salt in the water. It causes them to dissolve or in 
some way makes them accessible. The plant cannot 
use these foods until they are in the right condition, so 
that excellent preparation of the soil before planting, 
and constant cultivation of it after planting, both tend 
to increase the supply of plant food as well as to 
hasten the growth of plants. 
Deep Cultivation Best——The depth to which soils 
should be cultivated depends in a large degree upon 
the depth to which the plant roots will penetrate.. The 
grains are shallow-rooted and do not need so deep 
cultivation as do corn and root crops. The farmer‘is 
not likely to plow too deep for any crop, however. 
Deep plowing brings to the surface plant foods that 
have never been reached by shallow cultivation, and it 
pulverizes the soil so that the roots can penetrate it to 
a great depth and have more soil to feed upon.
-P-A-G-E-57
TILLING THE SOIL 57 
Deep Plowing for Root Crops.—F¥or root crops the 
ground must be plowed deep and be very carefully 
pulverized. There are two reasons for this. In the 
first place, poorly pulverized soil spoils the shape of

This tomato plant attained the height of eleven feet, six inches and

roots like beets and parsnips. They cannot grow 
equally in all directions, and become crooked, split, and 
misshapen because of the hindrance of lumps to their 
growth. In the second place, if they cannot penetrate 
the soil easily, when they strike the hard soil below, 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
they will be raised out of the ground as they increase 
in length. All that has been said about cultivation of 
plants applies with special force to root crops. 
How Water Rises in Soil_—Another important 
reason for cultivation is to be found in the fact that 
cultivated soils do not dry out so rapidly during a 
drought. This seems strange at first, but it 1s never- 
theless true, and the reason is easily seen. There 
are two kinds of water in the ground—capillary water 
and “free,” underground, water. Underground water 
flows along beneath the surface and sometimes comes 
out again in the form of springs. It is this water 
that supplies our wells. But it is the capillary water, 
and not the “free” water, that is used by the plants. 
A simple illustration will make clear what capillary 
water is. You have, no doubt, observed how oil rises 
in the lamp-wick. The oil in the wick is moving 
_ upward and may be called “capillary” oil, while that 
in the lamp is “free.’”’ The oil in the wick corre- 
sponds to the capillary water in the soil, while that 
in the lamp corresponds to the underground water. 
Another illustration: At the breakfast table take a 
spoonful of sugar and just touch the tip of the spoon 
to the surface of the coffee in your cup, and notice 
how the coffee creeps up into the sugar. It is in 
exactly the same way that the underground water 
creeps upward in the soil and becomes capillary water. 
Still another illustration: Fill a pan half full of 
water; set it on a table and throw a rag over the edge 
so that one end will dip into the water and the other
-P-A-G-E-59
  TILLING THE SOIL 59 
end will lie on the table. In a little while the water 
will be running from the pan out upon the table. In 
other words, it runs “up-hill,” through the cloth, over 
the edge of the pan, and “down-hill” through the 
cloth to the table. The water that runs up-hill is 
capillary water, while that in the pan is free water. 
The capillary water is being continually supplied from 
the free water in the pan below. Let us remember that 
  A WELL CULTIVATED CORN FIELD. 
it is the capillary water which the plant uses and which 
is also evaporating from the soil. 
Cultivation Retards Evaporation.—We know that if 
we cover up a kettle it keeps the water from evaporat- 
ing, “boiling away,” as we say. -In the same way a 
blanket, spread over the soil, will check the evapora-
-P-A-G-E-60
    60 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
tion of this capillary water. The simplest way to get 
this blanket spread over the soil is to cultivate it. The 
layer of cultivated soil dries out very rapidly, but it 
prevents the air from getting at the moist soil under- 
neath, and thus keeps it from drying out. It acts asa 
sort of dry blanket to prevent the evaporation of mois- 
ture. 
Summary.—There are three chief reasons for till- 
ing the soil: (1) To pulverize it, making it easy 
for the plant roots to penetrate it in every direction 
and to get at the store of food it contains. (2) To stir 
it and thus hasten the solution of plant food as well as 
to destroy weeds that rob the plants of their food. 
(3) To form a soil mulch, a sort of “dry blanket,” 
which will prevent rapid evaporation of the capillary 
water from the soil.

CHAPTER IX 
DRAINING THE SOIL 
Underground Water.—As was stated in the last 
chapter, the plant makes use of the capillary water in 
the soil, and this capillary water is being continually 
supplied from the free water in the ground below. 
There is a level to this underground water, just the 
same as there is a level to the water in a pond. On 
low, flat land this level is usually near the surface. It is 
at or above the surface on swampy ground, and usually 
many feet below the surface in high places. Ordinarily, 
high ground needs little attention so far as drainage is 
concerned, as the water which falls upon it either soaks 
in or runs rapidly off as surface water. 
Water Level Must Be Below Surface of Sotl.— 
Low ground, however, does need attention. Plants 
cannot grow without air, and much water in the soil 
keeps out the air. The level of the underground water 
must therefore be below the depth to which the roots 
of the crop ordinarily penetrate the soil. In other 
words, a crop will not do well on a field where the free 
water level is too near the surface. You have all seen 
crops “drowned out,” as the farmer says. If you dig 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
a post-hole in such soil it will soon fill with water to 
within a foot or so from the top. The level of the 
water in this hole will be the free water level, and if 
it comes very near the surface no crop can be expected 
to do well there. 
Wet Soils Are Cold Soils——In wet soils a large

amount of heat is used in evaporating part of the 
water, and so much is required to raise the tempera- 
ture of what remains that these soils never become 
warm. Often such soils are sour, and cannot become 
sweet until the water is drained off and the heat and 
air let in. Sometimes it is even necessary to sow lime
-P-A-G-E-65
DRAINING THE SOIL 65 
on these soils, after the water has been drained off, in 
order to sweeten them. 
Drainage.—What is the farmer to do with low, wet 
ground? Evidently there is but one thing to do—drain 
off the water. ‘There are two methods of draining this 
water off, the open ditch and the tile drain. To begin 
  THE SAME FIELD AFTER BEING TILE DRAINED. 
with, the land may be so low and flat that no kind of 
drainage is possible. This, of course, may be deter- 
mined by noting the level of the water in the nearest 
stream. If it is within a foot or two of the surface of 
the land and overflows with every heavy rain, easy 
drainage is impossible. But if the surface of the soil is 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    66 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE. 
a few feet above the level of the stream, the land can be 
easily drained. 
Tiling.—It is conceded that the tile system of drain- 
age is better than the open ditch, though it requires 
more labor and expense. The tiles should be placed 
about three feet below the surface, so that the ground 
water level will be lowered to this point and the ground 
cultivated without interfering with the tiles. The size 
of the tiles to be used, and the distance apart which 
they should be placed, depends upon the slope and the 
character of the soil. An experienced drainage engi- 
neer should have charge of the work. 
Open Ditches.—Open ditches may prove quite as 
effectual in draining the land, if they be deep enough 
and not too far apart. Of course they must be kept 
cleaned out. The greatest objection to open ditches is 
that they cut up the land and thus interfere with culti- 
vation. They can best be used in draining out sloughs 
and narrow, swampy places. Many acres of low land, 
now uncultivated, might be made very productive if 
properly drained.

  CHAPTER X 
THE CROP 
Effect of Unwise Cropping.—Every farmer desires 
to be prosperous. He tries to raise those crops which 
will give him the largest returns in money; but often, 
in his anxiety to do this, he takes too little heed for 
the future. He reasons thus: “If tobacco is a high 
price and my soil will raise good tobacco, then tobacco 
is the crop for me to raise.” So, year after year, he 
plants tobacco, until he finds that his soil will no longer 
raise a good crop of tobacco or anything else. Plainly, 
he has made a great mistake. What is the matter? 
Tobacco Exhausts the Soil_—The explanation is not 
hard to find. Tobacco is very hard on the soil, as you 
will readily see by consulting the table showing the 
amount of fertilizing substances in farm crops. Be- 
sides, tobacco requires the same kind of food, year 
after year, and unless the farmer has made a careful 
study of this crop, and of the fertilizers needed for its 
proper growth, his soil soon becomes exhausted of 
some of its fertilizing substances. The same is true 
of wheat, or corn, or any other crop, grown year after 
year on the same piece of ground. So the farmer
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
needs to consider not only the immediate returns— 
that is, the amount of money he will get from his crop 
this year—but the effect that the crop will have upon 
the soil. 
Crop Rotation.—Good farmers have devised a plan, 
known as “crop rotation,’’ whereby they are able to 
secure the greatest possible returns from the farm with 
the least possible loss to the soil. This plan consists in 
growing one kind of crop on a certain piece of ground 
this year, another kind of crop requiring different food 
materials and soil treatment next year, still another the 
year following, and so on. 
One Plan of Crop Rotation—Now, what should 
form the basis of a good crop rotation? Let us see. 
Suppose tobacco is to be grown this year. It isa 
heavy feeder and therefore hard on the soil. A large 
amount of soil matter will be removed with the crop. 
This should be restored. But how? With barnyard 
manure. Instead of planting tobacco next year, on 
this piece of land, better try some light feeder. If the 
soil is not too rich, oats will be a good crop to. follow 
the tobacco. Clover can be sown with the oats, thereby 
increasing the nitrogen in the soil. A crop of clover 
hay can be taken off the third year and the second crop 
plowed under. The soil is in good condition again, 
and wheat or corn can be grown. Corn will afford an 
excellent opportunity for a thorough cultivation of the 
soil. A crop of peas may follow the corn. As you will 
remember, peas belong to the legume family and re- 
store nitrogen to the soil in the same way that clover 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE CROP 71 
does. If the peas are sold to the canning factory, the 
vines should be brought back onto the land and plowed 
under to enrich the soil. It is now in good condition 
for a second crop of tobacco. | 
  HARVEST TIME. 
Results of Rotation.—Now let us see what has been 
done: A five years’ rotation has been planned, con- 
sisting of tobacco, oats, clover, corn and peas, return- 
ing to tobacco again the sixth year. During that five 
years it has been necessary to manure this piece of land 
but once. During two years legumes have been grown
-P-A-G-E-72
72 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
and plowed under to enrich the soil. This manure and 
these legumes have doubtless kept up the fertility of 
the soil. The farmer has had an opportunity for four 
years to manure other pieces of land. At the same 
time he has been following some plan of rotation on 
the rest of his farm, Each year he has grown tobacco, 
he has raised corn and sold his hogs, he has made 
hay for his cattle, and he has sold peas to the canning 
factory. He lias been taking in money all the time, but 
he has not greatly exhausted his soil.

T—Tobacco, O—Oats, Cl—Clover, B—Beets, W—Wheat, C—Corn, 
A—Alfalfa. 
Crop Rotation and Length of Roots.—There 1s 
still another feature of crop rotation worthy of study 
here. It is the different depths to which the roots of 
various crops penetrate. In the first place, tobacce is 
a long-rooted crop, and feeds deep down in the soil. 
Oats, which follow, are short-rooted and feed near 
the surface. Then comes clover, whose roots penetrate 
several feet, bringing food matter to the surface from
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE CROP 73 
deep down in the soil.’ When this crop is plowed 
under it furnishes a food supply for the corn which 
follows it. Now, if oats had been grown on this soil 
year after year, their short roots would soon have 
exhausted the food supply near the surface. This diffi- 
culty has been avoided by the rotation of crops. Again, 
crop rotation affords an opportunity for cultivation 
which destroys weeds and increases the power of the 
soil to produce the desired crop. 
Conditions Determine Kind of Ration —The rota- 
tion given in this chapter is only a “sample’’ rotation, 
not an “ideal” one, and is introduced here only for the 
purpose of illustration. The farmer should devise 
rotations of his own, suited to the special needs of his 
farm and to the market for his products.

Experimental Study of Root Systems. 
1. Pull or dig up full-grown stalks of oats, wheat, 
rye, barley, corn, tobacco, clover, alfalfa and other 
farm crops. Many of the roots will break off in the 
ground, but those that remain will be sufficient for 
comparison. Which of these penetrate the soil the 
deepest? Classify them in the order of length. 
2. Bring in radishes, turnips, roots of oats, corn, 
and other farm.crops. Measure their length and count 
the number of small roots on each of these plants.
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 FLEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Note the manner in which these roots grow. Which 
are “fleshy” and good for food? Which are unsuit- 
able for food because they are “fibrous’’? 
3. Pull up peas, beans, clover and alfalfa. Exam- 
ine these roots for little tubercles, like tiny potatoes, 
varying in size from a pinhead to a pea and larger. You 
will probably find them on all of these plants. These 
little nodules are the homes of tiny germs that feed 
upon the nitrogen of the air. The plants in turn feed 
‘upon this stored-up nitrogen. 
Problems. 
1. If corn is planted in rows four feet apart each 
way, how many hills to the acre? With three good 
ears to the hill, how many ears to the acre? 
2. If it takes 100 ears to make a bushel, how many 
bushels to the acre? 
3. Which is the best crop? Five stalks to the hill 
that bear ears requiring 200 to make a bushel, or 3 
stalks to the hill that bear ears requiring 100 to make a 
bushel ? 
4. How many bushels per acre is one crop better 
than the other? 
5. Suppose a ten-acre field produces 60 bushels 
of corn per acre the first year, but falls off 5 bushels

CHAPTER XI 
INSECTS AND DISEASES THAT INJURE THE CROPS 
Insects and Plant Diseases—The farmer may pre- 
pare the soil ever so well, he may fertilize with the 
greatest of care, he may cultivate thoroughly, the 
weather conditions may be favorable, and yet he may 
lose all or a portion of his crop through the attacks 
of insects or the ravages of plant diseases. 
Every child has seen potato bugs at work and knows 
full well the damage they will do in a short space of 
time. If they are not destroyed the crop of potatoes 
will be. However, the farmer has learned how to fight 
this pest successfully. But there are many other in- 
sects injurious to the crop which the average farmer 
has not yet learned how to fight, and he has paid but 
little attention to plant diseases. It is not within the 
province of this book to deal with these subjects in 
detail, but there are a few general principles which may 
be laid down here, and which will prove of value in 
the war that the farmer must continually wage against 
plant diseases and insect pests. 
It is necessary for us to know something of the life 
history of the insects which we fight—when they lay
-P-A-G-E-77
  INSECTS AND PLANT DISEASES 77 
their eggs, where they lay them, when the eggs hatch, 
and the like. 
Parts of an Insect.—Insects are so called because 
they are “in sections.” They have a head provided 
with a pair of feelers, a pair of strong jaws or a suck- 
ing tube, a body to which are attached three pairs of 
legs, usually two pairs of wings, and an abdomen. 
The abdomen is the back portion of the body made up 
of several ring-like sections and capable of holding a 
large amount of food. ‘They breathe through little 
holes in their sides. 
  THE FOUR STAGES OF INSECT GROWTH. 
Eggs on leaf, caterpillar, chrysalis or resting stage, full grown 
insect. 
The Life of an Insect.—There are ordinarily four 
stages of insect growth—the egg stage, the “grub” or 
caterpillar stage, the resting stage and the full grown 
insect. The egg is laid by a full-grown insect in the 
ground, on the leaves of plants, in rotten wood, on the 
bark of trees, or even in the blossoms of plants, or in 
fruits. This egg hatches into what we usually call a
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
grub or worm. The grub is a great eater and grows 
very rapidly, as those of you who have watched the 
young potato bugs grow can testify. It then hides 
itself somewhere and goes into the resting state, the 
pupa, from which it emerges a full-grown insect, 
ready to lay eggs and repeat this cycle. Some insects, 
as the potato bug, have legs in the “grub” stage, and 
others, like the grasshopper, do not go into a resting 
state at all but grow their wings as they hop about in 
search of food. 
Leaf-Eating and Sap-Sucking Insects—For our 
convenience we will divide insects into two classes— 
one class that eats the leaves and another class the 
members of which are too small to eat leaves but large 
enough to suck the sap of plants. 
How to Destroy Insects—Now, what can the 
farmer do if his crop is attacked by insects? If he can 
find out where these insects lay their eggs he can de- 
stroy the eggs. If they lay them on weeds and rub- 
bish he can destroy them by keeping fence rows clean 
and fields free from weeds. If they lay them in the 
ground in the fall he can plow the ground and freeze 
them out. If they are leaf-eating insects he can spray 
the crop with water containing paris green and poison 
their food. If they are sap-sucking insects, like plant 
lice, he can spray the trees or plants on which they 
live with a mixture of kerosene and soap suds, which 
will fill up the little breathing holes in the sides of 
their bodies and kill them. At the close of this chapter 
will be found formule for spraying mixtures for
-P-A-G-E-79
  INSECTS AND PLANT DISEASES 79 
both these kinds of insects. Some farmers plant a 
“trap” crop—that is, a crop earlier than the regular 
one—upon which the insects light to deposit their 
eggs. As soon as the eggs are laid the crop is de- 
stroyed, or else it is poisoned to destroy both the old 
insects and the young ones when they hatch. 
Caution in Using Poisons——A word of caution in 
the use of poisons is necessary here. Cases are on 
record where people have been poisoned with paris 
green intended for insects. Of course, it should never 
be applied to cabbage or celery or any vegetable that is 
used for food. Currants have sometimes been poisoned 
in an effort to kill the currant worm. In no case 
should deadly poison be used on fruit trees after the 
fruit is half grown. 
Other Plant Diseases.—It is often convenient for the 
farmer to fight other enemies of his crop, known as 
plant diseases, while carrying on his fight against in- 
sects, as One spraying may be made to do for both. 
Rust, blight, smut, rot and the like are diseases 
which afflict the plant. They are caused by little, dust- 
like particles, called spores, that float around in the 
air and settle on healthy plants. Here they grow and 
multiply very rapidly. They injure the plant by living 
upon its sap—in much the same way that lice and ticks 
suck the blood of cattle and sheep. They must be 
destroyed or they will destroy the plant on which they 
feed. 
As soon as the spores make their appearance in the 
field or orchard the farmer should begin his fight. If
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
it is blight, the affected part should be immediately cut 
off and burned. If this is not done the wind will carry 
the spores to the other trees, and soon the whole 
orchard will be affected. The other trees should be 
sprayed with Bordeaux mixture or self-boiled lime- 
sulphur solution to prevent the spread of the disease. 
To Destroy Oat Smut.—For some years past oat 
smut has been destroying a large portion of the crop 
all over the United States, but this disease is now un- 
der control, as a way to kill the spores has been discov- 
ered. The treatment consists in soaking the seed for 
a few minutes in a solution of formaldehyde, and then 
spreading it out on the floor to dry before sowing. 
The recipe is given at the close of this chapter. 
Destruction of Spores.—So. it is with all plant dis- 
eases—destroy the spores, and the disease is destroyed.. 
The best medicine for this purpose is formaldehyde, a 
substance which can be obtained at any drug store. It 
will destroy the spores of more plant diseases than any 
other remedy yet discovered, and is usually applied by 
‘soaking the seed in the solution before planting. 
Excess of Insect Poitsons.—Care must be taken in 
applying mixtures for both insects and plant diseases 
not to get too much poison on the plants, as the crop 
itself may be injured thereby. Paris green may be 
sprinkled on potato vines with an old pepper box, if 
care is taken not to use too much. It should be dusted 
over the plants as one walks rapidly along the row. 
Two pounds of poison is ample for an acre of pota- 
toes.
-P-A-G-E-81
{NSECTS AND PLANT DISEASES 81 
When the crop is troubled by both insects and plant 
cliseases the remedies may be mixed and applied at a 
single spraying. A good spraying pump costs from 
two dollars up. The recipes for and the average cost 
of the mixtures are given below. 
Experimental Study of Insects. 
Insects may be captured with a net made of mos- 
quito bar attached to a hoop at the end of a long 
stick. Before examination they should be killed in a 
“cyanide bottle.’ This bottle is prepared as follows: 
Into a large-mouthed bottle, provided with a cork, put 
a small piece of potassium cyanide, a very deadly 
poison. Cover this poison with a layer of plaster of 
paris and allow it to harden. Always keep the bottle 
tightly corked. Shake the live insect from the net into 
this bottle and it will soon be ready for examination. 
1. Study a wasp, a bee, or a grasshopper. Note 
the three parts of its body, the head, the thorax or 
middle section, and the large hind section, or abdomen. 
Also note that the abdomen is made up of smaller, 
ring-like sections. From this can you see why they 
are called insects? Watch the abdomen of a live in- 
sect closely and see it expand and contract as the in- 
sect breathes. 
2. How many legs has an insect? Are they al- 
ways attached to the same part of the body? How are 
the legs jointed? 
3. Many insects are wingless; some have a single 
pair of wings and others have two pairs of wings.
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Beetles have thick heavy wing covers. Examine in- 
sects and note the number and’kind of wings on each 
species. 
4. All insects have antenne or “feelers.” In your 
study of insects compare their antenne. Are they 
long or short? smooth or feathered? Of what use 
are the antennz? 
5- Study the mouth parts of different insects and 
try to determine the different ways in which they get 
their food. The butterfly and the grasshopper are 
good examples. 
6. Make a little cage and put into it a live cater- 
pillar with plenty of green leaves of the kind on which 
it feeds. Watch it spin its cocoon and go into the rest- 
ing stage. Keep it where you can observe what hap- 
pens later. Jn the spring collect cocoons, put them 
into your cage and wait for the moths or butterflies 
to come out.

CHAPTER XII 
THE DESTRUCTION OF WEEDS 
The Nature of Weeds—The Bible provides that 
man shall eat bread in the sweat of his face. This is 
especially true of the farmer’s life. His is a continual 
battle against the enemies of his crops. He must work 
hard, early and late, to combat the ravages of insect 
pests and plant diseases, but harder still to eradicate 
the weeds. 
Any plant growing where the farmer does not want / 
it might be considered a weed. Why are weeds ob- 
jectionable? In the first place, they rob other plants 
of their food. Suppose you go every morning to feed 
the chickens. and as soon as you throw down the grain 
for them a great flock of pigeons from a neighboring 
farm should swoop down and pick up half of it before 
the chickens could get it, would you not say to that 
neighbor, “If you don’t take care of those pigeons 
IT shall’? 
Work of Weeds.~—Weeds rob the other plants of 
their food just as truly and just as effectually as the 
pigeons rob the chickens in the illustration given above. 
If weeds are allowed to grow in a field the crop is 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
THE FIGHT AGAINST WEEDS 87 
starved out. They rob the plants of moisture as well 
as of food. In the second place, they serve as a breed- 
ing ground for insects, as many insects seem to prefer 
to lay their eggs on weeds. In the third place, they 
shade small plants and rob them of much needed sun- 
light. These are the principal reasons why weeds 
should be destroyed. 
Classification of Weeds.—In order to fight weeds 
to the best advantage we must know something of 
their life history. They may be divided into three 
classes—annuals, biennials, and perennials. 
Annuals.—Plants that go to seed every year and 
then die, coming up from the seed each year, are called 
annuals. Pigweed, wild mustard, sweet clover and 
ragweed belong to this class. It is only necessary to 
prevent them from going to seed to destroy them. 
This class of weeds is the easiest one to get rid of. 
Biennials—Plants that live for two years are bi- 
ennials. They grow up from the seed one year and 
erow a heavy root, but do not go to seed that year. 
The next year they come up from the root, go to seed 
and then die. If we pull them up by the roots the 
first year, or keep them from going to seed the second 
year, we can easily destroy them. Cutting them off 
and not allowing them to go to seed for two years in 
succession will have the same effect. Mullein, wild 
parsnip, burdock and bull thistle belong to this class. 
 Perennials.—Plants that go to seed every year but 
whose roots live on from year to year are perennials, 
and the only way to eradicate them is to destroy them
-P-A-G-E-88
88 ‘ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
root and branch—not an easy thing to do. Perennials 
give most trouble to the farmer. To this class belong 
the large number of “noxious” weeds, Canada thistle, 
ox-eye daisy, couch grass, sorrel and common dock. 
As soon as any of the above make their appearance 
on the farm the farmer should dig them up and burn 
them. If they are allowed to spread they will soon 
have possession of the farm. The writer has seen 
whole plantations, thousands of acres, in the South 
surrendered to the ox-eye daisy. When weeds have 
driven the farmer off the land is rendered valueless, 
as it is next to impossible to subdue them if they once 
have gained control. 7

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE STOCK ON THE FARM 
Stock.—The successful farmer avoids “scrub” stock. 
He has learned two important facts: First, that it pays 
to take good care of his stock, and, second, that it costs 
no more, in care and feed, to raise a good animal than 
to raise a poor one. Now, let us analyze these two 
propositions and see how a thorough understanding 
of these truths affects the farmer’s success. 
Why Animals Need Food.—As will be more fully 
discussed in the next chapter, animals must be fed for 
several reasons. In the first place they must grow, 
and the food that they eat furnishes the material for 
this growth. In the second place they must be kept 
warm, and the fuel for animal heat comes from their 
food. Again, if some special product, like milk, is to 
be produced; this, too, must come from the food. 
Why does it pay to take good care of stock? 
Feeding Stock.—Care is here meant to include food, 
shelter and general attention. If the animal is to grow 
rapidly it must be well fed, since the food furnishes 
the material for this increase in weight. Not only 
this, but it must be fed regularly. If not, its digestive 
organs become deranged; that is, it becomes dyspeptic 
and its food passes off without being properly digested.
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE STOCK ON THE FARM 91 
  
The Shelter of Stock.—Stock must be provided with 
shelter at all seasons of the year to protect them from 
the heat and storms of summer and the cold of winter. 
If their stables are cold, then the additional heat re- 
quired to keep them warm must be furnished by addi- 
tional food. Animals, like persons, are very sensitive 
_ to sudden changes of temperature, to sleet and snow, 
and cold and wind. They “ catch cold,” get sick and 
lose flesh in consequence. How necessary, then, for 
the farmer to provide a shed for the cattle to run 
under during storms, a tight board fence on the north 
and west sides of the barnyard to break the wind, and 
warm stables for all his stock. 
General Altiention to Stock.—General attention 
covers that watchful care so necessary to successful 
stock raising. Barns and barnyards must be kept 
clean, stalls bedded, pure water provided, stock kept 
free from ticks and lice, horses curried, their feet at- 
tended to, the health of all animals carefully watched, 
diseased ones removed and shut up by themselves; 
these, all these, and a thousand and one other little 
things constitute the general attention which the suc- 
cessful farmer gives to his stock. 
Effect of Lack of Care.—We can best prove that it 
pays by imagining the result of a lack of such care. 
‘With neglect more food is required to make the ani- 
mals grow and more food needed to keep them warm. 
- Neglected animals grow slowly, are “stunted” in 
growth, finally stop growing altogether, and some- 
times sicken and die. Dirty animals are unhealthy  
-P-A-G-E-92
Q2 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
and get “scabby” and “lousy.” Unless carefully at- 
tended to, horses get the thrush or contracted feet, are 
“foundered” and ruined. Cows exposed to wet and 
cold, or chased by dogs, “shrink in milk.’ All these 
conditions cause great loss to the farmer. No one can 
doubt that it pays to take good care of the stock. 
Advantages of Good Stock.—Now for the other 
proposition: It costs no more, in feed and care, to 
raise a good animal than if does to raise a poor one.   
  FANCY SHEEP. 
A scrub cow takes as much stable room, eats as much 
hay, requires as much pasture, takes as much time to 
milk, needs as much general attention, and, in the end, 
returns about half as much product to the farmer. A 
“scrub” colt requires all that a blooded colt requires 
and is worth about half as much on the market. A 
“scrub” sheep is no better than a “scrub” cow. She. 
produces about half as much wool and raises a “scrub” 
lamb that sells for about half what a good one brings.

THE STOCK ON THE FARM 93 
There is nothing bad enough to say of a “scrub’’ hog. 
It certainly requires as much care as a genuine 
“porker.” What does it bring on the market? Not 
. half what a well-bred pig of the same age will bring. 
If more evidence of the truth of the two propositions 
stated at the beginning of this chapter is needed it will 
be found in the answers to the practical problems 
which follow.

Fertilizer in Stock Food.—One thing must not be 
lost sight of, however. Hay and grain fed to stock 
are not entirely wasted. In a ton of hay worth $6 
there is at least $3 worth of manure, if it is carefully 
saved and returned to the land. But $3 in value has 
actually disappeared when the hay has been fed. Ten 
dollars’ worth of oats, or corn, or barley, fed to stock, 
will give in return $3.50 worth of manure. Below is 
given a table showing the actual cash value of the ma-

nure produced by different farm animals during the 
year when they are kept in stalls and the manure care- 
fully saved. On the average farm at least two-thirds 
of this value is wasted. Pupils should use the second . 
table for ordinary problems. To the increase in the 
value of the animal produced by feeding a certain 
amount of feed must be added the value of the manure 
produced by the animal from the food that is eaten.

  CHAPTER XIV 
FEEDING THE STOCK 
Reasons for Feeding Stock.—We all know that 
farm animals should be fed, well fed, but we do not all 
know exactly why they need feeding. Some of the 
reasons were mentioned in the last chapter. Let us 
name them all now: 
1. To repair the waste. 
2. To build up the body. 
3. To keep the body warm. 
4. -To furnish energy for the body. 
5. To make special products—milk, eggs, wool and 
the like. 
Repair of the Waste.—As the horse works, and the 
sheep or cow walks about in search of food, or even in 
the ordinary functions of life, the animal body is con- 
tinually wearing away. What child has not noticed 
the horses grow poor during the “spring work” or ob- 
‘served that he himself has lost weight after great - 
exertion! This loss in weight is the waste that must 
be repaired, and for this repair food is necessary. For 
this very reason farmers always feed their horses more 
when they work them hard.
-P-A-G-E-99
  FEEDING THE STOCK 99 
Why Growing Animals Need Plenty of Food.— 
Growing animals must not only keep this waste re- 
paired, but they must also increase in weight. [Tor 
this reason they need more food in proportion to their 
size. First, waste must be repaired before the animal 
can grow; then, whatever is left over, goes toward 
building up the body. 
Food Supply and Energy.—Work horses must feel 
strong; that is, they must be full of energy. But what 
isenergy? Simply this: power to do work. A healthy 
man has more energy than a healthy boy. He has 
stronger muscles. He has greater power to do work 
and can endure more of it. So the horse to do work 
must have muscular energy. His muscles are formed 
from the food that he eats. 
Food Supply and Special Products.—The milk cow 
must have more food than the one that gives no milk. 
She must have food to build up her body, to repair the 
waste, to keep her warm, to furnish her with energy, 
and, besides this, she must have additional food out of 
which to make milk. Let her food supply decrease 
and she will at once show it in the reduced amount 
of milk that she gives. You have all noticed this 
shrinkage when the pastures get “short” in summer. 
So, too, the sheep must have extra food out of which 
to make wool, and the hen requires special food from 
which to make eggs. 
Kind of Food Needed Varies.—Ilf a man were to 
start a shoe factory he would buy leather, pegs, nails 
and thread. These are the raw materials out of which
-P-A-G-E-100
100 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
he makes shoes. If he were to start a chair factory 
he would buy lumber instead. That is, his selection 
of material would depend upon the kind of product he 
expected to manufacture. It is just the same in the 
feeding of farm animals. If milk is to be produced, 
then foods that make milk must be fed. If eggs are 
wanted, hens must be fed egg-producing foods. If 
work is to be done, then foods which make energy 
must be supplied. The horse is a machine to do 
work, the hen an egg-making machine, the cow a milk 
factory. Different foods are the raw materials; eggs 
and milk, the manufactured products. 
Importance of Right Selection of Foods.—But, you 
say, we know that lumber is needed to make chairs; 
leather, nails and thread necessary in the manufacture 
of shoes; but we don’t know what will make milk and 
eggs. Well, you have grasped at the question that 
underlies the whole system of feeding, and until the 
farmer determines for himself the best and most eco- 
nomical food to be used in order to produce the de- 
sired results farming will not pay him its largest re- 
turns. 
Classification of Foods.—Foods are conveniently di- 
vided into three classes—fats, protein and carbohy- 
drates. These are big words, but they are easily un- 
derstood. 
Fats.—Butter, lard, tallow, and all kinds of oils 
come under the head of fats. 
Protein.—The white of an egg is almost pure pro- 
tein; the sticky part of flour is protein; the scum on the
-P-A-G-E-101
  FEEDING THE STOCK 101 
top of boiled milk is protein; the principal part of 
cheese, the curd, is protein; lean meat. is composed 
largely of protein; glue is protein; the hide, hair, wool 
and feathers of animals are largely protein. You all 
know the odor of burned feathers; any kind of sub- 
e

stance that scorches and gives off that odor contains 
protein. 
Carbohydrates.—Starch, sugar and vegetable fiber 
are called carbohydrates. In a certain sense fats, too, 
are carbohydrates, but they are usually put in a class   
 
-P-A-G-E-102
102 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
by themselves. When carbohydrates are spoken of in 
this book fats are meant to be included. 
Difference Between Protein Foods and Carbo- 
hydrates.—Now, the great difference between protein 
foods and the carbohydrates is this: Protein contains 
nitrogen and the carbohydrates do not. Nitrogen, as 
you will remember, is the substance taken from the air 
by the bacteria on the roots of the legumes and added 
to the soil. You will also remember it as the principal 
one of the three plant foods that become exhausted 
from the soil. 
Balanced Ratiton.—By consulting the table at the 
end of this chapter you will readily learn the amount 
of protein and carbohydrates in the different feeding 
stuffs. A “balanced” ration is one in which there is 
about six times as much carbohydrates as protein. A 
ration containing a larger proportion of carbohydrates 
is called a ‘“‘wide” ration; one containing less than six 
times as much carbohydrates as protein is called a 
“narrow” ration. By a balanced ration we mean the 
best ration to feed under ordinary conditions. For dry 
feeds the combined weight of both the protein and the 
carbohydrates should be equal to at least one-half the 
total weight of the ration. 
Different Uses of Foods.—Foods rich in protein are 
bone and muscle-formers. Those rich in carbohydrates 
are fat formers. Carbohydrates keep the body warm. 
If muscle is to be built up, then muscle-forming foods 
should be fed. Farmers have learned that corn alone 
is a good grain for horses only in the winter time. The
-P-A-G-E-103
  FEEDING THE STOCK 103 
reason is plain. Corn is rich in carbohydrates. These 
supply heat and produce fat. Oats are rich in protein, 
a muscle-builder, and furnish energy. In spring time 
it is muscle and energy that is wanted, not heat and 
fat. 
Special Foods Needed.—Sheep need food rich in 
protein. Why? Wool is to be produced. Wool is com- 
posed principally of protein. Hens are expected to 
lay eggs. What should they be fed? Corn produces 
fat. A strictly corn diet should therefore be avoided. 
Eggs are composed largely of protein. Feed protein 
foods. The shells are composed of mineral matter. 
Lime, broken or ground bone, ashes and gravel should 
always be where the hens can get at them. In gen- 
eral: Nature has provided, in summer, proper foods 
for most farm animals, and the nearer summer condi- 
tions can be duplicated the greater will be the farmer’s 
success. 
Special Proportions—Pigs fed exclusively on a 
corn diet sometimes have weak bones. Why?  Be- 
cause there is not enough mineral matter in corn out 
of which to make strong bones. Growing pigs should 
be fed protein foods, with plenty of mineral matter 
in them to form bone and muscle. Later, when fatten- 
ing time comes, fat producing foods, like corn, should 
be fed. In most foods there is an abundance of carbo- 
hydrates. The chief difficulty will be to provide suf- 
ficient protein to bring the ratio up to six to one; that 
is, so that there will not be more than six times as
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
much carbohydrates as there is protein in the ration. 
In other words, for every six pounds of carbohydrates 
there should be at least one pound of protein. For 
young and growing animals it should be considerably 
more than that. 
As has been stated, fat is usually put in a class by 
itself, and not grouped with the carbohydrates as it is 
in this book. This is one reason: One pound of fat 
will produce about 2%4 times as much heat and energy 
as one pound of carbohydrates, so that one pound of 
fat is equal to 214 pounds of carbohydrates in feeding 
value. If we have 1 lb. of fat, 334 lbs. of carbo- 
hydrates and 1 |b. of protein in a given ration, we have 
a ratio of 6 to 1. In the following table the fat has 
already been added to the carbohydrates, so that, in 
order to find the nutritive ratio, it will only be neces- 
sary for you to use the following rule: Divide the 
total amount of carbohydrates in the ration by the total 
amount of proteim. 
If the result is greater than 6, more protein should 
be added. ‘This ratio is generally considered the best 
for all animals except those that are fattening, when a 
- larger amount of cheaper carbohydrates can be fed 
with profit. Full grown animals can get along very 
well on a much smaller proportion of protein, while 
young, growing animals require a larger proportion 
than this, because protein is a bone and muscle builder. 
Economy im Feeding.—The great problem of eco- 
nomical feeding is to find those foods that will pro- 
duce the desired results with the least possible expense.
-P-A-G-E-105
  FEEDING THE STOCK 108 
It is not necessarily the cheapest foods that will do 
this. 
The Use of Scales.—In this connection, it may be 
well to call attention to the farm scales, something 
that should be found on every well-regulated farm. 
The farmer may, then, from time to time, experiment 
with different feeds, both as to quantity and kind, and 
by frequent weighings of the animals so fed, determine 
the effect of such feeding. Besides, scales are very 
handy in selling produce, weighing milk and in a thou- 
sand and one other ways. They are comparatively in- 
expensive, and will, with proper use, pay for them- 
selves in a very short time. 
Experimental Study of Foods. 
1. Starch and sugar are pure carbohydrates. Get 
some samples of these, label them and start a collec- 
tion of carbohydrates. Add to this collection samples 
of foods rich in sugar and starch. Corn, wheat, rye, 
barley, mixed hay, silage, and all kinds of straw may 
be classed as carbohydrate foods. Place these sam- 
ples in bottles and label them properly. 
2. To test seeds for starch, pulverize the seeds, boil 
them in water for some time, and soak a piece of cot- 
‘ton cloth in the water. Take out the cloth, dry, and 
iron it. Is it stiff or ‘starchy’? If so, where did the 
starch come from? | , 
3. Test corn, oats, wheat and rye for starch. Pul- 
verize a few seeds, pour over them a little boiling 
water, let stand a short time, and add a drop of iodine.
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
If the seeds contain starch, the water will suddenly 
turn blue or black. This is a very delicate and pretty 
experiment, 
4. Many seeds contain sugar, for which every one 
knows the simplest test. To make the test sure, mas- 
tication should be slow and thorough. Even a slightly 
sweet taste indicates the presence of sugar. Test 
wheat, oats, corn, peas, squash seeds, and pumpkin 
seeds. 
5. All seeds contain some protein. Every one knows 
the odor of burning feathers. This disagreeable odor 
is caused by the burning of the protein in the feather. 
Remove the germ from a kernel of corn and scorch it 
Over a spirit lamp or on the stove. Does it give off an 
odor like that of burning feathers? If so, it contains 
protein. Test other seeds for protein. 
6. Lean meat, the white of egg, wheat bran, oats, 
peas, middlings, cheese, malt sprouts, and clover hay 
are all rich in protein and may be properly called pro- | 
tein foods. Add these to your collection, labeling them 
properly. To preserve the meat, eggs, and cheese 
they should be placed in dilute alcohol. 
7. Nearly all small seeds contain much oil. To test 
for oil, crush the seeds on a piece of clean, white 
paper. If they leave a grease spot, the seeds contain 
oil. For further test, crush the seeds on a piece of 
white paper, and heat gently in the oven, being care- 
ful not to scorch the paper. A grease spot on the 
paper shows oil. Test flax seed, wheat, beans, sun- 
flower seeds, and any kind of nut for oil.

Again dividing (60 by 9.4) we get 6.3, about right, and a much 
cheaper feed. Now, how much of this ration shall we feed to a 
dairy cow? ‘The table shows us that a cow needs about 2 lbs. 
protein daily, so this will be about enough for five days. One- 
fifth of each feed will give us as a result 20 lbs. of hay and 6 lbs. 
of peas for the daily ration.

  CHAPTER XV 
THE THREE C’S—COWS, CORN AND CLOVER 
  Diversified Farming.—All who understand the con- 
ditions are agreed that diversified farming will yield | 
the largest returns with least waste to the fertility of 
the soil. But what is meant by diversified farming? 
When a farmer grows wheat to sell, and little else, 
that may be called wheat farming. If he depends upon 
tobacco alone, we call that tobacco farming. If he 
plants his entire farm to corn and feeds it to hogs for 
the market, we may properly call that kind of farming 
corn and hog farming. Whenever he engages in two 
‘or more kinds of farming his work becomes “diversi- 
fied.” The greater the number of different things he 
raises the greater the diversification. 
Clover.—But we have agreed that it is not a good 
thing to raise grain or tobacco exclusively, for the 
market. We have learned that this kind of farming 
soon wears out the soil, and does not pay in the long 
run. We have learned, too, that milk products con- 
tain little soil matter and are therefore easy on the 
soil. We have observed that the animals usually sold 
off the farm contain but small quantities of soil matter 
in proportion to the feed that they consume. We now 
know that clover feeds upon the free nitrogen of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE THREE C’S—COWS, CORN AND CLOVER 113 
air, and thus increases the store of nitrogen in the soil. 
We have learned that nitrogen is the principal ingre- 
dient in protein, the feed most sought after by the pro- 
gressive farmer. From an examination of the table, 
we find that clover hay is richer in protein than any 
  COWS IN A CLOVER FIELD. 
other kind of hay. A little calculation shows us that 
it contains about twice as much protein as redtop, 
three times as much as timothy, eight times as much 
as oat straw, fifteen times as much as rye straw, and 
thirty times as much as wheat straw. On average 
land a larger amount of clover, or some other legume 
adapted to the soil, can be grown per acre than of any 
other hay crop, and, since it adds nitrogen to the soil, 
it is by far the best hay crop to raise. 
Corn.—Another examination of the table reveals 
the fact that corn is one of the richest of grains, and 
since corn is one of the richest of fodders in feeding
-P-A-G-E-114
  114 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
value, and the yield is heavy, corn is an excellent crop 
to raise. 
Cows.—Cows are a constant source of income to 
the farmer, and, at the same time, they supply him 
with the cheapest and best of fertilizers. You will re- 
member that if the manure from a single cow were 
carefully saved during the year and applied to the soil 
its value as fertilizer would be nearly $20, besides im- 
proving the texture of the soil to a marked degree. 
A Good Combination.—Cows, corn and clover are a 
splendid combination for other reasons. Corn requires 
frequent cultivation and the soil is improved thereby. 
Weeds are exterminated, the ground is plowed deeper, 
and the manure is thoroughly mixed with the soil. 
Besides being an excellent feeding stuff, and adding 
nitrogen to the soil, clover is a splendid crop to sow 
with oats, following corn, offering an excellent oppor- 
tunity for rotation of crops, the advantages of which 
have already been pointed out. 
Other Advantages of the Three C’s.—With cows, 
corn and clover, the raising of sheep and hogs is made 
possible and profitable. The cows and clover furnish 
milk and pasture for the growing animals, while corn 
is one of the best of fat-producers. Tobacco raising 
can also be engaged in, if the farmer is careful not to 
exhaust the fertility of his soil by too frequent crop- 
ping with tobacco. Cotton is a source of good income 
to the farmer, provided the lint only is sold, and the 
meal from the cotton seed is returned to the soil.
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE THREE C’S—COWS, CORN AND CLOVER 115 
Cotton lint, like butter, is formed from the food matter 
which the plants get from the air and the water; but 
it must be remembered that cotton is a heavy feeder 
and, if the return of the meal is impossible, it, like 
tobacco, will soon wear out the soil.

that the system of diversified farming outlined here is 
necessarily the best system. The greatest flexibility is 
allowable, depending upon the location of the farm, 
the character of the soil, nearness to factories and 
markets, and various other conditions. But it is easily 
seen that in Tennessee, at least, cows, corn and clover 
should form the basis of any system of diversified 
farming.

with hay at $7, corn at 40 cents and oats at 30 cents? 
3. What will it cost to keep a herd of 12 cows for 
200 days on this ration? 
4. On another farm, timothy hay, oat straw, bran 
and oats are mixed in the following proportions: One 
ton each of hay and straw, 20 bushels of oats and 1,000 
pounds of bran. Is this a balanced ration? 
5. How long will this ration keep a cow? A herd 
of 15 cows? |

corn-oats ration gave 20 pounds of milk daily, while 
those fed on the hay-straw-oats-bran ration gave but 
15 pounds of milk daily. With milk at 80 cents per

CHAPTER XVI 
THE DAIRY 
The Products of the Dairy —Muilk, butter and cheese 
are the products of the dairy. Whether the farmer 
should sell his milk, or make it into butter or cheese, 
depends upon nearness to factories and markets, the 
relative price of milk products, and other local condi- 
tions. It must be constantly kept in mind that the 
sale of milk to consumers takes from the farm all the 
soil elements found in whole milk. The sale of 
cheese returns a portion of soil fertility with the whey, 
while the sale of butter removes practically nothing 
of a soil nature. The milk required to produce a ton 
of butter contains about 450 pounds of fertilizing sub- 
stances; the cheese made from the same amount of 
milk contains about half as much of such substances, 
and the butter that this milk will produce contains less 
than five pounds of soil fertility. The reason is plain. 
Butter-fat is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates, you 
will remember, come from the air and the water, not 
from the soil. Hence, with milk at the same price per 
hundred at both butter and cheese factories, it is far 
better to make butter than cheese for the market.
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE DAIRY 119 
Again, when butter is made, the skim milk is available 
to feed on the farm. Whey is of much less feeding 
value. 
The Milk Scparator.—The use of the milk separator 
is increasing. This machine is a great time-saver. 
The skim milk may be fed warm and sweet, soon after 
being drawn from the cow. Only the cream need be 
hauled to the factory, and that but two or three times 
a week. 
  JERSEY COW. 
Cleanliness in the Dairy.—Cleanliness is the watch- 
word of the dairy. This cannot be too strongly stated. 
Good milk, pure milk, sweet milk is essential, if good 
butter and cheese, capable of commanding the highest 
market prices, are to be made. Milk and milk prod- 
ucts are spoiled by bad flavors and bad odors. Bad 
flavors and bad odors in milk are caused by the cows’ 
eating improper food and drinking impure water, and 
by uncleanliness on the part of the dairyman in the
-P-A-G-E-120
120 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
care of the milk. Milk cows should not be allowed to 
drink stagnant or muddy water, or to eat “tainted” 
food, as musty hay, cabbage, rape, garlic, wild onions, 
or ragweed. These will certainly impart a bad odor 
and a bad flavor to the milk, which the most careful 
handling will not remove. 
Bad Odors in Milk.—In the second place, milk is a 
very great absorbent, and should never be allowed to 
  HOLSTEIN-FRIESIAN COW. 
stand around the barn, or in any other place where the 
air is filled with bad odors. 
Bacteria in Milk.—But the most fruitful source of 
bad milk is uncleanliness on the part of the dairyman 
in the care of the cow, and of the milking utensils. 
Milk should be kept pure and sweet. Sour milk, or 
bad milk, is caused by tiny bacteria, too small to be 
seen with the naked eye; in fact, so small that they can
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE DAIRY I2I 
only be seen with the aid of the strongest microscopes. 
Under favorable conditions these bacteria increase in 
numbers very rapidly. They seem to thrive best in 
warm, damp weather. They live everywhere—on the 
hay, in the bedding, on the clothes and hands of the 
milker, on the cow’s hair, in the milk cans and pails, 
and in the air. New milk, freshly drawn from the 
    RED POLLED COW. 
cow, contains none of these bacteria, but they soon 
get into it and begin at once their rapid multiplication. 
When they have increased sufficiently in numbers, the 
milk begins to smell and taste sour and “bad.” Only 
care and cleanliness will prevent these bacteria from 
getting into the milk. If the bacteria are kept out, 
the milk will keep sweet for a long time. Heating it
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
to the temperature of 150 degrees kills these germs, 
and is one common way of keeping milk sweet. 
Necessary Precautions —The milker should see to 
it that his hands are clean. Before sitting down to

milk he should carefully brush from the cow all dust, 
dirt, dandruff and loose hair likely to fall into the 
pail. He should have his milking clothes frequently 
washed and scalded to destroy the bacteria thereon, 
and he should remove the milk to a clean place, where 
the air is pure and free from bacteria, as soon as he

  THE DAIRY 123 
possibly can. Aerating the milk—that is, allowing it 
to drain slowly through a strainer placed several feet 
above the can, where pure air can blow through it as 
it falls—will do much to remove any bad odors it may 
already contain. Pails and cans should be kept scru- 
pulously clean. They should be rinsed with boiling 
water after each milking to kill all bacteria that may

(Edgewood Farm.) 
adhere to them. If little particles of milk are allowed 
to stick to the rough places in the cans and pails, it is 
impossible to keep milk sweet in them, because the 
bacteria live and multiply in these particles. As soon 
as pure milk is placed in such utensils, these germs at 
once begin their rapid increase, and the milk spoils 
in a few hours. The whole secret of keeping milk
-P-A-G-E-124
124 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
sweet lies in preventing the bacteria from getting 
into it. 
Selection of the Herd.—Next in importance to the 
care of the milk comes the selection of the herd. Since 
most creameries and cheese factories now pay by the 
test—that is, pay for the amount of butter-fat that 
the milk contains—it is important to the dairyman that 
his milk tests well, and that his cows give a reasonably 
large flow of milk. In general, no cow is profitable to 
the dairyman whose milk tests much less than 3 per 
cent of butter-fat. Neither is one which gives less 
than twelve pounds of milk daily, no matter how rich 
it is. Every farmer should own a small Babcock tester 
and test every cow in his herd. Such a tester, with 
directions and complete outfit for testing milk, can be 
tought for six or seven dollars. Each cow in the herd 
should be tested, her milk carefully weighed and her 
dairy value figured out. All unprofitable cows should 
be disposed of. The best cows in the herd may then 
be kept for breeding purposes. In this way the herd 
will be greatly improved and dairying made much more 
profitable. 
Experimental Study of Milk. 
In all comparisons of milk, samples should be taken 
under the same conditions and set at exactly the same 
depth. Test tubes are most convenient for experi- 
ments with milk. If bottles are used they should be 
tall and slender, and as nearly the same size as pos- 
sible. Sample bottles should never be filled above the
-P-A-G-E-125
    
THE DAIRY 125 
point where the bottle begins to narrow towards the 
neck. 
1. Compare samples of milk from different cows, 
noting the color. 
2. Follow directions given above in the prepara- 
tion of samples. Set them aside in a cool place for 
twenty-four hours. Compare the thickness of the. 
cream layers, being careful not to disturb the milk. 
Measure the cream with a rule. Which is the richest 
milk? What color was it when first set? What is 
always the color of very rich milk? What is the color 
of poor milk? 
3. Take a sample of the first milk drawn from a 
cow, and another sample of the “strippings’’ from the 
same cow. : Place these samples in separate bottles, 
being careful to fill the bottles to exactly the same 
depth. Note the color of each. Set them aside in a 
_ cool place for twenty-four hours and then compare the 
thickness of the cream layers. 
4. After a quantity of milk has stood in a can for 
thirty minutes, take a sample from the top of the can. 
Then plunge the dipper to the bottom and get a sample 
from near the bottom of the can. Place these sam- 
ples in bottles as before, note the color, and set aside 
for the cream to rise. Compare the thickness of the 
cream layers at the end of twenty-four hours. Which 
is the richer? Explain. 
5. Take two samples of milk from the same sup- 
ply, under the same conditions. Set one in a very 
cool place and the other in a warm place, for a few
-P-A-G-E-126
126 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
hours, and compare the thickness of the cream layers. 
Set aside for a few hours and compare again. What 
difference do you observe? 
6. Into an unwashed bottle in which milk has been 
allowed to sour place a sample of fresh, sweet milk. 
Into another bottle that has been carefully cleaned 
and scalded place another sample from the same sup- 
ply. Set the samples side by side in a warm room and 
smell and taste them at intervals of from four to six 
hours. Record definitely the differences in preserva- 
tion of the two samples. 
7. Take two samples from the same supply of 
fresh, sweet milk, and place them in dishes that have 
been carefully cleaned and scalded. Set one dish over 
night in the barn, or in some other place where the 
air is filled with bad odors. Set the other sample in 
the open air or in a well ventilated place where there 
can be no bad odors. Smell and taste of both next 
morning. Has the bad odor affected the taste or odor 
of the milk? From this experiment what do you 
infer regarding the effects of bad air upon milk to be 
used in making butter, or cheese, or for any other 
purpose?

  CHAPTER XVII 
POULTRY 
Frofit in Poultry-Raising.—There is no department 
of diversified farming that yields larger returns for 
the labor and money expended than the poultry yard, 
if properly handled. No farmer tries to get along 
without chickens, and many farmers’ wives and chil- 
dren are made happy by the revenue derived from a 
flock of turkeys, ducks or geese. But poultry-raising 
has not been given sufficient attention on many Amer- 
ican farms. ‘There is no more wholesome or nutritious 
article of food than eggs, and by most people poultry 
is highly esteemed as an article of diet. ‘There is a 
steady demand for fresh eggs, and well-fattened young 
fowls always bring a high price in the market. On 
many farms the money received from the sale of 
eggs and poultry amounts to several hundred dollars 
annually. . 
The labor involved in this industry is of a kind that 
can easily be done by women and children. The feed 
required is raised on every farm, and the necessary 
buildings are cheap and easily built. All these factors 
tend to make poultry-raising very profitable when 
thoughtfully and intelligently pursued.
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
Care of Poultry—lIlf necessary, chickens may be 
confined to somewhat narrow limits, but ducks, geese 
and turkeys usually thrive best when given free range 
of the farm. The reason for this is plain. Fowls are 
insect and seed eaters, and, when allowed to roam, 
select the kinds of insects and seeds which they like 
best. But, when kept in confinement, man forces them 
to eat the things he provides; and, unless a special 
study has been made of poultry foods, they may not 
always be the ones the fowls themselves would select. 
Again, as has been said in another chapter, if hens are 
to lay eggs, they must be fed egg-producing foods. 
If confined they should have constant access to a box 
of grits, oyster shells, gravel, lime, charcoal, sand, 
ground bone, and the like, to be used in grinding their 
food, and out of which to make eggshells. They 
should be fed meat scraps, skim-milk, barley, refuse 
from the table, and other foods rich in protein out of 
which to make eggs. In winter time, green foods like 
cabbage, turnips, and silage should be given to them. 
Foods.—To repeat what has been said in another 
place: ‘Nature has provided in summer proper foods 
for most farm animals, and the nearer summer condi- 
tions can be duplicated the greater will be the farmer’s 
success.” The winter food of chickens should, there- 
fore, consist of four kinds—minerals, which they get 
by scratching in summer;.meat, to take the place of 
summer insects; grains; and green foods. Ungrate- 
ful, indeed, would be the hen who did not respond to 
this diet with a liberal return of eggs.
-P-A-G-E-131
  POULTRY 131 
Insects as Food for Fowls.—One other fact in con- 
nection with the food of fowls is deserving of special 
emphasis here. Since their food consists so largely 
of seeds and insects, it is quite evident that they are 
worth all it costs to keep them in the assistance which 
they give to the farmer in devouring seeds of weeds 
and in holding insect pests in check. 
  HEN HONORS. 
The Poultry House.—Like other farm animals, 
fowls must be protected from cold and storms. Their 
houses should be large, light, airy, clean, and dry. 
Chickens should have a “scratching place’ where they 
can get to dry dirt and scratch and wallow in it. -Dust 
acts as a sort of insect powder, filling up the insect’s 
breathing pores, and thus keeps the chickens free from 
lice. It is important that chickens have plenty of exer-
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
cise, and this they can get in wintcr if they have a 
warm and dry place where they can go to scratch. It 
is a common practice among poultry raisers to force 
them to scratch for their food by strewing it over a 
floor thickly covered with chaff or short straw. 
Cleanliness in Care of Poultry.—Poultry houses 
should be frequently cleaned and whitewashed to keep 
them free from bad odors and vermin. They should 
be well lighted by a row of windows, placed along the 
south side, and they should be built sufficiently warm 
to prevent the freezing of the chickens’ combs and feet. 
Above all else, they should be kept perfectly dry to 
avoid disease. 
Laying Qualities of Poultry.—In the wild state, the 
hen laid but one setting of a dozen or fifteen eggs a 
year. This number has been greatly increased by 
domestication until the “two-hundred-egg-a-year”’ hen 
is considered an easy possibility by many poultry rais- 
ers. If farmers will use care in selecting only the eggs 
from the most prolific layers for setting, they can, 
without doubt, greatly improve the laying qualities of 
their flock. Much, however, depends upon the selec- 
tion of a breed. 
Varieties of Foods.—The variety selected for farm 
use will depend largely upon the purpose for which 
the fowls are grown. There are some varieties espe- 
cially desirable for their laying qualities, others are 
adapted to the needs of the early spring chicken mar- 
ket, and still others which may be called general pur- 
pose fowls. The intelligent farmer informs himself as

to the respective merits of the several breeds and 
selects the one best adapted to his needs. What is 
true in the selection of a variety of chickens is equally 
true of turkeys, ducks and geese and is left to the 
intelligent action of the farmer without further com- 
ment here. The bulletins named below will be of great

  CHAPTER XX 
SPECIAL CROPS 
Four Special Crops.—There are a few special crops, 
which, because of their increasing importance in agri- 
culture, demand our attention. Four of these will be 
considered in this chapter—tobacco, soy beans, pota- 
toes and truck crops. All of these crops are grown in 
the United States today, but, with the- exception of 
potatoes, not in sufficient quantities to supply the de- 
mand. Until we do raise enough for home consump- 
tion, these crops will yield larger returns to the farmer 
than the other crops grown on the farm. | 
TOBACCO. 
Tobacco a Heavy Feeder.—As we have already 
learned, tobacco is a heavy feeder and hard on the 
soil. With every crop of tobacco sold off the farm 
about twice as much fertility is removed as with any 
erain crop that the farmer raises for market. But we 
have agreed that grain farming does not pay. How 
much more unprofitable, then, is it for the farmer to 
raise tobacco extensively. There is but one way in 
which he can keep up the fertility of his soil, and that
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
is by the use of commercial fertilizers. In this way 
soil matter is bought and brought back to the farm to 
take the place of that sold with the tobacco. Extensive 
experiments have been made at the different agricul- 
tural stations to determine the kind and amount of 
  A TYPICAL TOBACCO FIELD. 
(Oconto County, Wisconsin.) 
these fertiliers to use. The results show that they are 
even better than barnyard manure for this crop. The 
only way that the farmer can find out the kind and 
amount best adapted to his soil is by careful experi- 
ment. It must be remembered, however, that com- 
mercial fertilizers tend to harden the soil, while barn- 
yard manure improves its texture.
-P-A-G-E-137
    SPECIAL CROPS 137 
Kind of Soil Required.——Tobacco requires fertile, 
well-drained soil, rich in humus. Not every soil will 
grow good tobacco. Even on the same farm, places 
are found which seem to be especially adapted to its 
growth. Herein another danger lies. The farmer is 
likely to grow tobacco, year after year, on this same 
piece of land until its fertility is exhausted, or else he 
has robbed the rest of his farm by putting all of his 
fertilizers on his tobacco land. Again, such conditions 
make crop rotation impracticable. 
Cultivation.—Moreover, tobacco requires thorough 
cultivation and careful attention in harvesting and cur- 
ing. These things are best learned by actual practice, 
and a discussion of them is beyond the province of this 
book. 
SUGAR BEETS. 
Beets Compared with Other Plants—Beets, like to- 
bacco, are heavy feeders, and, Itke tobacco, require 
thorough cultivation. Unlike tobacco, however, they 
can be grown so as to retain the fertility of the soil. 
Sugar is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates, you will 
remember, are made by the plant from the air and the 
water which the plant uses. If the beets are shipped 
to the factory, the sugar extracted there, and the pulp 
returned to be fed on the farm or used as a fertilizer. 
the soil has lost nothing. It is much the same as if 
the tobacco ashes were brought back to the farm. With 
tobacco, however, this is impossible, but with beets it
-P-A-G-E-138
138 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
is possible to return the pulp, and this should always 
be done. 
Advantages of Beets—Sugar beets have still other 
advantages over tobacco. In the first place, the price 
is fixed by the factory before the beets are planted. 
The factory usually contracts to give about $4.50 per 
ton for beets that test 14 per cent of sugar, with an 
additional 25 cents per ton for each additional I per 
cent of sugar. Thus beets testing 15 per cent will 
bring $4.75 per ton, and beets testing 16 per cent will 
bring $5 per ton. They will usually agree to ship the 
pulp back to the farmer at a small cost, say 25 cents 
per ton. The farmer knows just what price he is 
going to get for his crop. What his land brings him 
per acre depends upon his own efforts, and he will 
then bend all his energies toward producing a high 
test and a big yield. With other crops a big general 
yield usually means a low price, but a big crop of beets 
does not affect the price. 
Again, beets require less care than tobacco. They 
do not need to be housed or cured. No capital need 
be invested in sheds or curing rooms. 
In the third place, they can be grown successfully 
on a large variety of soils, and they furnish, when 
the pulp is returned to the farm, an excellent food for 
stock. 
In the fourth place, their long roots, and the deep 
cultivation required, bring to the surface fertility from 
deep down in the soil. In Germany, several years 
after their cultivation was introduced, more grain was 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
SPECIAL CROPS 139 
grown per acre on land where the beets had been culti- 
vated than could possibly have been grown before 
their cultivation was begun. 
A comparison of beets and tobacco gives the prefer- 
ence to beets as a farm crop. They grow well on 
tobacco land and are an excellent crop to be used in 
  SUGAR BEETS. 
rotation with it. Their cultivation is easily fearned, 
and they are less exposed to injury from storms, in- 
sects and plant diseases. 
POTATO. 
The Best Soil for Potatoes.—Potatoes of the best 
quality are grown on light, sandy land, rich in humus, 
Heavy clay soils do not give way readily as the pota- 
toes increase in size, hence will produce smaller 
potatoes. 
Yield of Potatoes.—This crop yields heavily, five 
hundred bushels per acre being not unusual. Potatoes
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
should be planted about four inches deep, in rows 
three feet apart, and about two feet apart in the row. . 
Extensive experiments, carried on by the different 
agricultural stations, show that the seed potatoes 
should be cut in halves or quarters. When the price 
of seed potatoes is very high, they may be cut in 
smaller pieces of as nearly equal size as possible. No 
bad results have come from planting small potatoes, 
though one would naturally think that small potatoes, 
used as seed, would give small potatoes in return. It 
must be remembered, however, that the potato is not 
a seed, but an underground stem, and that it does not 
bear the same relation to the crop that the seed does. 
Like the seed, it serves as a storehouse for the growing 
plant, and if the pieces are of sufficient size to furnish 
this food matter, the next crop will not be affected by 
the size of the potato planted. 
Prevention of Potato Rot—To prevent rot or blight 
the seed should be rolled in sulphur, the vines sprayed 
with Bordeaux mixture as soon as blight appears, and 
rotation of crops practiced. In no case should pota- 
toes be planted on the same ground where the previous 
crop has been affected, as the spores are in the soil 
and will surely attack them. 
ONIONS. 
Advantages of Raising Onions.—Not enough onions 
are grown in the United States to supply the demand. 
Millions of bushels are annually imported. They yield 
heavily, sometimes as much as a thousand bushels per
-P-A-G-E-141
SPECIAL CROPS 141 
acre, and they are not hard to grow. The greatest 
cost of their cultivation is labor, but of a kind that a 
child can easily do. Onion raising offers to the chil- 
dren on the farm a splendid opportunity to make their 
spending money, and for that reason it is discussed 
here. One-fourth of an acre set to onions should

yield 100 bushels, which, if the market is good, will 
bring them from $50 to $75. Hard, indeed, would be 
the farmer who would not give to his children so small 
a patch of ground on which to grow onions, and time 
enough to cultivate them. 
Kind of Soil Needed.—Onions, like tobacco, require 
a fertile soil, rich in humus, but they need considerably 
more moisture. In the northern states the seed should 
be sown in boxes in early spring, and the young plants
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
transplanted as soon as the ground is in fit condition. 
There are several reasons for this: In the first place, 
onions grow very slowly, and, if sown in the ground, 
the weeds become too large and thick before the young 
onions are large enough to cultivate. In the next 
place, they can be transplanted the right distance 
apart and do not rob each other of plant food, as they 
would before thinning, if sown in the row. In the 
third place, onions require a large amount of mois- 
ture, and if started in the house or hotbed the plants 
may be set out in time to get all the benefit of the 
spring rains. It has been shown that transplanting 
will double the yield. 
How to Plant Onions.—They should be set in rows 
from a foot to eighteen inches apart, and the plants 
should be placed about four inches apart in the row. 
The soil should be heavily fertilized, and very thor- 
oughly prepared. Ail lumps should be broken and 
the surface made smooth. The rows may be laid off 
by stretching a line across the plat. The plat may 
be marked out along the string by rolling a wooden 
wheel (an old wagon wheel with the tire remeved 
will answer), on whose edge wooden pegs about three 
inches long and four inches apart have been set. The 
plants should be placed in the holes made by the pegs 
and the soil pressed firmly around their roots. 
Onion Cultivation—The cultivation can be done 
with a steady horse, if the rows are far enough apart, 
with a hand cultivator or with a hoe. Success depends
-P-A-G-E-143
  SPECIAL CROPS 143 
upon cultivation. The soil should be frequently stirred, 
and it must be kept absolutely free from weeds. 
When Ready for Harvest—When the tops are dead 
and dry the crop is ready for harvest. The onions 
should be pulled, carefully cleaned, dried in the sun for 
a few hours and stored away in a cool, dry place until 
ready for market. If they are placed in bushel boxes 
with lath sides they will keep in good condition. 
Best Varieties of Onions——yYellow Danvers, Early 
Reds, Red Wethersfields, Yellow Globe and Prizetak- 
ers are the standard varieties. The first named is the 
heaviest yielder, an onion of excellent flavor and sells 
well on the market.

  CHAPTER XIX 
FARM BUILDINGS 
Number and Kinds of Buildings.—That good, sub- 
stantial buildings are needed on every farm goes with- 
out saying. ‘The number and kind, of course, vary 
with the size and location of the farm, and the special 
crops raised thereon. But a good house, barn, gran- 
ary, silo, carriage and tool house are almost indis- 
pensable on every farm. 
Attention to Arrangement.—Usually too little at- 
tention is given to the arrangement of these buildings, 
and, when they once have been placed, it is next to 
impossible to correct the bad effect of poor arrange- 
ment. The barn in front of the house, or on the wind- 
ward side of it, the hog house in front of the house, 
the barnyard between the house and the barn, the 
carriage house opening into the barnyard, and the 
vegetable garden in the dooryard, are some of the 
common mistakes. 
Location of the House.—The location of the house 
should receive first attention. It should be placed on 
an elevation sufficient to afford good drainage, four 
or five rods back from the road, leaving room for a
-P-A-G-E-147
FARM BUILDINGS 147 
nice lawn in front. The barn should be placed at one 
side and farther back from the road. If possible, it 
should be so located that the prevailing wind will carry 
the barn odors away from the house. The barnyard

should be in the rear of the barn so that the view 
from the house will be unobstructed by high board 
fences, stables or sheds. A drive should lead from 
the road to the barn, and the horse stable and car- 
riage house should open onto this drive, so that the

through the barnyard every time they hitch up a 
team. A walk of cinders, gravel or sand should lead 
from the house to the barn. Such a walk is cheap, 
easily built, and -will always be clean and compara- 
tively dry. The vegetable garden can be placed any-

where in the rear, near the house, where it will be 
convenient. The logical place for the well is between 
the barn and the house, where it can be used for both 
places, but not too near the barn. The silo should 
be attached to or near the barn, and, of course, the 
granary should be near by. Tool houses, tobacco 
sheds and all other outbuildings should be kept well
-P-A-G-E-149
  FARM BUILDINGS 149 
back from the road, so as not to obstruct the view 
from the house. 
The Construction of Buildings.—But little need be 
said about the construction of farm buildings. The 
careful farmer will adapt the buildings to the size of 
the farm, and his own special 
needs. The silo is the one 
farm building, however, that 
needs the most careful con- 
struction. The importance 
of silage as a feeding stuff 
is growing more apparent, 
but silage will not keep well 
in a poorly constructed silo. 
Whatever the type of silo 
the farmer chooses to build, 
four things must be ob- 
served: It must be air- 
tight, strong, perfectly 
smooth on the inside and 
placed on a strong, solid 
foundation. 
The Silo.—The silo must 
be air-tight, because the air 
contains germs that will set   SILO, VERTICAL SECTION.

this respect. Silage is something like: canned fruit, in

solidly packed down. This exerts a tremendous
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
side pressure which will spring or burst the walls 
of a poorly constructed silo and admit air, 
causing the silage to spoil. It must be perfectly 
smooth on the inside, because silage should settle 
evenly. Projections, or rough places on the inner 
walls of a silo, will prevent this even settling, cause 
dead air spaces, which spoil the silage. It must rest 
on a strong, solid foundation, because the side pres- 
sure and weight at the bottom are very great. This 
pressure may burst a heavy stone wall—and the great 
weight will cause a silo placed on a poor foundation 
to settle out of shape and crack the walls. 
Silage Is a Satisfactory Feed.—lf this building is so 
constructed as to provide for sufficient ventilation and 
to prevent freezing, and proper care is used in filling 
the silo, the silage will be a very satisfactory feed tc

CHAPTER XX 
FARM ACCOUNTS 
Keeping Accounts.—There are times when every 
farmer needs to keep accounts. Sometimes it is de- 
sirable to know just how much cash is received and 
paid out during the year. A simple CASH ACCOUNT 
will show this. All kinds of accounts require two 
columns. . These columns may be placed side by side 
at the right of the page, or the page may be divided 
with double ruling down its center, or two separate 
pages, facing each other, may be used. .Whichever 
kind of ruling is used, the accounts are all kept in 
exactly the same way. The divided page method is 
used in this book. | 
Cash Accounts.—In keeping a cash account the word 
CASH is first written across the top of the page. All 
cash received is placed in the cash space in the left 
hand side, and all cash paid out is placed in the cash 
space in the right hand side. At the extreme left of 
each side the date is placed, and between the date and 
the cash space the item, for which cash has been re- 
ceived or paid, is written. The total amount of cash 
received, or paid out, is easily found by adding the
-P-A-G-E-155
FARM ACCOUNTS 155 
amounts on each side, and the difference of these two 
sums represents the cash on hand. Cash on hand 
should be carried over into the received side at the 
top of the next page, when any page is filled up with 
entries. If it is desired, the TOTALS may be carried 
over into their respective columns instead, and the 
new page kept in exactly the same way as the pre- 
ceding page. This is all there is in keeping a cash 
account. It is a very simple and easy thing to do. 
For example:

he pays anything on this account, this entry is made 
in the right hand side under the word creditor, exactly 
the same as with a cash account. The dates and items 
are written im their proper places, which are the same 
as those for cash accounts. For example:

Suppose that on Sept. 22, 1905, you sell a pig to 
John Smith for $12.50, for which he agrees to pay 
either in money or in labor at $1.50 per day. He 
works on Oct. 1, 2 and 3. On Oct. 10 he pays $2 in 
cash, and on Oct. 25 he works another day. The

PRODUCE ACCOUNTS. 
Sometimes the farmer wishes to know his profits 
on his cows, tobacco, beets or other things produced 
on the farm. It often happens that his wife wants 
to keep account of her profits on berries or poultry. 
Such an account is called a PRODUCE account, and it 
is kept exactly like a personal account. Suppose that 
you want to keep an account of your chickens, The

  CHAPTER XXI 
FORESTRY 
Importance of the Forest—Next to the soil itself, 
no other part of the earth, or its furnishing, is of such 
importance to man as the forest. Indeed, without the 
forest, past and present, there would hardly be any 
tillable soil. But it is also our chief source of building 
material and of fuel. It is, moreover, the great gar- 
ment of the earth, protecting and adorning it. 
Nature of the Forest-——The forest is much more 
than a collection of independent trees; it is a great 
organism, composed of many: parts, or elements, each 
dependent on the others. It has a very complex and 
varied life, comprising not only trees and shrubs, but 
also herbs, flowers, mosses, lichens, birds, insects, and 
higher animals in great variety, all dependent for their 
very life upon their combination and mutual service, in 
the great living thing we call the forest. 
Influence of the Forest——The forest exercises a 
great influence upon the earth and its inhabitants out- 
side of the forest limits. It is often the source of 
streams, and controls the water supply of surrounding 
regions. It breaks the force of winds and tempers the
-P-A-G-E-162
162 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
climate. It supplies vegetable mold which is an in- 
dispensable element in fertile soil. And it affords 
recreation, and the highest forms of enjoyment to 
those who can get access to it. In short, the forest is 
one of man’s greatest blessings, and yet it is the one 
which he has abused with most recklessness and 
ignorance. And in no part of the world has this reck- 
less waste been greater than in the United States, and 
especially in the North Central states. 
  THE EDGE OF THE FOREST. 
Destruction of .the Forests—The forest was in~- 
tended for use, but it was meant to serve man for 
ages, and not to be destroyed in the lifetime of a man. 
The great causes which have wrecked the forests and 
wiped them from the earth to so great an extent are 
(1) unwise and unregulated cutting by lumbermen, 
and':(2) the prevalence of forest fires. These fires, 
occurring in seasons of drouth, are fed and made
-P-A-G-E-163
  FORESTRY | 163 
destructive by the brush and dead tree tops, left as 
wreckage on the ground, wherever logging has been 
carried on. The fires are often started by the criminal 
negligence of hunters and campers in not putting out 
all remains of their camp-fires, or in other careless 
ways. Some of these fires have done immense dam- 
age to the standing forest, and have caused great dis- 
tress and loss of human life. Among the most destruc- 
tive of these are the great Peshtigo fire of 1871, in 
Northeastern Wisconsin, and the Hinckley fire of 
1894, in Minnesota. 
The Economic Use of the Forest.—The science and 
art of forestry has for its purpose the perpetuation 
and, at the same time, the economical utilization of the 
forest. It teaches men how to keep the forest alive 
by cutting out only the trees that have got their growth 
and are ripe, in such a way as not to injure or endanger 
the remaining growth. The younger trees are thus 
given more light and air and room to grow, while the 
undergrowth is also preserved. The “forest floor” of 
decaying leaves, rotten wood, and other debris is pre- 
served as a means of enriching the soil and, especially, 
of retaining moisture and preventing the rains from 
running off too quickly in surface wash and floods. 
Forestry also teaches the best ways of replanting, or 
“re-foresting,” areas in which the timber has already 
been wastefully destroyed. This art of prudently man- 
aging timber lands, so as to keep up their blessings to 
their owners and others, has long been practiced in 
European countries, particularly in Germany, and has
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
proved of the greatest advantage. The people of the 
United States are just waking up to the necessity. of 
such a course, and the United States Department of 
Forestry is now doing excellent service in educating 
the people to greater intelligence and foresight in the 
management of such remnants of our once magnifi- 
cent forests as yet remain; though we are reminded of 
the old saying about locking the stable door after the 
horse is stolen. The new policy of our government in 
setting off Forest Reserves in the unsold lands of the 
Western States, particularly in the mountain regions, 
deserves the earnest approval and support of all citi- 
zens interested in the future welfare of our country. 
Lumbermen, generally, have blindly followed the ex- 
ample of the woman who killed the goose that laid 
the golden eggs; and the future good of our land ought 
not to be left longer at their mercy. 
The Wood Lot.—But we need not look upon for- 
estry as a matter which concerns only the far off 
forests of the North and West. Every farmer who 
has a “wood lot” left ought to understand its prin- 
ciples and apply them to his own possessions. 
Care of the Wood Lot.—The importance of caring 
for the farm wood lot cannot be too strongly empha- 
sized. When our country was new and land had to 
be cleared to make room for the crops, farmers cared 
little for timber and less for wood. Great trees were 
cut down and rolled into the log heap. Good material 
for lumber went up in smoke, and in those days no one 
ever thought of saving wood. But now all is changed.
-P-A-G-E-165
FORESTRY 165 
In many places the price of wood is exceedingly high. 
Good lumber is every year becoming harder to get. 
We have awakened to the fact that the farmer who 
has a wood lot on his farm has a valuable piece of 
property. 
Management of the Wood Lot.—A few acres of 
wood land, if properly managed, will furnish wood 
and other timber to the farmer for years to come. 
Now, what constitutes proper management of the 
wood lot? 
First, desirable young trees should be kept growing. 
Undesirable ones should be cut out and used for fuel 
or other purposes. 
Second, it is not, as a rule, a good plan to pasture 
the wood lot. Animals injure and destroy young 
trees by browsing upon them and gnawing their bark. 
Again, their sharp hoofs injure the roots, and their 
continuous tramping hardens the soil. 
Third, if grass is allowed to get into the wood lot 
it starves out the young seedlings or, at least, checks 
their growth. This is another good reason why the 
wood lot should never be pastured or seeded to grass. 
Fourth, old trees and dead trees should be carefully 
removed, the saw-timber saved, the limbs cut into 
wood, and the brush piled up neatly. As a rule, it 
is not a good plan to burn the brush. Many young 
trees are killed in this way. 
Fifth, when bare spots appear in the wood lot, young 
trees should be encouraged to grow there, either by 
planting seeds or young trees. Seedlings should be
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
thinned so that they will not starve each other out, 
and only the most useful, thrifty, and hardy kinds 
should be planted. 
Profit in the Wood Lot.—With a little care and at- 
tention on the part of the farmer the wood lot may be 
preserved and the land devoted to it be made to yield 
as large returns as other acres of the farm which are 
more carefully cultivated. 
Forests Prevent Droughts.—There are other good 
reasons why forests should be preserved in agricultural 
regions. The soil in the woods is very porous, and 
capable of absorbing large quantities of water, which 
runs off from cleared land and is wasted. This water 
is stored away as underground water. It feeds our 
wells and springs, and, moving upward, it increases 
the supply of capillary water in the soil, and thus be- 
comes available for the use of plants. It is well 
known that forest regions are seldom, if ever, affected 
by drought. Then, too, forests furnish homes for 
game, which all farmer boys delight in hunting, and 
for birds which feed upon insects that would injure 
our crops, if they were not held in check by the birds.

CHAPTER XXII 
HOME AND SCHOOL GROUNDS 
Influence of Home Surroundings.—Beautiful home 
surroundings exert an educational influence on the 
young, and add to the enjoyment of life for all. The 
proper provision of such surroundings is, therefore, a 
matter of importance to all who have, or expect to 
have, homes in the country. The tasteful arrange- 
ment and proper planting of home and school grounds 
require much thought and study in order to insure 
satisfactory results. 
Principles of Landscape Gardening.—In all land- 
scape gardening two principles must be observed: 
First, care must be taken in the selection of what 
is to be planted. A bunch of flowers does not neces- 
sarily constitute a bouquet; intelligence must be em- 
ployed in their selection and arrangement. So in the 
planting of grounds wisdom must be exercised in the 
selection and distribution of plants, trees, and shrubs 
in order to produce a pleasing and durable result. 
Consideration should be given to the nature of the 
surface and soil; and the location of everything planted 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  HOME AND SCHOOL GROUNDS i169 
should harmonize with the lay of the land, concealing 
defects and emphasizing the attractive features. 
Second, the planting itself should be rightly done, 
so as to insure proper growth and permanence. Ar- 
bor Day has been celebrated by the planting of many 
thousands of trees throughout the Western States; 
but, in all probability, not Io per cent of these are 
alive and in healthy growth at the present time. The 
ee oi ee ee 
  A CORNER OF A WELL ARRANGED SCHOOL GROUND. 
(Whitewater, Wis., Normal School.) 
practice of planting trees and naming them after great 
men, as Grant, Dewey, and the like, is a commend- 
able practice, if followed by proper care of the trees 
thus planted; but quite otherwise if the trees die and 
are consigned to the brush pile through neglect of 
our second principle. 
Application of Principles.—In order to apply these 
two principles successfully, it is necessary to make a
-P-A-G-E-170
170 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
study of the grounds and also of the character- 
istics of trees and plants; their hardiness, their mode 
of growth, and their adaptation to the soil and other 
conditions. There are probably not more than a 
dozen kinds of trees, and as many species of shrubs, 
that are adapted to planting in small grounds, under. 
ordinary conditions, in this climate. The proper loca- 
tion of drives and walks should receive due considera- 
tion before planting begins. Care should be taken not 
to plant trees too close together, or else there should be 
a definite plan for thinning them out as they approach 
full size. We should try to picture, not the small tree 
that we plant, but the tree that is to be. 
Selection of Trees for Planting.—Small, thrifty 
trees should ordinarily be selected for planting, rather 
than large ones. They are more likely to live. and 
will be larger and more satisfactory at the end of a 
few years. If large trees are planted, they should be 
“headed in” unsparingly, and staked firmly. No tree, 
large or small, should be planted which is blemished 
or imperfect, or without a good equipment of roots. 
Perhaps the majority of trees are practically ruined 
by the destruction of roots in the digging. 
Preparation for Planting.—In preparation for plant- 
ing, the holes should be dug at least four feet in 
diameter and two feet in depth. If the soil is hard 
and poor, it should be replaced by good earth; and in 
every case the trees should be well mulched with coarse 
litter that will remain in place. The work of planting 
cannot be done rightly by one person alone; it re-
-P-A-G-E-171
HOME AND SCHOOL GROUNDS 17I 
quires two, one to handle the spade and one to handle 
the tree and adjust the soil properly around the roots, 
which should be spread out in their natural position. 
Do not use water in planting unless the soil is dry, 
and even then it is not best to use a great amount. 
Handling of the Trees.—In handling the trees be- 
tween digging and planting, great care is necessary to 
prevent the fine, fibrous roots—which are the really 
important ones—from becoming dry through exposure 
to sun or wind. The cut ends of all large roots should 
be re-cut smoothly with a sharp knife immediately 
before planting. 
Plants Adapted to School Grounds.—The following 
trees and shrubs have been planted on the grounds of a 
certain school, viz.: Arbor Vitz, Colorado Blue 
Spruce, Douglas Fir, Hemlock, Norway Spruce, 
Scotch Pine, Cut-leaved Birch, Norway Maple, Com- 
mon Barberry, Thunberg’s Barberry, Dogwood, 
Golden Elder, Japanese Tree Lilac, Persian Lilac, 
Syringa, Rosa Rugosa, Russian Olive, Tartarian 
Honeysuckle, Spirea von Houttei, Snowball, Clematis, 
and Woodbine. 
Out of over 1,000 specimens planted, less than a 
dozen failed to live and thrive, since care was taken 
to follow the directions given above. 
Where to Secure Plants—Some varieties of trees 
and shrubs may be dug in the woods, in some locali- 
ties; but it is generally better, for school use, to get 
them right from the ground, from a reputable nursery- 
man, or from the gardens of people who are willing to
-P-A-G-E-172
172 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
contribute them. Sometimes they can be procured 
without cost from State Experiment Stations. 
The planting of home grounds may, perhaps, be less 
elaborate than that of public grounds; but it needs 
no less care and attention to right methods. Such 
work “pays in the heart; and no other work pays so 
well as that which tends toward happy, cheerful life.

CHAPTER XXIII 
SCHOOL GARDENING 
  The Development of School Gardening.—It has 
been a common practice in several European countries, 
for fully a century, to conduct gardens in connection 
with schools. This idea of making gardening a part 
of school work is rapidly growing in favor in our own 
country. The garden is a matter of great practical 
importance to all people living in the country, and it 
can be made a useful adjunct to the work of almost 
any school, if intelligently managed. 
Value of the Garden.—The study of agriculture has 
rightly been made a required subject in the schools of 
some states, and this must include some attention to 
gardening. The home garden ought to be the best 
part of the farm. And no department of agriculture 
is so well calculated to develop in boys and girls the 
power of keen observation and love for the beauty, 
variety and harmony which nature exhibits as that of 
gardening. Therefore, it is important that we do 
something with school gardening in order to assist 
and encourage home gardening. 
Size and Shape.—The size and shape of the school
-P-A-G-E-174
174 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
garden will depend, of course, upon the area and form 
of the lot. The nature and condition of the soil must 
be taken into account when we come to the decision 
of what shall be planted. 
Arrangement of School Grounds.—The school gar- 
den must not encroach upon the playground; play-. 
grounds are an absolute necessity. If the school lot is 
  THE GARDEN AND ARITHMETIC CORRELATED. 
very small, the corners and strips along the fences 
may be used for garden purposes. If the grounds are 
large enough, the following arrangement is a good 
one: Place the flower-beds towards the front of the 
grounds, on each side of the front lawn. Back of the 
flower-beds, and next to the playgrounds, is a good 
location for shrubbery of various kinds. In the rear 
of the playground we may place the vegetable garden. 
Shrubs and vines may be planted along the back fence, 
with perhaps a border of wild flowers, ferns, etc. We
-P-A-G-E-175
    SCHOOL GARDENING 175 
shall then have an arrangement like this, viz., front 
lawn, paths, flower-beds, playgrounds, vegetable gar- 
den, wild flowers, vines, etc. 
The Flower Beds.—lIn the flower beds a variety of 
plants may be grown, but good sense will be necessary 
in their selection; success will depend greatly on this. 
‘Such, hardy bulbs as tulips, crocuses, and narcissuses 
  STUDENT GARDENS, UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. | 
should be included for spring blooming. Peonies, iris, 
phlox and other hardy perennials should have a place, 
as they survive from year to year with comparatively 
little trouble. Of annuals, only the more robust and 
easily grown should be attempted, such as asters, pe- 
tunias, poppies, nasturtiums and zinnias. Regard 
should always be had to the water supply, as it is hard 
to grow beautiful flowers in hot weather without plenty 
of water. A flower bed withering for want of mois- 
ture is a sorry sight. Weeds, which grow rapidly and
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
rob the plants of light, water and food, should be 
carefully’ kept under. 
Essentials of Gardening.—In preparing the ground 
for planting, great care and patience should be exer- 
cised in enriching it and thoroughly pulverizing the 
top soil. Care should also be taken not to plant the 
seeds too deep, and not to let the surface become too 
dry while the seeds are germinating. These are funda- 
mental requirements in all gardening. 
List of Plants That May Be Grown. 
VEGETABLES: Peas, potatoes, sweet corn, pop corn, tomatoes, 
beans, lettuce, cabbages, cucumbers, radishes, beets, onions, par- 
snips, turnips, etc. 
FLOWERS, PERENNIALS: Phlox, hollyhocks, sweet William, iris, 
hemerocallis, columbine, monkshood, etc. 
ANNUALS: Asters, four-o-clocks, marigolds, petunias, nas- 
turtiums, poppies, mignonette, sweet alyssum, phlox Drummondii, 
coreopsis, zinnias, sweet peas, etc. . 
BEDDING PLANTS: Verbenas, geraniums, salvia, etc. 
The above list might be greatly extended, but, these are the 
things of easiest culture and surest returns. Probably no one 
will attempt to grow all of these in the same summer, but 
variety will be sought from season to season. It is better to 
grow a few things well than to attempt more than can be given 
thorough attention.

CHAPTER XXIV 
HOME GARDENING 
General Statement.—What has been said about the 
school garden will, much of it, apply equally well to 
the management of the home flower garden. In con- 
nection with country schools, vegetable gardening will 
not often be undertaken, as that requires more room 
and is more naturally connected with the home life; 
but city school children often develop great interest in 
the growing of vegetables. 
Importance of the Garden.—Every family in the 
country should pay great attention to the garden, be- 
cause of the profit and satisfaction which it affords. 
No other part of the farm of equal area pays one- 
tenth as well, financially, as a well-cultivated garden. 
Yet the garden is very apt to be neglected, and left to 
itself by farmers generally, from the mistaken idea 
that other work is more important. It is important, 
moreover, that the children in the home be trained 
to take an active part in the garden; for this furnishes 
one of the best means for stimulating a love for the 
beautiful and inspiring things of life. The treatment 
of the subject of gardening in this book must neces-
-P-A-G-E-178
    
178 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
sarily be very general. Gardening includes something 
of agriculture, horticulture, and floriculture. It is 
not advisable that the garden should be very large or 
elaborate, so that its care will become burdensome. 
The flower garden should not be located directly in 
front of the house, but at one side. It is not well to 
place a flower bed in the middle of the lawn. Neither 
should the front lawn be crowded with trees and shrub- 
bery; there should be a good, clear stretch of grass, 
with the shrubbery around the skirts of it. The vege- 
table garden should be at the back of the house, or 
well to one side of the lawn and flower garden. It 
should be well fenced against poultry and other do- 
mestic animals. 
Preparation of the Soil—The soil should be well 
fertilized with barnyard manure. Neglect of this is 
fatal to the best results. Weeds will grow in any soil, 
hut good vegetables require good soil as well as good 
cultivation. In the preparation of the soil, and in 
planting, the following points should receive attention: 
(1) Plow carefully and well, so that all grass, 
weeds, manure, or litter will be thoroughly turned 
under. Do not plow when the ground is very wet. 
(2) Harrow and rake until the top soil is fine, 
removing sticks and stones. 
(3) The depth at which seeds should be planted 
depends, largely, upon the size of the seeds. Small 
seeds should be covered slightly but evenly. The 
character of the soil is also to be considered. In light,
-P-A-G-E-179
  HOME GARDENING 179 
sandy soil, or in situations exposed to the wind, plant- 
ing should be deeper than under other conditions. 
(4) Many people err in building up the beds too 
high above the level of the paths, as the soil dries out 
rapidly when thus raised. If the beds can be worked 
from both sides, which is better, they may be made 
four or five feet wide. If they cannot be worked from 
both sides, three feet is about the limit of width. 
(5) The seeds should be planted in rows far 
enough apart to admit of passing a hoe freely between 
them. Flower seeds should, as a rule, be planted in 
rows crosswise of the beds. Judgment should be ex- 
ercised as to the time of planting. Onions, peas and 
potatoes may be planted as early as the ground can be 
worked. Flower seeds, as a rule, should not be planted 
until the ground is warm and danger from frost is 
‘past. Sweet peas, however, may be planted early and 
very deep. All peas should be planted at least three, 
or even four, inches deep. They should be planted in 
rows running north and south and provided with 
proper support. . 
(6) The transplanting of cabbages, tomatoes, etc., 
should be done on a cloudy day, or towards evening. 
Plants should be set rather deep, and shaded from 
the next day’s sun by a shingle or other shield. 
(7) The surface of seed beds should not be al- 
lowed to become dry or hard during the time of germi- 
nation. After plants are above the surface, the ground 
should be frequently stirred to prevent its baking or 
drying out, and to keep down weeds, which are much
-P-A-G-E-180
180 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
more easily killed while they are young. Properly thin 
out the plants. Great harm is done by over-crowding. 
This is one of the most common mistakes. 
(8) All vines, as cucumbers, melons and squashes 
should be carefully watched as they show the first 
leaves, to protect them from the bugs. The best pro- 
tection is to sprinkle them, dry, with Hammond’s 
“Slug Shot,” a preparation which no gardener can 
afford to be without, as it is especially useful for de- 
stroying the slugs on cabbages, currant and gooseberry 
bushes, and rose bushes. It is much safer as well as 
cheaper than paris green. For potatoes, however, 
nothing else is so effective as paris green in water.

BARN PLAN AND VENTILATION 
(Explanation of Barn Plan on Opposite Page.) 
A—Feed chutes and ventilating shafts, 314x4 feet. 
B—Feed bins, 34%x7 feet. C—Hay mows, 20x40 
feet. D—Trap doors to stairs, 3x3 feet. F—Barn 
floor, 14x40 feet. G—Driveway, 10x55 feet. H— 
Horse stalls, 5x5 feet. I—Mangers, 3x5 feet. J—AI-

O—Alleys, 2x15 feet. P—Cow spaces, 34%4x4% feet. 
R—Drop, 1x35 feet. S—S—Double doors. T—Win- 
dows hinged for ventilation. U—Alleys, 5x15 feet. 
V—Stairs to second floor. 
Suggested modifications of plan to suit convenience 
of builder :—Position and number of bins and feed 
chutes may be changed. Dimensions may be cut down 
by making alleys narrower. Horses may face wall. 
Partition may be left out. Doors may be hung on 
hinges instead of rollers, etc., etc. 
Importance of Ventilation.—In our efforts to pro- 
vide warm and comfortable quarters for our stock, 
we have overlooked, in many cases, the most impor- 
tant matter of all,—proper ventilation.

    VENTILATION PLAN. 
As we enter some stables on a winter’s morning, 
after the barn has been closed all night, we are almost 
stifled by the odors and impurities that fill the air. 
These must be very harmful to the animals that are 
forced to breathe them over and over again. In such

184 ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE 
stables no provision is made for admitting fresh air, 
or for drawing off that which has become charged 
with impurities and robbed of its life-giving oxygen. 
Without doubt the alarming prevalence of tubercu- 
losis among cattle is largely due to this neglect. 
Plan for a Ventilated Barn.—This neglected feature 
of barn construction is deemed worthy of special men- 
tion in this book. On the following pages will be 
found detail plans for a barn provided with an ade- 
quate system of ventilation. 
A—Cross section, through feed chutes and venti- 
lating shafts, of the barn shown on preceding page. 
B—Cross section of the same barn, through ventilat- 
ing shafts, placed at the ends, on either side of the 
double doors. This method will, doubtless, be pre- 
ferred by some farmers, as it will allow of keeping 
feed chutes filled with hay, sufficient for several feed- 
ings. However, it is not a wise plan to leave hay 
thrown down in the stables, as it will absorb the im- 
pure air and bad odors of the barn. In both cases feed 
chutes must be kept closed, in order to insure proper 
draft to ventilating shafts. C—vVertical section 
through floor, feed chute and ventilating shaft, show- 
ing trap door closed to insure proper circulation of 
air. D—Same, showing trap door open for feeding. 
E—Cross section of same at the second floor. Size 
of chute, 3x3% feet. Size of ventilating shaft, 
14x34 feet. F—Section through wall and window, 
showing sheetiron wind-shield, thrown back, and
-P-A-G-E-185
  BARN VENTILATION 185 
window open for summer ventilation. G—Same, 
showing shield in place for winter ventilation. 
Note 1. This shield is made of sheet or galvanized 
iron, bent, as shown in sections E and F above, and 
screwed to the window frame. When in place it de- 
flects the air upward towards the ceiling, preventing 
drafts. The opening between this shield and the win- 
dow frame for the admission of air should be about 
two inches in width. When the shield is raised 
slightly, it allows the window to drop forward on its 
hinges at the bottom and to open fully. 
Note 11. If round iron pipes are used for venti- 
lating instead of flues, they should be not less than 
fourteen inches in diameter. Their tops may be cov- 
ered with revolving hoods, specially constructed to 
create drafts. If less than four ventilating shafts are 
used, they should be large enough to have the same 
capacity. 
The bottoms of all ventilating shafts should open 
not more than one foot above the floor, and these 
openings should always be kept free from hay, straw 
or anything else that will prevent a free circulation 
of air. 
CORN AND STOCK JUDGING 
The following score cards for corn and stock judg- 
ing are the ones in use at the University of Wisconsin 
and are here reproduced, by permission, with the hope 
that they will prove of value to those who are inter-

ested in these more advanced phases of agriculture. 
They are easily understood and require no additional 
explanation. | 
OFFICIAL CORN SCORE CARD 
Note: Ten ears of corn constitute a sample for scoring. 
EXPLANATION OF POINTS IN CORN JUDGING Lam) . TRUENESS TO TYPE oR BREED CHARACTERISTICS: The ten ears 
of the sample should possess similar or like characteristics 
and should be true to the variety which they represent. 
2. SHAPE oF EAR: The shape of the ear should conform to 
variety type, tapering slightly from butt to tip, but 
approaching the cylindrical. 
3. CoLtor: A. GRAIN; B. CoB: Color of grain should be true 
to variety and free from mixture. White corn should 
have white cobs, yellow corn red cobs. 
4. Market Conpition: The ears should be sound, firm, well 
matured and free from mold, rot or injuries. 
5. Trips: The tips of the ears should not be too tapering and 
should be well filled with regular, uniform kernels. 
6. Butrs: The rows of kernels should extend in regular 
erder over the butt, leaving a deep impression when the 
shank is removed. Opened and swelled butts are objec- 
tionable. | 
7, KERNELS: A, UNIFORMITY OF; B. SHAPE OF: The kernels 
should be uniform in shape, size and color, and true to the 
variety type. The kernels should be so shaped that their 
edges touch from tip to crown. The tip portion of the 
kernel is the richest in protein and oil and hence of the 
highest feeding value. For this reason the tip portion 
should be full and plump. 
8. LenctH or EAr: Northern section 8 to 9 inches, central 
section 8% to 9% inches, southern section 8% to,9% 
inches. Long ears are objectionable because they usually 
have poor butts and tips, broad, shallow kernels, and 
hence a low percentage of corn to cob. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  SCORE CARDS 187 
0. CIRCUMFERENCE oF Ear: Northern section 6 to 6% inches, 
central section 614 to 634 inches, southern section 6% to 7 
inches. 
10. A. FurrRow BETWEEN Rows; Bs. SPACE BETWEEN FURROWS AT 
Cos: The furrow between the rows of kernels should be 
small. Space between kernels near the cob is very objec- 
tionable. 
11. Proportion oF Corn To Cos: The proportion of corn to 
cob is determined by weight; depth of kernels, size of 
cob and maturity all affect the proportion.

  PREFACE 
Tue accompanying volume originated in a desire on the 
part of a number of former students of Dr. Paul Monroe 
to show their appreciation of his twenty-five years of service 
to Teachers College, Columbia University, and to American 
education. Few educators in this country have contributed 
as much as Dr. Monroe toward raising the standards of 
scholarship and research in the study of education. Since 
the twenty-five years of Dr. Monroe’s fruitful activity as 
scholar and administrator coincide almost exactly with the 
completion of the first quarter of the present century, which _ 
has witnessed the development of a science of education 
and in which a foundation has been laid for rapid progress 
in education that is to come, it was considered appropriate 
that the tribute to Dr. Monroe should take the form of a 
collection of essays that would summarize the achievements 
in education of the past twenty-five years and that would 
also indicate in some measure the large field that still re- 
mains to be developed. Although the author of each essay 
was left free to develop his subject in his own way, the 
reader will find the threads of a number of common princi- 
ples running through the volume. For the editor and his 
collaborators the task has been a labor of affection and es- 
teem for their teacher, who with true missionary spirit now 
enters on a new sphere of activity and service in the field 
of international education.

  INTRODUCTION 
Paut Monrozr — AN APPRECIATION 
Tue educational services of Paul Monroe now extend 
over a quarter of a century. The fact of long service in 
itself attracts attention from a world which has not yet 
grown indifferent to that mastery of life which is marked 
by the steadiness and devotion which lengthen men’s labors 
in important places. But to point out a larger and more 
important milestone in the continuous industry of a scholar’s 
mind means something more and something different to 
his former students and colleagues. To them the com- 
memoration of twenty-five years of teaching and scholarship 
is merely a more formal and more outspoken expression of 
deep-seated appreciations they have long carried. Like 
the profession at large, they have been influenced by his 
mind in all the direct and indirect ways which are given to 
the resourceful thinker and the careful scholar. But, like 
themselves alone, they have shared the scholar’s intimate 
thought as only those may who have learned the ways of 
discovery under his guidance. Whatever they have done 
in the days of independent scholarship is rooted in those 
hours of counsel, criticism, and suggestion when the mind 
of the teaching scholar and his apprentice interchange upon 
some problem of truth and its applications. Thus many 
of the young and virile leaders of American education who 
have passed in and out of the portals of the great Teachers 
College of Columbia University remember and appreciate 
that one mind which was specially charged to give historical 
xi
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii INTRODUCTION 
perspective to personal experience, and to inculcate, in the 
course of the process, the distinction between reflection 
with and reflection without accurately determined facts. 
The quarter of a century just passed encompasses no 
ordinary years in the history of education. It was the most 
extraordinary period in American educational development. 
No similar span of time in America or elsewhere has cov- 
ered such important changes in the philosophy, the science, 
and the practice of school administration and school teach- 
ing. It was ushered in by the stimulating discussion of 
foreign educational philosophies which American students 
of education brought home from Germany. The United 
States lost for the time being that provincial and traditional 
point of view which had characterized its pedagogical think- 
ing since the Civil War, at least so far as the most influential 
educational theorists were concerned. Experimentation 
on the basis of deductions from new assumptions and prem- 
ises characterized many school systems. The self-satis- 
fied stolidity of traditional American practice was broken. 
But conservative and less theoretic American teachers, who 
clung tenaciously to habitual methods, criticized the new 
theories, giving ground slowly and then only on the demon- 
strated success of the new procedures. The debate led to a 
comparative study of the institutions of education, for it 
became clear that schools served various national and social 
purposes at different times and places. The new study of 
foreign school systems was too largely contemporary in its 
reach to satisfy fully. A wider reaching study — the his- 
tory of education — assumed a fresh importance in the 
professional training of leaders. 
It was at this moment that Doctor Paul Monroe, a grad- 
uate of Franklin College and the University of Chicago, 
trained in the methods of historical and sociological study, 
began his career as a college teacher. It was in 1897 that
-P-A-G-E-13
  INTRODUCTION ~- xiii 
he became instructor in history under the regimen of a pro- 
fessional school for educators, — the Teachers College of 
Columbia University. Two years later, he responded to 
the new interest in the history of education by transferring 
to an adjunct professorship in that field, assuming his full 
professorship in 1902. At an hour of propitious opportunity 
and at the place of greatest future influence, Professor Mon- 
roe thus began his constructive work in the training of 
educational scholars. 
The methods of that day were not exact in educational 
thinking. The comparative and statistical inquiries of 
the educational administrators had not yet transformed 
that field of practice; nor had the educational psychologists 
begun their scientific work in tests and measurements. 
The one field of educational study which possessed a thor- 
oughgoing scholarly method of inquiry was the history of 
education. It set the standard for graduate study and es- 
tablished an ideal of accurate investigation for students of 
education. Its demand set up a standard of respectability 
for every other field of educational thought. That it did 
so was due to the Professor of the History of Education in 
Teachers College even more than to the subject. 
Aspirants to scholarship who had no intention of becom- 
ing teachers of the history of education wrote their doctor’s 
dissertations in that field under this man, for the necessity 
of accurate method in education was already gripping the 
abler young men of the profession. Here and there another 
historical scholar or two aided influentially through publi- 
cations in the history of education, but the large and con- 
tinuous service was done at Teachers College under Dr. 
Monroe. Here was the largest body of graduate students 
in education and the best collections of research material. 
While he taught future school officers and educational 
thinkers he paralleled this work with his own writings. In
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv - INTRODUCTION 
1901 there appeared his Source Book in the History of Edu- 
cation for the Greek and Roman Period; in 1904, his Thomas 
Platter and the Educational Renaissance of the Sixteenth 
Century; in 1905, his Text-Book in the History of Education ; 
and, in 1907, his Brief Course in the History of Education. 
Meanwhile his students were being directed into those in- 
quiries as to the fact of American educational history which 
have aided greatly in restoring the American point of view 
and tradition to our thinking about the public school as a 
national institution. Much of the solid knowledge that we 
possess of the historical development of American schools is 
the product of the many studies which have been written 
by Professor Monroe’s students. 
It would not be an adequate characterization of the scholar 
or the man to confine our view to Dr. Monroe’s work as 
an historian of education. He has not been a mere his- 
torian, tracing the evolution of a particular institution. 
It would be far more accurate to say that Dr. Monroe is 
an educator with a specialized interest in the historical 
phases of his profession. His sociological training and 
bent would never permit him to look at an important social 
institution in a fragmentary way. He has, indeed, brought 
his organizing mind to the whole field of educational scholar- 
ship through his unusual editorial work, making the products 
of professional scholarship available to both the laity and 
the profession. 
As editor of the division of education for the New Inter- 
national Encyclopedia, Nelson’s Cyclopedia, and the Inter- 
national Yearbook, he has organized our professional knowl- 
edge for the public. As editor of Macmillan’s Text-Book 
Series in Education and the Source Book Series in Education, 
he has collected and systematized for the profession the 
available scholarly information on important problems in 
new, scattered, or half-organized fields of knowledge. His
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION Xv 
greatest contribution to the whole field of education is the 
Cyclopedia of Education (5 vols., 1910-18). As editor-in- 
chief of this ambitious work, he contributed still further 
to that international reputation which he had earlier made 
as an historian of education and placed under an obligation 
both laymen and teachers wherever the English language is 
read. 
In the work of a scholar and teacher there are other and 
less obvious phases of service appreciated only by the man’s 
intimates. The colleagues of Paul Monroe will be likely to 
think of him first in the codperative labors of university life. 
The making of a successful educational institution is a joint 
effort. A great institution, such as our Teachers College, is 
not made by specialists seeking and teaching truth in their 
own isolate ways. The other half of the tale is found in the 
combined work of teachers who sit down to a common prob- 
lem, recognize leadership, and follow it in the making of 
some great plan which enlists enthusiastic fulfillment. No 
man leaned to a common academic enterprise with more 
fellowship than did the Professor of the History of Educa- 
tion. What his graduate students sensed in the seminar, 
his colleagues in the faculty felt in the committee room, and 
his professional associates knew in the learned societies of 
which he has been president. It is this quality that has made 
him one of those invaluable personalities which the public 
always seeks for its commissions of public service. Wher- 
ever the American educational influence penetrated foreign 
parts, Professor Monroe has had the impulse and the energy 
to counsel, investigate, and make constructive suggestion. 
Hence, his public services have touched the colonial schools 
of the Philippines, the Americanization of the schools of 
China, and the improvement of American Christian schools 
the world over. From such accuracy and carefulness, from 
such sympathy and understanding, from such energies and 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
organizing powers, has been compounded the personality 
of the Director of the School of Education in our greatest 
Teachers College. With its world-wide clientele no less a 
scholar and man would do. 
It is not possible to speak the appreciation of all the far- 
scattered teachers of the world who have learned to be 
scholars, instructors, and good educational workmen under 
the tutelage of Professor Monroe. Each one of them would 
have his own angle of appreciation and his particular grate- 
fulness for help received. What has come to my mind and 
been written might have been said of him by those doctors 
of philosophy that he trained in his seminar room, if only 
they might once more assemble. It is conservatively 
thought and recorded. What has not been expressed are 
those warm personal appreciations which the affection of 
men for a man impels them to utter upon a day of sig- 
nificant commemoration. Instead we present a book of 
modest scholarly labors, each one of which has been affec- 
tionately conceived and written by a former student of the 
Professor of the History of Education in the Teachers Col- 
lege of Columbia University.

Social Conditions Leading Up to the Political 
Campaign of 1896 
In 1860 the United States was predominantly a nation of 
farmers. The great bulk of the population — 83.9 per cent, 
to be exact — lived in the open country or in places of fewer 
than eight thousand inhabitants. In 1890 the cityward 
trend of population, which is one of the most important 
social phenomena of our times, was already well under way, 
with 29 per cent of the entire population classified as urban 
on the basis of the definition followed above. In 1860 the 
total value of goods manufactured in the United States was 
something under $1,900,000,000, while in 1894 the total 
was five times that amount. In 1860 the building of rail- 
ways was only in its infancy, there being a total mileage of 
about 30,000 miles. In 1890 over 163,000 miles of railway 
extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific and spread over 
the entire country in closely woven network. 
Such facts as the above are but symptomatic of the 
fundamental changes that were going on in the nation. 
They mean that the industrial revolution which had al- 
ready done much to change social conditions in Great

4 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Britain and on the continent of Europe was during the post- 
Civil War generation beginning to make a great difference 
in American life as well. The changes from small- to large- 
scale industrial production, from domestic to factory 
organization, from hand- to power-driven machine manu- 
facture, were accompanied in this country, as in others, by 
the increased employment of women and children, by a 
calamitous harvest of industrial accidents, by oppressively 
long hours of labor, and by other disadvantages to the work- 
men that were hardly less significant. They were also ac- 
companied by the efforts of the workingmen to organize 
in order to secure the strength that comes from collective 
bargaining with respect to all the details of their employ- 
ment. 
The history of the industrial revolution in this country 
reflects the traditional English laissez-faire economic theory 
combined with a characteristically American individualism. 
Moreover, when the industrial situation first came to be a 
matter of common interest and control, the solution of the 
complex industrial problems was placed before a population 
that was predominantly agricultural, and largely unsym- 
pathetic with the labor viewpoint because unfamiliar with 
the conditions which labor strove to have remedied. 
Both cause and accompaniment of the industrial revolu- 
tion in the United States was the tremendous increase in 
railway mileage mentioned above. The railways increased 
the scale of business operations and made possible the or- 
ganization of industrial corporations whose business was 
not confined to the borders of one state or to those of two 
or three states, but was nation-wide. The railways, too, 
were typical forms of big business engaged in interstate 
trade. The peculiar form of organization which business 
followed at this time was that of limited-stock companies. 
As the expensiveness of unlimited competition was realized,
-P-A-G-E-21
  
GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 5 
there was a general tendency for companies engaged in the 
same line of industry or trade to combine, or for the largest 
and strongest of them to engage in bitter competition with 
their smaller and weaker rivals with the object either of 
making the smaller competitors come into the general com- 
bination or to eliminate them altogether. The railways 
in the same way passed through a stage of destructive com- 
petition and ended by creating great combinations of smaller 
railways which were able to restrict competition to larger 
units or to reach agreements regarding rates and the shar- 
ing of traffic. 
The tendency to form trusts and systems had not reached 
its fullest development before it was seen that these great 
companies, almost monopolistic in their control, were able 
to exert pressure upon smaller competitors — the shipper, 
the manufacturer, the ultimate consumer in general — that 
was inimical to the principle of free and unrestricted com- 
petition in business. The railroads, in particular, were 
able to oppress the shipper and the traveler with rates that 
were considered exorbitant, or that were known to be un- 
equal for different shippers. Under such conditions the 
people asked relief through legislation, which it was diffi- 
cult to secure. In all too many cases the railroads made 
it their business to block legislation aimed at controlling 
them, through the manipulation of legislatures, and even 
when such legislation was passed, it was found that the relief 
to be gained through state laws was efficacious only in so far 
as it related to commerce carried on wholly within the state. 
The conviction that the form which big business had 
taken was bad and that aid was needed in the form of federal 
legislation came to a definite expression in the passage of 
the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman 
Anti-Trust Act of 1890. The former measure prohibited a 
number of the practices which had been regarded as unfair and
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
called into existence an Interstate Commerce Commission, 
which was given power to pass upon the justice of rates, 
after investigation of the facts in the case, and to lay penal- 
ties upon the railroads for failure to live up to its decisions. 
The latter act forbade as illegal every contract, combina- 
tion in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in re- 
straint of trade or commerce among the several states or 
with foreign nations, and provided penalties for infraction 
of the law. Owing to judicial decisions which curtailed the 
application of the acts, and partly to the indecision of the 
federal administration, the relief that was hoped for upon 
the passage of these acts was long delayed. Indeed, it was 
only with the coming of a new spirit into federal politics 
after 1900 that any appreciable headway was made in the 
policy of governmental control of big business. 
The big stakes for which large combinations of business 
were playing made it financially profitable for them to ex- 
pend vast sums in the control of elections. They entered 
into unholy alliances with political bosses to control the 
selection of candidates at the primaries, in order thus to 
insure that city councils, legislatures, state administrative 
officers, the judiciary, and the federal congress might be 
amenable to orders, or at least susceptible to financial con- 
siderations. The venal use of money in politics was made 
easier by reason of the large immigrant populations in the 
growing cities, but even among native stock the liberal 
distribution of money to carry an election was common 
political procedure. Back of all this degradation of the 
principle of government by the people lay a conviction 
held by many business men that it was essential that property 
should be protected against the attacks of radical reformers. 
Many men, otherwise honest, condoned the fact that very 
vile means were being used to attain, as they thought, 
thoroughly justifiable ends.
-P-A-G-E-23
    GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 7 
The early phases of American material development were 
largely dependent upon an uncontrolled and unchecked ex- 
ploitation of natural resources. Of all these the most ex- 
tensive was the abundance of rich agricultural land that 
might be had almost for the asking. The announcement 
of the Commissioner of the Public Domain in 1890 that the 
end of the frontier was in sight and that the best of the 
free land had been taken up marks in a very real way the 
beginning of a new epoch in American life. It was not 
accidental that in 1889 the Department of Agriculture was 
made one of the separate departments of the federal adminis- 
tration and its secretary given a seat in the President’s 
Cabinet, for now it was recognized as essential to continued 
national prosperity that wasteful methods of cultivation 
be superseded by efforts to preserve the fertility of the soil. 
As yet, however, nothing had been done to protect the great 
resources in forest and water course, in mine and quarry, for 
the benefit of the entire people and for succeeding generations 
instead of turning them over to the enrichment of private 
individuals. 
In face of all the unfavorable political and economic con- 
ditions which have just been recalled, there was in the country 
at large during the eighties a feeling of shame at the failure 
of liberal political institutions to result in better government, 
and a degree of interest in political and economic reform that 
was destined in the near future to bring about appreciable 
improvement. Considerable progress had been made before 
1896 in establishing the federal administration upon a basis 
of competitive examination and merit. Ballot reforms had 
made it more difficult for the bosses ‘to deliver a bought 
electorate, and occasional legislation indicated a developing 
consciousness on the part of the public that the uncontrolled 
development of the factory .system of production had 
wrought unjustifiable hardships upon the industrial worker.
-P-A-G-E-24
  
8 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Meanwhile certain combinations of specific circumstances 
were setting the stage for the spectacular political cam- 
paign of 1896. 
The Political Campaign of 1896 
An extended period of poor crops, at a time when prices 
of agricultural products were at the lowest point reached 
after the Civil War, had made it impossible for farmers 
generally to pay the interest on the mortgages which rested 
on their properties. To them it seemed desirable that there 
should be a cheaper and freer currency. More money in 
circulation would tend to raise the price of their produce, 
would provide cash for interest payments, and, at the same 
time, relatively lessen the debt. The employees of the 
industrial system had felt all through Cleveland’s second 
administration the pinch of an acute financial depression in 
the form of low wages and unemployment. They, too, de- 
sired to see more money in circulation for the effect they 
thought it would have on business in general and on their 
own private financial circumstances. Then there were the 
silver states that desired a better market for their chief 
commodity. 
The demand for a freer currency was, however, by no 
means the only plank in the platform of general political 
revolt which culminated in the campaign of 1896. There 
was a well-defined feeling among the farmers that they were 
being exploited in more ways than one, and this feeling was 
shared by the great number of workingmen who were 
smarting under their inability to get redress for their griev- 
ances through the courts or through progressive industrial 
legislation. These two groups believed themselves to be 
under the unjust domination of capital, and they undertook 
to develop a political régime more sympathetic with their 
point of view and more immediately responsive to their will.  
-P-A-G-E-25
GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 9 
_ The agrarian-labor revolt took definite form in the organi- 
zation of the People’s Party, while for a time the Populist 
group was in complete control of the Democratic Party. 
After a campaign of unexampled enthusiasm and activity, 
William McKinley was elected President with a Republican 
Congress to support him, but it is worthy of note that 
William Jennings Bryan received a larger popular vote 
than had ever before been given to any presidential candi- 
date, in spite of the fact that he was defeated by more than 
a half-million votes. 
The demand for a freer circulation of currency through 
the unlimited coinage of silver came to be the central issue 
in the campaign of 1896, because that was thought by the 
various disaffected groups to be the immediate panacea for 
the ills that troubled them. However, as it has turned out, 
that issue was largely a temporary one, the occasion for 
which was almost immediately removed by the return of 
industrial prosperity, good crops, higher wages, and better 
prices. The remainder of the Populist program, on the 
other hand, has been of much more enduring significance. 
The demand for government ownership of railways, tele- 
graphs, and telephones was prophetic of the largely in- 
creased control which the government has since that time 
come to exercise over the utilities by which the public is 
served. The demands for conservation of the wealth in 
public land, for ballot reform, direct election of United 
States senators, a shorter working day, an income tax, and 
other political and economic changes of like tenor indicated 
that a considerable portion of the population had become 
convinced that the policies of unchecked individualism and 
governmental unconcern with economic matters would no 
longer serve the needs of society. There was abroad in the 
land an insistent proposal that new social controls should 
be set up for the protection of the many against the power
-P-A-G-E-26
10 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of the financially intrenched few, and that political power 
to that end should be placed more directly in the hands of 
the people. 
New Functions of the Federal Administration 
For so long as McKinley remained President, the federal 
administration followed closely the counsels of men inti- 
mately connected with big business, with complete indif- 
ference to the demand for reforms of various kinds which 
had been indicated by the election of 1896. No legisla- 
tive action was taken to strengthen the hands of the Inter- 
state Commerce Commission, which had been considerably 
shorn of power by judicial decisions, and no action was 
taken by the administration to control the operations of 
industrial combinations under the powers given in the 
Sherman Anti-Trust Act. On the contrary, a high protec- 
tive tariff was installed to the evident advantage of the busi- 
ness interests. A period of unexampled prosperity was in 
full swing, and for the time being the social critics were 
silenced. What is equally important in explaining the de- 
lay in taking up the solution of industrial and social problems 
after the election of 1896 was the shift of attention to foreign 
and military affairs, which were prominent in the public 
mind from the very beginning of McKinley’s first term. 
The war with Spain (1898) substituted patriotic for criti- 
cal attitudes. Prosperity having continued, the chief issue 
in the campaign of 1900 was whether or not the United 
States should follow the path of empire upon which she had 
set out with the acquisition of Porto Rico and the Philippine 
Islands. It was only with the accession to the presidency 
of Theodore Roosevelt, after the assassination of President 
McKinley in 1901, that a new conception of the powers and 
responsibilities of government in social and economic affairs 
became influential in the federal administration,
-P-A-G-E-27
  GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 11 
After the end of the business depression which lasted from 
1893 to 1896, a new and spectacular period of industrial 
development took place in which the tendency toward com- 
binations in business became more pronounced than ever 
and followed broader patterns. Instead of representing 
combinations of firms or corporations engaged in the same 
phase of business, the newer tendency was for combinations 
to be perfected that would control the entire range of indus- 
trial processes from the production of raw materials to the 
sale of the finished product. Typical of this sort of combina- 
tion was the United States Steel Trust, organized in 1901 
with a capital stock of $1,400,000,000, of which amount, 
according to various estimates, $400,000,000 to $700,000,000 
was “water.” The increasing importance of elaborative in- 
dustry in the economic life of the country during the period 
since 1890 is shown by the increase in the proportion of the 
population dwelling in the city from 35.4 per cent ! in 1890 
to 51.4 per cent in 1920. Between 1889 and 1914 the value 
of manufactured products increased from nine to twenty-four 
billions, while between 1890 and 1920 the value of the out- 
put of mines, quarries, and oil and gas wells increased from six 
hundred six millions to six thousand seven hundred millions. 
Coincident with the business revival after 1896, there was a 
campaign of publicity in the magazine and newspaper press 
that thoroughly aroused the reading public to some of the 
evil practices of big business. The time was ripe for a cham- 
pion to declare for government interference and control in the 
matter of business practices that so closely affected the 
public welfare. 
In his first presidential message Theodore Roosevelt 
took up, as the first subject of consideration, the proper 
relationship between the federal administration and busi- 
ness. He advised the creation of some agency that might

gain accurate information about corporations to the end 
that a properly constituted body with adequate powers 
might eliminate those abuses of corporate organization 
and management that were inimical to the common wel- 
fare. To attain this end a Department of Commerce and 
Labor was created, the Secretary of which was to have a 
seat in the President’s Cabinet, and in which there was to 
be a Bureau of Corporations, with the function of gathering 
the desired information about the corporations. The trial 
of government cases under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act 
and the Interstate Commerce Act was expedited by Congres- 
sional action, and the Interstate Commerce Act was strength- 
ened. Power which the Government had possessed, but 
had not applied, was now directed toward the dissolution of 
some of the most conspicuous industrial combinations. In 
his public utterances the President declared openly for the 
‘‘square deal,” and in his public acts he applied the principle 
of the subordination of private business interests to the 
public good. 
In other important connections Roosevelt identified him- 
self with an aroused and enlightened public conscience, of 
which none was more noteworthy than his espousal of the 
movement for the conservation of the country’s natural re- 
sources. His activities in this field resulted in the passage 
of the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which had as its 
object the reclamation of the arid lands of the Rocky Moun- 
tain region through irrigation, and in the appointment of 
the National Conservation Commission. Due again to his 
initiative, vast tracts of public land were saved to the pub- 
lic as forest reserves and sources of water power. 
When William Howard Taft became President in 1909, he 
was committed to the progressive policies of his predecessor, 
and it was thought that he would continue along the lines 
which had brought so generous public approval to the ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 13 
ministration of Roosevelt. Early in his term, however, 
misunderstandings arose over the tariff and over the con- 
servation policy of the administration, and successive events 
threw Taft upon the support of the leaders of the party who 
were less responsive to the popular demand for enlightened 
social legislation. The result was a split in the Republican 
Party, with the ‘‘Old Guard”’ representing the attitudes of 
the Republican Party in its haleyon days of the McKinley 
régime, and the ‘‘Progressives”’ claiming that upon them 
had fallen the mantle of Roosevelt. The party misunder- 
standing became so grave that President Taft, the regular 
party nominee, was opposed in the election of 1912 not only 
by Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat of proved liberal tend- 
encies, but also by Roosevelt, who received the support of 
“Progressive” Republicans. The result was the election 
of Mr. Wilson. 
In the opening years of the first Wilson administration, 
a great deal of legislation was passed which represented not 
only the intention of making big business and the transpor- 
tation companies operate within the fair limits of common 
honesty and fair competition, but also an appreciation that 
the rules according to which the industrial life of the nation 
was to expand must be comprehensible and definite and not 
of such a nature as to result in the crippling of business 
initiative. The Federal Trade Commission was created in 
1914 with powers and duties looking to the prevention of 
unfair methods of competition in commerce. In the same 
year the Clayton Act declared in detail what constituted 
such unfair methods. The Esch-Cummins Act of 1920 
represented the culmination of the Wilson legislation with 
respect to the control of Interstate Commerce. It created 
a Railroad Board of Labor Adjustment to pass:upon matters 
of controversy between employers and employees, gave the 
Interstate Commerce Commission power to establish rates

designed to provide the railways a fair return upon their 
real valuation, and recognized as necessary and legal the 
combination of railways subject to the approval of the 
Commission. 
Expansion of Federal Administration 
For the present purpose, the foregoing sketch may be 
taken as indicating the general trend of the federal policy 
with respect to the interference of the government in 
economic affairs, — a field to which its activities had been 
largely foreign in the earlier history of the country. And 
now, without any effort at completeness, some additional 
details may be given which will indicate how much the 
business of the federal government has expanded in what 
had previously been considered no field at all for government 
action or the exclusive province of state sovereignty. The 
creation of the Department of Commerce and Labor has 
already been mentioned as one of the early indications of a 
new intention of the federal government to concern itself 
more actively with the concerns of the industrial life. The 
division of that department in 1913 into the separate de- 
partments of Commerce and of Labor showed the growth of 
the work of the original department and the recognition of 
the problems connected with labor as being of sufficient 
complexity and importance to have a separate administra- 
tion. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Children’s 
Bureau in the Department of Labor have been collecting 
data that are invaluable in the determination of wise social 
policy. The Naturalization Bureau of the same Depart- 
ment has carried on an important work in connection with 
the Americanization of immigrants. The work of the fed- 
eral Postal Department has also greatly increased with the 
universal development of rural free delivery, the establish- 
ment of the parcel post, and the operation of the postal

savings bank. The Department of Agriculture has under- 
gone a rapid expansion of its work and been given many new 
functions through the increased participation of the federal 
government in the educational work carried on by the states. 
Among these may be mentioned the experimental work 
carried on in the state agricultural colleges under the Hatch 
Act (1887) and succeeding acts which have increased the 
federal contributions for experimental purposes, the exten- 
sion work in agriculture and home economics under the 
Smith-Lever Act (1914), and the county-farm-bureau and 
county-agent work. The great expansion of the work of 
the federal Department of Agriculture conducted in con- 
nection with the several states led in 1915 to the creation of 
the States Relations Service to have charge of the work 
carried on in common by the national and state governments. 
The Treasury Department has experienced a large develop- 
ment of its activities through the tremendous financial 
operations of the World War and has been brought closer to 
the people of the entire country through the multiplication 
of holders of government securities. The activities of the 
same department in the field of public health have been 
greatly expanded as well. The creation of the Federal 
Reserve Bank has made the federal government a much 
more active participant in national financial operations 
and policies. The establishment of the Farm Loan Bureau, 
the passage of the Federal Aid Roads Act (1916), and the 
passage of the Smith-Hughes Act for the promotion of 
vocational education, each involving the appropriation of 
millions of dollars to be expended or administered within 
the states, the passage of the Prohibition Amendment, the 
levying of a federal income tax, and pure food and narcotics 
legislation have multiplied the number of federal servants 
necessary for efficient administration and have brought the 
existence, the significance, and the power of the federal
-P-A-G-E-32

government home to every citizen in a way that was simply 
not thought of in the year 1897. 
A New Theory of Social Justice 
The general awakening of the public conscience to the 
need for special legislative control of the activities of big 
business, which we have seen as characteristic of the last 
twenty-five years of our history, was accompanied by a new 
sensitiveness to the hardships which the industrial system 
had brought to the human factors of production. The long 
hours of the working day, the appalling frequency of in- 
dustrial accidents, the unhealthful conditions under which 
a great deal of labor was performed, the unsatisfactory legal 
status of the workingmen’s organizations, the prevalence 
of child labor, the inadequate wages in certain industries, 
and the petty oppression under which many groups of em- 
ployees suffered were only some of the items in a sweeping 
indictment which was placed before the public in those years. 
The result has been an almost complete reversal of the legal 
or political philosophy which had hitherto been applied to 
the settlement of labor litigation. Efforts to correct abuses 
of the industrial system had, in the earlier generation, en- 
countered the doctrines of the common law, which had arisen 
through the decisions of judges under the much less complex 
circumstances of the period preceding the industrial revolu- 
tion and which had continued under the inertia of the 
common law into a time and a set of circumstances for which 
they were inadequate. Much of the early industrial legis- 
lation had been declared unconstitutional as interfering 
with the constitutional guarantees of liberty and enjoyment 
of property. The common-law doctrine that an employer 
could not be held responsible for an industrial accident that 
had been caused by the negligence of a fellow workman long 
resisted the demand for compensation to workmen in the
-P-A-G-E-33
GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND i7 
case of injuries that occurred in the normal course of occupa- 
tion. The new conscience, however, insisted that the new 
conditions of industrial production made the application of 
much old common law and many constitutions unfair to the 
men employed and dangerous to the future welfare of society. 
It demanded that the technicalities of this age-old law should 
be brushed aside and that the courts should participate in 
giving present-day justice in the light of present-day condi- 
tions. The result was the appearance on the bench of a 
new type of judge and the discovery of new constitutional 
sanctions which have made it possible for society to get its 
will observed in the improvement of the conditions of labor 
and in a distribution of the risks of production. The result 
has been the passage of laws and the application of those 
laws to the ends of lessening the hazards of industry, of pro- 
viding compensation for industrial accidents, of improving 
the sanitary conditions of factories, of eliminating child 
labor, of limiting the hours of employment of women, of 
providing means of industrial conciliation, and in many ways 
besides. The problem as to what share of the return of his 
labor the laborer shall receive, as intricately tied up with 
all the details of his relationship with his employer and the 
public, is at present far from a satisfactory solution and 
constitutes one of the live issues of public policy. The 
mental attitude, however, which promises constructive 
thinking in an effort to solve this complex problem, or set 
of problems, has become increasingly prevalent during the 
last twenty-five years, and we may face the future with a 
certain degree of confidence that orderly progress toward 
a better equilibrium will take place. 
Extensions of State Administration 
One of the most striking developments that has come 
about since the epoch-making campaign of 1896 is the in-
-P-A-G-E-34
18 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
crease in the functions of government assumed by the states 
for the protection and the enhancement of the common 
good. Agencies have been provided to see that insurance 
companies shall be managed on sound principles, that the 
investment securities that are offered for sale in the state 
shall be on a sound basis, that the food we buy shall be pure, 
that the hotels we lodge in shall be sanitary, that the milk 
we buy and the ice cream we consume shall contain a certain 
proportion of butter fat, that the public halls in which we 
sit shall be properly constructed, that the houses we live in 
shall be provided with proper fire escapes, that our public 
school children shall be vaccinated, that factories shall 
observe the provisions of the law regarding the safety and 
health of workmen, that our children shall go to school, and 
that the public utilities that serve the people with light, 
heat, and transportation shall give adequate service at 
fair cost. The state is now spending huge sums in aid of 
local communities in the building of roads and bridges and 
other public works, and in aid of public health, public educa- 
tion, or other forms of social service where twenty-five years 
ago it spent for those objects in comparison practically 
nothing. 
Government Placed More Immediately in the 
Hands of the Voters 
With all this multiplication of the functions and agencies 
of government, both federal and state, the trend of political 
evolution has been in the direction of placing the control of 
public officials and public policy more immediately in the 
hands of the people. The adoption of the secret ballot had 
been almost universally accomplished before 1897, but since 
that time the adoption of the direct primary system for all 
officers short of the presidency has been accomplished. This 
change of the machinery of political control was designed to
-P-A-G-E-35
  GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 19 
take away from the party bosses the last remnants of their 
power through putting the nomination as well as the selec- 
tion of public servants directly in the hands of the voters. 
It remains a potent means to efficient and honest govern- 
ment, but unfortunately the application of the instrument 
has been faulty in the extreme and reveals a degree of 
civic lethargy that is, to say the least, disquieting. In 
some states the initiative and the referendum in state legis- 
lation have been developed, while to a limited extent the 
principle of the recall of public servants has been put into 
effect. Of outstanding significance in the political history 
of the period under consideration is the admission of women 
to the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 
Improvements in Rural Life 
Any account of the domestic history of the United States 
during the last twenty-five years would be inadequate which 
did not at least mention the great change which has come 
over rural life in that time. The poor financial condition 
of the farmer passed with the general business depression 
that came to an end in 1896, and from that date until after 
the close of the World War his economic position was 
highly favorable. It was a period of high prices for his 
products and of relative decline in the cost of the things 
he had to buy. The trend of farm values was upward and 
he reaped the advantage of this increment. He had ready 
money to buy the labor-saving equipment which made his 
labor less exacting and his output greater. He could take 
advantage of the offerings of an especially inventive genera- 
tion and apply them to the greater efficiency and comfort 
of his farm and home. The internal combustion engine was 
harnessed to supply water for barn and house, to provide 
power for a wide range of backbreaking work, and, mounted 
on wheels, it gave him an untiring means of eliminating to
-P-A-G-E-36
20 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
a large extent the isolation which had constituted the great- 
est social limitation of life in the open country. The tele- 
phone put him in instant touch with his neighbors and with 
the world outside, and the rural postman brought him his 
daily mail. Sometimes out of his own resources unaided, 
but more often with the advantage of improved administra- 
tion and the bounty of the larger state community, he has 
supplied his family with educational opportunities the equal 
of those enjoyed by children living in the towns and cities. 
To be sure, the picture drawn above of the improved 
status of the farmer is by no means universally applicable, 
for there remain large rural areas in the United States in 
which the conditions described are woefully unfulfilled. It 
is equally true that at the present time, owing to some of the 
influences of the World War on our complicated and sensi- 
tive social organization, the farmers as a class in this country 
are experiencing a period of acute financialdepression. But 
notwithstanding all the qualifications that have to be made, 
one of the most favorable developments that has taken place 
in American life in the last quarter-century is the im- 
proved condition and prospects of the rural population. 
The United States Accepts an International Réle 
No less prominent a characteristic of the changed nature 
of American life than the increased complexity of its domes- 
tic affairs is the extent to which this country has swung out 
during the last quarter-century into the current of inter- 
national politics. The connection between industrial 
changes and the new international relationship is very close, 
for the industrial revolution, with its new problems of 
markets for finished products and of supplies of. raw ma- 
terials, has been the underlying cause of the intensity of inter- 
national competition which has characterized the political 
policies of the Western World during the last century. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 21 
The war with Spain in 1898 and the consequent accession 
of colonial possessions represented the more or less accidental 
precipitation of a change in the international policies of the 
United States which the development of her industrial life 
had made inevitable sooner or later. Nevertheless, the 
protectorate over Cuba and the possession of Porto Rico 
and the Philippines represent important landmarks in the 
history of our diplomatic policy. These steps into Spanish 
America emphasized the interest of the United States in 
Pan-American affairs and have been followed in quick suc- 
cession by others no less significant. In 1902 the United 
States intervened in the dispute between Venezuela and 
some of the European powers; in 1903 it recognized the 
Republic of Panama and entered into contracts with that 
new republic which paved the way to the construction of 
the Panama Canal; in 1905 it established a protectorate 
over Santo Domingo, and in 1915 and 1916 respectively it 
entered into the same sort of relationship with Haiti and 
Nicaragua. The general interest which has been shown 
during the last fifteen or twenty years in cementing closer 
and more friendly relations between our country and the 
Spanish-American republics is a reflection of the march of 
commerce, while our difficult relations with Mexico have 
been related to the expansion of American investments in 
that country for the production of some of the raw materials 
essential to our developing industrial life. 
In the Far East the United States became involved in the 
Boxer Rebellion of 1900, and in the diplomacy connected with 
the settlement of the disputes which arose was insistent upon 
observance of the principles of the open door and the ter- 
ritorial integrity of China. The part played by President 
Roosevelt in the negotiations leading to peace between Japan 
and Russia in 1905 indicated our interest in the Far Hast, 
while during the last six years our diplomatic relations with
-P-A-G-E-38
  22 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
China and Japan have very frankly recognized the Far 
Eastern situation as being of the greatest concern to this 
country. We are interested in the Far East primarily be- 
cause it is essential to the free development of American 
trade that our commercial participation in that part of the 
world should be untrammeled. 
Many other events of the last twenty-five years have in- 
dicated that the period of comparative isolation of America 
from the politics of the world at large was coming to an 
end. Among these may be mentioned the enthusiastic 
support that was given by the government of the United 
States to the two Hague Conferences and to the Permanent 
Court of Arbitration organized by the second of the Hague 
Conferences (1907), and also the efforts made by the adminis- 
trations of Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson to draw up agree- 
ments between the United States and other individual powers 
providing for the peaceful settlement of disputes between 
them. But the supreme proof of the thoroughgoing inter- 
dependence of our national fortunes with those of the rest 
of the world lies in the events of the last nine years beginning 
with the outbreak of the World War. At first news of 
war, public opinion held that the hostilities in Europe were 
just a recurrence of the conflict of national interests of which 
the preceding centuries had been full, and that it would be 
possible for the United States to stand by in its traditional 
policy of aloofness from entangling alliances with foreign pow- 
ers. But as event followed upon event, it came to be seen 
that the war wasafter all our war. It was nota far-off conflict, 
but one that came home to our very doors, involving our ma- 
terial fortunes and enlisting our sympathies in an unmistak- 
able direction. The news of the war ceased to be foreign and 
became home news, and we found ourselves neutral neither in 
act nor in attitude. The definite entrance of the United 
States into the war came as a natural and inevitable step.
-P-A-G-E-39
GENERAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 23 
Educational Developments of the Period 
We have found the chief characteristic of our national 
life during the past twenty-five years to be a rapidly increas- 
ing complexity of economic and social conditions. This 
factor has called for the elaboration of new social controls 
in which both the federal and the state governments have 
participated. It is very natural that the public agencies 
for education should have received a great deal of atten- 
tion in this time, since the schools must serve as the funda- 
mental social control in a democratic society, and it may be 
said that education has made greater progress in the period 
under consideration than in any period of equal length dur- 
ing our history as a nation and, perhaps, than in all the 
years of our history preceding. Within this period, for the 
first time, there has come about a persistent effort to make 
the schools serve society in terms of the intelligence, right 
attitudes, and formed habits of the children who were to 
become the citizens of the future. The scientific study of 
the curriculum, of the methods of teaching and learning, of 
the correlation of the school experience with the life of 
society, of the adaptation of curricula to the economic and 
social needs of children of various probable walks of life, 
of the desirable course of study to be followed in the prepa- 
ration of teachers, of the correlation of high school studies 
with effective college work, — these are only some of the 
aspects of the renewed determination to make of the school 
an efficient agency of sdcial development and control. 
The intensified interest in the content and quality of the 
school experience has had its correlate on the institutional 
side in the spectacular development of the high school, the 
commanding growth of technical and higher education, the 
development of college departments and university schools 
of education, the change of the normal schools to degree- 
granting teachers’ colleges, the reorganization of secondary
-P-A-G-E-40

education through the development of the junior high school, 
the extensive supply of opportunities for vocational prepara- 
tion through the modification of the curricula of secondary 
schools and the supply of part-time and continuation schools, 
and the very extensive adoption of the kindergarten as a 
part of the public-school system. 
No less significant of a deeper appreciation of the impor- 
tance of public education than the changes mentioned above 
is the intensive development of the agencies of school ad- 
ministration. Within this period the federal government 
has, step by step, added to the duties of existing departments 
social functions that are either educational or inseparably 
related to education and has at the same time enlarged the 
work of the federal Bureau of Education and entered into 
coéperative plans with the separate states for the fostering 
of special kinds of education. The states likewise have en- 
larged the staffs of their departments of education to meet 
the needs which have been brought about through standardi- 
zation of the educational work done in the states, more 
extensive financial contributions on the part of the state 
governments, more general establishment of minimum re- 
quirements, and more active leadership in the direction of 
improved buildings, better salaries for teachers, better en- 
forcement of attendance regulations, better adaptations 
of educational opportunities to the vocational needs of the 
pupil and the economic needs of society. 
More might well be said to indicate the scope and the 
vitality of the educational rebirth which this nation has ex- 
perienced during the past generation, but that is properly 
the burden of the pages which follow.

Introduction 
The most significant development in the whole field of 
education in the United States has been the organization of 
facilities and opportunities for its study. It is difficult to 
realize, however, that this development has taken place in less 
than the twenty-five years that have just passed. “By the 
close of the nineteenth century grudging recognition had 
already been given in a number of colleges and universities 
to the study of pedagogy or education, but the subject 
either was treated as an appanage of the chair of philosophy 
or, where it was taught in a separate department, was given 
only by one or two men. The view of Josiah Royce, ex- 
pressed in 1891, was shared by many who professed the long, 
or even the recently, established subjects considered worthy 
of college or university study. ‘To sum it all in one word,”’ 
wrote Royce, ‘‘teaching is an art. Therefore there is no 
science of education ... But, on the other hand, if the 
teacher wants aid from the scientific spirit, and counsel from 
scientific education, therestands ready to his hand such assist- 
ance as, above all, psychology has to offer to the educator who 
desires to become a living observer of the minds of children, 
and such assistance, too, as ethics may suggest to the man 
who is strong enough to grapple with deeper problems.” 
The next thirty years were to disprove Royce’s statement 
and to establish the fact that, while the practice of educa- 
tion is an art, the foundations for its successful pursuit 
rest on scientific bases. In spite of the discouraging atti- 
29
-P-A-G-E-46
Sie ea rake, A a Rg 
380 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tude of colleges and universities to the study of education, 
the view was soon accepted that a modern university must 
be an ‘‘institution where any person can find instruction in 
any study,” and that from the standpoint of the public the 
scientific study of education is as urgent as the study of law, 
medicine, and engineering. It was still necessary, however, 
and at the beginning of the period no easy task, to prove 
that the study of education included more than the mere 
preparation of teachers. The keynote of the new movement 
was probably sounded by Dean J. E. Russell when in 1900 
he wrote that ‘University departments of education have as 
their special function the investigation of educational founda- 
tions, the interpretation of educational ideals, the invention 
of educational methods, and the application of educational 
principles. The science of education . . . needs to be de- 
veloped and made over to fit modern conditions.” In 
1896-97 the material was not available to carry out such a 
program. Although 220 out of 432 institutions were reported 
by the United States Commissioner of Education as offer- 
ing courses in pedagogy, these consisted only of ‘‘elements 
of theory and practice of teaching,” or of ‘psychology, 
history of education, child study, and school manage- 
ment,” or of ‘‘the science, art, and history of education.” 
At best the work hardly rose above the standards of the 
regular normal schools. Not only did the subject lack 
content and rely on borrowing extensively from other fields 
of science, themselves still young, but few specialists were 
available to teach it. So long as the subjects consisted 
mainly of theory which was little more than sophisticated 
practice, or was based on a few principles of psychology 
which on the whole had little bearing and applicability in 
the classroom, or derived its aims and ends from a meta- 
physical philosophy unrelated to the needs of a developing 
society, its claim to scientific character could not be estab-

lished. Neither the formalism of Herbart nor the mys- 
ticism of Froebel furnished the basis for further progress, 
but that progress was demanded is indicated by the preva- 
lence during the last decade of the nineteenth century and 
the early years of the twentieth of a kaleidoscope of chang- 
ing fads and fancies, each guaranteed to solve the problem 
of education — until the next appeared. That the subject 
of education did ultimately emerge from the realm of tradi- 
tion and vague expectations and fulfill the vision that was 
in those who, like Dean Russell, early saw the possibilities 
of a scientific basis for it, was due largely to the stimulus 
derived from the faith of the American people in education. 
The Public and Education 
The most striking difference between the administration 
of education in the United States and in European countries 
is the absence of a centralized authority. Constitutionally 
the direction of education is left to each state. Since, how- 
ever, this direction was, and in many states still is, but lightly 
exercised, education becomes a matter of local concern. To 
this fact is due the great variation in educational progress 
throughout the country, but while it is responsible for stand- 
ards in certain sections lower than those that prevail under 
more centralized governments, it has also been responsible 
for the attainment of standards considerably in advance of 
those that prevail elsewhere. This point was shrewdly 
brought out by Sir Joshua Fitch, who wrote, in 1901, 
There is no uniformity in the methods or machinery of education in the 
states. But in its stead there prevails much of the local patriotism, which 
makes each of the leading communities proud of its own institutions, and 
keenly solicitous to produce such examples of good work as may prove 
worthy of imitation in other states and cities .. . Hence America may 
be regarded as a laboratory in which educational experiments are being 
tried out on a great scale, under conditions exceptionally favorable to the 
encouragement of inventiveness and fresh enthusiasm, and to the dis- 
covery of new methods and new truths.
-P-A-G-E-48
  32 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Such experimentation and enthusiasm, however, are due 
not to the desire for novelty; they have their roots in the 
popular attitude to education. Without a centralized au- 
thority to which to look for direction and guidance, local 
communities were compelled to seek their own educational 
salvation. Out of this variety of standards and experi- 
mentation based on local initiative and independence, leader- 
ship in education went from time to time to the most 
progressive and resulted in a search for and encouragement 
of a more scientific study of all phases of education. 
Democracy and Education 
Fundamentally the essence of American education rests 
on a demand for equality of opportunity for every boy and 
girl for the best possible types of education. The absence 
of social stratification, with opportunities for advancement 
through education mainly, furnishes for the American educa- 
tor one of the most searching problems with which the 
European educators have not been called upon to deal until 
recently. The system has to provide not merely two or 
three types of education, but types to suit the needs and 
abilities of each individual. The absence of one type of 
education for the masses and another for the leaders has 
made it incumbent on the student of education to make 
every year of schooling as rich and fruitful as possible. 
The problem of education is thus to train good citizens 
and at the same time to furnish freedom for individual 
development. In the secondary field the fact that the sec- 
ondary schools are open to all has given rise to a new situa- 
tion to which the traditional conceptions of a liberal 
education are no longer applicable, a problem that is further 
complicated by the fact that such education must look to 
the needs of an industrial and commercial society. The 
traditional views on culture are thus in the melting pot, 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 33 
and a new conception must be evolved suited to modern 
needs andj modern conditions. Both elementary and sec- 
ondary education have in their recent development de- 
manded a new orientation of educational aims and values 
and a sounder and more reliable psychology of individ- 
ual differences, new principles of curriculum-making, and 
more effective methods of instruction. 
Professionalization of Education 
A further problem was set by a demand from the public 
for better results. It was felt with the increasing cost of edu- 
cation, which set in at the beginning of the present century, 
that the schools did not accomplish what they set out to 
perform. Many pupils did not advance through the schools ; 
many dropped out before completing the minimum expected 
even in elementary education. This demand directed at- 
tention to a reéxamination of aims, processes, and methods, 
and in turn posited the development of a scientific attitude 
and scientific methods of investigation and research. Allied 
to this problem and equally influential in leading to a similar 
demand for scientific inquiry was the changing attitude on 
discipline. A society founded on faith in individual freedom 
refused to tolerate a type of discipline in the schools which 
rested on obedience to authority. Hence the task devolved 
on the educator to discover a substitute to replace external 
pressure and the imposition of the teacher’s will. 
From another aspect another influence was brought to 
bear on the student of education to approach his subject 
scientifically. Education rests on popular control and free 
discussion with great local freedom. The faith in education 
is widespread, but the educational administrator can only 
turn this to account if he brings to his task not merely a 
knowledge of education but an equally sound and thorough
-P-A-G-E-50
34 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
equipment in the principles of administration. Since edu- 
cational progress rests on popular will and consent, the ad- 
ministrator must understand his public and educate it up 
to new standards, and in a society where business efficiency 
is one of the cardinal virtues he must be no less efficient in the 
conduct of his office than the director of a large industrial 
concern spending an equal amount of money. Education 
has become one of the largest enterprises of the country for 
the management of which mere empiricism and routine will 
not suffice. A new field has thus been opened in the second 
half of the period under discussion, which requires a sound 
equipment not only in framing educational aims and policies 
but also in the principles of management and administra- 
tion. 
The attitude of the American people to the universities, 
and especially to those that are maintained by public taxa- 
tion, has resulted in a demand for service which has given 
them a new status in national life, barely realized in the 
European universities during the War. The agricultural 
colleges and experiment stations have for many years de- 
voted themselves to the task of bringing their scientific 
knowledge and equipment to bear on the practical work of 
the farmer. A similar function has been expected of the 
departments or schools of education in colleges and univer- 
sities, a task which has had the advantage of keeping such 
departments in close touch with practical everyday problems 
of the teacher and administrator and has provided them in 
turn with extensive laboratories both for experimentation 
and research. The study of education was thus saved from 
becoming academic and cultivating idols of the den. 
Finally, as a result of improving standards in the training 
of teachers, higher salaries, greater security of tenure, and 
the establishment of pensions, the occupation of teaching 
has changed from a craft to a profession. It may at once be
-P-A-G-E-51
  UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 35 
admitted that improvement in these respects has not been 
uniform, that many thousands of teachers are still inade- 
quately prepared, that annual appointments still prevail, 
and that salaries are grudgingly paid, but the fact remains 
that the tendency is strongly in the direction of professionali- 
zation. This development has been at once the result and 
the cause of the improved status of education as a profes- 
sional study. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the 
recent program of educational associations, national, state, 
and local, which have assumed an increasingly technical 
character and, as was recently noted by an English ob- 
server, give little attention, as contrasted with English or- 
ganization, to questions of group welfare. The absence 
of stratification within the different grades of teaching and 
the opportunity open to every serious student of education 
have both stimulated progressive study of education as the 
chief avenue for advancement. The same effect has been 
achieved by the slow but gradual disappearance of ‘poli- 
tics” from the conduct of educational affairs. At the same 
time the teacher is being given greater participation in the 
administration of professional matters; even though this 
may be provided legally in but few systems, the day when 
courses of study and methods are prescribed from above is 
gradually disappearing. Such encouragement of initiative, 
with promotion made dependent on improved training and 
study, has stimulated the establishment throughout the 
country of institutions for the advanced study of education. 
Teachers in Service 
The past twenty-five years have witnessed a radical change 
in the improvement of teachers in service. At the begin- 
ning of the period the teachers’ institute was still popular, 
though ineffective. Offered for but a few days each year, 
the courses of such institutes were haphazard, unorganized,
-P-A-G-E-52
  386 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and unconnected frequently with the requirements of class- 
room procedure, with inspirational lectures and entertain- 
ments to offset the meagerness of the programs. Their 
professional content and value were slight because teachers 
came unprepared and were not expected to show any re- 
sults. While the short-period institutes have survived, 
their character has changed; the work has become more 
highly technical and specialized to meet the needs of par- 
ticular groups of teachers and with a special bearing on the 
problems in which the teachers are daily interested. 
Institutes are, however, being replaced by opportunities 
for more intensive study conducted in some cases by teachers’ 
associations, in others in connection with local normal schools, 
teachers’ colleges, and education departments of universities. 
The work here offered, while not restricted to professional 
studies, largely revolves round these. It may include cul- 
tural courses, but in general covers courses in methods 
in special subjects, the organization of the curriculum, train- 
ing for positions as principals and supervisors, and pro- 
fessional studies in general, such as principles of teaching, 
philosophy of education, psychology, and tests and measure- 
ments. While much of this work is of an undergraduate 
character, it serves not merely to improve the service of the 
teacher but to promote a professional attitude, and to pre- 
pare for further advanced work. 
The effect of such organizations for the improvement of 
teachers in service becomes obvious in the increase of teachers 
attending summer schools maintained by normal schools, 
teachers’ colleges, and universities. The long summer vaca- 
tion combined with a growing practice of local boards to 
subsidize the attendance of their teachers either by scholar- 
ships or bonuses or by increases in salary contingent on 
successful work in the courses pursued, has increased 
the enrollment of summer schools in many cases beyond the 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 37 
capacity of the institutions to deal satisfactorily with the 
large numbers that present themselves. In 1921 a total of 
253,111 students, the majority of them teachers, attended 
summer schools in 410 institutions; of these 241 were uni- 
versities and degree-granting colleges, attended by 143,154 
students. Here again the work is predominantly of an 
undergraduate character, although a large proportion of 
the students attend for graduate study. The majority 
of the courses selected are professional. Whatever the 
nature of the studies, however, and whatever the standards, 
the distinguishing feature is that the teacher acquires the 
habit of further study and the supply of students serves both 
to raise the standards of professional attainment, and by its 
wide ramifications in which practice and theory react upon 
each other, the professional study of education is constantly 
vitalized and compelled to justify itself by its practical 
applicability. As in engineering and medicine, the pressure 
of practical situations, which are brought to a focus in the 
needs of teachers in service, has prevented the professional 
study of education from becoming too academic. It would 
be difficult to find in any other profession or in any other 
country, except in England and Scotland where similar work 
has recently been begun, such intense desire, as shown by 
teachers in summer schools, to keep abreast of the latest 
developments in their subject. 
The stimulus obtained from the “refresher” courses in 
summer schools, local institutions, and extension work is 
further strengthened by the enlistment of teachers in the 
revision and improvement of courses of study and in other 
ways in which their practical experience is helpful, by the 
increasingly frequent publication of official circulars and 
magazines dealing with current movements in education, and 
by the codperation of teachers with local or university bu- 
reaus of research. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
38 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
The greatest obstacle to the development of a profession 
of teaching at the beginning of the period under considera- 
tion was the absence of anything to encourage the exercise 
of initiative on the part of the teacher. Originating at a 
time when the facilities for training were inadequate, a sys- 
tem of local centralization developed in which the super- 
intendent undertook to prescribe with meticulous detail not 
merely the course of study but also the methods of instruc- 
tion. The result frequently was rigid uniformity within 
any one system, a tradition, which like the system of pay- 
ment by results in England, long hampered educational 
progress even after the requirement of normal school train- 
ing had been established in the larger areas. The change 
came but gradually and is not yet generally prevalent. 
Teachers are, however, being given more opportunities than 
formerly to codperate in the drafting of courses of study and 
greater initiative in the employment of methods of instruc- 
tion. 
Although formal agencies have been established in eighty- 
six school systems for the organization of such channels of 
coéperation, the informal selection by the superintendent of 
committees of teachers of recognized ability for specific 
purposes has been found more effective than the elected 
teachers’ councils. The important contribution of such 
systems of coéperation lies in the improvement of profes- 
sional standards and in the promotion of professional study. 
If teachers are to enjoy opportunities to make available 
their knowledge and experience, it follows that such contri- 
butions can only be of value and carry weight if based on a 
thorough appreciation not merely of the problems involved 
but of the need of a scientific attitude in education. 
It may be objected that, with more than 150,000 untrained 
and relatively unprepared teachers employed in the schools 
of the country, it is premature even to-day to talk of the pro-
-P-A-G-E-55
UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 39 
fessionalization of teachers. But, as Sir Michael Sadler 
has pointed out, democracy in its advance presents a ragged 
edge; the great hope of a democracy, and particularly a 
democracy without a centralized authority, lies in experi- 
mentation and variation, and the advance so far made by 
those teachers who are in the van of progress marks the route 
yet to be traveled but free from the handicaps and obstacles 
encountered by the pioneers. 
Agencies for Research and Investigation 
The absence of a centralized national authority, while 
it has had the advantage of placing the responsibility for 
educational progress on local bodies, meant also the absence 
of an agency for setting standards and for investigation. 
The only guidance and direction available were afforded 
by a comparison of the efforts and results of the work 
achieved by the local systems themselves. The great ser- 
vice of the United States Bureau of Education, handicapped 
though it is by a lack of compulsory powers, has lain largely 
in the collection of information on the progress of education 
throughout the country and in directing attention through 
its reports and bulletins to progressive movements in all 
branches and fields of education both here and abroad. 
Early in the course of the past quarter-century the need was 
felt for something more than generalized reports and statistics 
to enable the school systems to evaluate their achievements 
and defects. Professor Royce had already advocated, in 
the nineties, the appointment of consulting psychologists 
to devise and recommend better methods of instruction ; 
and this suggestion was repeated by Chancellor in one of the 
earliest books on school administration. In 1905 Professor 
G. H. Locke urged the importance of the investigation of 
school systems by outside agencies — ‘‘a thorough study of 
the system of schools in a city, its organization and ad-
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
ministration, its curriculum, indeed the methods by which 
the city undertakes to afford opportunities for education to 
its boys and girls.” Such investigations, he suggested, might 
properly be undertaken by departments of education in 
colleges and universities — a practice which would at the 
same time keep such departments in close touch with prac- 
tice. A similar suggestion was put forward in 1907 by 
Professor M. V. O’Shea — ‘‘What we need to do is to see 
to it that departments of education are first of all investigat- 
ing institutions.” 
Excellent though these suggestions were they were com- 
pelled to wait for their success for the development of an 
adequate technique that would raise the results of any in- 
vestigations above the level of mere personal opinion. 
Nothing had as yet been done in discussing in the field of 
educational administration such questions as the standards 
of buildings and equipment, the selection of textbooks, re- 
ports and accounting, educational finance, rating of teachers, 
and similar questions. Statistical technique in educational 
psychology was in its infancy and little had yet been ac- 
complished in devising standard tests and measurements. 
Nor was there any definite agreement on the aims and pur- 
poses of education, although guidance was to come shortly 
from the work and writings of John Dewey. © Investigations 
by external authorities were, however, beginning to be 
demanded, in some cases by the public in order to discover 
the status of their school systems, in others by the superin- 
tendents and teachers, in self-defense. The first survey, 
made in Montclair in 1911, represented the personal opinion 
of one expert; within less than four years the character of 
surveys was changed and personal opinion, however expert, 
yielded to objective standards based on a completely de- 
veloped technique of tests and measurements; quantitative 
methods were substituted for qualitative methods and personal
-P-A-G-E-57
  UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 41 
opinions, and while the results are not yet sufficiently exten- 
sive and advanced to furnish the basis for a clearer state- 
ment of educational aims and ideals, the procedure of the 
classroom has been greatly affected by the movement. 
The development of the survey as a method of educational 
accounting and control is dealt with elsewhere in this book. 
From the point of view of the present chapter its signifi- 
cance has lain in the stimulus that it has given to and the 
demands that it levies upon the student of education in all 
its branches — administration, psychology, methods, curric- 
ula, and soon. Educational theory can no longer be based 
on authority and tradition; it must be related to practical 
needs and must constantly be infused with a critical and 
inquiring attitude of mind. The survey movement is the 
American substitute for governmental inspection ; but sum- 
marizes in itself all the differences that distinguish a system 
of education centrally organized and slowly responsive 
to changing conceptions and requirements in education 
from a system that is based on variety and local initiative, 
that is self-critical and perhaps too alert and too sensitive 
to the varying demands of rapidly changing social condi- 
tions. Whatever the weaknesses, however, the survey 
method has changed the professional study of education from 
an academic and theoretical study to a laboratory science. 
In a more real sense than was ever dreamed of by Sir Joshua 
Fitch in 1900, the schools and school systems of the country 
have become the experimental stations of a vast array of 
organizations for the study of education; and experimenta- 
tion by trial and error methods is being replaced by experi- 
mentation under the control of scientific methods. 
The conduct of surveys was in the early stages intrusted 
to a few individuals, but in the later development it has be- 
come an important codperative enterprise, requiring a large 
force of collaborators, a long period of time, and the expendi-
-P-A-G-E-58
  
42 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
ture of large sums of money. These requirements were in 
many cases met by the entry into the field of educational 
inquiry of wealthy private foundations. Thus the General 
Education Board, established in 1902, has conducted a num- 
ber of local and state surveys and has contributed consider- 
ably by a wise expenditure of funds to the improvement of 
education in the South ; the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching, established in 1906, has conducted 
important surveys in a number of fields — standardiza- 
tion of colleges, legal and medical education, the profes- 
sional preparation of teachers, and the organization of 
education in a state. The Russell Sage Foundation, es- 
tablished in 1907, very early gave a much-needed impetus 
to the quantitative and objective study of education and 
has made several important surveys. Finally, one of the 
youngest of these foundations, the Commonwealth Fund, es- 
tablished in 1918, is subsidizing valuable studies in educa- 
tional finance, the organization of the content in several 
subjects, and investigations in educational psychology. 
The developments of the last decade have justified the antici- 
pation of Professor J. H. Tufts in 1909 that “‘if we can show 
that we want to do something worth doing, that we know how 
to set about it, and that we are broad enough in our vision 
to look beyond our machinery to the larger personal and 
social welfare, means for investigation will not be wanting.” 
Such foundations, however, are interested in the main in 
pointing the way and in opening up and stimulating new 
fields of inquiry. There still remains the desirability of 
establishing permanent agencies of investigation and re- 
search. The more progressive communities in the United 
States are ready to welcome the scientific. collection and 
interpretation of statistical and other data referring to 
schools, while trained educators are equally ready for op- 
portunities in the practical field for scientific research, the
-P-A-G-E-59
  UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 43 
results of which may be utilized for the formulation of edu- 
cational policies. The occasional survey, while it was of 
great value, only pointed the way to the creation of per- 
manent local bureaus of reference and research. New York 
City was the earliest to establish such a Division of Reference 
and Research in 1913 and has been followed by a number 
of other important centers, both city and state. The charac- 
ter of the work of such bureaus varies; in some cases the 
whole field of education is covered; in others only the ad- 
ministrative and statistical aspects; in others again only 
measurements and tests. The university departments of 
education, particularly in the state-maintained institutions, 
have also recognized their opportunities and obligations in 
this direction and both informally through individual mem- 
bers of their faculties and through formally organized bureaus 
have entered the field of codéperative research in education. 
In this way they serve as centers for the direction of in- 
quiries into problems submitted to them by local school 
systems, for the collecting and interpretation of data, and 
for the publication and dissemination of results; in a num- 
ber of instances opportunities for purely experimental work 
are furnished by schools attached to such departments. 
The first bureau of this type was established in 1913 at the 
University of Oklahoma and has been followed by the crea- 
tion of bureaus in other universities and in teachers’ col- 
leges. 
The work of both city and state bureaus and of university 
bureaus of research culminated in the organization in 1916 
of a National Association of Directors of Educational Re- 
search, now the Educational Research Association, whose 
aims are the promotion of the practical use of quantitative 
methods in educational research and the improvement of 
the efficiency of educational administration, supervision, 
and teaching by means of scientific methods.
-P-A-G-E-60

Only a reference is necessary to the numerous professional 
associations for the promotion and discussion of educational 
research. A comparison of programs of the societies that 
were in existence at the beginning of the past quarter-century 
and at the end of this period will serve to indicate the road 
and distance that the study of education has traveled. The 
Proceedings of the National Education Association, of the 
Department of Superintendence, and of the National So- 
ciety for the Study of Education tell their own story. More 
recently there have been established the National Society 
of College Teachers of Education, the Educational Research 
Association, Section L, of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, the National Conference on Edu- 
cational Method, and numerous local societies, all devoted 
to the advancement of the study of education on a scientific 
basis, to the improvement of all branches of education, and 
ultimately to placing the vocation of teaching on a profes- 
sional footing. 
The Formal Study of Education 
The account of the study of education up to this point 
has dealt in the main with the factors that contributed to 
its development as a result of the public attitude to educa- 
tion, and of the practical demands of the schools themselves. 
It is difficult in dealing with any applied science to disen- 
tangle the share contributed from practical needs and situa- 
tions and the share derived from pure science. So in the 
field of education it is not a simple matter to apportion 
equitably the stimulus that has been given to its develop- 
ment in the last twenty-five years by the necessities of class- 
room procedure and of administration on the one hand and 
the formal organization of and research into the different 
branches of the subject that have taken place in the uni- 
versities. It is not necessary here to indicate the growth in
-P-A-G-E-61
UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 45 
the number of graduate schools of education, the number of 
courses offered, and the enrollment of students. From the 
point of view of this chapter, greater interest attaches to 
the development of the content and subject matter sub- 
sumed under the general term of education. 
At the beginning of the period under discussion the study 
of education, whether in normal schools or in colleges, was 
limited to a few fields and with very little differentiation. 
Virtually the only specialization possible was between prepa- 
ration for service in the elementary or in the secondary field. 
The subjects of study were included sometimes under the 
blanket term ‘‘pedagogy,” sometimes ‘‘school management 
and pedagogy”; in a few places courses in history of educa- 
tion and psychology or child study were gradually begin- 
ning to appear. No provision was yet made for training 
the supervisor, principal, superintendent, or any of the other 
specialized workers in education; training for these fields 
was to be obtained by experience. The courses offered by 
Teachers College, Columbia University, for 1897-98 may be 
taken as an adequate and representative summary of the 
status of education as a special study at that time: 
Psychology and General Method Methods of Teaching English 
Advanced Psychology and General Composition 
Method The Teaching of History in

Primary Methods Methods of Teaching Math- 
History of Education (2 courses) ematics in Elementary and

School Management Kindergarten Department 
School Supervision and School (11 courses) 
Management Methods of Teaching Domes- 
Elementary Methods tie Science 
Principles of Art Education Methods of Teaching Sewing 
Methods of Teaching English 
Literature 
Within ten years these courses had become so differen- 
tiated that the following list could be compiled in 1905-06 :
-P-A-G-E-62

Principles of Education Secondary Schools 
Philosophy of Education School Systems 
Educational Theory Contemporary Education 
History of Education School Law 
Educational Classics School Administration 
General Methods School Hygiene 
With these were continued the courses in methods of special 
subjects. 
Five years later it became possible to consider seriously 
the problem of research within the field of education. 
Hitherto the various studies were isolated and unconnected 
subjects within the larger field. After 1910 the field grad- 
ually became so wide and its subdivisions so highly specialized 
that no student could be expected to master them all. The 
rapid development of facilities for the graduate study of 
education leading to advanced degrees may be said to have 
begun at that time. The reasons have already been sug- 
gested in other parts of this chapter. The publication of 
Monroe’s Textbook in the History of Education in 1905 had 
already indicated the possibilities in that field and had 
stimulated a number of special studies and contributions, 
which gradually led to the expansion of the subject into a 
number of highly diversified courses, including new research 
into the historical development of education both in this 
country and elsewhere and establishing the value of the 
historical outlook as an important method of approach to 
the study of principles. The work of John Dewey opened 
up a new field of inquiry into the philosophical and social 
bases underlying education and, while it has not stimulated 
any considerable contributions in philosophy of education, 
it has influenced most of the investigations made in the 
last decade or more on principles of education, the course 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
UNIVERSITY STUDY OF EDUCATION 47 
of study, and methods of instruction. At the same time 
this field of study and inquiry has been compelled to take 
into account the extensive contributions which have been 
made since 1902 by the psychologists, for whom a new field 
was opened up by Professor Thorndike both in educational 
psychology and in educational statistics. An entirely new 
subject has been added to the list, as a result of Dewey’s 
emphasis on the social aspects of education, under the title 
of Educational Sociology — an inquiry into social and group 
life and its effect on educational aims and purposes. 
The same period has also witnessed the development of a 
specialized study of educational administration, which re- 
sulted from the revelation of the general ignorance of such 
matters as the classification of pupils, retardation and elimi- 
nation, school finance, adequate accounting and reports, 
and in general the absence of a suitable relation between the 
hours spent for education and the products of the schools. 
The practical demands for expert guidance, as revealed by 
the surveys, have led to the development of specialized 
training for expert administrators and superintendents in 
such problems as the following : 
_ Problems of teaching, involving the study of methods employed with a 
view to improving the results achieved; problems of supervision with 
the confident expectation that the efficiency of teachers might be increased 
through the methods which were employed ; the classification of children ; 
the fiscal administration of schools, including cost accounting, budget- 
making, salaries and salary schedules, the distribution of state school 
funds; the development of adequate systems of taxation; the develop- 
ment of building programs; studies of equipment to be provided; the 
setting up of an adequate attendance service; the methods of handling 
school publicity ; the installation of an adequate system of records and re- 
ports; the development of a set of rules for boards of education; the 
revision of sections of city charters dealing with education; the codifica- 
tion of state laws for education; the development of an adequate health 
service; the reorganization of curricula for the training of teachers; the 
organization of a rural community in relation to a modern rural school ; 
and the like. (Based on G. D. Strayer, in Studies in Education, Educa- 
tional Monographs of the Society of College Teachers of Education, 
Number Xi, 1922, p. 98.)
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
The opportunities for specialization in elementary, sec- 
ondary, and rural education have similarly been expanded 
and fructified by the recent developments in psychology, 
philosophy of education, and social studies. Hach field has 
been analyzed in turn, its needs and problems have been 
appraised, and technical courses have been elaborated for 
the specialists. In another direction, the practical-minded- 
ness of the American public and a desire to give a suitable 
equipment to each boy and girl for a life career have led to 
the development of specialized training for teachers and 
organizers of vocational and agricultural education and in 
home economics, all of which have been specially stimulated 
and fostered by federal subsidy. 
The emergency created by the War was for the nation as a 
whole more revealing than any survey; the mass of facts 
collected in connection with the organization of the army 
and other activities revealed deficiencies in American edu- 
cation, hitherto suspected, perhaps, but not statistically 
verified. The lack of preparation of a large percentage 
of the teachers, the importance and needs of rural education, 
the prevalence of physical defects and inadequate provision 
for health education, the problems of immigrant and adult 
illiteracy, and the low standard of education in general were 
revealed, and, while alarming, have had the effect of em- 
phasizing the need of further study and improved training 
both of teachers in general and of experts in the different 
fields here mentioned. 
What this specialization in the various branches of educa- 
tion has resulted in may be indicated by the organization of 
the College of Education of the University of Minnesota, 
which may be regarded as typical of the organization in 
other state universities and a number of the larger private 
institutions, offering both undergraduate and graduate work. 
The following departments are there maintained: history

cation; agricultural education ; home economics education ;

earlier and to indicate the ramifications in the professional 
study of education as organized to-day. The various

The study of education has emerged from its swaddling 
clothes in the period covered by this chapter; neglected and 
hidden under the egis of other subjects or departments, 
education has become in most universities the field through 
which the greatest service is done to society. Statistical 
presentations might have indicated the number of students, 
both undergraduate and graduate, engaged in this study 
and the amount and cost of buildings and equipment de- 
voted to its pursuit, but nothing speaks so eloquently as 
the list of courses here given of the vast field for human en- 
deavor that has been made explicit in the past twenty-five 
years. The schools need well-prepared teachers, but society
-P-A-G-E-70

needs still more the guidance and direction of specialists 
and experts, and if faith is to be cultivated in them, it can 
only come, as it is more and more coming, through the ex- 
istence and cultivation of a scientific study of the subjects 
that they profess. This has been made possible in less than 
half of the twenty-five years here discussed. If only pass- 
ing reference has been made to the dark spots that still 
exist in education in the United States, this has not been 
done to glorify the advances made in the study of education, 
but in the belief that the instruments already perfected will 
remove the deficiencies that still remain, and find new fields 
to conquer. A

CHAPTER III 
TENDENCIES IN EpucATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 
Introduction 
The philosophy of education will here mean the determined 
effort to find out what education should do in the face of 
contradictory demands coming to it from the deeply rooted 
but relatively distinct interests of life. As life presents ever 
new phases, so education will face very varying demands. 
The philosophy of education will accordingly vary much 
with the times. Since each decision, however, must take 
due account of the whole of experience, the philosophy of 
education will seek to base itself as best it can on such views 
of the functioning of experience as will furnish a maximum 
of guidance. In spite, then, of the great variation due to 
shifting problems, there will be for any one system of such 
philosophy a relatively abiding body of attitudes and points 
of view which will enter largely into the consideration and 
solution of each new conflict as it arises. Finally, to the 
degree that a consistent point of view can be attained, the 
school system should consistently exemplify this view. The 
history here undertaken will accordingly take account of 
three intermingling constituents: of the new problems that 
have successively arisen during the period under review, of 
the new points of view that have emerged, and of the effort 
to develop a unified and consistent system of thought and 
procedure. 
The Traditional Background of the Study 
Before tracing the successive demands and consequent 
changes, it will be well to ask, What was the situation at the 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  58 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
opening of our period, the last decade of the nineteenth 
century? What were, at the time, the dominant points of 
view? The answer is not difficult. The oldest substratum 
point of view of American education was of course the com- 
mon stock of custom and procedure brought from the old 
world. In this the school was closely associated with the 
church. The coercive measures of school discipline and the 
stress on memorizing fitted well with the prevailing doctrine 
of total depravity. Naive and uncritical acceptance of 
established custom was perhaps the dominant note. Be- 
ginning about a century ago and lasting well-nigh to the 
nineties Pestalozzianism in varying form broke into this 
established custom and in some measure dissipated the 
prevailing uncritical attitude. Thus it was increasingly 
demanded that pupils ‘“‘understand”’ what they ‘‘learned.” 
For this ‘“‘object lessons’? were devised. Education was 
conceived as a process of ‘leading out,” not of “pouring in.” 
The conception of ‘‘methods” and devices as aids to teaching 
became common. From various causes the harsher measures 
of coercion were being mitigated; but so far there was no 
deep-lying reconstruction. 
The Beginnings of a Scientific Attack 
The decade before our period opens saw a variety of 
influences and movements tending powerfully to break up 
the uncritical acceptance of custom. Herbert Spencer’s 
fame, then at its height, called emphatic attention to his 
previously published essays on education. His: insistence 
on science and on the theory of punishment by natural con- 
sequences influenced many. His discussion of comparative 
values helped largely to introduce a term and conception 
destined to have great influence. Froebel’s writings, by their 
striking opposition to the existing ideas and practices, had 
effects more far-reaching than the number of the kinder-
-P-A-G-E-75
Pe Ae NK Se COINS SenOL NOG M mmr Seager ee renee yee 
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 59 
gartens then established would indicate. Whatever else 
may be said, Froebel had a point of view, an inclusive system 
based on a philosophy, in other words a philosoplay of 
education worked out into a correlative system of procedure. 
The very idea challenged thought. Even those who reacted 
most violently either against Froebel’s philosophy or against 
his educational system must be impressed »with the con- 
nection between the two. In so far as this was true, here 
was an ideal which even his opponents’ could enjoy. Pe- 
culiarly stimulating also was Froebel’s idea of a school 
without books. Education and sehooling separate things? 
Once the idea was clearly disengaged, it would not down. 
Something must be done abowt it. The almost holy zeal of 
the Froebelians assisted much to increase these effects. 
Two American reformers stand out in this seed-bed decade, 
and later, as forces whieh helped greatly in the ferment — 
Francis W. Parker and G. Stanley Hall. Both had studied 
in Germany, and so had got outside our customary point of 
view. Each in his,own way began to stir American edu- 
cation, each calling attention to a factor increasingly em- 
bodied since in the American viewpoint. Colonel Parker, 
first near Boston and later in Chicago, roused great en- 
thusiasm by showing what could be done if child nature 
were treated sympathetically. President Hall was more 
the scholar. He emphasized the study of psychology as a 
practical agency in education. Child study, the psychology 
of childhood and adolescence, the accumulation of life data, 
even his emphasis on recapitulation — these had their due 
part in putting the study of education on a scientific basis. 
To appraise his scientific contribution is for present purposes 
not necessary. But America believes, as does no other 
country, that education must be based on a study of psy- 
chology. That this is so is due in no small degree to the 
influence of President Hall. These two men thus from    
-P-A-G-E-76

  . 60 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
different angles helped materially to make education an 
objéet of serious study, which is perhaps the greatest single 
sine et to be recorded in this account. ii 
< Herbartianism 
\ 
Among the formative influences of the period under con- 
sideration none is more pronounced perhaps than Herbar- 
tianism as it was brought to this country by Charles De 
Garmo and the brothers Charles and Frank McMurry. 
Each had studied abroad at Jena and Leipzig, the great 
centers of German ‘“‘petlagogy,”’ at the time when the 
prestige of German thought. stood probably at the zenith 
of its influence in our history. \\The doctrines of interest and 
apperception, the culture-epoch theory, and the five formal 
steps, which these men brought back with them, offered in 
the aggregate a body of educational thought as simple in 
conception as it was attractive in ‘theory. Moreover, it 
worked. If the culture-epoch theory lacked somewhat of 
supplying a complete curriculum, it helped greatly to enrich 
the work of the lower grades. And what could be more 
practical than the five formal steps? Can, we wonder that 
the normal schools, almost with one accord, accepted these 
as the basis of their lesson plans? As for apperception, it 
was so evidently true that men only wondered that they had 
not always preached it. The doctrine of interest too, how 
simple it all was and how true! ” 
But here came the rub. These things were obviously 
true only if one looked at them in certain ways. The stiff- 
necked just wouldn’t look at them from the right angle. 
Disputes arose. In the end it appears clear that the service 
rendered by the Herbartian movement was not to contribute 
a permanent deposit of educational theory—no single item 
of their doctrines remains as they taught it — but rather to 
stimulate thought. Attacking squarely, as this movement
-P-A-G-E-77
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 61 
did, so much of what then prevailed, it brought conscious 
attention to almost the whole range of theory regarding the 
educative process. To settle the disputes thus raised resort 
was had to new material. Biology as remade by the doc- 
trine of evolution offered perhaps the richest single source of 
supply. In the utilization of new materials, as is later in- 
dicated, education here made significant advance. 
Hegelianism 
Hegelianism was another contributing factor in the be- 
ginning of our twenty-five year period. Its fame, however, 
was greater than its influence. Rosenkranz was the out- 
standing author, as William T. Harris was the outstanding 
American defender. It seems rather probable that the 
translation of Rosenkranz made under Dr. Harris’s direction 
gave the term “philosophy of education”’ its first strong 
hold in America. The association with ‘‘metaphysics” was, 
however, in later years nearly sufficient to drive the very 
name “‘philosophy of education”’ from American institutions 
of learning — so great was the reaction when it came. The 
actual influence of Hegelianism in American study of edu- 
cation was at all times limited, although Dr. Harris was for 
years probably our most outstanding student of education. 
He is called by a contributor in Monroe’s The Cyclopedia of 
Education, Vol. III, p. 220, ‘‘ America’s first great educational 
philosopher,” and it is there stated of him that ‘‘he developed 
such insight into school problems as was enjoyed by none of 
his predecessors and by few if any of his contemporaries.” 
Both statements may well be admitted ; but it is in this day 
difficult to understand how one could so stand out in his own 
time and yet leave so little permanent impression on the 
present existing body of accepted thought. To say the least, 
Hegelianism is radically out of harmony with the prevailing 
temper of present-day inquiry. Certainly among educa- - 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tional students of the present, few seem disposed to acknowl- 
edge appreciable indebtedness to this movement. 
Dr. Harris did, however, exert influence and certainly for 
good; but it was with him as with the Herbartians — he 
contributed more to the ferment of ideas, more to the stimu- 
lation of thought, than to the present accepted body of 
educational theory. His clashes with the Herbartians 
furnished not a few of the occasions where, as he might have 
said, it was necessary to transcend both in order to mediate 
the conflict. The famous dispute over ‘‘interest”’ and 
“effort”’ thus called forth Professor Dewey’s monograph, 
Interest as Related to Will. 
One of Dr. Harris’s chief interests was the kindergarten. 
With the collaboration of Miss Susan E. Blow, there was 
elaborated a theory of Hegelian Froebelianism which for a 
goodly number of years virtually dominated in that field. 
The use of symbolism that was retained in this system and 
the general metaphysical basis of the system were again 
points of attack and sources of stimulation to opposed 
thought. It is a justified anticipation of results, coming in 
the latter half of our period, to say that in the end the 
opposition to any and all Hegelianism and symbolism has 
won the battle and now holds almost undisputed sway. A 
scientific psychology and the general American rejection of 
“‘metaphysics”’ have carried the day for a theory in keeping 
with the dominant ideas later to be discussed. 
To ask why Hegelianism failed to gain a permanent footing 
in American educational thought offers an easy introduction 
to the present prevailing philosophic theory relating to 
education. No pretense at completeness at this point is 
made, but two outstanding features will help the further 
discussion. First, prevailing American thought is suspicious 
of any system that does not manifest the most cordial rela- 
1 Later rewritten as Interest and Effort in Education.
-P-A-G-E-79
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 63 
tionships with experimental science and with its immediate 
and derived procedures for reaching positions worthy of 
belief. Anything approaching an a priori attack is, rightly 
or wrongly, discredited in advance. Second, the prevailing 
American temper demands that the ideas presented for its 
serious consideration shall be such as promise directly or 
indirectly to help in the solution of its insistent problems. 
That some regret this tendency is true. That many con- 
ceive our insistent problems narrowly is equally true. That 
most are averse to any sustained effort to take into systematic 
account all pertinent data is still further true. But the 
main tendency seems undeniable. Intellectual America has 
on the whole accepted both these attitudes. It is mainly 
interested in meeting life’s problems. It accepts the 
procedure of verifiable science as its safest road to reliable 
thinking. Second only to making education an object of 
serious study, the gradual acceptance of these two positions 
as a conscious philosophy constitutes the outstanding feature 
of the development herein discussed. 
The Problems of a Philosophy of Education 
With this somewhat lengthy introduction, let us now 
approach our problem, the tracing of the development of the 
philosophy of education in the United States within the past 
twenty-five years. 
As defined at the outset the philosophy of education will 
differ in important respects from any one of the sciences. 
Such a philosophy functions. essentially at conflict points 
only, and these will change with the march of events. The 
philosophy of education will thus seem to the scientist to 
shift its interest with astonishing rapidity; and what is to 
him even more disconcerting, its specific decisions will often 
undergo consideration and perhaps revision. While such 
shift and revision are inherent in a study that attempts to  
-P-A-G-E-80
  64 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
deal with the contradictory demands of life in a growing 
world, it does not follow that there is no accumulation of 
valuable points of view. The contrary is distinctly true. 
Many of life’s problems are both permanent and ever varying. 
Man remains practically the same. The conditions under 
which he lives change. Our study then will consider prin- 
cipally two phases, the successive major problems that have 
presented themselves during the period under consideration, 
and the accumulation of points of view helpful for their 
solution. The problems that have presented themselves 
may in turn be conveniently divided into two groups, those 
that have come to education from the outside, especially from 
the world of affairs, and those that have arisen from the 
inside, particularly from within the world of thought, which 
has all the while functioned in the philosophy of education, 
whether consciously or unconsciously. Of course no sharp 
separation here is either desirable or feasible. The presen- 
tation of the problems here made will be so directed as even- 
tually to place in review before us the content of the study as 
it now presents itself. We begin with the demands that 
have come from without. 
External Influences: Economic Changes 
Since the school has come into existence largely to prepare 
each rising generation for its more adequate participation in 
society and life, practically every line of human interest and 
endeavor will make demand on the school. Among the 
movements characteristic of the modern world none is more 
outstanding than industrialism and its attendant changes. 
Its influence on the school was long delayed, but during the 
period under review this influence in American life came at 
length to consciousness in a new sense and degree. The 
growing urbanization of the American people, the steady 
movement of historic industries from home to factory, the
-P-A-G-E-81
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 65 
increasing complexity of life meant, on the one hand, new and 
more numerous demands for adjustment from the young. 
They meant, on the other hand, the gradual removal of 
opportunity which first-hand participation and easy observa- 
tion had formerly granted to youth for making its needed 
adjustments. Greater demands on the young and fewer 
opportunities in home and community contacts mean in 
effect a greatly changed demand on the school. Both the 
content of school learning and the character of school ex- 
perience would have to be greatly modified if social life were 
not greatly to suffer. Curriculum and method must change. 
Immigration 
But this was not all. The immigrant complicated the 
situation. History has nowhere else seen a peaceful invasion 
so numerous, so varied, or so long-continued as that to which 
this country has been subjected. How to unify the never- 
ending stream of newcomers into the social body had always 
been a concern with theorists. Now the problem became 
acute. Even the man in the street must notice. In the 
industrial centers school buildings could hardly be erected 
fast enough to house the incoming numbers. But the real 
problem lay deeper. Increasingly did the newcomers aggre- 
gate themselves into relatively compact masses, in many re- 
spects merely transplanting their old life, but often under 
less healthful social conditions. Transplanted*church and 
newspaper generally used the language of ‘‘the old country.” 
A parochial school was introduced, often as a conscious rival 
to the public schools. The question of unification had be- 
come obviously difficult. 
Industrial Stratification 
Nor is the picture yet complete. Industrialism easily 
means extremes of wealth and accordingly of culture and
-P-A-G-E-82
66 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
outlook. The ever greater immigration increased these 
differences. Democracy became increasingly difficult of 
practice. In industrial centers, crowded particularly with 
the more recent and poorer immigrant workers, there was 
socially less and less commingling between old and new 
stocks and both politically and economically more and more 
opposition between ‘‘mass” and ‘‘class.” Private schools 
for the wealthy made, from another angle, further inroads 
on the public schools. These conditions, aggravated by an 
unusual arrogance of “‘big business” near the beginning of 
our period, raised for anxious thought some of the most 
fundamental questions of life. What about our boasted 
American democracy? Can it survive the passing of the 
frontier and the industrial urbanization of our people? 
What in fact is democracy? Should it not include all social 
relationships and among them the industrial? What does 
socialization inherently mean and what is the relation of 
education? What is the relation of labor and leisure to life 
itself? Is there a dualism here? What, after all, con- 
stitutes the good life; and what can education do? What 
in fact is the relation between the two? And what about 
progress? Can we any longer believe in inevitable progress 
— that easy compound of benevolent theology, easy-going 
evolution, and pride in a gloriously painted national history? 
It is literally true that the conscious philosophy of edu- 
cation as here to be traced largely originated for America just 
at this tide in American history. Complacency was jarred, 
as a century and more ago, “‘out of its dogmatic slumber” ; 
and thought in this country awoke to ask these far-reaching 
questions. Education became in a new sense and degree 
self-conscious. In the attempt to answer these questions 
new points of view were attained, as later discussed, which 
constitute a worthy addition to the world’s stock of ideas. 
The study of the meaning and function of education in the
-P-A-G-E-83
    TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 67 
experience process and in relation to the social progress 
assumed a new dignity. 
Vocational Education 
Among the influences of industrialism on social life, few 
seem more natural, once the idea is suggested, than its 
demand for ‘‘vocational” education. The argument seems 
easy and convincing that the young should be trained to 
take their parts in the great economic system. Hach person 
should not only carry his own weight but add besides some- 
thing to the common economic stock. Productive occupa- 
tion is obligatory on all. But preparation is necessary, at 
any rate for many lines of endeavor. Let us then have trade 
and other vocational schools. But here questions begin to 
arise. What shall be the relation of such schools and their 
educational programs to the general programs of the existing 
public schools? At once demands of ‘‘efficiency” and 
“culture” and citizenship come forward. Are trade schools 
to turn out “hands”? ‘‘Hands” or no, surely they must be 
efficient. And the advocates of efficiency, questioning 
whether the needed preparation can be intrusted to the 
ordinary school system, propose a dual system with business 
men in charge of the new schools. Their opponents rise and 
question whether children are to be exploited for the ad- 
vantage of industry and, more fundamentally still, whether 
we are trying to perpetuate the status quo in industrial rela- 
tionships. So that what began seemingly as a simple 
. matter of industrial demand and supply turns out to have 
far-reaching complications, a question that cannot be settled 
simply by asking the needs of one life interest. The char- 
acter of the good life, equal participation therein, equal 
opportunities in education, progress, socialization, the 
existing economic order, — these are some of the questions 
implicated. Clearly no partial inquiry by specially in-

terested groups could do justice to such a subject as this. 
Philosophy of education finds in this one of its insistent 
current problems. 
Social Unrest 
Along with a growing industrialism and the fact of great 
immigration were other factors, some more or less inde- 
pendent, others obviously related. The passing of the 
frontier —land for settlement practically free for the 
asking — closed an outlet hitherto available for certain 
expanding, or “‘outbreaking,” spirits, and increased the 
pressure especially upon our economic institutions. Equal- 
ity of opportunity was in a true sense lessened. One main 
prop of our historic democracy had been removed. It is 
highly probable that in this we find part of the intenser 
demand for ‘‘radical” treatment of our economic system. 
These considerations do not mean that the quality of in- 
justice had been changed. From the earliest colonial days 
great and exasperating inequalities had been present to 
plague social life. But in the passing of free land a ‘‘safety 
valve” had been removed. The increased pressure here 
from the one side brought its reaction in opposition, and 
American ‘‘practical’’ thought began to consider coercion 
and suppression in a way that seemed to many others a clear 
reversal of the traditional American attitude. The assassina- 
tion of President McKinley by a crazed anarchist of out- 
landish name had already directed attention to a situation 
that seemed to call for special treatment, and the steps then 
taken had paved the way for a new and wider acceptance of 
“strong” measures in the line of legal control. The fact 
that the unpalatable doctrines were frequently taught by 
foreigners and generally were aimed at economic reconstruc- 
tion served to increase the feelings of separation and oppo- 
sition already described. Constructive opinion turned more 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 69 
consciously to the need of unifying measures and leaned more 
strongly than ever upon the school as the best agency to 
accomplish this end. At first this was often a blind and 
almost mystic faith, but at any rate a common consciousness 
was being aroused, and more specific thought was being 
directed as to how the needed unity might reasonably be 
attained. The problem of the school as a conscious agency 
of social unification had been added to the pressing problems 
of a wider and deeper educational theory. 
The World War and Social Control 
While this was going on, the World War came and in- 
creased greatly certain aspects of the strain. All who con- 
templated the entry of this country into the war on the side 
with France and England saw the critical danger of divisions 
here due to the continued maintenance of old world alle- 
giances and antagonisms. The cry against ‘‘hyphenism” was 
raised and much social pressure resulted. With our actual 
entry into the war, this pressure assumed legal (often illegal) 
and military forms. Into this situation a further complica- 
tion was added by the effort of certain ‘radical’ labor 
groups to profit by the general unsettled condition of affairs. 
This allowed the advocates of coercion to assume the cloak 
of patriotism; and under this guise there was an increasing 
acceptance of the doctrine that forcible suppression is a 
proper method of social control in dealing with unpalatable 
doctrines. ‘‘ Military necessity’? opened the door, and legal 
control of ideas entered. The demand arose that the schools 
not only be purged of any ‘‘improper’’ doctrines but become 
actual propagandists of “sound” positions. Bills were 
passed in various states requiring the teaching of ‘‘democ- 
racy’’ or the ‘‘constitution.” New York went furthest in 
expelling Socialists from its legislature and in passing the 
“Tusk bills’? aimed to close a socialist school in New York

City and to expel from the public school system any teachers 
who had ever advocated any change in the form of govern- 
ment of the state or nation. 
Thus was given to the philosophy of education one of its 
most insistent and most complex problems. The problems 
of “freedom of speech,” of ‘‘freedom of teaching,” in short 
the whole problem of social control in a democracy, assumed 
a new dress and insistency. The effort to solve these gives 
to the world-old problems of curriculum and method added 
complications: What shall we do with current controversial 
questions? Shall we ignore or take sides or present both 
sides? Shall we let children remain in ignorance of such 
problems, leaving them to the indoctrination of partisan 
homes? Or shall we tell them what to think, indoctrinating 
them with the ideas of the group in control for the time being 
of the schools? Or shall we raise the disputed questions and 
see that the pupils feel the opposed issues, and teach them 
primarily methods of attack? It would indeed be hard to 
find a problem that promises more trouble ahead than this. 
Almost every deep-rooted interest makes its demand, and 
widely opposed are the proposals severally advocated. 
The Position of the Public School 
While our problem has so far been treated as if the con- 
troversies lie only in the political and economic realms, a 
conclusion to this effect would be unauthorized. Religious 
controversies also have recently assumed a new dress and a 
new insistency. The general question of the’ proper uni- 
fication of the American people, the question of ‘‘assimila- 
tion” of the “‘hyphenate”’ has raised for education a most 
difficult and bitter controversy. Certain of the churches 
maintain parochial schools, and this they do partly because 
of well-established European practices, partly to insure the 
continued adherence of their natural population increase,
-P-A-G-E-87
  
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 71 
partly because of a very deeply rooted philosophic (religious) 
position. The effect of such schools, their opponents urge, 
is to hinder a proper unification within the body of American 
citizenship. The fact that some of these schools have been 
conducted in languages other than English aroused during 
war time a resentment that allying itself with other deep- 
seated feelings has maintained itself in perhaps increasing 
degree since. One result has been a movement to require 
all elementary school pupils to attend public schools; and 
one state (Oregon) has by legal enactment taken this stand. 
Involved in this, in greater or less opposition, are the deep- 
rooted ideas that the parents in the family have the inherent 
right to decide what shall be the education of the child, that 
the state must not interfere in religious matters, that the 
state must safeguard its own preservation and is the final 
agent of society to care for the rising generation. Surely a 
complicated problem. 
Education and ‘Indoctrination” 
Involved still further in the foregoing is the very funda- 
mental question as to whether in a democratic society any 
adults, whether major part or minor part, have the right of 
“indoctrination,” that is, of using educative processes with 
the as yet helpless young in such way as to fasten in them 
irrevocably (or practically so) beliefs on one side or the other 
in a controversial question. It would seem out of the 
question for a mind so warped to face adequately a changing 
world. To raise this question is to cut deep. Of existing 
institutions the deepest rooted perhaps of all, the family, is 
thus called to the bar to answer the charge of hindering 
efficiency, of obstructing ‘‘progress,”’ and of failing to respect 
the right of the child to become an independent thinking 
person. That the church and the state seem involved and 
often on opposite sides adds importance to the controversy.  
-P-A-G-E-88
  
72 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Few problems so typically illustrate the subject matter of the 
philosophy of education as it has here been defined. For 
while education must act, it apparently cannot so act as to 
meet all the contrary demands made simultaneously upon it. 
The pressing existence of just such a knotty problem as the 
foregoing requires that effort be made to lay bare the issues 
involved and if possible to find conceptions that promise help 
in the solution. We can see at once that the relation of the 
young and immature to society as a whole is involved, as 
also is the relation of such institutions as the family and 
church and state to each other and to the social whole. The 
philosophy of education will frankly go to ethics or to soci- 
ology or to political theory for any assistance they can render. 
What pertinent and useful conceptions these may have 
formulated are factors that must be taken into account. 
The fact that educational policies do actually affect life at all 
its many points means that a thoroughgoing philosophy of 
education must take account of whatever has been worked 
out in the many fields of human interest. As a practical 
discipline, one of its specific functions will be to build up in 
the future practitioner a useful stock of sensitivities to the 
more important aspects of life likely to be involved in the 
doubtful and difficult educational situations that lie ahead. 
National Self-Consciousness 
The demands of one further situation will probably suffice 
to marshal the major external influences that we should 
consider. When, in ancient days, Persia loomed threaten- 
ingly on the horizon, Athens began in self-defense to study 
her impending foe and by making contrasts became in turn 
most fruitfully conscious and critical of her own ways, not 
only in matters of war but eventually in almost every respect 
of life. So, in lesser fashion, it eventuated with the United 
States and the World War. Especially during the years  
-P-A-G-E-89
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 73 
when we were onlookers, we studied Prussia, her strengths 
and her weaknesses, as never before. The actual war itself 
and its disheartening aftermath, together with the final 
debacle of that old Prussia, have in a measure lessened inter- 
est in the comparison and study. But the relation of an 
educational system to its dominant social scheme was during 
this time added, in degree at least, to our list of permanent 
problems. How did the Prussian school system in its many 
details express the Prussian philosophy of life? And how 
did it, in actual practice, incarnate this philosophy in the 
Prussian youth? If the Prussian educational system could 
so well succeed in its aim, why should not ours? Questions 
of first importance thus arise which we must hold before 
ourselves till we more adequately solve them. What is 
America’s philosophy of life? Wherein can it be improved? 
In so far as we have an acceptable philosophy of life, is our 
school system consistently furthering it? Or does our philos- 
ophy point in one way and the features of our school system 
point varyingly in other directions? Thus there come to 
clearer consciousness two permanent problems in any phi- 
losophy of education: What philosophy of life should we 
hold and embody? What changes should be made in our 
school system that it may adequately and consistently em- 
body and express the philosophy we accept? The ramifica- 
tions of these two problems in the thought and the practical 
realms are as infinite as life itself. But consciously or not, 
adequately or not, each educator placed in any position of 
responsibility answers in his every act both questions. It 
is then not a problem of whether one shall or shall not have 
a philosophy of education, but solely and exactly of what kind 
of philosophy one shall have, whether each one of us is to 
absorb his philosophy unquestioningly by tradition from the 
prejudices of his chance associates, or whether under com- 
petent guidance he is to make a conscious and determined
-P-A-G-E-90
74 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
effort to build a philosophy that shall correlate his educa- 
tional activities with the best that has been thought by man. 
This completes our consideration of the demands made 
externally upon education. The list of these demands is 
perhaps not long, but the demands themselves are serious. 
Industrialism and immigration have made, it appears, at 
once the most far-reaching and the most pervasive demands. 
A correlative reorganization of school curriculum, school 
method, and school aims has in consequence been forced 
_ upon education. Economic stratification and a correlative 
social unrest, following largely in the wake of industrialism 
and immigration, have added most searching inquiries re- 
garding the institutions of general social life and the bases 
upon which they should be founded. The effect here has 
been still deeper questioning regarding school aims and the 
effects of school procedure. Additional to all the foregoing 
the World War came to accentuate many older problems and 
to add new ones. Among these, most significant perhaps of 
all, are those having to do with freedom, that is, the relations 
of the individual and of sub-groups with the rest of society. 
The necessary correlative of all these varied demands has 
been, as has appeared, on the one hand a reéxamination of 
the assumptions underlying our total educational effort and 
on the other a reconsideration of our total procedure. 
What should follow in the way of remaking aims, curriculum, 
and method we postpone until we have considered the 
demands upon education coming now rather from the in- 
side. 
Education as a subject of study is but part of a larger 
thought world ; and this thought world is constantly engaged 
in maintaining a satisfactory self-consistency as new elements 
are successively introduced. To understand our twenty-five 
year period and the thought movements in it, we must go 
much further back. Probably the most fundamental char-
-P-A-G-E-91
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 75 
acteristic of the modern world as distinguished from the 
ancient and medieval is the growth of a body of tested 
thought (or science) and its application to the affairs of men. 
Industrialism as earlier discussed is but one outgrowth of the 
applications of science. The influence of this tested thought 
within the thought realm itself has been no less great. 
Science and its processes now give us the norm and ideal of 
truth and its determination. © 
The Demand for a ‘‘ Practical”? Philosophy 
The reflex influence of tested thought as thus furnishing 
the norm and ideal of truth has been profound. Prior to 
this acceptance of science man’s powers were counted, in 
theory at least, to be wholly unreliable, needing to be 
amended and supplemented from without in order that man 
might know anything reliably. And this external supple- 
mentation only prepared him to receive what must still come 
to him from without. Man as man could not originate 
anything trustworthy. The day of thus despising man’s 
powers may to some seem too remote to bear on our story ; 
but thefact is that during our very period philosophic thought 
began to shape itself in a new sense and degree on this basis 
of science and faithinman. Perhaps in the movement called 
“Pragmatism” this tendency found its clearest expression. 
In this point of view truth is conceived as the quality we 
ascribe to an hypothesis which scientifically stands the test. 
Ideas as expressed.in terms are taken to mean only and 
exactly the consequences that flow from them when, as 
guides to conduct, they are put to work. Ideas are thus 
formulations coming from past experiences and existing to 
control future experiences. Experience becomes then the 
stuff of life and consequently the sole object of study, the 
guidance of which to more satisfactory levels sums man’s 
endeavor.
-P-A-G-E-92
  76 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Democracy and Progress 
Another characteristic of our times, caused in part by the 
growth of science, is what we may, for short, call ‘the 
democratic tendency.’’ Some of its demands on life have 
been indicated in the preceding part of this discussion. At 
this point, however, we are concerned with its thought 
correlative. Feudalism, or whatever we term the system in 
which men are by the’accidents of birth given prearranged 
places in society, through its long continuance shaped 
thought in conformity with itself. Thus Aristotle held that 
some men are by nature slaves; and the idea persists even 
to-day not in term but certainly in substance, so ingrained is 
feudalism in our social customs and thought habits. In like 
manner the still prevailing ideas of labor and leisure seem to 
find their origin and continued support in a scheme wherein 
labor is a burden engaged in only by those not fortunate 
enough to be able to avoid it. In other words, a stratified 
society with its lines of cleavage makes it easier for thought 
to entertain dualisms, and even demands such dualisms as 
the intellectual support of the existing stratification. In this 
way not only the opposed ideas of slave and freeman, work 
and leisure, but many other antitheses, as, culture and 
vocation, practical versus intellectual activities, pure versus 
applied sciences, man and nature, mind and body, have been 
introduced. It is at once clear that some of these are the 
immediate outgrowth of caste antitheses. It is less obvious, 
but probably no less true that even the more philosophic of 
these conceptions in fact originated under like conditions 
and were introduced, as intimated above, because they were 
needed for the defense of a stratified social system. 
As concerns the world of affairs, the democratic tendency 
has become manifest by the gradual dying away of the 
characteristics of feudalism. Many still remain, but many 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 77 
have gone. Old customs, however, die slowly. Indeed 
they often show surprising powers of resurrection as after 
a decline they find some new support. Thus we see new 
wealth reviving, in America, feudalistic practices that had 
supposedly died out in this democratic environment. Among 
the customs and habits that hold on after their reason for 
being has gone, some of the most tenacious are found in the 
thought realm, particularly as thought is embodied in pro- 
cesses and formulations for the school; for, hitherto at any 
rate, the school has admittedly dealt in matters that had no 
vital connection at the time of learning with the lives of those 
who learn them. Moreover too frequently in the past and 
even yet school people have been set apart from vital contacts 
with life. For this and other reasons the school has hitherto 
lacked the selective influence that would discriminate what 
was dead from what was alive. Democracy and feudalism 
have in fact clashed in their thought correlatives as truly as in 
outside matters. But the school has lagged behind the world 
of affairs in eliminating feudalistic remains. Both in its prac- 
tice and in its thought many such have remained intrenched. 
Professor John Dewey, America’s foremost student in this 
field, has felt more clearly than anyone else this conflict in 
the thought realm, and has given much of his effort on the 
one hand to hunting down and exposing these remains of 
feudalism and on the other to elaborating a democratic 
philosophy which should drive them out. It is not flattery 
but simple fact to recognize in him the outstanding figure in 
the development of the philosophy of education during the 
period under discussion. It is chiefly his position that is 
here developed. 
The Doctrine of Evolution and Philosophy 
When we seek formative influences on thought in the last 
half century, or, perhaps better, ask what sources have given 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  78 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
suggestion for needed new conceptions, by all odds the 
greatest influence and source is the doctrine of evolution first 
brought convincingly to the world’s attention by Charles 
Darwin. It seems not too much to say that the foremost 
task of thought during recent decades has been to elaborate 
the implication of this doctrine. Thus to the study of 
biology is the thought world indebted for two of its most 
influential conceptions. Aristotle introduced the one and 
Darwin the other. The development seen in the seed gave 
to Aristotle the conception of change which governed thought 
for two thousand years. This, however, was a limited 
change, hedged in, decently bounded. Moreover the goal 
was fixed in advance, so that “Reality” did not after all 
change. Now such a combination of limited change and 
fixed order is a very comforting line of thought to vested 
interests of every kind. We accordingly find that in the 
Middle Ages both feudalism and theology, if for the moment 
we may separate the two, cordially accepted Aristotelianism ; 
and on this basis the thought of the Western world by 
incessant argumentation made itself at length into thor- 
oughgoing consistency. 
Thus when Darwin startled the world by upholding the 
“origin of species,” the clamor and conflict that arose was, 
contrary to common opinion, not so much between science 
and theology as between two philosophies that differed in 
their views regarding the place of change in the world. If 
Aristotelian change returned always on itself and accordingly 
harmonized with a fixed order and conservatism, clearly 
Darwinian change must point to some other view of order. 
All the vested interests so far as they were consistently alert 
acted wisely to ask what sort of world this evolutionary 
hypothesis contemplated. Some at once began to say that 
what is e-volved must of course have been previously in- 
volved, so that after all nothing really new comes into 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 79 
existence. But the opposed idea of the intrinsically new, 
once it was disengaged and offered to the world, would not 
down. What does it lead to? 
One of the primary results of the study of evolution has 
been an insistence on continuous change as opposed to 
catastrophic leaps. Existing forms seem to have come into 
existence slowly, step by step. So that two existent forms 
now widely different may in fact trace their descent from one 
common ancestral stock. This would mean that these two 
“kinds’’ differ really in degree rather than in kind. Con- 
tinuity thus offers itself in place of antithesis as a way of 
conceiving the things of the world. Human physiology is 
thus understood in the light of comparative physiology. 
Human psychology is but the extreme in a continuous dis- 
tribution reaching from the lowest organism upward. In 
this conception, dualisms lose their hitherto firm support. 
' The fixed distinctions needed for feudalism are no longer so 
obvious or convincing. Democracy finds in evolution a 
thought-world ally. 
But Darwinian change interpreted in the sense of creative 
evolution reaches still further. When once we entertain the 
idea of movement without goals fixed in advance, we face 
what has been called, perhaps irreverently, a ‘‘universe with 
the lid off.””. Many will ask in bewilderment where then can 
they find support for cherished opinions; and they meet 
the answer that it is not the business of thought to find sup- 
port for ideas or positions or practices that ask to be accepted 
first and supported afterwards. Such “‘rationalization’’ is 
but the prostitution of thought. Thought is properly 
creative. Its business is to resolve for us the situations of 
difficulty that confront us and find solutions. True enough 
thought consolidates its positions creatively won, but in so 
doing it remains true to the scientific ideal. It holds every- 
thing tentative and subject to revision as further testing may
-P-A-G-E-96
80 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
demand. To the statement just made most perhaps will 
give assent. But when some begin to see that ethics, and 
the existing social and economic order, and existing govern- 
mental institutions and conceptions are to be included along 
with everything else in the scope of this tentative attitude, 
they falter. To such the foundation of the moral universe 
seems broken. They fear lest they be forced to yield what 
they now wish to believe. 
The New Philosophy of Experience 
The considerations thus reached carry us still farther. In 
the general idea of evolution and particularly in the evolution 
of human affairs we face a process tending not toward some 
externally fixed goal, but one guided and controlled from 
within the process. And here a new difficulty arises. On 
such a basis what can guidance mean? What does it mean, 
many will ask, to steer a course when there is no outward and © 
fixed goal toward which to steer it? That man is peculiarly 
adapted to control, they may willingly admit. That thought 
is the prime means of control, they may likewise admit. 
But how to determine direction whether good or bad with- 
out some fixed goal by which to measure, this they do not see. 
The answer indicated by the line of thought we have 
been pursuing is to look at the experience process itself — 
and from within. Are all experiences equally ‘‘good”? 
Common sense says, No, there is great diversity. Then let 
us begin, as science has always done, where practical common 
sense has brought us, and apply more thorough thought. 
The comparison and determination of goods leads by one 
path to what we call ethics, or perhaps by a small shift to 
democracy broadly considered. Yet another point of view 
here concerns us. 
When we compare experiences as to their effects on sub- 
sequent experiences, they obviously cover a wide range.
-P-A-G-E-97
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 81 
Some lead fruitfully to subsequent experiences that we call 
good, others lead as truly to subsequent experiences we call 
bad. Two conceptions here emerge, education and the 
valuation of experiences. Clearly, education is at least one 
important means through which one experience may in- 
fluence subsequent experiences; namely, by changing the 
agent himself. Now as to the valuation of experiences. 
Whatever else may be true, experiences differ in worth; so 
that the power to control the character of experience one is 
to have is at least an instrumental good. But meanings are 
the stuff of which control is compounded. Whatever other 
value any experience may have, it should have then this 
additional value that it yield meanings — meanings that 
show the relation of part to part within this experience, 
meanings that relate this experience to other experiences. 
Only on the basis of such meanings may control be exercised 
to raise the experience process to ‘‘higher”’ or “better ”’ or 
“richer” levels. All other ‘‘goods”’ in life are at least more 
efficiently and more consistently cared for by acquiring such 
meanings. But to get meanings is, in so far, to get education. 
So we may conclude that life is enhanced when experiences 
are educative. 
Common experience corroborates this judgment. We 
apply the depreciatory term ‘‘mere pleasures’ to those 
experiences which merely please and leave otherwise no good 
effect, and we say, also disparagingly, that one ‘‘indulges”’ 
himself who engages often in such. More generally we 
conclude that happiness is impossible on a basis of ‘‘mere 
pleasures,” because they do not sufficiently engage the active 
powers of the individual and they leave unsatisfied the deep- 
seated demand that one, upon consideration, finds one’s self 
to be progressing. Whatever else may be said about it then, 
the “good life” is one which engages meaningfully more and 
more of the individual’s powers, that is, the good life is
-P-A-G-E-98
82 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
essentially one of growing. Since the individual’s good is on 
the whole either self-contradictory or meaningless apart 
from the good of his fellows, we reach the conclusion that the 
good life will include such growing in each as contributes to 
the continued growing of all. 
The conception of evolutionary as opposed to Aristotelian 
change yields then the conclusion that education, which is of 
course one with growing, lies at the heart of the good life. 
Herein is the answer to the problem of steering the experience 
process from within. We should constantly seek to increase 
in the experience process the number and use of meanings 
and the sharing of interests. If these demands be met, we 
are living the good life so far as control can effect it. 
The implications of this conclusion are far-reaching. For 
one thing education becomes, in Professor Dewey’s phrase, 
life itself and no longer a mere preparation for life. Subject 
matter finds its rightful place in increasing here and now in 
and through each experience the number and use of meanings 
and the sharing of interests. What this further means in 
the reconstruction of curriculum and procedure is a tale too 
long to tell here. But seldom in the history of thought does 
a single conception demand more. 
Biological Psychology 
It was stated earlier in the chapter that Herbartianism, 
Hegelianism, and the old order conflicted at many points, 
and that in the clash progress was made. The bearings of 
evolution proved most important at this point. Out of the 
new study of biology a new psychology was born. The 
conception of behavior, of reaction to situation, gave an 
entirely new shift to the study of education. James and 
Dewey led. ‘‘Education is for behavior and habits are the 
stuff of which behavior consists.” This sentence from 
James’s Talks to Teachers indicates the new outlook. The
-P-A-G-E-99
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 83 
need for activity is henceforth on a new basis. Dewey’s 
How We Think gave classic expression to the functioning of 
thought in the educative experience process. The famous 
Chapter VI on the complete act of thought has given the 
problem an entirely new place in American conception. It 
is no exaggeration to say that biological psychology has 
remade our notion of the educative process and its function 
in the life process. 
Tests and Measurements 
We have now studied the more fundamental problems and 
answering conceptions that have characterized the develop- 
ment of the philosophy of education during the period under 
consideration. It may not be out of place to consider a few 
very recent developments. The most striking single move- 
ment in education of the present decade has been the devel- 
opment of more scientific tests and measurements. At first 
this brought few problems to the philosophy of education, 
but more recently two lines of questioning have been raised. 
The published results of the application of the Army Intelli- 
gence Tests to upwards of a million men during the World 
War have been interpreted by some to call in question the 
possibility of running society on a democratic basis. Em- 
phasis of this has raised the fear that intrenched privilege, 
availing itself of unwarranted deductions, might for a time 
at least successfully discredit democracy. As democracy is 
a perpetual experiment, it would be as unfortunate for any- 
thing to lessen interest in equality of opportunity for devel- 
opment as to lower faith in warranted endeavor. That 
theories of society and programs of action must of course 
square with the facts no true modern will deny. The 
philosophy of education must and will take its facts from 
whatever source they come, but it will insist first that re- 
ported facts be real facts and second that no narrow or hasty
-P-A-G-E-100
84 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
interpretation of the facts shall determine action. For the 
time, at any rate, we face in this a serious problem. 
The other difficulty raised by tests and measurements is 
more technical. As was inevitable, the measuring of 
achievement began with the matters that lent themselves 
best to measuring, which so far has generally meant the 
more mechanical of educational outcomes. As was further 
inevitable, these measures have been put to work in the 
service of accepted theories as to the educative process. 
The results along both lines have in many places been to 
hamper a broader and more human type of educative pro- 
cedure which had begun to grow up in answer to other lines 
of development as herein discussed. We find then a conflict 
between two aspects of education, that having to do with the 
aims and values and that having to do with means and 
achievement. Such a conflict according to our conception 
comes before the philosophy of education. The resolution of 
the difficulty seems to hang upon the problem of the nature 
and functioning of subject matter — at present one of the 
debatable issues. In the meanwhile, disheartening drill on 
what is needed for future use finds in the present application 
of the tests a frequent ally. 
The Individual and Society 
The bigness of organization in American education as in 
American life raises questions as to how the individual shall 
be related to the group. When any one person is set in 
authority over others, democratic considerations have to be 
taken into account. Particularly is this true when the work 
is, like education, of a kind that refuses to be mechanized. - 
And herein lies a most knotty problem. One set of con- 
siderations demand that the curriculum be made objectively 
by scientific experts, but othor considerations demand that 
it be made on the spot by teacher and pupils. How can the
-P-A-G-E-101
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 85 
latter be possible with so many incompetent teachers in the 
field? Again, democracy expects group decisions; how are 
such feasible under existing conditions? Are we not in 
danger of losing expert leadership? Still even in factories 
the output is influenced by the “human factor.’’ How shall 
the school system meet the questions so raised? Here 
again the philosophy of education finds an insistent problem. 
The Nation and Education 
A recent problem in American education connects itself 
most vitally with the historic American problem of ‘‘states’ 
rights.’”’ What shall be the attitude of the federal govern- 
ment towards the education of American children? Leave 
it to the states, in spite of the consequent gross inequity of 
opportunity? Or shall the federal government subsidize 
elementary and secondary education? And if so, what 
measure if any of control shall follow? How on any basis of 
subsidy can we avoid the blighting effects of a centralized 
bureaucracy? And consider the nature of the opposition 
to the movement. Does it arise from fear of centralization 
or of greater taxation or of a more efficient rival in the public 
schools? So complicated a question demands serious con- 
sideration ; but it will be hard to escape the conclusion that 
the wealth of all the people should underwrite the education 
of all the children. If the public school has logic to stand on, 
it leads straight to this conclusion. Support and control, 
however, stand on different bases and should accordingly be 
treated differently. Here a problem superficially adminis- 
trative involves philosophy before it can be settled. 
Thus ends the survey of the twenty-five years from 1898 
to 1923. The definition of the philosophy of education as 
given at the outset has been vindicated. The life of our 
people has in this period been seen to make from varying 
angles many opposed demands upon education. To act
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
at any time in the face of such demands and with due con- 
sideration of all the complex results has meant the kind of 
thought we have called philosophizing, and this has been 
true whether the needed deliberation has been made by 
philosopher or by administrator. The more immediate 
demands have often involved deeper demands. So that 
education has been called on to face problems that involved 
the bases of all associate life and action. The answers that 
have been made to these questions have naturally been 
various, but during the period under discussion there has 
been in this field an unmistakable trend. In this movement 
the most influential leaders have been William James and 
John Dewey — especially the latter — in the philosophy of 
education. 
Educational Sociology 
In keeping with this trend there came in the first half of 
our period, as has been discussed, a pronounced reaction 
against ‘“‘metaphysics.” One result of this was to lead Pro- 
fessor (now President) Henry Suzzallo in 1909 to propose, in 
effect, to abandon the name “ Philosophy of Education” and 
substitute instead that of ‘Educational Sociology.” To 
many this has seemed a happy suggestion, and not a little has 
been done under this title both in the way of publishing books 
and of conducting courses. A dispute about terms easily 
becomes the most futile of discussions. In this instance it 
seems to the present writer that educational sociology may 
well be admitted to have an entirely proper place as an effort 
to discuss and determine scientifically certain sociological 
questions that present themselves to education. But it 
seems equally clear to the writer that as educators we shall 
still need and shall always need to face conflicting demands 
made on education from various angles; and accordingly in 
the sense herein discussed there must always be the philo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 87 
sophic approach to many insistent problems. What choice 
then between the terms? Since thinking of the higher kind 
will go on according to the taste and ability of the thinker, 
the question of any bearing on productive thought is prob- 
ably not involved. The practical problem would seem to be 
that of courses for students. For the less advanced students, 
quite possibly neither term will be used. For more advanced 
students, some schools will offer a choice between both kinds 
of courses, others will offer only one line emphasizing the 
material treated according to the taste and inclination of 
the best available instructor. Whatever else may be said, 
it will hardly be denied that the actual philosophy of 
education of the practical schoolman is a matter of fun- 
damental importance. In the making of this, no conscien- 
tious instructor will willingly exclude any helpful point of 
view. 
The Resulting Philosophy of Education 
The philosophy of education as actually formulated has 
greatly emphasized democracy. This has been the con- 
ception most obviously involved in the many demands that 
have confronted education. The effort to understand 
democracy, to make the conception consistent amid all the 
varying demands of modern life, and to apply the conception 
consistently in education — these almost sum the major 
problems that have presented themselves during the twenty- 
five years under consideration. For furthering the solution 
side of the work, the doctrine of evolution and the conception 
of experience have proved most fruitful. From these have 
grown a biological and instrumental psychology and accom- 
panying new conceptions of human nature, of thought, and of 
value. Out of it all, has come the conception of growth as 
perhaps the most inclusive single formula for directing edu- 
cation.
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
This conception of growth is at once so difficult and so 
important as to demand a few words of special consideration. 
It will perhaps help us to think of this growth as life based 
especially on the continual increase of meanings in experience 
and on the continually increased sharing of interests. Im- 
agine any group of people with its present wants (interests) 
and its present means of gratifying them. If each new 
experience is so lived as to bring with it the practical increase 
of meanings and to lead as much as is feasibly possible to 
continually wider and varied sharing of interests with others, 
life it appears is then enhanced for all concerned and in all 
feasible directions. But this practical increase of meanings 
and shared interests is exactly education in both its intel- 
lectual and its moral aspects and these of a kind to include 
the whole of life. So education is at once life and the means 
to richer life. In paradoxical brevity education has thus no 
aim beyond itself, that is, beyond more of the like thing. 
Democracy then becomes the kind of society that most 
encourages this kind of growing. The fixed distinctions of 
feudalism, ancient or modern, have no abiding place in this 
conception. But the consistent application of the concep- 
tions of democracy and growth to education involves more 
reconstruction than has thus far been realized. Such a 
democracy should make its school system a conscious agency 
of progress, in particular trying to set its rising generation 
free from the hampering prejudices which the old have 
accumulated. Curriculum and method, as is indicated below, 
get in this a new spirit. Equally will democracy strive for 
all its members, whether rich or poor, urban or rural, old 
stock or new, and wherever found in our country. The talk 
that too many are being educated must die as a kind of 
blasphemy. The spirit of democracy must more fully 
pervade the school system itself. Expert knowledge will be 
sought and utilized, not, however, in superintendent or super-
-P-A-G-E-105
TENDENCIES IN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 89 
visor only, but as far as feasible throughout. In every 
relationship will each person’s growth and the sharing of 
interests and responsibility be positive ends. Among the 
children individual differences will be studied in order that 
fullest correlative opportunity may be accorded to each. 
Here again do democracy and growth make demands both 
on curriculum and method. 
The curriculum must be richer and better adapted to the 
life of the present and future. On no other basis can all the 
manifold complex demands passed in review be met. No 
reactionary prating about ‘‘fads and frills” or ‘‘burden of 
taxes”” must be allowed to stay the process. Again, since 
the demands are very numerous, time cannot be given to the 
relatively less significant. Everything must count. 
But here other considerations enter. Best teaching and 
best learning demand that teacher and pupil have a vital part 
in making the curriculum. It is exceedingly doubtful that 
any precisely prepared curriculum made and imposed by 
authority can adequately educate. For education, being 
life, is a process of growth for both teacher and child, and in 
this growth all the aspects of life must enter. Steering such 
a process means, as we saw, to increase with experience the 
meanings of the world about us and to give to life an in- 
creasing social content. Increasingly also must the child 
take over his own steering. In these respects is experience 
to be continuously remade. By our newer psychology these 
things are possible only as the child exercises with satisfaction 
what is to be built into his character. Purposeful activity in 
a social situation and under wise guidance seems best to 
promise the accomplishment of these ends. 
So we come to method. For method has now a much 
richer meaning than how best to make a child learn specific 
subject matter chosen in advance. Method, the teacher’s 
method, is primarily a question of how to stimulate and guide  
-P-A-G-E-106
  
90 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the child so that he shall best call forth and exercise all his 
possibilities. This conception fits with the demands of 
democracy and growth. For democracy to succeed in the 
ever growing complexity of modern life, our children must 
be able and disposed to adapt themselves unselfishly to a 
situation ever shifting in unexpected ways. It is then 
methods of attack rather than specific solutions to life’s 
problems that we must teach. That our children shall think 
rather than what they shall think must be our first concern. 
This is not to deny that some solutions will persist.. Some 
will persist and these we shall teach, but always with care so 
as not to hamper our children by our prejudices. A chief 
concern must be the social attitudes that underlie any suc- 
cessful social life. These must in the main come inherently 
in the living. It will be accordingly necessary to give up our 
factory-like discipline and provide a school life richer in 
social opportunities. Again does our psychology tell us that 
only as we practice may we hope to grow. With method 
then as with curriculum and administration and architecture 
and all the rest, each item of procedure must be the cor- 
relative of the democratic theory of life consistently applied. 
This is the last word of the present-day philosophy of edu- 
cation.

DEVELOPMENT OF EpucaTIONAL PsycHOLOGY 
Psychology and Philosophy 
The formation, in 1895, of the National Herbart Society 
for the Scientific Study of Education marks an important 
date in the development of educational theory in general, 
and educational psychology in particular. For the papers, 
the debates, and the general principles which were formu- 
lated in the early days of this body, before it became, more 
simply, the National Society for the Scientific Study of Edu- 
cation, have ever since influenced the course of evolution 
of educational thought and practice in this country. The 
five Yearbooks with supplements, largely on purely Herbar- 
tian themes, are still full of live issues; the authors, almost 
without exception, became and still are leaders in the edu- 
cational world; the papers, themselves, reflect a sincerity 
and an earnestness as well as a willingness to see broadly 
that is still an inspiration. That these early speculations 
are abstract, is true; that they are metaphysical, at times 
even to absurdity, is also true; but that they yielded a rich 
product of more concrete material is shown by the almost 
abrupt way in which the Yearbooks, under the new name 
which the society took at the end of its fifth year, begin to 
talk about such things as teaching, the progress of geography, 
courses of study, the relation of theory to practice, the edu- 
cation of teachers, vocational subjects, and soon. The haste 
with which such general and philosophical topics as con- 
centration, isolation, and unification, the doctrine of interest, 
and the social aspects of moral education are dropped for 
93

  94 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
more concrete and pragmatic interests and researches is 
almost startling. Not until many years have passed do 
we again find general discussions comparable to the early 
ones. 
It is difficult, even theoretically, to separate the psychology 
of education from the philosophy of education; particu- 
larly is this true of the early debates of the Herbart Society. 
Indeed, it does not clearly appear that all those who took 
part in these early debates were sure of the nature and the 
field of psychology. To quote one remark, “‘One’s meta- 
physics forms a basis for his psychology.” But as we read 
on it becomes apparent that two trends of thought, two 
different crystallizations of experience are being formulated : 
one more concrete, based on experience in the sense of science 
in general, looking for facts first and theories only as a legit- 
imate generalization from them; the other more mystical, 
more moral in the popular sense of that term, more deductive 
than inductive, not particularly keen about concrete obser- 
vation, prone to argue about technicalities, and inclined to 
worry about words. The former might be personified in 
such people, say, as James, Dewey, and Thorndike; the 
latter, more truly Herbartian, in De Garmo, Harris, Van 
Liew, Parker, and perhaps Hall. That the first stream of 
thought is not entirely an inner product of the Society is 
true; James is an intrusion from without; but as one reads 
even Dewey’s first paper, in the First Yearbook (1895), one 
is struck by its outstanding modernness, its concreteness, as 
contrasted with some of the other less tangible, less prac- 
tical speculations. 
That educational practice was going on all the while is, 
obviously, a fact to be reckoned with. Indeed, one may 
think of the history of educational psychology for the past 
quarter of a century as the gradual modification of highly 
metaphysical doctrines by the insistently intruding and 
 
-P-A-G-E-111

unanswerable facts of classroom experience, plus, finally 
and characteristically modern, a new attempt at generali- 
zations and ultimate theories. Thus, for example, the doc- 
trine of general discipline, a favorite with the Herbartians, 
has arisen again with us, changed by the knowledge of new 
facts, but much the same in its hopes and promises. In- 
terest, apperception, unity, continuity, will, character — 
in all these we are still interested, though sometimes under 
new names, and always with a new approach and a better 
knowledge of the actual psychology involved. Again, the 
present discussion of instincts, in so far as there is any at- 
tempt to read into them anything more than an unlearned 
mode of response to a stimulus, recalls the earlier discus- 
sions on the Herbartian soul. 
Herbartian Psychology 
Our first need, then, will be to outline roughly the nature 
of the psychology prevalent in the early nineties. First of all, 
the general, ‘‘popular” psychology, used more or less un- 
critically in the schools, was committed to a “faculty” type 
of mind—an aggregation of different, separate, infusible 
“powers.”’ Courses of study were more or less definitely de- 
signed to affect and mature these separate abilities ; the senses 
were trained, the memory strengthened, the reason disciplined, 
and so on; and since these things could be done as well, appar- 
ently, by one subject as another, a considerable debate waged 
about the relative appropriateness of competing subjects for 
the curriculum. That this was not Herbartian is quite evi- 
dent ; indeed one function of the Herbartian psychology was 
to install another concept of the mind in the educators of the 
period. To Herbart, psychology is based on three different 
but interrelated foundations — metaphysics, mathematics, 
and experience. It is interesting to realize that, however 
much we may disagree with the concrete results of such a plat-
-P-A-G-E-112
  96 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
form, in the long run his psychology was productive of rich 
fruit. One may trace the mathematical suggestions through 
the German experimentalists down to present-day tests and 
measurements, with Thorndike, of course, as the mediating 
link between purely laboratory studies and their concrete 
application in the schoolroom. Likewise, one may trace 
the metaphysical strain through successive forms and find 
emerging, with James and again Thorndike, the concept of 
original nature. The experience side becomes more and more 
exact and concrete, the technique of scientific procedure 
entering more and more into the analysis of child life until 
there emerges, finally, such a generalization as, say, the laws 
of learning, as stated in present-day terminology. 
Of Herbart’s metaphysical foundations we need say little. 
To him the concept “‘soul’’ represented a necessary presup- 
position for any dealings with human nature. He arrived 
at this concept by the elaboration, in thought, of the facts 
of experience in such way as to remove all logical contradic- 
tions. Any assumption necessary in order to bring harmony 
into this thought process was apparently permitted. Thus, 
the soul is real, isa monad, is simple, and has only ideas as its 
one form of activity, directed universally toward self-preser- 
vation. Thus there are certainly no faculties. Though we 
may not care to use any longer either this metaphysical 
method, nor yet accept his presuppositions or conclusions, 
still the idea of unity was of untold value for the period. It 
turned attention in a new direction; one, moreover, destined 
to be more fruitful, for in spite of its a priori origin it was 
still an honest attempt to gather from experience some of the 
facts necessary as the basis for an educational psychology. 
In his mathematics, as we have seen, Herbart finds another 
basis. Ideas, he teaches, are passive in their primary state ; 
but through relation to one another they become forces. 
Ideas are thus a system of mental stresses and strains, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 97 
statics and dynamics of which may be theoretically and per- 
haps actually calculated quantitatively, thus establishing a 
determinism in the psychological field. That his particular 
mathematics were, at times, fanciful is doubtless true; but the 
conception has led, when freed of the underlying somewhat 
mystical implications, to some of the most important develop- 
ments of the modern period. 
The third basis, experience, proved more immediately 
fruitful. He applied the general term ‘‘apperception”’ to 
that assimilative function or ability of the soul or mind 
whereby it sees or understands all that it does experience 
in terms of prior experience. As we have seen, to Herbart 
the one original tendency of the soul is to preserve itself ; 
beyond this there is nothing said about original nature in the 
present sense of that term. Or, putting it differently, the 
individual grows and matures through the acquisition of 
an ideational content, assimilated through a constantly more 
richly apperceived experience, instead of through the matur- 
ing development and modification of a complex set of ca- 
pacities, abilities, and tendencies to respond to situations. 
There is little or no idea, in Herbart’s psychology, of corre- 
lated structure and function; there are no laws of learning 
in the sense of generalizations arrived at through concrete 
experiment and observation. From this point of view, Her- 
bart’s psychology is not a psychology of experience at all; he 
really uses the word in a secondary sense, meaning that ex- 
perience is the medium of learning, not the medium of our 
knowledge of learning. 
It is interesting to note how Kant and Herbart differ in 
respect to this. Kant was particularly interested in the 
constitutive abilities and characteristics of mind, prior to 
and independent of all experience ; Herbart, in what happens 
to the mind because of its nature when deluged with ideas. 
Apperception with Kant meant an original synthesizing  
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
power of the mind; with Herbart it meant the interpreta- 
tion of ideas:in accordance with ideas received earlier. To 
be sure, each solution has its own peculiar difficulties. Of 
Kant one may ask, How may a mind function with nothing 
to function on? Of Herbart we may ask, How, then, was the 
first idea apperceived? That all this is metaphysical and 
speculative and quite without practical interest at the present 
moment, is true; the pertinent point is that we have solved 
the problem by a radically different approach from that of 
either Kant or Herbart and with a radically different concep- 
tion of the whole nature of the human mind and body. 
This doctrine of apperception leads, of course, to many 
concrete classroom rules and principles of procedure, some 
of which we will examine later; for method, as a reflection 
of educational psychology as such, is as inextricably bound 
up with the history of the latter as is the philosophy of edu- 
cation. But there are yet several general and theoretical 
considerations that deserve attention. First of all, while 
Herbart’s psychology insists on the unity of the mind, it also 
insists equally strongly that it is essentially or preponderantly 
intellectual, a nexus of ideas, or, at anyrate, a system in which 
ideas are of primary importance. Feeling, for example, is 
thought of as due to a relationship pertaining between ideas. 
As Lindner puts it: ‘A feeling is the consciousness of a fur- 
thering or an arrest of the movement of thought; when a 
furthering, a feeling of pleasure; when an arrest, a feeling of 
pain. The life of the soul is one of ideas; every furthering 
of them is at the same time a promotion of the life activity 
of the mind; every arrest of ideas is also an arrest of soul 
life.” This may, to be sure, be translated into more modern 
terms, but in doing so it loses the predominant intellectual 
coloring. Thorndike’s concept of “satisfying” and ‘“un- 
satisfying” is related, but neither speculative nor idea- 
tional.
-P-A-G-E-115
    DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 99 
Again, “‘Desire is in general a state of mind which strives 
to bring about some other state of mind not now present.” 
Compared with the idea of ‘‘readiness” this is very deficient 
in both clarity and practical application. Still further, “An 
object of desire is attainable when it appears as the final mem- 
ber of a series of changes which are related as cause and 
effect, the first member of the series proceeding from the ego 
that wills. If such a causal series comes to the support of any 
desire, the desireis transformed into will ; the object is not only 
desired, it is willed. Will, then, means the desire for a cer- 
tain result and certainty, or at least a belief in the certainty, 
of its attainment.”’ Thus, will, desire, and feeling are 
thought of as reflections of the nature and relationships of 
ideas. Ideas, content, information, provided that they be 
properly apperceived, make for will, character, attainment. 
That the ideo-motor theory is naturally derived from such 
a metaphysical situation is apparent; such definitions of 
will and feeling require that acts necessarily follow thoughts 
of them. Even if concrete motor experience and learning 
should appear theoretically necessary, concrete practice did 
expect from such presuppositions that proficiency in act 
would follow on harmony and the proper content of thought. 
Transitional Period 
It must not, however, be thought that there was anything 
like universal agreement with either the metaphysical as- 
sumptions and generalizations of Herbart’s psychology or 
its concrete application to classroom practice. An inter- 
esting occasion of expression of growing doubts in both di- 
rections is found in the paper by Frick and Friedel in the 
supplement to the Third Yearbook (1897), and in the dis- 
cussion of that paper as contained in the report of the dis- 
cussions at Chattanooga, February, 1898. Some extracts 
from the authors’ own summary of their paper will indicate 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  100 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the direction of change. ‘‘Herbart’s theory of the soul is re- 
jected. . . . Knowledge exercises, indeed, a strong influence 
upon the will, but it should not be regarded as the essential 
source of will.” These quotations indicate the growing 
tendency to doubt the current conception of original nature 
as well as that of a specifically intellectual will; both are, 
in time, to be replaced with more substantial ideas. The 
soul becomes a group of endowments, the will something 
connected with habits, motor and otherwise. But the ideo- 
motor theory was, even here, subjected to criticism. ‘Not 
knowledge, but interest is the purpose and aim of all instruc- 
tion.” It must be noticed that interest, in this connection, 
is something resulting from instruction, not something, as 
in the modern sense of the word, leading to learning. The 
authors indeed remark, “interest is commonly turned about 
and falsely regarded as a means and a condition for instruc- 
tion.” . . . “Ordinarily,” says Herbart, ‘‘teachers try to in- 
terest pupils so that they may learn. Pedagogically correct 
is the opposite. They should learn so as to establish an 
interest for later times.” To connect this idea of interest 
with will, we note, ‘‘Such an interest leads to the threshold 
of will. Interest is that condition out of which will grows. 
Interest builds everywhere the necessary transition to will.” 
In the discussion at Chattanooga, however, there was 
even more of interest to us, as showing the gradual evolu- 
tion of educational psychology, than the above slight modi- 
fications of Frick and Friedel. Dean Russell, of Teachers 
College, remarks that ‘‘we must believe that whatever is 
true in primary instruction will be true in secondary instruc- 
tion.” While this is primarily a remark on method, it shows 
also the conscious realization that an educational psychology, 
if valid at all, will be universal and applicable to all stages 
of learning. L. H. Galbreath, of the School of Pedagogy 
of the University of Buffalo, in commenting on the psychol-
-P-A-G-E-117
    DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 101 
ogy and pedagogy of the report, remarked . . . ‘‘this paper 
states that pedagogy is based upon psychology. ... It is 
not true as a matter of fact, it is not true as a matter of 
theory.” This is comment on the original statement to 
the effect that while it is doubtful if any then existing psy- 
chology could be made the basis for pedagogy, still Herbart’s 
system would be ‘‘least objectionable’; indeed, many of 
his propositions (pedagogical) might well be adopted by 
psychologists of a rival school. This is, truly, light on the 
state of the subject some twenty-five years ago. W. T. 
Harris, United States Commissioner of Education, remarked, 
“(it) is my suspicion that there is not a good psychology 
or ontology underlying Herbartianism. .. .”’ Later on he 
apparently involves himself in an impasse when he defends 
free will and yet holds to the formative powers of schooling 
and education. The discussion then wanders off on this 
point, both Charles McMurry and Frank McMurry answer- 
ing Dr. Harris. All this, quite evidently, shows the almost 
entire absence of a psychology of such nature that there 
was no difference on fundamentals. Here are not minor 
shades of opinion regarding some phase of the subject, but 
almost diametrically opposed points of view. That this is 
always the necessary result of speculation may be true; but 
it is noteworthy, as we have said, that many of the specu- 
lative visions, when changed a bit by time and new evidence, 
yielded solid and more practical results. 
Froebelianism 
The Herbartian movement, as we have seen, was both 
philosophical and, by implication, psychological. It led 
both to immediate methodological classroom results, as well 
as speculations that later, with the addition of a more scien- 
tific approach and more concrete evidence, crystallized in 
the form of present-day educational psychology. Froe-
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
belianism, on the other hand, while it was in part respon- 
sible for an increased interest in child nature as such, as 
contrasted with the earlier too great emphasis on the teaching 
process, was too closely associated, at least in its early adop- 
tion in this country, with kindergarten situations to create 
as much interest and discussion among those associated 
with Herbart’s teachings. When need and time had directed 
the attention of investigators to a new scrutiny of human 
nature, the solution was a result more of an entirely new 
attitude and approach than of Froebelian principles, though 
they have much in common at bottom. With Froebel, as 
with Herbart, it is difficult to separate philosophy from 
psychology. In addition, in the case of Froebel, the nature 
and career of specifically native elements is more difficult 
to trace because of the very general nature of his educa- 
tional system as well as its modification by other and later 
developments. Froebel exerts his influence rather through 
his disciples than through his unmodified system. To some 
of these streams of thought, in part inspired by Froebel, 
in part independent, and in part implied by Herbart’s sys- 
tem, we will now turn our attention. 
G. Stanley Hall 
With the name of G. Stanley Hall is associated a type of 
approach and a wealth of material that have meant and still 
mean much for educational psychology. Often colored 
by metaphysical attitudes, often too Herbartian in assump- 
tions and intellectualization, Hall’s concrete work has never- 
theless yielded a rich return in knowledge of children’s 
habits, feelings, hobbies, games, and, in general, their 
evolution into mature individuals from their relatively in- 
coherent beginnings of original nature. His studies, ex- 
tending over twenty years, and supplemented by those of 
his students, and conducted in part through the dubious

method of questionnaires, have afforded both tentative con- 
clusions and new points of departure for more adequate 
results. The major interest, at least in the mind of Hall 
himself, has undoubtedly been that which interested both 
Herbart and James — what, namely, is the original nature, 
what are the unlearned abilities, of the child? Unfortu- 
nately, direct observation and experiment were not always 
the basis of evidence; opinion, hearsay, introspection, and 
memory often too brightly color the reports. Further, the 
fields covered often represented a selected group of children ; 
moreover, the topics investigated often proved too complex 
— division was needed. In particular, as Thorndike later 
showed, Hall’s interpretation of the meaning of the order 
and dates of original tendencies, as well as his application 
of that doctrine to teaching and to the hygiene of childhood 
and adolescence, is based rather on speculation than fact. 
The Culture Epoch Theory, a typical Herbartian product, 
falls before the later more objective investigations. All 
this in no carping spirit ; the genius, the industry, the stimu- 
lation of the man are factors of incalculable power in the 
development of our subject ; but it is undeniable that many 
of his conclusions, as well as much of his method, have had 
to give way before the newer approach. Yet, at bottom, 
all Hall’s studies are inspired by the evolutionary point of 
view, and are, in spirit at least, genetic. His studies, how- 
ever much biased by presuppositions, are still real ‘‘child- 
studies,’’ developing as time goes on into more and more 
objective problems. In particular, Hall’s studies in adoles- 
cence deserve appreciation; they opened up a new field, 
and emphasized a new aspect of human life. Thus, as with 
Herbart, Hall lives and moves in those he has inspired and 
trained; much of his actual work requires amending; his 
interests and his problems were carried over into the latter 
developments.

104 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
William James 
In the writings of William James we find a distinctly new 
approach to the problems of educational psychology; an 
approach that later, in the hands of Thorndike, is to yield 
the specifically modern point of view. The publication, 
in 1890, of the Principles of Psychology, as well as the series 
of lectures given in 1891, entitled Talks on Psychology of 
Interest to Teachers, mark the beginning of an earnest and 
direct and scientific attack on the scholastic psychology 
of the period we have been discussing. The contribution 
of even the Principles is as great in the field of education 
as in the larger field of psychology in general. Instead of 
“faculties,” a mysterious soul or will, interest of dubious 
meaning, there is an objective discussion of such things as 
instinct and its pedagogical significance, play, habit, methods 
of arousing interest, the significance of imitation and sug- 
gestion, a careful treatment of the problem of discipline 
and the transfer of training, the meaning of marks, indi- 
vidual differences, and a host of other things that bear all 
the hall-marks of a modern point of view. In the intro- 
duction to the published version of the Talks to Teachers 
(1899) James claims that knowledge of psychology will aid 
the teacher by narrowing the paths of experiment and trial, 
by making clear what the teacher is trying to do, by re- 
animating interest through a knowledge of how children 
learn. This is the objective point of view; but in another 
respect, also, James is in advance of the older speculative 
schools, — he sought no closed system, — the facts not the 
theories were to him always of primary importance. In 
James, the biological, not the metaphysical, is the basis ; 
intelligence is not a “‘thing-in-itself,’’ but a tool for use in 
adaptation ; instincts, which he was one of the first to mention 
in connection with education, are of primary importance ;  
-P-A-G-E-121
    DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 105 
the organism always reacts, is never passive; experiments, 
rather than a priori reasoning, must settle the question of 
transfer of training; the emotions are of vast importance, 
but far from being intellectual matters, are at bottom vis- 
ceral and biological disturbances; he criticized Herbartian 
concepts, in particular, apperception; everywhere he em- 
phasized the importance of studying the actual responses 
of the child. 
Edward L. Thorndike 
It is, however, in the work of Thorndike that educational 
psychology first takes form as a consistent and relatively 
well-rounded body of knowledge, based on experiment and 
observation, and having always as its final basis of refer- 
ence the actual behavior of a human being undergoing the 
stimulus of a definite situation. Deriving, in part from 
James and the point of view of the Principles, and in part 
inspired by the personality of one of the great translators 
of Herbartian principles into classroom technique — Hall — 
yet differing from the latter’s actual doctrines, Thorndike’s 
is, in every sense, the outstanding name in modern educa- 
tional psychology. His concept of “original nature,” 
though not unique, was given more richness and accuracy of 
meaning through his researches; the laws of learning, as 
derived from a concrete study of ‘‘how animals do learn,”’ 
are in every sense as fundamental to a satisfactory technique 
of teaching as the laws of motion to the science of physics; 
his approach to the study of individual differences has re- 
sulted in innumerable concrete changes both in theory and 
practice. The total product is the result of science, in the 
exact sense of that word, applied to the tremendously com- 
plicated mass of details of human nature. In Thorndike’s 
psychology Herbart’s threefold foundation takes on flesh 
and lives; the mathematical elements lead ultimately to 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  
106 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the measurement of abilities, differences, rates, and stand- 
ards; the assimilative character of the soul becomes trans- 
lated into sensitivity of the nervous system; the soul 
itself becomes a group of native traits and characters. 
Begun in 1903, and completed in 1913, the three volumes 
of Educational Psychology brought together a ‘‘systematic 
account of present knowledge of human nature and behavior. 
These volumes represent a selection from, and organi- 
zation of, recent work in experimental, statistical, and com- 
parative psychology. . . .”’ A somewhat detailed summary 
of the main points of these volumes will be necessary in 
order to do full justice to the significance of the new point of 
view. To repeat, the absence of purely or even relatively 
speculative premises and conclusions is conspicuous; the 
almost universal effort to show useful applications of each 
generalization about human nature makes the book not only 
a collection of principles but also a handbook of practice. 
Some extracts from his essay in the first volume of The Jour- 
nal of Educational Psychology (1910), entitled ‘The Contribu- 
tions of Psychology to Education,”’ will bear out this statement. 
Psychology is the science of the intellects, characters, and behavior 
of animals, including man. . . . Psychology makes ideas of educational 
aims clearer. Psychology helps to measure the probability that an aim 
is attainable. Psychology enlarges and refines the aim of education. 
Psychology contributes to understanding of the means of education. . . . 
Psychology contributes to knowledge of the methods of teaching 
The modification of instincts and capacities into habits and powers . 
are the subjects of research. False infant psychology or false child 
psychology is harmful, not because it is infant psychology, but because it 
is false. Schoolroom life is a vast laboratory... .    
Nothing could be less Herbartian in method and approach 
than this. 
The three volumes of the Hducational Psychology are the 
expansion and the justification of the above more general 
statements. Volume I, with the subtitle The Original 
Nature of Man, collects and discusses that group of ‘nu-
-P-A-G-E-123
  
  DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 107 
merous well-defined tendencies to future behavior. Be- 
tween the situations which he will meet and the responses 
which he will make to them, pre-formed bonds exist. His 
intellect and his morals, as well as his bodily organs and 
movements, are in part the consequences of the nature of 
the embryo in the first moment of its life. What a man is 
and does throughout life is a result of whatever constitution 
he has at the start and of all the forces that act upon it be- 
fore and after birth. I shall use the term ‘original nature’ 
for the former and ‘environment’ for the latter.” This is, 
of course, frankly biological and as frankly ‘‘materialistic”’ 
in the scientific (not philosophical) sense of that term, and 
dismisses at once, as incompatible with rigorous procedure, 
any speculative apriori concepts. Psychology has become 
an inductive study; education is.a process of action and 
reaction between man and nature, ‘‘original nature” 
and “environment.” Still further : 
A man’s nature and the changes that take place in it may be described 
in terms of the responses — of thought, feeling, action, and attitude — 
which he makes, and of the bonds by which these are connected with the 
situations which life offers. Any fact of intellect, character, or skill means 
a tendency to respond in a certain way to a certain situation — involves 
a situation or state of affairs influencing the man, a response or state of af- 
fairs in the man, and a connection or bond whereby the latter is the result 
of the former. 
From this point of view, it becomes apparent what is the 
purpose or aim of education in terms of educational psychol- 
ogy; naturally, social and philosophical considerations, 
such as the fabric of the social life, institutional powers, 
economic conditions, and so on, also determine the direction 
and goal of the educational process. But whatever modifi- 
cation of the curriculum, whatever determination of hours 
and place of school, and so on, such latter considerations 
involve, still, in an irrevocable sense, and having in mind 
the nature of the human nature described above, educational
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
psychology aims to ‘‘perpetuate some of them (tendencies), 
eliminate some, and to modify or redirect others.’ This 
is the first adequately supported system of psychology in 
which it is shown to be necessary to think of the ends of 
education in terms of the beginnings of that which is being 
educated. There is neither a ‘blank mind”’ on which edu- 
cation can write anything that philosophy dictates, nor yet 
is there a ‘“‘free nature’’ (will) which, because of some tran- 
scendental element, not observable to sense, will inevitably 
choose the right, the good, the true, the beautiful. The ends 
of education are circumscribed to begin with. Philosophy 
is still powerful, but it must come to terms with psychology ; 
philosophy may still choose, but it must choose within the 
definite limits of original nature. And original nature is 
limited not only in the general sense, but in each particular 
instance also; for all individuals differ to some ascertain- 
able extent. To quote still further, the task and province 
of educational psychology is ‘1. The description and classi- 
fication of original tendencies; 2. their anatomy and phy- 
siology; 3. their source or origin; 4. the order and dates 
of their appearance and disappearance; and, 5. their con- 
trol in the service of human ideals.” 
Volume II, with the subtitle The Psychology of the Laws 
of Learning, is, like its predecessor, as complete a divergence 
from accepted and theoretical attitudes and beliefs as it 
is possible to conceive. Quite as frankly biological, quite 
as openly and consistently objective and experimental, it 
offers a body of doctrine and practice that again contradicts, 
irrevocably, the insinuations of a metaphysics of learning. 
Such terms as interest, apperception, learning, habit, im- 
provement, ability, rate, durability, and so on receive ade- 
quate definition. The discussion is, consistently, joined 
on to that of original nature. To quote: ‘These original 
human tendencies include also certain ones whereby modi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 109 
fiability or learning itself is possible.’ That is, learning 
is not independent of structure but a function of it. Learn- 
ing is as natural a function as is the expression of original 
nature before learning or modification takes place. To 
act is to become modified; all activity is learning. Nor 
are the laws of learning applicable merely to human nature ; 
all animals learn in the same way. 
The laws of learning — Readiness, Exercise (7.e. Use and 
Disuse), and Effect — are intimately connected with that 
conception of “satisfying” and “annoying” which is the 
result of an investigation of the life processes of the neurons 
of the nervous system. ‘By an ‘annoying’ state of affairs 
is meant roughly one which the animal avoids or changes. 
By a ‘satisfying’ state of affairs is meant roughly one which 
the animal does nothing to avoid... .” Ultimately, such 
satisfaction and annoyance are properties of the constituent 
elements of the nervous system, considered from the point 
of view that ‘‘in my opinion they retain the modes of be- 
havior common to unicellular animals so far as is consistent 
with the special conditions of their life as elements in man’s 
nervous system.” This is an interesting contrast with the 
Herbartian concept of learning and the ideas of “self-preser- 
vation’? of the soul and the “furtherance and arrest of 
thought.’ To quote again, 
Capacity to learn and remember could find its physiological basis in 
the movement-process of neurons. The acquired connections of man’s 
intellect and character would be the results of the unlearned tendencies 
of his neurons to do nothing different when all was well with them and to 
perform whatever different acts were in their repertories when their life 
processes were disturbed. The learning of an animal would be the un- 
learned response of its neurons. 
Certain pseudo-scientific concepts of the learning process 
are disposed of; ‘‘the laws of readiness, exercise, and effect, 
uncomplicated by any pseudo-aid from imitation, ideo-motor 
action, or superior faculties of inference,” are sufficient. Also,  
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
several characteristics of learning, subsidiary to the three 
main laws, arestated. They are of concrete use in the tech- 
nique of teaching and go to reémphasize the fact that all learn- 
ing is animal learning, that 
He (man) is first of all an associative mechanism working to avoid what 
disturbs the life processes of certain neurons. If we begin by fabricating 
imaginary powers and faculties, or if we avoid thought by loose and empty 
terms, or if we stay lost in wonder at the extraordinary versatility and 
inventiveness of the higher forms of learning, we shall never understand 
man’s progress or control his education. 
Further discussion in the second volume is concerned with 
the improvement of mental functions, the amount, rate, 
and limit of such improvement, the conditions under which 
it takes place, changes in rate and its permanence, and, 
finally, the effect which improvement in one function has 
upon improvement in another. 
Volume III treats of two additional main topics: mental 
work and fatigue, and individual differences and their causes. 
Of the two perhaps the second, to date, has had more actual 
effect on schoolroom practice; though the first, with the 
implied corollaries concerning the greater efficiency of self- 
motivated activity, has been somewhat applied. The ques- 
tion of the relative influence of heredity and environment, 
heretofore largely a speculative question and settled largely 
in terms of mere words, is, in accordance with the general 
point of view of the whole volume, attacked objectively. 
Yet, unfortunately, there are still so-called educational 
psychologies used both as texts and as foundations for 
schoolroom practice that ignore all of this, and which imply 
more or less definitely that teaching can compensate for 
any and all germinal deficiencies. It is perhaps particu- 
larly in the domain of measurement, which is, of course, 
implied in the conception of heredity, structure, and learn- 
ing which we have described, that the greatest difference 
of opinion has manifested itself. Several attacks have re-
-P-A-G-E-127
  DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 111 
cently been made on the propriety of attempting to measure 
intelligence and particularly of basing the treatment of the 
pupil upon findings in this field. William C. Bagley, in 
his article in School and Society for April, 1922, seems to 
revert in part to the old tradition that mental ability may 
be created by good conditions of teaching as well as of the 
general environment. This is, of course, a denial of psy- 
chological determinism and a return to the Herbartian free- 
will controversies. That the question is entangled with the 
philosophical implications of a democratic theory of educa- 
tion is true; but, as we have already seen, philosophical 
considerations, no matter how noble, are limited by the 
psychological nature of the individual and the process of 
learning. Such a denial of the truth of the principles of 
measuring intelligence contradicts, also, the phenomena of 
individual differences, and would seem to run counter to 
that concept of original nature embodied in the laws of learn- 
ing. 
New Relations between Psychology, Philosophy, and 
Methods 
There is another aspect of the recent educational psy- 
chology that deserves mention, namely, its more complete 
agreement, in spirit and method, with philosophy. Philos- 
ophy itself, during the period we have been considering, 
went through a change and development not unlike that 
which psychology in general and educational psychology 
in particular, experienced. Again the names of James, 
Dewey, and Thorndike deserve major mention from our 
point of view. All of them, whether dealing with concrete 
questions of human nature or larger generalizations, reflect 
that newer philosophical attitude that is, in a sense, the 
reflection into the field of philosophy of the method and the 
technique of science. As we have seen, Dewey, in his earlier 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  112 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
papers in the Herbart club, was already expressing this 
newer point of view; James emphatically preached it; and 
Thorndike in his Educational Psychology as well as Dewey 
in his later Democracy and Education have continued it. 
This more complete agreement between educational philos- 
ophy and educational psychology contrasts decidedly with 
the situation at the beginning of the period we are consider- 
ing. It is to be expected that this agreement will lead to 
better and further development in both fields. Both are 
pragmatic, both interested in fact and induction, both aim- 
ing at concrete betterment of social life and individual ex- 
pression, both are in the service of human values. 
Of actual changes in classroom method during the period 
we are discussing little need be said here. Schoolroom 
practice is always a reflection, partly of current theory and 
partly of the native endowment of the teacher. Unfortu- 
nately, the theory which affects practice is too often the theory 
of a school which is passing out. We may, however, briefly 
note some present tendencies; briefly, since other papers 
in this volume treat the subject in detail. Such changes as 
are tending to occur, and which are, here and there, more 
definitely adopted, reflect roughly that conception which 
we have seen in our examination of Thorndike. From 
this point of view interest is now interpreted as part of the 
biological readiness for a given situation instead of some- 
thing subsequent to uninterested effort. The curriculum 
as a whole, and separate subjects within the curriculum, 
tend now also to be presented from the point of view of readi- 
ness and to be continued from the point of view of effect 
more than was true earlier in the period. The creative 
self-expression of the pupil, limited by a broad social concep- 
tion, is now more central in the teaching-learning situation, 
where once teacher or subject matter (or both) was central. 
Once association, predominantly intellectual in character,
-P-A-G-E-129
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 113 
was both process and aim; now, particularly in the project 
work, both activities and aims are seen in terms of larger 
psychological reactions, involving attitude, motor expres- 
sion, and habits as well as mere associative knowledge of a 
purely intellectual character. Once the school was almost 
universally thought of as a special environment differing 
abruptly from that outside ; now, we tend to eliminate differ- 
ences. ‘‘Formal steps” have become relatively obsolete ; 
we have realized at last that, if there is no royal road to 
learning, so also there is none to “imparting” knowledge. 
The Present Position 
The present period, then, represents a compromise, speak- 
ing particularly of practice, between the theories of twenty- 
five years ago and those which have grown since then as a 
reaction to them. If we were roughly to forecast the devel- 
opment of the immediate future, we suspect that it will show 
first a gradually increasing application of all the implications 
of original nature, a far more deliberate use of the laws of 
learning in connection with it, a much freer field for the ex- 
pression of native abilities and individual interests, an in- 
creasing realization that, since education in the broadest 
sense of the word actually does begin at birth, we should 
therefore control it earlier, and finally not only an increased 
use of measurement of a more accurate kind than we have 
now but measurement in fields which, at the moment, have 
been barely touched on. This last leads us to remark that 
as far back as 1910, and again in 1912, in the Journal of 
Educational Psychology, Dr. E. Jones of London called at- 
tention not only to the importance of emotional condition- 
ings but also to the additional fact that they occur very 
early in life and that they are very often the basis of later 
large interests and nervous readinesses of the individual. 
Whether we call it Freudian, or whether we merely think
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of it as that branch of psychology which concerns itself 
with the early emotional experiences and conditionings 
of infant and child life, is not a matter of importance. It 
is, however, very important to realize that later interests, 
even such broad fields of interest as the choice of a profession, 
are involved. The whole concept of repression bears impor- 
tant relation to the later development of disinterested and 
refractory children; the process of sublimation is akin to 
that of socialization. Again the many nervous traits of 
school children as well as some sense-organ deficiencies and 
the so-called ‘‘nervous breakdowns” of adolescence are 
intimately related to the early pre-school years. All this 
is thoroughly in accord with the educational psychology 
which we have considered in our discussion of Thorndike ; 
it merely emphasizes, because of its contrast with the ear- 
lier point of view, the unity of the organism and the fact that 
neither education nor life is merely intellectual. It is to be 
hoped that with the further growth of those principles of 
educational psychology to which Thorndike has given most 
definite expression, we will see also an adequate extension 
of social interest and control to the very earliest experi- 
ences of the growing and learning child. That we have, 
in any sense or in any direction, achieved either absolute 
truth or complete knowledge is doubtful; it is to be hoped 
also that the immediate future will see a tremendous growth 
of further research and experiment along those lines which 
have already been so tremendously productive of satisfac- 
tory results.

  CHAPTER V 
DEVELOPMENT OF Tests AND MEASUREMENTS 
The measurement movement in education lies well within 
the last quarter-century of our educational history. Yet, 
within the space available here it is not possible to present 
more than a meager outline of its development, so completely 
has the idea of measurement permeated every aspect of 
educational theory and practice. In its broader concep- 
tion the movement represents virtually a new philosophy 
of education; in its narrower sense, a new technique, a 
new set of devices, for use in the study of education. 
The movement is not unrelated to the past, however 
distinctive it may seem in its methods and its accomplish- 
ments. The practical collections of quantitative facts 
about education and about various aspects of the mind 
reach back some decades. So although the idea of quantity 
in education and psychology is not entirely new, yet the 
mere study of how many children and of how much was 
spent, the studies of sensation and of time reaction, stopped 
short of our needs. Out of these, however, came a more 
careful and a wider use of the comparative method of study- 
ing educational statistics, and a new approach to the study 
of the mind by studying individual differences; and from 
these came the idea of educational measurement as we now 
think of it. All this time our need has been the same. We 
needed to know not only how much instruction cost, but 
also how much instruction we got for what was spent? 
Not only is the child bright or dull, but how bright or how 
dull, and what does brightness or dullness mean in terms of 
117  
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
achievement in school work? These were the questions for 
which answers were needed. 
Yet, however like efforts of the past in its main purposes, 
and in the general objects of study, the measurement move- 
ment offers a substantial departure, both in its methods 
and in the tangible character of its conclusions. It studies, 
not part by part, but all of the mind, by studying its behavior 
under certain controlled conditions, its progress in studies, 
and the results of amounts of study. Finally, it states its 
findings in exact quantitative terms. 
Specifically this movement covers three separate, though 
by no means unrelated, fields; viz., statistical technique 
as applied to educational and psychological phenomena, 
educational measurements, and mental measurements. The 
development of statistical method, together with its appli- 
cation to educational and mental measurement, gives edu- 
cational statistics almost the status of a distinct science, 
or branch of the general science of statistics. Whether 
statistics is regarded as a mere ‘‘handmaiden”’ to psychology 
and education in the measurement movement, therefore, 
or whether almost the reverse relationship is claimed, may 
depend upon one’s interest. The truth is, their develop- 
ment has gone along together, and any complete history of 
measurement can no more omit the method or technique 
of measuring than it can omit the results of the application 
of that technique. 
In each of these movements the developments have been 
along two lines: the one theoretical, the other practical ; 
the one in search of general principles and rules, the other 
of the application of these principles in the management of 
intelligence and education. The one has given us tests and 
scales, or units of measure, which embody a theory and 
technique for measuring intelligence and the results of the 
application of intelligence to the study of our school subjects.
-P-A-G-E-135
    DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 119 
The other has given us reorganization, altered our proce- 
dure, and done away with much waste of time and energy. 
More than this, if possible, they have, together, thrown 
new light upon the meaning of mind and upon the meaning 
of education, and have given us a new hope and a new con- 
fidence that education may yet establish itself upon a highly 
scientific and professional plane. 
Only the barest outline of the achievements to date, and, 
by no means, of the innumerable technical and philosophical 
problems that have been solved or met with along the way, 
can be offered here. 
Development of Educational Statistics 
The word “‘statistics’’ has undergone change, but, accord- 
ing to Meitzen, it has been used in one form or another since 
1668. Since very early times, collections of classified facts 
have been made, particularly in connection with the problems 
of state. Ancient history abounds in illustrations and we are 
still collecting, for similar practical purposes, very much the 
same kinds of facts: facts about extent of land, census, mar- 
riages, deaths, number of soldiers, tax lists, products, and the 
like. 
At first statistics seem to have been little more than classi- 
fied lists of important facts. The method employed was 
too simple to have attracted attention ; hence it was natural 
that such studies of facts should be thought of only as studies 
of facts and not at all as studies of the mathematical treat- 
ment of such collections. Accordingly, Achenwall, who re- 
viewed the statistical work of his predecessors, looked upon 
statistics as a study of the total of all the remarkable facts 
about a state (Staatsmerkwiirdigkeiten), the purpose of such 
study being to gain political wisdom. 
Such a view as this would probably have persisted to 
the present had not the need for statistics increased with
-P-A-G-E-136
  
120 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION: 
the development of the state in western Europe, and had 
not scientific students begun to study the facts about popu- 
lation, deaths, and taxes, and to apply in these studies such 
new mathematical developments as the theory of proba- 
bilities, which had been worked out by Fermat, Pascal (1654), 
and Huygens (1657), scientifically determined in 1793 by 
Jacques Bernoulli, and expanded by many subsequent stu- 
dents of statistics. Halley’s mortality tables, Jean de Witt’s 
principles for annuity life insurance, the portrayal in graphic 
form of important state facts by Acherson in 1741, Malthus’s 
law of diminishing returns in agriculture and his study of 
population, all tended to show that it is possible, not only 
to count facts, and to average them and study tendencies, 
but also that even where the facts are widely varied, certain 
relationships can be found by applying mathematical prin- 
ciples in their analysis. As early as 1662 John Graunt’s 
studies brought to light the relation of death rate to seasons, 
the ratio of male to female births, and other similar rela- 
tionships, and really introduced the idea of statistics as a 
scientific method of observation. 
It took a few centuries of experience with enumerations 
of facts to learn how to treat and interpret facts in large 
numbers; ¢.g., how to increase one’s accuracy of observa- 
tion and how to manipulate collections of facts so that real 
causes could be distinguished from fortuitous causes. It 
is easy to see what would happen if a weight were placed 
upon one end of a beam which is balanced upon a fulcrum. 
There the number of forces involved is few and the cause 
is intimately connected with the result. But when social, 
economic, moral, physical, intellectual, and biological forces 
are operating together in almost innumerable combinations, 
as is often true when we are dealing with educational prob- 
lems, it is not easy to see precisely what constitutes cause. 
Hence, without studying many similar combinations, we  
-P-A-G-E-137
DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 121 
can anticipate effect only by a guess. In other words, ordi- 
nary inductive reasoning breaks down and we are forced 
either to guess or find a way to estimate probability. What 
chance has an American boy of becoming six feet tall, of 
being able to recite the multiplication tables, or to enter 
high school at a given age? If the state could guess intelli- 
gently about its chances to win in a battle, if the school 
could guess intelligently about boys, then administration 
of state and school might be put upon a scientific basis. 
What was needed first was a knowledge of averages or 
central tendencies in great masses of facts, and of the way 
and extent to which individual cases varied from that norm. 
The next need was a knowledge of causal relationships: 
What are the chances that a boy 72 inches high will weigh 
152 pounds? That a boy who makes high marks in algebra 
will make equally high marks in Latin or English composi- 
tion? 
It is not possible, nor is it the purpose, here to trace the 
development of the mathematical principles and formule 
necessary to solve these and related questions. It is in- 
teresting to point out, however, that these are typical of 
what came to be practical problems for students in all the 
sciences. The science of statistics did not grow up as a 
separate and distinct field. Neither did it branch off from 
mathematics alone, nor did it grow out of the physical 
sciences alone. Each of these contributed, as the history 
of mathematics, astronomy, and physics shows; but, after 
all, the studies of practical problems of government, and 
the studies of the natural sciences, owing to the complexity 
of their phenomena, contributed even more. These sciences 
could not be carried beyond the simplest inferences without 
a complicated statistical technique. Accordingly it was in 
the actual collections of social and biological statistics that 
the necessity for and the possibilities of statistical science 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
122 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
as a method of observation of facts in the aggregate had 
their beginning. 
What is suggested by these few comments on the history 
of statistics applies also for education. We collected statis- 
tics for a very long time before any serious attempt was 
made to tell what general truths were revealed by our col- 
umns of figures. We counted children, income, expendi- 
tures, attendance, and passes and failures for a long time, as 
nations counted population, deaths, and marriages, and 
we did it for similar practical reasons. Educational sta- 
tistics were merely one special collection of official statis- 
tics. 
Our interest here is to see whether and in what way stu- 
dents of education have contributed to the building up of 
a statistical science. This we may do by pointing to the 
application of statistical method in the solution of educa- 
tional problems. These contributions begin with Francis 
Galton (1822-1911), who was not, in a strict sense, an edu- 
cator, but whose studies of heredity, eugenics, and psychology 
went far toward laying educational foundations. One has 
only to read through a list of titles of Galton’s publications 
to realize that his interest in mathematics and in statisti- 
cal method was both wide and profound. (See appendix to 
his Memories of My Life.) His studies of nature and nur- 
ture, of school statistics, and of a wide variety of anthropo- 
metric and psychological problems identify Galton with 
the beginnings of scientific work in education and the im- 
mediately allied fields of biology, psychology, sociology, 
and eugenics. In all these studies the statistical method 
was applied. 
Leaving aside the uses of mathematics in his early studies 
of meteorology, Galton attacked the problem of. heredity 
by a statistical method and published his Hereditary Genius 
in 1869. This, according to Galton, was the first attempt
-P-A-G-E-139
    DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 123 
to apply statistics to the study of heredity. (See preface 
to the first edition of Hereditary Genius.) In this work 
Galton applies the law of “deviation from an average” 
(p. 22) in the study of the leading men of the British Isles. 
Mathematically the study offered nothing new. It was 
new, however, in the materials used and in the ends sought. 
In addition to numerous scientific papers in which he used 
statistics, his English Men of Science appeared in 1874, his 
Human Faculty in 1883, and his Natural Inheritance in 1889. 
It is in this latter study that we find the largest develop- 
ment of his statistical principles. Here he explains graphi- 
cally how to study distributions of facts, defines median and 
explains its properties, shows how to compare two distri- 
butions that are not equal in numbers of observations, shows 
how the distributions of his facts about human beings con- 
form to the mathematical curve of frequency of error, ex- 
plains how to handle the problem of deviation from average, 
how to construct an entire scheme of the distribution when 
the median and the amount of variability are known, and 
gives a graphic demonstration of how to figure correlation, 
or, as he termed it in this study, regression. 
From a purely mathematical standpoint there is not so 
much that is entirely new in Galton’s work. (Galton was 
undoubtedly familiar with Quetelet’s Sur l’homme et le dé- 
veloppement de ses facultés, ou essat de physique sociale (1835) 
as well as with Quetelet’s earlier studies of population and 
of the theory of probabilities.) It is a study in probabilities. 
Yet, statistically speaking, it is quite new. How does the 
law of error apply to the type of social and biological facts 
in question? As early as 1879 Galton, referring to Weber’s 
law, pointed out that “‘the geometric mean appears to be 
equally applicable to the majority of the influences, which, 
combined with those of purely vital phenomena, give rise 
to the events with which sociology deals.”’ The statistical
-P-A-G-E-140
ee ea ee ae a TRIN CHT Tn re 
124 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
implications of this suggestion for the social and biological 
data with which he worked were very clearly revealed. 
This suggests the foundation upon which educational 
statistics have been built. To this, Karl Pearson, a co- 
worker with Galton and in several ways his real successor, 
has contributed. He has clarified, proved, and expanded 
Galton’s work at many points, and particularly in the tech- 
nique for studying relationships between sets of facts. In 
America, Cattell and Thorndike took up the same study of 
nature and nurture, and utilized the statistical method. It 
is certainly very near the whole truth to say that, with 
Thorndike, the study of educational statistics proper had 
its birth. 
There is not space to relate the story which the last para- 
graph suggests, nor to tell what was happening in other 
fields. According to Meitzen, statistics had been taught 
in universities since 1660. At first the subject consisted of 
little more than lists of political and economic facts, but in 
due course statistical method began to receive attention. 
Meitzen’s Geschichte, Theorie und Technik der Statistik ap- 
peared in 1886, M. Block’s Traité théorique et pratique de 
statistique in 1886, Mayo Smith’s Statistics and Economics 
in 1888, Gabaglio’s Teoria generale della statistica in 1888, 
Westergaard’s Theorie der Statistik.in 1890, Dr. George von 
Mayo’s Theoretische Statistik in 1895, Dr. Bertillon’s Cours 
élémentaire de statistique in 1895, and Bowley’s Elements of 
Statistics in 1902. These books are in part historical, in 
part they deal merely with tables of facts, but all treat 
statistical method in some measure. Bowley’s book is more 
nearly than any other a full textbook treatment. All were 
concerned with social and economic facts. 
In 1902-03 Thorndike offered a course at Teachers Col- 
lege, Columbia University [Education (or Psychology), 108— 
Practicum: the application of psychological and _statis-
-P-A-G-E-141
    DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 125 
tical method to education], which appears to have been the 
first attempt of its kind in this country — and, doubtless, 
in any country. Courses of a somewhat similar character 
were first offered at Chicago University in 1908-09, at Stan- 
ford University in 1909-10, at Brown University in 1911-12, 
at Harvard in 1912-13, at Indiana in 1913-14, at Minnesota 
‘in 1915-16, and at Missouri in 1919-20. In some of these 
institutions it is clear that the subject had been touched 
upon in other courses previous to these dates, and that 
many actual statistical studies had been directed earlier. 
In 1903 Thorndike’s Educational Psychology appeared, and 
in 1904 his Theory of Mental and Social Measurements. 
Whatever had been accomplished by the statistical studies 
that had come from Teachers College previous to this, and 
from the scattering studies from other sources, these books 
established educational statistics as part of the higher curric- 
ulum in education. A list of the titles of statistical studies 
in education which have appeared subsequent to these dates 
would include a large percentage of the doctors’ disserta- 
tions as well as other original contributions in the field. 
It is difficult to say in few words what the study of statis- 
tics has brought to education. Galton was greatly concerned 
about the possibilities of education. He saw the power of 
nature as no one before him had seen it, and realized that 
nurture’s only hope of control lay in the possibility of select- 
ing and directing nature; hence, his interest in eugenics. 
These conceptions he arrived at through the use of statis- 
tics. Now we are bringing this same viewpoint and tech- 
nique to bear upon every aspect of school work. In our physi- 
cal, mental, and educational tests we have units of measure 
for various aspects of both nature and nurture, and in many 
of our city school systems, in a few of our state systems, 
and in many normal schools, teachers’ colleges, and univer- 
sity schools of education there have been established bureaus
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  126 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of research and statistics devoted to the quantitative study 
of the schools. As early as 1904 the results of a simple 
statistical study of retardation in the schools of New York 
City appeared in the superintendent’s annual report. The 
facts revealed were startling. To-day such studies are part 
of routine work in school administration. The survey move- 
ment which began in 1911 began with little understanding 
of the use of statistics, but as rapidly as a technique was 
developed it was brought to bear in survey work and the 
progress made in a dozen years is clearly revealed by survey 
literature. 
Mental Measurements 
Very early in his studies of human faculty Galton declared 
that ‘one of the most important objects of measurement 
is to obtain a general knowledge of the capacities of a man 
by sinking shafts, as it were, at a few critical points. In 
order to ascertain the best points for the purpose, the sets 
of measures should be compared with an independent esti- 
mate of the man’s powers. We thus may learn which of 
the measures are the most instructive.” By ‘independent 
estimate” he meant a judgment of the man as ‘mobile, 
eager, energetic; well-shaped, successful at games requiring 
good eye and hand; sensitive; good at music and draw- 
ing.” 
While one could hardly say that Galton gave us mental 
tests as we know them now, surely the above statement, 
together with the measurement work which Galton did, 
stand as a worthy claim to an important place in the history 
of mental measurements. It is not clear just what Galton’s 
work had meant to Binet, who is properly regarded as the 
originator of mental tests, but surely the above statement 
clearly anticipates, both in aim and method, what Binet 
actually accomplished in 1905. What Galton did accomplish
-P-A-G-E-143
  DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 127 
was to establish the idea of individual study and measure- 
ment of human traits. 
In America Professor J. McK. Cattell took up this line 
of study and soon won recognition for it as a standard di- 
vision of the field of psychology. The field has been further 
exploited by Professor E. L. Thorndike, and through his 
work the results of such studies have been brought more 
directly to bear upon the problems of instruction. One 
can see Galton’s early studies of nature and nurture passing 
through his own laboratory into that of Cattell, where more 
evidence and finer methods of measurement were added, 
and thence to Thorndike, from whom they have issued as 
generalizations upon the technique of instruction and as 
effectual means of measuring the results of instruction, and 
later, of the capacity to receive instruction. Whatever 
Galton’s work had suggested to Binet, however, it is clear 
that Binet’s own training and work must have brought 
him naturally step by step to the idea of intelligence and 
to the idea of tests for intelligence that are embodied in 
his mental tests. Like Galton and Cattell he saw the im- 
portance of exact measurements of individual traits. Like 
them, too, he tried to ‘‘sink shafts” into human capacities. 
In point of emphasis, however, Binet laid stress upon the 
total general power or capacity for which his sample sound- 
ings seemed to stand and worked for a test that would char- 
acterize the whole of mental capacity rather than a single 
part of it. 
In his approach to the task of measuring human intelli- 
gence, Binet was not so much a free lance as Galton had 
been. Appointed in 1904 by the Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion to membership on a commission charged with the study 
of measures to be taken for insuring the benefits of instruc- 
tion to defective children, he found himself face to face with 
the problem of deciding who among the children are defec-
-P-A-G-E-144
    
128 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tive. Stimulated by this practical demand, and by what a 
solution to the question might mean to future commissions, 
as well as by a genuine scientific interest, Binet, together 
with Dr. Simon, set to work upon the necessary tests. By 
their writings it is now easy to trace the careful and patient 
steps by which they moved steadily on toward their goal. 
They carefully reviewed the studies upon which medical 
practice based its diagnosis of mental defects, and proceeded 
to the detailed study and examination of individual cases. 
In due course they published the 1905 Tests, and finally, 
in 1908, their scale for the measurement of intelligence. 
It would not be true to say that this new line of study 
owed nothing to the past or to the work of contemporaries. 
Acknowledgment is made by the authors of suggestions 
received from the work of Preyer, Perez, Sully, and Shinn, 
and from scattered notes published in the Pedagogical Semi- 
nary, and especially to the work with retarded children 
going on at Brussels under the direction of Dr. Demoor. 
From these sources, however, could not have come the es- 
‘sential contribution, the conception of the practical value 
of an exact measurement of native intelligence apart from 
accomplishment, and the development of a means of mak- 
ing such measurements. 
That the authors of these tests must have done a consider- 
able amount of careful analytical thinking, or plain theoriz- 
ing, at the outset, is clear from their publications of 1905 
and earlier. The point that stands out in their work, how- 
ever, is their painstaking study of almost numberless more 
or less isolated facts about individual children, all as a part 
of their search for a promising hypothesis as to what native 
intelligence might prove to be. 
In presenting their 1908 Measuring Scale of Intelligence 
the authors state their program as being: ‘“‘first, to deter- 
mine the law of intellectual development of children and
-P-A-G-E-145
DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 129 
to devise a method of measuring their intelligence; and, 
second, to study the diversity of their intellectual aptitudes.” 
This is virtually the program that has been followed by all 
students of this field as well as by Binet and Simon. From 
the outset they sought to make their tests “simple, rapid, 
convenient, precise, heterogeneous.”’ They sought ‘‘to 
evaluate a level of intelligence” and to disregard the results 
of instruction, and considered it unnecessary to test all of a 
child’s psychological processes. Their tests were based 
upon the assumption that native intelligence would be ade- 
quately revealed by tests of the ‘‘faculty of judgment, other- 
wise called good sense, practical sense, initiative, the faculty 
of adapting one’s self to circumstances.” Although the 
Ebbinghaus Completion Test, devised in 1905, deserves 
special mention, even in this brief review of intelligence 
tests, yet, in view of the studies of memory, sensation, and 
time reaction that were in process in psychological labora- 
tories elsewhere, this program of Binet seems a rather bold 
departure. 
It is not necessary to describe here the tests as originally 
formulated or as later revised. They were made up of 
actual responses of children to a very large number of tests 
and so embodied only such elements as were found to be 
within the common experiences and common interests of 
children, age by age. The individual tests were in some 
cases quite similar to tests previously used by Cattell, and 
earlier still by Galton, for testing sensory and motor phases 
of mentality. In addition to this type other tests were 
concerned with the child’s familiarity with common objects, 
and especially with ability to make comparisons and ac- 
curate judgments on higher levels. The 1905 scale included 
thirty roughly standardized tests, the 1908 scale was more 
elaborate and included fifty-six tests, arranged by age groups 
from three to thirteen years. This scale was revised in
-P-A-G-E-146
130 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
1911, providing five tests for each year except one from 
three to ten and in addition five each for the ages twelve 
and fifteen. 
This idea of mental testing was soon taken up in this 
country. In the school for subnormal children at Vineland 
Dr. Henry Goddard introduced the 1905 tests in the latter 
part of 1908. Later he tested 2000 normal children, and in 
1908 prepared a revision of the Binet-Simon scale. A second 
revision was made by Kuhlman in 1909-12 in connection 
with his work in the Faribault, Minnesota, school for sub- 
normal children. In 1912 Terman and Childs revised and 
extended the scale, and in 1916 the Stanford revision ap- 
peared. This latter revision by Dr. Terman is also an ex- 
tension of the scale as well. It includes ninety tests in all, 
six for each age level from three to ten, eight for the age of 
twelve, and six for the age of fourteen. It also includes 
six tests for average adults and six for superior adults, and 
in a number of cases alternate tests were provided. In 1915 
Yerkes, Bridges, and Hardwick published their ‘Point 
Scale for Measuring Mental Ability,” and Otis worked out a 
standardization of an absolute point scale on the basis of 
the Binet tests in 1920. 
The Binet tests and their revisions rely very largely upon 
words and only slightly upon activities, and they appeal 
largely to abstract intelligence. This naturally places some 
limitations upon their use. To meet such objections tests 
of performance have been devised, of which the form board, 
originating with Seguin, is a common type. The Healy 
manikin puzzle, picture puzzles, and the maze tests have 
also proved useful. 
All these tests were designed at the outset for use with 
individuals, persons, or animals. As a consequence their 
use on a large scale in large school systems was next to im- 
possible. When the United States entered the World War,
-P-A-G-E-147
DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 131 
psychologists were called upon to suggest how psychology 
might be of service. The result was the development of 
two types of group tests known as the Alpha and the Beta 
tests. The former was verbal in character and used to 
test literates; the latter, of the performance type, was used 
to test illiterates. The success of these tests gave an added 
impetus to mental testing and especially to the idea of group 
tests. Already more than forty group tests have been pre- 
pared, many of which are standardized. 
From the beginning the questions of what is general intel- 
ligence, and how important is general intelligence as a fac- 
tor in success, have held the center of the stage, even though 
all the study seemed devoted to the solution of the prac- 
tical problem of classifying children on the basis of intelli- 
gence. Two definitions seem to have been evolved as a 
result of work to date. One states that general intelligence 
is a unitary.or central inborn factor, while the other con- 
ceives it to be a composite of a number of more or less closely 
related innate capacities to become intelligent in various 
life activities. More recently attempts have been made to 
get at the meaning of factors other than intelligence. Pro- 
fessor June E. Downey has devised a tentative scale for 
measurement of the volitional pattern as the outcome of 
the ‘‘Will-Profile Experiment,” Dr. Paul F. Voelker has 
devised a test for trustworthiness, and S. C. Liao has pre- 
pared a moral-judgment scale in the form of a “‘best rea- 
sons” test. These are three quite different approaches to 
the measurement of character traits other than the intellec- 
tual, and though crude and inadequate they indicate lines 
of exploration that are likely to be fruitful as experiments 
accumulate. 
The work on intelligence tests has been done in part by 
those engaged in tasks calling for psychological studies, 
and in part by university and college professors. Binet,
-P-A-G-E-148
132 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Goddard, Kuhlman, and the very large number of psycholo- 
gists employed in public school systems and in schools for 
defectives and delinquents have approached the task with 
administrative problems to solve, and much of scientific 
value has come from these sources. The psychologists 
who were university instructors soon began to offer courses 
on the subject or to include some discussion of the problem 
as a topic in more general courses. Brown and Stanford 
Universities offered work in this line as early as 1911-12, 
and more recently the work has found a place in all well- 
staffed departments. 
The extent to which mental tests have been employed 
in a practical way would be difficult fully to define. They 
were made in the schools and with reference to school stand- 
ards and school conditions. As a consequence, their prac- 
tical worth was almost guaranteed from the start. There 
had long been needed a means for accurate classification 
of children. These tests were made with reference to just 
that need. The question was, Could we put this new device 
to work? As early as 1904 we had begun to make statistical 
studies of children’s progress in school, but, aside from this, 
there had been little that would provide school people with 
the experience, to say nothing of the confidence and zeal, 
necessary to the task of making practical use of mental 
tests. The truth is, however, that prompt beginnings were 
made and that the movement has fairly swept across the 
country. The complete story would doubtless tell of much 
that is crude and futile — tests half standardized and with 
little validity, tests badly administered, many tests given 
but with results inadequately treated, results obtained but 
no administrative decisions made, tests given without refer- 
ence to a real program — yet the work went forward. Se- 
lection of pupils for special and ungraded classes began to 
be made on the basis of these tests from the start. Then
-P-A-G-E-149
  DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 133 
attempts were made, as under Dr. Dixon at Oakland, to 
classify all entrants to first-grade work on the basis of mental 
tests and to follow up with such reclassifications as were 
necessary for the group as it went forward through the 
grades. Similarly, rapid advancement and opportunity 
classes have been formed, doubtful promotions have been 
determined, and, almost uniformly, the results have shown 
that mental age is a sound basis of classification when rea- 
sonable allowance is made for achievement. In most of 
the state schools for delinquents mental tests are used in 
connection with the classification and discipline of children, 
and as early as 1916 mental tests began to be used in connec- 
tion with college entrance examinations. The survey move- 
ment took up the idea early and most of the city school 
departments of research are utilizing mental tests in a prac- 
tical way. In all these capacities the value of the tests has 
been clearly demonstrated, and the best proof of their prac- 
tical service is shown by the extent to which they are being 
used throughout the country. 
Educational Measurements 
In 1905 Binet and Simon, in their discussion of the neces- 
sity of establishing a scientific diagnosis of inferior states of 
intelligence, declared in favor of three methods: the medi- 
cal, the pedagogical, and the psychological. By the peda- 
gogical method they meant ‘‘making an inventory of the 
total knowledge of a subject’”’ possessed by a child. After 
stating that the idea of such a method had been obtained 
from Dr. Demoor and his colleagues, they add that ‘‘these 
authors do not seem to appreciate the need of precise meth- 
ods of evaluating . . . the amount of retardation in in- 
struction.”’ So far as carrying out the idea of educational 
measurement so clearly suggested here their work went no 
further.
-P-A-G-E-150
  134 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
At a much earlier date (1902-03) a Teachers College, 
Columbia University, bulletin announced a course by Pro- 
fessor Thorndike as follows : 
Education (or Psychology) 108— Practicum. The application of 
psychological and statistical methods to education. The course will deal 
with means of measurement of physical, mental, and moral qualities, in- 
cluding the abilities involved in the school subjects, and rates of progress 
in various functions; the treatment of averages; measurement of rela- 
tionships ; etc. 
It is clear from this announcement that educational meas- 
urement, as we now understand it, had at that time become 
a definite possibility in the mind of Professor Thorndike. 
In view of the outcome of the work which he thus initiated 
it seems proper to refer to the year 1902, and to Teach- 
ers College, as the time and place of the formal launch- 
ing of the present movement in educational tests and 
scales. 
Tests, in many respects like the tests of to-day, had been 
made much earlier than this, though little or nothing came 
of them. The earliest of these, according to a report only 
recently discovered by Professor Kandel (Journal of Edu- 
cational Psychology, Vol. IV, p. 551), were devised and used 
by the Rev. George Fisher, of the Greenwich Hospital school 
in England, in 1864. This report quotes the following state- 
ment : 
A book called the “Scale Book” has been established, which contains 
the numbers assigned to each degree of proficiency in the various subjects 
of examination : for instance, if it be required to determine the numerical 
equivalent corresponding to any specimen of “ writing,’ a comparison 
is made with the various standard specimens, which are arranged in this 
book in order of merit; the highest being represented by the number 1, 
and the lowest by 5, and the intermediate values by affixing to these num- 
bers the fractions }, 3, or 3. So long as these standard specimens are 
preserved in the institution, so long will instant numerical values for pro- 
ficiency in “writing’’ be maintained. And since facsimiles can be multi- 
plied without limit, the same principle might be generally adopted. 
This work antedates Galton’s development of statistics, 
and certainly it is noteworthy even though it shows only 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
  DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 135 
a partial grasp of the statistical problem involved in de- 
vising standards of this sort. It is unfortunate that it was 
permanently lost so far as any contribution to the pres- 
ent movement is concerned. Another attempt, antedating 
Thorndike’s work by nearly a decade, was far more impor- 
tant in its bearing upon later developments. In 1894, Dr. 
J. M. Rice conceived the idea of educational tests and soon 
put such tests to work. The immediate result was striking. 
At first practically no educator accepted Rice’s conclusions. 
Yet, the general idea would not down and, though his meth- 
ods were faulty, he at least provoked a discussion which 
ended some years later, if it is yet ended, in the complete 
acceptance of the idea of measuring the results of instruc- 
tion and in the general acceptance of the statistical method 
in the study of education. This implies, too, the rejection 
of the traditional disciplinary aim and function of instruc- 
tion and study. This implication has been accepted for 
elementary instruction, largely accepted for secondary in- 
struction, and higher education is yielding to it at many 
points. These far-reaching effects of his experiment Rice 
probably did not foresee; and, although as a scientific de- 
vice his fifty-word test in spelling was of little worth, yet 
the underlying idea was a permanent contribution. 
The wide discussion provoked by Rice prepared the way 
for the more scientific work which was to follow. By the 
autumn of 1902, Thorndike had learned enough about meas- 
urement to give place to the subject in one of his university 
courses. Whether the idea of measuring the results of arith- 
metic instruction and handwriting grew out of his study of 
statistical science or out of his study of psychology of the 
learning process or, most likely, from both, is not important. 
At any rate the Stone arithmetic tests were published in 
1908, and the Thorndike handwriting scale in 1910. This

ment of educational products but also stands as an impor- 
tant final achievement in statistical science. The founda- 
tion work of Galton and the equal difference theorem of 
Cattell had finally issued in an important practical school 
device. 
From this beginning the test movement has gone forward 
rapidly though the problem did not readily find place in 
university courses outside of Teachers College. A course 
dealing with this topic was announced at Stanford University 
in 1911-12. A course was announced at Chicago University 
in 1912-13 (Course 72B), but apparently dealt only with the 
use of test results in connection with the problem of super- 
vision. The University of Minnesota offered a course (No. 
126) in 1915-16 which was devoted to the study of ‘Units 
and Scales for Measuring Achievement in Reading, Composi- 
tion, Spelling, Handwriting and Arithmetic,” and Indiana 
University announced a course (No. 23) in 1917-18. Ac- 
cording to a survey of catalogs for 233 institutions of higher 
learning (Journal of Educational Research, November, 1920) 
most of the state universities, half of the state normal 
schools, nearly half of the non-state universities, and a fair 
number of other types of schools offered courses in educa- 
tional measurements in the summer of 1920. Educational 
measurement has thus become a standard course in most 
departments, schools, and colleges of education. 
Tests or scales have been devised for most of the elemen- 
tary school subjects and for many of the high school subjects. 
The reliability of the later tests is comparatively high and 
the ease with which they may be administered has been 
greatly increased. More and more attention is being de- 
voted to the question of precisely what is tested by any 
given test and to the best means of expressing the results 
of the tests, to the relation of the results to other factors, 
and to similar practical matters.

  . DEVELOPMENT OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS 137 
According to a recent review of test literature more than 
fifty separate and distinct functions have been performed by 
tests (Journal of Educational Research, October, 1922) and 
authors of tests have themselves set forth sixteen different 
functions. It is obvious that tests cannot become a general 
panacea for all educational ills, yet they are rendering a 
large service. As pointed out above in regard to mental 
tests, practically every city school research department is 
carrying out an extensive test program and, judging from 
current literature, from city and state school reports, and 
from the reports of school surveys, beginning quite early in 
the survey movement, there are few city schools in which 
educational tests are not being used and, further, wide use 
of them is being made in rural schools as well. 
From this too brief statement of the origin and develop- 
ment of the measurement movement in education we can 
see how rapidly it has made contact with every nook and 
corner of the field. Statistical technique is being perfected, 
and tests, both mental and educational, are becoming very 
numerous. We measure cost, teaching efficiency, progress 
through school, success in studies, mentality, buildings, 
equipment, textbooks, and attendance by methods and 
devices almost unknown only a dozen years ago. There 
are excellent textbooks covering all aspects of measure- 
ment, and measurement courses hold a prominent place in 
higher professional curricula. 
Further, changes in school practice are being effected. 
Active research departments are now organized in some 
fifty of our city school systems, each devoted to quanti- 
tative studies to be used in directing the school policy. The 
results of mental tests are being widely used as a basis for 
classifying and grading children, and educational tests are 
also used extensively in the same connection and as a basis 
for diagnosing instructional cases.
-P-A-G-E-154

It would not be correct to say that all this rapid headway 
has been made without mistakes. A few important con- 
troversies have arisen on rather important points; and those 
who know most about the movement are surest of the ten- 
tative character of many of the tests and formule that have 
been used widely and with confidence by many workers; 
but that the movement represents the largest quarter cen- 
tury of work that has ever been done in education, no in- 
telligent person can doubt. The student of statistics may 
be going too far with some of his theories to suit the mathe- 
matician ; psychologists may disagree as to just what in- 
telligence is or as to just what mental tests measure; 
mistakes may be made in decisions based upon test results ; 
teachers may be frightened and confused at times; teaching 
may tend to become formal in places because of a narrow 
interpretation of tests and their functions. Granting all 
these things, however, we must point to the solid achieve- 
ments in the way of accomplished reorganization, in the way 
of available facts about the schools, in the way of a large 
amount of scientific literature on education, and in the con- 
fidence and forward look of the leading men in the field 
to-day as the real meaning of the measurement movement 
in education.

Traditional Practices and a New Education 
It is natural that man in the course of his evolution should 
first occupy himself with the conquest of physical nature, 
and that he should only slowly acquire knowledge of human 
nature and classify and use the principles that he formulates 
to determine his progress. It is in the effort to discover 
the fundamental ways in which men act and interact and 
to apply laws in developing conscious social controls that 
traditional practices are giving way to a new education. 
New theories of method and new criteria for judging the 
worth of subject matter to be taught are rapidly remaking 
our common schools. 
Our state public school systems are themselves new ; they 
came in the main in the decade following our war between 
the states. They are a product of a long struggle for demo- 
cratic institutions against social systems transplanted from 
the Old World. Within the lifetime of our own fathers 
we have come to look upon these schools as symbols of our 
faith and hope in democracy, as worth all the burden of 
tax we bear for them. Our forefathers who fought for the 
free-school idea before the Civil War did not dream of the 
industrial and social United States, especially of the modern 
city, that we have come to know, nor did they realize the 
limitations since revealed by biology within which these 
free schools must do the work of social regeneration. They 
did believe that universal education is a necessary corollary 
to free government ; and gradually there has come the con- 
143 .

viction that the perpetuity of our democratic society de- 
pends upon a consciously developed means of carrying on 
our affairs as a group, in short, upon a process of sociali- 
zation in the schools. If we are to become efficient citizens 
in a society in which the individual determines the policies 
of government, we must acquire knowledge socially valuable, 
gain insight and interest in our common problems, be prac- 
ticed in thinking out and solving these problems, and be ac- 
quainted with the laws of habit-formation ; at the same time 
we must conserve and develop the power of initiative of the 
individual and the ability to gain our personal desires through 
teamwork with our fellows for common ends. We must, 
in short, learn to live together before we as individuals can 
gain a ‘“‘fullness of life’ through formal education. The 
methods of the New England township can no longer serve 
as a means in New York or Chicago of carrying on govern- 
ment and training for citizenship. The school must be the 
socializing force. The implications of this social theory 
furnish the key to the outstanding experiments in public 
education during the past twenty-five years. It is Professor 
John Dewey who epitomizes the new idea in his well-known 
declaration: ‘‘Education is not a preparation for life, but 
ts life.”” 
Our early American schools gave a stern, individualistic 
“preparation for life,” for this social philosophy was not 
reflected in their ideals and methods. The elementary 
school of even seventy-five years ago was not a significant 
social institution; problems of specific training for citizen- 
ship were not commonly discussed in teachers’ meetings. 
The curriculum of this school was as meager as its furnish- 
ings. ‘Any person,” we are told by a contemporary, ‘‘who 
could read tolerably and write sufficiently well ‘to set copies’ 
and cypher as far as the rule of three was qualified to become 
a schoolmaster. ... The majority of teachers were feeble
-P-A-G-E-161
DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 145 
men who had not the power to perform physical labor, in- 
dolent men who had not the will to do, or young men and 
women who found it convenient to earn, by a few hours in 
the schoolroom, money and leisure to reach more desired 
goals.” There were indeed some great teachers, such as 
A. Bronson Alcott; but discipline was usually harsh, for 
there were no ‘‘divine rights of childhood’’ to be considered, 
except the other-worldly right to have one’s soul saved. 
There was no group consciousness nor were there common 
ideals to constitute a profession of teaching. Efficacy of 
method depended primarily upon the personality of the 
teacher, his love of learning, and his innate sympathy for 
childhood. There were none of the many social incentives 
to improve classroom technique that we feel in this age; 
the teacher gained his results as seemed best in his own eyes. 
The pre-Civil War attitude toward method and matter 
might be expressed in Mr. Dooley’s own words: ‘‘It doesn’t 
matter what a boy studies so long as he doesn’t like it.” A 
fear of spoiling boys was current, for it appears in 1845 that 
in one Boston school ‘‘the average number of floggings re- 
ported on the basis of a week’s observation was sixty-five 
floggings a day.” And the writer assures us that this was 
a representative school. 
In the early part of the century just passed there were a 
great many reasons for pedagogical absolutism. First 
among these was a lack of faith in and knowledge of the 
original nature or instincts of children. An appeal to in- 
terest was to the teachers of that day an appeal to evil, for 
the theological dogma of original sin was an educational 
dogma as well. There was much talk of “breaking the will 
of the child,” of discipline, suppression, etc. Children were 
“to be seen and not heard.’”’ All of which is in sharp con- 
trast to our present attitude toward childhood, which at 
times goes to the other extreme. There is no chance of
-P-A-G-E-162
146 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
finding in the newspapers of the period such a notice as 
recently appeared in the New York Times (January, 1923) : 
“The wife of the Governor of Pennsylvania will establish 
a ‘talking school’ where the child’s individuality will be 
exercised at will, where children will be permitted to talk 
as much as they please and a teacher employed to romp 
with them.’ 
Second, a general belief prevailed that thinking is an ac- 
tivity only of mature life, that childhood is a period in which 
to store facts and in which to train for later thinking. Minds 
were “‘trained,’”’ as souls were ‘‘purged,’’ by discipline. 
Third, a general faith existed in what is now called formal 
discipline with its ancient scholastic sanctions — the belief 
that mental discipline is inherent in certain selected subjects 
and in the performance of hard and disagreeable tasks. The 
Old Testament conception of morality had not been super- 
seded by the teachings of Jesus and Socrates. Fourth, 
“children being not reasonable can be governed only by 
fear. To impress this fear is, therefore, one of the first 
duties of those who have the care of children.” In contrast, 
Horace Mann reported in 1848 that during his visits to the 
Prussian schools he never saw a ‘‘teacher . . . with a book 
in his hand . . . sitting while hearing a lesson (nor) saw 
one child undergoing punishment or arraigned for miscon- 
duct’’; and he saw “‘tens of thousands of pupils.” 
Not until toward the close of the past century did ‘the 
theory of evolution, a consciousness of the interrelation 
of school and society, the need of conscious control of both 
nature and human nature for social ends, the conception 
of education as growth or development, the Hegelian prin- 
ciple of self-activity as the law of growth, finally find ex- 
pression in a theory of education. The new gospel awaited 
a new psychology, a new sociology, and the development 
of the biological sciences. John Dewey and his predeces-

sors in educational theory — Comenius, Rousseau, Pes- 
talozzi, Froebel, Herbart, Col. F. W. Parker; William 
James, G. Stanley Hall, E. L. Thorndike in psychology ; 
Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward, and their successors in 
sociology ; and the many notable biologists of the last forty 
years, all these have prepared the way for a theory and 
science of education adapted to contemporary civilization 
and the problems that are ahead of it. 
Pestalozzi: The Oswego Movement, the Beginning of 
a Revolution in Method 
Dr. E. A. Sheldon was a courageous leader in the free- 
school movement in the decade before the Civil War. As 
teacher and superintendent of schools at Oswego he threw 
‘the weight of his enthusiasm against the traditional school 
practices of his day. Like Pestalozzi, he had his first teach- 
ing experience with the waifs of society, wild Irish boys, 
sons of sailors in the early Lake Ontario grain trade. Upon 
examining a set of English Pestalozzian objective materials 
in an educational museum in Toronto, Canada, he returned 
. to Oswego determined to “‘psychologize’” knowledge for 
the child and to teach him in a natural way through his 
senses. The work of Dr. Sheldon and his teachers, Herman 
Kriisi, I. B. Poucher, Miss Coopers, and others, contains a 
dramatic story of professional idealism and unselfish service 
which, perhaps, rises above all their contributions to method. 
Dr. Sheldon unquestionably inaugurated a far-reaching 
reform. 
Object Teaching: Observation as Method - 
The textbook was discarded for objects and observation, 
the memorizing of words without meaning to the pupil was 
dropped as an objective of the recitation for ‘‘clear percep- 
tions” or ideas of things and people. In the attic of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
148 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Oswego State Normal School there are yet to be seen the 
remains of an elaborate equipment of stuffed animals and 
birds, minerals, geometrical forms, herbaria, etc., which, 
with excursions and ‘‘conversations,” constituted the media 
of Dr. Sheldon’s object teaching and sense training. The 
beginnings in elementary science made by Oswego mark 
the beginnings of nature study as a method in teaching. 
Unhappily a faulty psychology led the Oswego innovators 
to follow too simple a prescription. To go ‘from the simple 
to the complex’”’ was the logical sequence in building con- 
cepts or clear idea-wholes. ‘‘A subject was analyzed into 
its simplest elements.’ Arithmetic, language, and the new- 
comer in the course of study — natural history and science — 
were “developed”’ orally. ‘‘Powers and faculties” of the 
mind were trained “‘in a graduated series of exercises,”’ start- 
ing “within the (child’s) comprehension . . . exercising 
the child’s powers without exhausting them.” To the over- 
zealous teacher bent on thoroughness, there was no way 
for the child to learn to write, read, draw, etc., except to 
begin in writing and drawing with elemental forms, lines, 
and curves, in reading with the letters of the alphabet, and 
practice on these before satisfying a natural desire to express 
himself. 
Mrs. May Howe Smith ! in The Proceedings of the National 
Teachers’ Association for 1866 gives a remarkably clear state- 
ment of “‘The New Education or Plan for Human Develop- 
ment through Instruction” : 
If subject matter is to contribute to human development, it must be 
presented in the order of the awakening of the faculties, for man first 
observes and reads and then analyzes and reflects and finally formulates 
and applies laws and principles. We believe that in the first years of a 
child’s life the only powers of the mind which are in a high state of develop- 
ment are the perceptive or observing powers, the physical agents of which 
1 Mrs. Smith, once associated with Guyot in the preparation of his geography, 
was Oswego’s teacher of geography. Geography, so important to Colonel 
Parker later, was another contribution of the Oswego movement.  
-P-A-G-E-165
    DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 149 
are the senses, and they are almost the sole means of acquiring definite 
knowledge. Place him in touch with the external world, these clear images 
enter the mind and give rise to ideas. He learns to express those ideas, 
acquires languages, and thus is able to receive ideas from other minds 
acting in conjunction with receptive powers through attaining their full 
development. Later are developed conceptive and retentive powers in- 
cluding memory and imagination. . . . Later still the ability to analyze, 
reflect upon, compare, contract and otherwise investigate the knowledge 
we have already acquired and to derive therefrom new ideas which are 
expressed in the form of abstract propositions. Knowledge becomes 
really available to us as we have the power to grasp it and make it our 
- own. Last is reached that harmonious action of all the faculties wherein 
the reasoning power attains its full development and the mind is able to 
rise to high generalizations, to attain knowledge of general laws and princi- 
ples. ‘The three stages from infancy to mature age are childhood, charac- 
terized by perception and retention; youth, by analysis and reflection ; 
and maturity, the full development and activity of reason. 
In the light of modern thought, one follows quite the op- 
posite procedure. We see a new situation first as a vague 
whole, analyze it, reorganize it into a whole again and use 
it. As Professor Dewey insists, we learn to swim by swim- 
ming in water, not on a bench in practice; to talk by talk- 
ing to people about things that interest us and them; we 
think by solving our own problems, not by exercises in logic ; 
we acquire skill as we work, not by preliminary formal exer- 
cise. 
Under Dr. Sheldon’s own direction, however, the tangible 
results of the Oswego primary methods over old methods 
and practices were spectacular — at least, they so appeared 
to examining committees gathered to pass upon the prac- 
ticability of introducing them into the schools of the county. 
To these gentlemen there was undoubted interest among 
the children. They liked the new physical culture, the ex- 
cursions, and the “objects.” ‘Eyes flashed with delight, 
each little face was radiant . . . each pupil seemed thor- 
oughly awake.” Above all, they ‘‘loved” their teachers. 
But the teacher, not the child, was the active agent; he, 
without recourse to a textbook, possessed knowledge, brought  
-P-A-G-E-166
    
150 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
an infectious enthusiasm to his task, and was an expert in 
asking ‘‘developing” questions. He, at least, had become 
active; he no longer ‘‘sat” and ‘‘heard”’ lessons. It is 
true, however, that objective teaching and sense training 
degenerated in the hands of teachers who did not “clearly 
comprehend its principles.” But, though it had come by 
way of England, it perhaps never sank with us to the vicious 
formalism satirized by Charles Dickens’s Hard Times in 
the story of Mr. Grandgin, Sissy Jupe, and Bitzer.1. The 
movement gave a tremendous impetus to teacher-training 
and spread the new evangel to newly established normal 
schools in the Old Northwest and the Mississippi Valley ; 
it did, in fact, inspire their establishment. It is interesting 
that the Herbartian propaganda for scientific pedagogy 
began in the Middle-Western normal schools that had early 
come under the influence of Dr. Sheldon and his disciples. 
The Herbartian Contribution 
The Five Formal Steps, Apperception, and Interest * were 
the central ideas of Herbartian method that first came to 
America through Charles De Garmo, Charles A. McMurry, 
and his brother, Frank M. McMurry, twenty-five years 
after the Oswego method was introduced. ‘These men had 
studied the theories of Herbart as they were being inter- 
preted half a century ago by Professor Ziller of Leipzig and 
later by Professor Rein of Jena. The Oswego movement 
rose in the East, but it was the Illinois Schoolmasters’ Club, 
the Herbart Club founded in 1893 and expanded into the 
National Herbart Society for the Scientific Study of Educa- 
tion, with Dr. Charles A. McMurry as its aggressive secre- 
tary, that gave us the new doctrines of interest, apperception, 
1 Quoted in Parker’s The History of Elementary Education, p. 363. 
2 There is no desire to limit the Herbartian influence, particularly as it is 
seen in, for instance, the Colburn Arithmetics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 151 
correlation, concentration, and coérdination. The problem 
of instruction soon became the metaphysical ‘‘problem of 
reconciling knowledge and will.” But Herbartianism was 
not finally received as a system of metaphysics. ‘‘Instruc- 
tion,” according to the first yearbooks of the society, “‘in 
the studies of the public schools must be made to reveal to 
the child the moral order of the world and not only must it 
furnish this moral insight but it must so touch the heart that 
a permanent right disposition toward all men, both in their 
individual and organized capacity, may result.” “The de- 
mands of civilization took precedence over formal discipline 
as a guide to selection of studies.” The end of education 
was conceived as social-moral character. 
Moral training was to be found in completing Herbart’s 
“eycle of thought.”’ This “‘cycle”’ begins in the child’s con- 
tact with things and with people. These contacts lead to 
what the theorist believed were dynamic ideas. These ideas, 
through correct instruction, tend to express themselves in 
conduct and, if expressed or used, become clearer and lead, 
in turn, tonewideas. ‘To know the right is to do the right” 
is the implication of ‘‘the cycle.’’ The five formal steps, 
preparation, presentation, association, generalization, appli- 
cation, are, as a general method, the heritage from the late 
nineteenth century. Those of us who began our training as 
teachers as recently as 1900 were drilled as we, in turn, 
drilled our students in these important steps. 
The case was again stated for the teacher and not for the 
child. However, of the three principles of teaching stressed 
in a recent text (Parker’s General Method of Teaching in the 
Elementary School, 1919, p. 190), “‘self-activity, appercep- 
tion, and preparation,” Herbart and Ziller are responsible 
for the doctrines of apperception and preparation. In- 
struction began with the subject matter nearest the child, 
his past experience (preparation). The new knowledge
-P-A-G-E-168
    152 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
is clearly presented as a second step (presentation). The new 
knowledge and old are welded, ‘‘a veritable reconstruction 
of experience” (association). New knowledge or concept- 
making is the result without trial in action or any par- 
ticular motive on the part of the child except intellectual 
curiosity. Use was both the test of acquirement and a means 
of clinching that knowledge (application). There was no 
assurance that the child would use the result outside the 
formal exercise of the lesson. Thus we have the inductive- 
deductive lesson and the principle of use so much emphasized 
in Dr. Frank M. McMurry’s subsequent teaching. A pupil’s 
aim has since been added and the center of gravity placed in 
the child rather than in the subject. The five formal steps 
thus remain as an approved ‘“‘type” lesson when abstract 
meaning or a generalization is the objective in teaching. 
Lessons involving the solution of problems (another use of 
reflective thought), lessons for motor skills (requiring imi- 
tation primarily), and lessons for enjoyment (involving 
neither imitation nor reflective thought) are added in such 
modern handbooks for the guidance of teachers as G. D. 
Strayer’s The Teaching Process, 1911, Earhart’s Types of 
Teaching, 1914, Burton’s Supervision and Improvement of 
Teaching, 1921. 
The Herbartians misled our course of study makers for 
a generation by the false analogy known as the culture-epoch 
theory; and this influence has only recently disappeared. 
We have ceased to think that the child finds inherent in- 
terest in recapitulating, as he goes up through the grades, the 
racial struggle of man from primitive life to modern society 
just because he likes to play Indian or enjoys stories of Ab. 
We now think of interest in terms of motive and purpose 
and of subject matter as a means of satisfying ends set up 
by the child and society. But self-activity in this sense 
was not one of the principles discussed by Herbartian en-

thusiasts. This idea was contributed by Froebel, Parker, 
and Dewey. 
Self-Activity and Motor Expression 
The influence of Froebel on our American elementary 
schools, aside from the kindergarten, was first felt through 
Col. Francis W. Parker and Professor John Dewey. Froebel, 
it will be recalled, saw in the flowerlike ‘‘unfolding of the 
innate powers of the child’’a principle underlying all instruc- 
tion. The child became the active agent in the realization 
of his own powers; the teacher was the guide, not the master. 
The teacher’s first duty was to enter into the lives of his 
children. The child was not to be molded to adult stand- 
ards; he was to be allowed to grow. Coercion obstructs 
growth and learning. As Professor Duggan puts it, “‘ Froebel 
was in accord with Rousseau in believing the child a behav- 
ing not a learning animal.’ The law of unity and the law 
of self-activity were to Froebel the laws of development. 
The Froebelian method of the recitation was, therefore, 
motor expression, or doing the things the child wants to do 
by reason of his instinctive life and his interests in the ac- 
tivities of community life around him. The kindergarten 
as an institution was a first step in carrying out this ideal 
in the entire education of man. Froebel added the emphasis © 
to expression that Pestalozzi gave earlier to impression, 
hence impression and expression, learning and doing, thought 
and conduct were taken together to describe the learning 
process. Adequate expression must come through words, 
play, song, the dance, constructive work with clay, paper, 
sand, drawing, and dramatization. Freedom became mas- 
tery of self. 
In practice, however, Froebel himself led his disciples 
astray in attempting to find in his ‘‘gifts”” mystical symbols 
that reveal God and His plan to the child; while his ‘‘oc-
-P-A-G-E-170
  
154 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
cupations,” constructive work with cardboard, paper, sand, 
clay, etc., were so charged with this mysticism that in the 
hands of sentimental followers they became the means of 
expressing only “‘spiritual yearnings,” not the growing ideas 
of form or color. Even his ‘‘games,” imitations of neigh- 
borhood industrial pursuits that he had seen children enact 
while playing naturally together, were filled with so much 
religious meaning that they became highly didactic in the 
hands of conservatives. His “circle,” again a symbol of the 
law of unity, was nevertheless suggestive of the principles 
of freedom in action, of social coéperation, living and learn- 
ing together. 
With the advance in psychology and experimental edu- 
cation, American kindergartners have divided themselves 
naturally into two groups — those who follow Froebel liter- 
ally with all his vagaries and spiritual interpretations and 
those of a progressive school who with the aid of Professor 
Dewey’s more recent interpretations accept his doctrine 
of freedom, self-activity, and social communication as the 
law of growth, but reject both his science and his theology. 
Professor Patty S. Hill of Teachers College is representa- 
tive of the latter school and has made the kindergarten a 
first grade in a lower-primary group, thus articulating the 
‘ work between the old kindergarten and the public schools. 
John Dewey: Motivation and Problem Solving 
Professor John Dewey opened an experimental elemen- 
tary school at the University of Chicago in 1896 when the 
influence of Herbartian methods was at its peak. He is 
a pragmatist or one, so far as we are concerned here, who 
thinks of knowledge as dynamic, as part of one’s actual 
intellectual resources, a means of interpreting life and an 
instrument of control. The mind is ‘‘a process... a 
growing affair,” depending on exercise of its function for
-P-A-G-E-171
  
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 155 
development, ‘‘requiring continual stimulus from social 
agencies . . . and finding its nutrition in social supplies.” 
He is, moreover, a student of our experiment in de- 
mocracy and believes that the problems of our corporate 
life must be solved in the schools. To him the rapidly 
changing conditions of society and the growing complexi- 
ties of our social and industrial life demand an individual 
who is resourceful and an institution that will train that 
individual to meet the new obligations in a changing society. 
He sought, therefore, to escape the implications of current 
educational theories, especially Herbart’s, by applying a 
thoroughgoing functional viewpoint to method and matter 
in his new school. This meant that the learning of children 
must not be, as he puts it, “‘a process of accommodating 
the future to the past,” but a process of ‘‘utilizing the past 
as a resource in developing the future.’ He repudiated 
Herbartian “presentations,” based on the belief that the 
child 7s what he has been taught, as a pedagogue’s paradise. 
To view subject matter in the school from an instrumental 
or functional point of view is to'see it as so much experience 
gained by the races of man that must be learned by each 
generation of children as man himself acquired it — through 
effort in satisfying his wants, in solving his problems, and, 
in short, in gaining control over the forces of nature and of 
hisown mind. ‘Learning is an active, personally conducted 
affair . . . a process of reorganizing, improving, extending,” 
or as it is commonly said among schoolmen, “a recon- 
struction of experience.” As experience implies experi- 
ment, trying out, discovery in the face of perplexities, all 
learning takes place in attempting to remedy inadequacies 
in our past experience. The function of knowledge is “to 
make one’s experience freely available,’ when occasion/ 
demands, for use in any new situation, however strange. 
In an autocratic government where the individual plays a 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
small part in controlling the destinies of state he may con- 
form passively to custom, but in a democratic state there 
is a premium on variations, capacities, and potentialities 
which must be allowed to develop to the benefit of the nation 
and of the individual alike. Society is vitally interested 
in developing the gifts, the initiative and creative genius 
of the individual. Only a progressive education will allow 
individual freedom and at the same time socialize the indi- 
vidual as he exercises it. 
Professor Dewey, therefore, accepts the two Froebelian 
principles of method, but purges them of their fanciful reli- 
gious notions — self-activity and social participation adding 
a new emphasis. By self-activity he means ‘opportunity 
for investigation and experimentation and for trying out 
one’s ideas and things.” As the child acquires both knowl- 
edge and method of gaining knowledge through self-activity, 
so democracy originates in and is carried on by self-activity. 
“The primary business of the school is to train children 
in codperative and mutually helpful living. ... The 
primary root of all educative activity is in the instinctive 
and impulsive attitudes and activities of the child and not 
in the presentation and application of external material.” 
The growth and the well-being of the child and of society 
are conserved by the same means—a wide diffusion of 
culture throughout society and a capacity in the individual 
to think his way out of perplexing situations. 
The school must, therefore, reproduce the actual condi- 
tions of working, thinking, and feeling that exist in the 
democratic life outside the school and must give practice 
in them. The public welfare depends upon codperative, 
mutually helpful’ thinking and living together and upon 
the ability of the individual to change, meet new situations, 
and solve his problems. He early found his moral princi- 
ples in social intelligence or insight and in habits of positive
-P-A-G-E-173
    DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 157 
service. This led him to identify morality with citizen- 
ship and service, and immorality with laziness and social 
ignorance. Again, from the standpoint of method, “the 
school is not a preparation for life, but zs life.” ! All this 
has now become a familiar doctrine in our better schools. 
Professor Dewey, in 1896, attacked the Herbartian doc- 
trine of interest in a memorable paper, ‘‘ Interest in Its Rela- 
tion to Will,” before the National Herbart Society with such 
effect that the name “‘Herbart’’ was soon afterwards dropped 
from it. The concept of motivation developed from the 
controversy. The assumed opposition of interest and effort 
was rejected by Professor Dewey as a philosophical dualism. 
One of the conditions of effective learning is sustained, un- 
divided attention. Divided attention is inevitable when 
one is forced to perform tasks that are not satisfying some 
conscious need. We ‘“‘attend,” as a rule, just long enough 
to find out the attraction’s interest for us and straightway 
attend to something. else if it has no personal meaning. 
Ideals of work, and capacity for sustained effort through 
devious ways till a task is done — factors so necessary to 
individual and social well-being — are not developed by 
coercion in the learning of facts or skills which bear no rela- 
tion to purpose. Undivided attention is given freely only 
by the child who sets out to perform a task, the completion 
of which will satisfy some more or less immediate interest. 
The Spencerian theory of punishment by natural conse- 
quences is no guarantee that the child will not willingly 
take the consequences to avoid the mental and physical 
pain and the struggle involved in superimposed tasks. The 
old-fashioned artificial incentives, medals, money, credits, 
for success; copying, “being kept in,” or floggings and 
other painful penalties for failure, are actually immoral

School and Society; Child and Curriculum; How We Think.

  158 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
in their subsequent effect because they destroy interest and 
discourage initiative and effort. Interest and effort are 
correlative in the work of the world and only opposed in the 
school when its method is contrary to life, when the thing 
to be learned bears no relation to the child or to any social 
need that he can comprehend. The greater interest we 
have in the end to be gained in a given task and the 
greater desire we have for the satisfactions involved in the 
achievement, the more effort we put forth to secure these 
satisfying results. 
The word ‘‘motivation”’ is used as a factor in effort because 
it implies a purpose on the part of the child. Genuine edu- 
cative effort, as opposed to doing blindly what one is told, 
or mere energetic play must be present when the child is 
employed in the production or creation of means that satisfy 
ends that he himself conceives and wills himself to accom- 
plish — whether it be making a rabbit trap or becoming, 
in the end, a great engineer. Motivation has become the 
current mode of expressing the need of selecting materials 
to be taught in terms of their vital relation to the pupils 
to be taught — of expressing, in other words, in practice 
the idea that subject matter and method must be inter- 
related, not isolated, factors in the educative process. ‘‘The 
child’s work is motivated whenever he sees a real use in 
it—-when it satisfies some need he feels, provides some 
value he wants, supplies some control he wishes to possess. 
So long as the child comprehends more or less clearly 
the relationship between the work he is doing and the end 
sought, his work is motivated.” ! 
"How to Study as a Generalized Theory of Method 
Perhaps Professor Frank M. McMurry of Teachers Col- 
lege has had a more extensive influence on public school 
1H. B. and G. M. Wilson in The Motivation of School Work.
-P-A-G-E-175
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 159 
practice than any living leader of educational thought, for 
he has contributed both as a great teacher of method and 
as a leader in each of the great method periods, the Herbar- 
tian and the functional. He was a pioneer of the American 
school of Herbart, a ready debater and interpreter of “‘ap- 
perception,” ‘‘application” (use), ‘‘correlation,” ‘“concen- 
tration,’’ when they were meeting with vigorous opposition 
in the National Society gatherings. In 1892-96, particularly, 
he appeared repeatedly on the program of the National Edu- 
cation Association, as well as of the Herbart Club, in defense 
of them. His Method of the Recitation, 1903, written with 
his brother Charles, was widely used in education classes 
everywhere; while his special method studies, especially 
his recent work in geography, are notable contributions. 
But his name is most generally associated a8 a contemporary 
in thought with that of Professor Dewey with his own formu- 
lation of the principles of study methods from a functional 
point of view, as found in How to Study and Teaching How 
to Study, 1907, with his numerous treatments of effective 
study methods which follow this book, and with his work at 
Columbia University. 
In this how-to-study emphasis he sees the fundamental 
principles of method applied. ‘‘How shall one learn alone?”’ 
is a more important question than ‘‘What shall I teach to- 
day?” Study or learning to work alone comes in ‘“‘the 
vigorous application of the mind to a subject for the satis- 
faction of a felt need. . . . Instead of being aimless, every 
portion of effort put forth is an organic step toward the 
accomplishment of a specific purpose. Instead of being 
passive, it requires the reaction of the self upon the ideas 
presented until they are supplemented, organized, and ten- 
tatively judged so that they are held well in memory. The 
study of a subject has not reached its end till the guiding 
purpose has been accomplished and the knowledge has been
-P-A-G-E-176
    160 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
so assimilated that it has been used in a normal way and has 
become experience . .. until precautions for the preser- 
vations of individuality have been included” (p. 288). 
The factors of study methods are (1) specific purposes; 
(2) need of supplementing thought; (8) organization of 
ideas; (4) weighing values; (5) memorizing; (6) appli- 
cation of ideas; (7) a tentative attitude toward truth; 
(8) self-activity, self-control, self-expression, independence. 
In 1904, in What Omissions Are Advisable in the Course of 
Study (National Education Association — Proceedings, 1904, 
pp. 194 ff.), a new answer to Spencer’s earlier question, 
“What knowledge is of most worth?’’! is to be found in 
his four ‘‘propositions for the rejection of useless knowl- 
edge”’: 
(1) It must be related to the needs of life in a broad sense. 
(2) It must be within the comprehension of the child. 
(3) It must appeal to interest. 
(4) Details, facts, must be taught in relation to wholes. 
These epitomized the current progressive theory of method 
and of subject-matter values. It should also be added that 
his well-known criticism of the New York City’s teaching 
methods and courses of study from the standpoint of chil- 
dren’s motives, values, and initiatives, has become a valuable 
handbook in improving practice in the light of our best 
thought.” 
Remaking Our Courses of Study 
Professor Dewey has had many interpreters. Those who 
best reflect in practice his spirit and theory of method he 
has described in Schools of Tomorrow (1915). They need 
not, therefore, be discussed here. 
Among the first to apply the functional view to methods 
of teaching was Professor W. W. Charters, whose Methods of 
1See Herbert Spencer’s Theory of Relative Values. 
2 See McMurry’s Elementary School Standards, 1913.  
-P-A-G-E-177
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 161 
Teaching Developed from a Functional View-Point, was pub- 
lished in 1909, and later, in 1913, popularized as Teaching 
the Common Branches. There were many who attacked 
the problem of making the curriculum conform to this point 
of view — attempting to reorganize school knowledge so as 
to make it less ‘‘foreign’”’ to a normal child’s interest. ‘If 
we seek the kingdom of heaven educationally,” as Professor 
Dewey puts it, or if we ‘‘identify ourselves with real in- 
stincts and needs of childhood and ask only their fullest 
assertion and growth . . . all other things will be added 
unto us.’ From the standpoint of method, this means that 
the more closely related the curriculum is to these funda- 
mental interests, the less need there will be for a conscious 
technique. Dr. F. G. Bonser, in his proposal for courses 
centered in the industrial arts, may be regarded as the fore- 
most student — with Dr. J. F. Bobbitt of the University 
of Chicago, perhaps — of curriculum making. 
Among the practical efforts to reorganize the curriculum, 
The Farmville, Virginia, Training School Course of Study, 
finally printed in 1914, and Guides to its formulation, de- 
serve notice. This is a product of faculty codperation 
under the leadership of Dr. C. W. Stone, now of Washington 
State College. The present writer was associated in this 
attempt to incorporate current theory in practice. Pro- 
fessor Dewey’s definition of education as reconstruction or 
cultivation of the child’s experience led Dr. Stone and his 
co-workers to use three stages in learning: First, motivation 
or establishing the pupil’s aim — the teacher enabling the 
pupil to discover inadequacies in his past experience and 
seeking to arouse consciousness of need for improving it. 
Second, meeting the need —the teacher supplying the

tion.

sources in material and suggesting the appropriate procedure 
for information, problem attack, drill, enjoying, etc. Third, 
merged with the second step, using the newly acquired fact 
or skill. 
On the side of subject matter ‘‘centers of interest,” pro- 
viding motive as it operates in each stage of childhood, were 
sought. Around these “centers” curriculum materials 
of social value, including the Bible, were selected and or- 
ganized. These basal and persisting interests were found 
to be (1) play experience, (2) special days and celebrations, 
(3) seasonal changes, (4) school needs, (5) story life. The 
centers of grade-age interest began with ‘‘Home Life” and, 
in a logical expansion, ended in grade VII with ‘‘Growth 
of the State and the Nation.” 
Professor Charters, in his Methods of Teaching, traces 
the history of such schemes to fill the gap between method 
and matter from “‘psychologizing,” correlation and con- 
centration, core subjects to the use of central interests. 
Col. F. W. Parker used the physical sciences — geography, 
especially — as centers. Miss Katherine Dopp’s plan, follow- 
ing Dewey closely, finds interests “in conversation or com- 
munication, in inquiry, or finding out things, or construc- 
tion, and in artistic expression” in the industries. Miss 
Harriet M. Scott’s plan is a modification of the culture- 
epoch interests. Professor Horn at the University of 
Missouri in 1908 used a school subject — History. Pro- 
fessor Bonser more recently finds his centers in industrial 
arts projects and believes they furnish ample motive for 
drill, enjoyment, and useful knowledge.!. Mrs. Lois Coffey 
Mossman, Miss Alice Krackowizer, Miss Margaret E. Wells, 
and a number of others of his students have more recently 
worked out practical project programs. Professor J. L.

gives four activities: observation, play, stories, and hand- 
work. 
The New Psychology 
The work of Professors J. McKeen Cattell of Columbia 
University, E. L. Thorndike of Teachers College and 
C. H. Judd of the University of Chicago, and that of their 
associates and students have made possible in the last 
decade a scientific reévaluation of our heritage of theory from 
Comenius to Dewey. Professor Thorndike is, perhaps, 
more responsible than anyone for the growing use of statis- 
tical method in dealing with the problems of both school 
materials and classroom technique. He published his Con- 
tributions to Mental and Social Measurement in 1904. Sub- 
sequently he published Principles of Teaching, 1916, and 
three volumes of Hducational Psychology, 1913-14, con- 
taining studies in the original nature of man, in individual 
differences, instincts and capacities, laws of learning and in the 
factors and conditions involved in improving them. These 
studies have directed the current of our discussion of method 
into new channels; the problems of educators have since 
been attacked from an entirely new angle. ‘‘Child-study,” so 
enthusiastically pursued by “‘neighborhood clubs” of thirty 
years ago or more, has become a more or less exact body 
of fact subject to constant verification through laboratory 
methods common to other sciences. A science of educa- 
tion may be said to have had its beginnings in this genera- 
tion. Under the direction of Professor Thorndike, Dr. C. 
W. Stone made the first elaborate investigation of school 
achievements and reasoning in Arithmetical Abilities, 1908. 
Since that time have come numerous investigations of school 
subjects, learning and practice curves, mental fatigue, etc. ° 
8. A. Courtis’s Arithmetic Tests, the Ayres Spelling Scales, 
the Hillegas Scale in Composition, and several Silent Reading
-P-A-G-E-180
  164 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Tests are examples of what has come in the attempt to meas- 
ure the quantitative results in both skills and content sub- 
jects. 
These tests and scales have revealed wide variations in 
ability, the causes of success and failure among children, 
and the apparent need for as many specific methods in teach- 
ing as there are subjects and parts of subjects to be learned 
or made over into habits. There are differences in capacities 
and differences in temperaments. There are rapid learners 
_ and slow learners, and there are those who by reason of genius 
or subnormality are not subjects for ordinary methods at all. 
Perhaps the most significant movement in education that has 
yet arisen is this attempt to know the facts about how we 
learn, think, and feel and to base a pedagogy upon them. 
An illustration of this development is seen in such new titles 
of educational courses as ‘‘ Diagnostic Measuring and Reme- 
dial Teaching,” offered in one of our Schools of Education. 
The movement is, perhaps, the most encouraging evidence 
to scientists in other fields that education is itself a science 
and in the near future will base its procedure on rational 
grounds, on facts discovered, verified under control, and 
continually refined in practice. They see the end of faddist 
and ephemeral theories which last long enough to spoil at 
least a generation of ‘“‘handwriters” or ‘‘thinkers.” 
A new pedagogy of the elementary school subjects has 
appeared to augment the more general laws of learning, and 
its emphasis is, of course, on special methods or techniques 
appropriate to the nature of the specific subject or difficulty. 
A number of excellent ‘“‘special method” textbooks have 
recently appeared: Thorndike’s Arithmetic, Smith’s The 
Reading Process, Horn and Ashbaugh’s Spelling Book. Im- 
portant studies of Gray, Freeman, Judd, and many others 
to be found in the Supplementary Educational Monographs 
of the University of Chicago, and the recent publications
-P-A-G-E-181
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 165 
of the National Society for the Study of Education, espe- 
cially its Highteenth and Twentieth Yearbooks, reflect this trend. 
The first fruits of the Institute for Educational Research, 
established at Teachers College, Columbia University, under 
the direction of Professor Thorndike, to conduct investiga- 
tions in the field of economy of learning are appearing in our 
journals and even in our newspapers. 
Can There Be a Concept of General Method? 
The countless investigations of the abilities of children 
and their difficulties in learning, and the alleged low-test 
scores in the drill subjects in some schools where ‘‘incidental 
learning’’ is the rule, have led some schoolmen to believe 
that ‘‘there is no hidden unified principle lying back of all 
method.” At the same time a great enthusiasm is being 
shown for what is spoken of as the project method, project- 
problem method, or project teaching. 
Project Teaching — A Method or an Attitude? 
With our new knowledge of human behavior and the 
development of modern psychology and its attack on 
unverified theory there have arisen two sets of method 
problems — those rising out of the work of such men as 
Thorndike, Judd, Freeman, and Gray, and those raised by the 
followers of Dewey, McMurry, and Kilpatrick, who believe 
that a consciousness of need, purpose, and motive underlies 
procedure in all the varied activities of children in learning, 
and, therefore, supplies a general method. Both groups 
of investigators rest their case on the laws and conditions 
of learning. In reality there is no conflict. In fact, two 
important aspects are being opposed. The future of good 
teaching seems to depend upon a unification of the contri- 
butions made by these groups.
-P-A-G-E-182
  166 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Professor Horn of the University of Iowa, himself an ex- 
perimental student of method, believes that method depends 
essentially on the subject matter in a particular subject, 
that general method is a philosophical fantasy. He has said 
in a personal letter : 
It is my judgment that in the last ten years great advances in edu- 
cational method have been made along the line of developing superior 
techniques of learning for each of the prominent subjects. We now know 
how to teach spelling and writing as accurately as physicians know the 
diagnosis and treatment of most of their diseases. We are making great 
strides in the improvement of reading. There has also been some improve- 
ment in our methods of teaching other prominent elementary school sub- 
jects. Most of these improvements can be ascribed to the application of 
scientific method, to the making of the course of study, to the determina- 
tion of economic methods, and to the discovery of the proper tests. As 
a result of these experimentations, we have made real strides in spite of 
the confusion created by those who are pushing the project method, and 
in spite of the inadequacy of this method. It is my judgment that any 
move in the direction of the establishment of a general method is neces- 
sarily fallacious. The way to learn to spell a word is not the way to learn 
to play on the piano. Even the motivation is not the same in any but 
a rhetorical sense of the word. 
On the other hand, Professor William H. Kilpatrick of 
Teachers College is finding a place for a new ideal of method 
and has identified his name with a studied definition of 
project teaching. He acknowledges his indebtedness for his 
scientific or philosophical position to both Thorndike and 
Dewey, and has, through his classroom chiefly, aroused 
enthusiasm for a new conception of general method. 
Distinction is made between “narrow” methods and a 
“wider” or general method. By “narrow” he means meth- 
ods or devices necessary to teach special or parts of special 
subjects, acknowledging the rapid development in scientific 
measurements. In defining the ‘“‘wider”’ method, he makes 
his fundamental contribution to educational thought. To 
him an act of learning is always a complex affair; one never 
learns one thing alone at a time. We may learn long divi- 
sion, to read, or to make a box or dress, but at the same time  
-P-A-G-E-183
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 167 
we do acquire a number of things, not necessary to profi- 
ciency or performance but associated with it, that the teacher 
does not count in as results. Then, too, not only a new 
body of associated knowledge and permanent interests may 
be there to determine the quality of our learning — but 
ideals and attitudes are also built up that will determine 
whether the thing we are doing or acquiring will ‘lead on” 
to other like activities or cease when the lesson is over. 
He justifies his use of ‘‘wider’’ in describing method on 
the ground that it takes into fuller account what any type 
of instruction actually does for the child and for so- 
ciety. 
There are, then, three aspects in any act of learning: 
(1) the primary objective — getting the particular fact or the 
skill required by the course of study; (2) associate sugges- 
tions — accessory ideas from collateral fields of knowledge 
which may be placed at the disposal of the child as a result 
of vital contacts in the learning, numerous associations of 
ideas that may “lead on” to later fruitful activities and 
create abiding interests in these fields; (3) concomitants 
or certain emotional reactions, the disgusts or enthusiasms 
that come with satisfying or annoying experiences or tasks, 
affective states which may determine one’s future progress 
in learning, one’s ideals and attitudes, one’s very char- 
acter. 
To Professor Kilpatrick to ‘‘learn”’ a lesson and be through 
with it is one thing; to ‘‘love” the subject as a result of — 
the learning and to desire to learn outside the class when 
coercion is withheld is quite another. Society is concerned 
with our attitudes and ideals, our permanent, dynamic 
interests, our habits of work and thought, quite as much 
as it is with the results of primary learning. Tests and 
scales so far have attempted to measure only the results 
of this primary learning, but the “‘simultaneous”’ learnings
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
incident to drill or recitation are at least as important as 
the habit formation in the three R’s. If the former are 
difficult to chart and control, there is no reason why in our 
effort to be practical we should not attempt to control them 
by method and a careful administration and use of tests. 
But a great danger in this very testing movement is that 
teachers will select methods that may bring satisfactory 
results in primary learning and defeat the purposes of demo- 
cratic society in not guaranteeing these wider “social 
outcomes.’’ Another danger in the overemphasis of tests, 
Professor Kilpatrick points out, lies in the fact that we do 
not learn in life by any such simple method as scales imply 
nor are we tested for proficiency in any such practical way. 
He, however, sees no conflict in the right diagnosis of chil- 
dren’s abilities and difficulties and a method or methods 
that will take in the whole act of learning. Again, this 
theory of ‘‘simultaneous”’ learnings is Professor Kilpatrick’s 
chief contribution to method and he means something far 
more comprehensive, as we have seen, than ‘‘intuitive” or 
incidental learning described by earlier theorists. It is 
the control of these very ‘‘attendant”’ learnings that de- 
termines moral instruction and training for citizenship. 
Students of Professor Kilpatrick are familiar with his 
use of the laws and conditions of efficient learning as laid 
down by Thorndike,! and the latter’s definition of learning 
as ‘‘acquiring new bonds or changing old bonds” in our 
nervous system. These new laws are: 
I. Readiness, or the degree of strength of our desire 
to respond to a demand for action, depending upon our 
interest, physical state, and preoccupation. Good teach- 
ing requires that a child must be ready for response with a 
mind ‘‘set”’ to achieve his purpose, hence motive and the 
correlative place of interest and effort. 
1See Educational Psychology, Vol. III, pp. 327-452.
-P-A-G-E-185
    DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 169 
Il. Exercise: Use and Disuse, or the old ‘‘ever learn 
to do by doing,’ vice versa (7.e., habit is determined by ex- 
ercise or broken by the lack of it), stated in terms of nerve 
structure or bond connections. 
Ill. Effect: Satisfaction and Annoyance — Success and 
Failure: We learn best that which gives satisfaction or 
pleasure; annoyance weakens learning or connections be- 
tween the neurones. We remember a fact when given as a 
successful answer to a question; we tend to forget it when 
as a wrong answer the ‘‘effect”’ is unpleasurable. 
It follows that the conditions of learning are found best 
when children are engaged wholeheartedly in work they 
want to do (ready for it), and have definite purpose in com- 
pleting (mind-set), and which satisfies a need in achieving 
that purpose (effort with success). Without purpose the 
child must be coerced to action with consequent loss in time 
and effort through divided attention, with loss in “‘associate 
suggestions”’ and a probable unwelcome gain in hatred for 
all that has to do with the unpleasant task, subject, teacher, 
and school. 
The Project as a Fundamental Concept of Method 
The project attitude is a natural outcome of these laws 
and our discussion of interests, motivation, and problem 
method. No one recognizes it as a discovery; but only 
the enthusiast thinks this new word an open sesame to suc- 
cessful application of all our highest ideals of method. No 
matter how near it is to the common practice of our schools 
of to-morrow, it is recognized that successful project teaching 
to-day demands extraordinary ability on the part of the 
teacher and taxes his resources to the utmost. It is very 
much easier to teach in “‘the old-fashioned way” when ex- 
aminations on subject matter or even efficiency tests are 
the proofs of effective instruction. Project teaching when

it leaves concrete, practical subjects like agriculture or home 
economics, and is extended to ‘‘content’’ subjects, is diffi- 
cult and at times impossible. When it is clearly impracti- 
cable to teach certain information and habits demanded 
by the assigned course of study, the project idea should give 
way to well-motivated recitation and drill, the ideal of yester- 
day. But much that appears as ‘‘impossible” may be ac- 
complished when, with renewed attack on the organization 
of the curriculum, we establish ‘‘centers of interests’ or 
“life topics” by which we may guide and test our results. 
All teachers are inspired by stories of boys and girls reclaimed 
by a life-motive project. A boy of fourteen in a one-room 
school in Virginia is recalled, who had taken seven years 
to reach the fourth grade. He was learning nothing, the 
teacher insisted, and was too inert to leave school 
and follow his father into the cornfield. But the corn-club 
idea aroused him. He was given a quarter-acre on his 
father’s farm and told that according to the rules of the 
club contest he must do all the work — he must measure, com- 
pute, keep books, select and buy his own seed and fertilizer, 
make frequent reports to his superintendent and to the state 
and national departments of agriculture. The boy came to 
see the relation of school and social need, that arithmetic 
had social utility and was closely related to his purposes. 
To get information it was necessary to read; to be under- 
stood, to compose and write accurately. As a result of that 
contest he later graduated from an agricultural high school 
and finally went to the state college. That corn club, we 
recall, supplied a project involving half of the course of 
study and a motive that carried him into scientific farming. 
As a semester project it contained all the spirit and charac- 
ter of those proposed fifteen years after. It is easy to grasp 
the vision of the ‘‘new” education if we keep in mind all 
the primary and attendant learnings this country boy ac-
-P-A-G-E-187
DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 171 
quired. No artificial motivation was necessary for purpose 
and the high motive was there. 
By projects here is meant “ purposeful activities” initiated 
by the children under the guidance of a teacher for the accom- 
plishing of ends immediately satisfying to them and funda- 
mentally valuable to society. It is an idea of the way to go 
about learning, whatever the subject matter or aim of the 
lesson. No rigid procedure or technique such as in the 
Herbartian steps is suggested by the more responsible 
advocates of the method. All that is demanded. is the 
presence of purpose, purposeful effort, the setting up of 
and achievement of ends by the children and, as far as the 
teacher is concerned, a careful arrangement of the subject 
matter involved and intelligent guidance. To resolve it 
into a method is to formalize it. With the editor of the 
new Journal of Educational Method it is perhaps wise to 
think that the project is not a method at all, but “a syn- 
thesis of current educational ideas and a focus for the origi- 
nal contributions of Dewey, Thorndike, Kilpatrick, and 
others to the problem of codperative learning, thinking, 
and living.’”’ Professor Hosic in this connection believes 
that ‘‘so central an idea of method” has not occurred to 
American educators since Herbart. The formal steps were 
just steps in a procedure that glorified the teacher at the 
expense of the pupil, but this “‘is a philosophy at once of 
life and learning as well as of teaching, capable of infinite 
variety of applications and rather the basis for a technique 
than technique itself.” 
It is with this implication that Professor Kilpatrick cham- 
pions the project concept. He thinks any ‘‘unit of pur- 
poseful experience, any instance of purposeful activity where 
dominating purpose, as an inner urge, (1) fixes the aim (or 
end) of the action, (2) guides its process, (3) furnishes its 
‘drive,’ its inner motivation for its vigorous prosecution,”
-P-A-G-E-188
  
  172 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
is a project. Four types of projects are provided: those 
involving the achieving of ideas, those involving appre- 
ciation or enjoying, those involving problem solving, and 
those involving knowledge or skills and requiring practice 
or drill. These projects or methods of the child’s attack 
upon his own problems are effective means of acquiring 
rich ‘‘content,’’ and the three R’s as well. Though it sug- 
gests nature’s way, and therefore permits the teacher little 
activity in the lesson itself, we know that nature’s method 
will not lead the child unaided to as rich experiences as mod- 
ern life demands. The teacher remains, not on her throne 
where she may put the fear of God into the child’s soul, 
but as a final social arbiter and manipulator —to a pur- 
pose —of method and matter. The laissez-faire or do- 
as-you-please school, however, is as out of harmony with 
our best thought as is the lockstep. No one proposes that 
children be allowed to do as they like, to make their own 
decisions without counting the cost and paying the bill. 
“Cumulative progress,” from generation to generation, Pro- 
fessor Kilpatrick reminds us, ‘‘will not be possible with- 
out the mediation of adults in the learning process,” 
but ‘“‘the sure inheritance of this race experience tends 
to be ruled out where the child’s experience finds no 
place.” As effort and interest are correlative in nature, 
so there is no natural isolation of school materials and 
school method. 
Limitations and Defects of Projects by Overemphasis of 
Purpose and Function 
Professor William C. Bagley has in times past questioned 
the validity of much of the philosophy associated with Pro- 
fessor Dewey’s name. He sees dangers in carrying projects 
too far. He accepts ‘‘the economy of purposeful learning
-P-A-G-E-189
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 173 
without further test and experiment,” but, ‘‘recognizing 
the dynamic effect of a strongly felt desire in releasing the 
energy essential to learning,” he “doubts the wisdom of the 
tenet that all learning should take its cue from purpose.” 
Consciousness of purpose is of late development, biologi- 
cally, he feels, ripening late in the life of the individual. 
The child must depend on the adult for control and guidance 
and we must know when we can safely substitute his pur- 
poses for the adult’s. Purposes are effective as far as they 
may be used and hence the limitations of the project method 
are in the limitations of purposes themselves. After all, 
the imposition of adult purposes has, as a matter of fact, 
been one of the most important factors in human evolution. 
On psychological grounds, he believes that information 
gained incidental to problem solving is not so easily retained 
or recalled as that mastered for the sake of its own mastery, 
i.e., through drill, or study for the sake of its results in knowl- 
edge and skill. 
Still further, he questions the chances of ‘‘transfer’’ unless 
“we lift procedures and principles out of the matrix of appli- 
cation and their relation to specific and immediate purposes”’ 
and drill for proficiency upon them alone. He believes 
that the functional or instrumental value of knowledge 
applied alone as a basis of method will prevent the child, 
engaged only in his own necessarily narrow pursuits, from 
getting ‘the full heritage of skill, knowledge, standards, 
ideals, that represent the gains the race has made.” Race 
experience or selected subject matter furnishes ‘‘the founda- 
tion, background, perspective, point of view, attitudes. . . . 
These are likely to defy analysis and to escape the scrutiny 
of one who is looking only for direct and visible applica- 
tion.” Projects should, therefore, never be depended upon 
alone. Organized and systematic treatment of the same 
material should follow it, especially in the subjects, history
-P-A-G-E-190
  174 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and literature, ‘where the interpretative and inspirational 
are greater than the instrumental.” ! 
Professor F. G. Bonser, an early disciple of Dewey at 
Teachers College, sees no reason why the project should 
be limited to merely practical or constructive activities 
alone, but thinks it should include “important, purposeful 
intellectual inquiries and appreciative experiences.”” Good 
teaching and a right application of the project idea implies 
a full recognition of the wealth of spiritual inheritances 
available to the child. ‘‘To interest children only in the 
immediately stimulating and obvious is little short of crimi- 
nal,” as project teaching is “‘an attempt at socialization.” 
There is danger of overemphasis of individual projects. 
There should be much sharing in each other’s purposes and 
problems as it offers the best means of developing codpera- 
tive interests and capacities and weeding out selfishness, 
unwholesome egotism, and interests of narrow range. 
Professor Ernest Horn in an article in The Hducation 
Review, January, 1922, allies himself with those who see 
the project method as an obstacle to the growth of scientific 
investigation for more adequate special techniques. He 
views method only as it may be used to reach tangible ob- 
jectives of the public schools. He is willing to go back to 
the shop, kitchen, and farm projects, whence came the name, 
but objects to the term as including all learning. The older 
practical projects were directly organized around activities 
outside the school and efficiency in performance was sought 
and easily measured and their “‘transfer’’ value determined. 
He would, with Professor Charters, limit the definition of 
“project” in project-teaching literature by adding the phrase 
1Tn this connection, it may be well to examine the claims made for project 
teaching involving “The Essential Success of Historical Movements” by R. W. 
Hatch of the Horace Mann School. See Teachers College Record, 1918; His- 
torical Outlook, February, 1922.  
-P-A-G-E-191
  DEVELOPMENT OF METHOD 175 
“carried to completion in its natural setting.” The fine 
arts, literature, must be taught by techniques peculiar to 
them. The mechanical or drill subjects cannot be taught 
effectively by the “‘problem attack.” He is greatly afraid 
that teachers will be led to base methods on transitory in- 
terests. ‘‘For no theory of interest can be accepted that 
does not include as a part of it a feeling of social obligation.” 
The influence of the project in teaching has been wide- 
spread. It has, no doubt, been made to answer the craving 
for panacea and may cause “‘soft-mannered”’ schools to 
rise. But it is an impressive fact that teachers in many 
places are whole-heartedly at work making inventory of 
children’s purposes and filling journals of experiences which 
will make possible the extension of this idea into new fields 
of subject matter. A National Conference on Educational 
Method was organized in 1917 and in September, 1921, the 
first number of The Journal of Educational Method under 
the editorship of Professor James F. Hosic appeared. A 
notable series of articles by Professor Kilpatrick on the 
principles underlying effective project teaching, articles 
and summaries by the editor, reports on classroom experi- 
ments and trials, make this journal the authorized source 
of information on the development of this new approach. 
The first considered treatment of the project method in 
textbook form, however, is M. E. Branom’s The Project 
Method in Education, 1919; Professors Stevenson and 
Stockton and Miss Wells have more recently contributed 
others. Among special-subject textbooks that are based on 
the project attack are S. A. Leonard’s Teaching English 
_ Composition in the Grades, Miller’s Practical English Composi- 
tion, Guitteau’s Preparing for Citizenship, Van Buskirk and 
Smith’s The Science of Everyday Life, Hoyt and Peet’s Every- 
day Arithmetic, and Bolenius’s Boys’ and Girls’ Readers. 
There is also a growing number of textbooks on special

method that are largely influenced by this trend in current 
thought.

A Résumé 
Twenty-five years ago Professor Monroe and the writer 
both began work as university professors of education, — the 
former at Teachers College as professor of the history of 
education, and the latter at Stanford University as acting- 
head of a small two-man and wholly undergraduate depart- 
ment of education and in charge of the courses in both the 
history and the administration of education. In the insti- 
tutions in which we began our university work we have 
remained during the quarter-century that has passed. 
Though the time seems short, as one looks back over it now, 
it has nevertheless been a great creative period in all lines of 
educational work, and both the work and the institutions 
with which we early threw in our lot have expanded greatly 
as the years have rolled by. During the twenty-five years 
that measure our respective university services the minor 
subject, pedagogy, based largely on the recollections and the 
past practical experiences of a few successful teachers, has 
been transformed into the new and rapidly expanding profes- 
sional subject, education, taught in specially organized 
schools, and based on scientific methods of work and a 
scientific organization of established principles. The subject 
was still in the successful-practitioner stage of its develop- 
ment when we began work; it has now evolved, as did 
medicine and law and engineering before it, into the scien- 
tifically organized and taught stage. 
When we began our work we each faced situations in 
179
-P-A-G-E-196
  180 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
which we had practically no tools with which to work, and 
during the quarter-century of our service we have both been 
busy creating the tools which we and others with us are to 
use. In the history of education the only textbooks avail- 
able, in 1898, were Painter’s A History of Education, a little 
volume of 325 pages, published in 1886; Williams’s The 
History of Modern Education, a volume of 444 pages, pub- 
lished in 1892; and Compayré’s History of Pedagogy, a 
volume of 570 pages, first published in English translation in 
1886. The first two of these were histories of educational 
theory, and were based largely on material published earlier 
by the German, Von Raumer, and translated into English by 
Barnard ; while the third, though more a history of practice 
than the other two, had been written with the needs of 
French teachers in mind and gave undue emphasis to the 
history of educational development in France. While 
Compayré’s text was the most usable of the three, all were 
so markedly inferior to the very able and very scholarly 
Text-Book in the History of Education (759 pages), produced 
by Professor Monroe, in 1905, that they seem to us of to-day 
to have been but crude and rudimentary tools with which 
to try to work. 
Through his students, too, Professor Monroe has con- 
tributed, during the quarter-century of his work as a teacher, 
a long list of scholarly researches in the history of education 
which have not only added much to our knowledge of the 
subject, but have also contributed materially to the effective- 
ness of the instruction of other teachers of the subject. Ina 
published list of Doctor of Philosophy degrees granted at 
Teachers College, from 1899 to 1921, the theses for forty-six 
of the one hundred and ninety-one degrees have been in the 
field represented by the work of Professor Monroe. The 
writer’s Syllabus of Lectures on the History of Education 
(1902), while not included in the list, was, however, in part
-P-A-G-E-197

worked out while a student at Teachers College in 1901-02, 
and owed something of its value to the teaching of Monroe. 
The Literature of School Administration 
It is, however, with the developments in the field of school 
administration during the quarter-century under review that 
this chapter is concerned. In this field, as in the history of 
education, there were almost no tools with which to work at 
the beginning of the period. If anything, there were fewer 
tools than in the other subject. There was no text of any 
value for use with college students. Payne, of the University 
of Michigan, had published, in 1875, a little book of 207 pages, 
which he called School Supervision, and in which he had dealt 
in a very general way with the superintendent’s powers, the 
grading of schools, and records and reports; and Pickard, 
then at the University of Iowa, had in 1890 ‘“‘summarized 
the experience of twenty years as a teacher and school 
superintendent” in a little volume of 148 pages, which he 
called School Supervision, and in which he had dealt with the 
superintendency in general and, more specifically, with the 
city superintendent in his various official and public rela- 
tionships. Both these books were of the personal experience 
and opinion type, and neither of them gave any comprehen- 
sive view of the field of school administration, nor did they 
try to formulate in principles what ought to be done and why. 
The first document to lay down principles of action and to 
treat, somewhat broadly, the field of city school administra- 
tion, appeared in 1899, as the Report of the Educational Com- 
mission of the City of Chicago, a commission appointed the 
preceding year by Mayor Harrison to formulate some prin- 
ciples for the organization and management of the schools 
of Chicago. The secretary of this commission, Professor 
George F. James, was largely responsible for the character of 
the report. As this appeared as a public document and was
-P-A-G-E-198
  
182 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
printed at first in small quantities and for local use only, it 
was little used by teachers of administration until some years 
later, when a reprint for the use of students was issued by the 
University of Chicago Press. This document, while dealing 
specifically with the work and problems of a single large 
city school system, nevertheless did formulate fundamental 
principles in a way that made it for a decade a very useful 
teaching volume. 
In 1904 appeared Chancellor’s Our Schools: Their Ad- 
ministration and Supervision (426 pages), and in 1908 the 
same author published a supplemental volume under the 
title of Our Schools: Their Direction and Management (333 
pages). These two volumes, taken together, represent our 
first attempt to formulate, in textbook form, the subject 
matter of a course in public school administration, and they 
found extensive teaching use until displaced by the much 
better organized textbook (Administration of Public Educa- 
tion in the United States) by Dutton and Snedden, published 
in 1908. Both of the Chancellor books contained much 
concrete illustrative material, based on actual experiences, 
and both were somewhat less of the reminiscent and some- 
what more of the organization type than any books that had 
before appeared. The Chicago Report, the two books by 
Chancellor, and the increasing use of the annual reports and 
courses of study issued by city superintendents of schools, 
and the rules and regulations printed by city boards of 
education, all alike tended to provide new instructional 
material and to give organization to the courses in public 
school administration being offered in our American colleges 
and universities. 
The courses in school administration offered for the first 
ten years of the period under discussion continued, however, 
to be largely a summary of the concrete practical experience 
of some former successful school superintendent, now turned  
-P-A-G-E-199
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 183 
teacher in some newly established college chair or depart- 
ment of education. The work of Payne and Hinsdale at 
Michigan, of Pickard at Iowa, of Boone at Indiana, and of 
Dutton at Teachers College form good examples of such 
practical-experience and reminiscent type of instruction; 
while the following descriptions of the courses in school 
administration, as offered at that time in one of our American 
universities, are perhaps typical of much of the early in- 
struction offered : 
1. The Organization and Supervision of Schools. Lectures and assigned 
readings, embracing the organization and supervision of schools in towns 
and cities; the relation of these school systems to the State; elementary 
schools ; high schools and polytechnic schools; the arrangement of courses 
of study; plans for grading and promotion ; inspection and management ; 
employment and dismissal of teachers; duties of principals and super- 
intendent, and their relations to the public and to intellectual and moral 
training; disciplinary problems; agencies for helping teachers; the school 
board and its problems; business management; defects to be remedied ; 
and problems to be solved. 
2. Seminary in the Study of School Systems. A study of present con- 
ditions and tendencies, based on the study of school reports, as these 
relate to enrollment and attendance, comparative expenditure and cost, 
public and private schools, city and rural schools, secondary and higher 
education, normal schools, and similar topics. 
The work in school administration, as in other divisions 
of the subject of education, and as in other new subjects of 
instruction, had to pass through a formative period. The 
decade from 1898 to 1908 covers the important part of this 
period. When it is remembered that the first permanent 
chair of education was established as late as 1873 (Iowa), and 
that when Stanford University opened in 1891, the depart- 
ment of education created there was the tenth such chair or 
department established in this country, the reason for the 
early formative period’s extending over into the first decade 
of the present century will be better understood. 
At the time Professor Monroe began his work at Teachers 
College in 1898, there were perhaps not more than fifty or
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  184 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
sixty institutions in the whole United States that had or- 
ganized chairs or departments in this new subject, and the 
instruction then offered by them was quite elementary in 
nature and almost entirely undergraduate in character. 
Even Teachers College was then but a small, undergraduate 
institution. To fill these new chairs it was necessary to draw 
as professors men from among the most successful practi- 
tioners of the time, and these almost of necessity were the 
older superintendents in our city school systems. Only in a 
very few instances were young men— as in the case of 
Professor Monroe himself — who after some teaching experi- 
ence had obtained the doctorate in history, or psychology, 
or some similar subject, selected for the new professorships 
in education and put to work to see what they could find out 
and could do. To-day the approximately four hundred and 
fifty American institutions of higher learning and a rapidly 
growing number of state teachers’ colleges offering instruction 
in education bear witness to the rapid development and 
organization and expansion of the subject of education, which 
has taken place during the last twenty-five years. Many 
of these institutions, following the model set by Teachers 
College when it affiliated with Columbia University in 1890, 
have recently reorganized their work in education into 
teachers’ colleges or schools of education, to enable them to 
care properly for the work in the various phases and divisions 
of this rapidly developing new subject. 
Professional Study of Administration 
About 1904 we note the beginnings of a change from the 
successful-practitioner type of generalized administrative 
courses toward a more scientifically organized type of 
instruction, and also the beginnings of a specialization in 
the work of instruction in school administration. Of this 
specialization, the separation of state and county school
-P-A-G-E-201
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 185 
administration from city school administration, and the 
application of statistical procedure to the study of educa- 
tional problems, are perhaps the most important of the new 
developments of that period. 
In 1903 the writer expanded his course in school adminis- 
tration from a semester to a year, and devoted the first 
semester to a study of problems of state and county educa- 
tional organization, and the second semester to strictly city 
problems. While some reference to state organization had 
commonly been included in the earlier general courses, this 
is the first definite organization, as far as the writer is aware, 
of a separate course on the problems of state school organiza- 
tion and administration. Elliott began a similar differen- 
tiation at Wisconsin in 1905, and Strayer, soon afterward, at 
Teachers College. 
In 1906 the writer published his School Funds and Their 
Apportionment and his Certification of Teachers, both being 
studies which attempted to create teaching material and to 
establish standards for legislation in this new field of school 
administration. In 1907 Snedden published his study of the 
Administration and Educational Work of American Juvenile 
Reform Schools. In 1908 appeared Dutton and Snedden’s 
Administration of Public Education in the United States, the 
first real textbook for college courses on school administration 
to be published in this country. A volume of approximately 
six hundred pages, it dealt with state, county, and city 
administrative problems in a new way, and for the next 
decade served as the standard textbook in American colleges 
and universities. In 1911 Swift published his monumental 
History of Permanent Public School Funds in the United 
States, 1705-1905, a study on which he had been engaged for 
half a dozen years, and one which opened for him a field of 
state school finance which he has worked very fruitfully ever 
since. In 1913 Sies published his study of Teachers’ Pensions
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and Pension Sysiems, this being followed by Furst and 
Kandel’s study of Pensions for Public School Teachers in 
1918. 
In 1914 the writer’s State and County Educational Re- 
organization appeared, and in 1915 Professor Elliott and the 
writer collaborated on a Source Book in State and County 
School Administration. These two volumes, together with 
the general textbook by Dutton and Snedden, have been 
much used as texts in the courses in state educational 
administration which have since been developed in our 
American colleges and universities. A textbook on the 
same subject, which would furnish amplé teaching material 
for a separate course in state and county school administra- 
tion, is now under way, after many delays, and the writer 
hopes to finish it within the present year. In 1916 the 
writer’s Public School Administration appeared, this being a 
textbook primarily on city school administration, but 
applying the lessons of city administrative experience to both 
county and state educational organization. 
Of the other new and early specialization in administration 
mentioned, that of the application of statistical procedure to 
the study of educational problems, we find its first beginnings 
in 1902-03, when Professor Thorndike began to teach the 
elements of the method to his class in educational psychology. 
In 1904 he published his Introduction to the Theory of Mental 
and Social Measurements. ‘This work marked the beginning 
of a new era in the study of educational problems, as with 
the possibility of applying statistical procedure to them an 
entirely new method of study was now opened up. The 
first fruits of this method, as applied to school administra- 
tion, came in 1905, with the publication of two Teachers 
College doctor’s dissertations, one by Elliott on Some Fiscal 
Aspects of Public Education in American Cities, and the other 
by Strayer on City School Expenses: The Variability and
-P-A-G-E-203
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 187 
Interrelation of the Principal Items. In 1908 appeared 
Snedden and Allen’s School Reports and School Efficiency, an 
attempt to apply statistical methods to school reporting ; 
in 1909 appeared Ayres’s very important statistical study of 
retardation in and elimination from school, under the title of 
Laggards in the School ; in 1912 Holmes published his ex- 
tensive study of promotional procedure under the title of 
School Organization and the Individual Child; in 1913 
Bobbitt’s monograph on The Supervision of City Schools 
appeared, giving an excellent discussion of standards and of 
efficiency methods in administration ; in 1913, too, Strayer 
and Thorndike published their Educational Administration, 
a series of quantitative studies relating to pupils, the teach- 
ing staff, curricula, finance, and the measurement of educa- 
tional output. In 1917 Rugg’s Statistical Methods Applied to 
Education came out and at once took its place as the standard 
textbook in educational statistics, serving to introduce this 
new type of administrative course into all our leading schools 
and departments of education. Numbers of articles and 
volumes applying statistical procedure to pedagogical and 
mental testing have also appeared, particularly within the 
past decade, but these lie outside the limits of this chapter, 
and are left to be treated in the chapters by Professors 
Leary and Sears. 
The titles enumerated above represent perhaps the more 
important volumes which mark the creative decade from 
about 1905 to about 1915. Since that time numerous 
studies, dealing with problems of state and city adminis- 
trative procedure, have appeared in print. These have 
come from the pens of students in many educational insti- 
tutions, and the limits of space preclude their enumeration 
here. They have dealt with such questions as school funds, 
school finance, school building programs, state aid, admin- 
istrative organization, publicity, budget making, teacher
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
training, compulsory education, health work organization, 
size of classes, rating of teachers, salaries and pensions, text- 
books, supervision, economy of time, curriculum studies, 
and many other similar administrative problems. 
Since 1915 three new educational magazines have been 
started which have carried many articles of an administrative 
and statistical nature, and the files of which are regarded 
to-day as part of the necessary equipment of every educa- 
tional library. These three are School and Society, an 
Educational Administration and Supervision, both of which 
began publication in January, 1915, and the Journal of 
Educational Research, which began publication in January, 
1920. The result is that to-day the teacher of school admin- 
istration finds a growing literature with which it requires 
much time to keep in touch, his instructional work differen- 
tiated into a dozen or more administrative courses, and a 
constantly increasing number of eager students continually 
calling for more and more information and guidance. 
School Surveys 
A little more than a decade ago another important develop- 
ment in administrative procedure, that has added much new 
instructional material for courses in school administration, 
was begun in the work of the school survey. The practical 
results of the survey work have deeply influenced the type of 
material incorporated into courses and textbooks on school 
administration. The survey movement has rapidly devel- 
oped into an important form of educational engineering, by 
means of which the administrative problems of a school 
system may be determined, a more intelligent procedure in 
the organization and administration and supervision of school 
systems may be formulated, and the returns on the invest- 
ment of time and money and human effort in education may 
be inereased. With the aid of the new standardized tests
-P-A-G-E-205
    PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 189 
and measures, which the past fifteen years have also seen 
evolved, the school survey has now become our most impor- 
tant means for educational administrative diagnosis. 
The first type of the city school system survey was the 
small ‘‘once-over’’ personal estimate type of survey report 
represented by the Montclair School Survey, as made by 
Hanus in 1911 (28 pages), the first of the city survey reports, 
and the Expert Survey of the Public School System of Boise, 
Idaho (31 pages), as made by Elliott, Judd, and Strayer in 
1912. In the Report of the Baltimore Survey Commission 
(112 pages) in 1911, the second of the survey reports in 
point of time, made by a commission composed of Brown, 
Cubberley, and Kendall, assisted by Hillegas and Updegraff, 
we first find the descriptive and comparative type of school 
‘ survey. In the extensive statistical study of a school system 
made in the New York City School Inquiry, directed by 
Hanus, assisted by a staff of experts, in 1911-12, we find a 
report consisting of a series of specialized volumes which 
represent still another type of survey. This type of school 
survey was exemplified later in its best form in the Cleveland 
School Survey, as directed by Ayres, and the Gary School 
Survey, as directed by Flexner, both made in 1915-16. 
The four early survey reports mentioned — Montclair, 
Baltimore, Boise, and New York City — were clearly ex- 
perimental in character. Each was useful at the time, and 
each served to mark out lines to follow and to avoid, and thus 
helped to shape later school survey procedure. 
In the Report of the Examination of the School System of 
East Orange, New Jersey (68 pages), made by Moore in the 
autumn of 1911; in the Bridgeport, Connecticut, School 
Survey (129 pages), made by a staff of experts under the 
direction of Van Sickle, in 1913; and in the Portland, Oregon, 
School Survey (317 pages), made similarly by a staff under the 
direction of Cubberley in the same year, new lines in city
-P-A-G-E-206
    190 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
school surveying were marked out which have been followed 
in nearly all subsequent city school surveys. While these 
three reports were still descriptive and statistical and com- 
parative, and were based, with the exception of the East 
Orange Report, which was done by Moore alone, on a careful 
examination of the schools by a specialized staff, as had been 
done in the New York City Inquiry, the strength as well as 
the weakness of the school systems was pointed out, the 
different phases of the organization and administration and 
instruction were evaluated in a series of separate chapters, 
and in particular the reports were directed toward the 
constructive development of the school system along good 
lines in the future, criticisms made being used constantly as 
a basis for constructive suggestions as to improvement. 
Quite similar lines were followed in the Springfield, Illinois, * 
Survey (150 pages), made by Ayres early in 1914. 
Bobbitt, in a survey of the schools of South Bend, Indiana, 
in the spring of 1914, and still more so in his survey of the 
schools of San Antonio, Texas, in 1915, developed another 
type of technique in which he placed the chief emphasis of 
each report on the proper organization of the courses of 
instruction in the schools, devoting the report largely to an 
extended discussion of what the schools ought to teach, and 
why. In A Review of the Rockford, Illinois, Public Schools, 
1915-16, made by R. G. Jones, while Superintendent of 
Schools there, another type of technique was originated in 
the form of a self-survey, and in the introduction of numerous 
charts and diagrams, designed to give to the people of Rock- 
ford a pictorial presentation of the work of their schools. 
In the Butte School Survey, made in the spring of 1914 by a 
staff of experts under the direction of Strayer, the newly 
developed standard tests were employed for the first time 
in any extensive way. Courtis had used his arithmetic 
tests earlier in the New York Inquiry, but the Butte survey
-P-A-G-E-207
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 191 
was the first in which the different standardized tests then 
available were used to evaluate the instruction given by a 
school system. This survey thus developed another new 
type of school survey technique, that of a careful measure- 
ment of the instruction given, and one that has been followed 
in nearly all surveys of city school systems made since 1914. 
In the Salt Lake City School Survey, made in 1915 by a staff 
under the direction of Cubberley, the different types of 
technique then developed — descriptive, comparative, sta- 
tistical, standardized testing, graphic display, and evaluation 
by the staff — were all combined in the work of the survey 
and its report. This composite type of survey report may 
now be said to have become a standard type for a report in a 
single volume of readable size; perhaps the best example of 
this type of survey technique which we now have is to be 
found in The Boise Survey (290 pages), as made by Sears, 
assisted by Proctor and Williams, in 1919, and published the 
following year by the World Book Company. Perhaps the 
best example of the many-volumed, specialized series of 
reports type of survey we have, also combining the different 
forms of survey technique, is the Cleveland School Survey, in 
twenty-five volumes, made by a large staff of experts under 
the direction of Ayres, in 1915-16. 
By 1915-16 it may be said that the city school survey had 
become standardized as to type and purpose, and established 
as an important part of our administrative technique. 
Since that date the school survey has become common, the 
number made since then being too large for mention here. 
Its successor, the self-survey by local educational authorities, 
and the continuous survey by a city department of statistics 
and research, have. become established as recognized parts 
of the administrative procedure of a city school system. 
The school survey has also been extended in many new 
directions and specialized in character. Cubberley in 1915
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
applied the technique developed to a study of the school 
finances of Oakland, Cal.; Hawkins, Strayer, and Trabue, 
to a study of the educational system of Nassau County, 
N. Y., in 1917; and numerous school building requirement 
surveys have been made and published. 
To-day we may be said, as a result of the coming of the 
school survey, to have developed a new technique of fun- 
* damental importance in administrative educational diag- 
nosis. Courses for the study of the school surveys as printed 
have been introduced in many departments and schools of 
education, and we await now only the production of a 
satisfactory textbook on the administrative use of the 
school survey to enable departments of education generally 
to offer to their students a course that will summarize the 
results of the best that has been done, and will train students 
of school administration in the best methods of diagnostic 
technique. 
In 1913 the survey idea and technique were applied to the 
study of a state school system, in the case of Vermont, in a 
study undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation at the request 
of an educational commission, which had been created to 
inquire into the needs of education in that state. While 
there had been previous educational commissions which had 
reported on state educational needs before the Vermont 
study was made, notably California in 1900 and Illinois in 
1909, the work represented in previous reports had been 
based on hearings and questionnaires and collected statistics, 
while the Vermont inquiry was made by an expert com- 
mission that went into and traveled over the state, basing 
its report on the results of its examination. The Vermont 
study, therefore, represents the first real application of the 
city school survey idea to a study of state educational 
problems. The chief work on this survey was done by 
Elliott, Hillegas, and Learned, and the report, a volume of
-P-A-G-E-209
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 193 
241 large pages published in 1914, made a careful analysis of 
the educational needs and resources of the state, and offered 
a legislative program for the future development of education 
in the state. This study definitely established a technique 
for state school surveying. 
In 1916 the General Education Board published a study 
of public education in Maryland, made similarly by Bach- 
man and Flexner for a state educational survey commission. 
This represented another type of study — that of analyzing 
and describing existing conditions, and pointing out the more 
important changes that ought to be made, with a view to 
securing early legislative action on the recommendations 
made. The report was, in consequence, more popular in 
nature and less extensive than the Vermont report had been, 
though based on approximately as thorough and intensive 
a study of state educational conditions and needs. This 
Maryland study has been followed by a somewhat similar 
study of the state school systems of Delaware (1919), North 
Carolina (1920), and Kentucky (1921), and one for Indiana 
is nearly ready for publication. These have all been made 
by Bachman and Flexner. In 1915 the United States 
Bureau of Education entered upon the work of state school 
surveying with a study of the higher educational institutions 
of Iowa, made by a commission of which Capen was chair- 
man, and soon followed this by state educational surveys of 
Washington, North Dakota, Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado, 
South Dakota, and Alabama — all completed by the close of 
1919. In 1919 Virginia provided for a survey of education 
in that state, and a large staff of specialists, collaborators, 
and advisers, under the direction of Inglis, was selected for 
the work. In this survey, in addition to the usual general 
study of the legal and administrative and financial organiza- 
tion of the schools of the state, with recommendations for 
their future development, an attempt was made for the first
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
time to measure and determine the efficiency of instruction 
in the schools of a state by means of the use of the stand- 
ardized tests. By 1920 the technique for the state school 
survey had been clearly developed, as is shown by the fact 
that the state school surveys made since and now under 
way follow the lines laid down in the Vermont, Maryland, 
Iowa, Washington, and Virginia surveys. The reports of 
these surveys now provide much valuable material for use 
with students in courses in state school administration. 
Summary of Progress 
A review of what has been presented in this chapter will 
reveal the nature of the period which this memorial volume 
has under consideration. What has been shown for the 
subject of school administration holds true for almost all 
other divisions of the subject of education. The quarter- 
century just past has been a great creative period in our work. 
The first six to eight years were an experimental and for- 
mative period. New departments were being created to 
teach a new subject for which there was as yet but little in 
literature or traditions. The early teachers were largely of 
the successful experience type, and when young men trained 
in other lines started work in education, they had to find their 
work and create their tools. 
By about 1905 we clearly note the beginnings of a distinct 
change. The successful practitioner begins to be replaced 
by young men who have obtained some little training in 
education itself, and the beginnings of specialization within 
the division of administration appear. The study of state 
and county school administration begins to separate from 
the study of city administrative problems, or rather from the 
generalized type of course in administration previously given. 
The application of the new statistical methods to the study 
of education also begins, and the mastery of the elements
-P-A-G-E-211
  PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 195 
of statistical procedure in time becomes a necessary tool. 
The new standardized tests and measures are evolved and 
serve as a means of changing school supervision from guess- 
work to scientific accuracy. 
By the middle of the period under review we find the 
beginnings of the city school survey, a new administrative 
instrument of very large importance, and half a dozen years 
later we find its technique perfected and the city school 
survey becoming common. This has virtually developed a 
new field of educational engineering. To-day the local 
self-survey and the creation of city departments of statistics 
and research mark the passing over of the survey movement 
into established administrative procedure, while the results 
obtained from the different surveys made, both in fact and in 
technique, now only await organization into textbook form 
to make them available for teaching purposes. The appli- 
cation of the survey idea to state school organization and 
problems came soon after, and as a natural consequence of 
the results obtained from the use of the school survey in the 
cities. This too has provided the teacher of school admin- 
istration with much new teaching material, and this too is now 
passing over into permanent form in the creation of state 
research divisions to do work for the schools of the state 
similar to that now done by the research bureaus for the cities. 
The twenty-five years under review have witnessed a great 
expansion of the subject of education along all lines. In 
administration, the single course of a quarter of a century 
ago has been expanded into a large division, and sometimes 
into a department within aschool. Instead of the course 
being but a part of one man’s work, a number of instructors 
are now required to cover the many courses which have been 
developed in the subject ; and many students who now go to 
universities for graduate work in education do so to specialize 
in school administration alone.

  CHAPTER VIII 
Pusuic ScHoou Finance 
A Period of Unparalleled Interest 
No period: in the history of school finance in the United 
States is more important or more interesting than that of 
the last quarter of a century. Before entering upon a 
detailed consideration of this period, it will be well to call 
attention to some of the outstanding events and tendencies 
which give this period a unique significance in the history of 
American education. 
During this period school costs have mounted by leaps 
and bounds. New policies of school support have been 
adopted and others are now in the process of early experi- 
mentation. New conceptions of what our public schools 
must endeavor to do for the millions of children who, year 
after year, pass in and out of their schoolrooms have led to 
an expansion of the course of study and to the attempt on 
the part of our public schools not only to furnish new types 
of instruction, but to provide many types of physical care 
almost undreamed of by the directors of public education a 
quarter of a century ago. Some of the projects well-nigh 
unthought of at that time, but which the public schools 
of to-day are undertaking, are suggested by the following 
list: medical inspection, health supervision, dental clinics, 
psychological clinics, open-air schools, supervised play, 
special schools and classes for blind, deaf, crippled, and men- 
tally backward or deficient children, care of truancy cases, 
home visiting, public kindergartens, extensive programs of 
physical and health education. During the period under 
199
-P-A-G-E-216
  200 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
consideration a number of states have enacted free textbook 
laws, and laws providing for continuation classes for minors 
engaged in industry. The federal government has entered 
upon a national program for the promotion of vocational 
education. A number of private foundations, possessing 
in some cases almost fabulous endowments, have been incor- 
porated and are to-day making generous contributions to the 
promotion of public education. This period has seen a 
steady decline in the relative importance of the part played 
by the state in financing our public schools and a greater 
and greater tendency to make the locus of responsibility the 
local school unit and to place the major portion of the burden 
upon it. 
One of the most significant features in the history of school 
finance during the last twenty-five years is the gradual 
awakening on the part of the public to a realization that no 
problem in education is more important than the problem of 
school support. If one turns to the annual volumes pub- 
lished by the National Education Association, he discovers 
that in the year 1890 the subject of public school finance was 
given little, if any, place in the deliberations of this body, 
either at its general sessions or at the meetings of the De- 
partment of Superintendence. The topics under discussion 
at that time related chiefly to child study, teacher training, 
discipline, and courses of study. The outstanding topic in 
1910 appears to have been individual differences. 
In 1911 appeared what proved to be an epoch-making 
document in the development of city school finance. It was 
in this year that a committee appointed by the National 
Education Association presented its preliminary Report on 
Uniform Records and Reports. The final report of this 
Committee was published in 1912 by the United States 
Bureau of Education as Bulletin No. 3 of that year. This 
report is one of the most significant contributions yet made 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 201 
to the scientific study of city school finance. In the program 
of the National Education Association for the year 1915, the 
problem of school finance is given a place, albeit a minor one. 
But from 1915 onward, the subject of public school finance 
occupies a larger and larger place, not only in the programs 
and deliberations of this, our greatest national education 
association, but in that of every education organization and 
association. Indeed, at the present writing, there is prob- 
ably no question related to public education which is en- 
gaging a greater amount of thoughtful attention, both on the 
part of scientific students and on the part of the general 
public. 
Scope of Present Chapter 
From these preliminary observations, we may now turn 
to consider more definitely the course of events in the history 
of public school finance in the United States during the last 
three decades. Our account may well begin with a consider- 
ation of the increase in costs of public schools and the reasons 
for this increase. Following this, we will direct our attention 
to the trend of state policies, the growth of local school 
support and its results, the growth of federal aid to public 
schools, the present critical situation, and the outlook for 
the future. 
Growth of School Costs and Causes 
In 1870 the United States spent $63,000,000 on public 
’ schools; in 1920 the expenditure was $1,036,000,000, an 
increase of considerably over 1500 per cent. 
Our approximate total expenditure for public schools 
amounted in 1900 to $215,000,000, in 1910 to $426,000,000, 
and in 1920 to $1,036,000,000. These vast increases in 
school expenditure are the result of the interaction of many 
factors: the rapid increase in school population, the length- 
ening of the legal school year, the assignment by the com-
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  202 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
munity to the school of a larger and larger number of func- 
tions resulting in the introduction of many new types of 
studies and activities. 
The first of the above causes that concerns us is the 
enormous increase in the number of children for whom the 
United States is providing public elementary and secondary 
education, and the great increase in the amount spent for 
each school child educated at public expense. The fact 
that the population of the United States increased from 
approximately 63,000,000 in 1890 to 106,000,000 in 1920 
would in itself result in a great increase in the school popula- 
tion and school costs. In 1890 there were approximately 
8,000,000 children in average daily attendance upon public 
schools in the United States; in 1920 there were 16,000,000. 
In 1890 the average annual expenditure for each child in 
average daily attendance was $17; in 1920 it was $64. We 
have seen that the per cent of increase of the total amount 
expended for public schools from 1870 to 1920 was over 1500. 
For this same period the number of children in average daily 
attendance increased 300 per cent, and the average annual 
expenditure per child 314 per cent. Let us now consider 
briefly some of the most important reasons contributing to 
this increase in school attendance and school costs, other 
than the increase in the total population of the United 
States. 
The number of children attending public school has 
greatly increased — with a resulting increase in school © 
costs — during the last quarter of a century. This is due 
not only to increase in population, but also to the enactment 
of compulsory school laws and the extension of the school 
age. In 1894-95, according to the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, there were nineteen states which had no compulsory 
school law. In 1920 there was not a single state in the Union 
which did not have such a law. It is scarcely necessary to
-P-A-G-E-219
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 203 
add that the degree of effectiveness with which these laws 
have been enforced has steadily increased throughout the 
last twenty-five years, with the result that a larger and larger 
percentage of children of school age has been found within 
the public schools. Not only is this true, but a comparison 
of the compulsory school age in those states which in the 
year 1895 had a compulsory school law with the com- 
pulsory school age in these same states for the year 1918 
shows that, while in New Hampshire the compulsory school 
age had decreased two years, in New Mexico one year, and 
in five states had remained unchanged, yet in eighteen 
states it had increased all the way from one to four years. 
In this connection, attention should be called to the length of 
the average school year in the United States, which increased 
from 135 days in 1890 to 162 days in 1920. 
Another factor which has played a large part in the in- 
crease of school costs in the United States is the multiplica- 
tion of high schools and an unprecedented growth of high 
school attendance. How important these factors are can 
better be understood by a comparison of what it costs to 
educate a high school pupil with what it costs to educate an 
elementary school pupil. In 1918 the average cost in the 
United States per elementary school pupil enrolled was 
$31.65 ; per high school pupil enrolled, $84.48. In 1920 the 
expenditure per elementary pupil and per high school pupil 
was approximately double that of the year 1918, being in 
fact $64.03 per elementary pupil enrolled, and $158.21 per 
high school pupil enrolled. From these facts we see that it 
costs approximately two and one half times as much to 
educate pupils attending high schools as pupils attending 
elementary schools. These facts become of great significance 
in attempting to determine the reasons for mounting costs 
in education when we discover that seven times as large a 
proportion of our total population was attending high school
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
in 1920 as was attending high school in 1890. More specif- 
ically, in 1890 three tenths of one per cent (.003) of the total 
population in the United States was enrolled in high school, 
whereas in 1920 two and one tenth per cent (.021) was 
enrolled. In the year 1890 approximately three persons out 
of every one thousand in the United States were enrolled in 
high school; in 1920 twenty-one persons out of every one 
thousand. The trend becomes even more impressive when 
we turn our consideration from the total population to that 
portion of it actually enrolled in school: in 1890 out of every 
thousand children enrolled in school only sixteen were in 
high school; in 1920 out of every thousand children enrolled 
one hundred and two were enrolled in high school. Finally, 
we discover that, whereas in 1890 the United States was 
spending $4,759,065 for public high schools, in 1920 the ex- 
penditure on public high schools, excluding all cities of less 
than 10,000 population, and excluding also costs of adminis- 
tration, capital outlay, and debt service, was $66,024,307. 
In considering increases in school population and in total 
school costs which have marked the last quarter of a century, 
the fact must not be overlooked that no less than ten states 
have been admitted into the Union since 1888. Four 
of these states were admitted in the year 1889, and the 
remaining six from 1890 to 1912. The Nation’s aggregate 
school costs have been greatly augmented by the rapid 
development of these new states, their growth in population, 
and particularly the fact that they came into the Union 
with a marked zeal for public education and possessing vast 
federal endowments which stimulated them to establish and 
maintain high standards as to the accessibility and quality 
of the educational facilities they provided. 
It is impossible in the present brief chapter to give the 
consideration merited by a number of other causes which, 
combined with those already mentioned, have steadily forced
-P-A-G-E-221
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 205 
upward expenditures for public schools. Reference was 
made in an opening paragraph to the expansion of the 
course of study, to the development of vocational education, 
to the establishment of continuation classes, and to the fact 
that a great number of new projects and new responsibilities 
have been assumed by the public schools during the last 
quarter of a century. To these must be added three other 
causes: a steady rise in the educational and professional 
qualifications demanded of public school teachers, which 
necessitates a steady increase in the salaries paid; a similar 
continual rise in building and equipment standards; and a 
final cause — one which is frequently overlooked by the 
public — the depreciation of the purchasing power of the 
dollar. A brief report recently prepared by the Research 
Division of the National Education Association contains 
the following significant paragraph : 
It is true that there have been some “real’’ increases in school costs 
resulting from increased attendance and the broadening of the school’s 
work. Likewise, there have been some “‘real”’ increases in the national 
income in terms of quantity of goods produced, due to the wider use of 
machinery and general improvement of production methods. But far 
more important than either of these in bringing about the “rapid increase” 
in school expenditures and national income is the depreciation of the 
dollar. The so-called increases in educational expenditures have been 
largely fictitious. What has really happened since 1913 is that the dollar 
has depreciated in buying power. As a result, educational expenditures, 
as well as national income, when measured in dollars, have both shown 
a rapid increase. (The Journal of the National Education Association, 
Vol. XII, No. 3, p. 118.) 
Thus far, attention has been focused chiefly upon the 
increasing costs of public education during the last quarter 
of a century and the causes of this increase. Let us now 
consider the tendencies which have characterized policies 
in public school finance during this era. The first, and, 
from some standpoints, perhaps the most important of these 
tendencies, is the decline in the relative importance of the 
state as the provider of school revenues.
-P-A-G-E-222
206 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Decline in Relative Importance of State Funds 
During the period under consideration the actual amounts 
contributed to public education from state funds have 
steadily increased. But the important question is not 
whether the state is now giving two dollars or five dollars 
where formerly she gave one dollar, but rather whether the 
state is shouldering as large, a larger, or a smaller share of 
the total school burden than she did twenty-five years ago. 
The real facts in the case are that, whereas in 1890 the state 
furnished approximately $23.75 out of every $100 provided 
for public schools, in 1920 only $16.80 came from state 
sources. The situation becomes even more impressive when 
we consider certain individual states, particularly those states 
which in 1890 derived half or more than half of their revenue 
from state funds. In 1890 the per cent of total school receipts 
provided by the state in Alabama was 68 ; in Georgia, 57; in 
Kentucky, 59; in North Carolina, 77 ; in South Carolina, 83 ; 
in Tennessee, 82; in Texas, 80. In 1920 the per cent of total 
school receipts provided by the state in these same common- 
wealths was as follows : Alabama, 51 ; Georgia, 44 ; Kentucky, 
37; North Carolina, 30; South Carolina, 16 ; Tennessee, 18; 
Texas, 54. Of the above seven states, in 1890, four derived 
more than 75 per cent of their total receipts from state funds ; 
in 1920, only two, Alabama and Texas, derived more than 50 
per cent from the state. It should be noted that in 1890 
local zeal for public education was undeveloped in most of 
these states, and that the decline in the proportion of total 
school costs borne by the state and the accompanying in- 
crease in the proportion borne by local units indicates a 
desirable and healthy tendency in so far as it indicates more 
generous support for public schools. However, it is equally 
evident that in these commonwealths the state has allowed 
the burden of school support to be shifted to minor con-
-P-A-G-E-223
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 207 
stituent school corporations with a degree of rapidity that 
calls in question the soundness of this tendency. 
Declining Importance of State Endowments 
In 1890 the public schools of the United States derived 
5.45 per cent of their total school receipts from the income of 
permanent school funds and lands and 18.30 per cent from 
the proceeds of state taxes and appropriations. In 1920 
permanent funds and lands contributed 2.7 per cent and 
state taxes and appropriations 13.8 per cent. From this we 
see that the proportion of total school receipts derived from 
permanent funds in 1920 was only half of what it was in 1890. 
The significance of this fact cannot be fully appreciated unless 
we recall that except for the admission of six new states with 
vast endowments, the per cent of total school receipts 
derived from permanent funds would have declined much 
more rapidly than it did. : 
It should not be overlooked that the actual per cent of 
total school receipts derived from permanent funds is con- 
siderably less than that shown in state and federal official 
reports. In no less than one third of the states which an- 
nually report revenue derived from permanent school funds, 
these funds exist totally or largely as paper funds, accounts 
carried on the books-of the state, or represented by irre- 
deemable state bonds. In some states, funds once accumu- 
lated have been diverted or lost. Other states, such as 
Michigan, Maine, and Ohio, use for general state purposes 
all moneys paid into the state treasury to the credit of the 
state permanent school fund and establish a state debt on 
which the commonwealth binds itself to pay interest at a 
fixed rate to the public schools. 
A study recently made by the writer, of state permanent 
school funds, reveals the fact that 15 per cent of the perma- 
nent school fund of Nevada, 18 per cent of the perpetual
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
school fund of California, and 32 per cent of Wisconsin’s 
school fund exist only as state debts. All of Louisiana’s 
surplus revenue fund and 58 per cent of her free-school fund 
are recognized as permanent state debts by her Constitution. 
The entire principal of the so-called permanent state school 
fund is practically a state debt in the following eight states : 
Arkansas, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New 
Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee. 
Many of the debts to state permanent school funds were 
undoubtedly due to the inexperience of the states at the 
time they came into possession of these endowments, and 
to a lack of adequate vision of the possibilities and the 
purposes of such endowments. Such a defense cannot be 
made, however, of states which, with generations of ex- 
perience, continue to mismanage or divert these sacred 
trusts. 
‘Arkansas is an example of a state pursuing such a policy. 
A study of the federal grants devoted by Arkansas to her 
permanent public school fund shows that had this fund been 
properly managed, Arkansas would to-day possess a per- 
manent endowment of approximately $92,000,000, yielding 
an annual revenue of $4,600,000, more than one third of the 
total amount Arkansas expended for public schools in 1920. 
Instead of any such princely sum, Arkansas has to-day a 
nonproductive fund whose paltry income of $74,000 is, from 
the standpoint of a productive endowment, a pure fiction. 
This fund has been continuously deprived of lands and 
moneys devoted to it by the Constitution, and defrauded by 
laws which gave, and still give, title to school lands to 
persons able to show tax receipts for a certain number of 
years but who undoubtedly have no just claim to the lands 
deeded them. A study of the facts in the case, and of 
present as well as past laws, would seem to show that the 
citizens of Arkansas have conceived their permanent public 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 209 
school fund primarily as a fund to be used for the advantage 
of individual citizens, or to be employed to rescue the state 
from any and every financial crisis. As late as 1921, $180,000 
in cash which had accumulated in the state treasury to the 
credit of the permanent fund was used to pay the state’s 
penitentiary debt and was replaced by state paper. One of 
the most significant, as well as one of the most disheartening 
features of the situation, is the fact that the transactions 
involved were entirely lawful, being in fact merely the car- 
rying out of the enactments of the legislature. 
Tendencies in State Taxation and Appropriations 
It has been shown that state taxes and appropriations 
have declined in relative importance as sources of public 
school revenue far less rapidly than permanent school funds. 
This is due to a number of causes. The increase of per- 
manent school funds is dependent upon additions to these 
funds from fixed sources of predetermined value. Appro- 
priations and state tax rates may both be increased by the 
legislative bodies of the states. A study made in 1920 
showed that twenty-nine states devoted the proceeds of a 
state tax to public schools. Twenty of these states employed 
a mill general property tax. It is evident that where this 
type of tax is employed the revenue produced thereby will 
increase as the wealth and population of the state increase. 
A further factor which has caused state school taxes and 
appropriations to hold their own much better than permanent 
school funds is the fact that a number of our states during 
the period under consideration have recognized the evils 
resulting from the tendency of the state to shoulder a de- 
creasing proportion of the school burden, and have adopted 
policies definitely designed to increase state school taxes 
and appropriations. In 1919 California passed a law which 
raised the state grant from $15 to $17.50 per year for each
-P-A-G-E-226
    210 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
pupil in average daily attendance in elementary schools. 
By constitutional amendment adopted November 2, 1920, 
and by legislation enacted to carry out the same, the grant 
was raised to $30 per pupil. In like manner, in 1920, 
California increased her state grant per high school pupil 
from $15 to $30. Thus we see that in the case of California 
the state grant was increased approximately 100 per cent in 
the year 1920. 
No less interesting is the action of Massachusetts. This 
state leads the Union in the antiquity of her practice of 
supporting schools overwhelmingly by local taxation. In 
1915 Massachusetts derived 97.1 per cent of her total school 
revenues from local taxation. Four years later we find her 
frankly recognizing the necessity of departing from this 
policy and passing a law providing for setting aside a portion 
of the proceeds of the state income tax as an annual current 
school fund to be known as the general school fund. As the 
result of this action, whereas in 1905 Massachusetts derived 
2.8 per cent of her total public school revenues from the 
state, and in 1915 only 1.82 per cent, in 1920 the state 
furnished no less than 12.3 per cent. 
New Types of State Taxes 
Needless to say among the oldest types of taxes levied for 
schools are general property taxes and poll taxes. The 
unsatisfactoriness of the poll tax has led to its abandonment 
within the past twenty-five years by a number of states. 
California, which abolished it in 1914, may be taken as 
an example. In a number of states, poll taxes for school 
purposes continue to be levied by minor public corpora- 
tions, such as counties or towns, but in only nine is a 
state poll tax levied for schools. North Carolina levies the 
highest state school poll tax, $1.43, and Indiana the lowest, 
fifty cents. A poll tax of $1 is levied in the seven remaining
-P-A-G-E-227
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 211 
states; namely, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, 
Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
Although there is a strong tendency to depend less than 
formerly upon the general property tax, due to a growing 
recognition within the past decade of the unsoundness of this 
tax, it still remains the most universally employed of all 
taxes. No less than twenty states levy a state school mill 
tax on all taxable real and personal property within the 
state, rates varying all the way from 0.7 of one mill in 
Wisconsin to 4.6 mills in Utah. 
A recent tendency of great significance is the levying of a 
state mill tax the rate of which is not specified in the law 
other than that it shall be sufficient to produce a certain 
total sum or so much per teacher or per school child. This 
mode of taxation is employed in at least five states: Arizona, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
The tendency of our national industrial life away from 
what were once almost exclusively agricultural occupations 
to an increasingly large proportion of manufacturing and 
commercial activities has brought about a transformation 
in the character and in the form of property and wealth. 
Formerly wealth was represented almost entirely by real 
and personal property, but within the last twenty-five years 
wealth and property have tended more and more to become 
corporate, and many forms of income derived from sources 
other than tangible property can be reached only by special 
forms of taxation. 
As an outcome of this transformation in industrial life 
and wealth, states are coming to recognize that frequently 
the possession of an income, whether derived from an earned 
salary, from income for professional services, or from in- 
tangible property such as stocks and bonds, is a much truer 
index of ability and of obligation to support public under- 
takings than is the possession of real or personal property. 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
According to a recent statement of the Federal Department 
of Commerce, thirty-three states levy taxes on corporation 
stock, nine on savings banks, and forty-two on inheritances. 
Reference has already been made to the use of the income 
tax by Massachusetts as a source of school revenue. Dela- 
ware depends very largely for the support of schools upon her 
recently created state income tax. 
California, after years of experimenting with a state 
general property tax, abandoned the same in favor of biennial 
appropriations from the state general fund. But at the 
time she abandoned the state general property tax she 
adopted the policy of levying a state tax upon corporations, 
with the result that approximately 60 per cent of the general 
fund from which the major portion of all state aid comes is 
derived at the present time from corporation taxes. The 
amount provided by the state corporation tax in California 
is many times as large as the greatest amount ever produced 
by the state general property school tax. This made it 
possible for California to increase her pupil grants in 1920, 
as already noted, approximately 100 per cent. In 1920 the 
state furnished only 14 per cent of the total receipts for public 
schools. It is estimated that if the constitutional amend- 
ment of 1920 had been in effect in 1921, the state would have 
furnished no less than 26 per cent of the total receipts for 
elementary and secondary schools. 
An epoch-making event in the history of public finance 
was the enactment by the state of Louisiana of a law which 
became effective on July 1, 1920, providing for a severance 
tax on all natural products severed from the soil, except 
agricultural products. A number of states, such as Utah and 
Minnesota, had long levied taxes upon ores, but a severance 
tax taxes not only ores, but timber, sand, gravel, clay, gas, 
oil, and all other nonagricultural natural products. The 
proceeds of this tax in Louisiana are devoted in part to the  
-P-A-G-E-229
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 213 
State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 
and in part to state institutions for the deaf, blind, and other 
special classes. None of the proceeds go to public schools. 
Nevertheless, as a new type of taxation it is of great 
significance and should prove suggestive to many other 
states which are looking for new sources of school revenue. 
It is estimated that the Louisiana State University will 
receive annually from the severance tax between one and a 
half and two million dollars. It is interesting to note in this 
connection that in accordance with the writer’s reeommenda- 
tions contained in a survey of public education in Arkansas 
made under the direction of the United States Bureau of 
Education, the Arkansas legislature of 1923 enacted laws 
providing for a state income tax and a state severance tax. 
Increasing Importance of Local Support 
Parallel with the decline of the relative importance of 
state funds as sources of school revenue there has been a 
continuous growth in the proportion of the total school 
revenue furnished by minor constituent public corporations ; 
namely, counties, towns, school districts, and, in Louisiana, 
parishes. In 1890, 68 per cent of the total receipts for 
public schools in the United States were derived from local 
sources ; in 1920 slightly more than 83 per cent. Although 
there has been an increase in the proportion of the total 
school revenue furnished by local sources in nearly every 
state in the Union, with a few striking exceptions, such as 
Massachusetts already noted, the most striking increase 
has been in those states in the South Central and South 
Atlantic groups where, in 1890, 50 per cent or less than 50 
per cent of the total receipts were provided by local units. 
The per cent of total public school receipts derived from 
local sources in 1890 was, in North Carolina, 2; South 
Carolina, 13; Tennessee, 13; Texas, 12. In 1920 North
-P-A-G-E-230
214 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Carolina derived 70 per cent of her total public school 
revenue from local sources; South Carolina, 84 per cent; 
Tennessee, 82 per cent; and Texas, 46 per cent. A com- 
parison of the situation in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi for these same two 
years would show increases varying from 15 per cent to 30 
per cent. 
Whether we view individual states or the United States 
as a whole, we discover that despite a certain degree of 
progress in matters of centralization and despite court 
decisions and the utterances of educational theorists to the 
effect that public schools are state, not local, institutions, in 
actual practice, schools in the United States have tended 
more and more throughout the last quarter of a century 
to become locally supported institutions. 
The results of this tendency are being felt to-day as never 
before. From almost every state come reports of inadequate 
funds for the support of public schools and accounts of 
frantic attempts, in the name of economy, to cut teachers’ 
wages and to reduce school curricula to the narrow and arid 
state of generations gone by. The majority of our states are 
to-day financing their schools under the district system. The 
record of this system wherever found is the same: inequali- 
ties in ability to produce school revenue, inequalities in effort 
and zeal, inequalities in educational opportunity. Genera- 
tions of local support and local domination of public schools 
finds the richest nation on the earth denying multitudes of 
her children any educational opportunity whatsoever, and 
herding thousands upon thousands of others in dismal and 
unsanitary hovels, under the tutelage of wretchedly under- 
paid and proportionately ignorant, untrained, and negative 
teachers. 
It is a realization of the unfairness of existing systems of 
local support and local control and the disastrous and in-
-P-A-G-E-231
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 215 
curable evils produced by such systems that has led many 
scientific students of education and several of our states to 
give serious consideration to the possibilities of deriving a 
much larger proportion of school revenues from units more 
capable than school districts of equalizing school revenues, 
burdens, and opportunities. 
Those looking for a solution have turned their attention 
to the nation, the state, and to larger local units, such as 
the county. The marked tendency in Massachusetts and 
California to demand that the state shoulder an increasing 
share of the school burdens has already been noted. Even 
more significant is the policy recently adopted by Delaware, 
which now places practically the entire support of public 
schools directly upon the state. Other states which have re- 
cently made marked advances in this direction are Maryland, 
Montana, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington. 
This movement has been helped by the work of a number of 
leading authorities in the field of school finance, who have 
pointed out that, aside from the nation, the state is the 
only authority capable of adjusting existing inequalities and 
that if schools are in the last analysis state institutions, 
the ultimate responsibility for their maintenance and sup- 
port belongs to the state. 
Increasing Importance of the County 
Many of the greatest inequalities produced by the district 
system are the result of the inequality of these smallest of 
local units in wealth. It is an inevitable result of great 
inequalities in wealth that the funds provided by school 
districts should be very unequal. Another obvious result of 
inequality in financial ability is inequality in the effort put 
forth by the various districts to produce school revenue. 
In general it may be observed that the poorer the district 
the heavier is the tax. How the county would serve to 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
216 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
equalize school revenues and school burdens may be shown 
by afew examples. In Chippewa County, Minnesota, under 
the district system the poorest rural district must depend 
upon an average wealth of $1600 per child in average daily 
attendance at the same time that the richest rural district 
may draw upon an average wealth of $34,700 per child. 
Were the county to be employed as the unit from which to 
derive school revenue there would be available, per child, 
an average taxable property worth $5000. In St. Louis 
County, Minnesota, the richest rural district has wealth 
sufficient to enable it to draw upon $38,500 for each child in 
average daily attendance; whereas the poorest rural district 
in this same county has $1100 per child. Were the county 
depended on instead of the district, there would be for the 
support of education for each child approximately $14,900 
worth of taxable wealth. 
Some of our states, of which Maryland is a notable example, 
have depended upon the county as a unit of organization and 
school support from the very beginning of their statehood. 
Nevertheless, a widespread recognition of the significance of 
the county as a source of school revenue is of comparatively 
recent’ development. The truth of this statement is sug- 
gested by the fact that the analyses of the public school 
revenues prepared by the United States Bureau of Education 
for the years prior to 1918 did not report county school 
receipts separately, but simply included them under the 
general caption, local receipts. 
Another evidence of the rising importance of the county 
in the support of public schools is found in the fact that, 
whereas in the year 1918 only 7.9 per cent of the total school 
receipts were provided from county sources, in 1920 the 
proportion contributed by the county had increased to 11.4 
percent. During this biennial period the increase in certain 
states was exceedingly marked. Of seventeen states de- 
     
-P-A-G-E-233
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 217 
riving 15 per cent or more than 15 per cent of their school 
revenues from county funds in 1920, in only three, — Arizona, 
Maryland, and New Mexico—was the proportion less than in 
1918. In all others the proportion remained the same or was 
greatly increased. The most notable increases were in Ken- 
tucky, Oregon, Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada, Louisiana, 
and Mississippi. Among these states the smallest increase 
was in Kentucky, where in 1918 the county contributed 17 
per cent of the total school revenue and 25 per cent in 1920. 
The greatest increase was in Ohio, where in 1918 the county 
contributed only 1.7 per cent and 54 per cent in 1920. 
Tendencies in Federal Aid 
Of the policies characterizing tendencies in public school 
finance during the last ten years perhaps none has attracted 
more widespread attention than that of federal aid. The 
Smith-Lever Act, approved May 8, 1914, provided federal 
subventions for extension work in agriculture and home 
economics. On February 23, 1917, the Smith-Hughes Act 
was passed, which marks the entrance of the federal govern- 
ment upon a national policy of subsidizing public school 
vocational education and the training of vocational teachers 
and supervisors. The Smith-Hughes Law was followed by 
the Smith-Sears Act, approved June 28, 1918, and the 
Smith-Bankhead Act, June 2, 1920. The former act 
provides funds for the vocational rehabilitation of disabled 
soldiers and sailors; and the latter, funds for the vocational 
rehabilitation of civilians disabled in industry or otherwise. 
Of the above acts only two, the Smith-Lever and the Smith- 
Hughes, benefit children of public school age; consequently, 
these alone will be considered in the present chapter. 
Smith-Lever Fund 
Not a dollar of Smith-Lever money reaches public schools ; 
nevertheless, in view of the fact that a portion of this fund  
-P-A-G-E-234
  218 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
is devoted to club work for children of school age, the Smith- 
Lever fund can hardly be excluded from even a brief account 
of recent tendencies in federal aid to public schools. 
In 1920 there were no less than 442 Smith-Lever agents 
working exclusively with boys and girls. The expenditure 
for this club work amounted to $885,000. The Smith- 
Lever Act provided an initial annual appropriation. of 
$480,000, that is, $10,000 for each state in the Union. In 
addition to the above initial appropriation, the act provided 
for an appropriation of $600,000 for the second fiscal year of 
the operation of the act, and $500,000 additional for each 
year thereafter throughout a period of seven years, until the 
annual appropriation shall amount to $4,580,000. There- 
after, this amount constitutes a continuing annual appro- 
priation. The initial appropriation of $480,000 continues to 
be distributed in flat sums of $10,000 per state, but the 
additional appropriations are distributed among the states 
in the proportion that the rural population in each state 
bears to the total rural population of the United States. 
These additional appropriations must be matched by moneys 
coming from within the state, which may be supplied by 
state appropriations, by districts, counties, or other public 
corporations, by private institutions, or by individuals. 
In 1916 the total amount available for Smith-Lever work of 
all types from federal and all other sources amounted to 
$1,675,846 ; in 1922, to $10,680,000. The total amount of 
Smith-Lever funds available from 1915 to 1922 was approx- 
imately $41,900,000. 
Smith-Hughes Aid for Vocational Education 
As long ago as 1862 the federal government had begun a 
policy of subsidizing industrial and agricultural education. 
But prior to 1917 moneys devoted to such work had never 
been paid to the public schools. The Smith-Hughes Act is
-P-A-G-E-235
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 219 
significant in that with its passage, ‘‘the federal stimulus 
passed from the colleges to the public schools.”” The Smith- 
Hughes Act is significant not only for the aid it grants for 
industrial and trade training and for teacher training, but 
for the machinery it has established in every state to organize 
and direct vocational education. It is impossible here to 
enter upon a statement of the conditions and of the stand- 
ards which must be met by the states in order to participate 
in Smith-Hughes moneys. Two provisions which bear di- 
rectly on school finance must, nevertheless, be noticed : first, 
that the states must match the federal moneys dollar for 
dollar; second, that Smith-Hughes moneys are paid to the 
states only as reimbursements for moneys previously spent. 
The Smith-Hughes Act provides an annual fund, increasing 
from a total of $1,860,000 in 1918 to $7,367,000 in 1926, which 
amount thereafter becomes a continuing annual appro- 
priation. What the Smith-Hughes Act accomplished for 
vocational education during the first four years of its enforce- 
ment was summarized in a news-letter of the National 
Society for Vocational Education, issued in June, 1922. A 
few of the results set forth in this pamphlet are reproduced 
here in summary form. 
Enrollment in federally aided vocational schools increased from 164,186 
in 1917 to 323,028 in 1921. 
The enrollment in federally aided teacher training courses increased 
from 6589 in 1918 to 13,358 in 1921. 
Tn 1916 only two states in the Union, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, had 
compulsory part-time or continuation school laws. As the result of the 
Smith-Hughes Act, 21 states now have compulsory part-time education 
laws, and every state has a definite state board for the administration of 
vocational education. 
Extension of Federal Aid 
The provision of federal aid to foster vocational training 
in public schools inevitably led to the question: Ought not 
the federal government to aid the states in other educa-
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tional fields, notably in the support of elementary education? 
Out of a strong conviction in the affirmative arose the 
Smith-Towner Bill, which sought to provide an annual 
federal fund for $100,000,000 to be distributed among the 
states for subsidizing education. The Smith-Towner Bill 
failed of passage, but was succeeded by the Towner-Sterling 
Bill. 
Those advocating federal aid on any such scale as that con- 
templated by the Smith-Towner and Towner-Sterling bills 
point out the great inequalities among our states, both as 
to the educational facilities provided and more particularly 
as to ability to finance schools. In 1920 the average school 
term in the United States varied from approximately nine 
months in Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, 
and Rhode Island to five months and two weeks in South 
Carolina. The annual salary of teachers varied from over 
$1200 in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
New York, and Washington, to less than $500 in Arkansas, 
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. 
Variation in ability to provide school revenues, as measured 
by wealth per child six to twenty years of age, extends all the 
way from $27,000 in Nevada to $2000 in North Carolina and 
Mississippi. 
It is urged that conditions such as these, together with 
existing illiteracy and the well-established fact that thousands 
of school children are now growing up in the United States 
without any chance whatsoever of receiving an education, 
present a situation not to be found in any other leading 
nation in the world. The advocates of federal aid assert 
that education can no longer be regarded even as a state 
problem, but that as the states have failed to fulfill the 
responsibility which up to the present time has been in- 
trusted to them, the federal government must come to the 
rescue and at least play a minor part in removing educa-
-P-A-G-E-237
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 221 
tional inequalities for which, to a large extent, the states are 
not responsible. 
One of the interesting factors in the situation produced by 
the effort to pass the Smith-Towner and the Towner-Ster- 
ling bills is the organized opposition which these measures 
met. The United States Chamber of Commerce appointed 
a committee to study the subject of federal aid. This com- 
mittee did not agree and consequently prepared two reports 
—a Majority Report and a Minority Report. The Majority 
Report pronounced federal aid unwarranted; declared the 
states had achieved as much success in providing public 
education as could reasonably be expected of them, and 
branded federal aid as a menace to democratic institutions. 
The Minority Report took an entirely contrary view. 
Undoubtedly the most bitter opposition came from 
Catholic organizations whose attitude is expressed in a 
resolution offered by the Louisiana Federation of Catholic 
Societies : | 
Resolved that, we the representatives of the Catholic Federated So- 
cieties of Louisiana, are unanimously opposed to such measures as both 
un-American and un-Christian, and earnestly urge our people to support 
our Christian schools with increased unanimity and loyalty and to combine 
in opposing the advocacy, adoption, and advocates of these subversive 
and destructive educational schemes, thus erecting an impregnable barrier 
against this sinister menace to religion and constitutional menace to family 
and nation. 
Conclusion 
Many important events and tendencies which have marked 
the history of public school finance-in the last twenty-five 
years must be omitted from the present summary account. 
Mention, however brief, must be made of the establishment 
of a number of private foundations which have made im- 
portant contributions both through subsidizing important

public school projects and by subsidizing scientific studies 
bearing upon problems of school support. The General 
Education Board (incorporated 1903), the Carnegie Founda- 
tion (created 1905), the Russell Sage Foundation (incorpo- 
rated 1907), the Anna T. Jeanes Fund (created 1907), the 
John F. Slater Fund (established 1882), the Julius Rosen- 
wald Fund (created 1915), and the Commonwealth Fund 
(created 1921), are among the most important of these 
private foundations. 
From funds provided by the above private foundations, 
school buildings, libraries, teachers’ homes in rural districts, 
salaries of state school inspectors, and model and experi- 
mental schools have been made possible. More than this, 
these foundations have provided funds to subsidize scientific 
studies in education. In 1917 the Carnegie Foundation 
published an outline of curricula designed for the professional 
preparation of American public school teachers. A publi- 
cation which perhaps more than any other has stimulated a 
great number of states in the Union to increase support of 
education is one prepared by Leonard P. Ayres, under the 
auspices of the Russell Sage Foundation. 
Space does not permit an account of the multitude of 
activities of the General Education Board, directly affecting 
not only the general problem of public school education but 
the problems of school finance. This board has subsidized 
multitudes of educational projects both private and public, 
has directed and in part financed state public school sur- 
veys. A study of the public school finance of Arkansas, 
made by the writer, showed that the General Education 
Board provided 52 per cent of the cost of the State Depart- 
ment of Education of Arkansas in 1921. Everything that 
bears upon the question of: the establishment of new types 
of institutions and the extension of increased educational 
opportunities has important significance to problems of
-P-A-G-E-239

support. One of the most recent and most notable projects 
subsidized by private foundations is the Educational Finance 
Inquiry, a commission established in 1921 under the direction 
of Professor George D. Strayer of Columbia University, and 
receiving grants amounting to no less than $170,000 from the 
General Education Board, the Carnegie Corporation, the 
Milbank Foundation, and the Commonwealth Fund. This 
commission is of special interest in the present case, owing to 
the fact that it was definitely created to make a nation-wide 
study of public school finance. 
In the production of scientific studies in the field of public 
school finance, as in nearly every other field, Teachers 
College, Columbia University, was one of the earliest and 
most productive pioneers. Elliott’s Fiscal Aspects of Public 
Education, Cubberley’s School Funds and Their Apportion- 
ment, Hutchinson’s School Costs and School Accounting, 
Strayer’s City School Expenditures, Swift’s History of Public 
Permanent Common School Funds in the United States, were 
among the earliest notable studies in this field and still 
remain outstanding classics. 
That public institutions are rapidly becoming as alert as 
private institutions to the surpassing importance of building 
up a body of scientific knowledge in the field of public school 
finance is evident from the character of a number of publica- 
tions now being put forth by the United States Bureau of 
Education and by the research publications of such univer- 
sities as the University of California, of Iowa, and of Min- 
nesota. In 1914 the University of Iowa published Stewart’s 
Coéperative Methods of School Support in the United States. 
The University of California in Volume III of its Publications 
includes a treatment of ‘‘State Aid to Public Schools” by 
David R. Jones. Probably no one of our state universities, 
however, has contributed as much to the literature of public 
school finance as has the University of Minnesota. The
-P-A-G-E-240
  224 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
most important of the Minnesota publications up to the 
present time are Orfield’s Federal Land Grants to the States 
(1915), Kent’s State Aid to Public Schools in Minnesota 
(1918), Kelley’s History of Public School Support in Min- 
nesota (1920), and a series of studies now in process of 
publication prepared under the direction of the author of 
the present chapter, the first volume of which, dealing with 
public school finance in California and Colorado, was pub- 
lished in October, 1922; and the second volume, dealing 
with Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, appeared 
in December, 1923. 
The science of school finance is still in its early infancy. 
Only recently has the importance of this field and the fact 
that it is fundamental to all educational progress and to the 
realization of our nation’s supreme social and spiritual ideals 
begun to be appreciated. Throughout the United States 
to-day, city, state, and national organizations and commis- 
sions are working with a zeal and a devotion unsurpassed. 
On one hand the extreme individualist or the self-seeking 
opportunist declares that public education has exceeded 
all legitimate bounds and demands retrenchment. This 
ery is met on every hand by the carefully worked out and 
intelligent findings of scientific students who are at one in de- 
claring that school facilities must not be lessened but im- 
measurably increased, that the increases in school costs have 
been accompanied all along the line by vast increases in na- 
tional income, and that the present situation is not one which 
should arouse fear but rather one which should urge us to the 
working out and adoption of scientific policies of taxation, 
and of the distribution of school funds and school burdens. 
From the utterances of these careful, painstaking, and able 
experts, America derives hope, courage, and the promise of 
success in the greatest educational experiment that has ever 
been undertaken by a free people.

CHAPTER IX 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Introduction 
A striking index of the status of elementary education a 
quarter-century ago is found in the fact that in the Report 
of the United States Commissioner of Education of that time 
there was practically no attention given to this field. Col- 
leges, secondary schools, institutions for defectives, education 
in foreign countries, all were treated quite fully; but, with 
the exception of a brief discussion in connection with some 
statistics presented, one might get the impression that 
elementary education had a place of slight importance or 
that elementary schools were in a static condition with no 
problems and no need of special attention. 
It is not true, however, that the system was without 
critics or without friends with suggestions for improvement. 
In the nineties the American disciples of Herbart began a 
campaign which was directed at both content and method 
of education, especially elementary education. The Report 
of the Committee of Fifteen of the Department of Super- 
intendence of the National Education Association was an 
attempt to outline for the elementary schools of the country 
an organization of subject matter designed to accomplish 
through correlation those ends which the Herbartians set up 
in education. In this report, especially in the remarks of 
some of the dissenting members of the committee, are to be 
found a few lightning flashes indicating the storm of criticism 
which every aspect of elementary education was to face 
within the next quarter-century.

  228 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Conditions in 1897 
Described in terms of the average pupil (a method perhaps 
a little better than no description at all) the elementary 
school of a quarter-century ago was a rather pitiful institu- 
tion. The average pupil, whether boy or girl, attended a 
one-room school, and was taught by a young woman who 
had little if any training beyond the elementary subjects. 
During the term of about 140 days he spent 70 per cent of his 
time on the formal subjects, which were taught in a very 
mechanical manner. In all the subjects which he pursued, 
the idea of discipline was predominant. His spelling list 
had no close connection with the words he actually needed or 
would later need; nor did much of the arithmetic (mental 
or written), by which his mind was supposed to be trained, 
bear a vital relation to the kind of arithmetic which was 
characteristic of the society in which he lived. The reading 
which he studied was at best made up of fragments from the 
writings of the great, at worst of selections from the intel- 
lectual scrapheap of the ages. His practice in the art of 
penmanship was mostly futile because inadequately or 
wrongly directed. His study of the science of grammar did 
little to improve his use of his mother tongue or to increase 
his ability to understand the literature which he read, but 
did much to prevent him from developing an appreciation 
of that literature. His knowledge of geography and history 
was chiefly in the form of a skeleton from which some of the 
more important bones were missing. The school that he 
attended was supported almost entirely by local taxation, 
with a little aid from state taxes and the income of the public 
school fund. His teacher was probably as good as could be 
expected in view of the facts that her total income from her 
vocation was less than three hundred dollars a year, her 
tenure short, and her life ambition outside the field of 
teaching.
-P-A-G-E-245
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 229 
This picture may be supplemented by a study of extremes. 
If the child lived in a community where the best type of 
school was provided, he might enjoy a school year of approx- 
imately two hundred days, while his young fellow-citizen in 
a community of the poorest type could have the privilege 
for only three months. Teachers at the top of the scale had 
training that included not only elementary and secondary 
studies but higher and professional as well; while those at 
the other extreme could not boast of completing even the 
eight years of the elementary school. The richest type of 
curriculum included such studies as geography, history, 
literature, music, drawing, physical training, natural science, 
and even a foreign language. The poorest type, however, 
offered the mere rudiments of reading, writing, spelling, and 
arithmetic. In the better schools spelling was already under 
a process of adaptation to real needs; but in the poorer it 
was a hodgepodge of bizarre combinations of letters selected 
for their recognized difficulty. On the one hand, reading 
meant first-hand familiarity with classics suited to children ; 
on the other, it was a formal study of the fragmentary and 
the futile. In many of the cities, school buildings and 
equipment showed intelligent attention to health, con- 
venience, and usefulness; but in the poorest rural districts 
and in many small towns the buildings were but little better 
than cattle sheds, while the equipment was practically 
nothing. The teachers in even the most progressive com- 
munities had little security of tenure, while in the worst they 
were at the mercy of local politicians. A hundred dollars a 
month for nine or ten months of the year was within the 
reach of a few teachers. The same amount often represented 
the yearly income of others. 
Attendance 
The number of pupils attending elementary schools rose 
from slightly more than 15,000,000 in 1897 to about 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
20,000,000 in 1917. The average daily attendance increased 
from a little more than 10,000,000 to more than 15,000,000. 
The average length of school term expanded from 143 days 
to about 161 days. 
In 1897 there were compulsory attendance laws in 30 
states, one territory, and in the District of Columbia. The 
usual age of compulsory attendance was from 8 to 14; but 
the beginning age was 7 in several states, and the age of 
leaving 15 or 16 in a few. According to a study made by 
H. R. Bonner, Statistician of the United States Bureau of 
Education, there were in 1917-18 compulsory attendance 
laws of some kind in all the states. In some cases the 
enactments amounted to little because children were un- 
necessarily exempt or because there was no minimum school 
year, or because consecutive attendance was not required. 
Eighteen states required seven years’ attendance; twelve 
required six ; two required five ; eight, including the District 
of Columbia, required four. The nine other states made 
such liberal provisions for authorizing excuses that no 
definite term of years can be stated. In twenty-eight states 
attendance for the full term was required. This period 
varied from nine months in five states and the District of 
Columbia to three months in three states, and no minimum 
in six states. In twenty-five states an absence of one day or 
less constituted an infraction of the compulsory attendance 
laws. Two, three, four, and five days, respectively, con- 
stituted an infraction in other states. In nine, however, no 
provision was made in this matter. 
An important question in the enforcement of the com- 
pulsory laws is whether to base the requirements upon age 
or upon educational attainments. It is customary in a few 
states to exempt pupils from attendance if they have com- 
pleted a certain amount of school work. In twenty-four 
states there is no exemption for educational attainment. 
   
-P-A-G-E-247
ee ee ene Pd ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 231 
In twenty-two states, however, children who have completed 
the work of the elementary school may be exempt even 
though they have not reached the legal age. In two states 
pupils who have finished the fourth grade may be exempt. 
The strongest pressure for exemption comes because of the 
needs of industry. In sixteen states there is no requirement 
whatever for the granting of working papers. In fourteen 
these documents are issued to children who are able to read 
and write, while in only five are they denied to all who have 
not completed the elementary school course. In some cases, 
the applicant for working papers is required to show that he 
has attended school regularly either during the current year 
or during the preceding year. Eleven states make such 
requirements. Poverty as a cause of exemption from school 
attendance is recognized in several states ; there are, however, 
thirty-one which do not exempt children because of poverty 
or need of supporting themselves or dependents. 
Bonner gives a very effective presentation of the actual 
scope of compulsory attendance by showing the percentage 
of children who are affected by the application of the various 
phases of compulsory school laws. Five per cent of the 
children live in states having local option in regard to com- 
pulsory attendance; 22 per cent are in states which do not 
have truancy officers in all districts. Ten per cent are in 
states providing unnecessary exemptions. In the matter of 
the period of attendance, 65 per cent are in states not re- 
quiring seven years; 55 per cent, in states not requiring a 
full school term; 85 per cent, in states not requiring the 
nine-month minimum; 14 per cent, in states not requiring 
‘ consecutive attendance; 38 per cent, in states which make 
exemptions because of reaching educational standards; 86 
per cent are in states which issue permits to children who 
have not completed the elementary school ; 53 per cent live in 
states where the law is not enforced by the truant officer; 34  
-P-A-G-E-248
eee er ee eee 
232 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
per cent are in states in which it is not the function of the 
chief executive of the school to decide on permits to leave 
school to go to work. 
Selection and Organization of Subject Matter 
The twentieth century began with the influence of Pesta- 
lozzian ideas still strong not only in matters of method but 
also in many details of the organization, if not the selection, 
of subject matter. The psychological element in education 
stressed by the Pestalozzians received further emphasis 
from the advocates of certain ideas of Herbart and his 
followers; but the Report of the Committee of Fifteen did 
much to shift attention from the psychological to the socio- 
logical. As a result of differing points of view on the part of 
those who have worked at the readjustment of the subject 
matter of elementary education, together with the force of 
custom, the exigencies of school administration, the pressure 
of public opinion or of certain groups, and the general devel- 
opment and application of scientific methods, the past 
quarter-century has been a period of considerable confusion. 
The subject matter of the elementary school has been 
modified more or less by the application of principles which 
have not always mingled harmoniously. On the one hand, 
we see ideas which are chiefly psychological; on the other, 
theories and forces essentially social. The complete har- 
monization of the two points of view is still a matter for the 
administrator of the future. For the sake of simplicity of 
treatment, the two groups of ideas, although not mutually 
exclusive, will be treated separately, the psychological first. 
Although Pestalozzi finished his career in the early part of 
the nineteenth century and both Herbert Spencer’s advocacy 
of Pestalozzian ideas and the Oswego (Pestalozzian) move- 
ment came shortly after the middle of that century, the 
period covered in this study has been characterized by the
-P-A-G-E-249
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 233 
attempted application of much that the great Swiss educator 
taught. Among the ideas which have been more or less 
influential in the selection or the organization of subject 
matter are the following: 1. From the simple to the complex ; 
2. From the concrete to the abstract ; 3. From the empirical 
to the rational; 4. From experience to expression; 5. From 
particular experiences to general powers; 6. From the psy- 
chological to the logical. 
During the past two decades these ideas and their rather 
crude applications in the making of textbooks have been 
subjected to such criticism by psychologists and such 
pressure from various social conceptions of education that 
they have been reduced to a place of secondary importance. 
The simple has been interpreted not as the elements derived 
by logical analysis but rather as the familiar; or the process 
of individual development has been shown to involve going 
from a situation of complexity to one of simplicity through 
educative direction. The concrete and the abstract have 
been shown to be correlative rather than antipodal. The 
attempt to select subject matter for the purpose of devel- 
oping general powers has been given up or is held in abeyance 
until the psychologist can provide a more satisfactory basis 
for the application of the idea than is now possible. The 
idea of organizing subject matter according to the psycho- 
logical development of the learner is still of importance ; but 
its force is lessened by social demands, by the fact that many 
pupils are lost to the school through elimination before they 
have reached the stage of development most favorable to 
the assimilation of certain materials of social value, and by 
the needs of school administration. 
The emphasis of certain poetic aspects of the idea of 
evolution, interpreted chiefly by the disciples of Herbart, 
led to a wide vogue of the culture-epoch theory — the 
assumption that the mental growth of the individual child 
*
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
parallels the cultural evolution of the race just as his physical 
development is supposed to follow the lines of organic evo- 
lution. Although neither anthropologist nor ethnologist has 
been able to give a very definite picture of the evolution of 
culture nor the psychologist to agree with his fellow-workers 
in regard to the stages of child development, the culture- 
epoch theory has been used as a basis for the selection and 
organization of the materials of elementary education. Since 
the results have not been satisfactory enough to command 
general approval, the theory is now held only by those who 
seek in poetry or mysticism the foundations of education. 
Closely connected with the culture-epoch theory is another 
principle of organization which, although difficult of applica- 
tion, has found general acceptance — correlation. This 
principle is both psychological and sociological in its inter- 
pretation. From the one point of view, it demands that all 
kinds of learning experience shall be woven together by the 
establishment of vital connections; from the other, it calls 
for a close relationship between school work and the social 
life of the time. The attempt to apply the doctrine of 
correlation in school led to a more or less systematic search 
for those branches or ‘‘centers’”’ which could most profitably 
be used as the bases around which to group those elements 
that are vital in the development of the individual and in 
making him the kind of social being which society demands 
(concentration). Francis W. Parker, Charles De Garmo, 
Charles and Frank McMurry, and John Dewey were the 
leading American interpreters of the principles of correlation 
and concentration. 
Another Herbartian idea that has had and must have 
general application is that of apperception. Applied to the 
selection and organization of subject matter, it means that 
new ideas must be presented and built up through experiences 
already gained. Although apperception has no essential
-P-A-G-E-251
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 235 
connection with the practice of advancing more or less 
gradually from the easy to the difficult, general practice 
seems to have approved a combination of the two ideas. 
It seems clear, however, that as long as a large percentage of 
pupils drop out of school at an early age, social necessity may 
demand the mastery of certain materials regardless of diffi- 
culty. Such mastery cannot be secured, however, without 
the previous development of the necessary apperceptive 
masses. Geography, history, and civics have been the chief 
fields in which this conflict of ideas has appeared. 
In spite of the fact that the school is designed to be an 
institution for fitting the rising generation to live in the 
social environment of the present and future, the force which 
has been most powerful in determining subject matter is 
custom. New materials are introduced by current social 
pressure exercised by groups outside the school, as shown in 
Jessup’s study of Social Factors Affecting Special Supervision ; 
but once these materials are in they are likely to persist 
through the force of custom. Although it is probably true 
that the pressure of social groups is a crude indication of the 
demands of society, there is no likelihood that such a random 
presentation of demands will result in the proper selection or 
balance of the materials of instruction. Even though music, 
drawing, domestic science, manual training, and physical 
training have found their way into the elementary school 
through the determined efforts of special groups of people, 
there is no reason for believing that such an introduction of 
subjects means the proper selection of the most useful 
elements nor of their efficient organization for teaching and 
learning. 
Under the unorganized pressure of social forces, school 
students have recently been making systematic efforts to 
determine exactly what the school must do in order to meet 
the needs of social and individual life in the complex society 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
    236 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of the present. The course of study in spelling is determined 
by a study of the words actually used in correspondence. 
The amount and nature of the work in arithmetic is coming 
to depend upon the mathematical needs of the ordinary 
citizen of the present rather than upon the idea of using the 
subject as a ‘whetstone of the wits.” Both history and 
civics are now in process of being determined by a careful 
study of the needs of the present. 
The content of elementary education is continually being 
remade — not in the old fashion of introducing new subjects, 
bag and baggage, but rather in the newer mode of careful 
study of essential elements. Spelling offers the best example. 
We now inquire not concerning the subject as a whole, but 
rather concerning each word. We have even gone so far as 
to ask if this particular word shall be taught to this particular 
individual. The future will undoubtedly see much more of 
this careful analysis of subjects, judgment of social value, 
and study of individual needs. What has been done in the 
field of spelling by Thorndike, Ayres, Horn, Ashbaugh, Cook, 
Jones, and others will be attempted in other elementary 
school subjects. 
The general result of the attention recently given the 
subject matter of elementary education is the wide accept- 
ance of the idea that such content shall be provided as will 
afford a basis for mutual intercourse, mutual understanding, 
and mutual sympathy. As expressed in the first Report of 
the Committee on Minimum Essentials of Elementary School 
Subjects the fundamental basis for the selection of materials 
is the conception that “the function of the elementary school 
is to provide those educational opportunities necessary to 
insure, with the assistance of the other institutions of society, 
the acquisition on the part of elementary school children of 
those habits, skills, knowledges, ideals, and prejudices which 
must be made the common property of all, that each may
-P-A-G-E-253
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 237 
be an efficient member of a progressive democratic society, 
possessing the power of self-support and self-direction, the 
~ capacity and disposition for codperative effort, and, if 
possible, the ability to direct others in positions of respon- 
sibility requiring administrative ability.” 
A noteworthy attempt to weave into the program of the 
elementary school a wide variety of vital activities is that 
of Superintendent Wirt of Gary, Indiana. Although the 
mechanical aspect of his plan (that of having two schools in 
one building) has attracted most attention and has led to 
much discussion and imitation, it is probably true that the 
more important contribution of the Gary system is the 
development of a scheme of activities including work, study, 
and play. Dewey’s emphasis on occupational interests, the 
traditional stress of the literary and linguistic element, and 
the rapidly growing recognition of the importance of the 
recreational aspect of life, all find an attempted embodiment 
in the Gary plan. 
Methods of Instruction 
Although American elementary education has been and 
still is dominated by the textbook method of instruction, 
various attempts have been made to keep the use of books 
from degenerating into a mere memorization of words. 
Among such efforts may be mentioned the Pestalozzian 
object lesson; the Herbartian five formal steps; the devel- 
opment lesson (inductive or deductive) ; methods analytical, 
synthetical, rational, topical, logical, natural, experimental, 
and visual; the excursion; the problem; and the project. 
The Herbartian movement that was strong in the last decade 
of the nineteenth century did much to guide teachers toward 
the actual use of such important ideas as comprehension of 
subject matter; organization through comparison, contrast, 
and generalization ; building up of units of knowledge rather
-P-A-G-E-254
  238 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
than the collection of isolated facts; and the application of 
ideas. The recent attention given to method of teaching 
through use of problems and projects can be traced back 
directly to the Herbartians. The project is but the evolution 
of the type study; the problem, but the present outgrowth 
of the Herbartian use of induction and deduction. Progress 
has thus been made through the finer application or practical 
modification of details inherent or implied in the five formal 
steps. 
In contrast with the general methods of instruction men- 
tioned in the preceding paragraph is the attempt to discover 
the best technique of teaching each specific subject. The 
Eighteenth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of 
Education (of which Part II embodies the Fourth Report of 
the Committee on Economy of Time in Education) marks a 
very definite stage in the process of adding to knowledge of 
best general methods that specific knowledge that is essential to 
the best teaching of a given subject. Writing, reading, spell- 
ing, and drawing are the special subjects treated in this report. 
A method of class management which demands special 
mention because of its obvious relation to the present interest 
in preparation for group life is the socialized recitation. 
Pupils are encouraged to use freedom and initiative, while the 
teacher remains in the background instead of dominating 
obviously as in the ordinary class. In addition to the 
attention given the mastery of subject matter, much stress 
is laid upon the cultivation of right social attitudes and 
conduct. When combined with the use of problems or 
projects, the socialized recitation gives pupils a great oppor- 
tunity to think independently, to execute their own plans, 
to judge the results of their work, and to work with and for 
one another. 
An essential accompaniment of the efforts to improve 
methods of instruction is the development of standards of
-P-A-G-E-255
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 239 
achievement and instruments of measurement. One of the 
most striking developments of recent years is the invention of 
various tests and scales by which it is possible to measure 
the accomplishment of pupils and to a certain extent deter- 
mine both the quality of instruction and the extent to which 
the pupil is working up to his capacity as determined by 
intelligence tests. Tests or scales are now available in the 
following fields: reading (rate and comprehension), writing, 
spelling, arithmetic, grammar, drawing, English composition, 
sewing, history, and geography. Although these instruments 
of measurement are still in various degrees of crudeness and 
their refinement demands many years of work, they mark 
a stage of educational progress of greatest importance. 
Through their application both the method and the content 
of elementary education will be subjected to continual 
adjustment and improvement. 
Grading and Promotion 
The efforts to make improvements in the selection and 
organization of the subject matter of elementary education 
have had a parallel in the work of grading and promotion. 
Within the past few years a great amount of attention has 
been given to the fact that, although the work of the or- 
dinary elementary school is arranged on the apparent sup- 
position that the average pupil can proceed quite regularly 
in the consecutive completion of eight one-year units or 
sixteen half-year units, the actual distribution of pupils 
through the grades shows a great deal of maladjustment, 
that is, failure of pupils to progress according to the outlined 
arrangement of subject matter. Studies by Ayres, Thorn- 
dike, and Strayer showed that pupils were not only retarded 
but also eliminated in tremendous numbers. Strayer, for 
example, discovered that in 133 cities of 25,000 or over, 38 
per cent of boys and 32 per cent of girls were over age; that
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
in 186 cities of less than 25,000 the figures for boys were 
88 per cent and for girls 36 per cent ; while only about 4 per 
cent of the pupils in either group were under age. It was 
also revealed that the schools held pupils quite well until the 
age of eleven or twelve, but that after that there was a very 
large amount of elimination. Strayer estimated that about 
90 per cent of pupils ‘‘have done the work indicated by being 
found in the fourth grade, 80 per cent of them have reached 
the fifth grade, 70 per cent the sixth grade, 55 per cent the 
seventh grade, 40 per cent the eighth grade, 35 per cent the 
first year of high school.” 
Obviously the situation called for some plan for better 
adjustment. Several schemes tried in various places will 
here be mentioned, not because they have had wide use — 
we are still in the stage of rigid grading with annual or semi- 
annual promotion — but because they indicate a realization 
of the weaknesses of our present system and display definite 
efforts to overcome them. 
Early in the last decade of the nineteenth century, P. W. 
Search, Superintendent of Schools in Pueblo, made an effort 
to adjust progress through school to the capacities of the 
pupil by an arrangement which made it possible for each child 
to proceed at his own rate, regardless of the speed of others. 
In some places this plan was modified by adjusting progress 
to the capacity of several groups in a class, each group being 
composed of pupils of about the same capacity. In the San 
Francisco Normal School, Jesse D. Burks improved the 
Pueblo plan by a division of subject matter into units. Su- 
perintendent Washburne of Winnetka, Illinois, proceeded 
to a higher stage by the establishment of achievement units. 
In contrast with the Pueblo plan of breaking up a class 
into individual units is the Batavia system. Under the 
direction of Superintendent Kennedy, a scheme was here 
evolved by which special attention was given to the slower  
-P-A-G-E-257
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 241 
pupils, by the regular teacher if the class was small, by a 
second teacher when the class exceeded fifty innumber. The 
reverse of this system is found in the North Denver plan, 
according to which special attention is given the brighter 
pupils. 
The new Cambridge plan consists of such an arrangement 
as will provide a basal course of eight years with a parallel 
course of six years. Promotions are made three times a year. 
It is thus possible for the gifted pupil to proceed rapidly, 
while the mediocre or dull pupils advance at a slower pace. 
Failure of promotion means the loss of only a third of a year 
instead of a longer period, necessary when promotions are 
made annually or semi-annually. The Portland, Oregon, 
plan-is much the same as that of Cambridge, but has the 
advantage of readjustment without loss every year and a 
half. 
The differentiated-course plan is still another attempt to 
adjust the school to the capacities of its pupils. The fun- 
damental idea is to have all normal pupils advance evenly 
through the first six grades. Then differentiation of courses 
and promotion by subjects are introduced with the idea of 
such adjustment as will retain pupils and advance them 
regularly. As this plan was worked out in Santa Barbara, 
California, it provided for the first six grades three parallel 
courses with varying amounts of work. Each was adapted 
to the capacities of a group — the slow, the average, or the 
gifted. In Baltimore, under Superintendent Van Sickle, 
the differentiated-course plan was modified in such a way as 
to provide a number of central schools in which gifted pupils, 
with the consent of their parents, were given a greatly en- 
riched course for grades seven to ten inclusive, and in which 
they completed the work of these four grades in three years. 
The attention which has been given nonpromotion, 
elimination, and rapid advancement has resulted in a re-
-P-A-G-E-258
242 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
duction of retardation and an increase of acceleration. The 
results may be due to better selection and organization of 
subject matter, to improved methods of teaching, to greater 
conscientiousness on the part of teachers, to better systems 
of grading and promotion, or to advancement from grade to 
grade regardless of accomplishment. Whatever the cause or 
causes, improvement seems to be shown by the figures pre- 
sented in recent statistical reports. 
  The Teaching Staff 
The most certain method of improving the quality of 
elementary education is through selection and training of 
teachers. A recognition of this principle is shown in the 
tendency toward centralization of the certificating authority 
in state departments of education. In 1898 there were only 
three state systems which issued all certificates ; there were 
twenty-six in 1919. Further evidence of recognition of the 
principle is found in the fact that in 1898 there were but 
twenty-nine states that recognized professional training for 
the granting of one or more certificates while there were 
forty-seven in 1919. These facts, however, are subject to 
some discount because of the practice of many states in 
issuing lowest grade certificates to persons who have only 
to pass examinations, no definite academic or professional 
training being prescribed. In 1919 there were twenty-nine 
such states. Seven others prescribed some professional 
course; five required graduation from high school; three 
demanded graduation from high school and professional 
training with or in addition to high school courses; and 
four set a standard of graduation from high school and pro- 
fessional courses of higher grade varying from six weeks to 
ayear. Although the examination method of certification 
generally makes it possible for persons of very low attain- 
ments to enter the field of teaching, there has been, according 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 243, 
to information secured by the United States Bureau of 
Education, ‘‘a growing importance of professional subjects 
and the addition of such subjects as agriculture, music, and 
physical education.” 
The most striking phenomenon in the recent development 
of the training of elementary teachers is the rapid rise of 
teacher training in high schools. Twenty-one states (1919) 
have established teacher-training classes or normal training 
work in high schools or in connection with high schools and 
recognize this training in their certification laws or regulations 
as fulfilling the requirements for some grade of certificate. 
Most commonly such courses are a part of the regular four- 
year course ; occasionally an additional year is required. 
In spite of the growth of the normal training work of high 
schools, and all that normal schools and teachers’ colleges 
have been able to do, the elementary teachers of the country 
are still on a very low level of training. An accurate state- 
ment is not possible, but probably two thirds are altogether 
without the development which is to be secured through 
professional courses in normal school, college, or even high 
school. Teachers with the best preparation are to be found 
in the cities; with the poorest in the country. 
From three rather comprehensive studies,! it is possible 
to give a fair picture of some of the facts concerning teachers 
in country schools. Conditions in three widely separated 
states (Alabama, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania) are similar 
in regard to the unsatisfactory training, experience, and 
tenure of rural teachers. The number of teachers who have 
had only an elementary school education is 16 per cent in 
Alabama, 4 per cent in Nebraska, and 25 per cent in Penn- 
sylvania. The lack of professional training is indicated by 
1 Bulletins of U. 8. Bureau of Education: 1919, No. 41, An Educational 
Study of Alabama; 1919, No. 20, The Rural Teacher of Nebraska; and 1921, 
No. 34, Status of the Rural Teacher in Pennsylvania.
-P-A-G-E-260
244 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the following figures, which show the percentage of teachers 
who entered upon their work without any such preparation : 
63.6 per cent in Alabama, 70 per cent in Nebraska, and 
76 per cent in Pennsylvania. The dolefulness of these 
figures is mitigated somewhat by the fact that there seems 
to be an increasing number of beginners who enter teaching 
after at least a little professional training. So long as many 
states permit entrance by way of the examination route with 
only academic subjects prescribed, it is not likely that the 
evil conditions now existent will be changed. The spread of 
the practice of consolidating rural schools promises such a 
demand for teachers of superior training that the future of 
the untrained teacher seems to be limited to those schools 
that are small, poverty-stricken, and lacking in ideals of 
excellence. 
  Past Progress and Present Problems 
Within the past twenty-five years much has been done to 
enrich the conception of the aims of elementary education. 
It is now coming to be generally accepted that the function 
of the elementary school is not merely to give pupils pos- 
session of the tools of learning — the three R’s — but to 
provide the content necessary to a common basis of national 
life. Consequently, great enrichment of materials is offered 
in the elementary school. Much has been done also in the 
selection and organization of content, and better textbooks 
have been provided. In the methods of instruction, an 
increasing desire for improvement has led to many changes 
by making the processes of instruction better adapted to the 
capacity of the pupils. In general, it may be said also that 
a milder discipline has been characteristic of the period. 
Although no very great general changes have come in grading 
and promotion, it is true that many attempts to break up the 
lockstep and to provide a kind of organization that will be
-P-A-G-E-261
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 245 
adapted to all kinds of pupils have been made. It may 
be safely said that although the quality of teachers still 
leaves much to be desired, there has been considerable 
improvement. The average length of school year has 
increased. Attendance is vastly larger than a quarter- 
century ago. Compulsory attendance laws are as a rule 
better, although it cannot be said that we have yet reached 
a very high level of law enforcement in this particular. 
Great progress has been made in rural education through 
consolidation of districts and the consequent possibilities of 
giving richer content, having better buildings and equipment, 
and securing better teachers. The most striking phase of 
improvement of the past quarter-century is that of securing 
objective measures of results of instruction. The develop- 
ment of standard tests and scales will undoubtedly be con- 
sidered one of the greatest achievements of this period. 
The greatest problem of national education at the present 
time is the equalization of opportunity. Present inequalities 
demand the solution of a complex problem that involves at 
least the following elements: an increase in the average 
length of the school term; the improvement of compulsory 
attendance laws to decrease considerably the percentage of 
school term lost through absence or nonattendance; better 
training of teachers ; great increases in the salaries of elemen- 
tary teachers; finding bases of taxation which will provide 
more money for the support of schools with a resulting 
increase in the amount of money available for each pupil 
enrolled; the elimination of all child labor that interferes 
with school work. 
The problems of the content of elementary education 
involve the discovery of more adequate methods of deter- 
mining what ought to be taught, the further elimination of 
useless or relatively useless subject matter, and the improved 
organization of the courses of study. A particularly inviting  
-P-A-G-E-262
  246 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
field is that of study of the methods of instruction. Although 
considerable progress has been made in developing the 
technique of investigation, much still remains to be done 
before we can adequately measure various practices and 
proposed innovations. The solution of the problem of 
adapting instruction to individual needs and capacities is 
still to be found, and with it the elimination of the evil 
effects of systems of organization essential in handling large 
numbers of pupils. 
The promise of development in the field of elementary 
education is great. The growth of courses in elementary 
education and supervision in universities and the increasing 
number of experimental schools furnish evidence that the 
future will see no lack of attempts to apply scientific methods 
to the study of this field. The present insistent demand for 
national attention to education is based largely upon a 
realization of the need of such an equalization of opportu- 
nities for elementary education as will provide throughout 
the nation a citizenry trained in the elementary tools of 
learning and socialized by training in the elements of good 
citizenship. The work of the future is tremendous, but 
present interest and enthusiasm indicate that it will surely 
be accomplished.

Introduction 
An outstanding feature in the educational history of recent 
years is the development of the American secondary school. 
Within the past three decades, and especially within the 
past ten or fifteen years, secondary education in America 
has undergone changes of great significance, involving in 
their quantitative aspects a remarkable increase in the 
facilities afforded and in the number of persons brought 
within the influence of the secondary school, and in their 
qualitative aspects important modifications in the character 
of the education provided. It is the-purpose of this chapter 
briefly to consider the more significant phases of development 
in secondary education within the past three decades. 
Schools and Enrollments 
The most significant fact in the development of education 
in America during the past quarter of a century is the re- 
markable growth of secondary schools and the great in- 
crease of attendance thereat. Complete and wholly reliable 
statistics are lacking and probably never will be available. 
Nevertheless, a general idea of the development of secondary 
schools since 1890 may be gained from figures for schools 
reporting to the United States Bureau of Education. Such 
figures are presented in the table on page 252. 
From 1890 to 1918 (the latest year for which comparable 
figures are available) the number of public high schools 
reporting to the Bureau of Education increased from 2771 to

This table was derived from data given in the Biennial Survey of Education, 
1916-18, Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1919, No. 91, pp. 127-128, 310; and the Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1917, Vol. II, p. 511. 
Public high school figures for the earlier years are less complete and less reli- 
able than those for later years. Figures for private high schools are less com- 
plete and less reliable than those for public high schools. Figures for grades 
corres Done ny to the four upper grades of the high schools only are considered 
in this table. 
13,951, and the total number of secondary schools (public 
and private) increased from 4485 to 16,009. Within that 
period one public high school was established for every day 
in the calendar years included — a gain of over 450 per cent 
from 1890 to 1918. Reliable evidence indicates that to-day 
there are more than 16,500 secondary schools in the United 
States. 
Even more striking and significant is the great increase in 
enrollments at secondary schools from 1890 to 1918. In 1890 
the enrollment in public high schools reporting to the Bureau 
of Education was 202,963, and the combined enrollment of
-P-A-G-E-269
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 253 
public and private secondary schools was 297,894. In 
1918 the figures for enrollments were, in public high schools, 
1,645,171 and in public and private secondary schools 
1,803,916. This means that the number of pupils reported 
in attendance at public high schools increased more than 
700 per cent from 1890 to 1918, and that the total number of 
secondary school pupils increased more than 500 per cent. 
With allowance for increase in population, it means that for 
each thousand of the total population the number of sec- 
ondary school pupils increased from 4.7 in 1890 to 17.1 in 
1918—7.e., secondary school enrollments increased more than 
two and one half times as fast as the population increased. 
Doubtless by this time (1923 — five years later) the total 
enrollment in secondary schools has passed the 2,000,000 
mark. 
This is certainly a very remarkable development. Its 
meaning should in some respects be clear. First of all, it 
means that a much larger proportion of our citizenry is re- 
ceiving some amount and some kind of secondary education, 
and presumably that the average level of trained intelligence 
has been raised measurably within the past quarter of a 
century. Second, it means that the group of pupils now 
attending the secondary school constitutes a far more 
heterogeneous body in capacities, economic or social status, 
and educational needs than was the secondary school 
clientele of 1890 or 1900. Third, it means that new and 
diversified demands have been made on the secondary school. 
Fourth, it means that problems of financial support have 
become increasingly important and difficult. Fifth, it means 
that within a very short space of time the secondary school 
has had to make many important and difficult adjustments — 
demands which could not be met adequately within the brief 
period of such an extraordinary development. It may safely 
be prophesied that it will take at least a generation to meet
-P-A-G-E-270
  254 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
at all adequately adjustments already demanded by the 
changed character of the secondary school clientele. 
Of some special interest and importance is the status of 
nonpublic secondary schools and their relation to public 
education within the past three decades. Until well into 
the later half of the nineteenth century nonpublic schools 
were dominant in the field of secondary education in the 
United States and their influence was very strong even to the 
end of the century. In 1890 reports to the Bureau of 
Education indicated that more than one third of all sec- 
ondary schools were nonpublic and that those schools 
enrolled nearly one third of all secondary school pupils. 
In 1918 the proportion of nonpublic secondary schools had 
decreased to about one eighth (12.9 per cent) and their 
enrollments had decreased to about one twelfth (8.8 per cent) 
of the total secondary school enrollment. Clearly, develop- 
ments of the past three decades have established the dom- 
inance of the public high school in the field of secondary 
education. Clearly, too, its favorable status in this respect 
is due to the fact that in recent years, with all its youthful 
defects and shortcomings, the public secondary school is 
more and more nearly meeting the demands of American 
society. 
Programs and Curricula 
No less significant than the quantitative development 
above outlined is the qualitative development of secondary 
education during the past quarter of a century, especially 
as far as the public high school is concerned. In 1890, and 
for the most part until well beyond 1900, the American sec- 
ondary school was an institution almost wholly academic 
in character; its program in most cases being limited to 
English, foreign languages, mathematics, natural sciences, 
and history, and its curricula being organized almost wholly
-P-A-G-E-271
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 255 
on the basis of differing combinations of these studies. This 
is clearly shown in the Report of the Committee (of Ten) on 
Secondary School Studies in 1893, and is reflected in the 
Report of the Committee on College Entrance Requirements 
in 1899. 
At various times during the nineteenth century (in part as 
inheritances from the omnibus academy movement) various 
nonacademic studies had found a somewhat precarious 
place in some secondary schools, and during the last quarter 
of the century ‘commercial’? (clerical) education, manual 
training, and some technical studies had established them- 
selves in a few of the larger schools. Prior to 1900, however, 
clerical studies were the only nonacademic subjects that 
were at all common in public high schools. 
The extension of secondary school programs to include 
nonacademic studies and other significant changes in the 
program were largely developments of the twentieth century. 
Most of the characteristics of programs and curricula of the 
modern secondary school have manifested . themselves 
generally within the past ten or fifteen years, significant 
changes following four somewhat different, though somewhat 
related, lines: (1) the introduction of new fields of study, 
é.g., agriculture, home economics, and vocational studies in 
general; (2) the introduction of new subjects in fields 
already represented in the program, e¢.g., community civics, 
music other than general chorus work; (3) the introduction 
of subjects new in the sense that they represent a reorgani- 
zation or realignment of subject matter and method, e.g., 
general science, introductory mathematics; (4) the modifi- 
cations of certain subjects with reference to their application 
in special fields, e.g., household chemistry, economic geog- 
raphy. In addition, it should be mentioned that several 
studies, formerly common in secondary school programs, 
have practically disappeared, eg., Greek, astronomy,
-P-A-G-E-272
    256 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
geology. And finally, it should be noted that many of 
the older subjects have undergone such changes in content 
or method that they constitute educational instruments 
noticeably different from subjects bearing the same titles a 
decade or two ago. 
Particular importance attaches to the development of 
practical arts and vocational education during the later part 
of the period under consideration. While its beginnings can 
be traced well back in the history of the American secondary 
school, it was not until the twentieth century that practical 
arts education began to make general progress in the public 
secondary school, and it was not until after 1910 that real 
vocational education established itself at all generally in the 
public high school. Before 1915 several states had entered 
on a comprehensive program for the development of voca- 
tional education, but the most significant step was taken in 
1917 when by the Smith-Hughes Act the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education was established and federal funds were 
provided for the encouragement and support of vocational 
education in trade, agricultural, and home economics sub- 
jects. That act marked the beginning of federal participa- 
tion in the support and control of secondary education. 
What its final results will be only time can tell, but there 
can be no doubt that it has already afforded a powerful 
stimulus for the development of vocational education. 
Along with changes in the program of studies in the 
secondary school have gone changes in curricula and in the 
policies of curriculum organization. The curricula recom- 
mended by the Committee of Ten in 1893 are typical of sec- 
ondary school curricula and illustrate the policies of curric- 
ulum organization which obtained during the last part of the 
nineteenth century and, for the most part, during the first 
decade of the twentieth century. They comprised (1) the 
Classical Course, (2) the Latin-Scientific Course, (3) the
-P-A-G-E-273
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 257 
Modern Language Course, and (4) the English Course — 
curricula which included academic studies only and which 
were differentiated solely on the basis of varying combina- 
tions or proportions of those subjects, as implied by the titles 
given the “‘courses.”’ 
In the light of our revised conceptions of the functions to 
be performed by the public secondary schools, the defects of 
such curricula are obvious; particularly the limitation of 
the curricula to academic studies, their evident dominance 
by the college preparatory function, the failure to recognize 
the factor of elimination, and their differentiation on the 
basis of predominant academic subjects rather than on the 
basis of the different activities of life to which various 
groups of pupils will apply their education. But, in spite of 
their numerous defects, the curricula recommended by the 
Committee of Ten were accepted generally throughout the 
country. Until well after 1900 the Committee’s recommen- 
dations practically determined high school curricula in most 
communities, and it was not until well into the second decade 
of the present century that newer policies of curriculum 
organization gained any general acceptance. Even now the 
older organization is to be found in many high schools, per- 
haps in a majority of high schools. 
What are these new policies of curriculum organization? 
Among others they involve the following significant features : 
(1) curricula based on as wide a variety of studies as is 
justified by the capacities and needs of the pupils concerned 
and the ability of the community to provide them, with 
proper regard for reasonable economy in support and for 
efficient instruction ; (2) curricula in each of which adequate 
attention is paid to the proper balance of aims and functions 
in secondary education; (3) curricula so organized that as 
far as possible each pupil may secure the maximum of benefit 
according to the amount and character of his study, with due
-P-A-G-E-274
258 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
  recognition of the fact that most pupils will not complete 
the full secondary school course; (4) curricula organized 
with as much flexibility as possible so that necessary re- 
adjustments can be made by the pupil with a minimum of 
loss; (5) curriculum differentiation based on significant 
differences in the careers for which various groups of pupils 
are preparing themselves. 
While all the above-mentioned changes in programs and 
curricula are observable in the history of secondary education 
in the past quarter of a century, it would be a serious mistake 
to assume that they are complete. Such is far from being the 
case. Rather we may confidently expect that those changes 
will be in progress for many years to come. 
Teachers 
Among the serious problems in part created by the rapid 
increase of secondary schools and of secondary school enroll- 
ments during the past three decades was and still is the 
problem of an adequate number of teachers properly 
equipped. At the highest reasonable estimate the number 
of secondary school teachers in 1890 did not exceed 25,000. 
In 1922 the number was probably not less than 100,000. At 
present the annual increase in new teaching positions and the 
requirements for replacements demand about 15,000 new 
secondary school teachers each year. 
At no time during the past quarter of a century has there 
been available for secondary schools an adequate supply of 
well-educated teachers; and the available supply of well- 
trained secondary school teachers was and is relatively 
insignificant. As a matter of fact, professional preparation 
for secondary school teachers was all but unknown before 
1900 and represents one of the important developments of 
the past decade or two. Since 1900, and more noticeably 
since 1910, professional training for secondary school teachers
-P-A-G-E-275
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 259 
has been provided in most collegiate institutions and has 
received definite recognition in the certificating laws of most 
states. It is possible that increased facilities for the training 
of secondary school teachers and the development of pro- 
fessional consciousness can soon overcome the instability of 
the teaching staff. Whether this is true or not, the future 
alone can determine. For some time certainly the problem 
of supplying an adequate number of well-trained secondary 
school teachers must be a vital one. Until it is solved, 
secondary education in America must be of inferior quality. 
At present it must be recognized that the average level of 
classroom instruction in the American secondary school is 
relatively low. 
Instruction 
During the past two or three decades many factors created 
the need for changes in the organization of subject matter 
and in methods of instruction. Among the most important 
of these were the following: (1) changes in the character of 
the secondary school clientele; (2) the introduction of new 
subjects of study ; (3) reorganization in grades seven to nine ; 
(4) developments in the field of educational psychology, 
especially with respect to the laws of learning, the psychology 
of individual differences, the nature and measurement of 
intelligence; (5) the disclosure of prevailing defects by 
means of objective measurement; (6) changes in our con- 
ception, of the functions to be performed by the secondary 
school. 
How far and in what ways have these and other factors 
resulted in real changes in secondary school instruction? 
Far more than appears on the surface and far less than might 
appear to be the case to one judging on the basis of educa- 
tional literature. Far more than one might expect from the 
recent development of controlling factors, but far less than
-P-A-G-E-276
260 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
  must be the case eventually if instruction is to meet the 
demands created within recent years. Here the limitations 
of space do not permit any extended analysis of changing 
instruction. It must suffice to point out some of the more 
significant tendencies observable. 
(1) The most noticeable changes in instruction are those 
which involve better recognition of the factor of individual 
differences. In 1900 secondary school instruction in any 
given subject was practically the same for all pupils regard- 
less of their capacities and needs. A uniform and stereo- 
typed methodology prevailed, for the most part determined 
by the needs of college preparation. Since that time there 
has been a growing tendency to organize content and method 
as far as possible in terms of the varying capacities and 
needs of the particular group of pupils concerned in any 
given class. 
(2) Not less significant is the tendency to reduce the 
emphasis on formal values and to emphasize the functional 
in content and method. This tendency is observable to a 
greater or less extent in almost every field of secondary school 
instruction. Examples of it are found in the substitution of 
functional for formal English grammar, in the direct method 
of teaching a foreign language, in general science and in the 
applied sciences, in introductory mathematics and applied 
mathematics, in community civics and modern methods of 
teaching history, and, of course, in all practical and voca- 
tional studies. 
(8) Closely related to the tendency to emphasize func- 
tional values, if not really a part of it, is the tendency to 
emphasize social values in secondary school instruction — 
“to socialize”’ secondary education. On the side of content 
this means emphasis on materials according to their social 
importance. On the side of method it means emphasis on 
coéperative activity and the creation of classroom situations
-P-A-G-E-277
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 261 
which as far as possible stimulate actual situations in life 
and provide social experience. 
(4) A fourth tendency observable is that which involves 
a reorganization of subject matter and method in terms of 
the laws of learning, instead of in terms of the scientific 
arrangement as viewed by the specialist. This is especially 
noticeable in community civics, general science, and intro- 
ductory mathematics, but it may be observed more or less 
in most fields of secondary school instruction. 
(5) Closely related to this is the tendency to reorganize 
subject matter and method so as to subordinate deferred 
values and make each unit of study of value to the pupil in 
terms of the amount and quality of his study. Formerly, 
for example, the pupil’s first year of study in a foreign lan- 
guage was devoted primarily and almost exclusively to 
forms, syntax, and vocabulary; his use of the language for 
reading, writing, or speaking being deferred to later years, 
so that if he proceeded no further, he had acquired little 
except some knowledge of the anatomy of the language. 
Modern methods aim to provide him with a use of the lan- 
guage proportionate to the amount and quality of its study. 
(6) Motivation has always been and always must be an 
important element in instruction. Nevertheless, its im- 
portance has been emphasized further in recent years by the 
fact that in increasing numbers pupils without special in- 
terests or ambitions have entered the secondary schools. 
Hence there is observable in recent years a tendency further 
to recognize the factor of motivation. This is evidenced by 
increased emphasis on diagnosis and guidance in and through 
the organization of instruction, as well as by the develop- 
ment of certain somewhat special methods, e.g., the project 
method. 
These rather general tendencies have been incorporated 
more or less in some special methods of instruction. Thus
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
“supervised study”’ emphasizes the factor of individual dif- 
ferences and laws of learning. Thus the “project method” 
emphasizes the factor of individual differences, the laws of 
problem-solving, functional values, motivation, and social 
values. Thus the ‘‘socialized recitation” stresses individual 
differences and social values. And finally, many of these 
tendencies are involved in such comprehensive schemes of 
reorganization as are represented in the Dalton Plan. 
While all these tendencies in instruction are observable in 
modern practice, it is not to be supposed that they are 
universally, or even generally, present. It is not to be 
expected that new theories can at once find their way into 
general practice, and it would be absurd to expect that the 
rapid developments of the past ten or fifteen years would be 
represented generally in secondary school practice at this 
early date. The translation of general theory into special 
practice in the classroom is a difficult and time-requiring 
process. New textbooks must be prepared, teachers must 
become acquainted with the new ideas, and, not least in some 
cases, the public must gradually be educated to accept new 
doctrines. It will take many years for classroom instruction 
to catch up with the demands of the present. 
Extension Downward and Upward 
Since 1910 the scope of secondary education has been 
extended downward by the junior high school movement and 
(less generally) has been extended upward by the junior 
college movement. . 
Before 1900 several proposals (notably those of the Com- 
mittee of Ten in 1893) had been made to reorganize the 
school system so as to provide six grades of elementary 
education and six grades of secondary education. Prior to 
1910 some beginnings had been made to put those proposals 
into practice, but at that date there probably existed less
-P-A-G-E-279
  SECONDARY EDUCATION 263 
than twenty-five six-grade public high schools in the coun- 
try and few of those really represented the type which has 
developed during the past decade. After 1910, however, 
the development of reorganized systems proceeded rapidly, 
the reorganization usually taking the form of elementary 
schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools on a six- 
three-three, a six-two-four, or a six-six plan. By 1918 the 
reorganization had developed so rapidly that a somewhat 
selective estimate by the Bureau of Education indicated five 
hundred and fifty-seven junior high schools reported. In 
1922 probably more than one thousand communities had 
provided reorganized school systems involving junior high 
schools. It is impossible to say how many systems have 
been reorganized otherwise than with respect to adminis- 
trative divisions and grade combinations, but to an increasing 
extent in recent years there have been manifest elements of 
real reorganization in the actual education provided. 
The earlier proposals for reorganization were concerned 
primarily with plans for an earlier beginning and a longer 
period of secondary education of the sort already represented 
in the high school, and the proposers were actuated in large 
part by ideas of a longer period of preparation for college. 
Later proposals, however, and those which have been 
effective in developing the junior high schools, were in 
keeping with our changed conceptions of the functions of 
secondary education and emphasized a different kind of 
education rather than a downward extension of the second- 
ary education previously provided. They involved pri- 
marily: (1) a broader and richer type of education in grades 
seven, eight, and nine; (2) earlier and better provision for 
individual differences; (3) a better articulation between 
elementary* and secondary education; (4) provision for 
educational diagnosis and guidance; (5) recognition of the 
factor of elimination; (6) economy of time in education.
-P-A-G-E-280
  264 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
In the reorganization, administrative divisions and grade 
combinations gain their importance because they are neces- 
sary in order to carry through the real reorganization of 
education. The greatest danger at present is that the real 
reorganization, necessary and intended, may be lost sight of 
in the reorganization of administrative divisions. 
Less general has been the upward extension of the sec- 
ondary school so as to provide ‘‘post-graduate”’ study of a 
type generally comparable to or practically paralleling the 
first two years of college work. For the most part the 
junior college movement has developed since 1910, though 
some beginnings were to be found before that date, and the 
first specific law for junior colleges was passed by the Cali- 
fornia legislature in 1907. Since 1910 several junior col- 
leges have been established in connection with public high 
schools, but as yet the movement has gained headway in a 
few states only. 
This upward extension of the public high school has been 
due to several factors, among which the most important are: 
(1) a great increase in the number of persons desiring and 
deserving an education beyond the high school; (2) the 
consequent overcrowding of many colleges; (3) the demand 
for facilities of higher education nearer the homes of pupils 
and not involving the expense of living away from home; 
(4) a need for better instruction in the earlier college grades ; 
(5) changing conceptions of the functions of secondary and 
collegiate education. Nevertheless, there are practical 
reasons for believing that the movement will not become 
general for junior colleges attached to public high schools, 
the most important reason being that they are economically 
1 Reference here is limited to junior colleges operated in immediate con- 
nection with public high schools. Independent junior colleges or those at- 
tached to a state university are primarily a college problem, not a secondary 
school problem.
-P-A-G-E-281

justifiable in the larger cities only. If organized as regional 
schools, they become essentially collegiate institutions with 
quite different relations to secondary education proper. 
In most communities there is far greater need for the im- 
provement of our present schools than there is for its ex- 
pansion to include two additional grades. 
Changing Conceptions 
Along with all the changes previously mentioned and 
related to them, in part as cause, in part as effect, have 
come fundamentally important changes in our conceptions 
of the functions to be performed by the secondary schools. 
During the past quarter of a century especially, our concep- 
tions of the functions of secondary education have changed 
from those dominated by selective ideals to those which 
postulate that the opportunities of secondary education 
should be made available for each citizen according to his 
needs, capacities, and willingness to make the necessary 
efforts. This is a profoundly significant change and de- 
serves some special consideration. 
Throughout its history, secondary education in all coun- 
tries has been dominated by the conception that it is suitable 
and desirable for those only who, by virtue of social, eco- 
nomic, or intellectual superiority, can be expected to as- 
sume positions of leadership in life. The selective ideal 
still dominates secondary education in almost all countries, 
certainly in most European countries. In its beginning 
secondary education in America inherited the prevailing 
selective functions of Europe, and, in spite of various tend- 
encies of the academy and early high school movements, 
those selective functions persisted and dominated secondary 
education im America throughout the nineteenth century. 
Needless to say, they are still dominant in many parts of 
the country and still obtain in the minds of many citizens.

Nevertheless, they are manifestly giving ground to broader 
functions. 
In the last decade of the nineteenth century (at the be- 
ginning of the period under consideration in this chapter) 
the American secondary school was organized and adminis- 
tered on the basis of the traditional conception that second- 
ary education was suitable and desirable for those only who, 
because of social and economic status or by virtue of intel- 
lectual* superiority and ambition, looked forward to the 
higher professions and to careers of leadership. At that 
time it was not expected that the average child should 
attend the high school, but, for the most part, it was taken as 
a matter of course that he should leave school after receiving 
a “common school education.’’ The high school was still 
considered as something of an educational luxury to be in- 
dulged in only by those whose superior social and economic 
status permitted opportunity for leisure and ‘‘culture,”’ or 
whose capacities and ambitions justified higher training. 
As long as the selective conception and the ideal of train- 
ing for leadership dominated both secondary education and 
higher education, it was inevitable that the two institutions 
should be closely related and it was but natural that second- 
ary education should be viewed primarily in terms of college 
preparation. In any event it is certain that preparation for 
college dominated the American secondary school through- 
out the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, it should be 
noted that the character of both institutions and of the re- 
lation between the two was a natural result of the selective 
conception. As long as the selective ideal dominated the 
secondary school and the college, preparation for the latter 
was bound seriously to condition the former. The result 
was a vicious circle. As long as preparation for college 
determined the character of the secondary school, the tend- 
ency was for those only to attend the secondary school who
-P-A-G-E-283
  
SECONDARY EDUCATION 267 
expected to go to college or who desired the kind of education 
typified by college preparation. Likewise, as long as those 
attended the secondary school who needed or desired the 
college preparation sort of education, that was the sort of 
education to be provided for them. This is manifest in the 
Report of the Committee (of Ten) on Secondary School Studies 
in 1893 and in the Report of the Committee on College Entrance 
Requirements in 1899. 
No significant movement ever develops overnight, and it 
is seldom, if ever, possible to set an exact date to mark the 
beginning of a new movement. Certainly it would be im- 
possible to set any exact dates for changes in our conceptions 
of the functions of secondary education. Doubtless they 
began well back in the nineteenth century, or even in the 
eighteenth century. Probably, indeed, they are to be 
associated with long-developing changes in the whole theory 
and organization of American society. Nevertheless, we can 
rightly say that the last quarter of a century has been 
marked by an increasing manifestation of changed concep- 
tions of the functions of secondary education. 
Within that period the increased patronage of the sec- 
ondary school shows clearly that people have ceased to look 
on it as an educational luxury to be reserved for the few. 
It is clear that at present the secondary school is looked 
upon as an integral part of the school system, to be attended 
by children with little reference to social, economic, or intel- 
lectual status. Whether we would wish it or not, the fact 
must be faced that the character of the secondary school 
clientele at present necessitates the abandonment of the 
former conception of the selective function of secondary 
education. Developments of the past quarter-century have 
necessitated the substitution of selection by differentiation 
for the former selection by elimination and restricted 
instruction.
-P-A-G-E-284
  
268 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Both in our changing conceptions of secondary education 
and in changing practice there are to be noted three some- 
what separate, yet somewhat overlapping, stages: (1) the 
change to a conception that education above the elementary 
school should be provided for pupils other than those going 
to college; (2) the change from a limited academic education 
for all to differentiated studies suited to varying social and 
economic needs; (3) the change from a type of instruction 
(subject matter and method) geared up to require a relatively 
high level of intelligence to instruction adapted to varying 
capacities. 
The first of these changes was under way by the close of 
the nineteenth century. The second received great impetus 
in the past two decades. The last has barely manifested 
itself, and as yet is scarcely recognized either by laymen or 
by educators. It remains as one of the chief problems to 
be solved in secondary education. Except as the practical 
arts and vocational studies may be utilized as a sort of edu- 
cational salvage department, the secondary school of to-day 
makes little provision for the pupil of average or below 
average intelligence, the academic studies as at present 
organized and taught demanding for successful achievement 
an intelligence quotient probably not lower than 1.05. 
Secondary education can never adequately perform its 
functions until subject matter and method are organized in 
terms of the varying capacities of pupils. This is the most 
difficult, but probably the most important, problem to be 
solved.

Introduction 
Well; when is a man likely to succeed best? When he divides his 
exertions among many trades, or when he devotes himself exclusively to 
one? ... From these considerations it follows, that all things will be 
produced in superior quantity and quality, and with greater ease, when each 
man works at a single occupation, in accordance with his natural gifts, and 
at the right moment, without meddling with anythingelse. .. .

This vision of an ancient seer and educational statesman 
implied a democratic education in so far as all individuals 
should be prepared for the task for which by nature they were 
best fitted; but until recently few nations exerted them- 
selves to undertake the labor of directing their citizens in 
this important matter. Germany was exceptional in this 
regard. With a view to promoting the supreme good of 
the state she regulated the individual’s life and education 
with Platonic foresight and severity. This attention to 
vocational preparation of her citizens was both a result 
of her economic expansion and an effectual factor in the 
furtherance of it. 
In the early literature on the subject of vocational educa- 
tion in the United States the references made to foreign ex- 
ample and leadership, and particularly those relating to 
Germany’s schools, were numerous. English and French 
practices were also dealt with. In congressional debates on 
Land Grant colleges and in periodical articles advocates re- 
ferred in glowing terms, though often inaccurately, to Ger- 
many’s progressive example. By 1890 the fact was accepted 
by many that new types of schools — trade, manual training, 
273  
-P-A-G-E-290
  274 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
technical, commercial, apprenticeship, corporation, agri- 
cultural, and evening schools — must be developed to pro- 
vide adequate vocational preparation. 
An estimate of the very recent popularity of the idea of 
vocational education as a necessity in American schools may 
be gleaned from periodical literature. While there is much 
chaff in the articles, the fact of extremely rapid increase in 
their number is sufficient evidence that an interest in special 
forms of education began to develop in the last twenty years 
of the nineteenth century, and made a phenomenal advance 
after 1904. 
Economic and Social Changes 
The need for vocational education follows the long march 
of events in our industrial history of the nineteenth century. 
The shift of interest to manufacturing is seen in the rapid 
increase of patents from an average of 77 between 1790 and 
1811 to 192 from 1812 to 1817 and 544 in 1830. In 1860 
there was a total of 4819 patents. Cotton, woolen, and iron 
industries grew enormously; cotton goods manufactories 
increased from 4 in 1805 to 795 in 1831, while the volume of 
raw materials utilized increased sevenfold; the value of 
the woolen output increased fivefold in the period from 1810 
to 1840; the iron industry grew more slowly, but after 1830 
received a great impetus from railroad building and from the 
fact that anthracite was used for smelting purposes after 
1837. Though these steps were remarkable for a nation 
just emerging into a consciousness of its industrial greatness, 
they were but a harbinger of the increase in the value of 
manufactures which came in the last half of the cen- 
tury. In 1850 the value of manufactures was over one 
billion dollars; in 1880, over five billion; in 1909, over 
twenty billion; and over twenty-four billion in 1914. In 
the period from 1850 to 1900 the national wealth increased
-P-A-G-E-291
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 275 
from over seven billion to more than eighty-eight billion 
dollars. 
The importance of the United States in world trade has 
increased by leaps and bounds since 1860. In 1880 the 
value of exports exceeded that of imports and has so con- 
tinued to the present. In 1900 the United States ranked 
first among the nations of the world as an exporter. In 
these exports the value of manufactured goods has increased 
rapidly. In 1860 manufactured goods constituted 12.76; in 
1890, 17.87 ; in 1910, 45.32 ; and in 1920, 51.52 per cent of the 
total value of exports. The total value of exports rose from 
approximately $333,000,000 in 1860 to $857,000,000 in 1890, 
$1,745,000,000 in 1910, and $8,228,000,000 in 1920. The 
total value of imports increased from approximately 
$353,000,000 in 1860 to $789,000,000 in 1890, $1,557,000,000 
in 1910, and $5,278,000,000 in 1920. 
In this world trade agricultural products were a large 
factor. In 1860 over 51,000,000 bushels of wheat and over 
54,000,000 bushels of corn were exported; twenty years 
later the export figures for these two commodities were 
550,767,121 and 489,656,935 bushels respectively. The 
total value of our agricultural products in 1870 was almost 
two billion dollars; in 1890 two and a half billion; in 1900 
a little less than five billion; in 1910 nearly eight and a 
half billion; and in 1919 almost twelve and a half billion. 
The great increase of agricultural products depended to a 
large extent on improved machinery. 
With the spread of manufacturing, a novel characteristic 
appeared in the population of the United States. In 1810 
but 4.9 per cent of the total population, or 356,920, dwelt 
in cities of over 8000, and in 1860, only 16.1 per cent. But 
by 1900 this figure had doubled and the total urban popula- 
tion was reckoned at 40 per cent. In 1910 the urban popu- 
lation constituted 45.8, and 51.4 per cent of the whole in 1920.
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Another important factor at work in bringing forward the 
problem of industrial education is the change in the tendency 
of immigration. Since 1880 immigration from Northern and 
Western Europe has declined markedly, while the propor- 
tion from the south and east has increased. This influx of 
unskilled labor from countries having a high percentage of 
illiteracy in place of a group that was somewhat skilled, the 
passing of the small shop as a training place, and the policy 
of unions in limiting the number of apprentices, have pre- 
cipitated the problem of industrial education upon the 
schools. 
Types of Schools and Courses 
The actual expansion of American education to include 
vocational preparation has, until recent years, made but 
slow progress. Important forerunners of this expansion 
were the manual labor institutions which sprang up after 
1825, largely inspired by the labors of Fellenberg, and the 
manual training schools of the last quarter of the century. 
Both of these movements, however, sought after a more 
perfect discipline and were not distinctly vocational. Hach 
attempted to combine the work of the hands with that of 
the head. Disciplinary value lay in manual occupations 
because they exercised the powers of observation, reasoning, 
and will. Some, doubtless, felt that this introduction of 
manual work was the basis of industrial education ; but the 
utilitarian, vocational aim was seldom mentioned and never 
emphasized by teachers. Nevertheless, by their very charac- 
ter, the manual training schools of the eighties prepared 
the way for acceptance of the idea of industrial educa- 
tion. Being realistic in curriculum, they furnished an anti- 
dote for the dominant literary education of the high school. 
A school was established by the Ethical Culture Society of 
New York in 1878, and two years later the St. Louis Manual
-P-A-G-E-293
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 277 
Training School was opened. The first was an elementary 
school, the second a high school. In the field of second- 
ary education, the manual training idea began to spread 
rapidly. Private manual training schools were established 
in the next few years at Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, 
and Toledo ; and public institutions were provided in Phila- 
delphia, Baltimore, and Omaha by 1886. The early work 
of these schools consisted of set exercises in joinery, turn- 
ing, forging, and so forth, according to the ‘‘Russian Sys- 
tem.” At Toledo a beginning was made in instructing 
girls in household arts. 
At the same time efforts were made to bring manual train- 
ing into the public elementary schools. In 1888, after 
a few years of private experimentation, manual training 
became a part of the course in the elementary schools of 
Boston and New York; and a state law was passed by New 
Jersey in 1885 providing subsidies to encourage cities to offer 
manual training in their courses. 
During the early part of the last century a definite in- 
dication of the growing need for specific preparation was 
registered in the establishment of a number of evening schools 
to give instruction of practical utility in mathematics, 
science, and drawing. Cooper Union was established in 
New York in 1854 and a day technical school was combined 
with it in 1900; but its greatest service has been accom- 
plished through evening classes. Another school, the Me- 
chanics Institute, opened evening courses in 1859, supported 
by the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of 
the City of New York, which had been created in 1785. The 
Ohio Mechanics Institute in 1828 offered a definitely realistic 
curriculum — botany, chemistry, mechanics, geometry, and 
arithmetic. A similar tendency is to be noted in the in- 
struction offered in such schools as the Gardiner Lyceum of 
Maine, established about 1823, designed for the education
-P-A-G-E-294
et ee te

of ‘farmers, mechanics, navigators, and merchants” ; 
Franklin Institute of Philadelphia (1824); and the Mary- 
land Institute for the Promotion of Mechanic Arts in Balti- 
more in 1847. j 
Other institutions worthy of mention in this connection 
are Tuskegee Institute (1881); Drexel Institute, Philadel- 
phia (1891) ; Lewis Institute (1896) ; and Armour Institute 
of Technology (1893) in Chicago; Pratt Institute in Brook- 
lyn (1887) ; Spring Garden Institute of Philadelphia (1851) ; 
Philadelphia Textile School and School of Industrial Art 
(1876) ; People’s Institute of Boston; the Baron de Hirsch 
Trade School of New York; and the Williamson Trade 
School — all established in 1888. 
Another extension of vocational preparation has de- 
veloped largely during the last thirty years in the Young 
Men’s Christian Association of America. In the first twenty 
years of its existence but little educational work was done; 
and the few classes maintained were not vocational in 
character. Gradually, however, arithmetic, drawing, book- 
keeping, stenography, and a great array of distinctly voca- 
tional subjects were introduced. In 1905-06 sixty-three 
courses were offered in the West Side Young Men’s Christian 
Association of New York City, distributed in industrial, 
commercial, and cultural fields. Thirty-six per cent of the 
students in 1905 were enrolled in commercial subjects, while 
twenty-six per cent were enrolled in industrial and scientific 
subjects. 
In the past twenty years other provision has been made 
for vocational preparation through the establishment of 
special courses by educational authorities and by industrial 
and commercial concerns. In 1901 the Board of Education 
of Chicago made provision for education of apprentices of 
the masons’ and bricklayers’ associations, beginning with

and woodworking. This experiment developed rapidly. 
The apprentice (in 1904) attended school three months in 
the year, studying ordinary English branches as well as 
those relating definitely to his trade. The remainder of the 
time was spent in his vocation. 
In 1903 Illinois passed a law with the following require- 
ment: 
In all municipalities where a manual training school is maintained for 
the technical instruction of apprentices, such indentures shall further 
provide that it shall be the duty of the master to cause the apprentice to 
attend such school for at least three consecutive months in each year 
without expense to the apprentice. 
Another variety of industrial preparation developed early 
in the twentieth century, in factories, and commercial es- 
tablishments such as those of the National Cash Register 
Company, General Electric Company of Lynn, Mass., 
John Wanamaker, Sears Roebuck & Co., and many others. 
Concerning this establishment of education in the “going 
concern,’ Professor Snedden outlines its more perfect de- 
velopment and then asks: 
Is not the plan of vocational education here suggested the only one that 
will assist our workers in modern highly specialized productive enterprises? 
Is it not the only one adapted to factories for textiles, locomotives, fire- 
arms, jewelry, clothing, furniture, packed meats, books, newspapers, 
automobiles, shoes, stoves, and buttons? Is it not the only one adapted to 
commercial education for department stores, large banks, commission 
houses, large offices? May not something analogous to it be the best 
means of training young men for the successive farming stages of skilled 
farm hand, tenant farmer on a major and two minor specialties, and 
finally owning farmer? 
With the suggestion that as ‘‘good training of physicians 
benefits all of us, since we are likewise private employers 
of physicians,” so “good training of any sort benefits us or 
our representatives as employers, and also as employees.” 
Pursuing this line of reasoning, such education should be 
supported by the public.

Higher Technical Education 
Higher technical education, based upon the equivalent 
of secondary education, is provided in independent schools 
and colleges, in schools established in connection with older 
universities, on private foundations, or in state universities. 
The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded in 1824, 
Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard in 1847, Sheffield 
Scientific School at Yale in 1860, Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology in 1865, Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 
1865, Lehigh University in 1866, Stevens Institute of Tech- 
nology in 1871, Case School of Applied Science in 1880, Rose 
Polytechnic Institute in 1883, Georgia School of Technol- 
ogy in 1888, Carnegie Institute in 1895, and the Polytechnic 
Institute of Brooklyn, reorganized in 1889. Other tech- 
nical schools have been added to older universities such as 
the School of Mines at Columbia in 1864, and the Towne 
Scientific School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1874. 
A third type of higher technical school developed in the land 
grant colleges. The Report of the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1916 gives statistics for 69 institutions 
established under the land grant and subsequent acts. 
In .52 of these institutions for white students there were 
15,710 pursuing engineering courses, and 23,408 in other 
courses of technical nature. 
A coéperative plan was also introduced in the Engineer- 
ing Department of the University of Cincinnati, in accord- 
ance with which about thirty-five manufacturing companies 
agreed to send apprentices to the University to pursue an 
engineering course six years in length, leading to the regular 
degrees. These apprentices were to be possessed of a high 
school education or its equivalent. By having the ap- 
prentices work in pairs, turn about, at study and factory 
work, there was no loss to the employer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 281 
Some idea of the important position of higher technical 
instruction in colleges, universities, and technological schools 
may be gained from the following number of students’ pur- 
suing engineering courses in 1916: general engineering, 
6166; chemical, 2383; civil, 7182; electrical, 6637; 
mechanical, 7751; and mining, 1922. It was not until 
1915 that agriculture began to lead mechanic arts in the race 
for students in the agricultural colleges. In 1911 there were 
almost twice as many students in the mechanic arts courses, 
but in 1912, 1913, and 1914 the number pursuing agriculture 
rose steadily, while mechanic arts remained substantially 
unchanged. In the agricultural and mechanical colleges 
in 1915 there were 17,169 students of agriculture, 4431 
students of household arts, and 16,554 of mechanic arts. 
Commercial Education 
Of the many schools for specific vocational preparation 
that have striven for recognition in the past quarter of a 
century, the commercial schools have perhaps met with 
most opposition. The materialistic aim of commercial edu- 
cation was strangely out of place in an atmosphere surcharged 
with the excitement of pursuit of true culture. Moreover, 
the charlatan character of many private ventures doubtless 
threw the movement all the more into disrepute, and made 
it more difficult for commercial subjects to find a place in 
the curriculum of the regular schools. But thirty years 
after Spencer’s emphasis on utilitarian values in education, 
we were beginning to be able to see the problem differently, 
thanks to the pressure of events. 
The whole idea of commercial education began to be better 
defined after 1880, and particularly after 1890. Leaders 
were needed. As the old colleges and universities required 
the preparation of the Latin grammar school, the academy, 
and the high school, thus completing a system, so the creation
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of collegiate and secondary schools of commerce was neces- 
sary to complete a system of commercial education. The 
Wharton School, opened in 1881 with a total of thirteen 
students, contributed an important spokesman: Edmund J. 
James in 1892 advocated the creation of separate commer- 
cial high schools, adducing from Germany, Austria, France, 
and other countries many proofs of our backwardness. In 
the present century a number of such schools have been 
established. Among the most noteworthy of the separate 
commercial high schools are those at San Francisco, Wash- 
ington, Louisville, Boston, Brooklyn, New York City, 
Cleveland, and Springfield. 
The striking increase in commercial education may be 
seen in the following figures :

1918 890 289,579 | 278,275 (In high schools only) 
  
  
As a general rule the courses in commercial education have 
been from one to four, or recently even five, years in length. 
They seek to prepare definitely for a business career and also 
to enable students to enter schools of commerce at uni- 
versities. At the outset, the distinguishing feature was the 
omission of classical studies, and some limitation on other 
academic subjects. Nevertheless, general commercial train- 
ing, rather than technical, was urged, and James maintained 
that through commercial education was to be realized 
“another highway to that state of mind and heart known as 
culture.”
-P-A-G-E-299
  
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 283 
It may be of interest here to note the type of curriculum 
of the early collegiate commercial school. The retention of 
many purely academic subjects is worthy of notice. The 
Wharton School eurriculum in 1881 was distributed over 
three years. To be admitted to the sub-junior, one must 
pass examinations or have completed the freshman and 
sophomore work of the College or Towne Scientific School. 
In the sub-junior course were offered social science, mercan- 
tile practice, English, German, French, physics, mineralogy, 
Latin, and drawing, the last two being elective. In the 
junior year social science, taxation, industry, commerce and 
transportation, wage questions, mental and moral science, 
English, geology, physics, Latin, German, and French were 
offered. The senior studies were law, social science, original 
research in theory and history of economic questions, his- 
tory, English, physics, and astronomy. 
A similar tendency may be noted almost twenty years 
later in the courses outlined for commercial high schools 
and departments. Latin was, for traditional reasons, 
retained in the preliminary curriculum drawn up for the 
School of Commerce of the Central High School of Philadel- 
phia; but, in practice, the first-year Latin was made a study 
of ‘etymology and fundamental English.” The Latin 
requirement lasted but one year, German being then sub- 
stituted. The Committee of Nine proposed a requirement of 
two years of German, French, or Spanish in 1903. The 
curriculum of the New York High School of Commerce 
(1903) required four years of German, French, or Spanish. 
Algebra, plane geometry, ancient, medieval, modern, and 
United States history also retained a prominent place and 
gave an air of academic respectability so far as traditional 
standards were concerned. The retention of many such 
subjects and the all too general nature of commercial edu- 
cation have in recent years been condemned.
-P-A-G-E-300
  284 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Agricultural Education 
An interest in agriculture as an educational proposition 
may be noted as early as 1775, when a Society for the Pro- 
motion of Agriculture was established at Philadelphia. 
Seven years later a similar society was created in Massa- 
chusetts. An agricultural school was established in Maine 
in 1821 and another in Connecticut in 1824. The New York 
and Michigan legislatures sought to encourage agricultural 
instruction in schools in 1823 and 1888 respectively. The 
earliest publicly supported agricultural high school was 
established in 1888 in connection with the University of 
Minnesota. Ten years later ten such schools were reported. 
State action was taken by Wisconsin (in 1901) when an 
act was passed providing free county secondary schools of 
agriculture and household economy. The course was to 
consist of two years’ work at the beginning; and each school 
so established was granted $2500 as a state subsidy. 
Since 1900 the number of agricultural high schools of 
various forms has increased rapidly. In Wisconsin there 
are county agricultural high schools similar to that men- 
tioned above; in the South, Alabama established schools 
for large areas, and the same type has also found a place in 
Georgia, Virginia, California, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Massa- 
chusetts, and New York; in many states secondary schools 
have also been established in conjunction with agricultural 
colleges and state universities. Prominent among recent 
developments is the Farm Life School of North Carolina. 
Many other schools offer “courses” in agriculture, but do 
not specialize in that subject. 
In 1913 about 2300 high schools of the United States were 
reported as teaching agriculture ; in 1914, 1553 were reported 
with 32,021 students; and in 1917-18, 2012 high schools 
reported 38,728 students. There have been more institu-
-P-A-G-E-301
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 285 
tions reported at times; thus in 1915, 4665 schools were 
mentioned. The smaller figure for the most recent date is 
said to be due to the fact that ‘‘more careful inquiry” is 
made into ‘‘work reported as agriculture.” 
Vocational Education of Women 
Briefly stated, the demands for vocational training of 
women in the schools depend upon the following: (1) Ex- 
pansion of the sphere of women’s activities in an industrial 
society now includes many things beyond the home, leaving 
less opportunity for giving instruction to the young. (2) The 
application of science to the tasks of the household requires 
systematic instruction, which cannot be given at home be- 
cause many mothers are not trained for the purpose, even 
though they are not employed outside the home in any 
other occupation. (3) Its teaching constitutes a reform 
measure. Healthy people are apt to be happy. Healthy, 
happy people are valuable social assets. Scientifically 
planned meals, child hygiene, harmonious decoration, 
scientific regulation of ventilation, heating and plumbing 
systems, and skillful expenditure of the family funds, it is 
maintained, conduce to this end. (4) If women are to enter 
occupations outside the home, there must be preparation 
for them, and guidance in making the choice. 
Some instruction in domestic arts appeared in colonial 
days when mistresses gave lessons in “‘all sorts of needle 
work,” “plain work,” ‘‘marking,”’ and “pattern drawing,”’ 
but little importance attaches to the movement before 
1875. <A “private cookery” school was instituted in Boston 
in 1874 and another three years later. In 1879 the Boston 
Cooking School was opened, which later united with Sim- 
mons College. Private concerns and some classes in public 
schools stimulated an interest in this branch of domestic art 
to such an extent that in 1885 it became a part of the work
-P-A-G-E-302
286 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of the school system. Sewing had been introduced success- 
fully about 1865. The importance of instruction in cookery 
was recognized about the same time in Philadelphia and 
New York; in the former city classes opened in 1878, and 
seven years later sewing and cooking entered the public 
elementary schools; in the latter city a cooking school 
opened in 1876, and was later incorporated. By 1888 cook- 
ing and sewing had become part of the elementary school 
curriculum. 
Extension of instruction to the secondary school in any 
branch of domestic art was slow and came about only 
through the newly created types of schools, the manual 
training, technical, vocational, and cosmopolitan high 
schools. In 1901 Wisconsin provided by law for county 
agricultural high schools which were to teach domestic 
science. The next fifteen years saw great advancement of 
the idea in secondary schools. In 1917-18 2865 public high 
schools, or about 20 per cent, offered courses in home eco- 
nomics which were attended by 1316 boys and 100,671 girls. 
These constituted, however, but 10 per cent of all girls at 
public high schools and a little less than 6 per cent of all 
boys and girls so attending. The academic courses still 
occupy the major part of the field, drawing almost 72 per 
cent of all students. 
Other organizations, such as the Boston Trade School 
and the Manhattan Trade School, founded just after the 
beginning of the present century, are important in that 
they represent an effort to reproduce actual conditions in 
the school situation. As recognized pioneers in the labor of 
this movement may also be mentioned the Young Women’s 
Christian Association, the American School of Home Eco- 
nomics of Chicago, the Lake Placid Conference of Home 
Economics, and the Summer School of Chautauqua, New 
York.
-P-A-G-E-303
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 287 
Home economics in higher institutions of learning was 
introduced somewhat later, though some attention was given 
to the practical side in western institutions at an early date. 
Following the example of Mt. Holyoke College since 1836, 
the earliest step seems to have been taken at the University 
of Iowa in 1869, when young women were required to work 
in dining room and kitchen; but similar opportunities were 
soon offered at other institutions. As a general rule, how- 
ever, domestic science instruction at state agricultural 
colleges and state universities began in the first decade of the 
present century. 
Other higher institutions that deserve a fuller account, 
if space permitted, are Simmons College, opened in 1902, 
Drexel Institute, Pratt Institute, and the School of Practical 
Arts of Teachers College. These have done most for the 
movement through the preparation of future teachers. In 
the past ten years the enrollment in the School of Practical 
Arts has increased from 580 to over 2000 students, of whom 
330 are pursuing graduate work. On account of the great 
increase in numbers, and also because of the fact that many 
institutions now exist which offer opportunities for train- 
ing in the first two years of domestic science, entrance to the 
School of Practical Arts now depends on the completion of 
the first two years’ work elsewhere; thus the school at 
Teachers College is free to devote its energies to more ad- 
vanced instruction. 
The increase of interest in home economics has been gen- 
eral in colleges, universities, and technological schools during 
the twentieth century. In 1905 there were but 849 stu- 
dents of household economy in such schools; in 1910 there 
were 1934; while in 1916 there were, in 195 institutions 
of the above grade, 17,778 students. In 1917-18 there 
were 773 degrees in home economics conferred in these 
institutions.

Federal Legislation 
Federal legislation on vocational education had its begin- 
ning prior to the Civil War, when in 1857 Justin 8. Morrill 
introduced a bill to establish agricultural colleges. Though 
opposed by several senators, and criticized variously as 
“fraud,” ‘delusion,’ and ‘‘cheat,’’ the Morrill Act was 
passed in 1862. It provided for a gift to the states of 30,000 
acres of public land for each senator and representative then 
in Congress, for “endowment, support, and maintenance 
of at least one college, whose leading object shall be, without 
excluding other scientific and classical studies, and includ- 
ing military tactics, to teach such branches as are related 
to agriculture and the mechanic arts... .”’ Mr. Morrill 
emphasized in his plea for the bill that he desired to ‘‘do 
something for the farmer,’ but the purpose and plan were 
so indefinitely conceived that much of the federal grant was 
wasted. While professing to do ‘‘something for the farmer,” 
the schools, during their early years, turned out more stu- 
dents of classics, sciences, and mechanic arts than of agri- 
culture. Not until 1915 did the number of students in 
agriculture exceed those in mechanic arts. 
Following the first grant for agricultural and mechanical 
colleges in 1862, came an appropriation for experimental 
stations in 1887, the authorization of an annual grant in 
1890 — increased in 1907—the Adams Act of 1906, the 
Smith-Lever Bill of 1914, and the Smith-Hughes enactment 
of 1917. All of these extended the function of the federal 
government in the field of education. A further extension 
is now contemplated by the Towner-Sterling Bill. 
The efforts to secure federal assistance for vocational 
projects from 1862 to the end of the nineteenth century, 
upon whatever reasons they happened to be based, furnished 
a fitting prologue to the activities of the twentieth. Be-
-P-A-G-E-305
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 289 
sides the bills already mentioned to promote agricultural 
education, the unsuccessful Davis and Page Bills, of 1907 
and 1912 respectively, represent efforts to secure federal 
support for vocational education. At length a commission 
was appointed to investigate the situation and make report 
on the desirability and feasibility of giving federal aid. 
The Commission presented a long report, urging the exten- 
sion of federal grants to vocational education, and upon the 
basis of the following reasons : 
(1) There is pressing need of vocational education. 
(2) The problem of vocational education is too extensive to be worked 
out except by a national agency. 
(3) The states are too poor to attempt a solution of the problem. 
(4) Federal grants would start an interest and stimulate local effort in 
the direction of vocational education. 
(5) Federal grants in this case are constitutional on the basis of pro- 
moting general welfare. 
(6) The mobility of the population and of labor in particular justifies 
the application of federal resources to the problem. 
(7) The training of teachers of vocational subjects is expensive and 
teachers are migratory; both reasons justify federal aid for their training. 
(8) A bureau should be maintained by federal appropriation to as- 
semble and distribute information on vocational subjects. 
The foregoing reasons are quite as interesting to a student 
of history as is the bill which followed in February, 1917. 
So far as a basis for federal grants to vocational education 
is concerned, they are as unsound and irrational as those 
urged by Mr. Morrill and his colleagues more than sixty 
years earlier. 
The Smith-Hughes law, 1917, provided for the following : 
a Federal Board of Vocational Education and state boards 
to coéperate with it in case the state accepted the provisions 
of the act; aid for salaries of teachers, the amount to be 
matched by the state; federal supervision of work and ex- 
penditures ; and investigations connected with the several 
fields of vocational education. The federal grants for the 
various purposes are shown in the following table :

The codperation of the federal government and the states 
under the Act is said by the Federal Board to rest upon these 
fundamental ideas : 
First, that vocational education being essential to the national welfare, 
it is a function of the national government to stimulate the states to 
undertake this new and needed form of service ; second, that federal funds 
are necessary in order to equalize the burden of carrying on the work 
among the states; third, that since the federal government is vitally 
interested in the success of vocational education, it should, so to speak, 
purchase a degree of participation in this work; and; fourth, that only by 
creating such a relationship between the central and the local govern- 
ments can proper standards of educational efficiency be set up. 
The word “ vocational’ may be stricken out of the “four 
fundamental ideas ’’ quoted above and they remain equally 
defensible. Further extension of federal support to Ameri- 
canization, teacher training, etc., as proposed by the Towner- 
Sterling Bill, rests upon the same arguments. 
Many, who are convinced of the genuine need for voca- 
tional education, are frankly skeptical of the federal pro- 
visions for it. Professor Kandel stated certain objections 
in 1917, and many of them still stand. First, dual control 
is introduced, which is undesirable. If vocational education 
is worthy of a place it should be part of a general system, 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 291 
not isolated. Second, it deals with the problem in piece- 
meal fashion, giving assistance to agricultural, trade, home 
economics, and industrial subjects and the training of 
teachers for these groups, and makes no pretense of dealing 
with vocational education as a whole question. Third, ex- 
pensive machinery is erected in Washington to draw out of 
one pocket funds to be placed in another. Fourth, the 
Federal Board itself is badly constituted. Only three of 
its members are to give their full time to the task, and into 
their hands is intrusted the expenditure of millions. Those 
possessed of decentralizing leanings point out that the 
state has capitulated to national authority in that state 
boards must have their plans approved by the Federal Board 
before aid can be granted; others, however, insist that in- 
adequate safeguards are set over the expenditure of federal 
funds; finally, that the action of Congress has undertaken 
to settle in hasty manner a question the solution of which 
should have depended upon painstaking scientific study by 
experts. ’ 
State Legislation 
Recent years have witnessed in the states a marked in- 
crease in legislative activity relating to various phases of 
vocational education. In 1920 and 1921, over one hundred 
acts were passed in the several states of the Union relating to 
vocational rehabilitation, continuation, trade, and agri- 
cultural schools. Many of these acts were concerned with 
the acceptance of the provisions of the Smith-Hughes Act. 
There are a number of acts on compulsory continuation 
education. California provided in 1921 for compulsory part- 
time continuation education for workers from 16 to 18 
years of age; Connecticut, in 1921, provided for part-time 
continuation education for workers between 14 and 16 years 
of age in case the equivalent of the eight elementary grades
-P-A-G-E-308
292 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
has not been completed ; Delaware, in 1921, required boards 
of education in counties and special districts to provide 
part-time educational opportunities in general, civic, and 
vocational subjects for all persons under 16, not attending a 
full-time day school — attendance to be enforced when the 
part-time classes are established ; Florida, in 1921, authorized 
and required boards of education to organize and maintain 
part-time schools; the 1919 law of Illinois required part- 
time education for those between 14 and 16 years, whereas 
the amended form of 1921 permits the authorities to main- 
tain such schools. Where the schools are established, at- 
tendance of employed minors, 14 to 18 years of age, who 
have not finished four years of secondary school work, is 
required eight hours per week for 36 weeks each year. 
Indiana, in 1921, charged local authorities to require attend- 
ance of lawfully employed minors from 14 to 18 years for 
not less than four nor more than eight hours per week. 
Similar acts or amendments have been passed by Kentucky, 
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Utah, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
Next to continuation education, vocational rehabilitation 
received most attention at the hands of state legislators ; 
approximately one third of the total number of bills related 
to this subject. In a majority of cases, these bills merely 
provided for the ‘‘acceptance of the benefits of an act passed 
by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled to provide for the 
promotion of vocational rehabilitation of persons disabled 
in industry or otherwise, and their return to civil employ- 
ments. tt2? 
Vocational Guidance 
The development of an industrial society has brought with 
it many educational problems, but none more difficult and
-P-A-G-E-309
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 293 
far-reaching than that of vocational guidance. It is true 
that the problem is an old one, hinted at centuries ago, but 
_it is so urgent now as to be unavoidable. Bloomfield men- 
tions a document from an English source as early as 1747 
and Richards published Vocophy in 1881, but little was ac- 
complished in the United States before the work begun by 
Parsons at Boston in 1908. That which went before is in- 
teresting to us now, but not of great importance. 
Leaders in modern vocational guidance recognize that 
two things must be known: the capacities, qualities, and 
desires of the individual; and the nature of occupations 
themselves and the qualities necessary for success in them. 
Vast fields of labor are at once opened up when we recognize 
the need for analysis of these two things, the individual 
and the occupation. Likewise, in the study of any one of 
them, and the application of the truth arrived at, to a prac- 
tical problem, opportunities for disagreement arise. Mo- 
mentous to-day is the difference of opinion concerning the 
use and interpretation of the results of various tests that 
have been devised. The facts are the same — cold, imper- 
sonal, unwilling. But they do not mean the same thing to 
different people. Thus, while there is one set of facts, 
scientifically arrived at, action based on them may not be 
united. One theorist believes that there is enough of scien- 
tific knowledge to sustain him in giving direct advice to 
enter a given profession; another may content himself, 
while knowing the same facts, with merely supplying in- 
formation about a vocation and allowing the individual to 
make a choice without hindrance or direction. 
But questions broader than individual welfare are involved. 
Do psychological tests spell disaster for the ideal of American 
democracy? Denouncing American democracy as a fetish, 
President Cutten recently emphasized the future possibili- 
ties in vocational testing whereby each will find the sphere
-P-A-G-E-310
  294 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
for which he is fitted by nature. His conclusion is that 
“Gt must inevitably destroy universal adult suffrage . . . 
and we come back again to the rule of the aristocracy — 
this time the real and total aristocracy.” 
The above interpretation of the function of tests was 
attacked by W. C. Bagley, who characterized it as ‘‘most 
unfortunate,’ maintaining that ‘‘far from revealing the 
need of an ‘aristocracy of brains’” the tests point “compel- 
lingly towards the need of a much more thoroughgoing 
democracy of culture than our educational system has yet 
achieved.” Whipple, on the other hand, believes that 
“the real meaning of democracy is properly safeguarded in 
the notion of ‘equity of opportunity’”’ and that ‘the exist- 
ence of fundamental and relatively permanent individual 
differences in intellectual capacity has been incontrovertibly 
demonstrated.” 
Colvin recently summarized the findings concerning the 
prognostic value of tests : 
We must, therefore, conclude that on the whole, psychological tests 
have justified their use as prognostic of academic achievement. 
The army tests have indicated the probability at least, that there 
are certain intelligence levels for various occupations, ranging from below 
average intelligence for day laborers to decidedly above average for the 
professions. It is not altogether certain that these results can be taken un- 
reservedly at their face value, but they are at least suggestive and may be 
employed together with other data in assigning men to occupational groups 
and in advising pupils in regard to various life callings. 
There has been disagreement in the past concerning the 
variability in degrees of ability; types have been described 
by all generations since Plato told us of the men of iron, 
silver, and gold. Modern psychology, however, seems to 
indicate the non-existence of clear-cut types. Thorndike’s 
interpretation of the facts may be accepted as representing 
the current view when he concludes that ‘it is very hard 
to find any case of a negative correlation between desirable 
mental functions,” and ‘better adaptation to the world in
-P-A-G-E-311
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 295 
any respect seems to be positively related to better adapta- 
tion in all, or nearly all, respects . . .” 
Regarding the permanence of youthful interests, another 
question of great importance to guidance, the same author 
found ‘‘a correlation of .6 or .7 . . . to be approximately 
the true degree of resemblance between the relative degree 
of an interest in a child of from ten to fourteen and in the 
same person at twenty-one. ... On the whole the resem- 
blance between interest and ability may safely be placed 
at about .9 of a perfect resemblance.” 
It is evident that much has been done, and more is hoped 
for, in the analysis of the individual. The weight of expert 
opinion is in favor of accepting the present tests tentatively 
and perfecting them as instruments for classification. 
Meanwhile, the other phase of the guidance problem is 
receiving more and more attention — the study of the occu- 
pations open to men and women, and compilation of in- 
formation as to where and how suitable training may be 
obtained to prepare for them. In 1921 the Public Education 
and Child Labor Association of Pennsylvania published 
a Survey of Opportunities for Vocational Education in and 
about Philadelphia. The surveys of cities such as Minne- 
apolis, Indianapolis, Evansville, Wilmington, Richmond, 
and Cleveland, and reports and bulletins of vocational 
guidance bureaus have also contributed to this end. Boston 
provides a book giving a description of its high schools, and 
places this in the hands of each eighth-grade child. Chicago, 
with similar intent, suggests the proper high schools for 
elementary school graduates, and describes opportunities 
in other city institutions that are open to high school grad- 
uates. Similar efforts are made in other cities. 
From the foregoing facts concerning (1) pyschological 
investigations and (2) study of occupations and specific 
preparation for them, it appears that vocational guidance
-P-A-G-E-312
  296 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
to-day covers a wider range of activities than was earlier 
thought necessary. A broad conception of the problem 
to-day is suggested by Brewer, when he says it is concerned 
with: ‘‘(1) Laying a broad foundation of useful experiences, 
(2) studying occupational opportunities, (3) choosing an 
occupation, (4) preparing for the occupation, (5) entering 
upon work, (6) securing promotions and making readjust- 
ments.” 
The six points above represent a broad and sane interpre- 
tation of the task of vocational guidance. It may discourage 
some workers inasmuch as it would accomplish much more 
than is generally attempted. Often, guidance has meant 
and means only advice and placement. It must do more, 
and so far as guidance bureaus are able to become effective 
in the several functions indicated, they will measure up to 
the highest conception of their task. 
But many difficulties lie in the path, particularly with re- 
gard to the individual who has undertaken a job. There 
must be considered the relation between the employer, the 
employee, and the guidance bureau. The former and the 
latter must come to agreement regarding the employee. 
The former is interested first in profit; the latter in the 
welfare of the boy and girl and the result to society. There 
must be coéperation on the part of the employer and the 
guidance experts. The employer must come to realize 
that his best interests are served by well-placed, well-paid, 
and safeguarded employees. Without this justice, there 
can be no industrial peace. 
To this problem, which so closely concerns employer and 
vocational guide, it was hoped that an answer might be sug- 
gested by scientific management which came into great 
prominence as a result of the work of Taylor, Gantt, and 
Emerson. If, as stated, “Scientific management” is ‘“‘de- 
vised by industrial engineers for the purpose of subserving
-P-A-G-E-313
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 297 
the common interests of employers, workmen, and society 
at large . . .,” it would seem that unity of purpose exists 
already between managers of employment and vocational 
guides. Theory and practice must be considered, however, 
in order to appreciate the help or hindrance of scientific 
management to vocational guidance. In this connection 
some observations made to the United States Commission 
on Industrial Relations are significant. 
Hoxie reported in his study, Scientific Management and 
Labor, ‘‘that the average manager in a scientific management 
shop is not only quite indifferent to, but profoundly igno- 
rant of, the broader and deeper aspects of the problem of 
vocational selection and adaptation.” According to this 
judgment, made after careful study, it appears that the 
contributions of scientific management to vocational edu- 
cation and guidance are of decidedly dubious character. 
Schneider, in his Hducation for Industrial Workers, is 
likewise of the opinion that scientific management tends 
rather to increase the strength of a capitalist employer class 
than to offer “any effective guarantee against overspeeding 
and exhaustion of workers.” 
Briefly, efficiency will not of itself solve social problems. 
It is but a narrow phase of a broad problem. It is easy and 
comfortable to adopt a fetish. Would it be better for our 
democracy, if, instead of ‘‘efficiency”’ as the password for 
success, we were to try ‘‘mutual aid’ — or temper ‘‘effi- 
ciency”’ with the Golden Rule? 
In this industrial-minded age a mere human being needs a 
friend. The business man may be that, but he is primarily 
concerned with “returns.” To him vocational education 
is necessary for the sake of industry. As the Federal Com- 
mission on National Aid stated: ‘‘Vocational Education is 
therefore needed as a wise business investment for this nation, 
because our national prosperity and happiness are at stake 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and our position in the markets of the world cannot other- 
wise be maintained.” 
Let the educator be wary lest in educating men vocation- 
ally he merely prepare them for the industrial juggernaut. 
One must agree with Brewer that “the best vocational 
guidance is that accomplished by means of educational 
guidance.” The best thing that can be accomplished by the 
guidance movement is to keep children in school longer 
rather than rush them into jobs — to keep vocational in- 
terests broad, rather than sacrifice them early for the sake 
of narrow efficiency. 
The Present Situation 
Evidence of the great expansion of opportunities for 
vocational education, the beginnings of which have been 
noted in several fields, is to be seen in recent figures. Under 
the Smith-Hughes Act, a total of $2,307,460.44 was allotted 
to the states for the fiscal year ending June, 1919, for en- 
couraging instruction in agriculture, trade, home economics, 
and industrial subjects, and the preparation of vocational 
teachers. The table on page 299 shows the increase in the 
number of federally aided vocational schools of the several 
types since 1918, the number of students teacher training 
institutions assisted, and the number of students in teacher 
training courses. 
Vocational rehabilitation and return to civil employment 
of disabled persons discharged from the military or naval 
forces of the United States was provided for by law, June 27, 
1918. The number of training centers of various types in 
1921 was 183; in these 12,315 “trainees” were enrolled for 
agricultural, commercial, and industrial preparation. The 
total funds appropriated for the purpose up to and including 
1922 was $209,078,137, and the actual expenditure of the

Federal aid for vocational rehabilitation of those disabled

with during the year was 5619. At the close of the fiscal 
year 1921, thirteen states had not accepted the federal pro- 
vision by legislative enactment.

  300 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
In commercial education advancement has been made, 
especially in the character of the course of study. The 
courses in the first few years of the century were singularly 
academic, and the course favored by the National Educa- 
tion Association in 1903 seems unusually strait-laced, 
compared with the liberal supply of commercial subjects 
in the modern cosmopolitan and commercial high schools. 
There was a time when commercial education was planned 
to train only bookkeepers and stenographers. More specific 
ends are now sought after, as retail selling, and special 
secretarial service, in addition to earlier objectives. Never- 
theless there is a demand for more specific objectives. Sur- 
veys have shown, almost without exception, that commercial 
education pursues its own sweet way without much regard 
to business practice. Specialization is the rule of modern 
business. If it hopes to meet business needs the school 
must follow that practice. If business concerns do not 
ordinarily combine the task of bookkeeper and stenographer, 
why should the school insist on such a practice? 
In 1917-18, 2953 public high schools reported 278,275 
students in commercial courses, of which number nearly 
ten thousand were in junior high schools. In 1918 there 
were 890 private commercial and business schools with 
289,579 students. Is this equality of opportunity? Overa 
quarter of a million youths must, if interested in a commercial 
occupation, enter private commercial schools. The number 
of students in high school commercial departments and 
courses exceeds by far those in any one of the subjects that 
are federally subsidized. 
The assistance rendered by the federal government to 
home economics, agriculture, industrial and -trade training, 
has been mentioned in the above table. In 1917-18, 2865 
public high schools offered courses in domestic science at- 
tended by 101,987 students; 2012 offered work in agricul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 301 
ture to 38,728 students; 1831 offered technical or manual 
training courses attended by 96,833; and 250 offered trade 
training courses attended by 16,614. 
The changes in the curriculum of secondary schools, in- 
volved in the introduction of manual training, domestic 
science, industrial arts, and agriculture, bear evidence to the 
fact that successful efforts have been made to restore to 
secondary education its proper functions in the educational 
system. It cannot be said to-day, as it was twenty-five 
years ago, that ‘“‘The bells of our university leaders jingle, 
and with pack horse constancy we have blindly followed 
. .” The guiding principle to-day is to be found in our 
study of occupations and in the development of vocational 
courses that train specifically for them. It is now conceded 
that general vocational preparation is impossible, albeit 
some practice seems to belie the statement. The general 
truth, however, is borne out by the fact that in 1917-18 
about thirty per cent of the students in public high schools 
were pursuing vocational courses. 
The recognition of vocational education as a legitimate 
and very important objective of the secondary school has 
come about in response to new industrial, commercial, and 
social needs, incident to our economic expansion. In place 
of the few callings which formerly demanded specific train- 
ing, there are now many; and for these adequate training 
through apprenticeship is no longer practicable. The 
foremost critics of the old formal education of the secondary 
school pointed out repeatedly that it did not prepare for 
life. ‘‘We only toil and labor to stuff the memory, .. .” 
says Montaigne; Penn complains that “‘we are in pain to 
make them scholars but not men”; while Milton defines 
a complete education which shall fit for ‘‘all the offices both 
private and public of peace and war” and bewails the fact 
that we ‘‘spend seven or eight years in scraping together so
-P-A-G-E-318
  
302 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
much miserable Latin and Greek as might be learned 
otherwise easily and delightfully in one year.’ The best 
interpreters of secondary education have had in mind the 
preparation of men for life situations, whether through clas- 
sical or modern “‘real’”’ studies. ‘‘It is therefore proposed,”’ 
says Franklin, “‘that they learn those things that are likely to 
be most useful and most ornamental; regard being had to the 
several professions for which they are intended.’”’ On the 
whole, it appears that the inclusion of specific vocational 
objectives in modern secondary education is but a fuller 
realization of an old ideal, in terms of modern social and 
economic standards and conditions. 
Advanced preparation along vocational lines has already 
been mentioned. In 1916 there were 17,778 students of 
home economics in 195 colleges, universities, and technical 
schools; in the same year 32,041 students pursued courses 
in engineering; 17,145 in agriculture; 795 in forestry; 
9223 in commerce; and 1953 in architecture. 
Mention should also be made of nurse-training institutions 
which have experienced great increase in point of numbers 
since 1880, when but 15 were reported with 323 pupil nurses 
and 157 graduates. In 1918 there were 1776 such schools 
having 55,251 pupils and 13,751 graduates. Of 1606 
general hospital schools reporting in 1918 there were 1416 
which offered a three-year course, and three which offered 
a four-year course. This lengthening of the course from 
one or two years has been accomplished by the majority of 
institutions during the past ten years. 
The Place of Vocational Education 
The origins touched upon in the foregoing pages represent 
the groping of a people for a realization of their opportuni- 
ties through a more elaborate system of education and train- 
ing. ‘‘Remember,” said Bacon, ‘‘that the learning of the
-P-A-G-E-319
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 303 
few is despotism, the learning of the many is liberty; and 
that intelligent and principled liberty is fame, wisdom, and 
power.’ Vocational education seeks to offer hitherto un- 
known opportunities for the many. 
This new education is demanded by the individual worker, 
for without it he is unable to cope with modern industrial 
conditions; industry makes similar demands in the name 
of efficiency. Traditional respect for the worth and right 
of the individual should insure the educator’s attention to 
this project; respect for material success does insure the 
attention of the leaders in industrial and commercial life. 
But, traditionally, educators have stood afar off from busi- 
ness, while men in commercial life have scoffed at education. 
The two must come together, otherwise there can be no 
satisfactory solution of this problem. Mere efficiency, de- 
manded by business, does not mean complete living, 
nor good citizenship ; on the other hand, general preparation 
alone cannot now make an economically independent in- 
dividual. The first necessity is life; the second, abundant 
life. Abundant life gives to society ; mere living has nothing 
left over. Unless we achieve the second, the first is of small 
significance for social progress. 
A broader purpose must then be conceived, and it seems 
quite evident that it can come about best through integra- 
tion of the points of view of educator and industrialist. 
Coéperation has been heralded at numerous conventions as 
the only way to a successful conclusion of the matter. Re- 
cently a regional conference was held on commercial educa- 
tion for the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, 
Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey, designed ‘‘to pro- 
mote better understanding and closer codperation between 
business men and teachers of business, economics, and social 
science subjects.” The codperative tendency may also be 
noted in the attitude of business towards numerous voca-
-P-A-G-E-320
304 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tional surveys that have been made. At the recent meeting 
of the National Society for Vocational Education, held at 
Detroit, employers appeared to state their needs to the con- 
vention. 
The welfare of the individual, and so of society, depends 
on the genuine codéperation of industrialists and educators. 
Neither one nor the other may be dictator. In codpera- 
tion there is compromise. The narrow aim, to secure effi- 
ciency alone, often found in the commercial or industrial 
concern, must be broadened. In times past it was necessary 
to compel the master to cause his apprentice to be taught 
to read and write; also to safeguard them against their 
masters “‘if they use them rigorously.” ‘Rigorous usage”’ 
is not uncommon to-day, and the most efficient individual 
in the shop may be a loss to society. The following state- 
ment, reported in the National Education Association 
Proceedings a few years ago, is descriptive of the attitude of 
too many concerns: ‘These boys will work all their lives 
for our company and we want them to do things our way. 
We don’t want the boys to draw; we want them to read 
drawings. We don’t want them to boss. We want them 
to be bossed,”’ and he might have added, ‘‘and we don’t 
want them to think, but to become automatic machines.”’ 
On the other hand, many critics from the field of business 
object to the lack of initiative in the schools’ product. The 
“follower habit in children is a consequence of the auto- 
cratic government of schools when collected into systems. 
Filled with these motives (developed in schools) 
when he comes into industry, he naturally watches the clock, 
is late in coming in the morning, is quick to jump away at 
the stroke of the bell at the end of the day.” 
For the responsible jobs in industrial life we shall undoubt- 
edly find that the point of view of modern education, ex- 
pressed by Dewey, in Schools of Tomorrow, Kilpatrick and
-P-A-G-E-321
  | 
| VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 305 
others in their discussion of the project method, by Miss 
Parkhurst in Education on the Dalton Plan, and by Sanderson 
of Oundle is the one that promises most. These changes in 
method and organization seek to stimulate nature-given 
powers, not to repress them. The tendency of the new 
school of thought is to venerate those capacities which, 
allowed to develop, are most prized in actual life situations. 
Vocational education of the present must divorce itself more 
completely from the idea of general training, with which it 
was burdened on its first development in the United States ; 
and in this task there are no more useful auxiliaries than 
modern psychology and the new philosophy of method. 
Occupational education must be based upon more 
thorough knowledge of the requirements of each occupation. 
How many persons are engaged in specialized activities? 
How special is the skill required? Just how long a time is 
needed to give that skill? There is vast wastage if the 
student spends four years in a commercial course in order 
to learn to operate an office machine, act as bill or entry 
clerk, or in some other very limited capacity. For one who 
is to serve in such a place would not a broad education be 
best, with intensive drill in the function to be performed? 
All who labor, look forward to leisure. How shall those 
occupy their leisure whose routine job ceases at a given hour 
and whose education has stimulated no deep interest in 
literature, history, music, sociology, economics, or politics?

  CHAPTER XII 
Epucation or ExceprionaL CHILDREN 
A Period of Educational Awakening 
However reluctant one may be to acknowledge the fact, it is none the 
less certain that the task of trying to educate everybody, which our pub- 
lic schools are engaged in, has proved to be far more difficult than the 
originators of the idea of such a possibility thought it would be when they 
set out upon the undertaking. 
No one to-day would challenge this statement by the author 
of The Evolution of Dodd. The past twenty-five years have 
seen a period of awakening from complacency regarding our 
educational system, culminating in the demonstration of the 
unexpected extent of illiteracy and incapacity among enlisted 
men. To reach the goal of universal education requires 
more than compulsory school laws. In the general lack of a 
permanent census of children of school age, tables of statistics 
showing percentage of attendance based on school regis- 
tration have been misleading, and thousands have been 
overlooked. Children, when found, need to be housed in 
school buildings and to be taught by skilled teachers with 
adequate facilities. Campaigns for new buildings and for a 
larger supply of trained teachers, the very great increase in 
state aid, and the demand for a national educational program 
are evidences of the discovery of the need for school extension. 
The quality, as well as the extent, of public education is no 
longer a matter for self-complacency. The survey search- 
light reveals the shortcomings of city and state systems. 
From kindergarten to university, forms of administration, 
courses of study, and methods of instruction are undergoing 
critical investigation. In the effort to find out where we are, 
309
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the problem of whither we are going has not been neglected. 
Academic discussions of the knowledge that is of most worth, 
of individual or social aims, are no longer satisfying. Such 
questions are now referred to the laboratory and to tests 
from practical life. 
Neglect of Exceptional Children 
During the period in review no movement has been more 
marked than that of the education of exceptional children in 
the public schools. It has been a process of the gradual 
discovery of new problems, and of successive steps of differ- 
entiation in school activities. Thus far the movement has 
been limited mainly to large cities where it is possible to 
form classes or schools for various types of children. Even 
here the sense of responsibility was slow in emerging. At- 
tention had been focused on the machinery of the schools, 
on standardized methods — Lancasterian, Socratic, Herbar- 
tian, etc. — and on the introduction of specifics, as physi- 
ology, civics, manual training. Those who did not fit the 
system could shift for themselves. Blind, deaf, and crippled 
children could market their infirmities ; newsboys abounded. 
Incorrigible children were not compelled to sit interminable 
years in school. 
Enforced School Attendance Led to Segregation of 
Incorrigible and Mentally Defective Children 
With the extension of compulsory school laws and their 
more effective enforcement, the machinery became cluttered 
up with intractable material. By necessity, then, came 
classes and schools, probationary or industrial, for incorrigible 
children. Children utterly incapable of making progress in 
school studies were set apart in classes for mental defectives. 
Day schools and classes in regular public schools were 
formed for some of the blind, deaf, and otherwise handi-
-P-A-G-E-327

capped children who had not been gathered up in institu- 
tions. 
Influence of the Child Study Movement, the New 
Psychology, and Mental Measurements 
Along with this tendency to extend the scope of the public 
school and to make special provision for pupils that could not 
be assimilated, came, as a result of the Child Study Move- 
ment, the growing demand for further differentiation to 
meet the needs of newly recognized types of children. Such 
pioneer studies as Warner’s Health of London School Children, 
Galton’s Heredity, and Hall’s Contents of Children’s Minds 
pointed out the significant fact that children differ in physical 
powers, in native ability, in interests, and in experience. 
Child study associations and magazines sprang up in all 
sections of the country. Under the leadership of President 
Hall and the newly founded Clark University, new light was 
sought by means of questionnaires revealing the springs of 
thought and feeling and conduct. The teacher must become 
a naturalist. Observation of children replaced or supple- 
mented formal textbooks on methods of teaching. In the 
place of a psychology of definitions, faculties, and mechanical 
associations appeared James’s Principles of Psychology with 
its ‘Stream of Consciousness,” classification of instincts, and 
laws of habit. The experimental and statistical methods of 
Cattell and Thorndike led to more exact knowledge of native 
ability, instinctive tendencies, and methods of learning. 
For measurement of ability the point of view of the naturalist 
proved inadequate. At one end of the scale came Cattell’s 
tests for Columbia students, and at the other Seguin’s form 
board, or similar devices, for the detection of feeble-minded- 
ness. The movement was furthered by the pressing need of 
more exact classification of school children, as demonstrated 
by such studies as those of Ayres and Thorndike on retar-  
-P-A-G-E-328
  
312 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
dation, and by the use of the Binet scale as adapted by 
Goddard, Huey, and Terman. However, adequate plans 
for remedying the evident inequalities in school grading 
could not be based on mere statistics of retardation or 
acceleration, or on lengthy individual tests of intelligence. 
The demand for specific measurement of accomplishment was 
met, with varying degrees of success, by the standardized 
tests and scales for arithmetic, composition, spelling, writing, 
reading; and the demand for economical measures of native 
ability by group tests which aroused so much popular interest 
when used in the army. The value of these instruments, as 
Captain Cuttle would put it, lies in their application. As 
a basis for a rigid classification and treatment of inferior and 
superior pupils, group tests tend to introduce the vicious 
educational determinism justly condemned by Bagley and 
others. But the possibility that through excessive zeal and 
overconfidence such tests may be pushed to extreme 
conclusions does not detract from their value as a means of 
tentative classification of pupils for further study and 
adjustment. 
Influence of Medical Inspection 
Medical inspection now covers far more than the control 
of contagious diseases. All types of physical deficiency are 
brought to view. Certain defects may be corrected without 
any particular change in the school routine. For other 
groups, such as the tubercular, cardiac, and anemic, special 
adjustment must be made; hence the special classes for 
cardiac children, the assignment of classrooms on the first 
floor to children who have serious heart trouble, open-air 
rooms or buildings for tubercular children, etc. From the 
standpoint of mental and physical efficiency there are few 
normal children. The exceptional child seems to be the 
rule rather than the exception. The United States Bureau
-P-A-G-E-329
  
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 313 
of Education as long ago as 1911 listed twenty-five different 
types of children requiring special classes or schools or some 
form of special adjustment. 
Present Stage Experimental 
Provision for exceptional children is still in the experi- 
mental stage. The great accomplishment thus far is the 
recognition of the fact that there are in the schools various 
groups of children who are unable to profit under the usual 
class grading and instruction, and who are a hindrance to 
the progress of their more fortunate schoolmates, and that 
the welfare of the individual and of society demands radical 
measures of readjustment. Among the most pressing 
problems are: What are the groups for which special 
provision should be made? What are the limits of these 
groups? What is the reliability of the tests for selection? 
What cases should be cared for in institutions? What 
children should be assigned to special schools or classes? 
What deficient or handicapped children should receive 
permanent or temporary aid in order to keep up with the 
regular class? How should teachers of exceptional children 
be selected and trained? What teachers should receive 
additional compensation? What modifications are required 
in the course of study? What special methods of instruc- 
tion? What equipment is needed? What form of admin- 
istration and supervision? What vocational guidance should 
be provided, and what follow-up methods should be used 
after pupils leave school? 
Special Schools and Classes for Incorrigible Children 
During the decade 1890-1900 occurred the first organized 
movement in the public schools toward provision for any 
groups of exceptional children. Cleveland, Chicago, New 
York, and Providence led in the establishment of classes and
-P-A-G-E-330
314 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
schools for truants, disciplinary cases, and backward chil- 
dren. At first the different types of children were not 
clearly differentiated, a condition which has been in a great 
measure remedied through the general use of scientific tests 
and measurements. While provision for these classes of 
children has been greatly extended, it has by no means kept 
up with the demand. Compulsory attendance laws have 
placed in school many who do not desire to be there, and 
they have also increased the disciplinary problems of the 
school. Unruly pupils can no longer be sent home as a 
punishment or be subjected to expulsion. Through the 
extension of the school age the teacher can no longer look 
forward to the age of twelve or fourteen as the time of relief 
from the obstacles to her teaching. A certain measure of 
relief is found in truant, disciplinary, or industrial schools or 
classes. Excellent equipment for industrial training is 
sometimes provided. In practice, however, the educational 
opportunities are nullified by short-term commitments and 
by the abuse of the specious idea of parole. A term of 
punishment is not the equivalent of an education. In the 
numerous cases due to parental neglect, the punishment of 
the parents by fines is more effective than the punishment of 
the delinquent children. Truancy, irregular attendance, 
laziness, and unruly behavior are admitted factors in re- 
tardation and hence in creating subjects for exceptional 
treatment. Unfortunately, the incidence of these faults is 
not confined to the perpetrators. Statistics of retardation 
are relative, they measure the slowness of those who fall 
behind the main body, they do not measure the retardation 
of the entire body of school children. In the opinion of some, 
the disproportionate amount of time given to discipline of 
the unruly and to repetition for the nonstudious is the 
chief cause of our general educational inefficiency. As 
most savages, and many not savage individuals, will not
-P-A-G-E-331
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 315 
work except under the spur of necessity, it may be assumed 
that activity in school tasks on the part of Aristotle’s ‘‘most 
unruly of all animals,” will always, in some measure, be 
contingent upon a memory, or an anticipation, of conse- 
quences. So long as the public attitude remains sentimental 
upon the subject of school discipline, officials will continue 
to go softly and permit the hard problems to strain the 
endurance of the teachers. Among future studies of ex- 
ceptional children we shall look for one on the children who 
make themselves exceptional, and among studies of retar- 
dation a study of disciplinary problems as a cause of general 
retardation. 
Provision for Mentally Defective Children — Need of Earlier 
Selection and of Institutional Care for Lower Grades 
The segregation of mentally deficient children in special 
classes and the study of these children have demonstrated 
some extremely significant facts. There are in the public 
schools a number of children, estimated at from two to four 
per cent, who are of too low a grade of mentality to profit by 
the regular course of study. Claims of parents and some 
physicians that these children should not be deprived of the 
advantages of association with normal children are without 
valid foundation, as these children have but little association 
with the others, and are but slightly impressed by the usual 
social environment. Normal environment to them is one 
that is adapted to their mental status. The selection of 
the mentally deficient is no longer a matter of guessing or of 
demonstration after years of failure in regular classes. Tests 
of the psychologist and psychiatrist are now of sufficient 
accuracy to permit the proper classification of these children 
before entering school. Selection at this stage prevents 
many wasted years and permits greater efficiency in teaching 
normal children. Though the mentally deficient child
-P-A-G-E-332
  
316 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
learns, in general, in the same manner as the normal child, . 
his progress is inordinately slow and requires special stimu- 
lation, and as his period of possible growth is not extended, 
conditions demand that special training begin as early 
as possible. 
Many children — estimated at one half of one per cent — 
now in the public schools, having proved unable, even in 
special classes, to gain the rudiments of an academic or 
vocational education, there has naturally arisen the demand 
that the public schools be relieved of this burden which is 
unprofitable from every standpoint — social, economic, or 
educational. As yet we are lacking in laws regarding the 
care of feeble-minded and epileptic and in a sufficient number 
of institutions of the type of Waverly, Vineland, or Whittier, 
providing adequate social life. 
Need of Grading 
Special classes for mental defectives have done great 
service in the public schools in relieving the regular classes 
and in demonstrating the necessity for the complete or partial 
segregation of certain types. At first these classes were 
ungraded. The next step in evolution, as yet only partially 
carried out, is grading. Only the supernormal child, and to 
some extent the child of normal mentality, has the will, 
initiative, and intelligence to attack and organize projects 
when the successive steps are not clearly differentiated. An 
ungraded class of mentally defective is a promiscuous group. 
In chronological age it may include the extremes of school 
age. The mental status may range from imbecility to the 
shrewdness and cunning of the high-grade moron. Without 
the normal tendency to inhibition, both sexes, mixed, dis- 
play their special problems from infantilism to adolescence. 
Children with the training of refined homes are in contact 
with the uncouth, the untrained in personal habits, and the
-P-A-G-E-333
  
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 317 
moral pervert. The fluent in speech are classed with the 
inarticulate. While some children receive scanty lessons in 
reading, writing, and spelling, others can scarcely attain the 
recognition of a few simple words and cannot write their own 
names. Stringing beads or cutting paper is the limit of some, 
while others, under direction and constant oversight, may 
use a sewing machine, or construct toy houses and animals. 
Social games find:an eager though awkward response from 
part of the group, while others are incapable of responding to 
social stimuli or to simple rhythms. To all these differences 
of age, sex, general intelligence, habits, morals, speech, 
academic attainments, social response, and codrdination, 
may be added various handicaps such as defective vision or 
hearing, chorea or other nervous diseases, malnutrition, 
physical deformity, or cardiac fault, and the impossibility of 
grading is evident. Only by the grouping of classes and by 
the formation of special schools for mental defectives can it be 
brought about that the children may be appropriately 
grouped and provision be made for definitely progressive 
training along simple academic and vocational lines. The 
special class will find its field among the backward children 
including those cases of mental deficiency that are not 
sufficiently pronounced to warrant segregation. Such classes 
will be flexible, permitting ready interchange with the 
various classes of the school. 
The Need for Clinical and Sanitarium Schools 
Special schools for observation, readjustment, and re- 
education serve only a limited field in connection with 
hospitals, universities, or private venture. As an adjunct 
to the public school system they will become an invaluable 
means of salvage. They are needed in order to provide 
adequate means for diagnoses in difficult cases of maladjust- 
ment, for the recovery of physical and mental balance, and
-P-A-G-E-334
318 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
for the discovery of latent ability. Children, as well as their 
parents, sometimes must get away from home to get a new 
viewpoint. 
Classes for the Physically Handicapped — Deaf, Blind, 
and Crippled Children 
The history of classes for deaf, blind, and crippled children 
in the public schools shows a gradual transition from private 
to public responsibility. Children who were evidently in- 
capable of profiting by the ordinary routine of school work 
and who were handicapped as regards the possibility of 
becoming self-supporting were regarded as objects of charity. 
Attendance in institutions depended upon the willingness of 
parents to relinquish their unfortunate children. As yet 
not all compulsory school laws include these groups. The 
admission of these children into the public schools has been 
furthered by the improved technique in the special methods 
of teaching and by a new social viewpoint regarding the 
handicapped members of society. As it is not desirable for 
the deaf to associate only with the deaf, the blind with the 
blind, etc., it is important that normal associations with the 
home, the school, and society be formed as early as possible. 
Chicago led the way in admitting the blind to day schools 
in 1900. The classes for the physically exceptional children 
are as yet limited to a few of the larger cities. It is hardly 
possible to make provision for this type of children in the 
communities where there are not enough pupils to form a 
class. However, with the enlarged experience in transpor- 
tation of pupils and the wide area that can be covered with a 
motor bus it may be possible in future greatly to extend 
facilities. 
Crippled children need specially planned desks and are 
usually unable to move from room to room. The blind and 
deaf children are able to move from room to room and should 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 319 
associate with normal children as much as possible, the work 
of the special teacher supplementing the instruction in the 
regular classroom. The outstanding feature in the educa- 
tion of the blind is the recent adoption of the Braille as the 
universal type. This will greatly increase the range of 
reading material. Not less important is the differentiation 
between the blind and the partially blind, and in case of the 
latter the substitution of very large type for the point letters. 
In the sight-saving classes, introduced in Boston and Cleve- 
land in 1913 and a little later in New York, pupils are enabled 
to use effectively and safely the remnant of sight which they 
possess. 
Not less important than a plentiful supply of books in 
point type for the blind is a supply of books printed in the 
large type for the semi-blind. Teachers of sight conservation 
classes spend a large part of their time in reproducing selec- 
tions from the textbooks in large hand or in reading aloud the 
books which the children are unable to use. Much time and 
money could be saved if more textbooks were printed in 
large type for the sight conservation classes. The Howe 
Publishing Society for the Blind of Cleveland has rendered 
great service in this direction, but the expense of these 
special editions, together with the limited demand, points to 
the need of national aid similar to the subvention of the press 
for the blind. 
While it is desirable for deaf as well as blind or crippled 
children to associate with normal children, so far as possible, 
it is more difficult to assimilate the deaf in a regular school. 
Without the power of hearing, the children can gain little 
from the ordinary schoolroom. The power of lip reading 
and of articulate speech requires many years of highly tech- 
nical instruction. For this reason, day schools for the deaf 
have been more favored than separate classes. The newest 
feature of instruction in these schools is the cultivation
-P-A-G-E-336
  
320 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
of the so-called ‘‘residual hearing.” Many pupils hitherto 
treated as totally deaf are enabled to supplement lip reading 
by experience of music and auditory language. The selec- 
tion of pupils subject to physical handicaps has called 
attention not only to varying degrees of physical disability 
but to the wide range in mental capacity. In accordance 
with the general tendency to more and more differentiation 
it has become necessary to form special classes of mentally 
defective blind, deaf, or crippled children. 
Limit to the Segregation of Exceptional Children 
The advantage of the segregation of certain types of 
children is unquestioned. Those who are mentally and 
morally unfitted for association with other children, who are 
incapable of profiting by such association, are better provided 
for in special schools. For other types of children, as has 
been demonstrated, special classes are needed with more or 
less association with the regular classes. The deaf, the blind, 
and crippled children and those suffering from tubercular and 
certain other diseases need facilities and additional care 
which usually involves separate classes. What provision 
should be made for children who are backward in their 
studies, who are handicapped by illness, by irregular attend- 
ance, ignorance of the English language, defective speech, 
etc.? Various measures are employed for these large, 
constantly changing groups of children. In some cities 
innumerable types of classes have been formed, in others an 
attempt is made to solve the problem by flexible forms of 
grading or by the assignment of special teachers to the schools, 
to render aid to special groups or individuals. The special 
class work may be organized and controlled from without the 
school or it may be managed within the individual school 
itself. Organization of work for schools suffering from de- 
fective speech may be taken as illustrative of the treatment
-P-A-G-E-337
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 321 
of backward children or those suffering from remedial de- 
fects. 
Correction of Speech Defects as an Illustration of Organization 
of Aid for Exceptional Children 
The first classes for speech improvement were organized 
in New York in 1909. Special teachers are very generally 
employed for this purpose in elementary and high schools. 
Defective speech has been recognized as one of the most 
serious handicaps. In degree it reaches from entire inability 
to speak, or distressing stuttering, to lisping and other minor 
defects. Speech work may be organized by assigning 
teachers to go from school to school, or the teacher may 
remain in one school and teach groups of children from 
various other schools, or a certain school may be selected 
to make a specialty of speech training and children from a 
distance may be assigned to this school as regular pupils. 
The second plan is superior to the first in providing better 
facilities in the way of classrooms and equipment; the third 
is the more valuable from the educational standpoint. Let 
us take speech work as a type illustration of method of 
organization of work for exceptional children. Select a 
teacher who is an expert in phonetics and the psychology of 
speech. Then have her assigned to a school under the 
charge of a principal who is interested and informed upon the 
subject. Daily drills are given to various groups for short 
periods, and the regular lessons are but slightly interfered 
with. All the teachers of the school are trained in phonetics 
and are interested in following up the work of the special 
teacher. All of the pupils become interested in the improve- 
ment of speech, and an atmosphere of helpfulness is created 
for the children who have the greatest speech difficulties. 
It is realized that speech is not, as popularly understood, a 
matter of direct imitation, but that itis learned by trial  
-P-A-G-E-338
  322 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and error as are other habits. The cruder methods of train- 
ing in oral English are gradually replaced by more direct 
methods. The general interest in the correction of speech 
defects leads to the effort to prevent speech difficulties, and 
the procedure of the classroom is adjusted accordingly. 
Early lessons in reading no longer permit the breaking up 
of the children’s habits of natural speech. Children who 
cannot speak are taught to produce sounds correctly, and 
correct speech habits are cultivated. Those with faulty 
articulation or a tendency to stutter are corrected. All the 
problems of reading, both oral and silent, of spelling, of oral 
and written composition, are attacked from the standpoint 
of psychology of speech. In this way not only are many 
speech difficulties eliminated and special class work ren- 
dered unnecessary, but all the pupils of the school are 
gaining in language power through the improved methods 
of teaching. The influence of the special speech teacher 
is felt throughout the school. The general attention to 
special training and reading according to the principles 
of psychology of language and of modern phonetics take 
care of the slow readers and spellers except in extreme 
cases where supplementary aid is needed. Foreign children 
are cared for along the same lines. 
Differentiation by Schools 
While one school may be giving special attention to the 
problems connected with speech, other schools may expand 
along different special lines, with classes for the blind or 
semi-blind, deaf, crippled children, tubercular, etc. Where 
the pupils can move about freely from room to room there 
is nothing to prevent their being taught in regular classes, 
while receiving special help along the line of their handicaps 
or deficiencies. What is needed is not so much special 
classes and teachers with special licenses, as teachers of 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 323 
adaptability who will study the special problem of children. 
It should be possible for a principal to assign teachers to any 
groups of children needing special aid, and it is not necessary 
that these children all be blind or deaf or crippled or mentally 
deficient or truants. The training of teachers for such 
special work has made great progress, particularly by means 
of short courses given in normal schools and by various 
associations. The training of the teachers in service is of 
the utmost importance. The school is the best laboratory. 
Growth should be expected of all teachers ; instead of fixity 
in position, there should be flexibility in assignment. Any 
intelligent teacher, principal, supervisor, or superintendent 
who has reached a stage of arrested development along 
certain lines should be given a new type of work to do, mak- 
ing it necessary to undertake new studies. Assignments of 
this kind would result in the care of exceptional children 
becoming a great boon to the entire system. 
Gifted Children 
Scientific measurement has demonstrated that many 
pupils are not working up to their capacity, and has made it 
possible to detect children of promise. It has focused at- 
tention upon these children and has aroused the suspicion 
that in limitation to the progress of the mass the children 
of superior ability are not getting a square deal, and so- 
ciety |is failing to train its leaders. The newer view of 
democracy in education is that opportunity should equal 
ability. 
Various experiments in grading were aimed at breaking the 
“lockstep,’’ which was exposed by Superintendents Harris 
and Shearer. Their object was to enable pupils of ability 
to move through the grades more readily than others. 
Individual instruction was the basis of the Pueblo plan 
and of the more recent Dalton plan. The Batavia plan 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  
324 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
employed assistant teachers. Cambridge adopted a system 
of short circuit by means of parallel grades. New York 
provided “opportunity classes.”’ Distinct from time-saving 
plans was the movement to revive and enrich the curriculum 
to appeal to the interests and aptitudes of pupils and to 
conform to the demands of society. Dewey’s School and 
Society, the Chicago experimental school, and the Gary plan 
are landmarks in this movement. The junior high school 
has its wide range of choice for pupils beyond the sixth grade. 
The problem is attacked from another angle by project 
methods and the socialized recitation, which aim to stimulate 
initiative and to secure the codperation of pupils in organizéd 
undertakings, each according to his ability. 
The extended use of intelligence tests indicated a curve of 
distribution with a superior group corresponding to the 
lower group which had been the first object of attention. 
The possibility of selecting children of decidedly superior 
ability involves the responsibility to utilize talent in the 
interest of the individual and of society. Should not the 
schools make special provision for gifted pupils as well as 
for the backward or deficient? Should these selected groups 
receive individual or class instruction? Should they be 
placed in special classes or receive special attention in regular 
classes? Should the aim be merely rapid advancement or 
more intensive study, with additional subjects? Experi- 
ments in all these directions are under way. Attempts to do 
continuously two years’ work in one have not met with 
undoubted success. The groups do not prove to be homo- 
geneous. Children of approximately the same intelligence 
quotient differ in health, in nervous stability, in memory, in 
will, in training, and in interests. Some cannot keep up the 
pace, and fall out by the way. The advisability of merely 
doing the same things as other children in less time is ques- 
tioned. At present, the trend seems to be in the direction of 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
  EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 825 
more intensive work, with supplementary studies in foreign 
languages, art, and science. 
Danger of Unfair Discrimination 
A great drawback to the extension of special opportunities 
for certain groups of children is that such measures frequently 
result in the withdrawal of opportunities from other groups. 
The selection of the best teachers for special classes leaves 
the weaker teachers for the regular classes. Workshops, 
laboratories, and other special facilities may be limited to 
certain groups. Smaller classes for special types of children 
thay result in larger classes for the normal children. A 
striking illustration of the reactionary incidence of an 
apparently progressive movement is found in the junior 
high school. This type of school has naturally aroused great 
interest. New and improved buildings, the best teachers, 
induced by higher salaries, wide range of electives, earlier 
introduction of secondary studies, offer opportunities for 
pupils after six years in school; but what about the first six 
years? The advocate of the junior high usually assumes that 
the elementary schools will be taught and supervised by 
women only, at lower salaries than in the higher school. 
The over-age boy as well as the specially bright boy will be 
entirely deprived of the influence of men during the entire 
period of elementary education. Such attractive features 
as shopwork are postponed. It is a question whether the 
advantages to be had after six years in school will be an 
adequate return for the six dreary years. 
Are the schools as a whole gaining in efficiency through the 
movement to form new schools and classes after every dis- 
covery of a new type of child? Is there not danger that the 
normal children, if there are any, are failing to receive their 
due measure of attention? For the success of special schools 
and classes it is necessary to enlist the most successful and
-P-A-G-E-342
  
326 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
interesting teachers. As these teachers are drawn by higher 
salaries and are given a new status, they do not return to the 
regular schools, which not only lose their best teachers but 
the advantage of the specialized training and experience. 
Adjustment of the course of study to the capacity of pupils 
and the demand of modern life is frequently apt to be con- 
fined to new and favored types of schools and special classes. 
The enrichment of the curriculum in spots tends to impover- 
ishment elsewhere. If selected groups must be favored by 
having the best and sunniest rooms, superior equipment, and 
smaller classes, the unselected groups must work under less 
favorable conditions. Is there no way to organize work for 
exceptional children in such a way that the advantages 
gained by having superior teachers, special training and 
experience, flexibility in courses of study, and favorable con- 
ditions could be shared with the unexceptional children? 
There can be no question that the exceptional child is 
the gainer by having exceptional advantages. That the 
gain is commensurate with the outlay is open to question. 
The homogeneous group is a fiction. A class selected 
according to one defect or quality may vary in all other 
respects. This is the outstanding feature of special classes 
and schools. There is no limit to the process of differentia- 
tion. 
Need of Integration as Well as Differentiation 
Our school systems, then, are undergoing a continued 
process of differentiation with an inadequate integration. 
From the main system, as new demands arise, a new sub- 
ordinate system is created, with supervision, teachers, 
budget, etc., independent of other school functions. The 
apparent simplicity of each new system vanishes as the 
exceptional children provided for are found to have all the 
other exceptions. Schools become not organizations but
-P-A-G-E-343
  
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 327 
collections of classes. Different types of classes are under 
the charge of their special directors or supervisors. Minute 
details are determined by the director who spends the 
money for supplies, admits and discharges pupils, and gen- 
erally directs, at a distance, the work of the teacher. In any 
special class except those for low-grade mental defectives 
and for pupils too weak or crippled to move from room to 
room, the pupils may profit by taking most of their lessons in 
regular classes. Here they are taught by teachers who do 
not receive added compensation for this additional work — 
the special teacher frequently receives a ‘‘bonus.” Special 
classes for exceptional children have served a good purpose in 
proving the existence of groups of children who need special 
attention ; they have also served to prove their limitation as 
a final solution of their special problems. Various tendencies, 
some already mentioned, point in a more promising direction. 
The Exceptional Child a Social Problem 
The problem of the exceptional child belongs not only to 
the public school but to the community at large. To begin 
at the beginning: in some form or other the facts of heredity, 
the ideals of eugenics, and an enlightened birth control must 
in time diminish the proportion of handicapped and deficient 
children. The local and national policy of prenatal care 
aims that all children shall be well born and free from avoid- 
able taint and weakness. The accidents and dangers of 
birth are guarded against by restrictions regarding midwives 
and by the offices of the district nurse. The prevention of 
blindness is making marked progress through treatment at 
birth and through a campaign of education regarding the 
preservation of sight. The dangers of infancy are being 
minimized by labor and maternity measures, clinics, day 
nurseries, pure milk supply, and by the education of mothers. 
Through the activities of Boards of Health and associated
-P-A-G-E-344
328 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
physicians, contagious diseases are brought under control, 
with a consequent diminution of the number of children 
physically and mentally handicapped by such diseases. 
The Schick treatment, for instance, bids fair to eliminate 
diphtheria, as smallpox has been eliminated. Many children 
are retarded not only by the remedial handicaps with which 
they enter school, but by the loss of time and strength 
through surgical and medical treatment. Already the forces 
of the schools, the Red Cross, psychiatry, medicine, dentistry, 
etc., are being mobilized to meet this evil at the threshold of 
school life. Adenoids and tonsils, teeth, nutrition, nervous 
disorder, are attended to before admission to school. 
Figures of retardation are frequently employed as an 
index of school efficiency. Such an inference would be 
justified if all children entered school with equal capacity, 
with equal powers of endurance, and with similar environ- 
ment. It is wrongly assumed that they get an equal start 
by beginning at the same age. The most cursory examina- 
tion of a first-year class shows that some pupils are immature 
and others could have earlier learned to read without injury. 
It is not difficult for the psychologist to determine approx- 
imately the mental age of a child five or six years old. This 
estimate is now accepted in a few cities as the basis for 
admission to school. 
During the first school year children tend to retardation 
not only through vaccination and other diseases naturally or 
artificially acquired and through various difficulties of adjust- 
ment, but by entering the class late in the term, upon their 
arrival at the compulsory age. Discouragement and lack 
of concentration naturally follow, and the result is an addi- 
tion to the number of exceptional children. The first school 
day should be the same for all beginners. Upon entering 
school all children need the care of the most sympathetic, 
the most intelligent, and the best trained teachers. Instead
-P-A-G-E-345

of withdrawing the best teachers to take classes of exceptional 
children, an enlightened policy will place them in the first 
years to reduce the number of exceptional children. If any 
bonus is required for exceptional ability, scientific training, 
and hard work, it should go to the teachers in the first year. 
The New School 
During the child’s attendance at school every effort should 
be made to avoid the need for treatment in special classes. 
Difficulties of adjustment should be overcome as far as 
possible by special assistant teachers, by school visitors, and 
by the coéperation of hospitals and clinics. The educational 
guidance begun in the schools will be followed up to aid the 
adjustment of the exceptional children to economic society, 
and the industries themselves will be adapted to the ability 
of the workers. Henry Ford has demonstrated that pro- 
ductive work for the blind, the crippled, the deaf, and other 
defectives can be found in industrial establishments. School 
and society must combine to secure the economic independ- 
ence of all who are by any means able to win the means of 
support. 
The freedom and initiative sought for in the pupils will be 
tolerated and encouraged in teachers and principals. No 
two schools will be alike. Principals will no longer be clerks, 
but educators, with power over the assignment of teachers, 
the formation of ‘classes, the making of the course of study, 
and the special aids for all types of exceptional children. 
The problem of grading is shifting from the grading of 
children to the grading of studies. The plan generally 
followed thus far has been to grade the children according 
to age and then divide up the studies accordingly. The 
critical point in the application of plans for individual 
instruction and for the teaching of exceptional children is 
the selection and grading of material. What are the re-
-P-A-G-E-346
  330 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
actions and habits of most value to individuals and society? 
What forms of activity may be left to the processes of growth 
or imitation and what require formal instruction? What 
factors are common and basic in various social activities, 
requiring opportunity for frequent practice, and valuable 
alike for bright and slow pupils? What factors can be left 
for the bright pupils alone? With the more exact analysis 
and grading of material, greater success may be anticipated 
from the various forms of individualized instruction. Per- 
ceptible progress has been made in the practical analysis 
and grading of spelling, grammar, and arithmetic. The 
power to read affords an instrument of growth that is largely 
overlooked. As a by-product to other studies success in 
reading is not assured. For the bright child nearly all 
. knowledge is attainable through reading. Books become 
the best teachers. Even in the case of the dullest children, 
the cultivation of the language arts provides the key for the 
moderate accomplishments attainable. 
The advance in the education of exceptional children will 
keep pace with the advance in the education of all children. 
More scientific training of teachers, greater skill in instruc- 
tion, broader school curriculum, better gradation of studies, 
a generous supply of reading material and other equipment, 
smaller classes, better textbooks, special aid at any time for 
pupils needing assistance, will prove to the advantage of all 
types of children. With the best efforts of teachers and 
school authorities, the care of the exceptional children re- 
quires the codperation of the home and nearly every form of 
social agency. The school must be the focus of community 
effort.

Tur Epucation or WoMEN 
Educational Situation at the Close of the Century 
In the closing years of the nineteenth century signs were 
not lacking that the long struggle to secure equality of edu- 
cational opportunity for women was almost won. Like a 
deep-moving tide, the movement had slowly risen and grown 
in power, sweeping, in the latter decades, over obstructions 
and drowning the protests of alarmed conservatives. The 
dark prophecies of opponents of the cause that the exacting 
intellectual demands of higher education would undermine 
the health of young women, reveal their innate mental in- 
feriority, rob them of all feminine charm, and lead them to 
neglect home and children in a feverish pursuit of Greek 
roots or the intricacies of quadratic equations, had proved 
to be without foundation. Young women had demonstrated 
to the satisfaction of all but the most captious critics that

was established as the first great milestone in the liberal 
education of American womanhood. When Matthew 
Vassar, with high faith in the possibilities of women and 
with praiseworthy courage in the face of no little public 
disfavor, opened the doors of a college for women, whose

standards were never to fall below those of the best colleges 
for men, his firm declaration of faith revealed clearly enough 
the nature of the criticisms that had been leveled against 
his farseeing experiment : 
It is my hope, indeed, it has been the main incentive to all I have al- 
ready done or may hereafter do or hope to do, to inaugurate a new era in 
the history and life of woman. I wish to give one sex all the advantages

“dead, already defented! before we comments if sash develodment be in the 
least dangerous to the dearest attributes of her sex. We are not the less 
defeated if it be hazardous for her to avail herself of her highest educated 
powers when that point is gained. We are defeated if we start upon the 
assumption that she has no powers save those she may derive or imitate 
from the other sex. We are defeated if we recognize the idea that she may 
not, with every propriety, contribute to the world the benefit of matured 
faculties which education works. We are especially defeated if we fail 
to express by our acts our practical belief in her preéminent powers asan 
instructor of her own sex. 
No doubt the breakdown of prejudices against the higher 
education of women, so marked in the final decade of the 
nineteenth century, was hastened by rapid changes in 
economic conditions that were sending millions of women 
into gainful employment and thousands into the professions 
of teaching, medicine, and law. Clearly the time was pass- 
ing when fathers and brothers assumed as a matter of course 
the burden of supporting unmarried or widowed female 
relations — not only daughters and sisters but aunts and 
cousins, untrained to self-support. The theory that eco- 
nomic independence was as honorable a state for women as 
for men and its converse almost as discreditable, having 
once been launched upon a dubious world, appeared to be 
gaining strong headway. Furthermore, the relation of 
sound education to economic advancement began to be 
perceived with respect to women as it had long been under- 
stood in the case of men.

  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 337 
The educational opportunities open to women at this 
time were varied and generous indeed when compared with 
those of their grandmothers. A few statistics may not be out 
of place here as evidence of the very general utilization of 
these advantages by girls and women. In 1897 the public 
secondary schools of the country enrolled 255,988 girls and 
the private secondary schools 54,415, —a total of 290,403. 
It is noteworthy that for several years the number of girls 
utilizing the advantages of high school education had 
exceeded that of boys by many thousands. In 1897 the ee ee 
percentage of girls i lic high schools w: - 
pared_with 42.36 per cent_of boys. The normal schools 
had, from their foundation, made a stronger appeal to young 
women than to men, chiefly for economic reasons. There- 
fore it is not surprising to learn that, in the year under con- 
sideration, there. were 30,592 women students in public 
normal schools as compared with 12,607 men. When we 
turn to higher education, we find that there were enrolled 
the following numbers of women students :

To this number should be added 12,891 women in schools 
of technology, including agricultural and mechanical arts 
colleges, technical schools, and schools of applied science. 
The admission of women to the graduate schools of eastern 
universities was comparatively recent at this time. Yale 
and the University of Pennsylvania had led the way, open- 
ing certain of their graduate departments in 1892. Owing 
chiefly to the generous efforts of President Low, Columbia 
University, in 1900, admitted women to its nonprofessional 
graduate schools of political science, philosophy, and pure

science. But the graduate schools of Harvard, Princeton, 
and the seaboard state universities of the South were almost 
without exception barred against women.! Despite the 
cautious policy of the East there were in 1897-98, 2173 
women enrolled in graduate schools of coeducational uni- 
versities and 225 in similar departments of women’s colleges. 
In that same year the A.M. degree was conferred upon 171 
women and the Ph.D. degree upon 37 women. Significant 
of the ever-growing interest of America in the higher edu- 
cation of women is the fact that during the twenty-year 
period from 1890-1910 the rate of increase of men students 
in institutions for higher learning was 214.2 per cent, while 
that of women students in coeducational universities was 
438 per cent and in women’s colleges was 348.4 per cent. 
As early as 1897 there were nearly one third as many women 
as men in collegiate departments of universities or in colleges 
and in twenty years there were destined to be more than 
three fifths as many women students as men. 
Not so easily, however, was public opinion persuaded 
to a belief in professional training for women. In America, 
as in Great Britain, this cause was but partially won at the 
close of the last century. The enrollment of women in 
professional schools in the year 1897-98 was as follows:

THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 339 
Inequalities in the Educational Opportunities of Women. 
Although the long struggle to obtain equal educational 
advantages for women had overcome its most serious ob- 
stacles by the close of the nineteenth century, it would re- 
quire a determined optimist, with eyes closed to the facts, 
to maintain that such equality already existed. A glance 
at the conditions prevalent in higher and professional edu- 
cation for women will serve to dispel such an idea. 
With respect to gifts and bequests to promote higher edu- 
cation, the women’s colleges, including the coeducational 
universities, lagged far behind the men’s. In 1896-97 the 
benefactions to the latter institutions totaled $7,608,144, 
whereas those to 157 women’s colleges (Grades A and B) 
reached the small total of $647,338. It may rightly be ob- 
jected here that the men’s institutions far outnumber the 
women’s and this fact would go far to account for the dis- 
parity. Nevertheless this does not wholly account for so 
marked an inequality as is evidenced by the apportionment 
in 1896-97 of such benefactions among four eastern colleges 
for women and an equal number of eastern universities for 
men.

Nor is this sharp disparity peculiar to the year 1896-97, 
for in the following year the list of benefactions to four east- 
ern colleges for women and four for men is as follows: !

Of course this inequality may be explained in large part 
by the fact that the alumni of men’s universities are a rich 
and influential body, whereas the alumnz of women’s col- 
leges are not. Moreover, the age and prestige of the older 
universities, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Colum- 
bia, make a powerful appeal to wealthy men beneficently 
inclined toward education. But it nevertheless remains 
true that the gross discrepancy is in part due to the relative 
feebleness of the public interest and faith in the higher edu- 
cation of women at that time and, to a less degree, at present. 
In the New York press, in 1922, a man long interested in 
colleges for women urged public-spirited citizens to assist 
the alumne of these institutions in their heartbreaking 
effort to raise endowment funds, pointing out that by far 
the greater part of all gifts for higher education in America 
passed into the treasuries of universities for men, already 
richly endowed. 
A further inequality with respect to women’s education 
was evident in the matter of scholarships and fellowships 
for graduate study and research. In 1890 a fund of $23,360 
was available for graduate scholarships for men; but 
not one scholarship had then been instituted for women. 
However, a scholarship fund of $1200 was available for 
either men or women students in state universities. In 
the same year (1889-90) the fellowships open to men 
amounted to $70,798, those for women to $2300. A fund
-P-A-G-E-357
  
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 341 
of $14,950 was also available for fellowships for both 
sexes. 
But far more important than these minor inequities was 
the curtailment of women’s opportunities for professional 
education as well as for practical training in the professions. 
In 1897 few women were enrolled in theological schools and 
indeed relatively few were open to women. Of the 155 
theological schools listed in the Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1897-98 only 27 reported an enrollment of 
women students. Somewhat better conditions prevailed 
in the law schools, of which 83 were listed in the Report. 
In 44 of these schools 147 women were pursuing courses 
in law; but it is noteworthy that no woman student was 
enrolled in the most distinguished schools of the country — 
in Harvard, Yale, and Columbia — since those institutions 
were locked, bolted, and barred against them. _Moreover, 
as late as 1902 only Santy. stetes hed admitted vomes te the practice of law. en we turn to the profession of 
medicine, we find that women were pursuing coursesin 90 
of the 158 medical schools listed, most of these be- 
ing connected with state universities. But again we find 
that certain of the finest medical schools in the coun- 
try — Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Rush Medical School 
in Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania — refused 
to receive women. More serious, however, than the fact 
that the professional training furnished by the nation’s 
leading schools was not available for women was the state 
of popular opinion with regard to the woman who aspired 
to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a minister. Unquestionably 
such an aspirant was looked upon as a more 0 less ridicul 
freak of nature. 
professional women operated to inder, i i vent, 
ir chosen work, Especially is this evident 
in the field of medicine. Women who had done creditable      
       
-P-A-G-E-358
342 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and even distinguished work in medical courses, and looked 
forward with hope to the practice of their profession, soon 
discovered that very few hospitals were willing to receive 
fhem aS internes; thus their practical training in hospital 
wards and in clinics was seriously curtailed. Moreover, 
up to this time no woman physician had been appointed on 
the medical staff of a single public hospital or asylum. So 
flagrant was the discrimination against women that Dr. Mary 
Jacobi drew up a bill, which was introduced into the New 
York Legislature in 1897, providing that the State Board 
of Charities should consist of two women and three men, 
instead of a board of three men as then constituted. In so 
doing Dr. Jacobi believed that she had taken “‘the surest 
way in which to obtain the appointment of women physicians 
in all public institutions and the admission of women stu- 
dents to the hospitals.” 
Unfortunately, discrimination against women in the pro- 
fessions was not confined to medicine, law, and theology. 
In the field of education it was strikingly apparent that the 
higher administrative positions were almost wholly in the 
hands of men. In 1901 only two women in the United 
States held the position of State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, in the states of Colorado and Idaho, and only 
12 that of city superintendent. However, 284 women at this 
time were county superintendents, most_of these posi- 
tions being held in western states. In but 13 states — all 
save one (Louisiana) in the West — were women eligible to all 
school offices, although they might hold all local offices in 18 
additional states. Moreover, women had equal suffrage with 
men on all school questions in only four far-western states. 
This situation is all the more significant when we remember 
the very real interest most mothers have shown in the edu- 
cation of their children. Add to this the fact that at this 
time the women teachers in elementary and normal schools
-P-A-G-E-359
THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 343 
overwhelmingly outnumbered the men, whilein public second- 
ary schools 52.7 per cent of the instructors were women, and 
the tremendous power of the traditional American theory 
that the administration of education properly belongs only 
to men will be appreciated. In her second visit to the 
United States in 1908, Miss Sara Burstall, Head Mistress 
of the Manchester High School for Girls in England, vigor- 
ously expressed her views on this question : 
The subordinate position of women in educational institutions in Amer- 
ica shows itself more and more clearly the more one studies; the higher 
up the scale one goes from the kindergarten to the university the worse 
is the position of women. Organization, initiative, administration, gov- 
ernment, are in the hands of men... . This condition of things, in a 
country where women occupy a far better position generally than any- 
where in the world, and where they are given the precedence in all kinds 
of ways, is very remarkable. We do not remember to have seen it noticed 
by students of American education. Americans themselves take their 
own system as natural and proper, and they are in general not acquainted 
with the work of English women in education. It is perhaps only a 
woman concerned in administration in England who would feel the differ- 
ence, but as the writer progressed from place to place it was more deeply 
impressed upon her, especially the difference in matters of government. 
It was discussed with Americans, and from the conversation the view 
gradually emerged that Americans do not consider administration as the 
natural and proper work for women. They feel it to be essentially men’s 
ee ee they admit that the exceptional woman may and does do 
it well.’ 
But the inequalities in the professional opportunities 
of women in education did not stop with administrative 
positions. A marked disparity also existed with respect 
to appointments to college and university faculties. In 
1897 there were but 902 women teaching in the collegiate 
departments of universities and colleges for both sexes, 
as contrasted with 6750 men; and only 53 women 
instructors were in the professional departments to 
these institutions. To these numbers should be added 
1834 women professors and instructors in Grade A and 
1 Impressions of American Education in 1908, p. 275.

B colleges for women. Commenting, in 1902, upon the 
declaration of a prominent educator that there appeared 
to be “‘a scarcity of women possessed of the proper qualifi- 
cations and training for the highest positions in college 
work,” President Harper of the University of Chicago ex- 
pressed serious doubt concerning the correctness of the 
statement. On the contrary, he declared it to be his belief 
that the women being graduated with the doctor’s degree 
from the best American universities were, “in almost every 
particular, as able and as strong as the men.” Rather did 
he attribute the situation to the fact that to women few 
places on college faculties are offered. He writes as fol- 
lows: 
The fact is that to women there do not come the opportunities to show 
their strength which come to men. In colleges and universities for men 
only, women may not find a place upon the faculty. In a certain great 
state university, in which there are as many women students as men 
students, women are represented in the faculty by a single individual, 
and she has been appointed within the last three years. In some of the 
women’s colleges, women find a place. In others, second-rate and third- 
rate men are preferred to women of first-rate ability. The number of 
faculties of colleges and universities on which women have appointments 
in any number is very small, and even in certain institutions in which 
women have gained secure footing there is often greater or less distress 
among the men of the various departments if even one or two women are 
appointed. And yet, is it possible that the heads of our state institutions 
— institutions which are established for the people and conducted with 
the people’s money; institutions which are professedly democratic be- 
yond all others — deliberately refuse to recommend the appointment of 
women even when they have attained equal rank with men in scholarship 
and efficiency? So far as I can ascertain, during the past year the ap- 
pointments of women, east and west, even in coeducational institutions, 
have numbered very few — fewer, perhaps, than ever before. Is this 
progress? Or is it rather a concession to prejudices which, instead of 
growing weaker, are growing stronger? I venture to ask the regents of 
our state universities and the trustees of our coeducational institutions to 
consider this question; and I think it not inappropriate to suggest for 
the consideration of the trustees of certain women’s colleges the question 
whether, in this matter, they have given tor women the full opportunity 
they deserve

THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 345 
Educational Progress in the Last Twenty-five Years 
(1897-1922) 
The foregoing discussion may serve to make plain that 
the twentieth century was confronted with not a few un- 
satisfactory and difficult situations in respect to the educa- 
tion and training of women and the opening to them of new 
opportunities for congenial work. Nevertheless the first 
two decades of the century have witnessed steady progress, 
not alone in the fields of secondary, higher, and professional 
education but in the inception of new educational move- 
ments for securing a more satisfactory education for women. 
Increasingly, educators have come to perceive that the 
schools owe something more to the girl, as well as the boy, 
than the imparting of useful information or even the develop- 
ment of a ‘‘cultivated” mind, in the historic meaning of 
the word. Discontent with a too bookish education has 
become widely prevalent since the opening of the century 
and has expressed itself in a variety of practical experiments 
and new educational organizations. 
Progress in Secondary and Higher Education 
The advances made in the long-established schools are 
shown chiefly in three ways: (1) in an enormous growth in 
numbers, (2) in the enrichment of school and college offerings, 
(8) in a differentiation of secondary and higher education 
to meet the needs of students of widely different interests 
and plans for future gainful employment. The move- 
ment to furnish an education adapted to students of varying 
needs began before the end of the last century, as is evidenced 
by the industrial, manual training, and commercial courses 
introduced at that time in some public high schools. This 
tendency has gained strong headway during the last twenty- 
five years and has resulted at present in a rich and varied
-P-A-G-E-362
  
346 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
offering in at least the fully accredited, four-year secondary 
schools of our larger cities and towns. In 1917-18, as shown 
in the Biennial Survey of Education published by the United 
States Bureau of Education, 95.12 per cent of the 13,951 
high schools reporting were offering an academic course; 
21.17 per cent, a commercial course; 13.13 per cent, a tech- 
nical or manual training course; 8.78 per cent, a teacher- 
training course; 14.42 per cent, an agricultural course; 
20.54 per cent, a home economics course; and 1.79 per cent, 
a trade training course. The proportion of girls enrolled in 
these various departments makes plain the fact that the 
historic academic course, surrounded as it is with an aura of 
prestige, is still by far the most popular department with 
women students and the trade-training course the least.

the vocational courses are not winning their way very 
rapidly. The public high schools of the United States are 
still predominantly engaged in preparing students to meet 
college entrance requirements. It may truly be said that in 
general ‘‘there has been a greater tendency for the schools 
to offer vocational courses than for students to enroll in such 
courses.” This statement applies more fully to girls than 
to boys, since the proportion of high school boys entering 
gainful occupations continues to be higher than that of girls. 
With respect to the number of students enjoying the ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 347 
vantages of high school education it may be said that the 
increase in the last twenty years is notable when compared 
with that of European countries. Of the army of 1,645,171 
secondary students in the schools reporting in 1918 it is a 
little surprising that 940,315, or 57.2 per cent, were girls. 
Twenty years before (1898), there were but 260,413 girls 
enrolled in public high schools, constituting 57.9 per cent 
of the total enrollment. It would appear, then, that the 
percentile increase of girls over boys in our high schools has 
not continued during a period of two decades. Even at 
present a larger proportion of boys than of girls enters col- 
lege from each type of high school. The figures are 39 per 
cent of boys and not quite 22 per cent of girls. Probably 
most young women who continue their education beyond 
high school attend commercial or normal schools. 
Turning to higher education, the progress in respect to the 
number of women students is no less striking. In 1898 
there were 32,485 women in the collegiate departments 
of universities and colleges, whereas in 1919-20 there were 
128,677 — an increase of more than 296 per cent in twenty- 
one years. The proportion of women to men in the collegiate 
departments of these institutions has likewise increased 
during this period from 52.9 per cent to 60.5 per cent. At 
this rate of increase the enrollment of women in collegiate 
departments in universities and colleges may equal that of 
men in another twenty-five years. No less marked is the 
growth in numbers of women students in graduate depart- 
ments from 1555 in 1898 to 5909 in 1918, a gain of 280 per 
cent. In this latter year there were 69.5 per cent as many 
women taking graduate work as there were men. 
Professional Education 
Significant, also, is the steady growth in numbers of women 
in the professional departments of universities, colleges,
-P-A-G-E-364
348 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and technological schools. In 1898 there were but 983 
women enrolled in these departments, whereas twenty years 
later there were 2830 — a gain of more than 187 per cent — 
and this in the face of no little discouragement. However, 
it must be admitted that women are not flocking in large num- 
bers into the historic professions of law, medicine, and 
theology nor into the schools that prepare for those profes- 
sions. In 1919-20 (the latest year for which statistics are 
yet available) there were but 888 women taking medical 
courses, 1171 taking law courses, and 874 taking courses 
in theology. It is certainly surprising that law should 
attract more women than medicine, which has long been 
supposed to be a profession making strong appeal to 
the nurturing instincts of women. No doubt the small 
number of women preparing for this work may be partially 
explained by the great physical demands made upon both 
the student and the practitioner in medicine, the extended 
period required to establish one’s self in the profession, the 
restricted facilities open to women in hospitals and clinics, 
and the popular distrust of, if not prejudice against, women 
physicians on the ground of incomplete practical training. 
Nevertheless the World War gave a very real impetus to 
the tendency on the part of medical colleges to open their 
courses to women. At the present time they are admitted to 
sixty of the ninety medical colleges in this country. Between 
1914 and 1918 several of the largest medical schools in the 
United States took action to admit women. The list fol- 
lows: 
Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1914 
Tulane University in 1915 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in 
1916 
Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1917 
Medical School of the University of Maryland in 1917 
Medical College of Virginia in 1917 
Harvard University Medical School in 1918

  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 349 
The enormous stream of young women entering the normal 
schools and the number in the teaching profession have 
shown signs of lessening during the last five years. The 
small salaries paid to women teachers the country over, as 
well as the attractive new vocations opened to them during 
the World War, are largely responsible for this situation. 
Yet there were 116,887 women enrolled in the normal schools 
of the country in 1918 as compared with 68,698 in 1899 — 
a gain of more than 70 per cent. One of the crucial problems 
in American education to-day is the professional training 
of thousands of young women, between the ages of sixteen 
and twenty-five, who are teaching in the rural schools of 
our country, not only with no professional preparation for 
their great task, but with a totally inadequate general edu- 
cation. This situation is almost wholly responsible for the 
high percentage of illiteracy revealed during the World War 
by native-born army recruits from the rural sections of the 
country. A realization on the part of the more enlightened 
public of the menacing nature of such conditions, threaten- 
ing as they do any wholesome development of democratic 
institutions and ideals, has led to the organization of a power- 
ful movement for the improvement of rural education. One 
of the foremost objectives of this movement is the profes- 
sional preparation of teachers — mostly young women — 
for work in country schools. 
Little progress has been made in the last quarter-century 
with respect to the advancement of women to administra- 
tive positions or their appointment to professorships in 
university faculties. The fact that the lower ranks of the 
teaching profession are largely recruited by women is truer 
to-day than it was twenty-five years ago. Most of the boys 
and girls in elementary schools are taught by women, and 
more than 66 per cent of the instructors in secondary schools 
are women. Apparently this situation awakens surprise 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
350 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and consternation in the minds of foreign educators, on the 
ground that such a practice tends unduly to feminize edu- 
cation. Amusing, as well as revealing, is the fulmination 
of Professor Armstrong of the Mosely Commission, which 
visited the United States from England in 1904: 
To put the matter in very simple terms, it seemed to me . . . that 
the boy in America is not being brought up to punch another boy’s head, 
or to stand having his own punched in a healthy and proper manner; 
that there is a strange and indefinable air of femininity coming over the 
men; a tendency toward a common, if I may so call it, sexless tone of 
thought. 
This cursory glance at the progress made in the profes- 
sional training of women would be manifestly incomplete 
without brief reference to the splendid strides made in the 
field of the education of nurses during the last quarter-cen- 
tury. This profession for women has been thrice blessed 
by coming under the able leadership of certain remarkably 
gifted women, among whom Professor M. Adelaide Nutting 
of Teachers College, Columbia University, is an outstand- 
ing figure. Guided by leaders of unusually broad and far- 
seeing vision, the vocation of the trained nurse has been 
lifted into a noble profession, requiring years of intelligent 
preparation both in theory and practice. In increasing 
extent is this profession appealing to women with college 
degrees or at least with a few years of college education. 
Space is lacking to write of the truly impressive advances 
made in the training of nurses, but certain of these cannot 
be passed over. First should be mentioned the recogni- 
tion on the part of universities of the growing prestige of 
nursing as a profession having a considerable body of theo- 
retical and scientific knowledge. This is evidenced by the 
organization of departments of nursing in connection with 
sixteen leading universities in America. In addition there 
are fourteen universities and colleges having some affiliation 
with schools of nursing and twelve offering courses for gradu-
-P-A-G-E-367
THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 351 
ate nurses, chiefly in public health nursing. Another ad- 
vance may be seen in the differentiation of courses and of 
types of work in the field of nursing. About 70 per cent 
of graduate nurses are engaged in private practice, a condi- 
tion somewhat analogous to that in the profession of medi- 
cine. Approximately 18 per cent are occupied in hospitals 
as instructors, supervisors, directors of schools of nursing 
and of hospital nursing service. Twelve per cent of the 
nursing profession are working in the significant new field of 
public health nursing, as visiting nurses, as nurse assistants 
in medical supervision in the public schools, as community 
nurses in rural districts, and as nurses in industrial establish- 
ments. The Department of Public Health of New York 
City employs about seven hundred nurses to assist in the 
protection of health. 
The growth in schools and in numbers of the nursing pro- 
fession is imposing. The number of schools of nursing 
accredited by state boards of examiners in 1922 was 1577. 
The total number of women students in schools of nursing 
in 1920 was 54,953 and the number graduated that year 
was 14,980. According to the census of 1920 there are 
149,128 trained registered nurses in the United States — 
an increase of 87 per cent in ten years. 
Educational Movements of the Last Quarter-Century 
During the last twenty-five years one educational move- 
ment after another has been organized, looking to the im- 
provement of different phases of education, and most of 
these have directly influenced the education of girls and 
women. Prominent among them should be mentioned 
the home economics movement, the movements for voca- 
tional education and vocational guidance, the Girl Scout 
movement, the movement for improved civic education, 
the movement to elevate social work into a profession, the
-P-A-G-E-368
  352 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
physical educational movement, and the movement for 
more enlightened sex education. 
The Home Economics Movement 
No doubt the growing popularity of household, arts edu- 
cation for girls, during the last decade of the nineteenth 
century, was in large measure due to the fact that compara- 
tively few young women received training in domestic affairs 
from their mothers, as had once been universally the case. 
Ignorance of both the theory and practice of home manage- 
ment was becoming general among girls who entered gainful 
employments at an early age or who passed from high school 
to college. Add to this the fact that an impressive body 
of scientific knowledge concerning food values, textiles, 
household sanitation, child hygiene, and allied subjects was 
rapidly being added to the practical training in domestic 
arts, and it can readily be understood that this .phase of 
education was bound to make for itself an important place 
in schools educating women. In the opening years of the 
twentieth century, courses in household economy had been 
organized in the colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts 
the country over. About the same time the movement 
spread to the industrial schools and normal schools. It is 
not surprising, then, to learn that in 1909-10 cooking and 
sewing were taught to girls in 95 elementary school systems, 
207 high schools, and 142 higher institutions, including 
state universities. 
A powerful impetus was given to this movement by the 
passage of the Smith-Lever Act in 1914 and the Smith- 
Hughes Act in February, 1917 — legislation which revealed 
the nation-wide interest in the more extensive education 
of girls in household economy. The first act provided large 
federal grants to the states for diffusing practical informa- 
tion relating to agriculture and home economics among
-P-A-G-E-369
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 353 
the people of the rural sections. This work has been under- 
taken and organized by the land grant colleges and has re- 
sulted, so far as the feminine portion of the population is 
concerned, in a notable increase in the number of girls’ garden 
clubs and canning clubs and in much useful instruction in 
the household arts given by county agents to women in 
farming districts. The Smith-Hughes Act went a step 
farther and provided for the better preparation of teachers 
of agricultural, trade, industrial, and home economics sub- 
jects. This work was placed under the control of a Federal 
Board of Vocational Education, and liberal annual appro- 
priations were provided by the act to such states as com- 
plied with its conditions. 
In 1918 the Report of the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation contained the statement that the rate of extension 
of home economics courses in public high schools had been 
about one thousand per year. The tendency has been to make 
this work elective to high school girls while it is required 
in the upper grades of the elementary schools. More than 
one hundred thousand girls were enrolled in the home eco- 
nomics departments of our high schools in the year 1918, 
constituting 10.19 per cent of the total enrollment of girls 
in high schools. Although this percentage is small, it must 
be remembered that many girls in other high school depart- 
ments elect courses in home economics, thus increasing 
the number who benefit by this instruction by scores of 
thousands. Moreover, the rapid growth of home economics 
in rural school programs has led many normal schools to 
require a minimum course in the subject of all students. 
For several years past there has been a marked tendency 
to establish practice homes, in detached houses or in apart- 
ments, where girls, in high school or college, may obtain 
admirable practical training in household economy. Some 
of these practice homes have even been able to secure the
-P-A-G-E-370
  354 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
loan of a baby to be cared for by the resident students as 
part of their course in child hygiene. The quickened interest 
in child welfare that is spreading throughout the country 
is manifested in the establishment of child welfare courses 
in most departments of home economics in colleges and 
universities. 
Movements for Vocational Education and Vocational 
Guidance 
—One-of the most. significant of all the movements for the 
betterment of women’s education, by making that education 
more responsive to their needs, is the vocational education 
movement. Apart from the organization of the Women’s 
Educational and Industrial Union in Boston in 1877, little 
was done to train women for wage earning in the nineteenth 
century. It was in the early years of the twentieth century 
that this new movement had its rise, and the interest in its 
aims and accomplishments, as well as in the problems grow- 
ing out of its attempts to furnish well-considered vocational 
training to girls, has been steadily on the increase. The 
first attempts to grapple with the question led to the es- 
tablishment of trade schools for girls in the large industrial 
’ cities of the East. A pioneer in this field was the Manhattan 
Trade School for Girls opened in New York in 1902. A few 
years later similar schools were organized in Boston, Worces- 
ter, Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and 
other cities. Despite this favorable beginning, however, 
the whole movement for vocational education of youth was 
for several years more concerned with the training of boys 
than of girls. This is shown by the fact that in 1910 of 
the 193 trade schools listed in the Report of the Commissioner 
of Education a very small proportion were established espe- 
cially to train girls. 
In 1907 a promising forward step was taken in the organi-
-P-A-G-E-371
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 355 
zation of the National Society for the Promotion of Indus- 
trial Education, which, early in its history, showed an active 
concern in the extension of vocational education among 
girls. At the convention of the Society held at Grand 
Rapidsin October, 1913, it was decided that stronger emphasis 
should be placed upon the vocational training of women. 
At this convention an assistant secretary, newly appointed 
“to make a special study of vocational training for women 
who are wishing to prepare for self-support and women 
who are already self-supporting,’ made her first public 
appearance. 
Reference has already been made to the Smith-Hughes 
Act of 1917 creating a Federal Board for Vocational Educa- 
tion to codperate with the states in promoting vocational 
training in trades and industries as well as in agriculture and 
home economics. By January 1, 1918, the conditions of 
the Smith-Hughes Act had been accepted by each of the 
forty-eight states of the Union, and plans for state organi- 
zation of vocational education had been submitted and 
approved. At the present time federally aided courses 
in vocational education have been organized in all the states, 
and provision has been made for the training of teachers 
of vocational subjects. In 1922 the Federal Board for Vo- 
cational Education reported the establishment of 1001 
trade or industrial schools, including evening, part-time, 
and all-day schools. In these schools were enrolled 216,541 
women students —a gain of more than 260 per cent — 
since 1918. If this rate of increase continues, the terse com- 
ment of an American financier that Germany before the war 
educated her youth for a skilled vocation while the United 
States educated hers for a job will be pointless before many 
years. 
Closely related to the vocational education movement 
is that for the more intelligent guidance of youth in the
-P-A-G-E-372
3856 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
choice of vocations. The huge labor turnover among ig- 
nor: irls, as well a ifting of girls into the 
so-called ‘‘blind alley trades,”’ clearly testify to the existing 
need for such guidance. The vocational guidance move- 
ment, inaugurated by Mr. Frank Parsons in the Boston 
Civic Service House in 1901, has spread to well-nigh every 
state in the Union and has led to the establishment of a 
vocational guidance department in connection with many 
of the public school systems of our larger cities. It is an 
encouraging index of the thoroughgoing methods of the 
leaders of this movement that surveys have recently been 
made of the vocational opportunities and conditions exist- 
ing in industrial cities, with a view to discovering the es- 
sential facts regarding the physical and hygienic conditions 
of girl workers, the influence of the occupation upon their 
character and growth, the opportunities for beginners, and, 
above all, the relation of the occupation to vocational edu- 
cation within the school. 
Education for Citizenship 
Another strong trend in the direction of relating educa- 
tion more intimately to daily living is seen in the movement 
for better civic education in the schools. Although educa- 
tion for citizenship is no new demand in America, yet there 
has been profound dissatisfaction in recent years with the 
results achieved by the schools. This dissatisfaction re- 
ceived clear expression in the preliminary report of the 
Commission on Reorganization of Secondary Education, 
appointed by the National Education Association in 1911. 
The Commission declared that facts, theories, and activities 
that do not rather directly contribute to the student’s ap- 
preciation of methods of human betterment have no claim 
to a place in a course in citizenship: ‘‘Under this test the old 
civics, almost exclusively a study of government machinery,
-P-A-G-E-373
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 857 
must give way to the new civics, a study of all manner of 
social efforts to improve mankind.” From the beginning 
of the movement it has fortunately been taken for granted 
that girls are as much in need of this instruction as boys; 
and the extension of suffrage to women has but made this 
need more apparent. 
There appears to be fairly general agreement among edu- 
cators that any plan for educating girls and boys in the 
duties of citizenship shall include some form of direct experi- 
ence with governmental activities, either by way of organi- 
zation of a school republic or by contact with a variety of 
social organizations by means of which the community is 
maintained. Moreover, it is coming to be more clearly 
understood that the teaching of good citizenship ‘‘presup- 
poses teachers who are themselves notable examples of good 
citizenship.” Who can maintain that the army of women 
teachers in our schools, newly enfranchised as they are and 
hardly yet awake to the larger life beyond the walls of their 
sheltered homes, are in any adequate degree prepared to 
undertake this splendid task? It is idle to expect nation- 
wide results from this movement for better civic education 
until the country as a whole is educated to the point where 
it regards teaching as a responsible profession to which no 
person will be admitted without broad and thorough prep- 
aration. 
The Movement for Education of Social Workers 
In the closing years of the nineteenth century the multi- 
plication of social agencies to serve the destitute, the un- 
employed, the sick, the aged, and the mentally and physi- 
cally defective led to a pressing demand for persons suitably 
equipped to carry on this work. At the same time the num- 
ber of permanent salaried positions open to properly quali- 
fied men and women greatly increased. Little by little  
-P-A-G-E-374
  358 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
social work came to be regarded as a profession for which 
a thorough preparation was necessary. In the National 
Congress of Charities, held in 1893 and again in 1897, ex- 
perienced social workers urged that training schools for social 
work be organized to meet a growing need. The first ven- 
ture in this new field was made in the summer of 1898 when 
the New York Charity Organization Society instituted a 
training class which became, in 1901, the Summer School 
for Philanthropic Workers and, in 1904, the New York 
School of Philanthropy. Since this school was established 
four other cities have taken similar action. The Boston 
School for Social Workers was organized in 1904, the St. 
Louis School of Social Economy in 1906, the Chicago School 
of Civics and Philanthropy in 1907 (an outgrowth of an 
earlier venture called the Chicago Institute of Social Science), 
and the Pennsylvania School for Social Service in 1910 in 
Philadelphia. During the academic year 1913-14 approxi- 
mately 900 students were enrolled in these schools and 167 
received certificates of graduation. Much stress is rightly 
placed by the leaders in social education upon field-work. 
The student is placed with some governmental agency or 
with the recreation department of the settlements or is as- 
signed investigational work in methods of social inquiry. 
From the inception of this movement it has been recruited 
in large measure by young women. Its attraction seems to 
have been especially strong to those of fine intellectual equip- 
ment. No doubt the opportunity to care for the needy, the 
defective, the unfortunate has proved attractive to many 
women to whom teaching made little appeal. In the aca- 
demic year 1922-23, 191 students took courses at the New 
York School of Social Work, of whom only 18 were men. It 
is hardly too much to say that this promising new domain 
of work bids fair to be overwhelmingly a profession for 
women. 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 359 
The Physical Education Movement 
Although the recent awakening of popular interest in 
sounder physical training and hygienic instruction of young 
people is not primarily concerned with women, yet it is al- 
together possible that the contemporary movement for an 
improved and greatly extended course of physical education 
may benefit girls even more than boys. The reason for this 
statement lies in the fact that the vigorous bodily develop- 
ment of women has been even more neglected in the past 
than that of men. In a Report on Pitisburgh Vacation 
Schools written in 1906, the president of one of the city va- 
cation school systems declared that the systematic neglect 
of the physical education of girls was our ‘‘first sin of omis- 
sion.” He deplored the fact that girls were given “the 
sweet, sentimental books they like to read’’ and were per- 
mitted to spend their leisure hours in sewing or gossiping. 
Everywhere he saw an attempt to develop girls according 
to a passive, conventional, formal ideal instead of educat- 
ing them to ‘‘a healthy freedom and alertness of mind and 
body.” 
Although the period from 1880 to 1897 has been charac- 
terized by one somewhat overenthusiastic writer as “a 
time of active growth and diversified expansion”’ in physical 
education, it is perhaps more true to the facts to say that this 
phase of education has, with some notable exceptions, been 
grossly neglected in the United States up to the time of the 
World War. The revelations of physical unfitness in a 
high proportion of the drafted army recruits startled the 
American public unpleasantly but efficaciously. During 
the last five years progress in the direction of affording girls 
and boys in the public schools better hygienic instruction, 
more effective physical training, and more thorough health 
supervision has proceeded apace: Between 1915 and 1918
-P-A-G-E-376
  360 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
eight states of the Union enacted laws providing for state- 
wide physical education. Most of this legislation reveals 
an encouraging tendency to interpret physical education 
in a broad and comprehensive way. The New York pro- 
gram provides for medical inspection, instruction in the 
important facts of hygiene, and ‘‘physical exercise as a 
health habit, including gymnastics, elementary marching, 
organized supervised play, recreation, and athletics.” The 
programs of the other states are no less comprehensive. It 
is noteworthy that all of these state laws, with the sole ex- 
ception of that of Nevada, provide for compulsory physical 
education throughout all the public schools. If the wide- 
spread public concern with regard to this aspect of educa- 
tion be not permitted to die down, soundly planned systems 
of physical education will have been established in every 
state of the Union before many years have passed. It is 
to be hoped that these programs will take into consideration 
the special needs of women and make a carefully adapted 
course in physical training and preventive hygiene compul- 
sory upon every girl. Should this ideal be realized, the 
nation will see, before the close of a generation, the complete 
disappearance of the weak, anemic, listless woman, so fre- 
quently commented upon by foreign visitors not many years 
ago. 
Progress in Sex Education 
The question of how best to educate young people to a 
better understanding of the facts and problems of sex has 
engaged the attention of educators for more than a decade. 
Yet it required the rude shock of war to lift ‘‘the veil of 
false modesty from the question of social hygiene and sex 
education.” Before the World War thrust certain ugly 
facts and conditions upon the attention of parents, public 
opinion in America was not ready to sanction any thorough-
-P-A-G-E-377
THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 361 
going program of sex education in the public schools, and 
hardly in the colleges. Especially was this true in the case 
of girls, about whom still hung a mid-Victorian tradition 
that they must be reared in complete innocence, which, of 
course, meant ignorance. Of late years, however, some of 
this prejudice on the part of parents and the public in general 
has broken down. In 1918 Congress created the Interde- 
partmental Social Hygiene Board, charged, among other 
duties, with the disbursing of $300,000 annually for the years 
1919-20 to such universities, colleges, or other higher in- 
stitutions of learning as, in the judgment of the Board, were 
qualified for scientific research designed to develop more 
effective educational measures in the prevention of venereal 
diseases. Appropriations have been made to thirty colleges, 
universities, and normal schools in order to assist these 
institutions in developing departments of hygiene which 
shall include instruction ‘‘emphasizing with appropriate 
and due proportion and with proper tact and persistency 
the serious importance of venereal diseases, their causes, 
carriers, and prevention. ...’’!_ The schools are urged 
at the same time to stress the other important facts and 
applications of general hygiene, individual hygiene, group 
hygiene, and intergroup hygiene. 
Even more important and far-reaching has been the move- 
ment to introduce courses in sex education in high schools. 
In the year 1919 the Bureau of Education and the division 
of venereal diseases of the Public Health Service codperated 
in an effort to contribute to the solution of this difficult 
problem. These organizations have held conferences in 
eleven eastern states and have prepared a series of four mon- 
ographs on various aspects of the problem of sex education, 
which have been sent to more than five thousand educators 
requesting them. Very wisely the leaders in this movement 
1 Quoted in Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education, 1920, p. 65. 
   
-P-A-G-E-378
362 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
have committed themselves to the principles that (1) the 
object of sex instruction is development of positive ideals of 
physical vigor and social uprightness; (2) sex instruction 
should be placed in a normal setting as part of the regular 
curriculum ; (3) programs must be based largely upon suc- 
cessful experiences of individual teachers. 
If this encouraging beginning leads to intelligently planned 
programs of sex education in the public schools, carried out 
by teachers eminently qualified for this important work, it 
will be impossible to measure the social benefit that will 
result from this effort. Girls, no less than boys, are in cry- 
ing need of enlightenment and individual help in regulating 
sanely their own sex natures and in adjusting themselves 
to social situations involving the other sex. Surely the 
successful regulation of this most difficult of human relation- 
ships should not be left to chance and to the sordid gossip 
of the street and the playground. Nevertheless popular 
opinion seems loath to relinquish one of the last of the ancient 
tabus, and the education of parents and the public in general 
must proceed much further before marked advance can be 
made in the direction of sex education in the public schools. 
Conditions are somewhat better in the higher institutions 
of learning. A recent questionnaire sent to one hundred 
colleges and universities educating women made inquiry 
concerning how much, if any, instruction in sex hygiene and 
sex problems was offered. Of the sixty institutions replying, 
forty are furnishing such instruction to women through 
lectures on sex hygiene. 
The Girl Scout Movement 
This brief survey of progressive tendencies affecting the 
education of women cannot close without mention of the 
promising movement to organize the young girls of the coun- 
try under the banner of the Girl Scouts. Avowedly modeled
-P-A-G-E-379
  THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 363 
after the Girl Guides of England, the Girl Scouts were first 
organized in the United States in 1912, under the magnetic 
leadership of Mrs. Juliette Low. The earliest troops were 
formed in Georgia but the movement has rapidly spread 
from state to state and in recent years from coast to coast. 
In 1919, seven years after its first small beginnings, 41,225 
girls between the ages of ten and eighteen were enrolled as 
Girl Scouts, while many thousands more were still in the 
“tenderfoot”’ stage, not having passed the tests for admission 
to scout troops. Leaders of the movement point out that 
neither home nor school are so planned as to give the grow- 
ing girl “a place of her very own, where she can be her- 
self, and where she can do the things she wants to do.” 
This gap in the life of the girl the new organization seeks to 
fill. 
The fundamental purpose of the Girl Scouts is declared 
to be “‘to promote the virtues of womanhood by training 
girls to recognize their obligations to God and country, to 
prepare for duties devolving upon women in the home, in 
society and the state, and to guide them in ways conducive 
to personal honor and the public good.” Since this organi- 
zation is planned to give the girl wholesome, out-of-door 
occupations and sports in her unemployed hours, it is help- 
ing to solve the puzzling question of how to educate girls 
and boys to a worthier use of leisure. It has been said that 
the “girl problem,”’ no less than the “‘boy problem,” is essen- 
tially a leisure-time problem. The Girl Scout organization 
shows girls how ‘“‘a good time” can be enjoyed even with- 
out movies and boys. Then, too, its activities and ideals 
win the girl’s heart and draw her by natural methods to a 
more sensitive appreciation of social interrelationships 
and a deeper realization of her responsibility for the public 
good. Educators cannot but respect the purposes and 
achievements of this powerful movement.

Twentieth-Century Problems 
When due credit has been given to those forward-looking 
educational movements of the last twenty-five years, it may 
not be out of place to summarize very sketchily a few of 
the problems that loom up on the present-day educational 
horizon, Upon examination many of these will be found to 
center about the crucial question of how to te women 
for congenial work and financial independence while fitting 
them to be home makers in the larger sense of that word. 
For the last twenty years social writers have repeatedly 
pointed out that the higher education of women and their 
professional training and success are disinclining them for 
marriage and the cares of housekeeping and child rearing. 
Gloomy statistics of the low marriage and birth rates among 
college-bred women are hurled at those who have faith and 
hope in women’s full and free development. Needless to 
say, little attempt has been made to discover whether these 
rates are appreciably higher among the sisters and cousins 
of the same social class as these college women. In other 
words, no satisfactory study has been made to determine 
whether low marriage and birth rates are not equally char- 
acteristic of the prosperous middle classes from which college 
students are drawn. Alarmed at the showing of statistics, 
some educators are urging that college and high school cur- 
ricula be profoundly modified to include compulsory courses 
in cooking, sewing, household management and sanitation, 
child care, and the like. Moved to revolt by this attack 
upon their strongholds, the heads of liberal arts colleges 
for women are bitterly opposing such plans as subversive 
of the broad, general culture for which women have so long 
been striving. 
At the same time another powerful group of educators, 
including such leaders of thought as Professor John Dewey
-P-A-G-E-381
THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 365 
and Dr. Charles Eliot, are insistently demanding that the 
higher education of women be brought in touch with the 
vocational needs of the community — that preparation 
for a life career and genuine culture are by no means alien 
to each other. Loud and long has been the controversy 
over this question and the end is not in sight. With re- 
spect to those girls who must enter wage-earning occupa- 
tions at an early age, the problem of vocational education 
assumes a different aspect. Is it of much use to train scores 
of thousands of girls for skilled vocations when factories and 
other establishments are busily engaged in reducing the work 
of laborers to a few routine operations that can readily be 
mastered in a few hours? This is obviously one of the most 
difficult of all the questions that confront the believer in 
vocational education of girls. Needless to say it is bound 
up with the larger and more intricate question of the mechan- 
ization of industrial life, with its unfavorable reaction upon 
the worker. A lesser problem, although a real one, has to 
do with the matter of educating girls of the laboring class 
for the dual occupations of paid worker and home maker. 
If educators accept the doctrine that women must be trained 
for two spheres, then a considerable part of the program 
of the girl in a vocational school must be given up to courses 
in household economy. ‘This will manifestly result in les- 
sening her efficiency in her chosen vocation and thus will 
eventually handicap her in competition with men upon 
whom no such dual requirement is laid. 
One of the most serious problems that confronts the twen- 
tieth century in the education of its womanhood is concerned 
with the development in women of a more informed interest 
in community, national, and world affairs, together with 
a deeper sense of civic responsibility. Self-centered indi- 
vidualism is not solely a feminine defect but it is still more 
characteristic of women than of men, owing to the more  
-P-A-G-E-382
    
366 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
restricted nature of their social and political experience. 
Until the schools have more clearly and resolutely envisaged 
this problem, little will be accomplished toward its solution. 
When the social sciences and their practical applications 
are accorded a central position in the curriculum of school 
and college a long stride will have been made toward the 
development of the responsible woman citizen. 
Finally, the question of educating girls and women to a 
truer appreciation of the real values of life yields in impor- 
tance to no other problem. If women are to make a peculiar 
contribution to society, they must be alive to the incomplete- 
ness, the pathos, the possibilities of human life. They must 
be led to a sensitive appreciation of beauty, of truth, of the 
essentials of human progress. On the other hand, they 
must be helped to perceive the ugliness, the gross material- 
ism, the inhumaneness of our twentieth-century civilization 
in many of its economic aspects. An education which opens 
women’s eyes to social life as it is and as it might be will 
stir, it is to be hoped, the nurturing instincts of women and 
their deep-rooted feeling for the value and importance of 
every human life. These emotions, duly enlightened and 
regulated by understanding, may accomplish much to make 
this chaotic world a better place to live in.

CHAPTER XIV 
EpucaTIon IN THE SOUTH 
Introduction 
The story of public education during the last quarter- 
century in those states which had formed the Confederacy 
is a unique and somewhat remarkable record. But an ade- 
quate understanding of it or of the present educational 
status and problems of the South requires a view not only of 
the actual educational situation twenty-five years ago but 
also of the social, economic, and political conditions which 
had prevailed there for two or three decades following the 
Civil War. A summary of that situation and an account 
of those conditions become therefore an important part of 
the story here to be related. 
The Continuing Effects of the Civil War — Educational 
The chief need of the South twenty-five years ago was a 
full and working agreement on education. The principle 
of universal education at public expense had not yet passed 
into conviction there. It was still in the academic stage, 
the topic of the educator and theorist. It had not yet be- 
come the interest of the citizen. Compared with the United 
States as a whole, the Southern states were very backward 
in education. Public schools were deplorably poor and in- 
effective. The average annual per capita expenditure for 
public education in 1897 was $2.62 in the country at large, 
but in the South it was less than ninety cents and in some 
Southern states it was less than fifty cents. The amount 
raised per taxpayer was twice as large and the amount 
371 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
    
372 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
raised for each child of school age was three times as great 
in the country at large as in the Southern states. The 
amount of taxable wealth back of each child of school age in 
the South was only one fifth or one sixth as great as that in 
the North and the West, where the proportion of adult males 
to the school population was also fifty to one hundred per 
cent greater than in the Southern states; and the number 
of children of school age to every hundred persons of the 
total population was greater in the South than in any part 
of the United States. The average monthly salary of teachers 
in the United States was nearly fifty per cent larger than in 
the South, where it was less than twenty-eight dollars. In 
Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi the average was only 
twenty-four dollars and in North Carolina it was only 
twenty-one dollars. Between 1860 and 1900 the average an- 
nual salary of teachers in the South had actually decreased. 
In some parts of the South teachers received no more for 
their services than was received for the hire of those who 
worked under conditions of penal servitude. 
Courses of study had somewhat expanded, but poorly 
equipped teachers and the lack of supervision rendered such 
courses ineffective and chaotic. The schools were imper- 
fectly graded and methods of teaching were wasteful and 
deadening. School equipment was likewise poor. The 
grounds were often one half acre or less in size and the 
average value of rural schoolhouses as late as 1900 was only 
one hundred dollars. The average value of school property 
per child of school age was only one fifth that of the United 
States. One fifth of all the schoolhouses in North Carolina 
and Virginia were log, a condition fairly typical of all the 
South. In Tennessee as late as 1907 one seventh of the 
schoolhouses were log. In Virginia in that year only 168 
of more than 7000 schoolhouses had modern provisions for 
ventilation. The school term in the South in 1897 was only
-P-A-G-E-389
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 373 
93 days, while the term for the entire country was 141 days. 
In North Carolina it was only 60 days. In some places 
teachers were employed for half the term in winter, and dif- 
ferent teachers in the summer taught the same schools the 
remainder of the term. Teachers were generally untrained, 
sometimes very indifferent, and often held in low esteem by 
the public. From one half to four fifths of them held second- 
and third-grade certificates, usually the lowest then issued. 
Eighty per cent of nearly 2800 teachers in Florida held such 
certificates in 1897, and only 317 of them were graduates of 
normal schools. 
Normal schools and other agencies for training teachers 
were few and standardless. Certification standards were 
low and often varied among the counties of the same state. 
The status of the teacher was so ridiculously low that few 
promising young people could be persuaded to enter the 
work. Less than 60 per cent of the school population was 
enrolled in school and less than 40 per cent was in average 
daily attendance. Only one pupil out of ten of those en- 
rolled reached the fifth and only one in seven the eighth 
grade. There was not a public high school of standard 
grade. Textbooks were often nondescript, and their selec- 
tion was unintelligent and haphazard and generally optional 
with local authorities. The public, under such conditions, 
could not view the schools with pride or even complacency. 
The unit of practical school administration in the South 
twenty-five years ago was the small and weak district. 
There were no creditable and substantial county school or- 
ganization and supervision. County superintendents were 
generally colorless and deficient in leadership, employed for 
part time and poorly paid for that. The positions usually 
went to briefless young lawyers, broken-down preachers, 
country editors, too often as a reward for political service. 
Each local school was left to itself without aid or counsel 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
    374 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
from county or state. Its trustees were often chiefly in- 
terested in keeping the school near their homes and in em- 
ploying their relatives or friends as teachers. The policy 
of multiplying schools had been ruinous. State depart- 
ments of education were less real than nominal, as a rule 
little more than clerkships or pitiful political appendages. 
State superintendents were seldom educational statesmen 
and leaders but politicians, lawyers, soldiers, or patriots. 
Rarely were they selected for professional fitness, and the 
conditions of the office generally made them clerks. 
No Southern state had any compulsory attendance legis- 
lation although thirty-two of the United States had enacted 
such laws. The subject was often favorably discussed by 
groups of school workers and resolutions favoring such 
legislation were adopted. But bills introduced into the 
legislatures usually met with the specious argument that 
the school system was not ready for such a step. Lack of 
sufficient physical equipment for schools often gave such argu- 
ment respectful hearing, but the force of the industrial revival 
then gaining in the South undoubtedly was strong. Practical 
state-wide legislation on the subject did not come for many 
years. The state superintendent in North Carolina in 1898 
recommended ‘‘a mild form of compulsory legislation to 
begin with,” but action was delayed. When compulsory 
attendance legislation was finally enacted in the South, it 
was usually optional in character and in some of the states 
required a majority vote of the electors in the county or 
district to adopt; and when adopted, the law required at- 
tendance only for a minimum term and with exemptions so 
numerous as to render it ineffective. 
Child labor laws were slowly enacted in the South, where, 
with the rise of cotton factories, boys and girls of school 
age quickly became a part of that pathetic industrial force 
known as child labor. Industrial reforms were needed as
-P-A-G-E-391
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 375 
an essential part of necessary educational progress. But a 
warfare was waged between the system of child labor on the 
one side and industry, the parent, the child, and even de- 
mocracy on the other; those who worked for such re- 
forms conceived them and education as two important 
phases of the movement for a more nearly democratic order. 
In 1900 nearly thirty per cent of all the operatives in the 
cotton mills of Alabama were under sixteen, and in the en- 
tire South one fourth of them were under that age. Eight- 
een per cent of the textile operatives in North Carolina 
and probably 30,000 in the entire South were under four- 
teen years of age. The number of children under twelve in 
factories was probably 20,000. As late as 1900, fully sixty 
per cent of the operatives in the spinning departments of 
cotton factories in the Piedmont region were less than six- 
teen years of age. 
These facts reflect not only an unwholesome educational 
situation in the South twenty-five years ago, but a stubborn 
and unyielding obstacle to the later development of edu- 
cation there. The chief burden of the painful industrial 
readjustment of a population then moving from the condi- 
tions of agriculture to those of manufacture were too often 
laid on the child, by argument that legislation restricting the 
labor of the child was paternalistic and invasive of parental 
function. Under these conditions, then, why should the 
South provide money to build schools for the children while 
the influence of growing industry continued to shut so many 
of them up in factories? Moreover, thousands of humble 
families, accustomed to agricultural failures and a vicious 
crop lien despotism, seemed to see in the new factory in- 
stant escape from rural isolation, barrenness, and poverty. 
What they failed to see, however, was that redemption 
from these evils by this means would often drive them to 
others they knew not of, to pitiless helplessness of fixed
-P-A-G-E-392
  
3876 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
dependency. Urbanized industrial tenancy was to become 
and to remain almost as troublesome to the development of 
schools as farm tenancy has been. Few, even of more ex- 
ceptional virility, without the aid of adequate child labor 
and compulsory attendance legislation, could hope to rise 
out of the enfolding powers of such a system which has con- 
sciously served to hold its humble and timid agricultural 
and industrial forces in a state of arrested development. 
Illiteracy was widespread not only among the negroes 
but among the native whites in the South. Of the native 
white population ten years of age and over more than twelve 
per cent were unable to read and write, while in some of the 
Southern states, especially North Carolina, Louisiana, and 
Alabama, the percentage was approximately sixteen per cent 
— one native white person in every six above the age of ten 
being unable to read and write. The average rate of il- 
literacy among the native white population for all the other 
states of the Union was less than three per cent. The 
menace of illiteracy among the native white population in 
the South had decreased from 22.7 per cent in 1880 to 12.2 
per cent in 1900. But the extent of illiteracy continued a 
disgrace. Notes of denial and resentment were often heard, 
but they became less and less occasional as the knowledge 
of the real significance of illiteracy increased. But the 
menace could not be removed until frankly faced by the 
people of the South, until indifference to it rather than il- 
literacy itself came to be recognized as the greater reproach 
to that region. 
Education in the South had failed to develop and advance 
as its friends had hoped during the quarter-century follow- 
ing the close of reconstruction. Except in the towns and 
cities which were stimulated to action by aid from the 
Peabody Fund, public schools were in bad plight, and even 
there progress was slow. Public education had not yet
-P-A-G-E-393
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 377 
been accepted in the South. It was still’ poverty stricken, 
bore the odium of bad rule and partisan politics, and was 
otherwise in disrepute. In consequence, indifference to 
it was so deadly as to equal outright hostility. 
Economic Effects 
One of the most immediate causes of these conditions 
was economic desolation. The Southern states had come 
out of war with a loss of the greater part of their white adult 
males and an almost complete loss of their accumulated 
capital. Factories, public buildings, railroads, houses, 
barns, farm implements, and seeds had been destroyed. 
Banks had been ruined. The entire labor system had been 
demolished, and the negroes, unable quickly to adjust them- 
selves to their new economic status, had preferred restless 
roving to helping to rebuild the waste places of the South. 
Public finances were in a perilous condition, with state 
treasuries depleted and credit abroad lost. Reconstruction 
had followed and robbed the South of what war had spared. 
Federal officers were often dishonest, cases of fraud and ex- 
travagance were numerous and flagrant, corrupt and ignorant 
officials and legislatures not only looted treasuries and public 
funds but imposed enormous taxes and ran their fingers 
deep into the pockets of posterity by piling up bonded debts 
totaling more than $300,000,000. Everywhere there was 
widespread economic depression. ‘Tariff laws oppressive to 
the South but favorable to the East and pension laws which 
took many millions from the South to the North combined 
with other influences to make recovery slow. 
The wealth of the South thus lost had been considerable. 
In 1860 with nearly one third of the population of the 
United States and less than one fourth of the white popula- 
tion, the South had produced more than one half of the agri- 
cultural wealth of the entire country, and this in spite of
-P-A-G-E-394
378 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
the handicaps of the many economic disadvantages of 
slave labor. Moreover, the ante-bellum Southern states had 
greater industrial ambition and success than has generally 
been assumed. In 1860 they had an investment of more 
than $175,000,000 in nearly 25,000 factories of one kind and 
another. Between 1850 and 1860 they had increased their 
railroad mileage from 2335 to 10,718, a quadruple gain, 
exceeding by 400 miles the combined railroad mileage of the 
New England and Middle States, where a gain of only 91 
per cent had appeared in that industry during that decade. 
This development of railroads in the South represented an 
investment of more than $220,000,000, which had come 
principally from southern sources. 
In 1860 the South had nearly five and a half billions of 
the slightly more than twelve billions of the total assessed 
property valuation of the entire country. The wealth of 
the South (including the wealth represented in the slaves) 
had exceeded by $750,000,000 that of New England and the 
Middle States. But ten years later the wealth of the latter 
group of states exceeded that of the South by nearly eleven 
billion. The taxable wealth of the entire South in that 
year was less than that of New York and Pennsylvania. 
In 1860 South Carolina had ranked third in wealth in the 
United States but thirtieth in 1870. Georgia had gone from 
seventh to thirty-ninth place during that decade, Mississippi 
from fourth to thirty-fourth, and Alabama from eleventh to 
forty-fourth. Meantime, values were greatly increasing in 
other sections of the country. As illustration, South Caro- 
lina in 1860 had an assessed property valuation greater by 
$68,000,000 than the total valuation of Rhode Island and 
New Jersey, but in 1870 those two states had wealth valued 
at $685,000,000 more than that of South Carolina. These 
figures reveal the economic losses in the Southern states. 
The outcome of four years of war and a decade of recon-
-P-A-G-E-395
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 379 
struction was complete economic collapse, a catastrophe 
from which the South has been able only in recent years 
even partially to recover. 
The first problem, therefore, had been to restore the 
agricultural life of the South —a region of poor roads, poor 
schools, millions of acres of unused lands, multitudes of 
mortgages, and no money to finance economic recuperation. 
The principal resource must be cotton, the demands for 
which made it the best money crop. During most of these 
years the South knew nothing but cotton, and the force of 
agricultural tradition and custom was powerful. Diversity 
as the remedy for adversity was yet unknown. Efforts 
to resume economic life consisted in an endless chain of 
borrowing living expenses while the cotton crop was being 
made. Lack of crop diversification, lack of working capital, 
and the system of share farming, cropping, and crop liens, 
which developed as a result, formed a vicious cycle of 
economic despotism. 
Southern banks borrowed credit from remote sources, 
usually the North, on the assurance that it would be used 
only to produce cotton. The coming crop was security. 
The local merchant borrowed from the Southern banks and 
in turn gave credit to the local farmer on the same stipula- 
tion and promise to raise cotton. The crops were thus 
mortgaged, often before they were planted, and their value 
was usually spent before they were harvested. Under the 
crop lien system the raising of foodstuffs was not encouraged, 
and prices paid for provisions under this system ranged from 
75 to 100 per cent higher than the cash prices. When the 
cotton was picked, the farmer was forced to sell it, no matter 
what the price, to the merchant who had “run” or “grub 
staked” him during the year. The merchant repaid the 
Southern banks, which in turn repaid the Northern banks, 
with high interest collected at every point. When this
-P-A-G-E-396
  380 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
cycle was completed, it was necessary to start it all over 
again. Slavery did not disappear in the Southern states, 
therefore, with the emancipation of the negroes. This 
peculating scheme of crop liens kept them in economic 
bondage for many years. 
Racial Conflict 
The racial conflict was another obstacle to schools during 
the last quarter of the last century. Viewed from the pur- 
pose, the process, or the result of reconstruction, the negro 
had been the center of interest. The issue of mixed schools 
during that régime had been disastrous to education in the 
South. The negro’s ignorance later played into the hands 
of the politicians, served to lower political morals, and 
in time to produce political stagnation, and to make him 
a barrier to educational advancement generally. The 
thoughtful white leaders of the South were friendly to him 
then and have remained his best friends. They considered 
him educable for work, for improvement, and for useful 
citizenship. They knew that the right kind of education 
was the only safe remedy for his condition. And their 
expenditure of 109 millions out of all too meager school 
funds for his education between 1870 and 1900 is one of the 
creditable commentaries on the sober educational opinion 
of that section. Nevertheless, his exploitation by dema- 
gogues and designing politicians during most of that time 
made him an influence of mischief. Before progress in 
education could come this had to be removed. 
Other Obstacles to Progress 
Other obstacles to education which were inherited from the 
war and reconstruction were defective educational legisla- 
tion and unsound school organization. Conflicts between 
the constitutional provisions for schools and _ legislation 
enacted under them were often troublesome. Sources of
-P-A-G-E-397
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 381 
school support were decreased or often entirely cut off by 
constitutional restrictions. Moreover, the blight of parti- 
san politics was deadening. Few features of public school 
work escaped its ill effects. Unscrupulous men in offices 
and local political bosses had learned during reconstruction 
how to exploit the schools for partisan purposes. Schools 
came to be regarded as the spoils of political victory instead 
of opportunities for promoting public well-being, and in 
many places in the South they have not yet been fully eman- 
cipated from this influence. 
These are some of the reasons for the low condition ‘of 
public education in the South twenty-five years ago. It 
had had its rebirth in poverty and destitution. During 
its early years it had been nurtured and cherished by a few 
friends and by fewer zealous but often visionary philan- 
thropists. Often it had been the victim of a very feeble 
leadership. Occasionally it had been betrayed by petty 
politicians who were moved less often by principle than the 
desire to gain partisan advantage. Frequently it was sub- 
ordinated to pernicious and deadening sectarian dogma. 
These and other handicaps of inheritance and environment 
forced public education in the South into a life-and-death 
struggle until near 1900. Before it could overcome these 
obstacles and approach a promising maturity and position 
of increasing respectability new foundations had to be 
built. 
The incentives and basis for educational reform depended 
first on a substantial increase in economic wealth. The re- 
lapses of war and reconstruction had to be outgrown, the 
orderly processes of production and of exchange had to be 
resumed, the South had to recover her economic stability. 
This was to be gained slowly. After 1880 the dominance of 
agriculture, especially of cotton raising, began to yield place 
to manufacturing. In that year the value of manufactured

products was less by $200,000,000 than that of agricultural 
products, but by 1900 the products of manufacturing and 
of mining interests exceeded those of agriculture by nearly 
$300,000,000. And between 1880 and 1900 the products 
of Southern factories increased by more than 220 per cent. 
Capital invested in cotton mills alone increased during that 
period from $22,000,000 to $113,000,000. 
The resources and the deposits of national banks increased 
nearly 400 per cent each, and their capital was more than 
doubled during these two decades. Railroad mileage in- 
creased 112 per cent, and the true value of all property 
nearly doubled. During the decade from 1890 to 1900 the 
total taxable wealth of the South increased nearly fifty per 
cent. This vast industrial change from field to factory 
meant the presence of a great social change. Industry was 
coming more and more to be a force in Southern life. Ma- 
terial wealth was rapidly increasing and formed for the first 
time since 1860 a substantial basis for an increase in school 
revenues. 
The Reconstruction Period 
The race issue which had checked the cause of schools for 
many years was finally to serve as a powerful influence for 
educational progress. The single purpose of reconstruction 
had been to give the ballot to the negro; and the operation 
of the reconstruction acts of Congress, which formed new 
governments and created a new political people in the South, 
was incidental to this one object. Passionate political feel- 
ings had been involved at every step of the process. In 
1867 Congress had forced negro suffrage on the South when 
only six of the Northern states permitted it. This sudden 
and indiscriminate gift of the voting privilege to men en- 
tirely unprepared for its intelligent use had produced a régime 
of riot and rascality during which schools and other means 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 383 
of progress had fallen victim to the vengeance and cupidity 
of adventurers and malefactors. 
But before the last state had been restored to the Union 
the process of undoing reconstruction was under way. Con- 
flicts over the elimination of the negro from politics were 
fierce and demoralizing. Open bribery, intimidation, stuff- 
ing ballot boxes, the manipulation or falsification of election 
returns, and the use of tissue ballots had developed into 
high arts. In one election in South Carolina the number 
of votes cast was nearly twice the number of the names on 
the poll books. The imposition of the poll tax and the 
creation of ‘‘shoestring”’ election districts to include sections 
of dense negro population served to eliminate negro votes 
or to render them ineffective. By these and other devious 
ways the dangers of negro domination were somewhat 
averted during a decade or more following the close of re- 
construction. Moreover, a new political movement in some 
parts of the South threatened division among the Democrats 
and encouraged the factions in skillful attempts to control 
the negro vote which had always been purchasable and which 
was now powerful and dangerous because it was uncertain. 
The wits of the factions bidding for the negro vote were 
pitted against each other. In one election, in order to insure 
their votes, the poll taxes of the negroes were paid by one 
political faction. The other faction placarded all public 
places with the extraordinary announcement that poll tax 
receipts would be accepted for admission to the circus which 
was to give its performance on election day, and the negroes 
preferred the show to the polls. But such elimination 
methods as these were unpleasant. New and less crude 
devices wearing at least the color of legality had to be found 
for eliminating the negro from politics. Open and avowed 
suppression of the negro vote appeared safer and more 
respectable than fraud and chicanery, even though the legal
-P-A-G-E-400

devices found for contravening the purpose of the Fifteenth 
Amendment were not lacking in artful subterfuge. 
Mississippi led off in 1890 and was shortly followed by 
other states. The payment of all taxes legally demanded 
for the two preceding years was set up as one prerequisite for 
the privilege of voting. Another was the ability of the 
voter to read and properly to interpret, under the close 
scrutiny of white election officials, any section of the Con- 
stitution. These requirements eliminated large numbers 
of negro votes and greatly reduced the chance of negro 
voters to qualify. Finally, the famous “‘grandfather clause” 
practically guaranteed the supremacy of the white vote 
by giving the privilege of voting to those citizens or the 
descendants of those citizens who had the privilege prior to 
January 1, 1867, without regard to property or educational 
qualifications. The vote of the negro thus quickly dwindled 
into negligible proportions and his political equality became 
more nearly extinct in law than it had long been infact. The 
final stage of the unfortunate reconstruction controversy 
closed, therefore, in a complete reversal of the purpose and 
process which marked its beginning. Meantime, however, 
the schools had been subordinated and often sacrificed to 
less worthy interests and the education of both whites and 
blacks had fallen pitiably into neglect. Public energies 
which should have been spent for schools and for rebuilding 
Southern civilization were necessarily used to wrest the 
government and political power from the blacks and their 
allies. And in some Southern states educational conditions 
were less wholesome at the close of the century than they 
had been in 1860. 
The Beginnings of Educational Progress 
Thus the race issue which for more than two decades after 
the war had been a very large factor in retarding education
-P-A-G-E-401
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 385 
became after 1890 one of the strongest influences in pro- 
moting it. When the states set up the constitutional re- 
quirement of literacy as a qualification for the privilege of 
voting, to apply ultimately to both races, even for the avowed 
purpose of eliminating or restricting negro suffrage, they 
were automatically committed to the enlargement of public 
educational opportunity. A premium was thus placed on 
education, and attention was sharply drawn to the im- 
perative necessity for enlarged educational facilities. In 
the same constitutions which disfranchised the negro or in 
legislation enacted under such constitutions, requirements 
were soon made for improving the schools. In Mississippi 
special taxes were required to increase the school term to 
four months; in South Carolina the state tax for education 
was increased so as to provide an annual school revenue of 
as much as three dollars per child enrolled; in Louisiana 
provision was made for restoring to the school fund the 
interest on the lands squandered during reconstruction, and 
the right of local taxation equal to the state tax for schools 
was also given the people. Provision was made in Alabama 
for an increased state school tax, and local taxation for 
schools was authorized in North Carolina and Virginia. 
Restless discontent among the people of the strictly rural 
sections of the South and radical political changes which 
marked the closing decade of the last century were other 
influences which were to hasten the spirit of educational 
reform. The class consciousness of the farmers had been 
awakened and had expressed itself through several organiza- 
tions which were consolidated as the Farmers’ Alliance and 
Industrial Union in 1889. The principal cause of the move- 
ment was economic: it sought to win for the farmers condi- 
tions under which they might enjoy a just share of their 
own creations. But it was also concerned with social and 
political reform. The necessity of the education of the
-P-A-G-E-402
  386. TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
masses was insisted upon by the Alliance which, in resolu- 
tions on the subject, held that the uneducated were ‘‘always 
at the mercy of the better informed” and the members were 
urged to use their influence to secure better educational 
facilities for their children. 
This unrest of the farmer was extraordinary. He had al- 
ways been accounted so instinctively cautious and conser- 
vative that the practical politician had not looked for much 
shifting in the political allegiance of rural voters. Their isola- 
tion had made it difficult to move them suddenly by any 
impulse sufficient to break party lines and to cause a cleavage 
from traditional party connections. Dissatisfaction with 
conditions and with existing leadership, however, produced 
radical political changes and led to the formation of several 
political parties. Some of these were the Union Labor 
Party in Arkansas, the Young Men’s Democracy in Louisi- 
ana, and the People’s Party, also known as the Third Party 
and the Populist Party. The last named, the strongest of 
them all, developed organized strength throughout the 
South and in some cases broke up political associations of 
a generation and upset the calculations of the most astute 
politicians. The educational influence of this movement 
of revolt and of liberation was very evident in Alabama 
and North Carolina in the nineties, and in all the Southern 
states it soon became the fashion for all parties to pledge 
themselves to public school support. By, 1900 they were 
coloring their political platforms with strong declarations of 
devotion to the cause of public education. 
Another foundation for educational upbuilding appeared 
in a new type of leadership, developed largely through the 
union of the so-called middle and aristocratic classes. The 
former through an increase in economic wealth had become 
more thrifty and influential, and stimulated through the 
challenge of an awakening democracy they became ambitious 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 387 
for and able to secure some part in public affairs. In ante- 
bellum civilization the nonslaveholding whites had not 
had large place in the essential councils of the South; they 
had not filled many important offices nor were they allied 
with the landed and slaveholding classes who had monopo- 
lized political power —a monopoly which represented also 
the supremacy in social and administrative ability. 
But the conditions of the new order after Appomattox 
_ and reconstruction, by which both the aristocrats and the 
common people.and their property had been depleted, fused 
both classes more effectively than the South had ever known. 
The menace of negro power, common suffering, and the bear- 
ing of a common burden served to unite them; and in the 
distribution of political responsibility the South was soon 
to know no distinction of classes. It was to be democratized 
in part at least by this fusion of the white people. The 
South was, happily, to maintain those old dignities and 
reverences which power and social usage always develop ; 
but to these was to be added another deep force — a quick- 
ened sense of responsibility and of liberality toward those 
who had been unprivileged. By these means aristocracy 
was to pass and the plain people were to begin to share in 
the privileges of government. There was to be an upward 
movement among the masses, now drawn more closely to- 
gether and led to seek through ambition and industry and 
the unity of their civic heritage the means of opportunity 
for all. 
The restoration and the preservation of the best in South- 
ern life became a passion with this new leadership as it 
became conscious of opportunity and power. It viewed 
with impatience the educational weaknesses of the time and 
insisted that the truth about the schools be told. It at- 
tacked demagoguery and attempts to exploit the public 
mind with vain boasts of exaggerated achievements. It
-P-A-G-E-404
  
388 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
secured response to the needs of the people through interest 
in an extension of public school opportunities, which always 
becomes necessary and inevitable as democracy becomes a 
reality. The program of this new leadership was the 
rehabilitation of the South, and in it the desire to enlarge 
educational opportunity became a form of civic and patriotic 
piety, even acommon faith. The chance for democracy was 
thus made brighter as the unprivileged and the poor and the 
privileged and the rich joined hands to build a common 
school system for all the children. 
Thus was prepared the way for educational advance in 
the South. There had come an increase in wealth. The 
race issue in politics had been eliminated. The rural people 
had been awakened, and a new type of leadership had ap- 
peared. Many of the stubborn and mischievous difficulties, 
which for years had stood as a deadly upas to enfeeble social 
growth, were now in large part removed, and by effort no 
less heroic and courage no less indomitable than that ex- 
hibited during the war. The South now felt a new challenge, 
a new sense of duty, made more ringing and clear by the 
conditions of the new order. This sense of responsibility 
had been personified in Robert E. Lee; it was felt deeply 
and voiced loudly by leaders of later years, and hereafter 
it was to lie close to the heart of the New South. And 
fidelity to it was to bring after Appomattox victories more 
decisive for Southern well-being than any that preceded it. 
Educational Propaganda 
By the beginning of the present century conditions were ripe 
and the way prepared for marked advance. Only the or- 
ganized agencies of propaganda were now needed and these 
were to appear in large part in the work of the Conference 
for Education in the South and in the movement repre- 
sented by the Southern Education Board and the General
-P-A-G-E-405
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 389 
Education Board. The first of the organizations, also known 
as the Southern Conference Movement, the Southern Educa- 
tional Movement, and the Ogden Movement, grew out of a 
small conference held at Capon Springs, West Virginia, in 
the summer of 1898 and known as the Conference for Chris- 
tian Education in the South. Rev. T. U. Dudley, Bishop 
of Kentucky, an alumnus of the University of Virginia, late 
Chancellor of the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennes- 
see, was elected president. At the second conference, held 
the following year at the same place, the name was changed 
to the Conference for Education in the South and Dr. J. L. 
M. Curry, general agent of the Peabody and the Slater 
Boards, was elected president. The third conference also 
met at Capon Springs and Mr. Robert C. Ogden, of New 
York, one of the most sympathetic friends public education 
in the South ever had, was elected to the presidency and 
served in that position for many years. To his generous 
enterprise, resourcefulness, and administrative wisdom much 
of the success of the conference was due. For several years 
he invited numerous people in the North who were inter- 
ested in education to attend these annual meetings as his 
guests and for their accommodation provided special trains. 
In this way influential people of the North became ac- 
quainted with those of congenial spirit in the South and 
thus gained a safer knowledge of the perplexing problems 
and needs of Southern life. 
Formal resolutions of the early conferences were signifi- 
cant. They dealt with the importance of thoroughness of 
elementary instruction, longer school terms, better qualified 
teachers, and better buildings and equipment, traveling 
libraries, and industrial education. Impressive also is this 
resolution of the second conference : 
Resolved, That the education of the white race in the South is the press- 
ing and imperative need, and the noble achievements of the Southern
-P-A-G-E-406
  
390 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Commonwealths in the creation of common school systems for both races 
deserve not merely the sympathetic recognition of the country and of the 
world at large but also give the old and high-spirited colleges and uni- 
versities of the South a strong claim upon a generous share of that stream 
of private wealth in the United States that is enriching and vitalizing the 
higher education of the North and West. 
It is of importance to remember in this connection that 
private, denominational, and state higher educational in- 
stitutions in the South were then very poor. Most of them 
were forced to struggle for existence. Between 1898 and 
1903 benefactions to institutions of higher learning in the 
United States had amounted to more than $61,000,000, but 
little of this money had reached the South. All the Southern 
colleges combined had at the latter date only 15 millions 
of the $157,000,000 of productive funds held by the colleges 
of the United States. Out of eight and a half millions of 
volumes in college libraries in the United States only one and 
a quarter million were found in the South. The colleges 
of the South had only about $1,000,000 invested in scientific 
apparatus against a total valuation of $17,000,000 for the 
entire country in 1903. The physical equipment of the 
colleges of the United States at that time was worth nearly 
$150,000,000, but less than $9,000,000 of it was found in the 
South. The total annual income available for higher educa- 
tion in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
the Carolinas, and Virginia was $19,000 less than the annual 
income of Harvard. 
Succeeding meetings of the Conference for Education in 
the South were held in Winston-Salem, Athens, Richmond, 
Birmingham, Columbia, Lexington, Pinehurst, Memphis, 
and other cities in the South. At the instance of the con- 
ference, the Southern Education Board was organized in 
1901 to aid in the development and the wise direction of 
educational sentiment, and to help secure larger policies 
for education, by appealing to the resources of taxation
-P-A-G-E-407
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 391 
and local forces for self-development. The Board neither 
held nor distributed funds. Extensive and systematic 
field work was planned with Dr. J. L. M. Curry as super- 
vising director and President Edwin A. Alderman, then of 
Tulane University, President Charles D. McIver, of the 
North Carolina Normal and Industrial College, and Presi- 
dent H. B. Frissell, of Hampton Institute, as district direc- 
tors. President C. W. Dabney, then of the University of 
Tennessee, was selected as chief of the bureau of investiga- 
tion, information, and publication; and the services of 
Dr. P. P. Claxton, then of the University of Tennessee, and 
Professor J. D. Eggleston, Jr., of Virginia, were secured for 
the bureau of publicity which was established at Knox- 
ville. 
The plans and purposes of this novel campaign for educa- 
tion met with the instant approval of the press of the South 
and the practical support of the leading people at that time 
engaged in school work in that section. Able advocates 
of better schools came forward and enlisted their services 
in the movement: college and university presidents and 
professors, lawyers, business men, officeholders, and other 
builders of public opinion. The most practical school 
questions were discussed in the meetings which were now 
held throughout the South — better buildings, increased 
school funds, improved teaching, improved legislation for 
schools, and more effective educational organization and 
administration generally. People gathered in schoolhouses, 
churches, courthouses, public halls, in city and country 
alike, to hear discussions of the ways and means of im- 
proving education for their communities. Popular educa- 
tion was the theme before multitudes, and enthusiasm for 
it spread widely and grew intimate with the people. Mean- 
time, the General Education Board was formed (1903) for 
the purpose of wise and systematic codperation with the  
-P-A-G-E-408
  392 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Southern Education Board, to investigate, collect, and pre- 
sent actual facts concerning educational conditions in the 
South, and to render financial assistance within the dis- 
cretion of its trustees and the limits of its resources. Its 
services to education in the South have been large and va- 
ried and have formed a wise and effective demonstration of 
method. 
The work of the General Education Board in the South has 
been in four main directions. Through the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture it has made large contributions for 
the promotion of practical farming, under an agreement be- 
gun in 1906. Demonstration farms are employed under su- 
pervision of demonstration agents whose work has been far- 
reaching. State demonstration agents also conduct work 
among boys and girls under actual farming conditions 
through boys’ and girls’ clubs. The promotion of secondary 
education constitutes another important service of the 
board which appropriates to the state universities or the 
state departments of education sums sufficient to pay the 
salaries and traveling expenses of high school experts. 
Through this means hundreds of secondary schools have been 
built and maintained in recent years. In addition to these 
services the board has made gifts for higher education in 
the South, as well as in other sections of the country, to in- 
crease endowments and equipment. It has also contributed 
largely to the support of negro schools, mainly those for the 
training of teachers, and has contributed towards the ex- 
penses of two rural school supervisors who work under the 
direction of state departments of education in each of the 
Southern states, for the promotion of better educational, 
economic, and social conditions of the colored people. 
Other services of the board have been rendered to medical 
education, schools of education, and the financing of studies 
or surveys of state school systems.
-P-A-G-E-409
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 393 
The Educational Advance 
The work of these agencies had a powerful and practical 
influence immediately on educational development in the 
South. Active campaigns for better schools and for im- 
proved educational facilities generally were promoted, be- 
ginning in North Carolina in 1902, in Virginia in 1903, in 
Georgia and Tennessee in 1904, in South Carolina, Alabama, 
and Mississippi in 1905, in Arkansas, Florida, and other 
states in 1908. Most of these campaigns were continued 
for several years with fruitful results. Improvements ap- 
peared in many ways: the educational provisions of the 
constitutions and laws were revised and strengthened ; in a 
decade school revenues were increased by 100 to 200 per 
cent; the improvement of schoolhouses was marked; by 
1910, the annual school term was lengthened to 121 days; 
and the enrollment and average attendance increased. 
Tlliteracy decreased, local taxes for schools multiplied, 
teachers’ salaries increased considerably in comparison with 
those paid in 1900, progress was made in the training of 
teachers through state-supported normal schools and teacher- 
training agencies in institutions of higher learning, and the 
certification of teachers was put on a better basis. The 
revival movement also gave impetus to the development of 
high schools, which began to be established in rural com- 
munities as an integral part of the state school systems. 
Interest in the consolidation of the smaller into larger and 
better graded and better equipped schools began to grow; 
rural libraries increased ; school-improvement and parent- 
teacher associations were formed; child labor and com- 
pulsory attendance legislation expanded; and supervision 
through a better type of county superintendent began to 
show improvement. 
By 1915 the average annual school term had lengthened 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
  
394 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
to 130 days. The average term for the United States in 
that year, however, was approximately 160 days. The 
average annual salary of all teachers was $328 in the South 
and $543 for the country at large. The average annual 
expenditure per child of school age was $8.50 for the South 
and $22.19 for the United States, and the value of school 
property per capita of school population was $18 and $79, 
respectively. Approximately 72 per cent of the school 
population in the South was enrolled, as against 74 per cent 
in the United States; nearly 69 per cent of the enrollment 
(50 per cent of the school population) was in average attend- 
ance in the South as compared with 76 per cent of the en- 
rollment (56 per cent of the school population) in the country 
as a whole. Out of 8906 public high schools reporting a 
four years’ course of study in the United States in 1915; 
with an enrollment of 1,362,514 pupils (about five per cent 
of the school population), only 1466 such schools with 
150,607 pupils (about two per cent of the school population) 
were in the South. A recent study of the United States 
Bureau of Education (Bulletin, 1922, No. 11) reports in the 
Southern states 1575 secondary schools, public and private, 
approved by the state departments of education and ac- 
credited by the state universities. Eight counties in 
Arkansas, twelve in Florida, sixty-four in Georgia, one in 
Mississippi, two in Tennessee, four in Louisiana, and two in 
Virginia are more recently reported as having no public 
high school of standard grade. 
Most of the Southern states still rank low among their 
sister states. Measured by attendance in elementary and 
in high school, in length of term, and in expenditure (per 
child of school age, per child attending, and per teacher 
for salaries) they ranked among the forty-eight states in 1918 
as follows: Texas, 36th; Florida, 37th; Virginia, 39th; 
Tennessee, 40th; Louisiana, 42d; Georgia, 48d; North  
-P-A-G-E-411
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 395 
Carolina, 44th; Alabama, 45th; Arkansas, 46th; Missis- 
sippi, 47th; and South Carolina, 48th. In that year the 
waste as a result of nonattendance, due largely to lack of 
adequate child labor and compulsory attendance laws, was 
about 33 per cent, with 25 per cent as the corresponding 
figure for the United States. The percentage of the school 
population enrolled in high schools of all grades was 9.3 in the 
United States and 5.1 per cent in the South. The increase 
in teachers’ salaries generally has been substantial, but the 
average annual salary now paid public elementary and sec- 
ondary teachers in the South is less than four fifths of the 
average for the United States. 
The explanation of this low educational position is not 
hard to find. With limited funds the Southern states must 
provide two systems of education for large numbers of 
children scattered over wide areas. They have relatively a 
larger school population than the other sections of the coun- 
try. For each thousand adult males in these states there 
are 1279 children of school age, while the corresponding 
average in the North is 789 and in the West about 600 
children. Moreover, the estimated average true value of 
all property for each child of school age in the South is ap- 
proximately one third that of the Northern states and 
one fourth that of the Western states. In addition, there is 
the disadvantage of sparsity of population in the South. 
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are the only 
Southern states having more than ten white children, and 
none has an average of ten colored children, of school age 
to the square mile. Moreover, the policy of separate 
schools is accepted as permanent. In the Northern states 
the average density of school population is from three to 
ten times greater than that of the South, and in the Western 
states, where the school population is small, it is largely con- 
centrated in the irrigated regions, rich river valleys, and  
-P-A-G-E-412
396 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
mining towns and is not so widely distributed as in the 
South. 
No fair account of recent educational progress in the 
South can be given, therefore, without taking these diffi- 
culties into account. Those states are rapidly finding their 
duty, however, not in the measure of their resources for 
school support but rather in the measure of their needs for 
it. With less than normal power they have had to bear ab- 
normal burdens. Between 1900 and 1915 the increase in 
public school expenditures for the United States was 180 
per cent, but in the South it was 280 per cent; and the 
policy of increased expenditures for the enlargement of 
educational facilities is rapidly coming to be accepted as 
permanent. The estimated public school maintenance 
expenditures for the present school year (1922-23) for the 
states reporting are: Arkansas, nine millions; Florida, 
ten millions; South Carolina, eleven millions; Georgia, 
fifteen millions ; North Carolina, twenty millions ; Louisiana, 
twenty millions; and Virginia, twenty-two millions. Vir- 
ginia to-day has public school property valued at nearly 
thirty-three millions, an increase of nearly 400 per cent 
since 1910; and the value of schoolhouses erected in North 
Carolina during the present school year is twenty-five 
millions, nearly twice the total value of all school property 
in that state in 1918. The public schools of Alabama be- 
tween 1918 and 1921 made 74 per cent as much progress as 
in the period from 1890 to 1918, as measured by the Ayres 
index numbers for state school systems. 
The tendency to improve administrative organization of 
public education has not, however, made the same progress 
in the South as in the country at large. Of the nine states 
in the Union still retaining ex officio state boards of edu- 
cation, four are Southern states — Texas, Florida, Missis- 
sippi, and North Carolina — and all the Southern states  
-P-A-G-E-413
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 397 
except Tennessee still elect their state superintendents of 
schools by popular vote. In seven of these states, county 
boards are elected by popular vote; but Texas, Florida, 
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Georgia continue to elect 
county superintendents of schools by that method. These 
latter officers are appointed by the county boards of educa- 
tion in North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama ; 
by the county courts in Tennessee; and by the state board 
of education in Virginia. In theory the county, but in 
practice the district, with many of its traditional functions, 
is the unit of local school administration. There is a hope- 
ful tendency, however, toward making the county the unit 
for the support and direction of public schools. Of signifi- 
cance also is the intelligent manner in which several Southern 
states have recently approached these administrative prob- 
lems through commissions to study and report on educational 
conditions. 
With the enactment of a compulsory attendance law in 
Mississippi in 1918 the last of the Southern states became 
committed to the policy of requiring children between cer- 
tain ages to attend school for all or some part of the school 
term. This movement ‘had begun in the South in 1905 
with the passage of initial legislation on the subject in 
Tennessee. North Carolina followed in 1907, Virginia in 
1908, Arkansas in 1909, Louisiana in 1910, South Carolina, 
Texas, Florida, and Alabama in 1915, Georgia in 1916, and 
Mississippi in 1918. Revisions, extensions, and improve- 
ments have been made in some of these states since the 
introductory enactments, though such legislation is still 
local and optional in character and very defective, lacking 
the full force of public approval needed for its complete 
success. 
Child labor legislation, theoretically closely related to 
compulsory attendance laws, is found in all the Southern
-P-A-G-E-414
398 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
states. But reform is needed here also. Some of the states 
have made beginnings in legislation and practices designed 
to protect dependent and delinquent children. Perhaps 
one of the most advanced and complete plans not only in 
the South but in the country at large is that set up in North 
Carolina in 1919, providing for county boards of public 
welfare and a juvenile court in every county with juris- 
diction over all delinquent, neglected, and dependent chil- 
dren under sixteen years of age. Improvement has appeared 
also in general health regulations and the physical examina- 
tions of school children and in renewed efforts, largely as a 
result of the war, to eliminate illiteracy, with which the 
South is still shamefully burdened. 
Other hopeful signs of educational progress appear in the 
tendency to improve the status of the public school teacher 
by raising and standardizing the qualifications to teach and 
by making provision for the teachers to meet the require- 
ments by enlarging teacher-training facilities. Thetendency 
is toward state rather than county certification and toward 
accrediting approved university and college diplomas and 
accepting credentials of teachers from other states. 
The Task for the Future 
To furnish the kind and amount of education now needed 
in the South further reform and reorganization seem nec- 
essary. More emphasis must be placed on expert educational 
leadership and direction throughout. The traditional ex 
officio state boards of education need to be replaced by 
boards of representative men and women who are recog- 
nized for their sane and progressive attitudes toward, and 
demonstrated ability to promote, public school work. The 
demand likewise is for a change in the selection of the state 
superintendent. He is potentially the most strategic officer 
of the average American state, and the duties of his office 
 
-P-A-G-E-415
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 399 
require a high order of business and executive ability and 
professional skill which can never be guaranteed by popular 
election and which are rarely ever at home with those 
characteristics which usually commend men to political 
leaders and party bosses. The choice of a state superin- 
tendent of schools should not be limited to the narrow bounds 
of the state, which is necessary when selection is by popular 
election. There is needed also a more enlightened county 
board of educational control, chosen from the citizens at 
large, for reasonably long terms, and with powers and duties 
similar to those of city school boards, and selected for recog- 
nized ability to direct the large enterprise of public schools 
in the county rather than for political reasons. A new con- 
ception of the office of county superintendent is also urgently 
needed in the South. Popular elections have no proper 
place in filling such an office, the duties of which are executive 
and professional in character. The local district system, 
still powerful in the South, needs likewise to be replaced 
by the county as the principal unit of support, organization 
and administration, and supervision. The proper and ade- 
quate education of the negro, one of the most confusing 
problems now facing the Southern states, is dealt with in 
Chapter XV. 
The Southern states have always been primarily agricul- 
tural, and approximately 80 per cent of the people still live 
in rural sections, with farming as their occupation. The 
permanent prosperity and well-being of the South, therefore, 
depend upon the prosperity and well-being of the rural 
population. For this reason the strategic point in the 
South’s future growth appears in the kind of provision that 
is made for the education of the rural people. Differences 
between the educational advantages provided for the chil- 
dren of the country and those provided for the chil- 
dren of the towns and cities are glaring. The rural school  
-P-A-G-E-416
  400 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
has not yet been standardized and modernized or touched 
by that spirit of improvement which has been marked in 
urban education, but the increasing interest in the con- 
solidation of the small and ineffective schools into larger, 
better organized, better supported, and more closely super- 
vised schools, is one of the hopeful signs of improvement. 
The building and maintenance of modern roads and high- 
ways, the encouragement of progressive methods of agricul- 
ture, the improvement of public health, are uniting with 
the movement for better rural schools to make rural life in 
the South more wholesome and inviting. Only by these 
means can real and lasting progress there be promoted. 
No material prosperity will be of advantage if the level of 
citizenship and public wholesomeness is not thereby ad- 
vanced through education. 
The material wealth of the South has grown great 
and apparent. The value of manufactured products is 
twice as great as that of the entire United States in 
1880. During the last two decades the value of farm 
property has increased more than 400 per cent and the 
value of farm products nearly 600 per cent. The value 
of mineral products is six times as great as ten years ago. 
These facts not only reveal the industrial change but 
they furnish illustration of how intimately is the South 
related to the life of the whole country. The Southern 
states are no longer poor. In recent years they have made 
such a giant stride from poverty to prosperity that they 
are now able to do almost anything for public schools, public 
roads, and public health. The World War, moreover, not 
only revealed the weaknesses of education there, but it also 
helped the South to find herself. Under the impetus of 
the call to fight, to give, and to do for others what she had 
not felt fully able to do for herself, she found fresh hope and 
new energies. The call for food for our own and the soldiers
-P-A-G-E-417
  EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 401 
of Europe, the campaign against waste, and the drives 
for the Red Cross and Liberty Bonds, led the South to 
thoughtful consideration of new enterprises and of old ones 
undeveloped. More nearly complete remedies for her short- 
comings were thus revealed. 
The measure of the South’s conscience on schools and 
other means of intellectual progress must be taken neither 
from her impatience with unsympathetic and unintelligent 
criticism from without nor from her ability to build schools, 
but rather from her constantly growing need for education. 
Just as the chief problem of the South twenty-five years 
ago was to secure complete agreement on education, so to- 
day her chief need is to educate. The task to-day is little 
less conspicuous than then for its magnitude and difficulty. 
The task now is to build schools on a sound basis of financial 
support, professional direction, and supervision, so as to 
furnish every child equal educational rights — ‘‘the op- 
portunity ‘to burgeon out all that there is within him,’”’ 
to use the sentiment of the late Aycock, North Carolina’s 
educational governor. Then, and then only, will the people 
of the South be enabled to observe fully, faithfully, and 
intelligently, their constantly enlarging relationships and, 
in the paraphrase of Jefferson, the earliest of the South’s 
educational statesmen, to understand what goes on in the 
world and keep their part of it going right.

CHAPTER XV 
Tue Epucation or tHE NEGRO 
Introduction 
The history of the education of the negro since his eman- 
cipation falls into two periods. In the first, a period of 
experimentation embraced by the years 1865 to 1895, two 
facts were clearly demonstrated: (1) that Northern philan- 
thropy without the aid of federal or other public funds could 
not support the burden of educating some. two or three 
million colored children; (2) that literacy alone could not 
accomplish the regeneration of the race. Upon the expe- 
rience of the first era was based the procedure of the second. 
During this period, embraced in the quarter-century that 
has just elapsed, Northern philanthropy has tended more 
and more to coérdinate its efforts and to direct its activities 
toward assisting the war-broken Southern states to assume 
their proper burden in educating all the children of all the 
people. During this period also the message of Samuel 
Armstrong and Booker Washington has been largely ac- 
cepted and spread abroad as the gospel of regeneration 
through industrial training. 
The Education of the Negro a Southern Problem 
Nine tenths of the total negro population of the United 
States, according to the census of 1910, are to be found in 
the South. About thirty per cent of the total population 
of the South is of the colored race, while less than two per 
cent of the population of the Northern states was so reported 
at that date. More than half the population of Mississippi 
405 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
    
406 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and South Carolina are negroes. While there is a large 
number of negroes living in the North and West, an in- 
creasingly large number within recent years, the bulk of the 
negro population lies south of the Ohio and the Potomac. 
The problem of negro education is thus essentially a 
Southern problem. And, since the support for white and 
colored schools comes from a common source, whatever 
conditions affect the growth and efficiency of the public 
school system in any Southern state affects the growth and 
efficiency of both white and colored schools. Economic 
retardation, for instance, is largely responsible for the 
backwardness of white as well as of negro schools. A brief 
survey of the social and economic conditions that have 
handicapped the Southern states in their efforts to solve their 
educational problems may here be in order. 
To begin with there is the handicap of adult illiteracy, 
which in 1890 affected fifteen per cent of the native white 
population and almost two thirds of the negro population. 
Thanks to the efficiency of such schools as have been available, 
negro illiteracy in the country as a whole has been reduced to 
22.9 per cent and native white illiteracy to 2.5 per cent in 
1920. The reports on illiteracy tend to show that there was 
a higher percentage of illiteracy among negroes in the South 
than in the North or West, and a higher percentage in the 
rural than in the urban communities of the South. In 
other words, illiteracy is greatest where opportunities for 
schooling are most meager. 
Sparseness of population is undoubtedly one of the great- 
est handicaps under which the South is at present laboring. 
The factor of sparseness becomes all the more acute when it 
becomes necessary to provide separate schools in the open 
country for white and colored children. No state in the 
South in 1918 had as many as ten negro children to the square 
mile; Arkansas, Texas, and Florida had no more than three 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
  THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 407 
to the square mile. Compare these averages with those for 
several Northern states, where the negro population was a 
negligible quantity. Massachusetts had 107, New Jersey 
98, Connecticut 61 children to the square mile. This means 
that it takes eight times as large a territory in the South as it 
does in the North to provide enough children for a small one- 
teacher negro school. 
The South is also handicapped by a lack of wealth. It has 
been estimated that in 1912 there was in the eleven Southern 
states an average of $3449 per child of school age. Among 
the agricultural states of the Middle West we find Iowa with 
wealth to the amount of $13,473 per child and Illinois with 
wealth to the amount of $10,808 per child. In the ten years 
that have elapsed since these estimates were made there has 
been a considerable increase in the wealth of the South, but 
not by any means enough to bring the South abreast of the 
states of the North and West. 
The reason for the backwardness of negro schools is to be 
found not altogether in the hostility of the whites toward 
negro education. It may best be accounted for by the same 
reasons that explain the backwardness of the white schools. 
Although the past quarter of a century has witnessed an 
enormous increase in the wealth of every Southern state, it 
must be remembered that by 1910 some of the states had 
not yet recovered from the devastation wrought by the Civil 
War. 
The Hampton Idea 
The story of the progress of negro education in the last 
twenty-five years takes us back to 1897, four years after 
General 8. C. Armstrong laid down his work at Hampton. 
Since educational practice in this generation owes so much 
to the theory first enunciated by this fervent advocate of 
negro education, it may be well to set forth the cardinal
-P-A-G-E-424
  408 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
principles for which he stood. In 1868 he undertook to 
found at Hampton, Virginia, a school after the manual 
labor plan prevalent in many parts of the United States 
before the Civil War. In certain respects, however, his 
theory of education was broader than that of the manual 
labor schools of an earlier date. He held that pupils should 
engage in manual labor not merely to defray apart of their 
school expenses or to learn a trade, but to develop mind and 
character. The moral value of industrial training, he said, 
was a sufficient justification of it, and character the chief 
outcome of the labor system. His idea can best be indicated/ 
by a quotation which dates from 1870: 
The education needed is one that touches upon the whole range of life, 
that aims at the formation of good habits and sound principles, that 
considers the details of each day, that enjoins in respect to diet, regularity, 
proper selection, and good cooking ; in respect to habits, suitable clothing, 
exercise, cleanliness of persons, and quarters, and ventilation, also industry, 
and thrift; and in respect to all things, intelligent practice and self- 
restraint. 
Tn all men, education is conditioned not alone on an enlightened head 
and a changed heart but very largely on a routine of industrious habits, 
which is to character what the foundation is to the pyramid. The summit 
should glow with a divine light, interfusing and qualifying the whole mass, 
but it is only upon a foundation of regular daily activities that there can 
be any fine and permanent upbuilding. Morality and industry generally 
go together. 
The institution established by General Armstrong was 
chartered as Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, 
a name which suggests the character of the instruction that 
was to be offered. The founder seems to have grasped the 
significance of adapting instruction to the needs of an 
agricultural people. That he had a clearer understanding of 
the social situation which confronted him than most of his 
contemporaries future developments in negro education 
were to demonstrate. He understood the limitations of the 
race, and the industrial training which he offered at Hampton 
was designed to provide such social and economic experience 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 409 
as the race on the whole needed most. Since Armstrong’s 
death, through the able administration of Hollis B. Frissell 
the institution for a period of twenty-five years has enjoyed a 
season of remarkable prosperity. The new administration 
has carried forward to fulfillment the purposes of the founder 
and demonstrated the effectiveness of industrial education in 
racial uplift. In 1922 Hampton was offering training in 
upward of thirty trades, including household arts, manual 
arts, and agriculture. In 1917 its equipment was valued at 
about $2,000,000, and its endowment was in excess of 
$3,000,000. By the same date it had turned out 1782 
graduates, 539 of whom were engaged in teaching. 
Booker. T. Washington 
The Hampton idea has not been confined to a single 
institution. It has spread throughout the South, has 
influenced the trend of industrial education in other parts of 
the United States, and has been carried by missionaries to 
China, Ceylon, Africa, and Rhodesia. In 1881 there went 
from Hampton to the little village of Tuskegee in Alabama 
a young negro who had caught the vision of General Arm- 
strong and had been fired by his zeal. To this man, Booker 
T. Washington, the negro race is indebted for elucidating, 
defending, and propagating the idea of social uplift through 
industrial training. Washington found a hearing not only 
in the North, where philanthropists gave him liberal con- 
tributions to develop Tuskegee Institute, but he secured what 
he prized equally as much, the indorsement of his principles 
by leaders of the white race in the South. 
He had observed, as had J. L. M. Curry and others, that 
the opposition of the Southern white people, prevalent in 
certain parts of the country during the Reconstruction 
Period, had now subsided into supine indifference. So long 
as they were not taxed to support it they did not care what
-P-A-G-E-426
410 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
kind of education the negro obtained. They might sneer 
at the abortive results of the so-called ‘‘colleges,’’? but 
Southern white people no longer actively opposed the efforts 
to educate the negro. Washington had sagacity enough to 
see that Northern philanthropy could not support the 
burden of educating the entire negro race. Hope for federal 
aid.in this enterprise had been dissipated by the failure of the 
Blair Bill a decade earlier. The only hope for the negro lay, 
as Washington saw it, in arousing the Southern people to the 
point of providing substantial aid from state and local funds. 
As he expressed it : 
One of the chief hindrances to the progress of negro education in the 
public schools in the South is in my opinion due to the fact that the negro 
colleges in which so many of the teachers-are prepared have not realized 
the importance of convincing the Southern white people that education 
makes the same improvement in the negro that it does in the white man ; 
makes him more useful in labour, so much better a citizen, and so much 
more dependable in all the relations of life, that it is worth while to spend 
money to give him an education. As long as the Southern white people 
remain unconvinced by the results of the education which they see about 
them that education makes the negro a better man or woman, so long will 
the masses of the negro people who are dependent upon the public schools 
for their instruction remain to a greater or less extent in ignorance. 
By the year 1895 Booker Washington had established 
a substantial institution at Tuskegee after the pattern 
of Hampton, and had attained a place of national impor- 
tance in education. His enthusiastic advocacy of industrial 
training, however, had brought him into open conflict with 
able leaders of his own race who mistook his emphasis on 
this form of education for a condemnation of academic 
instruction and of higher education of the negro in general. 
Washington was equal to the controversy. In 1897 he 
answered his critics as follows: 
I am convinced that whether the negro receives much education or 
little, whether it be called high or low, we have reached the point in our 
development where a larger proportion of those who are being educated 
should, while they are receiving their education or after they have received 
it, be taught to connect their education with some industrial pursuit.
-P-A-G-E-427
  
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 411 
Booker Washington repeatedly expressed himself as not 
opposed to professional education or to any form of higher 
education of the negro, but as favoring most the form of 
education that would best equip the colored population to 
make their way materially and socially in their rural en- 
vironment. 
As the chief exponent of industrial education, he received 
both praise and criticism. Some members of his own race 
construed his advocacy of this form of education as the 
barring of the door to higher education against exceptional 
negroes. Industrial training to some appeared the forging 
of the fetters of slavery again upon the negro, which would 
subject the race to manual labor forever. To others the 
practical ideals of physical well-being and economic gain, so 
frequently stressed by Washington, seemed too materialistic. 
To clarify the matter it may be well to examine several 
excerpts from his works which contain the gist of his theory. 
Mere hand training, without thorough moral, religious, and mental 
education, counts for very little. The hands, the head, and the heart 
together, as the essential elements of educational need, should be so 
correlated that one may be made to help the other. 
How well I remember the feeling of stimulus and satisfaction inspired by 
the sight of a perfectly made bed, the pillows placed always at the right 
angle, and the edges of the sheets turned over according to rules of neatness 
and system. The work of the farm had a similar influence upon my views 
of relative values in education. I soon learned that there was a great 
difference between studying about things and studying the things them- 
selves, between book instruction and the illumination of practical ex- 
perience. 
Their classroom work in spelling, mathematics, grammar, and English 
composition comes effectively into play. They find out that a carpenter 
has a small chance of getting ahead unless he can use his head intelligently. 
He writes out a contract, for example, to put up a four-room house, on the 
basis of three cash payments — when he takes the job; when the roof is 
on; and when the house is turned over to the owner. This contract is 
read aloud to the instructor, who asks the other members of the class to 
criticise it. One of them points out a flaw which would allow the owner 
to ‘crawl out’ of his bargain on a technicality. Another is pleased to 
discover that the arithmetic is so faulty that the estimates of the cost of
-P-A-G-E-428
  412 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
material would land the contractor in the poor-house. Then the student 
begins to see that his so-called academic teaching is as important in his 
calling as his skill with the plane, the saw and the miter-box, and that he 
cannot hope to become a good carpenter unless he is also a diligent scholar. 
These excerpts express the ideas which Washington 
repeated time and again in his books, in his speeches, and in 
his contributions to periodicals. He represents his work as 
a ‘training for conditions’ and as “welding theory and 
‘practice.”’ To him, as to General Armstrong, industrial 
training had a moral value. Good habits in thinking and 
behavior were to be formed in an environment that would 
insure their future functioning. If there was much emphasis 
of material success it was because a low standard of living 
was largely responsible for the negro’s moral shortcomings. 
He had in mind not the ‘‘talented tenth” of W. E. B. Du 
Bois, but the masses of his race living, and destined to live, 
the lives of a simple farming people in the rural South. 
Accused of fixing an industrial mold for a colored caste, he 
replied that he was merely adapting instruction to the 
needs of his people. For more than thirty years, with tongue 
and pen, he preached the gospel of regeneration through 
industrial training. 
Before the end of the past century the drift toward 
industrial education had definitely set in. Leading thinkers 
upon the subject, men like J. L. M. Curry and A. D. Mayo, 
were at that time preaching it throughout the North and 
South. An investigation, conducted by the New Orleans 
Times-Democrat in 1897, showed that the majority of the 
presidents of the negro colleges and most of the missionary 
bishops having colored institutions under their control were 
in favor of it. Several religious boards operating negro 
schools introduced industrial training in some form or other 
about this time. 
The idea has now been definitely accepted as one of the 
essential principles in the education of the negro. Industrial
-P-A-G-E-429
  THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 413 
education has furnished the common ground for the com- 
ing together of the three interested parties, the North- 
ern philanthropist, the negro, and the Southern white man. 
An agreement on principles having been reached during the 
past decade, the basis for an effective system of public 
education has been laid. The problem of providing a simple 
form of industrial training that may be widely and cheaply 
distributed is now being solved by the county training schools 
and by the industrial supervisors provided by the Jeanes 
Fund. 
The Public Schools 
In the past twenty-five years the chief gains in negro 
education are to be found not in statistics indicating prog- 
ress, but in the unmeasurable growth of a sentiment among 
Southern whites favorable to such education. Booker 
Washington, who knew the South better perhaps than most 
observers in the field, said that the Southern people were not 
so much opposed to negro education as indifferent to it. 
If they could be brought to see the advantages of increased 
productivity, community health, and social betterment to 
be derived from the education of the negro, Washington did 
not doubt that they could be won to the cause. In this con- 
viction he was not alone. Able leaders of the South, such as 
Bishop Atticus G. Haygood, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, and Bishop 
Charles B. Galloway, urged their people time and again to 
make a more generous provision for the negro schools. 
With the opening of the new century we find a number of 
hopeful signs of the development of a favorable sentiment. 
Representative Southern men, speaking before the Southern 
Conference for Education in 1903, expressed the opinion that 
the Southern whites wished to do well by the negro ‘‘in spite 
of the difficulties.” This Conference, which held yearly 
meetings for a decade or more, did much to awaken the
-P-A-G-E-430
  414 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Southern people to their responsibility for public schools for 
both races. In 1912 the Southern University Race Commis- 
sion was organized, composed of professors representing 
eleven Southern universities. The purpose of the Com- 
mission is to study race relationships with a view to bringing 
about a permanent adjustment of differences. The Southern 
Sociological Congress began about this time to call together 
the outstanding representatives of both races for the study 
of their common problems. For a decade the Southern 
Student Conference, held each summer at Blue Ridge, North 
Carolina, by the International Committee of the Young 
Men’s Christian Association, has been conducting classes 
in the study of the race problem. Dr. W. D. Weatherford, 
the leader of the Conference, has done much through his 
writings and speeches to develop a healthy spirit of coépera- 
tion between the races. Other hopeful signs of better feeling 
are to be found in the codperation of the states and local 
units with agents of the General Education Board and the 
Jeanes Fund, and in the contribution of public and private 
funds by white people to the county training schools and to 
the Rosenwald Schools. 
The tendency of the Southern states to pass compulsory 
education laws is also a wholesome sign. The chief argument 
of the demagogues against compulsory attendance was for 
years the argument that it would bring negro children into 
schools, promote literacy among the negroes, and perhaps 
lead to negro domination in politics. Before 1890 no 
Southern state had a compulsory law. By 1908 Virginia 
and North Carolina had secured the passage of such laws. 
At present every state has compulsory attendance, but in 
one or two the local option feature still prevails. 
Opportunities for education in both white and colored 
schools are, as has been previously pointed out, and for the 
reasons indicated (Chapter XIV), somewhat more limited in
-P-A-G-E-431
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 415 
the Southern states than in the North and West. While 
instances of superior advantages may be noted in exceptional 
communities of every Southern state, on the whole it must be 
admitted that schools for both races, when compared with 
schools in other sections, are decidedly backward. If 
schools for white children are poor, the schools for negroes 
are poorer. : 
State superintendents of education, reporting to the United 
States Bureau of Education in 1912, painted a sorry picture 
of the condition of negro rural schools. One of them wrote: 
There has never been any serious attempt in this state to offer adequate 
facilities for the colored race. The average length of the term for the state 
is only four months; practically all the schools are taught in dilapidated 
churches, which, of course, are not equipped with suitable desks, black- 
boards, and other essentials of a school; practically all the teachers are 
incompetent, possessing little or no education and having had no pro- 
fessional training whatever, except a few weeks obtained in the summer 
schools; the schools are generally overcrowded, some of them having as 
many as one hundred students to the teacher; no attempt is made to do 
more than teach the children to read, write, and figure... . It can 
probably be truthfully said that the negro schools here are gradually 
improving but they are still just about as poor and inadequate as they can 
be. 
The Rural School Supervisor of South Carolina, W. K. 
Tate, reported : 
Among the negro rural schools which I have visited I have found only 
one in which the highest class knew the multiplication table. The teacher 
is attempting to use the books and follow the course of study provided by 
the State Board of Education and intended primarily for white schools. 
A statistical summary of the negro schools in Mississippi 
for the decade ending in 1910 concludes as follows : ! 
In the negro schools we see a few of the marks of progress, but we 
cannot say that they have advanced very far. In the last ten years there 
has been a substantial increase in the enrollment and average attendance. 
The number of teachers has increased 17.5 per cent, but has by no means 
kept pace with the enrollment. The average negro teacher now has to 
teach four children more than he did in 1899, and receives for it ninety-two 
cents more a month. He is now attempting the Herculean task of teach-

Reference to the Education of the Negro.

ing sixty-seven children, or almost twice as many as the average white 
teacher is required to teach. Were it not for the fact that such a small 
percentage of the enrollment is in daily attendance, colored teachers would 
be able to accomplish little indeed. As things now stand, we can hope for 
but the most meager returns. 
The writer of the foregoing, summarizing a chapter on the 
apparent lack of progress of the negro masses, says : 
For the masses, however, the lack of progress indicated by the statistical 
studies of this chapter is typical. . . . In view of the meager equipment of 
the rural schools, the short terms, the formal courses of study, the ill- 
trained and poorly paid teachers, it would be marvelous indeed, if greater 
results were forthcoming. It is trite to say that the virtual stagnation of 
fifty-six per cent of the population of Mississippi constitutes a menace to 
the social and economic health of the state. Better facilities and specific 
training leading to moral and economic efficiency will alone improve the 
situation. 
The field agent of the Slater Fund described the situation 
in 1912 as follows: 
In the states of the lower South the physical equipment of colored 
schools is far below what it is in Virginia and North Carolina. In many 
eases in Georgia and Alabama, for instance, schoolhouses are not provided 
by the public. Only the teacher’s salary comes from that source. In 
South Carolina there are 2,354 public schools for colored people, but there 
are only 1,442 public schoolhouses. The county boards of Georgia own 
only 208 colored schoolhouses, worth on the average $166 each... . 
Alabama reports for colored people only 975 schoolhouses owned by the 
state, local communities, and towns and cities. . . .

THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 417 
From these excerpts and from the accompanying table of 
statistics of public schools in the Southern states the reader 
is enabled to get a more or less satisfactory view of the 
facilities for negro education. The study of negro education 
made through the Phelps-Stokes Fund and published as a 
bulletin of the United States Bureau of Education in 1917 
makes certain other observations worthy of notice. It calls 
attention not only to the inadequacy of the material equip- 
ment of the schools, to the short terms and irregular attend- 
ance, but to overcrowding, to the poorness of instruction, 
and to the crying need for proper supervision. In three 
typical counties of Alabama were found eighty colored 
schools with a seating capacity of 3794, an enrollment of 
6391, and an attendance of 5832. It is shown that 70 per 
cent of the teachers in schools of the black belt have them- 
selves never attended school beyond the sixth grade. It is 
further shown that little progress had been made in adapting 
the state-prescribed course of study to the needs of negro 
children of the rural masses, and that supervision other than 
that of the Jeanes Fund agents was to be found only in cities 
and in exceptional communities. 
The period between 1902 and 1914 was a period of re- 
markable development for secondary education in the South. 
But, of the schools established, by far the greater number 
were for the use of the white race. Only a small number of 
Southern cities and towns have developed high schools for 
negroes. The Phelps-Stokes study listed sixty-four public 
high schools for the colored race in the entire South, and 
mentioned two hundred other schools which enrolled a few 
secondary pupils. The best schools of either elementary or 
secondary grade are to be found in the cities. There the 
advantages for each race are more nearly equalized; better 
teachers are secured, higher salaries are paid, and more 
supervision is provided.
-P-A-G-E-434
  418 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Much improvement in the public school system, has un- 
doubtedly been made in the last half-dozen years. With the 
return of prosperity all the states of the South are in much 
better economic circumstances than ever before. There is 
considerable evidence that this prosperity is bringing to the 
negro schools a larger proportionate share of the public 
revenues. The assistance of the philanthropic boards of the 
North is calling forth the effort of the South. All this is a 
good augury for the future of negro education. 
The Jeanes Industrial Supervisors 
The Jeanes Fund, established by the bequest of Anna T. 
Jeanes of Philadelphia, undertook in 1908 to send industrial 
supervisors into the negro schools of the rural districts, 
where instruction at best was meager and facilities for 
teaching were unspeakably poor. Begun in a small way, the 
number of supervisors has been increased year by year until 
in 1921 there were 272 engaged in 269 Southern counties. 
These traveling teachers visited that year 8900 schools and 
raised for school improvement $395,000. Working under 
the direction of the county superintendents, they encouraged 
the feeble efforts of rural teachers, introduced simple home 
industries into backward schools, gave talks on sanitation 
and cleanliness, promoted the improvement of school- 
houses, and organized clubs for the betterment of school 
and neighborhood. 
The supervising teachers are trained in industrial work, 
domestic and agricultural. They are prepared to show the 
rural teacher how to teach sewing, cooking, gardening, 
laundering, and sometimes nursing, basket making, car- 
pentry, and farming. A county superintendent describes 
the work of one of the earliest of the Jeanes workers as 
follows :
-P-A-G-E-435
  
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 419 
He commenced at once to organize in each colored school visited a 
school improvement association, codperative corn and cotton clubs, where 
the school children and patrons cultivated the grounds, taking lessons in 
agriculture at the same time, agreeing that the proceeds arising therefrom 
should inure to the benefit of the school, in equipping the same and ex- 
tending the length of the school term, introducing manual labor, both for 
boys and girls. . . . The schoolyards have been cleared off and planted 
in trees and flowers, corn and cotton clubs organized, work done on the 
little farms, and manual arts and domestic science introduced into most of 
the schools, where wood work, raffia, straw basket making, and sewing 
are being learned by the children. . . . 
At the outset the Jeanes Fund bore the entire expense of 
the supervisors, but within a year or two some of the counties 
assumed a part of the burden of support, and others assumed 
responsibility for the whole cost. The Jeanes workers are 
appointed by the county superintendents and are members 
of the county teaching body, just as other teachers are. 
Here we have a splendid instance of an enlightened philan- 
thropy assisting Southern public school authorities to help 
themselves. 
County Training Schools 
County training schools for negroes were first organized in 
1912. The beginning was made by four Southern counties 
in codperation with the Slater Fund. As stated at the time 
of organization the purpose of the schools is: 
1. To supply for the county a central school offering work in advance 
of that offered in the common rural schools. 
2. To lay emphasis on thorough work in all common school studies. 
3. To give industrial training, laying particular emphasis upon subjects 
pertaining to: home and farm. 
4. To prepare boys and girls to make a good living and lead a useful life 
by knowing how to care for the home, to utilize land, to make home 
gardens, to raise their own meat, poultry, products, milk products, ete. 
5. To prepare young men and women to become rural and elementary 
school teachers. . . . 
The chief motive for the founding of these schools is to be 
found in the last of the purposes just mentioned —the 
training of rural school teachers. The schools are organized.
-P-A-G-E-436
  
420 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
as public institutions, the title of all property being held by 
the county, state, or district. They are under the super- 
vision of the county superintendents just as other public 
schools. Aid from the Slater Fund to the amount of $500 
for teachers’ salaries is provided on condition that $750 be 
appropriated from public funds for salaries. 
The average length of term of the negro rural school in the 
South is considerably shorter than that of the white school. 
Negro children are not able to cover the ground covered by 
white children of the same age. The average negro pupil in 
the rural districts is retarded from two to five years. Eco- 
nomic necessity forces a large number out of school at an 
early age. Whatever vocational work is offered in the 
school must be introduced earlier than in the white school if 
it is to reach anything like a fair proportion of the pupils. 
For these reasons it is recommended that the county training 
schools be organized upon the five-two-three plan, that is, 
five years of primary work, two years of elementary work, 
and three years of secondary work. 
In the suggested course of study for the county training 
schools, published in 1917, industrial work is introduced in 
the third year and continued throughout the remainder of the 
ten-year course. Beginning with weaving of mats and other 
useful articles from pine needles, corn husks, and other native 
materials, the work for girls advances into sewing and 
darning, making of hats, cooking of plain meals, preserving, 
care of beds, dressmaking, nursing, and home making. The 
work for boys is differentiated from that of the girls in the 
fourth year and proceeds with chair caning, the use of simple 
tools, cobbling, harness mending, whitewashing, repair of 
farm implements, blacksmithing, concrete mixing, etc. 
The aim of the secondary school is largely vocational. 
Three courses are offered: (1) a home-makers’ course for 
girls, (2) a farm-makers’ course for boys, and (8) a rural
-P-A-G-E-437
  
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 421 
teacher-training course. The stress placed upon the in- 
dustrial subjects in this school as well as in the primary and 
elementary grades is in accord with the theory of adapting the 
curriculum to local needs. 
The committee on course of study does not neglect the 
minimum essentials, the three R’s, history, current topics, 
hygiene and sanitation, civics, moral training, and physical 
exercise. 
The report of the Slater Fund for the session 1920-21 shows 
that by this date 142 counties in fourteen Southern states 
had established county training schools. In nine years the 
number of teachers had increased from 20 to 840, the average 
yearly salary from $267 to $640, and the total receipts from 
$11,000 to $1,007,000. In 1920-21 there was a total enroll- 
ment in county training schools of 35,317, of which number 
2347 were in grades above the eighth. The General Educa- 
tion Board has since 1915 coédperated with the Slater Fund 
in providing equipment, workshops, and teachers’ homes. 
The schools draw pupils from all parts of the counties in 
which they are located. Boarding facilities are sometimes 
provided; but, in general, the schools are handicapped by 
lack of dormitory facilities. 
Through the medium of the county training school it is 
hoped to make up one of the chief deficiencies of the negro 
schools. The supply of trained teachers for the country 
schools is in this way to be provided, and industrial training 
in an elementary form is thus to be carried to the remotest 
country districts. 
Activities of the General Education Board 
The General Education Board of New York City out of its 
ample funds has, since 1902, the date of its organization, 
made increasingly liberal contributions toward the support 
of negro education in the South. In the states of Alabama,
-P-A-G-E-438
422 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, and Virginia, the Board is coéperating with the state 
departments of education in the development of better 
schools, and better economic and social conditions in the 
rural sections. The undertaking is in charge of state agents 
for negro rural schools, whose salaries and traveling expenses 
are paid by the General Education Board. The agents 
codperate sympathetically with county superintendents 
and with interested white and colored citizens in promoting 
the welfare of negro schools. The Board has also rendered 
material assistance to the Jeanes Foundation by contributing 
to its work of assisting counties to employ supervising in- 
dustrial teachers. It has also coéperated with the Slater 
Fund in providing equipment for schools and in contributing 
toward the building of teachers’ homes. The Board, through 
the state departments of education in 1918, aided fifty-nine 
summer schools for negro teachers. These schools were 
manned by 478 teachers and enrolled 6157 students. Sum- 
mer scholarships at Hampton and Tuskegee have also been 
provided for a number of deserving and specially qualified 
teachers. The success of the policy of the General Board 
of Education in training the Southern public school authori- 
ties to help themselves is proved by the fact that Texas has 
recently taken over the entire expense of the state supervisor 
of negro schools. 
The Rosenwald Fund 
The crying needs of the negro schools have been for 
trained teachers, supervision of instruction, and material 
equipment. Other agencies have undertaken to train 
teachers and provide supervision. No means for providing 
better schoolhouses had been secured until Booker Wash- 
ington interested Julius Rosenwald of Chicago in the enter-
-P-A-G-E-439
  THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 423 
prise. In the last eight years, through the assistance of 
Mr. Rosenwald, it has been possible to erect in fourteen 
Southern states over fourteen hundred negro schoolhouses. 
Most of these are of the one- and two-teacher type, but 
fifty of them cost $10,000 or more, and one of them as much 
as $104,000. Aid to the extent of $300 for the building of a 
schoolhouse may be obtained from the Rosenwald Fund by 
any community duplicating this amount either from public 
funds or from private contributions. The Rosenwald Fund 
codperates with the public school systems just as the other 
philanthropic agencies are doing. The state departments 
of education supervise the building of the schoolhouses. It 
is stipulated that at least two acres of land must be pro- 
vided before the building is begun, and that due consideration 
be given in the construction to lighting, heating, ventilation, 
and sanitation. Plans and specifications are furnished by 
the Rosenwald Fund. These school buildings undoubtedly 
furnish the best facilities available for education of the colored 
youth in the rural districts of the South. 
Private Schools 
The Report of the United States Commissioner of Education 
for the year 1897 lists 178 secondary and higher institutions 
for the education of the colored race. This number included 
the land-grant agricultural colleges and several state-sup- 
ported state normal schools. Of the 170 institutions located 
in the South the greater part were under the control of 
denominational or other philanthropic boards. Practically 
all of them had elementary, secondary, college, and some- 
times professional departments. 
It is safe to say that this was not a complete list of the 
- private institutions for the education of the colored race. 
Twenty years later, when the Phelps-Stokes study was made, 
there were discovered 655 institutions under private control,
-P-A-G-E-440
  
424 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
with a total enrollment of 83,679. Only 266 of these insti- 
tutions were classed as ‘‘large or important.’’ Of the total 
student enrollment, 70,654 were found to be pupils in the 
elementary grades; 11,527, pupils in the secondary grades ; 
and 1588, pupils in the colleges and professional departments. 
The period of our study is characterized by searching 
inquiry into the purposes, needs, practices, and products of 
the privately supported negro schools of the South. Dr. J. 
L. M. Curry, agent of the Slater Fund, reported in 1895 
that much of the money contributed by charitably disposed 
persons of the North and South to the support of negro 
schools had been largely misapplied. Many of the higher 
private schools, he said, were ‘‘ handicapped by high-sounding 
and deceptive names and impossible courses of study.” 
Elementary, secondary, and college departments were often 
found under the same roof. In the twenty-five nominal 
colleges he estimated that there were enrolled only about 
one thousand students. 
In estimating the character of the instruction offered 
Doctor Curry said : 
The general instruction heretofore given in the schools, it is feared, has 
been too exclusively intellectual, too little of that kind which produces 
intelligent and skilled workmen, and therefore not thoroughly adapted to 
racial development nor to fitting for the practical duties of life. 
Professor Kelly Miller, a noted negro scholar, in an 
interesting study published in the Report of the United States 
Commissioner of Education in 1901, said : 
The wild clamor for identity of plan and method without examining 
into fitness and adaptability shows a lack of self-knowledge, self-confidence, 
and self-respect. 
Booker Washington in My Larger Education expressed 
himself on this point as follows: 
One of the troubles with negro education at the present time (1910) is 
that there are no definite standards of education among the different
-P-A-G-E-441
  THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 425 
ethools. It is not possible to tell, for instance, from the name of the school 
whether it is teaching the ordinary common school branches, Greek and 
Latin, or carpentry, blacksmithing, and sewing. More than that, there 
is no accepted standard as to the methods or efficiency of the teaching 
in these schools. A student may be getting a mere smattering, not even 
learning sufficient reading and writing to be able to read with comfort a 
book or a newspaper. He may be getting a very good training in one 
subject and almost nothing in some other. A boy entering such a school 
does not know what he is going for, and, nine cases out of ten, he will 
come away without knowing what he got. 
The Phelps-Stokes study, after commenting upon the fact 
that over 75 per cent of the enrollment in the so-called 
academies, colleges, and universities for negroes is to be 
found in the elementary grades, adds: 
Unfortunately, most of the schools with college courses are seriously 
handicapped, not only by inadequate funds but also by the small number 
of pupils prepared to study college subjects. The facts presented in the 
chapter on college and professional education show that only three insti- 
tutions have a student body, a teaching force, and equipment, and an 
income sufficient to warrant the characterization of “college.” Nearly 
half of the college students and practically all the professional students of 
college grade are in these three institutions. Fifteen other institutions 
are offering college courses which represent a wide variation of standards. 
Not more than ten per cent of the pupils in these schools are in college 
classes. 
To the private institutions of the South, limited as their 
equipments have been, and misdirected as their efforts too 
often have been, the colored race is indebted for practically 
everything that it has received in the way of secondary and 
higher instruction. A surprisingly large percentage of their 
graduates have been turned back into the schools as teachers. 
Practically all the trained negro teachers in either public or 
private schools have received their training in these insti- 
tutions. From these schools have come many clean, honest 
workers, and many able leaders. 
A committee appointed in 1900 by the Conference for 
Education in the South reported two years later that some 
of the schools established by sincere but mistaken individuals 
were not only utterly inefficient but ‘‘ positively mischievous”
-P-A-G-E-442
  426 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
in that they persuaded students away from the more de- 
serving institutions. Booker Washington contended in 1912 
that no more private schools should be established and that 
philanthropic contributions should be used to strengthen the 
public schools. A plan for coérdinating the work of philan- 
thropic boards was effected in 1914. The inquiry conducted 
by the Phelps-Stokes Fund into the character of instruction 
offered in the private and higher schools for the colored 
race, published in 1917, has done much to clarify our 
notions as to plans and purposes, and has opened the way 
for a definitely formulated policy for the education of the 
negro. 
Problems of Negro Education 
The questions raised by the various inquiries have led to 
scientific study of the mental capacity of the race. Ever 
since the emancipation of the negro many have entertained 
a doubt as to his ability to profit by schooling. This doubt, 
it must be said, was based upon opinion rather than upon 
facts scientifically derived. During the period which we 
are reviewing a number of psychological studies have been 
made. The main fact that has been deduced by these 
researches is that the negro in the higher mental processes 
is on the whole somewhat inferior to the white race. This is 
not to say, however, that all negroes are inferior in mental 
ability to all white people. On the contrary, it has been 
ascertained that many full-blooded negroes have ability 
surpassing that of the median white man, and that there 
are some negroes of exceptional ability. These facts should 
put at rest the much-protracted discussion as to the advis- 
ability of providing opportunities for higher education of the 
negro. A small percentage of the race can profit by such 
instruction, and for this number opportunities should be 
provided.
-P-A-G-E-443
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO 427 
Educational Values 
A live topic for discussion has been the question of educa- 
tional values. Many who have spoken upon the subject 
have expressed themselves either as favoring or opposing a 
certain form of education — academic instruction, higher 
education, or industrial training. In all such expressions, 
educational values are concerned. In a curriculum social 
efficiency should be the inevitable criterion. Each school 
subject should be weighed to determine the extent to which 
it will function in better living, and those subjects that 
promise to be most fruitful in the later lives of the pupils 
should be given the greatest stress. 
Booker Washington has come nearer than any other 
individual of either the white or negro race to offering a 
scheme of values which proves acceptable to the various 
social elements corfeérned — the Northern philanthropist, 
the negro, and the Southern white man. His scheme is 
based upon the present needs of his race. From his writings 
it may be gathered that he prizes the following social in- 
terests somewhat in the order of their arrangement : 
(1) Economic independence. This is interpreted to mean 
ability to earn a living, to acquire property, and to enlarge 
accordingly the circle of human wants. He makes this item 
fundamental to the other social aims since it leads to better 
health, better morals, and better means of enlarging the 
intellectual horizon. : 
(2) Morality. This is founded upon a religion that 
functions in good living. 
(3) Sociability. Under this head he includes respect for 
the institutions of the white race, its government and 
religion; the establishment of cordial relations between the 
two races; the development of race pride, leading to the 
integrity of the race.  
-P-A-G-E-444
428 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
(4) Health. Including personal hygiene and sanitary 
living conditions. 
Washington does not mention the intellectual or esthetic 
elements. It is understood, however, that the intellectual 
element is considered as a means to the other elements. 
As for the esthetic element, he thinks it is not fundamental, 
and, for the present, should have minor consideration. 
Negro leaders almost without exception accept Washington’s 
values. Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, however, would emphasize 
in the higher institutions the zsthetic element in order that 
the leaders of the race may have access to the broadest 
civilizing influences. Northern and Southern leaders of 
both races have almost reached an agreement upon the basis 
of Washington’s values. 
The success of negro education, in whatever form and to 
whatever extent, depends upon a common agreement among 
the interested parties as to plans and purposes. The policy 
of the larger philanthropic boards in the North to work with 
and for the negroes through the established public agencies 
promises returns that will loom up large in future accounts 
of the education of the negro.

- EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 
Before the Occupation 
When the United States took over Porto Rico as a result 
of the War with Spain, they found a civilization Spanish in 
character, with a very small percentage of well-educated 
people, the masses being poor, ignorant, and illiterate. This 
state of affairs was the result of four hundred years of Spanish 
rule. It cannot be said, however, that there were no schools 
during those four centuries, for there had been some educa- 
tional activity in the island since 1511. The backward educa- 
tional conditions were due to Spanish methods, as conditions 
in Porto Rico were no worse than they were in Spain, where 
even at the present time 65 per cent of the population is 
illiterate. 
A study of those four hundred years of educational ‘‘ac- 
tivity” will reveal many excellent school laws and royal 
decrees and orders concerning education. The backward 
state was not due to lack of good laws, nor even to lack of 
advanced educational thought, but to failure to execute the 
laws or to apply the thought. In fact, it can be safely said 
that laws were frequently written and promulgated, which 
those in authority never intended to be executed. As a 
result, we find that, in practice, there was no definite organi- 
zation of education during the Spanish régime; that what- 
ever educational activity existed was the result of sporadic 
433

attempts here and there by the church, by private societies 
or clubs, by municipalities, by the government, and, above 
all, by private individuals of foresight and philanthropic 
spirit; and that all these attempts lacked a knowledge of 
conditions, of needs, and, therefore, of a definite end or aim. 
When the United States took over Porto Rico, only one 
child out of fifteen of school age attended school. During the 
year ending June, 1899, there were reported 212 town schools 
and 313 rural schools. Excluding some municipalities for 
which the number was not reported, there were 426 rural 
barrios without any school whatever. The enrollment for 
the year was reported as 19,804 boys and 9378 girls, a total 
of 29,182; but only 14,720 boys and 7153 girls, or 21,873 
pupils, were reported to be in actual attendance. The total 
number of children of school age, four to sixteen, who were 
then without school accommodation was reported as 268,630. 
The total expenditure for education was $288,098. 
In 1898, there were two normal schools— one for men and 
one for women — and one public secondary school. All the 
other secondary schools were private. There was not an 
institution of higher learning. Public school teachers were 
poorly prepared in the two normal schools, which required 
merely an elementary school education for admission. The 
teachers worked independently of the system, each admit- 
ting pupils irrespective of age or grade of advancement. 
There were no school buildings that had been constructed 
solely for school purposes. 
Such were the conditions when the United States took 
over Porto Rico and began its work of school organization. 
Problems of the New Government 
The task of establishing a graded American system of 
public instruction in Porto Rico was greater than one would 
imagine. There were many problems to be solved. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 435 
first of these was the reorganization of public education. 
This was not an easy task, for the teachers were not accus- 
tomed to working in an orderly, well-organized system and 
many of them considered directions given by the newcomers 
as dictation on the part of conquerors. The second problem 
to be attacked was the extension and financing of education. 
The school census of 1898 showed that the island had a school 
population of 322,393 (school age five to eighteen) and an 
enrollment of 29,172, or of only about nine per cent of the 
school population. The finances of the island were limited. 
To reach this multitude of school children, provide for the 
increase in population, and finance such a system was a 
tremendous task. 
The third problem requiring immediate attention was that 
of equipment. The total lack of suitable school buildings 
was one of the most conspicuous features of the educational 
weakness of the Spanish régime, and one which impressed 
visitors from the North most unfavorably. Another prob- 
lem which faced the American educators was that of co- 
education. An American people cannot appreciate this 
problem as thoroughly as can a Spaniard or a Latin Ameri- 
can. In America the boys and the girls attend school to- 
gether from the kindergarten to the university, women 
enjoy greater freedom than in any other country of the 
world, and there is no appreciable difference in intellectual, 
social, and moral standards between men and women. But 
when the Americans took possession of the island, they found 
a civilization in which it was thought morally wrong for 
boys and girls to go to school together, where woman by 
tradition was destined to submit herself to the will of 
man, and where there was a very different and marked con- 
trast between the intellectual, social, and moral status of 
men and women. To establish the American coeducational 
system in such a society was to accomplish that which Spain  
-P-A-G-E-452
436 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
and many other parts of Europe have not yet accomplished ; 
it was to step in a day over centuries of traditions, customs, 
and prejudices. 
Perhaps the greatest problem which confronted the Ameri- 
can educators was the adaptation of a standard American 
common school system to a Latin-American people, who were 
mostly of Spanish blood and traditions and whose vernac- 
ular was also Spanish. This problem was made still more 
difficult when the attitude of the people toward manual 
labor and the language question were taken into considera- 
tion. No one can appreciate the seriousness of these prob- 
lems and the difficulties encountered so well as one who 
has lived among the people and who speaks, thinks, and 
feels with them and with the people of the United States 
as well. The new generation of Porto Rico, a bilingual 
people, will be able to appreciate these problems and look 
with admiration at the efforts put forth to approach these 
conditions wisely and will view with sympathy and under- 
standing the many mistakes and failures made. 
The Present System 
The work of school organization was begun and, after an 
investigation of conditions, the school law of 1899 was is- 
sued. This law, however, was not practicable, as it left 
the control and administration of the schools in the hands 
of the respective municipalities, which were not in a posi- 
tion to carry on the administration of the schools. The 
failure of this first move was so evident that on the establish- 
ment of civil government the school system was central- 
ized, and a commissioner of education was given ample 
powers in the administration of the schools. 
To-day the organization, administration, and work of the 
Department of Education of Porto Rico is characterized 
by a high degree of centralization. The public school sys-  
-P-A-G-E-453
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 437 
tem is headed by the Commissioner of Education, who is 
appointed by the President for a term of four years or at 
his pleasure, with full power of appointment over all sub- 
ordinates. The Commissioner is responsible to the Gov- 
ernor, who in turn is responsible to the War Department 
at Washington. Since the insular legislature enacts laws 
to be executed by the Commissioner, he is responsible to 
the legislature, although his tenure of office does not depend 
on that body. By law he is President of the Board of Trus- 
tees of the University of Porto Rico and Chancellor of the 
University. He appoints all his subordinates, and nomina- 
tions made by local officers must have his approval. All 
expenditures for educational purposes, whether for insular, 
municipal, or university funds, are subject to his approval. 
The Commissioner, then, is the pivot around whom revolves 
the whole educational machinery, so that a good commis- 
sioner means a good school system, while a poor and ineffi- 
cient commissioner means a poor and inefficient system of 
schools. 
Elementary Education 
The problem of school extension immediately demanded 
the attention of those intrusted with the organization of 
the schools. The task of providing educational facilities 
for the large number of children was begun. The first two 
years was a period of readjustment and only slight progress 
was made; but with the establishment of civil government 
a larger number of schools were instituted. However, at 
this time the estimated school population was 332,497, while 
the school attendance was only 15 per cent of that number. 
The increase of the school enrollment during the first few 
years of civil government was constant, but the problems of 
finance and adaptation were such that progress was neces- 
sarily slow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
438 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
When Dr. E. G. Dexter became Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, he adopted as the first of his aims, ‘To provide in- 
struction in the branches comprising a common school 
education to all children of school age in the Island, this 
instruction to be both in English and in Spanish.” His suc- 
cessor followed the same policy. The period from 1907 to 
1914 was a period of earnest endeavor on the part of the 
Department of Education to reach the largest possible num- 
ber of children of school age. Double enrollment was re- 
sorted to with the result that in 1914 the average enrollment 
per teacher was eighty-one. The total enrollment of the 
public schools reached as high as 207,101, the largest num- 
ber of children ever enrolled in the public schools of the 
Island. It can be seen readily that under such conditions 
school work could not be thorough and that the program 
of school extension had been carried out at the expense of 
efficiency. Since 1914 the Department has abandoned the 
policy of double enrollment and has placed the emphasis 
on thorough work and adaptation of the system to meet 
insular needs. 
In 1921 the educational situation was as follows: Ac- 
cording to the census of 1920, the insular population was 
1,299,809. The number of children of legal school age was 
438,747, and the number of children of compulsory school 
age was 209,220. The total enrollment in all schools sup- 
ported by public funds was 193,369. Of this number 
119,947 were enrolled in rural schools; 62,126, in elemen- 
tary graded schools; 4364, in secondary schools; 565, in 
the collegiate department of the University of Porto Rico ; 
1040, in the summer session of the University ; 2987, in 
elementary night schools; 158, in night classes for technical 
instruction ; 2018, in special needlework and embroidery 
classes; 39, in rehabilitation service; and 25, in the school 
for the blind. In addition, 6818 pupils attended private  
-P-A-G-E-455
  EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 439 
schools. The total number of different persons who at- 
tended either public or private schools at any time during 
the year was 200,087. The total enrollment in the public 
schools was 43.1 per cent of the total population of school 
age, and 90.3 per cent of the population of compulsory school 
age; but of the 209,787 children of compulsory school age, 
only 138,983, or 66.3 per cent, were enrolled. 
The above data show the great progress that has been 
made in school extension since 1898. They also show how 
much still remains to be done. According to these data, 
57 per cent of the total population of school age is not en- 
rolled in any school whatsoever, and only 33.8 per cent of 
the children of school age are reached. It would seem that 
a large number of children have no opportunity whatsoever 
to secure an education. This information is rather mislead- 
ing. Officially a child is counted of school age as soon as 
he is five years old, and he remains for thirteen years in the 
records of children of school age. During this period, most 
of the children receive a four-year rural school education or 
an eight-year elementary school education. Though they 
appear in the statistical records for a number of years as 
children of school age not attending any school, neverthe- 
less they may have completed the courses which the govern- 
ment is able to offer and may be, therefore, by no means 
destitute of education. 
In spite of the above, the fact remains that Porto Rico 
is not furnishing school facilities for 57 per cent of her school 
population and that 33.8 per cent of her children between 
the ages of eight and fourteen years are out of school. Ever 
since the establishment of the school system, the Island has 
had a compulsory school law. There is also to-day a child- 
labor law providing that no child under fourteen years of 
age who has not received a certificate from the Department 
of Education to the effect that he has finished the work  
-P-A-G-E-456
  
440 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
required of the third grade of the rural or the eighth of the 
graded schools can be employed in any remunerative oc- 
cupation during the hours public schools are in session. 
Such laws have not been, are not, and cannot be enforced 
until the island provides school facilities for at least all her 
children of school age. Thousands of children of compul- 
sory school age are running the streets to-day soliciting at 
every turn places in the public schools, but they have to 
be refused admittance because there is no room for them. 
Although great progress has been made in the extension 
of the school system since 1898, when only 9 per cent of 
the school population attended school as against 43 per cent 
to-day, and when only 4.7 per cent of the total population 
was in school as against 15.6 per cent to-day, yet the exten- 
sion of the public school system so as to reach the largest 
number of school children is still the great problem con- 
fronting the Department of Education. Educational prog- 
ress has been made in the last two decades and a half, but we 
have just begun to educate the masses of the people. 
Secondary Education 
The history of education in Porto Rico shows that, al- 
though elementary education was neglected, provision was 
always made for the education of the few in what may be 
called the secondary schools. History shows that at various 
times attempts were made to establish university courses. 
The idea of secondary education was always popular; not 
so, that of elementary education. It was hard for the edu- 
cated classes to understand that the establishment of ele- 
mentary schools should precede that of secondary schools. 
When Dr. Brumbaugh began to establish the public school 
system, placing the emphasis on the extension of elementary 
education, he met with severe criticism from a few people 
who wished higher institutions of learning to be created 
 
-P-A-G-E-457
  EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 441 
before the elementary work was organized. Dr. Brum- 
baugh answered his critics that the greater duty was to the 
larger number and he pushed the elementary schools to 
the point of complete organization, giving the high school 
work only partial support. Outside of the Insular Normal 
School for the preparation of teachers, no support was given 
at first to collegiate and professional education. 
Secondary education in Porto Rico includes the educa- 
tional training given to those who have completed an eight- 
year elementary course or its equivalent. It is given in 
two styles of schools known as high schools and continuation 
schools. The high school in Porto Rico is the same as the 
traditional high school in the United States — the institu- 
tion offering a four-year course of study beyond the ele- 
mentary school course of eight grades. Continuation 
schools were established in towns which could not support 
a high school. These schools take the pupils upon the com- 
pletion of the elementary school course and carry them, with- 
out the necessity of leaving home, one, two, or three years 
further in their educational career. Thus the continuation 
school originated as an extension of the elementary school 
course and not separate from it. Although emphasis is 
placed on manual training for boys and cooking and sewing 
for girls, yet the continuation schools are far from being 
prevocational and vocational schools, and do not fit the 
students for specific vocations. They are established mainly 
to provide further study beyond the eighth grade. From 
the continuation schools the students may pass on to the 
corresponding year in the regular four-year high school. 
Higher Education 
The one institution offering higher and professional edu- 
cation is the University of Porto Rico. It was established 
by act of the Insular Legislature, approved March 12, 1903.
-P-A-G-E-458
  442 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
At present the University consists of the College of Liberal 
Arts, offering a four-year course beyond the high school and 
leading to the bachelor’s degree either in arts or in sciences ; 
the College of Pharmacy, offering two- and three-year courses 
and leading to the diplomas of Graduate Pharmacist, and 
Pharmaceutical Chemist, respectively ; the College of Law, 
offering a four-year course beyond the high school and lead- 
ing to the degree of Bachelor of Laws; the Normal College, 
offering two courses beyond the high school diploma — one 
of two years, leading to the Normal Diploma, and one of 
four years, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Edu- 
cation. The Normal College also prepares teachers for the 
rural schools by giving a one-year course to students who 
have completed a part of their high school work. The Col- 
lege of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts offers several techni- 
cal courses to high school graduates leading to the degree 
of Bachelor of Science. 
The American Contribution 
The school system of Porto Rico as a whole, from the ele- 
mentary school to the university, is not well equipped with 
buildings, laboratories, or general supplies. When it is re- 
called that there was not a building erected for school pur- 
poses during the four centuries of Spanish rule, and that 
many buildings in use at the present time have been erected 
since 1898, the progress made in supplying suitable buildings 
and equipment may be easily recognized. Some advance- 
ment has been made in recent years in providing proper 
school buildings and facilities for the children of Porto Rico; 
but, as this work has practically just begun, the majority 
of the children are still attending school in inadequate and 
unfit rented buildings. 
A visitor to Porto Rico of twenty-five or thirty years ago, 
returning to-day, would find that amazing changes in the
-P-A-G-E-459
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO 443 
life of the Island had taken place. He would see wealth 
among many different classes. He would find English 
spoken among the younger generation and signs of progress 
at every turn. But if he were to penetrate into all the 
districts of the Island, mix with all classes, and meet 
representatives of her 1,300,000 inhabitants, he would come 
to the conclusion that Porto Rico, as compared with the 
United States, is still an undeveloped country with an un- 
developed civilization. However, if a visit were made not 
only to Porto Rico, but also to Cuba and to other Spanish- 
American republics, and even to Spain, the traveler would 
see many common characteristics in their civilizations; but 
he would also see many differences and contrasts, and the 
most striking of these, as far as Porto Rico is concerned, is the 
improved system of public education. 
Present Needs and Problems 
In spite of these changes in the culture of Porto Rico and 
in spite of the great progress made in public education, 
Porto Rico has lacked and still lacks a definite, specific cul- 
tural aim suited to the particular needs of the Island. The 
schools have been functioning with considerable success, 
but without knowing clearly what they were supposed to 
accomplish. The American public school system was 
brought here and established irrespective of the Island’s 
traditions, environment, and aim for the future. The time 
is ripe to establish and define a goal for the public schools. 
The public school system of Porto Rico should be reor- 
ganized. At the present time, the Island has an elementary 
school of eight years and a high school of four years. Why 
there should be such an organization when the majority 
of the children receive only a four-year elementary school 
education cannot be explained. There is no reason why the 
eight-four plan should exist in Porto Rico, except that it has 
   
-P-A-G-E-460
  
444 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
been the prevalent organization in the United States; though 
even there the reasons for this organization are not clear. 
The present organization was borrowed from the United 
States, transplanted, and imitated, mainly to comply with 
academic requirements which would enable Porto Rican 
pupils completing elementary and secondary education to 
enter the colleges and universities of the United States. In 
other words, the interests and the needs of the masses of 
Porto Rican children have been and are being sacrificed for 
those of a very small number who may want to enter college 
or university. The schools should be reorganized to meet 
existing conditions. 
The important problem still to be solved is that of an 
intelligent adaptation of the American school system and 
ideals to Porto Rican needs. Whatever adaptation has 
been accomplished has been the result either of common 
sense on the part of skillful teachers or of accident, but not 
of scientific investigation. The tendency has been to copy 
and imitate rather than to create. However, of late, these 
problems have been receiving the attention of the educators 
of the Island, and there is no doubt that a new day and a 
more scientific approach await the public school system 
of Porto Rico.

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 
Introduction 
This section will present a rapid survey of the educational 
developments that have taken place in the Philippine Is- 
lands during the quarter-century that has passed since the 
archipelago became an American possession. We shall 
define the educational policies of the American administra- 
tion, and make a brief estimate of the success of each policy. 
The Present Organization 
Soon after the occupation, the American authorities in 
the Islands perceived the necessity of a series of fundamental 
policies to guide the work in the educational field. They 
were confronted by two alternatives; namely, (1) establish- 
ing a policy of centralized control for the sake of rapid prog- 
ress of the schools, and (2) giving ample powers to the 
local authorities for the sake of rapid training in political 
powers. The first alternative was chosen.- Wide powers 
have been given to the highest school official with the re- 
sult that a highly centralized school system has been created. 
The Director of Education, as the head of the school system 
is called, appoints the school superintendents, prepares all 
courses of study, makes contracts for the purchase of books 
and supplies, exercises general supervision over the school 
system, and has extensive powers in the establishment of 
447
-P-A-G-E-464

448 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
new schools, the selection of teachers, and the construction 
of schoolhouses. 
This policy of centralization has worked satisfactorily 
in bringing about an efficiency of management that other- 
wise would have been well-nigh impossible. It has been 
claimed that centralization promotes uniformity in types 
of schools, in courses of study, in textbooks, and in stand- 
ards of school supplies, thus preventing a large amount of 
waste. Perhaps more important is the claim that central- 
ization introduces expert leadership and service. These 
two claims have been amply substantiated in the Philip- 
pines. In other countries centralizing tendencies have 
been checked by the fear of bureaucracy and by the unwill- 
ingness of the people to surrender functions which they 
believe themselves competent to exercise. The first of 
these two objections has not held good in the Philippine 
Islands as regards school affairs, in view of the achieve- 
ments of a centralized administration in creating a modern 
school system in a short period of time. As to the second 
objection, it may be said that as a result of the lack of ex- 
perience on the part of the people in the management of 
school affairs, especially in the early days of the new régime, 
they have not as a rule objected to the present policy of 
centralization. As social progress advances, and as the 
Filipinos add to their training for and experience in han- 
dling their own affairs, it is to be expected and desired that 
the power of local educational authorities will be increased. 
The organization of the school system is a matter in which 
uncertainty has at various times prevailed. The attempt 
has been made to set up an educational ladder of the Ameri- 
can type with adaptations necessitated by local conditions. 
The result has been a 4-3-4 plan of school organization in- 
stead of the American 8-4 plan. In the United States it- 
self the convenience of the 8-4 plan has long been questioned  
-P-A-G-E-465
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 449 
and the 6-3-3 plan advocated on the ground that it ‘not 
only makes better provisions for meeting varying educational 
and social needs, but can be defended as psychologically 
more sound than the 8-4 plan.” The Philippine system 
wisely includes a four-year elementary school followed by 
an intermediate course of three years and a secondary course 
of four years. The system is crowned by a state university 
located at Manila which offers courses on a par with those 
offered in American universities. 
The schools are open to all on a purely democratic basis. 
The fee system in use under the Spanish régime was abolished 
soon after the American occupation. Although with this 
policy of free public schools the educational system has 
grown rapidly, it is yet far from meeting adequately the 
needs of the country. There are now under 21,000 teach- 
ers of all classes of a little over 1,000,000 children. But this 
is only about one third of the school population, now esti- 
mated to be about 3,000,000. 
Other American Policies 
It will be well to discuss now the aims pursued by the 
American administration in setting up the present school 
system. The fundamental aim is the elimination of illit- 
eracy by placing within reach of every child of school age 
the means of obtaining the rudiments of an education. The 
aim of the primary course, an official report states, is to 
give the boy and girl enough English so that they can read 
an ordinary book or newspaper, and gain a reading and writ- 
ing habit. That the schools are gradually solving the prob- 
lem of illiteracy is shown by the census reports. Using the 
term “illiteracy” to mean in the case of the Filipinos inabil- 
ity to read and write in any language — English, Spanish, or 
any local language or dialect — it was found in the census of 
1903 that 55.5 per cent, or more than one half of the popula- 
   
-P-A-G-E-466
    
450 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
tion over ten years of age, could neither read nor write in any 
language or dialect. We must bear in mind, furthermore, 
the fact that of the 44.5 per cent literate, only about one 
out of two was able both to read and write, that in all prob- 
ability less than 10 per cent of the people of the Philip- 
pines could speak English or Spanish, and that therefore the 
majority of those reported as literate could read or write 
only in the native tongues. Fifteen years afterwards, ac- 
cording to the census of 1918, illiteracy had been reduced 
to 50.8 per cent and both English and Spanish were more 
widely used, English being spoken by larger numbers of 
the literate Filipinos than Spanish. 
Difficult as the problem of reducing the appalling illit- 
eracy is, it seems to be exceeded in complexity by the lan- 
guage policy inaugurated by the American administration. 
A unilingual system has been created with English as the 
medium of instruction, the purpose being to make English 
the common language of the Archipelago, to create a ‘“‘bond 
of union for the numerous and more or less distinct language 
groups.’’ There are eight languages in the Islands, each 
of which is used by not less than 500,000 people, and some 
seventy-odd more which are used by smaller groups. English 
has been chosen as the main integrating agency for several 
reasons. The great majority of the Filipinos are ignorant 
of Spanish, and it has been assumed that it will be as easy 
for them to learn English as Spanish. The native languages 
are numerous and diverse, and there is no literature worth 
while in any of them. English, on the other hand, 
is well suited for communication with the outside world 
and practically opens to those who command it the entire 
field of literature. Spanish is not spoken by the adjacent 
countries, while English is the common language of every 
port from Japan to Australia and Suez. Finally, English, 
as the common means of communication, will make for
-P-A-G-E-467
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 451 
efficiency in government and for social solidarity. How- 
ever, the Filipinos are still divided on the language question. 
One of the political parties recently demanded the use of 
Spanish as the official language of the government; while 
others, on the other hand, strenuously advocate the adop- 
tion of English for the same purpose. 
The results of the language policy are thus described by 
the Director of Education in his annual report for 1914: 
To date, progress in securing linguistic unity by spreading a knowledge 
of English has been steady ; but slower than could be wished, because the 
Bureau of Education has never been able to offer instruction to more than 
one half of the total school population during any school year. 
The slow progress of English is well shown by the census 
figures. In 1918 among the literate Filipinos of ten years 
and over there were 511,721 males and 245,742 females who 
spoke Spanish, while there were 569,501 males and 326,757 
females who spoke English. English is advancing but grad- 
ually, and accompanying its advance there has been an 
increased study of Spanish. The latter phenomenon is 
attributed to the great increase and circulation of news- 
papers and periodicals whereby there is now much more 
reading of Spanish than formerly. 
The Curriculum 
The American educators in the Philippines made, in the 
opinion of the writer, a happy selection of point of view for 
the formulation of curricula. In the development of the 
school system they have constantly had in mind the local 
conditions and needs. As already stated, they devised a 
4-3-4 plan of school organization instead of transplanting 
the American 8-4 plan. This organization fits well with 
the threefold policy of academic, vocational, and physical 
education which we shall now discuss in detail. 
The annual report of the Director of Education for 1911
-P-A-G-E-468
452 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
states that the aims of the instruction given in the four- 
year elementary course are 
to enable the pupil to understand, read and write simple English; to give 
him sufficient knowledge of figures so that he can later protect his own 
interests in minor business dealings; and to provide him with a limited 
fund of information on the subjects of geography, sanitation and hygiene, 
government, and standards of right conduct. Furthermore, the course 
aims to give every pupil sufficient training in some manual occupation 
to enable him to better earn a livelihood in later years as a result of having 
attended the public schools. 
This course is the same for all, except for variations in 
industrial work and adaptations to meet the needs of some 
of the more primitive peoples. Since 1909 differentiation 
has begun in the fifth grade, that is, in the first year of the 
intermediate course, and has been continued throughout 
the remaining two intermediate grades. Differentiated 
courses had been offered in the secondary schools since 1904 ; 
but it was decided to give them in the intermediate schools 
for two reasons; namely, the shortness of the period of 
schooling possible for the average pupil and the maturity 
of the boys and girls in the intermediate grades. Pro- 
vision is made for five intermediate courses —a general 
course which leads directly and normally to the high school ; 
a trade course which aims to prepare children to earn a liv- 
ing as artisans; a farming course which engages the pupils 
chiefly in gardening and agricultural work; a course in 
business to prepare for office positions; and a course in 
housekeeping and household arts which gives both theoret- 
ical and practical instruction and training in home making. 
There used to be a course in teaching upon which the Bureau 
of Education largely depended for its new supply of primary 
teachers; but in 1919, with the demand for better trained 
teachers and with more material available from the higher 
grades, the teaching course was eliminated from the inter- 
mediate grades.
-P-A-G-E-469
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 453 
In all these intermediate courses sufficient academic in- 
struction is given to enable their graduates to pursue secondary 
studies successfully. The secondary courses aim definitely 
at the preparation of young men and women for leadership. 
It has been the belief of American educators in the Philip- 
pines that the ordinary course offered in the secondary 
schools of the United States is not well adapted to the needs 
of the Filipinos. Desirable changes have been made, con- 
sisting mainly in reducing the amount of instruction in 
foreign languages and science, in placing more emphasis 
upon spoken and written English, and in introducing a prac- 
tical course in local commercial geography and economic 
conditions. 
Attention has also been given to physical education, “‘so 
planned as to make it possible for all or practically all of 
the pupils enrolled in the public schools to receive physical 
training of some sort.’’ This line of work includes health 
inspection, personal and social sanitation, and such activi- 
ties as marching, calisthenics, dancing, impromptu games, 
and group athletics. 
The boys and girls have received the same kinds of school- 
ing and in the same schools, except that as a rule only boys 
take manual training and agriculture, and only girls take 
cooking and sewing. A marked departure from this policy 
of coeducation was made in 1917, when instructions were 
issued to segregate the boys and girls in the intermediate 
and secondary schools where the numbers attending were 
sufficient to make the plan desirable. The chief purpose 
of this step was to make it easier to carry on the special 
kinds of work prescribed for the different sexes. 
Schools as Social Centers 
Following present-day tendencies the educational authori- 
ties are gradually widening the sphere of public education 
   
-P-A-G-E-470
  
  454 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
so as to bring under the influence of the school not only 
the immature members of society, but also those who 
have reached adulthood. More and more the educational 
plants are being used for civic, educational, and social ac- 
tivities, such as night schools, public lectures, concerts, 
debates, receptions, dances, and athletic meets, meetings 
of parent-teacher associations, literary societies, and various 
kinds of clubs. Dental clinics, school dispensaries, school 
nurses, and other health agencies are as a rule under the 
auspices of the Junior Red Cross. The value of these ac- 
tivities to the people, especially to those living in the rural 
districts, cannot be overestimated. 
School Support 
The school system is at present financed by funds obtained 
(1) from Insular sources through annual appropriations; 
(2) from provincial sources through annual appropriations ; 
(83) from municipal sources through a land tax and through 
internal revenue; and (4) from voluntary contributions. 
In spite of the fact that the provisions made for the support 
of public education have been comparatively liberal, they 
have not been sufficient to meet the educational needs of the 
people and to avoid many of the shortcomings already 
pointed out. Lack of adequate financial support is evi- 
denced by the fact that during the period from 1908 to 1916 
the average daily attendance increased 72 per cent, whereas 
school expenditures increased only 15 per cent. In the 
United States from 1877 to 1912 daily attendance increased 
149 per cent while school expenditures increased 570 per 
cent. 
Teachers and Equipment 
The development of the school system has also been hin- 
dered by the lack of professional training of the majority
-P-A-G-E-471
SO Ce ee ee ee ee ee eee 
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 455 
of the teachers. Indeed the teaching corps has been created 
almost in toto under the new régime; but because of the 
rapid growth of the school system most of the teachers have 
received their training, pitifully meager all too often, after 
entering the service. The training agencies include normal 
schools, secondary schools, summer normal institutes, dis- 
trict. institutes, teachers’ meetings, reading courses, and 
supervision. 
A third handicap that has prevented a larger measure 
of efficiency in the educational work has been the lack of 
adequate school buildings. The government authorities 
soon after the occupation began to take steps to remedy 
this deficiency. The school-building policy has not been, 
and rightly so, a definite policy. It has changed in accord- 
ance with the dictates of experience and with altered cir- 
cumstances, particularly as regards the sources of the money 
used. Both Insular and local funds have been expended 
to erect schoolhouses. It is a significant fact that the first 
act passed by the Philippine Assembly and the Philippine 
Legislature was Act No. 1801, known as the “Gabaldon 
Act”’ and approved in 1908, which appropriated the sum of 
one million pesos for the construction of school buildings 
in the barrios, or outlying hamlets. Three years later a 
second act was passed appropriating another million pesos 
for the same purpose. Since the members of the then newly 
formed Philippine Assembly were all elected by direct vote 
of the people, these two laws showed popular confidence in 
and gave great moral support to the school system. 
In the matter of school-building construction, many errors 
were made at first. For example, in the first buildings con- 
structed there were faults in their adaptation to conditions 
in a tropical climate and to the particular conditions of the 
sites in which they were put up. In all these particulars 
there has been a large measure of improvement, and now   
 
-P-A-G-E-472

all over the Islands the Filipinos point with pride to their 
modern and beautiful school buildings. 
Publicity 
A practice of the American school authorities which has 
produced far-reaching effects is that of keeping the people 
well informed, through various channels of publicity, in 
regard to educational projects and results. In this way 
coéperation and favorable popular sentiment for the schools 
have been secured. There was at first a great deal of apathy 
and ignorance to overcome, mainly due to the unfavorable 
social, political, and economic conditions which prevailed 
in the early days of the new régime. But the impetus 
with which the educational work was assumed, the public- 
ity which it received, and the results soon obtained could 
not but impress upon the people the earnestness of the new 
administration in the solution of the existing educational 
problems. A recent report — the Wood-Forbes Report — 
commenting on the attitude of the Filipinos towards edu- 
cation says: 
Their support and aid in the building up of public education is beyond 
praise. They have sacrificed much that their children might be able to 
go to school, and the interests of an entire family are often subordinated 
to sending the selected member to a higher school or university. 
Results 
Such a spirit has made possible the educational progress 
that is sketched in the preceding pages. We have seen 
that a well-organized school system has been set up, the 
most conspicuous feature of which is a unilingual policy 
intended to meet urgent and permanent needs. Curricula 
have been devised which in various ways take into account 
the local needs of the people. The schools are free and 
open to all, and are fast removing the blot of illiteracy. 
They are constantly extending their sphere of influence,
-P-A-G-E-473
SR RE ee nn ee ree ale et 
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 457 
and the best provisions possible under the circumstances 
have been made in the matters of financial support, training 
of teachers, and construction of school buildings. In a 
quarter-century, and through the concerted efforts of Amer- 
icans and Filipinos, a modern school system has been estab- 
lished in a country of 3000 islands and 11,000,000 people.

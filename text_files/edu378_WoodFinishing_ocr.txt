PREFACE 
+ HE aim in writing this book has been to put before 
teachers, students, and amateur workers reliable 
information regarding the most common processes of 
wood-finishing, and to present this information in a 
practical, non-technical manner, suitable for the aver- 
age school shop. An attempt has been made to put the 
-maximum amount of information regarding the subject 
of wood-finishing into as few pages as possible without 
sacrificing clearness. The plan has been to take this 
information out of the catalog and reference book 
class, and to make of it a volume which every one can 
read understandingly. While the book has been writ- 
ten primarily for schools and colleges, it should find a 
most serviceable place in the home and shop. Further- 
more, the purpose has been to widen the scope of the 
student’s knowledge of what is beautiful as well as 
useful, and to take him gradually beyond the ‘‘mud 
and varnish”’ stage of craftsmanship by placing before 
him suggestions for something better, thus creating a 
new standard for the judgment of his own product as 
well as that of others. 
The chief difficulty in writing a text of this kind lies 
not so much in what to include as in what to exclude. 
No book, except an encyclopedia on the subject, could 
be complete, and such a work would be of little use to 
the student. From the enormous fund of information 
available, selection has been made only of those for- 
mulas and suggestions which were thought to be most 
serviceable and valuable to the reader.

  4 PREFACE 
Wood-finishing is properly a fine art. It belongs 
to that better conception of manual arts which has as 
its aim the creation of something beautiful as well as 
something practical. Too often, I believe, this former 
ideal has been neglected in the shops of our schools, 
and yet it remains the chief satisfaction of people in 
school and out of it. 
In offering this book to students and teachers, I 
wish to express my indebtedness and gratitude to 
Professor Clark L. Jackson, of The Kansas State 
Teachers’ College of Emporia, for his kind assistance 
in the various processes of preparing the manuscript 
for publication; and to Professor EH. A. Johnson of 
Bradley Polytechnic Institute, for reading the manu- 
script. The author wishes to acknowledge, also, the co- 
operation of The Mahogany Association, and The 
American Walnut Manufacturers’ Association, in per- 
mitting the use of some of the photographs contained 
in the book.

CHAPTER I 
Preparinac THE Woop For FINISHING 
1. The Value of Good Finishing.—Too often we find 
a well-constructed piece of work poorly finished. In- 
deed this is the most common evidence of amateur 
work. Students, as a rule, seem to think that the prime 
necessity for a good product is costly lumber, and that 
the piece is finished when they have completed the 
construction of it. With this idea in mind they often 
spend a great deal of time making their project and 
hurry over the finishing of it in a careless manner. 
Students should learn that it is not so much the kind 
of wood used in a piece of work that determines its 
value, as it is the honest construction and careful fin- 
ishing of it. An extremely expensive article may be 
made of very common material, while in some articles 
mahogany, walnut, or even more valuable woods, 
may be almost worthless. Do not consider your work 
completed until you have achieved an appropriate and 
artistic finish. Beautiful wood is, of course, desirable, 
but it is never the chief source of value of a piece of 
furniture. 
2. Preparing the Surface for Finishing.—The first 
step in finishing wood is to make a smooth surface. 
The work must be gone over and all spots and grease 
marks removed. Grease spots or discoloration may 
be taken out usually by rubbing the surface with a 
cloth or sponge dipped in benzine. Excess glue may 
be removed with sandpaper or a scraper, care being 
9
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 WOOD-FINISHING 
taken not to injure the surface of the wood. If glue 
has been spilled on the work it must be removed not 
only fiom the surface but also from the pores of the 
wood. Glue acts as a filler and prevents the stain and 
the subsequent filler from entering the wood. It may 
be taken out of the wood by applications of a cloth 
which has been wrung out of boiling water. 
3. Restoring Dented Surface in Wood.—Ordinary 
dents in wood may be removed in the following man- 
ner: Wring a piece of muslin, or some such cloth, 
out of water, lay a couple of thicknesses of it over the 
dent to be removed, and apply to it a hot pressing iron 
or piece of heated metal, so that the steam will enter 
the wood. Repeat this process until the dent is re- 
moved; sandpaper the part that has been moistened. 
The surface will be restored. 
4. Filling Holes—If.a piece of wood has been 
broken from the surface the hole may be filled in one of 
the following ways: 2 
1) Incase the hole is large, the only practicable way 
to fill it is to insert a piece of wood to match that of 
the rest of the work. If, however, there is only a small 
erack or hole to be filled, no difficulty will be had in 
using any of the following methods: 
2) Mix some fine sawdust from the wood you are 
using into a thick paste with ordinary glue and {iil the 
hole or crack, being careful not to allow the glue to 
spread over the wood which surrounds the hole. 
3) For filling cracks in hardwood, mix together one 
part of cornstarch and one part of wheat flour. Add 
to this one part of linseed oil with one part of japan 
drier. This will take any stain which you may apply

11
-P-A-G-E-12
12 WOOD-FINISHING 
to the wood. If the work to be filled has already been 
stained, match the color by adding a correct amount 
of oil stain. 
4) Melt together in a pot one part of beeswax, one 
part of powdered resin, and twelve parts of orange 
or white shellac. Be sure not to allow this mixture to 
be heated to the boiling point or it will be rendered too 
brittle for use. This may now be used asa base with 
which to form any color you may wish. <As it will not 
take a stain that is applied to the wood, the best 
method to obtain a good result is to stain the wood the 
color you wish it; apply a coat of shellac to bring out 
the color; then mix with the wax (by melting it again) 
sufficient color to match that of the wood, and fill the 
holes, pressing the wax into them with a putty knife 
and smoothing off the surface. It is well to color only 
enough of this beeswax, resin, and shellac base each 
time to fill the work in hand. The following pigments 
may be used to obtain the ordinary colors: 
Cotor DESIRED Pigments Usep 
Light brown........ Burnt umber and yellow ochre, equal parts. 
Medium brown..... Burnt umber. 
Dark brown’ * itu Burnt umber and lamp-black. 
High tarediss shave cst ic Venetian red and yellow ochre.

MSIACKS hassel bapejciaele Lamp-black. 
Analine dyes which are soluble in alcohol (there are 
other kinds of these dyes which are soluble in water 
and oil) may be used if other colors are desired. 
The best way to apply this wax is to roll it into a con- 
venient stock form and use like sealing-wax. It is the

  PREPARING THE WOOD 13 
best crack and hole filler for cabinet work, and the 
student will experience little trouble in using it if a 
quantity of the base (without coloring) is made up 
ready for use. 
5. Sandpapering.—When the surface has been lev- 
eled off and all holes have been filled, the work is ready 
for a final smoothing. This is usually the part of the 
process of finishing where amateur work is apparent. 
A student is ordinarily too anxious to complete his 
work, and hurries over the smoothing of it thinking 
that this will have but little effect upon the final result. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole 
final appearance of the piece is dependent upon this 
part of the process. If the sandpapering is half done— 
as it usually is,—no amount of care in the application 
of the stain or varnish or polish will make a satisfac- 
tory finish. The reason for this is that unless the sur- 
face is as smooth as it can be made the rougher parts 
of it will absorb more stain and filler than the smoother 
and consequently will show darker. No amount of 
matching will make the work so satisfactory as it 
would have been had it been properly smoothed in 
time. Remember that it is not worth while to begin 
a piece of work if you do not intend to spend a proper 
amount of time in finishing it. Of the many processes 
involved in converting lumber to furniture the longest 
and most important is the finishing. 
If the surface is plane, you may remove any slight 
unevenness with a very sharp scraper. It should then 
be rubbed down with No. 1 sandpaper, and finally with 
No. 0 paper. This must always be done in the direc- 
tion of the grain, except when working on the ends of
-P-A-G-E-14
14 WOOD-FINISHING 
wood. Should you rub across the fibers, the sand- 
paper will invariably cut small lines in the wood. 
These may not show until the stain or filler is applied, 
but they will become apparent in some part of the 
finishing process. Be careful, too, not to round off 
unduly the corners or arrises as is usually done in 
amateur work. The best manner in which to use sand- 
paper is to prepare a small block (3’x5” is a convenient 
size), and tack a couple of layers of heavy cloth to the 
sides so that the face of the block is covered to form 
a pad between the sandpaper and the block. This will 
distribute the abrading force of the paper evenly over 
the wood. Brush the work off well and look carefully 
to see that there are no rough parts before beginning 
the staining. 
6. If a Water Stain Is to Be Applied.—The wood 
needs special treatment if a water stain is to be ap- 
plied. First, sponge the surface liberally with luke- 
warm water and allow it to dry. It will then be seen 
that a considerable amount of ‘‘fuzziness’’ has risen. 
This must be sanded down with No. 0 or No. 1 sand- 
paper, in the manner described previously. Now apply 
the stain hot with a brush and allow it to dry. If the 
color is not sufficiently dark apply another coat of stain. 
Allow this to dry. Again a slight fuzziness will 
be noticed, not so much, of course, as before. Now 
apply a coat of very thin shellac (6 oz. gum shellac to a 
quart of aleohol). This shellac, when it dries, stiffens 
the fine fibres of the wood which have risen to cause 
this fuzziness, and the work may now be rubbed down 
to a beautiful surface with No. 0 sandpaper. This 
may seem to the student a long way to obtain results,
-P-A-G-E-15
  PREPARING THE WOOD 15 
because he has thought of finishing as the short and 
quick part of the process. The next time you admire 
the beauty of the finish on an expensive piano, remem- 
ber that this instrument has been in the finishing room 
of the factory for at least three months.

CHAPTER IT 
STAINING 
7. The Purpose of Staining.—After all the surfaces 
have thus been prepared, the work is ready for stain- 
ing. The student should know the purposes of stain- 
ing, what kinds of stain he may use, the appropriate- 
ness of the color to the wood, and the results he may 
expect. 
The purposes of staining are to produce a soft and 
agreeable color; to match the various shades of the 
wood; to harmonize the work, in the way of color, with 
other furniture; and to bring out in varying degrees 
of depth the natural beauty of the wood which may in 
its unfinished state be raw and unpleasing to the eye. 
e may easily be convinced of the value of artificial 
coloring in beautifying wood by comparing the soft- 
ness of some of the rich browns and reds with the 
obtrusiveness of the so-called natural wood finishes. 
Staining does not make a piece of wood artificial. It 
merely brings out the hidden beauty of the wood, and 
in many instances adds to the natural color which we 
have thought typical of it. Oak seems to us most appro- 
priately colored in different shades of brown, ma- 
hogany in various hues of dark red and dark brown. 
Whenever possible it is well thus to adapt our color 
to the typical shade of the wood. We shall then avoid 
such a monstrosity as mahogany-colored oak, which I 
once saw, or dark-red walnut. Where the prevailing 
_ tone of the wood is white, as in maple, poplar, and

-P-A-G-E-18
18 WOOD-FINISHING 
willow, we must adapt our color to the needs of the 
piece. 
8. Matching the Color of Woods.—Very often there 
is a great variation in the colors of different parts of 
the wood in hand. A piece of white oak may have 
been placed beside a piece of red oak, or a piece of 
African mahogany against one of Spanish mahogany. 
Again there is usually some sap wood of a lighter 
color and a more porous texture in a piece of work. 
Artistic treatment is required to make even the color. 
The easiest methods to follow in matching these col- 
ors are as follows: 
To match light and dark colored oak, apply one coat 
of the stain you are using to the light part with a 
small brush, being careful not to stain over the edges 
of the light portion and into the dark. Allow this 
to dry and then cover the whole piece with a coat of 
the stain. Remember that the more porous the piece 
of wood -the darker will it become under the stain in 
consequence of its greater absorbing power. 
The sapwood in walnut is much more porous than 
that of the heartwood. A coat of strong coffee or water 
stain to which is added about a fifth of hot vinegar will 
often darken the light part sufficiently. The vinegar 
is necessary to help the stain to ‘‘bite’’ into the wood, 
and to keep it from fading. : 
Frequently we find pieces of beautifully striped 
mahogany used with plain wood, especially in large 
surfaces like table tops. This is not difficult to remedy. 
Apply a coat of stain to the whole piece. Before this 
is dry (wait only a few minutes) take a slightly darker 
stain or one that is somewhat stronger, and with a
-P-A-G-E-19
    
STAINING 19 
small, soft brush imitate the stripes of the wood to be 
matched in the plain wood. If this is done carefully 
only an expert will be able to distinguish the two. 
The second application will feather itself into the moist 
first coat and no line of demarcation will be seen. 
Birch, poplar, and white maple may be matched with 
  
    
  ic. 3. Exceptionally fine specimen of bird’seye walnut from a burl. 
mahogany in the same manner. Give the light wood - 
one or two coats of your stain, allow this to dry, and 
then coat the whole piece. 
Sometimes you will be unable to match woods in this 
way. The curls in maple, mahogany, or redwood may 
not be imitated with stain alone. But the process really 
belongs to polishing and will be treated under that 
heading. 
9. Bleaching—There are often dark spots in wood 
that is to be finished light. These may generally be  
-P-A-G-E-20
20 WOOD-FINISHING 
removed by applying a solution of oxalic acid (2 oz. 
to a pint of water) hot to the dark portion. Repeat 
this process until the wood has assumed the right color, 
and then wash the parts with hot water to stop the 
action of the acid. Ozalic acid is very poisonous. Be 
careful in using it, and above all make the solution in a 
porcelain dish. 
10. .Darkening.—Darkening wood may be accom- 
plished in many ways, the principal of these being the 
application of stain. Linseed oil (preferably raw oil 
in this ease) has a beautiful darkening effect if it is 
applied directly to the wood. This is usually used, 
however, upon dark woods such as walnut and ma- 
hogany. Oil seems to bring out the beauty of the wood 
and darken it in a manner that nothing else will do. 
Its application is very simple. Merely rub the surface 
of the wood with a cloth dipped in warm linseed oil. 
Allow this several hours in which to soak into the 
wood, and then remove any excess grease or sediment 
with a cloth moistened in alcohol. The use of alcohol 
on the cloth is especially necessary if a varnish finish 
is to be applied. No other stain is usually added if oil 
is used, but the oil may be colored tc suit the taste 
with a little oil stain. Wax finishing is particularly 
well adapted to this kind of work. Do not use a great 
quantity of oil on the cloth. Do not attempt to use 
a water stain after oil is applied. 
11. Staining End Grain of Wood.—It is in this par- 
ticular that slipshod work may be noticed easily. 
The ends of wood should be smoothed as carefully as 
the face surfaces. Remember that this part of the 
wood will absorb color and filling much more readily

Fic. 4. Walnut burl over Washington’s Tomb. Tree

-P-A-G-E-22
  22 WOOD-FINISHING 
than the side grain. It is therefore necessary to use 
a stain of only half the strength that is used on the 
face side and edges in coloring the ends of the wood. 
It is much better to use several lighter colored coats 
than to make a single dark application do. The color 
will be much more evenly distributed, and a more accu- 
rate color will be obtained. 
12. Stains—While it is true that the most satisfac- 
tory stains may be bought in quantity from any paint 
shop, it will doubtless be well to explain the natures 
of the different kinds of them, and even to suggest 
recipes for making some of them if it is necessary. 
Stains may be classified, in general, under six heads: 
(1) water, (2) spirit, (3) chemical, (4) oil, (5) wax, 
and (6) varnish. These names denote the mediums 
with which the colors are severally compounded. Some 
experts prefer one kind, and some another. It is safe 
to say that water and oil stains are most commonly 
used. Do not infer from this statement that these 
classes of stains are necessarily the most satisfactory 
for every kind of work. Each seems to have its par- 
ticular purposes for which it is best adapted. 
13. Water Stains.—These stains may be purchased 
in powder form, and indeed the amateur is advised 
to buy his stains. They will probably be much more 
satisfactory than those which he would make. To this 
class of stains belong one kind of analine dyes (the 
kind that is soluble in water), vegetable coloring of all 
kinds, indigo, logwood, barks of trees, and berries. Of 
these the analine dyes are best, because they do not 
have such a tendency to fade as do the vegetable col- 
ors. They also penetrate the wood very deeply—which
-P-A-G-E-23
  STAINING 23 
is a desirable quality—and seem by the nature of their 
medium (water) better adapted to most classes of 
work than any other stain. Water stains should be 
applied hot to the wood with a brush. Speed in appli- 
cation is also necessary if an even color is to be had. 
It is well to’ cover the hands with vaseline if much 
staining or cleaning is to be done. This will keep the 
stain from discoloring them. 
On the other hand there is one objection to a water 
stain. It always raises the grain of the wood to some 
extent. This may be remedied in the manner that has 
already been explained. If a water stain is to be ap- 
plied, always sponge and rub down the piece of work 
before using the stain. This will minimize the effects 
of the rising grain, and will present a porous surface 
for the stain to soak into. 
Never apply a large quantity of any stain at one 
time. You may discover whether or not you are using 
too much by allowing a few days for the stain to soak 
into the wood. If upon examination you find tiny rings 
of coloring around the coarser pores it means that 
your work is sweating because of the gases which have 
formed in the pores, and which have forced the stain 
out upon the surface. Exudation of this kind must be 
cleaned off with a rag or brush dipped in aleohol. The © 
work should then be allowed to dry for a week, and 
then inspected for a similar fault. If no further action 
has taken place, thé piece may be matched using as 
little stain as necessary. If, however, a further sweat- 
ing has begun you will do well to clean the piece en- 
tirely and restain it. ‘

in three quarts of boiling water. 
Or, for the reddish brown color, mix together ma- 
hogany red and mahogany brown—commercial water 
stain powders—in the proportions of six of the red to 
four of the brown. Dissolve two ounces of this mix- 
ture in one quart of boiling water. (The wood should 
first be sponged off with a solution of a teaspoonful of 
Lewis’ lye dissolved in a quart of boiling water, and 
allowed to dry, then sanded lightly to smooth the sur- 
face. The stain may then be applied, and, after it has 
dried, treated in the manner that has been suggested.) 
Walnut. Mix together equal parts of burnt umber 
and Vandyke brown and make a thin paste by adding 
liquid ammonia. This mixture will not last well on 
account of the extreme volatility of the ammonia. 
When it is used thin this paste to a watery consistency 
with water. Be careful not to bring the ammonia into 
contact with heat. Apply with a brush and treat as 
has been suggested. 
Ebony. The best ebony stain may be prepared as 
follows: Place in a metal dish one-half pound of log- 
wood and three quarts of water. Allow this to boil 
until the compound has evaporated to about half its 
original amounts. Now add about a cupful of walnut 
peeling. Let this mixture boil for several hours and 
then add a pint of boiling-hot vinegar. If the work is 
in small pieces the best result may be had by dipping 
it in the stain. If not, apply several good flowing coats, 
one after the other and before each preceding coat is
-P-A-G-E-25
  STAINING 25 
dry. The stain will penetrate much more deeply if it 
is applied in this manner. Allow the work to dry a 
little (not completely), and apply two coats of a solu- 
tion made by dissolving one-half ounce of green cop- 
peras (green vitriol) in a pint of boiling water. This 
will give a rich black color to poplar, apple, cherry, or 
pear wood. If a small piece of wood is to be ebonized 
dip it into the solutions. Do not attempt to ebonize 
woods of a resinous nature such as pine and fir. A 
fine-grained, non-resinous, hard wood is most satisfac- 
tory. White maple may be used if apple, cherry, or 
pear are not to be had. 
In place of the above recipe, black India ink may be 
used, but it will not give so satisfactory results as the 
stain described. 
15. General Directions for Water Staining —Water 
stains should, whenever possible, be applied hot with 
a brush. The brush must not be dripping wet, but 
merely contain enough stain to flow over the work 
easily. Work rapidly if you expect to get an even 
color. Be careful not to allow the stain to run over 
the ends of your work. The stain which is applied to 
end grain must not be more than half the strength of 
that which is applied to the face and edges. In water 
staining it is always a good thing to add about one 
part of boiling vinegar to seven or eight parts of the 
stain. Match up the colors of your wood carefully. If 
you are in doubt as to the final color of your stain, test 
it on a well-prepared block of wood similar to that 
which you are using. Treat this piece in exactly the 
same manner as you intend to treat your work, finish- 
ing it with equal care, otherwise your time spent in 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 WOOD-FINISHING 
testing is wasted. Do not be discouraged at the dirty 
appearance that most woods have just after the stain 
isdry. It will lighten up wonderfully under the polish. 
16. Spirit Stains —These stains penetrate well and 
give quite a brilliant color. They also dry more 
quickly than water stains, and much more quickly than 
oil stains. Excellent results may be had with them, 
but they have several disadvantages. _ In the first place, 
it is more difficult to obtain an even color with them 
than with water stains, because they dry so quickly. 
The colors are often a little too metallic to be suitable , 
for wood, and they frequently fade out under light. 
However in cases where water stains cannot be used, 
such as over any surface that has been oiled to darken 
it, or over a surface that has at one time been filled; 
or polished, these stains are quite serviceable. In gen- 
eral, spirit stains are used for quick work, for tapid 
matching, and for renewing broken or abraded sur- 
faces. Their use is not recommended for beginners. 
17. Composition of Spirit Stains—Any color that — 
is soluble in alcohol will make a spirit stain. One kind 
of analine dyes—the kind that is soluble in alcohol as 
distinguished from those which are soluble in oil and 
water—may be used with good results. For particular 
work, if you wish to use these stains, you will/to well 
to buy them ready for use. } 
18. Applying Spirit Stains.—Spirit stains may be’ J 
applied with a cloth or with a brush, preferably the so 
latter. The deeper effect will be had if the stain is 
applied with a brush and allowed to penetrate as 
deeply as it will. Very often, in order to bring out the 
‘‘fioure’? of the wood more prominently, the stain,
-P-A-G-E-27
  STAINING 27 
after being allowed to remain on the surface for a short 
time, is wiped off with an absorbent cloth.. This tends 
to brighten the ‘‘highlights’’ on figured wood. Many 
different kinds of mottling and streaking may be made 
at this time. Light and dark bars as are seen in 
mahogany may be imitated at this time in the manner 
described under matching the color of woods (see See. 
8), or may be accomplished as directed in the follow- 
ing paragraph. 
19. Matching Birch and Mahogany.—Suppose that 
a piece of birch is to be finished to imitate mahogany. 
First, give the whole piece a coat of stain of the shade 
which the lightest portions of the work will be when 
it is finished. Then cover the streaks which are to 
remain light (taking a piece of mahogany as our 
sample) with a coat or two of thin shellac. After the 
shellac has dried apply another coat or two of the 
same stain. This will darken the parts which are not 
covered with shellac. Successive blocking out of por- 
tions of the wood with shellac, and treating the exposed 
parts with different strengths of stain will give almost 
any desired effect. When the staining is completed, 
wipe off the shellac with alcohol and give the whole 
piece ene or two thin coats of shellac with a brush. 
Allow this an hour or two to harden, and then rub down 
lightly with sandpaper (No. 0 or 00). The work may 
then be filled and polished. The only difficulty that the 
student may have in doing this work’is that he may use 
too heavy a coating of shellac, and as a result the filler 
will not enter the grain or adhere to the wood. Six 
ounces of gum shellac to a quart of alcohol is a suffi- 
cient compound to use. Even with this amount of
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 WOOD-FINISHING 
shellac used the student will do well to fill the wood 
with a mixture of French polish and colored silica, a 
process that is described under Sec. 81. An oil or 
water stain may be used instead of the spirit stain 
if the student finds that the alcohol of the spirit 
stain softens the shellac coating which he has applied 
to protect the lighter parts of the work. If difficulty 
is encountered, it is probable that the stain has been 
brushed over the shellae too much, or that the shellae 
has not been allowed to dry well after the spirit stain 
has been applied. 
20. Oil Stains—These stains may be prepared by 
mixing colors that will dissolve in linseed oil or turpen- 
tine with these as bases. Umbers, sienna, analine dyes 
(the kind that is soluble in oil), alkaline dyes, and all 
other pigments that are ground in oil. The oil stains 
are quite easily prepared, and in many respects are 
excellent for student use, altho they do not have the 
popularity of the water stains on account of their slow- 
drying qualities, and on account of the fact that they 
often leave a muddied appearance on the wood, and 
seldom, if ever, give that desirable clearness of the 
water stains. Oil stains, too, donot penetrate the wood 
as spirit or water stains do, and they seem to fade quite 
easily. Oil stains do not, of course, raise the grain 
of wood, and so they, like spirit stains, need not be 
preceded by sponging and sandpapering. 
The oil itself in these stains always darkens wood 
appreciably. A very simple manner of bringing out 
the figure of expensive woods is to’ apply a coat of 
oil stain, allow it to penetrate the wood for a short 
time and then wipe off, with the corner of a piece of
-P-A-G-E-29
  
STAINING 29 
cloth, the parts that you wish to remain a lighter color. 
This. will intensify the streaks of mahogany or the 
wavy bars of curley maple or redwood. The only 
thing to be guarded against in this process is the line 
of demarcation that may result between the light and 
dark parts. The dark should be shaded into the light 
by careful work with the cloth. 
21. Applying Oil Stains.—Oil stains like others are 
applied directly to the wood with a brush. Do not 
attempt to use an oil stain over a surface that has been 
at any time filled. It will not enter the pores of the 
wood, but will merely remain on the surface to be 
brushed up in patches with the varnish or polish. Oil 
stain on new wood should be allowed a considerable 
length of time to dry into the wood. Any excess may 
then be removed with a cloth. If the finish to be ap- 
plied is varnish it is well to remove any greasiness 
that may remain on the surface with a cloth moistened 
with alcohol. This will allow the varnish to ‘‘take 
hold’? of the wood better. The oil in this kind of stain 
has a particularly pleasing effect upon dark hardwoods 
such as oak, walnut, and mahogany. Be sure that the 
surface of your wood is entirely free from any rough- 
ness or the abraded parts will be muddy and will give 
a very displeasing result. 
22. Wax Stains.—These stains are the simplest to 
make and to apply. All that is necessary for a satis- 
factory finish may be summed up ina few words. Melt 
together one part of beeswax, eight or ten parts of 
turpentine (this may be reduced to five or six parts if 
the wood is, like oak, very open-grained), and sufficient 
oil-coloring or oil stain to make the desired color. Use
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 fi WOOD-FINISHING 
a strong mixture of the coloring or it will not show 
upon, the wood. This melted compound is applied. hot 
to the wood with a stiff brush, and allowed to harden. 
It is then brushed first across the grain and then with 
the grain with another brush (an old clothes-brush 
will do), until a polish appears. Successive coats may 
be applied in this manner, each brushed into the wood, 
until a desired depth of color is obtained. Strictly 
speaking this is not a stain, as it does not enter into the 
wood. This form of combined stain and polish is used 
most frequently upon oak, mahogany, and walnut, al- 
tho its use is not restricted to these woods. Many of 
the close-grained dark woods take on beautiful effects 
under it. 
23. Chemical Stains.—These stains are composed of 
chemicals and rely, for their effect, upon certain chemi- 
cals in the wood which axe-changed. This change differs 
with different woods. Because a certain chemical stain 
gives a brown color upon a piece of oak, that does not 
mean that it will have the same effect upon a piece of 
ash, or indeed, upon another piece of oak. Color, in 
general in applying these stains, depends upon the 
amount of tannic acid in the wood. This differs in 
woods and in parts of wood. The stains are used in 
two ways: they are either applied directly to the wood 
like other stains, or allowed to fume the wood. Am- 
monia, nitric acid, potassium bichromate, acetate of 
iron, acetic acid, sulphate of iron, Roman vitriol, and 
many other chemicals are used in this process. Chemi- 
cal staining has certain advantages over all other 
staining. It is inexpensive, it is penetrating and dark- 
ening, and it adds that most desirable appearance,
-P-A-G-E-31
STAINING 31 
“‘age,’’? to certain woods. It has also certain dis- 
advantages. It raises the grain of wood much like a 
water staining, and one can never be absolutely sure 
of the result he will achieve until he has tried it on his 
wood. Chemical staining has become very popular, and 
it justly deserves to be so. Every student should 
finish some pieces in this way in order that he may 
become thoroly familiar with a few processes of it. 
A few common chemical stains are given here, while 
others will be given in Chapter XI. 
24. Formulas for Chemical Stains—Mahogany. A 
good darkening stain for mahogany may be prepared 
by dissolving one ounce of bichromate of potash in two 
quarts of water. This will give a dark brown color. 
If you wish to preserve the reddish cast of the wood, 
use one ounce of good mahogany water stain powder 
with the ounce of potassium bichromate. Apply the 
stain hot with a brush. Potassium bichromate stain 
should be allowed to dry in a well-lighted room just 
out of the direct rays of the sun. 
Oak. The above stain without the mahogany water 
stain will make a beautiful nut brown if it is applied to 
oak. If a lighter color is desired make a solution of 
two ounces of American potash and two ounces of pearl 
ash dissolved in a quart of water. 
Walnut. The bichromate of potash stain has a 
pleasing effect upon walnut. 
25. Fuming.—This process really comes under the 
head of chemical staining, and so will be considered 
here. Fuming applies, in general, to the treatment 
of oak to give varying effects of brown to the wood. 
It is sometimes used on other woods, but for the stu-
-P-A-G-E-32
32 WOOD-FINISHING 
dent’s use we need only treat it with regard to that 
wood. 
Fuming wood means subjecting the wood to the 
fumes of ammonia. This method of treating cabinet 
work and wood work is quite old and of recent years 
has come more and more into demand. It has every 
advantage over any other treatment of oak without 
any disadvantage. It is penetrating, so much indeed 
that the surface of the wood may be rubbed quite a 
while with sandpaper before the unfumed surface is 
produced. It does not fade, and, even more, age only 
serves to darken and beautify the result. It is particu- 
larly well adapted to the treatment of oak, for it seems 
to bring out in varying shades of brown the rugged 
quality of this wood that has made its history. Who 
can help feeling a certain amount of revulsion when 
he sees a suite of golden oak furniture, with its sleek 
shining pasty surface? To all who realize the story 
of this wood such a finish is almost a desecration, the 
cheapest, the most inartistic, of all wood finishes. Be- 
sides this, who does not note the quiet beauty and 
unobtrusiveness of Jacobean and of fumed oak? 
Such furniture seems to fit into a room, to reflect the 
charaéter of the home and of the people who make it. 
We do not yet correctly estimate the value of this wood 
in our country. It has been so common to most of us 
that we are apt to depreciate its worth. But every 
student should know that, all in all, there is no greater 
wood than oak, nor indeed any so great. Fads in the 
treatment of it, green oaks, lemon colored oaks, golden 
oaks, and even silver oaks (altho this last has often a 
pleasing appearance of age), may come and go, but
-P-A-G-E-33

-P-A-G-E-34
34 WOOD-FINISHING 
the beauty of rugged simplicity in design and of warm 
nut-brown coloring and suitable polish in finishing 
must remain perennial. 
How often have we not entered a supposedly ‘‘high- 
class’? furniture store looking for something service- 
able and at the same time beautiful. And how often 
have we not been obliged to come away. almost despair- 
ing of finding what we wanted, and not ‘‘something just 
as good and cheaper.’’ Oak tables with thinly veneered 
tops—which the salesman told us was necessary to 
match the grain of the wood; oak beds in which the 
most of the wood was ash and elm; fumed oak pieces 
that showed at their corners that the fuming had not 
been done at all, but that the wood had merely suffered 
from an ammonia wash with coloring added to deceive 
the uneducated buyer, all these things we have had 
foisted upon us, and it is a part of the training in 
manual arts to show the student how to recognize 
cheapness. Of course, veneering has a legitimate use 
in panelling and such work, and bright mirror-like sur- 
faces are sometimes permissible, even beautiful, over 
highly figured woods and in small decorative pieces, but 
the supreme thing in furniture now remains as simple, 
beautiful, constructive lines, and subdued and harmoni- 
ous color and polish. In the treatment of oak, fuming 
and waxing is the most artistic of all finishes. 
Fuming, besides being the most artistic finish for oak, 
is one of the simplest for the student. Like oil polish- 
ing it requires time, and for this reason the real result 
is imitated by many cheap processes. But the student 
has not much need for hurry, and he ean, if guided 
and motivated by the influence of the instructor, set
-P-A-G-E-35
STAINING 35 
his own standard of wood finishing. I have been sur- 
prised as I have visited various manual training shops 
over the country at the infrequenecy with which this 
treatment was used. Students seem to think that it is 
a long, arduous task, which is difficult to do and un- 
certain in its result. This idea is far from true. Any 
student may get excellent results from a little care and 
patience in following the directions prescribed below. 
26. The Fuming-Box.—The first necessity for this 
process of coloring is a suitable box in which to place 
the pieces which you intend to fume. This box should 
be just a little larger than the largest piece that you 
intend to make. Perhaps it will be well to have the 
students make a good tight box which will serve as a 
container whenever any of the class has use for it. 
This box should be made of matched material, with a 
door that may be fastened tightly so as to allow none 
of the gas to escape. It is a prime necessity that the 
box be tight. It may either be painted on the inside, 
or papered carefully to cover all cracks that may re- 
main. Put a little extra care upon making this box. 
It will repay you in time and in the success of your 
projects. When this is ready your wood may be treated 
preparatory to fuming. 
27. Preparing the Wood for Fuming.—Many writers 
of texts on staining fail to take into account the great 
difference between the facility of fuming English and 
Dantzig oaks and the difficulty sometimes experienced 
in fuming our American oaks. They advise placing the 
wood, untreated in any way, in the fuming-box. This 
may give good results; on the other hand it may give 
no results at all. The whole process of fuming—and 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 WOOD-FINISHING 
this is the reason why oak lends itself particularly to 
this treatment—depends upon the amount of tannic 
acid there is in the wood. It is the chemical reaction 
of the ammonia and this acid which colors the wood. 
But our American oaks, for the most part, do not seem 
to have the large amount of acid that the English oaks 
contain. Consequently the process is slower. In order, 
then, to hasten the reaction, many wood-finishers apply 
to their wood a solution of about three tablespoonfuls 
of tannic acid and a similar quantity of pyrogallic acid 
dissolved in a quart of hot water. This solution is 
applied to the wood and allowed tordry. The wood is 
then rubbed down lightly with fine sandpaper, and 
placed in the fuming-box. The tannic acid is also a 
great aid in securing a uniform color to the wood, as 
well as in giving a darker shade to it in a shorter time 
than if it were untreated. 
28. Ammonia.—The ammonia used must be of full 
strength (specific gravity .880). Pour the ammonia 
into several dishes, preferably flat like sauce dishes, 
and set them in different places in the box so that all 
your work will be readily accessible to the fumes. Re- 
member that these fumes are poisonous. For this 
reason the box should be placed in another room from 
that in which people are working. The room in which 
the box is placed should be kept very warm, as heat 
makes the evaporation of the ammonia more rapid, 
and shortens the time of the process. The darkness 
of the color depends upon the length of time that the 
wood is subjected to the fumes. 
29. Testing the Fuming Process.—It is, of course, 
necessary that one be able to get some idea, from time
-P-A-G-E-37
  
STAINING 3h 
to time, of how the wood is coloring. The easiest way 
to do this is to have a one-inch hole bored in the side 
of the fuming-box. When the piece of furniture is 
placed in the box, make a plug of the same wood (this 
should fit the hole tightly) as that of the piece, and 
push it into the hole, so that it protrudes half a foot 
into the box. The action of the ammonia fumes will 
produce the same effect upon the plug as they do upon 
the wood inside. This plug may be removed at intervals 
of time to see how the work is progressing. The plug 
must, of course, be treated with the tannic acid solution 
exactly as the piece of woodwork was. The wood may 
remain in the fuming-box from six to forty-eight hours, 
depending upon the effectiveness of the chemical action, 
and the shade desired. 
30. Matching Color in Fuming.—It is not often pos- 
sible to make a large piece of work out of the lumber 
from a single log. This was the way of the old cabinet- 
makers, but we are usually obliged to resort to artificial 
means to match and imitate the woods in hand. Fre- 
quently we are obliged to make flat pieces, such as 
table-tops, out of pieces of wood of different color, 
porousness, and density of fiber. Of course the am- 
monia fumes will not have the same effect upon all of 
these. The more porous pieces will be darker than the 
other, the lighter pieces will probably remain lighter. 
Many manners of matching these could be suggested, 
but the following will prove most satisfactory. Tf, 
after taking the wood from the fuming-box, different 
colors are noticeable, coat the dark portions of ‘the 
wood with thin shellac. Allow this twenty minutes to 
dry and replace the article in the box. The fumes will 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 WOOD-FINISHING 
darken the parts uncovered with shellac, while those 
which have been covered will, of course, remain un- 
changed. 
But if, for example, we have a table top in which 
there is only one small dark strip, unless we wished 
the work to be very dark we shall be forced to bleach 
out the strip to match the rest of the wood. To do this, 
make a bleaching solution of two or three ounces of 
oxalic acid dissolved in a pint of hot water. Do not 
put solution in metal dish. Paint the dark portion 
carefully with an old brush dipped in the liquid, and 
allow it some time to ‘‘lighten up.’’ If the result is 
still not light enough, repeat the application. When 
the wood has been matched, neutralize the solution in 
order to keep it from bleaching the wood further, by 
rubbing the work with a cloth dipped in vinegar. 
Another method of matching the color is to use a 
very weak water stain on the light parts after the wood 
has been fumed. The bichromate of potash solution, 
mentioned under Formulas for Stains, Sec. 24, will do 
this very well. The stain must, of course, be consider- 
ably weaker, and must be applied carefully with a 
small, soft brush to avoid overlapping upon the parts 
that are already sufficiently dark. 
31. Oiling—After the oak has been fumed it may 
be given a coat of raw linseed oil. This oil has a 
pleasant darkening effect upon the wood. It brings out 
the more compact parts, and darkens the more porous. 
The oil should first be heated almost to a boiling point 
and scrubbed into the surface of the oak with a cloth. 
It is not so much the quantity of oil applied—altho 
there should never be much—as it is the manner and
-P-A-G-E-39
STAINING 39 
thoroness with which it is applied to the wood. It is 
perhaps well to add at this time that fumed oak is very 
seldom filled after the oiling. The best effect may be 
obtained by leaving the wood open, and finishing it 
with a wax polish. A coat or two of thin orange shellac 
should be applied to the wood after it is oiled. This 
is best done with a brush. The surface is then care- 
fully rubbed down with fine sandpaper (No. 00), and 
five or six coats of brown or white wax applied. Other 
chemical stains will be considered under special treat- 
ment of woods. 
32. Imitation Fumed Oak.—The process of imitat- 
ing fumed oak may be done in several ways. There 
are many commercial stains for the purpose, or, if 
these are not readily obtainable, several coats of strong 
ammonia will accomplish the result. If ammonia is to 
be applied in liquid form to the wood, a preliminary 
treatment with a tannic and pyrogallic acid solution is 
suggested. This will make a much better color than 
the ammonia alone. Ammonia should be applied in the 
open air as its fumes are very poisonous. Tt must be 
remembered that this process of imitation is not to be 
compared with the real process of fuming. It is an 
imitation, and rather a poor one at that. There is 
really no way to counterfeit the result of actual fuming, 
and the student or workman should resort to the imi- 
tation only when it is necessary to do so. 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  CHAPTER III 
FIuuers 
33. Use of Fillers—Filling the pores of wood has 
for some time taken the place of the slower and more 
expensive method of making a smooth surface by suc-, 
cessive coats of varnish or shellac. Fillers also are 
used to gain different effects in woods where they are 
colored in shades different from that of the natural 
color of the wood itself. In the beginning, however, it 
is perhaps well to lay down a few rules for the use 
of fillers which will guide the beginner until he has 
had sufficient experience to make them for himself. In 
the first place, the filler should be of the same color 
as, or slightly darker than, the stained or unstained 
wood. Try to match the color as accurately as possible 
by first testing its effect upon a block which has been 
stained and treated like the work in hand. This will 
avoid a great deal of trouble in coloring. Do not ex- 
periment with fillers until you have done quite a few 
pieces of work, and have seen the results of those which 
are recommended. 
34. Two Classes of Fillers.—Wood fillers are gen- 
erally of two classes: first, those which are used on 
open-grained woods; second, those which are used on 
close-grained woods. The amateur may be nonplussed 
with regard to such woods as birch, cherry, and maple, 
for these are surely hardwoods, yet they are close- 
grained. For convenience then we shall put down the 
different woods in two lists, according to the filler they 
40
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  FILLERS 41 
take best. The student need not take these lists as 
arbitrary. Indeed, the hard, close-grained woods are 
sometimes treated with one kind of filler, sometimes 
with the other. The best results, however, will be had 
if he follows the treatment suggested below. 
35. Woods That Require Paste Filler—The follow- 
ing woods may be most successfully filled with a paste 
filler: Ash, beech, butternut, (white walnut), black wal- 
nut, cireassian walnut, elm, mahogany, oak, rosewood 
and redwood. 
36. Paste Fillers—There are many good paste 
fillers to be bought in uncolored or colored forms. 
They are usually sold in an uncolored state so that the 
workman may thin them out to a correct consistency 
with turpentine or benzine ‘and add the amount of oil 
coloring necessary to match his wood. Besides these, 
there are almost an unlimited number of recipes for 
paste fillers suggested by experts in wood-finishing. It 
is useless, in a manual of this kind, to burden the 
amateur with pages of such recipes. They will only 
confuse him and indeed not add materially to his 
knowledge. We shall suggest two fillers which have 
proved best for all work of this kind. 
37. Preparing Fillers.—It is well for the student to 
have some practice in making his own filling compound. 
Mix together one part of brown japan and two parts 
of good boiled linseed oil. (The oil must be of the best 
quality if good results are to be had from varnishing.) 
Add to this sufficient silex (finest ground or floated) 
to make a paste. If the wood is to be finished in the 
natural color, this paste may be thinned with turpen- 
tine to the consistency of thick cream. If the wood 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 WOOD-FINISHING 
has been stained, add sufficient oil coloring to match 
the color of the wood. Remember that the coloring 
does not add any adhesive qualities to the filler, and 
  me 
   
      
Fic. 6. Mixing filler. 
that the less of it that is used the better the filler will 
be. If the oil coloring used is already mixed in oil, like 
that sold in tubes, an equal amount of the first in- 
gredient (boiled linseed oil) must be omitted. Because 
the wood darkens a trifle as it ages it is perhaps better
-P-A-G-E-43
  FILLERS 43 
to make the filler a little darker than the stain. This 
colored paste may be thinned with turpentine to a good 
creamy consistency, neither watery, nor too heavy. In 
the extremely open-grained woods, such as oak and 
ash, the filler is better made rather thick. In the close- 
grained woods, such as beech, the filler must be quite 
thin, just a little above the watery stage. The student 
will learn best from experience what consistency is 
best adapted to the woods which he uses. The silex 
used in this recipe is the best known base for a filler. 
This filler should be prepared several hours in advance 
of its use. 
Another good filler may be prepared in the following 
manner: Mix together thoroly in a pestle or some con- 
venient dish two parts of pure raw linseed oil (much 
of the linseed oil now on the market is heavily adulter- 
ated) two parts of best coach japan, sufficient finely 
powdered silica to form a stiff paste, oil coloring pig- 
ment to match. Thin this down with turpentine to the 
required consistency. This filler is cheaper than the 
former, and is very practicable for oak and ash. 
38. Colors Suitable for Paste Fillers—The follow- 
ing colors are best adapted to producing different 
shades of paste filler to match those of the stains 
you have used. The same pigments may be used 
in coloring liquid fillers if they have an oil or varnish 
base.

Mahogany. It is strongly advised that a very thin 
coating of shellac be applied to mahogany before the

peculiarity. These will be considered under the special 
treatment of oak, Sec. 118. 
39. Applying the Filler.—Paste fillers, except in 
unusual contingencies, should be applied with a stiff 
brush across the grain of the wood, Fig. 7, immediately 
over the thin shellac coat that was put on to set the
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 WOOD-FINISHING 
color of the stain. The filler should be brushed well into 
the pores of the wood, so as to’replace the air that is in 
them with the pigment of the filler. The filler should 
then be allowed to ‘‘flatten,’’ that is, to become dull. 
This usually requires from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
It must then be wiped off with a piece of rough cloth, 
Fig. 8 (burlap is commonly used), across the grain of 
the wood. This wiping across the grain is essential so 
that the filler will not be taken out of the pores. Do 
not wipe with the grain. Be sure that none of the filler 
is allowed to remain on the surface or it will give a 
muddy appearance to the finished product. For a final 
wiping a piece of cotton waste is reeommended. 
The pores of the wood should now be well filled with 
the color. Silex is composed of very tiny crystals, 
very sharp, which hold their place in the pores better 
than any other substance. If, however, the filler is too 
thick, or is allowed to become too dry before it is wiped 
off, these crystals may be pulled from their place. 
The filler should not ‘‘pull’’ heavily when it is being 
wiped off. I know that many furniture polishers will 
shake their heads at this. Neither should the filler be 
so thin that it is foreed from the pores by the cloth. 
Inspect your work carefully, after you have rubbed off 
the filler, to see that the wood does not show tiny pin- 
holes. If it does, allow the first coat of filler twenty- 
four hours to dry, then apply a second coat, treating it 
as before. Do not use a cloth that allows lint to remain 
on the surface. The whole work should be allowed 
' twenty-four hours to dry. The surface may then be 
rubbed down with No. 00 sandpaper. 
Perhaps the commonest difficulty that will be en-
-P-A-G-E-47
  
FILLERS 47 
countered by the student is in removing the excess filler 
from corners of the work. The best method of doing 
this is with a sharp stick covered with cloth. Remem- 
ber that all the filler must be removed from the surface 
and corners or your finish will appear patchy and 
unsightly. 
Maple, cherry, and white pine may be stained and 
allowed to dry. They may then be filled very easily 
and well with one or two coats of very thin white or 
brown shellac, depending upon the color of the stain. 
The reason that this manner of filling is suggested for 
these woods is that they are very close grained. Shel- 
lac, too, does not cloud the brillianey or depth in woods 
that have been stained, a very important consideration 
in recommending a filler. The shellac should be rubbed 
down to a dull, even surface. The wood is then ready 
for wax, varnish, or French polish finishing. 
40. Rubbing Down Filler.—A few words should be 
said about the rubbing down of paste filler. Remember 
that the purpose of this filler is to seal the pores and 
to present an absolutely level surface to the finish 
which is to follow. If then this filler is not rubbed well 
the surface is in worse condition to receive the final 
polish than if it had not been filled at all. For if the 
wood had not been filled it would have been level except 
for the pores. A poor filler, or one which has not been 
well rubbed down, leaves not only the pores inade- 
quately filled but also a ridgey surface upon which it 
will be extremely difficult to make an artistic finish. 
Time is always well spent upon producing the right 
kind of surface upon which to build your polish. 
The best way to use sandpaper to rub down either 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 : WOOD-FINISHING 
filler or varnish is directly on the hand. Never use a 
coarser grade of paper than No. 1; if it is a fine piece 
of work use No. 0 or 00 paper. Rub in the direction 
of the grain, not across it. Do not use oil on the sand- 
paper if a varnish finish is to be applied. Do not 
bear very heavily upon the paper or the sand will 
abrade the filler too much. If the filler is shellac, it 
should rub off in a white dust. If another kind of filler 
has been used, it should come off in powdered form. 
Dark spots on the sandpaper mean either that you are 
bearing down too hard in rubbing, or that the filler is 
not sufficiently dry to rub. Do not apply a paste filler 
to surface larger than you can take care of in rubbing 
off. 
41. Woods upon Which a Liquid Filler Should Be 
Used.—Maple, pine, whitewood, poplar, basswood, 
ebony, cypress, and gum are close-grained woods which- 
should be treated with liquid filler. 
42. Liquid Fillers—As in the case of the open- 
grained woods there were almost innumerable paste 
fillers, so with the close-grained woods it would be al- 
most hopeless and indeed a valueless task to try to 
enumerate all the liquid fillers that are used. Each 
painter or finisher has his pet formulas which he will 
swear by, and deny the merits of all others. It will 
be well to devote a paragraph of explanation with re- 
gard to liquid fillers. 
This class of filler is used, for the most part, on 
close-grained woods. Its purpose, like the paste filler, 
is to make a hard smooth surface upon which to put 
the finish. Close-grained woods may, of course, be 
filled with successive applications of varnish, each coat
-P-A-G-E-49
  FILLERS 49 
rubbed down well with fine sandpaper. But in most 
eases this older method is too slow. Then further, if 
the wood is to be finished in the natural color, varnish 
(other than Damar) will usually discolor it. Especially 
is this true with regard to cedar chests. Many times 
I have seen excellently constructed chests, really made 
eyesores because a so-called clear varnish had been 
applied directly to the wood. The varnish was, of 
course, the only filler and finish used. There are two 
reasons for this: in the first place ordinary clear var- 
nish is not really clear at all, but has quite a brown 
shade. Test it for yourself by pouring a little from 
one can into another, letting the stream fall between 
you and a window. Again, varnish contains a great 
deal of oil. This, on light-colored woods, turns a grey- 
ish brown which is very displeasing. On dark, or 
stained woods, the varnish filler may be used with good 
results. But on the light woods, especially on maple, 
pine, birch, that are to be finished in their natural 
shade, do not use a varnish filler, or apply varnish 
directly to the wood. I have made the exception of the 
pure Damar varnishes to this rule. They are entirely 
without color, but they often dry very slowly. An 
excellent varnish filler may be made by adding about 
half a pound of finely powdered silica to two quarts of 
good varnish. If this does not flow quite freely from 
the brush, add a little more varnish. A liquid filler 
should flow as easily as varnish to do its work well. 
Allow this forty-eight hours to dry, and then rub down 
to a smooth surface. 
43. Shellac As a Liquid Filler—Personally I am 
greatly in favor of pure white shellac as a liquid filler. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 WOOD-FINISHING 
This should be quite thin for ordinary close-grained 
wood. The shellac which is bought in a prepared state 
is too thick for good work. It should be thinned by 
adding about as much denatured alcohol as you have 
of the prepared shellac. If one coat does not fill the 
grain—and it seldom does,—rub down well and apply 
a second coat. Shellac dries quite rapidly, so that five 
or six hours will usually be sufficient to allow a:coat to 
dry. Moreover it has all the advantages of any other 
liquid filler with none of the disadvantages. It makes 
a very hard surface and seals the pores of the wood 
well. It does nat cloud the stain or make the color 
muddy. In any ease shellac is most frequently used as 
a surfacer, that is, a coat applied after the filler is used. 
This is true in the case of paste fillers and of liquid 
fillers. The open-grained woods would, of course, re- 
quire too many coats of shellac to make the latter a 
practicable filler. But in the case of the close-grained 
woods, ordinarily two or three coats of shellac will 
accomplish both the purposes of a filler and a surfacer. 
We are thus able often to accomplish two things with 
the same operation, and in the best manner. In saying 
this IT am aware that many wood-finishers declare that 
shellac is not a good surfacer to use under varnish. 
I have never seen an illustration of an undesirable 
result which could not be traced definitely to some other 
cause than that of a shellac surfacer. Sometimes the 
shellac has been applied too thick, but more often it has 
not been well rubbed down. Occasionally, too, a very 
poor grade of varnish has been used over the shellac, 
and has ‘‘crawled.’’ Some painters have shown me 
examples of varnishing that had, as they said, cracked
-P-A-G-E-51
  
FILLERS 51 
because of the use of shellac under it. I cannot credit 
this statement. I should rather think that there had 
been too little oil used in the varnish, and that thus to 
hasten the process of drying the varnisher had ren- 
dered his varnish brittle. Cheap oils and resins are 
the cause of most varnish cracking within a few years. 
But varnish at its best is often unsatisfactory. For all 
general needs the student may use thin shellac as a 
filler and surfacer for close-grained woods. 
44, Filling Wood to Withstand Weather.—It must 
be remembered, however, that shellac will not do as a 
filler or finish for work that will be exposed to the 
weather. Shellac rapidly disintegrates after it has 
become damp. All exterior work such as the outside 
of doors and porch furniture, should be filled with a 
good linseed oil filler. This filler may be made by 
mixing enough silica into any good varnish to form a 
thin paste. Dilute this mixture with a quantity of 
turpentine sufficient to make of it a good flowing con- 
sistency. Apply one or two coats of this, giving each 
coat ample time to dry, and rubbing each coat down 
with a fine sandpaper. Finish the work with a good 
quality of spar varnish. This will withstand almost 
any kind of weather. I may add that if the work is 
stained dark it will be well to add a little oil stain of 
a suitable color to match the color of the stain. 
Exposed work of open-grained wood will be treated 
with a good oil paste filler, such as has been suggested 
in See. 37 and 38, and finished with several coats of 
good spar varnish. In this book I am endeavoring to 
treat of the best ways of finishing wood. I have pur- 
posely omitted many cheaper recipes that would be

added were this work intended for artisans and furni- 
ture makers. It appears to me, however, that the 
amateur will not do a great deal of wood-finishing, and 
that when he wishes to spend the time and money to 
do the work himself, he will wish to take every advan- 
tage of good products. The varying cost between good 
materials and poor materials is usually small when it is 
compared with the value of the person’s time, while in 
cheap furniture houses a few cents difference in the 
price of a pound of filler or a quart of varnish soon 
amounts to a tremendous item.

' CHAPTER IV 
VARNISHING AND PoLIsHING 
45. Possibilities for the Amateur.—Thus far we 
have taken up three steps in wood-finishing: preparing 
the wood surface, staining, and filling. These have been 
considered in the order in which they naturally come 
in finishing woodwork. The next step, and the final 
one, is that of varnishing or polishing. No book, how- 
ever comprehensive, can take into account the almost 
innumerable peculiar little conditions which may arise 
in any of these processes, much less a simple text of 
this kind. A little reasoning and experimentation will 
do wonders in making the amateur careful and efficient. 
For wood-finishing is not a mystic art, unapproachable 
except to the elect. Moreover it will be seldom, very 
seldom, that the student will wish to undertake any 
large piece of very fine finishing such as a piano. This 
kind of work belongs properly to the expert who has 
at hand all the equipment to carry out long difficult 
processes of this kind. But why should not any one 
be able to finish or refinish chairs, tables, interior 
woodwork, and small pieces of furniture to his taste 
and at his convenience? The cost which is paid for 
labor to do this is high, beyond the means of many 
of us who wish occasionally to change the appearance 
of some of our surroundings. Any man or woman who 
is willing to read the principles of wood-finishing, and 
to do his work carefully, step by step, may obtain ex- 
cellent results, results which are often better than those 
53 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 WOOD-FINISHING 
which many slipshod and careless ee and decora- 
tors charge high rates for. 
46. Appropriateness of Finish. A kien we have 
stained and filled our piece of work so that a good 
surface is effected, we must next choose the kind of 
finish that we wish it to present. This, I am sorry to 
say, resolves itself, for most people, into the operation 
of varnishing. In reality, however, there are four 
ways, exclusive of painting and enameling, and many 
varieties of each one of these: varnishing, wax-polish- 
ing, oil-polishing, and French-polishing. In selecting 
the kind of finish that we are ta apply to the wood, 
we must consider the advantages of each and the needs 
of the piece of work. Obviously it is a waste of time 
to use an ordinary copal varnish upon a table top where 
water and hot liquids are constantly being spilled. So 
would a French polish be equally out of place. A spar 
varnish may, of course, be used, or, with equal pro- 
priety; wax or oil polish. But perhaps again the wax 
polish might be eliminated because it would not match 
the rest of the furniture which has been highly var- 
nished. Waxed work is rarely filled, and so the piece 
might demand another kind of treatment. On the other 
hand, it would ordinarily be out of all economy of ex- 
penditure in time and money to attempt to French- 
polish or oil-polish large surfaces such as doors and 
other interior woodwork. We must adapt our finish 
to the needs which the piece is meant to serve, and 
to the time and expense which it merits. 
47. What We May Expect of a Finish.—In this 
country we have so long been accustomed to the highly 
polished mirror-like surfaces of pieces of furniture,
-P-A-G-E-55
    
VARNISHING AND POLISHING 55 
that we have almost mentally set a standard for the 
evaluation of all finishes with this as a criterion. This 
is entirely wrong. There is today too much highly 
polished furniture. The top of a table should not re- 
flect one’s face. That is the purpose of a mirror. 
Glistening finishes rob the wood of its beauty, and 
deprive the observer of its enjoyment except he 
approach it from some angle where it does not reflect 
light. The polish of a piece of wood should not hide 
the beauty of the wood, but should enhance it. How 
often have you gone into a room where the furniture 
seemed to rise up and hit you as soon as you have en- 
tered. That is of course bad taste, for it violates the 
artistic purpose of wood-finishing. Furniture should 
be subdued and soft in tone. It should never make 
itself obtrusive. One need only compare some of our 
modern glistening pieces with some of the better class 
of soft velvety finishes to assure himself of the differ- 
ence. If furniture is noticeable, its artistic quality is 
usually to be questioned. Do not misunderstand me 
in this. Varnish is a very good finish. It often serves 
purposes which no other finish would do. But of late 
years it seems to be considerably overworked. When- 
ever varnish is used on furniture it should be ‘‘flat- 
* tened’’ (deprived of its shininess) in some way. Wood- — 
finishes have two functions: to protect and to beautify 
wood. Whenever they go beyond this and seek to 
exist for their own sakes, their value is question- 
able. 
48. Varnish—Varnish is the commonest of wood 
finishes. It is composed of gum, oil, and solvent, with 
usually a drier. The gum-is really the hardened sap  
-P-A-G-E-56
  
56 WOOD- FINISHING 
of prehistoric trees. There are almost innumerable 
grades in the qualities of gums, and upon the excellence 
of this part of the varnish its worth mainly depends. 
The oil used is usually linseed oil, or in the case of the 
“‘Chinamels,’? Chinese wood oil. A great deal of 
adulterated oils have been sold in varnishes to the 
public. Mineral oils and fish oils seem to have been 
used most extensively. These oils are slow drying, 
indeed they often refuse to dry at all. Under certain 
temperatures they will become ‘‘tacky,’’ and many 
people find out to their sorrow that the manufacturer 
has not played fair with them. Turpentine is the com- 
monest solvent. The ingredients in varnishes act in 
the following way: the gum gives hardness but brittle- 
ness, the oil elasticity and strength. These. two unite 
and harden by oxidation to form a covering which is 
hard in proportion to the amount of gum and elastic 
in proportion to the amount of oil used. The turpen- 
tine merely dissolves the mixture to ensure ‘‘easy 
flowing’’ qualities. The drier is used to hasten the 
hardening of the varnish. From this will be seen the 
principal difference between exterior and interior var- 
nishes. The brittle varnish would not do to withstand 
different climatic changes, for varnish must adapt it- 
self to the varying changes in the expansion and con- ° 
traction of wood. An exterior varnish will then be, 
of necessity, high (or ‘‘long’’) in oil. The opposite 
is true of an interior varnish. The changes in tem- 
perature are not so pronounced; the public demands 
lustre in interior finishes, a quality which the gum 
gives. These are, for this reason, ‘‘short’’ in oil, more 
lustrous, and more brittle than the exterior varnishes.
-P-A-G-E-57
VARNISHING AND POLISHING 57 
‘“‘Spar’’ varnishes, or those which resist the action of 
water, are unusually high in resinous gums. 
49. Conditions for Varnishing.—Much of the suc- 
cess in varnishing is due to correct and suitable condi- 
tions. Where a fine finish is desired, the work to be 
varnished should not be cold. The ideal condition for 
varnishing is a temperature of from seventy to sev- 
enty-five degrees Fahrenheit. The day should not be 
extremely damp nor extremely dry. The varnish 
should be of the temperature of the room and the wood. 
The principle is, of course, that oils become thicker 
in a cold temperature. The varnish should flow well 
under the brush so that a great deal of brushing to 
even the coat will not be necessary. Everything 
should be as nearly free from dust as it is possible to 
have it. Wood should not be dusted in the finishing 
room. If possible, the floor may be sprinkled with 
water the night before varnishing is to be done so as 
to settle any dust. Another necessity, and one which 
is most frequently disregarded by workmen, is a con- 
stant circulation of oxygen. Remember that varnish 
does not literally dry, it owidizes or takes oxygen from 
the air in hardening, giving off fumes. If the oxygen 
becomes exhausted the varnish stops oxidizing and 
hardening, and many. il ill effects may be produced. Air, 
while it should be ‘cireulating freely, should not blow 
directly upon the work. The room for varnishing 
should not be very light. On no account let newly 
vafnished work come under the direct rays of the sun 
it will be blistered. 
50. The Brush—The care of the brush used in var- 
ishing is of great importance. It does not matter how     
     
-P-A-G-E-58
58 WOOD-FINISHING 
carefully and well you have done the previous work, 
if your brush is not in good condition the result will be 
unsatisfactory. The size of the brush should be that 
which is best adapted to the work you have to do. No 
amount of care will produce a smooth surface on a 
large table top if a three-quarter inch brush is used. 
There will be too much overlapping, and the work will 
dry in ridges. A three-inch rubber-set brush of good, 
thick quality and long soft hair will serve your pur- 
poses best upon large surfaces. A smaller brush will be 
necessary for more minute work. Do not presume that 
a brush is free from dirt just because it is new. Just 
the opposite is true. Any new brush will have to be 
washed well in warm (not hot) water, and allowed to 
dry before it is used. If possible, allow the brush to 
hang in water or turpentine over night before using 
it. This will set the bristles so that they will not fall 
out when you are varnishing. On no account begin to 
varnish with a brush which is still moist with water 
or turpentine. If an old brush is to be used, unless you 
are certain that it contains no dirt or dust, wash it out 
well in turpentine. This will ‘‘eut’’ the old varnish or 
paint from the bristles. Turpentine, however, will not 
eut shellac. If the brush has been used in shellac, it 
will have to be cleaned with alcohol. In cleaning the 
brush be sure to wash off the upper part in which the 
bristles are set. This will prevent particles of dirt 
from getting into your work. You cannot be too care- 
ful in this, for even under the most favorable cireum- 
stances specks of dust will occasionally show in the sur- 
face that has been varnished. A small (one quart) 
varnish can is an excellent container in which to keep 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  VARNISHING AND POLISHING 59 
a varnish brush after it has been used. Cut down the 
handle of the brush until it is round, punch a hole in 
the top of the can and force the handle of the brush 
tightly into it just far enough so that the bristles of 
the brush will not touch the bottom of the can when the 
lid is replaced, Fig. 9. The best mixture in which to 
keep varnish brushes is a thin varnish (varnish diluted 
with equal amount of turpentine). This will always 
_ keep your brush in good condition, the friction lid and 
tightly plugged hole will exclude dust and keep the 
turpentine from evaporat- 
ing. Good varnish brushes 
are very expensive, and any 
small precaution of the kind 
suggested will pay many 
times over in money as well 
as. in satisfaction. How 
many times have I seen prac- 
tically new brushes, that 
have cost three or four dol- 
lars, allowed to harden and 
become worthless by being 
left about on tables or 
thrown with dusty trash. 
It would require hours of 
work to get these brushes 
into a serviceable condition 
again, and in all probability they would never resume 
their value unimpaired. It is almost as bad to throw 
brushes into an open can containing turpentine. Dust 
will always collect in the can, and the bristles which 
are allowed to rest on the bottom of the container

collect sediment, and from the weight of the brush,

of work. Then the student and the instructor wonder

Fic. 11. The second process in varnishing—ceross- 
firing or working the varnish across the grain. 
is for the most part dependent upon a common-sense 
knowledge of the principles of it, and care in carrying 
them out. For all ordinary work, three or four coats
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 WOOD-FINISHING 
of varnish should be enough. But if the wood has been 
inadequately filled, or insufficiently rubbed down to a 
smooth surface, other coats will be required, much to 
the detriment of the finish. The principle of this is, 
of course, that the more coats of varnish that are ap- 
plied, the more quickly will the surface ‘‘check’’ and 
crack. The object in varnishing is to put as little var- 
nish on a piece of work as possible to produce a smooth 
finish. Of course one or two coats will very seldom 
do this. Four coats seem to form a medium between 
too many and too few. It is clear, too, that the equiva- 
lent of one of these coats will be rubbed off in subse- 
quent smoothing. The first coat of varnish should be 
a little thinner than the other coats to enable it to 
adhere more closely to the shellac surfacer. This may 
be accomplished by adding a small amount of the best 
quality of turpentine (not more than one part of tur- 
pentine to three of varnish) and mixing the ingredi- 
ents well. Just enough varnish for the work in hand 
should be poured from the large can into an open dish. 
If the brush is frequently dipped and re-dipped into 
the can containing the varnish supply, a great deal of 
sediment is dropped into it, and it soon becomes foul 
and unfit for use. Never pour back into the supply can 
any varnish that may remain in the dish that you have 
been using. The first coat of varnish, being quite thin, 
will flow out from under the brush almost like water. 
Very little brushing will be necessary. Indeed, the 
less brushing the better, for air bubbles will arise from 
too much working of the varnish. The brush should 
not be dripping with varnish, but it should be well 
filled. Apply the varnish, where it is possible, with

long firm strokes. Work rapidly. Remove any hairs 
that may fall out of the brush with a thin bladed knife. 
The more quickly you can get this coat on,the better 
will it flow and level itself. When the most of the 
varnish has flowed from the brush, take up any excess 
varnish from the lower corners of the work. Allow 
this coat fully forty-eight hours to dry. The first diffi- 
culty in amateur varnishing will be that he will not 
be willing to allow this coat sufficient time to become 
thoroly hard. The fact that the surface feels firm to 
the touch is no indication that it is ready for rubbing. 
The surface oxidizes first, but the part underneath 
much more slowly. As a rule, no kind of satisfactory 
work may be accomplished if each coat is not allowed 
to become hard thruout. I know that this rule is some- 
time violated by painters and finishers for the sake 
of saving time, but it is not time well saved. If the 
varnish is not quite dry it will come off in small black 
spots on the sandpaper. If subsequent coats are 
applied, each coat will have to become thoroly dry 
before the under coat resumes its process of oxida- 
tion. Varnish that is worth applying to wood should 
not dry to a rubbing surface in less than forty-eight 
hours. If it does, there is probably an excess of gum 
and too little oil for a permanent finish, or it may have 
been adulterated with driers to such a degree that its 
serviceability is seriously impaired. For this reason 
spirit varnishes (those which are dissolved in alcohol) 
should not be used. This, of course, does not include 
shellac, which is an entirely different gum. 
52. Rubbing Down the First Coat.—If four coats of 
varnish are to be applied, the first one may be rubbed 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 WOOD-FINISHING 
down with fine sandpaper, No. 00, Fig. 12. The paper 
may be softened by putting a little oil on the back of it, 
or it may be split if it is a good quality. The reason of 
this is to prevent a stiff surface from coming in contact

with the varnish. For this reason also the sandpaper 
should be held on the tips of the fingers, not placed on 
a block as in smoothing wood. Rub the surface lightly 
in the direction of the grain, not across it. Look at 
the paper occasionally to see that no black spots appear
-P-A-G-E-65
  VARNISHING AND POLISHING 65 
on its surface. If you find these you are either press- 
ing too hard on the sandpaper, or the varnish is not 
dry enough to be rubbed. If the work is not dry 
enough, do not continue the rubbing. It can give you 
nothing but dissatisfaction. Put it back in the finish- 
ing room and allow it to dry. 
53. The Second and Third Coats of Varnish—These 
coats may be applied to the wood without being thinned 
with turpentine. They should not be so thick that they 
will not flow evenly from the brush. See that your 
work is very carefully dusted to remove all dirt that 
may remain from the sandpapering. A soft cloth, free 
from lint, just moistened in turpentine will do this 
admirably. Be sure that this cloth is not wet with 
turpentine or it may soften your first coat of varnish. 
The object of these second and third coats of varnish 
is to make an entirely smooth surface for the last or 
polishing coat. Each of these must be thoroly dry be- 
fore the next is applied. This is absolutely essential. 
Never should any rubbing be done sooner than in sev- 
enty-two hours. Even a longer time is advisable. 
Remember that varnish in reality dries for months. 
These coats of varnish should be rubbed down with 
pumice stone and water, or with pumice stone and oil. 
54. Rubbing with Pumice Stone—Even the finest 
of sand paper is too coarse to produce a finely polished 
surface. For this reason pumice stone, a pulverized 
rock, the minute erystals of which have very fine cut- 
ting edges, is used. Pumice stone may be bought in 
different degrees of fineness. A medium coarse stone, 
No. F, may be used for rubbing down the second coat 
of varnish, but the third should be rubbed with No.
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 WOOD-FINISHING 
FFF. It is well always to sift the pumice stone 
thru two thicknesses of cheese cloth before using it. 
This will take out any large crystals which would in-

jure the surface of the varnish. Another and an easier 
method of accomplishing the same result is to tie up 
some pumice stone in a handkerchief and pounce it on 
the surface as may be required. The rubbing of a sur- 
face with pumice stone is done in the following manner:      
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  VARNISHING AND POLISHING 67 
Obtain a good soft piece of harness-maker’s felt, about 
three inches wide and five inches long, Fig. 13. Moisten 
the surface of this with water or raw linseed oil (water 
will enable the pumice stone to cut more quickly, but 
oil will produce a finer finish), and rub gently over 
the varnish upon which pumice stone has been lightly 
sifted. Increase the pressure upon the rubber gradu- 
ally, and rub with a circular motion, covering all the 
work as many times as is necessary. Be careful not 
to rub in one place so long as to remove the coat of 
varnish. Look at the surface of the rubber frequently 
to see that it is not caked with hardened pumice stone 
and water. This must always be removed before the 
rubbing is resumed or it will scratch your work. If 
the surface cakes frequently use a little more water or 
oil. Excellent results‘may be had by using water as a 
solvent for the second rubbing mixture and oil for the 
third. When the surface has been brought to a per- 
fectly smooth dull finish, remove the pumice mixture 
with a cloth moistened with raw linseed oil. Remove 
all greasiness with a dry cloth and allow the varnish 
several hours in which to dry thoroly. It will then be 
ready for the last or polishing coat. 
55. The Use of Steel Wool—Steel wool should not 
be used where a fine finish is desired. Many furniture 
refinishing shops use it to save time, but the result is 
sure to be unsatisfactory. Steel wool cuts very rap- 
idly, but it also euts unevenly. <A small tuft of steel 
wool in the hand will cut all surfaces alike, the low 
places in the varnish as well as the high places, so that 
when you have finished rubbing the work is really in 
about the same condition as it was when you started.  
-P-A-G-E-68
68 WOOD-FINISHING 
The felt pad used in rubbing with pumice stone exerts 
more pressure upon the high points than upon the low, 
and tends constantly to level the whole surface. Steel 
wool, moreover, will not cut off the tiny projecting 
points where dust may have settled in the varnish. 
56. The Last Coat of Varnish.—It is of the most 
importance to have the surface of your work, even, 
perfectly dry, and greaseless before applying the final 
coat of varnish. This coat should be a high grade rub- 
bing varnish (one which contains a high percentage 
of gum, in order to make a hard surface that will not 
be affected by water or oil, and that will take a high 
polish), and should be applied with the utmost care. 
Speed in getting the varnish on the work is necessary 
so that it may have as good an opportunity to flow as 
possible before it begins to any appreciable extent the 
process of oxidation. Allow this coat several days at 
least in which to dry. When you are sure that it is 
perfectly hard, clean the piece of felt that you have 
used before, or better still have a new piece. Sprinkle 
finest sifted pumice stone over the surface of your 
work, moisten well the surface of your rubber with 
water or with sweet oil and polish as before, taking 
especial care not to rub thru any part of the var- 
nish. When the surface has been brought to a smooth 
dull gloss in which there are no specks or imperfec- 
tions, wipe off the polishing mixture and allow the 
piece several hours to dry. The final polishing may 
be done in many ways. I shall explain only two of 
these, as they will be sufficient for any polishing which 
the amateur or even the most advanced student may 
wish to do.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
VARNISHING AND POLISHING 69 
57. Polishing with Rotten Stone.—This material 
does not cut so rapidly as pumice, but it is very much 
finer, and consequently produces a smoother surface 
and a higher gloss. <A piece of fine felt—a piece of an 
old felt hat, well washed out to remove any grittiness— 
will do for a polisher. The rotten stone is sprinkled 
on the surface as the pumice stone was, the felt is 
moistened with sweet oil, and the polishing is begun 
with circular motions of the hand. Work over all 
surfaces carefully, looking often at the rubbing surface 
of the felt to see that no sediment has hardened there. 
The final rubbing with this polisher is done in the 
direction of the grain. The surface may then be 
cleaned thoroly, and a very little sweet oil rubbed over 
it. 
Another method of rubbing with rotten stone is with 
the surface of the hand which has been moistened with 
water and a little rotten stone sifted upon it. The hand 
is then rubbed over the varnish with a circular motion. 
In this way the whole piece is rubbed with the moist- 
ened palm and finally with the dry hand. The work is 
then oiled with sweet oil and cleaned off. 
58. Value of Experience.—No number of pages of 
suggestions for varnishing and polishing will take the 
place of actual experience. The first efforts of the 
student will not always be successful, but a little prac- 
tice will help him to overcome any difficulties which 
may present themselves. The knowledge of the in- 
structor, too, at different times will be of the greatest 
service to the novice in correcting faults and avoiding 
errors. It will be observed that I have omitted many 
kinds of varnishing which are often done on cheap 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    70 WOOD-FINISHING 
work. I have done this for two reasons: first, there 
are enough slipshod manners in common use now both 
by amateurs and professionals, and little enough good 
finishing; second, that if a student understands the 
principles of good finishing he will have no trouble in 
adapting them to needs of a less exacting nature. The 
suggestions given for finishing furniture will apply as 
well to interior woodwork of all kinds. Fewer coats 
of varnish may sometimes be used, frequently addi- 
tional coats will be necessary. But whatever are the 
needs of the particular wood in hand, the principles 
are similar. Exterior surfaces will not, of course, re- 
quire the care and thoroness of interior finishes. 
With a few remarks on one other class of varnishing, 
I shall take up other kinds of finishes which should 
receive much more attention in manual training rooms 
than they now do. 
59. Varnish-Staining.—This class of varnishing is 
really not to be recommended for any ordinary condi- 
tions. It is a cheap attempt to accomplish coloring and 
staining in a single operation, and like other substi- 
tutes it is not ‘‘just as good.’’ It has very little advan- 
tage over any other kind of finishing, and its disadvan- 
tages are many. In the first place it does not stain the 
wood at all. The whole color is retained in the coating. 
Whenever this is worn off or scratched the different 
color of the wood is visible. Varnish stains also do 
not bring out in a satisfactory manner the beauty and 
depth of the wood, but merely obscure them. On the 
whole it is a cheap job meant for cheap work, and 
should be regarded as such. Of course one may cover 
up a multitude of defects in this manner; he may hide
-P-A-G-E-71
  VARNISHING AND POLISHING 71 
poor matching and cheap wood, or he may obscure his 
own faulty joints, but unless there is a sufficient reason 
for the use of a varnish stain, it should be barred to 
students. This class of finishing has a place to fill, but 
it is not among the better kinds of wood-finishing. 
Varnish stain should be applied like any other varnish, 
and allowed to dry thoroly. The coloring in the 
varnish will probably keep it from drying so com- 
pletely as if it were used pure. The work may be 
rubbed down in the manner suggested above. For 
quickness in renovating the finish of pieces which are 
not valuable, varnish stain may be used, but the work 
is not of an enduring nature, and time is seldom well 
spent in doing it. 
60. Common Faults in Varnished Surfaces.— 
Blooming or white blotches. This fault will more 
often occur in good varnishes than with cheaper 
grades. It is usually caused by the presence of mois- 
ture in the wood, or in the varnish. For this reason 
varnish should not be stored in a cold or damp place, or 
left uncovered to the air when it is not in use. Bloom- 
ing may sometimes be cured by bathing the part in 
warm water and then rubbing it briskly with a piece of 
fine woolen cloth; sometimes by rubbing with a piece 
of cloth dipped in a solution of olive oil and vinegar; 
but frequently the surface will have to be well rubbed 
down, or even removed entirely, and revarnished. 
Pitting. This fault is usually caused by undue mois- 
ture in the room while the varnishing is being done, or 
because the varnish has been thinned with a poor grade 
of turpentine.. The only remedy for this is to remove 
the varnish and do the work over. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 WOOD-FINISHING 
Crawling or Creeping. This may result from greasi- 
ness on the surface that has been varnished, from 
varnishing over partly dried coats of varnish, or from 
sudden changes in the temperature. The surface is 
usually so uneven when this occurs that the only 
remedy is to rub down and revarnish. 
Brush Marks. These are caused by too much brush- 
ing or by using a varnish which is too thick. Rub 
down the coat to an even surface; see that the varnish 
is of a good flowing consistency by adding, if neces- 
sary, some good quality turpentine; and revarnish, 
allowing the liquid to cover the surface as much as 
possible by its own spreading. : 
Checking. This fault is most noticeable over 
veneered work. It is caused by some change in the 
varnish or the wood underneath it and to which it is 
too brittle to adjust itself. It may be caused by using 
different kinds of varnishes over each other. Pianos 
often do this because the elasticity or oil part of the 
varnish has been sacrificed to the polish or gum part. 
Thus the varnish has been made too brittle. Usually 
veneered work shows this fault most quickly. A tem- 
porary remedy may be had by rubbing the work with 
a cloth moistened with linseed oil, but this is not a per- 
manent relief for as soon as the oil dries off the surface 
will appear as before. It is better to rub down the 
surface and revarnish it. 
Sweating. This is almost invariably caused by rub- 
bing varnish before it is sufficiently dry. The presence 
of cheap oils may sometimes account for it. Put the 
work back to dry for a few days, then the rubbing may 
be resumed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  VARNISHING AND POLISHING 73 
Imperfect Drying. We often find varnished work 
which remains sticky for weeks after it is used, and 
indeed, it may never become dry. The cause of this is 
probably that the varnish contains cheap mineral or 
fish oils which do not oxidize like linseed oil. Again 
the cause may be greasiness on the surface to which 
the varnish was applied. Varnish does not dry over 
grease. The only remedy is to soften the varnish with 
turpentine or with some commercial varnish remover, 
wipe it off with a cotton cloth, wash the surface with 
a mild solution of vinegar to prevent any darkening 
action of an acid in the commercial remover, and re- 
finish. Sometimes drying may be forced by applying 
directly to the sticky surface a coat of terebine or 
other liquid drier. When this fault occurs in the pews 
of churches or in other public seats the fault is proba- 
bly that the contractor has used a cheap varnish or 
that the fumes and heat from the bodies of so many 
people have softened the oil in the varnish. There are 
not many kinds of varnishes that will stand such 
atmospheric conditions without softening. The only 
remedy for this is to remove the varnish (it will not 
do to put a coat of good varnish over the sticky sub- 
stance) and refinish the work, using a special varnish 
which is made for the purpose. Better still, the work 
may be waxed. 
61. Patching Varnish—Very often one has the 
problem of patching holes or large abraded parts in a 
varnished surface. This requires a special treatment 
and a great deal of care in working. The first thing to 
do is to cleanse the abraded portion thoroly with a 
fine brush moistened with turpentine. You will then
-P-A-G-E-74
74 : WOOD-FINISHING 
be able to see whether or not the wood needs restain- 
ing. If it does the stain should be applied in very thin 
or weak coats until a perfect color match is obtained. 
When this has had time to dry, apply a coat of varnish 
to the bottom of the worn part. Never try to patch a 
hole with a single coat of varnish. Tt will not be satis- 
factory. Give this application ample time to dry and 
then rub it down with pumice stone and water, not with 
sandpaper, and be careful not to rub outside the hole. 
Wipe off the pumice carefully, allow a few hours for 
the work to dry off again, and apply another coat of 
varnish, covering this time a little larger section than 
before. Treat this in the same way as the first coat, 
and apply a third. Successive coats of varnish, proba- 
bly three or, at the most, four will be necessary to re- 
store the surface to its original finish. The last coat 
should be feathered into the edge of the patch and 
no rubbing should be done until the new varnish is © 
thoroly dry. Pumice stone and oil, followed by rot- 
ten stone if the surface is highly polished, will restore 
the finish so that the patch will not be noticeable.
-P-A-G-E-75
CHAPTER V 
Wax-Po.isHINe 
62. Use of Wax.—This form of polishing is one of 
the oldest and best ways of finishing wood. It is. too, 
perhaps the easiest of all methods. Wax-polishing, 
also, has many advantages over other manners of fin- 
ishing. It imparts to the wood a beautiful satin luster, 
it brings out the grain of dark woods beautifully, and, 
altho it may be easily injured, it does not show 
seratches to such an extent as varnish or French- 
polish, and may be restored in the simplest manner. It 
-seems particularly well adapted to finishing certain 
woods such as oak, mahogany, and walnut, and always 
adds the charm of antique appearance to any wood on 
which it is used. Wax-polishing well deserves the 
vogue that it is having after so many years of use, 
and as a manner of wood-finishing should be highly 
recommended to amateurs as well as to experts. It 
is generally used upon the three woods mentioned 
above, but it need not be confined to them. 
63. Preparing Wax.—The wax used in polishing 
may be obtained from any paint and varnish shop, but 
if the student prefers to make his own, this may be 
done very easily and cheaply. Hither white or brown 
wax may be used, depending upon the effect that the 
finisher is trying to obtain. The white wax fills the 
pores of a dark or dark-stained wood and gives a 
weathered effect to it. The brown wax does not show 
as a different color. In preparing the wax merely cut 
75
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 WOOD-FINISHING 
a few ounces of bees wax or white wax into thin shav- 
ings and drop them into good turpentine. Allow this 
to stand over night. Upon re-examination the wax 
will be found to be dissolved and ready for use. The 
consistency of this must vary in accordance with the 
needs of the wood upon which it is to be used. Very 
open-grained woods such as oak, ash, and chestnut will 
be best polished with quite a stiff paste, while ma- 
hogany and walnut will need a correspondingly thinner 
mixture. Wax should not, however, be made very thin. 
It should always be in paste form. The dissolving of 
the wax in the turpentine may be hastened by heat, 
but as turpentine is a very inflammable liquid, this 
method should be used very carefully. Some finishers 
use various other ingredients in the wax, but in my 
opinion the advantages of these are outweighed by 
their disadvantages. At any rate this simple com- 
pound will prove sufficient for and give excellent re- 
sults to any work upon which it is used. For the pol- 
ishing of such pieces of furniture as table tops and 
chests it has no peer, while, not the least of its qualities 
which may recommend it to the novice, it is as nearly 
a fool-proof polish as can be made. Indeed, it would 
be difficult to imagine how any one could spoil a wax 
polish, or fail to get an excellent finish consistently. 
If the wax is desired in any particular color merely 
add a sufficient amount of oil analine dye to produce 
the shade. 
64. Applying the Wax.—The easiest manner of 
applying wax to a surface is to wrap some of it in two 
layers of an old handkerchief and rub it briskly over 
the surface. This will distribute the wax evenly. Allow
-P-A-G-E-77
  
WAX-POLISHING 77 
it a few minutes to dry and then rub, first across the 
grain and then with the grain, with a brush or coarse 
cloth. Allow each coat to become hard before another 
is applied or time will be lost in rubbing off what has 
been put on. There can be no definite number of coats 
of wax given as a minimum or maximum. Merely rub 
on a sufficient number of coats to give the work a good 
luster, and go over it occasionally to keep it in good 
condition. It is customary to wax wood that has not 
been filled, but to which a coat or two of thin shellac 
has been applied to set the stain. Filled woods seem 
to be out of keeping with wax-polishing. Often the 
shellac undercoat is, for special reasons, omitted. But 
T shall treat of this under Chapter XI. The only 
things necessary to obtain an excellent wax finish are 
dry wood and cloth, and plenty of brisk rubbing. Three 
pieces of cloth are usually sufficient—one with which 
to apply the wax, one (or a brush) to rub in the wax, 
and a third to do the final polishing. The polishing 
may be facilitated on horizontal surfaces if a brick 
sewed up in quite a few layers of cloth is used as a 
polisher. The weight of the brick will save quite a lot 
of pressure from the arms and obtain as good a result 
with less work. In polishing carved work a brush will 
be necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  CHAPTER VI 
O1-PoLIsHING 
65. Values of Oil-Polishing.—This kind of polishing 
is perhaps the oldest of all attempts at wood-finishing. 
Oil, as has been mentioned before, has a beautiful dark- 
ening effect upon the dark hardwoods. The softer 
parts of the wood absorb the oil to a much greater 
extent than the closer grained and harder parts. Thus 
naturally does the oil fulfil the natural duty of a stain, 
viz., to bring out more prominently the natural beauty 
of the wood. Even where other means such as varnish- 
ing, French-polishing, or waxing are resorted to as 
final polishes, oil plays an important part in finishing. 
It is seldom used on light-colored woods for the effect 
is usually unpleasant. Strictly speaking, oil-polishing 
means the application of linseed oil to the surface of 
the wood and subsequent rubbing until a dull satin 
gloss is obtained. But there is a great deal of con- 
fusion in regard to different methods advocated to 
accomplish the result with a saving of time. At pres- 
ent no furniture company could afford to spend time in 
making this polish on a large scale. It is long and 
tedious, and people in general are little able to appre- 
ciate its value. Perhaps at some later date there may 
be sufficient demand for it to make the operation pay 
for itself, but at present only special jobs are finished 
in this way. For the student, or the person who makes 
this art his hobby, oil-polishing has a different aspect. 
He need not hurry in his work because he is under no 
78
-P-A-G-E-79
  
OIL-POLISHING 79 
necessity to turn his product into money. For the one, 
then, who wishes to make something beautiful and is 
willing to spend the time it will take him to do it, I 
append this chapter. 
Oil-polishing is a process which it takes years to 
perfect. Indeed one might say that it is never really 
finished, for the occasional rubbing, perhaps only once 
a month, which is usually given to its surface serves 
only to enhance its softness and to enrich its color. 
Oil besides being a polish is one of the best preserva- 
tives of wood. It seals every pore hermetically by 
filling it, and of all polishes is least affected by climatic 
conditions. Warm water or hot dishes do not injure 
it, and yet the sheeting of oil which covers the wood 
is so thin that it ean scarcely be measured. 
66. Preparing the Surface of the Wood for Oil-Pol- 
ishing.—I cannot urge too strongly the necessity for 
a smooth surface before beginning the process of oil- 
polishing. The work should be gone over very crit- 
ieally to discover even the minutest abrasions or 
seratches, for these if left will show in greatly 
increased magnitude under the polish. All holes 
should be filled if possible with a dark waa-stopping 
such as has been described in Chapter I of this book. 
Remember that walnut turns almost black under the 
influence of oil, mahogany turns a rich brown, as does 
oak. The work may, of course be stained with any 
kind of stain, but in the case of walnut this will not be 
necessary. | 
‘67. The Oil Used.—The oil used in polishing is lin- 
seed oil, either raw or boiled. If raw oil is used dilute 
it with about one part of turpentine to five of the oil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 WOOD-FINISHING 
Allow this to simmer over a slow fire in an open kettle 
for several hours. Do not allow it to come to a boil. 
The boiled oil should likewise be heated before it is 
used. Unless you are sure of the quality of boiled oil 
do not use it. Most commercial boiled oil is rendered 
useless by adulterants. 
68. Applying the Oil—The warm oil may be 
applied with a brush or cloth directly to the wood. No 
filling is generally used, altho a good way in which to 
shorten the procedure of polishing is to give the work 
one or two coats of thin shellac (either orange or 
white) after two coats of the oil have been applied. 
The shellac should be of almost watery consistency or 
it will fill the pores of the wood too much. Another 
manner of accomplishing the same result is to go over 
the surface once or twice with French polish. In either 
case it is well to rub down the shellae to a smooth sur- 
face with No. 00 sandpaper which has been used so 
that its cutting edges are quite fine. A little oil on the 
surface of the sandpaper will help to keep it from 
scratching. On no account use new sandpaper or rub 
across the grain of the wood. An experiment will show 
the justification of this injunction. If French polish 
is used it may be smoothed in the manner described 
under the chapter treating of this kind of polish, in- 
stead of with sandpaper. Wipe off the surface grease 
with a cloth dampened in alcohol before applying the 
shellac. The object in oil-polishing is to scrub the oil 
into the pores of the wood. It does not require a great 
deal of oil on the surface at any one time. The polish 
is effected by rubbing or friction. First, rub across 
the grain briskly, then with the grain. Do not attempt
-P-A-G-E-81
OIL-POLISHING 81 
to hurry the process, but put on a few coats daily and 
set the work aside for a while. It is well to have other 
work on hand to do when you are oil-polishing. After 
a week of daily applications of oil and rubbing the 
polish should begin to appear. If it shows bright and 
dull spots unevenly it is probable that you have applied 
too much shellac in places, or that you have not rubbed 
down the shellac well. The way to remedy this is to 
take a rubber of French-polish and go over the dull 
spots carefully. Smooth this application with the rub- 
ber, not with sandpaper, and apply the oil as you did 
before. In this way the whole surface may be brought 
to an even gloss. Each time an application of oil is 
given to the surface, it should be rubbed to a dry finish 
before the next coat is applied. The suggestion I 
made in regard to wax-polishing with a brick well 
wrapped in coarse cloth may well be used in oil-polish- 
ing also. The only difference between polishing wax 
and oil is that oil requires more scrubbing and less 
friction than does wax. However the student will soon 
learn this for himself after he has attempted it a few 
times. I may add one other suggestion: If boiled oil 
is used, I mean by this the commercial boiled linseed 
oil, one will save time in polishing if he allows the sedi- 
ment of the oil to be deposited on the surface of his 
work before he begins to polish. This sediment will 
form as a white deposit a few minutes after the boiled 
oil is applied to the wood. It must immediately be 
rubbed off, and in this rubbing the polish is effected. 
After the finish is completed, it should be rubbed over 
a few times a year with oil to help it retain its beauty, 
and to feed any pores which may have begun to open.

Furniture finished in this way has a charm that 
increases with age, while the polish, unlike varnish, 
becomes better with time. 
The student should not attempt large pieces of this 
work to begin with. Small flat surfaces are best at 
first. Neither should oil-polishing be attempted over 
inlaid work without several coats of white shellac being 
given to the work to keep the oil from discoloring the 
light-colored woods. As a general rule, however, 
French-polish is much better adapted to inlaid work 
or marquetry than any other form of polish. 
69. Lack of Luster in Oil-Polish—This is almost 
invariably caused by cheap adulterated oil being used 
in polishing. The presence of many cheap substitutes 
in linseed oil has become very common of late years. 
These oils do not dry thoroly like pure linseed oil, and 
no amount of polishing will produce a finish. The only 
remedy for this is to dry off the surface of the wood 
and use good quality of oil for the remainder of the 
work.

70. Place for French Polishing.—In this country 
the art of French-polishing has been largely substi- 
tuted by that of varnishing, but it still remains for cer- 
tain kinds of work the height of the polisher’s art. 
Varnishing can be done in its earlier stages by labor 
that is not highly skilled, but French-polish must be 
done thruout by experts. New methods of varnishing 
such as dipping and spraying with air pressure have 
only served to widen the gap between the two ways of 
wood-finishing, so that it is unusual now to see a piece 
of genuine French-polished work on the market. But 
this need not deter the student from attempting it, and, 
after a little experience, from obtaining quite excellent 
results. No number of suggestions will, without actual 
experience, make a French-polisher, but a detailed 
description of the different processes of it will help the 
novice to avoid many of the pitfalls into which he 
would otherwise stumble. French-polishing is the 
most difficult of all wood-finishing. At every move the 
amateur is apt to make a mistake which will irretrieva- 
bly spoil his polish. For this reason only small pieces 
of flat work should be attempted at first, and several 
of these should be done before larger projects are 
begun. But the satisfying beauty of a well polished 
piece of work will be its own reward for the tediousness - 
of the process. 
The student should be encouraged to attempt this 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
84 WOOD-FINISHING 
manner of polishing after he has the rudiments of fur- 
niture construction well in hand. It is useless for him 
to spend the time and care which French-polishing 
requires upon a poorly made piece of woodwork. 
Design, construction, and finish—these go hand in 
hand. No one of them may be done in a slipshod 
manner. Yet of the three the one most commonly 
passed over hurriedly and carelessly is the last. This 
should not be true, for it matters little how good the 
design be drawn or the construction effected if the 
finishing is not well done. 
French-polishing is the application of shellac by rub- 
bing it over the wood with a specially constructed 
cloth called a rubber. It does not mean in any sense 
the application of shellac with a brush which belongs 
properly to the class of finishing known as spirit-var- 
nishing. It is really done in three distinct processes: 
(1) filling the pores of the wood and putting on a body 
of polish, (2) smoothing out the polish to get rid of 
*any early marks which the heavy polish has made, and 
(3) spiriting out with pure alcohol. I shall treat of 
these in the order in which they naturally come, but 
first let us turn our attentions to the preparatory 
processes. 
71. The Polish.—French-polishing is done for the 
most part with orange or white shellac. Only upon 
occasion is the polish colored. While prepared shellac 
may be bought in convenient-sized bottles, it may be 
made easily, and will often give better results than the 
prepared compound. White or bleached shellac is diffi- 
cult to make, for it involves the bleaching out of all the 
orange coloring by a potash or other chemical solu-
-P-A-G-E-85
  FRENCH-POLISHING 85 
tion. It will be well, then, for the amateur to buy 
whatever white shellac is needed for the finishing of 
natural woods. White shellac is more apt to be adul- 
terated than is orange shellac, and it is much more 
susceptible to injury from light, age, and climatic con- 
ditions. To prepare a good quality of orange shellac 
merely add a pint of denatured alcohol or better still, 
if it can be obtained, pure grain alcohol, to six ounces 
of shellac gum. On no account use wood alcohol for 
French-polishing as it will not work satisfactorily. The 
gum will dissolve more readily if it is broken up into 
small pieces. Allow this to stand in a bottle over night. 
The next morning the shellac will be dissolved and 
ready for use. The commercial prepared shellac is 
usually too thick for any except the initial polishing. 
It should be thinned with about one part of denatured 
or grain aleohol to three parts of the shellac, and well 
shaken so as to mix the extra ingredient thoroly. If 
you find that the shellae contains dust or dirt of any 
kind strain it thru a piece of clean muslin. Never 
allow water to enter the shellac even in the smallest 
amount. Do not put shellac in a metal dish, or allow 
the metal handle of a varnish brush to lie in it. The 
metal will discolor white shellac badly, and impair the 
color of orange shellac. 
72. Source of Shellac.—Shellac is a resinous exuda- 
tion which appears upon the twigs and branches of cer- 
tain Southern Asiatic trees as the result..of minute 
punctures which an insect makes in their bark in order 
to deposit her eggs. This substance is gathered by 
breaking off the twigs, and in such condition is known 
as stick lac. The lac is then dried, beaten from the  
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 WOOD-FINISHING 
twigs and melted. It is now in the stage known as 
seed-lac ‘or grain-lac. This is now placed in sacks and 
heated over a slow fire to melt it. The sacks are then 
twisted so as to force the lac thru the pores of the 
cloth and in this way to strain it. As it is strained it 
is allowed to flow upon clean planks, where it hardens 
in a caked or shell form. This product is now shell lac 
or shellac. Shellac is soluble in both borax and alkali 
solutions and spirit, but the former combination does 
not play any important part in wood finishing. Many 
other ingredients are used in commercially prepared 
shellac, some added to make the gum more elastic, 
others to cheapen the cost of the product. Shellac 
makes the hardest of all finishes, it does not show 
scratches as varnish does, and wears very much better 
than varnish. The finest pieces of delicate intarsiatura 
and marquetry are usually French-polished, because 
varnish would to some extent discolor the different 
woods used. 
73. Preparing the Wood for French-Polishing.— 
The wood to be polished may be filled with a filler such 
as has been suggested in Chapter III of this book, or 
it may be filled with the polish itself. This latter mode 
is probably better unless the wood used is so open- 
grained that too much time will be consumed in doing 
it. In any event the wood must be stained and matched 
as well as possible before the filling is attempted. Wax- 
stopping is suggested to fill all holes in the wood. Altho 
some polishers apply a coat or two of shellac with a 
brush and rub these down with pumice stone and oil 
before beginning the French-polishing proper, this 
method is not to be advocated strongly. If it is used,
-P-A-G-E-87
FRENCH-POLISHING 87 
be sure to remove all oil from the surface of the shellac 
before you begin to polish. It is well, too, to lave as 
many flat surfaces as possible. If your work is ready 
to be put together, polish as much of it in this state as 
may afterwards be glued without danger of injuring 
the polish. 
74, The Rubber—Shellac in French:polishing is . 
applied with a rubber composed of an inner core which 
is moistened with the polish and enclosed in two layers 
of well-washed muslin. There is much conflicting ad- 
vice concerning the correct manner of making the rub- 
- ber. The way which I illustrate here is taken from 
J. C. S. Brough’s treatise on Staining and Polishing. 
It has proved so successful as compared with other 
methods which I have used that I have no fear of rec- 
ommending it for student as well as for expert use. 
First, roll up a piece of heavy cotton cloth—bed sheet- 
ing will do—into the form of a cone about three inches 
long, as shown in A, Fig. 14, and an inch or more in 
diameter at the base. Do not attempt to do this with 
cotton batting, as this will not retain its shape. Now 
double a clean, well-washed handkerchief, or other 
piece of muslin which is free from lint, and lay it be- 
fore you, the folded edge away from you. Place the 
cone-shaped piece of sheeting in the center of the mus- 
lin with its point toward the folded edge and about 
an inch away from it. B, Fig. 14. Fold the edge back 
over the point, then bring the two sides of the outer 
wrapping together with a few twists, and the rubber 
is complete, C and D, Fig. 14. In this work do not 
think that any kind or shape of rubber will do. Much 
of the success of the polishing will be due to the care
-P-A-G-E-88
  ‘88 WOOD-FINISHING 
with which the student follows these directions until 
he becomes sufficiently expert to change and devise 
ways of his own. On no account should the rubber 
be made by simply twisting up one piece of cloth in- 
side another. Even an expert could not do satisfac- 
tory work with that as a tool. The rubber is held in the 
hand with two fingers on the point of the cone, the re- 
  Fic. 14. Steps in making the rubber for French-polishing. 
mainder grasped firmly in the palm, Fig. 15. The rub- 
bing surface of the rubber must be entirely free from 
wrinkles or folds, and bound tightly across the firm 
inner cone. <A larger rubber will be needed if large 
pieces of work are to be attempted, but the size sug- 
gested will be sufficient for beginning operations. At 
least three of these rubbers will be needed in the com- 
plete process of polishing, and if the surface of them
-P-A-G-E-89
FRENCH-POLISHING 89 
becomes worn, the cone must be changed so that a new 
rubbing surface is presented to the wood. 
75. Beginning the Polishing.—If the student wishes 
  
  
      
Fie. 15. A student applying French-polish. 
to fill the wood without a special wood filler, this opera- 
tion may now be begun. The cone is taken from the rub- 
ber and saturated with a medium thick shellac polish 
such as described earlier in the chapter. It is then 
replaced in the muslin and enclosed in the manner 
suggested. Now take some pumice stone which has   
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 WOOD-FINISHING 
been tied up in a small cotton sack and dust it lightly 
over the surface of the wood. Do not use much pumice 
stone at a time, nor have your rubber filled with a 
thick polish. Hither of these faults will be shown if 
the rubber pushes the pumice stone ahead of it, instead 
of forcing it into the pores of the wood. Rub the 
saturated rubber, beginning lightly on the wood, with 
a circular motion, covering the whole surface without 
allowing the rubber to pause on the wood. This is of 
the utmost importance, for as soon as the rubber rests 
on the polish it will stick. Furthermore, do not rub 
in the same place more than once. Keep the rubber 
moving from one place to another. When you have 
gone over the work once, allow it half an hour or more 
to dry. If the pores are not filled—and they will not 
be filled if the wood is open-grained—repeat the opera- 
tion, using the pumice stone and polish as before. It 
may often require several coats of polish to fill a wood 
as open grained as walnut, while many more will be 
needed for oak or chestnut. Each coat should be 
rubbed down with very fine sandpaper after it is quite 
dry. This is a factor that must be borne in mind con- 
stantly when finishing with shellac: that the more coats 
which are applied the longer time will each coat take 
to dry. Thus the first application may dry sufficiently 
to rub within thirty minutes, but the second should be 
allowed to remain an hour. Do not hurry in your 
work. You will save a great deal of time by being 
sure that the shellac is completely dry before you begin 
to rub it. As in all rubbing with sandpaper rub in 
the direction of the grain of the wood, never across it. 
When the pores are well filled dust off any pumice that
-P-A-G-E-91
  FRENCH-POLISHING 91 
may remain on the surface, and allow the work to stand 
for an hour. The surface should now be ready for 
polishing. . 
76. Bodying Up.—After the grain of the wood has 
been well filled with shellac and pumice stone, the next 
operation is to obtain a good body of polish on the 
work. This process involves more care than the first, 
for we have now an under-coat of shellac which may, 
at any time, be softened by the alcohol in the polish 
which we are using. The polish should be still quite 
heavy in body, almost as thick as that used in the first 
process. The method of applying it is similar to that 
which has been described, but great care must be taken 
lest the under-coat be picked up on the rubber. Some 
precautions are necessary. In the first place use a 
new rubber, or at least one which has not been used 
with pumice stone. The rubbing surface of the old 
one will probably be badly frayed in the first part of 
the polishing, and a smooth clean surface is absolutely 
necessary at this, as indeed at all subsequent times. 
Take the cone-shaped wadding from the rubber and 
moisten it with polish. Do not saturate it, however. 
Replace the exterior cloth and begin as before lightly 
with a good full circular sweep, taking care not to go 
over the path of the rubber a second time. If you do 
this, the rubber will probably stick in the quick-drying 
coat that has just been applied. If the rubber sticks 
accidentally to the work and pulls up a part of the 
finish or roughens it, do not attempt to smooth the 
abrasion by pressing more firmly on the rubber or by 
going over the surface again. Wait until the shellac 
in this place is thoroly dry. You will then have lit-
-P-A-G-E-92
  
92 WOOD-FINISHING 
tle difficulty in filling the hole. I suggested that you 
begin with a light but firm pressure on the surface. 
This is necessary for the shellac in the rubber will 
flow easily from the rubbing surface. As the rubber 
loses its moisture it will be necessary to press gradu- 
ally harder. At this stage of the polishing never work 
with a dry rubber. Stop and recharge it as often as 
necessary. If the shellac seems to ‘‘pick up’’ from 
the work very easily one of two faults is evident— 
either you are working upon a partially dried sur- 
face with too little polish on the rubber, or you have 
thinned the shellac with a cheap form of spirits such 
as wood alcohol. Before trying to determine which 
of these is the cause of your difficulty be sure that it 
is not your own carelessness in allowing the rubber to 
stand on the work or in rubbing over a surface which 
is not dry and hard. Only experience will teach the 
amateur just how heavily to bear upon the polishing 
rubber, or how much polish to use at different stages 
of the process, or how much the polish is ‘‘pulling’’ 
under the polisher. The first coat in this part of the 
work may be applied directly to the surface, and with- 
out any lubricant. As the work progresses, however, 
you will find that the rubber will ‘‘drag’’ consider- 
ably in spite of anything you may do. When you find 
this is happening, recharge the rubber with shellac, 
moisten the tip of your finger with linseed oil and put 
a few spots on the surface of the rubber with it. The 
oil will lubricate the rubbing surface and facilitate the 
polishing. Do this whenever the polish begins to pull. 
Be sure that the cause of this is not in your using too 
dry a rubber. The point at which the novice may fail
-P-A-G-E-93
  
FRENCH-POLISHING 93 
is that he will be inclined to use too much oil on the 
rubber. Remember that oil has no place in French- 
polish—even though many writers on the subject seem 
to think so—and that all the oil which has been used 
in the work must be ‘‘spirited out’’ of the work before 
it will assume a polish. The less oil you use the easier 
and better will be your final result. Enough oil will 
be held on the cork of a small bottle for use at any 
one time. Poppy oil is held by some to be a better 
lubricant for French-polishing than linseed oil, but I 
have always been able to get excellent results with the 
latter. 
77. Smoothing the Polish—The polish which has 
been applied in the prescribed manner will now be full 
of ridges and circular lines which the rubber has left in 
its path. These must now be removed. First allow the 
body of polish to harden thoroly. It is much better if 
this can be left a day or more before the next opera- 
tion is commenced. Any undue haste in the matter 
will end disastrously. First be sure that your rub- 
ber is in good condition, with a smooth surface and 
firm shape. If the rubber you have been using has 
become frayed or otherwise injured use a new one. 
Or if the old one has been allowed to become hard it 
may be softened with alcohol or discarded. This time 
use a thinner shellac, for the purpose is not now to 
build up a polish but to smooth down that which has 
already been applied. If prepared shellac is used, 
thin this to the consistency of milk, with about an 
equal part of grain or denatured alcohol, and stir the 
compound well. Remove the cone from the rubber and 
apply only a little polish to it, not nearly so much as 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
94 WOOD-FINISHING 
before, and wrap it up. A little oil should be applied 
to the sole of it and the rubbing begun lightly with a 
circular motion in the opposite direction to that which 
was used before. This will help to sraooth down the 
ridges left by the former process. On no account rub 
the work in straight forward and backward move- 
ments. This will invariably pick up the polish at the 
ends of the strokes. Look at the sole of the rubber 
often to see whether or not it is shiny. If it is, you 
are using too much oil. Change the cone to another 
place in the muslin wrapping, decrease the amount of 
oil used, and rub as before. Do not allow the rubber 
to become very dry in this part of the process, and 
do not attempt to smooth a soft part of the surface 
by pressing harder on the rubber. This part of the 
polishing will take quite a long time, and each rub- 
bing must be followed by a drying interval. Never 
continue to work on a ‘‘tacky’’ or sticky surface. It 
is only a waste of time. When the surface of your 
work is quite smooth, set it aside to dry for a day or 
even longer. It will then be ready for the final or 
“‘spiriting out’’ process. 
78. Spiriting Out—The same rubber which was 
used for the last process may again be used if it is 
smooth and soft, but the novice will generally do well to 
make a new one. The purpose now is to remove all the 
oil from the polish and to make a beautiful burnished 
surface, free from all rubber marks and flaws. No 
polish is generally used in this procedure, but the 
cone of the rubber is just perceptibly moistened with 
pure alcohol. I must repeat the injunction concern- 
ing the amount of alcohol to be used. This part of
-P-A-G-E-95
  FRENCH-POLISHING 95 
the polishing is longest and most tedious, and the nat- 
ural thing for the student to do is to use too much 
aleohol on the rubber. A good way to gage the 
amount to be used is to place the palm of the hand 
over the bottle of aleohol and shake it once so that 
the alcohol moistens the palm. Then dab the sole of 
the rubber upon the moistened palm and rub the pol- 
ish, as before, with a rotary motion. Do not use any 
oil in this process. Rub with a firm, brisk movement, 
but never continue the friction after the surface feels 
sticky. If you are in doubt about the amount of alco- 
hol to be used, remember that it is better to vary on 
the side of more caution. Better too dry a rubber 
than one which is too moist. Take time in polishing, 
allowing the work to dry frequently. The beauty of 
the polish is now at stake; you may make it or mar it. 
79, The German Acid Finish—After the polish has 
been bodied up and smoothed, another manner of 
spiriting out may be used. Instead of spirits, acid is 
used, and for this reason the process is termed the 
‘acid finish.’”? German workmen, I believe, perfected 
this treatment. The process is accomplished as fol- 
lows: Make a solution of one ounce of sulphuric acid 
and ten ounces of water. Sprinkle the surface to be 
polished with fine chalk which has been sifted thru a 
very fine sieve. Barely moisten the surface of a 
piece of fine chamois skin with the sulphuric solution, 
and polish as in French-polishing, with a rotary move- 
ment. The chalk absorbs the oil as it is drawn out 
of the polish, and a beautiful brilliancy ensues. The 
same amount of care will have to be taken in this 
process as in spiriting out.
-P-A-G-E-96
96 WOOD-FINISHING 
80. The Egg-Shell Gloss.—If one does not wish the 
high polish that has been attained by the previous 
methods, he may dull it by rubbing the surface with 
a piece of felt, such as was described in Sec. 54, 
which has been dipped in raw oil and its rubbing sur- 
face sprinkled with very fine pumice stone. A coarse 
piece of felt will scratch the polish. Rub first with a 
cireular motion and finish with straight forward and 
backward strokes. If a finer gloss is desired rotten 
stone may be used instead of pumice stone, but the 
process will be lengthened considerably. Rather more 
pressure will be needed in rubbing shellac than in rub- 
bing varnish, as the former is a much harder polish. 
81. Matching with Polish—Very often unsightly 
variations in the color of wood will be noticed after 
the first coats of polish are given to the work. This 
need not alarm the beginner. Different shades of 
browns and reds may be obtained by mixing burnt um- 
ber (a dark brown powder), or burnt sienna (a powder 
varying from reddish brown to light red color), alka- 
net root (a dark red color), and drop black, with a 
thin shellac. A little experimenting with these colors 
will soon give a student a good idea of the results he 
may obtain with their use. When the desired shade 
has been obtained dip a small soft brush (a camel’s 
hair brush is recommended. for this work) into the 
colored polish and carefully match the color and grain 
of the wood. This operation should take place just 
before the smoothing process is begun. It is better to 
match the grain by applying several coats of lighter 
colored polish than it is to try to accomplish the result 
with one heavy coat. The heavy application is apt
-P-A-G-E-97
  i FRENCH-POLISHING | 97 
to be rubbed off or smeared over the surface by the 
action of the polishing rubber. Allow each coat’ to 
dry thoroly before putting on another. Then polish 
as before suggested with the uncolored polish. 
82. Keeping Polishing Rubbers.—If polishing rub- 
bers are to be kept, they should not be allowed to dry 
out, but should be placed in an air-tight tin or bottle 
in which has been poured a few drops of alcohol. Old 
rubbers are better than new if they are kept in good 
condition, but once they have been allowed to become 
hard it will not be worth the time to restore them. 
83. Care of Brushes.—Brushes which have been 
used in shellac may not be left in water or turpentine, 
as is sometimes done, but should be cleaned out with 
wood alcohol thoroly each time that they are used, or 
better still, suspended in the manner suggested for var- 
nish brushes (Sec. 50) in aleohol or very weak shellac. 
Shellac, if it is permitted to harden in the brush, is 
difficult to remove, and will usually impair the value 
of the bristles. The care of brushes should be given 
far more attention than is usually done in manual 
training shops. ;

CHAPTER VIII 
EXNAMELING 
84, Proper Use of Enamel.—Fnamel as a finish has 
of recent years become so popular that no treatise 
on wood finishing would be complete without including 
it. Enameling really belongs to the subject of var- 
nishing as it is a varnish, but it differs from ordinary 
varnishing in that the material used is opaque. Enamel 
has the brittleness of a piano varnish and the bril- 
lianey that is given by a hard resinous gum. Very 
beautiful effects may be obtained with different col- 
ored enamels, especially when they are used as stencil 
colors, light upon dark, or dark upon light. As enamel 
is opaque, it is folly to use it over expensive woods. 
Maple, birch, pine, and poplar are well adapted to this 
treatment, and the more expensive woods may be cor- 
respondingly saved by using these frequently. The 
student may be led to believe that enameling is a cheap 
class of work and unworthy of his time and efforts. 
That may or may not be true. Enamel of course does 
not compare with oil or French polish in the matter 
of expense, but all the luster and softness of a high- 
grade varnish may be obtained by using it carefully. 
85. Applying Enamel.—The student should not con- 
fuse this process of enameling with a different one 
which is used extensively in Europe, that of ‘‘spirit- 
enameling.’’, The enamels which I am speaking of are 
prepared in oil like a varnish, the spirit enamels are 
prepared in alcohol, and are adapted especially to a 
98
-P-A-G-E-99
  ENA MELING 99 
final French-polishing. For the present the varnish 
enamels will claim our attention, as these are more 
common. 
Prepare the surface of the wood very carefully, 
sandpapering first with No. 1 sandpaper and finish- 
ing off with No. 0, rubbing always (except on the 
  
  Fic. 16. Enameled table. 
ends) in the direction of the grain of the wood. When 
this has been done and all holes in the wood carefully 
filled with sealing wax, give the wood one or two coats 
of white shellac. Orange shellac will do if the enamel- 
ing is to be done in dark colors. Allow the first coat 
of shellac an hour to dry and rub it: down smooth with 
No. 00 sandpaper, rubbing with the grain. The shellac 
used should be quite thin, only about half as thick as 
the shellac bought in prepared or liquid form. To thin 
shellac add one part of denatured alcohol to three parts 
of shellac. Do not attempt to use the thick, heavy
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 WOOD-FINISHING 
shellac as it will not flow like varnish, but will be- 
come sticky under the brush and harden in heavy 
ridges which will require a great deal of rubbing with 
sandpaper to obliterate. If a great deal of the first 
coat of shellac has sunk into the wood, so that the 
surface appears dry, apply a second coat, rubbing this 
down as you did the first. When you have finished 
rubbing the shellac (and be sure that it is perfectly 
dry before it is rubbed), apply a coat of enamel prim- 
ing white or other good undercoating for enamel. 
Here again I may make a few suggestions which will 
save a great deal of time and work.: If you have a 
large surface, such as a table top, to enamel, use a 
good two and one-half inch bevelled-tip varnish brush, 
one which has the bristles set in rubber. Be sure that 
this is perfectly clean. If a new brush is used, soak 
it in water over night to ‘‘set’’ the bristles, and then 
dry. it thoroly before using it. Never use a brush 
which sheds its bristles. If, on the other hand, small 
pieces of work are to be enameled, use a smaller 
brush. 
Allow this under coat at least a day to dry, and 
then rub it down to a smooth surface with No. 00 sand- 
paper. Dust off the surface well, and apply a coat of 
enamel of the shade desired for the final finish. The 
same caution should be maintained in applying this 
coat as the former. If the enamel is thick, thin it with 
good turpentine to the consistency of varnish. Avoid 
as before all over-lapping and brush marks on the sur- 
face. If the enamel does not dry in two days to a per- 
fectly hard surface, add a little turpentine to the next 
coat. This will assist it. But do not thin the enamel
-P-A-G-E-101
ENAMELING 101 
to a watery consistency with the turpentine or the 
luster of the enamel will be impaired. When this coat 
is dry, procure a piece of felt such as was described 
for rubbing down varnish, Sec. 54, moisten the 
rubbing surface of it with water, sprinkle over this 
a small quantity.of fine pumice stone, and rub the 
enamel with a circular motion, adding water and 
pumice occasionally so as to keep always a well mois- 
tened_ surface on the felt. Rub until a smooth sur- 
face is obtained, then dry the enamel well before apply- 
ing the third coat. It is usually well to allow a surface 
that has been rubbed a few hours to dry before apply- 
ing more varnish or enamel. 
The third coat is also of the color desired, and is 
applied in the same manner as the second. It must 
also be left to harden completely. Remember that 
enamel or varnish often appears: quite hard to the 
touch, but that under the surface the oil is still soft. 
If you rub enamel in this condition you will merely 
grind the pumice stone into the soft gum and no 
amount of subsequent rubbing will produce a polish. 
The method of producing a high gloss is like that given 
to the former coat. If the wood is particularly open- 
grained or porous so that the enamel seems apt to 
sink into it, use two coats of the enamel priming white 
instead of the one suggested at first. Poplar or pine 
especially may require this, even after two coats of 
shellac have been applied. In either case the method 
is the same, each coat being allowed to dry well, and 
then rubbed down with fine sandpaper. The final coat 
is always, except in the cheapest work, rubbed to a 
gloss with pumice stone or rotten stone and water.

Fig. 16 shows an enameled table where a stencil has 
been used. 
86. A Word of Warning.—If the piece that is to be 
enameled has been at one time painted, varnished, or 
enameled, all the former finish must be carefully 
removed before the new finish is applied. If this is not 
done, the enamel will scale and chip off or show in 
patches and ridges the unevenness of the old finish. 
The easiest way to remove old finish of any kind is 
with a commercial varnish remover which may be 
bought at any paint shop or hardware store. It is 
applied to the surface to be removed and allowed a few 
minutes to soften the old finish. This may then be 
removed with a stiff brush, scraper, or heavy cloth. It 
may often require several coats of the varnish remover 
to soften all the old matter, but it must all be removed 
before any finishing is attempted. If there is quite a 
lot of varnish to be removed, one may not wish to go 
to the expense of buying a large amount of commercial 
remover. A mixture of one part of banana liquid and 
two parts of wood alcohol makes a good remover which 
possesses the additional quality of safety so necessary 
for amateur use. It is well to remember in removing 
varnish: that the several layers of old gum should be 
softened completely before any of them are removed. 
The reason for saying this is, that almost any varnish 
remover is quite expensive when it is used in quanti- 
ties. The fewer coats of it that are used the less will 
be the expense of the operation. If, then, after one 
coat of remover has been applied to the surface, the 
varnish does not become quite soft, it is well to apply 
another coat before attempting to remove any of the
-P-A-G-E-103
  
ENAMELING 103 
old gum at all. This will soften the old coats right 
down to the wood, and the whole mass may be removed 
with a saving of time and of material. Wood alcohol 
and banana liquid are very volatile, and therefore 
should be kept in well-corked bottles. Turpentine or 
alcohol alone will usually soften varnish so that it may 
be removed.

  CHAPTER IX 
STENCILING 
87. Application of Stenciling.—So many beautiful 
effects may be obtained upon common woods finished 
with good interior paint or enamel in stencilled designs 
that a chapter on this art seems appropriate. Furniture 
has for a long time been painted, even at the direction 
of masters of cabinet work and design. And, strange 
tho it may seem to the student who thinks of furniture 
in terms of wood values alone, this painting was very 
often done over choice mahogany. This would seem 
a great extravagance to us, yet the wood used and the 
finish. applied were two separate things to the minds 
of these men. Mahogany was used not so much because 
of its exquisite beauty as because of its strength and 
rigidity. Paint was applied to the wood to obtain a 
mellow and even color. Today there is an increasing 
demand for breakfast-room furniture, sun-parlor fur- 
niture, porch furniture, and wooden novelties of bright 
and airy color, and we have in this country woods 
which seem particularly well adapted to this treatment. 
See Fig. 16. Even bedroom furniture of this kind is 
coming into demand. 
A little study in color harmony will repay the student 
if a great variety of colors is to be used. For ordinary 
work in two or three colors, however, a sense of appro- 
priateness will be sufficient. For this work a knowl- 
edge of stencils will be necessary. 
88. Stencils.—Stencils may be bought or made. The 
process of making simple stencils is so easy that every 
104  
-P-A-G-E-105
STENCILING 105 
student should make a few of his own design to enable 
him to see the possibilities of them in decorative work. 
A suitable design is traced on a piece of heavy brown 
paper with a carbon paper. The part to be colored, 
_ that is the decorative part or design, is cut out of the 
paper with scissors or the sharp point of a knife. The 
edges of the design will be much more smoothly cut if 
the paper is placed upon a piece of glass while the cut- 
KON 
WA 2 NK Fic. in 7. Stencils 
ting is being done. Wood under the paper allows the 
knife to force its way too far, and tears the edges of 
the design. The factor to remember in cutting a sten- 
cil is that the parts of the design are not completely 
joined together. Small points*‘or connecting pieces of 
paper are left to give the work rigidity. See Fig. 17. 
If, for example, a conventionalized design of a tree or 
flower is being made, the limbs or branches will not 
quite meet the trunk or central stalk. So also the 
petals of a flower will not quite meet the central axis, 
nor the leaves and branches. These minute parts 
which are left in the design are called ties. The illus- 
trative designs offered, Fig. 17, will make the meaning
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 WOOD-FINISHING 
clear. It is safe to say that realistic designs are sel- 
dom used in stencils. Geometrical figures, convention- 
alized forms of natural objects are commonly used. 
If the stencil to be made is one, such as a tree, which 
has a central trunk with a similar distribution of 
branches on either side, the easiest method of cutting 
it is to fold the paper and cut the design thru the two 
plies which when opened will appear as a duplicated 
design of branches radiating from the central trunk 
or fold in the paper. 
89. Treating the Stencil.—After the stencil is com- 
plete, it should be pressed out smooth and dipped in 
hot paraffin to stiffen it and to keep the oil in the paint 
from softening it. This is essential to good work. Lay 
the stencil on a flat surface until it is dry. 
90. Coloring the Design—After the stencil is dry 
it may be fastened in the position it is to occupy with 
any easily soluble paste. The color or colors, which 
should be rich and of the consistency of varnish, are 
then rubbed on or painted with a regular stencil brush 
or a clean shaving brush which has been cut off so that 
only an inch of the bristles remains. This will work 
into the corners of the design well. Enamels of differ- 
ent colors, good interior paint, or colored French-pol- 
ish may be used. Enamel over enamel, and paint over 
paint, depending upon which has been used for the 
finish of the piece, are best. Do not remove the paper 
until the decorated part is dry. Then, if the color is 
not sufficiently opaque, a second coat may be applied. 
The stencil is, of course, applied only after all finishing 
and rubbing has been done to the main part of the 
work. When the design is completely dry remove the
-P-A-G-E-107
  STENCILING 107 
stencil and give the whole work a coat of good trans- 
parent varnish. This is necessary to hold the color. 
The varnish should then be rubbed down, as has been 
suggested, with pumice stone and water, care being 
taken not to rub hard over the design for fear of cut- 
ting thru the coating of varnish. 
91. Other Uses of Stencils.—The decorative possi- 
bilities of stencils are almost unlimited. For instance 
different effects may be obtained by blocking out differ- 
ent portions of work that are being stained prepara- 
tory to varnishing or French-polishing. The major 
part of the work may be stained a dark brown, while 
the design may be barely tinted with a very light 
brown stain. In this case, however, the figure to be 
left is pasted on the work and the remainder of the 
wood stained a dark color and left to dry. When the 
paper is removed the part that has been preserved is 
treated to a very mild stain, and the whole given a coat 
of orange shellac to hold the color. Consider, too, the 
possibilities of decorative fuming. Any design that 
is cut out of paper, waxed, and fastened to the oak will 
be preserved in the natural color of the wood. The wax 
keeps the fumes from entering the paper. The design 
may then be given a little toning with a weak stain in 
some shade of brown so that it may harmonize well 
with the rest of the wood, or it may be left in the nat- 
ural color. Such wood will not, of course, be filled with 
anything except shellac. Or in the case of oak will not 
require filling other than one or two coats of shellac 
preliminary to wax-polishing. 
92. Transfers.—Altho the subject of transfers does 
not come properly under the heading of stencils, its
-P-A-G-E-108
  
108 WOOD-FINISHING 
use is so similar that I may include it at this time. 
Transfers are used in somewhat the same manner as 
those we used to put on our school books. First moisten 
the surface which is to be decorated, with water. Then 
give the face of the transfer a thin (a very thin) coat 
of transfer cement, using for this purpose a camel hair 
brush. Wait a few moments until the cement is tacky, 
or until it has dried enough so that the fingers may be

run oyer it without removing any of the cement. Lay 
the transfer with the cement side down, and smooth 
it out lightly and quickly. This part of the process is 
of most importance. Now wet the back of the transfer 
and roll it with a small roller for a few moments. 
Remove the paper carefully, beginning with one cor- 
ner, and press the design on well with a wet sponge. 
Dry it gently with a dry chamois and clean away the 
cement or varnish stains around the design carefully 
with a soft cloth moistened with water. Fig. 16 shows 
a stencil applied. Figs. 18 and 19 show a realistic and 
a conventional type of transfer respectively.
-P-A-G-E-109

The transfer is, of course, affixed after all the stain- 
ing and polishing or varnishing are finished except the 
final coat. Do not attempt to use French-polish directly 
over the transfer lest the design be loosened. Apply

Rerinisuine Ord FurNITURE 
93. Reclaiming Old Furniture—The problem of 
refinishing furniture, and indeed of all interior wood- 
work is one which comes up constantly. There is a 
great deal of good furniture which needs only a little 
repair in construction and a new finish to make it 
quite presentable. Occasionally a valuable piece is 
found in almost hopeless condition, and very often 
this piece has some historical value that endears it to 
the minds of those who know. The high-school student 
should be able to repair this and to refinish it, unless 
it is too far gone. 
94, Painted Furniture or Interior Woodwork.—The 
first thing to do with wood of this kind is to remove all 
the old paint. The easiest method of doing this is to 
hold a gasoline blow torch so that the flame will blister 
the paint. Be careful not to burn the wood. The 
operation is not, however, a delicate one, and almost 
any one may try it with success. A steel scraper with 
one corner rounded so that it will fit into concave sur- 
faces is necessary to remove the blistered paint. The 
work should then be washed down with warm water ~ 
and strong lye soap, and allowed to dry. If the surface 
of the wood rises because of the action of the water, 
it may be rubbed down with No. 0 or No. 1 sandpaper. 
The wood must be perfectly dry before an attempt is 
made to apply paint or varnish. The temperature of 
the room should be neither too low nor too high for 
110
-P-A-G-E-111
  
REFINISHING OLD FURNITURE JT 
varnishing or painting; between 70 and 85 degrees is 
suitable. 
95. If the Surface Is To Be Repainted.—Very often 
yellow pine or fir has been used for interior wood- 
work. These are very resinous woods, especially the 
knots of them. If paint is applied directly to such a 
surface it will frequently turn brown and blister off 
because of the exudation of the resin in the wood. To 
avoid this it is always safe to cover all resinous parts 
of the wood with a coat of shellac. In new wood this 
is absolutely necessary, and.in old wood it is much 
safer. After the shellac has dried (this will take at 
least an hour) apply a priming coat of paint which 
contains a good percentage of white lead or, even 
better, of lithopone. 
Perhaps I had better repeat at this time the state- 
ment I have made. In a volume of this size I cannot 
hope to deal with all the varieties of paints, oils, pig- 
ments, driers which are used and recommended. We 
are concerned here chiefly with indoor finishes and 
with the best ingredients with which to make them. If 
the student masters these he will have little difficulty 
in changing his ingredients or the proportions of them 
to suit special needs. 
96. Composition of Paints.—Paints are composed 
principally of linseed oil; white lead, or zinc white, or 
lithopone as the base; colors, such as the umbers, 
siennas, ochres, chromes, lamp black or drop black, and 
Vandyke brown; and driers, such as litharge, turpen- 
tine, and zine sulphate, the best of which to use with 
linseed oil is, in general, turpentine. These, you see, 
are oil, base, color (unnecessary to white paint), and 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
112 : WOOD-FINISHING 
driers. Commercial paints often contain too much 
drier. 
97. The First or Priming Coat—With this in mind 
let us return to the priming coat mentioned above. If 
you wish to make this, put from eight to ten pounds 
of white lead (or lithopone) into a can; to this add, a’ 
little at a time, 14 gallon of pure raw linseed oil, stir- 
ring the ingredients continually until they are well 
mixed; now thin this with about 14 gallon of pure tur- 
pentine. No color is, of course, needed in this under- 
coat. Just before you use the paint, add to it two or 
three tablespoonfuls of best quality turpentine driers. 
Sandpaper between coats. 
98. The Second Coat.—The second coat should con- 
tain little or no oil if white or very light colors are 
used. The oil tends to turn yellow unless it is exposed 
to the direct rays of the sun. Mix the lead with tur- 
pentine only. This will make a flat or dulled finish. 
Oil makes gloss. If the paint is to be colored dark, the 
second coat should contain much more oil and much 
less turpentine than the priming coat. A pint of tur- 
pentine and 1% to 34 of a gallon of oil will be about the 
right proportions for mixing eight pounds of lead. The 
color should be added to the oil and lead before the tur- 
pentine. 
99. Third Coat.—The third coat will be merely 
white lead or lithopone, turpentine, and driers as in the 
second coat, if a pure white flat finish is desired. If, 
however, a gloss white is desired you will do well to 
make this coat by mixing 4 pounds of zine white in a 
gallon of damar varnish. In place of this a third coat 
of the flat white paint may be applied and a final coat
-P-A-G-E-113
REFINISHING OLD FURNITURE 113 
of transparent varnish over this. This may, of 
course, be done with colored paint also. 
Colored enamel varnishes which will make a satis- 
factory finishing coat are obtainable on the market. 
These are applied in the same manner as clear varnish. 
When they are to be used the undercoat should be col- 
ored approximately to match the color of the varnish. 
100. Rubbing Down Final Coat.—A finer finish will 
be made if the last two coats of paint, or the last coat 
of paint and the varnish coat, are rubbed down with 
pumice stone and water. If rubbing is to be done the 
paint and varnish must be allowed to dry thoroly 
before it is attempted. I cannot insist upon this too 
often. It is one of the commonest mistakes of ama- 
teurs and professionals. <A final rub with a cloth 
dampened in oil will remove the pumice stone from the 
surface and leave it a beautiful gloss. I may add, in 
conclusion, that the best interior painting consists of 
four coats, the last of which may be varnish. It is 
always well to strain all paint thru a doubled piece of 
cheese cloth before using it. 
101. If the Old Surface Is To Be Varnished.— 
Remove the old paint in the manner suggested above. 
In this case, however, more care will have to be exer- 
cised in ridding the wood of all discoloration which the 
old oil has caused. In places where the stain or oil 
seems to stick fast use some commercial varnish and 
paint remover, or an application of wood alcohol will 
often serve, to soften the paint. If there are holes, 
they must be filled with a paste of fine sawdust and 
glue; a slight indentation may be removed with the 
seraper, but this abraded part must be smoothed 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  
114 WOOD-FINISHING 
before any stain is applied. Grease or ink spots or 
discoloration of any kind may be removed by an appli- 
cation of a weak oxalic acid solution. When the wood 
is thus freed from all the old paint, it may be washed 
off with strong soap and hot water. This should be 
done before the holes are filled, if a glue paste is used. 
When the surface is thoroly dry, the stain may be 
applied. Altho all the surface coating has been 
removed, the pores of the wood are still, to a certain 
extent, filled with the old filler. Because of this a 
water stain is not often advisable. I suggest that a 
spirit stain be used in this case. It is best applied on 
such a surface, not with a brush, but with a small wad 
of cotton cloth. Upon resinous woods such as firs and 
pines a spirit stain will penetrate where a water stain 
will not. Match the color as evenly as possible and 
allow the work to dry. A coat of thin shellac may then 
be applied to ‘‘fasten’’ the color, or, in case a consid- 
erable amount of work is to be done, a coat of liquid 
filler may be substituted. The shellac is better, how- 
ever, for general purposes. This must be rubbed down 
with fine sandpaper, dusted off with a clean cloth, and 
the finishing done in one of the ways which have been 
minutely described under the different ways of wood- 
finishing. It is very difficult to finish in natural color 
woods which have been formerly painted. Light- 
colored woods should be stained; the dark woods may 
be successfully finished without staining if it is desired. 
102. Refinishing Old Varnished Woodwork.—There 
is no permanent remedy for ‘‘checked’’ varnish and 
cracked paint except to remove the old finish and to 
apply a new one. Old varnish may be removed most
-P-A-G-E-115
REFINISHING OLD FURNITURE 115 
easily with a commercial varnish remover. The sur- 
face must then be well rubbed down with fine sand- 
paper, dusted and restained. When the stain is’ dry 
the wood should be re-filled with either a paste filler if 
it is open grained, or with a liquid filler if it is close 
grained. These two classes of fillers have already been 
explained in Chapter ITI of this book, and so I shall not 
repeat the description. The wood may then be finished 
in any of the ways that have been described. A spirit 
stain rather than a water stain is recommended for 
restaining. After the wood has been cleaned as 
described refinishing may be done in about the same 
manner as finishing on new wood. 
103. Automobile Refinishing. —The problem of 
refinishing automobiles is one which scarcely comes 
within the scope of this work, yet I have ventured to 
include it because of its practicability. Before the day 
of the air brush all vehicles were finished by the use 
of a hair brush. As many as eighteen coats were 
applied to a piece of work. Each coat was rubbed 
down carefully before the next was put on. This was,. 
of course, a slow process. Today seven or eight coats, 
indeea often fewer, are sufficient. 
T feel sure that few, if any, of the readers will wish 
to take the time and go to the expense of applying 
more than four or five coats to a car. With a little 
care, however, one should be able to make the ‘‘old 
boat’’ take on quite a presentable appearance. 
The first thing to do is to wash all mud and dirt off 
the car. Then all the old enamel must be removed. 
This must not be done in a slipshod manner. A good 
and cheap compound which will remove paint, varnish,
-P-A-G-E-116
    
116 WOOD-FINISHING 
or enamel from metal may be made by mixing together 
five pounds of ordinary flour, three pounds of lye, and 
enough water to make a thin paste. Apply this to the 
coating to be removed and allow it to stand for five 
minutes or longer. The old coat may then be removed 
easily with a dull tool. The chief difficulty may be had 
in taking the enamel off the hood, but the same remover 
will do it if you leave it on the surface for an hour. 
Even the hardest baked enamel finish will yield to this 
remover. Care must be taken not to get the remover 
on the hands or clothes. The car should then be 
washed off well with benzine or high-test gasoline. 
Ordinary gasoline will leave the surface greasy. 
The night before the refinishing is to be done, wet 
the walls, floor, and ceiling of the garage. This must 
be done to settle the dust. Remember that half the 
success of finishing depends upon suitable conditions. 
The car must be perfectly dry before any enamelling 
is done. It is necessary to have a free circulation of 
air where varnish or enamel is drying, but there must 
not be a draft to blow dust upon the wet coat. If the 
windows of the garage are left open, tack a piece of 
wet muslin over them. This will permit the air to 
enter, but it will exclude the dust which would mar the 
finish. ‘ 
It is well to have at least two brushes, and these 
should be of good quality. One of these may be three 
inches wide, the other about three-quarters of an inch. 
The wide brush will be used for large flat surfaces, the 
narrow one for spokes, rims, and other fine work. I 
must repeat the injunction which I have made in this 
book: do not use new brushes without cleaning them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  
REFINISHING OLD FURNITURE 117 
New brushes are not clean. They must always be 
washed in turpentine and allowed to dry before they 
are used. Dust and loose hairs may be removed, to 
some extent, by rolling the handle of the brush vigor- 
ously between the palms of the hands. 
‘When everything is ready a coat of ‘‘flat undercoat- 
ing,’’ such as is made for this purpose, may be applied. 
This should be allowed at least forty-eight hours to 
dry, after which a second coat of the same may be 
given to the work. When this coat is thoroly dry, not 
before two days, it should be rubbed lightly with No. 
0 sandpaper. This will eut off the tops of any dust 
particles which have entered the coat. The car should 
again be wiped off with a clean cloth moistened with 
benzinie. : 
At least two coats of automobile enamel should be 
applied. These must not be thick and heavy. The 
enamel should flow freely from under the brush. In 
applying either varnish or enamel, the less brushing 
that is done the better. This is what the painter means 
by ‘‘flowing on a coat.’? Any excess which may run 
to the bottom or corners of the work may be picked 
up on the brush. A cold, damp garage is no place in 
which to do enamelling. The atmosphere should be 
moderately dry and of a temperature between seventy 
and eighty degrees Fahrenheit. Enamel will flow much 
better if the can is placed in a dish of warm water 
while it is being used, care being taken not to overheat 
it. The first coat may be sufficiently dry to rub down 
within two days, but it is well not to attempt to hasten 
it. Enamel and varnish may feel hard to the touch and 
yet be quite soft underneath. For this reason, unless  
-P-A-G-E-118
118 WOOD-FINISHING 
there is urgent need for the car, a few days longer give 
a better rubbing surface. 
The first coat of enamel may be rubbed down with 
No. 00 sandpaper (never with steel wool), and the sur- 
face wiped off as before with a cloth dampened with 
benzine. The second coat should be applied in the same 
manner. This coat should, however, be rubbed down 
with pumice stone. To do this procure a piece of 
harness-maker’s felt about four or five inches square, 
wet it thoroly with water, and rub first with a circular 
motion and finally backward and forward the surface 
which has to be sprinkled lightly with pumice. Use a 
fine grade of pumice and be careful lest you rub thru 
the enamel coating. Pumice stone cuts quite rapidly, 
and more harm than good will result from a careless 
use of it. When the surface is well polished wipe off 
the work, this time very carefully, and remove any 
pumice which may remain in corners. 
The last process is to ‘‘flow on’’ a coat of good 
weatherproof varnish. Brushes should be well cleaned 
before this is done, and the utmost care should be exer- 
cised in ridding the garage of dust by wetting the 
floor, walls, and ceiling again.’ This last coat is not 
rubbed down, and so one has no opportunity to remove 
specks of dust which have entered it.

104. Apple—This wood is especially adapted to 
ebonizing. It has but little place in cabinet work on 
account of its greater value as a fruit tree and its 
scarcity as a commercial wood. It is very close grained 
and susceptible to fine polishing. 
105. Basswood.—A considerable quantity of this 
wood is used in cheaper cabinet work. It is close 
grained, very soft, quite free from knots, and takes 
stain well. It is frequently used to imitate mahogany, 
but other woods are perhaps better adapted to this 
purpose. 
106. Beech.—Imitation walnut and mahogany are 
sometimes made from this wood, but it does not seem 
adapted to this purpose because of its prominent 
figure. These are, as in oak, the medullary rays of the 
wood. They are finer than those of oak, but very hard 
and impervious to stain. It is perhaps best left un- - 
stained, and finished in the natural wood. 
107. Birch—Birch has had for some time an 
increasing demand in the furniture industry. There 
are three kinds of it common to North America: white 
birch, yellow birch, and red birch. These are all valu- 
able woods, but of the three the one most common to 
furniture is the last. This timber has a beautiful 
reddish brown color, in some respects similar to 
that of cherry, altho usually not so dark. The 
wood, too, is not so close grained as that of cherry. 
119
-P-A-G-E-120
120 WOOD-FINISHING 
The best imitation of mahogany may be made from 
bireh. 
To stain birch a rich plum color apply a solution 
composed of four tablespoonfuls of potassium bichro- 
mate dissolved in a quart of water. Allow this to dry, 
and rub the wood down with fine sandpaper. The 
fibers of birch rise very readily under water stains. 
Then make a solution of equal parts of Vandyke brown 
and burnt sienna dissolved in such quantity of hot 
water as to make the desired shade. Apply this hot to 
the wood and allow it to dry. You will notice that the 
grain of the wood has risen considerably again. This 
time do not use a special wood filler but apply a coat 
of thin shellac, either orange or white. I may add that 
any filler except shellac is injurious to good clear 
effects upon maple, pine, poplar, gum, and birch. 
When the shellac has dried upon the birch the wood 
fibers, which have risen a second time because of the 
water stain, may be rubbed down to a good smooth 
surface. The work may then be finished with French- 
polish or varnish. 
To stain birch brown mahogany, apply to the wood 
a solution of brown bichromate of potash such as was 
suggested above. When this is dry, rub down the 
roughness and apply a brown oak water stain which 
has been weakened a little more than is customary by 
adding more water. This stain should have little if 
any reddish tone. If the brown oak stain is used in 
full strength it will make the birch too dark. In this 
case it is better to make the desired color by several 
weak coats of stain than with one strong coat. Suc- 
cessive applications of bichromate of potash solution

WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 121 
alone will have a darkening effect upon the wood which 
appears as different shades of brown under polish, 
depending upon the strength of the solution. If 
orange shellac is used in finishing, either as varnish 
or as French-polish, the effect of the work will be 
better. Over the stain should be applied at least one 
coat of shellac. Use no filler or oil. 
To finish birch in the natural color, use no oil, filler, 
or varnish. ‘The best, and indeed the only correct way 
to do this is with pure bleached shellac. By some, a 
Damar varnish is used over bleached shellac, but this 
is not satisfactory because of the softness of this kind 
of varnish. 
If birch and mahogany are used together in wood- 
work the easiest way to match the two is to apply one 
coat of stain to the birch alone. Use no filler on the 
birch but fill the mahogany if you wish. When the 
stain is dry, rub down the surface roughness and apply 
to the whole work, mahogany and birch, another coat 
of stain. This will match the color well. Finish the 
work in any manner after applying and rubbing down 
a coat of shellac. This manner of matching woods 
which are at all akin to each other may be followed with 
satisfactory results. 
108. Cedar.—Of the many kinds of cedars used in 
woodworking only a few are of interest to the cabinet- 
maker. The mahoganies and the cedars are so closely 
related that it often requires an expert to determine 
which is true mahogany and which is not. Indeed a 
great deal of the wood which is sold under the name of 
mahogany is cedar from Central and South America. 
The wood of this cedar is a brownish red or reddish  
-P-A-G-E-122
122 WOOD-FINISHING 
brown color, with alternate light and dark stripes like 
mahogany, but it is lighter in weight and softer in 
composition than mahogany. This cedar is not, how- 
ever, to be despised as an imitation. It is often a good 
wood for furniture making, and can be made, by the art 
of the French-polisher, to resemble mahogany more 
nearly than any other wood. It lacks, however, the 
strength and firmness of the other wood. 
Red cedar has for some time been prized as a beauti- 
ful wood. Its use is now almost entirely confined to 
the making of chests and the lining of drawers in 
expensive furniture. It has a pleasant odor and a 
beautiful light red color, and is considered immune 
from the invasion of moths and other insects. It is 
close grained and soft in texture, and takes a high 
polish. On no account should filler, stain, or varnish 
be applied directly to the wood. Knots, which are quite 
common to it, should be well smoothed with a sharp 
steel scraper, and any cracks in them filled with a cor- 
rectly colored wax-stopping such as has been sug- 
gested in Chapter I. A glue and sawdust paste, col- 
ored suitably, will also be satisfactory. The work 
should be carefully sandpapered and dusted off, and 
then given successive coats of pure bleached shellac, 
either with a brush or in the manner of French-polish- 
ing. Oil, if it is applied to the wood, will turn it an 
objectionable reddish brown color. Varnish injures 
the beauty of the wood in two ways if it is applied 
without a surfacer: the oil in the varnish darkens the 
wood in an unpleasing manner; and the color of the 
varnish, which is not really a colorless fluid at all but 
of a slightly amber color, detracts from the natural
-P-A-G-E-123
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 123 
color of the wood. If you must use varnish use it over 
two coats of pure bleached shellac which serves both 
as a surfacer and as a filler. This will prevent the dis- 
coloration of the wood which oil always effects. I may 
say as a rule for manual training shops, use nothing 
but white shellac on red cedar, and if this can ‘be 
applied as French-polish tlie work will take on a beauty 
which was not thought of before. ; 
109. Cherry.—This is a hard, close-grained wood 
of rather more uneven texture than hard maple or 
birch. The grain is not usually straight but rather 
naturally wavy. This figure is, of course, to be pre- 
served in finishing. Cherry is usually finished to imi- 
tate mahogany, but I see no reason why it should not 
be used as a wood with its own characteristics pre- 
served. Cherry is frequently finished in a bright sear- 
let color, but this does not seem to me to be adapted to 
the beauty of the wood or to its inherent qualities. It 
is a reddish brown in color, quite like Spanish cedar, 
and the natural tone of the wood gives but little reason 
for the violence with which finishers treat it when they 
color it in vivid scarlet. Just as the prevailing note in 
staining mahogany has recently changed from plum to 
deep brown, so should that of cherry be changed from 
blood red to an appropriate shade of brown. A good 
color may be obtained by coating the work with an 
application of bichromate of potash (one ounce to a 
gallon of water), allowing this to dry, and rubbing 
down the wood fibers with fine sandpaper; and then 
applying a stain composed of one ounce of Bismark 
brown, one-half ounce of burnt sienna, and two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. These should be dissolved in a
-P-A-G-E-124
124 WOOD-FINISHING 
quart of boiling water and applied warm to the wood. 
The work should be given a coat of orange shellac if 
varnish is to be applied, or better finished entirely with 
orange shellac applied with a brush or with a rubber 
as French-polish. If the shellac is to be applied with 
a brush it must be quite thin, not more than half the 
strength of commercial prepared shellac. Always use 
grain or denatured alcohol to dilute shellac. Wood 
alcohol will cause it to dry too rapidly. 
No matter how long you may sandpaper cherry you 
will notice in staining the wood that portions of it 
absorb the color more quickly than others, and become 
consequently darker. There is no way to avoid this as 
it is caused by the peculiar formation of the wood 
which in places exhibits almost an end grain. Do as 
much of the smoothing as possible with a sharp steel 
seraper. Use sandpaper sparingly, and do not apply 
the stain in heavy coats. If these more porous parts 
are thus treated they will serve to increase the beauty 
of the finish rather than to impair it. 
110. Chestnut—This open-grained wood may be 
treated in the manner suggested for brown oaks. Fill 
the wood with paste filler colored with burnt umber, 
and use varnish or orange shellac for polishing. 
111. Cypress.—Because of its resinous quality this 
wood is quite difficult to stain. This accounts, too, for 
the numberless instances in which paint and varnish 
peel off the surface of it. A water stain should be 
applied very hot to cypress. An exceptionally resinous 
portion of the wood should be treated to at least one 
coat of shellac before it is painted. Very beautiful 
hand carving is often done in cypress, the grain of 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 125 
which shows in flakes almost like sedimentary rock 
formations. This antique appearance must of course 
be finished with wax to carry out the purpose. Never 
attempt to finish or to darken this wood with oil. If 
it is to be painted, apply at least three coats of shellac 
to the wood before attempting to paint it, otherwise 
your work will be in vain. 
112. Ebony.—The natural color of ebony is seldom 
black, but rather a very dark brown. It requires a 
stain to make it the color we usually think of as ebony. 
This may be supplied easiest for the amateur by using 
black India ink. However very little if any of the gen- 
uine wood will be used in manual training work because 
of its extreme scarcity. Excellent imitations may be 
made from pear and apple woods, and the student is 
advised to use these when he wishes a pure black wood 
for decorative purposes. 
113. Fir—The commonness of this wood in interior 
work leads me to give suggestions as to its treatment. 
Fir may be stained to almost any color. It is of heavy- 
grained and resinous texture with alternate hard and 
soft ribs of fibre. The hard parts do not take stain 
very readily, especially a water stain. In preference 
use an oil or spirit stain, or even better, a chemical 
stain. Cover any knots in the wood with a coat or two 
of shellac, before applying paint or varnish to the 
surface. 
114. Gum.—There are three varieties of gum native 
to North America: red gum, tupelo, and black gum. Of 
these three the first is that which is used in cabinet- 
making. Red gum is a soft, close-grained wood which 
seems well adapted to panelling, but scarcely strong 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 WOOD-FINISHING 
enough for heavier structural work. The wood is quite 
free from knots and may be polished easily, altho it 
does not deserve the precedence it is receiving over 
many other woods. Gum holds glue very well, and as 
it is clear and straight-grained, is quite successfully 
used in veneers. Occasionally one finds pieces of it 
which have beautiful smoke-like streaks in them. Such 
wood is usually finished without staining, a coat of 
bleached shellac and two or more of varnish serving 
to bring out the mottled or streaked appearance better. 
To finish gum in a mahogany color, apply one or 
more coats of mahogany water stain, rub down the 
fibres, and finish with varnish or shellac. It is not 
necessary to use a filler on this wood if shellac is 
applied. A colored liquid filler composed of corn 
starch, burnt umber, and varnish may be applied if the 
wood is to be finished quite dark. 
115. Maple—This is one of the best woods for. cabi- 
net work. It is strong, close-grained, free from knots 
and flaws, of even texture, and takes any kind of stain 
well. As a wood for imitating mahogany few excell it, 
while the width of the boards into which it may be eut, 
makes it well adapted to veneers and ply-wood. 
There are many varieties of maple all of which are 
native to North America, but the one which is prized 
so highly in cabinet work is the rock or sugar maple. 
Different causes produce, as in mahogany, different 
formations in the grain of it, and so we have curly 
maple, and bird’s eye maple, as well as the straight- 
grained or true formation. 
To finish maple in the natural wood color, prepare 
the surface very carefully and apply a thin coat of
-P-A-G-E-127
  
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 127 
white shellac. No other filler is needed. When this 
has been dried rub down the surface with fine sand- 
paper. In this way apply two or three coats of shellac, 
but use pumice stone and water instead of sandpaper 
for rubbing. The last coat may be either white shellac 
or white copal varnish. This should be allowed to dry 
at least four days, and then rubbed to an egg-shell 
gloss with pumice stone and water. Never use varnish 
directly upon maple which is to be finished in the nat- 
ural color of the wood. 
Bird’s eye maple may be finished in the same man- 
ner, altho, if the piece of work is small, it will 
repay you to French-polish it, using white shellac. A 
high gloss should not be left on woods finished in the 
natural color. 
Curly maple may be finished in the natural wood or 
stained a dark reddish brown with propriety. It can 
searcely be said that any stain adds to the beauty of 
eurly maple. Finished with French-polish it is almost 
incomparable. 
To match mahogany with maple follow the sugges- 
tions given under the treatment of birch, Sec. 107. 
White or soft maple is esteemed for making inlays 
on account of its pure whiteness. In marquetry work 
in which colored woods are used apply only white shel- 
lac as filler and surfacer, finishing the wood with 
French-polish or pale copal varnish. 
In imitating the figure of mahogany on maple many 
methods are used. The easiest one of these for the 
student is to apply a coat of light mahogany stain to 
all of the wood. Then paint the stripes which are to 
remain light-colored with thin bleached shellac. Go 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 WOOD-FINISHING 
over the work again using a slightly stronger stain 
than that which was used before. When this is dry, 
wipe off the shellac with a cloth moistened in alcohol 
and rub down the surface with fine sandpaper. The 
work may then be filled and polished in any desired 
manner. 
116. Mahogany.—This beautiful wood, which is 
now the most valuable of commercial cabinet woods, 
comes from the West Indies, Central America, and 
West Africa. It does not grow in groves, as do gak 
and maple, but in single isolated trees which tower 
magnificently above the others of the forest. Men are 
sent out to find these, and of recent years aeroplanes 
are often used in scouting for them. A great deal of 
waste is still in evidence in felling these trees as the 
trunk is cut some feet from the ground, and the stump, 
which often contains the most beautiful wood, is left 
to rot in the ground. The so-called Spanish mahogany 
of a generation ago came from Honduras, the West 
Indies, Cuba, Haiti, and San Domingo. But of recent 
years the center of the industry has become West 
Africa. The African mahogany grows to a much 
larger size than that of the West Indies, and the exqui- 
site figuring of some of the logs brings fancy prices. 
One log a few years ago was sold in London for almost 
$8,000. 
Mahogany belongs to the cedar family of trees, and 
in cases is difficult to distinguish from some species of 
cedar. Taking advantage of this, wholesale lumber 
merchants sell a great deal of the cheaper wood as 
mahogany, altho it has not the strength and rigidity 
of that wood. At present the Cuban wood is more val-
-P-A-G-E-129
  
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 129 
uable than the San Domingo or the Honduras, because 
of its finer texture, but it is scarcely a difference which 
one can explain. Even experts sometimes have diffi- 
culty in identifying pieces of lumber, especially after 
they have been finished. 
The figure of mahogany is not, like that of oak or 
walnut, due to internal and natural conditions, but 
because of external and abnormal conditions. Wood 
develops with straight grain naturally, but high winds, 
unusual climatic conditions which would cause sudden 
contraction of, the fibers, excessive sunlight and heat 
on one part of the tree, may cause a breaking down 
of the usual growth. Then as each annual layer of 
fibre is produced it adapts itself to the previous 
growth, forming as time passes an unnatural but beau- 
tiful figure. 
“‘Roe’”’ or stripy figure is the most common char- 
acteristic of mahogany, altho it is possessed in a lesser 
degree by other trees, Fig. 20. This figure consists of 
alternate stripes of dark and light wood. The strange 
formation of these bands makes them appear light or 
dark according to the angle from which they are 
viewed. Thus a dark band will appear as a light band 
if it is viewed from the other end of the wood, and the 
light band will appear dark. This peculiarity of 
mahogany makes it a simple matter to distinguish it 
from stained birch, poplar, or maple. Spanish cedar, 
or ‘‘cigar box’’ mahogany has similar stripes, and can- 
not so readily be detected. Broken roe figure is a 
common variation of the roe. In this case the bands 
are not continued thru the wood but are broken off. 
Mottle mahogany, Fig. 21, is marked by dark uneven

-P-A-G-E-131
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 131 
rays which cut transversely across’ the roe. Mottle 
mahogany is not an uncommon figure. It may appear 
in conjunction with the roe bands or without them. It 
is not often imitated on other woods. Fiddleback mot- 
tle, Fig. 22, seems to be merely a further development 
of the ordinary mottle. The wood in this appears when 
viewed in a certain light to have a wavy surface. 
Crotch mahogany, a photograph of which is shown 
in the frontispiece, is a growth formed in a regular 
way at the junction of the limb and the tree, or in the 
roots. It resembles in its formation curly walnut, and 
a similar formation in maple and other trees. 
Another variety of grain, called curly mahogany, 
is shown in Fig. 23. 
117. Staining Mahogany.—Contrary to common 
belief and practice, mahogany should not be heavily 
stained. In good cabinet work, dark stain on mahog- 
any is used to hide a cheap piece of wood, the better 
portions being allowed to exhibit their real beauty. 
One of the easiest ways of coloring mahogany is to 
apply a coat of raw linseed oil to it. This will darken 
the wood quite a little. Try this on a piece of wood 
before you do other staining and see if it is the color 
you wish. The oil may be colored to any desired shade 
of red by steeping alkanet root in it. Three ounces of 
alkanet to a pint of oil is usually strong enough. This 
must be simmered over a slow fire for several hours. 
A solution of potassium bichromate (one ounce of 
the potassium hbichromate to a quart of hot water) 
darkens mahogany toa rich brown. If a reddish brown 
color is desired add a heaping teaspoonful of Bismark 
brown to the above compound.  
-P-A-G-E-132

-P-A-G-E-133
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 133 
Mahogany may be fumed, and gives beautiful results 
under this treatment. An application of tannic acid, 
such as was suggested under’ Sec. 27, will be necessary, 
however. Do not use a filler with fumed mahogany. 
Apply one coat of orange shellac (or white shellac if 
the pores are to show white), rub down the surfacer, 
and polish with white or brown wax. 
Sheraton mahogany. This finish will be seen to be a 
combination of the two suggested manners of finishing 
mahogany. The wood may either be fumed to a dark 
brown or stained with the potassium bichromate stain. 
If the stain is used rub down the work lightly with fine 
sandpaper. In either case apply (after the fuming or 
staining) one or two coats of raw oil and alkanet root 
in the proportions suggested above. Do not apply this 
like an ordinary stain but scrub it into the grain as if 
you were oil-polishing it. The work may be finished 
in oil-polish if it is desired. 
Another manner of finishing sheraton mahogany is 
as follows: After the wood has been stained or fumed 
and oiled, allow it to dry over night, then wipe off any 
excess grease with a cloth dampened in alcohol. Then 
fill the grain with a paste composed of equal parts of 
Van Dyke brown and burnt umber with about half the 
quantity of rose pink, mixed with commercial paste 
filler in the proportion of one part of the coloring to 
ten of the filler. Apply a coat of orange shellac and 
finish the work in varnish or shellac. 
Chippendale mahogany. The English method of 
producing this finish is as follows: Mix Van Dyke 
brown and burnt umber (equal parts) into a stiff paste 
in liquid ammonia. Thin this with water to the con-

-P-A-G-E-135
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 135 
sistency of an ordinary water stain, and apply one coat 
of it to the wood. Allow this to dry, rub down the 
surface lightly with fine sandpaper, and apply a solu- 
tion of Bismark brown water stain (about three table- 
spoonfuls of Bismark brown to a pint of hot water). 
Surface the work, when it has become dry, with orange 
shellac into which a small amount of Bismark brown 
has been dissolved (a teaspoonful of the coloring to a 
pint of shellac), and rub it down again to cut off any 
fibers which may have risen. Polish the work with 
French-polish using the same colored shellac which 
has been applied as a surfacer before. To save time 
in the operation the wood may be filled with a silex 
paste filler which has been colored with Bismark 
brown to match the stain. The English effect of this 
treatment is a plum or damson color. American fin- 
ishers seem to desire a predominance of the brown 
color rather than that of the red. The following solu- 
tion will give the desired shade usually. Make a solu- 
tion of two-thirds of an ounce of potassium bichromate, 
one-third of an ounce of walnut stain powder (water 
stain), two-thirds of an ounce of mahogany red, and 
one gallon of hot water. Apply this to the wood as 
usual, and allow it to dry. Fill the grain with a natural 
paste filler, colored to a brown shade with Van Dyke 
brown, burnt Italian sienna, and a little rose pink. 
Finish in orange shellac or varnish. 
Antique mahogany. Color the wood to the desired 
shade, if a red shade is desired, with oil and alkanet 
root as described under Staining Mahogany, Sec. 117. 
Apply a coat of thin shellac colored with a small 
amount of burnt umber, and allow it to dry. Rub the

-P-A-G-E-137
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 137 
surface very smooth with fine sandpaper, and finish in 
white wax, to which has been added a.small amount of 
carbonate of zinc. 
A similar effect in brown instead of red is quite 
pleasing. Color the wood with burnt umber and burnt 
sienna (ground in oil), or burnt umber with Venetian 
red, or with the potassium bichromate and water stain 
already suggested. When this is dry, apply one coat of 
orange shellac, rub down the surface and finish in white 
wax to which has been added.a little carbonate of zine, 
and, if a grayer effect is desired, a little drop black, 
just enough to give a gray appearance to the wax. 
Never apply a stain to your work until you have 
tested it carefully on pieces of wood which are similar, 
in color and in grain, to that which you are using. A 
slight difference in the color or texture of wood so 
alters the final result of staining that it is impossible 
to give formulas which will act alike in all cases. If 
the color of a stain does not seem to suit, remedy it by 
adding a little more of the desired pigment, or by less- 
ening the amount of some other. In general students 
will be prone to color their work too dark, but a little 
experience will do wonders in helping them to correct 
their faults. The art of wood-finishing is not a mys- 
tery, to be obtained only by a few. It is true that 
matching on a large scale involves a considerable 
amount of knowledge. But the student will not be 
required to do such work, nor will he have need of 
knowing how to do it. One of the delights which 
should not be denied to the student of wood-working is 
the experimentation with colors and finishes to secure 
results which are particularly pleasing to himself.
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 WOOD-FINISHING 
118. Oak.—There are about fifty species of oak in 
North America, the most common of these being white 
oak, red oak, and burr oak. These vary greatly in size, 
in the color of the wood, in the compactness of the 
fibers and in many other particulars, but they all have 
“ in common as cabinet woods the prominent medullary 
rays which are the figure desired in quarter-sawing. 
None of our American oaks equal in strength and fine- 
ness of grain the English oak. 
Oak is the greatest of woods, and pre-eminently the 
wood of romance. Its groves were the scenes of druid- 
ical rites and ceremonies; its strength and durability 
have made possible types of architecture; its imper- 
viability made the ‘‘ships of the line,’’ and these made 
famous the names of Drake, Frobisher, Howard, and 
Nelson. Oak has thus made history, and when we to- 
day, reverencing its associations, make furniture out of 
it we must be aware of its history in order to create 
designs and use polishes that are consistent with its 
story of worth to civilization. 
It is because people have not paid attention to the 
appropriateness of wood finishes that they have 
created the color we know as golden oak. The story 
of the wood, of its rugged, weather-resisting power, is 
not told truly by this mode of finish. 
Oak may be finished in more ways than any other 
wood, and suitably too. The history and longevity of- 
it demand two fundamental considerations in finishing : 
giving an aged appearance to the wood, and a smooth 
dull gloss or luster to beautify that appearance. For 
how could a slippery surface be fitting to a wood which 
was withstanding storm and weather before Columbus
-P-A-G-E-139
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 139 
was born, for such is probably the piece of oak which 
you are now using? The following ways of finishing 
oak are suggested, and in these you will note that 
chemical stains are commonly used. The reason for 
this is that these stains are best adapted to giving the 
antique appearance so desirable to oak. 
Dark brown or cathedral oak. Make a solution by 
dissolving two ounces of permanganate of potash in a 
quart of cold water. Apply this directly to the wood 
and allow it to dry. If the color is not sufficiently dark 
apply another coat of the same stain. Rub down the 
fibers of the wood which have risen because of the 
action of the water, and apply two coats of orange 
shellac. The color will be intensified if a teaspoonful 
of drop black is added to each pint of the shellac used 
in surfacing. Rub down each coat of shellac well with 
fine sandpaper, rubbing in the direction of the grain, 
and finish the wood with several coats of brown bees- 
wax polish. Do not rub this to a high gloss, however. 
Quarter-sawed oak is not generally used with this 
finish. 
Fumed oak with white-pored effect. Fume the oak, 
in the manner suggested in Chapter IT, to a chocolate 
color. Rub the surface well with a mixture of equal 
parts of turpentine and raw linseed oil and allow it to 
remain over night. Remove any excess greasiness with 
a cloth moistened in alcohol, and apply one coat of 
thin white shellac to which has been added some fine 
silica (about two tablespoonfuls to a pint of shellac). 
Allow this a day to dry, and then rub the surface with 
fine sandpaper. Brush off the work and finish it with 
several coats of white wav. Do not rub the wax to
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 WOOD-FINISHING 
a high polish. This finish is used on quarter-sawed 
oak, 
Fumed oak with dark-pored effect. Fume the oak to 
a chocolate color, and rub the surface with oil and tur- 
pentine, in the manner previously suggested. Wipe 
off the surface with a cloth moistened in alcohol, and 
apply two coats of orange shellae. A better effect will 
be obtained if a little burnt umber is added to the 
shellac. Finish the wood with brown beeswax or ordi- 
nary beeswax and turpentine paste to which a little 
burnt umber has been added. Quartered oak is usually 
used for this treatment. 
Weathered oak. There are so many different shades 
of weathered oak that it would be only confusing for 
me to attempt to enumerate them. The color varies 
from a very dark brown to a deep black, and many 
ways are suggested for the finishing of it. The follow- 
ing formula will give good results: Dissolve one ounce 
of walnut brown, three tablespoonfuls of potassium 
bichromate, one-half ounce of nigrosine, in a quart of 
boiling water. Sponge the wood well so as to open the 
grain, and allow it to dry. Rub down the surface and 
apply a coat of stain. If the color is not very dark 
apply another coat of the stain when the first is almost 
dry. When this has dried, apply a coat of orange 
shellae to which has been added a little drop black. Out 
the wood fibers down lightly with sandpaper, and finish 
the work with white wax. 
Flemish oak. This color also seems to variate in the 
minds of different finishers. A deep coffee color is 
sometimes desired while an almost black is occasionally 
sought for. The deep brown color may be obtained

by first treating the wood to a solution of potassium 
bichromate (two ounces of the potassium bichromate to 
a quart of water). Allow this to dry, and sandpaper 
the surface lightly. Then apply a solution of one ounce 
of drop black, one-half pint of oil and an equal amount 
of turpentine. Rub this well into the pores of the 
wood with a cloth, and after a few minutes wipe off 
any excess stain with a dry cloth. Apply a coat or two 
of orange shellac, and wax-polish to a very dull finish. 
Only quartered oak is used. 
Jacobean oak. The genuine Jacobean finish is of a 
~ rich brown color which shades to a light brown in spots. 
The light portions are not made at random on the 
work, but must be in imitation of usage. They are 
therefore made on such parts as would naturally 
receive the most wear in ordinary household service. 
The center of panels, the center of drawer fronts, the 
edges and high parts of mouldings, ete., may be light- 
ened suitably. One can scarcely imitate this finish 
unless he has seen examples of it, but the student’s 
imagination will be of greatest service to him in 
arranging the gradation of shading. The stain may 
be made as follows: Take equal parts of Van Dyke 
brown and burnt umber and mix them together in raw 
linseed oil into which has been put a small amount of 
drop black. Thin the solution with turpentine and 
stain the wood freely. Let this dry thoroly and then 
rub off the parts which are to show light with fine sand- 
paper. Great care must be exercised in this process. 
to see that the dark color gradually merges into the 
light without any line of demarcation. Mistakes will 
of course frequently be made. but. these can be easily 
aie: 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 WOOD-FINISHING 
remedied ‘by applying a little more stain where it is 
necessary with a small wad of cloth moistened in the 
stain. The center of the rubbed parts should be of even 
eolor. When the rubbing has been satisfactorily done, 
apply two coats of orange shellac, and wax-polish the 
work. Straight-grained oak is used for this finish, and 
the wood is never filled. 
Driftwood oak. Allow a pound of unslaked lime to 
slake in two quarts of water. Rub the lime over the 
surface of the oak across the grain of the wood. Give 
the surface time to become partially dry and then wipe - 
off the excess lime rubbing across the grain. Apply - 
to this, when it has become thoroly dry, a coat of thin 
white shellac. Cut off the surface fibres with sand- 
paper and finish the work with white wax to which has 
been added a small amount of zinc white. 
Mission oak. There are a great many shades of so- 
called ‘‘mission’’ oak. The effect of black with a light 
filler is common, and I shall give it here as typical of 
the finishes altho there is a great variance. One-half of 
a pound of drop black, two tablespoonfuls of raw 
sienna, and a small amount of japan drier, are dis- 
solved in turpentine and strained thru coarse cloth. 
Perhaps it is well to say that these colors should be 
ground in oil. This stain is applied to the wood and 
allowed to dry. The work is then given a coat of thin, 
white shellac and rubbed down. A light-colored filler 
is generally used. This may be supplied by adding a 
little zine white to a white wax paste, rubbing the wax 
across the grain until the pores are filled. Then polish 
in a dull gloss. 
Gray oak. This color may be obtained by coating the
-P-A-G-E-143
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 143 
work with a mild solution of silver nitrate (about a 
five per cent solution). Cover the work at least twice 
with this, then apply a solution of commercial hydro- 
chlorie acid. The wood will change to almost a plum 
color under the acids. When this is dry neutralize the 
acid with a coat of ammonia of ordinary strength. Do 
not touch the work with the fingers while it is wet, or 
the marks will show. Use the ammonia out of doors 
as its fumes are injurious and stifling. Let the 
work dry in a dark place, after the nitrate and hydro- 
chloric acid have been applied. Finish with white 
wax. 
119. Pine.—Of the great number of. these resinous 
trees, only a few are really adapted to the needs of 
furniture making and interior woodwork, altho many 
of the species are useful in outside work. All pines 
are more or less resinous, and even this differs con- 
siderably in the individual trees. In using a water 
stain, then, care must be exercised that the color 
‘bites’? in to the portions which are especially high 
in gum. The use of vinegar as a mordant is to be rec- 
ommended here. If knots are encountered they must 
be heavily coated with shellac so that the subsequent 
exudation from the wood may not loosen the finishing 
coats of varnish or shellas which have been applied. 
The resin in the knots will quickly discolor any light- 
colored paint if it is applied directly to their surface. 
For this reason too, shellac must be used. Good yellow 
or white pine may be used, in general, very well in con- 
structive work which does not require toughness or 
strength greatly. It may be stained any color, but it is 
an excellent base for enamel and paint. Use always
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 WOOD-FINISHING 
a liquid filler with this wood. White shellac is best for 
this purpose. 
120. Georgia Pine.—This wood has of recent years 
come into considerable demand in interior work. 
Altho many suggestions are offered as to the finishing 
of it, there is only one which will eventually prove 
successful. Oil should not be applied to pine, either 
in the form of stain or in the varnish as is the case 
when the latter is applied directly to the wood or 
without a surfacer. It muddies the color of the wood 
eventually, even tho it shows well for a time. The 
best treatment of Georgia pine is simply successive 
coats of white shellac. If the work is so large that 
this seems too expensive, apply one or two coats of 
white shellac, and follow these with pale varnish. 
White or pale copal is good for this work. Do not use 
a Damar varnish as a final coat in any work. It is 
too soft. The student will have to guard against finger 
spots or greasiness on the wood before it is finished. 
Pine especially shows these more noticeably than most 
other woods. 
Oak stains and fillers such as have already been 
described may be used to obtain pleasing effects of 
brown on this wood. If the stain does not seem to 
“‘bite’’ into the wood, finish it by making the neces- 
sary color by adding pigment to a shellac base. A 
few coats of this will produce a good effect. A water 
stain used with a dark brown filler will heighten the 
figure or harder portions of the wood admirably. 
121. Poplar.—This wood is generally used in con- 
struction where paint or enamel is to be the finish. 
It is commonly used also to imitate mahogany and in
-P-A-G-E-145
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 145 
the texture of the grain seems particularly well 
adapted to this treatment. It may be stained in any 
way satisfactorily, but in matching the mahogany of 
other parts of the work it must be stained a very dark 
color. This is most commonly seen in the legs of 
tables, piano benches, and chairs, where the more ex- 
pensive wood has been used in the large surfaces. It 
is frequently sold under the name of ‘‘combination ma- 
hogany’’ pieces, which deceive the one not acquainted 
with the peculiarities of better wood. No wood, how- 
ever, is better adapted to taking paint and enamel. 
The filler may be a colored commercial liquid filler, 
but shellae will give better results. 
122. Pear.—For imitating ebony no better wood 
has been found than pear wood. It is hard and very 
close grained, taking a stain and polish well. The same 
treatment may be used for this wood as was suggested 
under Apple, Sec. 104, and under Ebony, See. 14. 
123. Redwood.—California redwood, the giant of 
the American forest, is a coarse-grained wood of red- 
dish-brown cast. The largest bar in the world was, in 
pre-prohibition days, composed of one solid piece from 
the trunk of one of these trees. Some of these trees, 
the last of their race, remain the wonder of tourists in 
.Western United States. 
A paste filler must be used in preparing this wood 
for finishing. Frequently an oil stain, in shades which 
Van Dyke brown, burnt umber, and burnt sienna yield, 
is used to obtain different effects between red and 
brown color. If the stain is allowed some time to sink 
into the wood, and is then removed with a cloth be- 
fore it is entirely dry the grain of the wood may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 WOOD-FINISHING 
improved. It is however with curly redwood that the 
woodworker has most to do. The same treatment is 
suggested for this wood because wiping off the stain 
accentuates the wavy surface. In coloring the wood, 
hold rather to a shade of red than to one which is pre- 
dominantly brown. 
124. Walnut.—Mahogany, oak, and walnut, these 
three now comprise for the most part the woods of 
furniture making of the better sort. Oak cannot be 
successfully imitated altho many kinds of woods, most 
notably ash and elm, are used for this purpose. But 
mahogany and walnut can be. This has given rise to 
a great many methods of deceit which are daily being 
practiced upon the unsuspecting buyer. As in the case 
of mahogany, walnut should not be finished in a very 
dark color. It is well to apply a finish that will grow 
in beauty as it does in age. 
125. American Black Walnut—tThis is the wood 
which we know as walnut but which is only one of a 
considerable number of species. The texture is more 
open than close grained, the wood is beautifully rich 
in color, in all respects well adapted to the needs of 
furniture making, and takes any kind of polish equally 
well. Small wonder then that it has rapidly entered 
the first rank of valuable woods of commerce, and that 
it holds its place year after year among those who 
know the value of it. To the pioneers of America its 
value was both as a wood of beauty and a wood of 
durability. They made their chairs and tables from 
it, they also looked to the future of their buildings, 
and even to this day in many sections of the country 
ean be seen buildings made from this wood.
-P-A-G-E-147
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 147 
126. Finishing Walnut.—To me there is one pre- 
eminent finish for walnut. This is oil. No matter 
how often we may take fads in finishes, this polish, 
which is the oldest known to man, returns to assume 
first rank. It is doubtful whether another kind of 
finish will ever be found to rival it. Oil has a beauti- 
fying and darkening effect upon any dark wood, but 
upon walnut its enrichening power is best seen. It 
adds a depth to the wood, throwing the figure of the 
wood into beautiful relief. It gives that beautiful soft- 
ness which age only enhances. It is proof against any 
of the ordinary accidents which spoil other polishes, 
and can be renewed like wax from time to time by 
merely rubbing over the surface. The reason for its 
lack of use in furniture houses is, of course, the time 
and consequently the money, which are necessary to 
produce it. But like French-polish on mahogany, and 
wax on oak, oil remains the final medium for finishing 
black walnut. 
There are, of course, many ways of producing a 
beautiful surface on walnut. The most common man- 
ner is to fill the wood with a paste filler colored with 
burnt umber, with or without a stain. Bichromate of 
potash stain may be used to give a slight orange color- 
ing, and the wood may then be finished with orange 
shellac or varnish. Some prefer to oil the wood 
thoroly, leave it a day to dry, apply one or two coats 
of orange shellac, and wax-polish it. This is an excel- 
lent way to finish walnut, and in many ways superior 
to varnishing it. If carbonate of zine is mixed with 
white wax, a. grey or antique finish will be obtained. 
Brown wax will not show in the pores. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
148 WOOD-FINISHING 
I would caution the student against imitating any 
wood with walnut. Frequently this wood is used by 
manual training teachers and others with a red stain 
to counterfeit mahogany. Such a procedure is never 
to be recommended. Walnut is our wood, a peculiarly 
national timber, just as oak seems to belong to 
England, and maple to Canada. Keep the individual- 
ity of it. It is nothing less than a violation of one of 
the principles of wood-finishing to attempt to make it 
look like something else. 
127. Matching Color in Walnut.—The sapwood in 
walnut is almost white in color, and while this sapwood 
should be avoided whenever it is possible, it is often 
found after the piece of work is completed. Applica- 
tions of strong coffee or tobacco such as are sometimes 
recommended will not serve well to match the color of 
the dark part of the wood. I advise the student to 
make a solution of walnut crystals and water (about 
two ounces of walnut crystals to the pint of water). 
A tablespoonful of vinegar will help this to bite into 
the wood. Apply this while hot to the light portions 
of the wood with a small soft brush. If this color is 
too dark weaken. the stain a little with hot water. If 
you already have some potassium bichromate solu- 
tion on hand try it to see what its effect will be on 
your particular piece of wood. It may be the color 
you wish. Or if it is too light boil a small amount of 
walnut crystals in it to see whether or not this will 
give you the desired effect. A more powerful color 
may be obtained by adding to the walnut crystals and 
water solution one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. 
Finish the work with orange shellac, to which has been
-P-A-G-E-149
WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 149 
added a very little brown aniline dye. This must be, 
of course, a spirit soluble aniline, and not a water or 
oil soluble. The dye may be omitted if the color is 
suitable, but a little coloring in the shellac will take 
away the yellow cast which may be objectionable. An- 
other way of matching, which is done much more fre- 
quently in Europe than in this country, is to paint on 
successive coats of thin well-colored shellac with a 
small brush. One can easily reason how well the 
matching of figures on plain wood is accomplished in 
this manner. In doing this never use a thick shellac. 
Color the shellac with alcohol soluble anilines, and thin 
it to the consistency of varnish. All the student needs 
is an eye for color and a little care with the brush to 
match the figured parts of the wood so well that it 
will be difficult to distinguish them after the work is 
finished. If you are attempting to match a wavy or 
curly grain paint out the dark portions as nearly like 
those of the true wood as you can. Let the shellac dry 
and rub it down very lightly with fine sandpaper. In 
this way apply successive coats until the imitated figure 
stands out in color like the part that you are trying to 
duplicate. The work may then be polished or var- 
nished as usual. 
128. Filler for Walnut.—Walnut requires a paste 
filler of a little darker color than the wood. Van Dyke 
brown and burnt umber may be used if a light color 
is desired, or burnt umber alone if the wood is to be 
dark. Mix the color into the paste filler you have pre- 
pared or bought, and thin it with turpentine to a good 
heavy consistency. Brush the filler across the grain 
of the wood so as to fill the pores well. Allow it a  
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 WOOD-FINISHING 
few minutes to become hard and then rub it off well 
with a piece of buriap. When it has dried thoroly, 
sandpaper the surface, and finish with shellac or 
varnish. ‘ 
129. Some Final Remarks About Wood-Finishing. 
—lIn the previous pages on staining and finishing wood 
I have tried to keep before the student or amateur the 
necessity for appropriateness in all his work. The 
principles of wood-finishing are like other arts based 
upon two qualities, beauty and use. Of recent years 
a great deal of the so-called ‘‘mission’’ furniture has 
been copied by manual training schools. The reason 
for this was two-fold: first, square lines such as are 
common to this type are easily made by the beginner; 
and second, the style seemed particularly well adapted 
to the expression of the pioneer American characteris 
ties of rugged simplicity and worth. The wood used 
for this is oak. How inharmonious then seems a 
bright-colored or shining surface on this furniture. 
Yet as I have visited the departments of manual arts 
in various schools I have observed this anomaly fre- 
quently. Sometimes I ventured to ask why the par- 
ticular finish was applied, and all I could learn was 
that the teacher and the students thought that wood 
was wood, that design was design, and that finish was 
finish, without any thought of the artistic whole which 
was to be the result of these three happily blended and 
adapted to each other. Is there any reason why 
manual training departments should work as if var- 
nish were the only kind of finish that can be applied 
to wood? Is there anything to be gained by following 
the example of makers of cheap furniture whose sole
-P-A-G-E-151
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 151 
aim in the finishing department as in all others, is 
constantly to find a cheaper substitute, something that 
will fool the customer until the sale is made? I think 
not. At some time not far distant we shall be suffi- 
ciently enlightened not to buy ‘‘walnut’’ furniture 
which is almost entirely basswood, or mahogany which 
is poplar, or oak which is ash and chestnut. And any 
manufacturer who allows his product to be placed upon 
the market under such an assumed name is worthy 
of all the contempt that may be shown to his furni- 
ture. We attempt to make it illegal to sell cotton 
mixed clothing under the name of wool, but we as yet 
have no way to force the furniture man to call his 
product by its true name. ' 
130. Aids in Selecting Colors—The following few 
things may help the student to a wise choice of color 
in his staining. When the problem of finishing a piece 
of work comes before you the first thing to consider 
is the color you wish it to be. This may be that of 
the wood itself, in which case, of course, no stain is 
needed, but usually the natural wood will need to be 
softened and enriched. The question that we must 
then ask ourselves is, ‘‘What is the dominant color of 
the wood in its natural state?’’ This surely will ordi- 
narily be a safe criterion for the selection of a stain. 
In this way we shall add to the individuality of the 
wood rather than take away its identity. The type 
color of oak is brown. Why do we then sometimes do 
violence to the wood by making it green or red? Surely 
that is not artistic. But the story of this wood may 
be enhanced in another manner. Oak is the wood of 
the ages. How many times have we seen the old planks 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
152 WOOD-FINISHING 
of ships battered and blackened by weather, and the 
pores of the wood whitened by the salt from the sea. 
Certainly it is not a desecration of the wood to try 
to reproduce this effect. When we are able to accom- 
plish this we add to the charm of the wood by giv- 
ing it a weathered or antique appearance. Suppose, 
for example, we take another wood, birch. Now birch 
is a beautiful wood and one which has distinctive traits. 
It is also an excellent wood for construction. Why 
then seek to make a fake mahogany out of it? The 
color of the wood varies in shades of reddish brown, 
red being more often the dominant or type color. In- 
stead of attempting to produce an imitation of another 
. wood of entirely different nature and traits, does it 
not seem more in keeping with common sense and the 
principles of art to intensify and to enrich the charac- 
teristics of the natural wood?) Similarly we might 
consider mahogany, maple, cherry, and walnut, and 
in all the principle would remain the same, to use wood 
which has merit of itself and to attempt by the art of — 
the finisher to give due prominence to that merit. 
131. Points on Polishing.—All these things apply 
in the first place to the matter of staining and filling 
the wood, but they are equally applicable to the ques- 
tion of polishing. As in the first place we declared 
that the prime factors were beauty and serviceability, 
so will these be retained in the present discussion. I 
have said that golden oak, as it is sold in furniture 
houses, is the most inartistic of wood-finishes. My 
reason for saying this is that it seems to me to be 
the most inappropriate treatment for the wood. Any- 
thing that serves to detract from the natural charac-
-P-A-G-E-153
  WOODS AND THEIR TREATMENT 153 
teristics of this wood is inartistic. This is more 
strictly applicable in the case of oak because this is 
the greatest wood from every point of view, that we 
have. Oak should not be conceived as a highly decora- 
tive wood, but rather as a wood with a story of sery- 
iceability to mankind. The kind of finish, then, which 
is suited to the more decorative woods is not appro- 
priate for oak. Curly walnut, highly figured mahogany, 
and other woods of this class seem. to claim special 
treatment by the finisher to throw into relief their 
charm, but oak is sufficient unto itself. The less we 
do with it the better. All the finish that is necessary 
is that which will keep it from being discolored and 
dirty. And while I am speaking of this wood I may 
add that it is a questiow for debate whether quarter- 
sawed oak is, in any respects, more suitable for furni- 
ture than plain-sawed oak. If it comes to a matter of 
which is preferable for a table top, plain oak or quar- 
ter-sawed veneer, I think there can be little hesitation 
in choosing the former. I can tolerate walnut veneer 
in some places, I can admire the beauty of fine ma- 
hogany veneer, but veneer of oak—well I cannot look 
at it without a feeling of revulsion. The salesman 
will of course prove undeniably that veneered work 
is stronger than solid wood, and many other selling 
points which are more amusing than illuminating, but 
still you know it is like wearing a cotton shirt with 
a silk front, you can’t take off your coat. In other 
words, it does not bear inspection. Ag the salesman 
may say, of course, the cotton will wear better than 
the silk. The point is that we admire and wish to 
possess genuine things.

132. Floors, Finished Like Furniture—The prob- 
lem of finishing floors-is one which comes to most of 
us occasionally. In some respects it is similar to that 
of finishing interior woodwork, but in others it is quite 
different. The main expense of floor finishing is in 
the manual labor, and there is usually no need for 
even an amateur to engage the services of an expert 
except on work which requires special: treatment. 
Here as elsewhere, a little care and work will produce © 
excellent results. 
133. Hardwood Floors.—The most common woods 
for hardwood floors are maple and oak. We shall then 
give these a detailed treatment. If an oak floor has 
not previously been finished the first thing to do is to 
stain it, or, if the work is to be left in the natural color, 
no stain is, of course, necessary. The most appro- 
priate color to stain oak is in some shade of brown. 
Remember this in any treatment of floors and you will 
save yourself some future disappointment: the floor 
of a room should have the appearance of substantiality 
and of strength. This is not easily obtained in light 
colors. I suggest then that unless you have some spe- 
cial reason for not darkening the wood of your floor 
that you stain it with a suitable color. Brown oak in 
this case is quite desirable. For work on floors IT 
have found an oil stain best, the difficulty with a water 
stain being that it is difficult to keep as hot as it should 
be applied, and also that it roughens the fibers of the 
154
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  FINISHING FLOORS 155 
wood to such an extent that they must be rubbed down 
with sandpaper at some subsequent time in the process 
before the varnish, shellac, or wax is applied. For 
all general purposes then use an oil stain. Apply this 
to the wood which has been very carefully smoothed 
with a scraper and sandpaper. A good, wide brush 
is best for this purpose. The stain should flow freely 
from under the brush, and not be thick and muddy. 
If this stain proves too strong add a little good linseed 
oil and turpentine to it. Do not use so much stain on 
the brush at one time that the excess flows into small 
depressions and forms minute pools. Work the brush 
generally in the direction of the grain of the wood, and 
do not attempt to cover a very large surface at a 
time. You may save yourself the trouble of having to 
obliterate laps by staining a few boards at a time, going 
entirely across the floor. If the outer edge of your 
stain colors just to the edge of a board each time you 
will not cover any part of the floor a second time. 
This is worth observing because two coats of stain on 
any part will add more color than one coat, and con- 
sequently any overlapping in staining is apt to show 
in streaks. Allow the stain to dry over night and then 
remove any excess greasiness with a dry cloth. 
134. Filling Oak Floors.—Oak is a very porous 
wood and unless a filler is applied to seal the tiny pores 
it will drink up a great amount of varnish. The follow- 
ing filler may be used very satisfactorily on brown oak: 
1 quart good linseed oil (boiled or raw). 
1 pint brown japan. 
¥% pint pure turpentine. 
Silica colored with burnt umber.
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 WOOD-FINISHING 
In preparing this mixture, pour the liquid ingredi- 
ents together and add sufficient silica to make a good 
heavy paste (a little thicker than ordinary paint will 
be about right). Then add the burnt umber, stirring 
the mixture constantly, until a chocolate brown is ob- 
tained. Apply this to the floor across the grain of the 
wood with a brush. Allow the filler to dry for fifteen 
or twenty minutes, or until the surface of it appears 
dead or flat, and then wipe it off across the grain with 
a piece of burlap. The filler should not be left to dry 
until it feels very sticky. Wipe off every particle of 
it that you can. A word of warning is very necessary 
here; do not apply the filler to a surface larger than 
you can take care of in case the filler suddenly becomes 
sticky. Work on a small area at first until you see 
how much you can conveniently cover at a time. The 
floor ‘thus filled should be allowed thirty-six hours in 
which to dry. The surface may then be rubbed down 
with No. 1 sandpaper. Using the block suggested 
under Sandpapering, See. 5, will be the most convenient 
way of doing this. If one coat of filler does not com- 
pletely fill the wood apply another coat, treating it in 
the same manner. It is necessary to do this thoroly 
if a satisfactory result is desired. 
135. Finishing the Floor—When the floor is 
thoroly dry and smooth it is ready for finishing. This 
may be done in several manners according to the need 
of the work. The first part of the process is similar 
in all cases, however. Whether wax or varnish is to 
be the finish, a thin surfacer should be applied imme- 
diately over the stained and filled wood. This surfacer 
may be orange shellac thinned down to almost a watery
-P-A-G-E-157
  FINISHING FLOORS 157 
consistency.; or a thin copal varnish. Orange shellac 
must be thinned with denatured or grain aleohol, not 
with wood alcohol. Varnish is reduced with pure tur- 
pentine. Never use a cheap grade of turpentine for this. 
The object in thinning the surfacing coat is to allow 
it to enter or ‘‘bite’’ into the wood so that it may not 
dry in a cake upon the surface of the wood and peel 
off with the subsequent coats of varnish after it is 
subject to wear. This coat must be left a sufficient 
time to dry thoroly. This fact cannot be overstressed. 
Amateurs are prone to judge whether or not varnish 
is dry by feeling it with the hand. If it feels hard 
they immediately assume that it is dry. Such is not 
the case. A thin coat of shellae will be dry enough 
to rub after four hours, but varnish should be left 
thirty-six hours or more to harden before any rubbing 
is attempted. You may experiment with this if you 
wish, but it will be to your distress and expense if you 
do. After this surfacing coat has become dry and 
hard, rub down the surface with No. 0 sandpaper, and 
wipe off any dust with a clean cloth. Then apply a 
full coat of floor varnish or good rubbing varnish, 
not thinned with turpentine. If shellac has been used 
as the surfacing coat it may be used again, but for 
this work varnish is most easily applied and satisfac- 
tory. The point to remember is this: varnish may be 
applied over shellac, but shellac must not be applied 
over varnish. This second coat should be allowed two 
days to dry. It may then be rubbed down with No. 0 
sandpaper, but the rubbing must be done in the direc- 
tion of the grain. Indeed all sandpapering should be 
done in this manner. Dust off the surface again and,
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 WOOD-FINISHING 
if a good job is desired, apply one more coat of var- 
nish. This should not be rubbed within less than two 
days. No. 00 steel wool may then be used to take down 
the surface for the last time and the floor may be 
polished in the usual manner with floor wax. 
This is one of the best methods of treating oak 
floors, but in case a cheaper and quicker job is neces- 
sary, I shall add an alternate treatment. The cheaper 
work will, of course, always be less satisfactory than 
the other, but it will give as much satisfaction as the 
ordinary run of finishes that are applied by hired 
workmen. Stain the wood or leave it in the natural 
color as is desired, fill the pores with the paste filler 
suggested above, and apply one thin coat of thin orange 
shellac. Allow this three or four hours to dry, rub 
down the surface, and apply one coat of varnish. Give 
this two days in which to harden, smooth off the sur- 
face and finish with floor wax. If the wood is to be 
finished in its natural color add only a very small 
amount of burnt umber to the filler, just enough to 
make a light brown color. 
The object in finishing a floor is primarily to make 
a hard smooth surface which will protect the wood. 
Many people suppose that a few heavy or thick coats 
of varnish do this. The opposite is true. A film of 
varnish on wood should be very thin in order to do its 
work most effectively. A thick coat is sure to chip off 
and crack as soon as it is subjected to wear. A floor 
finished in the first manner given, will, with a little 
eare, last for half a generation. The wax must be re- 
newed from time to time. 
A less permanent but quicker method than either of
-P-A-G-E-159
  
FINISHING FLOORS 159 
the above finishes is to omit the varnish or shellac 
entirely. After the wood has been stained and filled, 
apply one coat of thin orange shellac or thin floor var- 
nish to the wood. If shellae is used it will be ready 
for polishing much more quickly. When the varnish 
or shellac is dry rub it down with fine sandpaper and 
wax-polish it. 
136. Finishing Maple Floors.—Maple floors are usu- 
ally, but not necessarily, finished in the natural wood. 
If no stain is desired apply a coat of thin white shellac 
to the wood, allow this a few hours to dry, and then 
wax-polish it. Do not apply oil directly to any light- 
colored wood if you wish to preserve its beauty. Oil 
makes a dirty brown color on maple which is far from 
desirable in a house. If a stain is used, which is 
not a common procedure, it is better to use a water 
stain such as has been described in the earlier part 
of this book. After this has become dry, apply a 
coat of thin white shellac and rub down the surface 
with fine sandpaper. Varnish, usually not more than 
one coat, or wax, or one coat of varnish followed by 
wax, may then be applied. Very often no shellac at 
all is applied to maple that is to be finished in the 
natural wood. The surface is polished from the be- 
ginning with wax. A much greater degree of satis- 
faction will be had, however, if a coat or two of shellac 
are applied before the wax. Again a pale copal var- 
nish may be used as a surfacer instead of two coats 
of shellac. The best method to follow is probably 
to apply one coat of white shellac directly to the wood. 
This serves as filler and surfacer to maple, altho it 
would not be sufficient for most: other woods. When  
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 WOOD-FINISHING 
this has become dry, rub down the surface with fine 
sandpaper, and apply one or two coats of pale copal 
varnish (a good quality of floor varnish will do well). 
Be sure that each of these is dry before beginning 
to work on them. Rub down both coats or at least 
the second coat with fine sandpaper, and wax-polish 
the floor. 
‘Wax is not a permanent finish in any sense of the 
word. It produces a pleasing satiny luster on the work, 
but soon wears off, and.-must be renewed. For floors 
which are subjected to a great deal of hard usage, or 
where water is frequently spilled wax is not suitable. 
It is better to apply some good quality of floor varnish. 
137. Finishing Softwood Floors.—Pine and fir are 
commonly used for floors where a softwood is desired. 
These are finished in quite a similar manner to hard- 
wood floors but it will perhaps be well to suggest some 
treatments of them in a detailed way. Pine is fre- 
quently finished in the natural wood. Fir has little 
beauty in itself and should therefore be stained. In 
the case of either wood a water stain should be used 
in preference to spirit or oil stains. It will always 
be well, however, to test the effect of a new stain upon 
a block of wood before using it. It may not be at all 
what you wish. Water stains are quite brilliant, and 
one should always use a little darker shade of color 
than he finds the stain advertised to be. The worst 
thing that could happen to one would be to achieve a 
striking or noticeable floor where the effect should 
always be unobtrusiveness. If a water stain is used, 
apply it hot to the wood with a large brush, taking 
eare to avoid overlapping, (see Chapter II). The wood
-P-A-G-E-161
  
FINISHING FLOORS 161 
must then be filled, but this time with a liquid filler 
instead of a paste filler. The easiest way to make a 
liquid filler is to add sufficient silica to some varnish to 
make a heavy mixture, not so thick as paste. Then thin 
this with pure turpentine to the consistency of the 
varnish before the silica was added. Burnt umber, 
Van Dyke brown, burnt or raw sienna, or drop black 
may be added, to color the filler to approximately the 
same shade as the stained wood. Apply this filler like 
varnish, allowing it at least a day to harden. Liquid 
filler is not wiped from the wood as paste filler is. It 
is treated exactly as a coat of varnish, and is rubbed to 
a smooth surface after it has become dry. The floor 
may then be given one or two coats of good floor var- 
nish, each being allowed forty-eight hours to dry, and 
afterwards rubbed down with fine sandpaper or No. 
00 steel wool. If the wood is to be finished in the 
natural color no special filler is needed. One coat of 
shellac, rubbed down, and followed by one or two coats 
of floor varnish, will serve admirably. 
138. Painting Softwood Floors.—The best finish for 
softwood floors is paint, but ordinary paint will not 
be satisfactory. The best way to proceed is as fol- 
lows: Clean the wood well, removing all dents and 
filling all holes with a shellac and sawdust paste. Any 
resinous knots or portions of the wood must be coy- 
ered with a coat of shellac. When the surface is thus 
prepared apply a good priming coat. Rub this down 
with sandpaper after it has become dry. Then apply 
‘two coats of good floor or deck paint, giving the first 
ample time to dry before the second is applied. The 
requirements for a good finish are: good materials, 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    
162 WOOD-FINISHING 
cleanliness, and time. Nothing will so easily spoil your 
work as haste. A few hours of additional drying time 
will repay you in every way. All paint or varnish 
should be warm, that is, of the temperature of the air 
in mild weather (about seventy or seventy-five de- 
grees), and the floor or woodwork should be kept at 
the same temperature for good finishing. 
139. Repainting Old Floors.—Often the problem of 
repainting an old floor presents itself. This does not 
involve any new processes except the removal of the 
old paint. A paint and varnish remover will do this, 
but time and expense may be saved by blistering most 
of the old finish with a blow torch and then seraping it 
off with a steel scraper or other convenient tool. Al- 
most all the old paint can be removed in this way. The 
few spots that remain can be softened and rubbed off 
with wood alcohol or some commercial liquid prepared 
for this purpose. If a good finish is desired you will 
do well to wash the wood with strong soap and water 
solution, applied hot. Then allow the wood to dry, rub 
down with sandpaper the fibers which the water has 
eaused to rise, and apply a priming coat. Usually 
one coat of primer will be sufficient for surfaces which 
have once been finished. The rest of the painting may 
be done in the manner suggested in the previous 
paragraph. 
140. Revarnishing Floors—The old varnish and 
wax must be completely removed, not as paint, with a 
blow torch, but with some prepared varnish remover. 
If this is not to be had, wood alcohol will do the work 
but it will usually take more time. The surface to be 
revarnished must be more carefully cleansed of all
-P-A-G-E-163
  FINISHING FLOORS 163 
dirt than was necessary for repainting. In either case 
it is well to wash off the wood, after the old finish has 
been removed, with strong soap and hot water. Floors 
which are uneven or warped should be smoothed down 
with a floor scraper. This is more often necessary in 
refinishing hardwood floors than with those of soft- 
wood. If any scraping is done the wood will have to be 
filled, otherwise restaining and finishing may proceed 
as before suggested. If a varnish remover is used at 
any time, use care in handling it. Removers of this 
kind are usually poisonous and very inflammable. 
141. Filling Cracks in Floors——A good filling for 
eracks and holes in floors may be made by mixing 
up a stiff paste with shellac and sawdust. This should 
not be placed in the cracks until the work has been 
stained and surfaced with a coat of shellac or varnish. 
This will enable you to determine exactly what shade 
of color to mix with the paste to match the stained 
wood. Burnt umber will produce a reddish brown, 
Van Dyke brown is much darker, burnt sienna is red. 
Any of the spirit aniline dyes will do well for this 
purpose. A mixture of glue and sawdust may be used 
instead of the shellac paste, and indeed, it is much 
more easily used because it may be applied before the 
stain and filler and will absorb the stain readily, a 
property which the shellac paste does not have. If 
paint is to be used as the finish, holes or cracks may 
be filled with putty, or shellac and sawdust, or glue and 
sawdust paste. Shellac dries so quickly that it is not 
recommended for a large amount of work. 
142. Removing Stains from Light-Colored Floors.— 
The easiest method of doing this is to rub the discol- 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 WOOD-FINISHING 
ored wood with a cloth dipped in a solution of oxalic 
acid and water. A good strength to make this solu- 
tion is four ounces of the acid to a quart of hot water. 
If the spots do not come out in one application, repeat 
the process. After the discoloration has been removed 
be sure to wash off the spot with vinegar before any 
finishing is done. This will prevent the acid from con- 
tinuing its work after the surface has been polished. 
Tf the whole floor is dirty, a wood bleaching agent may 
be had by making a strong solution of washing soda 
in hot water, or a solution of oxalic acid and water half 
the strength of the one mentioned above.
-P-A-G-E-165
CHAPTER XIV 
Turnep Work 
143. Difficulties in Finishing Turned Work.—The 
problem of finishing turned work is in some respects 
different from that of finishing ordinary projects. In 
the first place remove all grease marks. A great deal 
of care is necessary to obtain an even color to the 
whole surface because a part of it, indeed often a 
great share of it, is of end grain. Obviously, it will 
not do to put the same amount or strength of stain 
on these very porous parts as on the closer-grained 
portions. If we did this the open wood would be much 
darker than the other. The first thing necessary is a 
very smooth piece of work. Nothing but the finest 
sandpaper must be used for the final smoothing, and 
this must not be done while the wood is turning in the 
lathe. The final polishing must be done in the direc- 
tion of the grain as far as possible. If you neglect 
this your finished product will be far from satisfac- 
tory. In the second place it is better not to use a 
water stain on turned work. The quantity of fibers 
which will rise from the action of the water will neces- 
sitate a long process of smoothing. The best stain for 
the purpose is an oil stain because it does not sink 
into the wood rapidly as do those which have spirit 
or water as their solvent. The easiest manner of pro- 
cedure in staining is to stain the nearly flat grain first 
with a single coat. Then thin this stain to half its for- 
mer strength by the addition of turpentine and apply 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 WOOD-FINISHING 
a coat of it to the porous parts of the work. Allow 
this at least two hours to sink into the wood, and then 
wipe off any excess grease with a clean cloth. You 
will probably now see that certain parts of the work’ 
are lighter than others. Take a small brush and paint 
over these parts with the thin stain. The wood will 
then be quite evenly colored. Oil stain requires a 
longer time to dry than other stains and it should not 
be hastened. 
Do not attempt to fill turned work with anything 
except pure shellac, and do not attempt to apply this 
while the wood is revolving on the lathe. Paint it on 
with a brush and allow it to dry as with any other 
piece of work. Two coats or more will be necessary 
to fill-the grain, but they should be of thin shellac. 
Rub down the surface, after each application has 
dried, with fine sandpaper. But do not do this across 
the grain of the wood. The work may be polished | 
with wax or French-polish, or varnished. Varnish ~ 
may be rubbed to a good dull finish with a piece of 
felt dipped in water and rotten stone while the work is 
revolving at a slow speed, but the student must také 
care not to press hard on the felt, or to allow it to 
become dry while he is doing this. Be careful not to 
rub off corners. Oil instead of water will produce a 
finer finish but it is apt to soften the varnish if it is 
used continuously on one part. If you use oil, work 
rapidly and remove the moisture from the varnish as 
soon as you have obtained a polish. 
144. Some Easy Ways of Finishing Turned Work.— 
One of the easiest ways of finishing mahogany, wal- 
nut, and oak is to smooth the wood very carefully
-P-A-G-E-167
  TURNED WORK 167 
with fine sandpaper while it is revolving; then to re- 
move all transverse lines that the sandpaper has 
made, by rubbing it in the direction of the grain; 
following this, to smooth the work by holding a hand- 
ful of fine shavings against the wood while it is revolv- 
ing; and finally to polish with raw linseed oil and 
turpentine (two-thirds oil and one-third turpentine 
simmered together over a slow fire for five or six 
hours). Do not attempt to apply a great deal of oil at 
atime. The oil is really of more service as a darken- 
ing lubricant than as a polishing agent. A piece of 
billiard felt is the best thing for rubbing turning wood. 
A finish will be obtained much more quickly if a coat 
of thin shellac is applied to the work after one coat of 
oil has been given to it. 
Another easy and excellent manner of polishing 
turned work is to use wax. Stain the wood with an 
oil stain, if it is not to be finished in the natural color, 
and apply a coat of thin shellac. Polish the project 
with wax while it is revolving in the lathe. Do not 
apply a large quantity of wax at a time. It is better 
to go over the work once and then leave it ten minutes 
to harden. It may then be polished with a piece of 
billiard felt or other woolen cloth. Repeat the process 
until a good gloss is obtained. If an aged appearance 
is desired use white wax (paraffin and turpentine to 
which has been added a little zinc white) for polish- 
ing. This will show in the grain of the dark wood as 
gray streaks, a very pleasing effect upon some de- 
signs. The wax may be colored, of course, with any 
of the chrome colors to suit the needs of the work.

Frntsuinc-Room 
Sandpaper. A good quality of garnet paper in sizes 
ranging from No. 1 to'No. 000 is always serviceable. 
Containers. Several good clean quart jars with cov- 
ers, several tin containers with friction lids, and a few 
flat sauce dishes into which to pour varnish and shellac 
for immediate use, are necessary. These should be 
kept clean at all times. It is good shop ethics for the 
student to take care of all brushes and dishes that he 
uses as soon as he has finished his work. 
Oil. A gallon of pure linseed oil is a necessity in 
every shop. Only the best quality of oil is worth buy- 
ing as a cheap grade will do more harm than good to 
any work. 
Turpentine. Insist upon having turpentine that is 
marked Pure Spirits of Turpentine. Nothing else will 
do. 
Alcohol. Denatured alcohol 188 proof will serve the 
needs of the shop quite well. A gallon of wood alcohol 
may be used instead of commercial varnish remover if 
a great deal of refinishing is to be done. Ordinarily, 
however, two quarts of denatured alcohol will be 
sufficient. 
Brushes. The number of brushes will depend upon 
the work which is projected. If painting and enamel- 
ing are to be done extra brushes will be needed. Two 
varnish brushes and two for shellac are indispensable. 
168
-P-A-G-E-169
  
EQUIPMENT FOR FINISHING ROOM 169 
One of each of these should be of a good width for large 
surfaces such as table tops (21% or 3 inches), the others 
smaller for more minute work (about seven-eighths of 
an inch). Do not use the same brush for shellac and 
varnish. 
Care must be taken in choosing brushes. A cheap 
brush is worthless at any time. You will save a great 
deal of inconvenience and trouble by buying good 
brushes and taking care of them. An old paint brush 
makes a good tool for applying paste filler, and a fine 
camel’s hair brush will be necessary for imitating 
grain formation on straight-grained wood. Read over 
Sec. 83 on the care of brushes. It will be time well 
spent. One brush of a convenient size and cheaper 
quality is all that is necessary for applying stain. It 
must be cleaned like other brushes after it is used, and 
carefully dried. 
Silex. Two pounds of finely powdered silex is neces- 
sary for making fillers. It is much cheaper to make 
your own fillers than to buy them already prepared. 
Silica. Three pounds of silica may be used to sup- 
plement the silex in cheaper work. It makes, ground 
in oil, an excellent filler. 
Burnt Umber. A pound or more of burnt umber is 
a constant necessity in every finishing-room. It is very 
imexpensive, as indeed are all the pigments listed 
here. 
Burnt and Raw Sienna. These pigments ground in 
oil are among the most common needed for stains and 
fillers. A pound of each should be sufficient. 
Chrome Colors. A few of the ordinary colors should 
be kept in stock for coloring wax and oil stains.
-P-A-G-E-170
    
170 : WOOD-FINISHING 
Drop Black. This product is much better than lamp- 
black for making colored fillers and stains. A pound 
of this should be enough. 
Van Dyke Brown. Like burnt umber this pigment 
is in constant use where students are working with 
oak, ash, mahogany, and walnut. 
Mahogany Red. A pound of this powder is neces- 
sary in making stains. Be sure to get that which is 
soluble in water. 
Mahogany Brown. With this powder a great variety 
of shades from deep red to deep brown may be ob- 
tained. As with the former, be sure to get a water 
soluble powder. 
Potassium Bichromate. A pound of these erystals 
is a necessity in obtaining the rich brown effects seen 
on oak and mahogany. 
Ammonia. If fuming is to be done be sure to get full 
strength (specific gravity 880) ammonia. 
Aniline Dyes. It is well to have on hand a few of 
the common colors in aniline dyes of three kinds, wa- 
ter soluble, oil soluble, and spirit soluble. They are 
very inexpensive and excellent for students’ use. In 
using them, the student will have to guard against mak- 
ing too strong a stain. They are very strong, and a 
small quantity (about one ounce to the gallon of sol- 
vent) will usually be sufficient. 
Alkanet Root. This is a reddish powder which is 
soluble in oil. As a coloring for mahogany it is un- 
surpassed. To make the stain, suspend four ounces 
of the powder, contained in a piece of muslin, in a 
pint of linseed oil. A day will be necessary for the 
stain to become sufficiently strong. After this the sack
-P-A-G-E-171
  EQUIPMENT FOR FINISHING ROOM 171 
may be removed from the oil and the stain placed in 
a well-stopped jar. 
Pumice. The ‘best pumice for rubbing shellac or 
varnish is obtained from Europe. The American 
pumice is apt to be gritty. <A fine grade of pumice 
is best for general work, but even this should be 
sifted thru a muslin ‘‘pounce bag.’’ No. FF. pumice 
is fine enough for ordinary manual training needs. 
Rotten-stone. This should be kept in a dry place, 
and used only for extra fine finishes. Buy it in pow- 
dered form. It is very inexpensive, costing from eight 
to ten cents a pound usually. Three or four pounds 
will be sufficient for the small shop. 
Felt. A good piece of harness felt makes a suitable 
rubbing pad for shellac or varnish. If you wish some- 
thing better order two pounds of hard or soft Mexi- 
ean felt. 
Wax. Both paraffin and beeswax are used as polish- 
ing agents. The beeswax is most commonly used, altho 
paraffin takes a higher gloss. The latter is more easily 
destroyed however. It is usually well for the student 
to mix his own wax for polishing, because it is much 
less expensive and serves its purpose admirably. 
Many of the prepared floor waxes are excellent. A 
pound of beeswax or paraffin would be sufficient for the 
needs of a small shop unless a great deal of this work 
is to be done. 
Shellac. The shellac may be bought in prepared 
form (dissolved in alcohol), or in gum form. For gen- 
eral use the prepared form is much more convenient 
than the other, but it will have to be thinned consider- 
ably before it is used. Every manual training shop 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
172 WOOD-FINISHING 
will need at least a quart of pure orange shellac and 
a quart of bleached or white shellac. Be sure to keep 
the containers of these well corked as alcohol evap- 
orates very rapidly. ‘ Under no circumstances allow 
water or oil to be put into the shellac. Do not keep 
shellac in tin cans, the metal will discolor it. 
Varnish. At least two kinds of varnish will be neces- 
sary for interior work: an elastic oil varnish of any 
good quality for work which will be subjected to hard 
usage, and a rubbing varnish which is more brittle 
(shorter in oil) but which takes a higher polish for 
fine finishing. In buying any varnish, it is well to buy 
the best quality and to rely upon the honesty of the 
manufacturer in his suggestions of the use to which 
the particular kind is best adapted. A word of warn- 
ing should be added to the student: do not depend too 
much on the value of the many widely advertised spe- 
cial varnishes. Buy a good, staple varnish from a 
reliable company. . You have then something upon 
which to fall back if it is not satisfactory. The great- 
est care will be necessary in selecting the rubbing var- 
nish for this will be in almost constant demand by the 
manual training department. There are many good 
pale copal varnishes on the market, altho the word 
copal now signifies nothing in regard to the value of 
the varnish. If the work calls for perfectly trans- 
parent finishing use white shellac in preference to 
damar varnish as the latter is too soft for final coating. 
Rags. A quantity of cotton waste, burlap and 
washed white muslin should be kept on hand.

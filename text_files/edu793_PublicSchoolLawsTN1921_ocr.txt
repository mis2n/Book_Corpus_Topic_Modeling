boards of education and county high school boards of 21

education, and all special school districts created by legis- 
lative enactment are exempt from the operation of this 
Act. 
This law provides for a board of seven members elected 
by the county court at its July term, 1921, one member 
for one year. one for two years, one for three years, one 
for four years, one for five years, one for six years, and 
one for seven years, the term of one member expiring each 
year. The purpose of this Jaw is to make possible the 
continuity of policy in the administration of school af- 
fairs by retaining experienced members on the Board of 
Education. - 
All high sehool funds and property and all elementary 
schoo] funds and property shall be under the control of 
the County Board of Education and must be administer- 
ed separately. 
Section & of the above Act provides. that the school 
census shall be-taken under the direction of the County 
Board of Education during the month of May, 1921, and 
bi-ennially thereafter. For this service the Board shall 
pay not less than 4 per cent per capita. 
  
Nore.—There has been some discussion concerning the 
extent of this law.. For the information of those inter- 
ested the Department of Education publishes the opinion 
of the State’s Attorney-General, which follows: 
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, May 7, 1921. 
Mr, A. A, Alexander, Wilson County, Mt. Juliet, Tennes- 
see. 
Dear Sir: A general bill was passed and approved 
April 2ist.. Under it the offices of county high school 
board of education, county board of education, district 
advisory board and district school directors are abolished _ 
and all public schools in the State are required to be 
under the management and control of county boards of 
education therein provided for. To this end all school 
property now under the control and management of the’
-P-A-G-E-25
PUBLIC SCHOOL LAWS OF TENNESSEE 
boards abolished is to revert to and be under the man- 
agement and control of the county board of education 
created by said general aet. 
There is a proviso in the eleventh section of this act 
which is as follows: / 
“Provided that nothing in this bill shall be con- 
strued as applying or affecting in any manner coun- 
ties now operating under County Elementary Board 
of Education and County High Schoo] Boards of Edu- 
cation, and provided that nothing in this bill shall 
be construed as applying or limiting the duties of 
such Special Schoo] Districts as may have already 
been created in this State by the Legislature.” 
It is my opinion that this first proviso is entirely 
valueless and void, because there is no Jaw applicable to 
any county in Tennessee authorizing a county elementary 
board of education and a county high school board of 
education. So that the proviso is left without anything 
to apply to. It would not apply to a county which has 
a county board of education with a district advisory 
board and also a county high school board which is the 
general rule in Tennessee, because the proviso can only 
apply in counties which have'a county elementary board 
and also a county high school board. So this particular 
proviso, in my opinion, will have to be elided from the 
statute. 
The second proviso is: 
“Nothing in the act shall be construed as applying 
or limiting the duties of such special school districts 
as may have already been created in this State by the 
Legislature.” 
The effect of this proviso would be and is to let the 
special school districts already created stand as existing 
but leave the management and control of same not in the 
special school district directors but in the county board 
of education created by this act. So all special school 
districts in existence on April 21st, when this bill was 23
-P-A-G-E-26
PUBLIC SCHOOL LAWS OF TENNESSEE 
approved, will remain but will be administered under the 
laws creating them by the county board of education and 
not by the district directors. ‘ 
Now, the question arises as to whether the Mt. Juliet 
special school district had been created by this special 
act and was in existence prior to Apri] 21st, when the 
general act was passed. If it was, then it remains such 
special school district, but the school and the district 
must be controlled and managéd by the county board of 
education created by the general act. 
The first section declares that a special and inde- 
pendent school district is created and established there- 
by and gives the boundaries of it. The second section 
provides that said Mt. Juliet special schoo] district and 
the inhabitants thereof are thereby declared a body 
politic and incorporate, and as such shall have perpetual 
succession, shall sue and be sued, plead and be pleaded 
against in all courts of law and equity and any actions 
whatsoever. That it may purchase and receive real es- 
tate, personal property, etc. The third section provides 
that this special school district shail be governed and con- 
trolled by a board or commission consisting of five mem- 
bers, etc., and names the same. This district and the in- 
habitants thereof are created a body politic. 
This act, in my opinion, perfects it as a special school 
district. Its management, however, is to be under a 
board of five directors. J think the general act operates 
to permit this school district thus created to stand, but 
that it repeals that part of the act which invests the 
management and control of it in the district directors 
and vests the same in the county board created by the 
general act. 
I, therefore, think that this special school district 
will have to be managed and controlled by the county 
board of education, but in the manner and under the 
terms and conditions set forth in the special act, coupled, 
of course, with the duties placed upon the county com-

mission by the genera] act. 
I am returning herewith the special act which you 
gave me. . 
Yours truly, 
Frank M. THOMPSON, 
Attorney-General. 
ITEMIZED BUDGET COVERING OPERATING EX- 
PENSES OF COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM RE- 
QUIRED. 
  
(Cuapter 2, Acts 1921.) 
Senate Bill 51 provides that County Boards of Edu- 
cation must make out an itemized budget covering the 
annual expense of operating the county school system 
and submit the same to the County Court at its July 
session, 1921, and annually thereafter. 
In counties not now operating under the county Board 
law the County Superintendent must necessarily make 
up an itemized budget covering the operating expenses 
of the county school system and submit same for the ap- 
rroval of the newly elected Board of Education, who in 
turn shall recommend the same to the County Court for 
its adoption. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT LAW. 
  
(Cuarrer 119, Acts 1921.) 
The County Supertendents’ Law, Senate Bill 866, pro- 
vides for the election of the County Superintendent by 
the County Court for a period of four years, (effective 
Jan. 1, 1928,) fixing the minimum State supplement at 
$500 and the maximum at $1,000, effective July, 1921. 
No county paying less than $500 as annual salary to 
the County Superintendent is eligible to participate in 
this fund. This does not mean, however, that a limit is 
placed on the maximum salary the county may pay. 25
-P-A-G-E-28
26 PUBLIC SCHOOL LAWS OF TENNESSEE 
This Jaw further provides that applicants for county 
superintendency before the State or local examiners, 
shall furnish evidence of having had at least two years of 
college or normal training, plus twenty-four months 
teaching experience. College and university graduates 
are entitled to county superintendents’ certificates with- 
out examination, provided the applicants have completed 
three units in education and have taught at least twenty- 
four months. 
TAX LEVY FOR MAINTENANCE OF FIRST CLASS 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
  
(Cuarter 40, Acts 1921.) 
Senate Bill 365 requires every county in the State to 
levy a tax sufficient for the maintenance of one first class 
high school for a term of nine months each year. Such 
levy to be based upon a budget as furnished by the county 
Superintendent at the April term of the County Court. 
CERTIFICATES OF EX-SERVICE MEN. 
  
(Cuaprer 189, Acrs 1921.) 
All term certificates of ex-service men are renewd and 
made valid for a period of five years, the renewed certifi- 
cate being of the same grade as that originally issued.

   PREFACE 
Tue Irish race has from the start played a large part in the making of America. The Irish constituted 
one of the largest sections of the Colonial population. They were influential in the opening and settlement 
of the frontier and in the early spread of popular education. They were in the forefront of the struggle 
for American independence. By virtue of their numbers and their strong individuality Americans of Irish 
lineage early placed their stamp upon American life, institutions and temperament. 
Not the least of the contributions made by the Irish to America has been their folk music. This has 
taken root so completely ‘that it has come to be considered typically American, and certain tunes have 
become some of the best-loved “‘old fashioned’? American melodies. Who does not know and love such 
laughing, lilting, dancing airs as “The White Cockade,” “Irish Washerwoman,” “Garry Owen,” “Saint 
Patrick’s Day,” and the like? 
Since we have adopted Irish music so completely, it seems to me quite natural that we should also feel 
the appeal of Irish dancing, which is so closely associated with the music. Comparatively few in America 
‘seem to know of the existence of Irish dances other than the difficult and comparatively modern step and 
solo dances which « are seen in demonstrations and competitions. Little is known here of the Irish group 
     
    ich only a few simple steps are employe d which 
dances the wor 
Therefore it is with the hope of sharing | with ot s e I have experienced in dancing them 
in Ireland that I have, in this present collection, described twenty- es of the group da     eal jad the social element common to fo have the simplicit 
me most practicable and desirable for both social and recreational use in America. 
These-dances are essentially the dances of Ireland. They are of the country, of the nation, of the people 
of Ireland, and do not belong-to~ any~one" ‘section, “afiy one age or any one class or generation. They are 
traditional-and~characteristic of the Irish people, possessing definite attributes which distinguish them 
from the dances of other nationalities. They are therefore i in the true sense of the word folk dances. In 
Treland, howevet ther ase-caled-national dances. cath 1 regarded as a 
modern e i The term ‘national dances,”f am told, has a significance there which exactly suits 
fem—the word ‘nas ins manos ih ‘ato Julie sumthing eed by od and 
belonging to the_nation_as—a-whole.—For—this-reason I have chosen™“‘National Dances of Ireland” 
the title of the present volume.    
The preparation of this collection for publication has been made possible through the courtesy and 
cooperation of Mr. J. M. Lang of Dublin, who collected the dances from original sources and who is, I 
believe, considered the leading authority on the national dances of Ireland, besides being himself a cham- 
pion dancer. 
The photographs used to illustrate the text were taken purposely at a crossroads to give them local 
color, on account of the old association of these dances with Crossroad dancing. Regarding them, Mr. 
Lang writes me that: “The dresses a i old Celtic design. The men in the 
country generally take off their_ceats when-they-proceed to dance, and the knee breeches are the genuine 
old Irish garment. The ladies’ dressgs_are-all.ofold Celtic design, with the famous Tara Brooch holding 
over the shoulder the flowing piece which falls down over the back. Furthermore, we have in these groups : a é some of the finest dancers in Ireland!” eeelieen

  vi PREFACE 
For the cover design the famous Tara Brooch, the original of which is in the Hibernian Museum in 
Dublin, was chosen because of its beauty and its association with early Irish tradition. 
It it in all humility that I present this volume to the public view, for it is inevitable that various 
inaccuracies and mistakes will be found. This is due to the fact that the descriptions of the dances have 
been written in America since my last visit to Ireland, and there has been no opportunity for personal 
conferences on doubtful points or a complete and careful checking up of details with proper authorities. 
Therefore I beg indulgence for this work, and will welcome any criticisms and suggestions regarding it. 
It is my joy in these dances and my conviction that they will add beauty and color to American life 
that has given me the temerity to publish them in this form.

FOREWORD 
Tue publication in America of this collection of the National Dances of Ireland has made a long 
cherished hope of mine an accomplished fact. From my earliest days I have had for the Dances and Dance 
Music of Ireland an affection that at times amounted to a passion. As my boyhood was passed amongst 
people with whom Irish dances, music and song formed the basis of every social function, I was afforded 
exceptional opportunities of acquiring a keen taste for those national dances. In later years, as a 
member of the Gaelic League in Dublin, I threw myself “enthusiastically into the study of these 
beautiful dances and became an ardent participant in the movement which aimed at restoring them to 
that place of honor in the social life of the nation which justly belonged to them. 
Favorable opportunities continued to stimulate my natural love of these dances and at the numerous 
Ceilide, Feiseanna, and other Irish social functions, at that time frequently held both in the Metropolis 
and the Provinces, I got into close touch with the best sources of first-hand knowledge and reliable informa- 
tion relating to everything that appertained to Irish Dances and Dance Music. I then conceived the 
idea of making an exhaustive collection of all the Irish Dances and interesting matter relating to them 
that came within my ken. The work, though laborious and tedious in itself, being a work of love, 
was to me a source of great interest and genuine pleasure. I succeeded eventually in getting together an 
excellent collection of dances from various quarters and I carefully committed to paper as many of them 
as would lend themselves to such treatment. In the year 1913, I founded in Dublin a School for the 
cultivation and preservation of the National Dances of Ireland which succeeded admirably until the Great 
European War created difficulties which could only be overcome by the aid of a considerably larger amount | 
of working capital than I had at my disposal. 
When Miss Burchenal came to Ireland in the year 1913 for the purpose of giving an Institute of Inter- 
national Folk Dancing—which was carried out in the Lord Mayor’s Mansion House, Dublin, with her 
characteristic ability and masterly success—I had the honor of being introduced to her and was impressed 
with her viewpoint regarding the particular value of simple group folk dances as recreation. I acquainted 
her with the work in which I was engaged and found her keenly interested in it. So much so in fact, that 
she devoted all of her available time during the remainder of her stay in Ireland to the study of Irish 
dances. The more she saw—and danced—of our charming Irish dances the more highly enthusiastic she 
became, and instinctively realizing how welcome those grand old dances and music would be amongst 
the great Irish Race in America she proposed that we should cooperate in producing a collection of them 
for publication in the United States. To this I readily assented for it meant to me the realization of my 
long cherished hope. Later the work was begun, but we had not proceeded very far with the project when 
the entry of America into the Great War created such an intensely difficult situation that we were com- 
pelled to suspend operations. For reasons over which we had no control, we were unable to resume work 
until this year and it is entirely due to Miss Burchenal’s untiring zeal and ability that, in spite of 
tremendous difficulties, the work was eventually completed in record time. 
It is scarcely necessary to mention that this is not intended to be anything like a complete collection 
of the National Dances of Ireland, but is simply a selection of twenty-five covering a varied range from the 
oldest types, such as the Rinnce-fada, to the most modern, such as the Gates of Derry, and the Spinning 
Wheel Dance.

  Wills FOREWORD 
I may mention here en passant that many of these dances are danced with certain differences in 
various parts of Ireland and, in fact, at the present time, different versions of the same dance may be 
observed in the various Gaelic circles in Dublin. This, of course, is due to the absence of a central 
recognized authority on the subject, and until such authority is established no general uniformity of 
practice can be hoped for. 
In conclusion, I desire to acknowledge our gratitude and indebtedness to Mr. Arthur Darley, the 
eminent solo violinist and authority on Irish music, for his valuable advice and assistance in connection 
with the selection of dance tunes, and also to the dancers through whose kindness and courtesy the 
photographic illustrations published in this volume were secured.

THE MUSIC 
The most popular national instrument for the 
playing of Irish dance music is the Irish bagpipe (see 
Frontispiece), but for convenience the music in this 
collection is arranged for piano. The dance tunes 
given are all traditional Irish music with the excep- 
tion of “The Donegal Jig,” which is a characteristic 
Irish jig composed by Arthur Darley, the eminent 
Irish musician and authority on Irish music, and 
graciously given by him for use in this collection. 
All of the tunes are in ordinary jig time (single 
jigs and double jigs) or reel time, with one exception, 
the Fox Hunters’ Jig, which is in hop jig, or 9/8 
time. 
A few of the tunes belong to certain specific dances 
of the same names (such as the Fox Hunters’ Jig, 
Humours of Bandon, etc.), but as a general rule any 
dance in jig or reel time may be danced to any 
regular jig or reel tune. 
A selection of some of the best of the old Irish 
dance tunes has been made for this collection, and 
for the sake of convenience one tune has been as- 
signed to each of the dances described. This does 
not mean, however, that the musician should be 
limited to that particular tune in playing for thé 
dance—on the contrary, other tunes can and should 
be used to avoid monotonous repetition. In olden 
times, it would appear from investigation,.the piper, 
generally“played-several-turres~during=the=p rogress 
eee Seceee up con- 
siderably and enabled him to display his ability and 
versati ity. 1s Cus m Ireland by authorities, and is strongly recommended 
as the best and most correct method. 
Irish dance tunes for figure dancing consist, as a 
general rule (though there are exceptions), of two 
parts of eight measures each (A-and-B)y~and-each~of 
these two parts must orm with 
the construction of the dance. The musician should, 
thereforé;"Observe carefully the repeats as indicated 
in the music. 
The Introduction. 
In playing for a dance the musician should always 
play the first eight bars of the music (A) through, as 
an Introduction, and during this introduction the 
dancers stand ready, in proper formation, for the 
dance. Then, without any pause, the musician 
starts all over again at the beginning of the music 
(whereupon the dance begins) and plays the first 
eight bars (A) with the repeat as indicated before 
going on to the second strain of eight bars (B).} In 
other words, at the start of a dance Part A is played 
three times. Thereafter, however, the Introduction 
is omitted when the whole piece of music is repeated 
and Part A is played only twice as written. 
The Conclusion. 
In the progressive Long Dances and others which 
have no definite finish the musician usually deter- 
\ mines the length of the dance, though sometimes the 
leader of the dance claps his hands as a signal to the 
musician to bring it to a close. 
THE DANCES 
The dances described in thjs_collection are Figure 
Dances~in—group=fortifation, as distinct froth Irish 
Step Dances, or Solo Dances. 
They are simple and easy to perform (requiring a 
knowledge of only the most elementary steps) and 
lend themselves well to recreational and social use. 
For convenience they have been classified here as 
Round Dancess-Squaré~ Dances and™bong: Dances, 
with one Dance ree (The Galway Reel) which 
does not*fall u eads and is there- 
fore classed by itself. renting Round Dances. 
The ordinary Round Dance has a certain definite

Square Dances. 
The Square Dances have been classified thus, 
rather untechnically, perhaps, because of their 
sq ; but they are of the same char- 
acter and constructio~~as—the—typieal—= Round 
Dose Long Dances. 
The Long Dances are the counthias|®r contra) 
dances which aré ed in longways formation, as in 
the Waves of Tory, Rinnce Fada, etc. This type of 
dances is progressive for any number of couples. Each 
couple progresses one place lower (or higher, as the 
case may be) int ion of the dance 
and the dance may be continued as long as desired. — errr meee 
STYLE AND HANDGRASPS 
The style to be cultivated in these dances is one 
of simplicity and unstudied grace. The carriage of 
the body_should.be natural, upright and easy. The 
figures and steps should be executed with accuracy 
and precision, but easily without any effect of effort.

THE 
Although the dances described in this volume are 
all Figure Dances (or Group Dances), as distinct 
from the Irish Step Dances, there are a few funda- 
mental steps or movements of the feet with which 
it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar, as they are 
common to all the dances. A thorough knowledge 
of these should be acquired before attempting to 
dance any of the dances. These fundamental steps 
are as follows: 
Promenade Step (Jig or Reel Time). 
This is the simple fundamental step which is 
used in all the dances when no other step is 
specified. The commonest hand grasps are as follows: 
ee Grasp when partners are side by 
Ss ide with inside hands joined. In other words, 
when the woman is on the right of her partner 
he takes her left hand in his right. 
(2) Two-hand Grasp when partners face each 
Leother and join both hands, the man taking his 
partner’s left hand in his right and her right 
hand in his left. 
(8) Crossed-hand Grasp when partners (either 
Lacing each other or side by side) join crossed 
hands, the man taking his partner’s right hand 
in his right, and her left hand in his left. 
As a general _rule,in. the hand grasps the man’s 
hand is turnedepatrerpward and the woman’s palm 
downward. Heehands.are thus, as it were, in his 
hands. 
The elbow; 
shoulder level. d the hands are held at 
The correct position for the one-hand grasp is 
shown in Illustration A, while the crossed-hand 
grasp is shown in the illustration for the Swing 
Round on page 8. 
STEPS 
In fitting the step to the music each measure 
should be counted, “One, Two, Three.” The 
step is as follows: 
Meas. 1.) Step forward with the right foot 
(one), bring the left toe to the right heel (two), 
advance the right foot again slightly and at 
the same time lift the left foot off the ground 
(three). 
(Meas. 2.) Repeat the same step, but this time 
beginning with the left foot. Continue the step 
in this manner with the right and left foot 
alternately as long as required. It should be 
executed with a slight springiness in the step.
-P-A-G-E-21
  EXPLANATORY TEXT 5 
A variation of this step is sometimes substi- 
tuted in the case of couples advancing toward 
each other and immediately retiring. In this 
case the measures are counted thus: first 
measure, “One, Two”; second measure, ‘“‘One, 
Two, Three.” The step is as follows: 
(Meas. 1.) Beginning with the right foot take 
two walking steps forward (One, Two). 
(Meas. 2.) Step forward with the right foot 
(one), bring the left toe to the right heel (two), 
advance the right foot again and at the same time 
lift the left foot off the ground (three). 
(Meas. 3.) Beginning with the left foot take 
two walking steps backward (One, Two). 
(Meas. 4.) Beginning with the left foot make a 
promenade step backward corresponding to that 
described for Meas. 2, but backward in the reverse 
manner (one, two, three). 
27 Promenade Step (Hop Jig Time). 
5 (8) “ A still different Promenade Step is used for 
dances in Hop Jig time, but as there is only one 
instance of it in this collection the step has been 
described where it occurs, in the Fox Hunters’ 
Jig on page 93. 
ven” (Jig or Reel Time). 
“Seven” is danced both as a separate movement 
in itself and combined with ‘Two Threes” as a 
part of the Side Step. In fitting it to the music 
two consecutive measures of music are counted, 
thus: “One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, 
Seven.” ‘The step is as follows: 
eas. 1-2.) Move sideward to the right with 
the following step: with a little jump (raising 
both feet off the ground) land on the toes with the 
right foot in front of the left so that the right heel 
is over the left toe (one), move the right foot a 
short step to the right (éwo), bring the left toe 
to the right heel (three), move the right foot a 
short step to the right (fowr), bring the left toe 
to the right heel (five), move the right foot a short 
step to the right (six), bring the left toe to the 
right heel, finishing with the weight on the left 
foot, and the right foot lifted slightly off the 
ground (seven). This completes one “Seven.” 
It is repeated to the left in the same manner, 
reversing the above movements. (“Two Threes.” 
“Two Threes’’ is danced both as a separate 
movement in itself and combined with “Seven” 
as a part of the Side Step. In fitting it to the 
music each measure should be counted thus: 
“One, Two, Three.” ‘The step is as follows: 
( . 1.) Place the right toe behind the left 
€el and at the same time lift the left foot slightly 
from the ground (one), replace the left foot on 
the same spot from which it was lifted and at 
the same time lift the right foot slightly from the 
ground (two), replace the right foot behind the 
left foot on the same spot from which it was 
lifted and at the same time lift the left foot 
slightly from the ground (three). 
(Meas. 2.) Now dance another “Three” in the 
same manner, but this time placing the left foot 
behind the right heel in the reverse manner of 
that described for the first “Three.” This com- 
pletes the “Two Threes.” The step can be 
begun with either the right foot or the left as 
required where it occurs in the dance. 
(6) ste Step (Reel Time). 
The combination of movements called the “Side 
Step” consists of two distinct_parts, which are 
generally known as“the “Seven” ‘and “Two 
Threes.”” 
_ 
As each of these is really a distinct step in itself, Wi Pp 
often occurring separately from the other, they 
have been described separately above. 
The Side Step is made up of the two parts 
(a) “Seven” and (d) “Two Threes, as follows: 
a. ‘“Séven.” 
(Meas. 1-2.) -Dance “Seven” sideward to 
the right (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven). 
b. “Two Threes.” 
(Meas. 3-4.) Dance “Two Threes”’ in place, 
beginning with the right foot (one, two, three— 
one, two, three). Repeat the step sideward to 
the left in the same manner, reversing the 
above movements. 
The above is a description of the Side Step 
as ordinarily danced unless otherwise speci- 
fied in the description of a dance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22

(6) Side Step (Jig Time). 
The Side Step when danced in Jig time is 
sometimes varied at the discretion of the dancers 
by introducing the “Rise and Grind” instead of 
the “Two Threes,” i.e., it then consists of the two 
parts (a) “Seven” and (0) “Rise and Grind,” as 
follows: 
a. “Seven.” 
(Meas. 
above. 1-2.) Dance “Seven” as described 
b. “Rise and Grind.” 
(Meas. 3-4.) Dance the “Rise and Grind” 
(or Rising Step) in place. (See description of 
the Rising Step below.) 
(7) Side Step (Hop Jig Time). - 
A still different Side Step is used for dances in 
Hop Jig time, but as there is only one instance of 
it in the present collection, the step is described 
where it occurs—in the Fox Hunters’ jig on 
page 93- 
(8) Rising Step or “Rise and Grind” (Jig Time). 
This is a stationary step, that is, the dancer 
remains in place while executing it. It is danced 
only in Jig time and consists of (a) the ‘‘ Rise” 
and (b) the “Grind.” In fitting the step to the 
music it is easier if the first measure is counted “ One and Two and” and the second measure 
One—Two—Three—Four.” The step is as fol- 
lows: 
@.baRise:2r 
(Meas. 1.) Make a slight hop on the toe of 
the left foot and at the same time raise and 
extend the right foot forward with the toe 
pointed (one), hop again on the left foot and at 
the same time bring the right foot back to the 
left ankle (and), put down the right toe on the 
ground behind the left heel (two), make a 
slight hop on the right foot, at the same time 
bending the left knee so that the left foot is 
brought slightly backward without touching 
the ground (and). 
b. “Grind.” 
(Meas. 2.) Put down the left toe behind the 
right heel (one). Keeping the feet in this 
position make three more quick little steps on 
the same spot, thus, right foot (two), left foot 
(three), right foot (four), and then pause in 
this position. 
(These four little foot movements are made 
in rapid succession, thus: “‘one—two—three 
—Four,” followed by a slight pause at the 
end of the measure.) 
The whole step is now repeated, beginning 
with the other foot. 
THE FIGURES 
There are.a few fundamental figures, or evolutions, 
which are common to practically all of the dances. 
These are described in detail below. Other figures 
which are less common are explained in the descrip- 
tions of the dances where they occur. 
Diagrams. 
In the following descriptions of the figures, as well 
- asthroughout the book, diagrams are given to illus- 
trate formations and evolutions. In these diagrams 
the square is used to indicate a man and the circle 
to indicate a woman, thus: 
WI 
O aman 
a woman The small arrowhead attached to each is used to 
indicate the direction in which the dancer is facing. 
Dotted lines and arrows are used to show the direc- 
tion and course of the dancers. 
(1) Lead Round or Promenade. 
This is usually done by two or more couples in 
the following manner. Partners stand side by 
side, with the woman on the right of her partner, 
and join inside hands. The correct position for 
this is shown in Illustration A. 
(Meas. 1-8.) In this position couples dance 
forward around the circle to the right, with the 
Promenade Step, following each other at equal 
distances as shown in Diagram 1 and IIlustra- 
tion B. ; 
(Meas. 9-16.) Partners release hands, and 
face about, turning inward toward each other
-P-A-G-E-23
EXPLANATORY TEXT 7 
as they do so, that is, the woman faces about 
to her left, the man to his right. This brings 
them side by side, facing in the opposite direc- shown in Diagram 3. The position in the case 
of two parallel lines is shown in the illustration 
for the Waves of Tory on page 121.

They join inside hands and retrace their foot-

steps around the circle in the opposite direction 
inthe same manner. (See Diagram 2.) 
(2) Advance and Retire. 
This is done by two opposite couples, or two 
parallel lines of dancers, facing each other. The 
starting position in the case of two couples is The movement is as follows: 
a. Advance. 
(Meas. 1-2.) The two couples (or two paral- 
lel lines) advance toward each other with two 
Promenade Steps. 
b. Retire. 
(Meas. 3-4.) Still facing each other, the two 
couples (or two parallel lines) move backward

Steps. 
DiacraM 3 
(83) Swing Round. 
This is usually done by two couples. Partners 
stand close together and exactly face to face, with 
both hands joined, either crossed or otherwise, 
the cross-hand grasp being the most usual way at 
present and the best. The arms are bent with Left Wheel. They are executed usually by two 
couples. These two couples are facing each

the elbows down (the clasped hands at shoulder 
level) and held rigid so as to control the swing 
when the dancers are in motion. (Illustration C.) 
With this grasp partners swing each other around 
with Promenade Steps, revolving in the direction 
of the hands of the clock (as is customary in 
ordinary social dancing). As they do this the 
two couples move around after each other in a 
small circle in the direction opposite to the hands 
of the clock, as indicated in Diagram 4. 
(4) Wheel. 
There are two wheels, the Right Wheel and the a. Right Wheel. 
(Meas. 1-4.) The four dancers, each facing

across the centre of the square, i.e., the two

two women join their right hands above the 
men’s hands. In this position they dance for- 
ward around the circle in the direction of the 
hands of the clock as indicated in Diagram 6. 
  Diacram 6 
b. Left Wheel. 
(Meas. 5-8.) Releasing right hands, the 
dancers face about (turning to the right to do

so) in the opposite direction, join left hands 
diagonally across the centre of the square and 
with Promenade Steps dance forward around many as the “Grand Right and Left.” It is 
usually danced by four or more couples who are in 
circle or square formation. For the start of the 
Chain, partners face each. other and take right 
hands.

(5) Chain. 
There are various forms of the Chain, but the 
most common one is that which is known by may be. These two, who now meet, take left 
hands and, continuing to advance in the same 
direction, pass each other and release left hands.

Swing and Exchange Partners. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) Partners join crossed hands 
and with Promenade Steps swing each other 
around in place. (Meas. 5-6.) Releasing left hands only, 
partners raise their joined right hands. Each 
man, marking time with Promenade Steps, 
turns his partner once around in place under 
their raised arms, and as he does so, he places 
her on his left side. Partners bow slightly to 
each other and release hands. (This brings all 
the dancers into their original circle formation 
except that partners are in exchanged positions.) 
(Meas. 7-8.) Each man turns and bows to 
the new woman on his right who at the same 
time turns and bows to him. They do not 
dance as they do this but stand quiet. Then 
all join hands in a ring ready to start the dance 
again from the beginning with new partners. 
(Nore:—There is a simple alternative for this 
closing movement of the dance, which is perhaps 
the more popular, as follows: 
When the men leave the center from the “Rose” 
formation, each man simply returns to his 
partner, joins crossed hands with her, swings 
her around in place with promenade steps and 
finishes with her on his left side. All then 
join hands in a ring to recommence the dance.) 
The dance is continued in this manner as long 
as desired with each woman passing on one 
place farther to the left and each man one 
place farther to the right at each repetition.

RINNCE MOR DUN NA NGALL 
DONEGAL ROUND DANCE 
(Round Dance in Reel Time for any Number of Couples) 
This dance lends itself delightfully for popular use 
because it is short and simple and any number of 
couples may take part in it. 
The music suggested here for it is “Peter Street” 
(though any other good reel or reels may be used), 
consisting of two parts of eight measures each (A and 
B), each of which is repeated. THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step and the Side Step (“Seven ”’and “Two Threes”’) 
FORMATION 
Any number of couples (with each woman on the 
right of her partner) form a ring and take numbers 
as shown in Diagram 1.

RINNCE AN PHIOBAIRE 
THE PIPER’S DANCE 
(Round Dance in Double Jig Time for Six Couples) 
The Pipers’ Dance, from its title and formation 
would seem to have some association with a very old 
Irish custom. It is said that at the old country 
“dance gatherings the piper was usually paid for his 
services by voluntary contributions from the men 
dancers. These contributions were put into the 
piper’s hat which was placed on the floor for the 
purpose after the last dance. 
It_is supposed that originally the Pipers’ Dance 
was danced by a large number of couples, with the 
piper seated in the centre. At the present time, 
however, it is usually danced by six couples, though 
it may also be danced by eight, ten or more. 
The music given here is a popular old jig which 
consists of two parts, (A) of four measures, and 
(B) of eight measures, each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step, Side Step (““Seven” and “Two Threes”’) and 
the Rising Step (‘Rise and Grind’’). FORMATION 
Six (or eight, ten, etc.) couples form a circle and 
take numbers as indicated in Diagram 1. In each 
nis

on the right of her partner, facing so that their left 
side is toward the centre of the circle. In this posi- 
tion partners join inside hands,

A. (Meas. 1-4.) All Lead Round to the right in 
the usual manner, with four Promenade Steps. 
During the fourth Promenade Step, partners 
release hands and face about in the opposite 
. direction. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) Partners join inside hands 
again (the woman is now on the left of her 
partner) and Lead Round in the opposite direc- 
tion, to original places, where they release hands, 
separate, and face each other. (The men and 
women thus finish in two circles: the women 
at outside facing inward, and the men inside, 
facing outward, as indicated in Diagram 2.)

(Diagram 3.) During thel fourth Promenade 
Step they release hands and face about in the 
opposite direction. 
(Meas. 9-12.) Partners join inside hands 
again (the woman is now on the left of her 
partner) and lead around in the opposite direc- 
tion to original places, where they release hands 
and face each other as before, except that this 
time the men form the outer circle and face

and ‘‘Two Threes’’) simultaneously, each odd 
couple going to the man’s left and each even 
couple to the man’s right. (In doing this, each 
odd couple, with hands joined, pass between 
and exchange places with an even couple.) 
While dancing the “ Two Threes ” partners of 
the odd couples release hands and move back 
from each other. 
Right Wheel. 
(Meas. 9-12.) The couples who have just 
exchanged places with each other (Couples One 
and Two; Three and Four; Five and Six) join 
right hands across the centre forming a right 
wheel (Diagram 5) and dance half way around 
to the left with Promenade Steps until each 
couple reach their own place. Here all release 
hands, and partners, facing each other, fall back 
from each other.

Left Wheel. 
(Meas. 9-12.) Thesame couples as before now 
join left hands across the centre, forming a left 
wheel and dance half way around to the right 
to original positions, where they release hands. (The men now form the inner and the women 
the outer circle as in Diagram 2.) 
Double Chain. 
A. (Meas. 1-4, 1-4.) B. (Meas. 5-10.) All dance 
the Double Chain with sixteen Promenade Steps. 
[The Double Chain is peculiar to this particular 
dance and quite different from the ordinary 
Chain. In executing it, partners move together 
in the same direction instead of singly in oppo- 
site directions. It is, therefore, a Chain danced 
by couples instead of single individuals. The 
figure is as follows: 
All the odd couples move forward around the 
circle to the right (in the direction opposite to

move around in the circle to the left in the 
direction of the hands of the clock.

Two, Three and Four, Five and Six, etc.) face 
each other—all the odd couples with inside

who separate to let them through. The 
sodd couples now release hands while the 
even couples join hands and each, proceeding 
in the same direction, pass by the next couple, 
each even couple passing between the new odd 
couple, and the odd couple separating to let 
them go through. 
All continue in this manner, each odd couple 
alternately passing with joined hands between 
an even couple and separating to permit the 
next even couple to pass between them, and 
vice versa for the even couples. 
The route of the odd couples is shown in Diagram 7 and the route of the even couples 
in Diagram 8.] 
Swing Round. 
(Meas. 11-12.) During these last two meas- 
ures of the strain, partners join crossed hands 
and finish the dance by swinging round (one 
turn only) in whatever place they happen to be 
at the time. This place now becomes their 
new position for the second round of the dance. 
The dance may be repeated (with the Intro- 
duction omitted) as many times as the dancers 
wish.

SIXTEEN-HAND REEL 
(Round Dance in Reel Time for Eight Couples) 
The Sixteen-hand Reel is a good example of the 
typical Round Dance, consisting of the Opening, 
Body, Figures and Finish. The Twelve-hand Reel, 
of which no separate description is given, is danced 
in exactly the same manner as described here for the 
Sixteen-hand Reel except that it is danced by six 
couples instead of eight. 
The music given here for it is “Miss McCloud’s 
Reel” which consists of the usual two parts of eight 
measures each (A and B), each of which is repeated. 
It is suggested, however, that, as this is a dance of 
considerable length, the musician should change off 
to various other reels to avoid monotony. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step and the Side ‘Step (“Seven’” and ‘Two 
Threes”’). FORMATION 
Eight couples, numbered as shown in Diagram 1, 
stand in a circle, facing the centre, with the woman 
of each couple on the right of her partner.

tion in the usual manner. 
II. BODY 
Side Step. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) All sixteen dancers dance the 
Side Step (“Sever.”” and “Two Threes’’). In 
37 doing this, each man dances to his right, passing 
behind his partner, and each woman dances to 
her left, thus exchanging places with each other. 
(Meas. 13-16.) All repeat the same in the 
opposite direction. In doing this, each man 
dances to his left (this time passing in front of 
his partner) and each woman dances to her 
right, so that all return to their own places. 
Rings. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) The dancers join hands in 
four small Rings of two couples each, and dance 
the Side Step (““Seven” and “Two Threes’’) 
around to the right, then release hands. (The 
four Rings are formed by the following couples:

cle. The Chain is described on page 9. (See 
Illustration G.) 
B. (Meas. 9-16.) When partners meet they 
join crossed hands, and each man, without 
changing his own direction, brings his partner 
around beside him so that they both face in 
the same direction with her on his right. In 
this position couples all dance on in the direc- 
tion in which the men were going (i.e., around 
the circle to the right) until they reach their 
original positions where they release hands and 
face toward the centre of the set.

which has the usual two strains of eight measures 
each, A and B, each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade FORMATION

three thus finish in line in original positions. 
(Line 2 in the meantime has danced this figure 
in exactly the same manner, with the Second 
Woman and the Third Man forming the arch 
as described above for the First Man and First 
Woman, while the man passes through as

(Round Dance in Reel Time 
This is another circle dance which does not follow 
the usual construction of the Round Dances. The 
music given here for this dance is a popular old reel. 
Any other good reel, or series of reels, may be used 
for it equally well. There are two strains of eight 
measures each, A and B, each of which is re- 
peated. OF BARLEY

THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Prome- 
nade Step and the Side Step (““Seven” and ‘‘Two

FORMATION 
Any number of couples (each with the woman on 
the right of her partner) form a circle. Partners

dance once around in a Figure Eight with 
Promenade Steps. (See detailed explanation 
of the Figure Eight with diagram on page Io 
of the explanatory text.) 
The two trios dance this figure at the same 
time, but independently of each other. When 
the figure is completed all are again in their 
original positions.

FIONNALA—FOUR-HAND REEL NO. 2 
(Square Dance in Reel Time for Two Couples) 
This is another Square Dance for two couples 
which has the same construction as the Round 
Dances. This dance is short, however, as it has 
but one Figure. 
The music given here for it is “Blackberry Blos- 
som” which is in two parts of eight measures each, 
A and B, each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step and Side Step (““Seven” and “Two Threes”’). FORMATION 
Two couples stand facing each other, with each 
woman on the right of her partner, forming a square.

FOUR-HAND REEL NO. 1 
(Square Dance in Reel Time for Two Couples) 
> Though this dance is called a “Square Dance’ 
because the four dancers stand in square formation 
at the start, it has the typical construction of the 
Round Dances, that is, it consists of the following 
parts: the Opening, Body, Figures and Finish. 
The music given here for it, “Apples in Winter,” 
is in two parts, A of four measures repeated and B, 
of eight measures repeated. THE SILERS 
The steps used during the dance are the Promenade 
Step, Side Step and the “Seven” and “Two Threes” 
separately. 
FORMATION 
The formation is the same as for the preceding 
dance, Fionnala; that is, two couples stand facing 
each other with each woman on the right of her 
partner.

A. (Meas. 1-4, 1-4.) Partners join inside hands 
and, with Promenade Steps, Lead Round after 
each other in a circle in the usual manner. 
When they reach their original positions they 
release hands and face about (partners turning 
toward each other as they do so). 
B. (Meas. 5-12.) Joining hands again (this time 
the woman’s right hand is in the man’s left 
as she is now on his left side) they return around 
the circle in the opposite direction in the same 
manner, finishing in original positions where 
they release hands and fall back into the original 
square formation. 
II. BODY 
The Square. 
B. (Meas. 5-6.) The two men dance “ Seven” 
each to his own right, and at the same time the

PLEIREACA NA BANNDAN 
HUMOURS OF BANDON—FOUR-HAND JIG 
(Square Dance in Double Jig Time for Two Couples) 
This is called a Square Dance merely because of its 
starting formation. It has, however, the typical 
Round Dance construction, consisting of the cus- 
tomary Opening, Body, Figures and Finish. 
The music given here for it is “The Humours of 
Bandon” which belongs to the dance. It consists 
of the usual two parts of eight measures each, A and 
B, each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade Step and the Side Step (“Seven” and ‘Two 
Threes”). Sometimes the ‘Rise and Grind” is 
used instead of the “Two Threes.’”’ This is a matter 
of choice. ‘‘Two Threes,’’ however, seems to be the 
more generally favored of the two. 
FORMATION 
The two couples (each with the woman on the 
right of her partner) stand facing each other in 
square formation as in Fionnala and the Four- 
Hand Reel. 
THE DANCE 
Introduction. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) The dancers stand still while the 
first strain of the music (A) is played as an 
Introduction. 
I. OPENING 
Lead Round. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) A. (Meas. 1-8.) The two 
couples Lead Round to the right and then to 
the left in the usual manner, finishing in original 
positions. ' 
; II. BODY 
Side Step. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) The men Side Step (“Seven” 
and “Two Threes’’), each to his own right, and 
at the same time the women Side Step, each 
to her own left. (In doing this, the men pass 
behind their partners.) Partners are now in 
exchanged places. 
(Meas. 13-16.) All Side Step in the opposite 
direction, thus returning to original positions. 
This time the men pass in front of their partners. 
65 Swing and Pass Through. 
B. (Meas. 9-16.) Partners face each other, join 
crossed hands and swing half around with 
Promenade Steps, the two couples moving 
toward each other as they do so. (This brings 
each woman on the left of her partner.) Re- 
leasing hands, the two couples continue forward 
and pass each other, each woman passing be- 
tween the opposite couple. (That is, as the 
two couples pass each other they are four in a 
line, with the two men on the opposite ends 
and the two women left shoulder to left shoulder, 
as shown in Diagram 1.) Immediately after G08 DiacraM 1 
passing through, partners join crossed hands 
again and swing once around, moving on to the 
opposite side as they do so, and the two couples

GALWAY REEL 
(Reel for One Man and Two Women) 
The Galway Reel is different from all the other 
dances in this collection. It is neither a Square 
nor a Round Dance and is done by three people only 
—one man with two partners. 
The music for it is “The Galway Reel” which 
consists of two strains of eight measures éach, A and 
B, neither of which is repeated. THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step, “Seven” and “Two Threes.” 
FORMATION 
The three dancers stand side by side, the man 
between the two women, all facing in the same 
direction with hands joined in row, as shown in

(Long Dance in Reel Time for any Even Number of Couples) 
This is a long dance of the same type as the Walls 
of Limerick. 
The music given here for it is “Salamanca Reel,” 
which has the usual two parts of eight measures each 
(A and B), each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade FORMATION 
Any even number of couples form a column of 
‘couples with the odd couples facing down and the 
even couples facing up the set, so that each odd 
couple and the even couple below them are facing 
each other. This is the same formation as for the 
Walls of Limerick (see Diagram 1 on page 117). 
As in the case of the Walls of Limerick the dance 
is performed simultaneously by each set of two 
Step and the Side Step (“Seven” and ‘‘Two couples, exactly as described below for the first set 
Threes”’). (Couples One and Two).

so that the two couples are back to back and, 
joining inside hands, advance to original posi- 
tions where they release hands.

RINNCE AN BOITRIN 
THE BOHREEN DANCE 
(Long Dance in Single Jig Time for any Number of couples) 
Bohreen means a little road or lane. This dance 
is apparently the one which is known by some as the 
Rinnce Fada Roinnce, as they are almost identical in 
construction. 
The music suggested here for it is ““Smash the 
Windows.”’ It consists of the usual two parts of 
eight measures each (A and B), each of which is 
repeated. 
THE DANCE 
Introduction. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) All stand still in formation 
while eight measures of the music (A) are played 
as an Introduction. 
Down the Lane. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) While all the others stand still, 
Couple One, with Promenade Steps, advance 
down the set, the woman passing down between 
the two lines, while her partner goes down the 
outside, back of the men’s line, keeping abreast 
of her. (Diagram 1.)

81 THE STEPS 
The Promenade Step only is used throughout the 
dance. 
FORMATION 
Any number of couples form two parallel lines, 
facing each other, the women in one line and their 
partners opposite them in the other. This is the 
same formation as for the Rinnce Fada (Kerry 
Dance) page 109.

A. (Meas. 1-8.) Couple One go down the lane 
and back again in the same manner except that 
this time the man passes down and back 
between the two lines while his partner goes 
down and back on the outside back of the 
women’s line. They finish in original positions. 
Down the Centre Together. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) Couple One face down the set, 
join inside hands and advance together down 
between the lines. At the finish they release 
hands and face about 
(Meas. 13-16.) Joining inside hands again, 
Couple One return up the centre and fall back 
into original positions at the head of the set. 
Cross Over, Pass Around and Come Up. 
'B. (Meas. 9-16.) Couple One advance toward each 
other, take right hands and pass on to each 
others’ places. Without stopping, they release 
hands and the man passes around behind the 
woman of Couple Two, while his partner passes 
around behind the man of Couple Two. They 
meet in the centre, face up toward the head of

Go Down, Pass Around and Cross Over. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) Couple One release hands, face 
about, and, joining inside hands, retrace their 
steps down the set between Couple Two. They 
release hands, and separate, the man passing 
around behind the woman of Couple Two, and 
returning to his partner’s original position; 
while the woman passes around behind the man 
of Couple Two and returns to her partner’s 
original position. Without any pause in the 
movement, and without taking hands, the man 
and woman of Couple One cross over to their 
original positions (Diagram 3), passing each 
other to the right.

THE BRIDGE OF ATHLONE 
(Long Dance in Reel Time for any Even Number of Couples) 
This dance contains a figure representing the 
- Bridge of Athlone, whence its name is derived. 
The music given here for it is “The Rakes of 
Mallow,” which consists of the usual two parts, 
each of which is repeated. Any other good reel 
will do as well. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade , Step and the Side Step (“Seven” and ‘‘Two 
Threes’’). 
FORMATION 
An even number of couples form two parallel lines 
facing each other, with the women in one line, the 
left as seen from the front, and their partners oppo- 
site them in the other. 
This formation is exactly the same as for the 
Waves of Tory. (See Illustration on page 121.)

A. (Meas. 1-8.) All stand still while eight 
measures of the music are played as an In- 
troduction.

The Bridge. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) When Couple One meet at the 
foot of the set, they join both hands and raise 
them high, forming an arch. Couple Two when 
they meet at the foot join both hands, pass 
through Couple One’s arch and with Prome- 
nade Steps return up the centre to the head of 
the set, followed by all the other couples in 
order. 
This brings all couples back into original 
formation except that Couple One are now at 
the foot and Couple Two are at the head of the 
  “Bridge,” and the man going up the outside. 
(Diagram 4.)

B. (Meas. 9-16.) When Couple One reach the 
head, they return to the foot, the man this time 
passing down under the “Bridge,” and the

set, with all the others one place nearer the head 
than before. 
As they reach their places, partners all face 
each other, and with both hands joined, raise 
them high, thus forming a long Bridge. (See 
Illustration J.) 
. (Meas. 1-8.) Couple One release hands and 
with Promenade Steps dance forward to the 
head of the set, the woman passing under the woman going down the outside. On reaching 
the foot, they remain there and become the foot 
couple. 
The whole dance is now repeated (with the 
Introduction omitted) and continued in this 
manner as long as desired so that each couple in 
turn reach the head of the set and dance as 
described for Couple One. When all reach 
their original positions, the dance is generally 
concluded.

F] 
(Long Dance in Double Jig Time for any Even Number of Couples) 
This is a delightfully simple and easy dance which 
lends itself well to social use. 
The music given here for it is “The Top of Cork 
Road” (otherwise known as “Father O’Flynn”’), 
which consists of two parts of eight measures each 
(A and B), which are repeated. 
“The Donegal Jig,” composed by Mr. Arthur 
Darley (see page 126), is also particularly appropriate 
for this dance. It is in three parts (Nos. 1, 2 and 3), 
‘each of which consists of four strains. The music 
should be played through exactly as written, observ- 
ing all repeats. THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step and the Rising Step (the ‘Rise and Grind’’), 
which is described on page 6. 
FORMATION 
Any even number of couples form in two lines, 
with partners opposite each other. (Diagram 1.)

Round with the even couple next below and 
the two couples finish in exchanged position 
as shown in Diagram 7 in the Antrim Reel. 
All the odd couples in this way move one place 
lower in the set, while the even couples move one 
place higher. Omitting the Introduction, the 
dance is now repeated as before, except that the top and bottom couples stand idle while the 
others dances as described above. 
The dance is continued as long as desired in 
this manner, with each couple progressing up, 
or down, the set, as the case may be. When a 
couple reach the head or foot of the set, 
partners exchange places with each other and 
stand idle during one repetition of the dance; 
after which they begin dancing again and pro- 
gress in the opposite direction.

FOX HUNTER’S JIG 
(Long Dance in Hop Jig Tiine for any Even Number of Couples) 
The Fox Hunters’ Jig (always danced to the tune 
of the same name) is the only dance in the present 
collection which is in Hop Jig time. The dance is of 
the Kerry Dance (Rinnce Fada) type. 
The music, “Fox Hunters’ Jig,” which is given 
here is an old Hop Jig in 9/8 time. It consists of 
four parts of four measures each (A, B, C and D). 
A and B are repeated, and C and D are not repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in this dance are different from 
the regular jig and reel steps used in all the other 
dances in this collection. They are the Hop Jig 
Advance Step and the Hop Jig Side Step. For con- 
venience, these are described here in detail as 
follows: 
In fitting the steps to the music the first three 
measures should each be counted “One, Two, Three- 
Four,” while the fourth measure should be counted 
“One, Two, Three, Four, Five.” 
1. Hop Jig Advance Step (used throughout in 
place of the customary Promenade Step): 
(Meas. 1.) Raise the right foot and at the 
same time hop on the left foot (one); put down 
the right foot and at the same time lift the left 
foot (to); put down the left foot and lift the 
right (three); put down the right foot and lift 
the left (four). 
(Meas. 2.) Repeat the same step, beginning 
with a hop on the right foot. 
(Meas. 3.) 
(Meas. 4.) Put down the left foot and at the 
same time lift the right foot (one); put down the 
right foot and lift the left (#0); put down the 
left foot and lift the right (three); put down the 
right foot and lift the left (fowr); put down the 
left foot and lift the right (jive). Repeat the same as in (Meas. 1). 
93 2. Hop Jig Side Step (used throughout in place 
of the customary Side Step): 
(Meas. 1.) Raise the right foot and put it 
down on the ground about twelve inches to the 
right (one); put the left foot down behind the 
right with the toe behind and close to the right 
heel and at the same time lift the right foot 
(two); put down the right foot on the same spot 
from which it was raised and lift the left foot 
(three); put down the left foot on the same 
spot and lift the right foot (four). 
(Meas. 2.) 
(Meas. 3.) Repeat the same as in (Meas. 1). 
Repeat the same as before. 
(Meas. 4.) The following is executed in place 
with the left toe behind and close to the right 
heel: Put down the right foot and lift the left 
(one); put down the left foot and lift the right 
(two); put down the right foot and lift the left 
(three); put down the left foot and lift the 
right (four); put down the right foot and lift 
the left (five). 
(Meas. 1-4.) The same step (reversed) is now 
danced to the left, so that the dancer returns to 
his starting position and finishes with the right 
foot off the ground. 
FORMATION 
Any even number of couples form two parallel lines 
facing each other with the men in one line and the

women in the other. Partners are opposite each 
other. (See Diagrami.) This is the same forma- 
tion as for the Rinnce Fada and the Waves of Tory.

Wife.” It consists of the usual two parts of eight 
measures each (A and B), each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade

finish by exchanging places with each other, 
that is, each dancer finishes in the line opposite 
to the one in which he or she started the dance, 
as shown in Diagram 7.

The dance (with the Introduction omitted) is 
now repeated as before except that this time 
Couple Two stand idle at the head and Couple 
Five at the foot of the set while the Ring, Wheel 
and Swing Round are danced by Couple One 
with Couple Four and Couple Three with 
Couple Six. (Diagram 8.)

The dance is continued in this manner as long 
as desired, with each couple progressing one 
place lower or higher in the set (as the case may 
be) at each repetition. Whenever a couple 
reach the head or foot of the set they stand idle 
during one repetition of the dance. 
When all couples reach their original positions 
again the dance is usually concluded.

PORT AN FOGHMAIR 
HARVEST TIME JIG 
(Long Dance in Double Jig Time for any Even 
This is a dance from the west of Ireland which 
is unusual in that it calls for only half as many men 
as women. It _seems_quite-possible.that_its origin 
may have been suggested by a scarcity of men 
during harvest time, for at this time hundreds of 
harvesters leave home and seek work in other 
‘Tocalities where employment is plentiful, returning 
home when the season is over. 
The music given here for it is “Garryowen,” which 
consists of the usual two parts of eight measures 
each, A and B, each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step, the Side Step and the Rising Step (“Rise and 
Grind”). Number of men and Twice as Many Women) 
FORMATION 
The dancers form a column of threes. Each three, 
consisting of a man and two women, stand side by 
side, facing in the same direction with the man in 
the middle. The odd threes face down and the 
qtr [5 
DiacraM 1 ©» 
even threes face up the set so that each three is 
face to face with another three (Diagram 1) 
forming a set of two threes. All sets dance simul- 
taneously as described below for the First and Second 
Threes.

three progressing one place higher or lower (as 
the case may be) at each repetition of the dance. 
When three reach the head or foot of the column, 
they face about and stand idle during one 
repetition of the dance. The dance is con- 
tinued in this way as long as desired.

HASTE TO THE WEDDING 
(Long Dance in Double Jig Time for any Number of Couples) 
The beginning of this dance is exactly similar in 
every detail to the Rinnce Fada (Kerry Dance) up 
to the completion of the Left Wheel. From that 
point on, however, it is quite different in character. 
The music for the dance is the old tune of the same 
name. It is in two parts of eight measures each 
(A and B), each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Rising Step 
(“Rise and Grind”), the Promenade Step and the Side Step, also the “Seven” and ‘Two Threes” 
separately. 
FORMATION 
Any number of couples form two parallel lines, 
lengthways of the room, facing each other, the 
women in one line (the left as seen from the front) 
and their partners opposite them in the other. 
There should be at least six couples to form the set. 
Contrary to ordinary custom, the Leading Couples 
in this dance are those with the even numbers 
instead of the odd numbers. This should be borne 
in mind when the expression “Leading Couples” is 
used. 
THE DANCE 
Introduction. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) All stand still while the first 
strain of the music (A) is played as an In- 
troduction. 
Balance. 
A. (Meas. 1-2.) The man of Couple One and the 
woman of Couple Two face each other, while 
the woman of Couple One and the man of 
Couple Two do the same. All the other 
dancers in the set face each other in fours in the 
same manner. (See Diagram 1 of the Rinnce 
Fada on page 109.) In this position, all 
dance the Rising Step (“Rise and Grind’’), 
beginning with the right foot. 
(Meas. 3-4.) All dance the Rising Step, 
beginning with the left foot. 
Right Wheel. 
(Meas. 5-8.) Each four form a Right Wheel 
by joining right hands across the centre and (See dance around with Promenade Steps. 
Diagram 6 of the Gates of Derry.) 
Balance. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) All release hands and, facing as 
at the beginning of the dance, dance two Rising 
Steps as before, except that this time they begin 
with the left foot. 
Left Wheel. 
(Meas. 5-8.) Each four form a Left Wheel 
by joining left hands across the centre and 
dance around to the right with Promenade 
Steps. At the finish of this they release hands 
and fall back into original positions. 
Up the Centre and Back. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) While the Odd Couples stand 
still in their places the Even Couples (who in this 
particular dance are the Leading Couples) join 
crossed hands and Side Step up the centre,

(Meas. 11-12.) Each Leading Couple now 
dance “Two Threes” in place and raise their 
joined hands to form an arch. At the same 
time the Odd Woman, instead of dancing “Two 
Threes,” passes under the arch with Promenade 
Steps (Diagram 3), releasing her hands as 
she goes, and returns to her original position, 
where she remains.

just danced) and dance “Seven” as before, ex- 
cept that this time they go around to the left. 
(Meas. 15-16.) While each Leading Couple 
dance ‘““Two Threes” the Odd Man passes 
through the arch as described above for the 
woman and returns to his original position. 
All the dancers are now in their original 
positions.

This completes the sequence of movements. 
The dance (with the Introduction omitted) is 
now repeated from the beginning in the same 
manner except that Couple Two (who are now 
at the head) and Couple Five (who are at the 
foot of the set) stand idle while the others go 
through the dance. 
(Couples Four and Six only go up the centre 
and back.)

The next time the dance is repeated all couples 
are in action again as at the beginning of the 
dance except that now Couple Two become 
Non-Leaders while Couple Five become one of 
the Leading Couples. (Diagram 6.) 
° oS q.2 a 
(0 DiacraM 6 
The dance is continued in this manner, with 
the Leading Couples always executing the “Up 
the Centre and Back,” and progressing one 
place higher in the set at each repetition, while 
the Non-Leading Couples progress one place 
lower each time. 
Whenever a Leading Couple reach the head of 
the set they stand idle during one repetition of 
the dance, then become Non-Leaders and dance 
accordingly. 
Whenever a Non-Leading Couple reach the 
foot of the set they become Leaders and dance 
as described above for the Leading Couples. 
The dance is usually concluded when there have 
been a sufficient number of repetitions of the 
dance to bring all the couples back to their 
original positions.

The dance is continued in this manner with the 
Leading Couples moving one place lower and 
the Non-Leaders one place higher in the set at 
each repetition. Whenever a couple reaches the head of the set 
they often stand idle during one repetition of 
the dance when they become a Leading Couple 
and dance as described above for Couple One. 
Whenever a Leading Couple reach the foot of 
the set they stand idle during one repetition of 
the dance. They then become Non-Leaders 
and dance as described for Couple Two. 
The dance is usually concluded when there 
have been a sufficient humber of repetitions of 
the dance to bring Couple One back to the head 
of the set.

IOMSHUIDHE NA HINSE 
THE SIEGE OF ENNIS 
(Long Dance in Reel Time for any Number of Couples Divisible by Four) 
This is one of the easiest of the Long Dances. 
The music given for it here is “The White Cock- 
ade,” but it can be done equally well to any good reel 
or series of reels for variety. 
The music is in two parts of eight measures each 
(A and B), each of which is repeated. 
THE STEPS 
The steps used in the dance are the Promenade 
Step and the Side Step (“Seven” and “Two 
Threes”’). 
FORMATION 
Four Couples form two lines as follows: Couple 
One and Couple Two stand side by side with hands 
joined in a row, while Couple Three and Couple 
Four form a similar row facing them. If a large number of couples are taking part, they form similar 
sets of four couples each and arrange themselves in a

THE DANCE 
Introduction. 
A. (Meas. 1-8.) All stand still while eight meas- 
ures of the music are played as an Introduction 
Advance and Retire. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) In each set of four couples the 
two rows advance toward each other and retire 
with Promenade Steps in the usual manner. 
(Meas. 5-8.) All Advance and Retire again. 
Side Step. 
A. (Meas. 1-4.) With the Side Step (“Seven” 
and “Two Threes), the two couples in each row 
exchange places. In doing this, Couple One 
pass behind Couple Three, while Couple Four 
113 pass behind Couple Two. The corresponding 
couples in all the other sets dance in the same 
manner at the same time. (Diagram 2.) 
Baie ig, 
DiacraM 2 
(Meas. 5-8.) With the Side Step in the oppo- 
site direction, all couples return to their original 
places in the same manner, except that this time 
“Couple Three pass behind Couple One and 
Couple Two pass behind Couple Four. (The 
corresponding couples in all the other sets dance 
in the same manner at the same time.)

Right and Left Wheels. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) In each set the four dancers 
nearest the centre form a Right Wheel, while 
the two dancers at either end of the set join 
right hands, and all dance around to the left 
with Promenade Steps. (Diagram 3.) 
Oe a & DiacraM 3 
(Meas. 13-16.) All release hands, face the other 
way, join left hands and dance around in the 
opposite direction, finishing in original positions. 
Advance and Retire. 
B. (Meas. 9-12.) In each set the two lines Ad- 
vance and Retire as at the beginning of the 
dance. 
Pass Through. 
(Meas. 13-16.) With Promenade Steps, the 
two lines in each set advance toward each other 
and pass through, that is, the two lines exchange 
places. In doing this, Couple One and Couple 
Three each make an arch by raising their 
joined hands, while Couple Two pass through 
Couple One’s arch and Couple Four pass 
through Couple Three’s arch. 
If there is only one set of four couples dancing, 
each couple after passing through turn around 
so as to face the other line again with the 
woman on the right of her partner. The dance (with the Introduction omitted) is then re- 
peated in the same manner, except that Couple 
Two and Couple Four dance as described for 
Couple One and Couple Three and vice versa. 
If there is a column of sets dancing, each line, 
after passing through, remain back to back 
with the line they have just danced with, and 
find themselves facing a new line, with whom 
they now repeat the dance. (Diagram 4.)

DiacraM 4   
At each repetition of the dance each line 
travels one place farther down or up the set as 
the case may be. When a line reaches the top, 
or bottom, the two couples turn around (each 
woman keeping on the right of her partner) and 
thereafter travel in the other direction. After 
reaching the end and facing about in this way, 
the odd couples now become even, and vice 
versa, and dance as described for the odd and 
even numbers.

  PREFACE 
Tus little book has grown out of the author’s 
interest in economics, his conviction that igno- 
rance of its elementary principles is at the bot- 
tom of much of the faulty legislation and adminis- 
tration in our country, and finally, out of his own 
experience in teaching the subject to secondary- 
school pupils. To test his own beliefs on the mat- 
ter he has read widely on the subject and made 
extensive inquiries, with the result that his own 
convictions, based on experience, have been con- 
firmed. In 1912 he sent out a questionnaire to 
secondary-school teachers of economics in all 
parts of the country and received seventy-five 
replies, which furnished him with a large amount 
of information which has been of use in the prep- 
aration of this study. The author desires to take 
this opportunity to thank his correspondents, 
among whom are many of the leading teachers 
of economics in the secondary schools, for the 
invaluable help they have given him in the in- 
vestigation of his topic. The questionnaire was

In 1899, Professor Frederick R. Clow, of the 
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Normal School, published, 
in the Economic Studies of the American Eco- 
nomic Association, a very valuable monograph on 
“Economics as a School Study,” which traversed 
very much of the same ground covered by this 
essay. The present monograph is, however, an 
independent piece of work. On every point cov- 
ered in the essay the author has sought all avail- 
able material, much of which was not in existence 
when Professor Clow wrote, and has reached a 
conclusion which is entirely his own. In some 
cases his conclusions differ from those of the mono- 
graph’ in question. Only in a few minor ways is 
the present work different from what it would 
have been had Professor Clow’s essay never 
been published. 
It is the hope of the writer that this study 
will have some influence in hastening the spread 
of the study of economics, which is in any event 
sure to come. At the same time he hopes that it

the secondary schools, especially to the inexpe- 
rienced and those with but a limited knowledge 
of the subject, to whom the great privilege of 
teaching it may come.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue American citizen needs information on eco- 
nomic subjects. Every day, as a maker of public 
opinion, he is called upon to lend the weight of 
his personal judgment to one or another side of a 
controversy which at bottom rests on economic 
fact and law. Less often, but with more deci- 
sive influence, he is asked to go to the polls and 
solve problems of political and social welfare which 
involve some interference with the means of pro- 
ducing, exchanging, and distributing wealth. 
In the face of such a persistent need for eco- 
nomic intelligence, men and women must be edu- 
cated into familiarity with the fundamental laws 
and essential facts of economic science. The col- 
leges have trained a few people, for the study of 
economic problems is a well-established univer- 
sity study. But we cannot be content with this 
slight diffusion of knowledge. Discerning leaders 
in political economy are less than half efficient 
when the majority of men are undiscerning. The 
level of constructive leadership is largely estab- 
lished by the levels of popular understanding.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
The elements of economics must be taught in 
some form in both high and elementary schools. 
It is useless to urge that economics is a univer- 
sity subject and not a high-school study. Such a 
statement is not an argument against the teaching 
of economics in the lower schools; it is merely an 
expression of the present educational status of the 
science. It is this status which we must change. 
The fact is that all men imply or assume eco- 
nomic knowledge when they participate in present- 
day affairs. What they get is usually obtained in 
a haphazard way, — from newspapers, maga- 
zines, and conversation. It would be ridiculous 
to assume that the schools can do no better by 
the average man than these incidental agencies 
of economic teaching. The high school cannot 
do as well as the college, and the elementary 
school cannot hope to approximate the service 
of the high school; but each can do more for its 
clientage than it now does. It is all a matter of 
making schoolmasters feel with sufficient force 
the urgency of the task; when this is accomplished, 
well-trained teachers, the proper selection of 
topics, and effective modes of teaching will follow 
in due course. If doing something to give men eco- 
nomic intelligence is felt to be worth while, we 
shall get whatever experimentation is necessary 
x

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
to indicate the causes of failure and to suggest 
the ways and means that will bring success. 
In the course of any such enthusiastic experi- 
mentation it will soon be made clear to us that 
high-school students are not interested in the 
same range of problems, the same minute details, 
or the same wide generalizations as are univer- 
sity students. They require a different selection 
of topics. The interests of high-school students 
are determined by the psychological facts of 
adolescence and the special contacts with the out- 
side world usual to youth. Problems belonging 
more or less exclusively to business and finance 
will therefore not appeal to them at first. 
The high-school students will be interested in 
problems of social welfare. They will be eager to 
understand the issues of current political debate. 
In so far as these call for a knowledge of economic 
fact and law they are strategic opportunities for 
economic teaching, and can be made the points 
of entrance into investigations of economic fact. 
Thus topics for economic study in the high school 
are more likely to represent units of human in- 
terest than abstract economic concepts. The 
more abstruse economic notions, relations, and 
generalizations will come to them indirectly, 
as certain concrete and tangible economic facts

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
are directly pursued. Even the latter will be more 
effectively acquired and organized for the lay- 
man’s uses if they are acquired as the means to 
interesting practical ends. 
Making knowledge practical merely involves 
making knowledge personal. The best way to 
head the high-school youth toward the economic 
interpretation of social and political life is to be- 
gin with the economic interpretation of his own 
life, just where the instructor finds it. Whatever 
aspects of his own experience afford illustrations 
for economic fact should be utilized from the 
start. But his life is lived with more than his 
own young kind. Group life with his fellows. 
may be central to him; but his life has expand- 
ing margins which more and more touch the 
institutional life of adults. What his own so- 
cial class or immediate neighborhood is discuss- 
ing will be of some concern to him. What is 
mentioned in daily newspaper and weekly maga- 
zine will widen the teacher’s chance to vitalize 
economic teaching. Thus the teaching of eco- 
nomics in the high school will aim more at con- 
trolling the child’s belief with fact than at making 
him memorize a text of abstractions. 
It is obvious that before economics can be 
transmuted into a high-school subject, we must 
xii

have better-trained teachers, specially devised 
texts, and a method of approach which will make 
the high-school student feel that he is studying 
realities. How these and other less important 
pedagogical ends are to be attained more fully 
is told in the volume here presented.

THE NEED OF ECONOMIC KNOWLEDGE 
What the science of economics is 
Economics is among the most important of sub- 
jects. Its nature is, however, often misunder- 
stood even among educators. It is the science 
which deals with the social system of wealth, or, in 
other words, it is the science which explains those 
social phenomena which are due to the wealth- 
getting and wealth-using activities of man. The 
economist has to do with valuable things or goods 
in their relation to the individual and to society 
as a whole. He inquires into human wants and 
the means of satisfying these wants so far as this 
can be done by concrete goods or the hired serv- 
ices of one’s fellows. He answers the questions 
how society produces goods, how these goods are 
divided among the different classes of producers, 
and how the use of the goods reacts upon individ- 
I
-P-A-G-E-16
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
uals and the social organism. He looks at every- 
thing from the social viewpoint and discovers 
what is for the general welfare on the material 
side. He makes a scientific explanation of the 
phenomena of the industrial world. As human 
beings put forth the greatest part of their activi- - 
ties in industrial pursuits, —'that is, in getting a 
living, — it is evident that economics deals with 
one of the major aspects of human life. How im- 
portant it is that the elementary principles which 
govern economic activities in modern society 
be understood will appear as our discussion ad- 
vances. 
The value of economics for intelligent citizenship 
in the twentieth century 
James Bryce has shown, in the American 
Commonwealth, that the dominating force in the 
American government is public opinion. Practi- 
cally all the great questions which public opinion 
is called upon to settle fall within the domain of 
economics or political science. It is therefore es- 
sential, in order that one should be a good citi- 
zen, that he should be intelligent upon these 
questions. This, of course, is not the only thing 
which is necessary to good citizenship, but it 
would take us too far afield to discuss all its ele- 
2
-P-A-G-E-17
  ‘SECONDARY SCHOOL 
ments. The point here is simply that intelligence 
— not merely “general intelligence,” but specific 
intelligence on public questions —is an essen- 
tial. 
There is special need of such intelligence in our 
country in the years which are directly before us. 
Up to the present time, even in our country, the 
government has been in the hands, to a large 
extent, of a ruling class. We are now, however, 
in the midst of a great movement toward mak- 
ing our institutions extremely democratic. For 
good or ill, the initiative and referendum are 
destined to play a great part in the decision of 
our most perplexing questions. Whether any na- 
tional form of direct legislation will be evolved we 
cannot now tell, but while our Federal Constitu- 
tion remains essentially as it now is, the States 
will continue to deal in their legislation with by 
far the more numerous, if not the more impor- 
tant, questions. On these questions the voter will 
have to declare himself affirmatively or negatively 
with great frequency. In this country public ques- 
tions are not left to savants to settle. In the State 
of Missouri, for instance, there was submitted 
to the voters in 1912 a constitutional amendment 
with reference to taxation, the intelligent deci- 
sion of which involved an understanding of eco- 
3
-P-A-G-E-18
ECONOMICS IN THE 
nomic rent and something of the incidence of taxa- 
tion. In speaking of the educational value of 
civics (simplified political science), Ruediger well 
says, “The primary value of civics is the socially 
practical value. Intelligent citizenship depends 
upon it quite as much as upon history. When 
rightly taught, it should lead to intelligent voting 
and the upright discharge of all social-political 
duties.” What is true of civics is true in greater 
degree of economics. In the first place, the 
principles of economics are far less well known 
among the intelligent public than the main facts 
about our government, and are far more difficult 
to pick up from miscellaneous reading. Says 
Professor Macvane, ‘‘ The motions of the earth 
and its true relations to the heavenly bodies are 
not more effectually disguised to the careless ob- 
server than are the real facts of economic life.” 
Economic fallacies and misconceptions are com- 
mon in the minds of otherwise intelligent people. 
For example, the opinion that foreign nations can- 
not honestly be in favor of any trade with us that 
is not to our disadvantage is tacitly held by mul- 
titudes and makes its appearance even in the 
speeches of alleged statesmen and in official docu- 
ments. Much false knowledge is constantly dis- 
seminated by political orators and the press.

SECONDARY SCHOOL 
People think themselves competent to reason 
about economic problems, however complex, with- 
out any preparatory training. The general tend- 
ency of popular economics is toward rash gener- 
alizations. The fallacy of post hoc ergo propter 
hoc is the typical popular formula of argument. 
Again, the burning questions of our day are 
economic. We have practically reached the end 
of our supply of free land, which has hitherto 
furnished an outlet for those who wished to better 
their condition. We have come upon an era of 
rising cost of living. Discontent is rife among the 
more poorly paid workers. There is, therefore, 
great danger that in our discontent we shall fly 
in the face of economic law and do great damage 
to the social organism. Economics is at once an 
antidote to the resistance by interested classes to 
beneficent reforms and to the ideas of visionaries 
who are always making chimerical proposals. 
We are confronted with questions relating to 
the tariff, the cost of living, the trusts, various 
proposals for changing national and state taxa- 
tion, transportation, banking, currency, conser- 
vation, the merchant marine, child labor, occupa- 
tional diseases, the minimum wage, the eight-hour 
day, immigration, and a multitude of other and 
subsidiary economic problems. In the words 
S)
-P-A-G-E-20
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
of Dr. Burch, “Just as the world has passed 
through its struggles for intellectual, religious, 
and political freedom, so it is now on the threshold 
of the great struggle for economic freedom and 
social justice.” This is well illustrated by the plat- 
forms of the great parties adopted in 1912. All 
of the economic questions enumerated above, and 
others, are discussed in one or more of these plat- 
forms and the majority are discussed in all of 
them. If we omit the parts which appeal to the 
record of the parties, or denounce other parties, 
we shall find that more than half of what is left 
of the Democratic and Republican platforms 
deals with questions of a distinctly economic 
nature, while the platform of the new Progressive 
party devotes more than two thirds of its space 
to the same sort of problems. The legislative 
mills of 1913 ground out a grist of laws that have 
an economic side which is without parallel. The 
purpose of this legislation is almost without ex- 
ception good, but there has been voiced an em- 
phatic protest against the unwisdom of much of it 
by some of the nation’s wisest leaders in reform, 
who can by no means be classed as conservatives. 
Economics, then, even more than civics, is needed 
by every voter or prospective voter as a part of 
his equipment. No person without a considerable 
6
-P-A-G-E-21
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
knowledge of economic principles and some train- 
ing in economic reasoning can form an opinion 
of any value on many of the subjects which are 
at issue to-day. We are safe in saying that a good 
knowledge of economics is among the best assets 
one can have who wishes to use his vote for the 
public good. Besides helping the voter to form 
an opinion on questions at issue, it will be a great 
help to him in recognizing intelligent leadership 
and will incline him to follow such leadership. 
Men of affairs with a secondary-school training 
in economics will be more likely than others to 
give ear to the expert in the subject. 
The ethical value of economics 
Besides its contribution to the intelligence of 
the citizen, economics has a decided value for his 
ethical training. It inculcates self-help, it teaches 
economy in expenditure, a lesson sorely needed 
by the average American. The value of industry 
and trustworthiness receives emphasis through 
economic study. Like other social sciences, it 
constantly inquires what is for the good of all. 
It shows that the interests of humanity are one. 
It takes a social point of view, and one who has 
become habituated to taking this view has made 
a great step toward understanding what right 
7
-P-A-G-E-22
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
conduct is in any given case. It naturally leads 
to public spirit, putting the good of the whole 
before purely selfish ends, and this is the essence 
of the purest patriotism. It teaches every man 
to estimate his labors by the tendency to promote 
the general good. Then a great many of the ques- 
tions of right and wrong which confront us daily 
have an economic side. It gives a proper esti- 
mate of the place of wealth and the right use of it. 
The individual is taught the effects which his own 
private acts have upon society. No one can be 
truly moral who does not consider the social re- 
sults of his deeds. Many an act in which people 
take pride appears in its true deleterious charac- 
ter in the light of economic science. For example, 
economics teaches men and women that extrava- 
gant expenditure cannot be excused on the plea 
that it gives employment to labor. It develops 
breadth of thought, it cultivates the power to 
judge fairly of many questions in everyday life. 
In the study of economics, many supposed facts 
will be found to be erroneous. In the future the 
student will be more careful. This tends to en- 
courage the love of truth. An insight into in- 
dustrial conditions broadens the sympathy for 
all sorts and conditions of men. It is certainly 
‘conducive to a love of justice and leads the stu- 
8
-P-A-G-E-23
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
dent to see something outside the economic class 
to which he belongs. 
The vocational value of economics 
There are also vocational values of economics. 
The business man learns in economics many facts 
which are of direct value in his vocation. As will 
appear later, it is in commercial schools and 
courses that economics is most frequently a re- 
quired subject. The journalist, even if he is only 
a reporter, finds it a constant help in his work. 
The need of such knowledge is painfully evident 
to an economist as he reads the newspapers. The 
clergyman needs economics for the light it throws 
upon many questions commonly discussed in the 
pulpit. The lawyer should have it for its bearing 
upon many of the economic-legal questions which 
are often arising. A greater knowledge of eco- 
nomics on the part of judges would have been of 
great value to the country in the last few years. 
All those who are called upon to administer pub- 
lic offices are in constant need of the guidance 
of economics. Those who devote themselves to 
charitable work need its light on their problems. 
The legislator, like the voter, but to a larger ex- 
tent, should be equipped with the power of eco- 
nomic reasoning. The capitalist needs it to guide 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
ECONOMICS IN THE SCHOOL 
him in his broad policies. The laborer needs it to 
give him the right conception of his relation to 
production, and laborers, as organized into unions, 
need it constantly as a guide in deciding the pol- 
icy of the organizations. The larger part of the 
failures of labor organizations can be traced to 
ignorance of economic laws. The contribution 
of economics to vocational education is, then, a 
large one. 
The cultural value of economics 
Just a word may be said about the cultural 
value of economics, or its value as enlarging the 
capacity for the enjoyment of life. Much of the 
satisfaction of life comes from “‘an understanding 
of all the elements of one’s environment that rest 
upon law and system.” To understand our trade 
relations or our monetary system is as truly a 
part of cultural education as to understand chem- 
istry or Latin. ‘Such knowledge puts one in touch 
and harmony with large and influential elements 
of modern life. To be ignorant of them compels 
one to just that extent to live as a stranger in a 
strange land.”
-P-A-G-E-25
  II 
THE SUITABILITY OF ECONOMICS AS A 
SECONDARY SCHOOL SUBJECT 
The secondary school furnishes the last chance to 
teach the subject to any considerable number of 
young people 
Since, then, the knowledge of economics is of 
such great importance that the topics of which 
it treats are “fundamental for intelligent and 
responsible citizenship,” to say nothing of its 
other values, it ought to have an honored place 
in the program of every secondary school sup- 
ported by the public funds unless it can be shown 
that it is unsuitable for pupils in this grade. It 
is the secondary school which furnishes the last 
chance for systematic education in any subject. 
It holds the strategic position and gives all the 
preparation which many persons have who after- 
ward come to important places of leadership in 
their own communities and often in much wider 
fields. 
The opinions of educational authorities 
The turning-point of the whole question is 
the claim made by some, though a decided minor- 
IZ 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
ECONOMICS IN THE 
ity of those who have really studied the question, 
that the subject is beyond the grasp of secondary- 
school pupils. This is not the opinion, however, 
of many of the leading educational experts. Pro- 
fessor Hanus says, ‘‘We justly expect a modern 
school to do its share in awakening interest in 
and insight into our institutional life. . . . Accord- 
ingly, we think that history, civics and econom- 
ics, the social studies, should receive much fuller 
recognition in secondary-school programs of 
study than has been accorded to them hitherto.”’ 
Nicholas Murray Butler says, “In society as it 
exists to-day, the dominant note running through- 
out our struggles and problems is economic. . . . 
Yet it is a constant struggle to get any proper 
teaching from the economic and social point of 
view put before high-school and college students. 
They are considered too young and immature 
to study such recondite subjects, though the nice 
distinctions between the Greek modes and tenses 
and the principles of conic sections with their 
appeal to the highly trained intellectual imagina- 
tion are their daily food.” In a recent article 
in the School Review, Commissioner Snedden 
of Massachusetts has advocated the introduc- 
tion of a two years’ course “‘constituted of suit- 
able units from civics, economics, ethics, and other 
12
-P-A-G-E-27
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
constituents of social science enriched with vital 
and pertinent contributions from history.” This 
indicates that he does not consider economics, 
properly treated, beyond the power of high-school 
pupils. The famous Committee of Ten, though 
they did not advocate economics as a separate 
study, distinctly said that its fundamental prin- 
ciples were not beyond the grasp of the sec- 
ondary-school pupil. The Committee of Five 
of the Department of Business Education of 
the National Educational Association in its model 
program included economics. Such leading col- 
lege professors of economics as Daggett, of the 
University of California, Laughlin, of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago, Clark, of Columbia, Taussig and 
Bullock, of Harvard, Patten, of the University 
of Pennsylvania, and Ely and Commons, of the 
University of Wisconsin, have written articles 
in which the teaching of the fundamental prin- 
ciples of economics below the college grade was 
advocated. 
The practice of leading schools 
Economics is taught in such schools as the 
New York High School of Commerce, the Boston 
High School of Commerce, and the Central High 
School of Philadelphia. Among other cities in 
13
-P-A-G-E-28
ECONOMICS IN THE 
which there are high schools having courses in 
economics are Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, 
Louisville, Los Angeles, Newark, New Orleans, 
Seattle, and Washington. Courses which are es- 
sentially courses in economics are found in such 
European schools of secondary grade as the Com- 
mercial Academy of Vienna, the Commercial 
Academy of Prague, the School of Higher Com- 
mercial Studies at Paris, and the Public Commer- 
cial Institute at Leipzig. 
The evidence of those who are teaching the subject 
The testimony of experience supports the au- 
thorities who have been quoted. One of the ques- 
tions in the questionnaire given in the preface was, 
“How does the teacher feel that the results ob- 
tained in the teaching of economics compare, in 
proportion to the time given to the subject, with 
the results obtained by him or her in other sub- 
jects (a) as to quality of classroom work and (d) 
as to the application to the pupil’s life out of 
school?” 
Among the teachers replying were those who 
also taught history, civics, ancient and modern 
languages, mathematics, science, and commer- 
cial subjects. There were sixty-three direct re- 
plies to the first part of the question; of these 
14
-P-A-G-E-29
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
eighteen reported better results, thirty-seven re- 
sults equally good, and only eight poorer results. 
To the second part there were fifty-five answers, 
twenty-four reporting better results, twenty- 
seven equally good results, and four poorer re- 
sults. Even if we count all failures to give a direct 
answer as equivalent to saying that the results 
were poorer, it still remains true that, in their 
own opinion, about two thirds of the teachers 
were getting results from economics, in both re- 
spects equal or superior to the results in other 
subjects. 
This is a very remarkable showing when we 
consider that only twenty of those replying con- 
sidered their preliminary preparation for teaching 
economics equal to their preparation for teach- 
ing their other subjects. The replies as a whole 
showed surprising enthusiasm for the subject 
and belief in its value. Several teachers referred 
to the testimony of their pupils to its value. One 
boy said, “I can understand and enjoy the 
heavier articles in magazines that I never would

other teacher wrote, ‘Some boys say, ‘It is the 
best subject I have ever taken except Commercial 
Law.’” When we consider that a course in eco- 
nomics is usually given only half as much time as 
15  
-P-A-G-E-30
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
a course in plane geometry, and often taught by 
a teacher with little or no special training, the 
answers are very encouraging. 
The evidence of examination results 
The reports of the New York state examina- 
tions for 1912 confirm our other evidence. In 
economics 27.3 per cent of the examinations 
were rated below 60 per cent. Of all the papers 
written by secondary-school pupils, 28.9 per cent 
were below the grade of 60 per cent. Some in- 
dividual subjects showed the following percent- 
ages of failures: American history and civics, 
25.6; ancient history (three periods), 30.4; 
elementary botany, 30.3; civics, 30.4; commercial 
law, 22.4; elementary drawing, 24; all English 
subjects, 19.5; English grammar, 38.1; commer- 
cial English and correspondence, 68; French, 
28.6; German, 30.1; history of commerce, 60.6; 
shorthand (2), 37.1; Latin, 36.1; physics, 25.7; 
plane geometry, 27.3; all mathematics, 34.9. 
The content of the course in economics on which 
the New York Regents’ examinations are based 
is large for the time allotment and the examina- 
tions are thorough and exacting. Similar sta- 
tistics from New Hampshire and North Dakota 
are of the same purport.

SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Economics as a college entrance subject 
The fact that economics is widely accepted as 
a college entrance subject is an evidence that it 
is considered by many higher institutions a proper 
study for the secondary school. The investiga- 
tions of Clarence D. Kingsley into the question of 
college requirements show that in 1912, out of two 
hundred and three colleges reported, fifty-seven 
allowed economics to count one or more units 
for admission to the A.B. course and thirty-five 
allowed it to count one half a unit. Of eighty- 
five engineering schools, fifty accepted the sub- 
ject for entrance; of thirty-one agricultural col- 
leges, twenty-four. Among the institutions which 
allow economics to count one or more units for 
admission to the A.B. course are Leland Stan- 
ford Jr. University, the University of Chicago, 
the University of Michigan, Syracuse University, 
and the University of Vermont. The study has 
been recently added to the options which may be 
offered at several institutions. 
The failure to permit economics as an entrance 
subject does not, however, indicate that the col- 
lege authorities disapprove of economics for those 
who are not to enter college. The recent omission 
of economics from the options permitted in 
17  
-P-A-G-E-32
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
the old method of admission to Harvard was 
prompted by the opinion that it is better for a 
pupil who is to pursue economic courses in col- 
lege to take his elementary course in college also. 
The professor who brought about the change is 
on record as approving the study of economics in 
the secondary school. 
What our evidence proves 
From all the evidence we may be entirely satis- 
fied that whenever the importance of economics 
receives recognition and there is as much insist- 
ence on having an adequate time allotment and 
qualified teachers as in mathematics, language, or 
science, the objection that the secondary-school 
pupils cannot master its fundamental principles 
will vanish. Of course a few weeks with the sub- 
ject will not make an accomplished economist, 
but it will come as near to it as the same number 
of weeks will to making an accomplished physi- 
cist or mathematician. 
Why not sociology instead of economics in the 
secondary schools ? 
The question might be asked, ‘‘Why not have 
sociology instead of economics in the secondary 
school?” It has been advocated by some, and 
18
-P-A-G-E-33
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
there are a few secondary schools in which courses 
are given with such texts as Dealey and Ellwood. 
Admitting that secondary-school pupils are ca- 
pable of doing profitable work in sociology, it is 
still true that economics has far more to give 
which bears directly upon the questions which 
public opinion is called upon to decide than does 
sociology. It also contains much more which 
has direct connection with the probable future 
vocations of the pupils. A cursory comparison 
of the tables of contents of an elementary book 
on sociology and a similar book on economics 
would be sufficient to show this. Moreover, 
sociology is still in a formative stage. The study 
of sociology should follow and not precede the 
much more definite subject of economics. There 
may ultimately be found in the secondary school 
a place for some of the principles of sociology, but, 
if so, they should come in addition to and not in 
place of economics.

III 
THE PRESENT STATUS OF ECONOMICS IN 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The extent to which it is now taught 
Tuerz is not sufficient evidence to enable one to 
give a definite statement as to what extent eco- 
nomics is now taught in the secondary schools of 
the United States. In 1912 the writer had access 
to the records of two publishing houses which 
covered all subjects taught in about eighteen hun- 
dred secondary schools. These records were made 
for business purposes and were entirely free from 
bias. There were, of course, many small schools 
and some good-sized ones which were not listed. 
About one fifth of the schools reporting had 
courses in economics. As to the proportion of the 
pupils who take economics in the schools where 
it is offered, information is also regrettably in- 
complete. The writer has statistics from sixty- 
three schools which in 1912 graduated about 
fifty-three hundred pupils in all courses, of whom 
thirty-six per cent had taken economics. Pro- 
fessor Stewart Daggett, of the University of Cali- 
20
-P-A-G-E-35
  ECONOMICS IN THE SCHOOL 
fornia, in 1912 sent out letters to the large high 
schools in all parts of the country. Of one hun- 
dred and thirty-three such schools, fifty-six 
taught the subject of economics. These figures 
appear much more favorable than those before 
cited, but it is to be remembered that his letters 
went to the larger schools only. 
The study of economics in the secondary schools is 
increasing 
In 1893 about one twentieth of the schools 
replying to the circular of the Committee of Ten 
reported courses in economics. The evidence 
already given shows a large increase since then. 
At present economics is usually found in commer- 
cial schools and in the commercial courses of 
large high schools, where it is often a required 
study. Of the fifty-four schools reporting the 
date of the introduction of the subject in answer 
to the writer’s questionnaire, twenty-four had in- 
troduced it within five years, and thirty-six within 
ten years. The state superintendents of Iowa, 
New Hampshire, and Ohio report a decided in- 
crease of late. From 1894 to 1910 the number of 
schools in Minnesota giving economics increased 
from twelve to forty-six. In New York there has 
been a decrease due to the increased severity of 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
the examinations, which are now rather hard, 
considering the time allotment. Formerly they 
were very easy. Wisconsin also reports some fall- 
ing-off, though forty-seven per cent of the schools 
reported still teach the subject. Professor Dag- 
gett reports that answers to his inquiries indi- 
cate that ‘not only is the teaching of economics 
common, but there is a marked belief that the 
demand for it will increase. .. . The conviction 
that the demand will increase is not confined to 
the schools which are giving economics.” The 
facts that economics is generally considered a 
proper study for the commercial course, and that 
this course is meeting with increasing favor in the 
entire country, point unmistakably to a large in- 
crease in the numbers of pupils taking the study. 
As its suitability to the secondary-school pupil 
is demonstrated by its success in the commercial 
course, its introduction into other courses will 
become easy. It is nevertheless true that on the 
whole the increase in the teaching of economics 
has been slower than it ought to have been. There 
are several reasons for this, one of which, the be- 
lief that the subject is beyond the ability of the 
secondary-school pupil, has been discussed at 
length in chapter 1. We shall now examine some 
of the other reasons. 
22
-P-A-G-E-37
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The belief that proper teachers cannot be had 
It has been argued that we should not have the 
subject in secondary schools because proper 
teachers cannot be had. It is true that the ideal 
teacher of the subject is a person of rare qualifica- 
tions. He should be a person with a good special 
preparation and of a judicial mind. Few schools 
have enough economics to take all the time of one 
teacher. However, economics is very largely 
studied in colleges. During the year 1909-10, no 
less than fifteen thousand students were begin- 
ning the subject in higher institutions. If edu- 
cational authorities would insist that every new 
teacher of history, or at least every head of a his- 
tory department, should possess an adequate 
training in economics as well as history and civics, 
the difficulty would pass away. In Iowa, which is 
the banner State in the teaching of economics, 
the subject is by law required for the first-grade 
certificate. The writer would not wait for an ade- 
quate supply of competent teachers, but would let 
the demand create the supply as has been done 
in practically all of the newer subjects. He would, 
however, insist on having the subject taught by 
a person interested in it,in order that it may 
not be discredited. Teachers should be encour- 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
ECONOMICS IN THE 
aged to study the subject in university extension 
courses, in summer schools, or, where these op- 
portunities are not open, by correspondence. 
The returns quoted above show that many teach- 
ers with comparatively small preparation feel 
that they are doing profitable work. 
The objection that economics deals with 
controverted questions 
Another objection is that economics deals 
with matters which are controverted questions 
and economists themselves differ on many points. 
In the first place there is a sufficient body of 
accepted doctrine for an elementary course. 
Many of the propositions of economics are as 
well established as any in geometry. When ques- 
tions which are political issues come up, they may 
be freed from the false popular arguments which 
are common and the real grounds for belief in 
each side presented. The teacher should maintain 
a position of absolute fairness on controverted 
questions. He should establish by example the 
habit of open-minded consideration of disputed 
questions. He should also make it plain that other 
than economic considerations may properly 
enter into the decision of many practical ques- 
tions. Economics does not furnish a set of rules 
24
-P-A-G-E-39
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
for the settlement of all social questions. He may 
raise the whole discussion above the ordinary 
level and leave the pupil to decide for himself. 
Professor Daggett well says, “I think that the 
boy and girl [he lives in California] who are to 
pass on economic questions as voters should be 
trained in economic reasoning by disinterested 
teachers before they are called upon to vote. . . . 
I want to see every voter accustomed to the analy- 
sis of economic problems and to the criticism of 
economic arguments before his decisions have to 
count.” 
The too scientific treatment of the subject 
It is probable that the teaching of economics 
in the secondary school has often failed on account 
of the too scientific treatment of the subject. It is 
a common fault of college-trained teachers to try 
to teach secondary-school subjects in the way 
in which their own professors taught the subjects 
to them. This is less likely to happen in studies 
which the teacher himself began in the secondary 
school than in studies which the teacher has taken 
only in college. Textbooks not adapted to the 
secondary-school pupil are in frequent use in 
classes in economics and it is surprising that such 
good results are often attained with these books. 
25 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
The teacher should be sure to select a textbook 
which is not too hard and in all the teaching to 
temember that he is not dealing with college 
students. 
The objection that proper textbooks do not exist 
The fact that economics is being successfully 
taught by a large number of teachers is in itself 
a refutation of this objection. In chapter v will 
be found a discussion of several textbooks in 
actual use. 
The objection that the curriculum is already 
overcrowded 
Again, it is said that the curriculum is already 
overcrowded. Without doubt this has been one 
of the chief reasons for the comparatively slow 
progress of economics in gaining a place in the 
secondary school. This raises the question of the 
relative educational value of the different sub- 
jects, a question which cannot be discussed here 
at length. If economics has the importance 
which the writer has tried to set forth, there are 
few subjects which ought to be allowed to take 
precedence of it. It may be suggested that the 
time allotment of some subjects could be cut down 
and others could be made optional where they 
26
-P-A-G-E-41
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
are now required. Many pupils, especially in the 
general courses, give a disproportionate amount 
of time to foreign language study for a well- 
rounded course. In many schools this study could 
be diminished with advantage. One foreign lan- 
guage is all that a pupil who is not fitting for a 
higher institution should study. Professor Man- 
chester, of the Illinois State Normal School, 
would give one fourth of the time in a secondary- 
school course to language and literature, one 
fourth to science and mathematics, one fourth to 
history, civics, commercial geography, and eco- 
nomics, and the other fourth to electives. In the 
best commercial schools and courses, time is al- 
ready found for economics as a required study. 
Economics is commonly and properly considered 
as belonging to the same group as history and 
civics. At the present time economics and civics 
are both treated as the poor relatives of the differ- 
ent blocks of history, whereas, by reason of their 
importance, they ought to be the most honored 
members of the group. The whole object of the 
teaching in this group of studies ought to be prep- 
aration for intelligent citizenship. History it- 
self should be taught to show how the present 
has grown out of the past. It is the present that 
is important. Commissioner Snedden, in the 
27
-P-A-G-E-42
ECONOMICS IN THE 
article already mentioned, questions whether 
history really functions socially. It certainly 
would be more likely to do so if taught with the 
conscious aim of citizenship and the course 
crowned by a thorough study of civics and eco- 
nomics. The writer, who has had about equal 
training in history and economics, but has taught 
chiefly history, believes a good course in either 
civics or economics of much greater practical 
social value than a course in any one of the his- 
torical fields commonly studied. He would not 
omit history, but he would unhesitatingly dimin- 
ish its amount if that is the only way to get time 
for civics and economics. There are various ways 
of compressing the secondary-school history 
course into three years and at the same time cov- 
ering practically the entire field. Where only a 
small amount of history is required for a diploma, 
there is really no difficulty about finding time for 
civics and economics, without interfering with 
the necessary history. In view of their impor- 
tance, these two studies should together be given 
at least five hours per week for a year. As they 
both deal with citizenship and overlap in many 
places, they should be closely correlated and the 
best method of securing this correlation is to have 
them both taught by the same person, naturally 
28
-P-A-G-E-43
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
the head of the department or the best teacher in 
the department. How the necessary time for civ- 
ics and economics may be found will receive 
further discussion in the next chapter. 
The proposed teaching of economics through some 
other subject or subjects 
In this connection may properly be considered 
the proposal, favored in the Report of the Com- 
mittee of Ten, that economics be taught through 
other subjects. They recommend that the essen- 
tial facts of economics be taught in connection 
with history, civics, and commercial geography, 
and that no separate course in economics be given. 
When they come to particulars, however, it ap- 
pears that the subject will really become a part 
of the course in American history. For example, 
the theory of value is to come with the study of 
the tariff; in connection with Jackson’s adminis- 
tration, crises, banks, money, paper currency, and 
bimetallism are to be taken up. The topics thus 
enumerated in various historical connections in- 
clude most of those which would be taken up in 
a secondary-school course. A trained teacher of 
economics could undoubtedly do the work in 
the way indicated if he were allowed to subor- 
dinate many things usually taught in history or 
29
-P-A-G-E-44
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
to have about twice the usual time allotment, 
but it is pretty sure that the trained economist 
would prefer to teach economics by itself and that 
the inexperienced teacher would get far inferior 
results to those which would be secured with the 
use of a good textbook. As Professor Manches- 
ter, of the Illinois State Normal School, shows, 
experience proves that when economics is left to 
be taught in this way it simply is not taught. It 
is safe to say that this proposal has never been 
carried out. Certainly no books have ever been 
written on this theory. The report of the Com- 
mittee of Five of the American Political Science 
Association on the teaching of civics in the sec- 
ondary school is significant in this connection. 
They take up the question of the teaching of 
civics, as is commonly done, in connection with 
American history and devote much space to its 
discussion, coming to the unanimous and em- 
phatic conclusion that the subject should be 
taught as a separate study. If civics requires a 
separate course to secure adequate treatment (as 
is doubtless true), it seems evident that econom- 
ics requires it more. 
Closely akin to the proposal to teach economics 
through American history is the proposal advo- 
cated by Professor F. H. Dixon, set forth in an 
30
-P-A-G-E-45
  SECONDARY SCHOOL ° 
article in the School Review for January, 1898, to 
teach economics through industrial history. He 
claims that the use of a textbook on economics 
has proved a failure. The writer of this paper 
believes the evidence he has already given dis- 
proves this, for practically all of those who an- 
swered his questionnaire based their work upon a 
textbook. Professor Dixon says that a textbook 
of convenient size for high-school use can contain 
nothing but the barest statement of definitions 
and principles, and, unless life is infused into these 
principles by the teacher, the work is without 
result. He also thinks that the pupil fails to get a 
due idea of the development of the present form 
of economic society. Now, textbooks do contain 
a considerable amount of illustrative material 
and the good teacher will supply more. If the 
pupil has had good historical courses he knows 
that the present grows out of the past, and be- 
sides, he can understand the present working of 
most economic laws without reference to history. 
For instance, it is not at all necessary for a pupil 
to wade through a history of land tenure in order 
to understand the law of diminishing returns or 
the law of rent. Though Professor Dixon believes 
that the secondary-school pupil cannot learn eco- 
nomics with a textbook as a basis, he does not 
3t

  ECONOMICS IN THE SCHOOL 
hesitate to recommend a great deal of reading in 
a long list of books of which Gross’s Gild Merchant 
and Fowle’s Poor Law are samples. We may 
safely, it seems, dismiss the idea that a pupil can 
somehow come to a real understanding of eco- 
nomic principles by taking them up piecemeal in 
connection with industrial or other history when 
he is unable to grasp them if presented with a 
textbook on economics as a basis.

IV 
PLACE OF ECONOMICS IN THE CURRICULUM 
AND ITS RELATION TO OTHER SUBJECTS 
Economics belongs among the “‘social studies” 
with history and civics 
In what has just been said, it has been taken for 
granted that economics belongs to the same group 
or department of studies with history and civics. 
The only other department which would have any 
claim on it would be the commercial department. 
But the aim of the commercial department is 
primarily vocational, while the aim of the de- 
partment of history and social science should be 
primarily preparation for citizenship. Teachers 
of history and civics are, on the whole, more likely 
to be qualified to teach the subject than the teach- 
ers of commercial branches. They are, in fact, the 
only teachers in the secondary school who are 
specifically trained to think in terms of the social 
organism. The replies to the writer’s question- 
naire show that economics is taught by about 
twice as many teachers whose chief work is his- 
tory and civics as by those whose work is prin- 
33 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
cipally in commercial subjects. The fact that 
economics is almost uniformly classified with 
history and civics in educational books and official 
documents renders extended argument on this 
matter superfluous. The existing committee of 
the National Education Association on the Articu- 
lation of High School and College, in subdividing 
its work established a committee on “social 
studies” which include civics, economics, and 
history. To the writer the expression “social 
studies” seems a very happy one. It will be for- 
tunate if the nomenclature becomes general, for 
it will focus attention upon the true function of 
the department which has hitherto been called the 
history department. In the opening sentence of 
the preliminary report upon “Social Studies” 
made at the meeting of 1913 are these significant 
words, “It is probable that the high-school 
teachers of the social studies have the best oppor- 
tunity ever offered to any social group to improve 
the citizenship of the land.” 
Economics, with civics, should be a required 
subject 
If our reasoning up to this point has been 
sound, it follows that civics and economics should 
be required subjects for all pupils who are not 
34
-P-A-G-E-49
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
definitely fitting for higher institutions of learn- 
ing, where they will have opportunity later to 
pursue the subject. To require these studies is in 
accord with the best modern educational theory 
which favors the teaching, not of those subjects 
which are supposed to train the faculties, but of 
those subjects with which the mature mind will 
have to deal. At present, few schools require 
economics. There are more which require civics. 
Of the schools replying to the writer’s question- 
naire, about one third require the subject in the 
commercial course. About one eighth require it 
in one or more courses aside from the commercial 
course. In Quincy (Illinois), Arvada (Colorado), 
and the Central Manual Training School of Phil- 
adelphia, it is required of all pupils. At Dean 
Academy, Franklin, Massachusetts, all pupils, 
except the college preparatory, are required to 
take the same subjects in the senior year, about 
two fifths of the time being given to civics, and 
three fifths to economics. The two subjects con- 
stitute a single course under the same teacher. 
This is the ideal arrangement unless even more 
time can be given to these very important 
subjects. 
35  
-P-A-G-E-50
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
Girls should not be excused from studying economics 
In this connection, the question might be 
raised whether the “citizenship course” should 
be required of girls as well as boys. It was the 
experience of Professor Clow, in his classes of 
normal-school pupils, that the young women did 
not do as good work as the young men. The num- 
ber of young women who failed to pass was, how- 
ever, only 4.7 per cent, while 2.6 per cent of the 
young men failed. The great majority of the 
young women had creditable records. Most girls 
in the last years of their secondary-school course 
are certainly capable of profiting by the study 
of economics. In the States where women possess 
the same voting privileges with men there would 
seem to be no foundation whatever for making 
any distinction. Though not an advocate of 
woman suffrage, the writer would favor requiring 
economics and civics of girls as well as boys in all 
States. The influence of women in public affairs 
is constantly increasing and woman suffrage may 
be extended to other States. At any rate, it is 
important that woman’s influence, whether great 
or small, should be based upon knowledge rather 
than upon ignorant sentiment. The broadening 
influence of economics is especially valuable for 
36  
-P-A-G-E-51
  
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
girls, as it takes them into a field in which they 
would otherwise probably not become interested. 
Women as a class are brought into contact less 
with the world than men and therefore have even 
more need to study economics. Women, too, 
have a great influence in the very important mat- 
ter of expenditure. The training of American 
women in the wise and harmonious expenditure 
of money would be of incalculable benefit to our 
nation. The charitable work of the community 
tends to fall largely into the hands of women and 
without the power to think clearly on social 
subjects they are likely to do more harm than 
good in many cases by so-called charitable work. 
Economics should be studied in the last year of the 
course 
It is desirable that the subject of economics be 
approached with considerable maturity of mind. 
There is no danger that the secondary-school 
pupil will have passed the plastic stage. It is, 
therefore, advisable to give him economics in the 
last year of his course. In seventy-three per cent 
of the schools of which the writer has information, 
the study comes in the fourth year; in fourteen 
per cent, in the third year; and in eleven per 
cent, in either the third or fourth year. It is evi- 
37
-P-A-G-E-52
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
dent that the overwhelming opinion favors the 
fourth year. 
The minimum length of the course 
The available statistics show that by far the 
commonest time allotment is a daily recitation 
for one half-year. Some schools give three periods 
for a year and a few still more. It seems to the 
writer that the minimum time allotment should 
be five periods per week for a half-year. One 
semester is a short time allotment in compari- 
son to the importance of the subject. When we 
compare a half-year with the year usually given to 
such subjects as algebra and geometry and three 
or four years given to a language, which will, in 
the case of three fourths of the pupils who study 
it, have no point of contact with their life after 
they leave school, this is self-evident. Twice the 
time would produce more than twice the results, 
but one semester is certainly worth having. 
Where a year can be given to the subject civics 
should come in the third year or run parallel with 
economics in the fourth. _ 
The relation of economics to civics 
Our previous discussion has brought out the 
fact that the writer considers civics as next in 
38
-P-A-G-E-53
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
importance to economics in the formation of in- 
telligence on public questions. Civics and eco- 
nomics may well form one unit, that is, a five-hour 
course for a year. For this arrangement we have 
the distinguished support of the Committee on 
“Social Studies” of the National Education As- 
sociation to which reference has already been 
made, who give this unit the title “Economics 
and Civic Theory and Practice.” 
The relation of economics to history 
What shall we do, then, with the four famous 
blocks of history of the Committee of Seven of 
the American Historical Association? There is 
one very simple solution, namely, to teach only 
three of the blocks and use the place of the other 
for civics and economics. Ancient history might 
come the first year, medieval and modern, the 
second year, and American history the third year. 
In this case the English part of the European 
history should be emphasized. Another way is to 
do as above except that the second-year course 
might consist of English history with a setting 
of the most important parts of Continental his- 
tory. The way the writer would personally ad- 
vocate is to divide European history into two 
parts, the first to cover both ancient and medieval 
39
-P-A-G-E-54
    ECONOMICS IN THE 
history and the second to cover modern history, 
each part to have one year. In this way recent 
European history receives due emphasis. The last 
two years of the course are then left for American 
history and a course in civics and economics. 
Textbooks intended to cover European history 
in two years are already appearing. The Commit- 
tee of Five of the American Historical Association 
significantly say, ‘‘We are . . . not ready to assert 
that the course of the world’s history can in no 
case be covered intelligently and effectively in 
three years.” Another way is to offer all of the 
four blocks of history as electives, simply pre- 
scribing that a minimum amount of history be re- 
quired. If a pupil has time for it, the author sees 
no objection, but on the contrary great advan- 
tage, in a pupil’s pursuing United States history 
at the same time that he is taking civics and 
economics. 
The Committee of Seven and the Committee of 
Five of the American Historical Association may 
be justly criticized for giving no attention to the 
need of finding a place for economics in connec- 
tion with history and civics. The Committee of 
the National Education Association on Social 
Studies have not made this mistake. They have 
proposed the following five units: (1) Community 
40
-P-A-G-E-55
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
civics and survey of vocations; (2) European his- 
tory to 1600 or 1700; (3) European history to the 
present time (including contemporary civiliza- 
tion;) (4) United States history since 1760 (in- 
cluding current events); (5) economics and civic 
theory and practice. They contemplate a scheme 
for reducing the history to two units, where 
necessary, but how this is to be done is an open 
question. Without indorsing all the details, the 
writer feels that this committee’s ideas as to the 
function of the social studies and the content of 
the course are essentially sound. 
In the teaching of history the economic and 
civic phases should be emphasized. History fur- 
nishes many illustrations of economics laws. 
For example, the Black Death can be used to 
teach the pupil about wages and the assignats 
of the French Revolution to teach him about in- 
flation. It is well that the pupil should receive 
considerable incidental teaching in economics 
before he takes up its systematic study. The 
teacher ought always to have the conscious aim 
of fitting for citizenship and in particular of 
preparing the pupil for the systematic study of 
civics and economics. Every course in history, 
and American history in particular, can be made 
to minister to these ends.

  ECONOMICS IN THE 
The relation of economics to subjects other than 
those already discussed 
In general, there is little attempt to correlate 
other subjects with economics. In commercial 
schools and the commercial departments of large 
schools, it is usually preceded by commercial 
geography, commercial law, and often by com- 
mercial or industrial history. The usual content of 
commercial geography is probably the best of all 
preparations for the study of economics. If the 
pupil knows the principal facts of commerce and 
industry, of climate and the geographical factors 
affecting production, and of agriculture, manu- 
facturing, and transportation, he has a decided 
advantage over a pupil who has not had such a 
course. 
Certain parts of commercial law are of great 
value as a preparation for the profitable study 
of economics. Commercial and industrial history 
also furnish an excellent apperceptive basis for 
economics. In all these subjects there should be 
a definite effort to prepare the pupil for the later 
study of economics. Bookkeeping is a decided 
help in understanding certain phases of the sub- 
ject of corporations. In the New York High 
School of Commerce the study of mathematics 
42
-P-A-G-E-57
  
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
is definitely correlated with economics through 
the instruction on graphs. 
The same school has a required two-period 
course for the first half-year in local industries. 
It is designed to be of immediate value to the boys 
who must leave school early in the course to go to 
work and to bea preparation for the later course 
in economics. It is so managed as to give not 
only much descriptive economics, but to bring 
out a number of important economic principles. 
A detailed description of this course is given by 
A.L. Pugh in the History Teacher’s Magazine for 
December, 1909. 
Economics and closely related subjects in the 
commercial course 
So far we have not specifically discussed the 
commercial course. In actual practice it is in 
this course that economics is most frequently 
found. Here also we find the best preparation 
in the earlier years for the study of economics in 
later years. In the curriculum for High Schools 
of Commerce recommended by the Committee 
of Nine, Department of Business Education of 
the National Education Association, we find the 
following arrangement of studies which have 
close relations with economics: —

This is an excellent arrangement of studies, 
which provides an unusually fine training for 
intelligent citizenship. It would be better if the 
history of commerce had the place of economics 
(including the time allotment), civics the place 
of history of commerce, and economics the place 
of civics. The makers of actual commercial 
courses have usually put economics in the fourth 
year. This is where the study comes in the courses 
of such schools as the Boston High School of 
Commerce, the Los Angeles Polytechnic High

School, and the New York High School of Com- 
merce. 
The proper content of a secondary-school course in 
economics 
Avery important question is what should be the 
content of a secondary-school course in economics. 
This depends primarily on two factors, the time 
allotment and the purpose of the course. The 
purpose of the course is to make the pupil inter- 
ested in and intelligent about the economic ques- 
tions which will confront him after leaving school. 
The thing to be striven for is ability to observe 
economic phenomena and to think accurately 
about economic questions, to appreciate valid 
arguments which he will read, or hear, and to 
detect invalid arguments. The quality of the 
work is of greater importance than the ground 
covered. The North Dakota Manual for High 
Schools well says, ‘The larger part of the time 
should be devoted to a mastery of underlying 
principles which are now accepted as axiomatic. 
. .. The greater portion of the work on the course 
should be put on: Consumption of wealth, pro- 
duction of wealth, definition, factors; exchange, 
money, banking and credit, international trade, 
tariff; distribution, interest, rent, profit, wages; 
45  
-P-A-G-E-60
  ECONOMICS IN THE SCHOOL 
review of elementary concepts, wealth, capital, 
value, utility; and study of economic problems, 
public finance, socialism.” The New York sylla- 
bus goes into great detail. It errs, in the opinion 
of the writer, in being too extensive for a time 
allotment of two periods per week for a year. It 
contains a good deal of material about New York 
State which would be better omitted in a short 
course. It brings in such problems as socialism, 
government control of industry, transportation, 
taxation, etc., under some one of its three main 
divisions: consumption, production, and distribu- 
tion. It would seem better to take the fundamen- 
tals first and then give such time as is available 
to the study of special problems. It is, however, 
a careful and logical piece of work which will 
repay study by any teacher of economics. Chap- 
ter vit of this monograph contains a detailed 
discussion of the question of the proper content 
of the secondary-school course in economics.

METHODS OF TEACHING ECONOMICS 
The work should be based upon a good textbook 
WHERE economics is given as a separate subject 
the use of a textbook as the basis of the work ap- 
pears to be well-nigh universal. But the textbook 
in economics must not be expected to teach the 
subject by itself any more than a text in physics 
or geometry would be expected to do so. Some 
of the textbooks contain a preliminary survey of 
economic history, but none of them make any 
particular use of this material in the later parts 
of the book. There is some value, perhaps, in 
this, but, if the time is short, the writer would 
advise entering at once upon economics proper. 
The best textbook available should be selected 
and all work should center around that one book. 
The definitions in economics are very important 
and should be very carefully explained. The 
teacher should take great pains to see that the 
pupils fully grasp the principal economic con- 
cepts. Socialism, monopolies, and trusts cannot 
47  
-P-A-G-E-62
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
be discussed intelligently unless we know the 
ideas for which they stand. One cannot follow 
the argument for or against the single tax unless 
he has thoroughly grasped the concept of rent. 
Every definition and law must be abundantly 
illustrated from actual life, and the more familiar 
and simple the life, the better. Illustrations fur- 
nished by the pupils and from the life with which 
they are familiar should be sought. For instance, 
the law of normal value can be made plain by 
reference to the articles which members of the 
class are in the habit of buying. The pupil must 
be constantly made to realize that the subject has 
to do with the actual life of men. When an ab- 
stract principle is stated it should always be illus- 
trated by something within the knowledge of the 
pupils in the class. In the words of Professor Clow, 
“Tf John cannot grasp the proposition that a 
change in prices causes an inverse change in de- 
mand, he will see the point quickly when asked 
what effect the rise and fall in the price of books, 
clothing, or railroad travel would have in his 
demand for them.” 
The recitation in economics 
The recitation in economics should conform to 
what is generally recognized as good practice 
48
-P-A-G-E-63
{SECONDARY SCHOOL 
in other subjects.1 A few suggestions may, how- 
ever, properly be made. If there was written 
work at the preceding recitation it may be briefly 
criticized. Examples of good work and of poor 
work may be read, excellences and faults being 
indicated. The writer would advise brief written 
exercises at frequent intervals. The fact that a 
pupil may have a written exercise at any time is 
a great help in securing careful preparation. Writ- 
ing leads to accuracy and precision of thought. 
Definitions, economic laws, and answers to eco- 
nomic problems are excellent things to have writ- 
ten. Sometimes the question or questions should 
be on the lesson of the preceding day and some- 
times on the new lesson, or sometimes on both. 
While writing is very valuable it should not oc- 
cupy a very large part of any ordinary recitation 
period. Five minutes will usually suffice for such 
written work as the writer has in mind. The class 
should always be quizzed orally to discover 
gaps in knowledge and fill them in. There should 
be great freedom for pupils to ask questions. Dis- 
cussion, not too prolonged, and germane to the 
subject, should be encouraged. The Socratic 
method is well adapted to economics, but the 
1 See the Recitation, by G.H. Betts (Riverside Educational 
Monographs). 
49
-P-A-G-E-64
    ECONOMICS IN THE 
teacher must exercise vigilance to prevent the 
waste of time. The pupil should be encouraged 
to challenge the opinion of the author and the 
teacher, provided he does it intelligently. Pupils 
get great pleasure from the discovery of the errors 
of others. The assignment of the next lesson 
should be done with deliberation. In making it, 
the teacher should point out the difficulties to be 
encountered and give sufficient help so that the 
pupil can surmount them. He should prepare 
himself as carefully to make the assignment of 
the next lesson as to conduct the recitation on the 
lesson of the day and should be sure to reserve 
adequate time for this important task. 
How to fix concepts and principles in the mind 
A great danger in economics is that the stu- 
dent will readily assent to the statement of prin- 
ciples, which in many cases seem self-evident, but 
will not apply the principles in his own thinking. 
He is also likely to fail to use the concepts which 
he has acquired. Problems and more problems is 
the remedy for this fault. Every problem should 
be strictly relevant to the matter in hand, should, 
as a general rule, sharply isolate the point to be 
made, but should not be too simple. A problem 
may have more than one possible answer because 
5°
-P-A-G-E-65
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
it may be that good authorities differ. Or it may 
have different answers according to different 
conditions. For example, the question might be 
asked, “‘What is the incidence of a tax on dwell- 
ing-houses?”’ Under normal circumstances the 
answer would be that the tax falls upon the ten- 
ant, but this would not necessarily be true in 
a community which is diminishing in numbers. 
Economic laws of the greatest significance and 
true in general, or in the long run, often do not 
work out in some exceptional case. This does not 
disprove their general validity, but the pupil 
should learn that there are exceptions to many 
economic laws. There is sometimes a chance to 
use arithmetical problems which will illustrate 
such topics as the law of rent or monopoly price. 
There may well be a few problems to illustrate 
the complexity of real life. Several of the short 
textbooks on economics contain questions and 
problems, some of which are very good. A book 
called Outlines of Economics developed in a Series 
of Problems by Members of the Department of 
Political Economy of the University of Chicago 
contains many problems which are not beyond 
the ability of the secondary-school pupil and de- 
serves high commendation. 
The following are examples of good problems:— 
5r
-P-A-G-E-66
    ECONOMICS IN THE 
. Is a share of stock in the Cunard Steamship 
Company wealth from the standpoint of eco- 
nomics? 
. A newspaper reports that King Haakon of Nor- 
way made this statement, “I could black my 
own boots if I wished to. I have done it and 
therefore know how, but if I did, what would 
become of the people who make their living by 
blacking boots?” What does the economist say 
about this? 
. Is a railroad an instrument of production, of ex- 
change, or of distribution, in the economic sense? 
. Why does any farmer cultivate more than one 
acre at any one time? 
(University of Chicago Outlines.) 
. If the supply of all commodities were suddenly 
doubled, would any change in their relative values 
ensue? 
. We pay one hundred and ten million dollars per 
annum for the carrying of products between this 
and foreign countries. Think of it! One hundred 
and ten million dollars in gold coin has gone out 
of the commerce of this country into the com- 
merce of other countries. Can New York stand 
this? (Speech of James G. Blaine in 1881.) 
(a) Is it likely that we lost one hundred and ten 
million dollars in gold from our circulation be- 
cause we hired foreigners to carry our goods? 
(b) Is it likely that we even temporarily parted 
with that much gold on that account? 
(c) Is it likely that as a nation we should have 
52

been that much richer if we had done this carry- 
ing of products for ourselves? 
(University of Michigan.) 
7. A Boston daily paper, July 21, 1913, contained 
the following squib, anent the salary of Secre- 
tary of State Bryan: “Still, $12,000 a year is 
$12,000 and not $6,000, as it would have been if 
the country had gone on the silver basis in ’96.” 
What erroneous impression might this convey? 
8. Examine the opinion of Locke that an increased 
supply of gold tends to lower the rate of interest. 
9. What would be the effect on real wages of a great 
increase in the ability of those who are managing 
industries of all kinds? 
to. When is a tax on carriages and horses a direct 
and when an indirect tax? 
Reviews and examinations 
Whenever in the progress of the course a matter 
arises that requires knowledge of something which 
has been previously studied, there should be ques- 
tions to make sure that the pupils possess the 
necessary background. Whenever any large 
topic is finished, there should be a lesson upon the 
entire topic. There should also be a general re- 
view at the end of the course in order that the 
pupil may get a comprehensive view of the entire 
subject. To a large extent problems should be 
used in conducting this review. They will tend 
53
-P-A-G-E-68
  
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
to bring out sharply the important concepts and 
principles. They will also be more interesting than 
a mere repetition of the ground previously cov- 
ered. In planning the course the teacher should 
allow at least one tenth of the time to be used at 
the end for purposes of general review and ex- 
amination. The final examination should require 
the pupil to apply the knowledge which he has 
acquired. Great care should be taken not to have 
the examinations too long. There should be time 
enough to allow all who have really mastered 
the subject to think out their answers carefully. 
No pupil should be regarded as having done first- 
class work who cannot write an excellent paper 
at the end of the course. It is not recommended, 
however, that failure to pass the final examination 
should in itself deprive the pupil of the credit for 
his course. 
The following are examples of the sort of ques- 
tions which pupils should be able to answer at 
the close of the course in economics: — 
1. Mention a business undertaking that is based 
upon the creation of (a) time value, (6) place 
value, (c) form value. Explain in each case how 
value is created. (New York State Educational 
Department.)

If the price of the product is $.50 a bushel, what 
will be the rental value of each grade of land?

  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The notebook 
The pupil should keep a notebook, chiefly for 
the purpose of recording supplementary material 
given by the teacher. The amount of material 
of this kind will naturally be rather limited in a 
short course. It will consist largely of such facts 
as are necessary to bring a subject up to date. 
For example, if a class were studying the chap- 
ter on monopolies in Bullock’s Elements of Eco- 
nomics, where there is a brief historical sketch 
of the question in the United States, it would 
clearly be the business of the teacher to give the 
class essential facts in reference to the recent 
decisions of the United States Supreme Court 
in the Oil and Tobacco cases. A number of good 
teachers have the pupils make an outline of the 
text as they proceed. The notebook would nat- 
urally contain directions for work given by the 
teacher; outlines of collateral reading, and other 
material. The notebook should never be an end 
in itself. It must always be remembered that it 
is a means only. 
Essays 
During his course, each pupil should write at 
least one carefully prepared essay. If this is based 
57  
-P-A-G-E-72
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
on reading, there should be a bibliography with 
accurate citations and a carefully prepared out- 
line. This essay may be on some economic ques- 
tion or may be descriptive of some industry 
personally investigated from the economic stand- 
point by the pupil. The latter is to be strongly 
recommended. Ely and Wicker’s Elementary 
Principles of Economics contains an excellent list 
of subjects. The industries and natural resources 
of the locality will suggest many subjects to the 
thoughtful teacher. The pupil himself will often 
suggest a subject which the teacher will be glad to 
approve. The following are typical examples of 
good subjects: (x) Our National Ash Heap; (2) 
How our City is Fed; (3) Child Labor; (4) Postal 
Savings Banks. 
The use of newspaper clippings 
The writer of this monograph has made a good 
deal of use of short newspaper clippings, which are 
kept in a book separate from the notebook. The 
clippings must be upon an economic topic. The 
selection of the articles is in itself an exercise 
in discriminating between what is economic and 
what is not. This part of the work is not started 
until the class has been studying the subject 
several weeks. The pupil is required to write a 
58
-P-A-G-E-73
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
brief comment on each clipping. The comment 
may consist of an explanation of an economic 
term which appears in the article. For example, 
the term “preferred stock” furnishes a starting- 
point for a brief statement about the organiza- 
tion of a corporation. The comment may consist 
of the explanation of an economic phenomenon 
like the price of sterling exchange on a certain 
day. It may consist of the reasons for approving 
or disapproving some legislative project of an 
economic nature. Especially to be encouraged 
are comments which point out economic fallacies 
which appear in print. This is hard for a pupil to 
do, though such fallacies are not infrequent even 
in the editorial columns of metropolitan journals. 
Other collateral reading 
A large part of the schools report the use of col- 
lateral reading of some kind. Some schools use 
several textbooks, having the pupils pursue the 
topical method of study. To the writer of this 
study, it seems far better for the pupil to begin 
by mastering one book, but other texts may prof- 
itably be used to obtain information which does 
not happen to be contained in the regular text- 
book. Much better for collateral study than other 
books, covering essentially the same ground as 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
ECONOMICS IN THE 
the text, is illustrative material like bank reports, 
political platforms, messages of the President, 
the Governor, and the Mayor (if the pupil lives 
in a city). The writer has used presidential and 
gubernatorial messages in some of his classes with 
much satisfaction. The lesson for a certain day 
consisted of selecting the economic proposals 
contained in not too large a part of the message 
and a free discussion of these proposals. Pupils 
were held responsible for the principal points 
brought out in these discussions. Magazine ar- 
ticles dealing with current economic problems 
may be assigned to individual pupils for reading 
and report. Some schools require the review of an 
entire book of considerable size. Other schools 
have a report on current economic topics at stated 
intervals. Outside readings which illustrate or 
prove economic principles are of particular value. 
Several books designed for collateral reading for 
college classes have been prepared. These contain 
selections from the writings of economists both 
past and present, accounts of economic occur- 
rences, selections from the reports of various com- 
missions and government departments, and 
extracts from important laws having an eco- 
nomic bearing. Parts of these can be profitably 
used by secondary-school pupils. All of these uses 
60
-P-A-G-E-75
  
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
of material outside the text are good if rightly 
used. The essential thing to be obtained, how- 
ever, is not the mere reading by the pupil of cer- 
tain material, but some sort of reaction by him 
on the material. If, for instance, current topics 
are used, the pupil reporting should be required 
to show the significance of what is reported. It 
is desirable that the school library be well 
supplied with material for collateral reading. 
Some of this should be used chiefly by the teacher 
and the results of his reading interpreted to the 
pupils. Other parts, which should be carefully 
selected by the teacher, should be used by the pu- 
pils. Teachers can gain much help in their teach- 
ing by becoming familiar with the methods of 
presentation used in other elementary texts than 
those in the hands of the class. In another part 
of this monograph will be found a suggestive list 
of books, and other material for supplementary 
uses. The writer is convinced, however, that there 
is no better kind of supplementary work than 
such use of short newspaper clippings as has 
been already described. 
The use of graphs and charts 
A number of schools have pupils make graphs 
and prepare statistical charts. Where there is 
61  
-P-A-G-E-76
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
time enough, this is an excellent thing to do. 
Some textbooks, especially Laughlin’s Elements 
of Political Economy, contain charts and graphic 
illustrations of economic facts and principles 
which are distinctly helpful. In some cases it is 
possible by means of a single diagram to make in- 
telligible at a glance what would otherwise require 
amore or less elaborate explanation. The teacher 
may very properly draw figures on the board for 
pupils to copy in their notebooks. But only those 
which arereally significant and which thepupilsare 
expected to be able to reproduce should be given, 
Debates on economic subjects 
Debates on those questions where there are two 
fairly balanced sides are excellent. There may be 
some debates in class, but it is better still if the 
work in economics can be closely connected with 
the work of a regularly organized debating soci- 
ety. The teacher should guide the preparation of 
the debate and should always point out after 
the debate any economic fallacies which have 
appeared in the discussion. 
The bulletin board 
Another device which is largely used is the 
bulletin board. On this are posted significant 
62
-P-A-G-E-77
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
current articles from the newspapers, the price 
of silver, cotton, and other staples, the quotations 
for sterling exchange, the current rate of interest, 
bank clearings, etc. 
Observation of economic institutions 
Visits to institutions of economic interest such 
as business establishments, stock exchanges, im- 
migrant stations, etc., are used in several schools. 
A visit to a public market is an excellent thing 
when price is being studied. The physical diffi- 
culty of managing them and their time-consum- 
ing nature are hindrances to this sort of work. 
It is well to do as much of it as circumstances 
permit. Sometimes a whole class will make the 
visit and sometimes a pupil alone who is inves- 
tigating a particular topic. In either case, the 
teacher should point out what to look for. 
Without guidance investigation of this sort will 
prove of little value. 
Information obtained from individuals 
Another help which is sometimes used is talks 
by persons qualified to speak on some economic 
problem. This is an excellent way to arouse in- 
terest. Pupils should be encouraged to attend 
lectures and hear speeches in which economic

topics are to be discussed and to have private 
interviews with capitalists, laborers, labor-union 
leaders, and public officials. A danger to be 
guarded against is that such talks will not get 
at the vital points. Certain fundamentals may be 
so familiar to the business man that he takes for 
granted that the pupil knows the very thing he 
does not know and needs to be told.   
Economics and vocational guidance 
An interesting and excellent combination is 
reported from Saginaw, Michigan. This is theas- 
sociation of economics with vocational guidance. 
In the Boston High School of Commerce the head 
of the department of economics is director of 
the employment bureau. A good course in eco- 
nomics might be of much value to young men and 
women by assisting in the choice of a vocation. 
-It is very certain that a knowledge of economics 
is a necessity for the best work in vocational 
guidance. The increased prominence which voca- 
tional guidance is rightly obtaining ought to help 
to a wider knowledge of economics among teach- 
ers, and to a more extensive study of the subject 
in secondary schools.

The danger of trying to do too much 
It must not be thought, because the writer 
has enumerated and discussed so many ways of 
doing work outside the regular routine of text- 
book recitation, that he is oblivious of the limi- 
tations of time and strength which must affect 
both pupil and teacher. The wise teacher will 
select those methods which seem best adapted to 
the conditions in which he finds himself, which 
include the time allotment, the size of the class, 
the ability and preparation of the pupils, and the 
other work which the teacher has to do. Where 
only one semester is allowed to do the work, the 
teacher must take care that too many things, each 
good in itself, are not attempted, for there is 
danger that the main purpose of the course may 
fail to be attained. © 
The sort of textbook needed 
The question of textbooks has been left for con- 
sideration at the end of this chapter in order that 
it might be discussed in the light of what has 
previously been said. The secondary-school text 
in economics should treat the fundamentals of 
the subject as already set forth in not over ninety 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    
ECONOMICS IN THE 
thousand words, so that it can be covered in one 
semester and some time remain for collateral 
work. Besides the more fundamental parts, the 
same book might well contain chapters on the 
leading economic questions of the day for the use 
of those classes which have time for them. Ma- 
terial of aless important or more difficult charac- 
ter than the fundamental parts should be printed 
in different type and so arranged that it may be 
omitted by classes whose time is limited. In other 
words, the book should be so made up that it can 
be conveniently used for courses of somewhat 
differing lengths. The language should be simple 
and clear. Every technical word should be clearly 
defined. The sections should be numbered and 
each one should have a well-worded heading 
printed in heavy type. Definitions, economic 
laws, and important words and phrases should be 
printed in italics or otherwise made prominent. 
The principles set forth should be carefully ex- 
plained and abundantly illustrated. Numbering 
and lettering should be freely used to bring out 
the relation of one part of the text to another. 
This is a decided help to the pupil toward grasp-. 
ing the subject. At the end of each chapter there 
should be a good set of questions and economic 
problems such as have been described. All these 
66

SECONDARY SCHOOL 
excellences have appeared in different texts, but 
have been only partly combined in any one book. 
Some of the books which are in use 
Several textbooks of considerable merit have 
been written on elementary economics, but we will . 
simply notice briefly the five books which now 
practically occupy the field. The replies to the 
writer’s questionnaire indicate that the following 
books were the only ones which were used to 
any considerable extent: Ely and Wicker’s 
Elementary Principles of Economics, Bullock’s 
Elements of Economics, Bullock’s Introduction to 
the Study of Economics, and Laughlin’s Ele- 
ments of Political Economy. The last, which is the 
oldest of the above-mentioned texts, and is some- 
what old-fashioned, is now the least used. It has 
exercises at theend of eachchapter,many of which 
are excellent. The book is somewhat too volumi- 
nous for a half-year course in the subject, but is 
so arranged that Part 1 makes a complete course 
byitself. Professor Bullock is an excellent econo- 
mist and the general soundness of hispresentation 
of the subject doubtless accounts for the wide use 
of his two books. The Elements is not, however, 
well arranged for teaching purposes, and the au- 
thor has not succeeded very well in making its 
67
-P-A-G-E-82
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
language suitable to the secondary-school pupil. 
Some of the descriptive and historical material 
could be abbreviated without serious loss. The 
Introduction is an excellent college book, but was 
never intended for the secondary school. Burch 
and Nearing’s Elements of Economics is a new 
book issued in 1912. It has already met with a 
good dealof favor. Dr. Burch, one of the authors, 
isa secondary-school teacher in Philadelphia. The 
book is of reasonable compass, and its language 
is usually clear. It seems to the writer to have too 
much purely descriptive material and to omit 
some topics which ought to be treated ‘even in 
an elementary book. It also appears not to rep- 
resent so well as Bullock’s Elements, and Ely 
and Wicker, the general consensus of economic 
thought. The Ely and Wicker has many ex- 
cellent features. It is of reasonable compass, 
impartial, logically arranged, and on the whole 
easily understood. Its make-up is such as to 
assist the pupil in studying it. Important words, 
phrases, and sentences are italicized. It has a 
summary and questions at the end of each 
chapter. Some of the material is printed in 
smaller type than the rest to indicate its lesser 
importance. The chapters on economic history 
add little to the real value of the book, but 
68
-P-A-G-E-83
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
they may easily be omitted in a short course. 
The secondary-school teacher of economics ought 
to possess a copy of each of the above-mentioned 
books. They all contain valuable suggestions for 
him. It would certainly be desirable also that 
several copies of each should be available for the 
use of pupils. 
Our conclusion with reference to textbooks 
In chapter m1 reference was made to the objec- 
tion that there are not suitable textbooks in 
economics for the secondary school. No one of the 
books which we have just discussed seems to the 
writer exactly ideal, but each has its peculiar 
excellences and good work is being done with 
every one of them. There are innumerable books 
in constant use on other subjects which are cer- 
tainly no better adapted to their purpose. When 
due allowance for faults has been made, we still 
conclude that the objection to the study of eco- 
nomics in the secondary school based on the want 
of suitable textbooks is untenable. 
A textbook for the inductive method 
It seems proper before leaving the subject of 
textbooks to speak of Professor H. W. Thurston’s 
Economics and Industrial History for Secondary 
69 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  ECONOMICS IN THE 
Schools, which differs widely in its plan from other 
texts. It is intended as a guide to the inductive 
study of the subject. The pupil begins by making 
a list of all the occupations by which people of 
his acquaintance make a living. Next he divides 
these occupations into classes. In the textbook 
similar work continues through twenty lessons, 
having twenty-nine pages of questions and direc- 
tions as a guide; then follow one hundred and 
forty-four pages of economic history; and last 
of all, eighty-seven pages given to an elementary 
discussion of the fundamental economic princi- 
ples. Even in the last part, the treatment of the 
subject is very largely by questions, to which the 
pupils are to find the answers. This book ap- 
pears to exaggerate a good feature of economic 
teaching, namely, observation of economic phe- 
nomena. This should be used to a considerable 
extent, — do as large an extent as time permits, — 
but the pupil cannot “make his own economics” 
any more than he could make his own physics. 
Moreover, it must be remembered that experi- 
ment by the pupil is impossible in economics. It 
is true that there is a kind of experimentation in 
economics furnished by history and by legislation, 
and that economic hypotheses like other scien- 
tific hypotheses must be verified, but the pupil 
7O
-P-A-G-E-85
  SECONDARY SCHOOL 
cannot do this in the laboratory even to the 
limited extent to which he can do it in the phys- 
ical sciences. The verification of economic laws 
usually requires very wide observation both as 
to time and as to space. Some of the simplest 
economic principles, which are now regarded as 
axiomatic, were not understood by such a great 
man as Turgot, though he was a diligent student 
of economic science. In economics the principles 
are often simple, while the facts are very com- 
plicated; for example, Gresham’s Law and the 
fact that international trade is essentially the 
exchange of commodities. Then, there is danger 
of wasting time on the “investigation” of things 
the pupils already know. The aggregate experi- 
ence of a class will be found to be large and it can 
constantly be drawn upon as needed. However, 
Professor Thurston’s book contains much that 
can be profitably used by a teacher of economics. 
Many of its questions are very good.

THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE IN ECONOMICS 
A suggestive outline 
Tue outline which is here given is for a course 
in economics for five periods per week for one 
semester. It is believed that well prepared fourth- 
year pupils can cover it all and that there will 
still remain some time for the introduction of work 
of the teacher’s own selection and for a proper 
final review and examination. Doutbless many 
teachers will find that there are omissions of 
things they would deem more important than 
some things which are included. The outline is 
intended to be suggestive to the teacher who has 
to plan a course. Such a teacher will naturally 
modify it somewhat to suit his own views and to 
meet his own problems.

Additional work 
In making the foregoing outline it has been 
assumed that the pupil will write an original 
essay and do some of the kinds of work mentioned 
in chapter v in addition to covering the topics. 
Where there is sufficient time the outline may 
easily be expanded by giving some of the topics 
in a good deal of detail or by introducing other 
topics in the proper connection. If the course 
is completed before the time is all used, other 
topics may be taken up at that time. Such books 
as the general treatises of Hadley, Seligman, and 
Taussig will furnish a great deal of material 
which the teacher may profitably use. The fol-

lowing short list of topics, from which selections 
might be made, is given simply by way of sug- 
gestion: advertising, commercial crises, income 
and expenditures of the National Government, 
the merchant marine and the proposal for sub- 
sidies, the economic function of the middleman, 
postal savings banks, good roads, reciprocity, 
speculation, water transportation. The course 
may properly be extended by the detailed con- 
sideration of some subjects from the historical 
point of view as, for example, the monetary or 
tariff history of the United States. Concrete 
studies, like the study of the resources of the state 
or region where the pupils live, will employ the 
time to good advantage and give the pupils an 
opportunity to apply what they have learned 
earlier in the course.

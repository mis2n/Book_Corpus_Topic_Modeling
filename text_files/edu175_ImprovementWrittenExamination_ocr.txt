  GENERAL PREFACE 
Educational tests are needed for a number of reasons, among 
the most important of which are the following: 
1. To show the pupil the efficiency with which he has 
worked. 
2. To show the teacher the efficiency with which she has 
taught. 
3. To measure the value of a given textbook. 
4. To measure the value of a given method of teaching. 
5. To compare the efficiency of teaching in one school with 
that in another school. 
6. To guarantee a thorough and rigorous attack, not only 
in study but also in teaching. 
7. To get a general but useful index of the status of teaching 
in any given school system. 
It is now clear that although standardized tests have per- 
formed and still perform a very useful service, they are not well 
adapted to many of the needs which have just been outlined. 
Few if any can be used to measure progress over a brief period. 
Many objectives of importance have no standardized tests 
by which they can be measured, nor are the standardized tests 
easily modified or adapted for the measurement of a chang- 
ing course of study or of a course of study where differences 
in judgment exist as to what is important to teach. They are 
also influenced greatly not only by special practice upon the 
tests themselves, but also by exercises which closely resemble 
those contained in the tests. Therefore an improvement in 
the score on a given test cannot be taken as a safe indication 
of the progress really made in the set of abilities which has 
been tested. Some of the standard tests which are now on

the market have remained unchanged for many years so that 
the standards originally set are not now satisfactory. 
This does not mean that standard tests have not served an 
important purpose or that they are not or will not continue to 
be of value. It merely shows the limitations of these tests. 
Of these various limitations the most important is the diffi- 
culty of adapting them to the measurement of accomplish- 
ment of specific objectives, and particularly those which are 
to be accomplished in a relatively brief unit of time, such as 
a day, a week, or a month. Often great injustice is done 
both teacher and pupil by presuming to measure an accom- 
plishment by a standardized test which is not a valid measure 
of that accomplishment, and although it may be urged that. 
standardized tests need not be so misused, the fact remains 
that such misuse is all too frequent. Certainly this is true in 
term testing. For example, efficiency in teaching spelling in a 
given term is commonly measured by a test selected without 
reference to the words taught during that term. Similarly, 
improvement in reading during the term is frequently meas- 
ured by one or more standardized tests which correspond by 
no means perfectly to the specific habits, attitudes, and abili- 
ties which the pupil and teacher attempted to develop. 
There can be no question but that standardized tests have 
had a very wide and beneficial influence in increasing the 
experimental study of school practice, as well as in the devel- 
opment of techniques and methods of objective testing. 
Through the interest which has been an outgrowth of the use of 
standardized tests, there has now developed a new type of test 
program which emphasizes the technique of testing rather than 
the test itself. These new and more perfect methods of test- 
ing fill a need which cannot be met by the use of standardized 
tests. In the first place, they are easily adapted to measure 
progress over any given unit of time no matter how small, 
and, second, they are adapted to the measurement of the 
accomplishment of any educational objective no matter how

small. They are therefore admirably suited for use in experi- 
mental work, either in the field of curriculum research or in the 
field of educational methods. They supplant not the stand- 
ardized tests which are hardly suited for monthly, weekly, or 
daily testing, but rather the traditional essay test which, 
although intended for such use, is now known to be so unre- 
liable as to be very unsatisfactory. 
Dr. Ruch has performed a real service in presenting the 
evidence concerning the reliability of various forms of tests 
and in illustrating so clearly the different ways in which these 
tests may be prepared. There is no question, in the writer’s © 
judgment, but that this book marks out the next big field of 
improvement in testing the results of teaching.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
This small volume has been prepared as the result of re- 
peated requests from superintendents, principals, and teachers 
who are desirous of studying critically some of the newer 
proposals for the improvement of examination technique. In 
reality, it is an outgrowth of a syllabus prepared for use with 
a university class in objective examination methods. 
It is hoped that the following pages include enough of the 
significant work which has been done thus far in developing 
objective methods to provide a bird’s-eye view of the aims 
and progress of these efforts. Every attempt has been made 
to provide concrete examples and illustrations of possible 
examination techniques, especially in the fields of composi- 
tion, literature, and reading which offer particular difficulty to 
the maker of examinations. 
At times it has been necessary to introduce some elementary 
statistical concepts and practices. For the most part these 
have been placed in footnotes or in the final chapter in order 
that the reader may omit these more technical portions of the 
discussion if his interests are less specialized. It should also 
be said that certain statistical points have purposely been 
given a rather superficial treatment in order to avoid unneces- 
sary technicalities. 
The author’s thanks are due Dr. Ernest Horn, who read the 
entire manuscript and made many helpful suggestions. Dr. 
M. F. Carpenter and Miss Helen Eddy read portions of the 
text and also contributed some of the examinations used for 
illustrations. Mr. George D. Stoddard prepared the graphs 
of Chapter III and checked some of the mathematical calcula- 
tions. Specific acknowledgments to a number of the author’s 
students have been made throughout the text.   G. M. R.

CHAPTER I 
FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATICNS 
Introduction. Examinations are almost or quite as old as 
formal education, and formal educational methods evolve 
but slowly. This is as it should be, since, after all, education 
is one of the conserving forces in society. But the fact that 
this virtue of slow evolution tends at all times to become a, vice, 
with the consequent result that the best teaching practice 
tends to lag too far behind the best thought and theory of 
the moment, would probably be admitted by most educators. 
It is especially unfortunate that examination methods have 
persisted throughout the centuries with modifications that are 
almost microscopic in comparison with the much more con- 
spicuous advances in such aspects of education as the conduct 
of the recitation, the course of studies, the psychology of the 
school subjects, and the administrative organization of our 
schools. It is not too much to say that only within the past 
quarter of a century have important reforms been introduced 
into our technique of measuring the efficiency of instruction. 
The reasons for this inertia in the perfecting of methods of 
written examinations have been two-fold in character. In the 
first place, until very recently it has not been realized that 
there are any disputed issues involved in the usage of the 
traditional written examination. The inherent defects of the 
method have come into clear relief only with the publication 
of the studies of Daniel Starch, F. J. Kelly, F. W. Johnson, 
and others, on the unreliability of teachers’ marks.* These 
criticisms have pointed the way to a consideration of many 
previously unsuspected issues. In the second place, the 
reforms resulting from these studies have been woefully

meager, because the conclusions were chiefly negative in char- 
acter. We are met with the situation today that large num- 
bers of teachers and school officers are justly suspicious of the 
worth of the typical written examination, without possessing 
adequate knowledge of the technique for eliminating these 
faults and dangers. 
Horace Mann As An Early Critic of The Examination. The 
above statements are not quite literally true. As early even 
as the time of Horace Mann, careful thinkers had given atten- 
tion to the matter of the validity of written examinations. For 
calling attention again to the views of Horace Mann on exami- 
nation practices, we are greatly indebted to the authors of a 
most interesting book, Then and Now in Education.* 
In Chapter IV, under the caption ‘Unanswerable Argu- 
ments from the Past,’’ the authors write: 
By no means the least interesting reading in connection with the 
1845 report is the portion of the Common School Journal in which 
Horace Mann justifies the use of printed tests by the survey com- 
mittee. He saw at once the meaning and value of objective measure- 
ment, and even now when the conflict for the scientific study of 
educational processes by means of standard tests has been won, his 
appraisal of the method of the first American survey is still most 
enlightening. 
Briefly, Horace Mann states that the new method of examination 
has a decided superiority over any and all other methods, for the 
following reasons: 
1. It is impartial. 
2. It is just to the pupils. 
3. It is more thorough than older forms of examination. 
4. It prevents the “officious interference” of the teacher. 
. It “determines, beyond appeal or gainsaying, whether the 
pupils have been faithfully and competently taught.” 
6. It takes away “all possibility of favoritism.” 
7. It makes the information obtained available to all. 
8. It enables all to appraise the ease or difficulty of the questions.

FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS 3 
To be sure, Horace Mann did not have in mind exactly the 
same type of objective examination as will be treated in this 
volume, but his arguments can be carried over bodily. Refer- 
ence to the examinations used by the survey committee of 1845 
will show that they were far from completely objective. But, 
after all, that was seventy-five years ago, and several important 
movements, like the rise of the standard educational test and 
the evolution of mental measurement, have intervened to shape 
methods of examining today. The interesting thing is that 
Horace Mann could, in 1845, write a valid set of arguments for 
objective examination practices that can be accepted today with 
but minor modifications and additions! 
Returning to our main task, it may be stated that the func- 
tion of this book is to suggest a methodology of examination 
construction which is immediately serviceable to the classroom 
teacher and supervisor. To accomplish this end, it will first be 
necessary to make a critical analysis of the aims and functions 
of the written examination as an educational instrument. 
Functions of Examinations. The purposes of written -and 
oral examinations have been held to be of three sorts: 
1. Motivation. Educators seem to be agreed that pupils 
tend to accomplish more when confronted with the realization 
that a day of reckoning is surely at hand. The truth of this 
statement rests much more largely upon the consensus of opin- 
ion, it must be admitted, than upon any very convincing experi- 
mental evidence. Only within the past few years have the 
problems of motivation been held to be the subject for experi- 
mentation rather than for a priori beliefs. It is indeed for- 
tunate that direct experiment is proving the fundamental truth 
of our assumptions about the role of motives in learning. 
2. Training in written expression. The accomplishment of 
training in written expression is undoubtedly one of the import- 
ant desiderata of education. Though the emphasis has been 
gradually shifting away from written expression and in the 
direction of oral expression, the change is merely one of a more
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
acceptable distribution of effort from the point of view of 
social utility, and implies no lack of faith in the values of written 
language in the curriculum. This purpose for the examination 
may therefore be admitted, with ‘certain reservations to be 
brought forward later in the book. 
3. Measurement. Measurement has generally been the most 
conscious aim of all. It has also been the one which has been 
the recipient of the brunt of recent attacks. i Examinations 
and measurements are the instruments by which the results of 
education can be evaluated. Since educational theory has 
produced no alternative method of portraying the results of 
teaching, we are perfectly safe in admitting pupil-measurement 
as one of the legitimate functions of the written examination in 
so far as the examination can be shown to be a valid and reliable 
means to this end. 
This inventory of the purposes served by written examina- 
tions does not pretend to be complete. Other purposes suggest 
themselves immediately, and many additional ones do possess 
obvious merit. The three aims described have been selected 
because of their relative importance and because of their direct 
bearing on the problems for discussion in this text. Before 
proceeding to a more comprehensive evaluation of these aims, 
it will clarify matters to suggest the types of examination 
methods which have been proposed and widely used up to the 
present time. 
Types of Examinations. Historically, we can classify exam- 
ination practices as of three kinds: 
1. The traditional ‘‘essay-type” of written examination. 
2. The standardized educational test or scale. 
3. The newer objective examination.* 
Each of these three types has its peculiar characteristics, 
advantages, and limitations. The superiority or inferiority of   
*Objective examinations are to be defined as examinations wher2 the grading does not involve the personal opinion of the grader. The pupil writes very littie, but answers the 
questions by underlining or checking the correct answers. The best known types are the 
true-false, multiple-choice, matching, and completion exercises. Samoles of all of these 
are given in Chapter IV.
-P-A-G-E-15

FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS 5 
any one of these methods can at best be stated only in terms of 
very specific ends to be attained. A blanket defense or con- 
demnation of any one of them is quite impossible. Many 
partisan battles are yet to be waged over this question of relative 
merits, and, indeed, all such: controversies are doomed to be 
miserably barren unless a clear definition of examination 
objectives can be marked out. Three such objectives have 
already been stated and accepted as valid for the purposes of 
the present treatment. Two of these will be dismissed with 
scant attention, for reasons which will now be stated. 
Examinations as Devices for Motivation. With respect to 
the problem of the motivation value of examinations, there is 
no need for detailed treatment here. None of the proposed 
examination practices listed in the preceding paragraph is 
inimical to this crucial aim in teaching. Pupils learn partly 
by virtue of learning capacities which are native or acquired \ 
(apparently largely native according to our best evidence 
today), and partly, or very probably chiefly, in proportion to 
their interests, application, and volitional constitution—in 
other words, in accordance with their motivation. No one can 
say whether the situation of facing a series of questions like: 
“List the main causes of the American Revolution,” or “Why 
does the rainfall of the western slope of the Rockies exceed that 
of the eastern slope?” contains more dynamic or motivating 
properties than the situation of facing a series of exercises like: 
Slavery was one of the important issues in the American 
Revolution. true false 
Taxation without representation was one of the chief 
causes of the American Revolution. true false 
The vegetation of the eastern slope of the Rocky Moun- 
tains is more luxuriant than that of the western slope. true false 
In the absence of any experimental information on this point, 
we need say no more than to suggest that in general the motiva- 
4 tion of learning is likely to be greatest in that situation where 
\ the pupil comes to realize that definitely organized knowledge

6 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
is expected rather than the throwing of a few scattered half- 
truths into the semblance of a paragraph structure. The 
bluffing, muddle-headed student finds himself much more at a 
disadvantage in the newer objective examination than he does 
in the older essay-type. If important differences are found in 
the motivating values of the older and the newer examinations, 
these differences are certain to favor the more objective methods, 
since the pupil rapidly comes to sense the exactness of the 
requirements of the newer examinations. 
Examinations and Language Expression. Turning to the 
uses of examinations in the teaching of written language expres- 
sion, it must be admitted. that at first glance the argument 
seems against the standard test and the objective examination. 
There is no question about this in theory, at least. In actual 
school practice, however, the issue is not so clear. In the first 
place, the two newer types of examinations do not claim to 
serve this purpose. This admission is the less damaging because 
it is thoroughly honest and,conscious. That it is a real limi- 
tation is quite as evident. ro lack of faith in the desirability 
of training in direct, forceful, and logical expression of thought 
as a part of instruction and measurement alike is implied. It 
is nearer the truth to confess that in the newer types of exami- 
nation an important function of the examination has been 
voluntarily sacrificed in the interest of other ends held to be 
equally important and more surely obtainable. 
This suggests an opening for a critical examination of the 
usual written essay-type of examination to discover exactly 
what evidence supports its claim to value as language training. 
{ That written examinations might provide excellent opportuni- 
ties for language training is certain; that they do accomplish 
much of such training is again a matter of faith, not proof. 
At least two arguments can be brought forward which weaken 
the claims of the traditional examination, the one practical, 
the other psychological. 
The practical situation of the writing and correction of an  
-P-A-G-E-17
FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS 7 
examination paper is usually about as follows: The pupil 
writes on a series of questions which, nine times out of ten, 
are far too long and comprehensive for completion in thirty 
or sixty minutes unless the resort is to a set of answers scribbled 
under high tension in the attempt to finish the job. The 
teacher reads the papers in much the same spirit. The task 
at best is uninteresting and\monotonous after the first dozen 
papers have been completed. \ Final examinations in particular 
_are likely to be corrected on the day that all the multitudinous 
tasks incident to the closing of a semester or year of school 
rush in on the tired teacher, who must finish the papers, make 
out the report cards, balance the register, pack her trunk, 
and catch the earliest train home. Where, then, does the 
opportunity for training in the correct use of English come in 
under the situation as it really is? 
In the second place, it is psychologically unsound to believe 
that so complex an ability as language training can be built 
up as a by-product of the written examination. The known 
laws of learning are opposed to this belief. Pupils acquire 
such skills and abilities only under patient, specific instruction, 
and adequate practice. The learning must proceed by slow 
stages with constant-helps over the difficulties. The attention 
must not be divided between the listing of facts and the effort 
at careful expression. 
Pupils will probably continue to write examinations with the 
primary view of getting down the facts as quickly as possible. 
Teachers will probably continue to grade these papers with 
the primary purpose in mind of ascertaining whether a suffi- 
cient number of these facts have been set down by the pupil. 
Neither the pupil nor the teacher disbelieves in the virtue of 
a well-written paper from a literary standpoint, but neither 
is likely to exert great effort toward this end under the prevailing 
conditions of writing examinations. The situation is not made 
any better by the current practice in many schools of filing all 
final examinations in some convenient office without giving
-P-A-G-E-18
  
8 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
opportunity for the pupils to profit by the results of teachers’ 
comments, if indeed any are offered. — 
What is the solution? The linguistic functions of the exam- 
ination must be saved. These are even more important than 
is generally realized. The problem will be clarified and certain 
suggestions will arise when we realize that our examination 
technique must provide for two different things: first, the 
discovery of the pupil’s mastery of subject-matter, i. e., measure- 
ment of achievement; and second, training in thought and 
expression, written and oral. The traditional examination 
serves neither well. The standard test serves the first only. 
The newer objective examination will serve the first only. 
The solution would seem to be that a new methodology 
must be created for language training and measurement apart 
from the more general examination for factual mastery. Just 
what this should be is not within the projected purpose of 
this text; nor (it must be confessed), is it within our present 
knowledge. Drills in written language usages, diagnostic 
exercises, specially derived quality and judgment scales in 
composition and literature, etc., are urgently needed and 
undoubtedly will ultimately be produced. The interests of 
progress will be better served by differentiating these two 
separate objectives and meeting both needs with examination 
instruments designed to these separate ends than by the con- 
tinuation of our present muddled practices in which the sup- 
posed values are at least undemonstrated, if not largely illusory. 
Examinations as Measuring Instruments. The way to the 
improvement of examinations from the point of view of the 
measurement of mastery of factual content is fortunately much 
more clear. The same promise holds for other types of educa- 
tional objectives, like training in thought, judgment, and appre- 
ciation. These statements bring us to the consideration of the 
third of our specific aims of the examination, viz., measurement. 
Measurement has always been the prime consideration in
-P-A-G-E-19
  
FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS 9 
examinations. Although perhaps not a primary function of 
education, measurement does stand in the position of being 
the method by which the realization of primary objectives can 
be demonstrated. In this position it is rather unique among 
educational practices. Until recently no one has felt the neces- 
sity of challenging either the logic or the efficiency of the 
written examination. When we recall the storm of protest 
raised at the beginning of the present century in the meetings 
of the National Educational Association when one bold spirit, 
Dr. J. M. Rice, suggested that it would be quite defensible to 
state the efficiency and worth of the teacher in terms of the 
progress of the pupils, we wonder what conception of the pur- 
pose of examinations existed in the minds of educational 
‘workers. 
There was surely a curious lack of logic in this situation of 
the examination providing an adequate and valid measure of 
the pupil, but at the same time being entirely inadequate and 
unfair as a measure of the teacher. To be sure this conserva- 
tism was directed at the newly derived instrument, the standard 
test, but indirectly it did involve the idea of measurement, 
since increased accuracy of measurement was the main claim 
of the standard test. Now that standardized examinations 
or tests have earned their place, it might appear that these 
issues are closed. The standard test has demonstrated time 
and again its peculiar worth, but it has not and probably will 
not supplant entirely the written examination. The latter has 
its legitimate place and its individual advantages. The 
relations of the two are mutually supplementary, not ex- 
clusive. 
That the written examination is very imperfect is also to be 
concluded as the result of a long series of experimental studies, 
beginning with the investigations of the unreliability of teachers’ 
marks to which reference has already been made at the begin- 
ning of the chapter. Kelly, Starch, Johnson, and others, have  
-P-A-G-E-20
  
10 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
shown that our confidence in such marks is largely undeserved. 
Grading scales have almost invariably erred in the attempt to 
simulate a refinement that is greater than the limitations of 
human judgments will permit. To mark a pupil “893” or 
even “89” in geography and to accept that figure at face value 
is just as absurd as to specify that kindling wood should be 
cut exactly 14.573 inches in length when the average run of wood 
stoves will accommodate lengths of from 12 to 16 inches with 
negligible advantages attaching to any length of sticks within 
these limits. Experience and experiment have shown that 
5-7 point scales (e.g. grading A, B, C, D, E, etc.) represent the 
practical limits of the human mind in its discrimination of 
differences in merit in the achievement of pupils in the school 
subjects. Where greater accuracy is needed, resort must be 
had to more refined measures. 
Our discussion of examinations has reached thus far at least 
two important conclusions. The first is that measurement is 
an important and legitimate aim of the examination and that, 
as such, it should be preserved. In the second place, we have 
been forced to conclude that the written examination is a very 
imperfect form of measurement since it permits of a degree of 
refinement roughly equal to 4 to + of the entire range of the 
differences ordinarily found.in a class of pupils. The next step 
is obviously that of refining the examination to a point where it 
will begin to approach the accuracy of measurement in physics, 
chemistry, and the quantitative sciences generally. In order 
to suggest how improvements might be made, it will be neces- 
sary to review in some detail the characteristics of a good exam- 
ination and the criteria by which examinations can be evaluated 
as to worth as measuring instruments. 
Criteria of a Good Examination. A measuring instrument, 
whether it be an examination, a standard test, or any other 
device for the determination of school achievement, must 
possess certain characteristics and meet certain specific criteria. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  FUNCTIONS OF WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS gE 
Although the relative importance of these criteria varies some- 
what for the standard test and the examination, in brief, an 
examination must possess: 
1. Validity. 
2. Reliability. 
. Objectivity. 
. Ease of administration and scoring. 
. Standards. oo 
oF 
The definition and detailed discussion of the meanings of 
these terms demand a separate chapter, because of the fact 
that technical usages for certain of these terms have grown 
up in the experimental literature. Chapter II will serve this 
purpose, it is hoped. 
. 
SUMMARY 
1. Improvements in examination methods have in general lagged 
behind improvements in teaching methods, curriculum construc- 
tion, and school supervision and administration. < 
{ 2. Examinations serve three general purposes: motivation of learn- 
ing, training in organization and expression of thought, and educa- 
tional measurement. 
\/3. The traditional written examination serves none of these pur- 
poses very well. 
_ be differentiated i least two 4, Examination methods 
types: first, examination the measurement of mastery of 
subject-matter, and secondly, examinations for training in thinking, 
organization, and good literary expression. 
5. The language-training aspect of examinations is an educational 
goal, possessing merit in and of itself, and calling for specific atten- 
tion to its attainment, rather than being left as a largely unattained 
incidental in education.

CHAPTER II 
THE CRITERIA OF A GOOD EXAMINATION 
I. VALIDITY 
Definition of Validity. By validity is meant the degree to 
which a test or examination measures what it purports to measure. 
Validity might also be expressed more simply as the “‘worth- 
whileness” of the examination. For an examination to possess 
validity it is necessary that the materials actually included be 
of prime importance, that the questions sample widely among 
the essentials over which complete mastery can reasonably be 
expected on the part of the pupils, and that proof can be brought 
forward that the test elements (questions) can be defended by 
arguments based on more than mere personal opinion. 
To take a concrete illustration, the Courtis Arithmetic Tests, 
Series B, undoubtedly do possess a high amount of validity for 
the measurement of four rather narrow arithmetical abilities. 
These tests can be said to be valid for the purposes for which 
they were designed, because they meet a number of necessary 
requirements: viz., the examples are typical of types found in 
all textbooks and in all courses of study in arithmetic, and 
embody skills which present educational practice accepts as 
essential. The examples are also of the type that is found on 
the list of recommendations of the various national educational 
committees appointed to draw up curricula for elementary 
schools. Studies of the social utility of arithmetic in later life, 
in industry, in the trades and professions, etc., show that the 
ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide 1-, 2-, 3-, and 
4-place numbers, etc., is in practically universal demand. In 
this simple case the validity of the examination is too obvious 
for lengthy comment.

-P-A-G-E-24
  14 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
On the other hand, the Courtis Series B is not valid for the 
purpose of measuring spelling, reading, geography, general 
intelligence, character, etc., except, of course, as these abilities 
and traits are genuinely correlated with arithmetic. The 
Courtis tests by this reasoning would possess validity for the 
four types of fundamental arithmetical operations which the 
tests actually cover, but this validity would rapidly become 
less and less as such tests were applied to addition in general, 
to arithmetic in general, to mathematics in general, to science 
in general, and to human knowledge in general. 
Validity cannot ordinarily be expressed in purely quanti- 
tative terms like 50 per cent, 80 per cent, or 99 per cent. The 
degree of validity must be left in part to the judgment of 
competent persons, and expressed in terms of statements of 
the methods by which the validation of the test or examination 
materials was guaranteed. These methods of insuring valida- 
tion vary/greatly with the nature of the examination in 
question. \The more important methods of validation may be 
stated as follows: \ 
1. By judgments of competent persons. 
2. By correlation against an outside criterion. 
3. By computation of the percentages of pupils answering 
each item correctly at successive age levels. 
4. By experimental studies of social utility. 
5. By harmonizing with the studies of educational com- 
mittees and bodies on curricula, courses of study, minimum 
essentials, etc. These might include the reports of the U. 8. 
Bureau of Education, the reports of the special committees 
of the National Educational Association, the yearbooks of 
the National Society for the Study of Education, ete. Each 
of the elementary school subjects has been the object of many 
special investigations which have been published, e.g., the 
word counts of Thorndike and Horn, the spelling lists of Horn 
and Ashbaugh, Freeman’s work on handwriting, Bagley’s recom- 
mendations for geography, and a host of others.
-P-A-G-E-25

6. By analysis of textbooks and courses of study. 
7. By combinations of the above, or more rarely by certain 
additional methods not listed because of their limited applica- 
bility. 
It should be evident even from this brief catalog of ways 
and means of insuring validity to an examination that valida- 
tion really raises far-reaching issues and imposes some very 
exacting requirements. Very few written examinations rest 
on any more secure basis than the first of the above mentioned 
methods, although, to be sure, the others may indirectly exert 
their influence. Indeed, the approach to the ideally validated 
examination is only found in rough approximation in the 
very best of our standardized tests, the rank and file of such 
tests being almost as great sinners against the principles of 
validation as the traditional essay-type of examination. To 
urge the force of these criticisms unduly, however, would be 
to lay at the door of the examination and test all of the imper- 
fections and limitations of our present educational methods. 
There would be little justice in such a charge. Educational 
aims and practices today, for the most part rest upon opinions 
of those competent to express such opinions, and will continue 
to do so until the slow results of experimentation will gradually 
replace opinion with facts. That this result will never be 
absolutely attained is to be expected. 
Examinations to be of great value need not be subjected to 
as rigid a validation as is demanded by a completely standard- 
ized test, since a reasonable demand is merely that significant 
and essential materials be included in the examination, leaving 
the larger questions of curriculum building, determination of 
social utilities, etc., to the experts in these fields. The task 
of the teacher is to select the important items from among 
those taught, in sufficient numbers to form an adequate sam- 
pling of the pupils’ abilities, and to form these into an examina- 
tion which is adapted mechanically and psychologically to the 
end of accuracy of measurement. In doing this, the teacher

will find that the weaknesses which can most easily be overcome 
center about the violation of the principles of reliability, 
objectivity, ease of administration and scoring, etc. These 
react on the validity of the examination in an indirect 
fashion. 
That this is true can be seen more clearly after these addi- 
tional criteria have been surveyed. Chapter IV will return 
to this point. For present purposes it will be enough if the 
reader has clearly in mind that the personal judgment of 
the teacher who scores the examination is certain to constitute 
a source of error in the sense that no two teachers can agree 
at all closely upon the merits of a given paper. Such varia- 
tions are subjective errors which are, in large part, unavoidable 
since they are at heart due to the frailties of the human mind 
in forming estimates or passing judgments.. The objective 
examination, as the name implies, avoids these pitfalls of 
grading by reducing the number of possible answers to one, 
or at least a very few, acceptable responses. 
Validation Illustrated in the Case of Reading. The subject 
of reading in the elementary school has been selected for pur- 
poses of illustration because of its unique importance in the 
curriculum, and because of the great difficulties in the way 
of the production and validation of materials in this subject. 
That an easier task, and one which would have provided a 
more clean-cut illustration, could have been chosen is apparent 
to reader and author alike. 
Ability to read silently with comprehension is a very complex 
mental function, very much more so than the usual reading 
textbooks and methods of teaching reading would suggest. 
That this is true may be shown by the following analysis 
which represents the most convenient and comprehensive sum- 
mary of the abilities and skills involved in silent reading that 
has been published to date.*

Some of the specific skills and abilities in the foregoing chart 
are obviously outside the scope of the types of examinations 
considered in this volume. Eliminating these, we are still 
left with a large variety of abilities over which we must teach, 
drill, test, and examine in some fashion. Space will not permit 
an extended discussion of suitable examination materials, but 
the interested student will undoubtedly be able to find help- 
ful suggestions in the teachers’ manuals published in connec- 
tion with various sets of readers. The illustrations that fol- 
low are taken from the Learn to Study Readers.* 
As examples of suitable tests for the child’s ability to differ- 
entiate similar words, these authors give, among others, (p. 17):

The following is a part of a matching exercise suggested for 
testing over a lesson on “What Animals Do You Know” (p. 21): 
The elephant, has a trunk 
Cows have horns 
The squirrel has a bushy tail 
The pig has a curly tail 
The sheep gives us wool 
The cow gives us milk 
Horses pull wagons 
These divided sentences can be placed on cards and shuffled. 
The pupils then are told to match the cards by pairs so as to 
make complete sentences. Or, the lists may be put in parallel 
columns on the blackboard or mimeographed on paper with 
the pairs in random order. 
The following is a part of a test designed to cover the read- 
ing lesson on ‘How to Take Care of a Dog.” The questions 
are to be mimeographed or hektographed, or they may be 
written on the blackboard. The pupil writes, answers, or un- 
derscores, as the case may be, the word “yes” or “‘no.” 
1. Would you give a young puppy meat? Yes No 
2. Would you give a puppy vegetables? Yes No 
3. Is milk good for puppies? Yes No 
4. Are chicken bones good for a dog? Yes No 
5. Should an old dog have three meals a day? Yes No 
6. Should a dog eat between meals? Yes No 
7. Should a dog have water between meals? Yes No 
8. Is bread good for dogs? Yes No 
9. Should dogs have meat at every meal? Yes No 
10. Do dogs get sick from eating too much? Yes No

Thorndike, as a basis for drill and examination materials in 
reading. The Teacher’s Word Book* gives an alphabetical 
list of 10,000 words which were found to occur most widely in 
a count of about 625,000 words from literature for children; 
3,000,000 words from the Bible and English classics; 300,000 
words from elementary school textbooks; 50,000 words from 
books about manual and domestic arts; 90,000 words from 
newspapers; and 500,000 words from correspondence. 
These make possible unlimited materials for tests, drills, 
and examinations on word knowledge, comprehension of sen- 
tences, comprehension of paragraph units, etc. The following 
items show the possibilities for vocabulary tests: 
1. A window is part of a flower house field mountain 
Ja5 la4 la2 la4 lad 
2. An oak is a kind of grain prince game tree 
Ib 1b 1b 1b la2 
3. A goose has feathers roots wool blossoms 
2a 2a 2a 2a 2a 
The numbers and letters below the principal words are the 
Thorndike frequency values, the first number showing the 
thousand value, and the other letters and numbers the place of 
the word within that thousand. Thus, in items 1 and 2 above, 
all of the words are found in the first thousand of the language 
according to the Thorndike count, and all in item 3 occur in 
the second thousand. More specifically, the word “‘window’’ is 
designated 1a5 to show that it belongs in the first half of the 
fifth hundred words within the first one thousand words. _ For 
further details the reader may consult the reference cited. 
Vocabulary tests and examinations constructed by the use of 
these frequency values are considerably improved in validity 
in comparison with arbitrary selections of the critical words 
(i.e., words to be defined, like window, oak, ete.) and the mul- 
tiple responses (i.e., flower, house, field, etc.), because failures

Sentences built up in this way test the ability of the child 
to comprehend the longer units of thought. Since the principal 
words are all of approximately the same difficulty (within the 
accuracy of the Thorndike values), the items are not likely to 
be failed by a pupil because of lack of familiarity of any one 
word. ‘This increases the probability that the success or failure 
of the pupil is success or failure in sentence comprehension 
rather than in mere vocabulary knowledge.

Much more might be said on the question of the validation of 
reading tests and examinations if space permitted. It is also 
to be regretted that a few comments on the validation of other 
elementary school subjects cannot be added. For a rather 
complete account of validation methods on a larger scale, the  
-P-A-G-E-37
  CRITERIA OF A GOOD EXAMINATION 27 
reader is referred to the Manual of Directions for The Stanford 
Achievement Test,* which contains descriptions of the valida- 
tion of tests in reading, arithmetic, language usage, spelling, 
nature study and science, history and literature, etc. As has 
been pointed out before, informal drills, tests, and examinations 
need not be subjected to such strict validation as that reported 
for the Stanford Achievement Test or other good standardized 
educational tests. 
Before passing to the second of our main criteria of a good 
examination, viz., reliability, it may be worth while to point 
out the mutually complementary relations of the informal 
examination and the fully standardized educational test. There 
is some danger that the reader will gain the impression from 
these pages that the author is unfriendly toward the standard- 
ized test. This is quite the reverse of the truth. In fact, he 
would urge the use of standard tests at least as frequently 
as once or twice a year in all subjects where good tests are 
available. 
The informal examination, however, offers the opportunity 
to supplement the standard test on those skills and abilities 
which are not provided for in existing tests (and there are 
many such) for purposes of measurement. It is also more use- 
ful for instructional and drill purposes. It does often happen 
in certain school subjects that very excellent teaching does not 
result in large gains on the standard tests simply because the 
tests do not cover the subject as actually taught in the schools. 
Skillful teachers frequently can demonstrate teaching successes 
by informal testing methods where the standard test fails to 
be adequate. Rightly considered and used, the two types of 
measuring instruments involve no antagonisms. Detailed con- 
sideration of the values of standard tests is omitted here because 
‘such discussions are outside the projected scope of this book.

28 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
II. RELIABILITY 
Definition. By reliability is meant the degree to which a test 
or examination measures what it really does measure, not neces- 
sarily what it purports to measure. Reliability is synonymous 
with accuracy of measurement. In mathematical terms it is 
often identical with self-correlation, or the extent to which two 
samples of the same thing, e.g., ability in arithmetic, yield the 
same numerical scores. To use the example of the Courtis 
Arithmetic Tests again, it might be true that the Courtis Series 
B really does measure four fundamental arithmetical abilities 
in so far as it does measure anything, but at the same time it 
might not be a perfect measure of such abilities. That this is 
true can easily be shown by giving two equivalent forms of 
this test to the same pupils and comparing the scores. They 
will be found to show a general correspondence, far greater 
than chance alone will explain, with, nevertheless, differences 
large enough to be significant. That this will be true of neces- 
sity follows from the fact that we cannot obtain a complete 
measure of even such a simple ability as addition of columns 
of ten 3-place numbers, since we are forced to measure by means of 
a sampling of that ability rather than by a total measurement. 
In order to produce a perfect measure of this ability it would 
be necessary to have such a measure involve a very large or 
infinite number of such problems in order to eliminate in- 
numerable disturbing factors such as the state of health of 
the pupil, the amount of fatigue, differences in instruction, 
errors in reading the problem, errors in setting down answers, 
etc. By practical necessity, measurement is always sampling, 
and how extensive the sampling must be to give results that 
have a practical degree of reliability depends upon many things: 
the type of material, the difficulty of the material, the degree of 
accuracy required, the ease of scoring, the mechanical form of 
the test, and a host of other conditions which might be named. 
. Statistical Determination of Reliability. The usual method of 
stating the reliability of a test or examination is by means of

coefficients of correlation, or some derived measure. To obtain 
such coefficients at least two similar samplings of the same 
ability are required. The mathematical computations are 
somewhat complicated and will be reserved for fuller treatment 
in Chapter VI. The following set of data will serve, however, 
to illustrate the general logic of the situation.

Stated in mathematical terms, the reliability of this test of 
intelligence is about 0.95 (the “reliability coefficient” of this 
test), since this figure represents its “self-correlation” or, in 
other words, the correlation of two similar samplings or forms. 
Attention should be directed to the technical meaning of the 
term similar in this connection. Similar forms or samplings 
imply by definition certain conditions, viz.: two or more 
random samplings from homogeneous materials; approximate 
equality of difficulties, i.e., of the mean scores; and approximate 
equality of the variability of the scores in the two forms, e.g., 
equal standard deviations, etc. 
Reliability, in relation to the worth of a test or examination, 
may be thought of as a numerical statement of the accuracy of 
the examination for purposes of grading pupils. The degree of 
accuracy, stated in correlational terms, is somewhat as follows: 
Correlations of 0.00—0.50 are very low or insignificant. 
Correlations of 0.50—0.75 are fairly significant. 
Correlations of 0.75—0.95 are moderately high. 
Correlations of 0.95—1.00 are high. 
The same mathematical technique is easily applied to 
examinations proper provided certain conditions are present. 
If we wished to study the reliability of an examination in 
history, we might proceed as follows: 
1. Select a large number of questions about important topics 
presented in the work. Care in drawing these up will insure 
the validity of the examination in considerable measure. 
2. Draw two lots of ten questions each from these questions 
by some random process of selection. (The equality of the 
two lots can often be bettered by careful scrutiny leading to 
the interchanging of certain items.) 
3. Give lot I on one day and lot II the following day (or at 
some convenient but not too distant interval). 
4. Tabulate as in the example of Table I. 
5. Compute the correlation between the two sets of scores 
(see Chapter VI for the details of the method).
-P-A-G-E-41
  CRITERIA OF A GOOD EXAMINATION 31 
The reader need not trouble himself at this point about the 
mathematics of correlation, since we are at present interested 
in the logic of the situation and its bearing upon the adequacy 
of present examination methods. In Chapter III a number of 
such studies of the reliability coefficients of actual examinations 
are reported. It will be noted by reference to these that the 
reliability of such examinations is very much less as a general 
rule than the figure reported for the Terman scores in Table I. 
Repeated study has led to the conclusion that in general the 
reliability of the usual 10-question written examination does 
not run much higher than 0.50 to 0.60, rising above this for 
such objective subjects as spelling and arithmetic, and falling 
below very often for language and composition subjects. 
Causes of Unreliability. The causes of unreliability fall 
into several main groups: (a) subjectivity, (0) brevity, (c) 
coarse units, (d) nature of the function under measurement, 
and (e) actual variations in the pupils tested from time to time. 
The discussion of the first of these, subjectivity versus 
objectivity, will be reserved for section III of this chapter. 
Brevity refers to the adequacy of sampling. No special 
attention need be called to the fact that, other things being 
equal, that examination is most reliable which contains the 
most items, or in other words, provides the widest and most 
adequate sampling of the function under measurement. To 
choose a concrete case, it can be shown that if a spelling list 
which contains twenty words has a reliability coefficient of 
0.40, 100 words of the same type and same degree of difficulty 
will have a reliability of approximately 0.77. The mathe- 
matical basis of this estimate will be presented later. As a 
pure matter of limits, the reliability will be zero if zero test 
items or elements are given, and will approach 1.00 as the 
number of elements is increased without limit. That an exam- 
ination of ten questions, or worse still, five questions—a practice 
by no means uncommon—is a very small sampling is evident, 
and it constitutes one of the main sources of unreliability. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
32 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
Coupled closely with the question of the extent of the sam- 
pling is the matter of coarseness of test elements or units. The 
difficulty of accurate scoring of an examination paper increases 
directly with the size of the units. In a ten-question set, an 
error in scoring on the part of the teacher or an error in inter- 
pretation of the question on the part of the pupil deducts ten 
per cent of the total possible score. With five questions this 
situation is all the more aggravated. An unfair question or a 
poorly stated question introduces a large variable element in 
the total score. A concrete example will make this clear. The 
following question actually occurred as one of five questions 
asked in an examination in physiology: 
Question: Trace the process of the complete digestion of food from 
the time it enters the mouth until the waste products are eliminated 
from the intestines. 
Since five questions were given, this question was presumably 
to be graded on a scale of from zero to twenty points. The 
reader can imagine the variety of answers which might be 
given. Compare the preceding form with the following com- 
pletion exercise which calls for the same facts, the scoring being 
purposely broken into twenty units which can be scored as 
right or wrong, and each correct completion be given one point 
of credit. The blanks have been filled in with suitable answers 
but of course would not be in the pupils’ examination. 
The mouth is concerned with digestion in two ways: first, the 
grinding action of the _..%%/__, and, second, the chemical action of 
the enzyme - alin which acts on..s@7ees_ changing them into

known as....%%__.. The waste materials collect in the /7¢__. 
_intestin€_and pass on out. If this waste material is not rapidly cleared 
isons are formed which cause disease.     
That the scoring of the second form of the question is reason- 
ably objective and also in convenient units need not be argued. 
An error in interpretation or scoring is of minor importance in 
the total score. The mechanical form of the test is conducive 
to clear thinking on the part of the pupil and ease of reading on 
the part of the scorer. A stencil can be made in five minutes 
which will reduce by at least three-fourths the time needed 
for scoring. The ease or difficulty of the task can be varied 
at will by increasing or decreasing the number of blanks. The 
only important disadvantages of this form of the questions are 
those of the additional time of preparation of the questions and 
the necessity of mimeographed sheets. Neither of these is a 
serious limitation in comparison with the increased accuracy. 
The reader should note the following important fact about 
the second form of the question on digestion: viz., the scoring 
unit is each separate blank, with a total number of twenty scoring 
units for the question, in comparison with the first statement 
where the scoring units are gross, not specified, and left to the 
arbitrary choice of the scorer. The psychological advantage of 
the small unit over the large unit must result in increased re- 
liability of the scoring. 
The last of the four causes of unreliability is not so clearly 
understood as the preceding ones. It is a fact that workers in 
the construction of educational tests or other measuring devices 
are likely to be brought to the realization that some types of 
subject-matter are very refractory to reliable use for purposes 
of measurement. A notable case is language and grammar. 
Whether this is due to present teaching practices or to inherent 
peculiarities of such materials is not known. | Questions like

  34 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
the following are less reliable per unit of time or unit of numbers 
given than would be true of similar questions in the fields of 
geography, history, or literature. 
1. The man B1V6 ne the rubber ball. gave 
2, 1° him do it. seen 
3. The vase was on on the table. 
The cause for this may be found in the fact that the school (in 
its teaching) is opposed by the current usage of the home and 
outside life. The remedy will be found by experience as we 
discover by careful study exactly how much material of the 
various types is needed to provide an adequate testing. In 
general, very little is known about the relative unreliabilities 
of the subject-matter of the various school subjects for purposes 
of measurement when tests or examinations of equal lengths 
are compared. Equal lengths would involve equality of actual 
working times for the examinations in the different subjects, 
rather than equal numbers of questions, since questions vary 
greatly in scope and importance. 
II. OBJECTIVITY 
The example chosen from the physiology examination which 
was discussed above serves very nicely as an introduction to 
the question of objectivity versus subjectivity in examination 
construction. We can define objectivity as the degree to which 
the personal element or judgment is eliminated in the scoring of 
the answers. In considerable measure this is a sheer matter of 
the mechanical construction of the examination. The two 
statements of the question on digestion given above cover prac- 
tically the same scope, but with the important difference that 
in the second form it is possible to specify the correct answers 
with such definiteness that little or nothing is left to the personal
-P-A-G-E-45
CRITERIA OF A GOOD EXAMINATION 35 
judgment of the reader of the paper. Further examples of 
objective structure of examination questions are given in 
Chapters IV and V. 
Objectivity tends toward reliability through the reduction of 
the sources of variability, not only in the answers of the pupils, 
but also in the standards of the scorer. Perfect objectivity, in 
the sense used here, is a goal easy of attainment in most school 
subjects. A few subjects like literature and composition offer 
great difficulties, although improvements in the present prac- 
tices can be made with a little ingenuity on the part of the 
teacher. Spelling is largely objective, as is arithmetic, except 
for errors due to illegibility of writing and carelessness on the 
part of the reader. The completion exercise is ordinarily not 
completely objective. True-false and multiple-choice questions 
can be made entirely so as shown by the following samples: 
1. The largest state in the union is California Texas 
Maine Pennsylvania Wyoming. [Multiple-choice] 
2. The Revolutionary War began in 1812. True False [True-false] 
3. “Snowbound” was written Dy... [Completion] 
Objectivity is a prime requirement of a good examination and 
must not be sacrificed in the interests of the saving of a few 
minutes of time and thought on the part of the teacher. Care- 
lessness of examination construction encourages carelessness in 
pupils’ answers. A few trials will convince most teachers that 
the additional time required to construct an objective examina- 
tion is more than saved in the economy of time needed for 
grading the papers, with the further advantage that examina- 
tion construction is raised to a dignified position of a task 
challenging the best thought and interest of the teacher rather 
than a dreaded and perfunctory duty. 
IV. EASE OF ADMINISTRATION AND SCORING 
Waiving the question of the admittedly greater difficulty of 
constructing the newer types of examinations, the only other
-P-A-G-E-46
36 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
disadvantage is that of the necessity that such be mimeo- 
graphed or printed. The increased ease of scoring calls for no 
additional comment except to point out that scoring can be 
done by clerical workers without previous experience or train- 
ing. In some cases, pupils can be used successfully for this 
task. Even where the teacher must do the grading of the 
papers, the task is economically and mechanically carried out. 
This is a conserving of nervous energy and largely obviates the 
tendency to slight the job under the press of circumstances. 
The administration of objective examinations is no more 
difficult than that of the traditional type. The form of the 
examination is more likely to challenge the interest of the pupils. 
by virtue of the shifting of the attention away from the mechan- 
ical labor of writing down lengthy statements, thus allowing 
increased opportunity for the exercise of undivided thought to 
the answers. The scope of the examination is considerably 
increased with the consequent advantage of a wider and more 
adequate sampling of the subject-matter. All of these con- 
ditions combine to increase the statistical reliability of the 
examination for a stated time unit. 
V. STANDARDS 
The question of standards or norms is not involved in the 
technique of written examinations proper. Norms are more or 
less essential to standard educational tests, although even here 
the reputed usefulness of such standards has probably been 
greatly over-emphasized. Teachers can gradually accumulate 
rough norms for examinations by repeating the same examina- 
tions from year to year. Certain gains are to be had from this 
practice, although it does not enlarge the usefulness of examina- 
tions in any very fundamental way. Examinations are prim- 
arily measuring instruments, it should be repeated. Measure- 
ment is attained in a very real and useful sense when certain 
conditions are met even in the total absence of norms. Meas-
-P-A-G-E-47
  
CRITERIA OF A GOOD EXAMINATION 37 
urement, for educational purposes, is of two sorts: measurement 
within the group, and measurement without the group. Norms 
serve the second purpose; i.e., they permit comparisons with 
other groups, schools, classes, ete. Ordinary written examina- 
tions need concern themselves only with measurement within 
the group. In this sense a pupil can fairly be said to have 
been measured when he has been correctly spaced along a scale of 
merit in such a way that his relative achievement with respect 
to the other members of the group has been reliably portrayed. 
That the units of the scale are arbitrary is of no consequence; 
the units of all measuring devices, whether physical or mental, 
are just as arbitrary. Giving exact significance and meaning 
to scale units is a pure matter of definition after all. That this 
can be done for educational measurements is shown by standard- 
ized educational tests which do provide defined units by virtue 
of their norms. This property of the examination is properly 
left to the standard test and need not be assumed by the 
examination. The good examination is at hand when the 
margin of error in an individual pupil’s score is reduced to as 
small a minimum as is consistent with the practical demands 
of educational practice. 
SUMMARY 
1. A good examination must be shown to possess validity; i.e., 
it must measure what it is really intended to measure. 
2. The validity of an examination must be assured through experi- 
mental studies, judgments of competent persons, analysis of textbooks 
and courses of study, or similar outside criteria. 
3. Examinations must be reliable; i.e., they must measure accu- 
rately and consistently. 
4, Wide samplings of a school subject must be involved in the exam- 
ination if it is to be fair to the pupil, since measurement at best is far 
from complete. The ordinary five or ten question examination almost 
invariably falls down at this point. 
5. Reliability is easily subjected to more or less exact mathematical 
and quantitative statement by means of correlation methods.
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
6. The units of measurement are far too coarse for accuracy in the 
traditional examination. Fine scoring units decrease the personal 
equation or subjectivity in marking the papers. 
7. The newer types of examinations which have been proposed are 
superior in their objectivity to the ordinary examination. The true- 
false, multiple-choice, and matching exercises eliminate all need for 
subjective judgments in scoring and lend themselves to rapid scoring 
by means of stencils and cheap clerical help. 
8. The need for standards of performance has been generally over- 
emphasized as a result of the influence of the educational testing move- 
ment. The prime need of a good examination is that of spacing the 
pupils of a class upon a scale of merit in an accurate manner, rather 
than reference to a “norm” based on an outside group. Where such 
reference to a norm is essential, the standardized test should be em- 
ployed. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Write out at least three definitions of validity as applied to tests 
and examinations. 
2. Explain the statement: Validity is specific, but reliability is 
general. 
3. Explain the statement: Validity is chiefly a qualitative concept 
and reliability is chiefly a quantitative idea. 
4. Arrange the methods of validation listed in this chapter in the 
order of importance and justify your arrangement. 
5. Write a definition of the term criterion as used in this book. 
6. Explain in some detail how you would proceed to determine 
experimentally the percentage of pupils passing or failing the items 
of a test at each successive age or grade level. 
7. Can you add any new items to the Horn-McBroom analysis of 
silent reading quoted in this chapter? 
8. Make up a vocabulary test of 10-25 words using the Thorndike 
Word Book. Follow the method described in this chapter and list 
the frequency values under each word used. 
9. Make a sentence-vocabulary test of 10-25 sentences from the list 
of words common to the Thorndike, Horn, Packer, and Packer studies 
of children’s vocabularies.

  CHAPTER III 
SOURCES OF ERROR IN WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS 
The Problem. Attention has already been called to several 
sources of error in the traditional written examination. We 
shall now examine the experimental evidence upon which the 
criticisms of such examinations are based. Before undertaking 
the review of this evidence, however, it should be noted that 
the general problem can be broken up into two special problems 
for the sake of convenience. 
We must recognize two general kinds of errors, or sources of 
unreliability, to use the technical term, viz., (1) unreliability 
due to limited sampling, and (2) unreliability due to subjectivity 
of scoring. 
The first type of unreliability or error is always present to 
greater or less degree in all examinations, standard tests, or 
other measuring devices.’ ‘It arises from the fact that any 
educational measurement is always a partial one, i.e., a sampling 
of an ability, rather than a complete measurement of that 
ability. The second kind of error is sometimes absent, but is 
generally present to a marked degree. The standard intelli- 
gence examinations and many of the better educational tests 
are practically free from error of this kind. The same tends to 
be true to a fair degree in the case of spelling exercises, and to a 
lesser extent of examples in arithmetic. 
We can illustrate unreliability due to limited sampling very 
easily with the following lists of spelling scores. Let us assume 
that the teacher of a sixth grade undertakes to measure the 
spelling abilities of her pupils. To do this she draws ten words 
”,
-P-A-G-E-51
SOURCES OF ERROR IN EXAMINATIONS 41 
from the sixth-grade list of the Iowa Spelling Scales* which are of 
difficulties 49 per cent to 51 per cent, averaging 50 per cent. 
Such a selection will guarantee that, on the average, sixth-grade 
children can spell 50 per cent of these words correctly; i.e., the 
average sixth-grade child will spell five correctly and misspell 
the remaining five. Now, it is evident that ten words represent 
a very small sampling of the ability of any child to spell; in 
fact, they are entirely inadequate to measure any single pupil, 
although they might suffice for a rough measurement of an 
entire class or a whole school system. Just how inadequate, 
ie., unreliable, this sampling is could be determined in a rela- 
tively simple way by drawing a second list of ten words from 
the same difficulties of the Iowa Spelling Scales and giving both 
sets of ten to the same pupils. Two such sets are given here.

Since several hundred pupils spelled each word in each grade 
list in the experiments used to obtain the percentage values of 
the words, we can assume that the average sixth-grade spelling 
accuracy is approximately 5.0 for either Set A or Set B. But 
- what about the scores of each individual pupil? Will each 
sixth-grade pupil earn exactly the same score on Set B as he 
does on Set A? Obviously not. Results like those on the next 
page will be the rule.

Can either list be accepted as reliable? There is no way of 
answering these questions directly, except to increase the 
number of words used until the total number is large enough so 
that the fluctuations from list to list no longer are great enough 
to be of practical consequence. Just when this point is reached 
is a matter of the accuracy desired; errors of considerable size 
will occur at times even if a hundred to two hundred words are 
given. A more precise statement of the degree of reliability 
of ten such words could be obtained by correlating the two sets 
of scores given above as was done for the intelligence test 
scores given in Table I, of Chapter II. The correlation of the 
two sets of spelling scores is actually 0.87. This figure may be 
called the “reliability coefficient” of either Set A or Set B. 
Returning to the question of the type of unreliability in- 
volved in the use of such a 10-word list of words to be spelled, 
it is evident that we are dealing with errors of the first type, 
ie., errors due to limited sampling. Errors due to subjectivity 
are very little involved except as they arise due to haste in 
correction by the teacher or illegible writing on the part of the 
pupil. With care these can be reduced to an inconsequential 
amount. Spelling represents the most objective of the abili-
-P-A-G-E-53

ties involved in the elementary school subjects, and has been 
chosen as an illustration for this reason. 
Bearing in mind that errors of sampling are always present 
in all kinds of tests and examinations, and that measurement 
is always partial and never complete, most of the school sub- 
jects involve in addition an even more serious sort of error— 
that of subjectivity. Spelling, as we have seen, may be 
relatively free from this source of unreliability, since correctness 
is determined by the dictionary, and subjectivity reduces to a 
matter of legibility. Arithmetic involves subjective errors 
to a somewhat greater extent, the other subjects following in 
order, with composition and literature toward the extreme limit 
of lack of objectivity. In some of these subjects the errors due 
to subjectivity might at times be even larger in magnitude than 
those due to sampling. 
To choose an illustration, let us examine the following 
answers to the question stated. The question is taken from 
an actual examination in geography given during February, 
| 1923, and the replies are quoted verbatim. 
Quesstion: (a) Why should the New England farmers give much 
attention to market gardening and poultry raising? (b) What is 
their greatest market? 
Answer 1: The New England farmers should give attention to 
truck gardening because the farms are all small and hilly and Gardening 
is about the only things they can raise. They can raise poultry 
because they pay very much attention to it. They depend very 
much on it. 
ANswEr 2: The new England farmers should give so much atten- 
tion to the market because so they could learn how to raise different 
things The greatest market of theirs is corn mostly. 
Answer 8: Poultry raising, and gardening is the main industries 
of New England. The climate is favorable and the farms are small 
and they raise Poultry and Vegetables and take them to their greatest 
market. Their greatest market is Boston. 
Certain further details about these replies will doubtless be 
of interest to the reader. The examination was a uniform

county examination in one of the middle-western states of 
good educational standards. The scoring was done by ap- 
pointed and disinterested persons and not by the regular 
teachers. The three replies quoted are all from the same 
seventh-grade class, the papers being selected to show one of 
the best, one of the poorest, and one of the mediocre ones of 
the whole lot. Five such questions were given, and the scoring 
was done on a basis of twenty points per question. The three 
questions quoted received these marks: 
ANnswWER 1. 15 points out of a possible 20 points. 
Answer 2. 10 points out of a possible 20 points. 
ANSWER 3. 20 points out of a possible 20 points. 
It will prove instructive for each reader to grade these same 
responses upon the basis used above. The author has ven- 
tured to do this, and for the sake of argument has assigned the 
grades 8, 0, and 17, respectively, to the answers. His reasons 
are roughly as follows: In the case of Answer 1, part (b) 
is omitted completely and poor verbal statement and possible 
incompleteness remove two additional points. Answer 2 in- 
volves little or no coherence of ideas or understanding of the 
question. Answer 3 is a fair statement, but it ignores any 
reference to the ruggedness and the relative infertility of the 
land. 
That the reader will not agree with the author’s markings 1s 
also to be expected. The author’s grades are inserted for that 
purpose, such disagreements proving the point at issue. It 
cannot be asserted as proved that the original gradings are in 
error. What can be said is that two more or less competent 
persons are not in agreement after considering the actual state- 
ments. If the reader also disagrees with either set of marks, 
as is sure to be the case, the truth is all the more clouded. The 
only possible approach to the approximate truth would have 
to be obtained through the use of the average of a very large

  SOURCES OF ERROR IN EXAMINATIONS 45 
number of independent gradings. This is not a practical 
solution of the difficulty. 
Many more equally striking examples might be drawn from 
the thousand or more papers which the writer has recently 
gathered from a variety of schools and localities. The examples 
quoted above are not at all extreme cases as far as the mass of 
materials permits one to judge. But enough has been said to 
throw the question of objectivity vs. subjectivity of scoring 
into bold relief as a serious source of error almost universally 
present to a dangerous extent in the traditional written examina- 
tion. No practicable increase in the time devoted to final 
examinations of this type would eliminate errors of this nature 
to a satisfactory extent. Radical changes of the form of 
questioning must be the solution. 
Previous Investigations. There is nothing new in the con- 
clusions reached above. Since about the year 1900 a great 
many educational workers have been devoting thought and 
experimentation to these questions. A number of important 
and extensive studies have appeared, notably those by Johnson, 
Kelly, Miles, Smith, Starch, Meyer, Dearborn, ‘and Gray. 
Many others, also, are worthy of brief reviews for the sake of 
emphasis. That these critical studies of the fallibility of teach- 
ers’ marks and grades have borne so little fruit is not evidence 
that they do not portray the real facts of the situation, but is 
rather to be charged to the fact that constructive suggestions 
have not usually been put forth. The attitude has been too 
negative to be of the greatest value to the schools. The devel- 
opment of the technique of objective examination methods 
is certain to foster constructive thinking which will lead to 
the correction of many of the sources of error in written 
examinations. 
One of the important sources of error in the assignment of 
marks arises from the fact that each teacher has her own standard 
of values. The following data are quoted from Kelly’s arrange-

That the standards of these various departments show wide 
variations needs no comment. English teachers fail almost 
three times as many pupils as do domestic science teachers and 
give but half as many A’s. A pupil’s chance of getting an A 
in German is approximately twice as great as his getting one in 
French. 
The same facts are evident in Table III which presents the 
findings of the author for the University of Oregon High School, 
Eugene, Oregon. 
A total of 659 separate grades or marks are involved. P. T. 
refers to the grades of all practice teachers grouped together. 
The totals include regular and practice teachers. The school 
standards were adopted by the faculty as the official grading 
plan of the school.

The grades as a whole are badly skewed upwards despite 
the existence of a school standard which thus defined the marks: 
A to represent the upper 6% of the pupils, approximately, 
B to represent the next 25% of the pupils, approximately, 
C to represent the middle 35%-40% of the pupils, approximately, 
D to represent the next 25% of the pupils, approximately, 
E to represent the lowest 6% of the pupils, approximately. 
Teacher £ illustrates an interesting situation. At the pre- 
vious report period, each teacher’s grade distribution together 
with a graph had been posted in the faculty room. This 
teacher’s summary showed more than 50 per cent of A grades 
given. In the effort to overcome this situation, this teacher 
forced down the number of A’s to a point well below every 
other teacher in the school, apparently by the very simple 
expedient of changing the A’s to B’s, a solution which didn’t 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
help matters greatly for the distribution taken in its entirety! 
Could one take these grade -distributions at face value, he 
could not but be impressed with the truly wonderful efficiency 
of a school where more than 85 per cent of the pupils earned 
either A’s or B’s. Kelly ! (after extensive study of prevailing 
marking systems) has summarized his conclusions in these 
words: 
A given grade or mark means many widely different things to 
different teachers when they are rating pupils for promotion. As 
measured by the achievement of the several school groups in their 
later work this difference amounts in some cases to as much as the 
difference between a G (good) and F— (fair minus) in elementary 
schools where the basis of marking includes only the steps P, F, G, 
and HZ. In high schools there is enough difference between the stand- 
ards of schools as wholes that, measured by the achievement of the 
school groups in later school work, a mark of 70 in one school means 
more than a mark of 81 in another school having the same passing 
standard by points. Within the high school and within the college 
the percentage of pupils which the various instructors fail as a common 
practice extending over several years varies from 0 to 28, or more. 
The conclusion reached by Kelly is entirely in harmony with 
the results of a series of investigations by Starch and Elliott? 
who submitted exact copies of the same examination paper to 
large numbers of teachers of the particular subjects represented. 
Two of these studies have been selected as typical. Figure 1 
on the next page shows the marks assigned to the same paper 
by 142 teachers of English. Figure 2 shows a similar set of 
marks on a geometry paper which was assigned by 115 teachers 
of high-school mathematics. 
This work of Starch and Elliott established very definitely 
two things: first, that the marks assigned to the same paper by 
different teachers varied enormously in terms of the same per- 
centage scale; and second, that the variation among teachers’ 
marks was about as great for one school subject as another.

as English and history. Rather strangely it turned out that 
the English papers were graded with somewhat greater uni- 
formity than those in history and mathematics in this investi- 
gation. Later, Starch found that teachers within the same 
school show almost as great differences in their markings as do 
teachers selected from different schools. 
Miles* made a number of comparisons between the grades 
earned in the elementary schools and those obtained during the 
high-school courses of the same pupils. Pupils whose grade 
records were not complete for at least the last four grades of 
the elementary school and the first two years of high school 
were not included. He averaged all the elementary-school 
marks of 106 such pupils, doing likewise for the high-school

marks. The averages were 89.15 for the elementary grades 
and 82.49 for the high-school grades. Coefficients of corre- 
lation were computed between the marks given for different 
subjects and by different departments. The average correla- 
tion between the marks in fifteen of the elementary-school 
subjects was 0.57, and that between ten high-school subjects 
was 0.62. The average correlation between the grades in the 
elementary-school subjects and the high-school subjects was 
even lower, being about 0.45. The average elementary-school 
marks correlated 0.71 with the average high-school marks. 
The value of these data is greatly increased for purposes of 
evaluation of the traditional examination because they are 
invariably averages of the marks of several teachers, thus 
ironing out much of the error of the judgments of single persons. 
In spite of this we must conclude that both the average of the 
elementary-school grades and the average of the high-school 
records are very imperfect as criteria of school success, since 
they correlate no more than 0.71 with each other. Prediction 
of high-school success from the elementary-school record would 
involve at best very large errors. Such a basis of prediction is 
only 30 per cent better than chance.* The chief reason for 
such low correlations is to be found in the low reliability of 
both sets of marks, although part is to be explained upon the 
basis of genuine changes in the achievements of pupils from 
year to year and from grade to grade. 
Recent Investigations. In order to bring out certain addi- 
tional facts about the general problems of marks and examina- 
tions, the author has recently carried out a series of further 
studies along lines similar to those which have been described. 
The justifications for this repetitive work might be stated 
*It may readily be shown, statistically, that prediction based upon a correlation of 0.71 is only approximately 30 per cent, better than when the correlation is zero. In other words, 70 per cent of the error of peedieHon present at zero correlation still remains where 
ris equal to 0.71. The basis for this statement is to be found in the use of Kolley’s Coeffi- 
cient of Alienation, viz., k=\/1—72. The reader who is familiar with the formula for the 
standard error of estimate will recognize that the magnitude of the value of r is stated in 
terms of the per cent of reduction in the standard error of estimate over zero correlation 
asa base. The critical reader will do well to refer at this point to Kelley T. L., Statistical 
Method, The Macmillan Co., 1923, pages 172-4.

here. In the first place, most of the studies which have been 
reviewed in the preceding paragraphs are ten or more years 
old, and the situation may have improved greatly as the result 
of the spread of such knowledge. The second and more 
important reason is to be found in the fact that further an- 
alysis of these problems is now possible with our improved 
use of statistical methods. Specifically, it will contribute 
greatly to our clarity of thinking if we distinguish between 
the two types of unreliability suggested at the beginning of 
this chapter, viz., unreliability due to inadequate sampling, 
and unreliability due to subjectivity. We might add as well 
the factor of unreliability due to coarse grading units, but it 
will be simpler to treat this matter as a phase of the general 
question of sampling. 
In order to gather material for this purpose, a large number 
of final examination papers were collected for elementary- 
school subjects. These were sent to the author by persons 
unknown to him through the codperation of certain principals 
and superintendents. In this way all possible known sources 
of selection of such papers were eliminated. The teachers 
grading the papers and the teachers in charge of the classes 
represented were not personally known to the author or to 
any of the teachers employed in the regrading of the papers. 
Two series of these investigations will be reported here. 
EXxpERIMENTS—SERIES A 
1. Ten complete sets of final examination papers were 
drawn at random from a lot of a hundred or more of such sets, 
the only selection being that of insuring that the sets repre- 
sented several different elementary-school subjects, and further 
that each question had been separately graded. Whether 
this latter sort of selection resulted in any bias is unknown. 
It is true that a large percentage of the sets of papers were 
apparently graded upon the merit of the paper as a whole. 
If our practice resulted in any systematic selective influence,
-P-A-G-E-62
I 
52 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
it would seem that our choices would tend to retain those 
sets of papers which had been more carefully graded than the 
lot as a whole. 
2. Each set of papers was submitted to a committee of 
three experienced teachers. These teachers will be repre- 
sented in the subscripts of the correlation coefficients as 1, 
2,and 3. The notation for the original grading will invariably 
be the subscript 0. (See Table IV.) 
3. Teacher No. 1 of each committee then “broke” the marks 
on each paper into two chance halves by summing the points 
earned on the even-numbered and on the odd-numbered 
questions separately. These chance halves were then corre- 
lated. Table IV, column (c), under the notation rj;, shows 
these correlations. 
4. The coefficients from column (c), which are really the 
reliability coefficients of half of the examination, were corrected 
to approximately the reliability of the whole examination by 
means of Brown’s formula (the Spearman prophecy formula).* 
Teacher No. 1 then made a tabulation of all the marks on 
each paper, giving the names of the pupils and the total mark, 
etc., and then erased all of the original corrections and marks. 
5. Teachers No. 2 and No. 3 of each committee then 
graded the papers as carefully as possible and returned their 
marks to No. 1 of their committee who recorded these new 
marks on the tabulation sheets. The marks of teachers   
*Brown’s formula is commonly used for this purpose and is held to be mathematically sound. The estimates thus yielded will be approximately the same values as would have been obtained had the total mark of the papers been correlated with the marks on a second examination of the same length, type of materials, and approximate difficulty. The formula can be stated: and sep 
"nn=TEm—lyr 
Tnn is the correlation coefficient (reliability coefficient) which would be obtained if n forms of the obtained reliability designated r are used, or if the examination were increased ntimes in length. The solution for the first value in column (d) of Table IV is given here for purposes of explanation of the method.

The value for n is taken as 2 because the whole examination is two times as long as the chance halves (odds and evens) actually correlated.

  54 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
Examination of Table IV, particularly the averages of the 
columns, reveals several interesting situations. The correla- 
tions between the regradings are far from perfect, even in 
the cases of such subjects as arithmetic, where it would be 
expected that the agreement would be very close. The two 
sets of arithmetic papers show correlations between the grad- 
ings of different teachers in the neighborhood of 0.90, a figure 
which is far from representing high agreement, as is readily 
shown by applying the coefficient of alienation formula re- 
ferred to in the footnote on page 50. Correlations of 0.85 
to 0.95 mean agreements of from 50 per cent to 70 per cent in 
round numbers. Spelling makes a good showing and is the 
only subject which shows a satisfactory degree of objectivity. 
The disagreements in spelling are probably to be attributed to 
carelessness and illegibility and are of no practical consequence. 
The geography paper makes a very poor showing, and one could 
scarcely be criticized for branding the results of such an ex- 
amination as practically worthless for purposes of accurate 
measurement of the accomplishment of these pupils. Taken 
as a whole the results are very convincing evidence that sub- 
jectivity of grading is a serious element in our present examina- 
tions, and since it can be eliminated in practically every sub- 
ject represented, there can be very little defense put forward 
for this state of affairs. 
Certain of these examinations contained but five questions; 
ten questions being the maximum for any paper. Due to 
chance unfairness in the selection of questions, i.e., lack of 
high validity, and to coarse scoring units with consequent 
leeway for large differences of personal opinion as to merit, 
the net result is that, with one or two exceptions, these examina- 
tion papers have little value for purposes of discriminating 
more than the grossest differences in pupil abilities. Much 
more weight is to be attached to the values in column (d) than 
to those of the other columns, since these figures are rather 
exact quantitative statements of how accurate the examina-
-P-A-G-E-65
SOURCES OF ERROR IN EXAMINATIONS 55 
tions actually proved to be under the actual conditions in 
which they were given. The conclusion that the present essay- 
‘type of written examination is a very faulty measuring instrument 
is inescapable. The remedy is to be found in several direc- 
tions, as follows: 
1. In a wider sampling, and very possibly longer examinations. 
2. In increased objectivity, e.g., by the use of completion 
exercises, true-false and multiple-choice items, or matching 
exercises, etc. 
8. In finer scoring units, a situation which takes care of 
itself when the newer types of questions are used instead of 
the “Discuss this,” ‘State the,” and ‘What are” forms of 
questioning. 
The same facts are somewhat more simply brought out in 
the second series of experiments to be described. 
EXprERIMENTs—Series B 
The first experiment was that of submitting three answers 
to the same question in geography to about a hundred teach- 
ers for regrading. All three answers were taken from the 
papers of one class, those papers selected being the best, poor- 
est, and median papers. The pupils’ responses were copied 
verbatim and mimeographed, retaining allerrors. The instruc- 
tions to the teachers and the answers are reproduced below. 
Directions: Below are three actual answers to the question: 
Name and locate five of the largest cities of the United States and name 
their leading industries, exports, and imports. 
Grade each of the three answers on a scale of 0 to 20, according to 
your best judgment of its merit, 20 being an answer ordinarily accepted 
by teachers as entirely satisfactory, and 0 being an answer practically 
without discernible merit. 
ANSWER 1 
Five of the largest cities in the United States is Detroite. An export 
is Cars. And industry is Manufactoring. Chicago is an important city 
and an export is Manufactored and canned goods. An industry of Chicago 
is meate packing. New York is another important city. An industry of 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
N. Y. is manufactoring. An export of N. Y. is manufactored goods. 
Pittsburge is an important city of U.S. An export isiron ore. A industry 
of Pittsburge is manufactoring. Another important city of U. S. is New 
Orleans. An export of New Orleans is cotton. An industry of New Or- 
leans is manufactoring. 
ANSWER 2 
The five largest cities of the United States are (1) navada (2) Arkansas. 
The leading industry of navada is manufacture and the leading industry 
of Arkansas is agriculture. The leading imports are manufacturing mostly. 
Grade... ois 3. ote 
ANSWER 3 
The 5 largest cities of United States are New York, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Boston, San Fransisco. New York is in the State of New York. Chicago 
is in the State of Illinois. St. Louis in in the state of Missourri. Bostin 
is in the state of Mass. San Fransisco is in the state of California. New 
York is a manufacturing city. Chicago is noted for meat packing center. 
St. Louis is noted for manufacturing textile goods and iron goods. Boston 
is noted for manufacturing of textile and iron goods. San Fransisco is 
noted for the packing of fruit. New York exports iron goods and imports 
wool, cotton, and other raw materials. Chicago exports meat and hides 
and grain and imports food and grains. St. Louis exports manufactured 
products and imports raw materials. 
Table V on the next page summarizes the regradings of the 
three answers by 91 teachers. The facts illustrate several 
points previously brought out. In the first place, it is to be 
noted that the original grading in no case agrees at all closely 
with the average grades of the 91 teachers. The difference is 
from 2 to 5 points in each case. The 91 teachers show a wide 
variance of opinion about the merits of these three answers. 
Which set of marks is correct, the originals or the regradings? 
The only answer is to accept the average of the group as 
approximating the truth. Granting this for the moment, we 
find that the original mark of Answer 1 was about 5 points 
too high, and that for Answer 3 was about 4 points too low. 
What reason can be assigned for this situation? As far as

the facts presented in Table V go, it is impossible to answer 
this question satisfactorily. A probable explanation is to be 
found in the fact that Answer 1 was taken from a rather supe- 
rior paper, but Answer 3 was found in a decidedly inferior 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
paper, the papers taken as a whole. The original grader has 
undoubtedly been unconsciously influenced by these facts; 
thus tending to grade leniently a poor answer in an otherwise 
very good paper, and underestimating the value of a good 
answer which formed a part of an inferior paper. This same 
fact was evident many times in these studies of examination 
papers, and if space permitted, considerable statistical proof 
of the operation of such unconscious biases could be presented. 
Similarly, the existence of systematic tendencies for certain 
teachers to grade too leniently and for others to be too harsh 
in their judgments might be amply demonstrated by facts at 
hand. These phenomena are too well recognized by teachers, 
however, to require proof or comment. 
In a second experiment, three entire history papers taken 
from a seventh-grade class in American history were mimeo- 
graphed so as to preserve all spelling and grammatical errors, 
and as much of the mechanical form as was possible in the 
duplication. The papers were again the best, median, and 
poorest papers of the class. These were then regraded by 
115 teachers, independently. The original marks were, of 
course, not known to the group. Space does not permit the 
recording of either the questions or the copies submitted to 
the teachers. Table VI on the next page summarizes the facts 
of this experiment, which was similar in nature to those 
formerly reported by Starch and Elliott. 
Table VI would seem to show that the original grader of 
these papers was too tolerant in her standards, the composite 
judgments lowering all of the original marks by at least ten 
points. This illustrates the operation of systematic biases 
which have been asserted as a source of error. Marked varia- 
bility exists as before in the judgments of the 115 teachers as 
to the worth of these papers. In this case, however, the 
ranks of the papers remain the same as before, so that there

SOURCES OF ERROR IN EXAMINATIONS 61 
It may be objected that these experiments are unwarranted 
in view of the previous work which has been done in this 
direction. On the contrary, there are good reasons for re- 
peating the investigations of others. In the first place, our 
analysis has been carried out in greater detail in the attempt 
to distinguish a number of sources of unreliability in written 
examinations instead of being contented with picturing the 
general situation; for example, the separate réles of subjectivity 
and limited sampling have been differentiated. Attention 
has been drawn to the influence of coarse units and to sys- 
tematic biases operative in the grading of papers. Another 
fact that has been pointed out is that of the unconscious 
tendency to be influenced by the merit of the paper as a whole 
while evaluating the separate questions within the total 
examination paper. 
But there is a second reason why repetition has been profit- 
able, which must be pointed out here. The teachers used in 
the present grading experiments differed from those in the 
studies of Starch and Elliott, and others, in the fact that these 
teachers had just completed a critical examination of the pit-. 
falls in traditional examination methods and were aware of 
the major sources of error. That great variability and disa- 
greement in their judgments still remained is the best sort 
of proof that the subjective errors of examinations must be 
eliminated by recourse to some form of objective measuring 
instruments. The facts of the matter can be succinctly 
summed up in the statement that the sources of unreliability 
in our present essay-type of written examination are to be found 
in the fallibility of human judgments. Human judgment is 
faulty under the most favorable circumstances, and it is 
unwise to increase the margin of error by persistence in the 
use of types of examination which are mechanically opposed 
to the interests of reliable and objective measurement in the 
sense of the physical sciences. Just how great improvements 
can be made at this time and what direction these improve-

ments must take is the attempted task of the succeeding 
chapter. 
SUMMARY 
1. Examinations involve errors of two general kinds, viz., errors 
arising from limited sampling, and errors which are due to subject- 
ivity of scoring. 
2. Since educational measurement is always partial and never 
complete, errors due to limited sampling (short length) are often very 
great. The newer objective types lend themselves well to extensive 
testing of facts in relatively short time limits. 
3. With the exception of spelling, all of the ordinary school sub- 
jects involve the necessity of subjective judgments in marking the 
examination papers. Arithmetic is fairly objective, but grammar, 
history, geography, physiology, etc., allow enormous differences in 
scoring to arise even in the hands of competent teachers. 
4, Kelly, Johnson, Starch, Dearborn, Meyer, Gray, and others, 
have found the marks of teachers to vary widely on the same examina- 
tion paper, the range of marks assigned to the same paper often being 
as great as from twenty to ninety points. 
5. The percentages of A, B, C, D, etc., letter grades given by the 
several teachers in the same school, also show wide dissimilarities. 
The author found a range of from 9% to almost 50% in the number 
of A grades given by the teachers of a six-teacher school. This implies 
the existence of no definite universal standards in the minds of teachers 
even where the administrative officers of the school define the per- 
centages of letter grades to be given. 
6. Starch found that mathematics papers were practically as open 
to unreliable marking as the more subjective subjects like English 
and history. 
7. Recent investigations by the author seem to show that the large 
numbers of studies which have been published calling attention to the 
sources of error in marking examination papers have had little effect in 
improving conditions. It seems more advisable to attempt improve- 
ments by changing the type of the examination rather than by attempt- 
ing to refine the traditional methods. Human judgments are fallible 
at best, and improvement in marking essay-type examination papers 
can only take place within fairly narrow limits.

8. A sampling of ten sets of final examination papers given in the 
state of Iowa during the year 1923 showed an average reliability of 
but 0.57 for the traditional examination of five or ten discussion 
questions. 
9. Regradings of papers show agreements of less than fifty per cent 
perfect, even after teachers have had their attention drawn to the 
pitfalls to be avoided. 
10. The marks assigned by 91 teachers to the same question of a 
geography examination varied from two to twenty points as a total 
range of marks. The original mark was in error by at least five points 
in comparison with the average of the 91 teachers. 
11. Three history papers regraded by 115 teachers showed differ- 
ences in the marks assigned as great as thirty to sixty points on a 
scale of one hundred. The original gradings on these three papers were 
in error by ten to eighteen points as judged by the average markings 
of the 115 teachers. 
12. The regrading experiments showed clearly the existence of 
systematic biases in the markings of teachers. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. How can unreliability due to limited sampling be minimized? 
2. Arrange the following school subjects in the order of decreasing 
subjectivity of grading, according to your judgment: reading, spelling, 
grammar, arithmetic, composition, history, manual training, hand- 
writing, geography, and public speaking. 
3. Grade the three answers to the geography question discussed in 
this chapter. How do your marks compare with the judgment of the 
teacher who scored the examination originally? 
4. Choose either side of the proposition which follows, and present 
your arguments in defense of your position. Proposition: ‘The 
adoption and enforcement of a grading system requiring that a rigid 
percentage of each letter grade (A, B, C, D, etc.) be given by each 
teacher will eliminate most of the errors now prevalent in grading 
pupils, thus making radical changes in examination practices un- 
necessary.” 
5. List in summary form all of the sources of errors in written 
examinations which have been brought to light by experimental 
studies to date.

CHAPTER IV 
TYPES AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEWER 
OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 
Classification of Objective Examination Types. The main 
types of objective examinations which have been formulated 
and widely used to date fall naturally into this classification: 
I. Recall Types: 
(a) Simple recall questions. 
(6) Completion exercises. 
II. Recognition Types: 
(a) Multiple response. 
) (6) True-false. 
(c) Best answer. 
Ke (d) Matching exercises. 
~~~ (e) Identification. 
Certain general features and advantages of the newer exami- 
nation will become evident in the course of the description of 
the details of method in the following pages, but the critical and 
more technical matters will be deferred until Chapter V, when 
certain experimental findings will be presented. The present 
task is that of showing in some detail exactly how teachers can 
build objective examinations to fit the individual school 
situation. The suggestion that such examinations can be 
made to fit local needs, special types of teaching, etc., is made 
advisedly; this adaptability constituting one of the advan- 
tageous features of such examinations in comparison with 
the standardized scale or test. The latter are of necessity 
general and unadaptable to local school conditions. They are 
further often useful only at stated times during the school 
year, if the standards are to be used. The newer objective 
examination offers about the same latitude in its applicability 
as does the older essay type.

EXAMPLES OF OBJECTIVE EXAMINATION TYPES 
The choice of the particular form of examination to be em- 
ployed depends in part upon the school subject concerned, 
in part upon the length of examination needed, in part upon 
the reliability desired, and in part upon the preference of the 
teacher. In order to provide a more concrete basis for dis- 
cussion of certain further points, the following examples of 
informal objective @kamination types are given. All of these 
have been made up by teachers, and none have been sub- 
jected to any sort of standardization beyond the stage of re- 
finement by the use of personal judgments of merit. They are 
not offered as ideal illustrations; on the contrary, most of the 
readers of this chapter will find occasion to criticize many 
individual items as to general worth. Only a small portion of 
each examination will be quoted.

      The examination in English literature quoted above is not 
without its faults, but it is at least suggestive of many possi- 
bilities. It is far from a pure test of memorization of facts, 
although it is primarily intended to measure the factual as- 
pects of the subject. 
But teachers of literature may possibly raise objection to 
even such a degree of emphasis on formal facts. That ex- 
aminations of the newer types need not degenerate into pure 
memory work can easily be shown. The best-answer and 
true-false types of items are especially well adapted to thought 
questions. Indeed, there is no ultimate distinction between 
memory and thought questions in actual practice, since an 
item which is a good thought-provoking question on the 
fourth-grade level becomes a pure matter of memory at the 
higher-grade levels. In order to show how the true-false 
method can be applied to the teaching of English literature

Below are two passages from Macbeth with blank spaces ia front of 
them. In each of these spaces put the number of the feeling most 
strongly expressed in that passage before which the space stands. 
It is possible for a passage of poetry to express more than one feeling, 
but try to get the dominant feeling. 
Ase etee O, I could play the woman with mine eyes, 
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, 
Cut short all intermission. Front to front 
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; 
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, 
Heaven forgive him too!

There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here,

And wish the estate of the world were now undone. 
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack! 
At least we’ll die with harness on our back. 
The following examination on Pilgrim’s Progress has also 
proved very satisfactory.* 
EXAMINATION ON Pingrim’s PRoGRESS 
I. Pilgrim’s Progress is an allegory. In it different situations 
that arise represent certain experiences that people go through. 
Bunyan had in mind for the most part religious experiences, but his 
allegory can represent many experiences that are not particularly 
religious in their nature. Here are four parts of Pilgrim’s Progress 
numbered from 1 to 4: 
1. The Slough of Despond 3. Vanity Fair 
2. The Chained Lions 4. Doubting Castle 
Here are six incidents in everyday life, with a blank space in front 
of each. Four of these can be taken as illustrations of the four parts 
of Pilgrim’s Progress just mentioned. Each one of these four incidents 
illustrates one and only one of the four parts listed. The other two 
incidents do not illustrate any of the four. In the blank space in 
front of four of the incidents put the number of the part of Pilgrim’s 
Progress which you think it illustrates.

  Mark an X in the blank space in front of these two.

you. Two of them are from Bunyan’s works. If you have any 
understanding of Bunyan’s style, you should be able to pick these 
passages out without difficulty since they are quite like what he uses 
in Pilgrim’s Progress and since the other four are quite unlike any- 
thing he ever wrote. 
Put an X in the blank space in front of each of the two passages 
that you think are taken from the works of Bunyan. 
That affluence and power, advantages extrinsic and adventi-

reverberated—everlasting farewells! and again and yet again

If a man indulge in murder, he comes very soon to think little 
of robbing; and from robbing he comes to drinking and Sabbath 
breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination. Many

he thought little of at the time.

The foregoing examinations on Macbeth and Pilgrim’s 
Progress show some of the possibilities of rising above the 
purely factual examination in the field of literature. A great 
deal more can be done. Such aspects of literature as poetic 
feeling, beauty of language, beauty of phrasing, poetic inspira- 
tion, etc., are not totally beyond objective examination meth- 
ods, even at the present time. In order to suggest possible 
methods of attack on these more subtle qualities in English, 
the following extracts from a preliminary standard test in 
English literature are quoted. These materials have actually 
been tried out on high-school pupils, and apart from proving 
to be rather too difficult in places, have shown themselves 
to possess definite promise. The three tests reproduced here 
form a part of a battery of ten such tests devised (for ex- 
perimental purposes) by Dr. M. F. Carpenter and the author.

Many additional examples might be reproduced here if 
space permitted, but enough types have probably been de- 
scribed for present purposes. It will be more profitable to 
proceed to the formulation of some general rules for objective 
examination construction. 
Tue ConstRUCTION OF OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 
Detailed rules of procedure in the construction of an ob- 
jective examination which would possess general utility can 
hardly be formulated. The type of questions must be decided 
upon the basis of such facts as the school subject concerned, the 
purposes of the examination, the length and reliability of the 
proposed examination, preferences of teachers and pupils,
-P-A-G-E-106
96 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
the time available for the examination, whether factual knowl- 
edge or thinking is to be tested, etc. A few general rules 
which may prove helpful are given below in topical form. 
Steps in the Building of an Objective Examination. I. De- 
cide upon the exact scope of the proposed examination. Make 
a list of the most important topics falling within the limits 
selected. These topics can be left in rather general form at 
this stage of the examination. 
II. Take the topics selected and think out very carefully 
the most significant facts falling under each topic. Keep 
asking yourself questions like the following: “If I can ask 
but one thing about this topic, what should it be?” or “If I 
can ask but three things about this topic, what should these 
three questions be?”’ 
III. To the best of your ability arrange the questions falling 
under each topic in the order of their importance. This will 
enable you later to cut the total number down to practicable 
limits. It is wise, however, to make from fifty to one hundred 
per cent more questions than can be included in your final 
selections in order that only the best shall be selected for the 
finalform. At this stage the questions may be written out in 
any convenient form, to be converted later into whatever type 
of question seems best fitted for the purpose. 
IV. Turn the questions into multiple-response, true-false, 
best-answer, recall-form, etc., according to your judgment 
as to the most appropriate form for the materials in hand. 
Certain items lend themselves easily to one form, which would 
suffer violent distortion in being forced into another form. 
The true-false form offers the greatest latitude, perhaps, in 
its applications, and can often be employed where certain 
other forms are unpromising. Several types of questions can 
be employed in the same examination. This often has the 
advantage of preventing monotony with consequent loss of 
interest. After the items are formulated, they can be grouped 
in such a way that all items of the same mechanical type are 
thrown into the same exercise. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
BUILDING OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 97 
V. Decide upon the length of the test or examination. This 
generally reduces to a question of the amount of time available 
and the proposed reliability. The number of items which 
can be covered by a pupil in a unit of time ean be stated ap- 
proximately for pupils of given ages and grades. A few recom- 
mendations based upon the author’s experience are given here. 
(a) High-school or college students and adults: 
Recall type 4 to 8 items per minute. 
Recognition type 6 to 10 items per minute. 
True-false type 10 to 15 items per minute. 
(6) Elementary-school pupils: 
Recall type 3 to 5 items per minute. 
Recognition type 4 to 6 items per minute. 
True-false type 5 to 8 items per minute. 
These recommendations are at best approximate and depend 
greatly upon the subject-matter and degree of difficulty of the 
items. The rules are based upon the use of items of such diffi- 
culty that the average pupil will get about half of the items 
attempted correct, and the time limits are arranged so that 
about ninety per cent of all the pupils will have opportunity 
to attempt every item. It is further assumed that responses 
are to be indicated by the writing of a single word or short 
phrases, or by underscoring, or by some similar rapid device. 
If much writing is to be done by the pupils in answering, the 
number of items per unit of time must be correspondingly 
reduced. True-false examinations are in general not very 
reliable unless one hundred or more questions are included. 
Good results follow with the other types for examinations of 
fifty or more items, with the exception of the recall type which 
may require increased length in certain cases where sub- 
jectivity enters to a greater extent than in most of these ex- 
amination methods. More exact data on these points will be 
given in Chapter V. 
VI. After the fixing of the length of the examination in 
terms of the time available, go through the items and decide
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
how many should be selected under each of the topics originally 
designated. Since the items have already been arranged in 
rough order of merit, the final selections are easily made. It 
is very helpful in this connection to build up a rough table of 
organization which states the approximate percentage of the 
entire examination which should be given over to each topic. 
This will prevent over-weighting the test with facts of a certain 
type, e.g., dates in history or works of authors in literature, 
etc. Such a practice will prove very instructive to many 
teachers, who will discover the extent to which unconscious 
biases and hobbies have entered into the construction of past 
examinations. It also results in centering attention on the 
essentials of subject-matter and specific objectives in teaching. 
VII. Arrange the items in approximate order of difficulty 
according to your best judgment, placing the most difficult 
questions last. This tends to prevent pupils from “hanging up” 
on a hard question at the outset with consequent waste of 
time. The reliability of examinations is often materially bet- 
tered by this simple device. 
VIII. If it is desirable to check up on the reliability of the 
examination by statistical means, a further recommendation 
may be offered which will simplify this process with great 
saving of time and labor. Chapter VI presents the mathe- 
matical detail of this step. If the total examination is broken 
into two chance halves after Step VII has been carried out, 
scores on the two halves can be obtained directly without re- 
scoring of the examination. To do this, place the items num- 
bered in order of increasing difficulty in two forms as follows: 
Form A Form B 
2 
3 
6 
7 
10 
ll 
Ete. wOnonarke ee
-P-A-G-E-109
  BUILDING OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 99 
It should be noted that the above scheme purposely provides 
that each form shall contain as many even-numbered as odd- 
numbered items. (These designations are based upon the 
numbering of step VII.) If in Form A should be given all of 
the odd- and in Form B all of the even-numbered items, the 
result would be that Form A would tend to be markedly easier 
than Form B since each item is supposedly somewhat easier 
than its paired item in Form B. The scores for each half of 
the test are directly obtainable after scoring, and the total 
score is the sum of the two forms. The scores on the two 
forms are immediately ready for correlation purposes. 
For the teacher who possesses knowledge of -correlation 
methods, it will be profitable to extend her study of the merits 
of the examination construction to cover the calculation of the 
correlation between the two half-forms, i.e., the reliability 
coefficient of such half-forms. The reliability coefficient of 
the entire examination can be obtained by the use of ‘“Brown’s 
formula” by setting n equal to 2 and solving. Thus, if the 
reliability coefficient of two chance halves of a true-false test 
in American history is 0.69, substitution in the formula, 
nr 2xX.69 
"ar ite-ie 
the reliability of the whole examination. The value 0.82 
can also be read directly from Table XVIII on page 137. 
It will probably be unwise to attempt more specific direc- 
tions for the actual building of these examinations. Ex- 
perience here, as elsewhere, rapidly gives the teacher increased 
facility in the construction and selection of items. The actual 
school conditions are so variable from time to time and place 
to place that rule-of-thumb recommendations are likely to do 
more damage than good. 
The Validity of the Newer Objective Examination Methods. 
The foregoing discussion has dealt very largely with the 
reliability aspect of examinations alone. That: less has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
said about relative validities is in part at least intentional. 
In justification for this seeming neglect of validity, the most 
important aspect of examining and testing, two things must 
be borne in mind. In the first place, the two have close inter- 
relationships which will soon be brought out, and secondly, 
the reliability, or rather, the lack of reliability of the tradi- 
tional examination, is the aspect of the whole problem that 
has been brought under fire. 
It has been pointed out that the validity of an examination, 
the older forms or the newer proposals, rests finally very 
largely upon the judgments of teachers, educational officers, 
and educational experts. This will always be true to a con- 
siderable extent, but with gradual replacement of opinion 
by fact as experimental evidence accumulates and educational 
aims are crystallized. At present the teacher who is thoroughly 
informed in the literature of her specialty will be the best 
single authority for deciding what should and what should not 
be included in the examination or test. This statement im- 
plies due knowledge and use of many sources of information; 
e.g., the reports of the various special educational committees 
on minimum essentials, eliminations and additions relative 
to the school curricula, the yearbooks of the National Society 
for the Study of Education, the reports of the U. 8. Bureau 
of Education, the published courses of studies worked out by 
committees of curricular experts, analyses of the leading text- 
books, and professional treatises in the several school subjects. 
These provide the broader criteria for the selection, not 
only of the materials for the course of study, but at the same 
time for the justification of the inclusion or exclusion of the 
elements of the examination. The specific criteria must be 
provided from the thought, study, and judgment of the teacher. 
Personal judgment will enter to a considerable extent, and 
this right must be admitted if correlations and adaptations 
to local conditions, individual differences, and hard-earned 
skills on the part of the classroom teacher are not to be sacri- 
ficed. In all of these respects, the newer proposals for exami-
-P-A-G-E-111
  
BUILDING OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 101 
nation methodologies present no points of difference from the 
usual methods, now widely employed. 
There is however one more or less technical point which 
has not always been clearly realized. This is the matter of 
certain mutual relationships existing between validity and 
reliability. Validity, as here used, refers to the “worthwhile- 
ness’”’ of the content of the examination. It is synonymous 
with the inclusion of test items of importance and the exclusion 
of items of relative non-importance. That examinations can 
and do vary widely in merit from such a point of view is too 
evident for comment. But, as now used, the term has also 
the added significance of requiring a high reliability as well. 
Thus it is that a perfectly valid examination will of necessity 
also be perfectly reliable. An examination in reading or geog- 
raphy which has a low “reliability coefficient” cannot be valid. 
The reverse is not true, however. Reliability refers merely 
to accuracy of measurement. A scale or examination com- 
pletely lacking in validity for a specified purpose may still 
measure quite as accurately as it would if applied in the situa- 
tion for which it is truly valid. Such a situation would be 
had in the attempt to measure magnetic charges by means of 
a highly accurate thermometer. The thermometer would pos- 
sess reliability but not validity. Returning to the first condi- 
tion, however, we could not obtain a valid measurement of the 
temperature of a room with a thermometer with a low reliability. 
The important conclusion for the examination maker is 
that increasing the reliability of the examination does tend to 
increase its validity at the same time, to the extent that lack of 
perfect validity is a function of errors of measurement. One 
can easily picture this in terms of our thermometer analogy 
by thinking of the increase in the validity of a series of ther- 
mometer readings (due to increased reliability) as the reader, 
starting from a position sufficiently distant from the ther- 
mometer to introduce great error in his reading, moves step 
by step into a position near enough for accuracy of reading. 
Quy verious suggestions for reduction of tne size of tne 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
scoring unit, limitation of the numbers of possible answers 
possessing merit, wider sampling, etc., tend toward increased 
validity in this indirect sense of elimination of the sources of 
unreliability of grading. The other aspects of validity, such 
as justification of the specific items included in the examina- 
tion, do not possess characteristic differences between the 
traditional types and the proposed modifications. 
Use of the Results of Objective Examinations in Grading 
Pupils. It might appear at first sight that the results of such 
examinations cannot readily be used in grading pupils, since 
they do not fit in with the traditional “scale of one hundred.” 
Such is in reality not at all the case. Were it the proper 
place to enter upon a critical study of the merits of the tradi- 
tional marking system based upon a hundred points, it might 
easily be shown that it violates most of the principles of scien- 
tific measurement. Its familiarity and universal use have 
tended to give an exaggerated degree of confidence in its values. 
The primary aim of measurement, as has been repeatedly 
pointed out, is that of placing individuals along a scale of 
values in such a way that reasonable reliance may be placed 
in the accuracy of the rank orders. The more reliable the 
test or examination, the nearer the approach to this ideal. 
If 30 minutes testing with a completion exercise, true-false, 
or multiple-choice examination gives a higher reliability than 
30 minutes of the traditional essay-type of questions, just to 
the extent that this condition is true is the former to be pre- 
ferred to the latter upon the assumption that both are other- 
wise of approximately equal validity. 
As a matter of fact, most schools adopt some more or less 
definite and uniform system of assigning marks or grades, e.g., 
5% should receive the grade of A eto tee 20% « ‘ “ « B

It becomes a very simple matter to change the raw-point 
scores of the examination into letter grades by the mere process 
of counting in until the conditions of the grading device in 
use in the particular school have been fulfilled. 
Let us suppose that the scores listed below were earned by a 
class of 20 pupils in an examination in history. A strict appli- 
cation of the above percentage distribution scheme would 
yield the letter grades indicated. Teachers generally do, and 
should, feel free to make any changes indicated by the total facts 
at hand about the achievements of each pupil, and the mechanical 
application of the rules indicated in the example below should 
be taken merely as an illustration, not as an attempt at jus- 
tification of slavish adherence to a grading system which is 
arbitrary at best.

Even where the final marking is on the basis of a scale of 
100 points, if such points mean anything at all, there must be 
at least a rough agreement as to the number of pupils who 
should receive 95 or above, 90-95, 80-90, etc. In such a case, 
the counting in method is fully applicable and cannot possibly 
introduce error. It should never be forgotten that the source 
of error in marks arises in the examination proper and not in 
translating such marks into the grading system in use in the 
particular school. The latter process is nothing more or less 
than arithmetical juggling with the obtained measures in the 
interests of convenience of such administrative practices as 
reports to parents, school records, uniformity of marks from 
subject to subject and teacher to teacher, etc. 
There is no need to comment further upon the proposed 
newer types of examinations from the point of view of adapta- 
bility to conventional grading plans. The central problem 
ts that of obtaining the highest possible accuracy of measurement 
in the time available with the greatest possible validity, these 
terms being taken in their more technical sense. The other 
important objectives in examinations must be provided for 
in the light of previous recommendations and in terms of 
best methods of meeting the specific characteristics of such 
objectives. The more intensive the analysis of examination 
aims into specific objectives to be met, the greater the likeli- 
hood of useful practices being developed to further these ends. 
The present emphasis on the single desideratum of increased 
reliability can be justified in terms of the avowed purposes of 
this book, viz., a consideration of the advantages of the ob- 
jective examination over the traditional essay-type of exam- 
ination as a measuring instrument. 
SUMMARY 
1. Objective examinations may be classified into two general 
types; first, recall types like the completion exercise, and second, 
recognition types like the multiple-response, true-false, best-answer, 
and matching exercises :

BUILDING OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 105 
2. Considerable latitude is offered by these various types in adapt- 
ing the form of examination to the needs of the particular school 
subjects. 
3. Examples of the various types of objective examinations were 
given, together with detailed instructions for the building of these 
newer examinations. 
4, The number of items which can be covered by a pupil in a 
given working time can be stated approximately. The true-false 
type in general is most economical of time, and the recall type re- 
quires the most time. 
5. The reliability of objective examinations is more easily deter- 
mined in quantitative terms than is that of the essay-types. 
6. The sources of error in school marks are to be found in the 
examination proper, not in the changing of the marks to conform 
with letter-grade marking devices in use in the school. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Choose some topic suitable for a day’s recitation in history, 
geography, or physiology, etc. Build a series of objective questions 
which will cover that topic thoroughly as a five-minute test. Choose 
the form of examination from the following list: (1) completion, 
(2) 5-response, (3) true-false, (4) best answer, or (5) matching exer- 
cise. Give the examination to a class and observe the “spread” 
of the scores. State the average score and the range of the scores. 
2. Write a series of statements summarizing the advantages and 
limitations of each of the types of objective examinations listed at the 
beginning of Chapter IV. Include both practical and theoretical ad- 
vantages and disadvantages. Arrange your statements in tabular form. 
3. Prepare a semester examination of approximately the same 
comprehensiveness as that quoted from Miss Crawford, using the 
school subject most familiar to you. Build the examination around 
some particular textbook or course of study if desired.

  CHAPTER V 
EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF SEVERAL TYPES 
OF OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 
The Relative Merits of the Various Types. When we come 
to the point of formulating definite recommendations con- 
cerning the relative merits of the recall, true-false, multiple- 
choice, completion, matching-exercise, etc., types of examina- 
tions, we are met with a vast amount of opinion but practically 
no experimental evidence. The opinions of competent persons 
about such questions, like all other opinions, should be given 
weight in proportion to the amount of thought and experience 
that the individual has brought to bear on the question. At 
best, opinion is open to great error. The use of opinion must 
be safeguarded by experimentation. For this reason a series 
of experiments has been carried out at the University of 
Iowa which provide tentative answers to some of the pertinent 
questions of interest to the examination-maker. 
Some of the issues which may be settled by direct experi- 
mentation are suggested here: 
1. How many questions of each of the several objective 
types (recall, true-false, recognition, matching, etc.) can be 
completed in a given unit of time? 
2. What are the relative reliabilities of each type for an 
examination of stated length, e.g., 100 items? 
3. What are the relative reliabilities of each type for an 
examination of stated working-time limits, e.g., thirty min- 
utes? 
4. Which types are most difficult in terms of average scores 
earned? 
106
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 107 
5. Do true-false exercises tend to be psychologically unsound 
because of the presentation of false statements, thus fixing 
errors in the minds of pupils? 
6. Are the conventional corrections for chance adequate to 
neutralize the guessing element in multiple-choice and true- 
false statements? 
7. Are recognition exercises as valid (in the technical sense) 
as the formal written examination; i.e., are they artificial 
and unrelated to the modes of usage for knowledge in post- 
school life? 
Many other issues might well be raised at this time, but it 
is better judgment to proceed to the experimental results, 
reserving the discussion until the known facts are at hand. 
Experimental Studies of Objective Examination Methods. 
The author, together with Mr. George D. Stoddard,* selected 
a set of 100 information items covering the general field of 
history and the social sciences, suitable in difficulty for twelfth- 
grade pupils. These were then broken by chance into two 
approximately equal “forms,” designated as Form A and 
Form B. The items were then adapted to each of the following 
types: 
1. Recall 4. Recognition, 2 response 
2. Recognition, 5 response 5. True-False 
3. Recognition, 3 response 
Thus, each of the 100 items appeared in five different type- 
forms. The first ten items (Form A only) are given below in 
all five types.

In order to keep practice effects at as nearly a minimum as 
possible, it seemed inadvisable to attempt to have each pupil 
take the two forms in all five ways. For this reason all pupils 
were given the recall type, Form A, followed directly by 
Form B, and then one day later were given the same items in 
one other type-form. To administer the tests in this way, the 
total group of twelfth-grade pupils was broken into four sub- 
groups, designated as groups A, B, C, and D by a strictly 
alphabetical division. The senior classes of about fifteen 
Iowa high schools were arranged in alphabetical order, keeping 
the schools separate. The first one-fourth in the alphabet, 
all schools combined, were called “Group A,” the second one- 
fourth “Group B,” and so on for “Groups C and D.” 
It will thus be seen that the groups were random samplings 
with every school contributing equal numbers to each group. 
Since more than five hundred pupils were involved, the sub- 
groups can be accepted as equal in ability for all practical 
purposes. The sub-groups numbered about one hundred
-P-A-G-E-121
STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 111 
thirty-five pupils. The following tabulation will make these 
points clearer.

¢c 135 Recall A and B 2-Response A and B

The recall type was given first for two reasons: first, be- 
cause it is least suggestive of the correct answers and hence 
produces smaller practice effects on later tests; and secondly, 
in order that all four groups might take one test in common 
as a check on the equivalence of abilities of the groups. 
The mean scores, working times, and reliability coefficients 
are given in Tables VII, VIII, and IX which follow.

The figures in column (c) were calculated by means of 
Brown’s formula (see page 52*) by using n=2, as an estimate 
of the reliability of 100 items. The recall type seems to be 
most reliable for a stated number of test items. The 5-response 
type is also very dependable according to our results. 
*The same values can be read directly from Table XVIII to a rough approximation.

Form B proved to be somewhat more difficult in all types, 
but since the standard deviations are roughly equal in most 
cases, the A and B forms are comparable enough to make the 
reliability coefficients valid. The most striking fact of Table 
VIII is that the recognition types (multiple-response and 
true-false) are very much less difficult than the recall type. 
Part of this is obviously due to the chance element and guessing 
in the recognition types. More will be said of this later. 
The times needed to complete one hundred items were kept 
to the nearest half-minute, thus making it possible to deter- 
mine: (1) the relative rapidity of administration of each type, 
and, (2) the reliability per unit of working time. Table IX 
gives such calculations. 
The figures in column (6) of Table IX are the average times 
needed by the groups of 185 pupils to complete (i.e., attempt) 
100 items. The numbers in column (c) are the ratios of the 
time of the recall test to the times of each of the recognition 
tests, thus 18.7/16.0 =1.17, 18.7/13.5 =1.39, etc. This means
-P-A-G-E-123
STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 113 
that 117 5-response items can be given in the same length of 
time needed for 100 recall items, 18.7 minutes; 139 3-response 
items can be given in the time needed for 100 recall items, etc. 
The values in column (d) are brought forward from column (c) 
of Table VII.

The question at once presents itself whether equal working 
times would result in equal reliabilities of the several types. 
If, for example, 183 true-false items can be answered in 18.7 
minutes (the time needed for 100 recall items), what are the 
comparative reliabilities of 183 true-false items and 100 recall 
items? We have already seen the usefulness of Brown’s formula 
for arriving at such comparisons. Taking the coefficients of 
column (d) of Table IX and using 7 equal to 1.17, 1.39, 1.64, 
and 1.83, in turn, we obtain the values in column (e). These 
might be read as follows: “the reliability of type . . . . for 
18.7 minutes working time.” It will be seen that the original 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
114 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
differences are cut down to such an extent that at least two 
of the types prove to be as satisfactory as the recall under equal 
time limits. These are the 5-response and 2-response forms. 
The true-false and 3-response seem somewhat inferior. 
These results are not quite in accord with those of Dr. Toops, 
which will be presented in a later section of this chapter. 
Toops found the true-false type to be somewhat superior to 
either the recall or 5-response forms when equal working 
times are considered. Such minor differences and disagree- 
ments must not be allowed to obscure the real significance of 
these findings; viz., that 10 to 20 minute examinations of ob- 
jective type are very much more reliable than the 5 and 10 question 
traditional examinations which require 30 to 60 minutes. Ref- 
erence to Table IV, Chapter III, proves this point conclusively. 
There is little question that statements of reliabilities are 
much more comparable if equal working times are considered 
rather than equal numbers of items. No one would think of 
assuming that ten recall items requiring about two minutes 
to answer should be expected to show the same degree of 
reliability as would ten formal written questions requiring, 
perhaps, sixty minutes. Accepting working times as a proper 
criterion of length for an examination, we can draw up 2a 
series of recommendations which will show approximately how 
many items of each type should be included in an examination 
of given working-time limits. The following statements are 
based upon the facts of column (6) of Table IX. The recom- 
mendations are for twelfth-grade pupils and might well be 
cut in half for use in the elementary grades. Thus, about: 
Five recall items can be answered per minute of working time. 
Six 5-response items can be answered per minute of working time. 
Seven 3-response items can be answered per minute of working time. 
Nine 2-response items can be answered per minute of working time. 
Ten true-false items can be answered per minute of working time. 
f Corrections for Chance. In the opening paragraphs of this 
chapter, the question of the adequacy of the present methods
-P-A-G-E-125
STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 115 
in correcting for the element of chance or guessing in multiple- 
choice questions was raised. It has been the usual procedure 
to introduce corrections for chance where three or fewer 
possible choices are used in a test item. The formula is: 
wrongs 
n—   
, where n is the number of pos- 
sible choices. Corrected score =rights — 
Thus, for true-false and 2-response items, the corrected score = 
rights minus the wrongs; for 3-response, rights minus one-half 
the wrongs; for 4-response, rights minus one-third the wrongs; 
and for 5-response, rights minus one-fourth the wrongs, etc. 
Ordinarily four and five or more response multiple-choice 
types are not corrected for guessing. The soundness of this 
method of correction has been questioned for a number of 
reasons, the chief one being that it assumes that pupils guess 
answers which they do not actually know. An example will 
make this clearer. Pupil A takes a true-false test of 100 
items over a subject of which he knows nothing, e.g., a foreign 
language he has never studied. By chance alone he should get 
about 50 of the 100 items correct. His score would be: 
  
   Attempts. .- 100 
Right. 50 Corrected, rights —wrongs =0 
Wron; 50 
  Probably no one will object to this procedure in scoring where 
it is a clear case of guessing. It is clear that the 50 correct 
items were not earned, but merely guessed. In reality, although 
the test does include 100 items, the scale of merit begins at 
50 (since up to this point scores may be earned with zero knowl- 
edge) and extends to 100 (perfect performance). Thus: 
0 50 100 
——__——Scale of Test Values in Terms of Items———————— 
0 100 
<—Points Possible by Chance-—> <—Scale of Real Merit -———>
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
Similarly, 334 items in 100 in a 3-response test may be secured 
by guessing, and 25 in 100 in a 4-response test may be secured 
by guessing, etc. 
The real question is whether pupils actually do guess. Tx- 
perience of the author with adults whose statements can be 
trusted is to the effect that adults, at least, do not make sheer 
guesses in the majority of cases. It is largely a matter of 
training, experience, and temperament that determines the 
amount of pure guessing in such situations. The choice of 
the responses falls into at least five more or less distinct catego- 
ries, as follows: 
1. A certain percentage of the responses are given with high 
assurance. 
2. A certain percentage of the responses are given with 
reasonable assurance. 
3. A certain percentage of the responses are given where 
the subject “feels” he is guessing, but in reality he possesses a 
fringe of knowledge sufficient to make his “guesses” right very 
much oftener than wrong. 
4. A certain (usually very small) percentage of the responses 
are pure guesses. It is to be noted, however, that many sub- 
jects prefer to omit such items entirely. 
5. A certain percentage of the responses involve the situa- 
tion of the subject’s being sure that his choices are correct, 
when he is actually misinformed, his errors being in no sense due 
to guessing. 
(These percentages vary greatly in their relative proportions 
from individual to individual, from subject-matter of one kind 
to another, with the difficulty of the examinations, and prob- 
ably even from day to day with the same individual, all other 
factors being constant. Categories (1) and (2) involve little 
or none of the chance element. If the correction is applied 
to category (3), assuming that chance is operative, the result 
will be under-correction in the sense that ever-so-little-more-
-P-A-G-E-127
STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS LZ; 
than-zero knowledge will often be rewarded equally with 
absolutely certain knowledge. The correction for category (4) 
is probably fair within reasonable limits. The correction 
when applied to category (5) will over-correct, since erroneous 
knowledge and not guessing is the true ual 
Two general methods of experimentation are open to us in 
studying such facts. The first is that of having subjects 
register their assurance concerning the correctness of each 
response upon a graduated scale such as: 
“A” (absolute assurance). 
“B” (fairly sure). 
“C” (little or no confidence in validity of response). 
“D” (pure guesses). 
When this is done it can be shown that the proportion of 
right answers decreases rapidly as we pass down the scale of 
assurance. Even with the “‘D’ responses, there is generally 
a preponderance of correct answers, showing that, pure guessing 
is comparatively rare with most individuals. {Pure guessing 
often does take place with pupils of low mentality, or when any 
pupils are examined over materials far too difficult for their 
mental development.\ The author has seen morons in the 
third or fourth grades go straight down the test page, marking 
“true” or “false” over items of eighth- or high-school grade 
difficulties, where the net result when scored showed no pre- 
ponderance of correct responses over pure chance. In spite 
of such occasional reports as to pure guess work, |it is probably 
true that guessing plays a much smaller part than is ordinarily 
assumed. 
The second attack on the problem of the chance element is 
probably both easier and more valid, viz., comparisons of the 
reliabilities of examinations involving multiple choices with 
and without correction for chance. This method has been 
used in the data presented above. Table X on the next page 
shows the reliabilities of each type of examination, Form A 
vs. Form B, corrected and uncorrected for chance.

It will be noted that except in the case of the 3-response 
type, corrections for chance resulted in lessened reliability. 
The 3-response test, it will be seen, has behaved rather errati- 
cally throughout all of our experiments, proving to be much 
less reliable than the 2-response type, even when not corrected. 
The reasons for this are unknown, and the difference may not 
be great enough to possess statistical significance. By and 
large, there is no reason for our feeling confidence in the valid- 
ity of corrections for chance, as far as present data are con- 
cerned. 
In order to throw further light upon this problem of chance 
elements in test work, both Form A and Form B of the Terman 
Group Test of Mental Ability were given to the same group of 
43 college students. Tests 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 involve 
2-, 3-, or 4-response situations. The reliabilities were com- 
puted for uncorrected and corrected scores as before. Table XI 
gives the figures. 
In general, the correlations are lowered by the introduction

therefore, to assume that such corrections do not improve the

situation significantly. In fact, the net effect is perhaps in the 
other direction. {The recommendation is therefore tentatively 
put forth that multiple-response tests should not be corrected 
for chance. There is no evidence that the gain equals the 
additional labor in scoring the papers; in fact, there is some 
evidence that the marks are made more untrustworthy to 
some extent by correction practices now in vogue, 
Similar conclusions are indicated by inspection of the fol- 
lowing tables of means and standard deviations for the Terman 
group test (page 120). The means are slightly lowered by the 
corrections, but probably not significantly so. The variabili- 
ties (standard deviations) are somewhat increased. The 
general effect of these figures leads again to the conclusion 
that little pure guessing enters into the tests. The corrections 
for chance, except in one case (Test 8. Mixed Sentences), did 
not lower the means more than one score point.

STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 121 
Conclusions Reached. To sum up the foregoing discussion, 
the following statements may be held as tentatively established: 
1. The reliability of the objective types per unit of working 
time is very much greater than for the traditional essay-type 
of examination; reliabilities of 0.80 to 0.90 being possible for 
twenty-minute tests in comparison with 0.40 to 0.70 for thirty- 
to sixty-minute written examinations. (See Table IV of 
Chapter III.) 
Multiple-choice recognition examinations are easier (in the 
sense that higher average scores are earned) than recall types. 
Correction for chance (guessing, etc.) by the usual meth- 
ods does not seem promising. The reliabilities are probably 
decreased by such corrections, although the decrease in mean 
scores does indicate that guessing effects are minimized by the 
corrections. 
4. It is probably better to increase the length of objective 
examinations somewhat in order to eliminate chance successes 
rather than to give short examinations and depend upon 
statistical corrections. It is recommended that multiple-choice 
exercises be scored simply by counting the number of items 
correctly done and assuming that all individuals profit more 
or less equally by the opportunity for guessing. This assump- 
tion is ordinarily not very dangerous. 
5. Guessing is probably relatively infrequent in examinations 
of the proper degree of difficulty. The proper degree of diffi- 
culty can be defined as that of allowing the average score to 
be approximately one-half of the maximum possible score. 
No pupil should earn either a perfect score or a zero score. If 
he does, he cannot be said to have been measured. 
Results of Similar Investigations. The only other series of 
experiments’ which have been carried out in this direction 
seem to be those of Toops* in which a general information test 
was given in three different forms, viz., recall, recognition,

totaling one hundred twenty-four. From ten to thirty-nine 
took the tests in any given sequence. 
The following table has been calculated as a summary of 
Toops’s findings with reference to the relative difficulties of the 
same test items when presented in recall, 5-response, recogni- 
tion, and true-false form. Only scores earned on a form of the 
test when that form was taken first have been considered. 
There is therefore no practice effect to disturb the results.*

Thus it will be seen from Table XIV that, even when taken 
first so that there are no practice effects, the recognition and 
true-false forms are easier than the recall form. This probably 
is due to the factor of guessing and chance responses. At that, 
the differences are smaller than most readers would have es- 
timated in advance. An even more striking fact is that 183 
true-false questions may be given in the same length of time 
that it takes to give 100 identical questions in recall form. 
The advantage in speed is less in the case of the 5-response 
form since but 113 items can be given in the time for 100 recall 
questions. 
*Toops’s original table (Table XV of this book) gives the results when all possible orders- of-taking have been grouped together. Our Table XIV has been calculated to show the results for each type when taken first, since such figures are more comparable with our data previously reported in this chapter.

When Toops’s results are compared with the Iowa data, the 
general agreement is apparent. His figures for the number 
of items per unit of recall time which can be answered by the 
average pupil are in striking agreement. The fact that his 
returns show that a somewhat larger number of items of each 
type can be given per unit of time has no especial significance 
for us since his tests were not quite so difficult in terms of the 
abilities of his groups (compare the means of the two studies) 
and because his subjects were college students. A similar
-P-A-G-E-135
STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 125 
comment should be made concerning the size of the reliability 
coefficients. Toops’s coefficients are always lower than the 
Iowa results for tests of the same length, but it is well known 
that reliability coefficients vary greatly with the range of 
talent in the group tested, as well as differ considerably for 
different kinds of test materials. Our somewhat larger group 
of high-school seniors almost certainly represents a wider 
range of talent than the smaller and more highly selected 
college group which Toops tested. The relative sizes of the 
reliability coefficients can be much more fairly compared. 
Even here the differences are not great, the most striking 
difference being that Toops found the true-false to be superior 
to either the recall or 5-response recognition types, while the 
present study showed these to rank in this order for equal 
working times: recall, 5-response, true-false. 
Careful study of Toops’s data will not result in indicating 
important changes in the recommendations which we have 
made from time to time, although responsibility for such 
recommendations must in fairness rest upon the author of this 
book, rather than upon Dr. Toops. Both studies agree upon 
the main point at issue, viz., the relatively great superiority 
of objective examinations over the traditional types from the 
standpoint of accuracy of pupil measurement. This in turn 
is chiefly a function of the economy of the method, the increased 
range of sampling of the pupil’s knowledge, and the objectivity 
of the newer methods. 
Additional Pedagogical and Psychological Considerations. 
In the opening paragraphs of this chapter, a list of questions 
concerning the relative merits of the various objective examina- 
tion types was introduced. Answers to some of these, par- 
ticularly with reference to relative reliabilities, time require- 
ments, and relative difficulties, have already been given in 
terms of our experimental findings. Certain other questions 
have not as yet been discussed. 
The first of these is the assertion which has frequently been
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  126 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
made that the true-false exercises are psychologically objec- 
tionable, due to the fact that they present untruths in bold 
form, thus practicing pupils in errors. At the outset, it should 
be borne clearly in mind that this is an assertion, not an es- 
tablished fact. There is no trustworthy evidence on this point. 
Educational psychologists would probably agree that repetitive 
exposure of false statements to a child will result in erroneous 
learning. Whether this is true when a mental set is previously 
established to the effect that, “some of the statements are true 
and some are false and you are to decide which ones are true and 
which ones are false,’ is not known. Moreover there is no 
prolonged exposure to the falsehood, nor authoritative sanction 
to the false statements, which would operate to “fix” the wrong 
connections. : 
In actual life, we know that we do have to deal with fact 
and falsehood in much the same fashion as in the true-false 
test, as when one says in the course of casual conversation, 
“The Bok peace proposal will provide a workable basis for 
the realization of universal peace,” or “The winters are getting 
warmer year by year,” etc. It must be admitted that after 
the pupil leaves the classroom to enter upon his life vocation, 
he is much more likely to use knowledge in discriminating 
between truth and error than he is to “recite” such knowledge 
in the formal and pedantic school-days manner. It is doubtful 
whether any reader of these paragraphs has ever been called 
upon outside the walls of the classroom to stand up and ‘‘dis- 
cuss the causes of the Revolutionary War,” or to ‘enumerate 
the products of New England.’”’ We do use knowledge of 
this sort, but we do not use it in this formal manner. The 
novelty of the newer methods, on the one hand, and the 
familiarity of the traditional examination question, on the 
other, must not bias our judgments unduly. True-false 
questioning is certainly different, but it does not follow that 
it is unnatural or unpedagogical. It may be so, but that is for 
experience and experiment to decide in due time.
-P-A-G-E-137
  STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 127 
There is one aspect of the problem, however, which calls 
for comment. In Table VIII, the averages of the various 
types of the history and social science test were presented. 
Combining Forms A and B, we get: 
TYPE AVERAGE 
2-response 67.62 
True-False 57.73 
The true-false form is definitely more difficult, it appears. 
This fact will take on significance when it is recalled that the 
chance element enters equally into the two, at least in theory, 
since both are in 2-response form. 
This whole matter of the usefulness of the true-false examina- 
tion awaits the results of further study. That the true-false 
form of question is definitely easier than the question-and- 
answer form seems clear. That the true-false examination is 
unnatural and unpedagogic may be disputed and will remain 
for the present a mooted point. That the “guessing” element 
enters into the success or failure to answer seems clear, the 
effect and amount of this factor being uncertain. Some 
evidence was presented to show that reliability suffers rather 
than gains by attempts to correct for chance by the current 
practices. \ Students of this question differ in their opinions. 
Dr. Ben D. Wood of Columbia, who has done a great deal 
of examination construction of the objective type, advises 
against the use of the correction formula.! For example, 
in the directions for a college objective examination in govern- 
ment, he gives this advice: ‘‘Do not guess. The chances are 
against you in guessing,” and again, in the directions for an 
examination in economics, he says: “.... . it is advisable 
to leave those questions unmarked concerning which you are 
in doubt. In short, DO NOT GUESS.” Another writer, 
Dr. W. A. McCall,? is of the opinion that the pupils should 
be instructed to guess. The author’s experience to date 
leads him to agree with the first of these recommendations.

  128 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
The “guessing” element is probably sufficiently eliminated 
in the 5-, 6-, and 7- or more response situations to neglect it 
entirely for practical purposes. The recall types are almost 
entirely free from this objection. ; 
In all events, the recall and multiple-response types seem to 
be superior in every point of view and are to be recommended 
for use over the true-false type. They are more natural and 
at least equally reliable, the one disadvantage being that they 
are not so economical of time and hence do not provide as 
wide a sampling per unit of working time. All of the objective 
types are decidedly easier than the traditional question. 
Whether this is a real disadvantage cannot be stated. The 
difference can be overcome in part by making the questions 
relatively harder. This is very easily done to any desired 
degree of difficulty as can be shown by the following three 
questions: 
1. Shakespeare was born in the 14th century 15th century 
16th century 17th century 18th century. 
2. Shakespeare was born in 1066 1340 1564 1616 
1776. 
8. Shakespeare was born in 1564 1575 1616 1620 
1632. 
Which one of these three questions is the preferable one 
depends upon circumstances and the aims which the teacher 
holds. Failure to answer question 3 on the part of a professor 
of English literature would probably be inexcusable, but most 
of the world’s work could be carried on by persons possessing 
no more definite knowledge than that implied in question 1. 
A more serious objection is that the presentation of re- 
sponses from which the pupil has merely to select the correct 
one does away with one of the important stages of the com- 
plete act of thought. It must be admitted that the pupil 
does not take the initiative in suggesting possible answers. 
Much of the force of this objection is lost when the recall 
type is used.
-P-A-G-E-139
  STUDIES OF TYPES OF EXAMINATIONS 129 
Against this limitation may be set an interesting and hitherto 
little developed possibility in examining and testing. The 
multiple-response type of examination permits the teacher to 
assemble as the alternative answers a number of points of 
particular difficulty, e.g., commonly confused dictional and 
grammatical usages, word ‘demons,’ and the persistent 
difficulties and ‘errors of school children. This limits the 
testing to the ~most -critical difficulties. If a progressive 
teacher does not fear a little additional work, she can make 
many interesting and valuable contributions by carrying on 
little side investigations like the following: 
If a series of questions like those below were submitted to 
large numbers of pupils, or to successive classes year by year, 
and the frequency with which each error occurred was tabu- 
lated, it would be possible to make multiple-response ques- 
tions which possessed most critical and highly diagnostic value. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Who is the author of “Pride and Prejudice’? 
2. What type of writing is ‘““Beowulf’’? 
3. What is the theme of ““Thanatopsis”? 
Ete. 
As possible answers to these questions, restated in objective 
form, could be placed the correct answer and the 4 or 5 most 
commonerrors. The value of such items over ones deliberately 
formulated would be enormous. 
All in all, there is little danger that the objective examina- 
tion will necessarily err in the direction of too great ease. 
In conclusion, it may be said that the greatest weaknesses 
of the newer proposals donot center about the points just 
discussed. Rather they are to be found in the neglect of 
training in organization of thought and literary expression, 
etc. Special provision must be made for the attainment of 
these ends; i.e., there should be specific examinations and 
merit scales constructed for such purposes. The position is

taken throughout this book that such abilities and skills are 
worthy of a definite technique, not to be found in either the 
traditional examination or the objective examination. That 
more has not been said in the way of a concrete program for 
the realization of these primary ends can be justified by the 
fact that such programs are outside the projected scope of the 
present treatment.

  CHAPTER VI 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO 
EXAMINATION TECHNIQUE* 
Introduction. It has been necessary from time to time to 
refer to certain statistical procedures which have not been fully 
explained in passing. This practice has been adopted inten- 
tionally to permit the reader who is unskilled in statistical 
method to follow the general discussion without being dis- 
tracted by mathematical terminology and computations. 
Many readers, however, will be interested in the exact statistical 
procedures upon which certain findings and conclusions have 
been based. The summary of the study on the reliabilities of 
written examinations which appeared in Table IV of Chapter 
III is a case in point. (It is even rhore important that the 
critical teacher be shown the method by which the merits 
of an examination can be evaluated, whether such examinations 
be of the traditional type or the newer objective varieties. 
For the sake of encouraging such critical studies, the following 
chapter will be devoted to the more purely statistical phases of 
these matters, and several actual problems involving statistical 
analysis will be presented in some detail. 
The statistical methods introduced in this chapter are all of 
fundamental importance in educational thinking, and are 
therefore well worth the trouble necessary for their mastery. 
The textbooks by Rugg, Kelley, and Monroe cited at the end 
of Chapter VI will be found useful in obtaining fuller under- 
standing of the topics presented more briefly in the present 
discussion.   
    e generel reader may wish to skip this chapter because of its somewhat technical . For this reason it is placed last.

Prosiems IN STatisticaL DETERMINATIONS 
Problem 1: To determine the reliability coefficient of a 
written examination. In order to keep the illustration close 
to a real school situation, an actual examination from a seventh- 
grade class in physiology and hygiene has been selected. The 
original scoring of tae teacher has been, used in all the com- 
putations. The examination included these five questions: 
1. What are the two most important aims of physiology? 
2. State five rules of health that upper grade children should know 
and practice. 
3. Name the two classes of muscles and give examples of each kind. 
4. Give two uses of the bones. 
5. Name three digestive juices and tell what each does to the 
food. 
Thirty pupils wrote on these questions, and each question 
was graded upon a basis of 20 points. In order to find out just 
how reliable the results of this examination were, the scores 
earned on the odd-numbered items (questions 1, 3, and 5) 
were added up separately from those of the even-numbered 
items (questions 2 and 4). This is known as “breaking the 
examination into chance halves.” Since but five questions 
were given, the “halves” cannot be made to contain the same 
number of questions, it being necessary to place three questions 
in one of the chance “halves” and but two questions in the 
other. This will not make any very important difference in 
the correlation. Table XVI on the next page gives the data 
as tabulated from the thirty papers. 
The next step in the solution of our problem is that of obtain- 
ing the correlation of the chance halves of the examination. 
There are a number of methods of doing this, but the Pearson 
product moment coefficient of correlation is the best. The 
most convenient method of carrying out the actual computa- 
tions is shown by the solution in Table XVII. The odds will 
be designated by X and the evens by Y, and these scores have 
been tabulated in the columns so designated. In order to avoid

a correction can be made for the relatively small errors intro-

The coefficient of correlation is found to be 0.37 between 
the halves of the examination. It might be pointed out in 
passing, lest confusion arise over the use of assumed means, 
that the means as corrected (viz., 43.7 and 30.7) are identical 
with those obtained directly in Table XVI. Since similar 
corrections have been applied both in the numerator and in 
the denominator of the formula for 7, the r obtained will agree 
perfectly with an r obtained by the use of deviations about the 
true means. The formula for r can be simplified in case the 
deviations are used from the true means, using « and y instead 
of x’ and y’ for the deviations: 
Zay 
: Vix Vy? 
A further step is necessary to obtain the reliability coefficient 
of the examination as a whole. The value 0.37, it will be 
recalled, represents the correlation of half of the examination 
with the second half of the examination. To obtain 712. (mean- 
ing the correlation which would be expected between the whole 
examination actually given and a second but hypothetical 
examination of the same length which might be made up of 
five similar questions) from 7, (meaning the correlation of 
chance halves which was actually computed), we need only 
substitute the value 2 for n, and 0.37 for r in the following 
formula: 
mr 
Ti+ Gn 
This formula is variously known as “Brown’s formula” and as 
the “Spearman prophecy formula,’”’ the latter name being, 
perhaps, preferable. The solution for our problem is: 
vie 2(0.37) i 
mm 14+(2—1) (0.37) 
The value for n is taken as 2, since the whole examination is 
two times the length of the half examinations. It is obvious 0.54
-P-A-G-E-147

that such an examination is not very reliable; in fact, it should 
be considered quite inadequate for purposes of measurement. 
Pupils tested with this examination would in many cases earn 
very different marks if the examination were repeated on 
another day with five questions as similar in type to these as 
possible, but not identical in the knowledge called for. 
Just how great the errors of measurement in individual 
pupil’s marks can be where the reliability of the examination 
is 0.54, will be the task of the second problem, viz., to determine 
the amount of error present in an individual score on an exami- 
nation. Before doing this, however, attention should be called 
to Table XVIII which presents values of 7,, for values of 7 
and n. We can obtain the value of ry of our problem directly 
without computation, knowing that 7; is 0.37, by the use of 
this table. Since the values of r are given only by intervals 
of 10 units, it will be necessary to estimate the value of r=0.37

by interpolation between the values for r at 0.35 and 0.40. 
Looking down the column for n=2, ry, is found to be 0.46 
for r=0.30, and 0.57 for r=0.40. By interpolation we get 
0.54 as the value for a test twice as long as the half examinations 
under consideration. 
There are further uses of this table for Brown’s formula 
which are of practical interest to the student of examination 
methods or standardized tests. For example, we can get an 
approximately correct answer to such a question as the fol- 
lowing directly from the table without computation: 
Quzstion: If the obtained reliability of a written examination 
or test containing 10 questions is 0.50, how many questions must be 
given to raise the reliability up to 0.90? 
The answer can be read from the table by looking along the 
row containing values of r=0.50 until 0.90 is found. This is 
in the column for n=9. We must then make the examination 
nine times as long; i.e., use 90 items instead of 10 if we wish to 
have the examination as reliable as 0.90. Since reliabilities of 
0.50 to 0.60 are perhaps the general rule with the ordinary 
examination, it will be seen at once that the only hope of getting 
accurate results with such examinations would be by the use 
of examinations many times longer than our present ones. It 
will be of interest at this point to refer back to the results 
presented upon the reliability coefficients of the objective 
examinations presented in Chapter V. : 
Problem 2: To determine the amount of error present in 
an individual score or mark on an examination or test. The 
same data used in the preceding problem will illustrate the 
present problem very nicely. The task is that of estimating 
just how accurate an examination is that has a reliability of 
0.54, which is our estimate based upon the only method open 
to us, viz., the correlation of chance halves corrected by Brown’s 
formula as an approximation to the reliability of the examina- 
tion as a whole. We would like to know the amount of error 
present in an individual pupil’s mark or grade on the average.
-P-A-G-E-149
  STATISTICAL CON! SIDERATION S 139 
To do this we need a further formula* which may be desig- 
nated as the formula for the “probable error of an individual 
score.” This is: 
P. B.(score) = 67450-V 1 — rip. 
In the preceding problem we found that ri2 was equal to 
0.54. The formula calls for the further value, ¢, or the stand- 
ard deviation of the scores on the entire examination (see last 
column of Table XVI headed ‘Total Score”). The details of 
this computation are presented in Table XIX. The value 
12.8, obtained for the standard deviation (c) when substituted 
in the formula for the probable error of a score yields: 
P. Egeore) = 6745 X12.8 V1 —.54, or 5.8. 
Knowing the probable error of an individual score as equalling 
approximately 6 points (5.8 exactly), we are able to make 
certain other definite interpretations which will serve as a more’ 
specific answer to our question about the amount of error 
present in the mark of an individual pupil. The facts we have 
discovered to date can be summarized as follows: 
   Highest mark earned 
Lowest mark earned............. 46 
Difference (i. e., the range)....... 52 
Calling the probable error of a score 6 points in round num- 
bers, the situation can be pictured by these statements. If a 
pupil taking this examination in physiology earned a score of 
80, the chances are: 
1 in 2 that his true score is as low as 74 or as high as 86; 
1 in 5 that his true score is as low as 68 or as high as 92; 
1 in 20 that his true score is as low as 62 or as high as 98.   
*The formula presented here may not be, theoretically, the best one available. It does 
not allow for regression effects, but does have the advantage of being better known than the 
formula, ¢ ©.1=01 V/712—1"12, which Kelley recommends. See Kelley, T. L.: Statistical 
Methods, pages 214-216.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 141 
Nearly one pupil in five, then, will have a mark which is in 
error by an amount which is almost equal to the standard 
deviation of the scores of the class as a whole. Since the standard 
deviation includes 34 per cent of the total cases of the distri- 
bution, it indicates the presence of a pretty wide margin of 
error in the marks of individual pupils. The same facts can 
be stated in terms of the range for the class: 
Chances are 1 in 2 that his score is in error by the range. 
Chances are 1 in 5 that his score is in error by ¢ the range. 
Chances are 1 in 20 that his score is in error by 3 the range. 
Even if the marks are expressed as roughly as a five-point 
scale like A, B, C, D, and E£, it might be shown that approxi- 
mately + of the pupils receive the wrong letter grade. 
From all of these points of view we are forced to conclude 
that, whatever the merits of this particular physiology examina- 
tion as a measure of the ability of the class as a whole, the 
examination does not provide an accurate instrument for the 
measurement of the ability of particular pupils in the subject of 
physiology. Such an examination must either be made more 
objective by the use of multiple-response, true-false, or com- 
pletion exercises, etc., or else made very much longer. The 
first. would seem theoretically and practically to be the better 
solution, but both things should probably be done simultane- 
ously. The situation arises here as to what degree of reliability 
is needed for accuracy of placement of individual pupils. Our 
next problem, then, is to show how great the accuracy of meas- 
urement is for examinations of varying degrees of reliability. 
Problem 3: To determine what constitutes a satisfactory 
reliability coefficient for an examination. Since reliability is 
usually stated in terms of “reliability coefficients,’ which are 
in turn nothing more than correlations between similar sets of 
examinations, our present problem reduces to that of evaluating 
the accuracy of measurement for different values of coefficients 
of correlation. The meaning of a coefficient of correlation rests 
upon the magnitude of the errors in prediction arising from the
-P-A-G-E-152
    
142 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
use of any particular correlation coefficient as an instrument for 
prediction. Correlations are intended to portray existing 
relationships. Two things are said to be correlated when any 
change in the one is attended by some fixed corresponding 
change in the other. For example, height in school children 
is positively correlated with age, since in general the older 
children are, the taller they become, at least up to a certain 
limit. The volume of a gas is correlated with its pressure and 
its temperature, the relationship being negative for pressure 
and positive for temperature. When coefficients of correlation 
are used for purposes of prediction, two limiting conditions 
must be true as a sheer matter of logic, viz.: 
1. When correlation is zero, the error of prediction is a maxi- 
mum. This error might be given the arbitrary value of 1.00. 
2. When correlation is unity, the error of prediction is 
aminimum. This error will accordingly be zero. 
If the color of men’s eyes is not at all correlated with their 
heights (i.e., r=0), then nothing can be predicted about a 
particular man’s height even if his eye color is known. The 
same holds for attempted prediction of eye color when heights 
are known. On the contrary, if gas volumes are correlated to 
unity (r=1.00) with temperature (when pressure is held 
constant), we can tell exactly the volume of a given weight of 
gas if the temperature is known, and contrariwise for the 
temperature if the volume is known. 
Just how close a prediction can be made when r is 0.25, 
0.60, 0.85, etc.? Due to the fact that values of r are stated 
in numerical terms on a scale of one hundred, the error is often 
made of considering the values of r as per cents. This is very 
fallacious. An r of 0.50 does not mean half-of-perfect agreement 
or 50 per cent perfect prediction. In reality it has a very dif- 
ferent meaning. If we are to use reliability coefficients as state- 
ments of the accuracy of examinations or tests, we must have 
a scale of values for the interpretation of the meaning of these 
reliability coefficients. It is possible to make such a scale in
-P-A-G-E-153
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 143 
terms of the well known formula for the standard error of 
estimate, i.e., on=oiV 1—r*. Inspection shows that the 
expression under the radical equals zero when r equals 1.00, 
and equals 1.00 when r equals zero. 
It follows then that the standard error of estimating scores 
in one trait from known scores in another is always some 
fractional part of the standard deviation of the scores of the 
first trait. Table XX below shows how this formula can be 
applied to the formulation of a set of values which are real

statements of the significance of values of 7 in terms of the 
amounts of error involved in the use of these values of 7 for 
purposes of prediction. The values of V1—7? in column (6) 
have been termed ‘‘coefficients of alienation” by Dr. T. L. 
Kelley who has called attention to this method of evaluating 
the magnitudes of correlation coefficients. 
Returning to the reliability coefficient of 0.54, which was 
found for the physiology examination, Table XX, column (c) 
shows that such a correlation reduces the error of prediction 
about 15 per cent over sheer guessing.* In other words, in 
terms of the accuracy of prediction, such an examination 
represents an improvement of roughly 15 per cent over chance 
assignment of marks. 
What then does constitute a satisfactory degree of reliability? 
This question must be answered in terms of the practical 
situation. It would be easy to exaggerate the importance of 
high reliability in the ordinary examination, since school 
purposes require but moderate degrees of accuracy, especially 
since most schools convert numerical scores into letter grades 
upon a scale of perhaps 4-6 points. But even granting this, 
we still must conclude that an examination no more reliable 
than 0.50 to 0.60 has very small value in measuring the results 
of teaching. 
Reference to Table XX again shows that we would have 
to push the reliability of examinations up to 0.866 to eliminate 
half of the error of estimate. Even at 0.99 there is still left 
roughly + of the error present at zero correlation. The practical 
lesson from all this discussion of what might appear to be need- 
less mathematical detail is that we must meet the facts of the 
situation as they are. In the first place, the time that can 
profitably be devoted to examinations is limited. This being 
*The expression “guessing” as here used can be pictured by the following situation: Sup- pose that the scores of the class taking the geography examination were written, pupil by pupil, on gun wads and shaken thoroughly in a box, ‘The gun wads would then be drawn yy chance from the box, assigning the mark on the first wad drawn to the first pupil, the mark on the second wad to the second pupil, etc. Marks thus determined would have zero reliability since they were alloted by chance alone.
-P-A-G-E-155
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 145 
the case it is all the more necessary that the most reliable 
types of examinations possible be employed. Chapter V has 
already presented ample evidence that the newer and more 
objective varieties of examination are greatly superior in 
accuracy of measurement per unit of time to the traditional 
essay-types of examinations. If 30 minutes testing with 
multiple-choice questions gives a reliability of 0.75 to 0.80 and 
the ordinary examination gives but 0.50 to 0.60 for the same 
length of time, then, all other things being equal, the former 
type is to be recommended. The general trend of the results 
of our investigations has consistently pointed in this direc- 
tion. 
While the question of the amount of time which can profitably 
be devoted to examination of pupils is before us, it is in order 
to call attention to certain aspects of the question which are 
sometimes overlooked. In the first place, the total amount of 
time allotted to examining pupils’ achievement is ordinarily 
but a very small portion of the total time available for study. 
Even if the examination periods were doubled or trebled in 
length, this would still hold true. In a class which spends 
30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for from four to four and one- 
half months, a total teaching time of about 2500 minutes is 
involved. To devote two class periods of 30 minutes each to 
a final examination would mean that roughly 2} per cent of 
the total time was used for final examination purposes. This 
cannot well be held to be excessive if examinations are worth 
anything at all. Sixty minutes devoted to multiple-choice 
questions or some similar objective type will be sufficient for 
the use of 200 or more test items instead of the ten traditional 
questions, with consequent wider sampling, not to mention 
the increased objectivity and reliability. 
The reliability of such an examination can easily be made 
as high as 0.80 to 0.85, possibly even higher as has been shown. 
To count this time lost from the teaching time is erroneous. 
Owing to the competitive spirit and unusual effort shown by
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 IMPROVEMENT OF EXAMINATIONS 
pupils during formal examinations, the examination period 
really becomes a highly motivated and effective teaching situation. 
Within very wide limits, time spent on well thought out 
examinations is time very effectively employed. This point is 
not always consciously borne in mind. 
SUMMARY 
1. The statistical procedure for the determination of the reliability 
coefficient of an examination was outlined in detail with a sample 
solution. : 
2. The use of “Brown’s formula” for estimation of the reliability 
of examinations or tests was explained, and a reference table included 
to save statistical computations. 
3. The dependability of examination scores was discussed in terms 
of the concept of the “probable error of an individual score.” De- 
tailed directions for such computations and a sample solution were 
given. The probable error of a score permits the estimation of the 
probabilities of serious displacement of a given mark away from the 
true ability of the pupil. 
4. The use of correlation coefficients for purposes of prediction 
was explained in relation to educational procedures, and a table 
was presented for use in interpreting the significance of correlations 
of varying magnitudes. 
5. The use of thirty to sixty minutes of classroom time for pur- 
poses of examining as frequently, even, as once a month or oftener, 
can be shown to be a very profitable investment of the pupil’s time in 
terms of the returns by way of practice, drill, and motivation, apart 
from the measurement aspects of examining. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Construct a 10-question examination of the usual type in some 
rather subjective subject like grammar, geography, history, or physiol- 
ogy. Number the questions from one to ten and place the odd- 
numbered and even-numbered questions in separate lists. Give 
both lists to the same pupils, using two entire classes if possible. 
2. Score the papers and tabulate the scores of all pupils.
-P-A-G-E-157
  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 147 
3. Correlate the scores of the “odds” and “evens,” following the 
scheme given in Table XVII. (Consult the first reference below if 
you find difficulty in the computation of the coefficient of correlation.) 
4, Find the standard deviation for the distribution of total scores 
(sum of “odds” and “evens’’) following the procedure outlined in 
Table XIX. 
5. Calculate the P. E. of a score by the formula given on page 139. 
6. By the use of Table XVIII, estimate how many questions like the 
ten you actually employed would be required to yield a reliability 
of 0.90.

EXAMPLES OF OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS 
The examinations which follow are in every case actual ones which 
have been repeatedly tried out on high school or elementary school 
pupils. In the case of the first, the High School Content Examination,! 
it might be said that it is in reality a standardized test, since norms 
are available on about 3000 seniors and high-school graduates. 
However, this test was validated only by the combined judgments 
of a number of judges. It is included here to show the method of re- 
cording the responses by the pupils. This plan is the most rapid scoring 
device which has yet been developed by test makers. The entire 
examination (400 items) can be scored at a rate of 10-15 tests an hour, 
a gross speed which is at least as economical as the ordinary ten- 
question examination. Twenty minutes are allowed for each section, 
or a total of eighty minutes.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
NasHvitis, TENN., January 1, 1909. 
fo His Excellency Governor M. R..Patterson, Nashville, Tenn.: 
The usefulness of a school report from an educational stand- 
point consists in furnishing a standard of measurement whereby 
the interest, a community takes in its schools and the value it 
attaches to an education may be ascertained with some degree 
of accuracy. Viewed from this standpoint it is interesting to 
note the following table, which shows a comparison of school 
conditions covering a number of years:

  The faets, as stated above, however, de not possess their great- 
est value within themselves. It is only by comparing the above 
data that we are enabled to tell whither we are traveling and at 
what rate. Hence the greatest value of the Superintendent’s 
report consists in furnishing a medium of comparison whereby 
we can measure our own progress, or lack of progress, and also 
compare the educational conditions of our own State with other 
States working under similar conditions. 
From the above data it can be seen that the schools of the 
State have enjoyed a healthful growth, and while the growth 
has not been so rapid as it might have been under more favorable 
conditions, yet for this lack of rapid growth we can at least plead 
mitigating circumstences. It takes money to build up a strong 
system of schools, and Tennessee, as a State, has not always been 
in good financial condition.
-P-A-G-E-32
. 
   —30— 
It will be noticed that the length of school term from the 
year 1878 to 1888 increased only two days, and the average 
salary of the teacher was increased only $1.59 per month, while 
the total annual expenditure increased from $794,231.57 in 
1878 to $1,157,930.12 in 1888. It might be asked why should 
such an increase in expenditures so slightly modify the length 
of term and teachers’ salaries. In the first place the increase in 
revenues little more than kept pace with the increase in scho- 
lastic population and with the increase in the teaching force. 
The scholastic popuiation in 1878 was 448,917; in 1888, 652,508, 
while the teaching force in 1878. numbers.5,592 vs. 7,439 in 1888. 
Again, when the present school system was organized we had no 
school property.. The schools were taught chiefly in church 
houses or in rented property. There is no separate fund for 
erecting school buildings, hence all public school houses, grounds, 
furniture, apparatus, etc., must either be paid for out of the 
public school fund or by private donation or subscription ; there- 
fore, the difference in value between school property in 1878, 
which was estimated at $1,051,398.67, and the value of school | 
property in 1888, which was estimated at $1,934,374.86, rep- 
resents a gain in ten years in valuation of school property of 
$882,976.19. This large gain in school property values is the 
result of using a good portion of the public school fund each 
year with which to erect and equip school houses. This practice 
is still kept up and all of our school property in the country 
schools has been acquired at a cost of length of school term or 
decrease of teacher’s salary. 
SpeciAL Funp For BuILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT. 
   Tf a law were passed permitting counties to levy a special 
/ tax for a building and repair fund, or authorizing the county 
to issue bonds for crecting and equipping school houses, it would 
go far toward securing good school houses and equipment, and 
at the same time would save the present fund for use in paying 
the running expenses of the schools, thereby giving longer 
terms and adding materially to the efficiency of the school. 
The cities of the State, in fact of the whole country, have 
not relied upon the State, county and municipal taxes to secure 
sufficient funds for purchasing sites, erecting and furnishing 
school houses, but have in a vast majority of cases resorted to a
-P-A-G-E-33
—31— 
bond issue. This does not work an injustice upon anybody, 
since the school buildings will serve several generations. It is 
no argument to say that a debt is being fastened upon future 
generations, for that same generation will have the school build- 
ing, and they will only bear their just proportion of the burden. 
ScHoot Houszs. 
The last Legislature very wisely passed an act authorizing 
the State Superintendent to have prepared, by a competent archi- 
tect, plans and specifications for rural school buildings, ‘‘vary- 
ing in cost from $300 to $5,000, and to publish in pamphlet 
form these plans and specifications, together with plans for heat- 
ing and ventilation, and such other suggestions as may be help- 
ful to school authorities in the construction of school houses in 
the rural school districts of the State; and that a sum not ex- 
ceeding $300 be appropriated for the said purpose to be paid 
on warrants of the State Comptroller as provided by law for 
other purposes.’? The book of plans was prepared in accord- 
ance with the above act and a copy has been placed in the hands 
of every public school official in the State. The boards of edu- 
cation in general have followed the plans in every detail, and as 
a result school house architecture has been greatly improved. 
However, we still have some school houses erected that in no 
sense conform to the laws of heating, lighting and ventilation. 
Since it costs no more to construct a comfortable building that 
conforms to the laws of sanitation than it does to construct an 
ill-convenient building that violates every sanitary law, in my 
opinion the State owes it to its children to require school au- 
thorities to erect buildings in accordance with the plans gotten 
out by the State or prepared by some competent architect. 
Every school site and building should correspond to the prin- 
ciples set forth below as nearly as possible. The suggestions 
given will be found in the book of school house plans referred 
to above. 
ScxHoo. Sires. 
The first problem that presents itself for solution in the 
erection of a school building is the selection of a site, and in 
making this selection the chief things to be considered are ‘‘size, 
soil, sightliness and location,’’ in the community with reference 
to accessibility and relative distances to patrons served. v
-P-A-G-E-34
—32— 
While no school lot should contain less than one acre and 
should preferably lie in rectangular form, about 180 feet front 
and 240. feet. in depth, yet if the land is cheap two or three acres 
or even five are much more desirable. This will give ample space 
for all the outdoor sports—an incalculable advantage which all 
rural schools should possess. 
The soil of a school site should not have beneath it a stratum 
" of. impervious clay which will permit ground water to stand in 
the:yard, but should have a porous soil free from decaying 
matter. 
The surface of the school ground should slope toward the 
road and its elevation should be sufficient to drain all parts nat- 
urally. . The site most perfectly located would be one with nat- 
ural drainage in all directions. It should also possess as many 
natural features of beauty as possible, and while it should not 
be located in an obscure or isolated spot, yet great care should 
be taken to avoid a location where there is ‘‘frequent passing, 
travel or local industries that would disturb the work of the 
school.’’ . 
ScHoot House. 
Having briefly described. some of the necessary requisites of 
a good school site, let us consider briefly the elements of a good 
* sehool house. The size of the building must be determined by 
the number of occupants that are to use it, but whether it is a 
small one-room house for the accommodation of twenty-five pu- 
pils, or a large structure for twenty-five hundred, the same laws 
of sanitation should prevail and the same care in the selection 
of material and good workmanship ‘should be exercised. I know 
of no better description of what a public school house should be 
than that given by Mrs. Sigourney, of Connecticut, who said: 
“T hope the time is coming when every isolated village school 
house shall be a temple on whose exterior the occupant may 
study the principles of symmetry and grace. Why need the 
structures where the young are initiated into those virtues which 
make life beautiful be divorced from taste or devoid of comfort? 
Why should they not be erected in fine, airy situations, over- 
shadowed with trees and embellished with shrubbery? Why 
showd not. the velvet turf attached to them be bordered with 
_ hedges, divided by gravel walks, tufted with flowers? It is easier 
to enforce habits of neatness and order among objects whose .

taste and value make them worthy of care than amid that par- 
simony of apparatus whose very pitiful means operates as a 
temptation to waste and destroy.’’ : 
It is in the poor, dilapidated, dust begrimed, filthy school- 
rooms that the spirit of vandalism asserts itself, for there is noth- 
ing there to command the respect of the boy. We believe it is as 
much the duty of the school to cultivate the aesthetic side of the 
child as it is to teach the multiplication table, or the single rule 
of three. 
We do not mean to sacrifice the healthfulness or utility of 
the school house for the beautiful, in the sense of building a 
three hundred dollar tower on a two hundred dollar house, but 
grace and symmetry may be wrought in the one-room school 
house just as easily as in the larger and more costly buildings. 
IMPORTANCE OF PROPER HEATING, LIGHT- 
ING AND VENTILATION. 
Heating. 
The proper heating and satisfactory ventilation of the school 
building, together with ample lighting, are items of first im- 
portance in school architecture. The ability of the teacher to 
manage and instruct, and of the pupil to observe proper de- 
portment and to study are influenced greatly by the temperature 
and purity of the air and the clearness of the light in whic 
they must work. An English authority has estimated that good 
ventilation, heating and lighting will add to the capacity of at- 
tention of pupils at least one-fifth as compared with that of pu- 
pils in imperfectly constructed schoolrooms. Not only are the 
mental capacity of the pupil and efficiency of the teacher les- 
sened by improper heating and ventilation, but the health of 
both is impaired, and the power to resist disease is weakened by 
living or working in impure air or in a temperature too high 
or too low, while many, if not most, of the cases of defective 
vision are due to imperfect lighting. ,

Liegsrina. 
Amount. 
The schoolroom cannot be too well lighted. It is uniformly 
agreed that the amount of transparent glass surface admitting 
light should be from one-sixth to one-fourth of the floor space 
of the room. In a sehoolroom 24x 30 feet the amount of glass 
surface in the windows should be at least 120 square feet, and 
this should be increased, if the house is shaded, or if the windows 
open toward the north, northwest, or northeast. 
Location and Direction. 
The most perfect lighting can be secured through skylights, 
but as this is impracticable in nearly all rooms, the next best 
method, that of having the windows to the left of the pupils, 
should be adopted. If light must enter from two sides, left and 
rear windows should be provided, and unless it is impossible to 
secure sufficient glass surface otherwise, the lower half of the 
rear windows should be closed. Windows at right and left are 
objectionable, and windows at front or rear only, should not be 
tolerated. 
Windows should be located in batteries, i. ¢., two or three 
side by side, rather than be distributed at equal distances apart 
the entire length and width of the room. 
The top of the window should extend entirely, or nearly to 
the ceiling, and the bottom should be slightly higher than pu- 
pil’s desk. 
: Shades. 
Window shades slightly darker than the walls should be pro- 
vided for all windows, and as the best light enters through the 
upper half of the windows, the shades should either roll from _ 
the bottom or should be adjustable. 
Venetian blinds, made of thin slats of ‘wood held in position. 
by tape and cords, are good to regulate the amount of light, but 
are expensive, not easily adjusted, and not durable. 
VENTILATION. 
Pure and Impure Air. 
Expired air differs from normally pure air as follows: It 
contains less oxygen, more carbonic acid gas, some organic mat- 
ter, and its humidity and temperature are increased. The car-
-P-A-G-E-39
—35— 
bonic acid gas, while not the most injurious element present in 
expired air, is not vitalizing, and is, as a rule, a good index to 
the impurity of the air. . 
The sense of smell may give a fairly good idea of the im- 
purity of air in an oceupied room. If, to a person entering a 
schoolroom from the outside air, there can be sensed a trace of 
odor of any kind or difference in point of freshness, it is certain. 
that the air is unfit to breathe, and that the room is imperfectly 
ventilated. 
Object. 
The object of ventilation is to secure for each person such a 
supply of fresh air that there may always be abundance of oxy- 
gen without any injurious accumulation of organic matter and 
carbonic acid gas. 
Needs. 
Using carbonic acid gas as a measure the need for ventilation 
is shown in the following problem: 
Ordinary air contains about 4 per cent of carbon dioxide. 
One person gives off about .6 of a cubic foot of carbon dioxide 
per hour Air to be fit for breathing should not contain more 
than .06 per cent of carbon dioxide. Then a room having 1,000 
cubic feet of space per person, and supplied with an additional 
2,000 cubic feet of fresh air per person per hour, satisfies the 
requirements of gocd ventilation. Each pupil should be sup- 
plied with this amount, or from 30 to 40 eubic feet per minute. 
In a schoolroom the air should be completely changed from six 
to eight times an hour. : 
Space. 
Each pupil should be given a floor space of at least 15 square 
feet—20 square feet is much better—and at least 200 cubic feet 
of air. The height of the ceiling should not be less than 12 feet 
nor more than 14 feet. 
HEATING. 
Proper Temperature, 
The temperature of the schoolroom should not fall below 65 
degrees Fahrenheit nor rise above 72 degrees; a uniform tem- 
perature of 68 or 70 degrees is usually considered the best. One 
or more thermometers should be placed in each room.
-P-A-G-E-40
  —36— 
Fireplaces. 
Fireplaces are gcod only for ventilation. They are wasteful 
of fuel, create drafts, and heat unevenly. 
" Stoves. 
In small buildings stoves of proper construction and size 
afford the most practical method of heating, and are most gen- 
erally used. Where a stove is used the following directions 
should be observed: 
(a) It should be placed: at one side or in a corner of the 
room near the outside door or doors. So placed it will maintain 
a more uniform temperature and will be less in the way. 
(b) It should be large. Large stoves do not require such 
constant attention, and give a more uniform heat. It should be 
large enough to make it unnecessary to heat it red hot on the 
coldest day, as in this condition it renders the air less pure. 
(e) It should be jacketed. These jackets can be made of 
sheet iron or tin at small cost. Beginning at the floor and ex- 
tending to a height of 5 or 6 feet, the jacket should nearly or 
entirely surround the stove at a distance of from 12 to to 18 
inches. A pipe or flue extending under ‘the floor to the outside 
of the building should be open between the stove and the jacket. 
This will supply fresh air for ventilation that will create a cir- 
culation in the room and be warmed before striking the pupils. 
The Grossius ventilating stove is so constructed that the air 
from the outside is carried into the room and warmed, distrib- 
uting an even temperature throughout. It is heavy, durable and 
economical, and with it an ordinary schoolroom can be warmed 
‘with one good firing in from 30 to 60 miautes. The No. 2 will 
warm. a room containing 5,000 cubie feet or even larger, and is 
listed at $40. For study halls a larger size could be used. 
CrenTRAL Heating Systems. 
In a large building a central heating system should be in- 
‘stalled. ‘Such a system is-not only less troublesome and less ex- 
pensive, but is more satisfactory in every way than stoves. While 
complete directions are not attempted here for the installation 
of a central heating plant, a few suggestions may prove helpful 
to superintendents and boards of education.
-P-A-G-E-41
—37T— | 
1. Furnace heating, while least desirable of all central sys- 
tems, may give fairly satisfactory results if properly installed. 
Objections that are urged against the furnace systems are: 
(a) The ever present danger of contaminating the air by 
poisonous gases. 
(b) The danger of overheating the air, thus rendering it 
unfit for breathing. / 
(ce) The diffieulty of properly and uniformly heating all 
the rooms. 
2. The direct-indirect method combines cheapness, simplic- 
ity and satisfies in a large measure hygienic requirements. Under 
favorable conditions, in a small building, this system will give 
satisfaction. 
3. The fan system, with direct or indirect heating, gives a 
plant that is most desirable for large buildings. While it has - 
some disadvantages and requires specialists in its installation 
and operation, the most certain and satisfactory results can be 
secured by its use. 
Fioors, 
The floor should be of first class material put down so as to 
leave no loose joints or open cracks, and if cracks appear later, 
they should be filled. The junction of the floor and wainscoting 
or surface should be finished with a cove or moulding so that 
sweeping and cleaning may be more thoroughly and quickly done. 
All floors should be made sound proof, and this is only par- 
tially accomplished with felt paper and double floors. _ 
CEILINGS. 
Wooden ceilings are objectionable, and should be used only 
where it is impracticable to have plastered walls.. Plastering 
makes the most hygienie and economical ceiling, and can be 
easily renovated when it becomes soiled and dusty by inexpen- 
sive water color wash easily prepared and applied even by an 
inexperienced workman. Papered walls are unsanitary and very 
expensive. 
CoLor or WALLS. 
The color of the schoolroom walls is of importance, and 
should not be entrusted to an inexperienced workman. No color
-P-A-G-E-42
—38— 
should be used that absorbs light to any appreciable degree, and 
other colors, such as yellow, that reflect fairly well, produce ner- 
vousness and fatigue, and should not be used. 
The ceiling should be white or nearly so, and authorities are 
agreed that a very light green tint is the best color for the walls. 
Light grays, bluish grays and bluish green are not objectionable. 
No strong colors should be used, red and yellow being partieu- 
larly injurious to the eyes and nerves. 
BLACKBOARDS. 
A schoolroom cannot be provided with too much blackboard, 
and all available space around the entire room should be used. 
Slate blackboard is to be preferred to any other kind. 
Where slate cannot be used, good blackboards can be made 
by pasting thick and tough manila paper on the wall, sizing it 
and then putting on evenly two or three coats of liquid slating. 
A fairly good blackboard can be made of cloth when properly 
prepared and slated. 
The ‘‘Hyloplate’’ blackboard is one of the best made. It is 
eomposed of wood pulp, paper and cement, treated with a coat- 
ing of slating. It is made on slabs in sizes of the spaces to be 
fitted, and is easily and inexpensively put up. It is made in 
two colors, black and green, and costs about one-third as much 
as slate, : 
Blackboard made by painting black a strip of plank ceiling 
is unfit for use, but boards made by slating cement plastering 
make a satisfactory surface, but are not durable. 
FRAMES. 
All blackboards of whatever kind should be inclosed in 
frames, and should be provided at the bottom with a trough from 
2 to 3 inches wide to hold chalk and collect chalk dust. 
Wrs. 
The width of blackboards should never be less than 314 feet— 
4 feet is better. 
Distance From Foor. 
_ They should be placed about 26 inches from the floor for 
primary grades, 30 inches for intermediate grades, and 36 inches 
for grammar grades. In one-room schools the blackboards should 
be placed 26 inches from the floor, and should be 41% feet wide.
-P-A-G-E-43

TEACHER’S PLATFORM. 
A. platform for the teacher’s desk is unnecessary, in the way, 
unsightly and unsanitary, and should not be put in any room, 
except in assembly kails where a platform or stage may be used 
to advantage. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
The Legislature for a number of years has appropriated the 
sum of $5,000 for the aid of State and County Institute work. 
The wisdom of this appropriation is clearly apparent when we 
consider that.a large number of public school teachers have had 
no professional training, and in many cases no academic in- 
struction in advance of that which he or she is expected to im- 
part. The State Institutes have been remarkably well attended, 
the enrollment for the past two years having reached more than 
1,800 each year. Add to this the number attending county in- 
stitutes that received State aid and it will be seen that nearly 
one-third of the teaching force of the State was reached through 
this fund. 
In order to promote uniformity and to direct the work of 
the institute along definite lines the State Superintendent pub- 
lished a syllabus to be used in State and County Institute work. 
In the preparation of the syllabus he was ably assisted by Miss 
Ethel Northern, Profs. H. A. Morgan; W. E. Miller, Josiah. 
Main, J. W. Sewell and Supt. S. G. Gilbreath. To all these dis- 
tinguished educators the Superintendent extends sincere thanks. 
The function of the institute and the scope of work attempted, 
together with suggestions, are set forth in the preface to the syl- 
labus as follows: 
Function or Instrrrures. 
Practically all institute instructors are agreed that the work 
of our State institutes should be made less academic, and should 
deal more largely with methods and management, and a discus- 
sion of the principles of pedagogy. However, each year we are 
focred to use twenty-five or thirty per cent of inexperienced 
teachers, and many of those who have previously taught are de- 
ficient in their academic training; therefore our course is neces- 
sarily a compromise between purely academic and purely pro- 
fessional work. 
It should be constantly borne in mind that the function of an
-P-A-G-E-44
—40— 
institute is to better prepare teachers for teaching and not to 
give them a fragmentary knowledge of the different subjects with 
a view of enabling them to stand an examination for a license to 
teach. . 
While it will be impossible to teach the whole of any given 
7 text in the ten or twenty days the institute is in session, yet 
there should be no lack of coherence in the work done. 
Lt There are two distinct types of institutes: one in which the 
conductor or instructor does all the talking and thinking, and, 
at best, this type can offer only entertainment to those in attend- 
ance; the other gives each individual member something to do, 
and converts the whole institute into an active, working body. 
It is needless to say that the latter mentioned is the only char- 
' acter of institute that is worth the cost of maintenance. The 
same systematized management that. characterizes a well regu- 
lated school should prevail in the institute. The program should 
not be disturbed or broken except for very urgent cause. The 
members of the institute should be as studious and responsive as 
thé students of a good school. The instructor should have defi- 
nitely in mind what he is to accomplish by each recitation, and 
should not permit the time to be wasted by a useless discussion 
of irrelevant matter. What an institute should accomplish is 
well set forth by State Superintendent Kr A. Cotton, of Indiana, 
in the following: 
“First. It should bring inspiration to the teachers. It should 
furnish higher ideals and more hopeful views of life. This must 
come largely from the personality of the instructors employed. 
Second. It should bring larger professional zeal. It should fur- 
nish higher professional ideas, and a larger, profounder belief in 
‘the calling. ‘This must come from the professional attitude of 
the instructors. Third. It should bring practical solutions to 
the everyday problems of teachings. It should furnish the best 
way to teach based upon pedagogical principles. _This must come 
from the scholarship and professional training of the instructors. 
Fourth. It should bring a week of happy social life, with a re- 
newal of friendship, and the acquisition of new friends. This 
must come from the superintendent, the community and the 
teachers themselves.” 
There will be two courses offered: one for the primary and 
one for the secondary teachers. The following subjects will be 
taught in the’ primary course, viz.: Agriculture, Arithmetic, 
Grammar, Geography, Physiology, U.S. History. Primary meth-
-P-A-G-E-45
—4— 
ods will be given by a practical primary teacher on all subjects 
embraced in the first three grades. Instruction will be given in 
the Reading Circle Course, which embraces for primary teachers, 
McNeil and Lynch’s Literature, and Kern’s Among Country 
Schools. 
The following subjects will be taught in the secondary course: 
Physiology, Agriculture, Rhetoric, Civics, Algebra, Physics. In. 
struction will be given in the Reading Circle Course, which em- 
braces for secondary teachers, Gilbert’s School and Its Life, and 
the four following pieces of literature : Shakespeare’s Julius Cesar 
(any edition), Tennyson’s Enoch Arden (any edition), Burke’s 
Speech on Conciliation with America (any edition), Scott’s Lady 
of the Lake (any edition). 
While we have in this year’s syllabus but few more than half 
the subjects required in each course, yet I am aware of the fact 
that we are attempting too many subjects even with this re- 
duction. 
Institute instructors and superintendents are urged to follow 
the course laid down as closely as practicable to the end that we 
may secure uniformity in our State and county institute work. 
In counties where there are but few secondary teachers, I am 
of the opinion it would be much better to maintain the primary 
course only, for, as a rule, the secondary teachers are better 
equipped for teaching their subjects than are the primary teach- 
ers for the elementary work. 
County Hicu Scxoots. 
Chapter 279 of the Acts of 1899, empowers the County Court 
“to provide for establishing and maintaining one or more county 
high schools for the instruction of the children of the county.” 
The measure further provides that a special tax ‘in addition to 
other taxes for school purposes, not to exceed 15 cents on the 
$100 on all taxable property, may be levied and collected for 
the maintenance of the high schools. 
The management and control of the county high school is 
vested in the County High School Board of Education, composed 
of seven members, six of whom are elected by the County Court,. 
the County Superintendent being ex-officio a member of the 
Board and Secretary thereof. The completion of the primary 
public school course is the legal entrance requirement. The 
course of study is prescribed by the Board of Education with the’
-P-A-G-E-46
—42— 
limitation that all the branches of study required to be taught 
in the secondary schools shall be taught in the high school. 
Thus it will be seen that the high school course has no definite 
limits and as a result each county is a law unto itself, some hav- 
ing two years’ courses, others three years and still others four. 
It would be well if the course of study was more clearly de- 
fined, and the high schools standardized and classified into first, 
second and third grade high schools. . While it would be desir- 
able to have a good four_years’ course in every high school, yet 
present conditions forbid it in some localities. , 
/ The following twenty-three counties have established high 
/schools in accordance with the provisions of the above act,-viz.: 
; Anderson, Campbell, Cheatham, Cocke, Fentress, Franklin, 
| Hamilton, Henry, Johnson, Knox, Lake, Lauderdale, Lawrence, } 
| 
\ \ McMinn, Meigs, Monroe, Montgomery, Rhea, Roane, Scott, | 
Shelby, Washington, White. : 
In these twenty-three counties there are 58 high schools, 
with a total enrollment of 3,167 pupils. In this report will be 
found a table ‘giving fuller information as to the conditions of 
\ high schools in the State. 
Our best educators are all agreed that we have reached a point 
in the development of our school system when the establishment 
of at least one high school in each county, standing at the hea& 
of the county system of education, is an imperative necessity. 
In order to stimulate the counties in their efforts to establish 
high schools, if the State would make a reasonable appropriation 
for this purpose, conditioned on the county’s raising so much of 
the fund, within two years we could have more than one hundred 
high schools in successful operation. It is not my purpose to. 
argue the necessity of a system of high schools here, but an in< 
vestigation will show that all the States that have developed am 
efficient system of schools have established good high schools. 
It is impossible for our State University, which stands at the 
head of the school system of the State, and must rely in a large 
measure upon the public schools for its pupils, to serve as large 
a number of students as the State should have in attendance, 
until more adequate provisions are made to meet college entrance 
requirements, 
. SUPERVISION. 
- Unquestionably, the greatest hindrance to the advancement. 
of our-public schools is a lack of more thorough county supervis-
-P-A-G-E-47
—~—43— 
ion. A County Superintendent should not only be a “person 
of literary and scientific attainments and of skill and experience 
in the art of teaching,” but he should also be a strong executive, 
a good organizer, and a leader of men. 
We have a number of competent superintendents who are 
paid a sufficient salary to devote all their time to the discharge 
of their official duties. Educational conditions are being rapidly 
improved in those counties. We have another class of superin- 
tendents who are thoroughly competent, but whose salary is too 
small to enable them to devote much time to the discharge of 
their duties. In these counties conditions can improve but 
slowly. 
There is spent on an average more than $30,000 annually for 
education in each county in Tennessee and the one who over- 
sees this expenditure and shapes the school policy—the County 
Superintendent—is paid on an average $549. 
It is not good business policy to employ a cheap man to direct 
the business affairs of any concern, nor is it good school policy 
to employ a cheap man to superintend the public schools. 
A Minimum Satary. 
The Legislature could render no better service to the schools 
of the State than to pass an act fixing a minimum salary for 
County Superintendents, the State paying a certain portion of 
the salary on condition that the county pay the remainder. 
Tue Cooperative Epucation AssociaTION oF TENNESSEE. 
On Aprial 26, 1907, the following letter was addressed to the 
leading school men, newspaper men and ‘business men of the 
State: : 
“NasHvi._x, April 26, 1908. 
“Dear Srr—You are most cordially invited to attend a meet- 
ing to be held in the Senate chamber, Nashville, Friday, May 3, 
1907, for the purpose of organizing a School Improvement Asso- 
ciation which shall have for its object the promotion of the cause 
of education in the State. 
“The State has done much by legislative enactment and 
more liberal financial support to improve the school system of 
Tennessee, and about seventy counties are paying as much as 40 
cents school tax on the $100. There are school problems, how-
-P-A-G-E-48
—44— 
ever, that cannot be solved by legislative enactment and appro- 
priations. The people themselves must be more thoroughly. 
aroused as to the part the community must play in fostering the 
school, 
“Asia rule, public school property is much neglected. The 
houses and grounds are poorly cared for and kept. The walls 
are bare and often dingy and dust begrimed. The school attend- 
ance is poor in some communities and the public is not realizing 
for its schools all that it is due. 
“There has been during the past year a vigorous education 
campaign waged in this State and much school sentiment has. 
been developed, but in order to realize the full benefit of this 
campaign it should be followed by an organization crystallizing 
the sentiment and directing it along proper lines of action. Your 
presence is most earnestly requested. 
“Sincerely, 
“R, L. Jonzs,

A representative body of citizens met in the Senate chamber 
May 3. Addresses were delivered by Gov. Patterson, Supt. 
Mynders, Prof. P. P. Claxton, Hon. R. M. Barton, Hon. Geo. M. 
Milton, and others. The outgrowth of this meeting was the 
formation of an organization to be styled ‘‘ The Cooperative Edu-

Hon. R. M. Barton, Judge Civil Court of Appeals, Chairman; 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, Chattanooga; Mr. O. C. Barton, Paris; Mr.

ciation of Tennessee, and shall be entitled to be represented in 
such association at all its meetings by delegates elected to this.  
-P-A-G-E-49

. association for that purpose, the basis of representation being one 
delegate for every fifty members or fraction thereof. We sub- 
scribe to and adopt the declaration of principles adopted by said 
association, which are as follows: 
The purpose of this organization shall be to promote the ed- 
ucational interests of Tennessee: : 
1. By arousing and directing public sentiment in favor of , . 
better schools of all grades, and more liberal support of same. | 
2. By promoting the establishment of a good system of coun- 
ty high schools. 
3. By encouraging more local support for the maintenance 
of elementary, secondary and high schools, and to enlist the in- 
terest of all the people of the State in the great movement for 
the better education of the children. 
4, By creating sentiment and devising plans for securing 
better attendance on the public schools. 
5. By better training of teachers for all grades of the public 
schools, and more liberal compensation for teachers and superin- 
tendents. 
6. By urging the adjustment of the courses of study to meet 
the demands of modern life. 
7. By creating ‘sentiment for reasonable consolidation of 
public schools. 
8. By the establishment and maintenance of school li- 
braries. 
9. By the improvement and beautifying of school houses 
and grounds and by the betterment of equipment. 
We pledge ourselves to promote, so far as possible, these 
principles. 
The membership of this association shall consist of all white 
persons who subscribe to these articles and signify their inten- 
tion to join the association. The membership fee shall be fifty 
cents annually, of which forty cents shall go into the local treas- 
ury and ten cents into the treasury of the State Association. 
Each member shall be entitled to one vote at all meetings of. 
this association. 
The officers of the association shall be a President, three Vice: 
Presidents, a Secretary and a Treasurer. 
There shall be the following standing committees: An Exec-- 
utive Committee, composed of the President and four additional 
 
-P-A-G-E-50

members, to be appointed by him; a Finance Committee, com- 
posed of members, to be appointed by the President; a 
Press and Publication Committee, composed of members, 
to be appointed by the President; a Library Committee, com- 
posed of members, to be appointed by the President; a 
Committee on School Houses and Grounds, composed of 
members, to be appointed by the President, and such other com- 
mittees as may from time to time be found necessary. 
There shall be four general meetings a year of this association, 
to be held at such time and place as the Executive Committee 
shall direct, and such special meetings as the President and the 
Executive Committee may deem it important to call. 
It shall be the duty of the Secretary of this association to send 
true copies of the proceedings of ‘all meetings of this association 
to the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Ten- 
nessee and to the Secretary of the Cooperative Education Asso- 
ciation of Tennessee.   
  
  
  
Associations have been formed in several counties and it is 
believed much good will grow out of them. 
In order to advance the interest of the Association the Execu- 
tive Committee has employed Miss Virginia P. Moore, of Galla- 
tin, to devote all her time in promoting the work of the Asso- 
ciation. : 
The Executive Committee, under the able leadership of Prof. 
P. P. Claxton, conducted an educational campaign during the 
summer and autumn of the present year, and large and successful 
school meetings were held in nearly every county in the State. 
Srate Norma ScHoo.s. 
No system of schools can be more efficient than the teaching 
force employed. One of the greatest elements of weakness in the 
public schools in this State is a lack of qualified teachers. A 
very large per cent of the public school fund is wasted each year 
by the employment of incompetent teachers. 
1 am not censuring school boards nor condemning County 
Superintendents for the above conditions; a County Superin- 
tendent cannot qualify teachers by holding rigid examinations. 
An examination only furnishes a means for eliminating the in- 
competent, but no examination, however difficult, can add any- 
thing to the qualification of the applicant. At best it can but 
serve as a standard for measuring his knowledge of subject mat-
-P-A-G-E-51
—47-- 
ter. There are not enough qualified teachers to teach the 
-publie schools of the State, hence many schools, if taught at all, 
must be taught by teachers whose equipment i is far short of 
what it should be. 
This State is paying annually over three and a quarter 
million dollars for the education of its children, and yet it is not 
providing any facilities for the professional training of teachers. 
During the present year I addressed a letter to the chief 
school officers of every State in the Union to ascertain what is 
being done in the way of providing facilities for the professional 
education of teachers. Replies were received from nearly all of 
the States, and Mississippi is the only State, with the exception 
of Tennessee, that is not providing some means fcr training 
teachers. Some of the States established normal schools a half 
century ago. It does not stand to reason that a State would 
make a mistake and then perpetuate it for a half century. If 
the establishment of normal schools is a mistake more than forty 
of our sister States have erred. 
It is the unanimous opinion of all the leading educators of 
the State that Tennessee should establish three normal schools 
for the training of white teachers, one to be located in each 
grand division of the State, and one for the colored to be located. 
in Middle or West Tennessee. The course of study in these 
schools should be adjusted to meet the conditions of modern life, 
and through their influence we could adjust the course of study ~ 
in the rural schools so as to best promote rural living. The cost 
to the State of maintaining these schools would be about $100,000 
per annum. 
Prasopy CoLLEGE For TEACHERS. 
The past two Legislatures have appropriated, each, $250,000 
for the purpose of securing a great teachers’ college to be located 
in this State. Through some complications, these appropriations 
were not accepted by the Peabody Board. This board on the 
acceptance of this appropriation will liberally endow the college 
and the State will be relieved of any further necessity or obliga- 
tion of making future appropriations for the maintenance of this. 
institution. Inasmuch as favorable action on the part of the 
Peabody Board seems assured, it would be a calamity to the State- 
if it should fail to again make this appropriation and thereby: 
lose this great institution of learning. 
There is no conflict between the work of teachers’ college andi
-P-A-G-E-52
—48— 
the normal schools referred to above. The function of the college 
is to train superintendents, principals and. high school teachers, 
while the function of the normal school is to prepare teachers 
for work in the elementary schools. The establishment of the 
one does not lessen the demand for. the other. There is room 
for both and a distinct field for each. 
Scuoot LiBRaRIEs. 
The most pitiable person in. the world, perhaps, is the one 
who is entirely illiterate, who knows nothing of the world’s past 
history and whose knowledge of the present is limited to the . 
narrow confines of his immediate community. The individual 
next most to be pitied is he who has the power to read and no 
desire to do so. His condition is but little better than the one 
first mentioned. At certain stages of the child’s life certain 
phases of literature appeal to it, and if it has placed into its 
hands good books suitable to its stage of mental development it 
will read those books with interest and pleasure and thus form the 
reading habit that will continue with it through life. Unfor- 
tunately, in a large number of homes, either through lack of abil- 
ity to purchase or knowledge to judge the character of books 
suited to child life, there is but little literature found thatin any 
- sense appeals to the child. In order to remedy this condition, 
more progressive States are furnishing reading matter to the 
children either through traveling libraries or the establishment 
of libraries in the public schools. 
I would recommend that the Legislature appropriate $7,500 
for the establishment of libraries; $2,500 of which shall be used 
in the establishment of traveling libraries, the remainder to be 
used in the purchase of books for rural school libraries, the State — 
appropriating to any rural public school $5 for library use, on 
condition that the community and the county in which the 
school is located shall each contribute an equal amount. The 
above expenditure would furnish a nucleus for one thousand 
rural libraries, and would place in circulation more than one 
hundred traveling libraries of fifty volumes each.

To the Members of the County Courts of Tennessee: 
The recent Legislature passed a measure entitled: 
“An Act to be entitled An Act to improve the public school sys- 
. tem of Tennessee by creating in each county a'County Board 
of Education and District Advisory Boards, and prescribing 
their duties and abolishing the office of District Directors.” 
Section 1 of this Act provides “That in each county of the 
State of Tennessee the office of District Directors shall be abol- 
ished, and that the schools shall be under the management and 
control of a County Board of Education and a District Board of 
Advisors, hereinafter to be provided for.” 
Section 2 provides “ That the County Court in each county of 
the State shall, at its session to be held the first Monday in July, 
1907, divide the county into five school districts, each represent- 
ing as nearly as practicable equal area of territory or the same 
number of inhabitants; Provided, that each of these school dis- 
tricts shall be composed of whole civil districts; and, provided 
further, that in counties having fewer than five civil districts, 
each civil district shall constitute aschool district, and a member 
of the said Board of Education be elected from each of the said 
districts, and the remaining member or members be elected from 
the county at large.” 
Section 3 provides “That one member from each of said school 
’ districts, and the other members aforesaid from the county at 
large, shall constitute said County Board of Education; provided, 
the County Superintendent shall be Secretary of the County 
Board of Education.” 
Section 4 provides “That the County Court in the several 
counties of the State, at its July term, shall elect 2 member of 
the County Board of Education from each of the school districts 
above mentioned; or where there be fewer than five districts, 
the necessary number, as provided for from the county at large, 
which County Board of Education shall qualify and organize 
within ten days after their election by electing one of their number 
chairman; provided further, That the members of the County 
Board of Education thus elected shall serve until September 1, 
1908, and that on the first Thursday of August, 1908, and bien- 
nially thereafter, each member of the County Board of Education 
shall be elected by the qualified voters of the district, above pro- 
vided for, and in counties with fewer than five districts the 
necessary number from the county at large, and the term of
-P-A-G-E-56
—50— 
office of members thus elected shall begin on the first day of Sep- 
tember next after said election, and their tenure of office shall 
be two years, or until their successors in office are duly elected 
and qualified.” 
Section 5 provides “ That any person shall be eligible to the 
office of member of the County Board of Education who is qual- 
ified by at least a primary education, such as the primary public 
school course, to perform the duties required, and who is a resi- 
dent of the district and a qualified voter therein. If he shall 
cease to be a resident thereof, his office shall be deemed vacant.” 
Section 9 provides “That the County Superintendent, as 
ex officio Secretary of the County Board of Education, be required 
to give bond, to be approved by the Chairman of the County 
Court, to the amount of. $500, for the faithful discharge of his 
duties.” 
Under the provisions of this Act, the office of District Direc- © 
tor is abolished July 1, 1907, and it devolves upon the County 
Court, at its July term— 
First—To divide the county into five school districts, in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of the Act. 
Second—To elect a County Board of Education of five mem- 
bers, who shall be charged with the management of the county 
schools, and to perform in general the functions heretofore exer- 
cised by the District Board of Directors. 
Third—In Section 5 the qualifications for membership on 
the County Board are defined. 
This does not mean that a candidate for membership on this 
Board shall undergo an examination in the primary school 
course, but persons selected should have thorough business qual-_ 
ifications, a live interest in school work and a discriminating 
judgment that will enable them to measure the relative value 
of teachers. The success of this measure depends largely upon 
the character of the Board entrusted with the enforcement of 
the law. This law produces a revolution in school administra- 
tion and renders it possible to accomplish more within a few 
years for the advancement of education than was possible to ac- 
complish under the old regime of district directors in a genera- 
tion. On the other hand, if Boards with selfish or sinister 
motives are elected, with the increased and centralized power 
‘ granted them, they should make the schools means whereby 
selfish and sinister ends are reached, they would do more harm 
to the cause of education than could be repaired in a lifetime.
-P-A-G-E-57
—51—. 
This school measure has the endorsement of all the leading 
educators of the State, and carries with it the authority to unify 
and systematize the schools of the county. Under the old system 
it frequently happened that the schools of one district would have 
a three months term and those of another a nine months term, 
and yet both schools had the same course of study and were 
attempting to do the same work. We believe that all the people 
of the county should contribute equally to the support of the 
the schools and ali should share equally in the benefits derived 
therefrom. 
Asa rule, it is safe not to elect men to school positions who 
are overzealous in seeking them, because the small remunera- 
tion which this Act provides (see Section 12, ‘That each mem- 
ber of the County Board of Education shall receive not less than 
one dollar and fifty cents per day, nor more than three dollars’ 
per day, as determined by the County Court, for not niore than 
thirty days in a year”) is not sufficient inducement from a 
monetary standpoint to secure suitable talent for organizing and 
operating a system of schools. The class of office-seekers who 
are hunting for a small salary should be studiously avoided. 
This act greatly increases the work of the County Superin- 
tendent, who is required— 
1. To issue all warrants authorized by the County Board of 
Education upon the County Trustee for the expenditures of the 
public school fund, and to sign the same, together with the 
Chairman of the Board. 
2. To make a written report to the County Court quarterly 
of all expenditures of the public school fund by items, which 
amounts shall be audited by the County Judge and Auditing 
Committee of the County Court. 
3. To keep in well bound books, to be furnished by the 
county, a full and accurate record of each meeting of the County 
Board of Education, and accounts of all financial transactions, 
which books shall be kept in the office of the County Superin- 
tendent. 
It can be readily seen that he is entrusted with keeping the 
official accounts of all the school moneys of the county, and in. 
addition to that, as ex officio Secretary of the County Board of 
Education, he is required to give bond, subject to the approval 
of the County Chairman, to the amount of $500, for the faithful 
performance of his duties. We feel sure the wisdom of your 
body will see fit to pay him a salary commensurate with the in-
-P-A-G-E-58
—52— 
creased services required of him. A County Superintendent 
should be an educational Jeader and should devote his entire 
time to the discharge of his duties, and should be paid in keep- 
ing with the high qualifications demanded. It is poor economy 
to secure an incompetent leader in any enterprise, even if his 
services could be had for nothing. 
This law is not an experiment. . It has been tried in Mont- 
gomery County for four years, and under its operation the school 
‘terms of the county have been increased from 134 days to 160 
days without increasing the rate of taxation or diminishing 
teachers’ salaries. Lauderdale County also has had in successful 
operation the County Board system for the past two years. 
Neither of these counties could be ipduced, under any considera- 
tion, after having tried the County Board system to return to the 
old system of district directors. This law applies to every county 
in the State except Montgomery, Lauderdale, Tipton, and David- 
son, which are operating under special County Board laws, and 
Obion, Putnam, Moore, Smith, Wilson, Warren, Giles, and Lewis, 
which are exempt from its operations. 
The hearty support of County Courts throughout the State is 
most earnestly solicited to give the new law a fair and impartial 
trial; and. judging from the beneficent results where it has been 
tried, with the cordial support of the public, the success of the 
measure is assured. 
Yours very truly, 
R. L. Jonzs, 
State Superintendent. 
The County Courts divided the counties into school districts, 
and elected the Board of Education in accordance with the pro- 
visions of this act. 
A comparison of the educational progress made in the State 
under the operations of the County Board law clearly demon- 
strates the wisdom of itsenactment. The school people are prac~ 
tically unanimous in their approval of its workings; and the 
only opposition to the law comes from a few counties where the 
public mind has been prejudiced against it, or where the law hag 
not been given a fair trial. 
A comparison of the school conditions as given in this re- 
. port for the years ending June 30, 1907, and June 30, 1908, does 
not furnish a fair comparison for determining the successful 
operation of the County Board law. While this law did not go
-P-A-G-E-59
into effect until July 1, 1907, and in a large majority of counties 
the retiring district directors had employed teachers for the 
school year ending June 30, 1908, and in order to avoid friction, 
the County Boards for the first year ratified those contracts. 
Reports received from counties for the present scholastic year 
indicate more rapid educational progress than any previour year. 
It is the concensus of opinion among County Superintendents 
that the county system is a more economical method of school 
administration than the district system. Reports of the working 
of this law received in this office for the present year—the first 
year in which the efticacy of the law has really been tested—show 
that the school terms have been increased in sixty counties, and 
that teachers’ salaries have been increased from $1 to $10 per 
month in sixty-six counties 
This law promotes consolidation; and a large number of 
small, weak, inefficient schools have been combined into strong 
schools, which are now taught by competent teachers, with a 
school term greatly increased in length. 
School conditions are practically uniform in Tennessee; and 
we should have a uniform system of education. We have in op- 
eration three distinct systems—the old District Director system, 
which applies to seven counties, and the special County Board 
law, applying to three counties, and the remaining counties of 
the State operating under the general County Board school law. 
These three systems are not only confusing, but they increase the 
expense in the way of furnishing school supplies to the different 
counties from the Department of Public Instruction. It neces- 
sitates getting out three different sets of blanks, reports, etc., and 
destroys the unity of the school system. Believing that the op- 
eration of the County Board law is satisfactory, and that the 
schools are making more rapid advancement under it than under 
the old District Director system, I recommend that it be extended 
to the entire State. In changing our method of school adminis- 
tration from the district to the county, this State is only keeping 
pace with the progress of our sister Southern States.. Louisiana, 
Georgia, North Carolina, and Kentucky all have County Board 
Jaws, and the States that are now operating under the old District 
Director system are clamoring for a change.

ConcLUusION. 
In conclusion, I desire to thank all school officers and teach- 
ers for their loyal support and hearty cooperation in all our 
efforts for the improvement of the public school system of Ten- 
nessee, and especially do I thank your Excellency for the aid and 
encouragement you have given the cause of education for the 
past two years. 
Sincerely yours, 
R. L. Jonas, 
State Superintendent.

SUMMARY 
The summary shows an increase in population for the 
year ending June 30, 1908, over the preceding year of 10,009. 
According to this report about 75 per cent of the scholastic 
population can read and write. 
Almost 7% per cent of the total population have just 
reached the age of six, and have not been in school at all. A 
large number of children, very wisely, are not permitted by 
their parents to enter school until they reach the age of seven 
or eight years. All these things considered, the showing, 
while not entirely satisfactory, is creditable. 
Table No. III shows the total enrollment in ali the public 
schools to be 507,887. This represents a gain over the pre- 
ceding year of 12,158. ‘Tio this total should be added 25,461 
‘Tennessee pupils enrolled between the age of six and twenty- 
one who are attending private or parochial schools. This 
makes a total enrollment in all schools of 533,348. ; 
This would indicate that there are 243,286 pupils of school 
age who never see inside the school room. ‘This fact, how- 
ever, must be taken into consideration, as previously stated, 
a large number of children are not placed in school at all until 
they reach the age of seven or eight years, and still fewer 
names are found on our public school registers of pupils who 
have reached the age of eighteen. In fact,‘ most students 
have either completed the elementary public school courses 
or their student life has closed before they have reached the 
age of eighteen; but making due allowance for all this, it is 
conservative to say there are at least 75,000 pupils of school 
age who should be in school, who are not enrolled in any 
school. 
Table IV indicates a decrease in daily attendance of 10,511 
over the preceding year.. I do not think this is due to the 
fact that fewer children were in daily attendance, but it is 
tather the result of more accurate reports prepared by the 
County Superintendents, made possible by the County Board 
Law. County Superintendents, who formerly relied upon in-
-P-A-G-E-64
—58— 
formation received from the clerk of the district board of 
directors, now receive their reports direct from the teachers, 
which guarantees a greater degree of accuracy. 
The enrollment by grades as shown by Table V indicates 
a decided increase in the more advanced grades. This is one 
of the most hopeful signs of progress. As the efficiency of 
the schools increase, and the interest in education grows, the 
longevity of the student life will be prolonged and more 
pupils will remain to complete the course. 
Tables VII and IX will show an increase in the number 
of teachers, and a decrease in the number of schools. This 
is very encouraging, for the increase in number of schools 
has done more to retard the progress of education in some 
communities than can be repaired in a lifetime. We need 
fewer and better schools. 
There were 190 new school houses erected during the year 
at a total cost of $388,545. 
There has been an increase in both the length of school 
term and teachers’ salaries, and a decided increase in the 
number of voluines in public school libraries. 
The enrollment and attendance at the teachers’ institutes 
have been better than ever before. 
The following summaries show the operations of the pub- 
lic schools of the State by counties and cities for the year 
ending June 30, 1908, and also give a comparison with the 
year ending June 30, 1907:

In Memoriam 
—— 
MORGAN C, FITZPATRICK 
Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, the son of Joel and L. 7. 
Fitzpatrick, was born in Smith County, October 29, 
1868, and died at St. Thomas Hospital, Nashville, 
June 25,1908. He comes of one of our best Tennes- 
see families—pioneer stock—frugal, industrious, moral, 
and patriotic; from which virtues we usually reap @ 
harvest of loyal and good citizenship.. There were 
ten in the family—eight boys and two girls—all of 
whom being reared in the country were well tutored in 
that old theory that “honest toil by the sweat of the 
brow” was the priceless heritage of parent to child. 
Morgan, the fourth son in seniority, being reared 
in the country enjoyed but few educational _Oppor- 
tunities in his younger days, as at that time our rural 
schools were few, and the course of instraction limited 
and inferior. Yet so eager was he in the pursuit of ~ 
an education that he heeded not obstacles, but by his 
own individual efforts and close and continued applica- 
tion to his books, even while a plowboy on the farm, 
we find him pressing forward toward his treasured 
ideal, and soon taking a high position among the teach- 
ers of his county.. By strict economy as a teacher 
he was enabled to complete his academic course in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
—166— 
splendid schools of Lebanon, Ohio, and through the 
same means we later find him in the Law Department 
of the Cumberland University, from which he was 
graduated with honors in 1891. 
Having selected Hartsville as his home, he began 
the practice of law, his chosen profession. Here he 
toiled and plodded, counting no obstacle too great or 
‘hardship too severe to be met, and with that unyield- 
ing determination and ardent purpose so characteristic 
of the man we find him forging steadily to the front and 
‘making himself felt in whatever he undertook. His 
people, recognizing his ability and energy, persuaded 
him to accept the position of County Superintendent 
of Public Schools, @ position that he filled with credit 
to himself and profit to the county. 
In 1894 he was happily married to Miss Margaret 
Debow, of Hartsville, who, with one daughter, now 
survives him. Truly this good woman through all of 
his promotions and disappointments has been a wife 
and a companion in “spirit and in truth;” whether in 
adversity or prosperity we find her steadfast and true, 
In the November election of 1894 he was chosen 
to represent the floterial district of Sumner, Wilson, 
and Trousdale. This was the beginning of his politi- 
“eal career; and we can truthfully say that in the last 
three decades of Tennessee history no man has risen 
more rapidly to prominence and honor than he of 
whom we write. 
‘In 1896 he was returned to the Legislature from 
the same district, and was elected Speaker of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
—167— 
House of the General Assembly of 1897, being then 
only twenty-eight years of age. ‘Here he became con- 
spicuous as a leader and a parliamentarian, and was 
regarded as one of the ablest legislative presiding of- 
ficers Tennessee ever had. This judgment has been 
confirmed in the years that have elapsed since then. 
He handled the gavel with a dexterity that astonished 
his older associates, and by his quick responses and 
judicious decisions readily achieved an influence and 
, commanded a following that made him prominent 
throughout the State. 
In the spring of 1898 he had charge of the Hon. 
Benton MeMillin’s candidacy for the Democratic 
nomination for Governor, and after the convention was 
made Chairman of the State Executive Committee, 
which responsible position he so well filled as to add 
new laurels to his fame. 
In 1899 he was appointed State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, which position he held for four 
years creditably and honorably. During his adminis- 
tration new life and vigor were given to our public 
schools. State Institutes were increased in number, 
the curriculum of the schools advanced, the Uniform - 
Text Book Law was enacted and put into execution, 
and all along the educational line a new strength was 
developed, a deeper interest awakened, and a more 
thorough advancement made possible. 
In 1902, after a hotly contested fight, he was nom- 
inated for Congress, and in November was duly elected, 
representing the Fourth Congressional District; but 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
—168— 
owing to ill-health he found himself unable to perform 
the duties of this high position satisfactorily, and after 
the expiration of his two years did not offer for re- 
election. This closed the bright political career of a 
young man who had but few equals in our State. 
In 1907 he moved to Gallatin that he might edu- 
 eate his daughter, and to resume the practice of his 
profession. 
The remainder of this short and eventful life was 
spent in battling with great suffering and continuous 
disease; and yet through it all we find but little 
murmuring or complaint, but rather an exhibition of 
calm resignation and a gentle patience, the climax of 
his many virtues. As « private citizen he was always 
deeply interested in the welfare of his people; as a 
public official he was steadfast in the performance of 
his every duty, and retired from official life with a 
character spotless and unblemished. In social life he 
was genial and inviting; as a friend he was true to 
every obligation, ready to condone faults or to forgive 
indiscretions. He really counted himself in nothing 
else so happy as in remembering his good friends. He 
loved and delighted to serve them, and there was no 
sacrifice so great that he was not ready to make when 
a friend was in need or a favor to be granted. As a 
son and a brother he was dutiful and affectionate; as 
a husband and father his generous soul overflowed 
with sweetest and tenderest expressions of love and 
affection, thereby cementing in closer and holier ties 
that marital and parental devotion that so beautifully 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
—169— 
adorns the home, and makes life a sweet and joyous 
reality. About his hearthstone, so simple and beau- 
 tiful, pleasure and contentment loved to dwell, and to 
those who entered that happy circle there was always 
a sweet and gracious welcome. 
This kind-husband and father, this generous asso- 
ciate and friend, this noble and patriotic citizen, we 
. shall know him no more forever. How strange that 
one so young and promising should be cut down at 
the very threshold of his usefulness! Why not to him 
the future’s greater life, wreathed in garlands of love 
and honor? Why not the allotted “threescore years 
and ten?” To which we can only answer, “God 
moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.” 
“ His will, not ours, be done.” Into the gracious and 
protecting care of Him who “doeth all things well,” 
we commit the spirit of our departed friend. 
Be it resolved, That we, the members of the Tennes- 
see Public School Officers’ Association, deeply deplore 
his loss, and shall ever treasure our past associations, 
and remember with deep gratitude his labors for the 
advancement of the educational interests of our State. 
Be it further resolved, That we tender our deep- 
est sympathy to his widow and daughter, and that a 
copy of these resolutions be furnished the widow, and 
same be printed in the published proceedings of this 
meeting. Cuas. 8. Dovenas, Chm.,

REPORTS OF STATE INSTITUTES FOR THE YEAR 1908 
MURFREESBORO STATE INSTITUTE. 
Facunry. 
P. A. Lyon, C. Herbert Walker, Fred J. Page, J. S. Batey, 
Josiah Main and Miss Helene Graff Wise constituted the faculty, 
and each one was faithful in the performance of all assigned 
duties, and all contributed to the success of the institute. P. A. 
Lyon conducted the institute; C. Herbert Walker acted .as sec- 
retary to the faculty, and Miss Annie Mansion served efficiently 
as secretary of the institute. 
Location. 
Murfreesboro proved an ideal location for the institute. No 
city in the State could offer superior advantages. The Tennes- 
see College building, one of the newest, most modern, handsome 
and best equipped school buildings in the South, was turned over 
completely to the institute for the use of the teachers, and the 
management neglected no opportunity to make the stay of the 
teachers as pleasant as possible. The majority of the faculty 
and teachers boarded in the college building.

tute at Murfreesboro, and he was strongly urged to locate one at 
the same place next year. Respectfully submitted,

MADISONVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
That the Madisonville State Institute was a success is shown 
by the statistical report. Of the total enrollment, 133, 91 per 
eent, or 121, took the examination, while the average daily at- 
 - tendance for twenty days was 106. 
Of those taking the examination, three were given Roll of 
Honor certificates and fifty-six received primary certificates. Of 
the remainder, 34 made an average grade of from 75 to 85, and. 
were recommended to the County Superintendent for temporary 
license. / . 
A comparison of the 1908 institute with the one held in Madi- 
sonville in 1907 shows a gratifying gain. The attendance the 
first year was less, and only twenty-four received State certifi- 
eates.. An institute with a large enrollment and only a few tak- 
ing the examination is largely a failure, and shows a lack of 
vital and productive interest. 
Supt. Parks, Hon. W. Morris Harrison, Chairman of’ the 
County Board of Edueation, the members of the board and of 
the County Court and the citizens generally gave the institute 
eordial support throughout.

LEXINGTON STATE INSTITUTE. 
I herewith submit; my report for the State Institute held at 
Lexington June 15 to July 10. I must say for the faculty you 
gave me that they did their work with zeal and fidelity to their 
profession. Profs. J. H. Bayer and J. O. Brown are school men 
of ability and adapt themselves to the institute work with ease. 
Miss Solly is the best lady instructor I have ever seen in a State 
Institute and took the institute bodily into her magic sway. 
The people of Lexington did themselves proud in taking care 
of the large crowd present and showing their great interest in 
the work. . . 
The student body was a great improvement over the preced- 
ing year, and I feel that much good was done for the eause of 
education by this month’s work.

GREENEVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
The following I most respectfully submit as my report of the 
State Institute held at Greeneville, Tenn., commencing June 15 
and closing July 10, 1908: 
The faculty consisted of C. 8. Douglass, Conductor ; Cc. P. 
Jester, W. E. Miller and. J. C. Fooshee. 
The location of the institute for a second term at Greeneville 
was wise and appropriate and was deeply appreciated both by 
the teachers and pecple.- The opening was very propitious and 
enjoyable, and quite a number of the citizens joined heartily in 
the exercises. June 16 found the faculty regularly at work and 
the teachers ready to cooperate, and to the very close a deep in- 
terest was manifested, and good honest work was done. The 
many failures on examination is attributable to there being so 
many young applicants, who had never taught and knew com 
paratively nothing of school requirements. Our environments 
necessitated the adoption of two lessons per day—from 8:30 to 
11:45 a. m., and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. Thirty minutes were given 
to each recitation, which was conducted by actual board work, 
as also by leeture. My assistants did their work most admirably, 
all of them being gentlemen of scholarly attainments, with a 
ripe experience in school work. 
The enrollment reached 230 actual teachers, for we admitted 
no others. In primary 224, and six in secondary; 80 took pri- 
mary examination, only 29 passing. In secondary 6, with 2 re- 
ceiving Roll of Honor. But few certificates were renewed, and 
those strictly under the requirements of the law. 
Prof. Dugger, the County Superintendent, was always at his 
post, and indeed, was a strong factor in making the institute 
a success. - , 
Miss Arthur, of the Peabcdy College, a quick, energetic and 
competent teacher, knew her work well and was always ready 
to lend her best energies toward the best interest of the institute. 
Profs. Wallace of Arkansas, Brister of Peabody, and Jeffries 
of Carson and Newman, were, with us in splendid lectures, which 
ereated a healthful enthusiasm in our session. 
We regretted very much that the State Superintendent could
-P-A-G-E-195
—183— 
not visit this institute, as both teachers and citizens were sorely 
disappointed, having looked forward with much interest to an 
address from him. 
In conelusion I would say that the institute was a success; 
“that much good was accomplished, and a deep interest was 
aroused among the people and the teachers. I am satisfied that 
the plan adopted of sending out uniform questions is a good one, 
as also that of teaching methods rather than-the text book. I 
feel that our very worthy State Superintendent has done his 
whole duty, and but a few years will have passed until he shall 
be rewarded in a rich and glorious harvest. : 
C. S. Doverass, 
Conductor.

MILAN STATE INSTITUTE. 
As Conductor of the State Institute held at Milan, June 16 
to July 10, 1908, I submit the following report: 
There were enrolled in the institute 411 teachers. Of this 
number Gibson County furnished an even 200. The other 211 
eame from more than 20 counties in Middle and West Tennessee. 
The class of teachers seemed better than usual. While there were 
some too young to teach there was a larger per cent of mature 
teachers than usual. The scholarship of the body was also an 
improvement on the institute of the same section a year before. 
The teachers manifested great zeal and enthusiasm in the work 
and a desire for better scholarship and more and better profes- 
sional training was everywhere evident. 
Milan is an ideal place for a State Institute. It has ample 
railroad facilities. The people are as hospitable as ever enter- 
tained a body of strangers in their midst. Their homes, which 
are elegant and commodious, were thrown wide open. In my ex- 
perience as an institute worker I have not known the teachers 
better or more pleasantly cared for and entertained. The town 
is beautifully and conveniently situated, and the school buildings 
and accommodations are all that could be desired. 
Supt. J. B. Cummings, Supt. C. W. Anderson and Miss Mat- 
tie Butler are willing and efficient helpers. Any Conductor of a 
State Institute who may have their assistance will be fortunate. 
The institute thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the work 
in agriculture by Prof. Main, of the University of Tennessee. 
Milan is in a splendid agricultural section, and the work done in 
this line will bring forth beneficial results. 
The institute faculty, the teachers of the institute and the 
people of Milan were much gratified.to have Tennessee’s able 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction present one day, and 
all were pleased and helped by his splendid and practical address. 
Although the institute adopted resolutions on the subject, as 
Conductor I desire tc mention and to thank personally, for very 
valuable assistance, Supt. J. B. Cummings, of Gibson County, 
who induced 200 of his teachers to attend, and who rendered wise 
counsel in all matters; Supt. E. HE. Ellis, of the Milan Public
-P-A-G-E-197
—185— 
School, who was untiring in his efforts and who never lost an 
opportunity to help; also the splendid entertainment committee, 
headed by Mr. Johu Denney and Misses Lena Mills and Wick 
Stone, who met all trains, who secured homes for all and who 
made the stay in Milan a pleasure. The success of the institute 
was largely due to their efforts and assistance. 
RESOLUTIONS. 
“We, the teachers in attendance and the instructors of ‘the 
Milan State Institute, in this our last regular assembly, desire 
to express our hearty appreciation of the kindness and hospi- 
tality shown us during our stay in the city of Milan. We would 
especially remember— 
“‘First—The efficient and faithful work of the Committee on 
. Homes, who domiciled so large an institute so pleasantly that 
no one could criticise or complain. 
““Second—Our hosts themselves, who spared no pains for our 
comfort, and whose generous hospitality cannot be surpassed. 
“‘Third—Supt. Ellis, who was ever alert and ready to render 
all possible efficient service in making the institute a great 
success. 
‘‘Fourth—Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Davis for their presence and 
help in directing the music of our opening exercises. . 
‘‘Fifth—Rev. J. TI. Baker, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, 
whose helpful interest was a great benefit and pleasure to us all. 
“Sixth—Mayor Rust, the city officials, the postmaster and 
his assistants, all of whom contributed much-to our pleasure and 
convenience. In view of all which be it 
“‘Resolved, That we respectfully request Supt. R. L, Jones to 
place our institute at Milan again next year. 
‘*Respectfully submitted, 
“©. L. Riprines, 
“J. B. Cummines, 
“C. W. ANpERSON, 
““Committee.”’ - 
The above resolutions were unaimously adopted.
-P-A-G-E-198
—186— 
Sua@EstIons. 
First—As Conductor I heartily approve the uniform exami- 
nation for all State Institutes as adopted by the present State 
Superintendent, and would suggest that if possible such instruc-- 
tions be. given conductors and instructors as will bring about, as 
nearly as possible, uniformity in grading papers and issuing 
certificates. . 
Second—Some plan ought to be adopted for those who hold 
four-year Honor Roll certificates whereby they could take the 
Reading Circle work yearly without going to State Institutes and 
yet make their certificates good in all the counties of the State. 
Third—That better professional training be furnished the , 
teachers and that a higher grade of qualification be required. 
This training should be under the control and supervision of the 
State Superintendent and the-State Board of Education. Of 
course it would be best if the State would make appropriations * 
for this. If not the State Board could establish normal schools, 
adopt plans, courses, etc., under the present law, and these 
schools properly managed could be made self sustainmg. The 
State now looks largely to self sustaining schools for a supply of 
teachers. Under the plan here proposed it would be better as 
the schools could be run under the supervision of the State Su- 
perintendent and State Board of Education.

CLARKSVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
I beg to submit the following report of the State Institute 
conducted at Clarksville from June 15 to July 10, 1908: 
Before the date for the institute to begin the subjects had 
been assigned and all arrangements made for the regular work 
to begin the first morning. The division of the work gave Prof. 
J. W. Sewell, Grammar, Rhetoric, Second Year School Manage- 
ment, First Year Literature and Second Year Literature; Prof. 
J. K. Marshall, Agriculture, Algebra, American History and 
Physics; Miss Charlotte Armstrong, Primary Reading, Spelling, 
Writing, Primary Arithmetic and Primary Language; Supt. P. 
L. Harned, Geography, Arithmetic, Physiology, Civil Govern- 
ment and First Year-School Management. Messrs. Webb and 
‘Ware were kind enough to send Miss Garrett to teach Drawing. 
The new high school building in which the institute was con- 
ducted is an ideal building in every respect and so well equipped. 
that it was a genuine pleasure to use its conveniences, enabling 
the instructors to do their work systematically and accurately ; 
and here the Conductor desires to give the recognition due the 
instructors for the high grade work they did throughout the en- 
tire term. 
While the enrollment of real ‘applicants for teacher’s cer- 
tificates was only 112, it would have been hard to find a more 
earnest body of workers. The small enrollment will be better 
understood when I state that in-every adjoining county an in- 
stitute or teacher’s examination was in progress during the time 
the State Institute was being conducted. 
The resolutions prepared and adopted by the teachers, among 
other things, expressed gratitude to the State Superintendent 
for locating the institute at Clarksville; to the press, the min- 
isters and the hospitable people of the town. They also unani- 
mously endorsed the recent act of the Legislature changing the 
public school system from a district to a county unit, and dis- 
placing the district directors, electing in their place a County 
Board of Education. | -

Tue Facuury. 
It was’made apparent after the second day’s work that the 
size of the faculty was entirely too small to do the best work for 
so large a body of. teachers. The enrollment was 202, with only 
three members of the faculty to do the work. Assistants had to 
be solicited in order to cover all the subjects. These assistants 
did efficient service without pay from the State, and I wish to 
commend them to your favorable consideration in case you may 
ever have opportunity to use them in county or State work. I 
refer to Messrs. F. A. Randals and R. H. Brown, and Mrs. Cora 
C. Fields. 
Praru HicH ScHoou. 
This building makes an ideal place for holding institutes for 
colored teachers. The school is centrally located and is easy of 
access from all parts of the city. The building is a handsome 
two-story brick structure, with large halls. and commodious reci- 
tation rooms. The desks, blackboards and other equipment are 
good and the halls well lighted and ventilated. The campus 
about the building was carpeted with green, the trees were in 
foliage and furnished the teachers a picturesque, spacious and 
shady lounging place during recess and after school hours. 
There was an uplifting and educative atmosphere about the 
place that had a wholesome influence on the teachers. 
ATTENDANCE. 
I am glad to be able to report to you that the attendance was 
large. The register shows a total enrollment of 202, with 30. 
males and'172 females. The per cent of attendance was 94. 
The quality of the teachers was above the average as well as the 
quantity. Each teacher entered heartily into the work and gave 
the faculty hearty support. There was a lack of that timidity 
and bashfulness which is so often observed in county teachers 
when called upon to recite in public. There was a disposition on 
the part of every teacher to get the greatest benefit out of the 
institute. . 
Counties REPRESENTED. 
Sixteen different counties were represented in this institute: 
Davidson, Williamson, Maury, Rutherford, Sumner, Wilson,
-P-A-G-E-209
—195— 
Robertson, Cheatham, Montgomery, Hiekman, Stewart, Bedford, 
Giles, Lincoln, Henderson and Smith. Many of these counties 
_ chad more than one representative, who took an active part in the 
work of the institute. 
RESOLUTIONS. 
Resolutions were adopted endorsing Prof. R. L. Jones, our 
efficient State Superintendent, for the faithful work he has done 
in behalf of the public schools of the State. Also in commenda- 
tion of the faculty and endorsing their appointment for another 
year. Thanks were extended the City Board. of Education for 
the use of Pearl High School, and Mrs. 8. A. King for her ex- 
cellent service at the organ.

KNOXVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
While there were many who attended our various sessions 
and did not see fit to register, we find that 105 were enrolled. 
Since some time has elapsed since a State Institute was held 
here quite a majority preferred to take primary work. But the 
average scholarship displayed in each department was quite 
above results attained in 1902. Ripened thought reduced dis- 
cussion and carping criticism to a minimum; so friction was 
avoided. 
Primary Work. 
Deep i interest was displayed by the teacher appointed, Miss 
Myrick, and her work was well received. She was very me- 
thodical and painstaking, and as a reward, has been asked to 
give her work elsewhere. 
Prmary—SECONDARY. 
The remainder of the work had to be divided between Mr. 
Yett and myself. in making the division Mr. Yett had seven 
* recitations daily, viz.: Agriculture, arithmetic, grammar, geog- 
raphy, Kern (Amorg Country Schools), U. 8. History, Civies. 
There remained eight: Physics, algebra, Gilbert (School and 
its Life), rhetoric, physiology, McNeil and Lynch’s literature, 
reading classies and analysis of literature. The work was very 
heavy, both from amount of preparation required and exactions 
necessary to advanced work. But the classes took up the work 
with eagerness, and there was no lack of zeal, if- there was of | 
ability. 
ADDRESSES. 
‘We were favored with the presence of Supt. Mynders, Prof. 
Cate, Dr. Patterson, Dr. Hodge and Dr. Rives, all of whom de- 
livered inspiriting eddresses. “The minister’s union adjourned 
and visited us in a body. They entertained us with wit, wisdom 
and eloquence. 
. Soca, Features. 
During the session a reception was given in honor of out of © 
town visitors, or popularly speaking, nonresidents. After the 
rendition of an excellent program the guests were served with 
light refreshments.

THE Press. 
Both ‘daily papers, the Journal and Tribune, as well as The 
‘Sentinel, gave succinct accounts of the work. This was also 
true of The Review, a weekly publication. 
Tue AFTERMATH, 
Now, sir, the entire county is enthused along the educational 
lines pursued in the syllabus. The Summer School of the South 
has given us of its oil, and our lamps are trimmed and brightly 
burning. The good accomplished is not to be seen in a day nor 
‘summed up in dollars and cents, yet rest assured that no in- 
‘stitute in these parts has been productive of more fruitful re- 
sults. And, sir, it is to you that we tender thanks, together with 
the local Superintendents, Prof. Cate and Prof. Mynders, for 
their forethought and your accommodation.

JACKSON STATE INSTITUTE. 
We closed the State Institute work last week as per schedule. 
The enrollment in the Primary Department was 131. In the 
Secondary Department it was 18, making a total enrolment of 
149. There were ten who made Primary certificates, and 33, 
. who, having complied with the regulations governing the same, 
were granted the renewal of their certificates. 
. There were none who made Roll of Honor certificates. Their 
failure, however, was due largely to the subjects of the Reading 
Cirele Course. None of them seemed to know of the require- 
ments until the institute opened. It would help wonderfully in 
this work if we could know early in the year where the imstitute 
is to be held and what new requirements are to be met. 
The teachers passed resolutions endorsing your administra- 
tion and the efforts you are putting forth on behaif of the boys 
and girls of the State. Wish you continued success in your work.

REPORTSZOF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
A County Superintendent has many things to worry him, . 
but if he is energetic, a good leadet, and can inspire teachers 
and schools to move upward, the pleasure he gets by watching 
them grow from year to year will fully compensate for all this. 
It is sometimes said by those who are not in a position to know, 
and who have never taken the pains to inform themselves, that 
our schools are no better than they were ten or twenty years 
ago. This is not true in any sense of the word when applied 
to Anderson County. I have been connected with the schools 
of this county for fifteen years and have studied the schools 
pretty carefully and noted their growth. Ten years ago there 
were some good teachers and there were some good schools. Now 
there are many good teachers and many good schools. Then 
there was no graded course of study; now every school in the 
county is graded and promotion is regulated by certificates. 
Then teachers met in institutes because it was required of them; 
now they meet because they enjoy it and are benefited. But I 
want this report to deal especially with the past two years’ work. 
Through the working of the county board system many im- 
provements have been made in the schools of this county.’ The 
board elected by the County Court in July, 1907, was a good 
board and did its work well. It increased the salaries of teachers 
and lengthened the term of schools. This was done with the 
same amount of money that was used the year before. Many 
unnecessary expenses were cut out, and the money thus saved 
was used to pay teachers. The average number of days taught 
“at each school was 135, and the average salary paid teachers 
was $39.62. The scholastic enumeration for the present year 
is 6,285. The number reported who can read and write is 4,573. 
To this add the probable number who were enrolled in the first 
grade (last year 1,809) and we see that all our boys and girls 
above the first grade can read and write. 
The Board of Education has just completed two of the best 
school houses ever built in the county. These are located at
-P-A-G-E-216
209 
Fairview in the first district and Wind Rock in the seventh dis- 
trict. The plans were taken from plans.furnished by the State 
. Superintendent. . They are modern and convenient and will be 
\ a monument to the board as long as they stand. Under the old. 
director system it would not have been possible to have built. 
these houses since it, cost more to put up a good house. 
In the August election three new members were elected on 
the board. These are of the best men in the county, and the 
schools are safe while in the hands of the present Board of Edu- 
cation. ‘Schools of the present year will run seven months. We 
have the largest attendance this year we have ever had, and the 
people feel that the schools are better this year than ever before. 
The Reading Circle Course has been a blessing to the schools. 
of Anderson County. Some teachers never read anything ex-. 
cept the textbooks they were required to teach. The Reading 
Circle requires all teachers to read, and they form the habit of 
reading good books. This is one of the best habits a teacher 
can have. It makes him broader and a better teacher. The , 
teachers of this county own a library of nearly 600 volumes of. 
the best literature published. I suppose the library is worth. 
at least $1,000. More books have'been read from the library in. 
the last six months than had been read in two years before. 
Teachers are learning the habit of reading. Juvenal libraries. 
have been placed in some of the rural schools. The reports the 
teachers make are gratifying and convinces that we need a se- 
lection of good books in every school, the reading to be done- 
under the direction of the teacher. 
The County High School, under the management of Prof.. 
R. H. Lankford, was a marked success. The attendance was: 
not as large as it would have been had the country schools closed. 
at Christmas as they usually do. The country schools closed in. 
March and this made it rather difficult to get teachers in school 
after their schools closed. The County High School is making: - 
good teachers for our district schools and we look to it to furnish. 
our future teachers. J. N. Crowper,

BEDFORD COUNTY. 
The public schools of Bedford County have made fair prog- 
ress the past two years. There has been some discord, incident 
to the change from directors to county board system of school 
management. No serious opposition has or will develop, and 
the recent school term now closed has been the best in ‘point of - 
attendance, advancement and genuine interest that this county 
has ever seen. The average salary of teachers will show a gain. 
The efliciency of instruétors has been very much strengthened, 
and the school business is now really a ‘business proposition. 
This county needs more money with which to meet the demand 
of the people for more efficient teachers, and a mild form of a 
compulsory school law to insure regular and uniform attendance. 
This county needs three measures: compulsory school law, uni- 
form State examination for teachers and more school money. 
W. M. Eewin, 
County Superintendent. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
While the schools of Benton County, compared with other 
counties in the State, are not up to the standard, still they have 
made satisfactory progress in the two years past.’ In that time 
we have built ten new school houses and consolidated several 
schools. _ 
There has been a greater interest awakened in both teachers 
and patrons, which resulted in better attendance than ever be- 
fore in the history of the county. Our County Court also caught 
the spirit after so long and increased our tax rate the necessary 
10 cents, which gives our schools the benefit of the Tollett fund. 
Teachers’ salaries have also been increased. 
Our needs are many. ‘We need more new houses. ‘Two-thirds 
of the houses have no desks, only benches. We hope next year, 
with our increased funds, to seat every house with patent desks. 
We also see the need of a compulsory school law, which is the 
only hope I see to reach a great number of our pupils. 
The Benton County Institute this year was a great success. 
The attendance was large and the interest good. Having no in- 
structor from the State the teachers had the work to do them- 
selves, which they did admirably. 
The county board system and its work for the past year was 
endorsed almost unanimously.

Our institute this year was regarded as the best ever held in 
the county. We did not do quite two weeks’ work owing to a 
little misunderstanding. Prof. W. B. Boyd’s work Was of the 
highest class and good and lasting results will come from his 
work. 
‘We are lacking a number of 4eachers, but I think we shall 
be able to get them. We had a rally day on the 10th of June 
in which a great number of the most prominent citizens of the 
town took part and much good was accomplished.

The Blount County Teachers’ Institute was held in Mary- 
ville College, June 15, to June 20, 1908. The morning periods 
-were taken up by discussions, and in the afternoons examina- 
tions were held. The educational interest of Blount County is 
improving. The teachers took great interest in institute work 
this year, and they are more professional in their work. There 
is indeed a great awakening in educational work in our part of 
the State, and we are looking for better things for the schools 
of our county.

County Superintendent. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
The progress most noticeable in this county in the past two 
years is in institute attendance, qualification of teachers, length 
of school term, purchase and use of libraries and 1 general school 
interest. 
The plan two years ago was to divide the county into four 
institute districts and have four institutes during the year, one 
in each district. There would be twelve to fifteen teachers in 
each district and about half of that number would not attend
-P-A-G-E-222
—208— 
even their respective institutes. By that method each teacher 
attended, besides the annual institute, but one institute during 
the year. Now, we have a summer institute continuing two 
weeks, and a monthly teachers’ meeting attended regularly by 
about forty-five teachers and a number of patrons who are in- 
terested in institute work. The patrons, too, are realizing the 
importance of teachers’ meetings. 
Our teachers have made great progress in qualifications by 
honest application to the subjects to be taught, to the Reading 
Circle courses and to the use of good library books. We have 
added twenty-one new school libraries within the past year, and 
by reading these library books the teachers have broadened their 
information wonderfully. Seven-eights of our teachers can now 
make a higher average on an examination 10 per cent harder 
than the examinations given two years ago. This indicates that ' 
the teachers are at least 15 per cent better qualified. 
The length of our school term has been extended one month. 
This extension came from both State-and county legislation and 
from the operation of the county board system. : 
A general school spirit is spreading over our county and the 
people are going to work in earnest. Teachers, pupils and 
patrons are agitating the school question. Nearly every com- 
munity has given from one to two entertainments this year for 
the benefit of libraries. One teacher raised enough funds in this 
way to buy twenty library books, a large bell and an organ. Two 
years ago no work of this kind was being done. 
The two greatest needs in our county are more funds and a 
compulsory school law. Though our funds have increased so 
that we are able to pay slightly better salaries and have longer 
terms of school, yet they are not sufficient to draw nor retain 
the best teachers. And besides having to give up our best teach- 
ers, we are not able to erect and equip as good school buildings 
as are necessary for the general welfare of public schools.’ 
According to the last census about 27 per cent of our scho- 
lastic population cannot read and write. And I believe that with 
the best teachers the highest salaries will command, and with 
the longest term of school desirable, we shall never be able to 
reduce the illiteracy of our county very much till we have a law 
compelling patrons to let their children take advantage of the
-P-A-G-E-223
—209— 
opportunities offered. And I herewith send up from Bradley 
County the ery, ‘‘Give us a compulsory school law.’’ 
As a result of the educational campaigns that have been 
waged so earnestly throughout East Tennessee the educational 
conditions of Bradley County are better than ever before. We 
have made improvements on many lines. The school term has ~ 
been lengthened 25 per cent; the average salary of the teachers 
has been raised 20 per cent, and the value of the school property 
has increased $9,000. There is a strong sentiment in favor of 
better school buildings and a better school spirit in general 
among the people. 
The city school of Cleveland and the rural schools held a 
joint session this year, which added much to the interest and 
success of the institute. 
We are pleased with our present school system, a county 
board of education. Its workings for the past year have given 
perfect satisfaction, and we hope the time is near at. hand when 
every boy and every girl of school age will be in attendance.

CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
The publie schools for the year 1906, in the county of Camp- 
bell, ran for a period of ninety days. The average price paid 
. the teachers in the county was $40.25, and in the city, $58.65. 
For the year 1907 the schools ran for a period of 110 days. The 
average salary of the teacher in the county was $44.80 and for 
the city $64. , 
The building and equipment of the property has been very 
rapid. During the year 1908 there has been spent: about $5,000
-P-A-G-E-225
—211— . 
for building. Four school buildings have been erected. The 
building at Newcomb cost $2,553. We'have spent approximately 
$2,000 for patent seats. We have about twenty-five schools sup- 
plied with patent seats, and of that number, ten have been sup- 
, Plied this year. 
The Cooperative Educational Association was organized last 
year and seven rallies were held in the different parts of the’ 
county. This year we created one in each of the five school dis- 
tricts, and about twenty meetings have been held in the county. 
These. meetings are well attended and have contributed much to 
the educational sentiment of the county. We secure the services 
of prominent educators to address the meetings. There has never 
been more interest in the educational progress of the county 
than now. 
The schools of the county are only partly graded at this time. 
A course of study was prepared and handed to all the teachers 
of the county, but many have been unable’ to thoroughly grade 
the schools of the county. 
Last year there were only fifteen who could pass the exami- 
nation for a Third Grade license, but a blank certificate was is- 
sued to enough to fill the schools of the county. Of the number 
who taught in the schools of this county last year sixty-five at- 
tended a good school after Christmas for a period ranging from 
three to five months. For this year I made the examination fully 
as hard and graded to the line and there were forty who made 
an average of 85 per cent. .

CANNON COUNTY. 
County Institute. 
All those who have kept in touch with the educational progress 
in this county for the past two years admit that remarkable 
strides have been made for better schools. At the beginning of 
our work about two years ago there were some fifteen little log 
huts in the county being used and called school houses, and in a 
majority of the places there was either no school yard at all or 
not enough to afford the children room for play. In many in- 
stances the houses were built on one side of the school grounds 
and too near the public road. The county needed about a thou- 
sand miles of blackboard and a carload of erasers. 
Up to the time of the present arrangements, in this county
-P-A-G-E-227
~-213— 
as in many others, ignorant, illiterate and immoral teachers were 
being permitted to enter the schools and try to teach the children. 
Schools had been run with less than a half-dozen pupils in daily 
attendance, and there were many weak schools that needed to be 
discontinued. 
When I took charge of the schools I came into office without 
having made a single promise or pledge save that I would do all 
in my power to remedy these unfortunate and dangerous evils. 
To say that we have succeeded is a conservative statement. We 
have built, or will have finished by spring, fifteen new up to date 
school houses, well furnished with light, seats and blackboards. 
All the little log houses have been torn down except one, and 
that one will have a new house in its stead at an early date. We 
have teachers who are morally and mentally qualified, and over 
the protest of influential people those who were not qualified: 
have been relieved from school work. 
Over forty of ovr young teachers went to school last year to 
better qualify themselves. The result of this and the other better 
conditions are already showing in the different schools. We have 
discontinued five of the weak schools permanently, and a few 
others temporarily. I find that the people do not kick long over: 
discontinuing a school when you explain to them why it was done. 
We have a five months’ school term this fall, which is the first 
time in the history of the county that the schools have run this. 
long. The attendance is better than ever before in the history 
of the county, and the teachers are attending the monthly meet- 
ings and showing that they are really interested in the work. 
The work to rid the school fund of indebtedness and pay cash: 
at the close of each month, which was begun under the school 
directors, has been carried to a successful finish by the County 
Board of Education. The operations of the law providing for a 
County Board instead of directors has proven to be a complete 
success. Three things have been accomplished. The schools. 
have been run longer; better salaries have been paid the teachers, 
and more required of them; more work in the way of improving 
school houses and grounds has been done during the past two 
years than had formerly been done in twenty years past, and the 
condition 9f the school fund is. better than ih the entire’ history 
of the county. We need a county high school. 
Our institute opened June 29 and continued one week. It.
-P-A-G-E-228
—214— 
was decidedly the best institute we have had in many years. 
People from different sections of the county attended this in- 
stitute more than have ever attended an institute at Woodbury. 
The institute deserves special mention because of the fact that 
all the teachers took a more active part than m they have formerly 
taken.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
We have increased the teachers’ salaries and lengthened the 
terms some, as will be shown by a comparison of my last with 
former reports. We have built fourteen new school houses and 
established five secondary schools. I have held more educational 
meetings in the county than any other Superintendent in the 
same length of time. I have not failed to attend a single meeting. 
One of our local editors told me that I had published more edu- 
cational notices in two years than had been published in his paper 
in any seven years prior to my administration. Our monthly 
meetings are being better attended, though they are not what 
they should be yet. We have purchased nearly $2,000 worth of 
school furniture within the past two years. 
Our greatest needs are: Professionally trained teachers, who 
are competent leaders in society ; a good county high school; more 
consolidated rural schools; more convenient school houses, and. 
more attractive grounds, and a compulsory attendance law. 
I am well ‘pleased with the results of our institute. Carroll 
County will furnish a number of teachers to the State institutes 
at Milan and Lexington. We have six teachers in the Summer 
School at Knoxville and three in Peabody College.

  CARTER COUNTY. 
A sentiment in favor of education is steadily growing in our 
county. The people are awakening slowly to the great need of 
@ more enlarged citizenship. The educational rallies now being 
carried on throughout the county are doing much good. The 
peoples’ eyes are being opened to some extent to the little stress 
that is placed on the most important and vital things of indi- 
vidual and national life. Our schools cannot nearly approach 
the standard that should be until there is a law to compel par- 
ents to give their children educational advantage. 
Salaries and efficient teachers are increasing, not fast, but 
some each year. We need more money, better school houses and 
more efficient teachers. . 
The teachers manifested great interest in the work this year 
and say that it was one of the best institutes in the history of 
the county. I believe the teachers of Carter County are becom- 
ing more interested from year to year in their work. I feel sure 
that they have returned to their work with renewed energy and 
determination to make this one of the, best school years in the 
county. The people in general are taking more interest in the 
school work.

CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
There has been some definite improvement in our conditions 
in the last two years. In some instances schools have been con- 
solidated and a few have been discontinued. Salaries of teachers 
have been raised, but not materially. We have established a 
number of secondary schools in the county with two teachers. 
Our County Court in July, 1906, established a County High 
School and the same was located at Ashland City, the county 
seat, and has been in operation there since in a handsome con- 
erete building given to the county by the citizens of the county 
by way of private subscriptions. The only thing that seems to 
be a menace to. the future prosperity and.advancement of our 
educational interests is the lack of funds necessary to a proper 
operation of our school system as we now have it organized. 
With our County High School as a head, and the proper number 
of secondary schools established, and a primary school within 
the easy reach of every child in the county, we think our system 
is well organized and will meet the demands for. public instruc- 
tion if the necessary means to operate it properly is supplied.

County Superintendent. 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
It is a pleasure to speak of our improvement in public school 
matters within the last two years. We have torn away ten of 
our old buildings, some of which were log structures, and have 
erected eight beautiful houses in their stead. Besides, three 
schools have been consolidated and thus a finer interest created. 
Improvement has also been made on almost every house in our 
county, and two hundred and twenty-five of Andrews’ ‘‘no 
raise’’ double desks have been added, thus placing our county 
far above any former condition. 
In addition to the above we have had more school days than 
heretofore, and have raised our teachers’ salaries each year. 
All this has been done on a 10-cent tax from the county, and so 
far we have paid all accounts. Our April term of court gave
-P-A-G-E-237
ca 
—221— 
us an additional tax of 15 cents, and with this and other reve- 
nues following, the financial outlook is nearing what we could 
reasonably expect for a while. Our County Board and the en- 
tire people are more awake to the situation than usual. Our 
greatest need at present is a more efficient corps of teachers, 
whose life work is to instruct the pupils of the land. I regret 
to say that we have had to employ some teachers who fell far 
below the requirements of our law. Chester County wants a 
uniform examination for all of her teachers, and those of the 
State, and a compulsory school law for those indisposed, and we 
believe our people will appreciate the school tax paid more than 
ever before. N. B. HarpemMan, 
County Superintendent. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my second annual report of the public 
schools of Claiborne County. The institute this year was the 
best and the most largely attended of any ever held in Claiborne 
County. We have made some good improvements along im- 
portant lines and believe that others will soon be made. 
The County Board of Education movement has helped our 
schools a great deal. Our standard of qualification of teachers 
is being gradually raised, and already good results have fol- 
lowed. We are striving hard to raise the standard of qualifica- 
tion of our teachers a little higher each year. We pay fair sal- 
aries and are able to hold most of our best teachers with us. , 
We had with us Dr. Stooksbury, of the Lincoln Memorial 
University, Cumberland Gap, Tenn.; Prof. W. L. Gentry, Car- 
son and Newman College, and Miss Dyer of Knoxville. I believe 
I see not far distant a strong spirit for better schools, and we 
are doing all we can to hasten the coming of a better and brighter 
day for the public schools of our county.

CLAY COUNTY. 
Within the last two years there has been an obvious awaken- 
ing in public education in Clay County. The Board of Eduea- 
tion and general public are to be congratulated upon the ener- 
getic and vitalizing work accomplished. With the most excellent 
aid and attention given us on the part of the State, together 
with local reforms, Clay County has perhaps enjoyed the most 
thoroughly prosperous and promising period of her history. On 
the part of the people there is now an interest and an enthu- 
siasm heretofore unknown. For the past two years there has 
been held-in each district in the county a general mass meeting | 
for teachers, patrons and pupils. The nature of the exercises 
has developed patriotism on the part of the children and interest 
among the patrons. Until last year no real effort had been made 
to, grade the schools of the county. Last year and this one wit- 
nessed a vigorous effort on the part of Superintendent and 
teachers to establish a uniform grade system. We find that the 
system saves so much time and energy and removes a certain 
vagueness and indefiniteness, giving system and order to both 
teacher and student. This, together with regular examinations 
required to be held, and promotions given, has brought about a 
little revolution in the real school work. 
The county has four new buildings erected within this pe- — 
riod. The County Board required the communities to be the 
immediate beneficiaries of the new houses to furnish at least 
one half of the expense. So far this has been more than con- 
formed to. Hence at an expenditure of some $1,200 the county 
has obtained property approximately valued at $3,000. 
Favorable signs appear in the facts that enrollment and daily 
attendance has materially increased. Also the percentage of 
illiteracy has decreased, especially in the last year. The salaries 
for teachers have been raised a few dollars each year, and with 
this raise in salary has been maintained a corresponding raise 
in standard of qualification. Two especial points have been kept 
prominent in the fixing of salary, namely, scholarship and suc- 
cessful experience. 
. For the especial benefit of the teachers we conducted a nor- 
mal of six weeks, in which was taught the books of the ‘‘Reading. 
Cirele’’ and other professional works, together with regular class
-P-A-G-E-240
—224— os 
work in the text. Practically all the teachers of the county were 
in attendance and a great deal of good was accomplished. 
The county institute was characterized with unusual zeal and 
enthusiasm, being attended by a great many citizens. We sought 
this year to develop somewhat the culture side of the teacher’s 
life by exercises in music, expression and regular lectures in 
English literature. 
School consolidation has been ardently agitated. Owing to 
our rivers, creeks and high bluffs the board has been a bit con- 
servative, but a few needful abandonments have been made and 
others are planned. We have no little difficulty in getting the 
people to understand the object and cooperate in this move. 
The condition of the county, in every particular, looks toward. 
the better, and one of the most vital needs is a vigorous con- 
tinuation of the principles and policies already begun, till they 
are perfected, together with others which conditions may suggest. 
‘We need’ more funds: First, to train the teachers; second, to 
improve our poor condition in the way of seating, essential ap- 
paratus, ete.; third, to lengthen our school terms and improve 
teachers’ salaries. We hope the immediate future holds for the 
children startling advantages and opportunities in the line of 
publie education. 
County InsriTuTE. 
The institute was the most successful of our history. You 
will notice the roll of atendance shows the presence of a great 
many who were not teachers. The plan of institute work was a 
departure from the ordinary county institute, and proved to be 
not only interesting, but profitable to the teachers. The whole 
teacher-body manifested more than ordinary enthusiasm for the 
school work of this year. ; 
The institute endorsed the principle of Dr. Claxton’s ‘‘Om- 
nibus Bill’’ in the main. We are very anxious for some favor- 
able legislation. We favor State certification, compulsory school 
-attendance, abandonment of secondary schools, county high 
schools, a part of Claxton’s bill. We can’t do much in our small. 
mountainous counties until we get more funds. We have the 
schools of our county graded, but we can’t finish the grades in 
our short terms. We sincerely hope the educators of the State 
may confer and agree upon educational measures. We need 
results.

COCKE COUNTY. 
The Cocke County Teachers’ Institute was a‘ success. Mr. 
Sam E. Hill, as Conductor, did excellent work, and his efforts 
were satisfactory to all. Prof. Mathews, of Maryville, visited 
our institute and said many stimulating and interesting things 
to our teachers. 
Our schools are doing better work than ever before, and it is 
the opinion of many thinking patrons that our schools are 20 
per cent better than they were two years ago, and I attribute 
the betterment mostly to the wise and efficient management of 
the County Board. 
We have one good County High School at Newport and it is 
doing good work, but have not been able to get our County Court 
sutficiently interested as to levy a high school tax adequate to 
the demands. 
We need, especially, four things: More money, more good 
houses, better qualified teachers and a compulsory school. law. 
I believe a majority of the people are in favor of a compulsory 
law and we hope to have it by next year.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
I herewith submit a short report of my work for the past two 
years. During that time we have built eight new school houses 
in Coffee County at an average cost of $600 each. All of said 
houses are neat frame buildings, seated with patent seats and 
insured. We have repaired and built additions to several other 
houses. We have spént about $2,000 for school furniture. The 
average length of term for the past two years has been seven 
months per year. The salaries of teachers have increased 20° 
per cent during the two years. The terms have been equalized. 
We have $4 per capita-this year. Our County Reading Circle 
has not missed a meeting for two years. : 
County Institute. 
_ A large majority of the teachers were not examined at the 
close of the institute for the reason they have taught in Coffee 
County for several years. We had the largest enrollment and 
more interest taken in the work of any institute ever held in 
Coffee County. 
Supt. W. H. Knox, of Wilson County, was sent by Supt. R. 
L. Jones. to assist us in the institute. Supt. Knox was a very 
efficient helper.

I feel satisfied that more real benefit was derived from this 
institute than from any previous meeting ever held in our county. 
I wish to thank you for sending us Prof. Malone. He proved 
to be a fine worker and became a general favorite among our 
teachers. Our home teachers, Messrs. Lowry, Grills, Bodkin and 
Jones, did nobly. -I assure you it was a great pleasure to con- 
duct such an exercise as we had every day for ten days. Our 
teachers were as regular in attendance and earnest in the work 
as if they had been pupils in school. We are all pleased with 
what was done at our institute in June, 1908. :

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
During the years 1907 and 1908 school conditions in David- 
son County have shown marked improvement. The operation 
of the Board of Education law made possible a uniform course 
of study. All schools have the same length of term, eight months. 
We have semiannual examinations, the questions being sent 
from the Superintendent’s office. Promotions of pupils to higher 
grades is made at the close of the term. . 
At the April term, 1908, our County Court made a special 
appropriation of over $30,000 from the general fund for repairs 
and erection of new school houses. During the summer we have 
completed eight new buildings: three brick, costing about $4,500 
eaeh; five frame, costing about $2,500 each, and three additions 
costing about $500 each. By consolidation, we have abolished 
eight schools, and the coming year will bring further progress 
along this line. 
- Our teachers. are taking an active interest in institute work 
and are beginning to realize the mental and spiritual uplift that 
comes from. attractive: school environment. 
We need a nine months term and higher salaries, and hope
-P-A-G-E-249
—233— 
to accomplish this through an increase of at least 10 cents on . 
the school tax rate during 1909. We need also a more definite 
and uniform law for taking the city and county scholastic census. 
In brief, our educational pathway is not altogether ‘‘strewn 
with rose leaves and bordered with flowers,’’ but the advance 
has been definite and the outlook is encouraging. 
County Instrrurs. 
The instructors in this institute were selected from our local 
teachers, and the results were more satisfactory, perhaps, than 
when we employed outside talent. Both the lecture and class 
room methods were used. Instead of a general study of the en- 
tire course we made a special feature of selected studies. I have 
noted with pleasure good results of the work in many schools T 
have visited this fall.

DECATUR COUNTY. 
The educational progress of Decatur County has been greater 
during the past two years than that of the ten previous years. 
This progress has been due mostly to the operation’ of the county 
board system, notwithstanding the united efforts of the State 
and County Superintendents and teachers have contributed very 
largely to this progress,
-P-A-G-E-251
—235— 
Our teachers are now paid in proportion to their-attainments 
and ability to do well their work. Under the old law all appli- 
eants for schools were considered equally meritorious. But such 
is not the case under the new law. The County Board divided 
the rural teachers into four grades and pay them according to 
grade. In determining a teacher’s grade, his influence in the 
community, or his ability to increase and hold attendance, and 
his scholarship, are given the most weight. The fact that all 
rural schools run as nearly as practicable the same length of 
time, regardless of the grade of teacher, causes our teachers to 
better prepare themselves. The weaker teachers know that the 
people will always ask for good teachers, since all schools run 
the same length of time. These two movements on the part of 
the board—the dividing of our teachers into grades and paying 
them according to grade, and running all schools the same length 
of time—have done a great deal towards stimulating our teachers 
to greater efforts. 
The attendance at our teachers’ meetings has more than’ 
doubled during the past two years. This was caused by the 
County Board, at my request, requiring the teachers to attend 
the teachers’ meetings. 
Our schools under the new law are better organized than they 
ever were. Under the old law the schodls did not begin on the 
same day, neither did they run the same length of time. Under 
the uew law all schools run as nearly as practicable the same 
length of time. The teachers, on Saturdays after their month’s 
close, receive pay for teaching. This greatly aids in systematiz: 
ing our work. 
We have made six consolidations this year and intend to make 
more next year. In making the six consolidations we discon- 
tinued seven schools. These consolidations alone will save our 
county each year in teachers’ expenses $1,500. When we make 
all the consolidations that are necessary to be made the savings 
in teachers’ expenses will be $2,200 a year. 
‘We now have in course of erection and under contract to be © 
built eight new school buildings, six for the consolidated schools 
and two to take the places of dilapidated buildings that are not 
fit for school purposes. '

This year has witnessed the establishment and equipment of 
an office for the County Superintendent. Heretofore the County 
Superintendent has kept his office in one of the county official’s 
oftice, but now, for the first time in the history of our county, 
we can boast of a first class up to date office. 
Our Present Epucationau NEEDS. 
Our greatest educational needs are as follows: 
1. Better trained teachers. 
2. Better school buildings and grounds. 
3. More money to make our terms of school longer. 
4. County Superintendent’s salary raised in order that he 
may give the office work his entire time. 
5. A compulsory school law. 
County InstiIruTs. 
The annual institute has caused an increased interest in be 
half of our publie school system and has greatly stimulated and 
developed an increased interest among our teachers. I am glad 
to say that as far as zeal and earnestness go the majority of the 
teachers of Decatur County are unsurpassed, though there is. 
much room for improvement in qualification on the part of many. 
I have the honor of giving the first examination on mental: 
arithmetic to the teachers of Decatur County. At the annual 
institute last year I announced that this year they would be 
examined on that subject. 
There were fifteen applicants who failed to make the required 
average, but most of those who failed will be used, as we are 
short of teachers. After doing this we still haven’t enough 
teachers for all the schools of Decatur County.

DEKALB COUNTY. 
Asa report from DeKalb County I can say we had more 
money on hand at the beginning of the year than ever before. 
We can lave a five months’ school and a good reserve. Several 
buildings have been erected and others planned. 
The Reading Circle is enjoyed by the teachers. They are 
proud of it. : 
_ I am sorry to say the County Board law is not as popular 
‘here as I wish it to be. I think if the people would only be pa- 
tient it would soon prove to them its many advantages. 
Dr. Claxton’s rally was the greatest educational meeting ever 
held in DeKalb County. 
One of our greatest needs is a compulsory school law. An- 
other great need is a county high school, and of course we need 
more funds for longer terms and better equipments. 
County INstITUTE. 
The institute was full of interest. The largest enrollment 
and attendance ever in DeKalb County. 
Conpuctor’s Report. 
I beg leave to submit the following report of my work at 
Smithville: 
The institute met Monday, July 6, and continued in session 
five days. The enrollment was 114. My subjects were arith- 
metic, literature, grammar and physiology. Prof. Boucher, of 
Dyer, Tenn., did work in pedagogy, agriculture and rhetoric. 
Prof. Clark, of Dibrell, was present and gdve an instructive 
lecture on geography, besides aiding materially in the discus- 
sions. The noticeable facts connected with the meetings were 
as follows: _ 
The excess of the number of male teachers over the female; 
the earnestness with which a large number of teachers entered 
into the discussions; fhe enthusiasm and good fellowship that 
prevailed, and the many evidences of effective organization due 
to the good work of the County Superintendent, Miss Robinson. 
Respectfully submitted,

DICKSON COUNTY. 
I am very mtich pleased to report to you that the schools of 
Dickson County are steadily improving. With a few exceptions 
our schools were very satisfactorily taught last year. The at- 
tendancé was reasonably good, yet we have a great deal to do. 
We are using every effort to build up the work. 
We'have built a few new houses and made some consolida- 
tions since the County Board law went into effect. We hope to 
place model buildings in every district and equip same. 
We took up the Reading Circle work promptly last year and 
our teachers found. the work both interesting and helpful. We 
have also. entered into the work for the current year. We meet 
bimonthly and hope to accomplish much by next annual exami- 
nation. 
-We-had a good county institute both last year and this year. 
Many teachers expressed themselves as being greatly helped by 
attending same. I was very ably assisted in the work by local 
talent, who are experienced teachers. 
I feel that your visits to our county last year, and also Dr. 
Claxton’s and Prof. Lyon’s this year, were helpful to the school 
interest of the whole county. — R. E. Cortew.

The Dyer County Institute opened Monday morning, June 
8, with a large attendance. The two weeks’ session was very 
pleasant and interesting. Dr. Kinsland, besides his assigned 
work, gave some very helpful talks on school government. As 
there were only five teachers in the secondary work only the 
primary course was taught, the Superintendent giving special 
instruction to the five secondary teachers. Several teachers having 
State certificates, and others desiring examinations later, did not 
take the regular examinations. After one of the most successful 
sessions ever held in Dyer County, the institute closed June 19,

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
The schools of Fayette County have made good substantial 
progress during the past two years. By paying better salaries — 
‘—in many places the public fund being supplemented by pri- 
vate subseription-we have now put the secondary schools on a 
good basis, and they are now doing good work with gratifying 
results. 
The primary schools, too, have been much improved, but 
much remains to be done. Five of our most crying needs just 
now, it seems, are: 
1. More funds from which to pay such salaries as will hold 
in the rural schools such teachers as will render them more effi- 
cient. . 
2. Some more adequate opportunities for our young, bright 
and ambitious teachers to.equip themselves more thoroughly for 
work in the rural schools.
-P-A-G-E-261
(243 — 
3. An improvement in the condition of the public roads of 
the rural communities. 
4. A uniform examination of teachers. 
5. Some way of awaking general interest enough to induce 
our people to send to school so that the school, term be uninter- 
rupted. 
County Instiruts. 
The institute for Fayette County for the summer of 1908 
was, I think, the most successful that has been held in our county 
for many years. The teachers who were not in State institutes 
at the time were, almost all, enrolled and attended fairly well, 
the great majority being present each day. Great interest was 
manifested and much benefit realized. 
While we regret very much that our ‘State: Superintendent 
could not, visit our institute we would express highest appre- 
ciation for the able address delivered by Prof. Brister, whom he 
sent to us, and also for the very earnest and effective work of 
Mrs. Mitchell. I wish also to express the highest appreciation 
for the very efficient work done by our own county teachers. ~

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
The progress along educational lines has been very satisfac- 
tory during the last two years. The school term has been longer, 
and the interest taken by teachers, patrons and pupils is to be 
commended. 
The teaching force is better now than ever before. The time 
has been when 50 per cent of those who taught here came from 
other counties, but now the entire foree may be had within the 
limits of the county. 
Within the last two years there has been a high school estab- 
lished, the benefit of which is now beginning to be felt by some 
who are teaching and others who are preparing to teach. A good 
building, one which is a credit to the county, has been provided 
for this school within the last year, and every effort is being put
-P-A-G-E-263
—245— 
forth to make this one of the best institutions of learning in this 
- part of the State. 
In the last year there have been seven. school houses erected, 
most of which are much better than those built before this time. 
If this work is continued for a year or two longer there will be 
a comfortable school house in reach of every child of school age. 
This progress has been brought about by the establishment 
of the County Board, the increased appropriations by the State, 
as well as the increased assessment by the county. 
Some act to compel people to send to school is needed more 
than anything else, and it is hoped that this will be done at the 
next meeting of the Legislature. 
County Institute. 
The annual institute for Fentress County was one of the most 
interesting institutes ever held in the county. <A general review 
of the subjects to be taught was taken, and instruction was given 
in the State Reading Circle Course. The teachers will without 
doubt go better prepared and with a greater determination to 
promote the interests of the schools than ever before.

FRANKUIN COUNTY. 
The school interest in this county seems to be much better 
than ever before. We have more pupils in school, a better grade 
of teachers and a marked improvement in our buildings and 
grounds. We have built a new brick building at a cost of $4,000 
to $5,000; a frame at a cost of $1,000; repaired others, and are 
im better condition for the winter than we were last year. Our 
people seem to be waking up and are wanting a compulsory 
school law. I give below comparative statement: 
‘I have figured seven months school in 1908, while we think 
we will be able to give eight months. We think we have done 
“well, but hope to do more and better the coming year.

J. W. TEMPLETON, 
County Superintendent. 
  GIBSON COUNTY. 
In compliance with your earnest request of November 20 I. 
submit herewith a brief report of the public schools of Gibson 
County for the past two years, and enclose you a photograph of 
one of the new school buildings erected within the last two years. 
We have: erected some other good buildings, but thus far I have 
been unable to secure pictures thereof. I have the promise of 
one, which grew out of the consolidation of three small country 
schools into one good central school. We have in prospect the 
consolidation of other schools, the County Board having ordered 
the consolidation of three small country schools into one good 
strong school. We have many small schools that ought to be 
combined into one, but still in many sections the desire for a 
school at every man’s door is so strong that it will require time 
and teaching to reach the happy results of consolidation. 
We are happy to say that in many parts of the county the 
people are beginning to see that through consolidation they could 
secure better schools, better teachers and richer rewards for their 
children, and with less money, than they are now reaping with 
their many weak, short-termed schools. . 
We have an excellent County Board of Education, and they 
are doing all they can possibly do to give the new County Board 
law a fair test, but owing to the bitter opposition to the law’on 
the part of the masses, and their feeling that it is an outrage 
and unwarranted and unprecedented attack on the principles of 
local self government, their task is an arduous one. I feel 
satisfied that if our people would give the new law a fair and 
unprejudicial test they would soon see many good redeeming

features in it, which would greatly increase the efficiency of our 
school system. Our County Board went into office on the first of 
July handitapped as to funds, many of the directors having 
spent all the money due their districts for houses, lots, desks, 
wells, fences, etc., in order that these funds might not go into 
the county ‘treasury. The balance received from the districts 
was only $9,050.65, when it should have been about $20,000. 
In January, 1907, the County Court unwittingly cut our 
county school tax from 30 cents to 20 cents on the $100, which 
reduced our school fund about $8,000. From the leakages in 
the school fund our County Board was forced to cut our schools 
to 5 mont&as, while before they had run on an average a little 
over 6 months. Ancther reason for a shorter term was because 
the directors had contracted with teachers before the County. 
Board came in at higher salaries than had been paid before, 
average salary being that year $40.53 per month, whereas. this 
year it will be only $36.02, The board this year has been forced 
to reduce salaries and other expenses on account of meagerness 
of funds. On account of meager salaries many of our leading 
teachers are seeking other more remunerative. fields.

age attendance 2,100. Rate of school tax levied by county on 
property, 1907, 20 cents; rate of school tax levied by county on 
’ property, 1908, 35 cents. With this increase we hope to get out 
of debt and be able to run longer terms and pay better salaries. 
Our monthly pay roll, 1907, was about $8,500; 1908, $6,267.60. 
In 1907, just before the new law went into effect, two towns, 
Trenton, with a school population of 719, and Medina, with 116, 
became city schools. In 1908 two other towns, Dyer and Ruth-
-P-A-G-E-270
—250— 
ertord, declared themselves city schools. The trouble with these 
towns is that they incorporated in order to get from under su- 
pervision, and also to have their teachers exempt from county 
examinations; and that they wanted the County Board to 
transfer all the funds of county pupils within 2 or 244 miles of 
their corporate limits to the city schools regardless of whether 
they attend their schools or not. With this transfer of funds in 
view many other little towns expect to become city schools next 
year. If this thing is permitted to go on it will destroy the 
country schools and practically annul the new law. With the 
cooperation of the people our schools would prosper and improve. 
County InstiTuTe. . 
Enclosed I am sending the report for my county institute for 
* eolored teachers of Gibson County. The institute was under the 
general supervision of the County Superintendent, and under 
the special direction of Prof. T. M. Stigall, principal of the 
Humboldt city eolored school, aided by Profs. J. F. Booker and 
A. J. Collins, principals of the Trenton and Milan city colored 
schools, respectively. 
It was our purpose in this institute to review the work to be 
done by the teacher in his school; to deepen and broaden the 
conception of school work; to improve the methods of teaching, 
and to raise the standard of teaching in our colored schools. The 
work done in the institute this year was eminently practical and 
helpful to our teachers. The institute was recognized as a busi- 
ness institution for the training of teachers, and conducted on 
business principles, each member of the institute being furnished 
something practicable and profitable to do daily. I regard this the 
best colored institute we have ever held in the county. I think 
our colored teachers will be better equipped for their work this 
year than ever before.

GILES COUNTY. 
Certainly the educational conditions in Giles County are not 
ideal. There are many things to deplore and many things to be 
grateful for. Just.as we were about ready to increase our levy 
for school purposes the courthouse burned, and we now have a 
bonded indebtedness hanging over us, and the children will have 
to wait for an education. But we have used well the means at 
hand. With a State and county levy of 25 cents our school term 
‘last year was, uniformly, six months; this, too, with increased 
. salaries to teachers and numerous expenditures for repairs, new 
buildings, and discharging much indebtedness contracted un- 
wisely by. the old district boards. 
Under the new law we elected last year a board of five, four 
of whom entered upon their duties prejudiced against the law, 
and opposed to increased taxes for school purposes. Within two 
months the wisdom -of the law was recognized by every member, 
and in April of this year the entire membership signed an earnest 
appeal to the County Court asking for an additional levy. Some 
of the largest taxpayers of the county are members of the County 
Board. 
We have just recently erected two new school buildings that 
would do credit to any county in the State. Neither of them is 
located in Mud Buttom or on Goat Hill. One of them is a con- 
solidated school. In another instance we have made one sehool 
out of three. In a large number of cases we have consolidated 
two into one. 
Year before last'two districts had only 60 days each of school; 
two districts adjoining these had 130 and 140 respectively. We 
are trying hard to give every child an equal chance. 
In some sections, notably those in which there was little school 
interest and a consequent hoarding of money from year to year, 
there is strong opposition to the new law; but I am safe in say- 
‘ing that those who have studied. educational conditions most 
closely would regret to see any backward step taken. The people 
of the county are fast becoming enlightened on the merits of the 
new law, and many who opposed it at first are its most ardent 
supporters now. 
We are planning many things for next year and confidently 
expect to be able to make a glowing report of achievements al- 
ready won in our next communication.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The annual institute for Grainger County met at the court- 
house in Rutledge, Tenn., June 22, 1908, and continued two 
weeks. The attendance was good, and the interest manifested 
was the best I have ever seen among any body of teachers. The 
citizens are interested more in our public schools than ever be- 
fore. Our County Court gives more thought and attention to 
the public school funds, and we now have a better tax levy than 
heretofore. The county board system is an improvement in many 
respects, and the school interest in general is far better than 
ever before. The educational rallies are doing much good for 
our public schools.

GREENE COUNTY. 
Greene County is in the procession. The friends of educa- 
tion are awake to the needs of better school facilities, and there 
is every indication of the dawn of a brighter day for the eleven 
thousand school children in this good county.. 
We were given a State Teachers’ Institute by Hon. R. L. 
Jones. The faculty, Capt. C. S. Douglass, Conductor; Prof. W. 
E. Miller, Prof. OC. P. Jester and Prof. J. C. Foshee, his assist- 
ants, came and spent four weeks with us, during which time 
there was much good accomplished. True, many who took this 
examination failed, but all who failed deserved to fail, and I 
feel that the State Institute was a means of showing many of 
those who aspired to teach that they were not qualified for the 
work, 
‘We have a live, wideawake Teachers’ Association, which holds 
its meetings regularly. The association devotes a portion of the 
time at each meeting to a study of Reading Circle texts. This 
adds interest to the meetings and is helpful to all our teachers. 
The County Board is pushing as rapidly as possible the work 
of consolidating schools. We have built four new school build- 
ings during the year, and there are at least five other communi-
-P-A-G-E-276
—256— 
ties arranging to cooperate with the board in their efforts to 
combine two. or more weak schools and make one good school in 
which there can .be placed two teachers, and in which all the 
grades of the primary and secondary courses may be taught, if 
necessary. . 
In one community there were three school houses, each of 
which was in a bad state of repair. In these three buildings the 
combined daily attendance for the term last year was.73 pupils. 
"The School Board abolished these three schools and built a hand- 
some two-room building, with a seating capacity sufficient to ac- 
commodate 130 pupils. In the new building we have only two 
teachers, yet the average daily attendance is 106 pupils. We 
are running this school at a cost of $20 per month less than the 
three schools cost us, yet the attendance has increased 45 per 
cent. In addition to this inerease in attendance, there is an edu- 
cational awakening in this community such as it has never ex- 
perienced before. 
By consolidating some of our schools we have been enabled 
to increase the length of our term in the consolidated schools 
30 days, and in all the other schools 10 days. 
We are conducting an educational campaign in the county. 
In this work we are using local material, but the campaign is 
bearing fruit already. I hope that the Superintendent will be 
able to report a system of high schools for Greene County next 
year. . . , 
In conclusion, I wish to say that, while there is room for im- 
provement all along the line in Greene County, we are making 
progress and doing our best to improve the advantages that have 
been given us by reason of the beneficent laws that have already 
been enacted, and I might add that we are anticipating even 
greater things for our schools next year, because we believe that 
the educational campaign in Tennessee this year will result in the 
» enacting of a law that will provide ways and means by which 
reforms that are so much needed in every county may be brought 
about. 
County INSTITUTE. 
In the foregoing reference is made only to the State Institute. 
Following this institute I found it necessary to have another ex- 
amination for the purpose of securing teachers qualified to take 
_ charge of our schools. In the second examination the record was

no better than that made in the State Institute. I am convinced 
that the teachers who are trying to do the work in Greene County 
are lacking in scholarship. There are at least 50 per cent of 
them who could not get a third grade certificate in any reason- 
able test. I iicensed these teachers again because they have been 
licensed in the past and because 1 had no other means of securing 
teachers for'my schools. I hope to see an improvement in this 
phase of the work next year.

County Superintendent. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
I was inducted into the office of County Superintendent of 
Grundy County in January, 1900, and at that time there was 
not a record of any kind in said office. Record books have been 
kept for the last eight years, so that now there is in this office 
a complete record of the schools for the past eight years. 
On July 1, 1900, the Trustee’s books showed a balance on 
hand in the school fund: of $5,797.03. On July 1, 1908, there 
was $9,246.48 in the Trustee’s office to the credit of the school 
fund. 
In 1900 there were thirty-three school districts in the county, 
and each district had a school house or a house used at times for 
school purposes. Now there are only four school districts and 
thirty schools, and the county owns all the houses used for school 
purposes, except one. | 
In the past eight years ten school houses have been erected 
in this county at a cost of about $8,000, and equipped with 
modern desks, blackboards, ete. at an additional expense of 
about $2,000.

In 1900 the total valuation of all school property was about 
$50,000. In 1908 the school property of the county was valued 
at $62,970. 
In 1900 the total population of children in the county of 
school age was 2,946. In 1908 it is 3,246. 
The colored population in 1900 was 88. In 1908 it is 42. 
The average daily attendance for the year 1900-1901 was 
1,303. For the year ending June 30, 1908, it was 1,420. 
In 1900 the school terms ranged from three to five months in 
the various districts, according to population. In 1908 all schools 
will be run five months. 
The average salary paid teachers for the year ending June 
30, 1900, was $31.60. For the year ending June 30, 1908, the 
average salary paid teachers was $40.14. 
The progress of our schools has been slow, but sure, and 
public sentiment is growing in favor of more money for school 
purposes, and hence better equipped schools and longer terms. 
County Institut. 
The institute for Marion and Grundy Counties was held at 
Monteagle again this year, 103. teachers from both counties being 
enrolled. The instructors, J. A. Settliff and J. W. Williams, did 
’ excellent work from the very beginning, and the institute was 
a success in every way. . 
The teachers voted unanimously to meet at Monteagle next 
year, the intention being to induce other counties to join us and 
have a great summer school at this historic summer resort. The 
course of study will be prepared and given to the teachers in 
the near future and the best institute in the history of the two 
counties is confidently expected next year.

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
I am glad to report that our school term is gradually length- 
ening and that the pay of County Superintendent and teachers - 
ig increasing. While the grade of instruction is not all it should 
be, yet we feel that there is an improvement from year to year. 
Most of the teachers have shown an interest in all of the teachers’ 
meetings. Our Reading Circle meets monthly and usually all 
the teachers are present and take a great interest in the work. 
Our county institute was held at the Morristown High School 
building June 22 to June 27, 1908. Prof..E. H. Moore was 
chairman, with Prof. J. W. Trotter, of Knoxville, to assist. 
We feel that our teachers were greatly benefited by having 
Prof. Trotter with us, as he is a very practical man in the in- 
stitute work. 
Much interest is being taken in the cause of education, a 
great deal of which is due to the campaign made in the interest 
of education by our State Superintendent. 
Our greatest need is an interest among the people in the 
eause of education. On account of lack of interest our schools 
have not the attendance that they should have. We need in our 
county a compulsory school law to protect our children in their 
rights. 
The Board of Education is doing more for the cause of ed- 
ucation than has been done in our county in twice the same 
length of time. The old-time houses are a thing of the past in 
Hamblen County and we are building new ones.

HAMILTON COUNTY. 
I beg to submit the following report of the public schools of 
Hamilton County for the past two years, the first three months 
of which you were County Superintendent. Through your in- 
genuity, perseverance and tact the Honorable County Court of 
Hamilton County was made to see the weakness of the old secon-» 
dary school and was induced to provide for the establishment of 
one or more high schools. A tax of 5 cents on $100 was levied for 
the maintenance of a Board of Education composed of. the fol- 
lowing honorable gentlemen: W. B. Garvin, J. H. Hogan, W. 8. 
Beck, C. E. Engers, E. F. Hixson, William Griffith, R. L. Jones, 
ex officio. The board was organized by electing W. B. Garvin 
Chairman. . 
After due deliberation the board agreed on the establishment 
of four high schools; one central, to be located in one of the 
suburbs of the city; three to be located in the rural sections of 
the county. Finding itself without funds with which to pur- 
chase sites, erect and equip suitable buildings, the board decided 
to ask the County Court for a bond issue of $75,000 with which 
to begin its work. A committee from the board went before the 
County Court at its January session and made known the plans 
of the board. The court agreed to grant its request, and accord- 
ingly asked the General Assembly, then in session at the capital, 
Nashville, to grant it the authority to issue said bonds. The au- 
thority was granted, the bonds were issued and sold, and the 
funds put at the disposal of the board. The work of selecting 
sites was begun. 
Every leading community in the county was bidding for the 
location of a school, the rural communities offering sites of eight 
and ten acres each free to the board, and the suburban commun- 
ities a substantial cash contribution. After a careful study of 
the sites proposed the following choices were made: 
Central—Ridgedale. 
Rural—Hixson, Soddy: and Tyner. 
Plans and specifications were accepted and contracts for the 
erection of buildings at Ridgedale, Soddy and Tyner were en- 
tered into. 
Central High School was completed and equipped at a total 
cost of about $75,000, Soddy and Tyner at about $11,000 and
-P-A-G-E-286
—264— 
$10,000 respectively. These buildings were all completed and 
in use during the greater part of the 1907-8 school term. For 
lack of funds the erection of the Hixson school was deferred 
for one year. 
It is the purpose of the Board of Education that these build- 
ings shall be equipped with all modern appliances, and shall be 
in all respects worthy models. Each school is equipped with 
chemical and physical laboratory appliances sufficient to pro- 
vide for full laboratory instruction in all branches. In addition 
to this equipment the central school has a well equipped Manual 
Training and Commercial Department, which provide excellent 
opportunities for the training of the boys and girls in industrial 
branches, and for the benefit of students who contemplate fol- 
lowing the teaching profession a teachers’ training course has 
been provided. 
In the rural high schools, in addition to class room instrue- 
tions in agriculture, a demonstrative plot system will be main- 
tained. It has been our constant purpose to so arrange the course 
of study that it may meet the needs of the greatest number of 
students possible and give to them the greatest possible returns 
for the time invested. The enrollment for the first year for all 
the high schools was 431, which exceeded our brightest hopes. 
Under provision of the act of the General Assembly of 1907 
the County Court; at its July session 1907, elected the following 
members of the County Board of Education to have charge of 
the grammar schools of the county: J. A. Hargraves, J. A. Pat- 
ten, W. S. Beck, W. I. Williams, M. L. Galloway. 
The board was organized with J. A. Hargraves, Chairman, 
and at once entered upon the arduous task of reorganizing the 
schools under the new system. Advisory boards of directors were 
asked to make their recommendations as to teachers and the 
needs of the schools of the various districts. The salary scale 
for teachers was agreed upon, whereby teachers should be paid 
according to their scholarship and experience. According to 
this scheme teachers’ salaries are increased from year to year. 
so long as service rendered is satisfactory and the rules and reg- 
ulations of the board have been fully complied with. 
‘We have a splendid body of teachers, and the work in most 
of the schools has been excellent. In others, where the condi- 
tions were less favorable, far from satisfactory, yet the teachers,
-P-A-G-E-287
—265—- 
almost without exception, were earnest and devoted to their duty. 
The pressing need of our county today is better qualified and 
better paid teachers. 
The plans of the board have been broad and progressive. 
They have looked well to the convenience and comfort of pupils 
and teachers. Needed repairs on buildings have been made and 
necessary equipment provided. The demand for new buildings 
has been great. This demand is being met as rapidly as the 
funds available will admit.. 
New buildings at Shady Grove and Avondale have been 
erected at a cost of $1,500 and $1,600 respectively. The Chat- 
tanooga Normal College, with nine and one-half acres, was pur- 
chased for the North Side Hill City School for the sum of 
$17,000. . 
The beard has contracted for the erection of a four-room 
‘ building at Sunnyside, and a seven-room and auditorium for the 
South Side Hill City for $8,000 and $16,000 respectively. At 
Hixson and Sale Creek the joint High School and Grammar 
School Boards have contracted for the erection of two two-room 
buildings at a cost of about $18,000 each. All of these buildings 
will be complete and ready for use during the early fall months 
of the 1908-9 term. 
The enrollment and attendance in communities where new 
buildings have been erected have been largely increased and the 
school spirit very much augmented. The enrollment and attend- 
ance in all the schools of the county for the 1907-8 term was 
9,906 and 6,013, respectively, as against 9,066 and 5,728 for 
1906-7 term. 
The number of teachers for 1907-8 was 132 white and 33 
colored, as against 120 white and 33 colored for 1906-7. 
The enrollment in the eighth grade for 1907-8 was 447, as 
against 348 in 1906-7. 
Certificates issued to pupils completing the eighth grade in 
1908 was 268 against 169 in 1906-7. ’ 
Brick buildings in 1908 were 15 as against 6 in 1907. 
Estimated inerease in value of school property apparatus, 
ete., June 30, 1908, was $127,000 over June 30, 1907. The aver- 
age number of days taught in 1907-8 was 155 against 149 in 
1906-7.
-P-A-G-E-288
—266— 
The average compensation of teachers (1907-8) for scholastic 
. month was $55.38 as against $47.49 in 1906-7. 
The rate of school tax on polls levied by the State and county 
in 1908 was $2 as against $1 in 1907. 
While our progress has been reasonably satisfactory we re- 
alize that we are far from the ideal. At the rate with which we 
are now progressing it will require a good many years of ar- 
duous work to bring our schools up to the standard to which 
they should attain. 
County INstiTvTe. 
Hamilton County comes forward with its usual good record 
‘in the matter of Teachers’ Summer Institute. The enrollment. 
in the white teachers’ institute this year was 136.. The session 
was for four weeks, beginning June 1 and continuing until June 
26. The interest was exceptionally good and the work done was 
of a superior order. Classes were organized in Latin, English 
Grammar, English Literature, Arithmetic, Algebra, Plane and 
Solid Geometry, American and. English Histories, Civics, Phys- 
ical Geography, Chemistry, Botany, Agriculture, Primary 
Methods, Manual Training, including drawing, paper folding, 
paper cutting, card board construction, clay modeling, color 
work, sloyd knife work, ete. 
In addition to our local talent, consisting of Profs. Darrah, 
Davis, Roark, Rogers, Kirkman, Bright, Setliffe, Miss Bibb, Mrs. 
Carter and Mrs. Russell, we had special work in Primary 
Methods by Miss Ethel Northern, Supervisor Primary Methods, 
Nashville public schools; special instruction in Agriculture by 
Prof. Josiah Main, Assistant in Agriculture, University of Ten- 
nessee, and an exposition of Webb & Ware’s system of drawing 
by Miss Mary Arthur, of Teachers’ Department, Peabody Col- 
‘lege. | 
In the colored teachers’ institute we had an enrollment of 
58. The institute was conducted for the same time, the work 
being done by members of the white teachers’ faculty, and the 
same degree of interest was manifested. 
The services of Prof. W. J. Hale as Conductor of the colored 
teachers’ institute were invaluable and we thank you for send- 
ing him. During the course of the institute the teachers enjoyed 
the privilege of hearing a number of addresses by the leading-
-P-A-G-E-289
  —267— 
educators and friends of education of our county and State. 
Notably among them were: Dr. Luther Freeman, Dr. Ira Bos- 
well, Supt. S. A. Mynders, Supt. Walter Anderson, Supt. O. M. 
Dugger, W. 8. Beck, J. A. Patten and Maj. C. R. Evans. : 
In a strong resolution the teachers unanimously endorsed 
your administration, characterizing the advance in school legis- 
lation as the greatest since the organization of the present school 
system.

County Superintendent. 
HANCOCK COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request I hereby submit a report 
of the school system of my county for the year 1907 and 1908: 
These years have been marked by great progress in the de- 
velopment of a sounder and better system—that is, officers are 
taking a greater interest, the public is cooperating as never 
before, teachers are better qualified, salaries are 25 per cent 
better and attendance is at least 20 per cent better. This great 
progress has been due to the Education Association, teachers’ 
institutes and the county board system. 
I have been holding teachers’ meetings and educational ral- 
lies throughout the county and I know they have done more for 
the cause in the county than any other thing. They have been 
the means of stirring our people and County Court to action. - 
The class of teachers this year is much ahead of what it was 
last year. I was forced to probate a few teachers last year, but. 
I announced that it would not be my policy in the future, and 
as a result 65 per cent of my teachers was in school last spring. 
Early in May I gave two weeks’ instruction to thirty teachers 
in the nature of a review of the studies to be taught, and in the
-P-A-G-E-292
—-270— 
meantime we had some valuable lectures on methods of teaching. 
These proved very valuable agencies in making our county. 
schools more efficient. I have been studying the standard of my 
teachers, and I am convinced that they are ready to meet a State 
examination, and it is my belief that a uniform examination 
would do more for education in Tennessee than any other law 
that could be passed. 
The Teachers’ Reading Circle has caused teachers to give 
much more time to professional reading and study, and it las 
given them new ideas of teaching and its relations. This spirit 
of growth and development in reading has caused our Teachers’ 
Association to open a library in the County Superintendent’s 
office. This library was opened less than six months ago, but it 
has more than $100 worth of pedagogical literature. The library 
keeps a full supply of Reading Circle books, and the teachers 
"are urged to read them. I believe a good teachers’ library in 
every county, filled with good pedagogical literature, would do 
much towards advancing the standard of teachers in Tennessee. 
When I was elected Superintendent there was not a graded 
school in the county, but I have endeavored to grade and feel 
that I have been very successful, although much remains to be 
done yet. 
The educational rally held here this fall has already been 
felt throughout the county. It aroused the people to the sense 
of duty towards their children, and as a result the County Board 
has had many applications for new and better houses and furni- 
ture. This is gratifying when it is known that our County 
Board requires the patrons to furnish one-half of the expenses 
of building and repair. 
Our greatest need is better houses and equipment, and this 
ean never be met until we receive more revenue, for our receipts 
are less than $12,000. If we hold the support of our court we 
must run our schools at least five months, and this will leave very 
little for repair. Our people are very anxious for the new 
school bill and a compulsory law. 
The schools of Hancock County are making rapid progress, 
and in the near future we hope to take our position at the head 
of the procession.

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
The schools of Hardeman County are in better condition 
under the county board system than when they were operated 
by district directors. The people in many parts of the county 
have been somewhat prejudiced against the new board system, 
but most of the opposition has given way and now we are re- 
ceiving encouragement on almost every hand. Better houses are 
contemplated. Many new desks have been placed in our inferior 
houses ; the salaries of teachers have been increased, and a better 
educational spirit prevails than under the old system. In some 
districts we have a few summer schools, and we hope to soon 
have no divided terms. 
Our greatest need is more school funds. If the County Board 
had ample funds with which to improve our houses and supply 
up to date facilities in every way for our schools we would soon 
have a system of schools that would be the pride of the entire 
county. The whole trouble is with the County Court. We have 
an earnest band of teachers, and a capable County Board, still 
on account of lack of funds we can’t possibly advance as we 
would like to. However, we have assurances from a few mem- 
bers of the County Court that we will have more county tax in 
the near future. 
County INstiruTE. 
The Hardeman County Teachers’ Institute met at Bolivar 
on June 22, and closed. on June 27. Prof. A. E. Emmons, of the 
Crainsville public school, acted as Conductor, assisted by the 
County Superintendent. Miss Clara Willson, of the Memphis 
city schools, taught primary methods in a most satisfactory way. 
Her work will prove a great inspiration to our teachers.

Prof. J. L. Brooks, of Ripley, came over one day and made 
a splendid speech upon the duties a teacher owes to his profes- 
sion. 
The attendance was exceedingly encouraging, and the interest 
was unusually good. The Reading Circle Course was given 
special attention, and a majority of the teachers were ready to 
be examined on the course. . 
.The outlook is encouraging in this county, and the teachers 
and people are, in the main, pleased with the county board sys- 
tem of administration.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
I beg leave to submit the following report from Hardin 
County ; 
The work of the Board of Education has made the work of 
the schools of the county a system. Better houses and better fur- 
niture are being supplied. Our standard of tedchers is being 
gradually raised by attendance upon teachers’ meetings, insti- 
tutes and by rigid examinations. 
We need better equipment for the schools of the county, 
which could be had through an increase in revenue for the 
publie schools. An agricultural high school would greatly ben- 
efit our county. This could be had in a county high school, with 
an agricultural department. 
Permanency in the teaching force is greatly needed in Hardin 
County. \

On Tuesday afternoon the Hardin County Teachers’ As- - 
sociation was called to order by Supt. Mangum and the business 
of electing officers for the ensuing year was taken up. The of- 
ficers chosen are as follows: .W. E. Rogers, President; J. W. 
Pickens, First Vice President; J. T. Ross, Second Vice Presi- 
dent; Miss Edna Black, Secretary; Miss Icie Barlow, Assistant 
Secretary and Treasurer; W. O. Mangum, Librarian. 
The Committee on Resolutions made their report, and the 
following resolution unanimously adopted: 
Resolved, That we hereby express our endorsement of the 
administration of the affairs of the office by Supt. Mangum, and, 
further, that we ask the County Court at its January term to 
further the interests of the schools by reelecting him Superin- 
tendent for another term. 
The institute opened June 29, 1908 and continued two weeks. 
The attendance was the largest in the history of our county, 
and the work done was very satisfactory.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
The educational progress made in Hawkins County, during 
the past two years cannot be told in annual reports, as results. 
are found in the interest of the people manifested in our publie 
schools, and in the qualification and work of our teachers. 
Our scholastic population is not as large now as reported 
two years ago, owing to the fact that reports have heretofore- 
been made in a great many instances on information and belief...
-P-A-G-E-299
. —277— 
The annual reports of our schools show that during the past: 
two years the number of children who can read and write has 
been greatly increased, and that the attendance has been much 
better each year. The reports received this year from teachers 
show that the enrollment and attendance is about 1,000 more 
than it was two years ago. Our County Board fixed the mini- 
mum average daily attendance for weak schools at 18 pupils, 
and at one-fourth the scholastic population for the other schools. 
This ruling of the board has increased the enrollment, and also 
the average daily attendance in our schools, and I can safely say 
that the annual report for the present school year will show the 
largest daily enrollment and average daily attendance that we 
have ever had. 
A graded course of study has been in the hands of teachers 
and school patrons for several years. During the past two years 
the grading of schools has been given special attention and all 
are now fairly well graded. Last year examination questions 
were sent. out for all pupils above the Fourth Grade. Certifi- 
cates. of promotion from the Fifth to the Sixth Grade were is- 
sued to 124 pupils. As last year was the first one in which ex- 
amination questions were sent out from the Superintendent’s 
office the number of pupils promoted was not as large as we 
expect this year. 
We have consolidated nine weak schools with other schools 
during the past two years. A few years ago we had 130 schools 
in the county, whereas we now have 100. 
The average salary of teachers two years ago was $29.40; 
the average salary this year is $34.75. + 
We have erected ten new school houses and furnished them. 
with patent desks. During the past six years 44 new school 
houses have been erected. 
Our school term has increased during two years from 97 to 
120 days, as will be shown by the annual report for the present. 
year. . . 
The county tax levy for schools has increased from 25 to 30: 
eents, and poll tax from $1.50 to $2.00. 
The amount of money spent for schools during the scholastic 
year 1906-7, as shown by the books of the County Trustee, was: 
$19,374.93. Since that time warrants outstanding were pre- 
sented for payment, making a little more than $20,000 expended. |
-P-A-G-E-300
—278— 
for school purposes that year. During the scholastic year 1907- 
. 1908-under the county board system, the amount of money spent 
for all school purposes was $19,621.51. The Board of Eduea- 
tion was paid per diem; the salary of the Superintendent was 
also paid out of the school funds; the salaries of experienced 
teachers were raised, and the school term was five days longer. 
This saving of funds was due to consolidation of schools; the 
building of houses by contract to the lowest bidders, and to a 
careful management of our school affairs. The amount of money 
on hand July 1, 1908, was $7,176.57. 
I visited all of the schools in the county last year, spending 
at least one-half day at each school. Where schools were not 
properly graded I assisted the teacher in making the adjust- 
ment necessary. In most all communities the people spoke of 
the progress of schools during the past two years. 
I believe our teachers during the past two years will com- 
pare favorably with those of the progressive counties of the State. 
~ We need a compulsory school law, a county high school, a 
number of new school houses and more money to run our schools 
longer. 
The improvements in many ways in the schools have devel- 
oped a pride on the part of parents and children, and teachers 
are very much encouraged with the outlook for greater progress. 
_ Schools are being better graded each year. 
Under the county board system we have paid teachers better 
salaries; had a longer school term; paid salary of Superintend- 
ent, and per diem of Board of Education, etc., with a less ex- 
penditure of money than last year. Our school term will be six 
months this year. 
"The county institute was the best attended we have had for 
years. Mr. Sam H. Hill was conductor and rendered valuable 
service. We were much pleased with his talks on school work.

HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
Our schools have shown marked improvement during the 
past few years. The monthly teachers’ meetings have been well 
attended through the whole year, and much interest has been 
taken in the adopted course of study for teachers. We pay 
better salaries than formerly, and there has been marked im- 
provement in the personnel of our teaching force and more of 
the teacher-spirit is in evidence than I have ever known before. 
As a rule, our school houses are in good condition, and many 
improvements have been made during the past year. Owing to 
the scattered state of our white population in parts of the county 
some of our schools are small, and many of them are necessarily 
so located that it seems impossible to combine them. For this 
reason we have few consolidated schools. : 
There is some lack of interest on the part of members of 
Advisory Boards, due mostly, I think, to their failure to appre- 
ciate the responsibilities and duties of the office since the change 
from district directors. 
Our white schools are kept open seven months during the 
year, and the colored schools four. Many of our people in the 
rural districts take their’ children from school during cotton 
picking time, and thus some of our schools are forced to sus- 
pend work for about two months. In many cases this seems un- 
avoidable, but our people need to realize the necessity of sacri- 
ficing for the child rather than for sacrificing the child. 
Our finances are in good shape, and I think we can safely say 
that our schools, as a whole, were never in better condition. *

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
In my opinion the greatest advancement in the schools of Hen- 
derson County has been brought about in the way of better pre- 
pared teachers as a.result of the two sessions of the State Insti- 
tute. I think I am right when I say that the standard of the 
teacher has been raised 50 to 75 per cent by the two sessions. We

have made other advancements. We have raised our tax rate 
from 15 cents for the county to 25 cents; we have consolidated 
some: schools;.we have built about nine new houses; we have 
lengthened the school term a few weeks, and there are other im- 
provements which are not-so important as the ones above men- 
tioned. - : W. H. Denison,

HENRY COUNTY. 
I am sending you under separate cover a photograph of one 
of our new one-room school’ houses, showing side and rear ele- 
vations. The board has built six houses after this plan this sum- 
mer; also three two-room houses. The educational outlook under 
the county board system is very promising. Already we are 
reaping benefits from it in the way of better teachers, better 
houses and longer terms. 
County Instrruts. 
Our: attendance was not quite to the usual standard, owing 
to the fact that twenty-seven of our teachers were, at this time, 
attending State Institutes. 
Miss Wilburn, of Lebanon, did splendid work for us, and 
one and all were united in praise of her work, and trust Henry 
County may be fortunate enough to secure her’ services again. 
Our work was conducted just as though’ we were in the school 
room, more practice and less theory being the spirit in which 
we worked.

HICKMAN COUNTY. 
Many solid advances have been made along many lines in the 
county schools. Under the county board system ten new school 
houses have been erected, patent desks have been put in, more 
than a score, besides repairs of various kinds have been made 
* on old houses. The county system is doing much for the county 
schools. The system is in general favor with the thinking public. 
The advisory system is very imperfect for our county. There 
are only eight civil districts,’and hence the advisory districts 
are so large that many schools have to look to County Board . 
for what the Advisory Board should do. It would be better in 
this county to have at least one advisory man for each school. 
The board is building, repairing and furnishing houses as 
fast as funds will allow. Every school last year and this has 
run six months, provided the attendance would permit, a thing 
never before known in the county. 
County InsriTuTE. 
This is the best institute in the history of Hickman County. 
Supt. T. J. Coats, of Richmond, Ky., was our conductor. He 
gave us one of the best institutes in the history of the county. 
His work was an inspiration to our county. ‘The outlook for 
our schools is the best they have ever been.

Hickman, County {nstirurE ror CoLoRED:’ TEACHERS. 
The following I most respectfully submit as my report of the 
institute held in this county for colored teachers: 
The institute opened June 8, 1908, continuing one week. 
Each day was divided into a morning and evening session. The 
work was confined to the Primary Course. I found T. J. Clin- 
isson, one of the county teachers, of much help. 
Throughout the week the utmost accuracy was observed in 
the matter of time, every exercise beginning on the minute. This 
object lesson in promptness will bear fruit in the future work of 
the teachers in attendance. , 
The institute’ was an educational revival for the county. 
Citizens as well as teachers attended each day, and the benefit
-P-A-G-E-309
—285— 
to the general public was as great as to the teachers. The instruc-. 
tion given elicited enthusiastic commendation from both teachers 
and spectators. , 
County Superintendent W. P. Morrison visited the institute 
and favored the teachers with one of his inspiring lectures, which 
was: punctuated with many good points and sound advice. He 
complimented the institute on the good work being done. / 
The teachers, by resolutions, thanked the State Superintend- 
ent for sending them the Conductor. 
In the examination that closed the institute the teachers were 
given a test on the reading course preseribed by you. 
Permit me to say: I think these institutes the most practical 
methods for molding and building up the educational system 
of the State. J. B. Batts, 
Conductor. 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
The progress of the schools in our county in the past two 
years is not what it should have been. We need more money, 
better houses and equipments, higher salaries for teachers and 
the Superintendent, and require the Superintendent to give his 
entire time to the schools. The teachers are doing good work, 
but they need more attention.

Our teachers did good work in the institute and went to their

HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
Complying with your request of the 5th inst., beg to submit 
the following report of schools in my county: 
The educational interest of the county is growing. There is 
a better interest among teachers in their work than ever before. 
They have kept up their regular monthly meetings during the 
last two years without a break, with a good average attendance 
for the’ entire time, a thing never done here before. In 1907 
about forty-four teachers attended our annual institute, while 
this year we had an enrollment of seventy-three. 
Reports received so far this fall, from the school officers and 
patrons, show that the schools are being better taught this year 
than iast, and a better school interest. 
Two years ago such a thing as a county high school was un- 
heard of, but now it is being favorably considered by many of 
our best citizens. We hope that the county will establish a sys- 
tem of such schools within a short time. 
The people seem to be waking up to their duties with refer- 
ence to school matters, but there is considerable indifference yet 
in soine sections. The county board system of government is an 
improvement over the old system, but it has not been in opera- 
tion here long enough to accomplish many desired results. 
We need first of all a system of good county high schools, and 
about one-third of our schools consolidated with other schools. 
We have too many schools with only about twelve or fifteen pu- 
pils in average daily attendance. Our board will make a move 
in. this direction this year. ‘ 
We need better school houses and better locations for schools. 
Too many of our schools are taught in country churches in no 
way suited for the purpose, and too many have yet the old- 
fashioned kind of seats, which are very tiresome for the pupils 
to sit on. We need also better locations. We have too many 
schools situated in out of the way places, inconvenient to get to, 
and in no way suited for school grounds. , 
No new buildings have been erected this year, but we have 
put a $9,000 addition on to the public school building here in 
the county seat, Waverly.

Counry InstiruTe. 
I consider my institute this year a decided success. We had 
more primary work done this year than ever before, and the 
larger part of it was new to the teachers; and they took hold 
of it with as much enthusiasm as could have been expected, really 
more than I had anticipated they would. We have never had but 
little work of the kind in the county, and the ‘teachers seemed 
anxious to get hold‘of the best methods known. The older ones 
seemed to realize that they were deficient along this line of work. 
We have about seventy-six white teachers in the county, and 
all attended the institute that could. Some were detained on 
account of sickness, and one went to the State Institute, and one 
was prevented on account of circumstances which he could 
not control. I think this a pretty good record for a backward 
county in ‘educational work. But we are coming to the front, 
and if we remain in office another term, we expect to keep the 
interest growing. I have written you already in reference to 
the work of the instructors.

JACKSON COUNTY. 
Below is given a condensed report of J: ackson County schools 
We have eliminated eight small schools and consolidated 
seven. Have a practical, permanent organization of teachers, 
with a clause in by-laws which compels teachers to attend all 
meetings. 
Many of our smaller and heretofore much neglected schools 
were this year given our best teachers, and the change is whole- 
some. Average teachers’ salary has been increased from $29.53 
to $39.55. Average duration of schools has increased from 88 
to 110 days. Enrollment of pupils increased from 69.4 per cent 
to 74.6 per cent. Attendance from 63.5 per cent to 79.8 per cent. 
Attendance of teachers on monthly meetings has increased from

54.8 per cent to 92.6 per cent. Public school property has been 
improved to extent of $7,500. Percentage of failures in annual 
examinations has fallen off, while average grade of teachers in 
such examinations has increased ‘from ‘80.6 per cent to 85.4 per 
cent. “ 
Teachers are reading more than formerly. Nearly every one 
is highly pleased with the county board system. Those who 
formerly opposed it are now its ardent supporters. 
A majority of our people favor a compulsory attendance law.

JAMES COUNTY. 
- In reply to your recent request I wish to say that there has _ 
been a great improvement in the schools of our county during 
the last two years. There has been a great deal done in the way 
of providing better buildings. Under the management of the 
County Board of Education there have been many buildings 
repaired; two new houses have taken the place of older ones, 
and one additional building has been erected for the colored. 
The. most encouraging feature of the work has been the in 
terest manifested in the annual institute and the monthly teach- 
ers’ meetings: Better results are also being seen in the methods
-P-A-G-E-318
—292— 
of instruction. As a whole, I think we have a better corps of 
teachers this -year than ever before in James County. 
Our greatest need at present is more money to get many 
‘of the buildings in better shape and to lengthen the school term.

JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
In compliance with the requirements of law I herewith sub- 
mit to you the annual report of the publie schools of Jefferson 
County for the year ending June 30, 1908. In submitting this 
report I wish to call your attention to some of the conditions 
of the schools of the county. 
The year 1907-8 was the most successful in the history of our 
present public school system. Never before was there such in- 
terest manifested on the part of not only the teachers, but also 
the. school officials and the students. I attribute at least the 
greater part of the interest shown to the new publie school law 
enacted in the spring of 1907. The interest on the part of the 
teachers, officials and patrons had much to do with the increased 
average daily attendance of the pupils for the past term. The 
average daily attendance was increased about 15 per cent.. The
-P-A-G-E-320
—294— 
average length of term for the schools of the county has also 
been increased 15 days, and then leaving a surplus in the treasury 
in round numbers more than $5,300. This was made possible 
by the increase of the State fund and an increase in the tax levy. 
(An additional 5 cents was levied by the County Court in Jan- 
uary, 1907.) 
Our County is in excellent financial shape as compared with 
two years ago, and the outlook for the current year is favorable 
for even a six months’ term, with a nice surplus left on hand for 
the incoming year. At the January term of the County Court 
1908 the poll tax levy was increased 50 cents, so that will give us 
another increase of fund. 
The teachers’ salary has been inereased about $5 per month 
throughout the county in the past two years. 
The school officials have built three new school buildings in 
the past two years; they have also bought a good supply of school 
furniture for many buildings, and in addition to this they pur- 
chased one brick building costing $3,750, at a bargain of at least 
$2,000, the photograph of which we herein submit to you. These 
things with other facts tell of the year’s work, which we think 
to be well done. Our people are interested in this work and we 
are looking forward to a successful close of the year, which is 
now opened with flattering prospects. 
County Instrrurs. 
I have been more than delighted with the work done in our 
institute this year. The attendance was good and the interest 
splendid throughout. The entire faculty was well pleased with

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
The educational interest in Johnson County is gradually get- 
ting better each year, and for the last two years we have had, 
as a whole, very successful schools. Patrons have been taking 
a greater interest than formally, and this year the enrollment 
has been larger, and a better daily attendance, than we have 
had for the last five years. We have good school houses, seated. 
with patent desks, a teachers’ library established and a teachers’ 
association, meeting each month. ‘ 
_The members of our County School Board are very much 
alive to our educational needs and interested in the work. There 
has been established a county high school, in connection with 
the city school, at Mountain City, and a graduate of Vanderbilt 
University is principal. -This school is doing a good work for 
the county. 
Looking at the educational situation now and two years ago 
I feel warranted in saying that we have made a great improve- 
ment in our work. But to make greater progress we need more 
funds, better educated teachers and a compulsory school law. 
* County Instrrure. 
Our Institute held in June -was voted by all to be the best 
we have ever had. Prof. R. M. Shipp was ably assisted by Prof. 
George Simmons, and both gave entire satisfaction. The in- 
- struction was thorough, and the instructors had the undivided 
attention of the teachers to the finish. It was through the cour- 
tesy of the State Superintendent that we had Prof. Simmons. 
He is a very strong man and did us excellent work. We might 
say in conclusion that our institute was a grand success.

KNOX COUNTY. 
It is gratifying to report the largest per cent of enrollment 
and attendance ever recorded in Knox County. The school term 
of Jast year was eight days longer than the term of the preceding 
year, and we have the assurance of a term one month longer for 
the ensuing year than the term of last year. 
_ The teachers carry with them to the present year’s work bet- 
ter qualifications, a more ardent zeal and higher enthusiasm than 
they ever before carried to the work. Realizing that strong 
teachers constitute the first essential to successful schools, we 
have devoted more time and energy to the selection and the de- 
velopment of an able corps of teachers than to any other line of’ 
work. 
The teachers’ meetings have been well attended. The last. 
meeting was the largest in the history of the Knox County 
Teachers’ Association. 
Two hundred and thirty teachers out of a total of two hun- 
dred and forty-seven availed themselves of the excellent oppor- 
tunity for improvement offered by the Summer School of the 
South. This constituted our institute work for the year. 
The institute for our colored teachers, made possible by the 
aid of the State Superintendent and by an appropriation from 
the County Court, was appreciated by the ninety teachers who 
attended, and the results can be seen in the improved condition 
in every colored school in the county. 
We instituted last year a plan for placing a library in every 
school in the county. Teachers, pupils and patrons entered ear- 
nestly into the work, and, without one cent of cost to the Board 
of. Education, libraries were placed in almost all the schools. 
. The work is being continued and pushed to completion this year.. 
The books for libraries were carefully selected by a committee, 
and are so classified as to meet the needs of the respective grades. 
Since tite close of the scholastic year we have erected three 
splendid two-room buildings. Each of these takes the place of 
two school buildings, thus substituting three schools for six. 
There is in process of construction a four-room frame building 
at Fountain City. This takes the place of a rented hall. Addi- 
tions have been erected to six buildings, the increased attendance
-P-A-G-E-325
. —299— 
making this necessary. All the building has been done according 
to the plans and under the directions of reliable architects. 
There is perfect harmony between the County Board of Ed- 
ucation and the Advisory Boards, and neither board can under- 
stand just how to carry on the work without the aid of the other 
board. 
The rural schools for the current year are now in progress. 
The enrollment is much larger than ‘the enrollment of last year; 
it will probably reach 82 per cent of the scholastic population. 
We. have daily calls for more room. How can we furnish room 
for those demanding admittance to the Knox County schools? 
How can we furnish the necessary equipment? How can we 
make the work more efficient? These are the questions that con- 
front us. . 
County InstrTuTE. 
In Knox County we use the Summer School of the South as 
our institute. The County Court usually appropriates $2,000 
to pay for the enrollment at the Summer School. You will no- 
tice that 228 took the examination, and that we issued 248 cer- 
tificates. Some teachers took the State examination, secured 
State certificates, and we issued county certificates to those. Some 
held Roll of Honor certificates and we issued certificates ‘to them. 
So we reached a total of 248. :

‘We held no county institute this year. Our teachers pre- 
ferred to attend the Summer School at Knoxville and the State 
institutes. 
I find that the county system of school management has 
worked exceedingly well in my county. The attendance and en 
rollment has inereased; the school term was lengthened for an 
average of two months over the county; better teachers were em- 
ployed, better salaries paid, and the finances of the schools were,. 
for the first time, administered in a business like and methodical.

LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
It is not my purpose to be the least boastful of my county, 
put I consider it a conservative statement to say of the school 
work here during the last two years that it has made some de- 
cided progress. This advancement I attribute to the activity of 
the present State Superintendent, the generous acts of the 
County Court and a general revival of interest throughout the 
county. During these two years the county tax levy has been 
raised from 15 to 25 cents; teachers’ salaries now range from: 
$60 to $100 per month instead of from $30 to $60; the number 
of consolidated schools continues to increase, and there are now 
sixteen schools running eight months. Last year’s report,showed 
a decrease in the number of schools, with no increase in popula- 
tion, but a considerable gain in attendance. There has been a 
uniform graded course of study adopted, which is so symtem- 
atizing the work that a teacher or pupil may change schools with 
little inconvenience or loss of time. There have been six modern 
buildings erected, a number of others improved, and several 
hundred trees planted. 
The central feature of our improvement is the County High 
School, which has just opened. This school is carrying a full” 
four-year course, and, with its three teachers, fifty pupils and 
a modern $2,000 building, is now claiming a place among the 
leading high schools of the country. Yet with this gained the 
main body of our schools is not what it should and must be. Our 
primary need just at present is better equipped and more en- 
thusiastic teachers. G. G. McLaop, 
/ County Superintendent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
The schools of Lawrence County have made substantial 
progress during the past two years. A greater interest on the 
part of the parents has been manifested. The rallies that have 
been held are to a great extent the cause of this interest, but 
it has been ably seconded by the efforts the teachers have put 
forth in their respective communities for the betterment of the 
schools. They have labored earnestly to secure the cooperation 
of the parents, and their labors have been rewarded.
-P-A-G-E-328
—302— 
A County Teachers’ Organization has been organized. Its 
monthly meetings have been well attended and a good interest 
‘shown. 
One of the things which the Superintendent has earnestly 
labored for is a graded system of schools. This is the second 
year of the effort, and it is proving to be a very effective agent 
in getting the schools into a more perfect organization. There 
is a uniform course of study, with a certain amount of work to 
be done: in a definite time. This brings the schools into one har- 
monious body each independent yet in uniformity with the other. 
This is followed at the close of the term with uniform exami- 
nations given by the Superintendent. Promotion ecards are is- 
sued which, for the present year, has caused a more regular 
attendance. : 
The erection of new school buildings in different parts of the 
county has caused such a cry to come up for more that the board 
has not been able to meet the demands because of the lack of 
funds. The houses that are now being erected are comfortable, 
substantial and attractive. They are modeled after the plans 
sent out by the State and are especially constructed for school 
purposes. 
The standard of teaching has been raised in this county. It 
is being kept equal to that of the State. There is not a more 
loyal band of teachers in any county that are working in har- 
mony with the County Superintendent than there are here. The 
salaries have been raised, thé average salary for this year being 
$40 per month. The result of this has been to keep our best 
and most experienced teachers in the profession. There was a 
smaller number of beginners employed this year than any year 
heretofore. 
The greatest step of advancement was made by the County 
Court at its January term, 1908, when it voted to establish a 
County High School. The High School Board located the school 
at Lawrenceburg. Mr. D. C. Stunkard, a man of wide expe- 
rience and scholarship, was elected as the principal. He is ably 
’ assisted by a strong corps of teachers. The school opened its 
first session August 31, with a good enrollment, and the pros- 
pects for its suecess seem to be certain. It is the- purpose of the 
authorities to establish a school to meet the demands of the peo- 
ple, and give the boys and girls of the rural schools an equal 
chance with the boys and girls in the large centers of population.

* : The new law passed at the last session of the Legislature, 
known as the County Board law, is proving to be the most ef- 
fective agency in improving our school conditions. It has so 
proven in Lawrence County, and the effects will be greater when 
given more time for the workings of it.. It has put system into 
the managing of our schools and enables us to approach that of 
our best city systems. Our greatest needs are better buildings, 
better attendance, trained teachers and. closer supervision. 
County Instiruts. 
The Lawrence County Teachers’ Institute for 1908 was one 
of the most successful we have ever had. In 1906 and 1907 the 
State Institute was located with us. These two years had given 
fine opportunities for our teachers; so it was a difficult problem 
to follow these two years with just a county institute. We se- 
eured a splendid faculty. Miss Polk, of Nashville, gave work 
in primary methods, value of which cannot be estimated. J. B. 
Clark, with arithmetic, grammar and physiology; D. C. Stunk- 
ard, with the Reading Circle; J. J. Loux, with history and 
geography, all gave their work with marked ability as instrue- 
tors. The work was easily grasped by the teachers, who showed 
the most remarkable interest I ever saw in an institute of any 
kind. Webb and Ware furnished a teacher in drawing, but she 
got here for only two days’ work: I think what she has given 
is going to’ mark the beginning of it in our schools. One period 
on the program was given for agriculture, public addresses and 
other subjects. 
Prof. White, of Hohenwald; T. M. Massey, of Pulaski; Jas. 
A. Tate, of Harriman, and J. W. Brister, of Peabody College, 
delivered addrésses during the institute. 
The circulating library for the rural schools was thoroughly 
discussed, both as to its value and the best way to get it started. 
It was decided to begin this year, so sixty-three of the teachers 
pledged themselves to make the effort to raise the funds for us 
to secure this library for the coming session. 
One period was taken up in the discussion of the general 
educational bill. Each point of the same was gone over for the 
special information of the teachers, after which it was unani- 
mously indorsed by the, institute. / : 
The examination was plain and practical, yet none but old 
teachers made the general average, which ‘emphasizes the fact
-P-A-G-E-330
—304— 
that a county must train its teachers, and this brings about the 
importance of the County High School.

LEWIS COUNTY. 
Lewis County has built: two new school houses and repaired 
‘a number of others. The schools have been lengthened from three 
to-five months. The. people are demanding bbtter teachers in 
the country schools, and teachers with age and experience.: 
The county needs a, county high school, and fewer and better 
houses. Attendance is poor, and anything to increase it will be 
helpful to the schools of the county.

LOUDON COUNTY. 
Educational conditions in Loudon County are more encourag- 
ing and more favorable than they have ever been. Our people. 
are interested in the work, and our children are flocking to school 
as they have never flocked. There are more pupils in the schools 
of Loudon County, by at least 400, than in all its previous his- 
- tory. The attendance is far more regular and the interest more 
intense. : 
Today, exclusive of Lenoir City with its 600 in daily attend- 
ance, we have, in this county, six schools with a daily attendance 
of 125 each. Formerly we had only one. 
Last month we opened: two new school houses, one of four 
rooms and one of two, and these are now in active operation with 
four and two teachers respectively. 
Our teachers are earnest and active and are doing all they 
can to promote the good work. They are studious, and are striv- 
ing by every means in their power to thoroughly qualify them- 
selves for the. work. / 
We now have three high schools and one secondary school in 
the county—one at the county seat, one at Lenoir City and one at 
Philadelphia, with the secondary school at Morganton. Of 
course, the High School.at Lenoir City belongs to the city, but 
we have made provision for the teaching of high school pupils 
of the Second District there. The High Schools at Loudon and 
Philadelphia are private schools, but arrangements have also 
been made with them: ‘So far these arrangements have been very 
satisfactory. Nevertheless, we feel-that we need a county high 
school, supported: by the county, and entirely devoted to high 
school work. We think we shall secure-this at the next term 
of the County Court. 
The county board system is working like a charm. We need 
more two and three-room houses, more apparatus, more maps 
and charts, more trained teachers, longer terms, fewer schools 
and more consolidation. (The County Superintendent is not 
popular in one or two nooks for advocating and working for 
consolidation.) To secure all of these and more we need more 
money, and all our people are heartily in favor of the general 
edueation bill. It it were left to’ the people of London County 
it would ‘be passed without a dissenting voice. 
All in all it is our opinion that in the last six years we have
-P-A-G-E-335
—-307— 
made great progress, and we look to the future with great hope. 
Truly the day is breaking, nay, more, the sun has risen with 
healing in his rays, and ignorance in Tennessee will soon be a 
negative quality. 
County Institute. 
The 1908 institute was, without doubt, the very best and the 
most successful. ever held in the county. The attendance was 
large; the regularity very good, and the punctuality almost per- 
fect. The time was mainly spent on methods, and we feel sure 
that the splendid work done here will tell for good in the teach- 
ing this fall. ; 
Principal J. H. Jarvis, of Lenoir City, had charge of the 
English and School Management and did splendid work in both 
of these subjects. All in all, we are satisfied with the work done, 
everything considered, and are looking forward to a successful 
school year. 
The educational work of the county is moving along very 
smoothly, and while we are not making any great or rapid strides, 
we can safely say that the general trend is upward and onward. 
Lenoir City, Philadelphia and Loudon maintain first class sec- 
ondary schools nine months a year. The high school movement 
is gaining ground.

MACON COUNTY. 
Complying with your request of October 5 will state that the 
educational progress of Macon County during the past two years 
is very marked. The people have grown more in favor of con- 
solidation, thus paving the way for fewer and better schools. 
The rural patrons have been taking more interest in patronizing 
the public schools, and have, thereby, caused a wonderful in- 
crease in the attendance. : 
There has been a great improvement in the competency of 
the teachers of the county. This has been done by difficult ex- 
aminations and a gradual raise in the salary. 
We would not fail to mention the effect of the county board 
system in bringing about a uniformity of salaries, as well as 
length of term. Two years ago some teachers, who were fully 
as competent as others, were receiving $10 or $15 less per month; 
but such is not the case under the county board system; some 
schools were less than two-thirds the duration of others, while 
now each school in the county runs, as nearly as practicable, 
the same number of days. 
The County Court has levied the nécessary tax to entitle us 
to a pro rata of the funds so wisely given by the State,
-P-A-G-E-338
—310— 
Upon the whole, the outlook for the success of Macon County 
schools, both white and colored, is very flattering indeed, judg- 
ing by the interest manifested by teachers, patrons and pupils. 
However, our county needs better houses and school grounds, 
and these cannot be secured without more money, which we hope 
to have in the near future. 
County InstiTUTE. 
The 1908 Macon County Teachers’ Institute is conceded to 
have been one of the most interesting and best attended insti- 
tutes ever held in Macon County. The institute continued four 
days, consisting of a review of the public school curriculum, 
lectures by the instructors, regular work in the theory and prae- 
tice of teaching and drills and discussions as to the best methods 
of study teaching and school government. 
The teachers of Macon County join me in expressing our 
sineere thanks to Hon. Robert L. Jones for sending us such an 
able instructor in Supt. W. Frank Albright, of Gallatin. 
I must mention the efficient work of local instructors, who 
did so much for the success of the institute. 
Our teachers are going forth more determined than ever to 
succeed, and we predict the most successful year in the history 
of Macon County schools.

McMINN COUNTY. 
The progress made in the public schools of McMinn County 
during the past two years has been very great. More has been 
accomplished under the county board system than in several 
years under the old director system. During the two years we 
have built several new houses and equipped them with good 
furniture. We need more houses, with better equipment of 
_ others. We need more money for building and equipment of 
houses in the county, and more money to pay for longer terms 
of school, as we can only have four months’ term after making 
expenditures for buildings and furniture that we have made 
during the past two years. 
County INSTITUTE. 
This report has been difficult to make from the fact that 
about thirty of our teachers attended the State Normal at Madi- 
sonville and received State and county certificates. These were 
not required to attend the county normal. Others bélonged to 
the County Association and took the Reading Course and were 
examined in the same, which left only about thirty-seven to be 
examined at normal—sixteen colored and twenty-one whites— 
but I have combined all. 
We had a very interesting normal. Both white and colored 
were in session the same week. Prof. Simpson, of Loudon, was 
with us. His work was greatly appreciated by the teachers. We 
are moving along successfully, building new houses and equip- 
ping them.

McNAIRY COUNTY. 
I herewith hand you my annual report and such data as I 
have to aid you in making your annual report. 
I am glad to.report. improved conditions in McNairy County. 
Our schools.are running five months. We have added something 
like $3,000 to. the value of our school property by the erection 
of new houses and repairing the old ones. Our teaching foree 
has been improved. At least 20 per cent of our teachers are 
spending the money they earn teaching in going to school them- 
selves. Some of them are now in the leading normal schools 
taking special work. 
I am glad to report that MeNairy County has joined ¢ the 
progressive throng. We have a splendid County Court, whose 
members have heartily cooperated with me in securing an in- 
crease in our tax rate, thus enabling us to secure additional 
state aid. Our County Board has worked in perfect harmony ; 
the people are interested, and the prospect is encouraging. 
I thank you for giving us Miss Bowen to help in the county 
institute. Her primary work was satisfactory, and she was quite 
a favorite with our teachers.

Our schools have made rapid progress in the last two years. 
‘We have increased: the term from 89 to 120 days; graded the 
salaries so that our best teachers get much better salaries. We 
have put, 1,100 new single desks in the county; built eight new 
school buildings; enlarged four, and painted about half of our 
buildings; put water coolers in them, and teachers’ desks and 
chairs and window shades in nearly all of them. We have started. 
libraries all over the county and have pictures going up every 
day. We are doing everything we ever heard of or read of and 
shall continue till we have the best in the State. 
We need more money and four good county high schools.

MARION COUNTY. 
When the change from the district director system to the 
County Board plan was made the teachers of our publie schools 
had already been employed and several of the schools were in 
session. While the County Board of Education ratified the ac- 
tion of the directors in employing the teachers and setting their 
salaries the change created considerable confusion. The district 
advisory boards did not well understand their powers and du- 
ties, and many of them failed to act in harmony with the County 
Board. The teachers themselves were unable to procure the 
proper attention and cooperation of the advisory boards, and the 
schools were more or less demoralized and confused the first year 
under the new system, but since the County Board has assumed 
full control of the situation, and the people have. become better 
acquainted with the new law, our school work is moving along 
smoothly, and the indications are that the new law will be very 
much more satisfactery than the old. 
The County Board has already done much for the improve- 
ment of our schools and school property. The board has gone 
about its work in a business like way. It has investigated the 
titles to all the school property, and had all deeds registered, 
and where no deed had been given the board has taken steps to 
have deeds made in due form of law. It has already consoli- 
dated several schools and has committees investigating the fea- 
sibility of consolidating others. It has erected several good 
school houses and repaired others. It has increased the salaries 
of our teachers and is demanding better and more professional 
work of them. ° 
Each member of the board has fully complied with the law 
in visiting the schools of his district, and, in my judgment, has 
created additional interest among the people in the cause of 
popular education. I ‘believe the present law will become very 
popular when its merits are better known, as my opinion is that 
it is a great improvement over the old way. -D. A. Tats,

MAURY COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request for a statement in regard to 
the progress of the public schools of Maury County during the 
past two years, and their present needs, I beg to submit the 
following: 
CONSOLIDATION. 
Some progress has been made in the consolidation of schools, 
although it was usually opposed by a larger per cent of the peo- 
ple affected. In the County Superintendent’s report of 1906 
the number of schools reported was 138; the last report shows 
125. More of this work is needed and will be done as fast as the 
funds at the disposal of the County Board of Edueation will 
permit. As it requires a considerable outlay of money to locate
-P-A-G-E-347
ca 
—319— ‘ 
and erect the new buildings made necessary by consolidation, 
only a small part of this work can be done in any one year with- 
out diminishing the length of school term. 
ScHoot Property. 
In a great many of our communities the school houses are 
uncomfortable and unsightly, and are not equipped. with desks 
and other modern school furniture. But the number of such 
houses is growing smaller each year, and desks are taking the 
place of benches so ill adapted to school work. The County 
Board of Education is doing all it can. In addition, the ques- 
tion of improving the buildings and grounds has been discussed 
from time to time in our teachers’ meetings, and as a result sev- 
eral enterprising teachers, with the cooperation of their pupils, 
have raised money enough to paint and paper the buildings 
where they teach. Within thé last two years more than $6,000 
has been spent on the erection of new buildings and the improve- 
ment of old ones. / - 
Twacuine. Force. 
Owing to short terms of employment and small salaries we 
lose a large per cent of our experienced teachers each year. More 
than 30 per cent of the teachers employed at present are young 
and without experience. However, there is a marked improve- 
ment iti school spirit among the teachers. This is partly due to 
the compulsory Reading Course. We now have an average at- 
tendance at our monthly teachers’ meetings of 80 per cent of 
the teachers as against 40 per cent before the Reading Course 
was adopted and made compulsory. ! 
.. ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The report of the enrollment and attendance this year shows 
a decrease rather than an increase. We believe this is due to 
the fact that under the district system many schools, the fall 
and spring terms of which were taught by different teachers, 
were improperly reported by both teachers as if they were inde- 
pendent schools. The fact i is the schools are better attended than 
ever before.
-P-A-G-E-348
—320— 
ScHoot SENTIMENT. 
The public school sentiment is not what it should be. Many 
of our best citizens have patronized and still patronize private 
schools and are not working for the betterment of the public 
schools. The question of improving our public schools has been 
-agitated in the county papers and in public and private discus- 
sions until we now find a growing sentiment among our best citi- | 
zens to invest enough in our public schools to make them meet 
the needs of all classes of citizens.

“By the consolidation of schools our term*has inereased in 
Jength to five months. We are’paying our teachers better sal- 
‘aries than we were two years ago.. Two of the best school build-_ 
ings in the county have been completed during that period. 
_ . The Reading Circle work has aroused a greater interest: in 
our institutes. - 
“We need more money in order to increase the length of our 
school term. We need several more comfortable school houses. 
Only eight schools in the county are provided with desks. 
‘We need more teachers with special training, and a better 
enrollment and average daily attendance.

J. G. Pau, 
County Superintendent. 
  MONROE COUNTY. 
Complying with your request of recent date I beg to advise. 
that two years ago the schools of Monroe County were doing but 
little good. The teachers manifested very little interest in any- 
thing other than their salaries. The pupils and parents appeared 
to have even less interest. In the spring of 1907 I asked-for a 
State Institute, which request was granted. The same request. 
was made in 1908, and we were again given an institute. These 
institutes under the able management provided by the State 
Superintendent, have been the means of inspiring our teachers 
and-creating general interest in public school affairs. The re- 
sult is that there has been an increase in attendance and a 
marked increase in the interest shown in the school room. I do 
not think that I am exaggerating when I say that the character 
of the work that is being done in our schools this year is fully 
100 per cent better than the work that was done in 1906. This 
is due largely to the State institutes held in our county, and 
partially to the new school law, placing the management of the 
schools under a County Board. This new system is working 
admirably in our county. At first there was some dissatisfac- 
tion among a few of the people; especially among the local di- 
rectors, but this does not now exist. Our people have gotten ac- 
quainted with the new order of affairs and are well pleased with 
it. Some very inefficient teachers have been gotten rid of, while
-P-A-G-E-354
—324— oo 
others have made very marked advance in order that they may 
be able to. maintain positions as teachers in the county. ~ 
The Board of Education is having some good school houses 
built, and supplying furniture to others, so that our. equipment 
is getting better. : 
Some of the needs of the public schools of Monroe, County 
are, first, more money, so as to enable us to run our schools eight 
months in the year; second, a compulsory school law, and third, 
another State Institute to be held at Madisonville in 1909. 
During the last two scholastic years we have had very suc-- 
eessful State institutes conducted at’ Madisonville by the able 
and efficient Superintendent, S. G. Gilbreath. He was very ably © 
assisted by Profs. Darrah, M. R. M. Burk, W. N. Billingsly and 
Miss Arthur. It affords me great pleasure to commend the 
management and instruction of the institute as being the ablest 
the State can produce. The faculty had the hearty cooperation 
of every teacher in the county. We predict that much good will 
continue to come from the institutes. 
I prevailed upon the County Court at its last January term 
to establish a county high school. I expect a great many of our 
fifth grade pupils to take the secondary and high school courses, 
and that a class of normal-trained teachers will be turned out 
who will considerably raise the standard of our public schools. 
The County Board of Education system is proving a decided. 
success over the old directorship. Our board is a very efficient 
one, doing a great deal to raise school funds, as well as using 
diseretion in their expenditure of the same. 
This report is intended to cover the county part of the State 
Institute, or rather the Monroe County teachers who took part 
in the State Institute.

MOORE COUNTY. 
The educational interest in Moore County for. the past two 
years has somewhat improved, though it is far from satisfactory. 
A graded course of study has been put into operation, and the 
school work is on a much better basis than heretofore. — 
Most of our teachers are intelligent and efficient workers, and 
they give satisfaction wherever they go. We-have a County 
Teachers’ Association, which meets monthly. This work has 
been a great means in giving the teachers broader culture. . 
Some of our school buildings were enlarged and improved 
last year. A few schools have libraries, which are aiding the pu- 
pils greatly in their school work. 
While our county remains under the old directory system 
we cannot hope to accomplish much: A lack of uniformity in 
our system hinders us from doing what we could otherwise do. 
Let. us. hope that the next Legislature will extend the County | 
Board law to the whole State without any exceptions. 
County InstiruTs. 
The Moore County Teachers’ Institute was held in the Lynch- 
burg Academy June 15-26. The attendance was good and much 
interest was taken in the work. 
Prof. F. M. Bowling, of Eagleville, rendered us valuable 
assistance. in pedagogy and methods of teaching grammar, his- 
tory and arithmetic. We also had several talks from visiting 
teachers. 
At. the close. of the institute officers were elected for our 
Teachers’. Association, which meets monthly throughout the year. 
Our schools are better graded now, and, on the whole, the edu- 
cational outlook is encouraging.

MORGAN COUNTY. a 
Two years ago cur school term was only 97 days, whereas, 
now, we run 140 days. Before that time it was a rare occur- 
renee to erect a new school house, while last year we. built three - 
frame houses, and this year five, ranging in value.from $300 to 
$1,000 each. The daily attendance has greatly increased, and - 
the interest among both teachers and patrons has morethan 
doubled, and as a result there has been established four more 
secondary schools; and the time has come when we can no longer 
do without the advantages of a good high school located at some 
* convenient place. 
Some of our most important needs are: (a) a high school, 
(b) funds sufficient to run every school in the county 160 days, 
{e) professional teachers and (d) a compulsory school law. 
County Insrrrurs. 
Our institute was held in our new and commodious court- 
house, which was an ideal place for such work. Unusual in- 
terest was given from start to finish; more prompt and regular 
attendance than ever before, and the best of order prevailed. 
The instruction was of a thorough and practical nature. The 
teachers unanimousiy voted that this institute was the most - 
helpful that had ever been held in this county. 
The grade. of teachers this year is by far better than I have 
ever oxamined before. They are more interested in their work 
than usual, and the patrons, as a whole, are more appreciative 
of the worthy efforts of the teachers than formerly. 
The educational awakening, which is sweeping over Morgan 
County, is having the desired effect; and it is to be most earn- 
estly hoped that the next Legislature will see it wise to give us 
a compulsory school. law which will prove the panacea of all 
our school ills.

OBION COUNTY. 
Enelosed you will find the annual report of. the County Su- 
perintendent of this county to the State Superintendent. This 
report has been delayed on account of the district clerks failing 
‘to send in their reports. The last one of these reports came into 
the office today. I sent you a report of our county institute some 
‘time ago. : 
You will notice a falling off in the scholastic population of 
this county. The cause of this shortage is the better and more 
accurate way of taking the census. 
You will also notice that we have an average of 14514 days 
school term, with an average of $45 per month salary for our 
teachers in the couuty proper. Taking the county and the city 
School there is an average of 149 4-5 days school term. Both 
of these show. gains over the report of 1907. 
In other respects our schools are progressing. The buildings 
are being better equipped with modern conveniences. The teach- 
ing force is not what it should be, but it is improving. The 
standard is being raised. The patrons are taking more interest 
in the schools in general. This fact is shown by their attendance 
at our. monthly teachers’ meetings. 
There is one feature in particular that is encouraging. You 
will notice.in the table of Enrollment .and Attendance that the 
boys outnumber the girls. This seems to me to be a good feature. 
In regard to some of our needs: we need fewer schools, better 
supervision, more system in the employment of teachers and in 
the general control of the schools. 
Country InstiTurs. 
The institute was beyond .the average in interest and work 
and quality of teachers in attendance.. The following resolutions 
were passed : 
_ Resolved, That this institute indorses the Cooperative Edu- 
cational Association, and pledges its support to the same. 
2. That it indorses the plan for a normal training school 
for West Tennessee. 
3. That it indorses the work and administration of State 
Superintendent R. L. Jones. :

  PERRY COUNTY. 
Our county institute, which was held June 15 to 20, was one 
of the best in the history of the county. We had an attendance 
of forty-eight teachers, most of whom were teachers of. expe- 
rience. The work was conducted by home talent. Our institute 
was quite a success, but it is a hard task to get all the teachers 
to come to the teachers’ meetings. 
A sentiment in favor of education is steadily growing in our 
county. The people are awakening slowly to the great need of 
a more enlightened citizenship. 
Our school terms are too short. Hope some arrangements 
’ may be made to lengthen the schools of all the small counties: 
Arbor Day is not used as ordered by the provision of law. 
Not noticed at all. ‘ 
Our school furniture is very deficient, and on account of 
means cannot at present be supplied.

PICKETT COUNTY. 
- Edueational thought in Pickett County has undergone a rev- 
olution in the last two years. New methods have been inaugu- 
rated, with the result that we are now on a much higher plane 
‘of work than ever before. One of the most marked influences 
for the betterment of our school system was the establishment 
last year of a Teachers’ Traveling Library to be used in the 
county. Before that time the teachers had depended upon what 
they got from the text books for preparation to teach, arid the 
result was that they carried nothing new to the students of their 
schools. After having used this library for two years with the 
teachers I find now upon my visits to the schools that the teach- 
ers are inspiring the children of the county with a love for 
good literature, and that some of them are endeavoring to es- 
tablish libraries for their individual schools. 
The -ereating of the County Board of “Education has had 
much to do in bettering our schools; however, there is a lack of 
cooperation on the part of the patron to make its work as effec- 
tive as we would like. But notwithstanding this handicap, by 
a judicious use of the funds last year the schools were run a 
little longer term, and the teachers were advanced in -salary” 
about $5 per month. This year the same salaries were paid, 
but the schools will run a little longer, as our fund is better than 
last year. : 
Teachers’ associations have been held in all -parts of the 
eounty and have been largely attended by the people of the dif- 
ferent places. 
A special campaign has been waged for better school houses, 
but so far no school houses have been built. We believe, how- 
. ever, that some new houses will be under construction by an- 
‘other year. 
The greatest drawback in our public school system is the 
dropping off of attendance about the middle of the term, and it 
seems that the only remedy for this is the enactment by the Leg- 
islature of a compulsory school law. 
Another cause for complaint is the fact that teachers, when 
they get best equipped for the work of teaching, either quit the 
profession for something better, or go to places where they can 
get better salaries for their work. It seems that this might be 
remedied by the State grading the schools and giving the teach-

The improvenient in qualifications and methods of the teach- 
ers is about in the proportion that their salaries have been in- 
ereased. The average daily attendance of pupils decreased be- 
cause the-added three months of the term comes in the winter 
time, when bad weather prevails and prevents attendance in 
country schools. Careless parents should be compelled to allow 
their children their rights of obtaining an education. 
Immigration of uneducated people to public works in the 
county, and emigration of farmers caused partly by destructive 
fumes and smoke from copper producing plants, tend to in- 
erease the ratio of illiteracy, but it is hoped that longer and 
better schools will overcome these changes and that the census 
of 1910 will show a decrease in illiteracy since 1900. 
The great need of the county in an educational line is the 
eounty high schools. Over half of our teachers each year are 
brought into the county from outside, and nearly half of those 
who live in the county had to leave the county to get part of 
their education. Half of the means spent outside of the county 
by native pupils and teachers and carried out by nonresident 
teachers each year would maintain at least three good high 
schools. The citizens of the county would have to pay only 
about one fourth of the money necessary to carry on high schools, 
because nonresidents pay about three-fourths of the taxes. Yet 
the citizens’ children would receive nearly all of the benefits of 
high schools. High schools would educate more teachers, dllow- 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
—340— 
ing more choices in their selection, and render it no longer nec-" 
essary for remote or small schools to have to accept applicants 
rejected by the larger schools. High schools should bé estab- 
lished and maintained in the county as a matter of economy, 
aside from their uplifting social and moral influence and edu- 
eative value. 
Great as has been the progréss in educational matters in Polk 
. County only a beginning has been made toward the educating 
of ali of the people of the county all of the time.’ For. these 
changes. and advancements achieved and yet to obtain I have 
labored long and the best I knew how, and I hope to be able to 
help my successor in office (to be chosen next January) in get- 
ting further advancements and improvements accomplished. 
With faith and trust in God and the future I will retire from” 
the office, but not from the fight for better school facilities to 
help in the future development of the county’s children.

PUTNAM COUNTY. 
The public schools of Putnam County have, no doubt, made 
as marked progress during the past two years as has been made 
” in any other county in the State. : 
We have added nine weeks to the average length of the school 
terms. The average salary for teachers has been materially in- 
ereased. The County Court levied an additional 10 cents school 
tax, making our school tax 40 cents. The enrollment and av- 
erage attendance of pupils has increased considerably. A num- 
ber of new school buildings, some of them splendid structures, 
have been erected.- A considerable number of schools have been 
supplied with patent desks. Our schools are all graded, and 
pupils are confined to the grades to which they belong. The per-
-P-A-G-E-374
—342— 
sonnel and qualification of the teaching force of the county, 
upon the whole grows better each year. 
Never before in ‘the history of Putnam County was there so 
much interest manifested by the people in public education as 
at present. They desire better schools and are deeply interested 
in the education of their children. The teaching corps of the 
county is better qualified and doing better work than ever before. 
Our two great needs are more money and a compulsory school 
Jaw. We need sufficient funds to maintain nine months’ schools, 
taught by thoroughly competent teachers, in well equipped 
school buildings throughout the county; we need the attendance 
of ail children in school. 
. County InstrruTE. 
‘Our county institute for white teachers, which was held in 
the public school building in Cookeville from June 15 to 20, 
was probably the best in the history of the county. We had an 
enrollment of 156, 79 of whom had taught three years or more. 
Putnam County has, taken as a whole, the strongest and most 
enthusiastic corps of teachers this year that it has ever had. We 
hold semimonthly teachers’ institutes and educational rallies at 
different points throughout the county while the schools are in 
session. These meetings have been a wonderful stimulus to the 
educational interests of the county. 
I -have endeavored incessantly for six years to thoroughly 
grade the schools of the county, and the good results of grading 
the schools are now very manifest. Practically all of the teachers 
of the county adhere strictly to the grade schedule and course 
of study. 
: Every teacher in the county reads one or more educational 
journals, and all are studying the books adopted by the State 
Reading Circle Committee. 
The people of Putnam County, as a rule, are thoroughly in- . 
terested in the cause of public education, and each year marks 
an improvement in the educational conditions of the county. 
The colored teachers had an interesting and successful in- 
stitute, with fifteen teachers in attendance. Their institute was 
eondueted at the same time as the institute for white teachers, 
but in a different building. Their instructors did very credit- 
able work. Thirteen received certificates.
-P-A-G-E-375

For several years the people of this county have been enthu- 
siastically in favor of a compulsory attendance law, and it is 
hoped by the people generally that the next General Assembly 
will reflect the sentiment of the people of the State by enacting 
such a law, thereby enabling all children to secure the benefits 
_ of our schools. . 
Four new frame school houses have been erected in this 
county during the past year to take the place of old ones.

RHEA COUNTY. 
Tt is with a great deal of pleasure that I report a substantial 
de&ree of progress for the schools of Rhea County during the 
past two years. The wave of progress set in motion by the two 
State ‘institutes, and the thorough educational campaign con- 
-- ducted throughout the county, are still bearing fruits, and today 
. finds us with a number of our weaker schools consolidated; our 
terms two months longer; an increase in teachers’ salaries from 
$40 to $42 per month; the average daily attendance on the steady 
increase, and a more wholesome school spirit pervading the entire 
system. However, it is not all smooth sailing with us, for there are 
many obstacles which stand in the way of obtaining first class 
conditions in every school community. Among these we might

  mention the lack of interest on the part of: parenta. Frivole' 
excuses continue to serve as pretexts for keeping children at. 
home, and once regular attendance ceases, interest on the pari; 
of the pupil lags and school work. loses much of its attractive. 
ness,., Also we have been hampered by a lack of funds. :.Smalt 
counties, even though they levy a high rate of taxation; carinot: 
raise school funds sufficient to accomplish any vast improvement _ 
in thé way of modern buildings and at the same: time maintale 
the school terms a reasonable length. 
: For some time we have been striving to raise the standard of 
our teachers. To this end we have raised the standard of: ‘qiiali-: 
fication, and as a result some 50 to 60 per cent of the applicants 
for license to teach have been failing on the examination. Con- 
sequently there has been a scarcity of teachers of the. Kind | we. 
demanded. : 
For ‘the purpose of remedying these defects, so far as posi. 
ble, the County Board of Education and myself have been con- 
ducting a series of parents’ meetings, which has reached -prac- 
tically. every community in the county. In these meetings we - 
have: called the parents together and discussed with them the ~ 
f regular attendance and a deeper interest on their part 
in the welfare of their school. About twenty-five of such meet- . 
ings Have been held so far in the county and we believe much’ 
good ‘will résult from them. Already a better average daily at- 
tendance has been noted, and parents in a number of communi- 
ties’ are betively working, not only for a better attendance, but 
autifying of school rooms and grounds. 
     
    For some time we have been feeling our need for new school 
buildings in the county, but only this year have we actually un- 
dertaken the work on anything like an extensive scale. ‘The 
Comunity. ‘Court opened the way by establishing an additional high 
school. at Spring City to be consolidated with the publie school 
at that, place. When this was done the common school and high 
school, authorities combined in the erection of a modern building 
g City, which, when completed, will cost about $10,000. 
A similar building is being erected at Evensville, and besides - 
thése’ two buildings, which, when completed, will reflect great 
- eredit ° ipon the county, two other two-room school buildings 
@ been erected and a third one ordered begun. In order to 
é have been compelled to somewhat shorten our length

of term, but we hope to soon be able to run the schools full time 
again. 
The county board system inaugurated a year ago by a’ wise 
State law is working admirably. As a result of this law I have 
no hesitancy in saying that our school work is today better sys- 
temized and in better condition than I have ever seen it before 
and is improving continually. We are very strict about having 
the teachers send in their monthly reports, and we pay them off 
at each monthly meeting. It is a very rare incident that any 
of the teachers are absent from these meetings. Our program 
consists largely of State Reading Circle work and the general 
.diseussion of educational questions. One encouraging feature is 
_the interest manifested by the teachers in these meetings. 
I am glad, sir, to be able to make this report to you and to 
assure you that we are continually. working for the advancement 
of the educational interest. 
Country Instiruts. 
Prof. James A. Roberts was the State instructor. His work 
was of a high order, thorough and comprehensive. Miss Parm- 
lee was employed by the county to do primary work. She is 
especially adapted for this work, and the new ideas she gave the 
teachers were most valuable. Her plans are especially adapted 
_to the work in the rural schools, The other instructors were 
local teachers and all did splendid work. 
One new,. and which proved to be the most interesting fea- 
ture of the program, was a Twilight Story Telling League. This 
league was organized by Miss Parmlee for the purpose of teach- 
‘ing the teachers the art of story telling to the pupils. Practi- 
eally all the teachers joined the league and many took an active 
part in it. : 
Practically the whole of the two weeks, morning and after- 
noon of each day, was devoted to class room work, which con- 
sisted chiefly of review of the common school and State. Reading 
-Circle branches and methods of teaching. Daily recitations were 
conducted in the State Reading Cirele branches. This was one 
of the chief features of the work, as those teachers. who had re- 
ceived an average of 8714 on the first annual examination last 
year were only required to take the Reading Circle examination.

ROANE COUNTY. 
The improvement in the educational status in Roane County 
during the past two years can be illustrated by a brief statement 
of a few facts: 
In 1906 the length of term in some of the rural districts was 
two and one-half months, while the longest term of ‘any rural 
school was four months. In 1907 the length of term was four 
and one-half months, uniform throughout the county. This year 
the term will be five months. 
Only a few years ago teachers were ‘engaged in this county 
at salaries of from $25 to $30 per month. Last year the County 
Board of Education fixed the minimum salary for white teachers 
at $35 per month. Many of our teachers: have been and are now 
getting $40 to $50 per month, and in two instances $65 per 
~ month. This does nor refer to the prices paid in our high schools. 
Within the last two years eight new school houses have been 
erected at a cost of from $400 to $800 each; and one, begun in 
1906, was finished last year at a total cost of nearly $2,000. Be 
sides. this, many needed repairs have been made on old school 
buildings, and about $1,100 has been spent for new patent desks. 
The improvement in the standard of teachers during the 
past two years has more than kept pace with the improvement 
in school houses. For some years prior to 1906, owing to short- 
ness of funds, low salaries and general lack of interest in schools, 
very few teachers were making any efforts whatever to improve 
their fitness for the work. But during the winter of 1906-7 about 
thirty regular and about twenty-five prospective teachers at- 
tended high school, most of them taking the normal course. Ex- 
aminations have been made gradually more rigid and the good 
result is easily seen.
-P-A-G-E-383
  —-349-— 
Qur greatest need now, perhaps, is more money. Our terms . 
are too short,.but we cannot afford to lengthen them by cutting . 
down the teachers’ salaries. This would soon put the standard 
back: whe “ “it was, a few years ago. We need more good school   
  ‘kocarding ‘to the scholastic census the per cent of illiteracy 
in Roane County i is inexcusably saree, This condition, however, 
  as a “whole. “To remedy this we ‘undoubtedly, need a ‘compulsory 
schoo], law...

In my last’ annual report the figures show a decrease in av- 
evage attendance compared with my report of 1907, but this is 
not a true condition, because the report of 1907 was made from — 
incorrect statistics, while that of 1908 was a true condition, and 
I am glad to gay that it is an improved condition | over that of 
1907. 
I desire%o call your attention to the fact that the pupils are 
remaining in the schools longer than formerly, consequently 
more are completing the regular courses than in previous years. 
In years past it has been a custom to delegate to the teachers 
of the county the authority to examine and pass upon the quali- 
fications of pupils desiring certificates and diplomas, but under 
our present county government uniform examinations are pre-. 
pared by the County Superintendent, together with a committee 
of the best teachers of the county, and sent out to every teacher, 
who conducts the examination according to the rules and regu- 
lations made by the Superintendent. Examinations are pre- 
pared for every grade, but only those in the fifth and eighth 
grades are required to hand in to this committee for grading. 
This method of promoting pupils, we think, is a step in the 
right direction. 
Another item that is worthy of mention is the fact that the 
County Board of Education is transacting the school business 
of the county more economically than heretofore. Formerly.

fuel, supplies, ete., were purchased by the several local boards, 
consequently, the cost was more than when purchased in: large 
quantities. This year all supplies and furniture -were purchased 
direct from the wholesale dealers at a great saving to-the county. 
Our greatest needs, as I see them, are better and more con- 
_veniently arranged school ‘houses, and better roads. Our houses 
have been neglected for a number of years, consequently, many 
of them are needing painting and repairing. I believe that it 
will take $10,000 to properly equip, paint and repair our build- 
ings so as to make them convenient and creditable. And in this 
connection I would not forget to mention the fact that:we are 
building new houses that are much more creditable and conve- 
nient, although more costly, than the old models. : 
During the winter months our roads get in a bad condition, 
and as a result the attendance on the part of those who have 
some distance to go is irregular. 
~ While the changes and advancements areslow, yet I believe 
that existing conditions warrant my saying that we are making 
sure and substantial progress along educational lines. The 
County Board law is beginning to be understood and appreciated 
“by the people and a healthier sentiment is growing. © - 
For these changes and advancements, achieved and yet to ob- 
tain, I have labored long and the best I knew how, and hope 
to be able to help in bringing about more favorable conditions 
for educational facilities in this county. 
County Institute. 
My delay in getting this report filed was caused by the fact 
‘that my institute for colored teachers commenced immediately 
on the close of my white institute, consequently, I have been un- 
able to get this report out until now. And with reference to the 
institutes I desire to say that I am very highly pleased with the 
work and interest in both. For the first time in the history of 
Robertson County every teacher in the county was in attendance, 
and many who did not expect to teach. I, too, have noticed that 
my teachers as a rule are grading much better than before. 
Miss Josephine Tardiff did some fine work, and a work we 
all appreciated. I think her methods will be put into practice 
by many of my best teachers. I thank you very much for send- 
ing ‘her to us.

RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
The prospects for good schools seem to be brighter than ever 
before. While it has taken some time for the people to under- 
stand the workings. of the.county board system, I, believe’ that in 
the end.it. will. prove.a great, benefit to our county. Under this 
plan of operating the, schools the board has been enabled tu give 
more attention.to the question of buildings and equipment. Dur- 
ing the past.year a splendid school building has been erected at 
' Christiana,.Tenn., and a.man of scholarship and experience has 
been employed as principal, and a first class secondary school 
established. Another school of special importance to the county 
‘has been the change from the private school at Smyrna, formerly 
known as the Smyrna Fitting School, to a secondary publie 
school. . The County. Board .of Education h.as. purchased ‘the 
building formerly used. by the Smyrna. Fitting School,:and at 
the present time the children of that community are enabled to 
attend as good a school-as has been maintained heretofore without 
any cost for tuition. 
-It is the purpose of the County Board ‘and others ‘who are 
interested -in educational: movements in the county to establish 
at an early date a system of county high schools. While no defi- 
nite plan: has-been decided upon, it seems to be the opinion that 
a central’ high’ school will be established at Murfreesboro and 
four’ rurat schools in-the county, one in each division. At the 
present ‘time -high grade schools are being run-at Eagleville, 
Smyrna, ‘Lascassas, Fosterville and Walter Hill. I have visited 
every school in-the county this year and I find much interest

manifested i in the school and a growing sentiment towards better <- 
- puildings, grounds and equipment, in fact the buildings are in ~ 
  better repair and better equipped than ever before in the | ‘Bistorys os 
of the’ county. 
= We were favored with one of the State institutes for teachers “ 
for'Middle Tennessee last summer, which was held in the build- 
itig known as Tennessee College for Women. The faculty sent 
tous gave entire satisfaction to the teachers, and a great deal of 
interest and enthusiasm prevailed throughout the éntire session! 
The teachers have organized a county teachers’ institute, which 
meets. every month, and considering the salaries paid, they are 
doing excellent work in the way of preparing themselves for 
better service. 
With reference to the county board law: It is my experience — 
that those elected to the position of the Advisory Board consider ~ 
  that they have little authority and take little or no interest in | 
the duties of their office. In addition to this the main objection 
Lfind to this feature of the law is the fact that the district. boards 
seem to vie with each other in obtaining county funds to be -ex- 
pended for local purposes. In ry judgment. the next Legisla- 
ture etight.to: amend the law so that this feature of the system 
: would: be eliminated, and if necessary the number composing the 
County Board might be increased for the larger counties so that 
each portion of the county, could be represented. \ However, in 
this-county the County Board is sufficiently large for efficient 
Work.’ - On the whole we have a splendid board in the county, 
and each member has done more than twice the work for which 
they have.been paid by the provisions of the law, and I believe 
the law should be further amended so that the larger counties 
would, be ‘permitted to pay for more than- thirty days’ work, es- ~ 
pecially. if the District Advisory Board is done away with. The 
pay in.the various counties of the State might be on the basis of, 
the scholastic population or the size of the county. 
or think the sentiment among the people of the ‘county is 
strongly in favor of the establishment of high schools for the 
county,‘and for.an appropriation by the State of the funds: $0: 
encourage the establishment of county high schools. vote 
The teachers of the county and the leaders in educational 
moveme -favor'the establishment of three normal schools for 
“training of teachers. While the enactment. of ‘the -

County Board law has resulted in increasing the duties of the 
County Superintendent it has also been the means of increasing 
his salary by the County Courts, and money expended for the 
purpose of superintending and inspecting and systematizing 
rural schools means more to the country schools than the same 
amount expended in any other way; and I believe that if a sys- 
tem could be established connecting the smallest rural school 
with the State Department of Education in the same way that the 
ward schools are brought in touch with the City Superintendent, 
it would in a large measure solve the rural school problem. 
J. DatLas JACOBS, 
County Superintendent. 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
While considerable effort has been made to develop the school 
conditions in this county the progress has been slow, but steady. 
We have in the last two years increased the tax aggregate more 
than $100,000, not including the increase in the valuation of the 
railroads and telephone lines which have been erected. We have 
established two additional high schools, making three good schools 
as the head of the public school system of the county, and each of — 
these schools is doing a work that has long been felt the need of, 
and I believe that through these schools in a few years the county 
will have a supply of competent teachers, and that they will aid 
materially in making it possible to get all the public schools on 
a graded system. 
Our County Court is more approachable on all sehool meas- 
ures than ever before in the history of the county, and more in- 
terest and enthusiasm is manifested by the parents. The com- 
pulsory attendance law, which has been in effect, has proven a 
great help and has increased the daily attendance in the schools 
more than 25 per cent. This law has effected the rural districts 
more than the concentrated ones, and when we stop to think of 
the vast majority of children in the rural districts then we re- 
alize that whatever touches the rural districts touches the vital 
spot in education of the State. 
The outlook for the schools of this county is more~promising 
by far than it has ever been. Not only will the per capita be
-P-A-G-E-393
  —357— 
larger next year than ever before, but the teaching force prom- 
ises' better. The school conditions are very much better. Many 
old dilapidated buildings have been removed and given place for 
- More.modern and convenient structures, and many buildings 
have been supplied with the very best furniture. 
We aré surely and steadily getting on higher ground in edu- 
cational work in this county, but the progress is all too slow. 
The county board system has not worked well, but that is prob- 
ably due to an unwise selection of members and not to the sys- 
tem.’ I think that law should be amended so as to require ap- 
plicants to undergo a public examination. 
The compulsory attendance Jaw in effect in this county has 
worked well and served to materially increase the attendance, 
and especially is this true in the rural districts. I believe that 
the next Legislature should make the compulsory school law to 
apply to every county in the State. So far as I know no State 
or county has been able to eradicate illiteracy, or even to reduce 
it to a mimimum, without some kind of compulsion on the part 
of the parents or guardians to provide for the education of their 
children or wards.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
‘During the past two years the educational work of Sevier 
County has made much progress. Under the County Educa- 
tional Board a more perfect equality has been meted out to ~ 
teachers, patrons and pupils. The plan has been an advantage 
to the schools of our county. The average salary of teachers 
has increased nearly 25 per cent, and the terms have been equal- 
ized and lengthened. Some more substantial houses have been 
built and the number of schools have decreased. Salaries are 
graded more according to merit. 
‘There has been. great. improvement in the teaching ¢ foree. 
Each year more than 75 per cent of the teachers havd attended

higher schools after their terms of teaching closed; they have 
read many of the best books on teaching, and have made good. 
grades on the State Reading Course. Many modern methods are 
used by: our teachers, and it is my opinion that Sevier County 
gets a-greater value in proportion to the amount she spends in 
education than. any surrounding county. 
There is a growing sentiment for more liberal appropriations 
and better schools. Our monthly institutes and rallies in the 
various parts of the county have done much toward moulding 
public opinion in favor of better things educationally. Our an- 
nual school funds have increased $4,000 in the past two years, 
put they are still very meagre, as we have no railroads or publie 
improvements of much value to tax. We need high sehools and 
training schools for teachers. We need better houses and larger 
school grounds... We need.a compulsory school law four months 
in the year,.and.a much larger. amount of. school funds. A ma- 
jority ofthe people of my county wish to. supply the above needs 
for they realize that the. public school. children of Tennessee are

I give the teachers the opportunity to renew their county

find that they gain more than in an institute held at the close of 
school. . 
We held no annual institute. We have an association, which 
meets monthly, and the teachers take work in literature and 
management under Mrs. L. M. Murrelle and Miss Solly. One

STEWART COUNTY. 
I have the honor of submitting the following on the progress 
of. the schools of Stewart County for the. past two years:. 
Our schools have made fair advancements. As evidence of 
the progress our schools are making will say that the average © 
daily attendance for the county for the past year has incréased 
300 over the preceding year. This indicates that about 500 more 
students were in school than attended the previous year, a very 
wholesome increase. .Our school term for the past two years 
has increased from five to six months. New houses have been 
built, and patent seats put in many of the schools, thus the value 
of the school property has materially increased. The patrons 
are interested as never before. There is a growing sentiment in 
favor of the county high school. 
The county board system has given general satisfaction, ex- 
cept among some disgruntled advisors, who fail to do very much 
- towards. the advancement of the schools. .
-P-A-G-E-400
—364— 
‘We now have five secondary schools all of which have very 
large attendance. We greatly need the county high school to 
prepare our primary teachers and to fit young men and young 
women for college. 
We also need some form of compulsory education. There are 
many people in the rural districts who never send their children 
' to school, and still others who send-but little. 
On a whole our schools are doing nicely. Parents are coop- 
erating with the teachers and school officers. This contributes. 
very greatly to the success of our schools. ' 
In eonclusion will say that our star of hope is rising and 
brightening. We confidently expect the next Legislature to do. 
much for the schools of the State. 
County InstTirute. ~ 
I herewith submit my report of our county institute, which 
was held at Cumberland City from June 1, to June 12: 
The institute was a success from the beginning. The teachers. 
were enthusiastic and each vied with the other in making the 
work interesting. The instructors were well equipped for their 
respective work and no time was lost. 
This institute has revolutionized the educational interest of 
the county, and teachers are entering their schools hopeful of 
doing the best year’s work they have ever done. 
The great success of the institute is attributable to a very 
great extent to the tact and ability with which Prof. B. L. Gore 
“managed the work assigned him. We are very grateful for his. 
services, ,

SULLIVAN COUNTY. - 
-I am sending you herewith my statistical report for scholastic 
year ending.June. 30, 1908: .. ee wie 
This: is my sixteenth annual report. Casting. a retiospective 
glance, and -comparing conditions im this county. as they now 
exist with what they. were at-the beginning of my. administra~ 
tion, I find that we have moved up considerably along. many 
important-lines. 
Under: our present school system all our forces ar€é working: 
in perfect harmony for the success of the schools, uniformly, 
systematically and satisfactorily, far more so than possible under 
the oid director system. 
I will say for our Educational Board: There is not a better 
board in the State. The motto is, ‘‘Get the Best.’’ Salaries are 
fixed on the basis of merit. School houses are being put in shape 
for successful work, and teachers are required to move and cause

SUMNER COUNTY. 
The schools in Sumner County for the last two years have 
~ been doing good work. We need longer terms, but our greatest 
“need is trained teachers. We have a strong demand in our 
county for an increase in the county tax. We had a five months’ 
term last year, and by making combinations, have managed to 
have this year, with the same rate of taxation, a six months’ term 
all over the county. 
I can say with a clear conscience that we have a good County 
Court, and one of the best Boards of Education in the State. 
To look at the work as I see it now I can predict within the next 
two years great improvement in the schools of Sumner. Every- 
body seems to be doing evertyhing in his power to bring about - 
the changes that we need. Under the county board system I am 
confident that I can get the kind of work that the pupils ought 
to have. W. F. Avsricut, 
County Superintendent. 
TIPTON COUNTY. ‘ 
Our School Board consists, proper, of fifteen members, one 
member from each civil district, and the County Judge and the 
County Superintendent ex officio members. 
The County Judge ruled that under this law the district was 
still the unit of disbursement and not the county. Thus handi- 
capped the schools failed to secure all the benefits contemplated 
by this law, yet there has been a great advance: (1) In secur- 
ing more full and accurate reports; (2), a more definite and 
correct statement of the expenditures and general financial con- 
dition of the several districts, and (3), an increase in enroll- 
ment in per cent of attendance, in length of term, more efficient 
work and better salaries for high grade teachers. 
While results have not been altogether satisfactory, we have 
much for which to congratulate the children and patrons of the 
public schools of this county.’ 
As to our present needs: We want (1) more nioney; (2), 
a higher grade of teachers, and (3), a greater appreciation on 
the part of the parents. for the present excellent opportunities 
furnished for the education of their children.

UNICOL COUNTY. > 
Ag to the educational interest in Unicoi County it is not as 
intense as I desire, but I think will favorably compare with any, 
and I believe is in advance of many of the counties of the State. 
That.our schools are doing better work is evidenced by the fact 
that more than two hundred children were able to read and 
write at the close of the scholastic year ending June 30, 1908. 
than at the close of the year immediately preceding, reducing 
the per cent of illiteracy from 32 per cent to 23 per cent. 
The enrollment and attendance for the year embraced in this 
report show even better results. There were less than 60 per 
cent of the scholastic population enrolled during the year ending 
June 30, 1907, and there were a fraction over 86 per cent of the 
entire scholastic population enrolled during the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1905. Of this marvelous increase we feel justly 
proud and hope to make still further progress during the present 
year. 
The greatest need is better school houses, and have them 
better furnished and equipped. After a most careful study of 
the situation I am tully convinced that our greatest and most 
pressing need is school houses of modern structure, with neat 
and attractive grounds, and good furniture. . 
R. W. H. Gupert, 
County Superintendent. 
UNION COUNTY. 
In looking over the schools of Union County I am glad that 
I can ‘say that there have been many improvements made in the 
last two years. There has been a general awaking along all the 
lines of education. The people in general are taking a part in 
the work. 
It has been said that ‘‘one of the greatest problems in the 
school work is to enlist the farmer as an active force against ig- 
norance.’’ It gives me great pleasure to say that the farmers 
in this farming county are grasping the situation, and if the 
work continues it will not be long until we will have as long 
terms as any in the State.
-P-A-G-E-408
—370— 
The teachers are making a greater effort to prepare them- 
selves for the profession of teaching, and are doing better work 
than ever before. 
The attendance on all the schools shows a , gradual j increase. | 
Salaries of teachers have increased at least $5 on the month, 
and in some instances more. 
At the July term of the County Court, 1907, a tax of 40 
eents on the $100 was levied for school purposes. In. January, 
1908, the court levied an additional 10 cents, which gives us 
50 cents. 
Under the district director system many school buildings had 
decayed and but few buildings had been erected. When the 
County Board of Education took up the duties of school work 
they found some buildings in a dilapidated condition and were 
compelled to build new houses. They have also repaired many 
at considerable cost. In the two years past five new buildings 
have been erected, and all have been seated with patent desks. 
The Teachers’ Association has had printed and distributed 
among the teachers a graded system, which is of great value to 
‘the inexperienced teacher, and also gives uniformity of work in 
all the schools. 
Last year we had a school term of three months, this year 
we will have four aud one-half months. 
Although the improvements have been rapid, we find that our 
_ needs are yet many. Being a poor county, we find that our 
school fund is not what it ought to be, and are hoping for more 
help from the next Legislature. One among our greatest needs 
is a county high school. Our efforts have failed in the past, 
but I am sure if we faint not our work will be crowned with 
success at no late date. 
Again, we need a more binding compulsory school law. Our 
present law has served its day, and now we need one that will 
not only scare the ignorant, but will really compel them to edu- 
eate their children. 
In conclusion, I will say that we have been: rallying since 
the first of August and will continue until the end of the school 
year.

County Institue, 
The Union County Teachers’ Institute was held at Maynard- 
ville, and all the teachers agree that it was one of the most suc- 
cessful ever held in this county. 
The work done by Miss Sallie Dyer will be long remembered, 
and will, be a great help to the teachers in the years to come. 
‘We.hbad Prof. D. B. Simpson, our veteran instructor, with us, 
and under his methods of teaching we are greatly benefited. 
Our teachers now have several books in their library and we 
hope to do a great work in our teachers’ meetings this year. 
The institute passed resolutions thanking Supt. R: L. Jones 
for sending Miss Sallie Dyer to our county as instructor; also 
thanking Supt. D. B.. Simpson for his untiring work.

WARREN COUNTY. 
"y am herewith transmitting to your department both the re- 
port of my annual institute and the report of the Warren County 
schools for the year 1907-8. 
Some explanation may be necessary in regard to the insti- 
tute. You will find a total of sixty-four applicants examined 
and seventy-nine certificates issued. Of these seventy-nine cer- 
tificates, thirty-six were duplicates, five of which were issued 
to holders of State Honor Roll certificates and the rest to those 
teachers who had made excellent grades in last year’s examina- 
tion. This leaves a total of forty-three certificates issued to ap- 
plicants who were examined, and a total of twenty-four failures.
-P-A-G-E-412
—374— 
Now, I believe.you will agree with me as to the expedience 
of issuing the -duplicate certificates. I had graded the papers 
of those. applicants myself last year and, consequently, had ac- 
quired an accurate knowledge of their ability. Furthermore, 
I have never yet found anything to encourage good work like an 
appreciation for good work done. Consequently, I have followed 
this plan and I have obtained, I believe, a corps of as well trained 
teachers as can be found in any part of the State. While we 
have a strong and officient teaching corps, however, our needs in 
other respects are very great. 
. In the first place we are laboring under the old director sys- 
tem of 1873. I recommend that the next Legislature overrule 
our Representative, if le still be for this system, and place us 
under the law providing for a County Board of Education. 
_ In the second piace, in spite of the work of progressive 
teachers, I find a tendency among patrons to keep their children 
out of school for their labor. Some parents seem to forget that 
they have no right to.dwarf a child’s mind for their own selfish 
interests. For this reason I put a compulsory school law among 
our needs. 
In the third place more money, of course, is needed to run 
our schools effectively. Our county, however, has met all the 
requirements for a share of the $50,000 appropriation for weak 
schools, and is, in regard to funds, the equal of most other coun- - 
ties in the State. 
There are other needs as great as the ones enumerated. A 
majority of these, however, will be met, to some. extent at-least, 
by the general educational bill. I consequently give that measure 
my -heartiest. endorsement. : 
The above is, for the most part, an exact statement of the 
condition and demands of our county schools. While I have 
stated the facts in a rather unfavorable light I believe our schools 
will compare favorably with those of any other county. in the 
State. : :

WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
Washington County has I think made considerable progress 
along educational lines for the last two years. Our school term 
has increased in length; our tax levy for school purposes has 
been ineredsed; teachers’ salaries have been increased, and I 
think the teaching force of Washington County is improving. 
We have six county high schools, four in the country and 
two in the cities. Our County Court is now levying 13 cents on 
the $100 for county high schools. They have never refused to 
“raise money for public schools, and are now levying the Hmit on 
polls. * 
I think that placing our schools under the supervision of a 
County Board is a great improvement on the old system. We 
certainly have gotten rid, to a large extent, of many of the de- 
fects in the old system. 
We have had erected in our county ‘auring the past two years 
two of the best public school buildings in East Tennessee—the 
West Side school building, of Johnson City, and the Sulphur
-P-A-G-E-415
377 — 
Springs High School. The first was erected by the town of 
Johnson City, while the latter was erected by popular subserip- 
tion in the community where it was built. No photograph of 
either of these is available at present, but I shall try to get them 
for you next year. 
At the present writing our rural schools are, I believe, in 
better condition than at the same.time last year. 
Our present needs are: More money, better teachers and bet- . 
ter buildings, supplemented by the education of the parents 
along educational lines so that they will more heartily cooperate 
with the school authorities. 
County InstiTuTEs. 
A number of old teachers were licensed without examination

as being one of the best ever held in Jonesboro.

S. A. Esrzs, 
County Superintendent, 
WAYNE COUNTY. - 
In answer r to your inquiry about the advancement of the 
schools of. Wayne County for the last two years: 
1. The first real benefit to the schools was the adoption of 
the text-book law—a uniform use of books—which aided teachers 
~ in controlling and instructing a school. 
2.. The County Court raised the school tax and the State 
gave the county a much larger sum of money annually. 
3. The above named act of the County Court and help of 
the State enabled.us to build twelve new houses in one year and 
repair over. twenty-five, and this, with the consolidation of twelve 
schools into seven, caused a. better attendance and interest in
-P-A-G-E-417
—379— 
school work. Schools that are consolidated and have a good 
number of students have a larger per cent of attendance than 
small schools. The interest in school causes them to attend bet- 
ter, even though they walk from two to two and one-half miles. . 
4. The Board of Education builds houses, consolidates 
schools, and in many ways helps in advancing the school interest. 
The schools, under the management of the board, have prospered 
in every way for better than under the old director plan. 
5. The County Superintendent of Wayne County must put 
- in all His time overseeing the schools, as he is paid a salary that 
exempts him from teaching. 
6. . The progress in school work within the last year has been 
more. marked than that of any preyious year. 
County Instrrute. 
The institute this year was 2 good one. Attendance was good 
and the very best of instruction on most of the branches handled. 
We failed to get help from the State and had no conductor. 
I assigned. each instructor his subject and time and so all knew 
what to do.

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
The schools of Weakley County have made some progress un- 
der the county board system. We have a graded course of study, 
and the schools are being better graded, hence the results are 
better and more satisfactory than any preceding year. 
We have a very good Reading Circle, divided into primary 
and secondary classes, with competent instructors for each class, 
The County Board of Education is doing excellent work, not 
only in managing the schools, but the money is being judiciously 
used under its direction. 
‘We have not been able to start all the schools at the same 
time yet. The salaries have been increased some, andthe board 
is very anxious to increase them more if the funds would justify
-P-A-G-E-419
it. Many patrons have asked the members of the board to give 
them better teachers and shorten the term if necessary. We 
need some stronger and more efficient teachers, who will be lead- 
ers in the community in which they teach. 
We need at least one strong county high school to help the 
excellent private schools of the county to prepare and better 
qualify the young teachers. We are planning a campaign for 
a county high schooi, but we hardly think it advisablé to bring 
it before the County Court until the April term.

WHITE COUNTY. 
The annual summer institute of this county was quite a sue- 
eess. The enrollment was the largest in the history of the county. 
Allthose enrolled paid $1 each, thus giving v us a fund for the 
expenses... ....... 
_  We-had:as instructors s Prof, William H. Turney, of Water- 
town, and Miss Keeble Trimble, of Nashville. They did a high 
class of work, and we are very thankful to you for the selection 
of such excellent instructors. They were ably assisted by Profs. 
G. C. Sipple-and-L. D. Rutledge of this county. 
‘All teachers were required to be present three days or they 
were not permitted to take the examination. But with a few 
exceptions all teachers were present the entire time. 
An interesting feature of the institute, besides that of the 
regular. class work,. was the excellent lectures given by- promi- 
nent visitors, the influence of which will doubtless reach every 
community in.the county. Among the lecturers were Supt. 8. G. 
Gilbreath, of Chattanooga; Prof. W. R. Webb, of Bell Buckle; 
Prof. R. A. Clark, of Winchester; Dr. BR. E. Lee Smith, of Doyle, 
and Dr..E. ©. Mason, of Quebee.

A program was adopted for the regular monthly meetings 
of teachers. These meetings have been well. attended the past 
year.. . 
The . County: Court of this county at its April term made 
provision for the establishment and maintenance of a county 
high schoel, which has been located at Sparta. Those who have 
a great interest.in the cause of education in the county feel that 
this school means a great deal to the county. — 
The prospect. for good schools seems to be brighter in this

The educational progress made in Williamson County during 
the last two years, while being far from ideal, is very gratifying. 
We have consolidated some schools; improved many of the build- 
ings; raised the standard of efficiency among our teachers, and 
have an eight months’ graded school term. 
Our monthly teachers’ meetings are better attended than 
ever before, and we have an excellent Reading Circle, 
What we need is more money that we may pay our teachers © 
better salaries and thus hold our experienced teachers and not 
have fo engage so many young and inexperienced ones each year. 
We neéd better school houses, more libraries, charts, maps and 
other equipment.

number. of my teachers attended the Murfreesboro State Insti- 
tute, and some are attending Peabody and the Summer School

interest was manifested by our teachers. 
Our monthly teachers’ meetings are well attended, and the 
Reading Circle books are studied and discussed with much in- 
terest. 
We have an eight months’ school term, but our salaries are 
poor, arid we need money to equip our buildings properly. 
We commend most heartily your very earnest and persistent 
labors in the interest of the public schools of our State.

The instruction in our schools for the past two years has been 
in a marked degree improved. Our teachers are doing excellent 
for the salary paid. With the attendance the advancement has 
been most gratifying. 
We need a law compelling people to send to school; we need 
the County Board, and we need a higher tax rate for school 
purposes,

’ large number of such institutions which are in active progress in 
the State; on the full and comprehensive reports of State educa- 
tional conditions; in a word, on each item of an administration 
that is an honor to the State Superintendent and a benefit to the 
State. . 
“Second—That the legislative enactment of 1907, providing 
boards of education for the management of the public school 
affairs in the different counties of the State, has proven an in- 
novation that has brought good of inestimable value to the 
schools of the State, and that this body lend its unqualified en- 
dorsement to the continuation of this law on the statute books of 
the State, and does here recommend to the Legislature of 1909 
amendment as follows: That it be extended to every county in 
the State. . 
Third—That we indorse the movement for county high 
schools, and pledge our best efiorts to extend the system through-

one or more public high schools for the free instruction of its 
boys.and girls in the best types of secondary education. 
~““Fourth—That the Association endorses the general educa- 
tiofal bill, of which the following is a brief summary: Provid-

nance of the University of Tennessee, and for the support of such 
agricultural and horticultural experiment stations, model farms. 
and cooperative experiment work as the Legislature may by 
enactment require of this University, 
Fifth—That it shall be the duty of the President of this Asso- 
ciation to appoint a committee of three members of this Associa- 
tion to cooperate with similar committees appointed by other

next General Assembly of the State, and to cooperate in formu-. 
lating and presenting such other bills as the welfare of the-

To the Officers and Members of the Tennessee Public School Officers’ 
Association : 
We, your Memorial Committee, respectfully submit for your 
consideration the following report on the death of the only one 
of our membership who has passed away since the annual meet- 
ing of 1907. 
"William H. Cook was born in Fulton County, Ky., in 1867. 
He began teaching in his native county, came thence to Obion 
County, Tenn., and continued in educational work to the end of 
his life. . 
In 1894 he became Principal of the Rives High School, and 
held this position until January, 1907, when he was-elected 
County Superintendent of Obion County. In 1898 he became a 
member of the Tennessee Public School Officers’ Association, and 
the following year began his career of nine.years as one of the 
instructors.in the State institutes. 
He died December 26, 1907, at Cordova, Okla., whither he had 
gone in hope of regaining the health he had lost by too close ap- 
_ plication to schoo] duties. Forgetful of himself he had served 
others too well—had literally givez his life to his high calling. 
As a teacher, he was one of high ideals, of earnest purpose, 
and of patient industry—one who was willing to work and who 
knew how to work. 
As an institute instructor, he was kindly, helpful, inspiring. 
Contact with him made teachers better. 
As @ man, he was clean in life, faithful to duty, constant in 
friendship, uniform in practicing that grandest of all arts—the
-P-A-G-E-438

art of right living ev every day. Peace be to his ashes, and. honor 
to the memory of a noble gentleman.

Address of Hon. William Jenning Bryan, of Nebraska. 
Lapies AND GENTLEMEN—I am somewhat embarrassed by the 
fact that I can’t give you an experience that is as harmonious 
with yourselves as Judge Harmon. I never was a school teacher, 
‘but I inherited all the virtues of school teaching from my father 
who was. My father taught me by precept and by example the 
value of education. He worked his way through school and be- 
tame a teacher, and he was teaching school when he became ac- 
quainted with my mother, she being a scholar in one of his 
schools; he was an enthusiast on the subject of education. From 
my earliest recollection I understood that I was to go to college, 
and that I was to continue in college until I had finished col- 
lege, and when I went to college I had no idea as to what course —~ 
I was to take. I was to take the highest course, and when I fin- 
ished college I was to go to Oxford and there have a post gradu- 
_ ate course. My father was so anxious that I have the largest 
opportunities in an educational way that he could give me that 
he bought some cattle, hoping to make enough money for my .—

course, but at his death the cattle were sold to pay a security : 
debt ; he had gone security for a man and my Oxford year went: 
to pay the debt of another man, and I missed the opportunity of 
  studying abroad. I only refer to it to show that he wasanen- 
- thusiast on the subject of education. And be was once a super-- 
intendent of schools in his county; his political eareer began with 
the holding of the office; it was his first public office. His will — - 
provided that all the children should have the best education 
that the chance afforded, and when he died he was a trustee of a © 
college; so that I learned from my parents the importance of ed- 
ucation, and haven’t ceased to appreciate education. J have ac- 
cepted every invitation that I could to speak to teachers, and in 
traveling in foreign lands I visited the schools and colleges, and 
it is a pleasure to speak to you ‘this morning and to present to 
you two thoughts that come to me in connection with your edu- 
cational work, rather three thoughts: 
In the first place you may be interested to know that in mat- 
tets of education there is no nation that equals the United 
States. I think I am entirely within the truth when I eay that 
there is not another country in the world that is beyond us not 
only in the interest taken by the people, but in the progressive 
methods used among the people, and our people are not only 
furnishing the world ideals in matters of education, but our na- 
tion is doing more to spread education throughout the world 
than any other nation. I have found in Asia, American colleges 
scattered everywhere, and in these colleges boys and girls were 
being taught either by Americans or by money given by Ameri- 
eans for the employment of teachers. Our nation therefore is 
the world’s great educator not only in matters of mental disci- 
plineand mental development, but inall other things that accom- 
pany educational progress. This is the first thought I want to_ 
leave with you. . 
The second is in regard to education. I have known some 
who entertain the opinion that education was good only for the 
few who intended to enter professional life, and that unless one 
was going into the professions he did not need advanced educa- 
tion.. I do not share in the sentiment. A few years ago I read 
a speech made by a prominent business man of New.York to 
boys, and he told them that if they would, leave school at six- 
‘teen or seventeen they would get such a start in the bus-_ 
iness world that those who went to college until twenty or twen- 
ty-one would never overtake them. The thought that he pre- —
-P-A-G-E-440
—400— 
sented was that the whole purpose of life was to get ahead’ of 
somebody in the business world, and I was not surprised that 
within two years a United States Court was investigating trans- 
actions of this very man and they ascertained how he got ahead 
of some of his associates. The object of an education is not to 
get ahead of somebody in the business world; the object of an 
education is far higher than this, the purpose is far nobler than 
this, and we educate ourselves in vain if the only purpose of our 
schools is to enable those who obtain an education to get ahead 
of those who don’t. How could we justify laying a.tax uponall * 
the people to furnish high education to a few of the people, if 
those who receive the largest fruits of our school system are only 
“educated to take advantage of those who have furnished. them 
the schools through which they have received their mental dis- 
cipline. If I had my way about it, every boy and every girl 
would attend school, not only the public but the high school, not 
only the high school but the college. I draw no line through 
society and say that children on one side should be educated and 
the children on the other side shall be denied the advantages of 
mental discipline. We can only judge of the purposes of God 
by his works,and if we can judge of the purposes of God by man 
whom he placed here to carry out the divine decree, then we must 
believe that God intended that the mind be developed; for had 
he intended that a few should do the work for the rest, he would 
have given stronger brains to some and have made the backs of 
others stronger in order that they might bear the burdens the 
thinkers would put upon them. When God gave brains to all I 
think that he gave the best proof that he intended that the 
brains of all should be: developed. 
Thave one son; he is getting old | enough now, and I think he 
knows in what direction he is going to turn his knowledge, but 
before he knew what he was going to be, insisted upon his having | 
the advantage of an education ; and if I had known that he would 
dig ditches all his life, I would have insisted that he should com- 
mence digging with the best education that the world could give 
him. For, in the first place, I think he would dig better ditches ; 
second, he would have his mind for a companion, and his educa- 
tion would have linked him with all the stores of knowledge 
accumulated in the past, and he would be able to judge the fu- 
ture by what had been. The third reason why I would have . 
wanted him to have an education, he would have sense enough 
to demand reasonable wages and reasonable hours. I believe

therefore that all should be urged to take advantage of the op- 
portunity, and 1 have never wasted one hour’s sleep or lost it - 
worrying about what we would do for people to do the manual _ 
labor if all were educated. For my theory has been that instead 
of condemning some to ignorance, we want to put behind educa- 
tion a conception of life that would make one ashamed to be 
idle. And in traveling around the world I was impressed with 
this thought, in every land that I visited I found that every- 
where there was a stimulus in the direction of education, and 
everywhere I asked myself, “Is there with this educational de- 
velopment a spreading of that conception of life that will make 
people understand that intellectual development is not intended _ 
to lift them above the necessity for work, but to enable them to 
do a larger work?” And my coming here will not have been in 
vain if I can impress upon the mind of every superintendent and 
upon every teacher through these superintendents this thought, 
that back of all education there must be a purpose, and that that 
purpose must be to use the education not for selfish advance- 
ment but for the common weal; and that wé must cultivate in 
this country a public spirit that will make one proud to be a 
contributor to another's wealth and to another's profit. I hope 
the day will soon’ tome when shame will be heaped upon the | 
young man who is willing to spend his life in idleness, spending 
what somebody else has produced, rather than himself being a 
producer of wealth. And we must cultivate-a public spirit that 
will make each young man anxious to pay back to the world 
as much as he receives from the world. If by circumstance he 
receive a fortune from his parents, Jet him not think that that 
enables him to live a life of ease, but Jet him understand that it 
but increases his responsibility, and if the possession of means 
makes it unnecessary for him to devote as large a share of his 
time as the average man must devote to the securing of food and 
clothing, let him remember that it only leaves him a larger share 
to devote to those larger things in which others as well as him- 
self are interested. 
It-is perfectly proper that one should aspire to do the highest 
work of which he is capable, but it is also proper that he should 
be willing to do the commonplace work if necessary, if that be 
the labor that falls to his hands. We do not know in this life 
just what our work is to be. When I was a boy, my first ambi- 
tion was to be a Baptist preacher; I was going to follow in the 
footsteps. of my friend’s father; and then I was going to be a
-P-A-G-E-444
    —402— 
  farmer, and after that. I was going to be a lawyer, and to be a 
lawyer was the earliest ambition that guided me through all my 
boyhood days and my college days, and I studied Jaw, and while 
I cherished the ambition of entering politics I fully intended-to 
make my fortune in the practice of law, but circumstances: put 
me into politics much earlier than I expected, and I haven’t had 
-a chance since that time to get out, for I felt that there was a 
_ larger work made possible there. But we never know what-our 
great ‘work is to be, we only know what duty requires of us-at 
this time, and I think that there should be placed before.each 
child the thought that, however high the ambition may be, 
there is responsibility presented with the work that is to be done 
today. I received a letter a few years ago from a boy in a distant 
State. He said that he expected to be President some day, and 
that his brother expected to be on the Supreme Bench, and I 
answered his letter; I don’t always answer grown people’s letters, 
because they know that I am busy, but I always answer the 
children because they might not understand. I told him I 
hoped his ambitidn would be gratified, and that the ambition of 
his brother would be gratified, but that before either one of them 
reached a point where he could hold a high office, he would learn 
that it was more important that. he should do’something for the ~ 
people than that the people should do something for him. And 
so while it is perfectly proper to hold before each child the high 
possibility of American citizenship, perfectly proper to. stimu- 
late the ambition by telling the child that our country is the 
best in the world, because in this country there are more oppor- 
tunities for one to live and develop oneself to the highest; and 
yet while we hold before the child these possibilities of greatness 
and of honor, we want also to impress upon the child that one 
must not sit idly by and wait for opportunity to come, but that 
one must do each day the work that the hands find to do, and_ 
_ that no honorable work is beneath the dignity of any one. Let 
us cultivate that respect for toil, whether it be toil with the 
hands or toil with the mind, that one shall be unhappy when 
not employed at some useful advantageous occupation. An em- 
inent Swiss has written a book on happiness, and he says that 
health as well as happiness depends upon one having regular 
employment at something that not only requires the hands and 
the mind but also satisfies the conscience. And we shall makea 
mistake if -we simply educate the brain without developing the 
heart; so that back of the education there shall’be a moral pur- 
pose, for say what you will about the benefits of mental discipline,  
-P-A-G-E-445

“out of the heart are the issues of life, and the heart more than 
the head shapes human happiness and human destiny. Many 
have made a failure of life and been brought to despair who had 
splendid heads but whose hearts were wrong, but when once the 
heart is right it will direct even an ordinary mind to some-use- 
ful service. 
Friends, let us link together the development of the mind 
and the development of the heart and strive to advance that civ- 
ilization which is defined as ‘The harmonious development of 
human life, physically, mentally and morally.”

Proceedings of the State Teachers’ Association, Held 
at Monteagle, July 6, 7, 8; 1908. 
  
Monpay AFTERNOON, Juy 6, 1908. 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association was called to order 
for the forty-second annual meeting, in Warren Hall, ‘Mont- 
eagle, at 2:30 o’clock, President P. A. Lyon in the chair. 
“Monteagle and Her Part in. the Tennessee State Teachers’ 
Association” was the subject taken by Dr. Allen G. Hall, Dean 
of the Law Department of Vanderbilt University, and Superin- 
tendent of Platform Monteagle Assembly, in delivering his greet- 
ings to the Association. This address was one of the ablest 
delivered. We regret that we are unable to reproduce it in the 
proceedings. 
In the absence of Dr. Claxton, Prof. A. J. Brandon, of War- 
trace, responded in his usual happy manner to the greeting, ex- 
pressing the appreciation of the Association for the unusual in- 
terest and most favorable concessions made by the Assembly. 
The President called Dr, J. I. D. Hinds to the chair, when he 
made his annual address, his topic being, ‘“‘ The Unseen in Edu- 
cation.” Inasmuch as this address was not written it could not 
be referred to a committee for further recommendations. No 
further business being presented, the Association adjourned to 
meet at 8 o’clock to hear the lecture of Dr. Dawson on “Sir 
Walter Raleigh.” 
The Association attended the lecture at night, but did not 
transact any business and adjournment was taken until Tuesday 
morning at 9 o’clock. 
Tuespay Mornine, Jury 7, 1908. 
The Association was called to order by the President at 9 
o’clock, and prayer was offered by Dr. Hinds. 
In the absence of S. A. Mynders, who was announced to dis- 
cuss “The Best Means and Methods of Improving the Teachers. 
‘Already in the Service,” Prof. J. W. Brister, of Nashville, led the 
discussion of the subject, with the statement: “ We.can’t add to
-P-A-G-E-450
—408— 
the efficiency of our schools until we add to the equipment of our 
force.” He suggested many ways in which our teachers can be 
improved» among these, the establishment of rural high schools, 
with correspondence courses; the establishment of more normal 
schools where they will be convenient to the teachers of Tennes- 
see, and by bringing better teachers into the field. This question 
. was also discussed by L.S. Gillentine, of La Fayette, who believes 
that a fair compensation for his work will incite him to improve 
himself. He suggested also that instructors in institutes get 
down to the level of the rural teachers. P.L. Harned, of Clarks-" 
ville, said that increasing the public. school fund and reducing 
the number of rural schools in some sections is a necessity. We 
still have too many schools, more than we have qualified teachers, 
How are we to use these to any advantage until the State offers 
inducements for those in the work to work the harder and to 
keep in the work? Something must be done to pay the teachers 
and hold them in the profession. 
_ State Superintendent R. L. Jones spoke of the teachers who 
have been in the service a long time, and whose usefulness is 
impaired or lost. He urged that they keep up their student life; 
advocated the reading course, and said that so long as they con- 
tinue to grow, their usefulness is not at an end. 
One of the most interesting addresses of the morning was a 
paper by Dr. J. I. D. Hinds, of Peabody College, on “ Simplified 
Spelling.” Dr. Hinds has the distinction of being a member of 
the Advisory Council of Simplified Spelling, which fact lent 
much weight and interest to what he had to say.. Dr. Hinds 
has been a reformer along this line for twenty-five years, and his 
efforts have been severely criticised, he said. And he and others 
found that the time was ripe for this reform. The matter-has 
made progress, and he hoped what he had to say.on this occasion 
would be favorably received. He claimed that two years of 
school life are wasted in the old way of teaching spelling, when 
we have 540 symbols for 45 sounds. Some think to make a 
change is sacrilege. But, like society, orthography will never be 
entirely reformed; but we can at least make it less vicious, was 
the way Sainte Beuve expressed it. Many thoughtful educators 
think that the time has come for a competent commission to 
take the matter in hand and bring order out of this chaos. Such 
a commission is found in the Simplified Spelling Board. The 
speaker gave a brief history of this movement, and showed the 
class of men who are giving it their support. The movement
-P-A-G-E-451
—409— 
started in England, and has the very best backing. The board 
of forty-four has as its President, Thomas R. Lounsbury, of Yale. 
The. Advisory Council has nearly two hundred men selected 
from all the States of the Union and from Canada. With this 
body of men, he said that nothing radical will be done. Thou- 
sands of people have adopted at least some of the spellings and 
are using them in their correspondence. More than three hun- 
dred publications are using more or less of the revised spellings. 
While I have the floor, I will venture to offer the following 
resolutions : 
Resolved, First. That the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association 
declares itself in favor of a conservative reform of the spelling of 
the English language. 
Second. That this reform should be atleast for the present in 
the direction of simplification and be so carried out as not to 
materially mar the appearance of the printed page. 
.Third. That for the present, a phonetic system is imprac- 
ticable. 
Fourth. That the purposes sand methods of the Simplified 
Spelling Board are approved and that it is recommended that 
the teachers of the State of Tennessee cooperate with the said 
: Board. 
(a) By expressing their approval of the reformed spelling as 
occasion may offer ; 
(b) By using at their pleasure the simplified spelling in their 
correspondence; : 
(c) By allowing and encouraging their pupils to use the new 
forms in their exercises so far.as may be practicable. 
Fifth, That it is the sense of the Association that the daily 
and weeky newspapers, the magazines and the scientific journals 
should give the movement their support and help to popularize 
the spellings recommended by the Simplified Spelling Board and 
its Advisory Council. 
_ Referred to the Committee on Resolutions. 
The subject of “ Industrial Education” was introduced by 
Mr. Wilson, of Lincoln county, who favored agriculture in the 
public schools so far as it can be taught, but gave.as his opinion 
that other subjects are to be studied before the school garden-ig 
taken up and that the schools are trying to do too many things 
already.
-P-A-G-E-452
  —410— 
Supt. H.C. Weber, of Nashville, was called on and he made 
a, stirring speech, in which he took issue with some ‘of. the 
gentlemen who had spoken. He said he sometimes thinks 
he.is a better gardener than he isa teacher. He agreed: with 
much that Mr. Wilson had said, yet he thinks there has been 
more humbug than a little in the school room teaching nature 
study. It is pure nature faking, he said. He would ‘make: 
time for the gardening. He does not see why it is more imipor- 
_tant to read what some old Roman said hundreds of years ago 
than it is to read what God Almighty is saying to us.every day.. © 
You can ask questions of nature and you never get a lie for an 
answer. It is the only source to which you can go with a 
question and get an honest answer. It gives a child an interest. 
in all of God’s creation. He becomes less selfish. If he doesn’t 
hear what nature says it is because he doesn’t understand. Every 
rock, every breeze, every cloud has a tale to tell if you only’ know: 
the language. 
. The‘interest of the Association now centered upon the prom- 
inent feature of the day, the masterly address upon “ Education 
_ and Life,” by Dr, Lincoln Hulley, of Stetson University, Florida. 
This brilliant performance gave ample evidence of the lecturer's 
_wide knowledge of both education and life. The public-mind, 
he said, is seething with the question, ‘‘ What knowledge is it . 
worth while for our children to acquire—what should they 
know?” - We haven’t solved the problem, he said, as to what we 
ought to teach; but all education is vitalized, and the text books 
are being related to lite. Every child’s education begins at birth. 
There never was a better teacher than the mother if she is on to - 
her responsibility and up to her opportunity. 
The speaker endeavored to correct the foolish notion some 
people have that all education a child gets is that which begins 
in- the school room. To parents he said: “If you don’t-give. 
your children brains, don’t expect the teachers to. do this for 
you.” As our schools are organized it isn’t the school’s duty to. 
develop the child’s physical nature, but it stands today for the- 
development of the child’s intellectual nature. , Institutions of 
learning can’t make a man. Any man that is ever made atall 
is selfmade. : : 
The school is the place where the task is set; where he-learns. 
promptness, punctuality, regularity. Education is life. It be- 
gins when life beging and doesn’t end until lifeends. Education 
is worth while. Its real value is in its enlargement of life. 
The Association adjourned to meet at 2 o’clock in the cafe, 
ternoon.

AFTERNOON SEssION. 
At the afternoon session, Mr. Everett B. Tucker, late of Wal- . 
lace’s School, Nashville, was asked to discuss the subject, 
“Whither Are We Drifting,” which had been assigned in the 
programme to Mr. W. R. Webb, of Bellbuckle. He said: “We- 
have drifted into two tendencies caused chiefly by the intense | 
materialism of our life. The first tendency is that of parents to. _ 
shirk the moral, spiritual and industrial training of children 
and ‘burden teachers with increasing responsibility. The Sun- 
day school is an example. Originally established to fill a need, 
it is now used by many parents as a substitute for the training 
which they will not take the trouble to give. “So in the day 
school, the teacher is loaded with manual and industrial train- 
ing, with agriculture, etc. The second tendency is that of the 
boys to leave school. Girls in secondary and high schools out- 
number the boys two to one. The great problem of our time is 
to interest the boys in education, to fill them with inspiration 
and--aspiration for something else than mere material enrich- ' 
ment. This calls for stronger teachers, men in the secondary 
schools supported by adequate salaries, a deeper consecration and 
higher enthusiasm on the part of those already in the work.” 
“ Misquoted Quotations” wag the subject of a very carefully 
prepared lecture by Dr. R.'L. C. White, of Nashville. His lecture 
was short, but his list of misquoted quotations was long, and was 
made up from the King James version of the Bible, from Shake- 
speare, Milton, Pope, Addison, Burns and other well known, but 
evidently not ‘well studied authors. He criticised severely the 
calor Whites or ignorance of reporters and newspapers in general 
_ aenius, ang" his impatience with those who either wilfully or ~ 
Otliged - By misquote. 
Supt. A.C. Nute read a very interesting paper on “The 
Duty of the Teacher to the Profession,” which paper was‘ de- 
livered to the Secretary, but because he was unable to secure 
other papers for publication in these proceedings, it was thought 
best to print no paper. 
The Association adjourned to meet in the ‘Auditorium at! 
8 o'clock. . / 
. Evenine SEssion. 
-The evening programme in the auditorium was in charge of 
-Prof. Strahm, who arranged a splendid concert, complimentary 
to. the State Teachers’ Association. The large audience showed 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
—412— 
its appreciation of Prof. Strahm’s efforts and heartily attested 
‘their enjoyment of the beauties of the orchestral numbers, - 
which, under his direction, were brought out so perfectly. Miss 
Martha Scruggs, of Nashville,sang two numbers, Delibe’s “Maid 
- of Cadiz;” and Meyer Helmund’s “ Magic Song.” Mr. A. Pauli, 
‘of the orchestra, played a cello solo, “Serenade,” by Blocks. 
“In tife handling of his instrument he came nearer repfoducing 
-the human voice than it would seem possible todo. In responding 
to a demand for an encore, he gave the “ Traumerei.” | Prof. 
Strahm played a piano solo, “ Persian March,” by Gruenfeld. 
Responding to an encore, he gave one of his own composition, 
“ Crimson and Gold,” Valtze de Concert. 
The Association adjourned to meet in the auditorium at 9 
° clock, Wednesday morning. 
Wepwnespay Mornine, Juy 8, 1908. ‘ ied 
' The Association was called to order by the President at 9 
' o’clock, and the following persons were selected to fill. the va- 
cancies existing in the Executive Committee: L. 8. Gillentine, 
LaFayette; G. R. McGee, Jackson, and G. C. Simmons, Fay- 
etteville. 
The time having arrived for a special order, State Superintend- 
ent R. L. Jones spoke at some length upon the subject, “Course 
of Study for the Public Schools.” He emphasized the need of a 
changing course of study to meet the changing conditions of a 
progressive people. He discussed the proposed establishment of 
vocational and agricultural schools, opposing them, agsleaving 
out the culture element of education. He favored 1 sd Obthe 
introduction of manual and domestic training dep. ato 
schools already in existence. He said it was impossationsest a 
working standard of a course of study for the State; that every 
county had its own standard, but he favored the gradual substi- 
‘tution of a uniform standard. He declared that the poorer 
counties would never be educated without help from the richer. 
e received hearty applause when he stated his personal desire 
that the State abolish secondary schools altogether and. make lib- 
eral appropriations for the establishment of rural high schools, , 
losely correlated with the elementary schools. 
Prof. P. P. Claxton, of the University of Tennessee, was unable 
to be present Monday atthe time given him on the programme, 
but he delivered his address this morning. In his address -he 
described the great confusion. in the educational interests sup-    
       
-P-A-G-E-455
—413— 
ported by the State. He said that a member of the last Legisla- 
ture remarked upon the fight going on between them over ap- 
propriations. He declared that the State University should be 
closely correlated with the high schools and that provisions 
should be made for State Normal Schools; that there was no 
conflict between Peabody College and the State institutions, but 
that Peabody College did not train Tennessee teachers more than 
those of any other State; that Rutherford County and many 
others did not have a single teacher from Peabody College, and 
that eighty-five per cent of the teachers in the elementary schools 
of the State were not competent to pass an ordinary high school 
examination. He reviewed the provisions of the general educa- 
tion bill, which would be introduced in the next Legislature. : 
Dr. R. L. C. White addressed the Association on “ History of 
the Great Seal of Tennessee.” His facts have been. collated from 
old State papers and private manuscripts, many of them with a 
century’s dust upon them. It is impossible to ascertain to whom 
we owe the design of the seal, but the original was cut by the 
Atkinsons, of Knoxville, which was then the capital, or Jones- 
boro. For this service they received $100. The order of the 
~ Legislature was made in 1801, and prior to 1802 no seal, unless a 
private seal, was ever used on any State paper. 
The closing address of the meeting was made by Dr. Lincoln 
Hulley, of Stetson University, Florida, on ‘‘ Robert Burns.’ Dr. 
Hulley recited many of his poems and gave the circumstances un- 
der which they were written. He characterized Burns as a 
genius, and stated that he would make no attempt to excuse his 
vices. He stated that the shrine of Burns is visited by more 
people than that of Shakespeare, though the latter is more 
accessible. : 
Prot. A. J. Brandon, of Wartrace, made some important re- 
marks on increasing the attendance of the Association and the 
results of the present meeting, and offered resolutions thanking 
the Assembly for its kind treatment of the Association. Supt. 
P. L. Harned, of Clarksville, offered a resolution introducing 
the law providing for County Beards of Education and county- 
unit school government. It was unanimously adopted. On

Education Bill that will be presented at the next meeting’ of the

same. Soe . “A.C. Nurs,

REPORTS OF STATE INSTITUTES FOR THE YEAR 1907. 
McKENZIE STATE INSTITUTE. 
In addition to the statistical report herewith signed by the 
Conduetor and Secretary of the State Institute, held at MeKen- 
zie, June-July, 1907, as Conductor of said institute I desire to 
file this supplementa: report and to make some suggestions as to 
the law makers and school authorities of the State. 
The people of McKenzie cared for the institute and enter- 
tained its members as no other town I have ever been thrown in 
has done. The people of the town took genuine pride in the 
work, and it was the general verdict of all that in McKenzie the 
State Superintendent made a wise selection for the location of 
Tennessee’s largest State Institute. 
This was, in many respects, a remarkable institute. There 
were 525 teachers enrolled; 213 took the primary examination, 
and only 83 were given certificates; 91 took the secondary ex- 
amination, and only 51 were given Honor Roll certificates. The 
questions for examinations were prepared by the State Super- 
intendent and were eminently fair and practical. The small per 
cent of those who passed was due primarily to two causes. In 
the first place, the institute had too many boys and girls who are 
too young to teach or to know the responsibilities of the teacher. 
These young people bad been taught by young and inexperienced 
teachers, who were unable to pass the examinations themselves, 
and much less able to prepare others to pass them. In the sec- 
ond place, from the above and other causes, the members were 
exceedingly. deficient in scholarship. A much smaller per cent 
than usual had the necessary qualification to pass creditable ex- 
aminations... The deficiency was noticeable in all branches, but 
can be well. shown in the work in arithmetic and English. 
The work in grammar was about on a par with the spelling. 
The work in- composition and in the interpretation of literature 
showed absolutely: no training. The-same conditions existed in 
other branches. In view of conditions seen in this institute I
-P-A-G-E-556
—500— 
would recommend as Tennessee’s greatest needs for the improve- 
ment of her public schools: / 
First—One or more State Normal schools for training public . 
school teachers. 
Second—An age qualification for teachers that will keep 80 - 
many boys and girls from teaching in the State. 
Third—A law that will cause indifferent and careless parents 
and guardians to send children to school regularly for a certain 
number ‘of months each year. 
Fourth— More money and longer terms that the better qual- 
ified and experienced teachers may be retained as teachers and. 
not allowed to drift into other walks of life for better pay. - 
Fifth—-Earnest cooperation of County Boards, County: Su- - 
perintendents and the people to improve Tennessee’ 's public 
schools.

CLARESVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
The work of the institute was highly satisfactory to the Con- 
ductor as well as the County Superintendents in this section of 
the State. Each instructor did everything possible within the 
time 6 help each individual attending. 
Besides the regular hours for instruction each member of 
the faculty returned to Howell school to meet those teachers 
desiring further instruction on any subject taught during the 
institute, and from 3 to 5 o’elock each afternoon was given to 
this irregular work. This, however, was free to all teachers. 
It. gives me great pleasure to state further that I have never 
‘geen a more earnest, energetic, faithful body of teachers any- 
where than that enrolled in this institute. I believe the great 
‘ majority of them were working to prepare themselves for more 
efficient work rather than to make a, certificate, and in this they 
are.to be especially commended. 
I am pleased to state, too, that the town of Clarksville did 
everything possible to show a genuine appreciation of the in- 
stitute and the presence of the teachers during the month. Some 
of the best families opened their homes to the teachers and did 
" whatever could be done to make them comfortable. 
I trust that the results will be satisfactory to you. and that 
the work done may help t to ) improve conditions wherever our 
teachers go. ~

' GREENEVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
~The State Institute at Greeneville was opened under your di- 
rection’ June 10 and continued until July 5, its faculty being 
composed of C. 8. Douglass, ‘W. E. Miller, J. C. Fooshee and B. 
O. Duggan, = 
The locality ‘for the institute was certainly well chosen. A 
beautiful mountain city, its environments for health and scenery 
being unsurpassed, with a hospitable and cultured citizenship 
the peer of any in the State. 
Froni the very opening of the institute until its close ‘there 
_ Wasa strong and determined effort to make it a success. Upon 
the very threshold the good people of this little city metus with 
kindest greetings and made our opening day a splendid ovation.. 
The commodious auditorium was secured for our use, and the 
incidentals were cheerfully liquidated, not by the teachers, but 
by the people. In cur reception on the first morning the repre- | 
sentative citizens were out in full force, and Col. Brabson, on 
the part of the city, greeted us in most pleasant and assuring 
terms, as also the Hons. Henry R. Brown and J. W. Howard. 
The city orchestra did its part in making our opening so happy 
and pleasant. Nothing was left undone whereby an especial as- 
surance might be impressed that our presence was appreciated, 
and that every energy and every effort would be made toward 
securing a harmonious and profitable institute. : 
I feel that I cannot express myself too forcibly in commenda- 
tion of my most excellent assistants: Profs. Miller, Foshee and 
Duggan, all teachers of fine scholastic attainments, thorough in 
their work and fully alive to the demands and necessities of the 
profession. Supt. O. M. Dugger, I am free to say, was. one of 
the chief and indispensable factors in our great success. He is 
assuredly an ideal Superintendent, appropriate at all times, 
knowing just what to do, how to do and when to do. 
At the close of our social greeting we arranged our program 
and went to work in earnest. Two sessions were held each day. 
Our work was thoroughly demonstrated on the board, and the 
especial subjects as outlined by the State Superintendent, were 
given close and direct attention and the entire curriculum strictly

“The faculty and teachers were the , recipients of ‘every kind- : 
negs and attention from the good people of Greeneville,.and the. 
county press was very generous and liberal in giving publicity 
to the work of the institute. 
We feel profoundly grateful for the interest and active par- 
ticipation of the following ladies and gentlemen: . Dr. Jeré 
Moore, Hon. James Armitage, Col. J. M. Brabson, Hon: “A. B.. 
Wilson, Profs. Charles Mason,.E. M. Wright, Supt. Chase, and 
Mrs. Wiley and Mrs. DeBow. 
We very fortunately had the strong endorsement of the ‘clergy, ; 
and shall remember with pleasure the cheerful cooperation ex- 
tended to us by the Revs. Dishman, Eakin, Bowling, Clapp and : 
York. 
A very delightful incident of our institute was the visit of. 
our State Superintendent, who, as usual, was happy and foree- 
ful in his vindication of the educational cause, and we are sat-. 
its-golden fruits. isfied that his coming left its impress, aud in the end will yield. -

| Report or CommirTgE oN RESOLUTIONS. — 
The following report of the Committee on Resolutions, on 
behalf of the teachers in attendance at the State Institute held 
at Greeneville, Tenn., June 15 to July 10, 1908, is respectfully 
submitted : 
. We send greetings to the State Superintendent, R. L, Jones, 
and express our heartfelt appreciation of the benefits he has - 
conferred upon us by locating the State Institute at Greéneville 
again this year. We most earnestly urge the powers to continu 
him in his present position of usefulness. : 
To the ministers and citizens of Greeneville generally our 
thanks are due, and hereby tendered, for their hospitality and 
for the interest they have manifested in our work. Our interests. 
are reciprocal, and as they have sown in intelligent sympathy, 
so shall they reap a harvest of gratitude. : 
To Conductor C. 8. Douglass, for his untiring labor and. 
business-like dispatch of work of the institute; to Prof. W. E. 
Miller, for his untiring efforts to teach us our mother tongue 
‘fas she ought to be spoke;’’ to Prof. J. C. Foorshee, for his. 
cheering smile and good works; to Prof. C. P. Jester, for his: 
earnestness and ski!l in teaching us how to ‘‘figger,’’-and in 
showing us how “‘fearfully and wonderfully we are made;’’ for 
these and all other mental gymnastics, through which they have- 
put us, we each and all tender a sincere expression of our grati- 
tude and appreciation. They have been faithful servants, and 
we commend for them the reward laid up for the faithful. 
To Supt. O. M. Dugger we pledge unreservedly our coopera-- 
tion in whatever plans he may have to present for the better-. 
ment of our schools. 
Fully aware of our own limitations and shortcomings, we un- 
hesitatingly declare that the unqualified teacher is the bane of* 
our profession, the greatest obstacle to secure a decent living- 
wage for those of us who are qualified. We, therefore, regard-. 
less of how it may affect our personal fortunes, urge upon him. 
the duty he owes both to the profession and to the school chil-. 
dren of Greene County, in protecting teacher and children from _ 
incompetency, so far as lies within his power. We commend him. 
for the good work aiready done and hopefully look for its con— 
tinuance.
-P-A-G-E-563
—507—_ 
The worshipful County Court, by its liberal 
of $150, made it possible for us to enjoy the bene: 
State Institute this year. For this kindness we con 
Dugger to make suitable acknowledgment of ow 
and to ask for a continuance of this liberal policy 
To Misses McAnnis and Dougherty, who hav 
with music of instrument and of voice, and to-ot 
stitute Secretary, Miss Nellie Kiser, we echo the u 
timent of this institute in a final tribute to their kindness ma s 
eulture. 
- We desire to express our appreciation of the efforts of the 
Cooperative Educational Association of the State of Tennessee 
for the betterment of our publie school system, and pledge our-: 
selves to an active cooperation: with it in all that pertains to 
° giving greater vigor and directness to our public schools..

  LEXINGTON STATE INSTITUTE. ~~. >; 
I herewith submit my report of the State Institute held at 
" Lexington, Tenn. The institute opened Monday, June 10, and 
was in session for four weeks. I am sure you could not have 
placed an institute in a town where it would have been’ any © 
more heartily received than it was at Lexington. Everything: 
possible was done by the people of Lexington to make the in- 
stitute a success. Great interest was shown by all in attendance, 
and I am sure mtich good was accomplished. All the instruc- 
tors were faithful and efficient, and the work done by them was. 
of the very highest type of institute work.

  MADISONVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
The Madisonville State Institute was productive of good. 
The attendance was not large, but the enrollment, as reported, 
was of teachers only. Of the 107 enrolled, 82 were in average 
daily attendance, and 79 took the examinations. As this was the 
first State Institute ever conducted in Madisonville no Secondary 
Department was organized, but the 24 applicants who received 
certificates, together with six who had their Third Grade certifi- 
cates renewed, give promise of a good secondary class for next 
year. The interest shown by the teachers was all that could be 
desired. : 
The citizens of Madisonville contributed in many ways to 
the success of the institute. Many of them were in almost daily 
attendance. 
My colleagues did excellent work. The ‘‘institute veteran,”’ 
Supt. Burke, was at his best, and was popular with everybody. 
Principal Darrah won for himself a warm place in the hearts of 
teachers by his enthusiasm and energy. 
Helpful educational addresses were made by Col. T. E. H. 
MeCroskey, Hon. T. W. Peace, Hon. W. Morris Harrison, Chair- 
man of the County Board-of Education, Rev. Dr. J. L. Bachman 
.and others. 
The visit of the State Superintendent and his powerful plea 
for the public schools were inspiring. 
The County Superintendent, Hon. 8. J. Parks, was: untiring 
in his efforts for th: comfort of teachers and the success of the 
work. His cooperation was perfect. 
The County Court made the institute possible through a gen-

COVINGTON STATE INSTITUTE. 
I herewith submit the report of the third State Institute held 
at Covington in June, 1907: 
We had in every respect a most successful session. The per- 
sonnel of the student body was far above the average. The teach- 
ers manifested a live interest in the work. 
The State Institute has been a potent factor in the develop- 
‘ment of a professional spirit among the teachers and a source 
of inspiration to many young people to equip themselves for 
teaching. Only words of praise should be given to the hundreds 
of young people whe are taking the advantage of county and 
State Institutes to supplement their training and educational 
equipment by coming in contact with living teachers of wide 
experience, who are capable of instructing not alone in text- 
book knowledge, but in professional spirit based upon sound 
pedagogical principles. 
It is a matter of deep regret that we have so many who have 
assumed the role of teachers that have not had the benefit and 
inspiration which comes from attendance upon a normal train- 
ing school, where contact with live and experienced teachers is - 
possible. If we are to make that progress in the efficiency of 
our elementary education that is now demanded by this advanced 
age, better provisions must be made for a considerable increase 
in the number of professionally trained teachers for our rural 
schools. The rural teachers are as progressive as are the city” 
‘graded teachers, and if facilities for normal training are placed 
within their. reach they will not be slow to take advantage of 
them. With a trained teaching force in the rural schools many 
of the present difficulties now obtaining will be solved. 
The citizens of Covington spared no effort to make the ses- 
sion of the institute pleasant as well as profitable. We acknowl- 
edge our gratitude and appreciation of the action of the Tipton 
County Court in appropriating $400 for the support-of the in- 
stitute. 
The keen interest and valuable assistance of Supt. J. A. Cot- 
ten in making our work a success deserves special mention.

The visit and very able address of Supt. R. L. Jones served 
to encourage and to stimulate both the teachers and citizens. 
The annual graduating exercises were held in the First Meth- 
odist Church on Friday evening, at 8 o’clock, on July 5. Rev. 
W. H. Major of the Baptist Church delivered the address be- 
fore the class. 
The members of the faculty were faithful in the- discharge of 
their obligations to the institute. We are indebted to Supts. C- 
W. Anderson, of Brownsville, and C. L. Ridings, of Union City, 
for valuable assistance in the conduct of the institute. The work

CARTHAGE STATE INSTITUTE. 
As Conductor of the State Institute held at Carthage, Tenn., 
June 10 to July 3, 1907, I desire to submit the following report: 
The institute opened at the courthouse on time with a good 
attendance of teachers and other friends of education. All were 
cordially welcomed Ly Hon. H. B. McGinniss, who was followed 
by Mayor L. A. Ligon and Rev. J. L. Smotherman, after which 
' the institute was organized and proceeded to work. 
The teachers of Smith and adjoining counties are alive to 
their responsibilities, and were earnest and active at all times, 
especially is this true of those doing secondary work. Never 
had it been my pleasure to instruct so wide-awake and thought- 
‘ful a class of teachers. The results of the examinations speak 
for themselves. 
Those you associated with me in the work cooperated in all 
things for the good of the institute, and their work was highly 
appreciated by the teachers. Miss Arthur won the hearts of all 
by her primary work, which will result in much good to the 
schools of that section. 
Your forcible, pointed address was highly appreciated by 
all who heard, and our only regret was that it could not have 
been heard at a later date. Those who heard it will stand by 
you in your campaign for better teachers and better and longer. 
“schools. . 
‘Supt. J. BR. Curtis was ever at hand looking to the welfare 
and comfort of the teachers. 
J. L. Kemp made a model Secretary. 
Miss Mettie Robinson presided gracefully at the piano. 
W. E. Meyer, a local geologist of some note, favored the in- 
stitute with an excellent address upon the geological formations 
of the section, and opened his hospitable home, where he has 
one of the finest private collections of geological specimens and 
Indian relics in the country, to the teachers. 
All in all the institute was a pronounced success. The at- 
tached resolutions were adopted at the close of the- institute.
-P-A-G-E-575

“We feel-by our social relations, our exchange of ideas 
and the able instructions of the faculty, that our knowledge of 
‘school work has been broadened, and that we are better prepared 
for the important work and responsible duties that rest upon us 
as teachers; therefore we take pleasure in expressing our appre- 
ciation of the good that has been accomplished by resolving: 
First—That our sincere thanks are due State Supt. R. L. 
Jones for locating the institute at Carthage this year, and for 
the very able faculty sent us. , 
Second—That we shall remember with pleasure the cordial 
weleome delivered on the day of our assembly by the Hon. H. B. 
McGinness in behalf of the citizens of Carthage, and also the 
words of greeting by Mayor L. A. Ligon and Rev. J. L. Smoth- 
erman, 
Third—That we tender our thanks to the Town Board of 
Education for the use of their piano during the institute, and 
also the use of the college during the examination. 
Fourth—That our thanks are due Prof. J. R. Curtis, our ef- 
ficient County Superintendent, for his courtesy to the teachers 
and the visitors, and for his efforts to promote the education in- 
terests of Smith County. 
Fifth—That we offer our thanks to Miss Mettie Robinson 
for her service at the piano. . 
That we are especially indebted to State Supt. R. L. Jones 
for his most excellent address to the teachers and visitors of the 
institute. 
That we cannot forget to mention the most excellent lecture 
on the subject of Geology delivered by W. E. Myer at his resi- 
dence. Also the kindness and respect which -he and his wife 
extended to the class. 
That we heartily endorse the able, efficient and impartial 
manner in which Prof. W. E. Lumley has conducted this insti- 
tute, and we feel assured that he has at heart the interest of 
both the teachers and the children of the State. 
That we cannot commend too highly the efficient work of the — 
excellent faculty sent us in the persons of L. 8. Gillentine, D. W. 
Bridges and Miss Mary Arthur. 
That we express our gratitude to Mr. J. A. Kept for earnest 
‘and faithful service as Secretary.
-P-A-G-E-576

That we favor a uniform examination of teachers, and that 
. certificates be valid in all counties of the State. 
Especially. do we feel grateful to the County’. Court for their . 
prompt response to the request for the State Institute to be held 
at Carthage, inasmuch as it appropriated $150 to the State 
Superintendent to help in defraying the expense for the same. 
That we are indebted to the press for their publications dur- 
ing the sessions. : Cuas. H. Oaxuey, Chin.

grades were below 75. One took the Primary examination in 
Pedagogy and one other branch and failed to make a passing 
grade in either, hence the certificate was not renewed.

LAWRENCEBURG STATE INSTITUTE. 
We have just closed a most successful institute. My asso- 
ciates were thoroughly competent and did very efficient work. 
Our attendance was large and regular and the interest mani- 
fested was very gratifying. The examinations were conducted 
in strict accordance with your instructions and the grading was 
close, there being almost 40 per cent of the teachers who failed. 
‘We were honored with a visit by our State Superintendent 
during the first week of the institute, which aroused a deeper 
interest in educational matters. We had also lectures by Louis 
Spencer Daniel, and Hon. E. W. Carmack’s splendid lecture on 
**Character.’’ , : 
The daily paper edited by E. B. Salsberry, one of our teach- 
ers, was an important factor in keeping up the interest.

STATE INSTITUTES FOR COLORED TEACHERS, 1907 
JACKSON STATE INSTITUTE. 
I have the honor to transmit to you the report of the State 
Institute held at Jackson, Tenn., June 8 to July 5, 1907: 
This. is the fourth session of the Jackson Institute held un- 
der my charge as-Conductor. Hach year has shown an improve- 
ment on the previous year as regards the enthusiasm of the 
teachers and the efficiency of the work done. For the most part 
we have had the same instructors—indeed so far as those rep- — 
resenting the State is concerned we have had the same in- 
structors. I wish to commend the work of these instructors. 
They are both men. of experience and skill and have been of 
great service to the teachers of this section during their four 
years’ employment. . 
‘The attendance of this year was not so large as that of last 
year owing to the lateness of locating-the institute. But what 
was lacking in numbers was fully gained in interest. The insti- 
tute has continued four weeks each year and the results of the 
good work can be seen in the character of the examination pa- 
pers, there being many teachers who have attended every year. 
The statistics for the session are as follows:

CLARKSVILLE STATE INSTITUTE. 
lt gives me pleasure to submit to you the report of the work 
done in the Clarksville Institute, which was established by you 
for the benefit of the colored teachers of Middle Tennessee. 
ATTENDANCE, 
The attendance at this institute was greater than that held 
here in 1906. While this is true, it was not what it might have 
been, nor what the faculty would have desired to have it. The 
enrollment might have been made to reach 150. The chief cause 
for this lack of a fuller attendance was that so many county in- 
stitutes were in session at the same time as the State Institute. 
This conflict of dates caused the absence of a great many teach- 
ers who would otherwise have been present. It would be 
a step in the right direction if the county institutes could be 
held at a time to bring them to a close before the opening of the 
State institutes. The list of bona fide members of the institute 
number 97; with nine counties represented. Montgomery, Stew- 
art, Robertson, Trousdale, Davidson, Williamson, Houston, 
Smith and Dickson counties had representatives present. 
Tue ProcraM. 
After the appointment of the faculty a program was imme- 
diately arranged through correspondence. All details were 
worked out in advance of the meeting. Subjects were assigned, 
plans matured and arrangements made before the day of open- 
ing. When the institute was formally called to order the printed 
program was carried out from day to day and extraneous mat- 
ters were not allowed to interfere with the regular work. Agents, 
boosters, advertisers and stump speakers were not allowed to in- 
terrupt the teachers or to consume their valuable time in orating. 
QUALITY OF THE Work. 
I eommend most heartily the quality of the work of the fac- 
ulty. I do not mean to say by this that all the work was per-
-P-A-G-E-586
  —528— oe 
fect or equally satisfactory. I think, however, that each member 
of the faculty did his best. There was no shirking. I am‘sure | 
that the teachers felt the effect of the teaching and that ae 
were benefited. 
. Success OF THE INSTITUTE. 
From private talks with the teachers as I would meet them 
on the street, in the school, or at the ckurches, and from: what 
I could learn from the citizens and friends, I am forced to be- 
lieve that the institute was a success. At the close of the insti- 
tute and before the teachers.sang their farewell song, ‘‘God be 
with you till we meet again,’’ an opportunity was given for 
free public expressicn as to. the benefits received and the results 
derived from the work. The verdict seemed to be unanimous 
that much good had Leen accomplished and that a new and fresh 
stimulus had been given the cause of education among the col- 
ored teachers of Middle Tennessee. 
‘VISITORS. 
The institute was not lacking in distinguished visitors, who 
came in to observe the character of the work being done. Among 
* the most distinguished were: Rt. Rev. Bishop C. H. Phillips, 
Rev. T. J. Goodall, Rev. I. L. Coleman, Rev. A. L. Pinkston.

faculty for their presence, helpful inspiration, thorough instruc- 
tion and painstaking ‘care ean never be paid.

cussion by Supt. E. H. Boyd, of Cookeville, and §. W. Sherrill, 
of Paris, the latter earnestly advocating closer supervision. 
“Should County Superintendents be Required to Devote All 
Their Time to Their Work,” was the subject of an interesting 
paper read by Supt. Fred. J. Page, of Williamson County. 
The Committee on President’s Address read their report, 
which was adopted. 
We your Committee on the President’s Address beg leave to 
submit the following report: 
After a careful consideration of the annual address of the 
President of the Public School Officers’ Association, we most 
heartily commend it as one of the most able, forcible and busi- 
ness-like papers ever presented to this honorable body. 
We fully and freely endorse the many wise and progressive 
ideas presentéd. We desire to call espécial attention to some of 
the most prominent and important features of this address: 
1. The recommendation as to increased appropriations for 
the benefit of our rural schools, whereby the per capita is in- 
creased to seventy-five cents, which will give at least asix months’ 
term to each and every school. Also, the appropriations for 
Peabody College, high schools, University of Tennessee, normal 
schools, and rural school libraries. 
2. The subject of the uniformity of the public school system 
of the State as giving more satisfactory results has been given 
the prominence this subject deserves. 
3. The suggestion as to the certification of teachers should 
meet the approbation of all friends of education in the State.
-P-A-G-E-596
—~—536— 
4. We are decidedly of the opinion that the strongest and 
best feature of the address is that part which discusses the super- 
vision of rural schools. His presentation of this subject is re- 
markably clear and convincing. The array of facts and figures 
bearing on this point shows extended research and theughtful 
investigation. 
Realizing the importance of the prominent features of this 
address at this particular time, we, your committee, most earn- 
estly recommend to the State Superintendent that the address of 
President A. L. Todd be published in pamphlet form-for dis- 
tribution throughout the State.

in the summer of 1884: .In 1877 he-entered Peabody Normal 
College, received the Peabody Scholarship in 1889, and A. B. de- 
gree in 1891. 
__ He was elected County Superintendent of Public Instruction 
of Wilson county in-1891, which position he resigned. to accept. 
the principalship of Washington Academy, afterward Cookeville 
High School. 
March 3, 1892, lie ‘was married’ to Miss Elizabeth Parsley, of 
Lebanon, and the following year was elected Principal of the 
Lebanon’ Public Schools.” 
In 1896 he. resigned. his position in Lebanon to accept the 
superintendency. of the Covington city schools. This. position 
he resigned after one year, having been elected President of the 
State Normal School of Florida. 
In 1908 he returned to Tennessee, having declined, on 1 account. 
of ill health, re-election to the presidency of the Florida State 
Normal School. : 
In 1903 he received A.M. degree from Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, and not long afterward published “The Little Schoolmis- 
tress,” a pleasing and helpful story of school life and work. 
The last years of his life were spent as the business agent of 
the Webb & Ware Drawing Book Company, of Nashville. 
He was drowned at the Isle of Palms, Charleston, 8. C., June 
14, 1906, while trying to save the life of a friend and former 
schoolmate in Peabody Normal College. 
Ever genial, cheerful and helpful, he lived to instruct, encour-. 
age and inspire others, and died manifesting that greatest love—. 
he laid down his life for his friend. 
Your committee recommend that this brief sketch of his life 
and work be published in the proceedings of this meeting of the 
Tennessee School Officers’ Association as a tribute to the memory 
of a loved and lost member.of this body, and a memorial to the. 
worth of a good citizen, a true teacher, a noble gentleman.

—546— 
addressing your Association. I bid you God-speed in the work 
‘and pledge you my hearty support in all your efforts to improve 
the schools of Tennessee. ‘Matcorm R. Parrerson.” - 
The Association replied as follows: 
His Excellency, Malcolm R. Patterson :- 
_ “The State Teachers’. Association very much regrets your in- 
ability to be present to address the teachers, but deeply appre- 
ciates your interest in public education and your, pledge of sup- 
port to improve the schools of Tennessee. P. L. Hapnep, 
Secretary and Treasurer.” 
A very unexpected change of the morning’s program came 
just here, when Supt. P. L. Harned, of Clarksville, presented to 
Capt. Seymour A. Mynders, Ex-State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, a very handsome loving cup, and State Superin- 
tendent R. L. Jones presented Mrs. Mynders a costly cut- glass 
punch bowl. 
In presenting-the cup, Supt. P. L. Harned said: 
“Capt. Mynders, your associates, representing every depart- 
ment of school work, are here at this hour to give expression 
of their ésteem of a man who has richly merited it; to give ex- 
pression of their appreciation of one whose work has been produe~ 
. tive of so much good to all the people of this great common- 
wealth. 
“ince you were made State Superintendent ot Public In- 
struction your influence for good has been felt all over the State. 
The people on the fertile plains, among the hills and rich-val- 
leys, and upon the mountain top alike had your attention, your 
sympathy, your best efforts. The children in the plain log 
school house as well as the children of costly city buildings of 
architectural beauty and comfort saw you, heard you, and are 
stepping upwards because of the inspiration you gave them. 
Without sufficient rest or reasonable recreation, your office on 
the railway car and in the saddle, sacrificing comfort and pleas- 
ure, you have gone where duty called you. 
_ “Looking out upon the possibilities ofa great State with an 
educated citizenship, your plans carefully studied and made, 
never wavering becauee of public sentiment or unjust criticism, 
no other motive than: the proper training of the eight hundred 
thousand boys and girls, of Tennessee, you pressed forwaid and 
achieved enviable results.
-P-A-G-E-609
  —547— , 
-“ Your work as State Superintendent for four years will be your 
own ample reward, but the school people of Tennessee owe it to 
themselves to make known in some visible way their genuine 
appreciation of your service, 
_* Representing the contributors, university men, college men, 
private school men, city superintendents, county superintend- 
_ ents; teachers, and little children, 1 desire, in their name, to - 
present to you this handsome loving cup. While it is made of 
the-finest silver and gold that money can buy, by the most 
skilled designers and workmen anywhere to be found; perfect in 
form, in design, in engraving, I beg you to accept it as only a 
feeble expression of the genuine feeling in the hearts of the peo- 
ple of Tennessee of esteem of your manhood and appreciation 
-of your noble work. It is engraved thus: 
Seymour A. Mynders, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
. State of Tennessee, 1903-1907. 
  
‘Presented by his co-workers as a testimonial of their esteem | 
- and appreciation of his efficient service. 
  
ene Knoxville, Tenn., July 24, 1907.   
“ He is great who does best what others do well.” 
  
  “And may it be handed down from generation to generation a 
lasting testimonial to one who truly merits it.” ae 
Lapt. Mynders responded as follows: 
Superintendent Harned, Mr. President, and. Teachers of the Association : 
“What I bave achieved in my work as State ‘Superintendent 
Towe largely to the cooperation of the officers and teachers of 
the State of Tennessee. I never made a call on the Superintend- 
ents or teachers of Tennessee to which they did not respond 
promply and cheerfully, and even did more than I asked of 
them If Ihave advanced the cause of education, I ask you to 
remember that it was due largely to the ‘public school officers 
and teachers. In that four years, in sunshine and in rain, all 
worked in harmony and unison and‘did well their part.- I be- 
lieve in. this way some things were accomplished, and great 
things are in store for you, and I ask you to join with me now 
in-eooperating with one worthy of this place-you have outlined 
for me, my successor.” y
-P-A-G-E-610
/ 548 — 
Supt. R. L. Jones spoke as follows: 
“Tt takes two great women to make a great man—a great 
mother and a great wife. Realizing the success. that Capt. 
Mynders has made in life, we know that he must have had the 
inspiration and the uplifting influence of a queenly wife and 
asaintly mother. The same body of friends that gave to him 
this loving cup, gives to you this token of their appreciation for 
‘you and the true woman. Realizing that while the husband 
may wage a campaign successfully, we know full well that the 
wife plans it and that she is fully as worthy of recognition and 
appreciation as the husband.” 
Mrs. Mynders reponded as. follows: 
Mr. President and Teachers of Tennessee : 
“T feel that I must try to speak a few words to express my 
appreciation for this lovely present. It is indeed a source of 
great satisfaction to feel that Mr. Mynders is held in such high 
esteem by his associates, and while we missed him sadly in the 
_ home, he certainly gave the best of his life to the work, and I 
am sure the loyal support given bim by the teachers and officers 
enabled him to accomplish much that he did in that important 
work. I have always prayed that success would attend upon 
the teachers and that God would bless every one of them, and 
that the schools might be made better through them. The Myn- 
ders family, his. wife, and himself, will always do everything 
and anything to help the public school system of Tennessee. 
I thank you again for your kind words and the beautiful tokens 
will speak to us of you.” . 
By. Mrs. Addie 0. Cheatham, of Clarksville: 
“We, the teachers of Montgomery County, send greetings 
and desire to express our appreciation of the splendid services 
_ rendered the cause of education in our State by our popular Ex- 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Captain Seymour A. 
Mynders. 
“A man so. conscientious, so frank, so bold, a man go far 
sighted, so untiring in energy, so thoroughly in earnest, deserves 
honest praise; and a man who knows every detail of school 
‘work and likewise the essential qualifications of a teacher, com- 
mands our admiration, , 
“ We cannot hold in too high regard this man who has never 
been unmindful of a teacher’s efforts and has never lost an op-
-P-A-G-E-611
=54G—- 
portunity to commend the efficient work of a co-laborer, a County 
Superintendent. . 
“We delight to honor a man whose watchword has been duty 
and whose chief aim has been to place the schools of Tennessee 
upon a higher plane. - 
- “Capt. Mynders has done a noble work for us. 
. He fought our battles bravely, 
. Against ignorance and sin, ~ 
He was always in the forefront 
And rarely failed to win. 
Too big for petty jealousy 
Toward one in “rank and file,” 
Too tall to “ stoop to conquer.” 
A hero all the while. 
Though to “boots and saddles” 
He no longer answers call, 
He still is held in high esteem. 
By his soldiers one and all. 
For he was a gallant captain 
And fought unceasingly 
For more thorough education 
In dear old Tennessee. 
“ “ His earnest logical appeals—all over the State—in behalf of 
the children should not only endear him to every citizen of this 
great commonwealth, but. awaken a deep. sense of gratitude for 
the untold benefits which. the whole State has reaped at and. will 
continue to reap until— — 
“The years grow old, 
_ And the days grow ‘cold, 
And the leaves of judgment book unfold,” 
The regular program was then taken up, and State Superin- 
tendent R. L. Jones discussed “ Results of Recent. Legislation.” 
» H.C. Weber, Superintendent of Nashville’ city schools, read 
an interesting paper on “The High School Course of Study, 
The Executive Committee announced some changes: made i in 
the prograin. 
“The Secretary stated that Mr. Claude J. Bell’s 1 name was in- 
advertenitly left off the printed program, and that the committee ~ 
had requested him to_prepare a paper on “Should Teachers 
Have Uniform Examinations Under State Supervision?” ‘This 
subject was then called and two very interesting papers. were 
tead-by Wharton S. Jones, of Memphis, and Claude J. Bell of 
Nashville, respectively.

9.. That 9 per cent of this fund be appropriated to the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee, to be used in such way as the General As- 
sembly may from time to time direct, or as its Board of Trustees 
may think best for the development of the University as the 
head of the public school system of the State, and for the main- 
tenance of agricultural and horticultural experiment stations 
under the direction of the University, and for cooperative agri- 
cultural experiments. 
10. That all schools receiving any portion of this general 
education fund shall be considered a part of the system of 
public education of the State, and shall be required to make an- 
nual reports to'the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
The enactment of this bill into law will harmonize all the 
educational interests of the State and make the school system a 
unit, each part of which will be vitally connected with and in- 
terested in every other part, as ic has never been before, and 
future legislation in regard to appropriations for public education 
may consist only of minor amendments to this law, changing the 
per cent from time to time and making such changes in the 
apportionment as the increasing wealth of the State may make 
possible and experience may show to be wise. 
Thirty per cent of the gross revenue of the State for the year 
1909 should amount to something more than one million dollars, 
which amount will increase gradually as the wealth of the State 
increases. 
The subject of “Child Labor in the Factories” was not dis- 
cussed, on account of the absence of Ex-Gov. John I: Cox and 
A. J. MéKelway. 
Miss Mary Johnson, of the Carnegie Library, Nashville, read 
a most interesting paper on “Public Libraries,” and on motion, 
‘the ‘Association instructed the Secretary to have this paper 
printed in the proceedings.

' “T very much appreciate the cooperation and help you have 
given me while I have been your President, and anything I 
can do for the good of the Association in the future I shall al- 
ways be glad to do. I will ask Mr. Hill, Mr. Wright and Mr. 
Simmons to conduct Mr. Lyon to the front. 
“ Ladies and Gentlemen—It gives me great pleasure to intro- 
duce to you Mr. P. A. Lyon, who will be President of the Asso- 
ciation for the next twelve months.

have placed in me. I believe that I would bespeak for the Asso- 
ciation that you will use your influence for the next year in 
making the next Association the very best we have ever had, 
and to make the work more pleasant and interesting and more 
worthy of our great body of teachers. We believe that.our As- 
sociation should stand for the best and highest in public school 
work. I want to ask yourcooperation and help, and I am sure_ 
with that we will make our work during the next year success- 
ful and profitable. . I am certainly grateful for this compliment. 
I appreciate it more than I can tell.” 
‘After the election Prof. Weber arose to urge that the mem-. 
bership be increased and that more interest be manifested by 
the members of the Association in the future. He regretted that 
so much of the program had not been carried out, and that so 
many members of the regular Executive Committee were absent. 
He made a motion that the Executive Committee for the next 
year agree on a place of meeting for the next session at either 
of two places—Monteagle or Monterey. The motion carried. It 
was voted that any Executive Committeeman who could not be. 
at the place of meeting twenty-four hours before the time of 
‘meeting should resign and his place be filled by the President 
of the Association.

REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
  
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
To the Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction of Ten- 
-  messee: 
‘Dear Sin—I take great pleasure in submitting my report of 
the organization and work of the University of Tennessee for the 
session. of 1907-8: 
The last report made to the Legislature by the Board of 
Trustees of the University stated that the preceding two years — 
had: marked a very considerable advance in the University. 
While this was undoubtedly a correct statement of facts, the 
advance made during the period referred to was small indeed 
. compared to that which has taken place during the two years 
just closed. During this period the University has at last come 
into its own. All doubt or question as to its relationship to the 
State and as to the State’s duty to it has been removed in the 
most complete and satisfactory manner. Realizing that the pub- 
lie were imperfectly informed in regard to the real relations be- 
tween the University and the State, as determined by acts of the 
Legislature from time to time, the Trustees appointed a com- 
mittee of their number to draw up a report in which were col- 
lected the various Acts of the Legislature referring to the Uni- 
versity, from the original charter of Blount College, passed by 
the Territorial Legislature of 1794, and drawing the evident con- 
- clusions from these various acts and from certain decisions of 
the Supreme Court of Tennessee as to the exact legal relation- 
ship of the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee tv 
the-State. In the words of that report: ‘‘In its essence, there- 
- fore, the University seems to us to be a public corporation, whose 
“ultimate control, through the appointment of trustees, rests én. 
_ tirely in the Legislature, and which, as an educational agency 
of the State, has been vested, in behalf of the people of the en- 
tia ate, with funds to be administered for their benefit and 
ose faithful use it has incurred the highest and most 
‘obligation. ” .    
  
-P-A-G-E-624
u 
—562— 
In accordance with the joint resolution passed by the General 
Assembly of 1905, directing the Attorney General of the State 
. to examine into and report to the next session of the Assembly 
the legal status of the University of Tennessee, Attorney Gen- 
eral Cates made to the General Assembly of 1907 a report. in 
which he confirms the finding of the committee of the Board of 
Trustees quoted above and gives it as his official opinion that 
the University is a State institution and entirely under the con- 
trol of the Legislature. This removed the only possible objec- 
tion that could have been raised to the making to the University 
of suitable appropriations from the State treasury for its de- 
velopment. Accordingly the bill appropriating $100,000 for 
specific purposes therein enumerated, which bill had been pre- 
pared by the Board of Trustees of the University and introduced 
in the Legislature at their request, was duly passed, thus. giving 
to the institution the opportunity to begin the work of the con- 
- struction of a modern State University of approved type. The 
improved spirit of the University growing out of the hopeful- 
ness of the faculty and students, caused by the liberality of the 
Legislature in passing this appropriation, has been during the 
past two years most marked, and where a few years back there 
was uncertainty and depression, there is now a feeling of confi- 
dence ‘and enthusiasm that shows itself in the work of every 
member of the organization. 
ORGANIZATION. 
The organization of the University remains the same as out- 
lined in my last report. As now constituted it comprises the 
following departments: 
1. The Graduate Department. 
2. The College of Liberal Arts. 
_ 3. The College of Engineering. 
4, The College of Agriculture. 
5. The Industrial Department (at Knoxville College) for 
Colored Youth. 
6. The School of Pharmacy. 
7. The Law Department. 
8. The Medieal Department. 
9. The Dental, Department.
-P-A-G-E-625
—563— 
The Medical and Dental Departments are located at Nash- 
ville. The other departments are located at Knoxville. All the 
departments, except the medical, are open to women on the 
same conditions as to men. : 
A somewhat full statement of the courses offered in the va- 
rious colleges of the University was given in the report to the 
State Superintendent in 1906. It will, therefore, be unnecessary 
to repeat it here. The work has been developed in all depart- 
ments since the making of that report, and several new depart- 
ments have been established. 
New DEPARTMENTS. 
The new departments established during the past two years 
are as follows: 
The Department of Geology and Mineralogy has been estab- 
lished and newly equipped with representative collections of 
rocks, minerals, geological and crystallographie models and other 
appliances that, added to the collection in hand, make an ad- 
mirable working outfit for the study of this very important sub- 
. ject. The very interesting character of the geology of Tennessee, 
. as well as the’ economic importance of its study, makes the es- 
tablishment of this chair an event in the history of the Univer- 
sity. The Department of Geology has been given ample space, 
having a suite of six rooms, including a large museum room, 
all of which have been specially fitted up for it. It is believed 
that the work to be done by this department will not only be of 
prime educational value, but will also contribute to a better 
understanding of the natural resources of the State, and will 
thus help to bring about the establishment of a State Geological 
” Survey, a consummation greatly to be desired. 
The Department of Mining Engineering and Metallurgy has 
been established with the conviction that a technical school serv- — 
‘ing a State of as great natural mineral resources as this State is 
possessed of would be incomplete without a well developed de- 
partment of this kind. It will be the object of the board to 
strengthen this department: by providing it with equipment and 
all needed help to successful instruction as rapidly as the funds 
will allow. It has been given ample space for the growth which 
seems inevitable within the next few years. Already it is at-
-P-A-G-E-626
—5t4— 
tracting the attention of the students, and the outlook for a 
strong development is excellent. 
For a number of years past the departments of Physics and 
Electrical Engineering have been conducted jointly. With the 
conviction that each of the subjects is large enough to occupy 
the full time of at least one man, those chairs have been sepa- 
rated; the subject of electrical engineering being retained by 
_ Dr. C. A. Perkins, whe formerly handled both subjects, and 
ample space and greatly enlarged equipment have been provided 
for the Department of Electrical Engineering in Estabrook Hall, 
the new engineering building constructed with the appropriation 
from the Legislature of 1905. The Department of Physics has 
been entirely reorganized and reequipped. Its quarters have 
-been thoroughly overhauled, a large amount of new apparatus 
of the most. approved modern character has been added, and: the 
department is now in excellent shape for doing a high grade of 
modern work in this fundamental science. 
The great importance of animal husbandry as a phase of 
the agricultural interests of the State has made it essential to 
emphasize the study of the animal side of agriculture to a degree 
not possible heretofore with our limited agricultural faculty. 
The appointment of specialist in animal husbandry, to supple- 
ment the agricultural experts already here, has done much to 
stimulate an increased interest on the part of our students in the” 
pursuit of this most interesting and important subject. It is 
hoped that means may be provided in the near future for a con- 
‘siderable increase in the herd of typical animals, to the end that 
not only more effective teaching may be done, but that enlarged _ 
opportunity for scientific investigation may be afforded. 
One of the most pressing questions before the educational , 
world at the present time is the reconstruction of the rural 
school to the end that it may not only be more efficient as a 
trainer of men and women who are to spend their lives in the 
country, but that it may prepare those men and women to live 
on a higher plane by opening their minds to an appreciation of 
the beauties of nature by which they are surrounded, The prob- 
lem of how to carry this knowledge into the schools and how to 
make them effective in dispensing it is one that may well call 
for the whole time and thought of a skilled educational expert. 
With the object of advancing this work in our State the Depart-
-P-A-G-E-627
  —565— 
ment of Agricultural Education has been established in the Uni- © 
versity with the double purpose of instructing the students in 
attendance here, and thus prepare them to go out to do effective 
work in the schools, and of assisting, in a practical way, in the 
introduction of agricultural and natural science work in existing 
schools and by teachers already in the field. 
ADVANTAGES OF THE UNIVERSITY. - 
The. University is rapidly becoming, in the number and char- 
acter of its faculty, and in the nature and amount of its equip- 
ment, one of the best institutions in the Southern States. Not 
only is the institution strong along the lines of the classics and 
modern languages and of philosophy and the sciences, but it is 
especially. strong in the technological courses, in the courses in 
agriculture, in education, in law, and in pharmacy. The con- 
ditions of student life here are favorable and nowhere is there 
greater sympathy felt for the young man or young woman who 
is striving to obtain a good collegiate training and who needs 
to depend wholly, or in part, on his.or her own resources. There 
are some opportunities for self-help and these are naturally 
greater from the fact that the University is situated in a thriv-- 
ing city. But one of the most important facts to this class of 
students is that we have loan funds from which such students 
may borrow 4 sufficient amount of money to defray a.good part 
of their yearly expenses, repaying the loan after graduation or 
as soon as convenient. In no way can philanthropy more directly 
reach & worthy object than through contributions to the increase 
of these loan funds. They are greatly appreciated by the stu- 
dents, and much larger amounts than are now available could 
be utilized to good purpose. The system works perfectly, the 
_ borrowers being prompt in the payment of principal and interest, 
showing that they do not find the conditions under which the - 
loans.are made as unduly onerous. 
I desire to call especial attention to a fact that does not seem 
to-be sufficiently well understood by members of the Legislature 
in making their appointments to scholarships, and by the public, 
namely, that the University is open to women on the same con- 
ditions as'to men. This is as it should be. The State owes to its 
daughters a debt not less great than it owes to its sons, and an 
educated. womanhood will have the most far-reaching influence
-P-A-G-E-628
on the civilization of the future. All of the departments of the 
University, except the Department of Medicine, are open to 
women. With the passage by the last Legislature of an act au- 
thorizing women to practice law in the State, there will arise a 
limited demand for instruction in law from that sex. The Uni- 
versity already has received, and will continue to receive, women 
in the law courses. Perhaps the greatest opportunity that is 
open to them, however, is that of teaching, and it is our object 
to supply as fully as the available means will allow, the most 
satisfactory preparation for that career. The women students 
of the University, besides enjoying all the other advantages of 
the institution, have the benefit of the direct influence and su- 
pervision of a cultured lady who acts as their Dean and of the 
building especially devoted to them and which forms a satisfac- 
tory home. It is hoped, therefore, that an increasingly large 
number of young women may avail themselves of the opportun- 
_ities here offered to obtain a real college education under condi- 
tions which are not excelled in any institution, public or private, 
in the Southern States. 
EpucationaL STANDARDS. 
The general advance in the standards of education through- 
out the country, due to the increasing provision for such educa- 
tion by publie taxation, has necessitated an advance in the stand- 
ard of teaching in higher institutions. The University of Ten- 
nessee, in common with its sister institutions of the South, has 
advanced its standards for admission as rapidly as the public 
and other high schools of the State will justify. It will, how- 
ever, be careful that its requirements are not made so difficult as 
to he beyond the reach of the students from schools of good high 
school grade. It would, of course, be a waste of the money of 
the State for the University to do the work that properly be- 
' longs to the high schools, and such policy would be discouraging 
to the high school principals and superintendents who are trying 
to build up their schools to the proper standard. It is important, 
however, that the standards and plans of the University shall 
accord with those of the best State institutions in all parts of 
the country’ To say the least, these standards and plans should 
not lag behind those in any of the sister institutions of the South- 
ern States. There is at the present time a general movement 
throughout the country to standardize colleges ‘and universities
-P-A-G-E-629
—567— 
and to correlate their work closely and logically to the work of 
the high schools. The high school has already been standardized 
in a large part of the country; the standard high school com- 
prising four years of work beginning with the ninth grade of 
the school system. The college, therefore, should assume the 
work of the four-year high school as completed by the student 
before entering on the standard college course. While this is 
the proper ideal, it may be some years before it is perfectly re- 
alized at the University of Tennessee, from the fact that rela- 
tively few high schools in our State are now on a four-year basis. 
As soon, however, as the majority of the high schools in the State - 
are on such a basis, it will be in every way wise for the college to 
expect students who apply for admission to it to have completed 
the work of such a high school, or to have received equivalent 
preparation in some other way. 
During the past two years important changes have been made 
in the curriculum of studies of the college of Liberal Arts of the 
University. These changes have been such as to align our work 
with that of the best State universities in other States and to 
give increased opportunity to the students to broaden their 
courses of study so 2s to include, if desired, a larger proportion 
of the so-called modern subjects, such as the sciences, modern 
languages, philosophy, economics, education, etc., and especially 
dees the modification in the curriculum make possible a better 
arrangement of studies for those students who have in view’ 
preparation for teaching in the high schools of the State. We 
believe that it is a proper function of the State University, as 
the head of the public school system of the State, to prepare 
teachers for the high schools. ' 
These high schocls in turn will be largely instrumental in 
preparing teachers for the grade schools of the towns and coun- 
try, so that through the work of the preparation of the high- 
school teachers the University may extend its influence in an- 
other and very important way to the whole educational system 
of the State. Changes in the details of the courses of the col- 
leges of engineering and agriculture have also been made, but 
these changes are not so radical or far-reaching as those made 
in the curriculum of the College of Liberal Arts.

Recent GrowTH oF THE UNIVERSITY. 
It is hardly to be considered a satisfactory way to estimate 
the progress of an institution of higher education by a mere
-P-A-G-E-631
  —569— 
study ‘of statistics of increase in attendance of students, or by’ 
the increase in the number of the teaching staff, or in the build- . 
ings and other material equipment. There is a subtle spirit in 
an institution of this kind the development of which indicates 
more truly the real progress than any increase in material as- 
sets, Judged by either or both standards, however, the Univer- 
sity has made in the past a very marked advance—an advanee 
which shows no signs of slacking, but is increasing at an accel- 
erated rate. The spiritual advance cannot be presented prop- 
erly by. verbal statements. It is nevertheless true that.such ad- 
vance has certainly occurred. In every way the spirit of the 
institution has been improved. There is a higher tone in the 
student body; there is a finer college spirit and a consequently 
truer-love for alma mater; there is a higher grade of scholarship 
shown in the class rcom; there is a moré evident purpose in all 
the college activities. 
Some facts of a kind that can be shown. by statistics will be 
interesting. The following table will indicate in a general way 
the increase in the number of students in attendance. Except 
the last column it refers to attendance ‘‘on the Hill’’ at Knox- 
'‘vilie. The first column of totals gives the numbers in attendance

1. The remodelling of South College, with introduction of 
a system of steam heating into it and the installation of a new 
electric lighting system. A number of small rooms have been 
thrown together, resulting in the addition of five class rooms and 
the great improvement of the postoffice and cooperative store. 
2. The repairs to Old College, East and West Colleges and 
the Y. M. C. A. building, which, while only partial, have im- 
proved their appearance and convenience. The building of a 
swimming pool in the Y. M. C. A. building has been much ap- 
preciated by the students. 
3. The construction of the large front addition to Estabrook 
Hall, making practically a new building of it, and trebling the 
floor space available for instruction, and providing excellent ad-

ditional laboratories for heat engines, fuel analysis, hydraulics, 
materials testing, electrical engineering, ete. 
4, The construction of Morrill Hall, which has put the in- 
structional work in Zoology and Botany for academic students . 
and the work in all departments for agricultural students on a . 
greatly improved basis. The work of the Agricultural Expéri- 
ment Station and the State Board of Entomology has also been 
greatly benefited by the new quarters provided for them. 
- 5. The remodelling of Carrick Hall for the departments of 
‘Geology and Mineralogy, and of Mining Engineering and Me- 
tallurgy, giving them ample space for their present needs. 
6. Greatly increased equipment in the Experiment. Station 
laboratories, purchased by the Adams Fund, including pro- 
visions for investigations in chemistry and agronomy, zoology 
and entomology, botany and bacteriology, ete. 
7. .A new electric lighting plant and boiler, giving greatly 
improved service and capacity sufficient for several new build- 
ings. . . 
8. Increased equipment in the departments of Mechanical, 
Civil and Electrical Engineering, from the State appropriations 
and from the Government funds. 
9. Practically an entirely new equipment of the most 
modern character for the Department of Physics, and the entire 
renovation of the physical laboratories and lecture room. 
10... The establishment of laboratories of geology and min- 
eralogy, and of a geological museum, and the provision of a 
partial equipment for the same. - 
11. The establishment of laboratories for mining engineer- 
ing and metallurgy and the partial equipment of the same. 
_ 12. The grading and preparation of an athletic field, in- 
eluding the construction of adequate and excellent bleachers and 
an ornamental iron fence in the front of the grounds. 
13.. The establishment and partial equipment of a laboratory 
of experimental psychology. 
~ 14. The establishment and partial equipment of a studio for 
freehand drawing and water color painting and design. 
15. .The establishment under a special librarian of the law 
library and considerable additions to it.

EXTENSION Work oF THE UNivERSITy. 
It is not the plan of the University to restrict its activities 
to those persons who happen to be in regular attendance on its 
courses of instruction, but in every way that is possible it is its: 
purpose to reach out and be helpful to the people of the State, 
many of whom might not otherwise be able to come under its 
influence. With the object of assisting the high schools of the 
State there has been established and carried out a system of 
university extension lectures which have been furnished at a
-P-A-G-E-635
  nominal cost, just sufficient to cover actual 
These lectures have been given to a large! 
in all parts of the State. More than fi: 
to these schools for their selection and a: 
‘sity faculty have gone out on call. This 1: 
successful and highly appreciated during’ 
same program will be carried out during t; 
an enlarged list and additional lecturers. 
The members ofwthe agricultural fac 
- ready to respond to the call of the State 
culture or of the organized agricultural 
eonduct or take part in farmers’ institu: 
been held. Our men have been very glad to seize the oppor? ~ 
tunities of helping the farmers of the State and of bringing .. 
before them in a live and interesting way the results obtained. 
at our own experiment station and at thé similar stations dis-. 
- tributed throughout the world. The inerease in interest in these: 
. great agricultural gatherings indicates, the coming of a better 
day for agriculture in all parts of our country. Our agricul- 
’ tural men have also taken an active part in connection with the 
State Fair at Nashville, and have gone to all parts of the State 
to: study various local agricultural problems and to instruct 
‘groups of farmers in definite improved processes of cultivation. 
In this way our professor of horticulture has visited West Ten- 
nessee and made a special study of the trucking interests of that 
section, the results of which he embodied in a report published 
by the Commissioner of Agriculture in 1907, and he has more 
recently gone very thoroughly over the Middle and Kastern di- 
visions of the State, studying and demonstrating the best methods 
of treatment of ‘fruit trees. The dairy work carried on in this 
State by the United States Department of “Agriculture has its 
headquarters at the University and is conducted in full sympathy 
with the University’s objects and methods. The short courses 
in agriculture offered free of charge to the young farmers of the 
State have become increasingly popular year by year, and are 
doing much good to many persons, young and old, who could not 
attend the regular college classes. These short courses are con- 
dueted at the University during the months of January and 
February. 
~~ In order to awaken a more intelligént interest in the ques- 
tion of instruction in agriculture in the schools and to supply
-P-A-G-E-636
. —574— 
.as rapidly as possible a body of teachers prepared to do school 
’ work in that subject, the University has conducted for the past’ 
two summers, a course in agriculture, six weeks in length, for 
the teachers of the State. It has invited the County Superin- 
tendent of each county to appoint four teachers from his county 
to come to the University and follow this course without any 
charge whatsoever. The active and increasing interest in this 
work is shown by the fact that during the first summer there 
were about 70 Tennessee teachers in attensance, while during 
the second summer this number had increased to 110. This in: 
dicated that this work is appreciated and useful, and it will be 
continued as long as there seems to be a demand for and in- 
terest in it. 
A part of the regular work of the professor of education in 
the University is to stimulate in every possible way the estab- 
lishment of high schcols in the various counties of the State and 
to this-end he spends a good portion of his time going from 
county to county engaged in this campaign work. Supplemen- 
tary to the high school movement, the general educational cam- 
paign conducted by the State Superintendent of Public Instrue- 
tion has been participated in by our professor of education, Prof. 
Claxton and by others connected with the University. In these 
and many other ways the University tries to use its resources 
of men and money to advance the general educational interests 
of the State. . 
Summer Scuoon or tae Sours. 
The Summer School of the South, while not conducted di- 
rectly by the University as such, should neverthless not be over- 
looked in a statement of the University’s activities. This school 
has conducted two very successful sessions since the making of 
the last report, in both of which the attendance has been very 
large. In the summer of 1907 there were 1,871 teachers and 
others in attendance, and in the summer of 1908 there were 2,087 
in attendance. The school is unique in character and appeals to 
the teachers of all parts ef the South particularly, and is at- 
tractive to many from other portions of the Union. The Uni- 
versity extends to the summer school the free use of its grounds, 
buildings, library, scientific apparatus, etc., and has supplied it 
with light, water, janitors’ service, ete., so that the success of the 
school has been largely due to the University’s hospitality, both
-P-A-G-E-637
—575— 
on account of the use of its plant and on account of its unequaled 
geographical location and climatic conditions, making it pecu- 
liarly adapted to attract Southern teachers. It is anticipated 
that the school will continue to be operated at the University for 
a term of years, or as long as it seems to be distinctly called for.

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
_ Report of James D. Porter, Chancellor of the University of 
Nashville, and President of Peabody College. 
    NASHVILLE, TENN., November 18, 1908. 
‘Prof. R. L. Jones, State Superintendent: 
The scholastic year for the college officially began on the 
‘14th of September. The enrollment this year is very gratifying 
to the Chancellor and the members of the faculty, and surpasses 
the fondest hope of the most optimistically-minded among them. 
  Owing to the new standard for entrance (fourteen Carnegie 
“ units), which the college recently adopted—a standard higher 
than that obtaining in the majority of Southern colleges, and 
* for which very: few Southern high schools furnish adequate 
preparation—and owing also to the increased requirements for 
the Bachelor’s Degree, and the sharp line of demarcation drawn 
between the normal school, which offers only the L. I. diploma, 
and the college for teachers, which offers the A. B. Degree, it 
was naturally expected that there would be a great falling off 
in the attendance. Furthermore, Peabody College does not ad- 
vertise in the magazines and newspapers, as do so very many of 
the colleges ; but notwithstanding these facts the enrollment this 
quarter is entirely satisfactory. In the number are to be found 
students from the following States: Alabama, Arkansas, Cali- 
fornia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mexico, Missis- 
sippi, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Tennessee and Texas. Of this number, too, there are ninety 
zandidates for the A. B. Degree, almost twice as many as were 
expected, many of whom come from the ranks of the graduates 
of our Normal Department. The opening results are very en- 
couraging to the Chancellor and the members of the faculty, 
and cause both to feel that they have taken a step in the right 
direction, and that their efforts to raise the standard of college 
and professional edueation in the South are being appreciated 
by its people.

  -The course of study has been completely reorganized. : ‘Under - 
the new plan the institution is divided into the college and the: 
normal school. The college requires fourteen (Carnegie) units. . 
for’ admission to the curricula leading to the Bachelor’s Degree... 
“The courses are designed to train teachers for leaders in all de- 
partments of public education. The normal school requires 
  eight! and one-half (Carnegie) units and is designed to train > 
“teachers for all work in the elementary schools. It’ is announced 
“dnythe annual catalogue that students who satisfy the fourteen’ 
_ units required for éntrance to the college, and who complete any . 
-one-of the four years’ curricula with a credit of fifteen hours 
-a quarter for twelve quarters, a total of 180 hours, together with we 
the ework of nine quarters in the gymnasium, will receive ‘the 
A.B. Degree. : 
.. Entrance to the normal school, after the ‘ourrent scholastic 
reat, Will be raised to ten and one-half units, and it is intended 
to raise the entrance requirements to fourteen units in 1910; 
bat where students cannot take the four years’ course, provision 
‘will be made for a two years’ course in seme specifie lines of 
“work leading to a diploma, but not to a degree. .   
   
. ‘Peabody graduates as teachers are.in constant and increasing 
demand. The college cannot supply the call for them. As a 
“general rule they arc engaged before graduation. For the past 
“ten years a large per cent are employed in the States south of 
“Tennessee. Better salaries are offered in the primary schools 
_ in-those States, and they go where their services seem to. be 
"most appreciated. . 
~The faculty counts two new members this year—Dr. Josiah 
Morse and Prof. George Herbert Clarke. Dr. Morse,.who took 
his doctor’s degree at Clark University, will prove a strong ad--. 
. dition to the Department of Philosophy, Psychology and Educa-._ 
tion. Prof. Clarke is not a stranger to Peabody, having taught 
-heré during three of the summer schools. He will be in. charge 
of the Department of English Literature until Prof. Bourland’s 
return from Germany. 
The seholastie year of 1907-1908 has been a prosperous one 
to the college in spite of its limited equipment and resources... 
The attendance was all that the authorities anticipated, and the — 
character of the students was good. Since the inauguration of 
an_inereased number of high ‘schools in the Southern States the

standard of education has greatly improved, and fewer students 
are sent to the preparatory department for preparation for col- 
lege work. 
THE Ropert WINTHROP ScHOOL. 
_ The Winthrop School of Peabody College has heretofore in- 
eluded both an elementary school, with a course of study equiva- 
lent to that usually covered by the eight grades in a well organ- 
ized public school system, and also a secondary school offering 
preparation sufficient for entrance to the Normal Department 
in Peabody College. The increased preparation now necessary 
for students entering the college for the Bachelor of Arts De- 
gree, or the Normal School for the Licentiate of Instruction 
diploma, made a reorganization of the course of study at the 
Winthrop imperative. / 
The elementary department of the school has been discon- 
tinued, and the observation and practice work formerly done 
there by students taking professional courses in the Normal De- 
partment of the college, will be henceforth provided for through 
substitute work in the city public school under the supervision 
of special critic teachers. The secondary department, however, 
will continue its work, but with greatly increased facilities and 
with a course of study of much wider scope. The school now 
offers a course of study extending over four years, and provides 
thorough preparation for entrance to any of the larger colleges 
in the land. Its function, as outlined by its director, Dr. A. T. 
Barrett, who is also Professor of Edueation in the college, is 
three-fold: First, to prepare young men and women for college 
work; second, to furnish opportunity for those unable to enter 
Peabody College in full standing to remove their conditions, and 
third, to offer a field for observation and practice to students 
taking those courses in the college which prepare them to become 
superintendents, principals and high school teachers. 
The Winthrop School opened September 16. Before the first 
month had passed students applying for admission had to be 
turned away, because the seating capacity of the building would 
not admit of further increase in enrollment. The total number 
in attendance is 167. Of this number 112 are from Tennessee, 
the remainder from Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and 
Indiana. 
The mental and physical needs of the pupils are carefully

flourishing literary societies have been or

rience for the positions they. oceupy. If

The County Court of Davidson County has again'manifested: 
warm interest in the fortunes of the college by extending ‘the 
time limit for complying with its promises of $100,000 ‘bonds’ : 
to January, 1910. his action was by a unanimous vote of the 
Justices in quarterly court assembled. : 
      “The Legislature of Tennessee, to assemble in January, 1909, 
will reenact the appropriation of $250,000 heretofore made. The 
city appropriation of $200,000 will be-delivered whenever the 
Trustees of the Peabody Education Board are ready to receive it. 
Mepats AND Prizes. 
. The Dudley Medal—In 1906 a sum was given by Mr. R. H. 
Dudley, Sr.,.of Nashville, Tenn., to provide a medal in Athenian 
gold to be awarded annually to that man of the senior‘ class who, 
in the opinion of the faculty, has exhibited throughout his col- 
lege course conspicuous evidence of worth (1) in scholarship, 
(2) in-qualities of leadership and (3) in strength of character. 
The Lindsley Medal—Annually since 1902 the Woman’s As- 
sociation ‘of the University of Nashville has. given a gold medal 
to that woman of the senior class who, in the opinion of the fac- 
ulty, has exhibited throughout her college course conspicuous 
evidence of worth (1) in scholarship and (2) in womantiness. 
_ The Cooley Medal—A sum was given by Mr. Theodore Cooley, 
new dead, of Nashville, Tenn., to provide for a gold medal to 
be awarded annually, as has been done since 1899, by a jury of . 
three critics, for the best piece of work drawn by a member of 
the life class in art. . 
The Stief Medal—Beginning with 1905 the B. H. Stief Jew-
-P-A-G-E-644
. —580— 
elry Company, of Nashville, Tenn., has given’a gold medal to 
be awarded annually hereafter for general excellence to that 
member of the advanced classes in art who has made the best 
average for a period of two years. The decision is to be made 
upon the basis of (1) work in class for two consecutive years, 
and (2) the merit of some piece or pieces of art presented for 
examination to a jury of three critics selected by the faculty. 
The Colonial Dames. Prize—$10 in gold has been given an- 
nually since’ 1900 by the Society of Colonial Dames of America 
resident in the State of Tennessee. The award will be made to 
that member of the classes in American history who, in the 
opinion of the faculty, shows conspicuous knowledge of colonial 
history as evidenced (1) by work in class for the period of a 
year, and: (2) by a thesis on some topic assigned by the pro- 
fessor in, charge. 
Provision has been made in perpetuity for the medals named. 
They are treated as badges of honor and are so prized by those 
students who become contestants for them. 
I sent out two of the college professors to different divisions 
of the State of Tennessee during the past summer for a canvass 
of the State in the mterest of education. They were known as 
professors “of this college, but were not in its special interest, 
and were missionaries of general education. Their efforts added 
general interest and. enthusiasm among the people of the State. 
Several other members of the faculty were available for this 
work and would have been sent to other States but for the want 
of money for expenses. 
The Summer School, under the direction of Dr. Charles E. 
Little, was eminently satisfactory in all respects. It was not a 
dress parade, but an opportunity for real work for those who 
were seeking advancement and improvement. The rules pre- 
vailing at the regular session were enforced; credits were given 
where they were earned, and diplomas in the college were 
awarded to students who worked off conditions imposed at the 
regular session. Representative students were present from all 
States of the South, and no criticism could be made-as to their 
character or earnestness as students. The report of Dr. Little, 
Superintendent, accompanies this report. :

  REPORT OF SUMMER SESSIONS. 
  : NASHVILLE, TENN., September 15, 1908. 
President James D. Porter, Peabody College for Teathers: 
'* T have the honor of presenting below. my report as Super- 
“ intendent of the Summer Session of the college, which extends 
“through eight weeks, from June 10 to August 5, 1908. 
Ldst year I had most satisfactory. progress to report in all 
.: lines of our summer work. (For details see Bulletin, Vol. 6, 
No. 5, November 1907.) Internally the growth has not been so 
marked this year, when measured arithmeticdlly. The number™ 
“of courses offered and the corps of instructors giving | them have~ 
remained much the same as last year. But a real gain has been 
“made in getting the various courses better adjusted to each 
other and to the several types of students, and a greater gain 
-still was won by reducing to system the oversight of students, 
the advisory work cf guiding their choice of subjects, both as 
=regards time and amount, and the general administration of 
“incentives to wholesome effort and of checks on demoralizing 
“-eonduct. A fine response to all these attempts came from the 
- student body, showing a high standard of fitness for college life. 
In qualities of these higher sorts no body of students could sur- 
~ pass those assembled in our last summer session. I have noth- 
ing but praise for their spirit and ideals. In scholastic acquire- 
- ments, too, their standard was high; but much still remains to ~ 
   
-P-A-G-E-646
—582— 
be desired in the scholarship of the general average of our teach- 
ers, despite the fact that most of those who come to Peabody are 
far above the average in this respect. 
While the instructors and courses showed no great numeri- 
eal increase over 1907, a series of lectures given on Friday. eve- 
nings was a new feature greatly appreciated by the students. 
These lectures added much to the general good tone of the ses- 
sion and were both relaxation and inspiration. Not only did — 
large numbers of students attend them, but many from the city 
as well came to hear. The lectures and their subjeets were: - 
June 12, Prof. P. H. Manning, ‘‘Some Effects of Forest Re 
moval;’’? June 19, Prof. Josiah Morse, ‘‘A New Chapter in the 
History of Education ;’’ June 26, Prof. J. B. Wharey, ‘‘Sidney 
Lanie? ;’’ July 10, Prof. A. T. Barrett, ‘“The Unconcious Factor 
in Education ;’’ July 17, Prof. D. 8. Hill, “‘The Doctrine of 
Formal Discipline ;’’ July 24, Prof. J. W. Brister, ‘‘A Call for 
Teachers.’’ 
" . Externally the growth of our work was noteworthy. The- 
student body came from all parts of the South in a very repre- 
sentative way and number 377 (98 men, 279 women), as com- 
pared to 310 in 1907. An annual increase of nearly 18 per cent 
shows the steady demand for the kind of work we are doing, 
and constant expressions from those who are acquainted with 
other summer schools commend our plan above that of nearly 
all of them. Our facilities and budget are taxed to the utmost 
in caring properly for the large number of students who now 
attend each summer. The present duty is urgent that we con- 
stantly improve our methods of giving these students hereafter 
even a fuller return for their efforts and a richer equipment for 
their future profession. This raises many questions regarding 
the work of next summer. I state some of them, which will need 
to be solved during the next few months: (1) The length of 
the summer quarter, considered with reference to our climate 
and to the other quarters of our college year; (2) the nature 
of the courses to be offered, viewed in the same two aspects; 
(3) a better classification of work and of students, a better ad- _ 
justment of courses to varying needs; (4) a grading of fees 
according to number and kind of courses taken, and (5) special 
provision for vital help to elementary teachers from rural 
schools. . °

I cannot close this report without naming the contrast to the 
bright picture I have drawn, and indeed not overdrawn. ‘As 
real as that picture is, we must face the fact that our financial 
support for this work is distressingly meagre. Its importance 
“and success call for liberal sums towards its further advance- 
ment. And in this connection it must be realized that the life 
of our instructors is so strenuous that they cannot much longer 
stand the physical strain of working both winter and summer, | 
not feeling themselves financially warranted in taking a holiday.

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
    to the Hon. R. L. Jones, Superintendent Public Instruction, 
+ State of Tennessee: 
- Dear Sm—In accordance with your request I have the honor 
_ to submit the twenty-first annual report upon the condition of 
‘the work of the Tennessee Industrial School, together with a 
financial statement of its affairs from December 19, 1906, to 
- December 19, 1907. I assure you that it gives me pleasure to 
state that the child institution, born December 15, 1886, after 
“having passed through many vicissitudes and much hardship, 
has arrived in its day of majority safely and securely within 
the confines of the great heart of helpful Tennessee. 
The health of the children has been exceedingly good. We 
have not suffered from any contagious diseases, except measles, 
which was of light form and did not prove serious, save in two 
or three cases. 
Our supply of water has been greatly diminished during the 
past summer and fall on account of the exceptionally long pe- 
riod of dry weather. It would be an advantage to make the 
well deeper. 
The deportment of the children has been very satisfactory, 
both in the school rooms and work departments, and we have 
no cause to find fault with their conduct in any way. 
We have received since December 19, 1906, 293 white boys, 
_ 5@ white girls, 4 colored boys and two colored girls. We have 
also received. 152 pay wards and have discharged 72. There are in 
sehool at present 774 pupils; of these 659 are State pupils, and 
115.are pay wards. Since the opening of the institution, De- 
cember 15, 1886, to December 19, 1907, 4,749 pupils have been 
received. Of this number 3,664 were white boys, 848 white girls ; 
230 colored boys, and 7 colored girls. 
The following is a statistical summary of the financial re- 
eeipts and disbursements from December 19, 1906, to December 
19, 1907:

$68.57; from sale of livestock $212.13; from refunded money 
$49.05 ; total receipts for the year $88,147.45. We have expended 
during the one year on subsistence account $75,671.35; furnish- 
ings account $7,939.97; improvements and general repairs $4,- 
122,42, making a total expenditure of $88,333.74. 
We have kept our farm lands well fertilized with barnyard 
manure. It is not unusual for us to raise two or three crops a 
‘ 
wh he 
year from the same ground. We raise principally Irish potatoes, - ° 
sweet’ potatoes, beans, peas, onions, lettuce, raddishes, butter 
beans, carrots, parsnips, beets, cucumbers, cabbage, ‘tomatoes, 
okra, winter turnip greens and kale. 
Our work shops and manual training features are a source 
of pleasure. The children have at all.times displayed a spirit 
‘of cheerful willingness in performing whatever duties that have 
been assigned them, and have manifested an interest and a de- 
“ sire to thoroughly master the trades and branches taught. How 
-- well they have succeeded in this laudable desire is abundantly 
Es ‘evidenced by the fact that few, if any,.of the young persons 
“Jearning a business here fail to find steady employment, at good 
salaries, after their dismissal from the institution. Of the 
4,749 pupils who have left the institution, many of whom -are 
engaged. in many of the leading trades, and some have entered 
the professions, a number of notable examples of their success 
-. may be cited. The children have been engaged in the following 
trades and industries: 
Ln “Bookkeeping, telegraphy, architectural and free hand .draw- 
ing, cabinet making, furniture upholstering; steam laundering 
-work, vegetable gardening, floriculture work, barber shop work, 
~barn-and eare of stock, shorthand, typewriting, printing, broom- 
“making, wood carving, tailoring, farming work in hot beds, work 
©: im machine shop, store keeping. 
Each of the various departments is helpful to the institu- 
tion and to-the children alike. Nearly all of the shoes, clothing, 
furniture, brooms, etc., consumed and used by the institution, 
are made by the children. We raise most of our own vegetables; 
do’a ‘greater’ part of our own painting and general plumbing

aminations are given as often as there is cause for same. The 
daily school hours are divided into two sessions, viz.: The morn- 
ing session, extending from 7 until 11 o’elock, and the afternoon 
session from 1 unti: 5 o‘clock. One-half the children are in 
school and one-half are at work during each session. This af- 
fords each child more time and attention for both mechanical 
and literary work, insuring a more thorough understanding and 
. Yapid advancement along both lines. As only lady teachers are 
employed in the literary departments every child is placed, for 
‘about five hours each day, under the management and influence 
of a good woman. 
Our music departments continue to support the reputation 
they have established. The brass band, composed of boys be- 
tween the ages of 12 and 17, is generally and favorably known 
throughout the State. There are also classes in vocal and in- 
strumental music, whieh are arranged and directed by compe- 
tent teachers. 
The official foree of the institution has been effective in its 
efforts, collectively and individually, to promote the general 
welfare and advancement of the children. Many of the workers 
are young people who have been beneficiaries of the institution’s 
training ; young people who, as pupils, have been educated and 
made useful in the work they are now performing. 
During the year we have accomplished much in the way of 
repairs, and have made some improvements for the benefits of 
our school work. We have done a good deal of painting; the 
old wornout floors have been relaid ; the down pipes and gutter- 
ing over the entire institution have been put in good condition; 
electrical work has been introduced; a small cold storage and 
an ice plant have been installed. These improvements are of 
great value to us financially, and they also, in connection with 
the machine shop, form a basis of special educational lines for 
the children. Very respectfully, 
W. C. Kizvineron, 
Superintendent.

TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Nasuvittz, TEnn., June 30, 1908. - 
Hon. RB. L. Jones, Superintendent of Public Instruction: ” 
-: . Dear Sm—It becomes my pleasant task.to furnish a report 
“ot the work of the school for the two years ending June 3, 1908. 
. On the whole the period has been one of steady progress without 
“much to mar the even current of events. 
The total enrollment for the term ending June 6, 1907, was 
. 206, 114 girls and 92 boys. Three returned to their homes with - 
sight so improved that they were able to enter the ordinary 
- school, and ten were called home on account of sickness in their 
: families. 
"Total enreliment for the session ending June 3, 1908, was 
232, 181 girls and 101 boys. Eight were sent home with suf- 
ficient vision to attend the public schools and a number went 
- home on aceount of sickness and death in their families. 
The health of the school has been, on the whole, fairly -good. 
*. There are always a number of minor ailments, colds, coughs and 
. the like, but seldom anything more serious. 
This school is graded, comprising twelve grades, and divided . 
into the Primary, Grammar and High School Departments. 
The Primary Department consists of the first and the second 
. ~ grades; the Grammar School begins with the third and includes- 
"the eighth grade, and the High School consists of the remaining 
. grades. The following is the curriculum: 
Reading, spelling, grammar, composition and rhetoric, 
American literature, English literature, geography, History of 
. Tennessee, History of the United States, Myers’ General His- 
tory, arithmetic, algebra, plane. and solid geometry; trigonom- 
etry; physies, psychclogy, civil government and Latin. 
- Upon completion of the eighth grade Grammar School | cer- 
'. tificates aré presented, ‘and diplomas are conferred upon the 
completion of the full course. / : 
The progress in the Primary Department was all that could 
- be desired. The interest of the pupils was never allowed to flag 
‘nor grow cold. The first step in the path of knowledge must
-P-A-G-E-662
—596— . 
be guided with the greatest care, for a misconception of the 
work of training the little minds just beginning to think and 
to wonder would be a serious mistake, requiring years to correct. 
The Grammar and High School Departments continue to 
advance, many of the pupils making rapid strides upon the 
steep and rugged road that leads to the goal of their hope and 
the fulfillment of their highest aspirations. 
Stated examinations were held with satisfactory results. The 
honor line was reached by a larger per cent than usual and the 
eustomary promotions made.- Three have graduated from the 
High School Department, two received Grammar School certifi- 
cates and four were given medals for proficiency in music. 
The Department of Music, justly considered a most valuable 
and important. branch in the education of the blind in prepar- 
ing them to become skilled in an art in which so many of the 
blind excel and in which they so successfully compete with the 
seeing, has maintained its usual standard of efficiency. 
. Physical culture has no -need of arguments to maintain its 
place in any ‘educational institution, and that it is especially 
needful for the blind, is obvious. The blind child is barred 
from many of the activities. of work and play which give ex- 
ercise, hence they come to us. weak, awkward and poorly de- 
veloped, physically and mentally. They are timid and move 
with slow, hesitating step. But the training and exercise given 
in our gymnasium correct this in a great. measure, giving them 
strength and self-confidence. 
Expression is also a very valuable branch in our work. Pu- 
pils are arranged in classes according to their grade. While 
“ many never become good speakers all are benefited by exercises 
in’ breathing and articulation. Gold medals were offered as 
_ prizes to the best ceclaimers among the boys, and the best 
~.. readers of the girls. 
    In the girls’ work department sewing by hand and machine 
and-cutting. and fitting dressés aré taught. Dresses, underwear, 
~ ete., and the bed: and table linen of the school are made by the 
girls, and they are given thorough training and practice in this 
.- work. Bead, erocheting and fancy work have been greatly im- 
. proved in design and workmanship. 
The boys have made good progress in their work department. 
“.. About-the same number of brooms, mops, mattresses and ham-
-P-A-G-E-663
—59T— 
   : have been made as in former. years, and a large number 
of chairs have been caned. At least 70 per cent of the blind 
must earn their bread by the work of their hands. Every child 
--who enters school is required to learn one or more of the em- 
ments taught that they may be able to earn a living and 
secure independence and maintain self respect. A number 
"of our graduates are salesmen for piano hous es, mercantile 
agents, real estate agents, merchants, piano tuners, one a Doctor 
“ eopathy, teachers, ministers of the gospel, and others are 
“engaged in making brooms and mattresses,and caning chairs. 
‘he system of instruction employed by the foremost schools 
+ for the blind is simply that used by the best grammar and high 
--schools for the seeing. Text-books, as far as possible, are the 
, but, of course, our appliances are adapted to touch.. 
We are striving for higher scholarship ‘and for the develop- 
, of moral and noble character. We are among those who 
eontend that the higher and broader the education given ‘the 
ind the greater will be their chance for success. Let them be 
, not only only in the branches and crafts which lie in 
domain of touch, but in every sphere of thought penetrated 
by, the intellect of man. Respectfully submitted,

TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Hon. kh. L. Jones, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Sir—I beg to submit, in behalf of the Tennessee Deaf and 
Dumb School, the following report for the closing biennial term: 
This school consists of two separate departments—white and 
colored. The departnient for white pupils is situated within the 
corporation of Knoxville, upon a tract of eight acres, upon which 
the school was located in 1846, the year following its establish- 
ment in rented premises in another part of the town. Here there 
is a large, well equipped modern plant, with sewerage, water, 
steam heat, gas, electric lights, power, ete., capable of comfort- 
ably aceommodating 232 pupils, which is the number now in at- 
tendance. , 
The colored department is located on a tract of twenty-seven 
acres, two miles east of Knoxville, with accommodation for 
thirty-five pupils. The present attendance of the colored de- 
partment is 28 pupils. 
The Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School is maintained by the 
State through legislative appropriations for the education of all’ 
those children of the commonwealth who are mentally and phys- 
ieally capable of being educated, and who are debarred by deaf- 
ness from receiving an education in the public schools of their 
respective communities. 
. Special methods by special teachers are required to meet the 
special needs of the deaf, the classes being necessarily small. 
The great obstacle te the education of the deaf ¢hild is his en- 
. tire lack of language. The open way, possessed by every normal 
child before he reaches school age—the knowledge of his mother 
tongue—by which he has access to the world and by which the 
world has access to him, is a closed way to the deaf child—dark 
and high walled. 
To give him, then, this means of communication, this way of 
light, is at once the great difficulty and the great necessity in his 
education, calling for a large expenditure of the time and labor 
of his school days. In connection with giving him a working 
knowledge of language the deaf pupil is given a good knowledge
-P-A-G-E-665
  —599— 
of the.common schocl branches—arithmetic, geography, history, 
grammar, ete. Instruction in art and in scientific dressmaking 
was introduced last year with most satisfactory results. In- 
dustrial training is.an important feature of daily work. Car- 
> pentry, shoemaking, printing and farm work for the boys, and 
the various forms of woman’s work for the girls are taught. 
Healthful exercise and proper play are an important part of 
the school life. A well equipped gymnasium is used daily to 
great advantage. For the past two years the health of the 
school has*been remarkably good, no death having occurred dur- 
ing that time, and very little serious sickness. 
This school continues to follow what is known among the 
educators of the deaf as the combined system, wherein those 
children who promise best results therefrom are taught by the 
_ oral method. Children so taught learn to speak through sight— 
not as in the case of the normal child, by hearing—and they 
learn to understand the speech of others by reading the lips. 
Other pupils are taught by manual. methods, the chief means of 
instruction being writing and the manual alphabet, known as 
the one hand alphabet, which is the easiest and most satisfactory 
method of communication between the deaf and hearing people, 
who know this alphabet, of which I have any knowledge. 
I may say here that your kind offer to incorporate in your 
report as State Superintendent of Public Instruction any sug- 
gestion tending toward the betterment of this institution, sug- 
gests to me that the influence of your word to the teachers of the 
State that the learning of the manual alphabet used by the deaf 
would be a wise thing, a kind thing to do; would lead many 
teachers to learn what would put them in ready communication 
with all the educated deaf, and would beget an interest in them 
which would exert a wide influence for-the benefit of the deaf 
and this school. I think that the contracts of some of the pub- 
‘lishers of uniform State text-hooks provide for the insertion of 
the manual alphabet in one of the series. This alphabet is easily 
learned, especially when we notice, in most instances, the simi- 
_ larity in appearance of the letter made on the hand to the writ- 
ten character. A general knowledge of this alphabet among 
hearing people would make it a very helpful means of silent 
communication in the sick room, in noisy places and elsewhere. 
Its use by hearing children would have all the advantage of 
writing in securing accuracy in spelling, with much greater

speed. While you may not consider this suggestion a practical 
one for your report, there is another to which I beg to call yout 
attention : 
While the management of the school uses every available 
means to get into communication with all the deaf children in 
the State, with a view of offering them the benefits of this school, 
there are always many of whom we have no knowledge, whose 
friends know nothitig of the school. During the past two years 
we have received, through the kind intervention of those who 
had chanced to learn of such persons, quite a number of totally 
ignorant pupils, more than 14 years of age, of whom we had 
had no previous knowledge. These children often attend the 
public schools of their neighborhood with their hearing relatives 
and friends, or are known to the public school teachers through — 
their acquaintance with the people about them. Happily the - 
presence of the publie school teacher is so general in Tennessee 
today that it is entirely possible for this school to be put in com- 
munication with practically every uneducated deaf child in the 
State throngh these teachers. Your suggestion that all teachers 
make it a point to note such information and report it to this 
school. promptly, and to report to the school for the blind at. 
Nashville concerning all blind children, will, I am sure, do much 
good in this line and will be gratefully appreciated. 
During the period under consideration eighty-four of the 
counties of the State have sent pupils to this school, aggregating 
350 pupils, 35 of whom were négroes and 315 whites.

To County Superintendents: : 
I desire to call your attention, and through you the atten- 
tion of your people, to the advantages offered in the short course 
in agriculture by the University of Tennessee. This course be- 
gins January 4 and continues till March. Tennessee is an agri- 
cultural State and if we ever realize our greatest possibilities 
we must educate our people in the science of agriculture. I can 
conceive of no better way by which you can serve your people 
than to call the attention of the sons of farmers to the advantages 
offered by the Department of Agriculture, and also to encourage 
the teachers to take this course with a view to teaching it in the 
rural schools of the State. The farmers are demanding a modi- 
fication of the course of study that will more nearly meet the 
conditions of modern life. It devolves upon the school people 
to bring about this adjustment of the course of study. With 
80 per cent of our people living in rural communities it requires 
“no argument to convince one who thinks that the school of the 
future will not be blind to the subject of agriculture. If our 
County Superintendents could arrange to attend a portion of 
the time during this short. course it would give them a better 
point of view on the subject and greatly enhance their value as 
leaders in developing a system of schools that will have the 
‘power to enrich rural life. Very truly yours,

: ~ oF Pusiic ScHoot TwacHerRs By THE County SuPrR- 
INTENDENTS OF Pusuic InstRucTION. 
Section 7, subsection 10, of the Acts of 1873 makes it the duty 
. of the State Superintendent ‘‘to prescribe the mode of examining 
and licensing school teachers and their necessary qualifications.’’ 
Section 9, subsection 6, makes it the duty of the County Su- 
perintendent ‘‘to observe such directions and regulations as the — 
‘State Superintendent of Schools may from time to time pre- 
seribe.’’ 
There shall be issued three classes of certificates, known as 
First Grade, Second Grade and Third Grade certificates. Grad- 
uates of the Peabody College and persons holding Roll of Honor 
certificates shall be exempt from examination. All applicants 
, making an average of 85 per cent, and not falling below 60 in 
any one subject in all the branches required to be taught in the 
public school course, are entitled to receive a First Grade cer- 
tificate. All applicants. making an average of not less than 70 
on all the public school branches required to be taught in the 
public schools shall be entitled to receive a Second Grade cer- 
tificate. All applicants making an average of at least 85 per 
cent and not falling below 60 in any one branch required to be > 
taught in the primary public schools of the State are entitled to 
receive a Third Grade or Primary certificate. 
The Public School Officers’ Association, at its annual meeting 
in January, 1906, authorized the State Superintendent to ap- 
point a committee to organize and select a course of study for the 
State Teachers’ Reading Cirele. The State Superintendent ap-. 
* pointed a committee, which organized and selected a course of 
study for the scholastic year 1906-7. This committee selected 
the following eourse: 
For THE Primary TEACHERS— 
The Little Schoolmistress, by C. L. Hayes. 
Hodge’s Nature Study and Life. 
White’s School Management.
-P-A-G-E-733
—661—_ 
For THE Seconpary TEACHERS— 
Shaffer’s Thinking and Learning to Think. 
Baldwin’s School Management. 
: Applicants for a license to teach in the schools of Tennessee 
will be required to take an examination on the subjects offered 
in the Reading Cirele Course. This examination on the Read- 
ing Circle matter will exempt applicants from examination 
on Theory and Practice. We find in many counties the 
teachers have organized themselves into a Reading Circle and 
have completed the course. In others little or no work has been 
done. This is the first year the Reading Circle has been in op- 
eration and it was not expected that every county in the State 
would become thoroughly organized. In those counties where 
the Reading Circle has not been organized the Superintendents 
aré instructed to give an examination as heretofore required. 
The Reading Circle, however, will be compulsory after this year, 
and all teachers will be required to stand the examination upon 
it before receiving a license to teach. 
All certificates should be dated from July 1, as any certificate 
dated prior to that time would expire on June 30 after the date 
Of its issuance. 
Section 27 provides that ‘‘no teacher of publie schools: shall 
be employed or receive any pay from the public funds unless 
he or she have a certificate of qualification given to him or her _ 
by the County Superintendent for the county within which he 
or she is employed. No such payment shall be allowed, if made, 
and any officer who shall make or sanetion it shall also be subject 
to a penalty of not less than five nor more than fifty dollars.” 
All teachers must have a license before they can enter upon a 
eontract with the County Board of Education. .The County 
- Boards of Education will be elected by the County Courts of 
the State at the July term. Please notify all your teachers of 
‘the necessity of attending the first regular examination so that 
they may be on the eligible list when the County Board meets 
in July to select its teachers. 
-You are requested to hold public examinations on the fol- 
lowing dates and to give no private examinations: 
__ The first, the annual examination, to be held at the close of 
the county institute.
-P-A-G-E-734
—662— 
The second examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in August. 
The third examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in October. : 
The fourth examination to be held on the first Friday and 
Saturday in January. x 
Require all teachers, except those exempt as hereinbefore 
mentioned, to take the examination. The strongest teachers are 
always ready and willing.to take an examination for the moral 
effect that it may have on the weaker who seek to avoid exami- 
nations in every way possible. It is said that we have a large 
number of incompetent teachers in this State. That there are a 
number of such we must admit. The County Superintendent is 
the only one who has the power to eliminate-these from the pro- 
fession. If there are not enough competent. teachers to fill all 
the public school positions, it is no fault of the County Superin- 
tendent, but.if the incompetent are licensed, the responsibility 
lies with him. You have no right to license any person to teach 
seliool who is not ‘‘worthy and well qualified and of the highest 
moral. character and personal worth.’’ Give a fair and reason- 
able examination, have all the teachers take it, and license only 
those who make the grade required by law. If you find that you 
have not enough competent teachers to fill the places in your 
publie schools and you are forced to license those whose equip- 
_ ment is short of what a teacher’s should be, only do so as a case of 
last resort, and notify the teacher thus licensed that he must im-— 
prove his scholarship before asking for another certificate, and 
that: he is receiving his license, not by virtue of his equipment, 
but because he -is the best material that can be had under ex- 
isting conditions. .

Smr—At a recent meeting of the conductors of the State

‘awing System to furnish an instructor free to each of 
: Institutes was accepted on the condition that such in- 
should be subject to the instruction of the conductor. 
athe primary methods the first and second grades should

the primary teacher has prepared her course for two 
was not considered wise to interfere with her plans, even - 
ss work beyond the first and second grades, but let her 
course as she has prepared it. : 
a the department of English, special stress should be 
three things: the interpretation of literature, composi- 
technical grammar. The pieces of literature to be 
md interpreted are to be taken from the adopted texts 
ag. There is no subject in which the rural teacher is 
icient than that of literature. While the interpretation’ 
ons from the Fourth and Fifth Readers may seem very 
et in my opinion reading is more poorly taught than any 
yject, simply because the teacher fails to understand and 
te the literature he is attempting to teach his pupils. 
4, In the subject of Arithmetic the fundamentals should be 
Stressed together with common and decimal fractions and per-

as possible not to break the continuity of the subject taught. ~

North America, including mathematical geography. In fact, the 
whole month’s work might well be spent in teaching North - 
America. 
8. The lectures in pedagogy should be based largely upon 
The Little Schoolmistress and White’s School Management. How- 
ever the instructors are not confined exclusively to these texts. 
They are left free to lecture upon such subjects as they deem 
will be of greatest service to the teachers in attendance. 
9. It will be impossible to teach all the subject matter em- 
braced in the secondary course, consequently it will be better to 
dwell upon such parts of those subjects as the instructors think 
of greatest value. 
For lack of time it was not considered best by the State Su- 
perintendent or the conductors to attempt to prepare a syllabus 
for the present year, but it was the ‘sense of all that a syllabus 
should be prepared by another year. Respectfully, 
R. L. Jonzs,

the State of Tennessee. / 
Section 4 of the above-mentioned act made it the duty of the 
State Board of Education to apportion the sum of $50,000 in 
such manner as to equalize the scholastic terms of the various 
_ publie schools throughout the State, and to make such scholastic 
terms not less than six months, or as near thereto as may be ac-

unless said county shall levy a tax of 214 mills on the dollar of 
assessable property in the county for school purposes in addi-

To County Superintendents of Ténnessee: 
T have often been asked the question who will have the legal 
authority to employ teachers for the ensuing year? I submitted 
the question to Attorney General Cates, and quote below his 
opinion, in ‘which I fully coneur: 
‘*The power of the Board of Directors to make a valid con- 
tract with a teacher for a school term extending beyond the term 
of office of said board was virtually sustained by the Supreme 
Court ‘(Morley v. Power, 5 Lea, 691), but-the result in this case 
and those following it was reached upon the construction of 
statutes which continued in force over the whole period of time 
covered by the. teacher’s contract, and, therefore, nothing more 
was ‘determined than that a Board ef Directors, in office and in 
the discharge of their duties under the Act of 1873, Ch. 25, and 
the acts amendatory thereof, might lawfully employ a teacher 
for a term extending beyond the first day of September of any 
given year, when the term of office of some or all of said board 
might expire. In such case the same statute regulating the 
powers of directors remained in force, and there was neither 
alteration in the school districts, the schools, nor the method of 
selecting teachers. 
’.. (An examination of the Act of 1907, .Ch. 236, entitled, ‘An 
: Act-to improve the publie school system of Tennessee by creating 
_ ‘in each county a County Board of Education and District Ad- 
visory Boards, and prescribing their duties, and abolishing the 
office of District, Directors,’ discloses that it was the intention of 
“the General Assembly not only to abolish the office of District 
Directors, but to provide an entirely new system for the ad- 
ministration of the publie schools in the several counties of the 
o State, - including divisions of counties into school districts, the 
> selection of teachers, and the administration of the public schools 
and-the control of the public school property. 
2e, without’ going into an extended analysis of the 
the Act of 1907, I beg to advise you that I am of 
hat upon the several County Boards of Education, 
e Courity Courts of this State at their July terms,

il devolve the power and duty of selecting and employing 
achers for the different schools as they now exist, or which 
_ eafter may be created in the school districts into which the 
several counties of this State will be divided on the first Monday . 
in July, 1907, as provided in said act. . 
. = Section 13 of the act creating a County Board of Edueation 
and District Advisory Boards provides that there shall be a

To the Members of the County Courts of Tennessee: 
The recent Legislature passed a Ineasure entitled : 
‘An Act to be etitled An Act to improve the public school 
_system of Tennessee by creating in each. county a County Board 
of Education and District Advisory Boards, and prescribing 
: their duties and abolishing the office of District Directors.”’ 
Section 1 of this Act provides ‘‘That in each county of the 
_ State of Tennessee the office of District Directors shall be abol- 
ished, and that the schools shall be under the management and 
control of a County Board of Education and a Distriet Board 
of Advisors, hereinafter to be provided for.”’ 
Section 2 provides ‘‘That the County Court in each county 
of the State shall, at its session to be held the first Monday in 
July, 1907, divide the county into five school districts, each rep- 
resenting as nearly as practicable equal area of territory or the - 
same number of inhabitants; Provided, that each of these school 
districts shall be composed of whole civil districts; and, pro- 
vided further, that in counties having fewer than five civil dis- 
tricts, each civil district shall constitute a school district, and a ~ 
member of the said Board of Education be elected from each of 
the said districts, and the remaining member or. members be 
elected from the county at large.’’ 
Section 3 provides ‘‘That one member from each of said 
-school districts, and the other.members aforesaid from the ecunty 
at large, shall constitute said County Board of Education; pro- 
vided, the County Superintendent shall be Seeretdry of the 
County Board of Education.”’ 
Section 4- provides ‘‘That the County Court in the several 
counties of the State, at its July term, shall elect a member of -
-P-A-G-E-742
—670— 
the County Board of Education from each of the school districts / 
above mentioned; or where there be fewer than five districts, ' 
the necessary number, as provided for from the county at large, 
which County Board of Education shall qualify and organize 
within ten days after their election by electing one of their num- 
ber Chairman; provided furthed, That the members of the 
County Board of Education thus elected shall serve until Sep- 
tember 1, 1908, and that on the first Thursday of August, 1908, 
and biennially thereafter, each member of the County Board of 
Education shall be elected by the qualified voters of the district, 
above provided for, and in counties with fewer than five dis- 
tricts the necessary number from the county at large, and the 
term of office-of members thus elected shall begin on the first 
day of September next after said election, and their tenure of 
office shall be two years, or until their successors in office are 
duly elected and qualified.’’ 
Section 5 provides ‘‘That any person shall be eligible to the 
office of member of the County Board of Education who is qual- 
ified by at least a primary education, such as the primary publie 
achool course, to perform the duties required, and who is a resi- 
dent of the district and a qualified voter therein. If he shall 
cease to be a resident thereof, his office shall be deemed vacant.’’ 
Section 9 provides ‘‘That the County Superintendent, as ex 
officio Seeretary of the County Board of Education, be required 
to give bond, to be approved by the Chairman of the County 
. Court, to the amount of $500, for the faithful discharge of his 
  duties. ’” 
Under the provisions of this Act, the office of District Diree- 
tor is abolished July 1, 1907, and it devolves upon the County 
Court at its July term— 
. First—To divide the county into five school districts, in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of the Act. 
Second—To elect a County Board of Education of five mem- 
“pers, who shall be charged. with the management of the county 
‘gehools, and to perform in general the functions heretofore ex- 
ereised by the District Board of Directors. 
~~ Seetion 5 the qualifications for membership on

.: a live interest in school work and a discriminating judgment that 
“3 will-enable them to measure the. relative value of teachers. The 
success of this measure depends largely upon the character of the 
ard entrusted with the enforcement of the law. ‘This law pro- 
luces a revolution in school administration and renders it pos-°- 
ible to accomplish more within a few years for the advance-- - 
ment of education than was possible to accomplish under the old 
gime of district directors in a generation.’ On the other hand, 
boards with selfish or sinister motives ‘are elected, with the .~ 
creased and centralized power granted them, they should make 
e schools means whereby selfish and sinister ends are reached, 
hey would do more harm to the cause ‘of education than could 
¢ repaired in a lifetime. . 
This school measure has the endorsement of all- the leading 
educators of the State, and carries with it-the authority:to umfy 
and systematize the schools of the county. Under the old system. . 
it frequently happened that the schools of one district: would 
ave a three months’ term and those of another dé nine months” 
rm, and yet both schools had the same course of study and 
ere attempting to do the same work. We believe that all the 
_ people of the county should -eontribute equally to the support 
f. the schools and all should share equally in the benefits de- 
rived therefrom. 
~ As a rule, it is safe not to elect men to school positions who:. 
re overzealous in seeking them, because the small remuneration / 
which this Act provides (see Section 12, ‘That each member of. 
the County Board of Education shall receive not less than one: 
ollar and fifty cents per day, nor more than three dollars: 
day, as determined by the County Court, for not more than 
thirty days in the year’’) is not sufficient inducement from a 
monetary standpoint to secure suitable talent for organizing and. 
erating a'system of schools. The class of office seekers who are 
“hunting for a small salary should be studiously avoided... 
-. This Act greatly increases the work of the County Sup

“the County Chairman, to the amount of $500, for the faithful

“body will see fit to pay him a salary commensurate with the in- 
creased services required of him, A County Superintendent 
‘should be an educational leader and should devote his entire 
time to the discharge of his duties, and should be paid in keeping 
with the high qualifications demanded. It is poor economy to 
secure an incompetent leader in any enterprise, even if his . 
“services could be had for nothing. 
This law is not an experiment. It has been tried in Mont- 
gemery County for four years, and under its operation the school 
terms of the county have been increased from 184 to 160 days” 
_ without inereasing the rate of taxation or diminishing teachers’ 
*-salaries. Lauderdale County also has had in successful operation 
the county board system for the past two years. Neither of 
these counties could be induced, under any consideration, after 
“having tried the county board system, to return to the old sys- 
     
    ;tem of district directors. This law applies to every county in 
“th State except Montgomery, Lauderdale, Tipton and Davidson, 
hich ¢ are operating under special County Board laws, and Obion,

aching offers tod great an inducement to 
sufficient inducement to one of successful 
o the profession. The trouble lies in the
-P-A-G-E-750
676 y 
_ fact that the young teacher without normal training or expe- 
- rience is often hired at precisely the same salary that is paid the 
more experienced and better qualified teacher. I would suggest 
that you fix a minimum salary for beginners possessing certain 
. qualifications, and if they are successful, increase their salary 
from year to year until they reach the maximum limit your 
county can afford to pay. All beginners will not be equally well 
equipped. Some will hold first grade, some second grade and 
somé third grade certificates. All this will have to be taken into 
consideration in fixing the minimum salary. 
The teachers of publie schools, as a rule, are not as well paid 
as they should be. . There are two ways, however, of increasing 
the teacher’s yearly salary. One is to increase the length of the 
school term, and the other is to increase his monthly salary. It 
might be well to consider both ways. 
: Subsection 3, Section 10, in defining the duties of the County 
Board of Education, states it as the duty of said board ‘‘to run 
all public school in the county as nearly as practicable the same 
Jength of time.’’ This does not mean that at one fell stroke you 
are to reduce all the schools to a common level. To illustrate, if 
one community, by economy and wise management, has so con-~ 
ducted its affairs that they now have a good school building, and 
are running a nine months’ school, and another community, by 
mismanagement and extravagance, has only a three months’ 
school, it would neither be practicable nor wise to undertake to 
give at once a nine months’ term to a community which had 
been accustomed to cnly three. They would not support a school 
perhaps for longer than five months the first year, seven the 
second and nine the-third. It should be your purpose to bring 
every school up to a high state of efficiency with little if any 
‘ injury to the good schools already in. operation in your county. 
If wise management will give a good school to one commu- 
nity, other things being equal, the same character of management 
- Will give a good school to every community. Hence, in one or 
two years every school in your county may be running the same ~ 
number of days with a uniform course of study, and that without 
impairing the efficiency of your present well established schools. 
"" Subsection 4, Section 10, empowers your board ‘‘to locate 
schools where deemed most convenient, having due regard for 
lessening the number in order to improve the efficiency of the 
. county system of education. ”

  We have, in this State, 6,874 county schools, covering an area 
-of 42,000 square miles. This gives a school to every six square 
‘miles, This is entirely too many schools. In level sections it is 
--dlaimed ‘that one school is sufficient to every sixteen square 
- miles, but owing to the fact that Tennessee is somewhat moun- 
“tainous, and is crossed by a large number of creeks and rivers, it 
“might be necessary to have a school for every ten square miles. 
+ Phat would give us 4,200 schools against, 6,874 at present. 
--.- In the consolidation of the small, inefficient schools lies your 
. greatest opportunity for promoting the cause of education in 
“your county. ‘The establishment of too many schools has done 
“Iaore to retard the progress of education in some communities 
“than can be repaired in a lifetime, yet in the matter of consoli- 
dation you will have to use much tact and wisdom. No soldier 
~~ on. the field of battle ever fought-more bravely for his country 
- than the average patron will fight for.the retention of his school — 
-.house. Experience has shown that however desirable the con- 
 solidation may be, if it means a lawsuit or the permanent di- 
yision of the community, it is better to defer action until a ma- 
~jority of the people themselves will agree to the change. You 
- -eannot give people a better thing than they want, yet when you 
show them the advantages of uniting two or three weak schools 
~ into one good school, well equipped and well taught, it is only 
a “question of a very short time until you can work up a senti- - 
“ment favorable to consolidation. Like other changes, this can 
“only be brought about by educating tt the people to see the merit 
of your cause. 
The County Board law is not an experiment. It has been 
tried and worked well in other States, and we have an example of 
its workings in our own State. It has been in operation in Mont- 
gomery County the past four years, and during the first year of 
__-its operation, without increasing the tax rate or diminishing the 
‘salary of a single teacher, the school term of the county was in- 
” ereased from 134 to 160 days. It is hoped that every county in 
- the State will be able to make as good a showing. 
Trusting that you will use your best efforts in putting this 
law into successful operation, I remain, :

SUGGESTIONS 
To County SUPERINTENDENTS RELATIVE TO 
Maxine ANNUAL Reports. - 
-. State or TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT op Pugiic Instruction. 
NASHVILLE. - 
To County Superintendents; . 
T desixe to call your attention to the necessity of promptly 
making your report to this office. Heretofore it has been impos- 
sible to obtain with any degree of accuracy all the data called
-P-A-G-E-755
—681— 
for in the annual report of the County Superintendent. This 
has:been due to the fact that under the operation of the district 
director system the County Superintendent had very largely to 
‘rely upon his school boards for the information from which to 
- taake his report to this department. But. under the operations 
of the County Board law every County Superintendent has, or 
should have, in his office all the information asked for on the 
* blank furnished by this department, on which the annual report 
is to be made. Please exercise the utmost pains in making your 
“report accurate and see that every table balances properly. 
In counties having cities-that operate an independent system 
of schools the Superintendent should obtain a report from the 
City: Superintendent of all information relative to the city 
schools and include it in the annual report of the County Su- 
_perintendent to this office. 
‘In order to secure uniformity in making all reports, please 
read with care all suggestions on the following tables taken from ~ 
Form A: 
Taste 1. Scholastic Population —You will see under this 
table that you are expected to keep the population of the county 
and the city separate. To illustrate: Take 1—White male. 
Suppose the population in the county is 2,500, city 1,500; the 
total is obtained by adding county and city, making 4,000 for 
right hand column. Item 2 is disposed of the same way. Item 
8, total white, is obtsined by adding 1 and 2 under proper head- 
, ing. Items 4 and 5 for colored are treated as 1 and 2,-and 6 is 
‘ treated as 3. Item 7, grand total, is obtained by adding 8 and 6. 
“If your report is correct, the total will be equal to the sum of 
_all the items. Tables 2, 3 and 4 are made out exactly in the same 
manner as table 1, each table having the same number of items. 
-. ‘Taprz 5—Many errors have been detected in this table. The 
' total number enrolled by grades in county and city, as shown 
‘by table No. 5, if correct, will tally exactly with enrollment as 
shown in table 3. For instance, if the enrollment in the eleven 
grades as shown in this table be 8,500, and the enrollment as 
shown by table 3 be 9,000, it would clearly show that there had 
been an error made in one or the other tables, for every pupil 
in school should be in some grade, and the total number of pu- 
pils in all the grades, as shown by table 5, should equal the total 
number enrolled as shown in table 3.
-P-A-G-E-756
  —682— 
* Tables 6, 7, 8,.9 need no explanation. 
~ Taste 10—86, 87, 88 are questions which the Superintend- 
: ents can best answer by close inspection when visiting schools. 
Taste 11. Miscellaneous—Some of the items called for un- 
dex this table are the most valuable to the. general public of all 
information asked. There has been-no tniformity in the differ- 
‘ent counties in reporting’on somé of the items. Ninety-two em- 
braces the total number of days taught during the year by all 
  -, the teachers. For instance,.one school continues 60 days and 
        
  another school with five teachers continues 120 days. Since each 
of the five teachers 1aught 120 days, the total number of days’ 
taught in that school is 600, and the total number of days taught 
in the two schools is 660. This item ean only be correctly re- 
ported by adding the number of days each teacher taught dur- 
ing the scholastic year in the county. Remember that all teach- 
ers and the number of days taught are to be taken into consid- 
eration and not the number of schools. 
93. The total tnumber of days taught during the year at all 
schools is intended as’a’ check on 92, and will exactly agree in 
numiber if both’ itenis are correct. Multiply the number of days 
taught. at each ‘school by the number of teachers employed in 
: each school, and the sum of all the preducts will be the total 
number of days taught at all the schools. This should exactly 
equal the total number of days taught during the year by all 
‘teachers. 
94 Average number of days. taught during the year by each 
teacher is ascertained by dividing the total number of days’ 
taught. during the year by all teachers by the number of teachers 
employed. This dces'not mean that if a teacher is employed to 
werk a month and resigns and another teacher is employed to 
take his place and teaches the'remaining portion of the term 
that you are to consider two teachers. While two different per-. 
sons have been employed, there has only been one teacher in 
“service. Please bear this in mind in reporting on these items. 
Ninety-five is intended as a check on 94, and bears the same 
lation to it, that 93 bears to. 92. 
: 96. Average cost of tuition per pupil per scholastie month 
is an item on which there has been no uniform report. To divide 
je annual expenditure, including teachers’ salaries and current 
spenses, by” the number of pupils belonging to the school as 
 
-P-A-G-E-757
—683— 
school register, would: give approximately the 
pupil per scholastic month. However, you 
age number of pupils belonging reported to 
rers’ abstract. Perhaps the nearest approach 
answering this item is to add the total enroll- - 
as shown in table 3 to the total average daily 
pupils as shown in table 4. Divide the sum 
ive approximately the number belonging, and 
payroll, including teachers’ salaries and cur- 
ases, by this approximate average number be- 
lis is not absolutely correct, it is the closest, 
n possibly make, and by following it we will 
ort on this item. Items 98, 99, 100 need no : 
e exercise great care in securing correct report

nues derived from property tax. 
142. Polls—The state pol] tax is $1. .The county may levy 
as much as $1. 
143. Privileges and Other Taxable Sources—Investigate and 
see that the schools get all the privilege tax that is due them. 
144, All other Sources—There will be no receipts under 
this head in many counties. However, there are a few counties 
_ that have school lands, and sometimes school property is sold 
and the money turned into the publie school fund. Items like 
this would go under this heading. ,

and Balance on Hand. . 
148. Teachers’ Salaries—The County Superintendent’s 
record book will show amount spent in county schools. The City 
Superintendent’s record book will show amount spent in city. 
schools. The balance on hand at the beginning of the school 
year July 1, 1907, should be the same as the balance on hand at 
elese of fiscal year ending June 30 of same year, same as the 
balance on hand at close of fiseal year ending June 30. Exercise 
the greatest care in getting tables 15 and 16 to balance properly. 
In making table 11 and answering 92, 93, 94 and 95, holidays 
for which teachers receive pay should be included, otherwise 
your. financial table will be out of balance. Multiply the length 
of school term as shown by 95 by the number of teachers em- 
ployed as shown, in table.8, iter 76, and this will give the ex- 
pendituré for teachers’ salaries, as shown in table 16, item 148.

; Superintendents and Members of Boards of Education: 
A few weeks ago a number of educators, newspaper men, and 
siness men met in the city of Nashville for the purpose of dis- 
ussing school conditions in Tennessee and how to improve them. 
s the outgrowth of this meeting, an organization known as the - 
jeoperative Education Association’’ was effected and the fol- 
ing officers were elected: 
Hon. R. M. Barton, President; Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, Mr. O: 
Barton and Mr. H. W. Buttorff, Vice Presidents; Supt. P. L. 
arned, Secretary.

ity ; Bishop Thomas F. Gailor, Memphis; Hon. R. M. Barton, 
‘on. John A. Patten, Chattanooga; Supt. R. L. Jones. 
- Following are the principles for which this association stands: 
: “The purpose of this organization shall be to promote the ed- 
cational interests of Tennessee— 
1. By arousing and directing public sentiment in favor of 
better schools of all grades and more liberal support of same. . 
“2. By promoting the establishment of a good system of 
punty high schools. 
“8. By encouraging more local support for the maintenance 
£ elementary, secondary and high schools, and to enlist the in- 
ast of all the people of the State in the great movement for 
better education of the children. : , 
4. By creating sentiment and devising plans for securing 
er attendance on the public schools. 
5. By better training of teachers for all grades of the public 
ools, and more liberal compensation for teachers and super- 
tendents. 
6. By urging the adjustment of the courses of study to meet 
ie demands of modern life.- 
7. By ereating sentiment for reasonable consolidations of 
iblic schools. :

  Be By the establishment and maintenance of school libraries. 
: 9. By the'improvement and beautifying of school houses and 
< grounds, and by the betterment of equipment. :    
If you endorse the above principles, we ask you most earnestly 
_to go to work and organize an association in each school within 
. the limits of your jurisdiction. Much has been done for the im- 
provement of the'schools in our State, but to one who has studied 
‘the conditions with care it-is. apparent that much remains yet 
to be done. Other iines of endeavor are offering so much larger 
- reward to talent than the teaching profession that we are losing . 
to the business world each year more talent than we are acquiring 
in the teaching ranks. This means that the problem of securing: 
' competent teachers is one of the gravest with which we have to 
deal. In a large number. of counties the superintendents report 
a shortage of competent teachers, and’ they have been forced, in 
order to have-the schools taught, to licénse those whose qualifi- 
cations are sk rt of the legal requirements. Our school build- 
ings, furniture‘and equipment are far from what they should be, 
“and the houses and grounds are very poorly cared for. Similar 
associations have done a very great work in Virginia, Maine and 
a number of other States, and we hope it will be equally effec- 
tive in Tennessee. 
We are sending you, under separate eover, copies of the Con- ” 
stitution, prepared by the Executive Committee. The committee 
*. “recommends two organizations—one for. adults, the other for 
children. : 
It is hoped: that all the counties will effect an organization 
in every school by January 1, 1908. If all the school officials 
will do their whole duty this can be accomplished. 
Sincerely yours,

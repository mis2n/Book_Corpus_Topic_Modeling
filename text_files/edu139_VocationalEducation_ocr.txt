PREFACE 
Tue following chapters were outlined in 1905, while I 
was teaching history and social science in the State Normal 
School of Valley City, North Dakota. The circumstances 
occasioning their development may be of interest. Inci- 
dental to the work of instruction in history methods, the 
task of outlining a series of talks on the subject was under- 
taken. In deliberating on the aim of history study it was 
discovered that this could be settled only when the object 
of education had been determined. 
During the time I was seeking to formulate the end of 
education, having in mind no educational preconceptions 
sufficiently ingrained to act as a limitation to free organize 
tion of thoughts about the matter of training, and being 
accustomed to view individuals as products and phases of 
the age-long historic process, the objective grounds of 
education were naturally evolved. 
Such principles as this volume espouses were then de- 
veloped. Some reorganization and addition of matter have 
since been made. While the form which the material 
assumes is not entirely satisfactory to me, I feel justified 
in issuing the work now. During the past two years it 
has been delivered as a regular course of lectures to the 
students in.the College of Education in the University of 
North Dakota, and has elicited their hearty response and 
approval. 
The essential ideas of this volume have been presented in

talks before educational meetings, from time to time, and 
have been favorably received, .The manuscript is known 
to the chairman and other members of the Committee of 
Seven, appointed by the State Educational Association of 
North Dakota. It has their approval, and they have 
urged its publication. For ‘hese reasons, and because 
the time is ripe for such a work, I venture to place it before 
the public, trusting that the worth may exceed the defects. 
The field of education contemplated is that of the elemen- 
tary public schools. While the principles of social adjust- 
ment might very well govern all grades of educational 
effort, and while sometimes, in the course of discussing some 
phase of the general subject of training, the higher grades 
have been touched on, it must be borne in mind that only the 
schools below the secondary schools are explicitly involved.

INTRODUCTION 
Ir is clear. that enlightened public opinion is making new 
demands upon the teaching profession, and that the lead- 
ing spirits in this profession are eagerly looking for the 
best way. There is too much waste of life of child and 
youth; the real interests of pupils are not discovered, or 
they are trampled upon; and the school which might be 
the paradise of childhood is often its purgatory. 
The writer of these chapters has endeavored to discover 
the requirements of the world in which we live and has 
called upon his fellow teachers to respond to the call. He 
makes very much of vocational education; possibly he has 
laid relatively too much emphasis on this factor, but he 
has at least forced recognition of the moral necessity of 
earning an honest dollar. To the gleanings from wide 
reading the author has added some results of his own 
experiments. As he has written carefully a direct study of 
an industrial community in a great city and has also become 
acquainted with the moral situation in several sections of 
the United States, he has some peculiar qualifications for 
his enterprise. A person well trained in psychology and 
educational science may prepare an excellent work on the

fundamental principles of teaching, but one must live widely 
also among the people of the country to understand their 
particular problems. 
There are many propositions in these chapters which 
cannot be altogether approved without further and critical 
consideration; but the survey is broad, the issues are liv- 
ing, and the contact with reality is beyond question.

THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
CHAPTER I. THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 
AND CONCEPT 
I, THE MOVEMENT FOR SOCIALIZATION 
Recognition of the need of educational transformation.— 
One of the most impressive and unmistakable of the move- 
ments which are taking place in America, and which mark 
the age as a critical one, is that of educational transforma- 
tion. While it is true that we are prone to behold things 
which our previous experience prepares and commands us to 
see, and while we may be somewhat subject to exaggeration, 
even to illusions at times, on this account, yet those who 
know what is happening in educational channels will hardly 
be able to characterize as an illusion or an exaggeration the 
assertion that there is on foot an educational movement 
almost amounting to a revolution. 
The facts indicating the volume and profundity of the 
movement are eloquent witness to the truth of the state- 
ment. The files of the United States Educational Reports, 
those of the proceedings of the National Education Asso- 
ciation, those of the various educational and other periodi- 
cals, the daily press, practical experiments conducted by 
teachers’ training institutions, books on education, and the 
economic and industrial spirit of the age, —all alike testify 
to and voice the existence of the demand for transformation.

  2 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
Current writings bearing on the general subjects of waste 
in education, and on the existence of useless material con- 
tained in our school curricula, are multitudinous, and ex- 
press one of the chief phases of educational thought. 
Organized educational forces are moving in the direction 
of making our school system more practical. Among the 
eastern states, Massachusetts and Connecticut have formu- 
lated legislation looking toward putting vocational training 
into the public school system. New York has legalized in- 
dustrial education throughout the commonwealth. Farther 
west, the State Educational Association and the legislature 
of Illinois are codperating in providing funds to send a com- 
mission abroad to study industrial education, looking toward 
working it into the schools of Illinois. Still farther west, 
in North Dakota, the State Teachers’ Association devoted 
almost the entire annual session of 1908 to the consideration 
of vocational education, and appointed a Committee of Seven 
to work on the problem, how to reconstruct the schools of the 
state on more practical lines. The committee presented its 
report, outlining and recommending a vocational course of 
study for the rural schools of the state, to the Association 
of 1909. Its report was adopted and recommended to the 
State Department of Public Instruction. Hardly a teachers’ 
meeting occurs nowadays which does not struggle over the 
problem of practical education. Special national industrial 
education congresses have been called into existence for its 
consideration. 
This agitation for reform is not in the nature of a “fad.” 
It is of too fundamental a character. There are those who 
have dubbed this movement for practical education a fad, 
insisting that it will pass like others of the “fads and frills”
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 3 
which have got into the schools through agitation and the 
efforts of “reformers.” But these people as little perceive 
the depth and portent of the matter as do those who refer 
to present political and economic reforms as phases of 
popular emotionalism. In the case of these social reforms, 
including the educational movement, the philosophy of 
the fundamental interests and organizations of society is 
involved; their very purpose and methods are in question; 
and the reformers see this too profoundly to be pacified 
into quiescence with a few superficial concessions. It is 
immaterial to the lasting welfare of humanity whether fads 
come in or get out of the schools; but the question of voca- 
tional education involves its permanent institutions and 
interests. 
The place of change in securing progress. — The facts 
enumerated in the preceding section indicate that there is a 
deep-seated change taking place in the educational organ- 
ization. Such a transformation will be welcome or not, 
according to our educational ideals, and also accordingly 
as we do or do not recognize the service which change 
performs in the general scheme of development. Let us 
denote this service. 
If we were to take a scientific view of the creation of the 
world, of life on the earth, and of human society, we should 
at once recognize that the celestial systems and bodies, the 
geological formations of the earth, the various forms of 
_plant and animal life, and the multitude of social institu- 
tions or organizations, have not always been as they are, 
but have developed into their present shapes and order out 
of preceding different ones. The astronomers, geologists, 
botanists, zodlogists, psychologists, sociologists, as scien-
-P-A-G-E-12
4 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
tists, each in his sphere, try to trace the series of developing 
forms and systems, from the simplest up to the most com- 
plex. To do this is to get their history, to learn their true 
nature through their origin, and thus to come to understand 
them. 
All this study might be done out of curiosity and wonder, 
just to satisfy a desire for knowledge. But it goes farther 
than that. It gives an understanding of the nature of the 
whole process of development. We see that there has been 
a real evolution; that things have grown not only bigger 
but better. Brain development has brought intelligence 
and wisdom. Perfected eyes have secured distant, minute, 
and easily adapted vision. Developed industry, inventions, 
education, government, and so on, have brought wealth and 
happiness to mankind. 
Now, when it is seen that none of these greater benefits 
could have come to us without change, without transforming 
the old into the new, we are able to appreciate the service 
and sometime desirability of change. Evidently it is appro- 
priate that we do not ruthlessly oppose movements which 
possibly may alter our educational system. We should not 
welcome changes just because they are changes, but should 
stand ready to welcome those which promise benefits, and 
ready to study and to understand them. 
Causes of changing educational perceptions. —The 
movement for educational reform has arisen out of several 
‘ perceptions. One of these is derived from investigations 
_-into school attendance and the interest of the pupils of 
elementary grades. It is found throughout the country that 
after the fourth or fifth grade, there is a rapid passing out 
of school. A minority of the children are left to complete  
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 5 
the eighth grade. Upon a search for the cause of this large 
departure it is found in the feeling of both parents and chil- 
dren that the schools do not give the training that is needed. 
Conspicuously, the boys lack interest in the academic train- 
ing alone. Investigations in various cities, and the recent 
one made by the Massachusetts Commission on Industrial 
and Technical Education, amply bear this out. 
Another perception comes from the growing sense of 
the importance of the economic factor in life, and of the 
need of training for it. A great many influences have con- 
spired to make the economic relatively more important than 
other phases of life. The comparative exhaustion of the 
supply of free public land, the growth of cities with their 
economic problems, the increasing dominance of industry 
and commerce, a knowledge of the significance of voca- 
tional education in the development of Germany, the 
international competition for the markets of the world, 
with the obvious necessity for improved production at 
home, and an altogether better grasp by the public of the 
relation of economic conditions to society generally, are some 
of the important ones. The natural effect on education of 
this accumulating stress is to strengthen the belief in indus- 
trial and vocational training, all along the line. 
Still another perception has come as a result of better 
knowledge of the individual in relation to organized 
society. The social sciences have thrown light on the 
individual, in view of his social origin, nature and destiny. 
He is seen to be a social animal, preéminently; and a mere 
individualistic pedagogy, and a system of education which 
seeks to train the child as if he were “going it alone” 
through life without regard to his fellows and to the organ- 
-
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
ized social world of which he has to make use, are found to 
be inadequate. 
When biological science has so long recognized the im- 
portance of the social environment in the genesis of the 
individual, as may be seen by inspecting literature on sex- 
relation, struggle for existence, rivalry, community life, 
gregariousness, division of labor, protective resemblance, 
mimicry, etc., which plentifully exists on these subjects, 
it is time that educational philosophy should incorporate 
into itself material which is demanded not only to make 
it truly scientific but also to make it thoroughly effective. 
Subtract the social matter from biology, and there is left 
an emasculated collection of data, which alone could not 
account for the genesis and nature of animal life. The 
psychology taught in our colleges and normal schools 
is almost wholly emasculated of the needed and legiti- 
mate social content and social context. One of the most 
needed reforms in the professional training of teachers 
is the adoption of certain phases of the social sciences, 
especially social psychology and sociology, into the training 
courses. 
Meaning of socialization. — By socialization, in general, 
is meant the process by which an individual or institution is 
brought into conformity and codperation with human society 
in its dominant interests and fundamental nature. The 
socialization of the individual is perhaps best exemplified 
in the development of the child under the influence of the 
home. By imitation and assimilation in the hourly contact 
with parents, brothers, and sisters, he follows the example 
set; realizes in himself the copies exhibited; drinks in the 
spirit and ideals of the home; and consequently develops
-P-A-G-E-15

ak 
THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 7 ‘ 
into almost exactly the same sort of person as are the 
elders. His average, his type, is that of the particular home 
in which he is reared. 
Where home life is preserved, each home is a type 
somewhat different in its outlook and practices from sur- 
rounding homes. Were there not a continuous expanding, 
socializing process in the give-and-take of the neighbor- 
hood and of the larger community life, the type of 
social beings produced by the various homes would be 
so diverse that, in case the individuals met outside the 
homes without this previous preparation, they must almost 
necessarily come into conflict, because of differing ideas and : 
habits. | 
It is by means of this socializing of the child through : 
larger and larger areas or circles of the organized life of | 
society, that individuals become like the preceding genera- 
tion of men, and carry on the essential things of common 
life. It is also by this that society continues. It is funda- 
mentally important for both the individual and society. 
Taking over this thought for education, the socialization 
of education would consist in bringing the schools of a 
given society into essential accord with its fundamental 
spirit, interests, and organization. Since education itself 
is a social institution, it is susceptible of voluntary and 
immediate control on the part of society. The socializa- 
tion of the individual must take place by a slow process 
of development. But education, as social organization, can 
be investigated and studied with reference to society; and 
if it is found to be out of harmony with the deepest interests 
and needs of the times, it can be somewhat abruptly reor- 
ganized and readjusted to the demands.  
-P-A-G-E-16
        8 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
II. VOCATIONALIZATION 
Meaning of vocational education. — Vocational education 
is a phrase which is rapidly coming into use. It is conse- 
quently desirable that its signification shall be made plain. 
The phrase is a later one than “industrial education,” 
which was used almost exclusively in the beginning of the 
movement to reorganize education on practical lines. Per- 
haps it is still the dominant expression, and probably 
the mass of people use it to describe the movement in 
question. But a little reflection will be sufficient to prove 
that “industrial education” is too narrow to express all 
that is contemplated by this agitation and movement to 
socialize schools. (The _ phrase “vocational education” is 
broad enough in meaning to cover all the training courses 
which are needed to meet the practical demands of life.) 
It will be demonstrated in another place that vocational 
education is the logical demand of organized society. This, 
it will be shown, is true, because society is an organization 
of special structures. These structures arose out of voca- 
tional activities. In order to operate successfully through 
society we must be made able to use these structures by a 
mastery of their technique. But to come into possession 
of this technique, is to be vocationalized. To learn a 
trade, an occupation, or a profession, is to become possessed 
of a technique belonging to a specialized social structure 
or division of labor. ‘To train for this elaborately, is to be 
broadly vocationalized. To train for it meagerly,. is to 
be narrowly vocationalized. 
To socialize education completely, would be to vocation- 
alize it. To vocationalize it, would be so to reconstruct it 
   
-P-A-G-E-17
A, 
THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 9 
and to readjust it that it would harmonize with the exact 
\constitution of society. But society is an organization 
of vocational structures. It is highly specialized. Educa- 
tion, then, must be as specialized as society. It must be 
vocational, because society demands specialized members 
to serve it successfully. 
Vocational education also has regard to the constitution, 
inclination, or ability of the individual to be trained. It 
recognizes that there are fitnesses and aptitudes in life; that 
not all persons can do one thing equally well. In voca- 
tionalizing the schools, therefore, it is contemplated that 
ultimately every one will be able to find suitable training 
for his niche in life. Certainly if the child is worth edu- 
cating, in himself and for human society, one of the greatest 
problems is to find where he can make the most of himself, 
and in what line he can prove himself most productive: to 
society. 
Society is already establishing agencies for ascertaining 
what the young human is most fitted to do in life. I have 
thought for many years that, with all our boasted science, 
we should be able to use laboratory methods in examining 
the child, in order to locate his inclinations, aptitudes, and 
qualifications. During the past two years this idea has 
been put in practice. By means of an endowment for the 
purpose, the late Frank Parsons established and conducted a 
vocational bureau in Boston. His account of its work is one 
of the most interesting and suggestive narratives in recent 
times. (See his account in the Arena, August and Sep- 
tember, 1908.) Similar bureaus are being used in England. 
Vocational education, moreover, views the individual as a 
member of the larger social order. While it insists that
-P-A-G-E-18
  1. 
| 
ro THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
he shall be vocationalized, it as emphatically insists that he 
shall be essentially cultured, and fundamentally moral- 
ized. To be essentially cultured is, for him, to have the 
information about himself, nature, and society, which is 
most immediate to his wants and safety. This is far differ- 
ent from culture as a preparation for polite society. To be 
fundamentally moralized, is to have instilled the habits, 
reactions, and outlook of good citizenship. Good citizen- 
ship consists in viewing conduct as related to social welfare, 
and as measured by it. To train for this, is broadly dis- 
tinct from training into formal and traditional morals. 
Vocationalization as the dominant educational end. — 
. Thus vocational education is a practical and direct con- 
~ ~ception of the method of making young human beings fit 
for life. 
As an end of education it is both an end or conception of 
training among other ends, and a dominant end to which 
all other ends are subordinate and contributive. Probably, 
so far, the great majority of educators think of it in the 
former light, as one among other ends. They recognize 
that education is preparation for life. It is a process of 
getting the various factors ingrained which the children, 
become adults, will need. Thus, they would say, to be fit 
to live, the child must have the skill of reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, he must have culture, such as is given in history, 
literature, geography, etc., he must have some moral train- 
ing, probably connected with religion in most minds, and 
he must have a trade. In their minds it is a matter of 
simple addition. Add all the elements together and you 
have the school programme or course of study constituted. 
An educational schedule is made by externally juxtaposing
-P-A-G-E-19
THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT Ir 
so many elements demanded by so many ends. But in a 
chemical combination the elements come together in definite 
proportions. Moreover a certain temperature is required 
that they may be organically fused. So in education this 
fusing process must take place. ; 
In my view vocational education is the only logical and ~ 
legitimate training. I justify this statement by my social 
philosophy. This position is demanded by the scientific 
conception of human society. There is not the individual 
and society, but the individual as a social product and 
in view of society. If the very constitution of this social 
world which environs him demands that the individual’ 
shall be specialized in terms of its nature, which in my 
estimation is the case, then the specializing of the child 
to meet the terms society imposes is the dominant thing. 
This is the great goal of education. All the phases or 
elements of education must be organized about vocation 
as the central thought and with a view to a particular 
kind of life. The cultural element must be selected with 
the vocation in mind, and must be focused on it. The 
reading and arithmetic, in their subject-matter, should be 
made contributive in a large measure to this future position 
in the world. And even certain phases of moralization 
might be gained from it. 
It is the thought of his place in society that governs the 
educational factors, .their relation to each other, and that 
fuses them into an organization. Thus no subordinate 
end or purpose should intrude, and set itself up as the chief 
object of education, in defiance of all the demands which 
organized life is going to make on the child, as has been the 
case so generally in the past. A principle would always
-P-A-G-E-20
12 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
be present as a test and criterion of what to put into the 
course of study, and as a measure of how much. 
“Vocational”? and “industrial” education. —As has 
already been remarked, there are two terms in use which 
express the practical kind of education. It may be worth 
while to indicate why industrial training is not broad enough 
to cover the demands of education in America. 
N First, the public school system, in its various stages, 
should be made expansive enough to represent all essential 
\\lines of social activity. Evidently there are callings and 
occupations which are not industrial. The right of teachers, 
lawyers, doctors, farmers, and merchants, for example, to 
have a fitting for their spheres of work, is indisputable. 
Merely to put industrial training into the schools would 
not be sufficient to answer all the demands of adjustment. 
Only a fraction of our population is strictly industrial. If 
the school system is to be transformed so as to recognize the 
neéds of all lines of life, it must be vocationalized, rather 
than industrialized. We want the great agricultural, com- 
mercial, and professional’ populations of our non-industrial 
regions represented in the transformation. 
Second, the form which. is taken by the introduction of the 
vocational factor into the schools is important to consider. 
In the older and more industrialized portions of our nation, 
the movement, so far, has chiefly consisted in preparing 
to establish, and in establishing, separate institutions or 
schools in which the vocational training is to be given. This 
has been the case notably in Massachusetts and in New 
York. Communities and neighborhoods may create special 
schools for industrial training. 
Now, however fit this method is for such communities, —~
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE VOCATIONAL MOVEMENT 13 
and I believe there are signs that it will be abandoned in the 
smaller and simpler communities, —to very large areas of 
our country it is not appropriate. It is an unnecessary and 
wasteful method of attacking the problem of adjustment. 
It is wasteful because in order to do the work it founds a 
series of new plants which are quite likely to drive the 
former plants out of existence. At any rate, it requires the 
expense of creating and maintaining two sets of plants, 
whereas one set might suffice. 
It is unnecessary in most cases, because our present 
schools may be readjusted in what they teach and do, 
so as to furnish the vocational —the practical — training 
desired, while at the same time they preserve the informa- 
tional, the cultural, and the disciplinary features which they 
possess. It seems much better, and much more economical, 
to conserve the unity of our school system while we introduce 
the needed diversity. The gradual transformation of our 
present institutions should recommend itself to our Ameri- 
can educators.
-P-A-G-E-22
  
CHAPTER II. SOME ACCOMPLISHED RESULTS OF 
PRACTICAL EDUCATION 
Every movement that bids for public approval must do so 
by means of results. These results may be those which 
have already been obtained. In this case their enumera- 
tion and exposition are all the normal and unprejudiced 
mind will demand, in order to be convinced of the efficacy 
and worthiness of the movement in question. In the early 
days of a transforming process, as in the childhood or youth 
of a man, the effects and results are necessarily limited and 
prophetic. Yet there are many lines of social effort we 
approve merely because the principles they embody are full 
of promise) We believe in them just as heartily as if they 
had matured in fruitful results. 
In the case of the educational renaissance, which now 
sets forward so impetuously, we have certain results which 
have been wrought out in the case of communities which 
have proceeded farthest in the direction of educational 
readjustment. While the business of this work is to state 
principles, demands, and methods, chiefly, and thus to 
furnish the grounds on which hopes of success may reason- 
ably rest, it may not be amiss to indicate some actual 
results gained by schools conducted on more practical 
lines; and to point out others which might be presumed

Others which are quite as valuable will become apparent in 
subsequent chapters. 
I. THE CASE OF GERMANY 
Perhaps the greatest object lesson in the direction of 
vocationalizing the schools for the masses exists in Germany. 
It is worth while to consider what has been done there in 
that respect, to note leading opinion as to its effect, and its 
consequent reaction on other nations. 
Vocational education in Germany. — Germany is poor 
in resources, as compared with the United States, yet she 
has put herself in the forefront of the nations by concentrat- 
ing on those she possesses in an intelligent manner. 
“Well established politically, Germany began to apply her 
centralized power to the development of industry. This 
expressed itself in many ways; in protective tariffs, bounties 
and subsidies, but in no way with more energy than in 
industrial education, which was pursued with the inherited 
characteristic of thoroughness to which we have called 
attention. Students of industry became the advisers of the 
government; the scientists in the laboratories of the univer- 
sities gave their services to agriculture and manufacturing; 
geographers and travelers studied with minuteness the 
physical characteristics of foreign countries; trade schools 
were established for the development of skilled factory labor 
and schools of commerce for the training of salesmen. 
Every resource of a paternalistic government was brought 
to bear to create efficiency, — efficiency in producing and 
efficiency in selling.” (Person, Industrial Education, pp. 7, 8.) 
As an illustration of how Germany is bending its energy
-P-A-G-E-24
    16 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
and wisdom to develop vocational education, Prof. Paul H. 
Hanus’s report on what just one city is doing is quoted: 
“Since 1900 the city of Munich has gradually been trans- 
forming its ‘continuation schools’ for elementary-school 
graduates (corresponding to our grammar-school graduates) 
into elementary technical schools for apprentices in the 
trades and in business. The city now maintains thirty- 
eight different kinds of these schools, as follows: In 1900 
were opened schools for butchers, bakers, shoemakers, 
chimney-sweeps and barbers; in 1901, for wood-turners, 
glaziers, gardeners, confectioners, wagon-makers, and black- 
smiths, tailors, photographers, interior decorators, painters’ 
materials; in 1902; for hotel and restaurant waiters, coach- 
men, painters and paperhangers, bookbinders, potters, and 
stove-setters, watch makers and clock makers, and jewelers, 
goldsmiths and silversmiths; in 1903, for foundrymen, 
pewterers, coppersmiths, tinsmiths, and plumbers, stucco 
workers and marble cutters, wood carvers, ‘Schaffler,’ sad- 
dlers and leather workers; and in 1905, for business appren- 
tices, printers and typesetters, lithographers and engravers, 
building-iron and ornamental-iron-workers, machine mak- 
ers, mechanics, cabinet-makers, masons and stone cutters, 
carpenters.” 
These are the chief industries of the city save that of 
beer, for the manufacture of which only higher instruction 
is given. A great many of these schools are not evening 
schools. ‘tAs continuation-school education is compul- 
sory for three, sometimes four, years in Bavaria for all 
elementary-school graduates, the law requires employers to 
give their employés the necessary time —six to ten hours 
per week, depending on the school —to attend the continu-

ation school” for the trade or business in view. (‘'Tech- 
nical Continuation Schools of Munich,’ School Review, 
Vol. 13, p. 678.) 
Other illustrations may be seen in the case of Saxony, a 
diminutive state, which supports about 115 technical insti- 
tutes; in that of Baden, which, with 1,600,000 people, 
spends $280,000 yearly on technical schools; in that of 
Hesse, which, with 1,000,000 people, supports 83 schools of 
design, 43 of manufacturing industries. and many others 
for artisans of various trades. Prussia alone has over 3,000 
industrial, trade, commercial, and agricultural schools with 
an attendance of over 200,000 students. In the city of 
Berlin there are over 40,000 students in supplementary 
trade, industrial, and commercial schools. 
Germany has also recognized that the woman toiler, as 
the product of social and economic. conditions, should be 
trained in accordance with these demands. Mr. Meyer, the 
United States deputy consul at Chemnitz, reports the pro- 
visions for training women. Private commercial schools 
for women founded in 1860 were soon followed by broader 
industrial schools known as the Lette-Verein. In these 
may be obtained knowledge of photography, and such 
callings as machine sewing, tailoring, linen sewing, milli- 
nery, washing, ironing, cooking, nursing, serving, domestic. 
economy, embroidery, ornamental drawing, etc. 
Other schools and industrial organizations followed in 
the wake of the great success of the former. Saxony, the 
greatest seat of German industry, employing the greatest 
percentage of women in proportion to population, had twenty- 
four special trade schools and fourteen general industrial 
schools for girls in 1899. Schools of domestic science, to
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
train for cooking and home duties, were also founded to 
check the tremendous tide of. young women toward the 
workshops and factories; and their remarkably rapid 
growth attests their success. 
It is interesting to notice the way American business 
and educational conditions are regarded by the Germans. 
The German investigators who attended the St. Louis 
Fair spoke “warmly of our natural resources, of our mechan- 
ical skill and progressive spirit. But ‘they conclude that 
on the whole the American danger has been greatly exag- 
gerated, and that a steadfast adherence by Germany to 
the educational system and commercial methods now in 
practice will leave the Fatherland little to fear in future 
competition with American manufactured goods.’” These 
critics “find us too self-satisfied, for one thing. We send 
trade agents abroad without preparation and without even 
knowing the languages they should use. Our higher schools 
turn out a few expert chemists, dyers and engineers. Our 
‘commercial colleges,’ with their three months’ courses, 
seem to the German visitors ‘little better than a farce’ as a 
substitute for a thorough business training. High wages, 
high express charges and the general heavy cost of handling 
business are other things held to be unfavorable to us in 
competition.” “It is national foolishness to imagine that 
an American can pick up in a few weeks at work the knowl- 
edge his German rival has taken ten years to learn by well- 
directed study; or that a community overstocked with 
doctors and lawyers and understocked with trained captains 
of industry is vel pred to battle for world commerce.” 
(The Weekly World, New York, March 16, 1905; Hailmann, 
German Views of American Education, p. 22.)
-P-A-G-E-27

Leading opinions about Germany’s advance. — There is 
now almost uniform agreement that Germany’s great 
industrial and commercial development has been produced 
by that nation’s systematic and wholesale encouragement 
and establishment of technical and commercial schools. 
Said President E. J. James a few years ago in an address 
at St. Louis: 
“Other countries have not neglected this field so entirely 
as the United States. Few phenomena in the field of 
national and international trade have been more striking 
than the relatively rapid growth of Germany in the field of 
industry and commerce in the last thirty years. It is the 
opinion of all careful students of German history during 
the last generation that this result is to be attributed, more 
than anything else, to the clear perception on the part of 
the Germans that only the efficient and thoroughgoing 
education, general and special, of all classes in the com- 
munity would enable it to overcome the serious disadvan- 
tages which distinguished its position as compared with that 
of England, for example.” 
Ernest L. Harris, United States Commercial Agent to 
Eibenstock, Germany, wrote in 1903: “Ten years’ resi- 
dence and study in Germany has led me to the belief that 
this Empire’s greatest capital is its intelligence. A process 
of rigid training has not only enabled Germany to overcome 
the disadvantages of her geographical position, but the 
merchants and manufacturers of England find themselves 
face to face with the fact that German commerce has much 
more rapidly increased than their own, and that many 
markets in different parts of the world are being lost to 
their German competitors.
-P-A-G-E-28
    20 THE ‘EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
“One result of the neglect of commercial education in 
England is the inability of English commercial travelers 
and agents properly to represent the trade interests of their 
country. As a rule, these vital interests are in the hands 
of foreigners, who have received special commercial training 
in some of the many excellent commercial schools on the 
continent. It would be difficult to estimate how many 
young Germans are managing the correspondence in large 
English business houses. The advent of Germany upon 
the scene, as one of her keenest competitors, has caused 
some anxiety in England, and the cause which has brought 
about this result is now generally and correctly conceded 
to be the superior technical and commercial training 
accorded to the German youth.” (U.S. Education Report, 
1903, p. 654.) | 
Referring to the marvelous expansion of German trade 
the London Daily Mail of June 22, 1903, said: “It is, of 
course, impossible to locate with certainty the actual effects 
of any given cause, but there can be but little doubt that the 
growth of many immense industries is traceable to the sys- 
tem of education that has directed all the available powers 
of scientific knowledge and research upon industrial prob- 
lems.” (U.S. Education Report, 1903, p. 633-) 
Similarly, Lord Rosebery recognized German superior- 
ity, and acknowledged its cause to be special training, when 
he addressed the London County Council, submitting a plan 
and offering a liberal contribution for a technical university 
which he urged that body to establish. 
Says Howard, “In studying the educational methods and 
systems of Germany, therefore, we are dealing ‘with one 
of the most fundamental causes of her recent industrial 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
    
RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION ai 
progress. There is no doubt that it is his splendid indus- 
trial training which has enabled the German to overcome 
many obstacles in reaching his present industrial position; 
and to cope with the difficulties which other peoples have 
not had to meet; i.e. ‘widespread poverty,’ poor soil, and 
conservatism on the part of the people.” (Howard, Recent 
Industrial Progress of Germany, p. 96.) 
England’s educational response. —England’s movement 
towards establishing universities of a new type bespeaks 
her consciousness of the real problem confronting her. 
Civic universities in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, 
Sheffield, and Leeds have been established within the last 
six years, and that of London has been reorganized and put 
on a working basis. Says Douglas Hall: “To the Briton 
of the future the early years of the twentieth century will be 
significant, not for the Boer wars or the fiscal campaigns 
which absorbed public attention in their day, but for the 
unobtrusive coming into being of these five great new 
centers of light and leading. The movement testifies to the 
revival of interest in educational matters apparent on all 
sides in England. America’s commercial invasion, Ger- 
many’s utilization of science in industry, Japan’s new birth 
through education, have led to much searching of heart in 
Britain, and to a conviction that the educational system 
must be thoroughly overhauled. Hence the present fierce 
controversy over the elementary school provisions of the 
new Education Bill, the commissions of inquiry into second- 
ary schools, and, finally, ‘the doubling of the nation’s univer- 
sity facilities at a stroke.” (The Outlook, New York, Vol. 83, 
P- 979.) 
“Not only are these universities strongly technological, 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
22 THE espa RENAISSANCE 
but they each and all lay stress on the branches of science 
of most useful local application. Leeds is the center of 
England’s textile industry, and accordingly we find in its 
university a School of Textile Industries and a School of 
Dyeing and Color Chemistry, which are doing excellent 
work, Had such a faculty as the latter been established 
twenty years ago, England would not now be galled by the 
spectacle of her one time supremacy in the chemical and 
coloring industries wrested from her by researchful Germany. 
At Sheffield, appropriately, the Schools of Metallurgy and 
Mining are predominant. Liverpool, perhaps, is most 
famous for its School of Tropical Medicine, under Major 
Ronald Ross, famous for his discovery of the connection 
between the mosquito and malaria.” This is because a 
founder works the coast of Africa, a region where tropical 
sanitation is needed. “The departments of marine biology 
and fisheries, of electrotechnics and physical chemistry, 
are also specially strong here. In Birmingham metallurgy 
and mining are prominent, and in Manchester much 
excellent research work has been done in chemistry and 
physics and their application to the Cotton City’s indus- 
tries.’ (Lhe Outlook, New York, Vol. 83, pp. 983-4.) 
The Japanese. — It would be interesting to learn what 
the Japanese are doing. It is pretty certain that those 
astute students and enterprisers are not letting lessons 
from the educational field escape them. Having referred 
to the effect of industrial education on Germany’s advance, 
Person remarks: “The same may be said of the Japanese. 
Their development has been not less remarkable, and is to 
be attributed not less to technical education. For some 
years the Japanese have been seaelng young men abroad to

secure training in the. military, naval, and industrial arts. 
We have just witnessed the remarkable results of such 
training for war; the results of the similar training for 
industry are not forced by circumstances into so high a 
light, but they are no less significant”’ (p. 28). 
II. THE CASE OF THE SOUTH 
The race problem. —In taking up a consideration of 
the South several interesting points appear. One is the 
recognition by the newer leadership in the South of the 
real causes which brought on the Civil War and created 
the difference in advancement between that section of 
the Union and the North. Another is the recognition of the 
need of coupling the education of the region on to the 
economic interests, in order that the region may recover 
its place of industrial equality with the North and the rest 
of the civilized world. Still another is the bearing indus- 
trial training promises to have on the future of the black 
race in its relation to the white race and to the rest of the 
nation. 
On this last point it may be said that industrial training 
holds out more promise, in the way of establishing cordial 
and sympathetic connections between the two races in the 
South, than anything else. From a very careful study of 
the “race problem,” I am firmly convinced that such a 
settlement as social equality is out of the question, since 
social equality means the right to intermarry under social 
approval, —a suggestion that brings a protest from all 
quarters. Political equality seems almost as far removed. 
At least it is conditioned on attainments along some other 
lines.  
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
But there is an economic equality which is readily granted 
by the whites and which causes little or no friction. Blacks 
and whites meet and do business without friction, each 
race being accorded its place and rights. Both races line 
up at the Post Office for the delivery of the mail, or take their 
turn shopping at counters, in peace and order. It is only 
in connections where the question of ascendency of race 
obtrudes that trouble arises. If the mass of negroes could 
be made valuable economic factors, intelligently efficient 
by industrial training, they would find economic recogni- 
tion. On this basis, which must come before all else, 
political equality might be insured. 
The backwardness of the South. —It is commonly under- 
stood that the South is exceedingly backward in point of 
industrial, commercial, and educational conditions as com- 
pared with the North. A trip through that portion of 
the country will convince anyone that agriculture is almost 
a generation behind agriculture in the North, and that 
manufacture and commerce lag. Also a cursory or careful 
examination of the diagrams of the amount of various 
manufactured products turned out by states, to be found 
in the United States Census Report of 1900, will demon- 
strate the leadership of the North. 
Of course this backwardness of the South is due to the 
previous existence of slavery. History has shown that the 
economic system built up in the South, on the basis of 
slave labor, determined its political, religious, and educa- 
tional institutions.* Slave labor, because of the low order 
of intelligence and specialization with respect to skilled 
* J. F. Rhodes, History of the United States, Vol. I, Chap. 4; Coman, In- 
dustrial Hist. of the U. S., p. 246; Bogart, Economic Hist. of the U. S., p. 430.
-P-A-G-E-33
RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 25 
employment, was fit only for the lower order of industrial- 
ism, —the agricultural stage. But slave labor, suddenly 
become free, was as backward in skill and intelligence as 
previously, and much less likely to lead a strenuous life of 
industry. Consequently the South has remained an agricul- 
tural region, with an unintelligent and shifty labor supply, 
and its other institutions have remained largely undeveloped. 
Education and Industrialization the remedies. — The 
leading spirits of the southern states recognize the difference 
existing between the two sections, understand the nature 
of the causes which have led to southern stagnation, and 
consequently are able to prescribe the remedy for the evils. 
The traveler in the southern states in conversation with 
prominent and intelligent farmers, merchants, manufac- 
turers, educators, and professional men, soon discovers 
that educational reform is held to be the panacea and 
regenerator. More education, better education, and, espe- 
cially, industrial education, is demanded. A few typical 
expressions of this sentiment will be given by way of illus- 
tration. 
“The long and bitter struggle between the North and the 
South, although waged apparently in courts of justice and 
halls of Congress, in pulpits and dining rooms, on decks of 
ships and fields of battle, was not political, nor legal, nor 
social, nor military, but educational and industrial. It was 
a struggle between the educated Yankee mechanic, astride 
the steam engine, and the educated southern planter, car- 
rying on his shoulders the negro slave. ... There was 
no need of Gettysburg or Appomattox. The contest had 
already been settled by mills and factories, the railways 
and steamships, the power looms and spinning jennies,

26 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
the reaper, binders, threshers, and other machinery of a 
people leading the world in mechanical invention, in use 
of machinery, in industrial progress, and in public educa- 
ome.) 
“The South is now in touch with the world. She is ed- 
ucating her own children and the children of the recent 
slaves... . The problem is not political but purely in- 
dustrial.” With respect to that of the negro it is that of 
existence. ‘For this generation and many yet to come, there 
is need of radical change in negro education. His colleges 
of law, of medicine, of theology, and of literature, science, 
and art should be turned into schools for industrial training. 
Hampton Institute and Tuskegee should be duplicated in 
every southern state —if possible in each congressional 
district.” 
And concerning the whites: ‘The necessity of industrial 
education is almost as great for southern whites as for the 
negro. The industrial life of the New South must be based 
on education. The education of the New South must lead 
to industrial life. The southern schoolboy dream of states- 
manship must yield to desire for workmanship. . . . The 
weavers of Asia are still using hand power. When they rise 
to steam and power looms the South must move up further 
or else be ruined. Industrial education is our only hope.” 
(“Industrial Education in the New South,” George T. 
Winston, President of the North Carolina College of 
Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, U. S. Education Report, 
1903, Vol. I, p. 509.) 
“Having made provision for the elementary education 
of the people on this broad plan, we may wisely turn our 
attention to the technical education. . . . The acquisition
-P-A-G-E-35
RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 27 
of wealth must precede the cultivation of science. -Tech- 
nical skill is needed to utilize the raw material to the best 
advantage. The time comes, however, in the history of 
every nation when it must educate its people in science 
and train them in manufactures and industries or it will go 
down. This higher scientific education is the forerunner 
of higher prosperity, and the nation which fails to develop 
the intellectual faculty for production must degenerate, for 
it cannot stand still.” (“Education and Production,” 
Charles W. Dabney, President of the University of Tennes- 
see, U. S. Education Report, 1903, p. 513.) 
“Tt seems to me that for many years to come the educa- 
tion of the negro should be of a very practical character, 
such as given, for instance, at Hampton and Tuskegee. The 
prevalence and increase of crime throughout our country 
may well cause us to suspect that our system of education 
for the white people might also be improved by introducing 
more of the practical and industrial into our public schools.” 
(“Negro Education in the South,” Julius D. Dreher, 
President Roanoke College, U. S. Education Report, 1903, 
P- 523.) : 
Mrs. May Wood Simons writes, that there are three 
industrial or economic changes in the South which have a 
bearing on education. First, a growth in the cotton industry, 
from 180 factories in 1880 to 663 in 1900, which chiefly make 
coarser goods but are turning to finer grades for which 
skilled labor is demanded. Hence the birth of textile 
schools in that section. Second, the development of the 
iron industry with consequent demand for schools of mining 
and of engineering. Third, the growing consciousness of 
the need of better and more scientific methods of farming,
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
with consequent establishment of and demand for agricul- 
tural schools. 
She indicates thus the sentiment in the South for indus- 
trial training: “To state that its importance is recognized 
is to describe the condition mildly. It is the demand of 
the hour. Unique conditions have met in the South. 
Passing suddenly from the eighteenth century social organi- 
zation to modern industrial life, the problem arose of fitting 
her people to utilize her raw products. . . . The attitude of 
the southern public may be thus summed up, that it desires 
to give men industrial training that they may become more 
profitable economic producers, and thus increase the wealth 
of that section of country.” (“Education in the South,” 
Amer. Jour. Sociology, Nov., 1904.) 
View of Booker T. Washington on negro problem. — No 
doubt among the most valuable, if not the most valuable, 
opinions on the proper training of the negroes are those 
of the eminent educators of that race, since they have more 
intimate knowledge and experience of the race difficulties, 
a warmer sympathy with the feelings and ambitions of the 
race, and a more certain instinct and apprehension of the 
agencies and remedies. by which race progress is to come. 
_ Mr. Booker T, Washington, as a conspicuous example, 
looks to the practical and economic basis of education, 
believing the negroes will succeed best by making themselves 
useful in the various lines of economic service which the 
South demands. He would, first of all, train for industrial 
competency, believing that this will bring desired levels of 
progress. “At Tuskegee,” he says, “we emphasize two lines 
of work: first, normal teaching; second, industrial training. 
By the latter we purpose to send out young men and
-P-A-G-E-37
  RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 29 
women skilled in all these lines of industrial, agricultural, 
and domestic science and in the mechanic arts. We do 
not do this without a purpose, nor without thinking. We 
do it because we have studied the conditions of the ten 
million, in round numbers, of our people in the country. 
Unless this generation can be wise enough and brave enough, 
can be strong enough to put intelligent brains into these 
occupations, and thus lay the foundation deeply for the 
generations that are to come, it is impossible that we have 
a successful race in this country. Without the courage and 
patience necessary to the laying of this foundation, we shall 
find ourselves in the same condition as the unfortunate 
people of the three countries of which I have spoken.” * 
In an article entitled by him, “The Negro in the New 
Century,” Mr. Washington wrote: “In the present condi- 
tion of the race it is most important that, whether we give 
the negro youth classical education, common school eq ucation 
or industrial education, in some way we urge a large pro- 
portion of these individuals to bring to bear the force, the 
power of their education upon the common everyday, funda- 
mental occupations that are at the door of each man in the 
community where he lives. 
“There is no longer any question as to the ability of the 
negro to absorb knowledge or to perform all the processes of 
mental gymnastics that the white man performs, but the main 
problem is to teach him to apply his mental equipment, to 
harness it to the material things at his door that need to be 
done. If the negro student is to reside in an agricultural 
district, teach him to excel in all forms of agriculture. If 
* From a Sunday Evening Talk to Tuskegee students.

3° THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
mechanics is the main industry in his community, teach him 
that. If poultry-raising is in demand in the neighborhood in 
which the negro girl resides, teach her to raise poultry in an 
intelligent, scientific manner. In doing this you may miss 
giving her a classical education, but you will help lay the 
foundation so that her children and grandchildren can secure 
what the world calls the highest mental culture. . . . 
“We must keep in mind —and this is the lesson that we con- 
stantly emphasize at Tuskegee — that thrift, economy, skill, 
property, intelligence, and Christian character are the funda- 
mental things for the race to secure. Ina large degree the 
negro is of an agricultural race, and we should seek through 
education to teach him to remain on the farm. We can do 
this by teaching him to put skill, brains, and science into 
agricultural pursuits.” 
Visible results of industrial and moral training. —In 
so far as vocational education, along with proper moral 
influence, has obtained in the South, the results are most 
gratifying and indicate larger beneficent consequences in 
future. There is no thought of slighting or disparaging the 
other parent schools of a vocational nature in this large 
reference to Tuskegee. What it is doing may be taken as 
typical of the work of Hampton and others. 
In an able address at the Hampton Institute meeting in 
New York, reported by the Tribune, Mr. Washington said: 
“Not a single graduate of the Hampton Institute or of the 
Tuskegee Institute can be found to-day in any jail or state 
penitentiary. After making careful inquiry, I cannot find a 
half dozen cases of a man or woman who has completed a full 
course of education in any of our reputable institutions like
-P-A-G-E-39
RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 31 
Hampton, Tuskegee, Fish, or Atlanta who are in prisons. 
The records of the South show that go per cent of the colored 
people in prison are without knowledge of trades and 61 
per cent are illiterate. This statement alone disproves the 
assertion that the negro grows in crime as education increases. 
If the negro at the North is more criminal than his brother 
at the South, it is because the North withholds from him 
the opportunity for employment which the South gives. It 
is not the educated negro who has been guilty of or even 
charged with crime in the South; it is, as a rule, the one who 
has a mere smattering of education or is in total ignorance.” 
Rev. R. C. Bedford, of Beloit, Wis., travels about con- 
tinuously looking after the graduates of Tuskegee. His 
record contains over 5,000 names. He estimates that less 
than ro per cent are failures in their professions and occupa- 
tions. Such schools as Tuskegee receive large recognition 
at home and abroad, and the demands for their products 
are greater than the outputs in graduates. “Here are illus- 
trations from Tuskegee: “Of 525 young men who left 
the institute for the summer vacation, practically all were 
engaged for some kind of employment many days before 
the school term closed. One firm in Mississippi employed 
25 students for the summer and sent tickets for their railway 
passage. In other cases agents representing various indus- 
trial plants came in person to urge students to enter their 
employment. Still others solicited students by mail and 
telegraph.” And, says Mr. Washington, “those seeking the 
labor of our students were practically all southern whites. In 
the majority of cases the students were sought for labor which 
required not only skill but a high degree of intelligence.” 
Upon the recommendations of Secretary Wilson of the  
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
Agricultural Department at Washington, three graduates 
of Tuskegee went to Africa in 1900 to teach cotton raising to 
the natives of the German provinces. At the end of the 
second year the officials were so well satisfied with their 
services that they sent for three other students and last 
year a hundred bales of cotton were shipped from Toga, 
Africa, to Berlin —the first notable invoice. From this 
time on the product will rapidly increase. Both the English 
and Belgian governments have also employed Tuskegee 
graduates to introduce cotton raising into their African 
colonies, and the government of Hayti has recently made 
propositions to a similar purpose. It has sent a number 
of young men to Tuskegee to be trained in farming. The 
government of Porto Rico maintains eighteen students at 
public expense. 
The influence of Tuskegee on the negroes of Alabama is 
thus stated by W. E. Curtis: 
“Not more than half of the work of the institute is done 
on the campus or in the auxiliary schools that are taught 
by its students. Two agents from the faculty are constantly 
traveling in Alabama, teaching the colored farmers how to 
live, how to work, how to make the most of their labor, how 
to improve their farms and make gardens, how to care 
for stock, how to raise vegetables, how to whitewash their 
houses, and handle their implements. They are continu- 
ally holding local conferences in different neighborhoods, 
bringing the farmers together, and talking to them on 
practical subjects. Seventy or eighty farmers meet at 
Tuskegee every month for a conference and are taught by 
the members of the agricultural faculty, while an annual 
conference brings together several hundred every year. The
-P-A-G-E-41
RESULTS OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 33 
conference for 1905 has just adjourned. It was the most 
encouraging ever held, showing that the colored farmers 
of Alabama during the last year made more progress than 
ever before in history. More of them are buying homes 
and farms of their own, and working on contracts less. 
They are saving their money so that they do not have to 
mortgage their cotton in advance. They are getting better 
tools and better seed so they can make better crops. They 
are abandoning the one-room cabin, which is the curse of 
the South, and are building two, three, and four roomed 
houses. They are educating their children and extending 
the terms of the country schools by private subscriptions. 
The state keeps the schools open only three months, but by 
chipping in a few dollars each, the farmers in the neighbor- 
hood are able to extend the term to five or six months. The 
churches are making great improvements; they are getting 
rid of immoral preachers and driving them out of the com- 
munities. All this is largely due to Tuskegee influence.” 
There are seventeen like schools in various parts of the 
South founded, managed, and taught by Tuskegee gradu- 
ates, none with less than 60 students, some with several 
hundred, altogether with not less than 4,000 men and 
women. Over two hundred graduates of Tuskegee Institute 
are engaged in yet other industrial schools. 
Ill. EFFECT ON REMUNERATION 
Industrial training and wages. —It was previously ob- 
served by Mr. Washington that the worth of Tuskegee 
graduates in terms of wages was increased threefold. 
Wages ought to coincide with productive capacity, other 
things being equal.

34 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
James M. Dodge, president of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, sets forth the value of a trade school 
education. Mr. Dodge argues that an untrained boy of 
sixteen, in good health, represents a potential value of 
$3,000 on entering a trade school or shop —that is, he is 
worth to his employer 5 per cent of $3,000, or $150 a year; 
that the shop-taught lad in nine years has increased this 
potential value at the rate of $1,300 per annum, while the 
trade-school man’s investment in himself has been at the 
rate of $2,100 per annum. The untrained lad will earn 
$15 per week at 24 years of age (and only 5 per cent of this 
class ever earn any more), while the graduate of the trade 
school reaches this earning capacity between 20 and 21, 
and is getting $20 a week before he is 24, with unlimited 
possibilities for the future. Mr. Dodge urges, backing 
his arguments by facts and figures, that the best investment 
any boy can make is to “invest himself”? by increasing his 
own potential value. This result, Mr. Dodge points out, 
is gained most thoroughly and effectively by training. 
(“The Money Value of Training,” Sz. Nicholas, Nov., 
1904.) 
The Massachusetts Commission on Industrial and Techni- 
cal Education confirms this line of statement. It shows that 
those entering shops at 14, at the age of 25 receive $12.00 or 
$13.00 per week, as much as they ever receive; and that 
those who have technical school training, entering industrial 
work at about 18, at the age of 25 receive as much as $30 
per week, and have successive advancement ahead of them.

for an extended treatment.)

CHAPTER III. REACTION ON EDUCATION AND 
THE SCHOOL 
Tue previous chapter has indicated some benefits which 
are becoming apparent as a result of the better articulation 
of the schools with life, in certain world communities; and 
future chapters will imply certain benefits which society 
should receive if the social demands on education are met. 
It may not be amiss to indicate briefly how education itself 
and the schools might hope to reap profit were this move- 
ment to be consummated. We might expect numerous 
effects of a beneficial character to ensue from the vocation- 
alization of education. Some of these benefits we may 
consider to be the following: 
I. EFFECT ON EDUCATION AND EDUCATORS 
On the educational system. — One of the most desirable 
results of socializing the schools would be seen in education 
itself. As the means and method by which the young 
individual is made fit to live in society, and to bear the 
responsibility of its continuance and direction, its part of 
the cultural activities is as important as the task it executes. 
And the children it trains are the chief objects of social 
effort. ‘The sociological importance of children extends 
beyond the mere idea of perpetuating the race. They 
form the center of social activity and cause intense effort in 
their rearing and culture. Nor does this influence decline 
in the progress of civilization, but grows greater, generation 
35
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
after generation, until to-day the child dwells at the center 
of civilization. For him we work and save, for him we 
sacrifice and live that he may be better developed than his 
ancestors, and be brought into a better environment.” 
(Blackmar, Elements of Sociology, p. 221.) We might 
regard with delight, therefore, whatever promises to develop 
education. 
There are two notable benefits which might be conceived 
to accrue to education from recognizing larger needs. The 
first is that education would evolve by becoming more 
differentiated. Differentiation is one of the essential marks 
of progress, and is necessary to growth. Growth of all 
kinds of organisms takes place as the structures become 
more specialized. Increasing heterogeneity, when accom- 
panied by integration of parts, produces a higher and finer 
form of animal organism or of social organization. Mere 
multiplication of duplicate parts might give size but would 
not add quality to educational organization. Advance in 
quality can alone come by diversification of parts having 
differing needs to meet. 
Of course, the general public is not directly interested in 
this line of thought, except in its practical bearing. The 
practical consequences would come in the shape of greater 
efficiency of the schools, by reason of their better adjust- 
ment to diversification of needs both individual and com- 
munal, and in the resulting greater efficiency society would 
have because its potential ability had been better discovered, 
trained, and distributed to the various callings of life. This 
would give a better balance to the social system and secure 
more frequent and rapid changes in the direction of progress. 
A beneficial result would come to education in its scien- 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL 37 
tific and philosophic aspects. Educational philosophy has 
commonly been based on a foundation that has been too 
narrow and abstract. It has very often assumed the end 
which education is to meet. Or, if it has proceeded scientif- 
ically at all, it has not covered the whole ground relative 
to the individual, in that it has not treated the practical 
needs of life as exhibited in a study of his social articulations. 
But a fully developed vocational philosophy of education 
would have to be exceedingly concrete and consequently 
diversified. On the vocational basis, there is not just one 
education but many kinds of training. They abound and 
will still more abound. The educational philosopher must 
know the nature of these vocations, and be able to state the 
principles which govern them, in order to be able to pro- 
nounce on what would be an adequate training in a given 
case. He must know the science of community life as well 
as that of psychology. Sociology would be competent to 
pronounce on the principles covering the relative values 
of courses, and psychology would say how and when the 
subject matter is to be imparted. Thus the science of 
education would look toward becoming an applied science, 
or at least to containing that feature. 
Were the schools completely socialized by being vocation- 
alized, certain desirable results would be gained by teachers. 
Appreciation. — The first would doubtless be a better 
appreciation by the larger community. That educators are 
not the most influential and highly regarded members of 
the community in America needs no special proof. Per- 
haps in no other great nation do they stand so low in public 
esteem. In Germany, at least, the teacher is looked up to 
as the community’s most respected personage. No doubt
-P-A-G-E-46
  | 
38 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
a part of the regard comes by reason of his greater educa- 
tional qualifications. Not every candidate with a minimum 
of training can be certificated to teach. Much of the regard 
comes as a consequence of the high value the Germans set 
on education. Under the old forms of education the Ger- 
mans taught the teachers of the nations. Under the new 
forms it is assuming they are, to date, the schoolmasters 
of the world. They have stood for thorough training, what- 
ever the form their training takes, and have respected their 
educators. 
The Americans are practical people and are prepared to 
appreciate whatever appeals to them in this way. As fast 
as schools have been made to articulate with common 
needs they have gained the people’s hearty support, and 
the instructors have risen in the estimation of the com- 
munity. A closer concord of schools with people’s interests, 
together with higher requirements for teachers, will do much 
to raise the standing of the latter. 
Better economic compensation. — The economic standing 
of teachers would probably be improved. This would 
result from creating more positions and lines of work, 
from raising standards of ability and training so that the 
inefficient would be weeded out, and from rendering the 
work of the teachers in an economic way more productive 
to the community. It will perhaps prove profitable to 
expand the economic phase. 
It would be true, as a general statement, to say that the 
_ scale of remuneration expresses the economic significance 
which society attaches to men’s services. Small pay indi- 
cates that the work is not viewed as vitally productive. If 
a man can demonstrate that his services are directly produc-
-P-A-G-E-47
  
EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL 39 
tive of social well-being, of economic benefit, his remunera- 
tion will be liberal. 
It is safe to ‘say that no other line of educated men can 
show returns in emolument such as those of the graduates 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On the 
other hand, no other line receives such low pay as educators. 
Some comparison between educational workers, both in 
higher and lower branches, may be profitably made to elu- 
cidate this point. 
In higher education a very few heads of departments or 
rare specialists in a very few heavily endowed schools 
may receive $7,000 or $8,000 yearly. “Columbia Univer- 
sity has a maximum salary of $8,000, but an average sal- 
ary for full professors of $4,289.”” The maximum in the 
University of Chicago for a department head is $7,000; that 
for a professor is $4,500. (Bulletin Two, Carnegie Founda- 
tion, “The Financial Status of the Professor in America and 
in Germany,” p. 27.) But the teaching work is chiefly done 
by lower rank men in these institutions. Average salaries of 
associate and assistant professors, instructor, and assistant 
instructor, in these two institutions, are as follows: Columbia 
University (no associate), $2,201, $1,800, $500; University 
of Chicago, $2,800, $2,200, $1,450, $666. (Same, pp. 10-11.) 
Of the 470 in America, “it cannot be doubted that the 
degree-giving institutions vary from an average provision 
for the full professors of from less than $500 a year up to 
$4,788. Ninety-seven institutions pay an average of $2,000 
or over; only 20 pay an average of $3,000 or over, and, as 
noted before, only 9 pay an average of $3,500 or over.” 
(Same, p. 29.) Those teachers under the rank of full pro- 
fessors receive much less.
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
It is found in the study of the salaries of full professors 
that men reach the position at the average age of 34, and 
receive an average salary of $2,500. At the’same age men 
in law, medicine, and scientific operations receive as much 
or more. But the teacher has reached his maximum salary, 
on the average. “The successful professional man, on the 
other hand, is just beginning to reap the substantial rewards 
of his ability and training — (and) rises steadily in the 
large cities to $10,000, $20,000, and $30,000 a year, and in 
smaller towns to incomes not so large actually, but rela- 
tively large in proportion to the scale of living.” (Same, 
PP. 23-24.) 
Should we turn to lower ranges of educational work, we 
find, for the United States, “that in no section does the man 
teacher receive so much as 70 per cent of the average wage 
of all workers in other occupations than that of teacher; 
and that in the country as a whole, even on the untenable 
assumption that the average school year is nine months, 
the man teacher receives only 57 per cent as high yearly 
wage as that of the average employee in all other occupa- 
tions. As a matter of fact, Commissioner Harris’s report 
for 1900 (Vol. I, 717) gives $342.36 as the average annual 
salary of men teachers in the United States for rg00. Using 
this as a basis, we find the average yearly salary of men 
teachers in this country is only 41.7 per cent of the average 
yearly wage of blacksmiths, carpenters, foremen in machine 
shops, machinists, and painters.” (Report of Committee 
on Salaries and Social Status of Teachers, North Dakota 
State Educational Association, 1904, Bulletin No. 6, Dept. 
of Public Instruction, N. Dak., p. 8.) 
One cannot predict just what benefit a better organized 
|
-P-A-G-E-49
  EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL 41 
system of education would have on teachers’ wages. There 
are of course other factors working to keep low compensa- 
tion, besides the one mentioned. Custom is certainly a 
very great cause of low salaries in universities and in other 
kinds of higher institutions. It probably is a powerful 
factor in the elementary schools likewise. A saner and 
juster point of view must be established in society relative 
to the teachers’ remuneration. 
In the lower kinds of public schools the predominance 
of women has a decidedly debasing effect on salaries. In 
industrial work it is found that in those lines recently 
entered by women in large numbers, the wages have fallen 
50 per cent on the average. There, as in teaching, women 
do not expect to remain in the work long, do not have 
the professional pride nor the vital self-interest as a con- 
sequence, and are hence willing to accept a bare living 
wage. 
We thus see that the subject of wages is a complicated 
matter. Yet on the analogy of other kinds of service, more 
productive work should tend in the direction of better 
financial reward. 
II. ON SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
Elimination of pupils. —The second benefit education 
would derive from transformation into training for voca- 
tional ends would come in the shape of increased appre- 
ciation of the schools, and consequently an increase of 
attendance. There seems to be growing among the people 
the opinion that the public schools are not really vital agen- 
cies. There is great questioning of their serviceability, in 
many directions. It is believed by an increasing number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
      
   
  THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
  42 
  parents that their children do not learn what they most 
need. Education and_ schools, consequently, are placed 
in the attitude of sufferance. Because of the lack of full 
appreciation, they want that dignity or standing they should 
have to be thoroughly effective. It is indefensible that the 
most important means of socialization should be so scouted. 
Could the schools be transformed so as to meet differing 
community needs, confidence would be restored, and educa- 
tional effort would be rendered more efficient. 
The studies which have been made of the elimination of 
children from the schools show that relatively few get any- 
thing like a modicum of education. Prof. C. M. Woodward 
made a study of elimination in St. Louis. His numerical 
diagram is reproduced on the following page and is self- 
explanatory. _ 
The letters and figures at the top of the diagram indicate 
the various school grades. The Arabic numbers, located 
at the points along the tracing line, indicate the enrollment 
in the various years. 
The facts presented in this diagram are approximately typi- 
cal of other places in and of the whole of the United States. 
This study approximately shows that 50 per cent of the 
children left school by the beginning of the 5th grade, 75 per 
cent by the end of the 5th, 85 per cent by the 7th, and 88 per 
cent by the 8th grade. Some other cities, such as Chicago, 
New York, and Boston, were more successful in retaining 
the children in their schools. This report also apparently 
shows that but 5.6 per cent of the children of the first ele- 
mentary grade entered the High School, and less than one 
half of this number remained in the second year of the High 
School. The number of children entering High School for

both city and country is probably far less than ro per cent.

to and from private schools, etc. The percentages would 
be measurably smaller.

to year is self-explanatory. It is noteworthy that over 50 per 
cent of the number of pupils of the second grade is in the 
seventh. (From “A Suggested Readjustment of the Year 
of Study of the Public Schools of New York City,” City 
Club of New York, 1908, p. 4.) 
Professor Thorndike has made an exceedingly cautious 
and scientific investigation of elimination, and embodied it 
in a report for the United States Bureau of Education. 
(“The Elimination of Pupils from School,” E. L. Thorndike, 
Washington, Government Printing Office, 1908.) His conclu- 
sions for the country as a whole are as follows: “At least 25 
out of 100 children of the white population of our country who 
enter school stay only long enough to learn to read simple 
English, write such words as they commonly use, and _per- 
form the four operations for integers without serious errors. 
A fifth of the children (white) entering city schools stay only 
to the fifth grade.” (p. 9.) “I estimate that the general 
tendency of American cities of 25,000 and over is, or was at 
about 1900, to keep in school out of 100 entering pupils 
go till grade 4, 81 till grade 5, 68 till grade 6, 54 till grade 
7, 40 till the last grammar grade (usually the eighth, but 
sometimes the ninth, and rarely the seventh), 27 till the first 
high school grade, 17 till the second, 12 till the third, and 8 
till the fourth . . . . It will be remembered that the figures 
for public schools in the country as a whole are probably 
much lower than this.” (Same, p. 11.) 
Cause of elimination. — We must notice the causes of this 
elimination. Thorndike says, “One main cause of elimina- 
tion is incapacity for, and lack of interest in, the sort of 
intellectual work demanded by present ‘courses of study.” 
(Same, p. Io.) re further mentions poverty, without meas-

uring its influence, and the character of the population sur- 
rounding the school, which evidently includes a multiplic- 
ity of causes. He couples age with incapacity and interest. 
“Of the sixth or seventh grade population in Connecticut, 
the 14-year-olds are over one and a third times as likely to 
progress two grades farther as are the 15- and 16-year-olds. 
A child who does not get beyond the fourth grade by 14 has 
in Connecticut less than 1 chance in 30 of progressing to 
the eighth grade as against 20 out of 30 in the case of his 
brighter or more fortunate fellow who at the same age has 
reached the seventh grade.” (Same, p. 14.) 
The reasons Professor Woodward gives for the falling off in 
attendance are as follows: “First, a lack of interest on the 
part of pupils, a lack on the part of the parents of a just 
appreciation of the education now offered, and a dissatis- 
faction that we do not offer instruction and training of a 
more practical character.” He goes on to say that boys 
and girls in the energetic period of 12 or 15 years of age 
find their controlling interests in doing things. ‘Their con- 
trolling interests are not in committing to memory the 
printed page; not even the arithmetic serves to reconcile 
them to school hours and school duties. They long to grasp 
things with their own hands; they burn to test the strength _ 
of materials and the magnitude of forces, to match their 
cunning with the cunning of nature and of practical men.” 
The price of textbooks, after the fourth grade, is a great 
obstacle to the parent who wants to keep his child in 
school. 
Professor Woodward would therefore find a remedy for 
the non-attendance, first of all, in making the schools mean 
something practical for life; and secondly in the introduction 
   
-P-A-G-E-55
  
EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL 47 
of the free textbook system, at least in the elementary 
grades. 
Prof. C. R. Henderson, writing of the causes of crime, 
says: “It is almost certain that the custom of confining 
growing boys to the mere conning of book lessons frequently 
irritates and maddens them, excites disgust for studies which 
seem to have no relations with their lives, and gives their 
muscles nothing to do. One thing shines out clearly from 
the record thus far studied: that the lack of instruction in 
manual and trade processes and of personal, moral, and 
spiritual influences must be charged with much of the ten- 
dency to crime.” (Dependents, Defectives, and Delinquents, 
By 250.) 
The commission appointed by the Governor of Massa- 
chusetts to “investigate the needs for education in the 
different grades of skill and responsibility in the various 
industries of the Commonwealth,” and “how far the needs 
are met,” held twenty public hearings in all parts of the 
state. ‘The homes of children between fourteen and six- 
teen years of age, now at work, and the industries which 
they enter, were investigated —the study embracing a 
total of nearly 5,500 children in over 3,000 homes, and over 
350 separate establishments, representing 55 industries, 
The salient features of the commissioners’ conclusions are 
that the first years of the employment of those children who 
commence work at 14 and 15 are often waste years; that 
the children leave school because neither they nor their 
parents see any practical value in remaining there, but that 
a large majority of the parents could afford to keep their 
children in school for a year or two longer, and would do 
so if they had the opportunity of securing a training which 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  
48 THE EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
would make for industrial efficiency. This latter conclu- 
sion is of course based on an analysis of the income of 
the families, their intelligence and thrift.” (The Outlook, 
May 19, 1906. Report of the Commission on Industrial 
and Technical Education, Boston, 1906, 'p. 18, especially 
pp 86 ff.) 
The importance of interest. — Professor John Dewey, in 
his work on education, locates the chief defect of the school 
in its inability to furnish the conditions which bring out in 
children the needed motive. He says: “A society is a 
number of people held together because they are working 
along common lines, in a common spirit, and with reference 
to common aims. The common needs and aims demand 
a growing interchange of thought and growing unity of 
sympathetic feeling. The radical reason that the present 
school cannot organize itself as a natural social unit is 
because just this element of common and productive activ- 
ity is absent. Upon the playground, in game and sport, 
social organization takes place spontaneously and _inevi- 
tably. There is something to do, some activity to be car- 
ried on, requiring natural divisions of labor, selection of 
leaders and followers, mutual codperation and emulation. 
In the schoolroom the motive and the cement are alike 
wanting. Upon the ethical side, the tragical weakness of 
the present school is that it endeavors to prepare future 
members of the social order in a medium in which the 
conditions of the social spirit are eminently wanting.” 
(School and Society, pp. 27-8.) 
Quotations si opinions supporting the proposition that 
mere academic studies are insufficient to secure the inter- 
est and attendance of growing, vigorous children could be       
     
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL 49 
multiplied. The above are regarded as competent and 
illustrative. The evident task of the teacher and educator 
consists in establishing those conditions which inherently 
arouse the interest and consequently hold the pupils in 
school during a sufficiently educative period. It is believed, 
upon theoretical and experimental grounds, that the introduc- 
tion of the practical motor element into school work largely 
supplies the vitalizing conditions. No doubt the simplifi- 
cation and rationalizing of the academic subject-matter 
would be of wonderful assistance in securing those condi- 
tions. Also, the utilizing of the group sentiment and 
codperative tendency would be valuable agencies to accom- 
plish this end. 
The last two points will receive extended treatment later 
in this work. Let us here note a few facts bearing on the 
first point, that of practical activities. 
Speaking of the benefits of the school garden, the princi- 
pal of the Carp (Ontario, Canada) public school writes as 
follows: 
“Tt is impossible to overestimate the value of school gar- 
dening on our boys and girls. Instead of being detrimental 
(as at first supposed) to their advancement in the other 
branches of learning, it has had the opposite effect. Since 
engaging in the work my boys and girls have been first in 
all examinations, competing with children from other 
schools, including city schools. The whole tone of the 
school has been improved morally, socially, and esthetically. 
Our boys and girls have now a reverence for life unknown 
before, and it has awakened in them, as nothing else could 
do, a deeper interest in all life around them. It has helped 
to make school life a pleasure. Now the boys make the
-P-A-G-E-58

excuse to get to school instead of the excuse to remain at 
home. It has aroused the interest of the entire community. 
The parents tale a pride ‘in our boys and girls in the 
school garden,’ and never fail to bring their visitors to see 
the work that is being done there. The pupils learn practi- 
cal gardening, and already their advice and assistance are 
often sought by parents and others interested in the cultiva- 
tion of plants. Its influence is seen also in the homes of the 
pupils. Every home has its collection of house plants inside 
and its plot and flower borders outside. Our school board 
has come to realize the value of this work and is anxious to 
have it fenton” (National Education Association Rep., 
1907, P- 423.) 
Actual experience with industrial education in the schools 
of Menominee, ae evidences the drawing power 
of vocational training. The superintendent of schools, Presi- 
dent Harvey of the National Educational Association, states 
in an address, that since the institution of industrial work 
there, the attendance in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades has 
doubled; that of fhe High School has increased 50 per cent; 
and that the High School graduating class has become over 
50 per cent males. 
The great ine of the masses in practical education is 
seen in response to vacation schools in the cities. For 
instance, in Chicago in 1904 eight vacation schools opened 
with over five aeons pupils. Several thousand children 
were turned away. In the Ghetto district admission 
tickets were passed on from child to child among the 
families, in order that all might be able to gain admission. 
The tual of these schools is based not on their so- 
called nature 1 “play-schools,” for they do more real

work than regular schools. Housekeeping, sewing, cook- 
ing, pottery-molding and baking, gardening, laundering, and 
manual training are taught. It is this productive nature 
of child and parents which is appealed to. (Editorial, 
Chicago Record-Herald, June 8, 1904.) The Chicago 
Inter-Ocean says of these vacation schools, “It is safe to 
say that more was never done in the same length of time 
toward the making of good citizens.” The schools all 
testify that little discipline is necessary. The unruly child 
finds his salvation in work.

SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
CHAPTER IV. SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL* 
I. THE ROLE OF THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 
Ir is evident, to the sociologist at least, that the social 
environment is the dominant factor for determining what 
educational training shall be. Hardly any builders of 
educational systems at any time have wholly disregarded 
the world the educated being is to live in. At best, however, 
the close dependence of the person on the nature of the 
social world has been seldom appreciated, Pestalozzi saw 
it vividly, viewing education as he did, as a means of 
reforming human society; but the accretions of formal 
pedagogy later buried his insight. More recently, the 
psychology of the individual has offered the basis and 
determining factor. But general or individual psychology 
gives as false a view of the person as the geocentric theory 
gave of the solar system. 
Before we proceed to the specializing character of the 
social environment relative to individuals, it will be well 
to view the general bearing of society on the lives of men. 
Only those factors or phases which have been historically     * The larger part of this chapter appeared in the Amer. Jour. of Soci- 
ology, September, 1908, under the title, “ The Sociological Warrant for

operated in determining what men should be, as men, will 
come in for consideration for most part. Some others, 
which perhaps might be considered quite as important, 
receive treatment later in the volume, because their appear- 
ance in the later connections seemed to be demanded. 
While much emphasis is placed on the specializing character 
of society, as bearing on education, ,it is not intended that 
conclusions for education from the general force of the 
social environment should not be made. If the social 
environment is so profoundly important in determining 
the constitution and destiny of individuals, it should cer- 
tainly be accorded a large place in the philosophy of educa- 
tion. It also follows that the study of society in the schools 
is deserving of greater emphasis. 
Ethnological aspects. —’Those who make the science of 
human society their business, and who are familiar with the 
beginnings of institutions, and with the development of 
collective life, agree that man as we know him, man as a 
highly personalized being, is the creation of associational 
existence. ‘The class of scientists whom we know as ethnol- 
ogists are able to trace the existence of human beings far 
beyond the period of recorded history into the Quaternary 
geological period. (Kean, Ethnology, p. 55.) The earliest 
cultural stage existed then. Man used the rudest stone 
implements. He was scarcely more than brute. Beyond 
that time it is believed he was developing out of the plane 
of brute existence. Thus there have been ages upon ages 
in which the personality and achievements of what we 
know as modern or civilized man could develop. 
Professor Giddings (Principles of Sociology, pp. 221-229) 
has marked out in a most illuminating manner how it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
a 
| 
aden DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
that man became a thinking animal. In his estimation 
the power to think, the power which elevates man so far 
above brute existence, grew in connection with the formation 
of language. Brutes have the beginnings of language, but 
have not developed it into symbols which may be used to 
express ideas freely. It was left to man to develop sym- 
bols. As fast as he did so he was empowered to think, 
and was stimulated to further intellectual endeavor. His 
mind grew with and as fast as his language structure and 
vocabulary. 
The primitive man has few words and consequently few 
ideas. The average man to-day possesses a vocabulary 
of many on 54 
nds of words, and consequently has a 
greater advantage in ideation and expression, But it is to 
be remembered that both of these wonderful acquisitions 
came about through association. Men living together had 
to communicate in order to codperatey Signs and symbols 
sprang up to enable them to communicate. Ideas and 
refinements of thoughts ensued. Hence, one may truly 
say that the mental powers and the communicating system 
are social products. 
Professor W. I. Thomas makes an interesting contribu- 
tion to the position that the social environment is the es- 
sential determining factor. He has conclusively shown 
(Forum, Decemb 
p- 171 ff) that 
white race and 
is not accounted er, 1904, and Source Book for Social Origins, 
the difference in attainment between the 
ore or less backward peoples of the world 
for on the supposition that the white brain 
has developed either in size, weight, or constitutional ar- 
rangement; for Chinese and Japanese brains are as large, 
and individuals of inferior races, when trained and drilled 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 55 
as thoroughly as whites, show equally advanced powers 
of skill, perception, inhibition, mentality, interest, etc. 
The difference is really the result of differing social condi- 
_ tions, the “social inheritance” of Professor Baldwin. That is 
to say, it is this social inheritance which has been thousands 
of_years-in-building,— incrementing a little each generation 
until, it has become an entirely different environment for 
the civilized from that which the uncivilized inherit and are 
reared in; it is this medium of knowledge, ideas, methods, 
inventions, etc., which is brought to bear on the white child 
in his education and experience that makes him seem so 
much superior, mentally, to the savage or semicivilized. 
“The fundamental explanation of the difference in the 
mental life of the two groups is not that the capacity of the 
brain to do work is different, but that the attention is not 
in the two cases stimulated and engaged along the same 
lines. Wherever _society furnishes copies and stimulations 
of certain kinds, a body of knowledge and a technique, 
practically all its members are able to work on the plan and 
scale in vogue there, and members of an alien race who 
become acquainted in a real sense with the ‘system can work 
under it. But when society does not furnish the stimula- 
tions, or when it has preconceptions which tend to inhibit 
the sum of attention in given lines, then the individual shows 
no intelligence in these lines.” This may be illustrated 
in the lines of scientific and artistic interest. : 
Among the Hebrews a religious inhibition — “Thou 
shalt not make unto thee any graven images” — was suffi- 
cient to prevent anything like the sculpture of the Greeks; 
and the doctrine of the resurrection of the body in the early 
Christian Church, and the teaching that man was made 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  i} 
56 sin ae DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
in the image of God, formed an almost insuperable obstacle 
to the study of human anatomy. This prejudice and 
preconception, on the part of the early Church Fathers, 
inclined the most of them to proscribe the reading of pagan 
literature, the best in the world, and hence inhibited the 
production of Fesnie and development of education 
among primitive Christians. The modern Mohammedan 
hostility toward scientific inquiry comes out of the precon- 
ception that belie in God is all that is needed in life. So 
a disciple writes to a westerner, “Thou art learned in the 
things I care not for, and as for that which thou hast seen, 
I spit upon it. Will much knowledge create thee a double 
belly, or wilt thou seek paradise with thine eyes?” 
“The Chinese are a people of great intelligence and the 
greatest size of Lie of all races, yet all that equipment has 
been deflected because of the preconception that the dead 
past contains the sum of wisdom. They study long and 
intensely, but to the neglect of occidental science. They 
spend years in copying the poetry of the L’ang Dynasty, in 
order to learn the Chinese characters, and in the end cannot 
write the eine correctly, because many modern charac- 
ters are not represented in the ancient poetry. Their atten- 
tion to Chinese history is great, as befits their reverence for 
the past; but 8 do not organize their knowledge, they 
have no adequate textbooks or apparatus for study, and 
they make no clear distinction between fact and fiction.” 
Multitudes of ibs scholars are ignorant of the meaning 
of the history they read. All their higher learning is devoted 
to writing essays forever on their classics. No better 
illustration could be given to show how little acquaintance 
with ancient ig and ideals fits the individual so
-P-A-G-E-65
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 57 
engaged and engrossed with the business of the present. 
In fact there is ample evidence to establish the position that 
instead it really unfits him. 
Social constitution of man.—A further consideration 
would demonstrate that the same social environment is the 
depository of the influences which determine the peculiar 
personal nature of the individual, and that it mediates to 
him, in the same manner as it does the material, the finer or 
spiritual goods of life. Prof. J. M. Baldwin has shown 
(Social and Ethical Interpretation) in detail how human per- 
sonality is built up out of the material resident in the social 
group, through the interplay of the child with his colleagues. 
Let us notice some of the facts which indicate this social 
nature.* 
1. As a physical being no one is a mere individual. The 
molecular vibrations of the external world, which constitute 
motion, beat and play upon an organism whose strings and 
keys come down from unnumbered ancestral lines. The 
body is a product of thousands of crossings, of countless 
interbreedings of near and remote progenitors. This may 
be brought home to us by considering how rapidly ancestors 
multiply as we recede into the past. You, for instance, have 
two parents, four great-parents, eight great-great parents, 
sixteen great-great-great parents, etc. Or the fourth genera- 
tion removed, your line includes sixteen stocks of people, 
perhaps, or, it may be, one half as many races or even 
nations. The past physical individuals and races focus 
in you. You are a composite of all the past races and 
people in so far as they have intermingled. 
* Professor Baldwin is only partly responsible for these points which 
follow. But his work referred to should be read by all educators.
-P-A-G-E-66
  
58 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
2. In like manner, the individual partakes of the social 
cosmos in his mental constitution, by inheritance. The 
instincts and impulses even revert so far into the past as to 
relate him to the sub-human animals. So far as we are 
able to discover, the qualities of temperament, disposition, 
inclination, talents, and even genius arise out of and partake 
of the mental constitution of ancestral individuals. It is 
second nature to us when the child is born to begin to figure 
out, not only the physical similarities to the parent stocks, 
but, as the child grows, to attempt to account for peculiarities 
of character by identifying them with characteristics of 
relatives. What all do so naively the scientist does more 
systematically, until nothing is better established in biologi- 
cal and psychological scientific belief. 
3. Also our social inheritance, given us through customs 
and manners, and which we imbibe in family and race life, — 
our morals, —likewise runs back, and radiates laterally as 
well, into the past races of the earth. These mores which we 
have thus come by and which exist in us to-day are the prod- 
ucts of erosion, selection, and survival. Past social groups, 
with their customs peculiar to themselves, collided with each 
other in their wanderings. The process which followed 
upon this collision makes a large chapter in the sociology of 
conflicts. The fighting which took place is the least inter- 
esting thing. The long struggle of conquered and con- 
queror, of inferior and superior, as the races dwelt together, 
was bitter and profound. It was in this enduring period 
of race friction and amalgamation that the sets of customs, 
ideas, religion, and other characteristics underwent a 
transformation. The entire supply of neither party sur- 
vived. It was a matter of selection and survival. Its 
| 
|  
-P-A-G-E-67
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 59 
result was a total sum of group culture, considerably larger 
and more differentiated than that of either of the com- 
pounding groups. And if we reflect that this warfare and 
amalgamation between differing groups have been taking 
place time after time during the succeeding ages down to the 
present, we may conclude that our social inheritance, now, is 
a fabric composed of multitudes of group-culture strands. 
As a consequence, we are compelled to admit that since 
the individual is built up out of these threads of influence, 
as they are given him by his parents and teachers through 
language, ideas, example, etc., personality is largely a 
social product. The quality of personality is the outcome 
of the inherited physical strain, worked upon by the 
cultural or social inheritance influences, from the very 
moment the child is born. Race, physical features, and 
possibly temperament, tendency to ailments, potential brain 
power, and quality of determination are some of the factors 
inborn to be molded into shape. 
Probably none of these factors can be greatly changed. 
But without the molding and stimulating force of the social 
environment they would develop into a brutish animal only. 
The content, the intelligence, the mind and soul matter 
are grafted on or poured in by the influences of society. 
Hence personality rises as high as the grade of culture of 
the group to which the individual belongs. It also varies 
according to the type of culture of the group. 
Society as opportunity. —The most thorough and scien- 
tific account of the force of the environment has recently 
been given by Prof. Lester F. Ward in his Applied Sociology. 
It has commonly been held that heredity is the chief 
factor in the production of men of genius, and that genius  
-P-A-G-E-68
    
i 
60 sual a DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
surmounts all obstacles. Of course, in so far as it ac- 
counts for genius it will likewise account for all other 
grades of ability. In order to test the assertion that genius 
may rise superior to all obstacles, Ward makes a thorough- 
going study of the environment relative to men of merit, 
talent, and genius. He separates the environment into 
seven groups, physical, ethnological, religious, local, eco- 
nomic, social, and educational, determining the force of each 
of these in the production of men of merit in France and 
contiguous French regions from 1300 to 1825. 
By tables, ma Ds, diagrams, and analyses, which approach 
the matter from every conceivable direction and leave no 
way of escape from the conclusions, it is demonstrated that 
the cultural factor in the environment, —the opportunity 
of the individual to come into contact with the achievements 
of mankind in an appropriate manner, —is the prime 
condition to bring forward merit, talent, or genius. Urban 
regions are about thirteen times more prolific, on the average, 
in producing the meritorious, than rural regions. 
But it is not the mere density of population which ex- 
plains the difference, because many large cities are infertile 
of merit, while some small places, and the chateaux, have 
been more fertile than many large cities. ‘The result is 
that if France had the same relative fecundity in men of 
letters as Paris, it would have produced 53,640, instead 
of 6,382; if it had the same fecundity as the other chief 
cities, it would ti produced 22,060; but if it had only 
the same fecundity as the rural districts, the total output 
would have been 1,522.” (Lester F. Ward, Applied Sociol- 
ogy, p. 188.) | 
The explanation of this difference is due to a “group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 61 
properties”’ possessed by the fecund cities: “(z) Usually 
these cities have been centers of political, ecclesiastical, or 
judiciary administration, which confirms what we have 
previously stated relative to the influence exerted by the 
political and administrative environment. (2) These cities 
have furnished particularly numerous opportunities for 
cultivating the acquaintance of intelligent and scholarly 
men, owing to the presence of writers, savants, distinguished 
artists, a numerous educated clergy, a wealthy nobility 
devoted to letters, etc. (3) They have afforded important 
intellectual resources, such as higher institutions of learn- 
ing, libraries, museums, book stores, publishing-houses, etc. 
(4) Finally they have presented, relatively to other cities, 
a larger amount of wealth or at least a greater proportion of 
wealthy or well-to-do families.” (Same, p. 193.) 
As to wealth, its influence consists in the fact that it 
bestows leisure for self-improvement, without which ability 
would not be manifest. 
Material welfare dependent on social agencies. —It may 
be worth while to indicate the close relationship between 
the individual and his environment, and how the social 
apparatus is the mediating agency between him and the ends 
of all his wants and activities, even conditioning his dealing 
with the physical environment. 
A little reflection shows us that man’s most immediate 
dependence for realizing the satisfaction of his wants is on 
social agencies rather than on physical conditions. It is true 
that, ultimately, the raw materials of food, clothing, shel- 
ter, permanent forms of wealth, etc., have to be extracted 
from nature. But two things, at least, are to be observed 
here. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
First, social evolution has consisted in building up a net- 
work of agencies, structures, on the basis of division of 
labor and of occupation, which have rendered individual 
man the more independent of particular local and physical 
conditions, the farther civilization has proceeded. Three 
fifths of the population of the advanced civilizations, such 
as England and Germany, live in cities; and even one half 
of the population of a new country like the United States 
dwells in urban communities of two thousand or more 
inhabitants. The poorest of these inhabitants consume 
hundreds of kinds of articles they do not and cannot pro- 
duce. They actually produce nothing directly from physical 
nature. All they have are social products borne to them and 
retailed to them by social agencies. 
Even the atmosphere and climate, the freest of nature’s 
goods outside of meteorological conditions, are affected by 
social agencies. Therefore, to get at the original supply 
of materials for life purposes which nature furnishes, man 
depends on and gets the use of a vast array of intermediary 
social machinery. Social organizations of all sorts exist to 
cut him off from and to connect him with nature. He can 
no longer exploit nature as a free individual. Political 
organizations in the shape of government exist to limit his 
attack. Originally “free goods” have become “property.” 
Police courts and jails testify to this. Only supreme ex- 
ploiters, talented and lucky individuals, may now make 
onslaughts on mines, forests, and lands, and this is done by 
getting control of great social organizations. Individuals 
independent of social agencies do not exist in society. 
Second, the dominance of the social factor is seen in the 
fact that by means of social agencies, — improvements in
-P-A-G-E-71
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 63 
the way of inventions and technique, —the actual supply 
of material products in given areas to support life has been 
increased. The economic stages of society, such as the 
“hunting and fishing,” the “pastoral,” “agricultural,” 
“commercial,” “industrial,” are only names to denote 
improved social means of getting a greater abundance of 
food from the earth. The “industrial revolution,” together 
with the opening up of America, almost doubled the popu- 
lation of Europe in the nineteenth century. England’s 
inhabitants increased from 12 to 18 per cent each decade 
or from 8,000,000 in 1800 to 30,000,000 in 1900 (Fetter, 
Principles of Economics, p. 194). There is no visible limit 
to population. When raising food by agriculture fails of 
further increase, direct and rapid production by chemical 
processes promises to continue. 
II. SPECIALIZING CHARACTER OF SOCIETY 
Social structures and human interests. —If it is true that 
the individual is absolutely dependent on the social organi- 
zation for the satisfaction of his material interests, and that 
his personality is likewise dependent for its character on 
the spirit and reason resident in the fundamental technique 
of society, it becomes evident that education is unscientific 
and incomplete, in so far as it is not organized in view of 
the exact nature and pointings of society. 
_In order to get at the exact place education should hold 
relative to society, it will be necessary to discover the essen- 
tial relation of the individual to organized social life. I 
shall seek to show that the individual’s chief business is to 
participate in the process total society carries on, by means 
of functioning, in a more or less specialized way, dependent
-P-A-G-E-72
  i 
64 soca DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
on his ability aul training, through the specialized agencies 
of society; and that the cue to this life-functioning is the 
line of his dominant or life-interest in terms of the social 
structure. I shall use interest in the objective social sense so 
admirably designated by Professor Small (Amer. Jour. Soci- 
ology, 6, pp. 64-5; General Sociology, Chap. XIV), and shall 
think of the special organization of society as the outcome of 
interest at work, as he does (General Sociology, p. 233). 
It appears to me that the best way to get the correct 
idea of the relation of the individual to organized society 
is to fall back on the historical aspect. A review of the 
development of human society impresses on us the valuable 
perception that present social structures are, in origin, 
occupation groups, and fundamentally so in fact; groups 
which have grown up out of the persistent attempts of men 
to adjust themselves to each other, for the purpose of satisfy- 
ing diverging human wants, and primarily to realize their 
own life-necessities. 
When we trace the development of society from a sim- 
ple group or groups into a great social organization, we see 
that it has occurred by the growing differentiation of one 
group into diverse parts through division of functions; or 
by the consolidation of various natural groups, primarily, 
and then the differentiation of the consolidated mass into 
separate parts, classes, or businesses. We perceive that 
all of this, however brought about, has been established in 
order that the life and welfare of one and all might be better 
realized. With primitive men there were few wants, and 
hence few vocations. The matter of adjustment was simple. 
To follow custom and tradition was the essential. But in 
developing to higher stages, wants multiplied and no one 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 65 
individual could obtain the skill or facilities for supplying all 
of his wants; hence, separate vocations arose, in which one 
set of individuals prosecuted one line of business, another, 
another line, and so on. Persons of each vocation disposed 
of their surplus goods to others of other vocations that they 
might obtain the things not longer made by themselves. 
Classes likewise arose to supply functions and activities 
not productive of material goods, but needful to serving, 
regulating, and inspiring producers. 
These groups or divisions of businesses, each almost 
infinitely differentiated to-day, constitute the social structures. 
They form the framework of society. They are the social 
organization. They are interdependent groups, because no 
one is complete in itself any more than the nerves or muscles 
of a physical organism can exist as independent entities. 
Each individual who has a function to perform for society 
must use some one or various of these structures in order 
so to function. 
A necessary perception comes, by observing the growing 
differentiation of dominant interests of individuals, to keep 
pace with the evolving structures of society, and the 
reciprocal dependence of these interests and structures on 
each other. In savage society all members had about 
the same interests in about the same intensity. Both 
knowledge and economic activities were little divided and 
developed. Later, with the refinement of social functions, 
the vocational interests emerged. There appeared leaders 
and governors; men to control the spirits and to be the 
custodians of group traditions; those who should provide 
food and those who should fight. In time there emerged 
the fundamental lines of human interests, namely, the
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
political, the religious, the cultural, the economic, the 
domestic, and the sociability. 
Relation of individuals to structures. —In this develop- 
ment lie two important transformations. First, interests, 
with their corresponding occupation, become distinctly 
separated, so that certain persons express their dominant 
interests in a definite specialized vocation or profession, and 
by it they minister to the general social necessities or 
interests in this direction. 
Second, when society has expanded into national scope, 
and modern science and methods of industry have been 
introduced, each fundamental line of organization becomes 
so differentiated under the push of new demands that in- 
dividual interests may realize themselves vocationally in 
any one of its many phases; and hence there are many 
kinds of specialized servitors ministering to each of the 
dominant lines of wants of a national society. While we 
have the fundamental human interests still, and each interest 
expresses itself by means of special institutions or organiza- 
tions society has developed for that purpose, yet each kind 
of institution is constituted of subordinate organizations. 
Thus to-day we may say that every one in society is inter- 
ested in folitical activities; some more, some less. To 
meet the social interest and demands of this type, there 
exist the political institutions and organizations. They are 
a group, not merely one. They are complex, not Simple 
as formerly. In this group we have all the complicated 
machinery of governmental administration, legislation, and 
justice; political parties with their complicated organizations 
and agencies; constitutions, codes, and customs of law. 
Some men are fundamentally interested in political insti-
-P-A-G-E-75
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 67 
tutions, and devote themselves to some phase of political 
life, vocationally. All members of our society are interested 
in our political institutions, secondarily, in that a certain 
and definite range of their social needs finds satisfaction 
through them, and their wants are ministered to by the 
’ professionals in politics. 
In the same manner, the economic line of activities has 
become highly diversified. It is no longer merely food- 
getting and preparation, and that immediately. It is now 
extraction from soil, forests, mines, and waters of not only 
foods, but of all sorts of material to be worked up into 
thousands of forms to meet man’s expanded diversification 
of wants. It is the skilled and specialized preparation of 
all this raw material, in multitudes of varieties of factories 
and manufactories, for final economic consumption. It is 
the transportation of all this raw and formed material to 
and from mine and farm and factory and forest and thence 
to wholesalers and retailers. It is the wholesaling and 
retailing of this produce, raw and formed, to all buyers and 
consumers. It is the clerical, the financial, and the mana- 
gerial activities which go along with these various lines of 
business and make them possible. Anyone who makes a 
business of life in any phase of this complicated industrial 
field and labors to produce to the satisfaction of the eco- 
nomic wants of the rest of society is professionalized, spe- 
cialized, and vocationally economic. All other members of 
society are secondarily interested in his vocation, to the 
extent that their wants are to be satisfied through him. 
The cultural line of activities to-day is no longer simple, as 
it was in traditionary times. It comprises, in its organized 
scope, not only all systematic educative endeavors, but 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
also all informational agencies represented in press and 
platform, clubs, societies, Chautauquas, etc., and all 
esthetic agencies. The religious phase is likewise differen- 
tiated into ecclesiastical denominations and sects, societies, 
organizations, and clubs. The sociability line expresses 
itself by means of many kinds of societies, clubs, etc. 
The domestic institutions alone remain essentially simple.

In order that it may be clear what is the relation of the 
individual to the whole of society, by means of these groups 
of social organizations, the accompanying diagram is 
presented.
-P-A-G-E-77
  SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 69 
Let the circle represent the circumference which incloses 
the total society. A is an individual so placed that he is 
shown to be in relation to each institutional area. The 
spaces between the parallel lines, B ending in B’, C ending 
in C’, D ending in D’, etc., represent the great groups of 
organizations through which the dominant interests are 
realized. A has his vocationally dominant interest in B B’, 
and works through it chiefly. But at times he acts or may 
act through the others, his relation to them and his use of 
them being subordinate to the relation and use of his voca- 
tional line. 
In a more concrete way, it is possible to illustrate this 
differentiation of structures, and the setting aside of indi- 
viduals to represent them as specialized agents. This 
differentiation has proceeded more rapidly during the 
last 150 years, since the age of invention introduced the 
“Machine age.” 
Nearly all of our machinery has come into existence, has 
been invented during that time. The steam engine only 
goes back of it a little. Now, every important machine 
invented has called into existence a special set of workers, 
adding to the economic structure a new group. Perhaps it 
may create many new sets of special workers. Thus the 
invention of the locomotive brought in our great railway 
transportation system, with hundreds of kinds of specialized 
workers. It created locomotive engineers, brakemen, fire- 
men, conductors, section hands, station agents, car builders 
with a host of specialists, locomotive builders, with many 
classes of skilled workers, etc. 
Every great invention has proceeded in a similar manner. 
Think of the hundreds of thousands of patents the Patent
-P-A-G-E-78
  SOCIAL, DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 7o 
Office has issued. Many of them cover some great machine 
or utility which issues in a new calling. At the beginning 
of our nation none were issued. Hardly any inventions 
were then made. Now our government issues some 35,000 
patents per year. 
The accompanying diagram illustrates the growing spe- 
cialization of social structure. Most of the development seen

PRIMITIVE SOCIETY 
in the modern age is relatively recent. Just enough lines 
are drawn to indicate types of development. Thus, manu- 
facture breaks up into lines, each of these into skilled trades. 
The same would be true of the other economic phases. 
The same holds of the other fundamental structures,
-P-A-G-E-79
SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL qe 
The administrative branch of government, for instance, 
breaks up into departments and each of these contains a 
multitude of special kinds of work, or functions. 
Generalizations. — Several things are apparent at this 
point. First, society is a unity of specialized structures, each 
with a particular line of functions to perform which is neces- 
sary to its integral life, that is to say, the life of all the par- 
ticipative members. The perfection of this organic body, 
this unity of interdependent, codperating structures, de- 
pends on the completeness and validity of each of the 
fundamental structures and subordinate groups. Should 
any one line become defective, or too large or too small 
relative to the other lines of activities, the equilibrium of the 
whole would be disturbed and its life impaired. This 
means the impairment of all the other structures, and this 
in turn means the impairment of the lines of the individuals 
constituting these structures. ? 
Second, the trend of society is toward more vocations. 
Society is a very definite affair instead of being, as many 
suppose, a great hazy, inchoate, lumbering lump of human 
protoplasm, which may be butted into and attacked in any 
ill-considered and unspecialized manner. The significance 
of social evolution is that society becomes more and more 
specialized, breaks up into more vocations and divisions of 
labor, demands an increasing number of specialists to 
perform its functions. And looking to the future we must 
expect that this tendency is to continue, and even to become 
more intense as scientific and business methods and organi- 
zation expand and penetrate the mass. 
Third, in order to be able to adjust himself, that is, to be 
efficient, the individual must be specialized. Since society 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
has developed into a great organization of specialties, it 
insists that its members shall be specialized that they may 
take part in the integral social process. Just as the physical 
organism finds no use for the cell which is not specialized 
to act as muscle, nerve, blood, or tissue cell, but attempts to 
rid itself of non-specialized cells when they appear in it; so 
society demands that each of its constituent members shall 
be skilled and trained into fruitful contributors in some 
group of its special structures. The least specialized, such 
as unskilled laborers, tramps, hoboes, and idle rich, are 
either not prepared to participate in the vital processes of 
society by reason of being little specialized or else refuse 
to take part according to their training. Ability to adjust 
oneself means just the possession of the technique of a cer- 
tain structure or certain structures. These we have seen 
are occupational lines. Of course this does not mean that 
every one must be a social philosopher or scientist or entre- 
preneur. Specialization means skill and technical ability 
in a given line. To have a trade or a profession is to be 
in possession of this specialization. 
Education a specializing process. — The bearing of the 
foregoing on education must have become apparent, If 
education as a process is training for society, then we know 
what it should be and do. For we have shown that training 
for society can have no other meaning than fitting to par- 
ticipate in the actual social process, And this participating 
in the social process means the social adjustment of the 
individual through and by means of the actual agencies and 
structures society has developed. Only those possessing 
the technique of vocational lines jare fitted to make this 
adjustment.
-P-A-G-E-81
  SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 73 
The assumption of state education is that its training is 
necessary for citizenshipy that is, to be a valid member of 
societyy But since one can be such only as he is able to 
function in society, that is, work in society, according to its 
fundamental nature, and since society is essentially special- 
ized and vocational in constitution, it follows, that to make 
citizens in the best sense is to vocationalize themy make 
them able to further some dominant social interest,. To be 
unspecialized is really to be socially functionless, to be with- 
out a serviceable articulating position in the social organi- 
zation. Logically, all ranks of those trained at the hands 
of the state are imperatively adjured so to fit themselves, 
Otherwise the state taxes those functioning, those who are pro- 
ductive socially, to give a general education, which means an 
unspecializing, decentralizing, distracting period of diffused 
cultivation to those who consequently will be floaters and 
parasites, until by experience or further training they obtain 
a real working connection with society, When nine out of 
every ten children in the common schools of the United 
States are leaving school before the close of the elementary 
grades because of a lack of practical interest in the work 
now offered, it is high time that means for the betterment 
of the schools should be considered, 
If this view of education, as an undertaking by the social 
body itself to fit an individual to carry on smoothly in 
conjunction with others the work necessary for the highest 
and fullest life of all, is correct, the further idea at once 
comes, that since society is progressive, since social demands 
change from time to time, since each generation and age 
has its own spirit and ideals to realize, education cannot be 
a static, changeless scheme or system. It must be elastic
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Ss 
and progressive to be always effective. It must keep in 
harmony with the age. It must plant itself securely in 
the center of the social process and there abide in order to 
minister adequately to the demands of its master, society. 
It may be said that it is the business of leaders of society, 
and therefore a part of the duty and work of educators 
and educational systems, to act as regulators and conservers. 
There might be a measure of justification for such a 
view. Education has commonly held the position of a 
brake to social progress. Possibly the service is at times 
needed, yet seldom has evolution of society gone danger- 
ously fast. All the virtue there is in conservatism is just 
in keeping things from going too fast. 
But could we discover how education may be put to the 
real service of regulating and correcting the ills of collective 
life, and then could we prove ourselves skillful enough to 
actually make it work effectively, the event would mark 
a milestone in human progress. In no case must the attempt 
be made to direct social currents far out of their predisposed — 
and historically natural channels, however. This would 
be to defeat the laws of development. 
Thus to-day we are in a position to see that Rousseau’s 
proposal to educate the individual apart from society so as 
to give him a natural training, to make him a natural 
individual, would be quite an unnatural and preposterous 
method. We now see that we need to find how really to 
educate the child into collective, codperative life of the 
modern sort, and that our danger now is in preserving a 
formal process that defeats this object.

CHAPTER V. DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 
UNDER the development of the demands which democ- 
racy makes on education to-day, will be discussed several 
topics, such as coéperation and culture, which might be 
expected to appear in separate chapters. Yet as they are’ 
involved in the thought of democracy, their consideration 
here is justified. ‘ 
It will be discovered that both culture and the demands 
for vocationalizing individuals have been treated in other 
connections. Their treatment here is not an oversight. 
The idea of democracy touches both subjects on new sides. 
Here the emphasis is placed on rights. The demands of 
democracy grow in the measure to which rights of the 
people are developed. The masses have more rights than 
ever before. There is more democracy. This democracy 
demands more things for the masses. In a democratic 
society and age, education must be viewed, therefore, in 
relation to the rights of the people to have their fundamental 
needs met. 
Non-democratic features in education.—It would be 
unworthy of a lover of our public school system to fail to 
recognize the great influence there is in it, working for de- 
mocracy, from kindergarten to university. “It takes the 
child from infancy, brings him into contact with his fellows, 
induces, inspires, controls, educes him, until the age when 
he can codperate with adults in the working world. It is 
the most reliable socializing institution of a public nature. 
75

    76 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Raw material i thrown into this great hopper from all races 
and nations, and ground into an essentially common grist. 
It is the testimony of principals who have been in South 
Chicago for from fifteen to twenty years, that children of all 
the nations, with foreign tongue and strange manners and 
customs when they enter, go out from the eighth grade or 
the high school, the peers of their American associates in 
language and manners; essentially Americanized; even 
looking with contempt on their parentage and mother 
tongue. 
“This is the secret of our ability to assimilate great foreign 
populations with safety.” (J. M. Gillette, Culture Agencies 
in South Chicago, p. 47.) 
There are several non-democratic features in our educa- 
tional system. The aim here is to point out the more 
important ones. 
First, retention of the traditional element prevents the 
adjustment of education to community interests and 
individual needs. Our ideals and matter are largely tradi- 
tional. We carry alot of effete matter in the subjects 
taught in our schools, as will be shown in Part III. Our 
supposition has been that there is just one training, one 
culture or discipline, to be given to all. This has been 
imposed on all communities and all individuals alike. We 
have tried to fashion all according to one pattern. Evolution 
comes by introducing variation. We have tried to make 
all alike. If society becomes more and more specialized, 
and if education is to fit for society, our supposition has been 
false. We can be democratic and can realize the needs of 
persons and society only by readjusting matter and method 
of education to actual needs.
-P-A-G-E-85
  
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES © 77 
Our educational system can be regarded as democratic 
only when and in so far as all lines of knowledge and training 
are placed on a basis of equality of rating; so that individ- 
uals and communities may be able to select that training 
which their interests seem to demand, without being blinded 
and prohibited by purely traditional estimates in favor 
of some end or subject. At present we are far from this 
ideal. We are intensely conservative all up and down the 
educational gamut. Second, in so far as the higher insti- 
tutions make preparatory schools of the lower, they regulate 
the courses of the lower in their own interests and according 
to their preconceived opinions of education. It is coming to 
be widely felt by high schools that they have been sacrificed 
by universities and colleges. A true university would have 
a continuation course for every kind of training course of 
the next lower school. Its only business should consist in 
satisfying itself that the work of the lower school was worthy 
of credit. It should then admit to the appropriate course 
graduates from the accredited high school. The more 
liberal universities are coming to this position. Unfor- 
tunately, the majority are very conservative. 
In like manner, the high schools are slow to recognize 
that anything but traditional elementary courses are admis- 
sible to secondary educational credit. Generally they 
would stand aghast at the thought of admitting pupils 
vocationally trained. Unquestionably they should be ready 
to receive those with a good vocational training, provided 
the tools of learning are in hand. 
So long, however, as high schools can dictate the courses 
of the lower, and this dictation rests on a narrow, traditional 
and inelastic basis, our varied interests will not be able to
-P-A-G-E-86
78 oc DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
realize themselves through training in the elementary 
schools. Agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial 
communities are prohibited from training their youth directly 
in their own community schools for their own community 
interests. 
Third, in so far as the sexes have different functions in life 
by reason of sex differences, and yet are given identical 
training, our schools are undemocratic. This will find 
more extended treatment in a separate section. 
Fourth, monarchical control of the schools on the part of 
the teachers, along with the examples it sets and the suppres- 
sion it involves, is undemocratic. This also is treated later. 
I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DEMOCRACY 
If there were anything in democracy for the schools, 
educators should know it. The exposition of the principle 
or principles of democracy will show us whether or not our 
schools are doing all they should to instill its spirit and aims. 
Some attention must be given to finding the central ideal 
of democracy. The historical perspective will best reveal 
what its central idea is. 
The present democratic movement. — We are witnessing 
a revival or a rebirth of democracy. Many are the indi- 
cations of its regeneration. The term “democracy” is so 
often used that we might easily guess it serves as the tocsin 
of the age. 
There is growing up a vast literature devoted to the 
discussion of the subject in its many phases. The books 
written on it are becoming numerous, and the space devoted 
to it in our periodical literature is enormous. Speeches in 
the political arena and legislative assemblies abound with 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 79 
references to democracy and appeals in its behalf. Teachers 
in schools and colleges are expounding its principles and 
holding up its ideals to their students. Pastors and lecturers 
vie with them in its advocacy. 
Certainly, in our own land, there never has been a time 
when the subject of democracy received so much attention 
on the part of the mass of people. At the time of the War 
for Independence some of the principles of democracy 
were clearly recognized by certain of the foremost leaders. 
But they thought of it as chiefly political in its nature, and 
most of the leaders then mistrusted the ability of the common 
people to participate in and conduct government. Our 
forefathers were bound by prevailing aristocratic views. 
Our country has moved far along the road toward democ- 
racy since then. The states in the “West” filled up after 
the Revolution. The people settled there as equals because 
all could get independence in ownership of land. Hence 
the state constitutions recognized their equality and gave 
all adult males equal rights. This forced most of the Atlan- 
tic states to liberalize their constitutions in order to hold their 
people against migrating westward. While our national 
constitution has not changed, except relative to the negroes, 
our state and local governments have grown constantly more 
democratic. 
The people have tested their power to conduct their af- 
fairs. They have succeeded and demonstrated their ability. 
They believe in themselves and believe that their safety 
lies in self-government. In the present period of great 
issues and grave abuses, the great leaders of the people 
are seeking to bring about a change in government, by 
which the masses may have still larger control of state
-P-A-G-E-88
    
80 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
matters; and the people are responding. Democracy is thus 
receiving a fresh impetus. 
It could be shown how many other nations are awaking in 
a similar manner to the call of democracy. The great 
nations of Europe, although most of them are monarchical 
in form, are democratic in fact, and are passing decade 
by decade further into the hands of the common people. 
Russia has had its revolution, and is slowly emerging into 
a constitutional rule. Turkey has just had its revolution, 
and is on a constitutional basis. Persia seems to be making 
the passage. China has a commission at work studying 
the governments of Europe and America, and instructed 
to draw up a constitution for that nation. New Zealand 
and South Australia have surpassed all the other states of 
the world in making the government serve the needs of the 
citizens. It would be difficult to find any convincing proof 
that this world-wide tendency to democratize governments 
is likely to be reversed. 
Much which might be said in this part will be found in 
various portions of Part III. Especially what is said in 
that later connection on moralization and on the socializa- 
tion of history expresses some of the most pressing and 
practical demands of the present time. Much of the matter 
included under those two topics might very well have been 
organized into a separate chapter under this present part, 
and designated, “Civic Demands.” 
The broader meaning of democracy. —A survey of his- 
tory, from ancient to modern times, shows that the develop- 
ment of human society has been in the direction of more and 
more democracy. There may be several prominent his 
torical ends. It depends on what we have in mind as to what
-P-A-G-E-89
  
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 81 
goal we actually see. Hegel saw history working out free- 
dom; Paul found it in righteousness; Christ in the brother- 
hood of man. All these conceptions are more or less inclu- 
sive of one another. The other ends mentioned would not 
exclude democracy. In fact they all implicate it. On the 
other hand it involves them. I believe that complete right- 
eousness, or freedom, or brotherhood would in all essen- 
tials mean complete democracy. 
The broader significance of democracy may be seen by 
the enumeration of some of the gains in democracy. First, 
politically, the masses of people have grown steadily into 
larger control of governmental matters. Athenian democ- 
racy, democracy’s highest form in ancient times, would stand 
in a poor light to-day, if compared with that of even such 
modern monarchical nations as Great Britain and Germany. 
The Athenian democracy was a very limited affair. Only 
those of Greek descent could vote and hold office. A large 
portion of people were slaves, and of course not possessed 
of either civil or political rights. Moreover, foreigners who 
dwelt in Athens, and who chiefly composed the wealthy 
commercial class, could not vote, hold office, nor appear for 
themselves in court. 
To-day only the semicivilized and reactionary nations 
withhold political rights. Everywhere there are tendencies 
at work for universalizing political and civil rights; whereas 
in ancient times, quite uniformly, people were slaves, abso- 
lute subjects, or possessed of but limited governmental 
power. The growing ideal in enlightened states to-day is 
that government is and ought to be the agency for obtaining 
exact justice between men, and that to be this the people 
must have complete control of it. Thus we see direct
-P-A-G-E-90
   rt 
82 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
legislation in the initiative, the referendum, and the right of 
recall, spreading widely, especially in the United States. 
Second, democracy relating to material goods has in- 
creased. The evolution of society through slavery and 
serfdom is enough proof of this. That is, men themselves 
were once owned by others, or held as part of the estate. 
Men are now free. They may own property. All wage 
earners have property, in their wages at least, and can 
legally secure them. 
Moreover, the masses of people participate in the enjoy- 
ment of more material goods than ever before. Average 
laborers are better housed, fed and clothed than the nobility 
of a few centuries ago. Just now, it is true, there is the 
menace of corporations and concentration of wealth; but 
even this menace has brought discussion and agitation which 
have cleared the air. A vision of a more equitable division 
of the social income is appearing as the result. No doubt 
the people intend to secure their rights to the product of 
their toil, which means a better democracy in material goods. 
Third, there has been an extension of knowledge to larger 
and larger areas of humanity. Learning was once monop- 
olized. Priests and scribes were depositories of learning. 
They were the real aristocracy of intellect. The masses of 
people were profoundly ignorant, and of course were preyed 
upon ‘as a consequence. With the invention of the phonetic 
alphabet there was some extension of learning. With the 
invention of printing and the cheapening of printed matter 
the way was opened for a far wider extension. Later came 
public education, telegraph and news-gathering agencies, 
newspapers, libraries, etc. These are the agencies for 
universalizing knowledge. 
i
-P-A-G-E-91
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 83 
Now education is becoming compulsory. There are few 
bars to literacy. Enlightenment is viewed as the foundation 
of democracy, political and economic. There are premoni- 
tions that the state may so extend compulsory education 
that the children of the indigent may be supported in order 
to assure their proper schooling. 
The growth of democracy might be followed in other 
lines of social development, but these suggestions will be 
sufficient to illustrate the kernel of democracy. It might be 
said that complete democracy would be the people’s parti- 
cipation in all the essential satisfactions of life and their 
control of all fundamental social agencies by which those 
satisfactions are distributed. In brief, democracy is the 
people’s control of their own interests, and the making 
all social institutions meet their needs. Thus it is broader 
than the government, it extends to other phases of life than 
holding office, voting, and being sued in the courts. It is 
the principle of equalization of opportunity working in all 
important matters. 
Il. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF DEMOCRACY ON 
EDUCATION 
With the thought above developed in mind, let us pass 
on to a consideration of some of the more important requisi- 
tions democracy necessarily makes on education. 
Essentials of knowledge, physical environment. —There 
are some items which must be regarded as fundamental 
to a progressive, healthy life to-day. One phase of this 
knowledge deals with physical nature, and the other with 
social matters. Both constitute man’s total environment, 
   
-P-A-G-E-92
EIR Ae NES ET I MEE ee ER, TL tee TE ss Leen RPG es aes ah acme 
84 slic DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
All his adjustments must be made in these two direc- 
tions. All his problems meet him there. Certainly only the 
general and essential principles of these two great realms 
could be crowded into childhood. Even to contemplate 
this raises such a vast problem that many might be skeptical 
about its accomplishment. Another necessary line of 
information is a knowledge of the self which must adjust 
itself to those environments. The more extended notice 
of this item will occur in Chapter XII. 
Society has accumulated a vast fund of achievement, 
during the course of its existence, which it holds in its 
storehouses as an inheritance from the past. It belongs to 
no individual nor set of individuals as an estate, but to 
society as a whole, because no individual nor set of indi- 
viduals has created the achievements, much less have they 
conserved them, Therefore this treasure, far more pre- 
cious than the traditional Nibelungen treasure, belongs to 
all and is for all; and the fate of all, and of society itself, is 
dependent on its disposal. 
Lester F. Ward, in his application of sociology to educa-. 
tion, makes social progress depend on the universalization 
of the achievements of the world. All other problems in 
their ultimate solution are dependent on this universaliza- 
tion; for men can act independently, that is, rationally, 
on any given matter, only when they understand it in its 
conditions. If men knew enough about economics, politics, 
etc., they would soon be masters of the situation in their 
ranges of life. Sets and cliques and special interests could 
not juggle them out of their just deserts. 
In his Applied Sociology he establishes the fact that 
there are many more geniuses and talented than ever  
-P-A-G-E-93
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 85 
come to light; that these can mature and have matured 
only as they are brought in contact with the rich heritage 
of the past; that social progress depends on their discovery; 
and therefore that it is the business of education to bring 
the essentials, the principles of this practical world-knowledge, 
to the doors of every one. 
I agree with him in this fundamental position. To me 
the problem then becomes one as to the method of realization. 
To attain it, we should need to revise our standards of edu- 
cation vastly. .I think we should have to extend compulsory 
education to cover secondary schooling, at least. I think 
this should be our ideal to work up to. We spend about a 
billion dollars a year for national government expenses, two 
thirds of which is for military matters present and past. Yet 
we claim to be a great civilized and peaceful nation. Dare 
anyone face these facts and say we are too poor to give every 
child a high-school education? I believe, then, that we 
should advance our standards of education to that degree 
as rapidly as possible. 
As to the physical range of knowledge, we must readily 
admit that every one needs the chief ideas of nature. The 
striking difference between the ideas of savages and the 
enlightened members of humanity, now, is sufficient to 
demonstrate this. The savage knew nothing about the 
properties of objects, in the sense that they made up the 
very nature of objects. Whatever qualities they perceived 
in things belonged to the spirits which moved through them. 
Certain plants poisoned animals and men, not because 
poison was an inherent essential attribute, but because those 
plants were good instruments for the spirits to use to penalize 
the victims. Some plants were curative in diseases, but
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
not of themselves; only poe the spirits chose to work 
through them. 
So, not understanding the properties of objects, they could 
not conceive of nature, of a world, of a universe which 
existed because of the properties and relations of all objects. 
Hence, primitive men were the prey of superstition, and were 
haunted by unnumbered and unbounded terrors. Some 
conception of the concatenation of things, of their inter- 
dependence and coéperation in the production of phenomena, 
of the reign of law in nature, and of the dominance of cause 
and effect throughout, is necessary to prevent superstition 
and to give the outlook which is so essential to the grasping 
of modern scientific thought. 
When we consider the more directly and immediately 
useful, the principles of natural science are found to be 
necessary to the various great fields of achievement. Those 
of chemistry are at the bottom of steel manufacture, of 
sugar and oil refining, of knowledge of soils, of foods, etc. 
Those of biology are the basis of plant and animal culture 
in all of their many forms, of medicine, hygiene, health, 
and so on. Physics enters into the construction of all 
machinery, of architecture and bridge building, of civil 
engineering undertakings, and many of the phases of agri- 
culture, manufacture, and commerce. 
We can hardly conceive that anyone could be much 
above the unskilled class of labor, or, as a skilled worker, be 
pliable and constructive in his occupation, without having a 
good grasp of at least the principles of the science or sciences 
which underlie his special line of work. And the more of 
the principles of all the sciences he has obtained, other things 
being equal, the more progressive and efficient he will be,
-P-A-G-E-95
  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 87 
The essentials of knowledge, social environment. — 
There cannot be too much insistence on the proposition 
that our general social safety depends on establishing and 
maintaining a high level of intelligence about social matters. 
Some have taught that democracy depends on complete 
equality; others that it hangs on equality of. opportunity; 
others that it must come by equalizing opportunity in the 
shape of information. I believe it is now possible to realize 
the equalization of certain social knowledge which is essen- 
tial to realizing and preserving democracy in the state. 
The universalization of political and economic knowledge 
involved in our present issues and problems I am sure 
should obtain for the following reasons. 
In every age the rights of man are imperiled, whatever 
rights have been worked out up to that time for the masses 
of men. Each age presents perils in new forms. It is 
incumbent on the people at the time to obtain information 
of the conditions which surround them, to understand the 
tendencies which manifest themselves, if they are to discover 
the nature of the impending dangers. Suppose it is a 
matter of corporations. Railroads, for example, consoli- 
date; eliminate competition; regulate rates at will. All pro- 
ducers and consumers use the roads. The rates are in 
nature a tax on their goods. In so far as roads are abso- 
lute, they might ultimately take away the property of all 
patrons as rate tribute. Unless people are generally intel- 
ligent on railroad matters they will not be able to protect 
themselves. It is conceivable that one gigantic railway 
trust might form, which should not only dispossess the 
masses of their property, but reduce them to a form of serf- 
dom. (See Ghent, Benevolent Feudalism; and London’s

Iron Feel.) So economic equality would perish from the 
earth. | 
Likewise people must be informed on matters of govern- 
ment to preserve their political democracy. Thus, some 
time ago, they awoke to the fact that the nomination system 
placed government in the hands of bosses. Before they 
awoke they had been long misgoverned; with due informa- 
tion they moved for reform. The primary nomination 
system which is coming into use is the result. Now we are 
discovering that the United States Senate, the congressional 
committee system, our judicial system, and so on, need 
reforming. The abuses have existed before the discovery. 
In so far our political rights were withheld. Justice waits on 
adequate knowledge. Thomas Jefferson was well advised 
in asserting that democracy in the state could not be main- 
tained with popular ignorance. 
One task of education is to put the essentials of political 
and economic knowledge before the citizens of the future 
if they are to be capable of sustaining their political and 
economic progress. 
Significance and importance of moralization. — Moraliza- 
tion is that phase of socialization which brings the individual 
into conformity with the ethical ideals and needs of his 
society. We can conceive that a man might be cosmo- 
politan in knowledge, and yet use his vast information to 
promote his mere individual interests, so sacrificing the 
interests of others. Indeed, such individuals are not rare. 
If information is necessary to make the individual master 
of the situation for life- and work-purposes, ethical quality 
is just as essential to keep him from usurping the rights of 
other persons who are involved in the same situation.
-P-A-G-E-97
  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 89 
The importance of giving this element a place in the 
programme of training is generally conceded. The reasons 
may be briefly stated. First, many believe that character is 
the dominant end of education and that life is chiefly a 
school in which moral will is developed. Consequently 
society and all else exist for the sake of moral achieve- 
ment. There could be no doubt that those who support 
this view would give moralization a large place in the 
schools. 
Second, there is a side to social evolution which empha- 
sizes the ethical, or certain ethical relations as the goal. 
Historically viewed, as we have seen, progress has consisted 
in realizing a larger democracy. The great struggles have 
been for personal rights and equal opportunities. Progress 
may be measured in terms of material goods and the latter 
may condition rights and opportunities; but the end of 
development is the greatest satisfaction, of all sorts, for the 
mass of humanity. In line with this view a part of the work 
of education should be to further the work of humanity by 
giving a perception of and enthusiasm for these ideals of 
progress. 
Third, society depends on moralized people for its con- 
servation and protection. Immorality is anti-social and 
therefore destructive of that medium which is necessary to 
carry on the interests and life of the many. It is a matter of 
indifference here, whether character is viewed as an end in 
itself, or as a means to the preservation of society, chiefly. 
In either case, society depends on it for its continuity. 
These considerations are particularly pertinent now. 
Insurance graft, railroad speculation, bank wrecking, 
monopoly building by rebating, etc., are terrible object
-P-A-G-E-98
    90 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
lessons of the need of that morality which is built on a rever- 
ence for the rights of man, or the regard for the social 
welfare. 
Social rather than individualistic moralization needed. — 
The science of ethics is being socialized. It is coming to be 
seen that the content of the imperative should be made up 
out of social relations and processes. The inner voice, in 
the nature of its promptings, may be right, but it needs 
rectification in the light of the actual situation. Riotous 
individualism comes out of a lack of moral disciplining of 
this sort, and finds its license in partial and formal ethical 
codes. A reconciling and authoritative ethical ideal has 
been lacking. 
Teaching is needed which gives the habit of looking at 
individual conduct, not as a realization of stationary types of 
either individuals or society, but as related to a progressing 
community. ‘Whether we are aware of it or not, whether 
we approve of it or not, the human race is visibly gravitat- 
ing toward application of the criterion which the process- 
conception of life indicates.” (Small, General Sociology, 
p. 674.) “All the systems of ethics and all the codes of 
morals have been men’s groping toward ability to express 
this basic judgment: That is good for me, or for the world 
around me, which promotes the on-going of the social proc- 
ess. That is bad for me, or for the world around me, 
which retards the on-going of the social process.”” (Same, 
p. 676.) “Our judgment of conduct in association always 
tends to appraisal of it as good or bad according to its 
assumed effects upon the largest range of associations that 
we can take into account.” (Same, p. 682.) 
Baldwin demonstrates, in tracing the genesis of the child’s
-P-A-G-E-99
  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES g1 
social and ethical ‘personality, that his ethical judgments 
and ideals arise out of his adjustments to the social proc- 
esses of larger and larger groups which he comes to live in. 
(Social and Ethical Inter pretation, Chap. I.) 
The social view bases good conduct, right, duty, not on a 
fiat, a decree, a maxim externally imposed, but on the 
relation of the act to the thought of progress; that is, to its 
furthering or injuring the interests of those bound up with 
the actor in an interdependent group. Therefore a good 
man is one who does not injure the interests of others in 
his society but advances them by his transactions. His 
ideal arises out of his ideal of the well-being of the masses; 
and his action is weighed as to its effect on the largest 
social situation he can conceive. We may regard self- 
government and coéperation also as important phases of 
moralization. 
Moralization — training for self-government and co- 
operation. — Attention has been called to the long and 
broad movement of human society toward the realization 
of the larger welfare of an increasing proportion of the 
population. The conduct of government has passed over 
from the hands of the one or the few to that of the many. 
The undertaking of the many to regulate and carry on their 
affairs through government grows ever more elaborate. 
The consequence of this developing control of society, 
organized as the state, is that the masses assume greater 
responsibility. We have seen that the protection of their 
interests demands that the people must have a larger social 
intelligence. But they must have a training also in the 
exercise of their judgment about the decision of matters 
and the administration of affairs. The schools can give
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
a larger and closer knowledge about business and politics. 
They should also contribute to exercising the duties and 
responsibilities of government. 
A recognition of the great work the public schools have 
wrought need not blind us to the defects in the system. It 
might logically be inferred that a democratic people living 
under a republican government would not permit monarchy, 
even in form, to show itself in those institutions which are 
nearest to them and from which they should expect to come 
the greatest stimulus toward more liberal government. 
Yet it is true that in the average class room the teacher 
is wholly the legislator, judge, and administrator. There 
is little perception on her part that if the pupils are to 
become citizens in a democracy where self-control and 
self-direction are foundation elements, such citizenship can- 
-not be produced by subordinating them to one will during 
one half of their minority; by securing order through pas- 
sive obedience; and by altogether withholding from them the 
burdens and responsibilities of their own government. Over 
the whole land there has been little attempt made so to order 
the school, so to lead, help, and inspire it as to enable the 
pupils to participate in their own control. 
Quite as important as self-government is the ability to 
coéperate. The growth of society has been a growth of 
codperation of a certain kind. Primitive men early dis- 
covered the value of working together. Several men could 
overcome a large animal, thus protecting themselves or 
gaining an abundance of food, whereas one man would be 
powerless. A combination of strength would lift greater 
burdens, draw heavier loads, accomplish more work, than 
that of single individuals. On this principle, larger groups
-P-A-G-E-101
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 93 
of people could dwell together, armies could be put into the 
field, finally cities and states could be maintained. 
In modern times all great undertakings rest on the 
coéperative ability of multitudes of men. Intelligence to 
comprehend common plans and to carry them out is in- 
volved. Untrained savages could not take the place of 
civilized men here. Every train which carries passengers 
depends on the codperative ability of engineer, brakeman, 
fireman, conductor, station agents, switchmen, train dis- 
patcher, as well as on many others indirectly. Should one 
fail to do his duty, many deaths and injuries would likely 
result. The very existence, as well as the further advance- 
ment, of society is being determined by this kind of talent. 
But in a new and special sense, wrapped up with growing 
democracy in human affairs, is the need of placing emphasis 
on coéperative training. Democracy means coéperation 
of a very high order. Self-government means the power to 
create and judge the worth of plans and laws of human 
action, in addition to the qualification to carry out the 
orders of an overlord or master. The development of the 
government of the people, by the people, and for the people 
can but partly come to be a fact so long as the great mass 
of people can only blindly follow plans and laws made by 
the few. 
Democracy in business is a growing fact and is furnishing 
a motive for better preparation. In the sphere of business 
undertakings there has taken place a vast evolution into 
out-and-out codperative enterprises. In the United States 
multitudes of codperative stores, creameries and dairies, 
elevators, industrial establishments, and insurance institu- 
tions exist. Many are brought into existence each month.
-P-A-G-E-102
arc re et ee eee es Pee 
04 he DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Not all octled, to be sure, but the fact that the volume 
grows testifies to the profundity of the movement in that 
direction. Coéperative distribution in England does a 
business each year of something like $500,000,000. The 
value of codperative business in Germany and other Euro- 
pean countries is immense and steadily increasing. 
State enterprise also is entering the field of business; 
and the success of such undertakings is dependent on 
the intelligence and talent of the citizens for conducting 
coéperative enterprises. Various nations and states own 
and conduct railroads, telegraphs, postal systems, banking 
systems, forestry domains, and so on. Municipalities own 
and manage waterworks, lighting plants, street railways, 
parks, libraries, schools, etc. The profits and advantages 
of these state undertakings are distributed to all the citizens, 
and advance the good of all. The codperative spirit is 
needed to conduct the businesses already taken up, and 
those which will doubtless yet accrue. 
Codperation demands intelligent insight into the nature 
of the enterprise and the complexities of its working; a 
sympathy with the purpose, which is to distribute the ad- 
vantages and profits to those contributing their efforts as 
equitably as human wisdom can devise; and a discipline 
and self-restraint which enables those who give their 
strength and talent to the maintenance of the undertaking 
to sacrifice the present for the larger good of the future. 
A love of mankind, of justice, of the common good, in fact, 
altruism of the highest type is required for successful 
codperative effort. 
Right of vocational training. —Every individual should

DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 95 
ized society, to profit by its achievements, and to render it 
service according to the prescriptions of society itself and 
of his own nature. In full view of the facts of pauperism, 
poverty, and crime which abound and which sociologists 
have to consider, and also of the necessary importance 
of the industrial and commercial factors in modern society, 
I have no hesitancy in declaring that the first and foremost 
duty of society, through the agency of the schools, is to make 
every boy and girl fit to make a living by means of some 
special knowledge or skill which society has need of. This 
is called the “bread-and-butter” view of education by its 
enemies. They claim to think the adherents of this view 
see nothing ahead but the question of bread and butter. 
But no one would more insist than its exponents that other 
things should be considered as given in and along with a 
bread-and-butter training, such as information, moraliza- 
tion, appreciation, etc. 
I shall seek to show, in other chapters in this part, how 
fundamental the economic is in society, and, hence, for the 
life of the average man; and how the facts of crime and 
pauperism should lead us to a more practical training. 
And I have already tried to demonstrate that growing 
specialization in society demands a corresponding special- 
ization in the equipment of its members. All I shall do here 
is to accentuate the nature and force of these overwhelming 
demands society is making. 
We have no right to say “criminal,” “pauper,” “tramp,” 
until we know whether or not the training system which 
society puts the child through has been competent to equip 
him for life. Before condemning individuals we should 
consider if they are not products and victims of a system.
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
If the system he works in is against him, if it does not give 
him an ace equipment, it is withholding some of his 
fundamental rights; especially in view of the fact that it 
holds him responsible for his failures and deficiencies. 
Democracy in education insists that every valid interest 
in human society shall be recognized in the school system.

1900, with the number of persons following each group 
line. The lower group is not given in the census report as 
one of the vocational groups, but I have added it, after 
estimating the number so engaged from census figures. 
An inspection of the cartogram, with the thought of special 
training in mind, impresses upon us the fact that the top 
group, the smallest in number of all, is the only one for which 
society, acting collectively, self-consciously, and deliberately, 
has made provisions at all; or in any degree commensurate
-P-A-G-E-105
      
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 97 
with the dignity and demands of the service the group per- 
forms for society. 
We had about 30,000,000 workers as given by the census 
of 1900; one third were agriculturists, and we have per- 
mitted hardly a smell of the farm to get into the rural schools. 
There are over 7,000,000 manufacturing and mechanical 
workers, and we have given them hardly any recognition. 
We may say that nearly all of our workers have to depend 
on some form of the apprenticeship system to fit themselves 
for their social service. 
It is a matter of astonishment that society can get on at 
all, leaving these fundamental occupations to be recruited 
and enterprised in such an unscientific and slipshod manner. 
The case will not be satisfied until agricultural, industrial, 
commercial, and domestic workers (including mothers and 
girls in the homes in this latter class) have recognition in 
the educational system of the nation in the measure of their 
importance, and are given a preparation for the life society 
assigns them in itself which is commensurate with the im- 
portance and place of their calling. 
About the women in the homes, the 25,000,000 females 
between the ages of 10 and 75, something will be said in the 
next section. 
Training for women. — There is a portion of the commu- 
nity, which, in its psychological constitution, and in its eco- 
nomic division of labor, differs profoundly from the other 
portion. This part of the population is the female sex. A 
study of sex-psychology indicates a difference, in certain 
respects, between the psychical natures of men and women. 
Woman’s nature and constitution are woman’s and not man’s. 
She has interests, in fact het dominant interests, which are  
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
not those of man, and which rest back upon her physiological 
structure and function. Maternal instincts and _ interests 
arise out of sex physical equipment, and never can be de- 
stroyed, however much they may be perverted and outraged. 
In the economic division of labor which society imposes 
on the home institution there is the same discrimination 
between sex. The work and duties of man and woman in 
sustaining the home do not lie in the same direction and are 
dissimilar in form. Woman’s work for the home is home- 
keeping, food-preparation, and child-culture. Man’s fun- 
damental work is beyond the walls of the home in procuring 
its adequate support. In so far as homes are necessary to 
their supporters and to society, these offices cannot be 
exchanged or disregarded. Unless social evolution proceeds 
far more rapidly than there is present indication of its 
doing, so that the present home as an institution is sup- 
planted by some other which will set woman free from 
specialized domestic demands, we must expect that the 
majority of women in future will become wives and mothers, 
whose dominant privilege and duty it will be to perform or 
superintend the business of home-making and home-keeping. 
With the cartogram presented on page 96 before us, 
let us ask ourselves the question, “What are the public 
schools of America doing of a practical nature for those 
more than 25,000,000 home-makers and home-keepers to 
qualify them for their work?” This is a question we must 
face and for which we must begin to find some adequate 
. answer. It is fundamental to national life. 
National economy is dispensed in the home more than in 
any other quarter. The home-keepers are the spenders of 
family incomes. They are the purchasers of foods, clothing,
-P-A-G-E-107
  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 99 
furnishings. On their judgment and administration of 
finance household economy and happiness depend. 
If the wife does not know food values, worth of cloth, 
furniture, etc., if she is ignorant of accounts, and of the 
social laws of supply and demand, she is likely to be wasteful 
and extravagant. It is too much to ask of our women that 
they shall be wise economists and administrators, when 
their only training is that handed down by tradition through 
the homes. There is great work here for the teacher of 
economics and chemistry in giving practical lessons in the 
social and chemical values of consumptive goods. 
But family health, as well as economy, depends on the 
administration of affairs in the home. When it is remem- 
bered that the health of the family, the amount of energy, 
and the quality of mental effort its members have to expend, 
and the disposition and temper with which they meet the 
world, and which make up the enjoyment and contentment 
of life, depend on the selection, preparation, and preserva- 
tion of foods, and on the sanitation of the home, and that 
these things are in the hands of women, the importance 
of domestic economy may begin to be seen. 
And there is child culture and nurture which are even 
more important. What a place child study in its large 
and practical bearing should have in the schools; and all 
that is given is a little physiology, hygiene, and perhaps 
formal psychology in a few schools. The physical ability 
of our citizenship is established in early years. The care of 
the body, the choice of foods, the clothing, the little ailments, 
often decidedly vital, are made important because they 
condition life and mind. 
When we remember that one third of all deaths occur in 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  
  | 
100 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
the first years of life, as many as in the next nineteen years, 
and that all the early years are perilous by reason of diseases; 
and that the large number of infant deaths occur because of 
the ignorance of the parents, as is seen from the fact that the 
more ignorant populations sustain the greater disease and 
death-rate; the significance of knowledge in the physical 
phases of child culture is apparent. 
But the mind, disposition, and character, in their establish- 
ment, are even more important. Few women understand 
child psychology save in a superficial sense. The order and 
periods of mental growth, the demands of the mental nature 
in the various periods, the appropriate treatment and control 
to exercise in each period are commonly unperceived and 
ignored. We do not give half enough attention in schools 
to the science of calf culture, to be sure. We give none to 
child culture, in the way of making wise and responsible 
mothers. 
Child raising, like cooking and home-keeping in general, 
is about what it was generations ago. Yet child psychology 
and domestic economy are to-day actual sciences. And yet, 
too, we give our women, our mothers and home-keepers, 
no training in either. What enlightened and progressive 
people we educators really are! Our chief credential is the 
stamp of antiquity and tradition. We make our environ- 
ment an obstacle, rather than an aid, to fitting for life. 
Vocational education and the talented. —The objection 
has actually been made, against this democracy of training, 
that it does not provide for the genius or the person of 
talent; that education should be so general that it will fit any 
sort of genius or talented child for higher reaches. 
In making reply to this objection it is first necessary to call  
-P-A-G-E-109
  
DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES Iol 
to mind the nature of genius and talent. Let us use the 
word talent for brevity. I believe psychologists and soci- 
ologists are settling down to the idea that talent is more 
likely to be the outcome of balanced judgment and persis- 
tent will, working or concentrating in some given direction, 
than an idiosyncrasy of birth so that by natural abnormality 
or onesidedness the individual is fit to do but one thing. 
Galton’s idea, in his Hereditary Genius, is that genius 
surmounts all obstacles, that it is bound to find a way. If 
that were so one course of study would do quite as well as 
another, because, notwithstanding the course being against 
his idiosyncrasy, the person would surmount and go on to 
glory. So, a vocational course, such as we propose in this 
work, would be a mere bagatelle, as a matter of obstacle. 
And if talent were simply a larger higher level of mind- 
power, judgment, and determination, as most students of 
talent now hold, and our vocational course were in the way, 
it would be so small an obstacle, in Galton’s view, as to be 
unworthy of mention. 
But Odin and Ward, in their more recent and more thor- 
oughly scientific attempts to discover what the factors are 
which produce talent, reject the idea that talent shows itself 
in spite of all obstacles. In fact, they demonstrate that 
talent is dependent on environmental factors for its fertili- 
zation and revelation to the world. I have given the results 
under the section, “Society as opportunity” (p. 59), and 
refer the reader to that passage. ‘The woods are full” 
of potential geniuses, one for about every 300 persons, 
according to Ward’s findings. Our final conception of 
talent, then, must be that it is the normal mind raised to a 
greater power, and concentrating in some given direction;
-P-A-G-E-110
102 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
  and that it is dependent on the existence of cultural factors 
in the environment for bringing it out as does average mind. 
A second consideration would be the nature of the course 
of study itself, as to whether or not it would be obstructive; 
if it were true that talent could be obstructed. In connec- 
tion with this topic I invite the reader to consider Chapter IT, 
which deals with the school programme, to see if the broad 
groundwork in the informational, moralization, and appre- 
ciation elements is not a guarantee of a comparatively full 
cultural process; about as full, with the additional advantage 
of being organized and directed on principle so as to be more 
than ordinarily effective, as the level of work would afford; 
also to look over the proposed programmes in the last 
chapter of this volume (pp. 289-296) with the same purpose. 
In my estimation, a well-organized agricultural community 
course, for example, not only does not offer obstacles to the 
individual who desires to go to the educational top, but 
actually affords advantages in the way of a better and 
richer selection of cultural material; and a better organiza- 
tion principle, and consequent organization, than our present 
common course. The better cultural matter consists in sub- 
jects and matter which are more pertinent to the age and 
larger community life. Organization, of course, is the 
very soul of meaning. Chaos and lack of articulation are 
real obstacles. Education directed towards a well-defined 
end, and organized according to principle, is, in the highest 
measure, fitted to bestow meaning, significance, the soul of 
efficiency. 
But Ward shows that it is the utter lack of any sort of 
cultural element that is the obstacle to the discovery and 
the maturing of talent. Given any sort of an outlet, any

  DEMOCRACY AND ITS IMPERATIVES 103 
approximation of or connection with the great reservoir of 
the world’s achievements, which constitute culture, and 
talent finds its way into the currents of the world’s history, 
matures, becomes fruitful. And certainly vocational courses 
of all sorts afford such connections and outlets.

  CHAPTER VI. IMPORTANCE OF THE ECONOMIC 
INTEREST IN SOCIETY AND ITS SIGNIFI- 
CANCE FOR EDUCATION 
I. GENERAL SOCIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
In Chapter IV it was shown that economic activities 
constitute one of the great lines of achievement of organ- 
ized society. Something of the place and meaning of this 
line of interests was indicated. Some attention was paid 
to the importance of the economic, relative to other social 
structures, and the consequent significance for the end of 
education. 
In this chapter we want to expand this last thought. 
The attempt will be made to show that the economic inter- 
ests are the dominant ones to-day, and that the tendencies 
at work will make those interests still more powerful relative 
to others. This is developed as a basis for the conclusion 
that the economic should have large recognition in the 
educational system. 
Economics deals with wealth. We usually think of only 
material goods as wealth. But economists assert that 
anything is wealth which can be bought and sold. Hence 
not only material articles but services of men may be 
considered in economics. Anything that can be pro- 
duced or consumed and put on the market is therefore 
included. 
I shall exceed this meaning somewhat in this chapter, 
particularly in the last section, but for convenience I shall 
104
-P-A-G-E-113
  
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 105 
put even the matter of increasing the satisfaction of life under 
the caption of the economic. 
It determines motives. —The economic of course has 
always been a determining influence in society, whether 
men recognized it or not. It has been the power by which 
changes in human affairs have been consciously or uncon- 
sciously determined. Every student of history knows that 
transformations in society come about by reason of the 
inherent automatic, unreflecting forces, more than by rea- 
son of the highly conscious codperative effort of communi- 
ties. Men shape their affairs, oftentimes, under the sway of 
factors whose real determining effect on their own. minds, 
as they seek to decide matters, they do not perceive. 
The well-known case of the “ ministerial call” might be 
taken to illustrate this. It so happens that duty oftenest 
lies, or seems, to those deciding, to lie in the direction of the 
larger church and salary. We have to grant that ministers 
conscientiously weigh their calls. The fact that the out- 
come is as it is, merely indicates that the factors of larger 
salary and charge are really the determining factors in the 
recognition of a call to duty. So in matters of history, 
whatever motives and reasons men have assigned for trans- 
formations, careful consideration exhibits economic forces 
as at least largely producing the changes. 
Economic changes determinative of other social changes, — 
Society has, as its foundation, the satisfaction of physical 
wants. All other wants are built up on this and cannot be 
satisfied until these so-called lower wants are met. More- 
over, the higher employ material things with which to ap- 
pease their hunger. 
The amount of population a region has depends on the  
-P-A-G-E-114
    106 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
resources of the section. The locality must either directly 
supply necessary subsistence, or else must furnish resources 
of another kind which may be bartered for means of life. 
Thus England does not produce all the food it needs, but 
its mines and position are the basis of manufacture and 
commerce, by which the necessities of life are gained. 
The quality of a population is determined by the character 
of its economic activities. Industrial, mining, commercial, 
agricultural communities have aims, spirit, traits peculiar 
to themselves. The character and demands of the people 
depend on their vocational organization. Civilization awaits 
economic development. Spain has made more progress 
in the short time since her people began to be moved by 
industrialism than during several times the period in pre- 
vious times. 
Government is very largely the agent and register of 
business. The organized state, politically, stands for cer- 
tain and secure interchange of goods. An unjust govern- 
ment favors economic exploitation of the people by the 
favored few. A just government seeks to secure equality 
in the distribution of wealth. Legislation is the outcome 
of struggling economic forces. Laws register the wishes of 
the factor in political power with reference to wealth reg- 
ulation. 
What, in history, is called the “ industrial revolution ” 
may be taken as an illustration of how changes in economic 
conditions bring changes in other phases of society. It is 
only a larger and more striking case of what is constantly 
occurring. Perhaps no other event in history has made 
such vast changes in the trend and structure of society 
as has the introduction of the factory system and in general
-P-A-G-E-115
  
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 107 
’ the machine age. Wherever it has been established, it has 
overthrown the old order and has put into operation forces 
and tendencies which keep on working unforeseen results. 
This “revolution” began with the invention of a few 
simple devices a hundred and forty years ago. Since then 
industrial evolution has expanded and intensified the spirit 
and method then established. All around and everywhere 
the world of science, discovery, invention, and business is 
intensively and extensively developing the economic. We 
are bound to expect that in future there will be more of it 
rather than less of it. 
The industrial revolution made a new order of things. It 
changed men’s social and economic relations. It accen- 
tuated industry as never before. It gave birth to trans- 
porting and communicating agencies that easily and quickly 
-bound all nations together; and all parts of the earth were 
laid under tribute by a real world-commerce. It gave 
basis for enterprises which have grown world-wide and as 
powerful as states. It gave birth also to labor organizations 
as large and powerful as the opposing combinations of 
capital. Everything to-day converges toward, radiates 
from, is based upon, and is dominated by these changed 
economic conditions. 
Every calling rests on an economic basis. — Another 
consideration shows that the basis of every calling is eco- 
nomic. Even if we should take the theological conception 
involved in the Westminster catechism, we should find this 
to be true. It asks the question, “ What is the chief end of 
man?” The answer is given, “ Man’s chief end is to 
glorify God and to enjoy him forever.” With this high 
end of life in view, still the basis of realizing it in an active, 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    
108 tl DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
full, fruitful life, is a measure of wealth and leisure for self- 
improvement and for helpful service for others. Thus, 
ministers, lawyers, artists, physicians, teachers, officers have 
to “ work for a living,” whatever else they may work for; 
and their living depends on their value to society which is 
rated in wages, fees, or salary. 
Mr. Ward demonstrates that wealth has been the founda- 
tion of success among French-speaking people from 1100 to 
1825. Thousands of talented men and women within 
those centuries are studied. It is found that until approxi- 
mately the 19th century is reached, the wealthy classes, 
particularly the nobility, furnish about all men of talent. 
This is not because potential talent is confined to that class, 
but because the rest of mankind had to work so incessantly 
to make a living that they had no time or opportunity for 
culture. 
The same is held by sociologists to be true of all races and 
people until relatively recently. In Greece it was the leisure 
class, and that means the wealthy class, who owned slaves 
to make their living, which furnished the artists, the men of 
literature, the philosophers, and the statesmen. In Rome the 
same was largely true, although the situation was qualified 
by the fact that Rome made slaves of many of the cultured 
Grecians who made intellectual contributions in that nation. 
Since the beginning of the roth century, leisure or the 
opportunity to study, to improve oneself, and to become 
intellectually productive has become more widely distrib- 
uted; and hence all the social classes are contributing to 
human achievement. This has come about because hours 
of labor have been shortened, the relative wages of the 
workers have increased; and free public education brings 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY  Io09 
the tools of learning to all, so that an able worker may 
improve himself, 
It is his power to make his living and to garner some 
leisure time which is the foundation of his literary, artistic, 
scientific, inventive, or other kind of productive work. And 
the more efficient he is in his calling, the better his training 
and skill, the greater will be his emolument and his power to 
command the time and circumstances necessary for the 
prosecution of his “higher” aim. This holds, as well, of 
those who desire to carry on benevolent and altruistic work 
of any sort. Such persons must be economically independ- 
ent, must be wealthy so that they may undertake the de- 
sired activity or must earn enough in some way to give 
themselves the time and the means to execute their plans. 
II. IMPORTANCE AND INTENSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION 
Importance. — Production consumes most of the social 
energy. — Production is the chief phase of economics, At 
least, it gets the most attention in the texts. It covers all 
the processes of wealth, from the time an article begins to 
be made until it gets to the consumers or users. Goods are 
really not completely produced till the users get them. So 
the transfer, the transportation, and the marketing of goods 
are included in production; as well as the making or grow- 
ing or mining of them. 
This work of production of goods and services consumes 
most of the energy or force of human society. Society, like 
the human body, has just so much energy to spend in the 
way of effort. A man has so much power to spend in each 
of his tasks during a day or a year. Thus a farmer plows 
ten hours a day, chores two, prays a few minutes, and eats
-P-A-G-E-118
    
IIo Hokias DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
an hour or two. He finds about this proportion of time is 
the most economical and necessary. Most of his energy 
goes to production. 
We may view society as a big organism, having just so 
much energy at its disposal, and so many tasks to perform. 
Like the farmer the most of its force goes to creating things 
to use. This distribution of its time and effort among its 
various tasks it finds necessary and the most economical. 
This actual fact of distribution may be seen from the 
following data. The occupation groups show us in what 
way the social energy is spent.

Of all these workers we are surprised to find how few, 
comparatively, are engaged in cultural and spiritual social 
services. This further analysis indicates this:

Pe ee en ee 
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY III 
have grouped as cultural workers equal about one thirtieth 
of all workers. If we include the former, the latter drops 
to a ratio of about one fifty-fifth. 
The total number of those who render “ service,” as dis- 
tinct from the workers who are directly engaged in the 
production of material things, is found in the sum of the 
second and third groups of the first of the above tables, 
a total of 6,956,483 persons. 
There is little reason, however, to make the above qualifi- 
cation. Most of the workers are performing services on 
which those directly engaged in material production depend, 
and without which many would not be able to be material 
producers. Actors and musicians inspire and rejuvenate 
tired workers, so that they are able to keep to their work. 
Preachers, authors, and journalists give the stamina and 
character which enable them to bear heavier strains and 
responsibilities. Physicians keep them well or restore them 
to working strength. Teachers and professors train the 
intelligence which makes possible the great complex under- 
takings of modern society. Those engaged in most of the 
domestic and personal service activities perform functions 
which the worker might have to assume otherwise, and 
are thus contributors. Officials carry out government, so 
necessary to providing services and preserving that social 
order on which all productive enterprises depend. 
We should likewise take account of the 25,000,000 females 
who do the home-keeping for all the workers engaged in 
the more obvious and public work of the world. Food, 
refreshment, rest, the inspiration and strength which come 
from sympathy and affection, consolation, encouragement, 
all these things which are such vital factors in keeping up the ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    
II2 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
working machinery of humanity, are some of the services 
which these unrecognized aids to production contribute. 
We perhaps should say that 95 per cent, probably more, 
of the social energy is used up in prod uctive work. That 
means it is vocational. Making a circle to represent the 
total social energy, the consumption of the latter would 
appear as in the accompanying diagram

to demand special training of our schools. If we can further 
show that economic activities are orn intensified, that 
1 they are receiving more rather than ss stress, that they 
are making greater demands on the workers in the way of 
specialization and skill, the lesson for education is obvious. 
If an investigator or visitor from an outside world should 
visit the earth to-day, and should seek to find what is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 113 
prevalent motive of the age, he could hardly escape the 
conclusion that the dominant spirit of occidental civilization, 
at least, is industrial and hence commercial. It is true that 
not all western nations are equally well equipped or ad- 
vanced to respond to this ideal; but it is equally true that 
even the most backward are feeling the impulse and stirring 
with life to move into industrialism. - 
Whatever form the spirit of civilization may have taken 
in the past, it now garbs itself as commercial expansion and 
dominance. If to-day a nation colonizes, or if the nations 
seek to partition China among themselves, it is in order that 
in the colonies or in the “ sphere of influence” falling to 
each, they shall be dominant in trade; or if a nation stands 
for the “‘ open door,” it is that she desires to gain equally 
free access, at least, for her commerce with the other 
nations. Whereas, formerly, inferior people were exploited 
by repression, restriction, and outright robbery on the part 
of superiors, now they are cultured, cultivated, encouraged, 
peradventure, in order that the greater productive output 
may flow into the commercial channels of the dominant 
superior. 
Most of this is good. It builds up the waste places of 
the earth, civilizes and enriches all peoples, makes for 
world peace, and rapidly draws together, by various inter- 
national bonds, all the parts of the world into a compact 
interdependent federation. (Reinsch, Colonial Government, 
Chap. I.)

said in an interview: “ Japan and the United States will 
be strong friends. Wars are fought for commerce, peace is 
made for commerce. A commercial alliance is the strongest 
of all alliances.” (Chicago Record-Herald, Sept. 11, 1905.) 
Pressure of population on resources. — The subsistence 
of the human family depends on two things —the total 
amount of arable land, and the intensiveness of cultivation. 
The population of the earth has pushed ahead, until within 
the older nations extra land is no longer available; and 
between the nations there is severe competition to secure and 
to exploit the less occupied lands. Intensive cultivation 
in the older regions has been crowded severely. It offers 
large increase, yet cannot be indefinitely elastic and expan- 
sive. The law of diminishing returns holds ultimately. 
There is decreasing natural wealth. For instance, the 
forests of the world are receding rapidly. We are engaged 
in cutting timber at the rate of 25,000 acres per day, or 
40,000,000,000 feet board measure per year. In three years 
following 1900, the wood worked up into paper pulp in- 
creased almost 300 per cent. And it takes thirty years for 
a spruce tree to grow to serve as paper pulp. 
Timber for railroad use has become so scarce as to make a 
problem for railways. One great system is in course of 
putting out hundreds of thousands of acres of young trees, 
with a view to raising its future supply. The forests of the 
northern states being) practically exhausted, the mills are 
removing, and locating in the forests of the southern states. 
The Bureau of Forestry predicts the end of our forest supply 
in 20 years, unless we conserve the forests. 
We now take from the Lake Superior region 24,000,000 
tons of the best iron ore per year. Formerly ore with less
-P-A-G-E-123
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 115 
than sixty per cent of iron was thrown away, now with less 
than forty-eight. Much the same may be affirmed of the 
precious metals. It is true that new deposits of gold have 
been found in Alaska and in Africa in recent years, so aj 
greatly to increase the supply relative to silver. But that 
there is need of economy in mining is shown by the fact 
that the material from the mines once worked over is now 
being worked over again by improved processes to extract 
the remaining metal. Recent estimates state that our iron 
supply will be exhausted in from 50 to 100 years. 
Even in respect to land, which has been so free and plenti- 
ful in the United States hitherto, we are in sight of the time 
when all will be occupied. Free land in the West to be had 
almost for the taking has been the explanation of high 
wages and prosperity. Now, as we begin to feel its scarcity, 
we see appearing the old world problems, which arise from 
crowding population on means of subsistence. 
Evolution of new nations into industrial order. — Another 
large reason for this economic dominance is that, beside 
the pushing of the population on land and food supply, the 
various parts of the civilized world have been put in close 
dependence on each other, made economically an organic 
unity, by reason of quick transportation and communicating 
agencies. It is impossible for a nation to remain localized 
and previncial, independent economically, and remain civil- 
ized. Let commerce into a nation inferior in point of 
civilization, as in the case of Japan, and the demand for the 
various goods of civilized nations arises; they are imported 
at first, then plants are set up after the pattern of those of 
advanced nations to provide the same goods at home, and 
soon the nation is competing with other nations for the

trade of the world, alive with revolutionized industrialism 
at home and training her growing citizens on these new lines. 
To-day Russia, Turkey, and China are taking these more 
or less initial steps of industrialization. Hence as a world 
movement there is an evolution of a larger and larger 
populous area into the industrial order. 
Evolution of larger national areas into the industrial order. 
— Likewise within any given nation there is an evolution of 
larger areas of population into the industrial order. The 
growth of cities in the last century, particularly in the last 
few decades, in the leading nations of the world is sufficient 
evidence of the truth of this statement. For instance, the 
urban population of the United States has expanded within 
a century from 3.3 per cent in 1790 to 33.1 per cent in 1900. 
In 1840 it constituted but 8.5 per cent of the total population 
and less than 21 per cent in 1870. This growth of cities 
from six in 1790 to 44 in 1840, 226 in 1870, and 545 in 
1900, each with over 8,000 inhabitants, is coincident with 
the industrial and commercial expansion of the nation. Its 
greatest growth has been coincident with the establishment 
of transportation facilities and the development of industries. 
(U.S. Statistical Atlas, 1900, p. 440.) 
Similar industrial changes in Europe have caused an 
equally rapid growth of cities. The table on the following 
page shows the population in 1900 and the percentage of 
growth of chief cities between 1890 and 1900. 
According to the United States census of 1900, out of a 
total population of 75,994,575, only 45,411,164 persons live 
in the country and villages of less than 2,500 inhabitants. 
Nor is there any prospect that a return tendency towards 
the country will set in. On the contrary, it is almost certain
-P-A-G-E-125
  IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 117 
that cities all over the world will multiply in population and 
numbers. Many intelligent writers voice this outlook. 
Mr. Howe, for instance, makes a startling analysis of 
tendencies at work which are sure to build larger urban 
populations. In a trenchant chapter entitled “The New 
Civilization,” he says: “ It has been suggested by Mr. H. G. 
Wells, in his Anticipations, that in time, London, St. Peters- 
burg, and Berlin will exceed 20,000,000 in population, 
while New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago will proba- 
bly contain twice this number of people. In so far as New 
York and Chicago are concerned this is probably no fanci- 
ful estimate.”

With a uniform population density which some of its 
areas now contain, Manhattan Island would hold nearly two 
hundred million people. New York will be the commercial 
center of the world and much more dominant as such than 
London now is. “On a smaller scale, and in a sense 
tributary to New York, the cities of Boston, Philadelphia, 
New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle will expand by 
the same forces, . . . Chicago and St. Louis will perform 
for the central regions of America what New York now does 
for the eastern seaboard.” The Panama canal and deep
-P-A-G-E-126

waterways will place them in close touch with all parts of the 
world. ‘At no distant day, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, 
Buffalo, and Duluth will be seaboard towns, for the opening 
of deep waterway connections to the sea is an insignificant 
engineering achievement incomparison with what has already 
been done.” (The City the Hope of Democracy, Chap. I.) 
Growing competition in agriculture.—It must not be 
thought that it is alone in the so-called industrial field that 
intensification obtains. We find it entering the field of the 
farmer as well. We have adverted to the fact that in our 
. country the supply of free land is becoming exhausted. 
The time is at hand when the extravagant methods of exten- 
sive farming will have to cease. Our wheat farms, for 
instance, are coming under severer competition with other 
wheat producers of the world. 
If rich lands of South America are developed and raise 
large yields of wheat, that commodity is likely to fall in price 
in the markets of the world. Or if Germany improves wheat 
culture so as to increase her yield, the world-price feels the 
effect. Farmers in America have to sell at market prices. 
Thus, competing with wheat raisers all over the world, they 
must be prepared to raise it as cheaply as the others. 
Again agriculture is absorbing more science and machin- 
ery. It needs both to increase its output of crops. From 
the point of view that industrialism consists in the use of 
machinery, agriculture is an industrial pursuit, because 
modern farming takes much complex machinery. On the 
basis of being conducted on scientific principles, it is also 
coming to recognition as an industrial pursuit 
Economic tendencies of science. — The progress and 
development of the world wait on the discoveries of science,
-P-A-G-E-127
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST 'IN SOCIETY I19 
and on the application of these new truths to useful ends. 
First, because science is a specializing process, it is its 
nature to become more and more cumulative in its effects. 
The earth, air, processes of nature, are observed, picked to 
pieces, understood; and their economic values established. 
In the field of inventions we find that machines have 
multiplied more rapidly in the last generation than in all the 
rest of the history of mankind. Wallace gave to the nine- 
teenth century the preéminence in great discoveries and 
perhaps the greatest have been mechanical. The differen- 
tiation of machinery may be judged by the United States 
Patent records. The number of patents and certificates of 
registration issued in 1901 was 25,558; in 1902 it was 27,136; 
and in 1903 it was 31,046. 
Secondly, science has become the handmaid of manu- 
facture and commerce. Almost every new discovery has 
been at first a wonder and a toy. We are able to recall how 
the Roentgen ray was for a long time the sport and play- 
thing of the civilized world. Yet now it is the useful serv- 
ant of medicine. So radium was at first a mere curiosity 
but even now is put to stern economic use. Likewise wire- 
less telegraphy has found its place in the communicating 
system of to-day and promises much for the future. Chem- 
ists are acknowledged forerunners and adjuncts of manu- 
facturing processes. Biologists, like Burbank, for example, 
are confessedly commercial in their aims, that is, desire their 
work to be commercially valuable to mankind. 
Inventors as well as scientists have been industrialized 
and commercialized by great corporations and made directly 
to contribute to wealth production processes. The great 
steel mills of South Chicago employ a corps of some 45 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 ee DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
chemists, who not only test the qualities of materials turned 
out, but work towards improving the iron and steel manu- 
facturing processes. In like manner the General Electric 
Company of Schenectady, New York, spends about $2,500,- 
ooo a year to develop inventions pertinent to its business. 
A part of the work of its 50 engineers, at the head of the 
departments, is to develop improvements in their respective 
departments. In a recent year 1412 ideas were reported by 
3oo men. Of that number 615 were developed and patents 
on them filed at Washington by the company. The patent 
business of the company alone requires twelve lawyers and 
twenty-eight assistants to look after it. (Amer, Jour, 
Sociology, Vol. 7, p. 113; and The World’s Work, June, 
1905, p- 6296.) 
The economic the vehicle of progress. — Industrialism 
must be the trend affairs shall take in the United States, if 
it is to retain its place, and is to make the advance that cur- 
rent civilization demands. Its battles will be commercial 
without, based upon industrial competence within. To- 
day among the nations the ancient saying is true: “To him 
that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall 
be taken away even that which he hath.” As the North 
was victorious over the South forty years ago, because it 
had developed a more productive industrialism on the basis 
of free labor, and as to-day Japan repels Russia because it 
has become industrialized far beyond its opponent, so in 
the future, more than ever, the road to success and power 
lies in this direction. 
It is a mistake to think that the very best culture and 
character cannot come through material growth. The 
spirit of every age expresses itself and builds up the life of
-P-A-G-E-129
  IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY tI21 
that time through means suitable to and harmonious with 
that age. Moreover, civilization grows by means of the 
multiplication of material things through which and in 
which it expresses and actualizes the life of its people. 
Measured in economic terms, civilization or life is developed 
in proportion to the multiplication of wants and to the 
corresponding ability to satisfy them. The invention and 
discovery of new things, devices, utilities are demanded 
to create new wants in humanity. Industrial life produces 
them in abundance, and commerce universalizes them. 
Hence it is that, economically, civilization waits on this 
process and uses it as an agent of development of its spirit, 
and of the welfare and satisfaction of its people. All other 
wants, intellectual, ethical, religious, rest on and develop 
on the basis of these material utilities as agents fit to serve 
them. Their richness demands the development of these. 
They thrive most where these abound. 
From this it may be seen how imperative it is that a state, 
a nation, which undertakes to train its citizens shall make 
them efficient in the knowledge, manipulation and produc- 
tion of the cars which bear the wealth of the civilization- 
How imperative that the great masses of men who are to 
make, produce, transport, sell, participate in the relations 
imposed by this multifarious activity, and have to meet 
the problems and duties thereof, should be made intimately 
acquainted by this state culture with the essential economic 
factors. 
Ill, ECONOMICS OF CONSUMPTION 
Need of economy in consumption. — We have just seen 
one side of the shield, which reveals the need for more 
intelligence and skill in the direction of producing the utili-
-P-A-G-E-130
    
| 
122 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
ties of life. We have now to view the other side. We 
find there the expression of the necessity for bringing more 
intelligence and training to the task of consuming the 
goods produced. 
Many of the reasons developed to demonstrate the neces- 
sity of greater insight and capability in the processes of 
production are also reasons for gaining the ability to prac- 
tice economy in the use of utilities in the satisfaction of 
our wants. If increased population presses on the supply 
of subsistence, so that better methods of production are 
required to supply the added wants, a consequent pressure 
is felt in the direction of a demand for practicing rigid 
economy by the people who use up the materials after they 
get them from the markets. If the using up of our natural 
resources in the shape of mine products, forests, and fertility 
of the soil brings a menace and speaks to us impressively 
that we should conserve these resources and improve our 
processes so that we may utilize a larger per cent of the 
materials in working them up into goods, it also admon- 
ishes us to exercise greater care in the use of the goods 
when they come to us. 
If we take the item of farm machinery by way of illus- 
tration, we may discover with what wastefulness we Ameri- 
cans proceed in our business. One of the commonest scenes 
in North Dakota, for example, is the yard of the house and 
barn of the farmer littered with farm machinery in all stages 
of degeneracy, from the new implements to the disintegrated 
parts of old implements lying about, all standing out and 
taking the full shock of climatic exposure. Within a year 
I stopped at the home of one of our most prominent men. 
He owns several thousand acres, has a large house and
-P-A-G-E-131
  IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 123 
barns, and some forty acres devoted to grounds in connec- 
tion with the buildings. Practically the entire forty acres 
was covered and littered with farm machinery. There were 
at least a dozen wagons, many hay frames, eight or ten 
harvesters, several hay rakes, mowers, drills, etc., etc.; some 
new, some partly worn, others broken down, and many 
widely scattered fragments. A great many thousand 
dollars’ worth of implements were thus displayed and had 
never been housed. Lack of care was evident in all this, 
as also in that of the out-buildings. Lack of paint and 
repairs was all too visible. 
Moreover, manure from hundreds of head of stock and 
from rotting hay and straw stacks was lying about in im- 
mense quantities. There were some small lakes near by 
which furnished water for the animals. The water of these 
ponds was colored yellow by the drainage from the manure. 
It must have been menacing to the health of the stock. To 
add to this, I discovered several dead animals lying near the 
edge of the small lakes in the lots and pastures, wholly 
uncovered, and polluting both water and air. I have never 
seen a more impressive demonstration than there of our 
wastefulness and heedlessness of economics in our busi- 
nesses. What occurred on that large farm, in a large and 
possibly exaggerated form, pretty generally occurs on our 
small farms. ; 
Now when we remember that the implements used on our 
farms are made of wood from the forests and of steel from 
the mines, and that the machines and the furnaces required 
in the making of the implements are fired by coal from the 
mines, we can see that to permit the useless destruction of 
the farm or other kinds of implements is to be wasteful of  
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  124 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
our natural resources, and at the same time it wastes our 
money directly invested in the implements. 
We could take up the subject of soil, and find that our 
farmers have been sapping the fertility of the earth unduly 
by ignorance of the right methods of farming. Or we could 
go into the matter of housekeeping and discover that our 
food expenses are higher than they would be if we knew 
more about foods, and about the relative sustaining values 
of the various kinds of foods found in our markets. The 
same would be found to be true of clothes, furnishings, and 
decorations of our houses, of the stores and fuels, etc. On 
every hand we should discover that if we really knew more 
about the articles we use in life and depend on for our well- 
being, we should get more out of our material utilities, 
expend less of our income in so doing, and use up less of the 
world’s ultimate supply. And this knowledge as certainly 
awaits upon educational emphasis and attention as does 
information about numbers, geography, or history. 
Were the majority of our citizens wealthy, we might disre- 
gard this lesson, in so far as it concerns individual well-being. 
But the majority of our American inhabitants are practi- 
cally without property. The bulk of wealth in the United 
States is owned by a very few people. The greater part 
of the remaining wealth is possessed by far less than half of 
the population. The masses.of the people are dependent 
on wages and salaries for their support. It could be shown 
that the average income of the workers on which to support 
a family does not exceed $400 or $450 per year. These 
facts demonstrate that the workers, the great masses of the 
American people, have a need to understand the principles 
of economy in consumption.
-P-A-G-E-133
  
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 125 
Spiritual necessity of training along consumptive lines.— 
We have the very highest grounds for asserting that attention 
should be paid to the matter of giving insight in methods 
and principles of consumption. For all goods of all sorts, 
whether they are material or spiritual, whether something 
to delight the palate or to charm the soul, are produced to 
be consumed; and that means to satisfy a want, a desire, 
a feeling. In other words, all goods and services are to 
produce satisfaction; to create happiness and contentment 
in life; to contribute to non-material ends. 
Now, there are two ways we may conceive by means of 
which the satisfaction in life might be enlarged and enriched. 
One is by increasing the number of human desires and 
wants; and consequently, the number of utilities or kinds 
of goods to appease them. This is secured by means of 
production. The other way is by training the feelings and 
capacity of human beings to enjoy. There is a very large 
field for educational effort in this direction, just how large we 
do not exactly know, as yet. At any rate we are coming to 
appreciate that there is a large and rich development ahead 
of the human race which may be assisted by taking the 
improvement of consumption under intelligent direction. 
As.recent writers have pointed out, we have largely lived 
under a scheme of prohibitions and penalties in the past. 
Our commandments have been those of the “do not” 
sort. We have been shown what not to do more than what 
to do. We have been taught to suppress our feelings and 
inclinations, rather than instructed how to guide them in 
directions where they may be fruitfully exercised and 
enlarged. In certain respects great gains have been made 
toward a larger view.  
-P-A-G-E-134
    126 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Not so long ago all our passions and instincts were 
regarded as inherently bad and hence they were to be 
suppressed like reptiles and vermin. Now our “new 
psychology” builds our mental and moral nature on those 
basic factors. Our mental structure is made possible by, 
and begins with, our instinctive and impulsive nature with 
which we start life. Our moral-will arises out of years 
of practice in coérdinating and perfecting our impulsive 
actions. Looking at individual life as a development, we 
do not see how there could be a mature, comprehensive, 
“higher” life without the existence of this “lower”’ life. 
All the time we are dependent on the play and presence of 
these factors and forces of the so-called “lower” life. In 
fact, all our higher tastes and enjoyments rest on them and 
are made out of their very materials. 
That there are"possibilities of getting more enjoyment out 
of the things we consume, of rising to greater heights of 
satisfaction in making use of what comes to our lot, is ina 
measure indicated by some of the gains which have been 
made and in certain facts coming to light. 
In the matter of enjoying the food we live by, there has 
been great gain made in the course of evolution. Most 
of the lower animals bestow very little attention upon the 
process of masticating and swallowing, indicating that the 
satisfaction gained by means of tasting what they eat is 
very small. The dog is a good example of this. He rushes 
upon his food, grabs it with his mouth, and swallows it with 
hardly a pause for the act of chewing. 
In the case of men, the satisfaction connected with mas- 
tication is relative to the stage of civilization. Primitive 
people love to eat, but it is not for the sake of the eating
-P-A-G-E-135
  
IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SOCIETY 127 
process, but for the sake of the food. Their chief aim is 
to get the food into the stomach. Not much time is spent 
on mastication. I have eaten with a group of Indians who 
formerly were “blanket” Indians. The meal they fur- 
nished was chiefly meat. It was boiled and served in the 
rough. To me it looked uninviting in the extreme, but to my 
primitive companions it was appetizing. While I was get- 
ting my chunk of the flesh cut into smaller pieces, and was 
getting under headway in properly grinding them, my 
associates had thrown the large chunks into their mouths, 
and with hardly any attempt at mastication, had swallowed 
them. 
Time spent on food preparation and eating is a fairly good 
measure of civilization and culture. We spend much time 
now on preparation of a great variety of foods; on invent- 
ing new and different methods of preparing the same 
article for the table; on seasoning and enhancing the 
flavors; on trimming and decorating the tables and dining 
parlors; on devising delicate and beautiful designs of 
silverware and pottery for table use. All this is a symptom 
of the high estimate we place on the process of partaking 
of food as a means of giving immediate satisfaction. In 
other words, it has high esthetic value to us, and is likely 
to have more. 
Now Mr. Fletcher advises us that we must chew each 
morsel of food we take into our mouths until its taste 
changes or ceases altogether; that by so doing we get the 
largest amount of pleasure out of eating, economize in 
food, and aid digestion, There are many authorities on 
foods who support him. Anyway, we are likely to develop 
away from the delight of gormandizing of primitive and 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
uncultured people to a fine and more differentiated enjoy- 
ment in food consumption. 
What has been said about food may serve to typify the 
increase of satisfaction we might hope to gain in connection 
with the other modes of consumption. Perhaps no other 
process can yield quite so intense satisfaction as the con- 
sumption of food, because the latter is the direct support 
of life. But we can increase our enjoyment of transportation 
and travel; of building our houses for beauty and appear- 
ance as well as for convenience; of decorating our houses 
and grounds; of using clothing and appliances; of books, 
music, etc. If we have teachers who have the appreciation, 
and are trained in the economies of enjoyment, the children 
will imitate and the scope and intensity of our all-around 
satisfaction and well-being will be enlarged. The genuine 
spiritual advance. of society will be furthered,
-P-A-G-E-137
CHAPTER VII. PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON 
EDUCATION 
In considering this subject it is not deemed necessary for 
our purpose to attempt to point out all the ills of society, 
to indicate their causes, and to show how the educational 
system might seek to remedy the situation. If a few, even 
one or two, typical cases of defects can be located, and if it 
can be shown how training for life might be conducted to 
strengthen society there, a sufficient purpose will be real- 
ized. The legitimate inference will then be that other lines 
of social pathology could be influenced by education in a 
similar beneficial manner. 
Magnitude of pathological conditions makes consideration 
imperative. —If it were possible, in short space, to portray 
the colossal magnitude which pauperism and criminality 
assume in modern society, its statistical measurement, the 
horrors and misery, the waste and sacrifice, the needlessness 
and heedlessness of their existence in a rational society, the 
inherent fascination of the matter might attract educators. 
This must be left to such men as Hunter and Riis in their 
effective works. Our hope here is to show their vast pro- 
portions, to indicate the consequent menace, and to suggest 
how educators or education may be of help. 
The economic loss sustained by our nation by reason of 
these classes is enormous. There is no national report 
which adequately enumerates the amount of crime and 
pauperism. Private estimates for pauperism vary greatly. 
129  
-P-A-G-E-138
    130 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Hunter, for instance, believes there are 10,000,000 persons 
in the United States who lack things needful for physical 
validity. He sums up his statements relative to poverty in 
the following way: 
“There are probably in fairly prosperous years no less 
than 10,000,000 persons in poverty; that is to say, underfed, 
underclothed and poorly housed. Of these about 4,000,000 
persons are public paupers. Over 2,000,000 working men 
are unemployed for four to six months in the year. About 
500,000 male immigrants arrive yearly and seek work in 
the very districts where unemployment is greatest. Nearly 
half of the females in the country are propertyless. Over 
1,700,000 little children are forced to become wage earn- 
ers, when they should be in school. About 5,000,000 
women find it necessary to work and about 2,000,000 are 
employed in factories, mills, etc. Probably no less than 
1,000,000 workers are injured or killed each year while do- 
ing their work. About 10,000,000 of the persons now living 
will, if the present ratio is kept up, die of the preventable 
disease, tuberculosis.”’ (Poverty, p. 337.) 
Professor Bushnell, after considering state reports of 
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and California, specifically, 
says: ‘‘ The total reported public expenses for the mainte- 
nance of the dependent, delinquent classes (chiefly in state 
institutions) in these eight states alone as discussed above 
was this: for one year $48,135,392.51. For seven of these 
states (excluding California) the total number of abnormal 
public dependents was 609,895, or one forty-second of the 
total population of those states. The population of these 
states was about one third of the country as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-139
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 131 
“Tf the same proportion of public dependents were main- 
tained for the other states of the Union, the total number 
in the country would be more than 1,800,000 in receipt 
of public relief. But in all probability the proportion of 
dependents is not high in other states.” (Why, the author 
does not state. One does not on the surface see why Indiana 
or Oregon should not have as large a percentage of paupers 
as neighboring states reckoned among the eight.) “ How- 
ever, the total number of private and public abnormal 
dependents in the United States must not be far from 3,000,- 
000, or one twenty-fifth of the total population of the coun- 
try, at an annual expense of nearly $200,000,000, or one tenth 
of the total wage income of all the manufacturing establish- 
ments of the country.” 
With respect to crime alone the same author says: “ Mr. 
Eugene Smith estimates that there are in the United States 
about 250,000 who make their living, at least in some 
degree, by the practice of crime. Their annual income, 
he thinks, is $1,600, each, or an aggregate income of $400,- 
000,000 annually. Taxation caused by crime is set at $200,- 
000,000.” (Henderson, Modern Methods of Charity, pp. 
385-390.) 
“Mr. Charles D. Kellogg has estimated that three mil- 
lions of people in the United States were wholly or par- 
tially supported by alms, during a recent year, and that the 
support received by this number was equal to the total 
support of half a million paupers during the entire year.” 
(Encyclopedia of Social Reform — article, Pauperism.) 
To the uninformed person these figures seem exaggerated, 
Yet the same conditions prevail in other countries. Over 
one third of the population of London and other English  
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
cities are impoverished, and the British government has 
been forced to take cognizance of the deplorable situation 
and to begin relief considerations. Our own government 
publications, naturally conservative, constantly divulge the 
woeful status. 
One certainly is conservative in saying that in the United 
States there are 500,000 persons entirely supported by 
society and some 2,000,000 persons partly supported. The 
productive power withheld from society will certainly 
average $400 per year. For the half million productive 
all the time this means $200,000,000. The loss to society 
from the others partly unproductive will almost or quite 
equal this amount. The criminal class, as Mr. Smith 
estimates, extracts $400,000,000 annually. Beyond this 
all these persons consume the products of society about 
equal in value to their productive power withheld, let us say 
something like $400,000,000. Further they require insti- 
tutions of various sorts for their detention or care, super- 
intendents, attendants and agents by the thousands who are 
therefore taken from productive enterprises and further 
must be supported by society; courts, government officials, 
processes of law, medical relief, etc., probably equaling in 
money terms all the foregoing sums. 
If we should thus roughly estimate the cost, in terms of 
wealth, to our society annually imposed by this element, 
$1,500,000,000 would be conservative.* But if we further 
rate it in terms of positive misery, negative and atrophied 
character, swamped and mutilated ideals, putrid and malig- 
* Rev. J. J. Munro, chaplain of the Prison Evangelistic Society of New 
York, estimates the annual direct and indirect cost of crime alone in the 
United States for 1906 at $1,075,000,000 (same, new edition, p. 335).
-P-A-G-E-141
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 133 
nant social conditions, or by means of any spiritual standard 
whatsoever, the loss appears astounding. The system which 
perpetuates the formation of such unprofitable masses seems 
self-condemned and must be weak if it cannot find and 
apply a remedy. In so far as the educational system is 
accountable, it cannot be rated as highly scientific, expe- 
dient or effective under its record. 
I. GENERAL CAUSES OF SOCIAL DISEASES 
In considering the causes of poverty and crime, we shall 
have to refrain from indulging in minute details. It will be 
obvious, in a glance at the table of causes of poverty, that 
a great variety of causal conditions exist. The same would 
appear were a similar chart made for crime. We shall 
confine our attention to just those essential facts and typical 
causes which denote the connection between the social dis- 
eases and education. 
Defective social structures. —The really most ultimate 
and general cause or set of causal conditions of crime and 
poverty exists in the shape of defective social structures. 
Social structures or organizations in their relation to the 
individual may be working poorly. An organization or 
institution is intended to serve and satisfy social members 
in its given line. If it fails to do this, so that the individual’s 
wants are not met, there is so much social disease. Thus 
it may be that the economic organizations are not properly 
working. Wages may be too low, hours too short, neces- 
sary goods too high. Individuals’ wants which should be 
satisfied through such structures are stinted or unmet. 
Hence, poverty, pauperism, crime, as the result perhaps. 
Or it may be that the family institution has been impaired
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
so that the children’s moral training is neglected and the 
issue for society is likely to be criminal. 
The conclusion seems to be that defective social struc- 
tures or organizations mean social disease; and that we 
locate the disease by its effect on social beings. Defective 
individuals are the sign of inefficient organizations. A 
perfect society would have a full quota of efficient organi- 
zations, ably and actually satisfying all the wants of its 
individuals, which individuals would have been perfectly 
formed and trained under its institutional guidance. Those 
persons would be completely socialized. 
Heredity.— It has been said that if you desire to secure a 
good man you must go back to the grandparents and see 
that they are fit. While it is true that the factor of heredity 
is likely to be much overrated in its power to produce good 
or bad men, it is nevertheless a forceful one for good or ill. 
The truth may be put in the form of a general statement, 
namely, that our minds and lives rest on physiological con- 
ditions, the condition of validity or invalidity of our bodies, 
and that it is pretty difficult to get good results out of poor 
conditions. If we are born with weakened bodies, we are 
less able to compete in physical and mental work with those 
who have their physiques well developed. 
If we inherit disease or a tendency to disease, we are 
likely to be greatly handicapped in the struggle of life. 
Disposition, temperament, tastes, and probably traits of 
character are handed down from parent to child. A weak- 
ness or affliction may not be passed on in its exact form, but 
is likely to inflict a weakness in some form. Alcoholism 
may result in offspring who are maniacs, epileptics, vicious 
in character, or subjects of lingering diseases. Children
-P-A-G-E-143
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 135 
may inherit the characteristics of ancestors several genera- 
tions removed. (See Henderson, Dependents, Defectives, and 
Delinquents, pp. 14-16.) The marriage of close relatives 
may prove unfortunate in offspring, particularly if either 
party is physically weak. 
It is possible that good raising and care of offspring may 
overcome some of the defects of inheritance, but how much 
better were there none to overcome. Anyway, the millions 
of those who are at birth physically handicapped and who 
have not proper nutrition, hygienic attention, and good 
home raising are just so many candidates for almshouses, 
reformatories, prisons, and kindred institutions. The lag- 
gards in school and the laggards in life are those who, in 
many cases, did not get the “square deal” at birth. Phys- 
ical deficiency by birth is likely to act as a predisposition 
to social deficiency in the absence of excellent training. 
Poor homes. —A recent national convention of charity 
workers was unanimous in pointing to the home as a lead- 
ing factor in ruining or saving the child. The National 
Educational Association of 1909 likewise devoted large atten- 
tion to the duty of the parent, and laid heavy emphasis on 
the function of the home. It is a commonplace in sociology 
that the home is a unique and fundamental social institution 
with duties to perform which cannot be readily assumed by 
any other; among the most important of which is the moral 
training of children. 
A poor home is one which is short in any way that is 
necessary to the right development of children. It may be 
short in shelter, food, and clothing, so that children may 
not have the strength and health for the growth and duties 
of childhood. It may be lacking in its spiritual setting,
-P-A-G-E-144
    
136 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
without books, papers, pictures, enlightening and elevating 
conversation, as a consequence of which children are dull 
and backward mentally. The cause of dullness of some of 
the so-called “dull children” who enter school is just 
such paralyzing home conditions. Lastly, a poor home is 
one which allows the child to do as it pleases, to run wild in 
all sorts of associations, and wields no influence in shaping 
the character for good. And, sad to say, some homes of this 
type go further, even actually polluting the lives of the 
children. 
Neighborhood associations. —The child’s earlier days 
are spent exclusively in the home. But from about the 
third year on, its life widens out to take the influences of the 
neighborhood. The great majority of children pass a very 
large part of their time in the play associations of the im- 
mediate community. Even if the home is doing its duty, 
internally, toward the child, it cannot deprive it of the 
association with children without stunting and dwarfing its 
nature. Play is as essential to the proper development of 
the young as atmosphere and food. Moreover, the major- 
ity of mothers cannot hire help, and have the sole charge 
of the children of the home. It is next to impossible that 
they should keep the young under their supervision all the 
time. There follows, naturally, just as the facts denote, 
the indulgence in promiscuous neighborhood associations. 
The imitative nature of the child makes these associations 
very powerful. Children imitate children more readily 
than they imitate elder people. Good habits formed within 
the home may be torn down and displaced by bad ones, in 
short order. This makes bad associations of all sorts de- 
structive. We remarked on the purity of our child’s lan-
-P-A-G-E-145
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 137 
guage until she mixed with other children. Then a rapid 
change set in. Other children of the region used poor 
grammar, and some rough words. Our child responded 
and her chaste English immediately faded. We could not 
counteract the example of the other children. Because of 
plasticity, extreme suggestibility, and imitative responsive- 
ness on the part of the young, degrading and immoral asso- 
ciations and influences in the neighborhood are rendered 
unduly pernicious and dangerous. They are extremely 
active and forceful in establishing habits of shiftlessness 
and criminality. 
Poverty. — Poverty is a pathological social condition in 
itself. When it becomes pauperism it certainly is, and 
some contend that all poverty is so. Poverty occurs when- 
ever the income is not sufficient to maintain physical effi- 
ciency. Good service cannot be given, nor good health and 
morals maintained, wherever this is the case. 
But poverty begets more of its kind, and also brings in a 
crop of other social ills in the form of crime, ill health from 
poor food and bad sanitary conditions, and a general low 
tone of life. Floods of ills overtake those who have not 
the means to build or rent warm houses, purchase sufficient 
fuel to warm them, provide plenty of nourishing food so 
that the workers and the children are kept strong, secure 
drainage and sewage disposal, ice for the preservation of 
foods in hot weather, medicine and medical attention in 
cases of sickness, and means of intelligence, —the books 
and papers. Inheritance steps in to perpetuate weakened 
bodies, and constitutions undermined by overwork, under- 
feeding, exposure, and disease. Ignorance and need may 
furnish the conditions of temptation and immorality, and  
-P-A-G-E-146
  
fr 
138 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
the second generation may be criminal in tendency because 
of deteriorated constitution and minds, for such are prone to 
criminal tendencies by reason of weakened wills. 
Lack of skill. —It is becoming increasingly apparent 
to students of social diseases and of the backward classes 
that the lack of skill constitutes a very large factor in their 
production. As an extended notice of this subject is given 
later in the chapter, we shall defer its consideration to that 
place. 
II. DEFECTIVE EDUCATION AND SOCIAL DISEASES 
Having enumerated the chief causes of pathologic social 
conditions, and explained the nature of each as far as our 
space would permit, let us now consider whether defective 
education could enter as a cause in the case of any of 
them. 
Heredity and poor homes. —In the case of inherited 
physical conditions, it might seem far fetched to hold the 
schools responsible. From one viewpoint, the connection 
is remote. Considering that little attention has been paid 
in the education of the young to the practical phases of 
physiology and its articulation with social matters, we have 
little right to reprove education. Having in mind, how- 
ever, as was said above under the heading of Heredity, 
that poor food, unsanitary living, exposure, intermarriages 
of kin, etc., are likely to entail weakened constitutions upon 
the second generation; that these enfeebled persons consti- 
tute the class which is predisposed to furnishing victims of 
poverty and criminality; and that these things should be 
known; we may regard the omission of this knowledge by 
the schools as an indictment. We may say, with reason,
-P-A-G-E-147
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 139 
that in so far as enlightened teaching would prevent heredi- 
table tendencies, in that far education is defective. 
In the case of poor homes, perhaps much the same kind 
of statement would have to be made. In so far as the 
educational system is responsible for withholding from the 
growing generation the necessary knowledge relative to 
the nature and functions of the home in human society 
and to the responsibilities and duties of parents as respects 
their children in their development into citizenship; and 
in as far as the larger social situation does not so press upon 
the parents that they are withheld from exercising their 
parental duties; to that degree education is indictable and 
defective. But in saying this we should be mindful that, as 
yet, the mass of people are ignorant of the fullness and im- 
portance of parental duties; that trained social workers are 
just beginning to appreciate something of the situation; that 
advanced educators are but now catching sight of the large- 
ness of the problem; and that no one and every one is to 
blame. 
Hiatus between school and home. —We have already 
given attention to the home as a cause of pathological 
social conditions, in permitting the children to play in all 
sorts of associations, and in imposing on them its own low 
standards in many cases. Let the reader refer to that 
former passage for the treatment of that phase of the 
subject. 
This does not appear to indict the school. If it is the sin 
or omission of the home it cannot be that of the school. 
Maybe we shall not be able to prove the connection between 
education and the situation. We do not want to strain the 
case, but it appears like this, to-day.
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Whether right or wrong, the development has actually 
taken place in society, and is going on, that the homes have 
contracted in the exercise of their functions while the schools 
have expanded in theirs. The schools have come to exer- 
cise a larger and larger influence on, and control of, the time 
of the children. How far this tendency is to proceed is not 
determinable. It is apparent that the homes have contracted 
farther than the schools have expanded. It is not at all 
certain or very probable, in the multitude of cases in the 
cities, that the homes will ever again expand and retake 
their old functions. There is a great hiatus between the 
home and the school, the great play period time, where 
supervision of child life is imperative, but where none is 
now provided. During this large and important space of 
the day and of the year no one stands sponsor in society; 
and it is in this time that contaminating associations are 
contracted and anti-social undertakings engaged in which 
pervert and spoil the life-habits and character. It is the 
opinion of practically all eminent juvenile court judges that 
idleness and bad associations are the great agents in pro- 
ducing criminal offenders. 
Want of vocation as a cause of poverty. — We owe to 
charity workers, in the great cities of the world, the collec- 
tion of reliable information of the specific causes of poverty. 
As an illustration of these findings, the table prepared by 
Professor S. M. Lindsay is given. (National Conference 
of Charities and Correction, 1899, p. 379.) It agrees very 
closely with the causes collected from investigators in the 
chief European and American cities. Baltimore, New York, 
New Haven, and Boston are the four cities which furnish its 
facts.

the four cities appear, as being sufficient for our purpose.

Of these various causes, it will be seen that those indicating 
misfortune amount to almost 72 per cent, while those indicat- 
ing misconduct equal only a little over 25 per cent. The 
chief group of causes is ‘“‘ matters of personal capacity.” 
Lack of employment is the largest single factor, while
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
“ matters of employment” amount to nearly one third of all 
causes. Drink, so often taken to be the almost exclusive 
cause of poverty, is seen to account for only about 15 per 
cent. | 
An inspection of the causes of poverty, given above, shows 
there is plenty of opportunity to connect poverty with the 
unskilled condition of the individual. Under the heading 
“causes indicating misconduct,” there is large scope for lack 
of skill to operate as a cause. Hardly one of the subhead- 
ings could be exempted from the charge that back of it as a 
condition which accounts for it as a fact in the life of the 
individual is the want of special, technical ability to get and 
keep work; and the lack of a character of sterling worth, 
due to the fact that the individual has not had his life 
organized and disciplined through the definite and constant 
demands special training imposes. 
I should claim that “ shiftlessness and_ inefficiency,” 
for instance, are the result of the want of definite training. 
It is a habit of life ensuing upon persistent idleness per- 
mitted in youth. Observation of life and psychical studies 
have made it clear that the normal state of children is one 
of activity. They love to expend energy in accomplishing 
things, not only in play but in suitable tasks. Proper 
training would utilize the love of action and of making effort, 
in childhood and youth, directing it in specific channels and 
organizing it into a life habit. Love of idleness would not 
result. Thus laziness is merely a sign of a lack of training 
and skill, a lack of organized activity through which the 
individual finds satisfaction in expressing himself. 
In the same manner we might go back of the other items 
under this first general heading.
-P-A-G-E-151
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 143 
Under “causes indicating misfortune,” there is smaller 
possibility of tracing the causes back to a more conditioning 
one, such as lack of definite skill. Yet it is apparent that 
several items might yield to the treatment. Lack of skill 
might be a factor under “Jack of normal support,” in 
the first three under ‘“‘ matters of employment; ” and pos- 
sibly in the third and sixth under “ matters of personal 
capacity.” 
It would be safe to say, then, that a very large percentage 
of poverty is caused, directly or in the second stage removed, 
by a lack of useful training. We should not be warranted 
in attempting to state it's a definite percentage. To estab- 
lish the fact that there is a connection between much of the 
existing poverty and the untrained, unskilled condition of the 
impoverished persons, is all we might hope to do. 
A study of the industrial situation would appear to force 
the opinion on us that a considerable proportion of the work- 
less people do not have work, either because work in general 
is not sufficient at the time for them or because it is not to 
be found in their particular locality. We are also made 
aware of the existence of a considerable residuum, the 
members of which are unable to compete successfully in 
the labor market with the more skillful members of society. 
Just what per cent of the idle class this residuum is in the 
United States, it would be difficult to say. Mr. Charles 
Booth, the thorough and scientific investigator into social 
conditions of London, shows that over 30 per cent of that 
great city’s population is below the poverty line, and is 
made up of the occasional, casual, irregular workers, all 
unskilled. (Labor and Life of the People of London, 
Vol. 2, pp. 20-21.)
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Want of vocation as cause of crime. —In considering the 
cause of crime, we must put the economic conditions as the 
first and greatest, since want among the poor and greed 
among the rich and influential alike lead thereto. Carroll 
D. Wright says: “Certainly hunger leads to more crime 
of a petty nature, perhaps, than any other one cause.” 
“Labor, properly renumerated, is an effective guarantee 
against the commission of crime.” ‘In a state in which 
labor had all its rights there would be, of course, little 
pauperism and little crime. On the other hand, the undue 
subjection of the laboring man must tend to make paupers 
and criminals.” (Encyclopedia of Social Reform, First 
Edition, pp. 423-4.) 
Mr. Wright then shows that a lack of proper training has 
a large share in producing criminals. ‘It is statistically 
true that enough of knowledge to be of value in increasing 
the amount and quality of work done, to give character, to 
some extent at least, to a person’s tastes and aspirations, 
is a better safeguard against the inroads of crime than any 
code of criminal laws.” ‘ The kind of labor which requires 
the most skill on the part of the workman to perform insures 
him most perfectly against want and crime, as a rule. 
“This statement is fortified by such statistics as are avail- 
able. Of 4,340 convicts, at one time, in the State of Massa- 
chusetts, 2,991, or 68 per cent, were returned as having no 
occupation. The adult convicts numbered at that time 
3,971. Of these 464 were illiterate; of 220 sentenced dur- 
ing the year, 147 were without a trade or any regular means 
of earning a living. In Pennsylvania, during a recent 
year, nearly 88 per cent of the penitentiary convicts had 
never been apprenticed to any trade or occupation; and
-P-A-G-E-153
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 145 
this was also true of 68} per cent of the convicts sentenced 
to county jails and workhouses in the same state during 
the same year. In Mr. Frederick Wines’s recent report on 
homicide in the United States, in 1890, it is shown that of 
6,958 men, 5,175, or more than 74 per cent of the whole, 
were said to have. no trade.” 
Prof. R. P. Falkner, on the basis of statistics collected by 
the Wardens’ Association of the United States and Canada, 
gives the following table comparing the occupations of 
prisoners with those of the people.

The “ personal and professional ”’ include common laborers. 
Thus the higher the grade of labor, the less the liability to 
crime. ‘‘ Prisoners as a rule are accustomed to the rudest 
kind of labor. In the main they are unskilled, and probably 
also irregularly employed.” (Encyclopedia of Social Reform, 
pp. 403-4). Morrison of England states that 77 per cent 
of juvenile offenders had not been apprenticed to any trade, 
and that about 75 per cent of adult prison population were 
without definite vocation. In the general community 
laborers of all kinds amounted to only 20 per cent of the 
population over 15 years of age. ‘Therefore, according 
   
-P-A-G-E-154
    146 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
to the most moderate calculations, the class of low-skilled 
workmen is between three and four times more numerous in 
the prison population than in the general community. . .. 
The principal cause undoubtedly is that the ranks of the 
general laborer are recruited, as a rule, from the most back- 
ward, the most impoverished, the least self-respecting class 
in the community.” (Juvenile Offenders, pp. 166-70.) 
Thus he couples both criminal and poverty subjects with 
lack of skill and trade. Booker T. Washington in a 
passage previously quoted states that “go per cent of the 
colored people in prison are without knowledge of trades 
and 6r per cent are illiterate.” 
Ill. THE REMEDY PREVENTION 
The doctrine of prevention. — Now we have reached the | 
place where the treatment must be made to contribute to 
education. We want to know whether or not education 
can reach the causes of crime and pauperism. At once it 
becomes evident that certain of the causes aré outside the 
immediate influence of training. Criminal and pauper pre- 
dispositions, if they are ever actually and absolutely inher- 
ited, certainly cannot be eradicated. 
Recent studies of poverty in the United States and Great 
Britian emphasize the lack of employment as one of the 
greatest causes. Thus the New York Labor Bulletin for 
September, 1903, indicates that in portions of the year from 
20 to 30 per cent of the people are in enforced idleness. In 
Chicago a Federal report (Ninth Special Report, p. 29) 
puts the percentage of unemployed at 56.97. The United 
States census of 1900 (Vol. Occupations, p. 226) shows 
that for the whole country over 22 per cent of the popu-
-P-A-G-E-155
  
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 147 
lation were in enforced idleness during a part of the year, 
the largest number being in manufacturing, mechanic, 
domestic and personal pursuits. ‘The Charity Organiza- 
tion Society of New York shows that from 43 to 52 per cent 
of all applicants need work rather than relief. It applies 
equally well to Chicago. and some other cities. The thing 
most evident in these facts is that poverty, due to indus- 
trial derangement, is not a problem which charitable organ- 
izations are fitted to solve.” (Hunter, Poverty, p. 75.) 
Our presumption with reference to the unsocialized is that 
the remainder of the environment, that is, the associational 
and cultural influences, are stronger than the hereditary 
element. There does not seem to be any weighty argument 
against this position. The plain facts are in favor of it, 
save those relating to congenital cases. Prof. Richard T. 
Ely states that the comparative weight of environment and 
heredity in producing anti-social individuals is as nine to 
one in favor of the former. (The Outlook, September 16, 
1893.) He cites, as evidence, the practice of taking children 
from city slums and of the worst parents and placing them in 
good homes. Had they remained in the slums they were 
destined to become prostitutes, paupers and criminals. In 
good environment the vast majority grow into good citizens. 
C. Loring Brace testifies that in forty years the Children’s 
Aid Society of New York has placed 84,000 children in 
homes, “and it is our experience that no matter what 
the parents may be, if the child is taken away at an age so 
early that it has not yet understood the wickedness ‘about, 
if placed in the country home with kind and judicious 
adopted parents, it is almost certain to do well.” 
Modern charity work, in its care of children, is based on  
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
the recognition of the dominance of environment. Thus in 
Denmark “ great care is exercised in selecting the foster 
parents. Ordinarily children are placed in the country 
with particular persons instead of in care of asylum wards. 
This is accomplished through the benevolent assistance of 
pastors, teachers, physicians, etc., who become responsible 
for the control of the children.” (J. M. Gillette, in Hen- 
derson’s Modern Methods of Charity, p. 375.) 
Among the many methods of treating dependent children 
in England, ‘“‘the boarding-out system has the obvious 
advantage over any other form of institutional care, that it 
furnishes a natural instead of a more or less artificial life 
for the child. It makes possible that individual care and 
those personal attachments without which the normal 
development of the child cannot take place. Moreover, it 
effectually removes it from the atmosphere of pauperism 
and puts it into a normal relation with its social environ- 
ment.”” (Chas. A. Ellwood, in Henderson’s Modern Methods 
of Charity, p. 208.) 
The practice of parents, educators, churches, juvenile 
courts, etc., is and has been to teach the power of good 
wholesome surroundings to make and keep character and 
life. (See Chapter IV, Réle of the Social Environment.) 
Since prevention is coming to be regarded as the funda- 
mental method in various remedial lines education must be 
expected to find its contribution to the solution of these 
social problems to lie in the same kind of procedure. 
It is coming to be held by thoughtful medical practi- 
tioners that the larger work of the physician is to be that 
of preventive practice. It is reported that Lankaster, in a 
scientific address recently, took this position. “Coming
-P-A-G-E-157
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 149 
down from the regions of academic thinking, he made a 
timely plea for more public encouragement of the study of 
preventable diseases. Fifty million dollars he thought not 
too much to spend every year in Great Britain alone for that 
purpose, in order to save the thousands that needlessly die 
every year. It is an idea that is attractive to the public 
and one that is more and more appealing to the progressive 
medical men, that the function of the physician should be 
largely one of preventing diseases instead of curing them 
when neglect has permitted their inroads. In the United 
States, as he pointed out, there is a distinct tendency of rich 
men to give large sums of money for the equipment and the 
expenses of research in this and other scientific fields.” 
(World’s Work, September, 1906, p. 7931.) 
Up to the present generation the treatment accorded pau- 
perism and crime has been little fitted to render a perma- 
nent social cure. Criminal treatment has evolved from the 
method of inflicting revenge to penalty as reformation; then 
to prison procedure in the nature of employment and train- 
ing, as at present, intended to reform and to make criminals 
over into real valid citizens. None of these methods have 
lessened the number of criminals much, if at all. Society 
goes on producing them as prolifically as ever. 
Likewise with reference to pauperism, paupers were one 
time punished as criminals, later helped, with no effort to 
make them self-supporting; and now the best charity 
methods seek so to administer help, as not only not to 
make them more dependent but to restore them to inde- 
pendence and self-sustenance. Yet pauperism continues. 
Paupers are becoming more numerous. Charity methods 
do not cure the evil.

The truth may be put in a sentence, that society will not 
get rid of these evils until their production is prevented. 
Make both impossible by making every social member 
really social and productive. One method of course will 
be by means of vocational training. This will produce such 
a reorganization of education that no one can get out of 
school until he has been trained for citizenship and given 
a vocation. 
Thomas Moore in his Utopia, centuries ago, said that 
crime and pauperism were not curable by punishment and 
such methods as society then used. He then pointed out 
that idleness and lack of skill were accountable for these 
phenomena. Hence the cure would be training to work 
and for doing useful things. 
The world is just now catching up with his wise sugges- 
tions. Penology,'as a science, does not view criminals, for 
instance, as innately and intrinsically vicious. It views 
criminality as the result, largely, of untrained and mis- 
directed energy. Hence prison life is becoming a process 
of training and education into something definitely useful. 
We have seen that, in the production of both pauperism and 
crime, character and work-ability had a great deal to do 
as causes. Statistics were given from state prisons to show 
that the inmates were untrained and irregular workers 
before entering prison life. Facts taken from Ely, Wines, 
Faulkner, Washington, and Booth indicated that the lack 
of ability and skill, which special training would give, 
largely accounts for the existence of adult criminals and 
paupers. We also found Morrison showing that juvenile 
offenders are made out of the unskilled vocationless class 
of youths. It would seem, therefore, that educators have a
-P-A-G-E-159
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION I5i 
very strong clew to the solution of the educational problem, 
so far as it is related to these phases of life. 
Vacation schools. Another method of preventing poverty 
and criminality is to bridge over the gulf existing between 
the home and the school. Not all schools have remained 
inactive, relative to this important matter. In some of our 
larger cities, and in fact in many outposts throughout 
the country, attempts are being made to cover a part of the 
out-of-home period of child life. The vacation school is a 
very successful attempt to provide activity and supervision 
of the larger part of the long vacation. During half of each 
day vocational work, along with some academic studies, is 
provided under the direction of competent teachers. The 
vacation schools are located in those portions of the cities 
where the population is most congested, wholesome play- 
grounds non-existent, and bad associations most rampant. 
Previous reference (Chapter III) has indicated the popularity 
and the service of the work done. Students of juvenile 
delinquency hope much from this attempt. 
Playgrounds. Another attempt in the same direction is the 
playground association movement. It began back as far as 
1826, and was confined to Europe in its earlier stages. It is 
a recognition of the value of play, and of the necessity of 
providing a place in congested quarters of cities under wise 
direction. The scope of playgrounds is usually this: sand 
piles for little children —to be renewed frequently so as to 
keep them clean and wholesome; gymnasium, running tracks, 
basket-ball grounds, etc., for boys; and seesaws, swings, 
etc., for girls. Special exercises should be provided for both 
sexes during adolescence, such as dumb-bells and staffs in 
the open air.  
-P-A-G-E-160
152 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
“Seward Park, in New York city, is a type of the best 
playground and a brief description will give the best idea of 
the function of this institution. It cost the city $1,800,000 
and is located in the Ghetto, a very crowded down-town 
district. At one end a complete outdoor gymnasium sur- 
rounded with a running-track; at the other, swings, seesaws 
etc., for girls; in the middle, sand piles, tents, etc., for the 
little ones. ‘The mothers are encouraged to be present with 
their little ones, and provision is made that milk and 
crackers can be bought on the premises. New York city 
has set aside $300,000 per annum for the purchase of play- 
grounds.” 
A national playground association now exists, with 
Theodore Roosevelt as honorary president, and Dr. Luther 
Gulick of New York city as president. Over twenty impor- 
tant cities in America are supporting playgrounds. In 
some the movement is new, in others reports of attendance 
are not made. New York city has the largest attendance, 
about 25,000 in attendance; Chicago, 15,000; St. Paul, 
8,000; etc. . The cities cither entirely or partly support the 
playgrounds out of special funds. 
Some attention has already been paid (see chapter on 
Democracy) to the demands of the home on the schools, and 
nothing more important can be added now. As to what the 
schools could do to make life fitter through inheritance, 
some bare suggestions were made in Section II of this 
chapter. What might be developed out of those sugges- 
tions would likely be mere theory. We should do better to 
devote our attention to that which is more apparent and 
certain. 
Since our central thought is the value of organizing
-P-A-G-E-161
  PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 153 
education about the vocational factor, let us observe the 
effect of this kind of education in the direction of the recla- 
mation of the anti-social. Along with this vocational fea- 
ture go the restraining, the guarding, and the cultural, as 
accompaniments; and they might be said to be centered 
about it. 
Reclamation of children by special training. The 
thought of those who attempt to reclaim wayward children 
is steadily turning toward giving them a training for self- 
support, as perhaps the best means of bestowing that civic 
virtue which is necessary in life. Not only are wayward 
children so cared for but also indigent or dependent children. 
Thus, it is noted that for one purpose or the other industrial 
schools exist in America, England, Ireland, Scotland, and no 
doubt in other countries, and are supported by the Jews in 
various lands. It is difficult to find an account which 
deals with these schools in the aspect we need here. We 
must make a few cases serve to illustrate our point. 
England has for some time been making the attempt to 
reclaim wayward children by means of industrial schools. 
In 1900 these schools numbered 142, with an attendance of 
24,718 children. ‘They were established by voluntary 
agencies, but now are largely supported by government 
funds. Children who are vagrant, beg, are indigent, are 
refractory against parents, guardians, or are in a Poor Law 
School; who are truant, associate with criminals or prosti- 
tutes, or who, being under twelve, have been convicted for the 
first time of an offense punishable by imprisonment, may 
be committed. 
“The industrial training given in the industrial schools 
has been much improved in the last few years. Now the
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
best schools employ competent teachers who give technical 
instruction of a high grade, both theoretical and practical. 
The efficiency of the schools is, however, greatly injured by 
lack of classification, especially classification according to 
age. Usually children of all ages from 7 to 16, and of very 
different characters, are found together in one school, 
without much attempt at classification. In spite of this 
and other drawbacks, the industrial schools seem fairly 
successful in their work of reclaiming wayward children. 
It is estimated that about 80 per cent of the boys who pass 
through these schools, do well in after life.” (Ellwood, in 
Henderson’s Modern Methods of Charity, pp. 211-212.) 
Besides the above schools, England supports day indus- 
trial schools for wayward children as well as for truants. 
From these schools they return to their homes after school 
hours. “They are said to be very successful.” (Same, 
p- 213.) 
The work in America may be illustrated by some Chicago 
institutions. The John Worthy School takes boy criminals 
and gives them academic schooling and manual training. 
“In the manual training department practice in wire and 
iron work, and in bench and lathe work in wood, is given to 
all of the older boys for one period each day. The younger 
boys work in raffia paper and cardboard. The work done 
by the boys in the shop is surprisingly good, and the interest 
aroused extends to the academic studies, such as arithmetic; 
for in manual training work they see its practical impor- 
tance.” 
In 1901 a printing department was established, and since 
that time many boys have learned the printing trade. All the 
printing of the school is done by it. Mr. Sloan, the former 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
PATHOLOGICAL’ DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 155 
superintendent, stated in one of his reports, that “‘ few of the 
boys who learned the printer’s trade, while in school, were 
ever recommitted.”” He said that judging success of the 
institution by percentages, it benefited the great majority 
of its inmates, since they were not recommitted. (H. B. 
Chamberlain in the Chicago Record-Herald, April, 1906.) 
The Parental, or truant, school, of the same city, embodies 
about the same viewpoint. It is not a penal institution, 
nor a reform school, but attempts to be a corrective for bad 
environments. Judge R. S. Tuthill, one of its promoters, 
whose work is with juvenile delinquents, says that truancy 
is the first step towards juvenile criminality; and its friends 
assert that “as prevention is better than cure, it is better 
for the city to spend money on a school for training boys in 
ways leading to an honest, upright manhood, than it is to 
let these same boys drift along until open defiance of law 
and authority forces society, in self-defense, to maintain 
them in expensive penal institutions.” 
All boys are strictly superintended in play as well as in 
work. Besides the regular work of public schools, military 
drill and gymnasium, manual training in various forms is 
a large part of the training. In summer it is practical farm 
work. Each boy tills his own piece of ground and learns to 
get results. Corporal punishment is forbidden. Depriva- 
tion of privileges, enforced physical exercise, and solitary 
confinement are disciplinary means. 
As in Elmira, new recruits are placed in the second of 
three classes, and their conduct decides whether they shall be 
promoted or degraded. Larger privileges and deserts as 
well as shortening the time of detention go with promotion. 
The converse is true of degradation. Good conduct and good  
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
work result in parole for a boy, under which he returns 
home and remains, provided he attends school. 
“The average time of detention at the school is about 
eight and a half months, the average age of the boys a little 
over eleven years. During the four years of its existence 
there have been 881 commitments to the school and 113 
returns. During the past year 47 out of 376 paroled boys, 
or about 124 per cent, have been recommitted, and in these 
instances Superintendent McQueary feels that the children 
had been paroled too soon.” (Same, April 4, 1906.) 
An object lesson from penology. — We have seen in a few 
cases of the application of vocational training, together 
with careful discipline, to wayward and truant children, its 
efficiency in reclaiming them for society. An even greater 
object lesson pointing in the same direction is found in the 
field of penology. The work done at Elmira and other 
similar reformatories is full of significance for thoughtful 
educators. It may be well to consider Elmira somewhat in 
detail to see what the suggestion for education is. 
The Elmira Reformatory takes convicts between the 
ages of 16 and 30. It was established in 1869 by New York 
state and received its first inmates in 1876; and it first 
incorporated the indeterminate sentence in 1877. The 
dominant thought of the institution is to make men fit for 
citizenship, rather than to inflict revenge or punishment. 
Qualities of manhood and citizenship being the object, 
enforced residence in the institution longer than necessary 
to produce these results would be illogical. Hence, sen- 
tences are indeterminate; that is, there is a maximum sen- 
tence period beyond which an inmate may not be kept, but 
proof of complete reformation will lessen the term of service.

Though the sentence be 40 years, if the man conducts him- 
self aright, he may be paroled outside in a year and entirely 
free in another six months. Longer retention and incarcera- 
tion than are necessary to make the convict over into a good 
useful citizen would be irrational and criminal, since refor- 
mation and restoration are the ends. 
The pedagogical aim of the institution is to make charac- 
ter by establishing ‘‘ the habits of quick and accurate adjust- 
ment to good environment, and the habit of forethought.” 
These are qualities, which being absent in the individual, 
crime is likely to ensue. The love of liberty is seized on as 
the motive most powerful to secure these results. Most 
prisoners will reorganize their habits and establish new 
and better ones for this motive. A considerable minority, 
however, require more immediate wants, those which can 
then and there be satisfied, to impel them to make the 
effort. 
The first want, that of liberty, can be satisfied by a year’s 
good conduct and a half year’s parole. The second set 
of wants find satisfaction through a system of grading and 
marking. All phases of the life and work of each prisoner 
are graded. For instance, there are five character grades: 
1. Paroled men; 2. Upper first grade; 3. Lower first grade; 
4. Second grade; 5. Third grade. On entrance the convict 
enters the lower first and is given a brown suit. If he 
shows progress in behavior, school, and trade, he is pro- 
moted to the upper first in six months and given a blue suit. 
With six months more of progress he is paroled and estab- 
lished in free society. If his conduct and industry remain 
good he is freed in another six months. 
But on entering the lower first grade, if behavior and 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
work are bad, the prisoner goes down to second and wears 
a red suit. If he continues down to third grade he receives 
cell life and total isolation. The higher the grade the 
greater the physical comforts, the better the furnishings, 
food, service, etc. The reverse is true the lower the grade. 
These are the immediate satisfactions of the wants which 
appeal so strongly and help establish hearty activities, 
habits, and character necessary for eventual freedom. 
The agencies used in reclamation, character, and voca- 
tion building are essentially three; namely, industrial, intel- 
lectual and moral training. Thirty-six trades are taught. 
Kindergarten (for feeble-minded), primary, intermediate 
and academic instruction is maintained. Religion and 
ethics are taught on Sundays. For defectives, to help 
them get self-control, manual training is supported. Athlet- 
ics, military drill, and massage bathing are applied and 
used on needy cases. 
The chief instruction is, however, industrial, and, in many 
workshops with scores or hundreds of workers, both teach- 
ers and guards are wholly convicts. In locating new- 
comers in a trade advantage is taken of ancestral trades as 
a possible basis of inclination and aptitude; of callings of 
relatives living, with whom the reformed convict might find 
a place; and of industries in his home community. Wage- 
earning and fines have been adopted to further stimulate 
effort and to inhibit sloth and backwardness. 
Conclusion for education. —The results at Elmira are 
satisfactory and wonderful. Up to 1895 there had been 
6641 indeterminate convicts. Of these 4369 were paroled, 
of which 83 per cent were reported as reformed and 15.7 
per cent as probably returned to criminal practice. In the
-P-A-G-E-167
PATHOLOGICAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 159 
year ending September 30, 1906, 1016 had been paroled. 
Of these 348 had served well and earned absolute release, and 
530 were serving well, their time of parole having not yet 
expired, indicating a probable reformation of 86.4 per cent. 
Institutions in France, Germany, Spain, and Ireland report 
like remarkable results. Japan has introduced the system 
of prison reformation. 
Over 80 per cent of reclaimed citizens is a remarkable 
result. It means a sweeter and more satisfactory life for 
those reclaimed, a lessened expense to the state, and produc- 
tive ability added to society. 
The point of the treatment is that the chief agent used 
in this reformation is industrial training, although other 
good agencies are employed. “In all trades there are 
definite courses of study, the mastery of which is carefully 
insisted upon. In this way about 700 hours, or 11 months, 
is the average time required to learn a trade.” This quick 
mastery is due to the systematic and strenuous instruction 
given. Well-regulated industrial habits are thus secured 
which we have seen are lacking in paupers and criminals. 
The lesson for education is obvious. ‘ The corner stone 
of the reformative system is industrial training. . . . To 
effect a rounded development, intellectual and moral edu- 
cation is an essential accompaniment of industrial train- 
ing, and schools of trades must be supplemented by schools 
of letters.” (Eugene Smith, Amer. Jour. Sociology, Vol. XI, 
Pp. 94-95.) “‘I confess that I myself feel that in the 
century before us our public schools will make it possible 
for all children to be properly educated, not only in the three 
R’s, but also in the three H’s, without first being sent to 
prison. Why society does not erect similar institutions to

  160 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
keep our boys and girls out of jail, instead of waiting until 
they are in prison, I do not explain, for I cannot. There 
is no school worth while to-day which does not aim, as does 
this Reformatory, to relate mental and manual endeavor 
in a happy homogeneity. . . . Education which prevents 
crime is the education to be desired.” (Supt. A. D. Call, Edu- 
cation, Vol. 22, pp. 586-603.)

  CHAPTER VIII. THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION, 
AND OTHER ENDS 
We have now proceeded far enough to make it plain 
that the end of education is determined by objective social 
conditions, rather than by subjective analysis. Before proceed- 
ing to a treatment of the methods of socializing education, 
it may be of interest and advantage to set in compari- 
son and to harmonize, as far as possible, the social end of 
education presented in this volume, and the other ends of 
education which have been held, and some of which so 
largely obtain to-day. 
The ends of education which have been held at various 
times and places in western civilization may be denoted as 
approximately four. One is perfection, or the harmonious 
development of all the essential attributes of the individual, 
as expressed in ideal character. Another is discipline, or 
training of the powers or faculties of the individual, so that 
he may be a generally potent, all-round citizen. Culture 
may be designated as the third type, in the sense of a built- 
up stock of information largely without reference to appli- 
cation in any particular sphere of experience. The fourth 
type of purpose has been vocational or wholly practical. 
Its meaning is apparent. It is pointedly utilitarian. 
I. PERFECTION 
The idea of perfection. — It will be necessary to examine 
these various educational aims to discover their strength and 
weakness relative to the social end. We will deal first with 
161 
eek 
"4 —7H1
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
perfection of the individual. Behind the idea of perfection 
have been some great names and great schools of thought. 
It would seem congruous to find such philosophers as Plato 
and Kant, with their idealistic conceptions, behind the 
view; but we should not expect to find such utilitarians as 
John Mill and Herbert Spencer lending it support. Of 
course, they all differed as to what constituted the perfect 
individual; yet the idea of perfection, in a general way, was 
to constitute the goal. 
For instance, Mill would make it the general end of edu- 
cation. All influences of every sort, leading to the per- 
fection of our natures, constitute education. But, since this 
is very broad and general, he restated it as “the culture 
which each generation properly gives to those who are to be 
successors, in order to qualify them for at least keeping up 
and if possible for raising the improvement which has been 
made.” He really falls back on the culture theory with a 
tincture of utilitarianism. 
Herbert Spencer held that satisfactory or complete liv- 
ing is the great problem of life. ‘The general problem 
which comprehends every special problem is — the right 
ruling of conduct in all directions under all circumstances. 
In what way to treat the body; in what way to treat the 
mind; in what way to manage our affairs; in what way to 
bring up a family; in what way to behave as a citizen; in 
what way to utilize all those sources of happiness which 
nature supplies; how to use all our faculties to the greatest 
advantage to ourselves and others; how to live completely? 
And this being the great needful for us to learn, it is, by 
consequence, the great thing which education has to teach.” 
(Education, p. 30.) In other words, the perfect man is the
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 163 
man able to live completely. However, the ideal individual 
is made in conformity to practical social demands. He 
is to live in a well-known, definite, actual world. Educa- 
tion is the process of shaping or moulding youth like unto 
this ideal. A rigid censoring of knowledge and subjects of 
curricula will fit education to accomplish this end. 
Kant’s perfect individual would be a monstrosity. With 
all his acumen he seems to have missed the importance of 
the social in the development of personality. His perfect 
individual is one possessed of perfect will. A perfect will 
is one with a reverence for a bare principle of duty. All 
inclination, feelings, desires, are emasculated. Only such 
an individual is fit for the kingdom of ends. So education 
must not train children to meet success in present society, 
but “in view of a better state, possible in the future, and 
according to an ideal conception of humanity and of its 
complete destination.” 
The idea criticised. — No doubt ideals of perfection must 
have a large function in all formulas of education. We 
shall always find an ideally perfect man of our way of 
thinking, hovering high up, or in the background of our 
thought. Yet the system or teacher who states the pur- 
pose of education for life in those terms is open to valid 
criticism. 
In the first place, it is too general and abstract to meet 
most useful and fundamental purposes of life. Mill felt this 
and limited his conception for practical purposes to culture. 
Spencer, with all his love for the concrete and actual, was 
nevertheless so much an individualist in his social philosophy, 
that he generalized his individual and elevated him to be 
the goal of education. Regarding the perfect man of Kant,
-P-A-G-E-172
ee ee ee 
164 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
one able to obey the mere principle of duty from profound 
reverence, even the philosopher himself was skeptical as to 
whether he would ever materialize. 
Perfection is relative. Ideas of perfection are products of 
particular epochs, classes, nations, and civilizations. The 
perfect man of Greece and of Rome differed as much from 
each other as that of the medieval church, in its monastic 
bias, differs from the ideally perfect man of America, Eng- 
land, Japan, or any modern European nation. The idea of 
perfection which is projected high above the earth, defies 
the demands of relativity, and attempts to serve for Japan, 
Europe and America, equally well, is fit only for a museum 
of intellectual monstrosities or to serve for a goal of leisure 
class education. 
In the second place, a practical difficulty has always 
arisen, when such a general end is accepted, in constructing 
a program of studies to realize it. It is the historical problem 
of the “what” and “when” of curriculum. Every 
educational objective presents a problematical wilderness 
here. Nevertheless, every such general end doubles the 
difficulty by pouring a flood into the wilderness. For the 
idea of perfection has usually been obtained by generaliza- 
tion upon generalization, forming a way which is unattain- 
able or impossible to the plain man. It has been hard to 
get up to that eminence, even in its logical establishment. 
But when a series of subjects have to be found, measured, 
criticised, which are the best of all possible subjects and just 
the very proper ones to be pursued by the individual to 
elevate him to this sublime height; and all others are to be 
rejected because they do not contain the magic virtues, there 
is a task before which even that of Hercules seems trivial.
-P-A-G-E-173
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 165 
Financing a billion dollar trust or refunding a national 
debt is a slight mental task in comparison. 
But the notion of perfection as an educational ideal posses- 
ses elements of value. However, it must be established in 
terms of real society, that is, made to obtain its content from 
an inductive study of the actual world. In doing this, we 
would probably first conceive an ideal society; that is, a 
society consisting of all its parts working harmoniously 
together, so that all persons in all the parts are justly served. 
But, second, since society is diversified, possessed of many 
functions, and since these functions are exercised by struc- 
tures, set aside for just those purposes, individuals are 
classified into working groups, each group possessing a 
knowledge and skill peculiar to its structural function. 
When we come to form our ideal for the individual, there- 
fore, it is for A functioning as banker; B functioning as 
farmer; C functioning as bricklayer; D functioning as 
printer, etc. Each one’s knowledge, character, citizenship, 
are wrapped up with his vocational function. 
The banker cannot be a perfect man nor approximate the 
perfect man if he is a poor or a dishonest banker. The 
same statement can be made of every other calling. All 
may and do have some things in common, for which a com- 
mon ideal training could be provided. But a great part of 
their training must be different to meet their special callings. 
Consequently we have ideals and ends, when we come to 
educate them, rather than just one ideal and end. This 
seems to me to be the part perfection, as an idea, would 
play in educational philosophy; just to furnish quite special- 
ized ideals or copies of men who are to work in the various 
walks of life,
-P-A-G-E-174
    
166 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
II, DISCIPLINE 
Meaning of discipline as end. — Discipline as an end of 
education is apt to be only less general, abstract, and 
socially unfit than perfection. Special discipline, or dis- 
cipline for specific ends, is always legitimate and valuable. 
When such objective has been maintained it has generally 
been industrial or professional. 
It is the idea of general discipline which is here considered. 
This is assumed to be the proper goal of all training and the 
program is made up of subjects which are supposed to be 
particularly well qualified to have a place because of their 
disciplinary value. It is assumed that general characteris- 
tics are a fit and full equipment for particular conditions of 
life, that there is power in general and universal ability for 
adjustment purposes. This kind of individual consists of 
certain essential qualities or powers. Moral probity, 
intellectual acumen, logical power, stability, and more, 
have been held to be some of the essential elements in this 
educational aim. Many have talked of a good general 
education to be followed by a special training as the com- 
plete educational arrangement. The first develops the 
general, and the second gives the specific. 
Possibility of general discipline. —Perhaps no one who 
has reflected much about this matter would affirm that 
there is not a rather general ability and power developed 
under the sway of experience. A great many people have 
great practical wisdom and are able to turn their hands to a 
number of things as a consequence of having had experience 
in the several lines. Men of great education, who have 
been long in student life and have covered several groups  
-P-A-G-E-175
  
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 167 
of subjects in a quite special manner, are possessed of 
ability to work fruitfully in any one of several lines. They 
also may have, and should have, developed a body of prin- 
ciples which would enable them to enter some department 
of business management and in a relatively short time 
prove measurably efficient there. Such a person would 
have developed a power to grasp situations, to construct 
imaginatively conditions in advance, and to respond elas- 
tically to mental requirements. But it would require long 
experience to develop the needed feeling of familiarity in the 
business which is the note of confidence and success in a 
large way; and a person too long in assimilative vocations, 
as so general a student would have to be, would quite likely 
have passed the age when that initiative, so needful to 
practical success, could be generated. 
The genius is about the only other individual who could 
be generally potent; and the nature of genius is to defy 
special programmes of study, to absorb that which suits its 
bent and ignore the rest. Perhaps the leisure class might 
be made available for the general end of training. Their 
financial sufficiency would render them independent of the 
stern necessity to be immediately useful; and their abun- 
dance of time would make possible that length and breadth 
of study by which general ability might be reservoired. 
However, when we contemplate an educational system, 
programme or process for community purposes, we cannot 
consider these special cases. (We have to deal with the 
conditions of the masses,Jas to their needs and possibilities. 
It is with this factor in plain view that we speak. 
General discipline psychologically untrue. —There is little 
or no psychological justification for the assertion that the
-P-A-G-E-176
    
168 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
average child may receive a general discipline by school train- 
ing. If some of the contributions of modern psychology 
are called into requisition and render their testimony, they 
will assert with almost the force of mathematical demon- 
stration that we know nothing of mind in general. or 
sciousness is always particular in its functioning)(1t has 
no general powers but is built up and is constituted of 
specific abilities. ) 
The illuminating apperceptive theory of conscious growth 
evidences that we build up new knowledge, make all our 
further acquisitions by means of the oldy The categories of 
knowledge are viewed as apperceptive groups in conscious- 
ness. The mind, in development, in order to expand and 
grow, becomes organized in various directions. Each kind 
of knowledge, or line of development, constitutes an apper- 
ceptive group. In order to expand more and to develop 
further, the expansion and development must take place 
in and by means of these groups. ‘The gld knowledge 
forms the basis of apprehending the new./ But the old is 
made of a special line of facts; and this special Jine deter- 
mines what the new shall be and how it is lodged. 
All biases, prejudices and specialties are lodged here. 
An Old Two-seed-in-the-Spirit-Predestinarian Baptist can- 
not drink at the fountain of Unitarianism. A conservative 
Republican or Democrat is unable, perforce, to sympathize 
with or to apprehend developing socialistic doctrines and 
programs. A man who has been trained, specialized for 
years, in natural science, and who then invades the realm 
of subjective sciences to write or speak with authority, 
usually provokes to action the risibility of those who are 
versed in the latter. He does not know because he does
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 169 
not comprehend the nature of the knowledge in the new 
field. 
Or should we draw upon the doctrine_of memory types 
we should reach the same conclusion: ¢hat functions and 
knowledges are specific and Peay that we have no 
power developed which is equally strong and serviceable all 
around? The dominant memory types are named for the 
special senses, whose images constitute the reproductive 
process. Undoubtedly the majority of persons are visual- 
izers, because the eyes, of all the sense organs, are the most 
responsively adjustable to demands. We use them most, 
and at length come to convert other sense impressions into 
sight images for reproductive purposes. Yet there are 
auditory types of memory, in those who reproduce their 
experiences by means of sound images; and motor types 
in those who reproduce in muscle images. 
In part, of course, the type may be determined by heredity) 
Natively, one is constituted so as to be more responsive to 
one kind of reproduction and builds on that basis.) This 
would likely be true of a musical genius who is able to hear 
over again an entire orchestral programme; or of a painter 
who holds, in mind form, perspective, location, shades, 
blendings, etc., of the various great pictures and landscapes 
he, has seen. 
But most of the types are formed and built up by use, 
in special directions, by perpetually calling on one kind of 
function for ean) Thus, the mail clerk can “throw” any 
box or bag in the dark; the ticket agent at once reaches 
the ticket, among thousands, that will carry you to Three 
Rivers or San Jose, and can state the fare instantly; the 
wine taster immediately. names the exact brand of vintage  
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
of each of hundreds of kinds of wine by the special shade of 
flavor. Each has trained his particular kind of function 
and the consequent reproduction is in line with it. 
Dr. W. C. Bagley reviews the experiments made by 
various psychologists to ascertain if there is such an effect as 
general discipline, and concludes: “The very decided 
trend of all the experimental evidence seems to indicate 
that the theoretical impossibility of a generalized habit — 
either ‘marginal’ or subconscious —is thoroughly sub- 
stantiated by accurate tests. There still remains, however, 
the widespread notion that formal training is generalized; 
and whatever cases may be adduced stand against the 
evidence from experiment.” 
Professor Thorndike disposes of such cases in three ways: 
(1) Where specific training is thought to spread out and 
effect other functions, it may simply mean that the individ- 
ual in whom this tendency seems to be evinced is really 
inherently more capable than the average) therefore, if he 
shows particular aptitude for the study of Latin, he may 
later excel in Greek, not because the pursuit of Latin has 
necessarily improved the functions that operate in the 
study of Greek, but because the individual is “bound” to 
excel in anything. (2) /Certain effects commonly attributed 
to discipline are really due to “ mere inner growth and matur- 
ity.”) (3) Faucstor tend to judge all children on the 
basis of their own childhood, a fallacious procedure, 
because educators are likely to be gifted individuals who 
could as boys and girls readily acquire and apply general 
ideas and habits. (The Educative Process, pp. 208-9). 
In practical matters there appears to be no common 
memory. \ We all work in grooves.) A man has ever so
-P-A-G-E-179
    
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 171 
good a memory for his line of facts, —say it is historical 
facts for his teaching work, —and yet immediately forgets 
the name of the person to whom he is introduced. He is 
able to recall historical names, but does not remember the 
names of his last term’s classes. The grocery man knows 
all his goods and prices, but forgets what his wife ordered 
him to send for dinner. The entrepreneur assimilates all 
sorts of prices, events and movements which affect his busi- 
ness; but his mind is not retentive of facts which have no 
perceptible relation to his line of work. Almost all teachers 
have commented on many students who have good abilities 
in one line but poor in another. That is, reproductive 
forms were specialized for them. 
Professor Bolton writes that James and other psycholo- 
gists have shown “that long practice in memorizing things 
of one kind in no way aids memory for totally different things. 
Even long attention to memorizing poetic writing does not 
assist much if any in the memorizing of prose. Still less 
would the poetry assist in the memorizing of chemical names 
and geological specimens.”’ (School Review, XII, 170.) 
Disadvantage of traditional education. — All this means 
that the subject matter of training is of great consequence 
in this way. We remember, so as to reproduce for use for 
the best results, those things which are in line with our 
interests; or, in other words, facts which are so organized 
and related within themselves and to our mental inclinations, 
that our heartiest attention and efforts are elicited. Our 
reproductive ability, or skill to use, which constitutes our 
working capital, or our “power” in future, depends on 
this specialization. If a line of study is pursued which 
absorbs the interest and which is organized within itself  
-P-A-G-E-180
    172 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
and in relation to the self, and yet which is not organically 
related to the world in which the individual is to work, the 
individual so trained is at a double disadvantage. He is 
compelled to wrench his interests, so as to turn them in a 
new direction, which is psychically a difficult and sometimes 
impossible thing to do; and, again, he is compelled to 
become acquainted with a new body of facts, the ones which 
he is to use in his business of life, and this is practically 
an exceedingly difficult undertaking. Such an unnatural 
training would be one which was dominantly classical and 
mathematical. 
A comprehensive scientific consideration of the modern 
situation must demonstrate how fundamentally anachronis- 
tic is the retention of the traditional culture studies, as fully 
preparatory to life in the present age. We have developed 
the thought of the specialized nature of the world on its 
social organization side. We have given evidence in previ- 
ous pages of the economic and scientific spirit of our times. 
Just here we may be permitted to supplement that previous 
treatment, regarding the scientific essence of civilization, in 
the way of a quotation from Professor Veblin. 
Our civilization has its apex in its capability of “an im- 
personal, dispassionate insight into the material facts with 
which man has to deal. . . . Compared with this trait the 
rest of what is comprised in the cultural scheme is adventi- 
tious, or at the best it is a by-product of this hard-headed 
apprehension of facts.” 
“ A civilization which is dominated by this matter-of-fact 
insight must prevail against any cultural scheme that lacks 
this element. This characteristic of western civilization 
comes to a head in modern science, and it finds its highest   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-181
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 173 
material expression in the technology of the machine 
industry. In these things modern culture is creative and 
self-reliant; and these being given, the rest of what may 
seem characteristic in western civilization follows by easy 
consequences. The cultural structure clusters about this 
body of matter-of-fact knowledge as its substantial core. 
Whatever is not consonant with these opaque creations of 
science is an intrusive feature in the modern scheme, 
borrowed or standing over from the barbarian past.” 
(T. Veblin, “‘ The Place of Science in Modern Civilization,” 
Amer. Jour. Sociology, March, 1906, p. 585.) 
Tf, therefore,(discipline must have some sort of a regard for 
the useful in life) in order to qualify as discipline, if studies 
and training must seek to get at the gist, the essential 
nature, of the things that are uppermost now, in order to 
be accounted truly disciplinary, it would appear that 
purely traditional culture should have a minor place in 
education. 
The demands of the social theory of education. — The 
insistence of the social theory of education would be upon 
particular disciplines. It seeks to show that the educa- 
tional programme should be made to meet the demands of 
the world as it is now constituted. It believes in character, 
power, etc., and also thinks that discipline is the fit means 
to produce them. 
But there can be no superiority of one kind of programme, 
as begetting discipline and power, over another. One line 
of study, and any line that is far enough developed to be 
organized as a science, contains equally good details and 
organizing principles with every other for disciplinary 
purposes. One set of facts, so long as interest is present,  
-P-A-G-E-182
174 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
is equal to any other as a field in which to exercise observa- 
tion, comparison and critical discrimination. To pursue’ 
subjects which are both disciplinary and useful is to get 
double value over following those which are alone disciplin- 
ary. If two curricula were supposed, one merely disci- 
plinary, that is, a power generator in general, and the other 
both disciplinary and specializing in nature, and the two 
were nearly balanced in respect to their disciplinary powers, 
then one should choose the curriculum which offered dis- 
cipline plus special knowledge of present things, since he 
would be obtaining double value for his time, as compared 
with the other course. 
Education needs to get rid of the aristocratic notion of dis- 
cipline, that a certain set of studies is more fit than others. 
Bain tried hard to show that language, natural science, 
and mathematics alone possessed true disciplinary value. 
The practical studies, economics, ethics, politics, etc., he 
discounted, because not exact enough sciences. On the 
same basis, one should have to deny disciplinary virtue to 
life experiences and world affairs, because life and business 
are not exact sciences. Most subjects formerly got into our 
courses of study because of their use for specific ends. 
Later on, when the contingent ends had passed away, they 
were retained on the plea of greater disciplinary value. 
Latin, for example, was the language of the civilized and 
scholarly world when it was placed in the schools of Europe, 
but it has long since been displaced in that capacity. 
Really, they have been retained for the same reason that 
the Chinese have for centuries, until recently, made civil 
service candidates pass examination in their mythical 
literature, exclusively.

Ill. CULTURE 
Meaning of culture. — Culture has been closely associated 
with discipline as an educational view. What was said 
under discipline will hold of culture, in so far as the two 
sets of ideas are identified. For purposes of clearness it 
will be advantageous to treat culture separately. 
There are a number of meanings of the term. In social 
evolution it stands for a grade of civilization. The various 
stages of civilization are said to be culture stages. Thus we 
have the savage, the barbarous, the semi-civilized and the 
civilized. Here it means all the institutions, ideas, customs, 
inventions, etc., peculiar to a given social grade. 
The Germans make culture a social matter. It is “a 
condition or achievement possessed by society. It is not 
individual.” It is not the same as civilization. ‘Civiliza- 
tion is the ennobling, the increased control of the elementary 
human impulses by society. Culture, on the other hand, is 
the control of nature by science and art.” (Small, General 
Sociology, p. 59.) 
In America, there is a use which identifies culture with 
the total spiritual content of a community or nation, leaving 
out the agencies by means of which it is carried on or secured. 
For example, following this usage, I once published an 
investigation entitled “‘ Culture Agencies of a Typical Manu- 
facturing Group,” in which I treated schools, churches, 
libraries, newspapers, social and study clubs, recreational 
agencies, and so on; in fact everything which seemed to make 
for spiritual improvement. 
It is well to have these meanings before us in discussing 
culture as an educational end. The latter throws the 
emphasis on culture as an individual matter. It dissociates,
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
or largely so, the intellectual stock of the one educated from 
the idea of the need of articulation with the world. 
In current usage there are clearly two meanings of culture 
+ education. One set of people think of culture as polite 
information. As in medizval Italy learning was esteemed 
as a note of class standing, because it gave advantageous 
status, so many persons to-day think of the schools as places 
where reputable information may be obtained. With them 
education is a social badge. It is the conference of the 
memory of names, mythologies, dates, books, and so on, 
which all supposedly educated people must have or be 
classed as vulgar. For instance, classical education in the 
southern states, even until quite recently, was held to be a 
gentleman’s course. Practical studies were looked upon as 
degrading. Many of our classical schools are still under 
this bias. And Booker T. Washington tells that the negroes, 
who come to Tuskegee, are prone to desire to pursue the 
study of Latin and Greek so they will not have to work. 
The other meaning given culture in education is broader. 
It is the idea of general information. Education should 
yield universal knowledge. The schools should turn out 
people who ‘know something about everything.’ There 
is little attention bestowed on the fitness of knowledge, 
because, evidently, it would be out of place where general 
information was to be secured. 
But this view is not so broad as it seems. What has 
really been done is to supplant a traditional subject or 
two with one or two more modern. Students cannot take 
everything. So they follow custom in selecting the things 
they do take. Instead of discovering what their function in 
society will be, and organizing their studies so as to yield

the best equipment with the time at their disposal, they “‘ go 
it blind.” This is the situation of the bulk of boys and 
girls in high schools and colleges. 
In either case culture is a state of mind which the individ-’ 
ual isto getinto. Itis the possession of a stock of knowledge. 
It is individualistic and without a social bearing. If it isa 
preparation for something, they know not what. 
Place of culture or intelligence in race evolution. —In 
order to examine this theory we must: fall back on race 
history, must have recourse to our biological and psycho- 
logical sciences in their genetic aspects, that we may dis- 
cover what function intelligence or culture has exercised 
for the individual in the evolutionary process. 
There we find that what we call life has been a functioning 
in a totality of conditions; or a series of adjustments or 
adaptations to a concrete, varying, and more or less varied 
environment. We are not concerned with what life may 
be ultimately. Biologically, the total life of any being, 
human or sub-human, seems to be about what Spencer 
called it —a series of adjustments of the internal to the 
external. 
In order to sustain the validity, integrity and welfare of the 
organism, let us say, the structure must adapt itself to the 
conditions which exist in any given place and time. As life 
has emerged from being localized, tied down to one mere 
spot with relatively changeless conditions, and has become 
locomotive, it has met a wider circle of elements and there- 
fore become subject to certain changing, variable factors 
which have to be met. Again, as life has developed into 
a social existence, where codperation and long distance rela- 
tions are sustained, the number of elements have multiplied
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
rapidly; and the variableness and uncertainty of circum- 
stances have consequently likewise increased. 
Now, it is conceivable that life could meet these changing 
conditions in either of two ways. By transforming the phys- 
ical organism, on the one hand, as rapidly as the external 
conditions changed in order to fit into them. Evidently 
this would be impossible and destructive to the integrity 
of the physical mechanism. On the other hand, it would be 
possible to invent ways of meeting or circumventing the 
kaleidoscopic variability impinging and threatening the 
integrity of the organism. 
This was the method followed. The permanent factors 
in the environment were picked out, and automatic machin- 
ery provided to meet them, as they occurred. All the 
automatisms and reflexes of the motor system met the per- 
manent and comparatively changeless demands of life. But 
new things arising, new conditions entering, were met by a 
growing complexity of brain, on the physical side; by an 
ever heightening consciousness or rational nature, on the 
side of mentality. Thus was developed the factor of pre- 
science, or anticipation, in behalf of life adjustments. The 
most fit are those beings which are able to see what will 
next “turn up” in the world, and be ready to meet it. 
Hence the function of intelligence is that of adaptation of life 
interests to conditions as they arise. It has its greatest work 
in approximating what the total conditions will be from 
time to time, what is the trend of affairs, what the great 
social stream is going to demand next; and setting to work 
to fit its human individual for the anticipated conditions. 
This has double bearing. It bears on the function of 
intelligence, or culture; and likewise cn the kind of knowl-
-P-A-G-E-187
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 179 
edge which should enter in to constitute this culture. It 
shows that to set up culture, as an end, is the reverse of 
the demand which the development process has hitherto 
placed upon it. It has demanded it should be a means to 
anend. Life is the end. Intelligence is a fit instrument to 
subserve that end. Asa state to get into, consequently, it is 
valueless in and for itself. 
Culture must therefore wear a special aspect and look 
towards some life service. Since this is true we have the 
quality or kind of knowledge prescribed for us which should 
chiefly enter into the make-up of culture. It will be a 
knowledge of matters which most directly bear on life 
adjustments, or we may say, present actual social adjust- 
ments. Those things should be obtained first in training 
which most directly furnish this accommodating ability. 
About that as a nucleus or core of education would be 
arranged other less and less direct elements in widening 
concentric circles. 
Non-traditional education meets the essentials of culture. 
—If we could catch society at the task of making an 
educational system when it was closest to the natural and 
least conscious of the artificial and conventional, we should 
find that the scheme of training thus worked out was framed 
to meet the essential points of that society’s culture-stage. 
We notice how true this is of natural peoples. “ The 
aborigines of North America had their own system of edu- 
cation, through which the young were instructed in their 
coming labors and obligations, embracing not only the 
whole round of economic pursuits —hunting, fishing, 
handicraft, agriculture, and household work — but speech, 
fine art, customs, etiquette, social obligations, and tribal

lore. By unconscious absorption and by constant inculca- 
tion, the boy and girl became the accomplished man and 
woman. Motives of pride and shame, the stimulus of 
flattery or disparagement, wrought constantly upon the 
child, male or female, who was the charge, not of the parents 
and grandparents alone, but of the whole tribe. . . . The 
Eskimos were most careful in teaching their girls and boys, 
setting them difficult problems in canoeing, sledding, and 
hunting, showing them how to solve them, and asking boys 
how they would meet a given emergency. Everywhere there 
was the closest association, for education, of parents with 
children, who learned the names and uses of things in nature. 
At a tender age they played at serious business, girls attend- 
ing to household duties, boys following men’s pursuits. 
Children were furnished with appropriate toys; they became 
little basket makers, weavers, potters, water carriers, cooks, 
archers, stone workers, watchers of crops and flocks, the 
range of instruction being limited only by tribal custom. 
Personal responsibilities were laid on them, and they were 
stimulated by the tribal law of personal property, which 
was inviolable. . . . 
“The Apache boy had for pedagogues his father and 
grandfather, who began early to teach him counting, to run 
on level ground, then up and down hill, to break branches 
from trees, to jump into cold water, and to race, the whole 
training tending to make him skillful, strong and fearless. 
The girl was trained in part by her grandmother, the disci- 
pline beginning as soon as the child could control its move- 
ments, but never becoming regular or severe. It consisted 
in rising early, carrying water, helping about the home, 
cooking and minding the children. At six the little girl

took her lessons in basketry with yucca leaves. Later on 
decorated baskets, saddle-bags, bead-work, and dress were 
her care.” (Handbook of American Indians, U. S. Bureau 
Ethnology, Vol. I, pp. 414-415.) 
Sparta is an example, in ancient times, of a primitive 
group of the military type whose culture consisted in beliefs, 
customs, and the practical arts of war and government. 
The training of the youths followed rigidly the lines of its 
peculiar type of culture, consisting almost exclusively in 
the severe discipline of the military camp and imposing the 
predatory virtues of conquerors and plunderers. 
Athens presented quite a different type. While resting 
on the economic basis of slavery, it was much more of an 
industrial and commercial people than Sparta. There was 
a larger need of intelligence for the supervision of business 
than in the case of Sparta. Slavery furnished leisure for the 
Athenians. Commerce enriched the city and furnished 
the means of creating the monuments of architecture and 
art which made it famous. To satisfy and fill in the leisure 
of the ruling class, amusements, recreation, theaters, 
schools, were established. The males were educated to 
carry on the government, to speak and write the language 
so as to enjoy its intellectual life, were given arithmetic for 
business purposes, and athletics for health and for partici- 
pation in competitive games. The training was adapted to 
the extant culture and to fit a leisure class race for its govern- 
ing place. 
The distinctive society of feudal times likewise exempli- 
fies the coupling and articulating of the training given the 
youth with the kind of culture which the ruling group appre- 
ciated and dealt in. The training did not attempt to give
-P-A-G-E-190
182 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
all the culture of the times, but the essential phases which 
were entwined with the peculiar life of the ruling class. 
The central feature of the life of the ruling class was chiv- 
alry, standing as it did for the whole institution of knight- 
hood. Every consequential feudal lord was surrounded by 
asocial court. This court was made up of his chief vassals. 
The schooling of the sons of the vassals took place in this 
court. They were to become knights, to further knight- 
hood, and their training was directed to this end. In the 
first stage the boy led the life of a page. His chief attention 
was given to instruction by the mistress of the castle, who 
taught him obedience, courtesy, and the duties of knights 
to ladies and religion. Besides this, he received instruction 
in the use of light arms. After fourteen, he was promoted 
to being a squire. In this period of six years he served the 
lord of the castle, attended him in a personal way, arming 
him for battle, going with him to war, and looking after his 
safety and welfare. At about twenty, he was knighted 
with imposing ceremonies and thus was graduated into 
knighthood. 
In all these cases, it will be noticed that the essential 
functions and services which the life conditions of the group 
imposed on its members were singled out and made points 
of attack in the scheme of training. Not merely the tradi- 
tional ideas were involved, but much more the practical 
arts and utilities of the group, in its struggle for existence, 
were grounded in the developing members. 
The practical lesson for us in these allusions to more 
primitive groups consists in the principle of their procedure: 
that of keeping in mind the specific services and labors the 
young were to assume and centering their training on 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 183 
those objects. That schooling was not merely mental, it 
was functional. It was not only moralizing, but specializing 
in view of the needs of the simple life. 
This lesson has its application for us. With our big, 
many-sided life and complicated social mechanism, it is 
not so easy as in primitive society to locate the essential 
traits of our grade of culture. The whole sum of our 
culture is enormous. No one mind can comprehend it in 
its details and fullness, were a whole life set aside to the 
task. Much more, it is seen to be absurd that our common 
schools should attempt to convey it. 
But there is evidently the possibility of discovering the 
principle or principles on which the mechanism which 
differentiates our age from preceding ages rests, and of 
embodying those principles as the common basis of our 
educational system. Beyond these principles, we must 
look to the callings and the vocations which the boys and 
girls are to adopt, and must fit our training scheme to give 
preparation for them. Both phases represent essential 
culture elements, essential to our peculiar kind of civiliza- 
tion. The principles of science rest under our industrial 
mechanism, and its further progress depends on the wide 
diffusion of science. The industrial and professional call- 
ings offer the technical elements which must be possessed 
before the individual is ready to actually articulate with 
working conditions and function productively in society. 
The kind of culture needed in education has already been 
developed in the chapter on democracy. 
General culture impracticable for the masses. —If we 
have in mind the high and broad meaning of culture, — 
knowledge about everything, —it is evidently impracticable
-P-A-G-E-192
184 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
to attempt to make the schools bestow it upon the great 
common people. It has previously been remarked that 
the contents and subject matter of our present civilization 
are too vast for even an able individual to absorb in a life- 
time of study. Were it possible for a man to attain it, it 
would require years and years of schooling which only a 
few favored individuals could afford to give. The ninety 
and nine of our population have to make their own way, and 
their schooling is necessarily brief. Moreover, as we have 
seen, 50 per cent or more of our children actually leave 
school before they reach the sixth grade. Probably no more 
than ro to 20 per cent finish the elementary schools. Cer- 
tainly in view of this situation, the bestowal of anything like 
culture upon the masses is out of the question, at least so 
long as conditions remain as they are. As was suggested 
before, a high-school training, at least, would be requisite 
for gaining even the general principles of the more needed: 
sciences. 
Further, culture for the sake of culture has historically 
yielded little. When the classics were at their height the 
world was fullest of bigotry and superstition. The Renais- 
sance was the establishment of the rational, the breaking 
away from form to matter. Also, classical culture at pres- 
ent seems to be negative in value. Professor Thorndike 
investigated how much culture students of classics possess. 
The results showed surprising ignorance of the simplest 
historical facts which might be expected would be gained. 
He concluded that the average high-school student was 
liable to be misinformed rather than instructed. 
On the emptiness and vanity of mere culture for culture’s 
sake, Dr. J. B. Angell, President of Michigan University, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
THE SOCIAL END OF EDUCATION 185 
has pithily spoken in his baccalaureate address, 1904. 
“The world is full of learned fools. There is an endless 
variety of them. Some are vain and chattering pedants, 
who fill the world with noisy clamor like a company of 
crows over their quidities and odds and ends of knowledge. 
I recall men of capacious memories, who with the utmost 
ease and complacency swallowed all the learning which 
could be fed out to them by a whole college faculty, but 
the learning never got out through their nerves, or their 
tongues, or even through their muscles to touch and stir the 
world.” 
There is now no room for intellectual jugglers or mental 
gymnasts, as those for the most part are who pursue science 
for science’s sake or seek culture because of culture in itself. 
Professor Cattell recently wrote that he doubts if interests 
in pure science should precede interests in practical or 
applied science. He even indicated that if he thought 
his work as psychologist was on the basis of the former, he 
should feel more akin to the sword swallower and sleight-of- 
hand performer than to the business man. 
In a speech before Princeton men in Chicago a short time 
ago, President Wilson, of Princeton University, depreciated 
mere learning for learning’s sake. “We want,” he said, 
“useful men, not men who have learning for learning’s 
sake, and who think they are better than others because 
they have something in their heads which is useless. . . . 
I do not believe that the natural carnal man was meant 
to sit down and read a book. I myself would rather see 
things than find them out from a printed book.”  
-P-A-G-E-194
  CHAPTER IX. STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 
Ir would be very difficult to conceive of a treatment of 
the educational programme, in anything like a large way, 
without some attention being given the subject of religion. 
The reasons which could be found for bestowing this notice 
upon it would certainly be very numerous. It is not neces- 
sary to catalogue them. 
The motive of this chapter is not to depreciate the good 
which ecclesiastical institutions have wrought, nor to forget 
the good which religious forces and sanctions legitimately 
used may do. But it is logically possible to esteem the place 
and service of religion, to hold in regard the ecclesiastical 
institutions as agencies in social control, and yet to main- 
tain that there are certain other institutions which shall be 
kept free and inviolate from direct religious teaching and 
ecclesiastical interference. Some of the reasons for this 
position will be developed in this chapter. 
I do not feel called upon to discuss extensively the ulti- 
mate nature of religion, its origin, or how it comes to be a 
part of the life of the average man. Undoubtedly such a 
broad discussion would have its value for educational pur- 
poses, but the questions it would raise would demand 
entirely too extensive a treatment in order to be effective. 
It seems advisable that our treatment should center on two 
points, first, a discrimination between morality and religion, 
as necessary to a fair conception of the problem of placing 
religion in the schools; and second, the question of expedi- 
ency as seen in the historic connections of state and church.

STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 187 
I. RELIGION AND MORALITY 
Distinction between religion and morals. —In my estima- 
tion the largest source of difference of opinion, among people, 
as to whether religion should or should not be taught in the 
schools, lies in confusing two sets of facts in our lives, which, 
scientifically, at least, are separable and distinct in origin 
and nature. It is common to identify morals and religion, 
in using one or the other term, making the term used 
cover both sets of facts. It is found that quite generally, 
when religion is mentioned, morality is in the mind of the 
speaker. 
I have in mind a very recent illustration of this. A group 
of six educators, as a state committee, were considering 
what subjects should enter into the course of study in the 
schools. There was fair unanimity until the subject of 
religion arose. At once the group split evenly. A warm 
discussion ensued. Finally, the suggestion was made that 
the term be defined. It was found that but two, possibly 
three, conceived morality and religion as distinct phenomena. 
It was also found that those who did not so distinguish 
were thinking of morality under the term religion, save in | 
one case. The exception alone would have religion, as 
distinct from morality, placed in the schools; and he ulti- 
mately abandoned his position in favor of the argument of 
expediency. 
I shall proceed to the attempt to distinguish between 
morality and religion. Perhaps the best way to clear up 
the difference between them is to make a brief sketch of 
their origin and early development. 
Men who devote themselves to the study of primitive 
society are in the habit of making the distinction and of  
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
drawing it clearly. It is their business to give us a scientific 
account of the origin and development of ideas and institu- 
tions. The consensus of the opinions of these men is that 
in developing into human beings social groups were formed. 
Original man had to evolve all his ideas, language, customs, 
institutions. In the beginning he was without religious 
ideas as he was without other ideas. Thus, living in groups, 
ways of associating grew up. These forms became cus- 
tomary. This was the beginning of the social order. It 
was also the beginning of the moral order. It was safety 
to hold together as a group. It was social safety to refrain 
from certain acts like theft, murder, etc. Such acts would 
destroy society. Hence they were wrong. To promote 
social welfare was right. Hence custom grew into a moral 
order. 
As men grew in intelligence, they began to explain things, 
ortry to. They began to be struck with certain occurrences, 
such as shadows which come and go, reflections of themselves 
and objects in the water, dreams in which they went to 
distant places and had strange experiences, echoes which 
duplicated their voices, etc. Knowing no science they came 
to believe all these things were evidences of another self, a 
self that could come and go. And they came to think this 
was the self that made this body do things, the active agent. 
By extension, all the actions of nature, such as storms, 
lightning, earthquakes, diseases, poisons, etc., had their 
explanation in the same manner. Everything was dual. 
Objects were filled with unseen agents or demons which 
worked through them, or only at times used them as tools. 
It was natural and logical, when this stage was reached, 
that men should try to appease the demons which might
-P-A-G-E-197
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 189 
injure them. We know that primitive man lived in constant 
fear of the gods. It takes him a long time to elevate the 
gods into objects to be adored and worshipped. A set of 
specialists, at first medicine men or necromancers, later 
priests, were developed to control the spirits. It was their 
business. They were the mediators. They were supposed 
to know the way of the gods and to be able to pacify them. 
This was religion. It was the way religion began, the way 
the ideas and practices took root. 
In the ordinary unfolding of things the medicine men and 
the priests discovered that they could use their positions 
as powerful means for controlling the conduct of men. 
To have the gods condemn or approve certain lines of social 
relations or conduct was a sure way to secure the kind of 
action desired. Hence it became common to designate 
moral actions as sanctioned by the gods; and immoral and 
anti-social, as disapproved. Thus it is seen that religious 
sanctions came to be used to reinforce formerly moral or 
social sanctions. ‘This makes plain why the two came to be 
identified so closely. When the higher religions emerged, 
built as they were on the lower, they naturally continued 
the practice of identification. But by tracing the origin 
and development of both the moral and religious orders in 
the early stages of society, we are able to distinguish between 
them quite clearly. It also helps us to perceive that the 
very center of religion is a sense of consciousness of super- 
human agencies. 
In so far as morality is identified with religion, the scope 
of religion is widened and its influence in human society 
is thereby made greater. But we must remember, in this 
case, that we are confusing two things which we are able to   
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
separate intellectually; and that we are imputing to one of 
these sets of phenomena attributes and characteristics which 
belong to the other only. So Benjamin Kid could claim 
that altruistic actions in society could have no rational 
sanction, since, in his conception, the human individual is 
rational when he is completely selfish, and that hence 
moral actions must be impelled by ultra-rational sanctions, 
that is, religious sanctions. But his conception of the psy- 
chology of man and organized society was a grotesque 
caricature, having no standing whatever among scientists. 
It is confusing to couple morality and religion and label 
them religion. We can account for the moral attributes 
of men and for their ethical actions without having 
recourse to religious explanations. What psychologists, 
moral philosophers, sociologists, and historians of religion 
do as scientific necessity should be our guide when we come 
to consider religion in its relation to education. 
Hence it is one thing to teach religion and another thing to 
teach morality. Religious teaching is bound up with a 
peculiar conception of the universe, and of man’s relation 
to that universe and to the infinite personality working in it. 
Moral teaching is based on social conduct, on relations 
between men; and morality flows naturally out of ideals 
of actions which we think should be realized among men. 
Jesus was a religious teacher in so far as he gave his 
philosophy of life, of the world, in relation to God. He 
was an ethical teacher when he discoursed on the relation, 
rights and duties of man to man. His ethical teachings 
are not true just because he stated them. He stated 
certain things because they were true in the nature of things. 
They had been said before by Jewish teachers. They had
-P-A-G-E-199
  
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION Igl 
been evolved out of social strivings and experiments. They 
have been evolved by other social groups in widely separated 
places, and have been stated by other teachers entirely 
independent of Jewish influences. 
The conclusion is, therefore, that it is possible to teach 
morality, to make children moral, without having recourse 
to the teaching of religion in the schools. Under the treat- 
ment of moralization will be found some suggestions about 
how this work of moralization may be done. Our schools 
are constantly moralizing the young without direct religious 
teaching. And the marvelous results attained by such 
experiments as Miss Brownlee’s demonstrate how much 
more could be accomplished if only our teachers were 
enlightened as to true methods of teaching. (See Brown- 
lee, Method of Child’s Training, Holden, Springfield, Mass., 
a pamphlet for ro cents, explaining the system.) Whether 
or not religion shall be taught in the public schools must 
be settled on grounds of expediency and justice. 
Il. PRESENT PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES 
Views on relation of school and religion. — There are 
three clearly definable views on the relation of public schools 
to religious teaching. One is that the province of the state, 
organized as government, is entirely secular. Since it is 
to serve all individuals of all shades of belief it must main- 
tain absolute neutrality towards all forms of belief and 
unbelief. If it teaches a particular form of belief, it 
discriminates against other forms and, hence, is unjust to 
those classes of its citizens which hold them. 
A second view is that entertained popularly by Christians, 
that the safety of the state depends on moral education, and
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
that this cannot be inculcated apart from religion. Thus 
Judge Story wrote: ‘‘Why does the state take money from 
your pocket to educate my child? Not on the ground that 
education is a good thing for him, but on the ground that 
his ignorance would be dangerous to the state. In like 
manner the state must teach in its schools fundamental 
religious truths; not because the child should know them 
in preparation for a future existence —the state is not 
concerned with the eternal welfare of its citizens — but 
because immorality is perilous to the state, and popular 
morality cannot be secured without the sanctions of reli- 
gion.” (Commentaries on the Constitution of the United 
States, Boston, 1883, p. 680.) 
A third position is that of Roman Catholics, some 
Anglicans, Lutherans, and others. It holds that while, of 
course, morality is necessary to the safety of the state, 
morality cannot be taught except by giving the definite 
religious teaching of their respective churches. Pope 
Pius IX said it is an error that “This system of instructing 
youths (the public school) which consists in separating it 
from the Catholic Church and from the power of the Church 
. may be approved by the Catholics.” A Catholic 
bishop said in Boston, “The state has no right to educate, 
and when the state undertakes the wor” >f education it is 
usurping the powers of the Church.” ); In the encyclical of 
r908 the Popé permits Catholics to send their children to 
public schools but puts a ban on “modernism.” 
Naturally, with such diverse positions, compromises have 
been made. Sometimes representatives of the various 
faiths have been allowed to teach the children of their 
communion in the public schools. None of these com-
-P-A-G-E-201
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 193 
promises are satisfactory. Deep and bitter feeling exists 
and often breaks out; as in the case of the A. P. A. of the 
United States, the religious education trouble in Manitoba, 
and the rebellion of the non-comformists of England 
against the Balfour Education Bill passed by Parliament. 
Generally, in the United States, the parochial schools 
system is resorted to by those who do not believe in state 
education. The following remarks on this plan are worth 
reproducing. 
“But even if the verdict be that they are so, the question 
still remains whether the church, by devoting the same 
energy and resources entirely to religious teaching, leaving 
instruction on ordinary branches to the public schools, might 
not have accomplished as much for the children now in 
parochial schools, and, in addition, have reached also the 
greater number of its children still in the public schools whom 
the parochial school does not reach; and whether it might 
not at the same time have lowered instead of raising those 
barriers of prejudice for which the Catholic people are not 
wholly responsible, but which it is their duty, as well as that 
of all other good citizens, to remove. The expenditure 
which has established and maintained these schools would, 
in the same communities, have built and manned a chapel 
in the vicinity of “sery considerable public school. The 
same number of ins.ructors that can teach a thousand 
children five hours a day could teach five thousand one 
hour a day.’”’ (School Review, Vol. XIII, p. 673.) 
Religious organizations could not agree on teaching. — 
The decision could not be made certain or definite, if the 
question of what to put in the schools in matters of religion 
were left to the churches or ecclesiastical organizations.

There is in America a diversity of religions in the first place. 
Not only it is Jew and Gentile, but of the Gentiles the faiths 
are diverse. 
Of the Christians there are diverse bodies of believers 
holding the old historic faith, and not a few a new: such 
as Christian Scientists, Zionists, Flying Rollers, etc. Old 
line Christianity is severely divided and broken; not only are 
there Catholic and Protestant, but of the latter there are 
many different denominations with differing doctrinal bases; 
and the great denominations are broken into multitudinous 
sects, some having as many as a dozen or more such sects. 
As far as Catholics and Protestants are concerned there 
never has been, and seemingly will not soon be, any agree- 
ment in theological views so as to permit of doctrinal instruc- 
tion. Moreover, their views with reference to the use which 
should be made of the Bible in popular instruction are so 
divergent that there is little hope of finding unanimity. 
First, doctrinal instruction is barred out by this disagree- 
ment. Second, Catholics would withhold the Bible from 
use in schools where any but teachers of their faith could 
regulate its reading and possible interpretation. 
But if the Bible is not to be interpreted to the average 
public school pupil, exceedingly little of the meaning will 
be gained, and little or no interest and attention given to 
the public reading. I tested this at various times in my 
own classes in institutions where the Bible was read, but 
usually not interpreted. I have asked classes, whose mem- 
bers numbered from fifteen to forty pupils, for the Bible 
passage of that morning’s reading. Seldom have any 
known the subject, and several times not one could suggest 
an idea or phrase read on that day. And many of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 195 
students were of college rank, were intelligent, and most of 
them were church members. They readily acknowledged 
that they seldom, if ever, paid any active attention to the 
Bible readings. . 
To make Scripture reading of practical importance, the 
passage should be interpreted. But interpretation bears 
the bias of the interpreter as molded by some ecclesiastical 
viewpoint. Hence it verges on doctrine which is disputed 
territory. 
If we should take up the case as between Mormons and 
Christians the possibility of common ground is still more 
remote. The Book of Mormon contains so much that is at 
variance with Christian teaching that neither side could 
tolerate the teaching of the other. And the same is true of 
Jew and Christian quite largely. Both religious parties 
might unite on the reading of the Old Testament but not 
on the New. Neither could they agree on the interpretation 
of many passages of the Old Testament. 
Among denominations of Protestant Christians the greater 
unity and convergence would be found. Probably all 
could consent to Scripture readings. Perhaps the majority 
might stand for interpretation of the majority of passages 
which are only of ethical import. And, no doubt, after a 
further sifting of religious sentiments, this will be found to 
be the largest possible basis of religion in the schools, with 
reference to Protestant Christians. 
Religion a private matter.— The nature of positive 
religion makes it a private affair. Christianity in its nature 
is a positive religion, because its fundamental conception 
and doctrines are gained from historic documents. These 
documents, like all other records, have to be tested as to
-P-A-G-E-204
  | 
196 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON BECO 
their authenticity or otherwise by literary and historical 
criticism. The evidence is such that, while many accept 
it as sufficient, either after consideration or on faith, others 
do not find it convincing. 
The positive character of Christianity ney be seen by 
two considerations. First, in being based on a miraculous 
intervention on the part of God; second, in being mediated 
through an authoritative church, the latter position being 
maintained in addition to the other by the Catholic wing of 
Christianity. The great majority of Protestants hold to 
the former. The believers who make religion a natural 
evolution, and who view Christianity as the upper stage of a 
natural, rational unfolding, are very few and are considered 
heterodox by the great mass of believers. 
The following definitions of religion, by representative 
theologians, will indicate how Christians identify it with or 
hold it as dependent on revelation. “Religion, in its most 
general sense, is the sum of the relations which man sustains 
to God, and comprises the truths, the experiences, actions 
and institutions which correspond to or grow out of those 
relations. The Christian religion is that body of truths, 
experiences, actions, and institutions which are determined 
by the revelation supernaturally presented in the Christian 
Scriptures.” (A. A. Hodge, Outlines of Theology, p. 15.) 
“Christianity is the revelation of God through Jesus 
Christ whereby reconciliation and a new spiritual life in 
fellowship with himself are brought to mankind. The 
religion of Christ is inseparable from the life and character 
of its Founder and from his personal relations to the race 
and to the community of his followers.” (George P. 
Fisher, History of Christian Doctrine, p. x.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 197 
“Religion is the union of man with God, of the finite with 
the infinite, expressed in conscious love and reverence.” 
The Christian religion is “that which rests in the conscious- 
ness of the redemption of the world, through Christ as our 
personal Saviour.” (H. B. Smith, Iniroduction to Christian 
Theology, pp. 52-53.) 
“Religion and Revelation are correlative terms; that is, 
the relation in which man places himself to God in religion 
presupposes the relation in which God has placed himself 
to man in revelation; without revelation there can be no 
religion.” (Article, Religion, by Koestlin in the Schaff- 
Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge.) 
Since the very center of Christian doctrine is individual 
salvation through an act or life of faith in the historic person 
Christ, it becomes at once apparent that the acceptance or 
rejection of this doctrine must rest on voluntary grounds. 
Any agency is perverted which seeks to employ force upon 
individual or individuals to make it accepted. Teaching of 
the doctrine must be heard optionally. To say that the 
state or government in the person of its schools shall make 
compulsory the maintenance of and attendance upon 
exercises and instruction, embodying the above or other like 
documentally evidenced doctrine, is to propose a contradic- 
tion. Much better is it to leave the whole function of reli- 
gious teaching and exercise to that social organization, which 
is not only highly specialized and adapted to render that 
service, but is so situated that it offers its teaching to all 
who will accept it of their own accord, and compels none. 
The injustice of compulsory religious exercises and 
instruction is further seen when we have regard to the 
irreligious and non-religious portions of our population,

The day is past, fortunately, when these people may be 
arrogantly lumped off as pagans and treated as having 
no rights. For much over one half of the people of this 
nation are nominally non-religious, that is, they do not 
have enough interest in religious matters to connect them- 
selves with organizations whose sole purpose or business it 
is to promote religious matters. To a large part of this 
non-religious element, some sort of religious exercise‘would 
not be objectionable, although it would not command its 
attention. To another very large element, however, such 
exercise would prove highly objectionable. It is this ele- 
ment whose rights in the schools must be considered. It is 
the business of the church, as a purely voluntary organiza- 
tion, to take religion to these people. It is not the business 
of the political organization, known as the government, to 
force religion upon them in any form. 
Ill. THE CHURCH RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGION 
Division of labor among institutions. —In considering 
where religious teaching should be given, several items 
appear before us. The first is the relation of social institu- 
tions to each other and their division of labor. In a pre- 
vious chapter, the point was made that society has devel- 
oped institutions which are specialized agencies for the 
satisfaction of the several fundamental interests. It will 
be sufficient here to refer briefly to that treatment. (See 
Chapter IV, second division.) It was shown that because of 
its specialization, in order to satisfy a given line of interests, 
a given kind of institutions, such as the religious, can attend 
to the business better than any other agency. It would be 
a waste of social energy, uneconomical, to permit another
-P-A-G-E-207
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 199 
  agency to step in to do the special work. And, if another 
agency can do the work better than the institutions special- 
ized for that purpose, it is a sign that the institution to 
which the social work belongs is incapable and needs reor- 
ganization. Thus, it is the function of the ecclesiastical 
organizations to satisfy the religious demands and interests 
of the individual. It has been growing more and more 
specialized for this particular kind of service for many 
centuries. It is irrational to suppose that any other agency 
can do the work half so well, because other organization 
groups emphasize other interests and are built specially to 
meet them and not the religious. 
Now, it isa mark of social evolution to have these divisions 
of labor clearly distinguished. In political matters, the 
various departments of government have become clearly 
differentiated within the last few centuries. It is conceded 
to be an advance over the situations where there was a 
medley of functions. Trouble ensues whenever any de- 
partment oversteps its bounds so as to encroach on the 
others. Likewise, in business management, various depart- 
ments have grown up within an enterprise, each with its 
own particular function. Railroad systems, the steel 
trust, and other enterprises are made up of such distinct 
departments. There is no mixing of duties. Responsibil- 
ity must be definitely located. 
The church responsible for religious training. — The 
same must hold, and must more and more hold, true of our 
social organizations. It is true that at one time the church 
was the chief instructor. It established and kept schools. 
Yet in them its chief emphasis was religion. We have 
evolved beyond that position and are in the presence of
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCA’ ION 
other great evolutions. Other organizations have been 
founded and specialized for the work of instruction, — 
the public schools. They emphasize the intellectual and 
the vocational side of training, and the further they develop 
the more this is true. They have taken over this intellectual 
and vocational training function, because they can do it 
better than the church, because they can emphasize the 
things society in general needs; while the church is bound 
to emphasize the things which are for its interests and will 
preserve its power. It has developed that the interests of 
society have been broader than those of the church; and 
hence to leave the work of training individuals for general 
social interests in the hands of a social organization whose 
interests are special and partial is felt to be illogical and 
unsafe. 
There are those who are seeking to place religion in the 
public schools who do not see the diverse nature of the duty 
and function of church and school. A writer on religious 
psychology goes so far as to demand that religion shall be 
put into the schools as a subject to be taught; that teachers 
shall be examined by school boards on religion; and that 
no one shall be permitted to teach who cannot stand the 
rigid test. Were this possible it would take us back toward 
medieval conditions more than a hundred years. 
Professor Coe also patronizes those who have not evolved 
beyond what he calls the “‘ pre-biologic ” attitude of mind 
so as to see thingsas he does. The biologic view sees life as 
an adjustment to an environment. He holds that the 
adjustment is to the total environment and that preparation 
for life consists in getting ready to respond to all that is in 
the environment. Hence, since religion has always been
-P-A-G-E-209
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 201 
in the social environment, and is at the present time 
(think of the unchurched masses), education can only be 
complete which trains religiously. (School Review, Vol. 
XIII, p. 581.) 
If this position were met in the spirit of the writer just 
cited, we should have to regard it as the symptom of the 
“ pre-sociologic ” attitude of mind. For the sociological 
conception of adjustment to the environment has supple- 
mented the biologic by indicating that the factor of intelligent 
selection has become dominant in social adjustments; and 
that to accept all in a situation, just because it is there and 
has always been there, is quite irrational. Social adjustment 
of the higher order is based on selective discrimination. 
It is well to note the statement of Dr. Harris, who 
(although he may have been in the “ pre-biologic ” stage) 
finely indicates the fitness of the church as a special institu- 
tion to carry on religious instruction. ‘ The principle of 
religious instruction is authority; that of secular instruction 
is demonstration and verification. It is obvious that these 
two principles should not be brought into the same school, 
but separated as widely as possible. Religious truth is 
revealed in allegoric and symbolic form, and is to be appre- 
hended not merely by the intellect, but by the imagina- 
tion and the heart. . . . In religious lessons, wherein the 
divine is taught as revealed to the human race, it is right that 
the raw, immature intellect of youth shall not be called 
upon to exercise a critical judgment, for at his best he can- 
not grasp the rationality of the dogmas which contain the 
deepest insights of the religious consciousness of the race.” 
“The church has through long ages learned the proper 
method of religious instruction. It elevates sense-perception
-P-A-G-E-210
a a ee ae FE MENT N SYP IRe AE BSS ee ee ee ee ee ee. age, i 
202 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
through solemn music addressed to the ear and works of 
art which represent to the eye the divine self-sacrifice for the 
salvation of man. It clothes its doctrine in the language of 
the Bible, a book sacredly kept apart from other literature, 
and held in such exceptional reverence that it is taken 
entirely out of the natural order of experience. The sym- 
| bolic language of the psalms, the prophets and the gospels 
has come to possess a maximum power of suggestiveness, 
powerful to induce what is called the religious frame of 
mind. The highest wisdom of the race is expounded before 
the people of the congregation in such language and such 
significant acts of worship as to touch the hearts of young and 
old with like effect. 
“We must conclude, therefore, that the prerogative of 
religious instruction is in the church, and that it must 
remain in the church, and that in the nature of things it 
cannot be farmed out to the secular school without degen- 
erating into a mere deism without a living Providence, or 
else changing the school into a parochial school and de- 
stroying the efficiency of secular instruction.” (Proceed- 
ings of the N. E. A. 1903, p. 353-) 
IV. HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION OF SEPARATION 
Evils of ecclesiastical supremacy. — The baneful effects 
on progress of an intrenched religion are shown by Botsford, 
in the case of ancient Egypt. The Egyptians insisted on 
preserving the customs and the wisdom of the past until they 
refused to learn anything new. “ By the end of the Hyksos 
period all progress had ceased. The priests had reduced 
the details of worship to fixed forms, from which no one 
dared depart. As the books now prescribed what they,  
-P-A-G-E-211
59 a a Si a a a ee ra al cites. 
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 203 
the king, and the high magistrates should do at every hour 
in the day, the upper class became the slaves of ceremony. 
In the same way they regulated the arts and sciences, so 
that the future artists merely imitated existing models, and 
physicians were strictly held to the written word. Mean- 
time the wealth of the people had gone to the gods, supersti- 
tion had robbed their sound moral precepts of all meaning, 
their intellectual life had come to a standstill. . . . Egypt 
was a mummy.” (Botsford, Ancient History, p. 14.) Pre- 
viously the Egyptians had made rapid progress along 
scientific and industrial lines. We owe to them the begin- 
nings of many arts and sciences. Had their progress not 
been throttled by priestcraft and ecclesiastical formalism 
much of modern advancement would doubtless have been 
made then. 
A few sentences from Seebohm concerning the influence 
of the church system, when it was supreme in Europe, will 
bear on this point. “The ecclesiastics held in their hands 
the keys, as it were, not only of heaven but of earth. They 
alone baptized; they alone married people (though unmar- 
ried themselves); they alone could grant a divorce. They 
had the charge of men on their death-beds; they alone 
buried, and could refuse Christian burial in the church- 
yards. They alone had the disposition of the goods of 
deceased persons. When a man made a will, it had to be 
proved in their ecclesiastical courts. If men disputed their 
claims, doubted their teaching, or rebelled from their 
doctrines, they virtually condemned them to the stake, by 
handing them over to the civil power, which acted in sub- 
mission to their dictates... . As Latin was the language 
of learning, so Rome was the capital of the learned world.
-P-A-G-E-212
a a aa a i CT Ty 
204 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
Thus the learned world was closely connected with the 
ecclesiastical system. Learned people were looked upon 
as belonging to the clergy; and the Pope had long claimed 
them as subjects of his ecclesiastical empire. . . . Knowl- 
edge was tied down by scholastic rules which had grown up 
in times when the ecclesiastics were the only educated 
people. . . . The schoolman . . . looked at everything with 
ecclesiastical eyes. . . . Matters of science, e.g., whether 
the earth moved round the sun or the sun around the earth, 
were settled by texts from the Bible, instead of by examining 
into the facts. So there was no freedom of inquiry even in 
scientific matters. . . . Thus the scholastic system neces- 
sarily kept both science and religion the property of a clerical 
class, and out of the hands of the common people, to whom 
Latin was a dead language; while at the same time it kept the 
learning even of the learned world shackled by scholastic 
tules.” (Seebohm, Era of the Protestant Revolution, Chap. 2.) 
Evils of fusion of church and state. — The evils of mixed 
relation of church and state, as begun in Nicene and post- 
Nicene times, are set forth as follows by Schaff: ‘“ An 
inevitable consequence of the union of church and state 
was restriction of religious freedom in faith and worship, and 
the civil punishment of departure from the doctrine and 
discipline of the established church. . . . In the first three 
centuries, the church, with all her external lowliness and 
oppression, enjoyed the greater liberty within, in the develop- 
ment of her doctrines and institutions, by reason of her 
entire separation from the state. After the Nicene age all 
departures from the reigning state-church faith were not only 
abhorred and excommunicated as religious errors, but were 
treated also as crimes against the Christian state, and hence
-P-A-G-E-213
  
STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 205 
were punished as civil penalties; at first with deposition, 
banishment, confiscation, and, after Theodosius, even with 
death. 
“This persecution of heretics was a natural consequence 
of the union of religious and civil duties and rights, the 
confusion of the civil and the ecclesiastical, the judicial 
and the moral, which came to pass since Constantine.” 
(Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Vol. ILI, section 27.) 
Although in theory the church in this period adhered to the 
principle that she should impose only spiritual penalties, 
excommunication in extreme cases, yet, because of her 
union with the civil power, she practically confounded the 
relation of law and gospel, in theory approved civil punish- 
ment of heretics, and not seldom urged the state to such 
measures. 
Even Augustine, one of the greatest and sweetest of church 
fathers, who started with the belief that heretics and 
schismatics should be approached only by instruction and 
conviction, later recanted and advocated for them state 
punishment. This he based on his views on and the actual 
relation of church and state. If the state may not punish 
heresy, neither should it be allowed to punish murder or 
adultery. Soon after him Leo the Great advocated even 
the penalty of death for heresy. It was this theory and 
initiative practice that led eventually to spiritual despotism, 
persecution, and the fearful Court of the Inquisition. 
The Reformation proved that Christianity and external 
organization are not identical, yet a real revolution in 
thought was not accomplished in regard to religious tolera- 
tion until the eighteenth century. After the Reformation, 
many acts of intolerance and bigotry took place, even in
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
England, the most progressive of European countries, by 
reason of the fusion of the ecclesiastical and political organi- 
zations. Sometimes it was Catholic against Puritan and 
sometimes it was Puritan against Catholic. In colonial 
America, wherever there was a state church, intolerance 
of differing religious and non-religious views was the rule. 
Suffrage rights were based on ecclesiastical standing and re- 
ligious belief. Heretics were dealt violently with. Quakers, 
the best of immigrants, were persecuted in Massachusetts. 
Dissenting Puritans were expelled, as were Roger Williams 
and Anne Hutchinson. Intolerance drove Hooker and his 
flock to the Connecticut valley. In Virginia, the Puritans 
were ejected, when the royalist and established church 
adherents of Charles I came over in large numbers. 
The American system the remedy. — America has given 
to the world a great idea in its method of adjusting the 
church and state to each other. The germs of all our 
representative political institutions are to be found some- 
where in earlier civilized attempts. American colonies 
found their political rights already stated in various English 
constitutional documents, from the great Charter down. 
Particularly, the ‘‘ Agreement of the People,” drawn up 
in 1648-9, contains the distinctive political germs later 
developed and realized in America. 
But in the Rhode Island agreement entered into between 
Roger Williams and his associates is contained the first con- 
stitutional separation of church and state known to history. 
“‘ Williams founded his settlement on the basis of absolute 
civil equality and of absolute freedom in religious affairs. 
There was religious freedom in the earlier settlement of 
Maryland, but it was not the same liberty that prevailed
-P-A-G-E-215
  STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 207 
in Providence. The former was rather in the nature of 
toleration, the latter was adopted as a principle of govern- 
ment. It is to Roger Williams and to the settlers of Provi- 
dence that the student must look for the origin of one of 
the most important principles underlying the American 
form of government, — the separation of church and state, 
which necessarily implies absolute religious freedom. For 
this Williams deserves a place beside the most prominent 
statesmen of the revolutionary and constitutional periods.” 
(Channing, Student's History of the United States, p. 87.) 
At the time of the formation of the Constitution of the 
United States, this idea was permanently embodied in that 
document in the following statements: “‘ Congress shall 
make no law respecting an establishment of religion or 
prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” ‘‘ No religious test 
shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of 
public trust under the United States.” 
The preceding pages have set forth the evils which arise 
under confounding the two sides. The American system 
has afforded a large amount of peace and toleration in the 
United States. James Bryce has called it the “ greatest 
contribution ” America has made to the history of the 
world. The arrangement has proved so successful that 
other nations are imitating it as far as circumstances will 
permit. The tendencies in Europe are toward separation. 
Within the year 1905, France consummated its task of 
divorcing state and church, and of placing its schools on a 
non-ecclesiastical basis, and freed from direct religious inter- 
ference. England’s educational system is about bankrupt, 
due to state-church control. 
The present Liberal Parliament has made various attempts
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
to remedy the educational legislation which was passed un- 
der Premier Balfour. The aristocratic House of Lords, the 
support of privilege, has thus far successfully mutilated 
proposed secularizing bills sent up by the Commons. The 
reformed churches in England are fighting for justice, and 
many of their members have refused to pay taxes levied 
under the Balfour law to support the schools. Feeling has 
been intense. The liberal ministry has threatened to make 
an end of the House of Lords because of its opposition to 
educational and other reforms. There has been an equal 
or greater strain in France over secularizing the schools, 
for which the papacy at present entertains a decidedly 
hostile feeling towards that nation. 
In Germany there is much secret dissatisfaction with the 
religious requirements in the schools. There is a strong 
belief that religious instruction as carried on there does more 
harm than good. Says Professor Hanus: “ After studying 
it about two years ago, and its effects, as viewed by many of 
the teachers with whom I talked on the subject, and as 
revealed in the growing apathy to religion among the 
people, I strongly feel that it does not serve its purpose, 
but is subversive of it. I quote a memorandum or two from 
my notebook. A state inspector of schools said to me, 
‘The domination of the church is our greatest obstacle in 
the path of educational progress.’ And the principal of a 
large city high school said, after I had told him we had no 
instruction in religion in our public schools: ‘ You are quite 
right. Never permit it. It is subversive of the very ends 
for which it is maintained in our schools.’ And a ‘ gymna- 
sium ’ teacher of prominence summed the whole matter up 
admirably, to my mind, when he said at the end of an earnest
-P-A-G-E-217
  STATE EDUCATION AND RELIGION 209 
conversation on the subject: ‘In the lower grades it is 
without effect, and in the upper grades it breeds hypocrisy.’ ” 
(Beginnings in Industrial Education, p. 150.) 
The state certainly has no business teaching religion for 
the sake of religion. But ifit had, there is evidence to show 
that Christianity has made greater gains in the colleges of 
America under separation than under ecclesiastical control. 
Thus under that régime in the last of the 18th century and 
the first of the roth, professors of religion in our colleges 
ranged from 12 to 5 per cent of the attendance. By 1825 
it was 25 per cent, by 1858 it was 4o, 45 in 1860, and over 
50 per cent in 1900. This period of growth is coincident 
with the secularization of the schools and the rise of the 
public school system. “ Religion, like patriotism, thrives 
under freedom. The gains to religion sketched above have 
all taken place, I repeat, under a system of free public 
elementary schools, free public high schools, and free state 
universities, all without explicit or formal instruction in 
religion.” (Hanus, Beginnings in Industrial Education, 
Pp. 163-5.) 
It is my firm conviction that morality can be taught in 
the schools without religious teaching. We have never 
had a finer display of ethical sentiment in the history of 
our country or of the world than is taking place now. The 
foundation of that sentiment is in the rational understanding 
of the problems which confront us, according to the light 
of the teachings and writings of great social reformers in 
and outside of universities, on the platform, in the pulpit 
and in legislatures. The appeal has not been religious but 
to the social and ethical interests of men. Perceptions of 
just and fair relations come out of a development of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 SOCIAL DEMANDS ON EDUCATION 
intellectual nature of man. In developing his intelligence 
to understand the system of society in which he is placed 
the schools have their greatest warrant, along with the 
development of the sense of responsibility, justice and 
service through their work and organization. 
At least it is amply shown that for purposes of expediency, 
for reasons of safety to the state and of freedom to the 
church to carry on its special work for society, it is imperative 
that the American system of relating church and state be 
maintained.

The problem.— We have reached the point where some 
attention must be paid the problem of how to bring about 
the socialization of education. It would be in vain to talk 
so much about the theoretical and practical grounds and 
needs for a thoroughgoing readjustment of the schools to 
meet the modern conditions, if some way could not be laid 
out, or better some principles laid down, which would lead 
to the end, or be regulative in reaching it. 
As I see the situation confronting educators to-day there 
are two essential things which must be done. One of these 
tasks is the development of a regulating principle which 
shall serve as the criterion in all educational phases and 
grades for the selection of the content or subject matter 
of training. By the use of such a test, if one can be found, 
a teacher having to settle the question of what to admit 
into the school and what to reject would be placed in a 
commanding position. Where now are darkness and be- 
wilderment there would be light and direction. One of the 
most pitiable features of the present situation, and yet one 
of the most hopeful, is to observe the general groping about 
2Ir ¢ 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
    2t2 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
of educators in search of some guide of what is just the most 
important of all educational content to put into courses of 
study. 
The other essential task, which must be performed before 
our schools will be completely readjusted, is the appli- 
cation of the principle or criterion to every programme, to 
every subject, and to every subject in each of its successive 
stages of development throughout the grades from the 
lower to the higher. This really will require a double proc- 
ess. By means of the criterion the appropriate subject 
matter will be located and admitted. Then it becomes the 
business of the child psychologist to graduate this material, 
assigning what shall be presented in each of the school 
grades. The criterion will decide the what. Psychologists 
will decide the when and the how. 
It is not the purpose of this book to undertake the work 
of the psychologist. Rather, the work undertaken is to 
develop the justification of the criterion which should be 
used, to show in a general way what kind of matter it would 
demand in constructing a school programme, —a coutse of 
study as a whole; and the effect it would have on some 
particular subjects which are found in the schools, if ap- 
plied to them. In other words, I am concerned with prin- 
ciples rather than with the application of principles to all 
details. With the establishment of principles, educators 
will quickly work out the application. In fact, forthcoming 
textbooks indicate that a principle is sighted, and that the 
details are being worked out in several lines. 
Summary of previous conclusions. — Before taking up 
the work of this part, it may be of use to the reader to sum- 
marize the points developed in former parts of this work, 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  CRITERION OF SOCIALIZATION 213 
for the purpose of exhibiting our conclusions till now and of 
concentrating them on the problem now confronting us. 
1. The end of education is to secure the power of adjust- 
ment to the social environment in order to control it or to 
make use of it. . 
2. Since the social environment is specialized into voca- 
tions, under pressure of the division of labor, education 
must be likewise specialized to meet specific situations. 
3. Traditional and formal methods of training, which 
rest on the supposition that there is a general discipline, do 
not qualify for modern actual diversity. Specialized insti- 
tutions and occupations demand special disciplines. 
4. In order to decide what educational phases should be 
emphasized, present social demands must be consulted. 
It is seen that the economic, particularly the commercial 
and industrial, demands are most pressing. Hence indus- 
trial and commercial training must receive a very much 
larger recognition. 
5. In order to meet the world-wide economic demands of 
organized society, varieties of community interests or com- 
munities with different interests have arisen; such as com- 
munity A, dominant interest agriculture; community B, 
dominant interest commerce; community C, dominant 
interest manufacture; community D, dominant interest 
mining, etc. The demands of democracy, in its all around 
life, and the necessary tendency of a progressive society to 
become more differentiated in structure, and, consequently, 
more integrated and interdependent, insist on education for 
community interests. 
6. Pathological social conditions are related to education. 
Education of the right sort may not be able to cure all the
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
ills of society. But it is proved, for instance, that pauperism 
and crime, to a considerable extent, come out of a lack of 
vocational training and definite occupation. 
Education must, therefore, seek to prevent the production 
of paupets and criminals, by fitting individuals to do some- 
thing in particular and thus to be socially valuable. In so 
far as the race problem is pathological, it too demands 
vocational training in order to make the negro race economi- 
cally independent, first of all, as necessary to other lines of 
development. 
7. The demands of sex difference must be met with ap- 
propriate training to answer to the division of labor based 
on sex callings. The domestic sciences must be introduced 
for women to prepare them adequately for home-making 
and housekeeping. 
8. Ethical training of the individual must be attended to 
in school life. Direct teaching, but mostly social training 
in school and class conduct, are to be the means of this. 
9. The demands of evolving democracy must be met by 
seeking to secure in the young cooperative efficiency, the 
ability to conduct community affairs, and such essentials of 
culture as insure the safety and perpetuity of social welfare. 
to. Negatively, religious training should not be a part 
of the state school system, because there is a more specialized 
institution to conduct religious culture, because of inter- 
denominational strife, because positive’and documentary 
religion is a matter of private judgment, and because expe- 
diency dictates complete separation of state and church. 
Reconstruction the only valid method of socialization.— 
Various methods of bringing school and society together 
have been proposed and put into use. There is the attempt
-P-A-G-E-223
  CRITERION OF SOCIALIZATION 215 
to infuse the ideals of the school into the community. In so 
far as the schools are really effective and sufficient this is 
a worthy attempt. In so far, however, as the schools are 
backward and defective the result is negative. 
Another method is that of “ exploiting ” the community 
to bring its life and ideals into the school in order to trans- 
form the latter. Pupils and students are sent out to study 
local institutions and other phenomena of society. The 
observations are worked over in class. The actual world is 
thus introduced. 
This is most valuable for university work to preserve the 
students from abstractions, and as contributive to informa- 
tion. Even in elementary schools it can be made a valuable 
part of training. But it can only partly serve to bring the 
schools into accord with the larger interests of the world 
without. It is neither radical nor extensive enough for the 
task before us. The supplementary matter realized by 
this procedure is short of vocational demands. Further, 
it only partially serves to eliminate the effete and empty 
matter now intrinsic to both the curricula and individual 
subjects of the schools. 
The valid method of socialization is revealed in the 
answers to these three questions: What shall education 
dominantly accomplish? What programme of studies and 
training shall be established to accomplish it? How shall 
we dispose of our present training matter to permit the 
construction of a programme that will accomplish it? The 
answers are, vocational training of the individual; reor- 
ganization of present programmes so as to vocationalize the 
individual in terms of the dominant or some one of the 
dominant interests of his community; elimination of such
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
subjects and parts of subjects now in our schools as do not 
lead pretty directly to the desired end. 
The need of reconstruction depends on criterion. — 
Whether or not there is a necessity for transforming the 
subjects taught in the schools, of course depends on our 
idea of the criterion to be used in education. If we hold 
to the culture idea of education, that all knowledge is useful, 
since all facts are found in the universe and it is the business 
of the individual to know as much as possible about the 
cosmology, then perhaps we shall not find much to criticise 
in what is now taught. Still, even those of this view would 
discriminate between what is first most accessible and most 
important and what is more remote and less consequential, 
and would use this distinction as a criterion of what to put 
into texts. Only fools would advocate dumping the whole 
world of knowledge upon a schoolroom of children. Hence 
some criterion would be in demand. 
If we were exponents of the discipline theory of education, 
that general discipline is the end of training, that some 
subjects are more qualified to furnish this discipline than 
others and that the training of the powers of the child is the 
chief thing to be accomplished, not much fault could be 
found with what is now taught, save, perhaps, that there is 
too much that is useful creeping into the schools. Still, 
this class of people have a criterion of fit subject matter; 
for, as they first discover certain total subjects which are 
better than other subjects for disciplining purposes, so when 
the chosen subjects are taken up, since every subject ramifies 
almost infinitely into knowledge around, some way must be 
found to select the essentials. To find the essentials a 
criterion of value is required.
-P-A-G-E-225
  CRITERION OF SOCIALIZATION 217 
And the same ultimate requirement faces us, no matter 
what may be our educational view. 
Where these schools of educational theory would differ 
from the social-adjustment theory is not in affirming that 
no criterion is needed, as against its rigid insistence on 
applying the test of values, but in holding that, after making 
due allowance in choice of matter out of respect to finite 
limits of human understanding, it isa matter of indifference, 
within that prescribed field, whether tweedledee or tweedle- 
dum be emphasized; it is all good. We then teach knowl- 
edge for the sake of knowledge, science for the sake of science, 
disciplinary matter for the sake of discipline, etc. Then 
usefulness and social value cannot avail because they are 
not the end. 
On the contrary, in social philosophy as applied to educa- 
tion, the end of life is social competency and the end of 
education is preparation for that qualification. Since the 
individual is to. depend on society, is to use its machinery and 
its values, he must be educated in terms of those organiza- 
tions of the total machine he is most likely to serve in 
vocationally; and must be given the instinct of their values 
if possible. Hence for every particular community pro- 
gramme of training, for every particular training subject, 
there must exist a social criterion of value. Moreover, the 
criterion must be as rigidly applied as the military authority 
applies his scissors or pencil in censoring the news in war 
times. 
Location of the criterion. —Hence, in reorganizing the 
educational programme some criterion must be found which 
will be a test of the fitness for entrance of elements of train- 
ing. This takes us into the realm of values. This attempt
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
is built on the doctrine of social values. It runs somewhat 
as follows. Educate the individual to be able to adjust 
himself in the social situation he is most likely to meet as a 
life situation. In the various ranges of content to which 
he is to be subject select just that content which will 
throw most light on, and which leads towards, that particular 
environment. In so far asa vocational element is introduced 
choose the line of training which the individual will be most 
likely to follow. Some of the details of this choice will be 
developed later. 
Here we have to find the clew to what the situation is 
likely to be in which the individual will dominantly function. 
This clew is found in the idea of the community and of the 
community interest or business. First, it is probable that 
the mass of persons will live in the community in which 
they will grow up. Second, if they do migrate it is cer- 
tain that vastly the greater majority will seek and locate in 
the kind of community they left. Thus working men will 
migrate to manufacturing, agriculturists to agricultural, 
commercial people to commercial districts, etc. 
In this way the community becomes the key to the 
vocational element which should be placed in any given 
school, and to the determination of what informational 
areas or phases of the various subjects shall be taught. 
To demonstrate that this conception of the relation of 
the individual to the community is not mere assumption the 
following facts are presented. 
First, the population of the United States, as measured 
by interstate migration, is quite stable. ‘‘ The total native 
born population in 1900 was 65,767,451 (including Alaska 
and Hawaii, but excluding 75,851 native born enumerated
-P-A-G-E-227
CRITERION OF SOCIALIZATION 219 
in military and naval stations abroad). Of this number 
51,979,651, or 79 per cent, were born in the state or territory 
in which they were found by the census enumerators. The 
remaining 13,787,800, constituting 21 per cent of the entire 
native born element, had migrated from the state or territory 
in which they were born and were found in the other states 
and territories. The proportion living in the state or 
territory of birth was slightly larger in 1900 than it was in 
1890.” (U.S. Statistical Atlas, 1900, p. 43.) We must 
expect it will be very much larger in future, due to the 
exhaustion of new land in the West. With reference to the 
kind of communities the migrants settle in, that is, the 21 per 
cent, anyone familiar with the history of settling the West 
and who has lived in various parts of the West knows that 
easterners move West and that they are mostly from rural 
regions. That is, farmers take up the new farming lands 
of the West more largely than any other class. This 
principle holds for other classes and other sections of the 
nation as well. 
Second, the growth of cities touches the stability of the 
population relatively lightly and is largely accounted for 
by immigration. The growth of urban relative to rural 
population was only about 12 per cent in a generation, or 
from 20.9 per cent to 33.1 per cent between 1870 and 1900. 
(Same, p. 40.) The largest increase is in commercial and 
industrial regions. Massachusetts has increased its urban 
population from 56 to 76 per cent; Illinois from 32 to 47 
per cent; Kansas from 12 to 28 per cent from 1870 to 1900. 
Southern and newer western states and territories have 
increased their city inhabitants, relative to rural, little in 
that time. (Same, plate 20.)
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
Immigrants from abroad throng the cities and largely 
make their excess growth. There are living in cities of 
25,000 inhabitants and over, about 75 per cent of Russians; 
63 per cent each of Poles, Italians, and Irish; nearly 60 per 
cent each of Bohemians, Austrians, and Hungarians. These, 
except the Irish, are the foreign races which now most 
come to America. (Same, plate 73.) A large part of those 
and other races settle in smaller industrial communities. 
Germans and Scandinavians mostly congregate in the 
northwesterly states as agriculturists and will likely remain 
such. (Same, plates 65 and 69.) 
On the basis of these facts it is safe to state that probably 
somewhere near 8o per cent of our citizens will remain in 
the original community, and that those who migrate will 
go to a social group with interests similar to the old. The 
environment will be essentially unchanged. It would be 
safe to say that very much less than five per cent of the 
population change their callings. 
It is taken as a valid argument in education to-day that, 
since over go per cent of our youth will not remain in school 
beyond the elementary grades, our education in those 
grades should be made more vocational in nature. It would 
seem to be an equally valid argument to hold that, since we 
can locate the future vocational interest of even a larger 
portion of the youth, the dominant interests of any com- 
munity should serve as the guide in the kind of training the 
children of that community should have. This interest or 
the interests will determine the vocational element to place 
in the center of the training programme; the phases of the 
informational studies which are most needed for illuminants 
and supports of the vocational; and, in connection with the 
   
-P-A-G-E-229
  
CRITERION OF SOCIALIZATION 221 
ethical demands arising out of every community, will form 
the cue to the kind of work to be done. 
It may be said that this criterion of the community or 
locality is now becoming accepted and used. We have pre- 
viously seen an illustration of this principle in the case of 
England creating new universities to meet regional needs. 
And the following case may be taken as a frank acceptance 
of its validity in the public schools of the United States. 
“IT may probably best indicate by illustration what I 
deem to be wise operation of the law that the special charac- 
ter of the business life of a city should affect the forms of 
industrial education in its schools. My own city (Hartford) 
is known throughout the business world as a banking, 
insurance, and manufacturing center. We employ thou- 
sands of clerks, accountants, copyists, bookkeepers, typists, 
and stenographers in these offices of our banks, insurance 
companies, and manufactures. The factories are devoted 
largely to the production of high-grade metal manufactures. 
Our guns and automobiles, our tires and bicycles, our 
typewriters and automatic machinery, go into every quarter 
of the world where efficiency is prized. In their produc- 
tion we employ thousands of machinists, pattern makers, 
draftsmen, smiths, and other high-grade mechanics. The 
ranks of all these must be recruited from the boys trained 
in our public schools. 
“We recognize, accordingly, that penmanship has in our 
schools a place which it is not generally accorded or entitled 
to in many other cities. We deliberately teach it as an 
important manual art all through the nine grades of the 
grammar schools, and in the high school as well. Similarly, 
work in wood and iron is begun as low as the fifth grade of
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
the grammar schools and carried through the high school. 
Drawing and design begin in the kindergarten, and are 
available through every year to the end of the high school 
course. Typewriting, stenography, and bookkeeping are 
taught in our high school. Our work in pattern making, 
mechanical drawing, and machine-shop practice is more 
extended than might be justified in a city of different com~ 
mercial life. Our evening high school has not hesitated to ° 
undertake the training in its shops and drafting rooms of 
ambitious young men from the factories. Without con- 
scious formulation of the doctrine that the schools of the 
community should teach whatever the business of the com- 
munity demands in a large way, we have accepted it in 
practice.” (Supt. C. H. Keyes, N. E. A. Rept., 1906, 
Pp. 204-5.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
CHAPTER XI. SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME 
OF STUDIES 
Problem and aim of treatment. —JIn considering the 
methods of socialization it is not easy to see just where to 
begin. If the various subjects now taught are to be over- 
hauled, they may become larger or smaller, according as 
contraction by eliminating material or expansion by incor- 
porating new matter exceeds. As to their extent after recon- 
struction has taken place we are in the dark. Looking at 
the matter in this way it would seem that the various sub- 
jects demand attention first. But since no one man is likely 
to be intimately enough acquainted in a teaching way with 
all the various fields of work, the results of changing the 
subjects cannot be definitely known for a long time. Many 
collaborators will be required to complete the task. Thus 
a complete programme of school work must await the 
accomplishment of this task. 
Looking at the problem in another way it appears that 
the curriculum should be worked over first. How can we 
determine the form of any part until the whole structure 
isknown? Perhaps the very part will be eliminated entirely 
or else given a quite subordinate place, as compared with 
that it previously occupied. It would be of no use, for 
instance, to work over formal grammar if that subject, as 
such, is to be dispensed with; or if it is to be reduced in 
prominence, this should be known by those who under- 
take to recast it. 
223
-P-A-G-E-232
224 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
The whole task of socialization really promises to be, as it 
now is, a matter of cut and fit, of experimenting and of 
selecting the fruitful results. However, something may be 
gained by attacking the task in a preliminary way, thus 
offering the suggestions to be improved on. For the 
reason above given the programme will receive considera- 
tion first. 
The aim, then, of this chapter is to consider the curricu- 
lum, as a whole, for the sake of discovering of what it should 
consist. As the criticism of each subject and line of work 
decides what teaching matter they shall contain, so, the 
criticism of a total programme determines what lines of 
training shall confront the pupils. 
Subordinate ends of education and training groups. — 
While there is no general course of training possible, there 
are general principles, or minor ends of education, which 
should govern the training of every individual. Thus we 
may demand that the individual shall have command of 
the devices of communication and computation; and, as we 
saw in Part II, that he shall be fitted to carry a good 
degree of intelligence into his particular niche in life; that 
he shall be habituated to fulfill his social duties; that he shall 
be a useful, productive citizen; and, we may add, that he 
shall have developed a taste for some of the finer goods of 
life. 
If we were to think of the process the individual goes 
through in securing the last four qualities or acquisitions, 
we might term the process in each successive case informa- . 
tion, moralization, utilization, and appreciation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 225 
I. THE TOOLS OF LEARNING 
Their importance. — The first group of elements the 
school must contain is made up of the so-called “ tools of 
learning.” Inameasure the phrase, “tools of learning,” is 
good. It covers a part of the work of these lines of study 
as they relate to mere school routine. It expresses the 
truth that without reading, writing, and numbers advance 
in school knowledge would be severely crippled. And 
without the acquisition of these technical means, outside 
knowledge and continued culture, as it is to be obtained in 
printed matter, would be impossible. 
There are three social services the possession of reading, 
writing, and mathematics performs for the individual. 
First, they make it possible for him to come into larger and 
larger fields of information. As has been said, this service 
is performed in the school. The texts and the library are 
opened to the child by ability to read. Beyond the school, 
with the possession of ambition and leisure, all the mines of 
the world’s experience may be explored. 
Second, they facilitate and enlarge the power of communi- 
cation. Since life is so largely a matter of social dependence 
and intercourse, communication is of primary importance. 
It is desirable that a person should be able to give and take 
ideas with ease and pleasure. Reading will render conver- 
sation easier in giving ideas and language power. Writing 
enlarges the area of communication for purposes of friend- 
ship and business. Not to be able to write would reduce 
the individual to a position of dependence on others for the 
performance of these functions. 
Third, arithmetic, or numbers, bestows the power of 
computation. Civilization moves on the wings of numbers 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
226 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
more than we are apt to think. The average person 
reckons many times daily. The man of business is abso- 
lutely dependent on the business of counting. Even the 
society butterfly must figure up the prices of dainty fabrics, 
beautiful floral purchases, cab-fares, etc., and measure 
them in terms of her purse. The one who could not reckon 
would be at the mercy of dishonest people and would have 
to depend on honest and dishonest fellow men alike to do 
his counting for him. Of course, life and all vocations 
involving business considerations would be closed to him. 
We must therefore conclude that the agents of informa- 
tion, communication, and computation are essentials of 
individual equipment to-day and must be included in the 
school schedule. 
Method of teaching the three R’s. — A further considera- 
tion, hardly legitimate in this work, would relate to the 
method to be used in teaching them. It has long been the 
custom to consider the three R’s as the chief things to be 
given in the lower reaches of education. It iscommon to see 
the training process start with them. We even find a very 
large part of the first six or seven grades taken up with the 
acquisition of reading, writing, arithmetic, and grammar. 
Apparently this is wrong and no doubt the order will be 
reversed in a measure in the future. 
The fundamental task and viewpoint of the school is to 
give familiarity and skill in their use in the briefest time, 
and to teach them as means to greater ends rather than as 
ends in themselves. Moreover, while they are being gained 
by the pupils so as to be in some degree usable, other lines 
of training should proceed. These agents will be more 
quickly obtained by relating them to useful school duties 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
    
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 227 
and to life activities. When the children perceive that 
numbers are the measure of real things, that reading is the 
way to get information about products or instruments or 
customs of the people the teacher is making them acquainted 
with in social studies, and that writing will carry their ideas 
to parents and friends, the concrete and lively relation will 
bring added interest and secure speedier apprehension. 
Here is an example of the advantage of this method. 
In a report on the University Elementary School the 
University Record (January, 1898) says: “Statistics show 
that, in our existing school system, from 60 to 80 per cent 
of the time of the first two or three years of school life is spent 
upon mastery of the technical forms of knowledge, learn- 
ing to make and recognize written and printed forms and 
manipulate number symbols.” In that school they are 
taught as above indicated. The report continues, “So far 
as experience goes, it demonstrates that the relative loss 
in the amount gone over in the first two or three years is 
much more than made up for in ability to use intelligently 
what is got, to say nothing of the inestimable advantage of 
substitution of intrinsically valuable facts and ideas for the 
trivialities of ordinary reading and writing lessons, etc.” 
Il. INFORMATION 
Importance of the knowledge groups. —The second 
group of elements indicated is included in that line of school 
activities which has for its distinct and conscious purpose 
the acquisition of information. Evolution means a growth 
in organic complexity. Advance in civilization means 
social evolution. The civilized child is born into the 
midst of an intricate, complex system of physical and socia:
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
environments. It would not be safe to affirm that the man 
who knows most is the one who best succeeds in life, 
because he might be totally ignorant of the principles and 
means of social control and social realization. To do is 
equally important with to know. But it is certainly true 
that the average man must know a great many things so 
that he may be able to do and to perform. In the rational 
realm accurate knowledge goes before fruitful action and 
is its sure base. 
We have previously seen that there are two ranges of 
knowledge which open up to every individual as being of 
great consequence to him. We shall add a third to the two 
given in Part II and briefly summarize the reasons for 
their selection. These three directions of thought are the 
individual himself as individual, the social environment as 
it concerns him, and the physical environment as it is related 
to him. We have to pronounce these ranges of knowledge 
fundamentally necessary, because without considerable in- 
formation of each success would be crippled. We are to 
look for those elements in each range on which individual 
and social welfare most vitally rest. This will be a means of 
determining value of facts for purposes of selection and of 
steering us clear of attempting to exhaust the full scientific 
and philosophical reaches in setting up studies. 
Relative worth of the knowledge areas. —It would be a 
fit field for discussion as to which of these fields should bear 
the greater emphasis. We have already considered the 
relative importance of physical and social conditions for 
individuals in civilized society. (Chap. V, pp. 83-88.) 
We saw that the average man is immediately dependent on 
the social organization and mediately upon physical nature
-P-A-G-E-237
  
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 229 
to supply his wants. As the sociologists would put it, 
the physical conditions the social; in a measure determines 
the direction and height of itsattainment. We draw on the 
ultimate supplies of material things deposited in nature and 
obtain them through social channels in order that our 
individual wants may be satisfied. We are affected by 
climate, altitude, and other physical conditions, and temper 
the direct blasts of nature’s forces by inventions which 
are the product of social experience. 
So each term is seen to be important and necessary. 
First, there is the individual with his wants to be satisfied. 
These wants are social products. They have their birth in 
human associations which become possessed of the utilities 
which any given grade of society bears. The wants of 
the individual, in range and number, are expressed by the 
standard of living of his society. The savage has few, the 
barbarian more, and the civilized many, as many as his 
standard of living implies. 
Second, these wants are supplied by a society organized 
into structures, or organizations, to provide things and 
services. To cut the average individual off from connection 
with these agencies would be to starve him, so few there 
are who produce their own supplies directly from nature. 
Third, only the raw material for the satisfaction of all 
wants, save those supplied by services, is found in physical 
nature. Only a few people, relatively, wrest these crass 
things from her bosom. We have said that to-day three 
scientific farmers could raise food sufficient to feed one 
thousand people. There are only about a half million 
miners and quarrymen in this country who mine for this 
nation and a large part of the world besides. Most of the
-P-A-G-E-238
  
230 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
workers, outside of agriculture, are engaged in working up 
raw material into various consumptive forms, in transporting 
it to and fro, in clerical and professional work, or in personal 
service. 
From this brief survey of the field we might conclude as 
follows. First, none of these ranges of information can be 
left out or neglected. For purposes of society all are mutu- 
ally involved. Second, since each person directly depends 
on social organizations and agencies to get his wants sup- 
plied, social studies should find a larger place in the curricu- 
lum than they now have, and deserve to have a place along 
with the nature studies. Third, since each field is so vast 
in its details, careful attention should be given to selecting 
the most pertinent so that time shall not be wasted on the 
relatively useless. 
Criterion for selection of information matter. — Because 
each area is so complex, information relative to the individ- 
ual as such, for instance, breaking up into numerous lines 
or sciences, a correct standard of value must be commanded 
by which to test matter for admission to school. In Part IT 
some discussion was given of the relative value of knowledge 
areas and the decision obtained that our public schools, at 
least, which are to serve the majority, should offer the 
training which seeks to fit the young to meet particular 
social situations. Articulation in society is the demand. 
Knowledge or training which most directly leads to that is 
the best. Therefore out of the abundance of information 
in existence, in each of the three information areas, only 
just that should be chosen which looks to social adaptations. 
Knowledge of self. — The knowledge of the self should 
be a practical knowledge of the physical self, in order to
-P-A-G-E-239
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 231 
know how to use and care for the body which is the agent of 
realization. This has been so repeatedly set forth in edu- 
cational treatises that little remains to be added in the 
way of information. Health, strength, and self-control are 
the indispensable conditions of happiness, attainment, and 
serviceability. If a knowledge and control of the machine 
he uses in his work are necessary to the artisan in order to 
make him efficient and his employment permanent, how 
much more imperative is it that every one should understand 
the nature, the strength, and the laws of the physical mechan- 
ism whose defect or failure means suffering, inefficiency, 
dependence, or death. 
If we were to approach the task of selecting the informa- 
tion about self from the side of teaching, we could say that 
, good teaching would consist in presenting just the knowledge 
needed in the most direct way. The knowledge to be given 
in each case would be selected in view of the social needs of 
the individual. Thus to teach how to care for the body is 
most important, because a healthy condition is the prime 
necessity for work in the world. Intricacies of physiology 
and memorizing the names of hundreds of bones, muscles, 
and nerves should be subordinated to explaining the depend- 
ence of health on ventilation, sanitation, bathing, food, 
etc. Rules and maxims of health might well be taught first, 
to be followed by scientific explanations only so far as will 
serve to give rational comprehension. (See pp. 286-288.) 
Knowledge of nature. — The knowledge of the physical 
conditions of life should be that which the individual is 
most apt to need rather than incidental facts of science. 
Whether nature study relates to physical facts or to biologi- 
cal forms, the phenomena should be selected with reference
-P-A-G-E-240
232 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
to the thought of service to man. Man’s use and needs of 
the object studied will determine what facts and points 
should receive attention. 
' Thus in studying animals it is not the aim to make 
technical scientists of children. The purpose should be to 
teach them the place and use of the animal in question; 
something of its nature and traits, so as to know how it is 
to be trained and cared for, or if it is to be exterminated. 
If the cat were the object, it would be a perversion to dissect 
the cat, or to study its structure relative to other forms of 
ljfe, in the main. Those methods might be employed and 
the facts they bring be needed in higher scientific reaches; 
but what the average person needs to know is the use the 
cat serves, how it is to be reared and trained so as to make 
it best fill its place; its food and care in order to make it, 
the best possible cat for its purpose. And so on for the 
whole range of animals, birds, insects, and plants studied. 
But the useful before all else. If the pupils stay in school 
long enough they can get the scientific frills, if there are any. 
Naturally, the community interests and pursuits will 
dominate the selection of the objects and conditions to be 
studied. In the rural regions, the agricultural uses of the 
physical conditions, plants, and animals will point out which 
of their phases shall receive consideration; and show the 
point of connection in the social situation. A study of the 
soil of the region in its bearing on crop culture would be 
more important than a study of the reasons for the change 
of seasons. An understanding of animal culture should 
have precedence over casual information about animals of 
the jungle. 
For those who are to go into industrial life, a line of study
-P-A-G-E-241
  
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 233 
involving the physical or the chemical qualities of matter 
should be given. Laws of matter and of chemical elements, 
in general, are not thought of because too much that is 
irrelevant and remotely valuable would creep in. The 
point of the matter is to select just those realms which will 
be most used and depended on in their future vocation. 
The skilled teacher would be the one to make the adjust- 
ment of the subject on the basis of the criterion of future 
usefulness, and so would pick out the most useful parts for 
grade work. As the grade of work progressed, the area of 
material to be chosen would naturally expand until it would 
attain to the rank of physics and chemistry in secondary 
work, should the individual stay in school so long. 
Knowledge of society. — Since the individual, as we have 
seen, must get his standing and success in society by making 
use of the agencies and institutions which social evolution 
has ordained, and without the use of which no one can 
live the civilized life, it would seem quite as essential that he 
should understand the social machine he works with as that 
he should understand the framework and laws of nature. 
But as the average individual, leaving school as early as he 
does, cannot master anything like a full science of physical 
nature, but must be brought to understand the objects he is 
most likely to meet in the light of their human use, so the 
science of society is too large and complex to be undertaken 
in its fullness, and only those concrete portions can be 
appropriated which lie nearest the life of the average man. 
Certainly the local social institutions and organizations, 
studied in the light of their use and purpose, would be the 
place to begin. In the case of every one studied, it should 
be made clear that men use them and how men use them to
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
get work done or useful service performed. If this point 
is always directly attacked details and mazes of mere facts 
will not overwhelm. It isno more necessary to study all the 
facts and institutions of society, in order to understand 
social interdependence of individuals through institutions 
and organizations, than it is to know all the facts and laws 
of nature inorder to perceive the reign of law in the universe. 
As understanding one human being takes us a long way 
towards the comprehension of all men, so, to see the use and 
bearing of a few local agencies of society will go far towards 
establishing an intelligent apprehension of other and 
larger structures. Or, as Dr. Charles McMurry would 
have it done, the local community can be made the type of 
such communities the world over, and so the pupil will 
come to an understanding of the world in that aspect.* 
The social group information should be connected with 
the thought of vocation. Those lines of facts which bear 
on and involve the dominant interests of the community 
or the class of interests represented by the special school 
should be mastered. One set of facts deals with the eco- 
nomic content and relations of the vocation to be followed. 
If one is to go into business for himself, he wants to know 
the economic forces and laws which pertain particularly to 
his field. If one is to be a mechanic, the economic signifi- 
cance of his work and products should be the central theme. 
Only the facts which have the largest bearing on his chosen 
life work would be given. :

Studies,” Report of the Committee of Seven, N. Dakota Educational Associa-

SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 235 
With the higher reaches of education, the lines of social 
study begun below would be further developed and such 
other lines added as the case would warrant. Here, as 
before, the proper facts would be those which most closely 
bear on the context of the individual’s future; but, as would 
be expected, would expand and differentiate in content 
appropriately with the increased intellectual powers of the 
pupils. 
Til. MORALIZATION 
Tn considering the demands which the thought of democ- 
racy makes on education, attention was given to the sub- 
ject of moralizing the pupils in the schools. Both the 
nature and the necessity of moralization were there set forth. 
We have here to treat the methods which should be used in 
the work of rendering the young ethical. We will proceed 
to the consideration of the two most important methods, 
didactic and practical moralization. 
Didactic moralization. — This is the teaching effort which 
concerns itself with a more or less direct attempt to build 
ethical persons. One phase of this is to impress ethical 
qualities by precept. This will likely be most resorted to 
with the younger pupils, in the way of impressing the bene- 
fits or evils which come to individual actors as a consequence 
of their conduct. 
With pupils old enough to have developed the power of 
taking in the relation of individuals to larger situations, a 
less direct method is available and probably advisable. 
As has been said, democracy in all ranges of social activity, 
that is, equality of rights and opportunity among all men, is 
the great end towards which social evolution moves. The 
greatest dramas of history, many of the masterpieces of 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
literature, and the mighty movements of the present reflect 
the tendency to realize the larger rights of men. 
Such being the ethical goal of social evolution, and such 
being the nature of much of the subject matter which is 
available for teaching purposes, it would follow logically 
that, first, it is the duty of the teacher to inspire the pupil 
with a love for human rights in every valid way, and, second, 
that at least a part of the information material should be 
selected and presented with this end specifically in view. 
From my own experience as a student and asa teacher, Iam 
persuaded that moral enthusiasm and love of humanity 
can better be secured by presenting informational matter 
in the proper way than by formal ethical teaching; and that 
an individual in whom the love for humanity has once 
been established in this way will be most sensitive to social 
welfare. Its superiority comes in that it develops ethical 
attitudes in relation to situations. It makes citizens who 
are ethical dynamically. It breeds a moral enthusiasm of 
an independent rational order, creates persons who are able 
to take reasoned attitudes with reference to new conditions. 
This kind of citizen is necessary to secure social progress. 
Character which merely conserves does not guarantee a 
changing order. 
Practical moralization. — But bewind the formally didac- 
tic and the sermonic element in training, perhaps the most 
forceful means for moralization will be found in the actual 
social organization of the pupils in school; directed toward 
arousing a spirit of “fair play,” a hearty appreciation of 
the value of their fellows for codperative purposes, and some 
practical skill in forming and using group action. 
Particularly in the earlier years of school life, the possibili-
-P-A-G-E-245
  SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 237 
ties in these lines are exceedingly great and only the more 
advanced teachers and schools are adequately testing them. 
Life then is most plastic and formative, and hence the work 
is more effective and basic. Again, children are more 
susceptible to control and suggestion. Later, if not previ- 
ously moralized, the wayward and refractory might require 
force. Further, there isa time advantage, in that elements 
of control laid early will have all the longer term in school 
for further strengthening. 
If enlightened self-government is the ideal and end of 
a democracy, certainly it is preposterous and contradictory 
for the fundamental agencies in the direct preparation for 
citizenship to withhold from the individuals in tutelage all 
instruction, training, and participation in the processes of 
organizing themselves, and of feeling the responsibility for 
the functions of citizenship. 
To make the pupils conscious of group life, to be loyal 
to and considerate of the collectivity, to see and appreciate 
the dependence on and codéperative helpfulness of social 
fellows, to grasp the value and sanctity of personality and of 
its rights in its social settings, to give self-control under 
authority and self-restraint and devotion under responsibil- 
ity, is to moralize the individual. And of course the full 
agencies of group life in school, the school as a group, the 
class as a group, are to be used as concrete and immediate 
instruments of social disciplining. 
The very best way to prepare children to become morally 
responsible is to create the machinery in, or in connection 
with school, which will cultivate moral attitudes and 
judgment ideals. The agencies which will secure ‘“ emo- 
tional attitudes,” as Professor Bagley suggests, are the
-P-A-G-E-246
238 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
most useful and effective. Such an adjunct as the school 
garden, which gives each pupil the sense of property right 
and property relations to others, is an admirable means of 
securing this, as Baldwin at Hyannis has demonstrated. 
By means of the garden plots, care of tools, etc., he was 
enabled to develop an alert and working sense of community 
responsibility which oceans of talk could not have done. 
Actual life situations were obtained which called out life 
attitudes of adjustment. The interest in the situation was 
real. Efforts to correct abuses of privileges were genuine, 
and organic, therefore, because the situations were real 
ones, and the interests were natural and not assumed under 
external pressure of authority. Precisely the sense and kind 
of ethical judgment were provoked which are needed on the 
part of grown people in society. The advantage was in 
favor of the children because they had the leadership 
of a wise instructor who could help them to come to just and 
fair decisions. 
Another means of securing actual moral training is to 
be found in self-government undertakings in the school. 
Recognition is obtaining, that it is desirable to have students 
participate in the conduct of the school, in so far as student 
control goes. In an introductory note to ‘“ Student Partici- 
pation in School Government”? (issued by W. R. Ward at 
New Palz, N. Y.), President Charles W. Eliot, of Harvard, 
mentions three fundamental objects of education. First, 
as to development of character, ‘‘to cultivate in the child a 
capacity for self-government, not a habit of submission to 
an overwhelming, arbitrary, external power, but a habit of 
obeying dictates of honor and duty as enforced by active 
will-power within the child.” ‘“ The second is that in child- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 239 
hood and youth it is of the utmost importance to appeal 
steadily, and almost exclusively, to motives which will be 
operative in after life.’ The third ‘is Froebel’s doctrine 
that children are best developed through productive activi- 
ties, that is, through positive, visible achievement in doing, 
making or producing something.” 
The first and second objects are admirably secured by the 
School City and other self-government devices. 
If actual self-government interests and motives can be 
called out and trained, when the student gets out of school, 
he is experienced for actual and practical civic matters. 
He has the practical experience, the habitual emotional 
attitude so necessary to character, as well as the ideals of 
what is just and right in government. 
(See Bagley’s article, ‘The School’s Responsibility for 
Developing the Controls of Conduct,” Elementary School 
Teacher, March, 1908; Ray’s Democratic Government of 
Schools; Ward’s Student Participation in School Govern- 
ment; articles on Vacation Schools, etc.) 
IV. UTILIZATION 
Need of utilization. — This term covers the educative 
processes which have as their specific aim the enabling of 
the individual to make use of his knowledge, skill, and 
powers, so as to bring them to bear on actual situations of 
life in the most immediate and effective way. The motive 
of the public school system should be so to train the indi- 
vidual that all elements held within the personality shall 
be organized and coéperative, that in the time and place of 
action all the powers shall spring to work at once to accom- 
plish the given undertaking.
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
More specifically, utilization enables the person to become 
productive. Whatever else education should accomplish, 
it should not leave unaccomplished the training of the 
coming citizens for complete self-support. Outside of poor 
distribution of population and industrial crises, as causes of 
poverty and criminality, lack of technical training, of skill 
in vocation, is by far the largest contributing cause. 
As a causal agency this lack of vocational training works 
in two ways. First, under work conditions the individual 
cannot keep employment for long, and may not secure it 
even, because of lack of special skill; and in times of emer- 
gency he is the first to go and the last to find a place again. 
Second, the growth of the child, under conditions which 
do not furnish vocational training, has a negative influence 
on the development in other lines. That is, action is inher- 
ent to childhood. Work is more natural than its omission. 
Play is a device, in part, to take its place. The happiest 
and the best developed child is the one given a due portion 
of tasks in early life to work out. Particularly in urban 
communities this element is lacking. Mere manual training 
would be justified, as an educational device, to give the child 
control of himself in mind and will through body discipline. 
This could well be made a factor of moralization. 
Some of the important elements in this process of utili- 
zation are organizing principles, vocational technique, and 
initiative. 
Vocational technique. — The technique is the vertebral 
column of the vocation. It is possible to have a great deal 
of knowledge about a vocation without being able to com- 
mand the vocation. One may know how a blacksmith 
shoes a horse, welds two pieces of iron or sets a tire, so well,
-P-A-G-E-249
  
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 241 
indeed, that he could make the processes quite intelligible 
to another in an explanatory way and yet be unable to do 
any of these things. The skill, the exact ways of doing 
things, or of carrying on a series of processes, the methods 
of procedure as distinguishing peculiarities of lines of work 
constitute the technique. It is inconceivable that anyone 
should make a success of his chosen pursuit without master- 
ing these detailed methods of procedure. The greater the 
mastery, the informational factor being granted, the greater 
the success. 
The regulative ideal as to what should be introduced in 
any given place may be represented in the thought of local 
autonomy, that the economic interests of a locality or group 
shall decide what phase or phases of training for vocation 
shall be emphasized in the school. Agricultural regions 
would logically emphasize agriculture, with attention to ele- 
mentary and practical mechanics, and to domestic science, 
to fit for farm life. The consolidated schools are the 
only schools in rural regions which could properly develop 
this ideal. 
Communities which maintain schools, with possibilities of 
differentiation in education, could carry or emphasize the 
lines of technique leading into various industrial interests, 
and in the academic work group the subjects so as to con- 
centrate toward commercial or professional interests. Thus, 
those who expect to pursue industrial life will lay stress on 
industrial training in their given line; and will take such 
academic studies as throw most light on and support the 
industrial matters. Those who have commercial or pro- 
fessional aims will choose their group of academic studies 
leading in the chosen direction, and lay stress on those
-P-A-G-E-250
    
242 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
educative lines. Such persons would probably take some 
industrial work for physical health and motor control. 
Organizing principles. —In whatever line an individual 
trains himself there should be given, to lie behind the mere 
technical details, as large a fund of guiding principles per- 
taining to the trade, the vocation, or profession, as the 
stage of mental development will entertain. In other words, 
the rationale of the line of achievement to be prepared for 
should be given. 
In the higher commercial courses of universities the 
programme of studies is so arranged that along with those 
subjects which give the detailed and technical training 
goes a group of more general sociological subjects, let us 
say, which afford the more general principles and guiding 
lines for managerial direction and responsibility. Some- 
thing of this same arrangement needs to be extended down- 
ward. The one looking to a commercial career needs more 
than the so-called business training. A good knowledge 
of economics, government, industrial history, and other 
cognate subjects will give a social perspective and grasp of 
principles of collective life which are necessary to give 
outlook and save from mere clerical narrowness. 
The same attempt should be made with reference to the 
industrial training. A disadvantage of making every one a 
skilled artisan, merely, perhaps would be the narrowing 
results, that is, lack of ability to adjust to changed industrial 
conditions, such as are brought in by the introduction of new 
machinery which might eliminate the old line of work. 
Such a narrow training would be better than none at all, 
as is now true in most cases of training in public schools. 
But it is more important, where possible, to develop the
-P-A-G-E-251
  
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 243 
reasonable groundwork of the trade or technological line 
with less of the mere skill in one line, than the reverse. 
This point is disputed. President M. P. Higgins of the 
Norton Emery Wheel Company, Worcester, Massachusetts, 
criticises all lines of trade and technical schools, from lowest 
to highest, because they have failed to produce really skilled 
workmen. “Any education for the trades, in order to meet 
the reasonable needs and demands of the manufacturer 
(Proceedings of the N. E. A., 1903, p. 597 ef seq.), must 
make skill the central part of the enterprise. The educa- 
tional system must start from the shop, and all other 
elements of the school must radiate from the shop, because 
the power and success of the pupil’s life are to depend upon 
his shop knowledge and dexterity.” He says, however, 
that manufacturers have come to understand “that we 
cannot have the skill of the order and grade we demand 
unless science and general discipline are the basis of the 
skill and the accompaniment of the skill,” p. 603. Principal 
A. H. Chamberlain of the Throop Polytechnic Institute of 
Pasadena, California, holds that what we need to do is to 
educationalize the trade school by “injecting into it the 
thought element to a greater extent.” Qualities of initia- 
tive, guidance, and leadership are demanded of trade school 
graduates. 
Some such thought as this is embodied in the work of such 
institutions as Clemsen College, South Carolina, an industrial 
school, North Carolina College of Agriculture, and others. 
The president of the Board of Trustees of the former, in an 
address, said that it had for its object to “educate their 
minds, broaden their intellects and teach them all the 
fundamental principles together with the practice in all the
-P-A-G-E-252
  244 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
different departments of work. When they get through they 
have such an experience and knowledge of these matters 
that any man with the knowledge that we furnish him can 
make a man of himself in any department of life.’ Mr. 
Beaty, director of the textile department, states that the 
main purpose of their combination of academic and indus- 
trial training is to make the student able to reason for 
himself, to make it possible for him to “do his own reason- 
ing and thinking as well as to handle tools and instruments if 
necessary.” (Amer, Jour. Sociology, Vol. 10, pp. 396-7.) 
Wherever time limit prevents the higher educational de- 
velopment necessary for the acquisition of these principles, 
as the short period of schooling now unfortunately imposes, 
the trade, vocational, and mechanical side is the one which 
should be emphasized, so as to make sure of a basis of self- 
support. Thus Prof. Thomas Balliet advocates forming 
trade schools for boys of fourteen years of age and over 
who cannot go to High School. 
This training should begin at the end of the sixth or 
seventh year and continue for some four years with aca- 
demic work, so Dr. Balliet advocates. ‘‘ Statistics show that 
a large majority of men engaged in the wood-working and 
iron-working trades have never attended high school. Quite 
a fair percentage of them have never completed a grammar 
school course.” (Proceedings N. E. A., 1903, p. 598.) 
Initiative. — Much that has been said under the last point 
is also necessary in training to give the power of initiative 
and execution. It would be gratuitous to enlarge on the 
need of training to secure this, or at least of so educating as 
not to stifle that degree of initiative with which.the individ- 
ual is born. Two things are certainly necessary to arouse
-P-A-G-E-253
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 245 
and encourage initiative. One is giving the individual 
some glimpse of the variety of vocations existing in the 
world to-day, emphasizing the possibility and desirability 
of attainment. The other is developing the motor side of 
getting knowledge in the getting. The first seeks to make 
the world of possibilities alluring to the youth; the second, 
so to give elements of knowledge that they are deposited 
in the individual asdynamic. The second is quite as impor- 
tant as the first, probably more important, for knowledge 
through experience is most apt to be a working force. 
We need to say, here, that not every one can be expected to 
gain great initiative in forming and executing large plans. 
Yet the concrete touch with definite special tasks will enable 
those of low mental grade to prosecute the mechanical 
tasks and vocations with fair competency and will afford 
those of higher endowments opportunity and practice in 
building up the original impulses into self-directing and 
effective realizing agencies. 
Education as expression. —Looked at in the light of expres- 
sion, education may as legitimately be directed towards 
motor ends as towards sensory. The common opinion 
views only mind effort as truly educational. If educa- 
tion is expression, then training the individual to express 
himself along any line or in any valid form of activ- 
ity, is truly educational. Probably the average individual 
is better for both sensory and motor training, as well as 
capable ofit. There are certain individuals who are capable 
of taking very little mental training, and work at great 
disadvantage under what they do take. In some line of 
motor expression they are found to be very capable. If we 
maintained the right viewpoint, we should place them where
-P-A-G-E-254
ct Tn ee 
246 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
they belong, and give them that - of education to which 
they are adapted. A painting, a statue, a monument, a 
building, a machine, a piece of furniture is a product of 
motor expression, and it took true training in the case of 
each to produce it. The world needs such educated agents 
quite as much as the majority of individuals need such 
education. 
V. APPRECIATION 
Appreciation. — This element in education might be 
characterized as the taste and ability to recognize and select 
those features in nature, knowledge, and art which lend to the 
charm and contentment of life. In taking these up, as 
cultural lines, the beauties of nature and the training to 
enjoy them should evidently stand first, because the book 
of nature is open to every one. The need is that, having 
eyes to see, all may be enabled to see with them the glory 
and ideals of nature. Description of scenic phenomena, 
books of travel, and nature study are valuable adjuncts to 
immediate contact with nature itself. 
Perhaps the next most accessible element after nature 
culture is that of reading. The taste for the beautiful in 
literature and the habit of reading for pleasure, as well as 
for profit, are reliable means to give satisfaction in life. 
They can be developed in connection with all departments 
of academic work, especially along with English studies. 
Books to-day are almost as plentiful as beauties of nature. 
Public libraries have brought them within the reach 
of all.   Measured in terms of accessibility, or availability, per- 
haps music would follow on reading. In many cases it
-P-A-G-E-255
  SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 247 
might seem even more available. When possessed as an 
acquisition it is certainly the source of great satisfaction, and 
one of the likeliest agencies to provide entertainment, charm 
and solace. Singing is within the reach of all who have 
the ear and voice for it, and once developed is completely 
transportable. 
To the average person, painting and sculpture are least 
possible of attainment, the least accessible, since their 
passive enjoyment depends so largely on great art collec- 
tions, and since they are the most remote from the springs 
of modern life. Save as roads to nature, one could hardly 
justify the expenditure of much time on them in the average 
school. A few lessons on how to appreciate whatever there 
is of beauty in paintings would be of greater value than 
training to reproduce nature or life. 
VI. ARTICULATION OF TRAINING FACTORS 
The ideal. —The ideal plan of articulating the several 
elements which have been treated would be to group and 
fuse all the various factors about the thought of vocation 
which would serve as center or core of the school programme. 
At least a large part of the informational matter could be 
made to bear on the future calling, and to illuminate it in a 
cognate and codperative manner. It is almost impossible 
to plan for communities in general. Without the actual 
community before us, it is almost useless to declare just 
how this or that should relate itself to all the rest. Per- 
haps a few principles may be stated instead. 
1. Of course the locality will determine what or which 
vocational lines shall be emphasized. This training, 
whether agricultural, industrial, commercial, or professional,
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
should hold the center of the course in every case. The 
time to be spent on it will depend on whether the school 
programme has been thoroughly socialized, in whole and in 
subjects, or whether the vocational factor is merely added, 
ab extra. In the latter case, probably one half the time 
should be given to it after it is introduced. 
2. As between the general and special in vocational 
training it may be said that the ae down in the course of 
study, the greater the attention which should be given the 
special; while the higher the stage, the larger the amount 
of the general or contiguous work which may be introduced; 
although this probably should not exceed the proportion of 
one to two relative to the special. 
This holds for industrial as well as for other lines of work, 
and is based on the laws of mental development as well 
as on the relative importance of the general and special, in 
view of the possibility of the pb ine dropping out along 
the line. That is, low down the general can be little given, 
while the concrete special is more attainable and more 
liable to be of use. 
3. The groups of information should be begun as early in 
the course as possible. For instance, the factors of society, 
of collective life, are as available for teaching purposes in 
the lower grades of work as are those of the physical environ- 
ment. As has been said, the latter, in the shape of nature 
study, now leads up to and is eventually differentiated into 
the various natural sciences of later grades of work. So, 
the simple and descriptive facts of human associations and 
pursuits may be begun early, and be carried on until social 
study breaks up into various social sciences above. The 
same may be said of the study of self. The physical and
-P-A-G-E-257
SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 249 
social lines of information, in a somewhat differentiated form, 
could be carried on in the eighth or ninth grade. If one is 
to become a commercial or professional man in life the 
social studies should receive relatively more and more em- 
phasis; while if he is to follow an industrial calling the 
natural science studies should receive the stress. 
4. Those who will evidently leave school early, say at the 
end of the eighth grade, and who take industrial training, 
along with academic work, should give such proportion of 
time to each that each shall be attained to that reasonable 
degree the time will permit. As has been stated, about 
one half the time should be given to the industrial line to 
secure the skill an apprentice needs to enter upon work. 
This is the proportion of time given in certain trade schools. 
Much of the social information may be obtained in direct 
connection with the vocational work. 
5. Recent experiments seem to indicate that the mere 
instruments of learning and business may be obtained while 
the information process is going on and in a subordinate 
relation thereto. That is, they should be obtained in con- 
nection with knowledge-getting, and gradually develop out 
of concrete knowledge situations. As rapidly as they are 
controlled they should be put to use, and the skill to use 
them should be further developed by making them agents 
of acquisition. 
6. Since moralization is to take place, not so much by 
discussion of abstract situations as through group activities, 
the whole range of school associations should be used to 
convey high ideals in social relationships, and to secure 
deeply habitual right social adjustments. Class time is not 
too precious to consume for this end whenever an appropri-
-P-A-G-E-258
a a cake, a oe 
250 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
ate situation arises, and situations should be made. Every 
class-group, and the school as a ‘total group, should be 
vested with self-government responsibilities as rapidly as 
they are able to carry them, be helped to make their 
rules of collective conduct, in administering them with 
fairness and dispatch, and in treating offenses justly and 
firmly. It will thus be seen that no specific time relation 
can be set for this educative process. 
7. Wherever a pupil expects to make a life vocation in 
any esthetic line, his time should be allotted thereto as in 
any other vocational undertaking. For the average pupil 
in school the time spent in esthetic work should be a 
minimum relative to the vocational and other lines of train- 
ing, since the esthetic elements lie in the perimeter rather 
than in the center of the educational circle of work. The 
fundamental must have allotted space. The trimmings of 
life must be adjusted to them. 
Illustration from technical lines.—A typical way to artic- 
ulate the technical element with the other training factors 
may be seen in Ella Flagg Young’s development of the rela- 
tionship in strictly technical education. ‘ At the age of 
zo or 11 years, children should begin a substantial line of 
work in physics. Such work should have as its object the 
starting of children’s activity along the line of scientific 
inquiry. Instead of being an incidental subject taken up 
once or twice a week, it should be in the foreground daily. 
A prominent feature of the work should be experimentation 
with the lever, the wheel and axle, and the pulley, using simple 
apparatus constructed by the children; but the experimen- 
tation would fail of its possibilities if it did not lead to a 
discovery of the mechanical advantage involved and to a 
|  
-P-A-G-E-259
  SOCIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES 251 
recognition of this advantage in machines of all sorts that 
fall within the observation of the children. 
“ Another line of work—that leading to technical analysis— 
should be of a practical nature in connection with foods, 
plant fibers, and other useful plant products. In the fol- 
lowing year this scientific study should be extended to 
experimental work on the effects of heat and cold on solids, 
liquids, and gases, and a recognition of the effects in a 
variety. of things; a study of the gases of the atmosphere 
and of atmospheric pressure, involving hydraulic pressure, 
with a number of applications; a study of ventilation; 
practical work on the preservation of foods. In the eighth 
grade there should be a study of the electric battery, current 
electricity and its application in simple electric devices; a 
study of the eye, some work with lenses and the problem of 
lighting. 
“This programme would give boys and girls between the 
ages of ro or 11 and 14 or 15 years a good experimental basis 
in physics, chemistry, and biology, and in the practical or 
industrial arts. The method of handling would, in large 
measure, limit the young minds to the mechanical point 
of view, or stimulate those penetrative and constructive 
tendencies that underlie one of the richest modes of mental 
activity —the scientific imagination. If the method be 
the one commonly followed in the elementary science teach- 
ing, that of demonstration by the teacher, the capital that 
was gained in primary construction or handwork is not 
invested by children of average mental ability; motor 
images are not integrated in the experience; that experience 
is one-sided, sensory only. If the generalizations under- 
lying that recognition of principles which is essential to
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
scientific thinking are derived in considerable part from 
the leadings or hints of the demonstrator, there is for the 
members of the class slight or no deepening of the moments 
of experience. The impulse to handle, to shift, and to 
adjust the bar, the rope, or cord; the power to estimate the 
pressure which the fiber withstands, the amount of heat, 
the quality of the electric current, and to appraise the value 
of the experience that comes almost imperceptibly by way 
of the adjustments of the body — much of this impulse and 
this power is lost out of the work in science when the teacher 
adopts the method of demonstration. It may seem that 
too much time and space are here vse to the educational 
phase of elementary science. I think not. If technical 
training is to be articulated in the elementary-school course, 
it must be jointed in, not tagged on.” (N. E. A. Rept., 
1907, pp. 1038-9; see also socialization of the various sub 
jects, especially arithmetic and history.)
-P-A-G-E-261
CHAPTER XII. SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 
I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF CRITERIA AND 
METHODS 
Meaning of socialization of subjects. —In a previous 
chapter, the reconstruction of textbook subject-matter 
was denoted as one of the means or methods of socializing | 
the schools. 
By socializing a subject is meant (1) the process of 
bringing to bear on it some social criterion, some adequate 
test of value; (2) the elimination of the more useless and 
irrelevant portions as measured by the criterion; (3) the 
supplementing of this subject-matter by such useful addi- 
tions as seem necessary under the test; (4) the reorganiza- 
tion of the material which results into a new body of teach- 
ing knowledge. 
It will be evident that this undertaking stands in close 
kinship to the other method of socialization proposed as the 
accompaniment of this one, namely, the reorganization of 
the training programme so as more closely to express the 
present social situation. The relation of the two was dis- 
cussed in the preceding chapter. 
Criteria of various subjects not identical. —It might 
readily be conceived, without considerable deliberation, that 
if the criterion, social value, is assigned as the proper one to 
apply to subjects seeking admission to the school programme, 
the whole problem is ended, the only thing left to do is to 
apply the test and admit or reject the subject; likewise with 
253
-P-A-G-E-262
  
254 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
reference to the content of the various subjects admitted, 
that the same criterion of value will apply to all subjects 
alike. The first part of the supposition is correct. The 
only question about admitting any certain subject to the 
school is, does it possess greater socializing power than 
some other? Is it more usable in actual life? 
But when we have admitted, let us say, language study, 
history, arithmetic or number study, nature study, social 
study, etc., and we have then to decide what and how 
much of each, we do not have an identical criterion to apply 
immediately. Each subject has a particular test of its own. 
Each one has a specific social result to accomplish, which 
differentiates it from the others in the family of training 
factors. While all alike look to the general end of prepar- 
ing for social adjustment, each one has a subordinate end to 
subserve which is peculiar to itself. 
Thus, the subordinate end of American history study is 
not merely to get acquainted with a developing society, 
but to get a thorough grounding in those portions of Ameri- 
can development which bear on the present with especial 
emphasis, and also which bear on the vocational situation 
the pupil is to prepare for. The immediate end of number 
study is not to become conversant with the manipulation 
of quantity symbols in all their phases, but it is to control 
those forms of number computation the particular pupil is 
most likely to have to use in his business relations. The 
subordinate end of language study is not to become familiar 
with all the possible technical grammatical forms, or to 
become practiced in parsing with mathematical precision 
and lightning rapidity the most obscure poetical and oratori- 
cal passages; it is rather to obtain an accurate and facile use
-P-A-G-E-263
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 255 
of English expression, both for oral and for written commu- 
nication. The social purpose of nature study is likewise 
special, namely, to obtain a knowledge of those portions of 
nature lying or likely to be nearest our pathway, with special 
reference to understanding their control for use. And so on 
for the other subjects. 
No doubt the very best way to convey my meaning about 
socialization is by way of illustration. In order to empha- 
size the social point of view, with reference to the various 
individual lines of study, several subjects will be considered 
for the purpose of indicating what kind of changes are desir- 
able. A comprehensive treatment cannot be accorded any 
one subject. To do that would be to write a method of 
each on the basis of this viewpoint. 
In my estimation, the complete reconstruction of school 
studies must be done by actual teachers of those subjects 
who have had a thorough grounding in them, and who, 
in addition, grasp the principles and criterion of the social 
view of education so fundamentally that they will serve in all 
parts of their fields to separate the valuable from the worth- 
less. It is the teaching sense, in relation to each of the 
various subjects, which is needed for the accomplishment 
of the task and which any one person lacks who seeks to 
orient the social view for all. Hence there is need of a 
corps of collaborators. 
Il. THE SOCIALIZATION OF ARITHMETIC 
Elimination made by teachers of mathematics. —In 
getting arithmetic on the most practical and available basis, 
there must be kept in mind its social function as in the case 
of other studies. In a previous place its social service was
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
indicated. The primary use of numbers is the quantitative 
measure of property values in buying and selling economic 
goods. It is to apportion quantities of anything in order to 
its just distribution relative to individuals. 
So far as undifferentiated schools are concerned, those in 
which the masses are being educated, at present the prob- 
lem is how little of mathematics may be taught, what is 
the least possible amount of the same which may be given 
in school, and yet which will serve the purposes of life 
adequately. 
Professor Burgess Shank holds that disciplinary and cul- 
tural aims of mathematics are subordinate and incidental 
to the utilitarian. “The science of number and art of 
computation have been and will continue to be studied 
chiefly and primarily because of their use in the struggle for 
existence. The above statement applies more fully and 
powerfully to each succeeding generation than to the past. 
The more intelligent society becomes, the more complete 
the social structure, the more specialized the f inctions of the 
individual, the greater the need for that precisely quantita- 
tive application of scientific knowledge which is the chief 
social use of mathematics. Therefore, arithmetic and other 
branches of elementary mathematics will play a continually 
more important part, and hence require to be better learned 
and better taught in the twentieth century than ever in the 
past. 
“ But it evidently does not follow that arithmetic or ele- 
mentary mathematics requires a larger part in the school 
curriculum than heretofore. Recent improvements in 
teaching in this country have shown that children can be 
taught many more things and much more of each than was
-P-A-G-E-265
  
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 257 
possible in the poor schools of the past.” (Catalogue of 
State Normal School, Valley City, N. Dak., 1904-1905, p.15.) 
Prof. D. E. Smith of Teachers College, New York, states 
that if we place arithmetic on the utility basis, we must 
conclude that the general impression that a very great 
amount of time should be spent on it because of its exceed- 
ing usefulness, cannot be justified. 
“While accuracy and speed in simple fundamental proc- 
esses have been underestimated, the value of presenting 
numerous and varied themes in pure arithmetic, and of 
pressing each to great and difficult lengths, has been seriously 
overrated. For the ordinary purposes of non-technical 
daily life we need little of pure arithmetic beyond (1) count- 
ing, the knowledge of numbers and their representation to 
billions (the English thousand millions), (2) addition and 
multiplication of integers, of decimal fractions, with not 
more than three decimal places, and of simple common 
fractions, (3) subtraction of integers and decimal fractions, 
and (4) a little of division. 
“ Of applied ¢rithmetic we need to know (1) a few denomi- 
nate numbers, (2) the simple problems in reduction of such 
numbers, as from pounds to ounces, (3) a slight amount 
concerning addition and multiplication of such numbers, 
(4) some simple numerical geometry, including the mensu- 
ration of rectangles and parallelopipeds, and (5) enough 
of percentage to compute a commercial discount and the 
simple interest on a note.” 
The table of troy weight, the tables of apothecaries’ meas- 
ures and equation of payments are needed by but a few in 
very special lines. Few save engineers and scientists ever 
need cube and square root and then use tables instead
-P-A-G-E-266
  
258 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
of rules. Alligation (still taught in Germany), compound 
interest as taught, “compound (and even simple) propor- 
tion, greatest common divisor, complex fractions, and 
various other chapters likely might be omitted. These 
subjects, which are the ones which consume most of the time 
in the arithmetic classes of the grades after the fourth, are 
so rarely used in business that the ordinary tradesman or 
professional man almost forgets their meaning within a few 
months after leaving school.” Little is needed of compound 
numbers, on which a year of time is now spent. The 
metric system would displace them and save much time. 
On the utility basis this author thinks the child should 
have (x) ‘‘a good working knowledge of the fundamental 
processes ”’ set forth above, (2) “ accuracy and reasonable 
rapidity,” and (3) ‘‘ a knowledge of the ordinary problems 
of daily life. Were arithmetic taught for the utilities alone, 
all this could be accomplished in about a third of the time 
now given to the subject.” (The Teaching of Elementary 
Mathematics, pp. 20-23.) 
It may be predicted that as time goes on there will be 
a differentiation of arithmetic to meet the various lines of 
activity, and that while the theory of numbers will offer a 
common basis for all, with perhaps a few practical applica- 
tions for common social purposes, beyond that point the 
mathematics taught in the schools will pertain to the voca- 
tion in which the individual is to work. 
This is the tendency and largely the practice in the Ger- 
man continuation schools. For instance, the continuation 
school for business apprentices given in Chapter XIII takes 
its arithmetical problems from the actual business in which 
the pupils of a given group or class are engaged.
-P-A-G-E-267
    SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 259 
Localizing arithmetic. —The following suggestions by 
Principal G. R. Davies, on arithmetic for North Dakota, 
indicate how it might be adjusted to an agricultural region. 
(The Extension, Agricultural College, Fargo, N. Dak., 
December, 1908.) 
“ The predominant agricultural interests of the community 
open a wide field for applied arithmetic. The teacher who 
has some knowledge of scientific agriculture —as every 
teacher should — will continually take illustrative material 
from farm surroundings. Appropriate to the autumn sea- 
son would be problems involving total yield and rate of 
yield of various crops, cost of threshing, capacity of bins, 
rate of plowing, cost of labor, etc. In connection with such 
problems items of knowledge learned in other classes may 
often be recalled and thus reviewed. Questions involving 
price give an opportunity to fix the important social law of 
supply and demand. 
“Problems may be invented, or made from data furnished 
by the children, involving cost of raising stock, profit or 
loss on the same, live weight and dressed weight of meat, 
cost of fodder, nutritive ration and balanced ration, per- 
centage of butter fat in milk, and so on indefinitely. It is 
not expected, of course, that such problems would constitute 
the whole course of study, but rather that they would be 
thrown in as mental or written work when occasion offers. 
A live teacher necessarily uses much material that he must 
invent to fill some particular need, and there is no reason why 
such material should not be taken from the farm environ- 
ment. Several books are published that are helpful in this 
direction.” Among these may be mentioned Hall’s Prac- 
tical Arithmetic, published by American Book Company.
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
“Government statistical reports, such as the abstract of 
the census or the report of the Bureau of Statistics, though 
they take the pupil more widely afield, afford much useful 
data for problems. A class in need of practice in comput- 
ing percentages may well be referred to such sources. The 
material may be obtained by application to the various 
departments at Washington, or through one of the congress- 
men. Some of the subjects that may be taken up are 
changes in population of county, state, or nation; compari- 
son of cities; crop yields by states; output of industries; 
savings-bank deposits; rate of railroad accidents; cost of liv- 
ing as compared with former years. In connection with the 
latter subject, opportunity may well be taken to notice 
the relation of the rise in price level to wages, salaries, and 
the earnings of capital. The simple economic laws involved 
are not beyond the comprehension of a seventh or eighth 
grade pupil, and will be of assistance in developing an 
insight into the complexities of modern life. 
“ Outdoor measurements may be conducted by an entire 
class working together under the direction of the teacher, 
or by smaller groups if the class is large. A fourth or fifth 
grade will enjoy measuring the school yard and making 
accurate maps of it. This work will come in connection 
with the home geography. Later, areas may be meas- 
ured and computed in acres. A real knowledge of the 
foot, yard, rod, and acre will thus be developed. In the 
highest grades some interesting illustrative work may be 
done with the triangles. By setting stakes to mark the 
corners of two similar vertical right triangles in such a way 
that the apex of one triangle is some stone or post on the 
opposite shore of a pond or stream, it is possible by propor-
-P-A-G-E-269
  
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 261 
tion to compute the distance across the water by measure- 
ments taken on the one shore. Last spring I sent the boys 
of my geometry class to a neighboring stream to measure 
its width in this way. They were surprised to find that 
they could complete the measurement entirely from the one 
bank. The experiment enabled them to comprehend how 
the surveyor triangles across a valley. By the use of the 
same principle they computed the height of the flag-pole on 
the schoolhouse and of a near-by tree. 
“Local industries and civil organizations may be drawn 
on for data. The size of the elevator will furnish a problem 
in computing capacity. Use may be made of data concern- 
ing shipments of wheat, —cost, car capacity, destination, 
etc. When the class is studying taxes get the township or 
school clerk to inform you as to the valuation of the town- 
ship or district; let the class estimate the tax levy, and com- 
pute the rate. They may then extend the total tax for 
various imaginary or real individuals. ‘When my eighth 
grade was studying the subject last year, I obtained data 
from the tax receipts of the gentlemen who had property in 
several localities. The class found and compared the rates. 
“ Proportion and some other subjects are well illustrated 
by the physical laws of the pulley, lever, wheel, and inclined 
plane. The laws of motion and the principles of mechanics 
are thus introduced. They ought to be taught more than 
they are in the common school. Just recently I heard a 
supposedly intelligent person expressing wonder at the 
strength of a horse because it was moving a house. The 
block and tackle were overlooked. A person so ignorant 
of mechanical laws is not in a position to understand this 
machine age.
-P-A-G-E-270
  262 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
“Tt is essential in illustrating arithmetic that the teacher 
should be continually on the watch for material. Perhapsa 
mason will be setting stakes and strings to mark out the 
position of a foundation. You may see him measure from 
where two strings cross, eight feet on one string and six feet 
on the other. He then measures diagonally across to test his 
right angle. Call the attention of the eighth grade to the 
measurements — perhaps even have them reproduce them — 
and you will have thrown considerable light on the rule 
relating to the square on the hypotenuse. The teacher who 
is interested in his environment and is alive to the world of 
industry about him will soon bring arithmetic into touch 
with real life.” 
Ill. THE SOCIALIZATION OF HISTORY * 
What history should do for students. —In considering 
this subject no attempt is made to mark out the work and 
function of the historian in his original, specializing capacity 
as historian; but attention is called to some things which 
the educational situation seems to demand from histories. 
The sooner we can banish the polite information idea 
from our history study, the better off we shall be. We must 
substitute for it the idea that history gives information that 
is useful because it helps to throw light on the problems 
of our times, or is a study of those problems directly. We 
want men and women who can tell where our chariot of 
state is going, by knowing the meaning of the tendencies of 
the times. We want them to know how to vote in a national 
campaign on the tariff question because they understand 
* This treatment of history is the larger part of an article by the author 
entitled, “Reconstruction of History for Teaching Purposes,” which 
appeared in the School Review, October, 1909.
-P-A-G-E-271
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 263 
what the relation of the tariff to themselves and the national 
life is. We want them to understand the political system 
under which they live, in spirit and machinery, well enough 
to be able to decide whether their rights among men are 
being subserved or subverted; and if subverted, to have 
some notion of remedies. We want them to get larger 
visions of social equality and social justice, as against 
industrial exploitation and political deception; to burn 
with enthusiasm for the rights of man; to have ideals of a 
better society and faith in social progress. Since history 
holds such a large place in the schools, it must be held 
accountable for using this extensive and expensive time in the 
life of the child to secure directly practical results. It is a 
case of history or nothing, for history is about the only study 
now in the schools which extensively occupies this field. 
Bad conditions in history work. — Any criticism which 
might be made of the existing condition in history work of 
our schools must come from facts. We have results which 
stare us in the face as to what has not been accomplished 
in the past. We have an ignorant citizenship, ignorant of 
the meaning of the issues confronting us now and liable to 
be misled in their actions and attitudes relative to these 
problems. As a social fact we know that things are little 
understood. As teachers, we know what the results are 
along these lines. In several years’ experience as a teacher 
of history in secondary and college grades of work I found a 
deplorable ignorance of vital things relative to our national 
life, students in our elementary schools who had never dis- 
covered that there was such a thing as necessary sequence 
and as interdependence in human society. In other words, 
so¢iety as an organic thing did not exist for them. It was
-P-A-G-E-272
  264 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
not that they were not capable or that they were too imma- 
ture. They were generally mature, and they soon showed 
they were capable of grasping those easiest of all things in 
the range of history to teach. 
Second, there was a deplorable dislike of history and an 
aversion to contemplating the thought of further history 
work. Yet these students grew to like this field of study 
when they found that on were law and order in the 
historical field, and that it was not a matter of memory work 
but of appreciation and understanding. Once, as an experi- 
ment, I took a class of some sixty students, and as a part of 
their work studied with them dry-looking tables of immigra- 
tion and population, getting an idea of the laws of increase, 
and finding the causes of the variations in rates of increase 
in races and regions. The interest the class manifested in 
what, on the face of it, would seem very dry material for 
students of that grade of work, was a revelation as to what 
might be done in rationalizing valuable historical matter. 
The record runs that more teachers fail in their history 
examinations than in any other subject and in such an 
overwhelming manner as to create a problem. The nature 
of the subject, when adapted to the ages of the pupils, should 
not be so much more difficult than other subjects as to make 
this difference in resulting scholarship. 
Poor text and poor teaching. — The poor results above 
noted are no doubt due in part to poor teaching but mainly 
to poor texts. The first defect lies in the kind of content 
or subject-matter selected and embodied in the texts; for 
the writers have had little perception of the comparative 
value of the material for cause and effect purposes. Instead 
of testing their material by the criterion, what is most
-P-A-G-E-273
  
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 265 
determining? and what are the really greatest episodes? 
matter has been placed in the books because it has been the 
fashion of previous history writers to put such and such 
topics in. In other words, our history for schools has been 
on a traditional basis rather than on a rational. It has 
been chiefly military and political only, and it has handled 
these things in a lifeless, merely enumerative manner. And 
while, recently, some considerable social material of another 
kind has been put in, it has remained aloof from the other 
as a kind of outside spectator. As a criterion to serve as 
a guide for history purposes in general, I should say this: 
Emphasize only such episodes and conditions as have had 
a very perceptible influence in determining our present 
institutions and organizations. 
There is also a great defect in the texts, in that they 
devote too much time to events remote in time and too 
little to those which are near. Our histories have commonly 
proceeded after the spirit of the statement the philosopher 
Hegel made relative to the Chinese: A Chinaman is first 
good for something when he is dead. So our textbook 
makers have supposed that only dead history is good history, 
and the deader the history the better. If it was a matter 
of general history, they would spend most of the time on 
ancient history; and if either modern or ancient were to be 
omitted it would be the modern. If it was a case of Ameri- 
can history, the colonial would get the benefit of the greater 
time as compared with the national; and some authors have 
seemed to think that this present end of our national history 
is hardly worth mentioning. Both kinds of procedure are 
wrong. The present is the only time worth anything for 
the average man, and the past should be given him only in so
-P-A-G-E-274
266 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
far as it is made to bear a vital relation to the social situation 
now confronting him. The average man gets only a little 
time to give to the study of social matters, and he should be 
led to those which are important to him as directly as 
possible. 
The third defect of texts is in the matter of organization. 
Most of our histories show a sad lack of organizing principle. 
Many texts are mere jumbles of things. Many texts written 
for secondary schools by reputed historians are mere 
epitomes of all the incidents that have in any way got con- 
nected with our national career. They present good 
illustrations of the original chaos of matter. They contain 
many hundreds of topics, whith, in their arrangement, have 
little relation to each other, as a general thing. They are 
strung together as they are just because their events 
happened in that order. They are mere chronologies, not 
history. They have not been rationalized. 
Process of reconstruction. — Reconstruction of history 
for better teaching purposes would naturally fall along the 
lines of the criticisms which are made. This reconstruction 
must be made either by the teachers of history as they take 
up the work with the classes, or it-must be made by the 
text writers. And, since we teach mostly by texts, we have 
to think that the writers will have to do the reconstructing. 
First, the merely traditional matter should be eliminated. 
According to the criterion, anything is in the merely tradi- 
tional class which has not quite visibly affected our current 
ofdevelopment. By this standard there should be relegated 
to the rubbish heap much of the matter relative to discoveries 
and explorations; about all that relates to the record of single 
colonies; much under the head of colonial wars and Indian 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 267 
wars; many of the events leading up to the Revolutionary 
War. In the national period we might cut out much that 
has been put in relative to national presidential campaigns, 
election accounts and administrative events; a large part 
of the military records in the way of detailing single bat- 
tles and unimportant campaigns; all the so-called literary 
history, because we have literature in the schools apart from 
history; much that has been introduced of an intricate 
nature under foreign affairs in the period following the 
beginning of our present constitutional government; and 
much of the merely political reconstruction chronicle. By 
means of eliminating this material, which is inherently 
worthless and uninteresting, and for our national develop- 
ment, in the light of our present institutions, is inconse- 
quential, we should gain much needed time for either better 
historical matter or for the introduction of the vocational 
lines into our schools. Other subjects besides history 
must undergo a like surgical operation for the same reasons. 
The second process in reconstruction is the incorporation 
of material of a more vital nature in the place of that 
eliminated. To demonstrate what this would be and how it 
should be worked out, would be to write a text. All that 
can be done here is to indicate some of the more important 
things commonly omitted or left undeveloped. In the 
pre-national period there should be a larger development of 
the economic causes of the discovery of America and of the 
so-called Revolutionary War. The latter, in particular, is 
still undeveloped in the best of our school histories. The 
only place where there is adequate treatment of this phase 
of the struggle for separation is in industrial and economic 
histories. Another colonial matter not enough developed is
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
the development of religious toleration and the beginnings 
and growth of our American system of entire separation 
of church and state. Anyone who cares for freedom of 
thought must be sensible of the advantages of the American 
system over the old system of state religion, and this is 
emphasized by the fact that the biggest struggles for human 
emancipation right now are going on in Europe to put those 
states on the American basis. 
Colonial history should include a treatment of the forma- 
tion of our national life, which is entirely omitted from our 
histories. No one thinks it worth while to explain that our 
Union was made possible only because the thirteen colonies 
had more things in common, had more similarities, than 
they had differences. Yet there is no historical instance of 
so many as thirteen states which were unlike in race, lan- 
guage, political and social institutions, and in literature, 
religion and traditions, ever getting together and forming a 
perpetual union, even under the stress of a common enemy. 
This is the fundamental set of facts in explanation of the 
formation of the nation; the Union cannot be rationally 
explained without them; yet they are hardly mentioned, 
much less developed, in our texts. 
In the race for the possession and control of America, 
there should be some development given to the consequent 
significance of the outcome for civilization, and especially 
for American civilization. Fiske called the capture of 
Quebec the turning point in modern history. 
A more adequate treatment of the industrial and political 
system which prevailed at the time of the struggle for 
independence than is now given should be made. A good 
all-around study of existing society at that time would be
-P-A-G-E-277
  
  SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 269 
far more valuable than the attempt to detail the successive 
events in all the various colonies. Particularly I think the 
home and domestic system of production which then 
prevailed, in its significance for labor, consumption, and 
possibilities and restrictions of life, should have an extended 
treatment. A vivid description of the productive processes 
which were carried on on the plantations under slave life, 
on the small farms in New England by men and women 
under their primitive division of labor; of nail making, shoe 
making, cloth making and garment making, etc., would go 
far to make the life of that period real, and to give a grasp 
of the dependence of the various divisions of labor on each 
other. 
In our national period, our histories are deplorably weak 
in their development of the economic background of our 
national life, and in showing the rational significance of that 
part of the economic matter which is introduced. It is a 
stupendously significant thing that our young people can 
and do get out of from one to four years in history study 
without knowing there has been an industrial revolution, 
and without knowing its vast significance for human life. 
Yet, who could explain, in any scientific way, the factory 
system, along with our present system of production in 
factories and on farms, and the consequent difference 
it makes for life to-day as compared with life before as 
seen in colonial times and on the frontiers; the appearance 
of new transportation and communication agencies; of the 
great daily, weekly and periodical press; of great cities on 
every hand; of the appearance of gigantic organizations 
of labor and of capital, with their consequent conflicts and 
problems, and of many other phenomena, without taking
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
up in an expansive and systematic manner the industria) 
revolution? It has made a new order of things, and you 
can give no history during the last hundred years in any 
advanced nation without dealing with this subject; for it 
was truly revolutionary, in that it transformed society in 
spirit and organization in fundamental ways; and there is 
not a phase of life that has not been and is not now affected 
by it. 
It is the machine age we are in, the age of inventions. 
This distinguishes our age from all preceding ages, even more 
than do our political peculiarities; not only in the fact that 
it exempts men from doing much of the drudgery connected 
with production by their own muscular power, but in the 
fact that it has specialized and differentiated society more in 
a century than had been done in all preceding ages by all the 
agencies men had previously devised; and further in the 
fact that the special forms our problems of society take 
to-day have their explanation in the appearance of these 
revolutionizing inventions. 
Another indication of the short treatment of economic 
matters in our histories is the fact that our students have 
little conception of the causes, nature, and importance of a 
great social phenomenon which has occurred every ten or 
twenty years in our national life, and that each time it 
occurs shakes our social fabric to its foundations —what we 
call panics and depressions. It is an educational misfortune, 
that we should spend from one to four years in studying, 
or studying about, human society, and yet turn out people 
for citizenship who do not know the common causes of one 
of the most ordinary and important events. Why not write 
a chapter on panics in the text, describe and treat all our
-P-A-G-E-279
  SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 271 
important panics in such manner that the similarities and 
consequent explanations would appear, so that the man and 
woman would be in sight of giving a scientific account of 
them and could help to shape human affairs for their con- 
trol? Is it because the text makers do not understand the 
subject or because it might destroy the artistic symmetry of 
the book? But if history is of any use it must give such an 
account of affairs that we may understand and so be able to 
controlthem. Our histories, if they are going to occupy the 
field, must do the necessary things. 
In the same manner, we should need to give an adequate 
economic account of the rise of monopolies, of their signifi- 
cance for life, of their causes in the peculiarities of the times, 
of their extension into the various lines of transportation, 
manufacture, distribution. We should need to show the 
connection between modern business life and government, so 
that the citizen might see the exact place and function of 
government in organized society. I venture to say that 
most of our people have no sort of notion as to what the 
legitimate function of government is, and, consequently, 
are all at sea as to where government should begin and end 
in relation to businesses of all sorts. 
A great uncultivated gap in our political history exists 
relative to our political parties. I have found few pupils, 
who have come to me from the schools, who have had an 
idea of the meaning of parties in our history. They are 
just things to study about but they do not mean anything to 
them. I think it is easy to maintain that the place to begin 
to study our government is with the parties, and that we 
cannot know much about why our political history takes the 
course it does without seeing that those organizations
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
which control the avenue to governmental positions control 
the government and government policies. In other words, 
we have to get down to a study of party organization by 
means of which they control nominations and elections. 
This is more indispensable as a matter of understanding our 
government now than a study of the Constitution of the 
United States. 
Organization of history material. — As to the matter of 
organization of history material into textbook shape a 
great deal ought to be said. Of course, the average teacher 
can do little more than reproduce the matter of the text in 
just the shape in which it is placed in the text. The chop- 
feed method of treatment of our histories in general, there- 
fore, is a bad method of class presentation. The logic of 
events is lost because of the hop-skip-and-jump procedure 
from the political to the industrial, then to the religious, 
to the literary, etc., and this every ten years. There is a 
discontinuity that is bewildering. History is shot full of 
gaps. Neither teacher nor pupil puts things together in a 
causal way. 
Our texts would do better if they should pursue the con- 
tinuous-development method of presenting matters, that is, 
take up one line of interests or activities and carry it through 
the course of a whole epoch or period without interjecting 
between its parts in the course of the period other kinds of 
interests and activities. I have tried this and found it 
works in an admirable fashion. To illustrate, I will name 
the topics I carried through continuously from 1789 to the 
Civil War, or such as extended through the whole of the 
period: Organization of government and parties; struggle 
for commerical independence; westward expansion of
-P-A-G-E-281
  
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 273 
territory; development of population and transportation 
facilities; revolutionizing inventions and processes; political 
parties and doctrines; establishment and growth of protec- 
tive tariff; some problems in finance and banking; develop- 
ment of the slavery issue; chief international problems. 
And when we reflect, we find that this continuous develop- 
ment of a single series of events or interests is just the sort 
of knowledge the citizen needs. He needs to know the 
tariff history in itself, the financial history in itself, party 
history in itself, and so on. He must know it this way in 
order to understand it. If it is not developed that way for 
him in school he is likely never to develop it. 
The briefest kind of sketch of this matter deserves that 
some attention should be paid to adaption of history to the 
different ages or educational stages. Mainly, I think, the 
adjustment should consist in pedagogical devices rather 
than in the matter; although I am aware that the exponents 
of the concentric-circle view have been led to admit that in 
covering the circles of history, each time in a more exhaust- 
ive manner, really new material is given. Yet I maintain 
that the object is the same for all ages, namely, to give as 
good a knowledge of the working of the child’s own society 
as the stage of mental development will permit. Essentially 
the same matter of community life must be given in order 
to secure this object, although the form which the material 
takes will vary widely. A knowledge, in the larger aspects 
and in the social relatedness, of our social processes, for 
instance, can be given quite young children so that they can 
see the work and significance of mills, railroads, telegraph, 
farmers, schools, government, and so on, for our lives. The 
same material later on is more systematized and put under
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
the reign of principles. But in each stage we should avoid 
wasting time on mere frills under the mistaken idea that 
the child cannot grasp vital social facts. 
IV. THE SOCIALIZATION OF OTHER SUBJECTS 
To undertake to deal adequately with all the subjects in 
the schools, in order to show the method and results of 
socializing them, would require more space, and certainly 
more ability and insight, than may validly be claimed. A 
few suggestions, however, may not appear inappropriate. 
Language study. — The function of language, on the 
associational side, is to act as a medium of communication 
of ideas between members of the same society; on the 
individual side, it is to serve as a means of getting informa- 
tion from records in which the knowledge isembodied. The 
one thing essential to the individual, in order to be able to 
accomplish either of these two things, is the possession of 
and the ability to use the language which is the vehicle 
of the ideas to be obtained or communicated. Whatever 
factors of instruction and elements in subject-matter are’ 
essential for the attainment of quick apprehension and clear 
accurate expression, by means of language, should be 
found in the schools. Whatever does not directly give 
aid to this end, in a very fundamental way, should be 
eliminated. ; 
As language is in the nature of a social device, it is to 
be held in much the same regard as any other human 
agency with which to get work done. In taking up the use 
of tools and machines, the design is to get the largest facility 
and skill in their use in the shortest possible time. Expedi- 
ents are not set up with a view to prolonging the period of
-P-A-G-E-283
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 275 
apprenticeship. Doubtless this would be the reasonable 
criterion to accept as the criterion of language. 
The above remarks would lead us to say that our method 
employed in the acquisition of words for use, either in the 
way of speaking or writing, should be that which will bear us 
to the desired end in the shortest time. Ifa short cut can 
be devised, so much to be thankful for, as individuals are 
saved time to put in on something else. If some one could 
devise a way by which to learn to talk and write in half the 
time now required, what true educator would not rejoice? 
Two chief methods are employed to secure language 
ability, along with discipline, culture, and other ends. The 
first has been an extensive study of grammar, formal 
grammar. Whatever may be the efficiency of grammar in 
gaining for pupils the other ends, it possesses little in secur- 
ing language skill. “It is now generally admitted by 
scholars that the chief reason for the study of technical 
grammar is not its practical and direct bearing upon 
expression, but the insight it gives into the logic of language. 
Prof. W. D. Whitney voices the general sentiment among 
scholars when he says that the leading object of technical 
grammar is not to teach the correct use of English, but that 
grammar is the reflective study of language.” (L. E. Wolf, 
“English in the Elementary Schools,” Ed. Rev., 28, 162.) 
Formal grammar is to the practical acquisition of lan- 
guage what formal logic is to the establishment of our 
common thought processes. Both are witnesses after the 
fact. Almost all is over when they appear on the scene, and 
they can influence the case but little. 
The other method used to attain efficiency in language 
is constructive language work. This is the really legitimate
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
and effective means of the accomplishment. Expression of 
the learner’s own ideas is the very core of this method, 
expression of his thoughts according to the rules and forms 
of good usage. Along with this comes another valuable fact 
that observation and expression of things and processes 
lying in the immediate social and physical context are 
far more serviceable in creating or cultivating ability to 
communicate ideas directly and accurately than the usual 
slavish imitation of masterpieces. Masterpieces of litera- 
ture are valuable stimulants for the imagination, when 
rightly used; they are appropriate to serve as models of 
usage and form, but, incessantly followed, they mold the 
mind to their form and repress individual self-expression. 
When the average person, if writing an essay, will choose 
such abstract subjects as war, peace, ambition, etc., rather 
than some phase of nature or life which touches him every 
day; or in conversation has not the power to talk interest- 
ingly one minute about the objects and conditions which 
surround him; it is evident that constructive language 
training has before it a vast field and rich possibilities in 
opening up the field of critical observation of near-by 
phenomena and of their analytical and descriptive expres- 
sion. It may thus become a means not only of securing a 
command of direct clear English, but also of developing the 
powers of observation, and of accumulating a fund of most 
useful information, for our most useful facts lie within our 
own horizon. 
In the light of our criterion, therefore, we need to insist 
on emphasizing the constructive and self-expressive side 
at the expense of merely formal grammar. We should not 
go so far as to say that the latter should be abolished from
-P-A-G-E-285
  
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 277 
the schools, but that it should be used in the process of 
getting pure speech established as a habit, that is, subor- 
dinated to constructive language work, and as much as is 
needed, for that purpose, incorporated in the constructive 
language process. Most of our courses of study follow this 
plan, but then take two years at the close of the elementary 
period largely to be devoted to formal grammar, This puts 
it on the disciplinary basis, views it as an end in itself, rather 
than as a contributive aid in securing the vehicle of expres- 
sion in the speediest manner. 
By a careful selection of just the essential principles of 
grammar to aid in constructive language getting, and a 
scientific subordination, a great deal of time will be saved for 
the needed training matter which is knocking for admission. 
Here is a place certainly where much time can be gained. 
Spelling. — If so much can be admitted, as within reason, 
when the method which is to be brought to bear on language, 
for its acquisition, is under consideration, shall not as much 
be conceded when the nature of the language to be taught 
is in question? In the phrase ‘“ nature of the language ” 
is meant its power of resistance, or the inherent difficulty 
of control. Of the various modern languages, it may be 
said that: they differ greatly in their power to resist the 
learner. These differences very largely arise out of the 
arrangement of the words in the sentence, pronunciation, 
and especially the amount and nature of inflection to 
which they are subject. The English language, which most 
closely interests American educators, is relatively simple 
in the last of these particulars, and as Professor Brander 
Matthews writes, it is thereby peculiarly fitted to become 
the world-language,  
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
But, in another particular, it is exceedingly difficult of 
attainment. A multitude of words are subject to a spelling 
which is anything but rational. Many letters are contained 
which represent no sound, and which a learner would 
never guess were present from hearing the words which 
‘contain them pronounced. Our language, therefore, not 
only subjects the foreigner taking it up to incalculable 
work, but requires of our own children a prodigious amount 
of memory effort, which is superfluous, because it is irra- 
tional. An industrial community which keeps in use pat- 
terns of machines which have been greatly improved on by 
later models or have been entirely replaced by newer 
inventions, would be termed unprogressive and industrially 
wasteful. Municipal transportation companies have been 
known to displace one system of motor power for another, 
notwithstanding the former was in good condition, because 
the latter had strong marks of superiority. Manufacturers 
are willing to cast out old machines for new when time- 
killing features have been removed. Economy is a funda- 
mental law in business enterprise. Waste in time and 
material are to be eliminated whenever detected. 
One of the greatest benefits which could be conferred on 
the schools would ensue if spelling could be put on a really 
rational basis. The ideal is of course that all words should 
be spelled just as they sound. This would reduce spelling 
to an exact system of phonetics. Spelling would be a simple 
and easy matter if sound values were preserved as the mark 
of correctness. As a machine or tool to get control of as 
quickly as possible, it would be thought that all rational 
persons would at once agree that language work should 
speedily be put on this foundation. Such is the conservatism
-P-A-G-E-287
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 279 
of the English race, however, that many otherwise intelli- 
gent people oppose the suggestion. The proposal has been 
made time after time only to die still-born. It will be a long 
time ere the race will move up to that plane where such a 
sweeping reform may be made. Gradual introduction of 
spelling reform is the most which can be hoped for. 
The Simplified Spelling Board, operating under the 
Carnegie endowment, takes advantage of the well-known 
facts in the history of the English language, that the 
present illogical and inconvenient forms of words were 
fastened on the language, in the early days of printing, by 
the typesetters and proof readers, who found it easier to 
spell by some sort of system than entirely arbitrarily, but 
who did not feel at liberty to spell by sound or to use the 
letters which most clearly produced the words. Later, the 
lexicographers came to the aid of the proof readers in fixing 
the form. Particularly, Dr. Johnson exerted a superior 
influence in this respect. He followed the proof readers’ 
method of spelling, and simply settled many disputes among 
them by choosing the one which was oldest and worst. In 
effecting this, Dr. Lounsbury says that “ propriety was 
disregarded, etymology perverted, and every principle of 
orthography denied; and that men of culture blindly 
followed in the wake of a movement which they had not 
the power and probably not the knowledge to direct.” 
Accompanying a list of three hundred words which the 
Simplified Spelling Board has sent out, to which simpler 
spelling may be applied, is this statement, which seems to 
contain the principles to guide in the work of reform: 
“The rules and analogies which underlie English spelling 
can, however, be ascertained and stated, and the exceptions
-P-A-G-E-288
  280 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
can then be clearly seen. The next thing is to reduce or 
abolish the exceptions. The process has worked well with 
many words. Why not continue it with other words? 
The matter is really very simple. When the rules and the 
analogies are understood, any intelligent person can see for 
himself when a particular spelling deviates from them. 
Thus, anyone can see that binn, bunn, butt, are out of 
accord with the rule established by the innumerable words 
like pin, pun, cut; that centre, metre, fibre, etc., are out of 
accord with the rule established by canter, number, timber, 
diameter, etc.; and that favour, honour, etc., are out of 
accord with the rule established by error, terror, minor, 
major, editor, senator, etc. So likewise dript, dropt, snapt, 
drest, prest, etc., tho now actually less common than 
dripped, dropped, snapped, crossed, dressed, are more in 
accord with the prevailing analogy of p or s before a ¢-sound, 
which appears in apt, host, boast, best, nest, rust, etc.; and 
in the old spelling, still retained, of some preterits and 
participles, as crept, lost, swept, etc., as well as dreamt, 
leapt, etc.” (Circular No. 2, March, 21, 1906.) 
The spellers and the spelling process in the schools need 
simplification. The constitution of the spelling-books has 
been greatly improved in recent years, but improvement 
might still be made towards reducing the list of words not 
frequently used, or hardly ever used, replacing them with 
those nearer to the average child’s environment. There 
is a good work for some one with great patience and wisdom 
in the construction of a real child’s dictionary. 
One way to bring the spelling lessons near the child’s 
actual vocabulary is by a larger use of the readers and 
texts as sources of words to be spelled. This is a very
-P-A-G-E-289
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 281 
practical source, for the words spelled are obtained in their 
contextual relations, so that the meanings are attached to 
them. The child is not spelling an abstraction, then, but 
something which he is using. The association is valuable 
asa memory aid. Perhaps an alternate use of the spellers 
and other schoolbooks, in spelling exercises, might act as a 
corrective of spelling-books. Throwing words into cognate 
groups, such as farming terms, mining terms, geographical 
terms, etc., might prove serviceable in offering the associa- 
tional factor. 
Geography. — Geography, as it has been constituted, and 
isat present, for the most part, could be described aptly as the 
conglomeration of everything and the unification of nothing. 
It has certainly stood in need of the application of a rational 
criterion. It may be that when our studies get properly 
differentiated as nature study, social study, language study, 
number study, etc., we shall discover either that geography 
has no place at all because its facts have been absorbed by 
the others, or that there is a very detinite sphere of valuable 
knowledge left to be taught. 
Geography is a study which, without the social criterion 
as a measuring-rod of value to apply to matter coming up 
for inclusion in it, is liable to be pretty much all one thing 
or another, or a jumble of both. A geography teacher in a 
Normal School asked me recently if I did not think that 
geography should be just a study of geology. This expresses 
the tendency to make it alla certain thing. Another teacher 
of long experience in Normal School work made a hodge- 
podge of it. Her pupils rushed desperately and blindly 
after forms of government of past nations, religious doc- 
trines of obscure people, polygamous practices of the
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
Innuits, etc. They had no notion of what they were doing. 
They were just doing work’ for mysterious reasons. It is 
conceivable that some one else should rush to the extreme 
of making geography almost wholly a social study and 
merely exploit the various phases of society as such. This 
would be as bad as to make it all geology. 
In my estimation, geography should have as its founda- 
tion the idea that community life is to be explained by its 
physical settings. It should bind the physical environments 
with the social groupings. It should show how a given 
community is related to its material surroundings, that is, 
the community is likely to be what it is because the natural 
environment is what it is. 
An illustration or two may explain this meaning. 
Chicago is the product of a particular region. It is the 
expression of the physical possibilities of that area centering 
in itself. Its location in that area explains it. It is at the 
point of the lake system and at the mouth of a river that 
formerly connected it by portage with the interior river 
system. By reason of this it became a fur market, then a 
grain market and distributing point; after the railroads 
entered, a livestock market, a manufacturing and whole- 
saling center, etc. 
It was made by its natural transportation possibilities in 
the beginning. Then when railroads arose, they centered 
there because it had become a large point and because 
freight vessels from all northern points cleared there, making 
it thus serve as a depot and distributing place of a still 
larger region than when dependent on rivers and lakes 
alone. So now Chicago is what it is because its splendid 
transportation system enables it to exploit the various 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 283 
sources of wealth of a wonderfully large and rich contiguous 
region. The geography of Chicago would consist in tak- 
ing up its dependence on the environment, and its chief 
interests; to show how they reach out into the surrounding 
region, draw in products from that region, and in exchange 
send back other goods. 
Or take the case of New York. Its relation to larger and 
larger areas, as the transportation connections developed, 
explains it. Naturally it had one of the best locations on 
the eastern coast. The ocean connected it commercially 
with Europe, while it had access to the interior by way of the 
Hudson River and Lake Champlain leading to Canada, and 
by way of the Mohawk River valley leading to the West. In 
course of time these things would have made it the pre- 
eminent city of the East. The Erie canal more speedily 
made it the leading city commercially. Cheap freight 
rates were established to the West by water, and New York 
became the chief commercial connecting link with Europe. 
As in the case of every city, large or small, the numerous 
lines of businesses established there were merely central gan- 
glia, connecting by transporting ways with the raw material 
resources throughout the contiguous region. To explain 
New York would be to trace the origin of these various kinds 
of business there, in answer to some demand of the region 
about. 
A complete geography would be the exposition of com- 
munity after community in the light of the above sugges- 
tion. Evidently this would be impossible in the time at the 
disposal of the average individual. It would be of question- 
able value anyway, perhaps, as compared with the valuable 
things which must be done. But the idea is desirable and  
-P-A-G-E-292
  
284 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
imperative as securing the very fruit which the child needs 
as the result of the study of geography. It should know 
those things. The method unifies the matter which is to 
be studied. 
Now, the results may be obtained in either of two ways. 
Types of communities might be worked out until the world 
were fairly well understood. That is, a succession of 
typical communities could be studied which would afford 
the essentials of the world’s geography. 
Asan alternative to this a world geography, or as much less 
than that as may be demanded by the circumstances, might 
be developed by beginning with the local community, and 
from that ascending through a series of larger and larger 
areas until the total world were involved. Some such line 
of procedure as that indicated below would serve to furnish 
the valuable knowledge the child needs, and also, at the 
same time, to secure a progressive and systematic subject. 
1. The study of a small local area, such as a farm, to get 
the ideas of space relations established and of human beings 
in relation to the soil on the one hand and to society in the 
shape of markets on the other. 
2. The study of the nearest community centered about 
a trading point in its various phases. 
(1) What natural advantages caused people to locate 
there and enable them to sustain themselves. 
(2) The occupations of the people based on the natural 
advantages and resources. 
(3) Other occupations which have grown up on the basis 
of advantage of the location in relation to the larger world. 
(4) The kind of people as to nationality and race in so 
far as these things affect the community life.
-P-A-G-E-293
SOCIALIZATION OF SUBJECTS 285 
(5) Transportation facilities, natural and artificial, as 
connecting the community with other communities and as 
affording the advantages of markets for products and of 
sources of supplies. 
(6) The effect of the occupations of the community on 
the people, their habits, customs, education, government, 
religion, cultural activities, etc. 
3- The study of the smallest distinct physical division of 
the state or nation, that is, where physical features, climatic 
conditions and resources and products are similar and the 
whole may be unified on the basis of the causal conditions. 
Of course this region should be the nearest one. Some of 
the leading considerations would be as follows: 
(1) The topography in its area, configuration, altitude, 
and water courses, showing how each of these bears on the 
distribution of population. 
(2) Climatic conditions in temperature, length of seasons, 
and amount of moisture precipitation with reference to 
farming and other occupations, their conditioning of kinds 
of occupations, products, etc. 
(3) Soil and natural resources, such as forests, fish, 
mines, and waterfalls, in their significance for farming, 
lumbering, fishing, mining and manufacturing industries. 
The kinds of soil and the fertility of the soil would further 
differentiate occupations. 
(4) Populations, races and nationalities as to origins 
and characteristics, only in so far as they are necessary to 
explain differences which retard or promote the regional 
well-being and in so far as they illustrate the larger world. 
(5) Industries, in their bearing on the location and 
distribution of people, their reasons for particular locations,
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
their relation to the life of the region, and their conditioning 
influences in the establishment and maintenance of com- 
merical relations with the larger world. 
(6) Transportation and communicating facilities, in their 
bearing on the prosperity and satisfactions of the region and 
their influence on locating larger collective populations for 
commerce and manufacturing. In connection with these 
last two points much supplementary reading might be done. 
This is a good place to get out into the larger world by 
following the threads of communication and transportation | 
to see how they really relate and unify the region with others. 
»(7) Influence of the pursuits and occupations on the life 
of the people of the region in the way of customs, habita- 
tions, dress, education, religion, culture and government. 
4. The study of one or more regions, either contiguous to 
or remote from the preceding, in the various aspects indicated 
above, for purposes of expansion and comparison of ideas. 
5. A physiographical study of the United States, calling 
attention to the similarities to and differences from the 
regions studied, and showing the larger unity through iden- 
tity of interests and transporting systems. 
6. An expansive study, by means of physiographical 
maps, of the various continents, indicating their connections 
with America by commercial routes, the chief products they 
interchange with us, the bearing of atmospheric and oceanic 
currents in so far as they affect trade and communication. 
To the degree to which the individuals in training recog- 
nize a vocational object before them their geographical work 
would naturally emphasize those aspects which lie most in 
line with their future interests. 
Physiology. — Much deserves to be written on this sub-

ject. Hardly anything touches the vitals of life and society 
more closely than the things which should be taught here. 
Our textbook writers have been chiefly interested in giving 
a scientific account of the human organism, and secondarily 
concerned with the relation of that mechanism to the 
environment. It would evidently be a great advantage to 
develop the latter phase, even at the expense of the former, 
if necessary. 
If we stop to reflect that the health of our municipalities 
depends on pure water supplies, good sewer and drainage 
systems, properly constructed houses relative to heat and 
ventilation, clean streets and market places, air free of 
smoke, pure food and milk, etc., and that its maintenance 
depends on the intelligent interest and codperation of all the 
people, it becomes apparent that specific information along 
these lines, as well as on others, is imperatively demanded. 
Half of our population is now living in compact groups. 
Soon a far greater portion will dwell in cities. For the sake 
of the health of all, it behooves our schools to open up this 
practical side of physiology and hygiene. 
It is also becoming apparent that many of these topics are 
of concern to rural regions. So long as farmers empty 
slops and sewage about the wells which contain their drink- 
ing water, dig wells in barnyards to be used alike by man 
and beast, maintain outdoor closets so vile and filthy as 
to stifle those patronizing them, leave dead animals.to rot 
unburied near dwellings, encourage conditions which breed 
germ-transmitting flies by the millions, defy laws of air 
space and ventilation in homes and school buildings alike, 
there is ample confirmation of the assertion that our rural 
schools should see a like extension of these subjects.

It would seem that a very practical and highly interesting 
book for use in the schools could be written which should 
devote at least one half of its space to depicting the impor- 
tance of maintaining sanitary conditions and of describing 
in graphic detail the various devices in use to secure them. 
Here, for example, would be a very practical way to 
combine the physiological and the sanitary side, relative to 
circulation of the blood and the lungs: 1. The circulating 
system, and what the blood does for the body. 2. The 
lungs as the purifier of the blood, and the necessity for pure 
air. 3. External conditions which pollute the air. 4. De- 
vices, mechanical and social, by which good conditions are 
to be maintained. A chapter could be given to each heading, 
or at least quite an expansive treatment, thus affording the 
necessary knowledge of facts and their relations. 
Or a good treatment could be given the subject of 
foods and digestion, such as is suggested in this series of 
topics: 1, The stomach as a chemical laboratory. 2. Di- 
gestion and its relation to other bodily processes, such as 
circulation, etc. 3. The chemistry of foods, their choice, 
preparation, preservation, as bearing on the chemistry of 
the digestive processes and on health, 4. Sanitary condi- 
tions and surroundings of food: cleanliness, disinfection, 
flies as food polluters, and methods of exterminating them 
by controlling the conditions which breed them, etc. 
Other bodily processes which are essential to health and 
service could be treated in the same practical manner.

CHAPTER XIII. SOME SOCIALIZED PROGRAMMES 
Difficulty of constructing programmes. — It does not seem 
advisable, for various reasons, to attempt to construct courses 
of studies for the schools. First, because there is such a 
great diversity of communities, each with its dominant inter- 
est, which would make it imperative to construct as many 
programmes of study as there are varieties of community 
interests. I believe this volume furnishes the principles for 
constructing a course of study for any community, but I 
certainly do not possess the detailed and technical informa- 
tion involved in each of these regions to enable me to work 
out a suitable schedule for each one. Second, a thoroughly 
worked out schedule would await the socialization of the 
several subjects now taught in the schools. Since this has 
but just begun, a complete programme is at present evi- 
dently impossible. Conservatism, lack of means, etc., on the 
part of schools and communities would constitute barriers 
to the adoption of ready-made courses, however good. 
I shall content myself, consequently, with suggesting a 
possible course for agricultural regions, with presenting 
one proposed for manufacturing communities, and two 
German continuation school courses. The latter are ex- 
hibited for the purpose of showing how the various ele- 
ments are combined in the courses, and how some of the 
subjects are socialized and pointed toward the vocation 
involved, not to suggest that they are to be adopted. It 
will be seen also that they provide for only eight or ten 
hours per week.

German continuation school courses. — The following 
two courses are those in use in the continuation schools of 
Munich, Germany, as reported by Professor Hanus (School 
Review, 13, pp. 681-2). Relative to the item of religion, 
Professor Hanus remarks that it is taught perfunctorily 
by the priests or pastors of neighboring churches and, in 
his estimation, the instruction could be given much more 
effectively in the churches.

SOME SOCIALIZED PROGRAMMES 295 
I present this suggested programme as a sample of the ear- 
nest efforts being put forth to better our present schools 
by the introduction of the vocational element. It appears 
to be a very valuable contribution towards reconstructing 
the programme. Two remarks may be made about it: First, 
it is suited chiefly to industrial regions, making little or no 
provision for commercial, agricultural, or other non-indus- 
trial elements of the population. It is a vocational course 
of the industrial kind. Second, some of the informational 
subjects which accompany the vocational element and in 
content are directed toward it would have to be filled with 
a somewhat different subject-matter, were any other than an 
industrial community contemplated. 
Course of study for rural schools. —The following out- 
line may be taken as suggestive of what socialized education 
would be for agricultural communities. Only the chief 
topics are included, since the purpose is to indicate broadly 
what elements should enter, not to enumerate in a detailed 
manner all that should be given. It would be the business of 
instructors to choose out of the various sciences only those 
portions which would be necessary to impart the essentials 
in each given item. 
I. Tools of knowledge. To be made agents as soon as 
possible in actual attainment of information. 
II. Vocational knowledge of the agricultural sort. 
(x) Chemistry of the soil — especially for boys. 
(2) Chemistry of foods —especially for girls. 
(3) Mechanical principles and care of tools. Principles 
of levers, pulleys, etc., involved in farm machinery. Simple 
carpentry, cabinet making, and blacksmithing for purposes 
of building and repairing. For boys.
-P-A-G-E-304
296 METHODS OF SOCIALIZING EDUCATION 
(4) Domestic economy, housekeeping and floriculture. 
For girls. 
(5) Plant culture and horticulture; for boys chiefly. 
(6) Animal culture. 
(7) Use of products and by-products. 
(8) Relation to markets, use of market reports, etc. 
(9) Methods of codperating with government agricultural 
department. Use of government reports. 
(10) Drainage and sanitation of rural regions. 
III. Socialized geography as developed in this volume, 
page 281. 
IV. Social studies. 
(1) Brief history of the development of our industrial and 
political institutions, with emphasis on present conditions. 
(2) Elementary civics, with emphasis on concrete local 
government, to show the rights and duties of citizenship. 
Practical ethics developed by means of school and class 
relationships. 
(3) Chief rural community conditions and problems 
looking towards betterment. 
V. Physiology and hygiene of the practical kind previously 
indicated. 
VI. Vocal music; some drawing, looking toward develop- 
ing ability to lay out plans of buildings, of fields, grounds, 
machinery, etc.

EDUCATION THROUGH 
MUSIC 
By CHARLES HUBERT FARNSWORTH, Adjunct 
Professor of Music, Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity. 
      
      
     $1.00 
            HIS book, intended primarily for the grade teacher, is 
at once a rule, a guide, and an inspiration. Its purpose 
is to point out the place of music in the general educa- 
tional scheme; how it correlates with all the other subjects in 
the curriculum and coérdinates them. It demonstrates the 
value of music as a mental training and explains in detail the 
artistic possibilities to which music may rise in any school. 
4 It covers the eight years of elementary schools, the work 
being divided into three distinct groups or phases. Beginning 
with the kindergarten, the work for each school year up to 
and including graduation from the eighth grammar grade, 
is logically and systematically presented. There is a definite 
place and time for everything, and this spells success for the 
grade teacher who is called upon to teach the subject. 
| The plan of the book shows an easy and gradual develop- 
ment. ‘The teacher is never in doubt as to what to teach. 
The work is laid out step by step for each year; and the end 
to be accomplished is plainly indicated. This also spells suc- 
cess. Detailed information is given to the grade teacher 
and to the music supervisor as to the processes of music writ- 
ing, music reading, and song interpretation, and methods of 
presentation applicable to any music course are clearly set forth. 
4] From the beginning to the end, the book is eminently 
practical. While it contains a large amount of detailed in- 
struction for the grade teacher, it also contains an equally large 
amount of descriptive pedagogic text on the presentation of 
music in the school, and thus becomes a valuable text in the 
hands of principals, supervisors, and superintendents.

  EDUCATION IN. THE 
UNITED STATES 
Edited by NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER, President 
of Columbia University, in the City of New York 
$2.50

factorily met in this volume entitled <«Education in the 
United States.”’ 
4] The volume consists of the twenty careful monographs, 
each written by an eminent specialist, on various phases of 
American education, which were originally planned as part 
of the American educational exhibit at the International Ex- 
positions held at Paris in 1900 and at St. Louis in 1904. 
4 The introduction by the editor sets forth the underlying 
principles governing American educational activity to the 
present time. Among the authors of the various monographs 
are: Commissioner Draper of the State of New York, the 
late Dr. William T. Harris, formerly Commissioner of Edu- 
cation of the United States, Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown, 
Dr. Harris’s successor in the Commissionership, Professor 
Edward Delavan Perry of Columbia University, Professor 
Andrew F, West of Princeton University, President M. Carey 
Thomas of Bryn Mawr College, etc., etc.

topics as Educational Organization and Administration, Train- 
ing of Teachers, School Architecture and Hygiene, Profes- 
sional Education, Education of Defectives, and Summer 
Schools and University Extension. 
| For the benefit of teachers, reading circles, and classes in 
universities, colleges and normal schools, each monograph 
will be published separately at 20 cents and will be furnished 
in quantities at $15.00 per hundred (net).

  TEACHING A DISTRICT 
SCHOOL 
By JOHN WIRT DINSMORE, A. M.., Professor of Peda- 
gogy and Dean of the Normal Department, Berea Col- 
lege, Berea, Ky. 
$1.00 
HE special mission of this book is to help the district 
teacher in solving his problems and discharging his duties. 
Tt deals with every phase of school work and every diffi- 
culty which confront the country teacher, and which seem to 
him so disheartening and even insurmountable when he has 
not had the advantage of a normal school training. Each 
problem is treated in a clear, practical manner, and discussed 
in plain, simple language. The book will be particularly 
valuable to young teachers, but it can be read with great 
profit by those of experience. 
4] From beginning to end this volume will be more than a 
help to the teacher; it will be an inspiration. The advice 
given here represents long research, patient investigation, and 
wide experience. It takes into consideration the fact that the 
teacher of the district school is obliged to teach many grades 
and classes, to contend single-handed with innumerable per- 
plexing conditions, and to put up with extremely limited 
facilities ; and furthermore, that he is compelled to rely for 
the solution of these problems almost entirely on his own 
judgment. No one understands better than Professor Dins- 
more how vastly the conditions under which the country 
teacher labors differ from those encountered by the city 
teacher. These vital facts, which are almost wholly ignored 
in present works on pedagogy, are here fully recognized. The 
suggestions are thoroughly sound, and all the chapters will 
well repay reading and re-reading many times. To anyone 
who is studying the problems of teaching and is anxious to 
avoid many errors they will prove of very great assistance.

     OARK’S PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION pre- 
sents such a clear exposition of the elementary princi- 
ples of psychology and their practical applications in 
methods of education as to furnish a logical and scientific 
basis for the daily work in the class room. Intended for the 
average teacher, it gives a full and logical outline by which 
the teacher may guide his study and lays constant emphasis 
upon the necessity and the means of carrying psychology into 
the schoolroom. 
4] In METHOD IN EDUCATION the author develops 
in detail the applications of psychology in the work of 
teaching. He discusses the principles upon which good 
teaching must be based, and also the means of making the 
subjects in the curriculum produce the best educational results. 
Each branch of study usually taught in elementary schools is 
taken up and considered separately, and much hopeful advice 
is given, supplemented by suggestive outlines, lesson plans, 
and topics. 
4] ECONOMY IN EDUCATION deals with the prob- 
lems confronting the individual teacher in the successful ad- 
ministration of his school, and also the larger problems of the 
school as a part of the institutional life and growth of modern 
society. It discusses the problems of the administration of 
school systems and such matters as taxation, boards of 
education, courses of study, and the distinctive work of 
the different schools. The latest movements in the econom- 
ical correlation of the home, libraries, museums, and art 
galleries with the school are taken up at some length.

        Y the safe path of experience and in the light of modern 
psychology the ELEMENTS OF PEDAGOGY 
points out the limitations of the ordinary systems of 
school education and shows how their methods may be har- 
monized and coérdinated. The fundamental principles of 
teaching are expounded in a manner which is both logical 
and convincing, and such a variety and wealth of pedagogical 
principles are presented as are seldom to be found in a single 
text-book. 
{| SCHOOL MANAGEMEN’) discusses school govern- 
ment and moral training from the standpoint of experience, 
observation, and study. Avoiding dogmatism, the author 
carefully states the grounds of his views and suggestions, and 
freely uses the fundamental facts of mental and moral science. 
So practical are the applications of principles, and so apt are 
the concrete illustrations that the book can not fail to be of 
interest and profit to all teachers, whether experienced or 
inexperienced. 
In the ART OF TEACHING the fundamental princi- 
ples are presented in a clear and helpful manner, and after- 
wards applied in methods of teaching that are generic and 
comprehensive. Great pains has been taken to show the 
true functions of special methods and to point out their limita- 
tions, with a view to prevent teachers from accepting them 
as general methods and making them hobbies. ‘The book 
throws a clear light, not only on fundamental methods and 
processes, but also on oral illustrations, book study, class 
instruction and management, written examinations and pro- 
motions of pupils, and other problems of great importance.

HIS volume discusses the applications of the principles 
of economy to the work of the school and other educa-

the individual teacher in the successful administration of his 
school, and also with the larger problems of the school as a 
part of the institutional life and growth of modern society. 
{| The first part presents in new form all that was best in the 
old books on school management, and adds much that is new 
and helpful. In the second part the problems of the adminis- 
tration of school systems are dealt with, and such matters as 
taxation, boards of education, courses of study, and the dis- 
tinctive work of the different schools—elementary, secondary, 
and higher—are discussed. In the third part are described 
the latest movements in the economical correlation ,of all 
the other educational forces of the community—the home,

  THE ART OF STUDY 
By B. A. HINSDALE, Ph. D., LL.D., late Professor 
of the Science and the Art of Teaching, University 
of Michigan. 
$1.00 
‘HIS book for teachers aims at a definite end: To teach 
pupils how to study rather than to store their minds 
with any particular stock of knowledge. 
@] It demonstrates in a clear and logical manner the true 
relations which should exist between the teacher and the 
pupil in the schoolroom, and presents practical methods by 
which such relations may be established and maintained. 
As learning is the primary act, and teaching but secondary, 
it proposes a partial readjustment of the existing relations 
between the teacher and the pupil, by which the pupil will 
become the distinct and proper center of the school system, 
and everything else—teacher, studies, and apparatus—sub- 
ordinate to him. 
4 The art of study is much misunderstood and neglected, 
and there are current today in schools many conditions which 
result in serious defects and weaknesses among pupils. 
Many pupils fail in their studies, due chiefly, first to their 
ignorance of how properly to attack a lesson; and, secondly, 
to their inability to sustain the attack when once begun. It 
too often happens that teachers and pupils do not work 
together in the true spirit; that pupils make too little effort to 
learn, while teachers try, apparently, to save them that 
trouble. To overcome these errors and attain the end sought, 
the author demonstrates the proper relations that should exist 
between them, and then presents methods in establishing and 
maintaining these relations. In illustration of these ideas, a 
series of typical study-recitations is given in the book. 
| The book is rich in practical suggestions for the guidance 
of the teacher, and devotes several chapters to rules and hints 
which will be of great assistance to the pupil as well.

   HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
By LEVI SEELEY, Ph.D., Professor of Pedagogy 
New Jersey State Normal School 
$1.25 
   EELEY’S History of Education is a working book, clear, 
comprehensive, and accurate, and sufficient in itself to 
furnish all the material on the subject that is required by 
any examining board, or that may be demanded in a normal 
or college course. 
4j Each educational system that has influenced the world is 
taken up and summarized in turn, its development shown, 
and its important lesson pointed out. The fullest information 
obtainable is presented in simple form and expressed in con- 
cise language. The topics are arranged on a well defined 
plan, everything being practical, useful, and directly to the 
point. 
| In addition, the book includes biographical sketches of the 
great educators with an illuminating account of their systems 
of pedagogy. It also provides a general outline of the 
educational history of ancient countries, and affords com- 
parisons of the educational systems of the leading countries 
down to the present time. In short, the volume gives the 
student an accurate view in perspective of the educational 
progress of the world. Extensive bibliographies of works for 
reference are provided. 
4] The work presents for study many of the great pedagogical 
problems that have interested thoughtful men in every age. 
It shows how some of these have been solved in the past and 
points out the way to the solution of others of no less 
importance in the near future. 
It should form an indispensable volume in every teacher’s 
library, for it not only is inspiring, but furnishes valuable 
information. Every well informed teacher must know how 
the past has taught in order to cope intelligently with the 
educational problems of today.

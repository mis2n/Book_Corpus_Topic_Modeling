  PREFACE. 
WHILE this book is intended primarily for students of 
Romance Philology, it will, I hope, be of some interest to 
Classical scholars as well. Although it has been long in the 
making, I have endeavored to keep it, at every stage, abreast 
of current scholarship. I have tried, furthermore, to treat all 
portions of the subject, not exhaustively, but with even fulness; 
I fear, however, that the Syntax— perhaps unavoidably — 
is somewhat scanty as compared with the other parts. It will 
be seen that I have continually furnished abundant references 
for the guidance of those who wish to look further into special 
topics. My principal authorities are listed in the Biblio- 
graphy; others are cited in the appropriate places in the text.

AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 
I. The extent of the Roman Empire is shown by the map 
on p. x. Throughout this territory the official language was 
Latin, originally the speech of Latium, a little district on the 
Tiber. The Latin tongue was thus extended to many peoples, 
representing different races, civilizations, and linguistic habits. 
In central Italy it was adopted by Etruscans and by various 
Italic tribes, in northern Italy by Ligurians, Celts, and Illy- 
rians, in southeastern and southwestern Italy respectively by 
Illyrians and Greeks; beyond the peninsula it spread among 
Iberians, Ligurians, Celts, Aquitanians, Semites, Germanic 
tribes, and others still. The Latinization of these peoples 
was the work of several centuries’: by 272 B.c. all Italy 
was subdued south of the Macra and the Rubicon; Sicily 
became a province in 241, Sardinia and Corsica in 238; 
Venetia cast her lot with Rome in 215; Spain was made a 
province in 197; Illyria was absorbed after 167, Africa after 
the fall of Carthage in 146, southern Gaul in 120; the Cim- 
bri and Teutones were destroyed in 102-1; northern Gaul 
was a province in 50, Retia in 15; Dacia was colonized in 
107 A. D., forsaken in the third century, and quite cut off 
from the rest of the Latin-speaking world in the sixth. The 
Latin language never gained a foothold in Greece; political 
changes drove it from Great Britain, the Orient, and Africa; 
in the rest of the Empire it has remained, for the most part,

until the present day, and has been carried thence to Amer- 
ica, Africa, and Asia. The map on p. xi marks the parts of 
Europe where Latin in its modern forms is now spoken. 
2. The Latin tongue, like every living language, has always 
been in an unstable condition. The evidence of inscriptions 
and of grammarians indicates that from the beginning to the 
end of Roman history speech was constantly changing, the 
alteration being most rapid in the earliest and the latest 
periods. Furthermore, there were at all times, but especially 
before the Social War, considerable local divergences. The 
Latin-speaking peoples were not homogeneous, and their 
speech reflected their varied origin. In Italy the language 
of Latium was adopted by tribes using, in the main, kindred 
languages. At first there was sturdy resistance; until the 
conflict of go-89 zB. c. all southern Italy was under Oscan 
influence, and Oscan was used in inscriptions until the first 
century of our era.t| When Latin conquered, it blended more 
or less with the native idioms; the resulting geographical dis- 
crepancies are manifest in early monuments. The Social War, 
however, had a levelling effect, and speech in Italy became 
more uniform; but there doubtless were still noticeable dif- 
ferences in pronunciation and even in vocabulary.” In the 
outlying provinces, and to some degree in the peninsula, 
Latin was simply substituted for foreign tongues, and there 
was little or no mixture; nevertheless a few native words 
were kept, and there must have been a variety of accent. It 
should be remembered, moreover, that the language carried

ni for né, etc. 
2The S. Italian x for nd, ifor 2, and u for 3 may be Oscan. Pomex, élex for 
pimex, ilex are perhaps Umbrian: Lat. Spr. 445, 464. The Italian word zavorra 
is possibly Etruscan: Chronologie 98-99.

to the several provinces was not identical: it represented 
different chronological stages and different local dialects of 
Italic Latin; the earlier acquisitions received a more popular, 
the later colonies a more official speech. Administration and 
military service tended to obliterate distinctions; under the 
Empire the variations probably came to be no greater than 
those now to be found in the English of the British Empire. 
We may say in general that the Roman territory, excepting 
Greece and the East, was completely Latinized by the fourth 
century after Christ. 
3- With the beginnings of culture ard literature there 
came inevitably a divergence between tn language of the 
upper and that of the lower classes, and also between city 
and country speech. Literary influence is conservative and 
refining, while popular usage tends to quick change. In late 
Republican and early Imperial times educated speech became 
highly artificial, drawing away from the everyday language; 
on the other hand, the common idiom, throughout the Re- 
public and the Empire, was constantly developing away from 
the archaic standard of elegant parlance.1 What we call Vul- 
gar Latin is the speech of the middle classes, as it grew out 
of early Classic Latin. It is not an independent offshoot of 
Old Latin: it continues the Classic, not the primitive, vowel 
system.” Neither is it the dialect of the slums or of the 
fields: grammarians tell us of not a few urban and rustic 
vulgarisms that are not perpetuated in the Romance tongues. 
It is distinct from the consciously polite utterance of cul- 
tivated society, from the brogue of the country, and from the 
slang of the lowest quarters of the city, though affected by 
all of these.* Vulgar Latin naturally developed differently in

various localities, as far as the levelling influence or school 
and army permitted ; the universal inclination of language to 
diverge was reinforced by the original habits of the diverse 
speakers and by such peculiarities of native accent as had 
survived. The differentiation progressed, being accelerated 
when schools decayed and military was replaced by ecclesiasti- 
cal organization, until the‘dialects of distant localities became 
mutually unintelligible. At this point we may say that Vulgar 
Latin stops and the Romance languages begin. Although 
any definite date must be arbitrary, we may put it, roughly 
speaking, in the sixth or seventh century of our era. The 
Vulgar Latin period lasts, then, from about 200 B. Cc. to about 
600 A. D.; it is most sharply differentiated from Classic Latin 
in the last few centuries of this epoch.? 
4. If we compare Classic and Vulgar Latin, we shall see 
that the latter was always tending to become more flexible 
and more explicit. We note an enormous development of 
modifying and determining words, such as articles and prepo- 
sitions, and an abundant use of prefixes and suffixes. We 
find also a great simplification of inflections, due partly to 
phonetic but mainly to syntactic causes. Furthermore, we 
observe certain changes in pronunciation, some of which can 
be ascribed to an inclination to discard those parts of words 
that are not necessary for their identification (as when viridis, 
vetulus become virdis, veclus), some to a tendency to assimi- 
late unlike adjacent sounds (so ¢fse is spoken Zsse, and the 
diphthong az is reduced to ¢), some to a desire for differen- 
tiation (which lowers i to e to make it more remote from i), 
some to unknown reasons. Why, for instance, ai almost

universally became e, while au did not in Latin generally 
become 9, is a problem as yet unsolved. 
5. Our sources of information’ concerning the current 
spoken Latin are: the statements of grammarians?; the non- 
Classic forms occurring in inscriptions and early manu- 
scripts®; the occasional lapses in cultivated authors, early 
and late; a few texts written by persons of scanty education ; 
some glossaries and lists of incorrect forms; and, most im- 
portant of all, the subsequent developments of the Romance 
languages.* All of these are to be used with caution. Of 
especial value are the Peregrinatio ad loca sancta, a consider- 
able fragment of a description of travel in the East, by an 
uneducated woman (probably a Spanish nun) of the latter 
part of the fourth century®; the Appendix Probi, a list of 
good and bad forms, possibly as early as the third century * 
the veterinary treatise known as MZilomedicina Chironis" ; the so- 
called Glossary of Reichenau, made in France in the eighth cen- 
tury.® There is an interesting collection of curses by A. Audol- 
lent, — Defixionum Tabelle, 1904.

A. WORDS AND THEIR MEANINGS. 
6. It is natural that the speech of the literary and fashion. 
able classes should differ from that of the common people; so 
it is in all civilized communities. Literature inclines to extend 
the senses of words, popular use tends to restrict them. The 
polite language, too, has many poetic figures and many abstract 
terms unknown to the crowd. On the other hand, the vulgar 
idiom has homely metaphors of its own and numerous specific, 
technical words not found in literature. 
1. WORDS USED ALIKE IN CLASSIC AND VULGAR LATIN. 
7. This class includes a great mass of words, forming, so 
to speak, the nucleus of the language. Examples are: canis, 
jilius, mater, panis, pater, puteus, vacca; altus, bonus, longus, 
viridis; amare, audire, dicere, vendere; bene, male; guando, si; in.

§ 10] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 7 
2. WORDS USED DIFFERENTLY IN CLASSIC AND IN 
VULGAR LATIN. 
8. Very many Classic words are used in Vulgar Latin with 
a different sense: comparare = ‘buy’, focus = ‘fire’, paganus= 
‘pagan’, ‘viaticum = ‘journey’. Capit assumed the meaning 
of fieri potest: R. 351-352, non capit prophetam perire, etc.; 
Hoppe 48, ec estimare non capit, non capit utique videri Deus. 
Most of the examples can be classified under the heads of 
restriction or extension of meaning. 
a. SENSE RESTRICTED. 
9. This happens frequently, a word assuming a more defi- 
_nite or concrete signification: cognatus = ‘brother-in-law’ ; 
collocare = ‘put to bed’ (se collocare =‘ go to bed’, Bon. 286); 
dominicus = divinus; ingenium = ‘trick’, Bon. 283; Jectio= 
‘text’; machinari = ‘grind’; mulier = ‘wife’; necare = ‘drown’, 
Bon. 286, Dubois 220; orbus=‘blind’; ‘ractatus = ‘treatise’. 
Many words kept their literal but lost their metaphorical 
sense: captio=‘act of taking’, G. 243, not ‘sophism’ nor 
‘deceit’; vobur = ‘oak’, not ‘strength’, ‘authority’, nor ‘best 
part’. 
b. SENSE EXTENDED." 
10. The general use of a word in an extended sense is not 
common, but there are some examples: fortis = ‘strong’ in all 
senses, Bayard 105; imfans = ‘child’, Pirson 257-258; parentes 
= ‘relatives’, Pirson 260-262; se plicare =‘go’, Per. 46,1, 
etc.; vil/a = ‘town’, G. 272. 
Many words, however, assume a new meaning in addition 
to the old one: ambulare= ‘march’, Archiv XII, 269-270, 
Bechtel 137, etc., and also ‘continue’, Regnier 24, perhaps 
  
Cf. Bayard 63-202, Bon. 235-328, Dubois 185-225, Quillacq 54-79.  
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 Aw Intropuction To VuLGAR LaTIN. ($m 
‘go’; facere =‘ pass (time)’, Regnier 27 (guadraginta dies fecit), 
Per. 66, x (fecimus ibi biduum), etc.; fascia means a measure 
of land, Pirson 255; abet is used like the French 7 y a 
(Old French a), G. 422 (in arca Noe... habuit serpentes), 
Regnier 29 (in carne paucas habet virgines sanctimoniales), 
Bechtel 127 (Aabebat de eo loco forsitan quattuor milia, etc.), 
Pr, 37,13, etc.; homo has the sense of French oz, Regnier 20, 
Dubois 218; 7//e= ‘the’ and ‘he’, Bechtel 144, Bon. 258 ff.; 
Populus minutus =*common people’, Waters Ch. 44; replicare= 
‘reply’, Dubois, 204; ves is used of persons, Waters Ch. 58 
(bella res); satis = ‘much’, Bayard 83, Per. 38,25, etc.; unus = 
‘a’, Bechtel 144; vértutes = ‘miracles’ (in imitation of the 
Greek), Bayard 94. 
So various prepositions and conjunctions (as ad, apud, cum, © 
de, per, and guasi, guia, guod, guomodo) assumed new functions. 
Unde came to mean ‘and so’, Bon. 328. 
3. WORDS USED IN CLASSIC BUT NOT IN VULGAR LATIN. 
11. Numerous Classic Latin words either were not em- 
ployed at all in the vulgar speech or went out of use before 
the earliest monuments of the Romance languages: so funus, 
jubere, proles. Nery many adverbs and conjunctions dis- 
appeared: an, at, autem, diu, donec, enim, ergo, etiam, haud, 
igitur, ita, nam, postquam, quidem, quin, quippe, guoad, guogue, 
saltem, sed, sive, ut, utrum, vel, etc.; tamen must have been 
moribund, although it is common in the Peregrinatio. Poetic 
terms and some abstract nouns were not needed: aurora, 
Jrondifer, horrescere, fletus. Ecclesiastical Latin, to be sure, is 
very rich in abstract nouns (G. 391-397, Dubois 301-308), 
but most of them are new formations. When lost terms were 
needed for literary or other purposes, they were either bor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
§ 13] Aw InrRopuction To VuLcar LatIN. 9 
rowed from Classic or clerical Latin (as wodilis) or replaced 
by new constructions (as *carrica for onus). 
a. SYNONYMS. 
12. When Latin had two words nearly synonymous, one 
often crowded out the other: a/rium gave way to cors; cur to 
quare; equus to caballus, R. 472; ferre to portare, Dubois 220; 
ludus to jocus; magnus to grandis; os to bucca, R. 472; parentes 
to genitores, Olcott XXV; senex to vetulus. 
Sometimes the survivor was far from a synonym in Classic 
Latin: discere was displaced by apprendere; domus by casa, 
mansio, hospitale’; emere by comparare; humerus by spatula, 
R. 324; égnis by focus, R. 313; nunc by hora; omnes by toli, 
R. 338, Zs. XXXIII, 143 ; quot, tot by quanti, tanti, R. 336, 337; 
urbs by civitas, Dubois 209, and by villa, G. 272. 
b. SUBSTITUTES. 
13. Sometimes a term was replaced by a word not found in 
Classic Latin at all: @wser was driven out by *auca (< *avica, 
diminutive of avis); noverca by *matraster; privignus by *filias- 
ter; vitricus mostly by patraster. Occasionally the substitute 
was apparently a slang word: adiguis yielded in part to res 
nata, R. 345; caput to lesta®; crus gave way to gamba, edere in 
the main to manducare, Bechtel 140; gena to gabata. 
Some words were replaced by diminutives, some nouns by 
derivative adjectives: avis by aucellus; avus by * aviolus; sol 
  
1 According to Olcott XVIII, casa occurs only in Italian inscriptions, mansio (= 
‘ dwelling’) only in Roman. For mansio, cf. R. 472, Dubois 212. Among the Ro- 
mance languages, Rumanian, Reetian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese prefer casa, French 
and Provencal mansio and hospitale. Cf. Zauner 41-42. 
® Caput (or rather * capwm) is preserved by Rumanian, Retian, Italian, Provengal, 
French ; festa by Italian, Provengal, French; *capitia (< caput) by Spanish and 
Portuguese. Cf. Zauner 41-42.  
-P-A-G-E-28
  io An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. (s 15 
in part by *soliculus; vetus for most part by vetulus, dies largely 
by diurnus, Gl. Reich. ; hiems by hibernum, R. 472; mane exten- 
sively by matutinum. Diminutives were extremely common 
in late Latin: G. 121-130 (cereolus, schedula, etc.), Olcott 
250-263 (semelli, mammula=‘ grandmother’, xaucel/a, neptilla, 
etc.), Dubois 147 (zovell/us). Adjectives used as nouns were 
frequent also: R. 100-107 (avida, infernus, etc.), G. 108-121 
(brevis, credens, infernus, etc.). 
Occasionally, too, words were replaced by phrases: diu by 
longum tenipus (Bon. 201, paucum tempus for haud diu); ver 
by vernum tempus, Bon. 203, and other phrases. 
c. PARTICLES. 
14. Many prepositions, conjunctions, and adverbs were lost 
by subsitution. 
Ab was made unnecessary by de and fer; apud was partially 
supplanted by ad; cum, in Gaul, yielded to apud; ex gave way 
to de, R. 395-396; 0d to pro and per. Pro, doubtless under 
the influence of fer, became *Zor, which replaced fer and pro 
in Spain and to a considerable extent in northern Gaul; 
southern Gaul, Italy, and Dacia preferred per. Cis, erga, pre, 
propter were displaced by other words. 
The functions of am, ne, utrum were assumed by sé; the 
place of cum was taken by guando and other conjunctions; 
quando, quod, quoniam were often replaced by guomodo, R. 403. 
Autem, ergo, etiam, etsi, igitur, sed, tamen, ut were ousted by 
various substitutes. Cf. Densusianu, 184-185. 
4. WORDS USED IN VULGAR BUT NOT IN CLASSIC LATIN. 
15. Vulgar Latin evidently had many wordsthat do not 
appear in Classic texts. Some of these were probably old
-P-A-G-E-29
  
§ 17] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. II 
native terms that do not happen to occur in the works pre- 
served, some were late creations, some were borrowed from 
other languages. 
a. NATIVE WORDS. 
16. Some native words are rarely attested, although they 
were doubtless in common use: amma, Archiv XIII, 154; 
atta, Archiv XIII, 154; baro = ‘athlete’, Waters Ch. 53, Ch. 
63; battalia, Archiv XII, 270-271; branca, Densusianu 196; 
circare = ‘hunt’, Archiv VIII, 186; cloppus, Densusianu 196; 
drappus, Substrate 11, 106, Korting (found in the 6th century); 
Jicatum, Densusianu 190; gavia (used by Pliny); mamma, 
Archiv XIII, 151-152; nonna, nonnus, Archiv XIII, 156-157; 
pa(p)pa, Archiv XIII, 158, Bayard 179 (applied by St. Cyprian 
to the bishop of Carthage); pappus = ‘grandfather’, Pirson 
243; serutinus, Audollent 199; ‘tata, fatus, Pirson 244, Archiv 
XIII, 151-153; “repalium, Rom, XVII, 421. 
17. A few that must have existed are not attested at all: 
*refusare, Substrate V, 234; *retina = ‘rein’, Substrate V, 237; 
so not improbably the original of the Romance words mean- 
ing ‘touch’, and perhaps those of the words meaning ‘find’, 
‘gape’, and ‘go’ (cf. § 405). Likewise words made by ono- 
matopea, as *miaulare; cf. M. Grammont, Onomatopées et 
mots expressifs in Revue des langues romanes XLIV, 97. 
Some of the unattested words were obviously late develop- 
ments: * finds, adj. (Fr., Pr. fim; It. fine fino), from the noun 
finis in such phrases as honorum finis, pudoris finis, etc. (so, 
e.g., finis honoris > fins onors, etc.), E. Herzog in Bausteine 
484; *gentis, adj. (Fr., Pr. gens, It. gente), apparently a cross 
between genitus and gentilis; prode, then m. and f. *frodis, 
adj., detached from prodest (cf. potis est = potest, Neue II, 
176-177), R. 468-469 (guid enim prode est homini, sed non 
Suit prode illis, hoc enim prode fit vobis, etc.).

18. Late Latin was rich in derivatives, some of popular 
creation, some made by Christian writers. According to 
Olcott XIX, African Latin was freest in word formation. 
This subject will be discussed at length in the following 
chapter, but a few examples may be given here: post-verbal 
dolus < dolere, Regnier VIII; *abbellire; *ausare; carricare, 
Gl. Reich.; confessor = ‘martyr’; *coraticum; dulcor, * dulcior 
= ‘sweetness’; follia; *man(u)aria; modernus, Dubois 144; 
*nivicare; * soliculus; vict(u)alia; * vir(i)dura. 
b. FOREIGN WORDS. 
19. A few Celtic terms were adopted, such as a/auda, 
vertragus. More Germanic words (cf. Gram., Introduction) 
found their way into Latin: dannus, Bon. 226; hapja; hariber- 
gum, Gl. Reich, (cf. alberca, Pirson 236); haunjan; watan; 
werra. 
We find a large number of Greek words, a few of them 
apparently borrowed by popular speech: amygdalum; cata, a 
distributive preposition, verging on the sense of ‘every’, R. 
247 (cata mane mane), Bechtel 95 (cata mansiones, cata 
pascha), cf. §71; colaphus; dactylus, Bon. 211; sagma, More 
came in through the Christian vocabulary: angelus; baptizare; 
blasphemare; etc. Some were introduced by fashionable 
society, which affected familiarity with Greek; there are many 
Greek words in Petronius: Aepatia, Waters Ch. 66; schema, 
Waters Ch. 44. 
Very many Greek terms used by ecclesiastical writers never 
became popular. Cf. G. 205-226: anathema, prophetare, zelare; 
numerous verbs in —zzare, as allegorizare, anathematizare, catechi- 
sare, colaphizare, evangelizare, eunuchizare, Judaizare, propheti- 
sare, sabbatizare, scandalizare, thesaurizare; and not a few new 
derivatives, as baptizatio, diaconissa, G. 225, 224.

20. Vulgar Latin is very rich in derivatives and com- 
pounds; it has many affectionate diminutives, some of them 
made with new suffixes (as —cca, -itta).1_ Petronius shows a 
fondness for long derivatives, such as gaudimonium (Waters 
Ch. 61). Late writings almost all abound in abstract nouns 
(Cooper 1-2). In strictly Classic texts there seem to be few 
really living suffixes *; but the facility of word formation, which 
the literary language lost, popular speech preserved and in- 
creased.’ This freedom of formation was abused by African 
authors, who were especially addicted to prepositional com- 
pounds with con-, in—, sub—, etc. We shall consider first post- 
verbal nouns (i.e., substantives taken from the roots of verbs), 
then prefixes, next suffixes, and finally composite words. 
1. POST-VERBAL NOUNS. 
21. After the model of cantus —cantare, saltus —saltare, 
etc. (pairs in which the derivative verb seemed to come from 
the noun, whereas in reality both come from a primitive verb, 
as canere, salire), a fictitious primitive noun was derived from 
a number of verbs in Vulgar Latin and in the Romance lan- 
guages: so dolus from dolere, Vok. I, 35, 98, Bon. 367, Regnier 
VII (blamed by St. Augustine). 
2. PREFIXES.® 
a. PREFIXES USED WITH NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, AND PRONOUNS. 
22. Bis—or bi— was used with some adjectives and appar- 
ently with a few nouns: dimaritus, G. 130; bisacutus, G. 170; 
bisaccium, Petronius.

23. Ad-, con-, de-, dis—, ex-, in—, re~ and some others were 
occasionally used to form adjectives: *adaptus ; commixtius, 
G. 160; defamatus ; *disfactus ; exsicus; inanimatus ; *replenus. 
Cf. G. 160 ff. 
24. Ac-, atque-, ecce—, eccu—, met- were used as demonstrative 
prefixes to pronominal adjectives and to adverbs. LZecu— is 
eccum, i.e., ecce hum; its origin being forgotten, it was used in 
late Vulgar Latin as a synonym of ecce. Met, primarily a 
suffix, came to be used as a prefix through such combinations 
as semet ipsum, understood as se metipsum. In archaic writings 
such reinforced demonstratives as eccum, eccam, eccos, eccas, 
ecca, eccillum, eccillam, eccillud, eccistam are not uncommon ; in 
Classic texts they are rare. Vulgar Latin examples are: ac 
sic; atgue ille; ecce hic; * eccu iste; *eccu sic, Substrate VI, 
385; met ipse. Cf. A. Kohler, Die Partikel ecce in Archiv V, 
16. See §§ 65, 66. 
b. PREFIXES USED WITH VERBS. 
25. Ad-, con-, de-, dis—, ex-, in—, re— were freely used, dis— 
being mainly a Vulgar Latin prefix: abbreviare, G. 179; * ad- 
cap(t)tare; adgenuculari, R. 181; adpretiare, R. 181, G. 180° 
adpropiare, R. 181, G. 180; adunare, R. 182; confortare, R. 185, 
G. 181; *cominitiare; complacere, R. 184; deaurare, G. 182; 
*disjejunare; exaltare, G. 183; excoriare, G. 182; impinguare, 
G. 183; *infurcare; recapitulare, G. 185; *reguerere. Ad-, 
con—, de— lost their special significance; ad— was particularly 
favored in Spain, con—in Italy. Cf. Lat Spr. 487. Occasion- 
ally there was a change of prefix: aspectare was used with the 
sense of exfectare, * convitare sometimes took the place of zzvz- 
tare; dis— was often substituted for ex-. 
26. Ab-, contra-, per-, sub-, super supra-, tra trans— were
-P-A-G-E-33
  § 31] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. I5 
used occasionally: * adoculare ; *contrafacere ; *perdonare; sub- 
audire, G. 185; *subcludere; subsannare, R. 199, G. 187; 
superabundare, G. 187; *super—*suprafacere ; *trabuccare; *trans- 
annare; transplantare, G. 188. 
27. Lxtra— was sometimes used in Italy and Dacia, infra— 
and éntra—in Italy: *extrabuccare ; * infraponere; *intratenere. 
28. Abs-, e-, ob-, pre-, pre-, pro-, retro— were apparently 
not used to form new verbs in the popular spoken language, 
although some of them are occasionally so employed by late 
witers: ofprobrare, G. 184; predestinare, G. 184 (cf. Livy); 
prolongare, G. 184. Ob-— is sometimes replaced by ad—: 06- 
dormire > addormire. 
29. Foris and minus came to be used as prefixes in some 
regions: *forisfacere; * minuscredere. Foris was confounded 
in Gaul with the Frankish f— (= ver—): verslahen = Old Fr. 
forbatre. See G. Baist, Frinkisches fir— im dltesten Franzisi- 
schen in Romanische Forschungen XII, 650; cf. Rom. XXX, 
633. For this use of ménus, compare the phrase minus est= 
deest, Regnier 109: caritas in quantum adest...in guantum 
autem minus est. Cf. § 245. 
30. Some verbs take a double prefix: adimplere; coexcitare, 
R. 207 (cf. Quintilian, coexercitatus); deexacerbare, R. 207; 
* deexcitare,; * exeligere. 
31. Recomposition, i.e., the restoration of the full form of 
the primitive verb, was a regular process in Vulgar Latin (cf. 
§139): aspargo for aspergo is blamed by Velius Longus, Edon 
127, and is used by St. Cyprian, Bayard 3; commando is, ac- 
cording to Velius Longus, the usual form, rather than commendo, 
S. 60, Edon 131; consacrati etc. occur in inscriptions, S. 60; 
crededit, Bon. 490; vreddedit, Bon. 490; retenere, Bon. 489; 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  16 An IntRopucTiIon To VuuLcaR LarTIN. [§ 33 
tradedit, Bon. 490. Cf. S. 58-64, Bon. 486-493. Cémpiito, 
cblligo, céllico, cénsto, cénstio, érigo, éxto, inflo, présto seem to 
have been regarded as simple verbs: S. 64. 
32. Late writers were in the habit of restoring the full, 
primitive form of prefixes; but this was doubtless merely a 
matter of spelling, and did not indicate the common pronun- 
ciation. In Tertullian, Cyprian, and some others there is 
generally no assimilation of the prefix; other writers, such as 
Gregory of Tours, apparently used both assimilated and un- 
assimilated forms. Bayard 12-15: adpetere, conpendium, in- 
probus, obfero, subplanto. Bon. 178-188: adtonitus, conmittere, 
inlatus, obprimere, subcumbere. i 
3. SUFFIXES. 
a. SUFFIXES FOR VERBS." 
33. Verbs from nouns* generally end in —ave; occasionally 
in —dare or —ire; sometimes in —écare, which was eventually sup- 
planted in Italy and in Gaul by —ézave (for pronunciation see 
§339). This last ending came from Greek ew through bor- 
rowed words, such as daftizare. For a list of Greek verbs in 
-ew adopted by Christian writers, see R. 248-249 (cf. §19 
above); some new formations were used, as cavechizare. In 
early Latin this same ending appears as —ssare (atticisso, 
rhetorisso): see A. Funck, Die Verba auf issare und izare in 
Archiv III, 398. 
Examples: oculare; pectinare; plantare; potionare; * trepa- 
“are ; — plagiare ; —ignire; — carricare; follicare; *nivicare ; 
—* dom’ nizare; * werrizare.

Cf. R. 154-162.

34. Verbs from adjectives and perfect participles end in —are, 
tare, -ire; also in —icare (cf. albicare), --itare (cf. debilitare, 
visitare), —éscere and —iscere (cf. canescere, mollescere); possibly 
in -izare: angustare; *ausare; captivare; confortare; falsare; 
gravare; levare; * oblitare; riitare; usare; —alleviare; *al 
tiare; *captiare; humiliare; —* abbellire; unire ; —amari 
care; —* vanitare ; —fortescere ; letiscere; vilescere ; —*blan- 
kizare ? 
Many verbs from perfect participles (frequentatives, etc.) 
replace the original verbs: adjuvare > adjutare; audere>au- 
sare; canere> cantare; uti>usare. The endings —(7) ¢are, -escere 
lost their frequentative or inchoative sense: adparescere, Dubois 
157; ostentare, Dubois 156. 
35. Verbs from other verbs end in -icare (cf. fodicare< 
Sodere), —itare (cf. clamitare <clamare); also in —éscere, —iscere 
(cf. florescere, dormiscere), which lost its inchoative force: 
* bullicare < bullire ; — crocitare ; — apparescere; * finiscere; 
stupescere. “Vulgar Latin has many old frequentive verbs: G. 
178-179, Cooper 205. There are some late diminutives in 
-aculare, —iculare, —uculare, through diminutive nouns or adjec- 
tives (cf. periculari < periculum): * salticulare. We find also 
some miscellaneous imitative formations: * expaventare (and 
some others) apparently after the analogy of presentare ; 
* misculare perhaps after macu/are. 
36. Greek verbs in —Gv, —ew, etc., when taken into Latin, reg- 
ularly end in —ave-: xvBepvav>gubernare; Bdrardypelv > blas- 
phemare. Cf. Claussen 795. But WadrdAav>fpsallére, perhaps 
through the analogy of fa//ere: Claussen 796. 
Germanic verbs in -an or —on regularly passed into the first 
conjugation in Latin: witan> It. guidare: roubin> It. rubare. 
Those in -yan went into the fourth: hatjan>hatire, Gi. 
Reich.; warnjan> it. guarnire.

b. SUFFIXES FOR NOUNS.* 
37. Some go endings, apparently, were used in Vulgar 
Latin. The Christian writers are especially rich in deriva- 
tives. Petronius, too, was very fond of diminutives: adules- 
centulus, Waters Ch. 59, Ch. 64; porcellus, Ch. 40; taurellus, 
Ghie39. 
The commonest endings are the following: — 
-a, used to form feminines: weffa, Pirson 123, Bon. 366, Haag 41; 
socera, Bon. 355. 
—dgo, —igo, —iigo were characteristic of rustic speech: Cooper 111. 
—al, —ale, used to form adjectives and also nouns, especially names of 
parts of apparel (as dracchiale), was extended: coxale, G.95. Cf. Olcott 
238-239. 
-alia, a neuter plural, as victwalia (cf. the collective plural —z/7a, as 
mirabilia, volatilia, G. 110-111), was used, in a collective sense, as a 
feminine singular with an augmentative and pejorative signification, in 
Italy and Gaul: *canalia < canis. 
-anda, ~enda, neuter plural of the gerundive, came to be used as a 
feminine singular: *facienda and *facenda. 
-ans, ens; see Adjectives. 
-antia, —entia, made from present participles + -éa (as benevolentia, 
essentia, significantia), were used to form abstract nouns from verbs: 
*credentia; fragrantia ; placentia; *sperantia. Cf. R. 49-52, G. 79-102, 
Olcott 73-78. 
-dnus: see Adjectives. 
-ar, —Gre, for nouns and adjectives: liminare, G. 95; *follicare. Cf. 
Olcott 187-189. 
-aria: see —ia, 
-arium, used to designate a place (as gallinarium), was extended: 
breviarium ; *calamarium. Cf. R. 31-37, Olcott 176-182. 
-arius: see Adjectives. 
-aster: see Modern Language Notes XXIV, 240. 
-ata: see —fa, etc, [cum. 
-aticum (as viaticum) was extended, to form nouns from nouns: *corati- 
—dtus, as senatus (common in Petronius, e. g., donatus, Waters Ch. 74), 
was extended: clericatus; *ducatus. Cf. -ta, etc.

-cellus, diminutive, was used beside -culus: avicula, avicella; navi 
cula, navicella. So *domnicellus, etc. 
—ceus, -cius: see Adjectives. 
-culum, -crum (as miraculum, lavacrum) were occasionally used: 
*genuculum. Cf. G. 91-92, Olcott 131-134. 
-ellus, diminutive (as castellum), was often used beside -2/us, which 
lost its diminutive force: anulus, anellus; porculus, porcellus; vitulus, 
vitellus. So calamellus, etc. 
-enda: see —anda. 
-ens: see Adjectives, —ans. 
-ensis: see Adjectives. 
—entia: see —antia. 
—trium, as desiderium, was probably somewhat extended: Old Fr., Pr. 
consirier, etc. Cf. R. 31-37. See A. Thomas, Les substantifs en —ier et le 
suffixe -arius, Rom. XXXI1, 481; and Mouveaux essais de philologie fran- 
gaise 110, 
eum: see -ium. 
-eus; see Adjectives. 
-ia, unaccented, used to form abstract nouns (as victoria), was 
extended: *fortia (cf. fortia n. pl. = ‘mighty deeds of God’, Koff. 
mane 76). 
-ta, unaccented, used to form feminines (as avus, avia): neptia, Pir- 
son 123 (cf. Zs. XXXII, 640), 
-ta, from Greek -fa through Christian writers and speakers: monar- 
chia; philosophia; etc. It was often attached to words in -arius; hence 
an ending -arfa: *libraria. Cf. Olcott 173-176. 
-ica: see Archiv fiir das Studium der neueren Sprachen und Litera- 
turen CXIV, 457. 
-icca (as Bodicca, Bonica, Karica) first appears in Africa in feminine 
proper names; it was then extended to Spain, Sardinia, and Dacia, and 
came to be used as a diminutive suffix in Spanish, Portuguese, and Ru- 
manian: Sp. animalico; Rum. manicé. It may have arisen in the first 
place from a childish pronunciation of —ic/us, -ic/a, being used in pet 
names. Cf. Zinf.§173. For —accus, -iccus, -occus, -uc(c)us, see A. Horn- 
ing in Zs. XIX, 170, XX, 335; cf. Gram. II, 591. Cf. Zs. XXXIV, 26. 
-iceus, -icius: see Adjectives, —ceus. 
—incus or —inguus (as propinguus), perhaps also *-ingus and locally 
-ancus, possibly of Ligurian origin (Rom. XX XV, 1-21, 283ff., 333ff.), was 
used for many new words: Pr. Arbonenca, ramenc; It. solingo, Valinca;
-P-A-G-E-38

Sp. Cusanca. It was probably confounded, in some regions, with the 
following. 
-ing, a German patronymic ending, was used for some nouns and per- 
haps for adjectives (see —izcus above): Pr. ausenga; It. camerlingo. 
~inus (as caninus, Montaninus) originally denoted appurtenance, then 
resemblance, then smallness; it was freely used, especially to form 
diminutive nouns, but sometimes to form new adjectives: domnina = 
‘young lady’, Olcott 134-136; Florentinus; serpentinus. Cf. Olcott 
200-204. 
—to: see —tio. 
-issa, from the Greek -w0a (as Baciuooa, so pythonissa), was used for 
some new formations: *dukissa; Germanissa, Pirson 228; prophetissa, 
R. 251. Cf£. Cooper 251. 
—itas: see -tas. 
—itia, -ities, used to form nouns from adjectives (as munditia ies), were 
much extended, ~i#es especially in the south; both are rare in Rumanian 
(Cooper XLV): *altitia; *granditia. Cf. Olcott 78-80. 
~ittus first appears during the Empire in inscriptions in Italy and 
Dacia, sometimes in Spain and Gaul, as a suffix for proper names: 
feminine Adtitta, Bonitta, Caritta, Julitta, Livitta, Suavitta, etc.; masculine 
Muritta, Nebitta, Sagitta, etc. Cf. Pirson 226: Julianeta, Nonnita, Nonni- 
tus. Its origin is unknown; it may have arisen from a childish pronun- 
ciation of -tclus -a: cf.-icca. Meyer-Liibke, Zinf. § 172, conjectures that 
it may have come from the Germanic ending that now appears as z in 
such names as Heinz. A. Zimmermann, Zs. XXVIII, 343, regards —ditus, 
-tttus, -ttus as alternative forms of —dtus, -itus, -dtus, like littera beside 
litera, etc. It came to be very widely used as a diminutive suffix for 
nouns, and also for adjectives, the 7 being short in Gaul, Retia, and cen- 
tral and northern Italy, generally long in the Spanish peninsula and in 
Sardinia: nouns, Fr. amourette, It. fioretto, Sp. bacito; adjectives, Fr. 
doucet, It. grassetto, Sp. bonito. 
-itiido: see -tido. 
-ium, —eum (as capitium, calcaneum): see G. 56-59. 
-ivum, -iva: see Olcott 224-226. 
—men, —mentum, used to form nouns from verbs (as certdmen, vestimen- 
tum), were extended, especially —mentum: *gubernamentum. Cf. Olcott 
123-131, R. 22-25. 
—ménium, —monia: see Olcott 81-82. 
-o (-dnem), originally used to indicate a characteristic (as dio), was
-P-A-G-E-39
  § 37) An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 2 
commonly employed as an augmentative or pejorative, in Gaul often as a 
diminutive: glo; It. boccone; Fr. aiglon. See Archiv V, 56, 223, XIII. 
222, 415, 475. Cf. Olcott 83-87, G. 44-45. : 
-or (-drem), used to form abstract nouns (as candor, sapor), was em- 
ployed for many new formations of the same kind, especially in Gaul: 
dulcor; *flator; * flavor; *licor ; *sentor; viror. In Gaul these nouns 
came to be feminine: Bon. 503-504 (dolor, timor, etc.). 
-or (-drem), used to designate the agent: see —for. 
—Orium ;. see —torium. 
—dttus, of unknown origin (cf. -i#tus), was apparently used first of young 
animals, then as a general moderate diminutive: It. aguslotto, casotta. 
-sa: see —ta, etc. 
: see —tio, 
  si 
sor: see -tor. 
—sdrium: see —torium, 
—stira: see —ira. 
—sus: see —ia, etc. 
-ta, —tus, -sa, ~sus, later —dta, -dtus, —uta, perfect participles used as 
nouns, started perhaps with such forms as defensa, remissa, i. e., feminine 
perfect participles with a feminine noun understood, and were reinforced 
by neuter plural forms which became feminine and also by fourth declension 
nouns in —tws,as collectus, narratus: cf.C. Collinin Archiv XIII, 453; L. H. 
Alexander, Participial Substantives of the -ata type in the Romance Languages, 
1912. They were considerably used to make abstract nouns from verbs (and 
-ata was sometimes attached to nouns, as *aza‘a); -tus and —sus were pre- 
ferred in Dacia (Cooper XLV): collecta, G. 111; *debita ; extensa, R. 83; *mo- 
vita, Substrate IV, 122; *perdita ; recubitus ; *reddita ; * vendita; It. andata, 
Sossato, venuta. C£. Olcott 33-51, R. 82-83, G. 85-88, Bayard 24~25. 
tas (-tdtem), used to make abstract nouns from adjectives, was freely 
employed: falsitas ; nativitas ; purttas ; trinitas. So deitas from deus. Cf. 
Olcott 58-69, G. 102-106, Bayard 19-22 (very common in St. Cyprian). 
tio, -sic (-tionem, —sidnem), used to form abstract nouns from verbs (as 
lectio, mansio, potio), are very common in St. Jerome, St. Cyprian, and 
other late writers: abbreviatio; aggravatio, G. 63; *nutritio; ostensio 
prensio; revolutio. Cf. Olcott 2-23, R. 69-82, Bayard 19-22. 
tor, -trix, —sor (-torem, -tricem, -sdrem), used to denote the agent (a. 
amdtor, mensor), were very freely employed (but show few traces in Ru- 
manian: Cooper XLV): ecdtor ; ostensor ; Pr. beveire, trobaire. Cf. Olcott 
88-122, R. 55-63, G. 45-56. 
—torium, -sdrium, used to form from verbs nouns denoting place, some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 Aw InrRopucTion To VuLcaR LatIN. [s 38 
times instrument (as dormitorium, natatorium, cursorium), were much ex- 
tended, often taking the place of —culum (cubiculum > accubitorium) : 
*casorium; mensorium; missorium; oratorium; * ‘pressorium ; reposito- 
rium. Cf. Olcott 194-196, R. 31-37, G. 96-97. 
-tido (-tiidinem), used to make abstract nouns from adjectives (as 
fortitudo), was extended: *certitudo; servitude. Cf. Olcott 69-73. 
—liira: see -tira, ‘ 
—tus: see —ta, etc. 
—tilus, -itla, diminutive (as vitulus), was used for a few new formations: 
*alaudula; ossulum, Bon. 197. 
-tira and —t-iira, -s—iira, used to form abstract nouns from perfect par- 
ticiples (as censura, strictura), later from adjectives also, were extended, 
in late Latin often replacing -or (fervor > *fervura): * frig’dura; mes- 
sura; nutritura; ornatura; *planura; pressura; tensura; *vir'dura. See 
Linf.§ 171. C£. Olcott 51-58, R. 40-45, G. 88-go. 
-iita; see —ta, etc. 
38. When Greek nouns were borrowed by Latin, the 
endings were adapted as follows: — 
0s, —n, —ov regularly became respectively —ws, -a, -um: Claussen 796. 
There are a few exceptions for special reasons (Claussen 795): @Aavoy, in- 
fluenced by olere, gave oleum; wnXdpudov, by popular etymology, gave 
millefolium. 
~as in popular words generally became —a (Claussen 798-799): Aaymrds 
> lampa. 
—ns, -Tns became —a, —ta or —us, —tus (Claussen 798): TpwKrns > tructa ; 
Bwrirns > boletus. 
-cin popular words either fell or became —a, -e, -és, or -i (Claussen 799): 
aérep> piper; clvamt> sinapis, sinape; Kbuju>gumma, gummi-s. 
-ts often became ~a, instead of —is (Claussen 798): pawsis > pausa. 
-wa in popular words gave a feminine —ma (Claussen 796-797): «Oya > 
cima. 
—pos preceded by a consonant became ~ev (Claussen 797): ‘ANéfavdpos > 
Alexander. ‘ 
-wy in popular words became ~o (Claussen 797): \éwv > leo. 
Sometimes the genitive or the accusative was taken as a basis, instead 
of the nominative (Claussen 800-802): éhépavros > elephanius ; parylia > 
magida. 
   
-P-A-G-E-41
  § 30] An IntTRopuCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 23 
The unaccented vowel of the penult was often changed in conformity 
with Latin habits (Claussen 802-806) : 5idBodos > diabolus diabulus ; Képacos 
> cerdsus *cerésus; xibdpa> cithira cithéra; oxbmedos> scopulus ; onarddn 
> spatula. 
c. SUFFIXES FOR ADJECTIVES." 
39- The commonest endings are the following: — 
—abilis: see —dilis. 
—dceus —Gcius, -tceus -icius, used to make from nouns adjectives denot- 
ing material (as arenaceus, pelliceus), were extended (especially in rustic 
speech: Cooper 111), -acews being employed later as an augmentative 
and pejorative suffix for adjectives and finally for nouns: chartaceus; 
formaceus; mixticius, G. 143; *setaceus; It. tempaccio, etc. Cf. Olcott 
215-220. See E. Wolfflin, Die Adjectiva auf —icius in Archiv V, 415. 
—alis, -ilis, used to make from nouns adjectives of appurtenance (as 
regalis, gentilis), were extended: *cortilis; *ducalis; episcopalis. Cf. 
Olcott 226-238, G. 144. 
—dneus —anius, -Oneus —Onius (as extraneus, erroneus) were slightly ex- 
tended: *caroneus; spontaneus. 
-ans, -ens (-antem, -entem), present participles (as amans, potens), 
were used freely to make adjectives and nouns from verbs: credens; 
*currens ; * passans. 
-dnus, denoting appurtenance (as paganus, Romanus), was used to 
form adjectives of place (occasionally time) and nouns of office: biduanus, 
Bechtel 83; medianus, Bechtel 83; *Stcilianus ; Tuscanus ;—*capitanus ; 
decanus. 
-aricius, a combination of —arius and —icius (as sigillaricius), became 
popular in Gaul: see A. Thomas, Nouveaux essais de philologie frangaise 
62 (Hacherece, etc.). 
—Gris (as singularis) was extended: particularis. Cf. Olcott 182-187. 
-arius, attached to nouns and adjectives, to denote connection, and 
used also in the masculine to form nouns of occupation (as aguarius, ar- 
gentarius, pomarius), was much extended, especially in the latter function: 
imaginarius ; *leviarius ;— apothecarius ; * marinarius; *werrarius. Cf. 
Olcott 137-173. The phonetic development of this suffix was apparently 
peculiar in Gaul and some other regions: the earliest examples are glan-

deria < glandarius + -¢a (6th century) and sorcerus <*sortiarius (8th 
century); the earliest forms in French and Provengal are ~ers, -e7, then 
-iers,-ier. On the other hand, Spanish evo and Italian —a/o are perfectly 
regular, Italian —a7o is easily explained by the analogy of the plural —a77, 
and Italian -seve, -iero are probably borrowed. E. R. Zimmermann, Die 
Geschichte des lateinischen Suffixes —arius in den romanischen Sprachen, 
and E. Staaff, Le sufixe -arius dans les langues romanes, try to derive all the 
forms from -arius. P. Marchot, Zs. XXI, 296 (cf. Phon. I, 34-36), postu- 
lates -ar(i)ws and -er(é)ws, showing that while the French forms may per- 
haps be derived from -arius and -/arius, the Provengal cannot. Cf. 
Gram. I, 222, § 227. Zimmermann, Zs. XX VI, 591, points out that many 
words have ¢, ¢, or ¢ before the a, that -sav/us was a real suffix (cf. ana- 
tiarius, Olcott 142), that —-/arius and —carius may have established —éers in 
French. A. Thomas, Rom. XXXI, 481 (cf. Nouveaux essais de philologie 
francaise 119, and Bausteine 641), suggests that the Germans in Gaul 
associated -avius with their proper names in -areis or -ari, and when 
umlaut affected the a of these, pronounced —ar7us, too, as —erius or -erus, 
and that this pronunciation spread to the neo-Latin speakers. Cf. Chairi- 
bertus repeatedly used for Charibertus by Fredegarius: Haag 7. 
—dtus, a perfect participle ending (as sceleratus), was much used to 
make adjectives in the popular language: exauguratus; *fatatus; timo- 
ratus. Cf. Olcott 244-250, G. 159-160. 
-bilis, or -abilis, -ibilis, an objective suffix used to make adjectives 
from verbs (as amadilis, terribilis), is very common in Christian writers 
and was much employed in late Latin, especially in learned words; it is 
rare, however, in Rumanian (Cooper XLV): acceptabilis; capabilis; *cari- 
tabilis ; diligibilis ; indicibilis, G. 137. Cf. Olcott 209-213, R. 109-116, 
G. 135-140. 
—ceus —cius: see —dceus 
-ens: see —ans. 
—ensis, used to make from nouns adjectives of appurtenance (as foren- 
sis), was greatly extended, especially in popular speech, the derivatives 
being sometimes employed as nouns: * cortensis ; * Frankensis; turrensis, 
G. 155; vallensis, G. 155;—* markensis ; * pagensis. 
—eus —ius, denoting material (as aureus), was slightly extended (but is 
rare in Rumanian: Cooper XLV); the derivative was sometimes used as 
anoun: panneus ; papyrius ;— fageus; querceus. Cf. Olcott 339-344. 
-+tbilis: see —bilis, 
-iceus ~icius: see dceus.

  § 40] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 25 
~icus (as medicus) was used especially in words from the Greek: cleri- 
cus. Cf. Olcott 220-223. 
-tdus (as rapidus) was slightly extended: exsiicidus, G. 155 (Tertullian) 
*ripidus; sapidus, 
—ilis: see —alis. 
-inus; see Nouns. 
-tnus (as fraxinus) was used for a few adjectives: guercinus. 
-iscus, probably a fusion of Greek -wos (Syriscus) and Germanic 
-isk (Thiudiscus), was used for -icus in some late words: * Angliscus ; 
*Frankiscus. 
-ittus: see Nouns. 
tus: see —eus. 
—ivus (as nativus) occurs in a few new formations: *vestivus. Cf. Olcott 
224-226. 
~oneus: see —dneus. 
—6rius: see —l6rius, 
-dsus, also —idsus: Rom. XXXIX, 217. 
—sorius: see -torius. 
-torius, -sorius, made up of -t-0r, -s-or 4 -ius (as noscere notor notorius, 
censére censor censorius), were used for some new formations: defensorius ; 
mansorius. In Provengal and Rumanian —/orivs was extended, with the 
sense of -di/is or of the gerundive: Pr. punidor; Rum. jurdtériii, 
Tiktin 597. 
-iilus, diminutive (as al/bulus), was a favorite with Christian writers; 
promptulus, G. 158. Cf. G. 157-158. 
-tindus (as jocundus) was used in Spanish and Provengal for a few 
words: Pr. volon. 
~iitus (as canutus) was somewhat extended: *carnutus. 
d. SUFFIXES FOR ADVERBS." 
40. The usual endings are as follows: — 
—ce -c (as me nec, num nunc, tum tunc) was apparently used to form 
dunc (C. I. L. 1X, 4810, etc.) = dum + ce (cf, Franz. 2 I, 10); Pirson 252 
cites eight examples of dunc, one of them from Gaul. Cf. donigue in 
Substrate II, 103-106. Possibly *anc is derived from az in the same 
way: cf. Archiv I, 241; Gram. III, 552. 
-e is very common in St. Jerome: G. 193-197 (angelice, etc.). It was

preserved in popular speech in dene, longe, male, pure, tarde, and occur 
also in Romanice, whence such formations as Brittanice, Normannice, 
letcs 
iter: see —ter. 
~o and -um generally coincided in pronunciation (mudtum = muito, 
etc.). They are rare in St. Jerome, but common in other late writers: 
clanculo, multum, rato, etc. Many such adverbs were preserved in com- 
mon speech, as It. alto, basso, caldo, chiaro, piano, poco; hence other ad- 
jectives came to be used as adverbs (as It. forte, soave), arid in Rumanian 
nearly all adjectives may be so used (as grei, noii). 
-ter (as breviter) was not preserved in common speech, though much 
used in ecclesiastical Latin (G. 197-201: infantiliter, etc.), being especially 
common in St. Cyprian (Bayard 32-34). 
-tim was favored by St. Cyprian (Bayard 34-35) and some other 
writers, but was not kept alive in popular Latin. 
Some adverbial phrases on the model ad... -dnes (in Italy also with- 
out the preposition) came into use: It. a ginocchioni, bocconi; Fr. & recu- 
lons. Cf. Gram. II, 689; Rom. XXXIII, 230; Zs. XXIX, 245, XXX, 
337» 339- 
Repetition was used, as sometimes in Classic Latin, for emphatic 
etfect. Many examples are to be found in Petronius: modo modo = 
‘only yesterday,’ Waters Ch. 37, Ch. 42, Ch. 46. 
41. Adverbs of manner came to be made with the ablative 
mente, This noun was first used with an adjective to denote 
a state of mind, as forti mente, obstinata mente, jocunda mente, 
Jirma mente, sana mente; Apuleius, dubia mente, 1, 6, and saucia 
mente, V, 23. Then it was employed in a more general sense« 
pari mente, G. 428; *bona mente; * ipsa mente; * mala mente 
Later, perhaps after the Vulgar Latin period, menze was used 
with any adjective that could make an adverb of manner, 
*longa mente; sola mente, Gl. Reich. This formation is not 
common, however, in Rumanian: Zaz. Spr. 487. In the 
Romance languages mente was sometimes added to adverbs; 
Fr. comment; It. insiememente.

e. CHANGE OF SUFFIX. 
42. The popular language sometimes substitutes one suffix 
for another, as manuplus for manipulus. The principal types 
are: — 
(1) Subsitutior of a new or common suffix for an old or 
rare one: — 
—ctllus > -céllus: see -ilus. 
-citlus > céllus: see -tilus. 
-élus > -é/lus (common in late Latin): camélus > caméllus, Cohn 213- 
216, R. 460; loguéla > loguélla, Corssen I, 227, R. 460; gueréla > querélla, 
S. 131, R. 321, 460; suadéla > suadélla, R. 460. Cf. Caper (Keil VII, 
96): “guerela, loguela per unum 7.” 
-énus >-inus: “Bysacenus non Byzacinus,” App. Pr.; venénum > 
*veninum. Cf. Cohn, 219-226. 
—ex(-écem) > -ix(-icem): vervécem > berbicem. Cf. Cohn 41-42. 
illus > -éllus: axilla > ascélla, etc. Cf. Cohn 42-52. 
-or (-drem) >-tira: calor >*caliira; pavor>*pavura; rancor>*ran- 
cura, etc. Cf. Cohn 172-180. 
lus > —t4lus: anitlus> anéllus; avictila> avicélla, etc. Cf. Cohn 
17-28. 
-tius > -itus: vacuus > * victtus (cf. § 195). 
(2) Indiscriminate use of two suffixes: — 
—dnus = -aneus: extraneus *extranus; subterraneus * subterranus. Cf. 
Cohn 160-172. 
—dtus = -itus = -titus: barbatus *barbutus ; carnatus * carnutus; cauda- 
tus cauditus, Cohn 184; lanatus lanutus, Cohn 184. Cf. Cohn 180-205. 
-iceus -icius = -tceus -icius: ertcius *ericius. Cohn 30-31. 
-icttlus = -tcttlus: cafitiilus * capititlus ; cornictila * corntcitla; lentictila 
*lenticitla. Cf. Cohn 151-154. 
~ictilus = -itctilus: osstculum ossticulum, Waters Ch. 65; pediculus 
pediiculus. 
~ilius = -tlius: consilium *consilium; familia *familia. Cf. Cohn 
154-160. 
~ix(-icem) = -ix(-icem): sdricem * soricem. Cf. Cohn 147-151. 
(3) Alteration of a suffix: — 
~drius: see Suffixes for Adjectives, —drius. Cf. Cohn 274-291.

43. Acer arbor (> Fr. érable); alba spina; avis striithius; 
bene placitum, G. 131; bis coctum,; in bdio; médio die; médio

b. ADJECTIVES. 
44. These compounds generally belonged to the literary 
style. G. 130-134, 160-170: magnisonans; omnimodus; unt- 
cornis; unigenitus; etc. But male habitus, etc., were popular. 
c. PRONOUNS.

d. VERBS. 
46. Calce pistare; crucifigére, G. 191; foris mittére; genu- 
flectére, G. 191; inde fiigére (> Fr. enfuir) ; intra vidére; manu

antemittére, etc., in Gl. Reich. In church writers there are 
many verbs in —ficare, as mortificare: G. 190. 
e. ADVERBS. 
47. There were many compounds made up of a preposition 
and an adverb: ad ante, R. 234; ab intus, R. 231, Bon. 483; 
ab olim, Bechtel 101; a contra, Bechtel 101; @ foras, Bechtel 
101; @ foris, R. 231, Bon. 483; @ longe, G. 203, Bon. 483; @

Spr. 487; in contra, R. 235; in hodie, Bechtel 102; im mane, 
Bechtel 102; *in semel, Substrate III, 268. 
Petronius (Waters Ch. 38) says: Udi semel res inclinata 
amici de medio. 
The following compounds are of a still different nature: ac 
sit, Per. 40,8, etc.; ef sic, Per. 39,17, etc.; usgue hodie, G. 426, 
Per. 68,13. 
f. PREPOSITIONS. 
48. Some of these adverbial compounds, and some others 
similar to them, were used as prepositions: ab ante, Lexigue 
40;—de ante, Bechtel 102; de inter, Bechtel 102, Haag 75; de 
intus; de retro; in ante; in contra. Cf. E. Wolfflin, Adante, in 
Archiv I, 437. Slightly different is intws in, Bechtel 102. 
A compound made up of preposition + noun is found in: 
in giro (followed by the ablative or the accusative), Bechtel 
102; im medio, Bechtel 102; per girum and per giro = circa, 
Bechtel ro2. 
Some compounds consist of two prepositions: *de ad (>It. 
da); de post, R. 235; de sub, R. 235; de super, Bon. 484. 
g. CONJUNCTIONS. 
49. Atubi and ad ubi, Bon. 484-486 (cf. Per. 74,28, 85,15, 
etc.); et at ubi, Per. 72,19, 75,3. 
  
1 Romance da, dad may be the result of a fusion rather than a combination of de 
and ad. In any case it is probably’a late product. Some have thought it came from 
de+ab. Mohl, Lexigue 38-47, says da is found from the 7th century on; he would 
derive It. and Old Sp. da, Sardinian dave, daz, Retian dad from the Oscan da, dat 
and from a southern Latin *dadi, * dade. 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  LEG SIN AK: 
A. ORDER OF WORDS.? 
50. The Romance order is simpler and more rational than 
that of Classic Latin. It does not permit the arbitrary 
separation of members that belong together, such as the prep- 
osition and the word it governs, or the adjective and the 
noun it modifies, as in Ovid’s “In nova fert animus mutatas 
dicere formas corpora.” Neither does it allow the collocation 
of words of the same part of speech that belong logically in 
different places, as in the “In multis hoc rebus dicere habe- 
mus” of Lucretius. The most irrational features of the 
Classic Latin construction were surely artifical, and were not 
characteristic of daily speech. Nevertheless there is really a 
fundamental difference between the old order and the new: 
Romance has, so to speak, a crescendo, Latin to a certain 
extent a diminuendo movement (Lat. Spr. 491); Romance puts 
the emphasis at the end, Latin very frequently in the middle. 
The principle, however, is not primarily rhythmic, but psychic, 
the difference being due to a diverse conception of the 
structure of language: Romance inclines more to put the 
modifier after the word modified. The modern order is the 
more logical, proceeding from the known to the unknown. 
The old arrangement is exemplified by this sentence: “Fabius 
  
1See Meyer-Liibke, Gram. III, for a comprehensive account of Romance syntax. 
2 See Elise Richter, Zur Entwicklung der romanischen Wortstellung aus der 
lateinischen, 1903, from which work most of the matter of this chapter was taken.

  § 52] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 31 
zequatus imperio Hannibalem et virtute et fortuna superiorem 
vidit.” The following examples illustrate the later structure: 
“Mors perfecit tua ut essent omnia brevia,” “Hc loca sunt 
montuosa et natura impedita ad rem militarem.” The change 
constitutes a progress in language; all cultivated peoples have 
made it. It is indigenous in Latin, not imitated from the 
Greek, which independently effected the same transformation. 
51. The modern order was not abruptly substituted for the 
old. On the contrary, it is to be found in Latin, with generally 
increasing frequency, in inscriptions and popular writers, from 
the earliest texts down; it occurs sporadically also in literary 
authors, especially in Cicero. Petronius has notably short 
periods and an approach to the new structure. But until the 
fourth century the majority of Latin sentences have the old 
arrangement. Classic Latin may be said to represent an in- 
termediate stage, while the revolution was in progress; there 
was a long struggle, and for centuries the ancient and the 
modern type were used side by side. By the fourth century 
the new order prevailed. Here is a characteristic passage 
from the Peregrinatio: “Heec est autem vallis ingens et planis- 
sima, in qua filii Israhel commorati sunt his diebus, quod 
sanctus Moyses ascendit in montem Domini, et fuit ibi qua- 
draginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus” (Pe. 37,2124). The 
following is a good sample of the style of the Vulgate: “Cui 
respondit Dominus: Qui peccaverit mihi, delebo eum de libro 
meo; tu autem vade, et duc populum istum quo locutus sum 
tibi; angelus meus pracedet te. Ego autem in die ultionis 
visitabo et hoc peccatum eorum” (Zxodus XXXII, 33, 34). 
52. There was always a tendency to put a stressed word 
first, followed by an unaccented one, such as a connective or 
an, atonic pronoun (Laz. Spr. 490). According to Meyer-
-P-A-G-E-50
  32 Aw Inrropuction to Vutcar Latin. [8 55 
Liibke, Zs. XXI, 313, personal pronouns, when unstressed, 
were always enclitic in Latin, and were attached preferably to 
the first word in the sentence ; and so it was in the early stages 
of the Romance languages: cf, It. vedolo but non lo vedo, 
aiutatemt but or m’aiutate; Fr. voit le but gui le voit. The 
definite article, however, precedes its noun in all the Romance 
languages except Rumanian and Albanian (Zauner 40). 
53- In dependent clauses, which were naturally of less im- 
portance, the old order survived longer than in independent. 
In a few other respects the old arrangement lingered and under 
certain conditions is still preserved: negative and intensive 
adverbs precede their verb; under some circumstances’ the 
object may come before the verb, and sometimes the whole 
predicate precedes; in certain constructions the dependent 
infinitive may stand before the finite verb (as Pr. morir 
volgra). 
B. USE OF WORDS. 
54. There were great changes in the functions of pronouns, 
prepositions, conjunctions, and adverbs. Many uses of prepo- 
sitions are connected with the loss of inflections: these will be 
discussed under the Use of Inflections. A definite and an 
indefinite article developed out of #//e and unus. 
1. NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES. 
55. For the simplification of inflections, see the Use of In- 
flections. 
Repetition for intensive effect is not uncommon in late 
writers: Commodian, malum malum, WoOlfflin 4; bene bene. 
bonis bonis, fortis fortis, malus malus, etc., R. 280. Cf. § 40. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
    
§ 57] An InrRopucTion ro VuLGAR LaTIN. 33 
a. COMPARISON. 
56. Little by little the old comparative and superlative lost 
their precise sense from being employed frequently with merely 
an intensive force (WoOlfflin 83). The comparative came to 
be used for a superlative, as omnium levior (WOlfflin 68-71), 
and also fora positive, as Ovid’s inertior etas (WOlfflin 63-68 ); 
and the superlative was often really a positive in meaning, as 
in St. Augustine’s sancta atgue dulcissima (WOlfflin 57-63), 
and in hic est filius meus carissimus, etc. (R. 415-417). From 
early times certain periphrases were used to emphasize the 
comparative idea, as Plautus, me/ius sanus (WoOlfflin 16); An- 
thimus, A/us congruus and maxime congruus (Wolfflin 16; cf. 
maxime pessima, etc., R. 280); Vitruvius, magis melior, etc. 
(Wolfflin 46); Commodian, pus Zevior, etc. (Wolfflin 47). To 
avoid ambiguity, the g/us and magis constructions were em- 
ployed more and more to express a distinct comparison: p/us 
miser in Tertullian, plus formosus in Nemesianus, plus dulce, 
plus felix, etc., in Sidonius Apollinaris (Wo6lfflin 29). Finally, 
toward the end of the Vulgar Latin period, this formation 
came to be popularly regarded as the regular one: magis 
mirabilem, Sepulcri 232; plus popularis, magis ... preclarum, 
Bon. 451. Many old comparative forms remained, however, 
in common use. Cf. Adverbs. In the Romance languages a 
substitute for the superlative was made by prefixing the defi- 
nite article to the comparative; it is likely that this device 
existed in late Vulgar Latin, but no example of it has been 
found. See Archiv VIII, 166-170. 
b. NUMERALS." 
57. Unus was used as an indefinite article, occasionally in 
Classic Latin, frequently in late and popular writers: /epida   
1 For the forms of numerals, see Morphology. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52

eters Ch. 26; accessit ad eum una sorella, R. 425; cf. Per. 48, 
2s, etc. 
58. Ordinal numerals, except a few of the smallest, were 
apparently not much used in popular speech after the fifth 
century. 
2. PRONOUNS. 
59. Pronouns were much more used than in Classic Latin : 
G. 408-409. 
a. PERSONAL AND POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS. 
60. The personal pronouns came into more and more fre- 
quent use. go and ¢u are very common in Petronius. The 
demonstratives, especially ¢//e, were employed as personal pro- 
nouns of the third person. ‘The adverb mde came to be used 
occasionally as a genitive neuter pronoun: nemo inde dubitat, 
Regnier 10; exinde= Fr. en, Bon. 580. 
Many pronouns developed double forms, according as they 
were accented or unaccented (as swuws and sus): see Morphol- 
ogy. Cf. $158. 
There was great irregularity in the use of reflexives, espe- 
cially the possessives, sus being generally substituted for 
ejus. See Lat. Spr. 489, G. 403-404, Hoppe 102-103, Dubois 
333-336. 
b. DEMONSTRATIVES. 
61. /dem went out of popular use, being replaced by #//e 
and “se. For the encroachment of ise on idem, see Hoppe 
104, Bayard 133. 
62. /s, too, was often replaced by i//e and ise (Bechtel 
145), and eventually was preserved in vulgar speech only in 
the combination eccum (= ecce hum), where it was not recog:

nized,’ and in the extremely common phrase 7d ipsum (>It. 
desso), where likewise the zd lost its significance. This last 
compound was used as a neuter pronoun, meaning ‘it’ or 
‘that,’ as id ipsum sapite, R. 424 (cf. R. 424-425, G. 407, 
Quillacq 126), and also as a demonstrative adjective, generally 
invariable, as id ipsum velam, R. 424, in id ipsum monastyriu, 
franz. a Il, 2, in id ipsam rem, Franz. a I, 2. 
63. Hic, il/e, and iste came to be used indiscriminately (G. 
405-406, Hoppe 104, Bayard 130-132); there are examples of 
iste for hic in Czesar’s time (Densusianu 178). ic and zs, too, 
were confused by late writers (Bayard 132). Toward the end 
of the Vulgar Latin period 4c was apparently going out of 
common use, with the exception of the neuter hoc. 
64. A combination of two demonstratives was common in 
Christian writers: zs ipse, iste ipse, ipse ille, ille ipse, iste ilic, 
iste hic, hic ipse. The last three have left no trace. 
65. Lecce and eccum (pronounced eccu) were used as demon- 
strative prefixes (cf. §24): we find early ecce ego, ecce tu, ecce 
hic, ecce nunc; also ecce iste, ecce il/e, such combinations being . 
common in Plautus. The final stage, probably not reached 
until the end of the Vulgar Latin period, is the fusion of the 
two parts into one word. 
Atgue, too, was perhaps used as a prefix (Gram. II, 646): 
Plautus, a/gue ipse illic est (Epidicus 91), atque is est (Stichus 
582). G. Ascoli, however, Zutorno ai continuatori neolatini del 
lat.“ipsu—” in Archivio glottologico italiano XV, 303 (discussing 
Sp. aguese, Pg. aguesse, Catalan agueix, etc.), maintains that 
eccu’ was the basis in all the Empire. At any rate, eccu’ was 
influenced in some regions, especially in Spain and southern 
Gaul, by azgue or ac (as in ac sic). 
  
1Cf, Plautus, Mil. Glor. I, 25: “ Ubi tu’s? —Eccum.”
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  36 Aw Intropuction To VuLcar LarTIN. [s 69 
When és/e and 7//e lost their distinctive force, people said for 
‘this’ ecc’iste or eccu’iste, for ‘that’ ecc’ille or eccw’ille. These 
compounds developed into * ecceste, * acceste, * ceste, * eccueste, 
* accueste, *cueste and *eccelle, *accelle, * celle, * eccuelle, 
*accuelle, * cuelle. 
66. The suffix —me¢ was used also as an intensive prefix, 
ipsemet becoming metipse through such combinations as ¢emei 
ipsum (Lcclus. XXX, 22), semetipsum (Philip. 11,8). Cf. §24. 
Ego met ipse is blamed by Donatus (Zaz. Spr. 484). 
Beside ifse, there was an emphatic form #simus (used by 
Petronius: Waters Ch. 69, etc.). This, with the prefix met, 
became * metipsimus. 
67. Llle, hic, ipse, is, especially i7/e, were used as personal 
pronouns of the third person. Cf. § 60. 
68. lle, hic, ipse, is were used also as definite articles. Z//e 
in this function is very common: R. 419-420 (cito proferte 
mihi stolam illam primam). Examples of the others are by no 
means infrequent: Ai, R. 427 (virum hunc cujus est zona hec); 
" ipse, R. 423 (in ipsa multitudine); is, R. 423-425. This use of 
zs was probably more literary than popular. 
c. INTERROGATIVES AND RELATIVES. 
69. The forms were greatly confused by late writers. In 
Bon. 391-396 we find gu used as n. sg. and pl.; gue as m., as 
n., as acc. f. sg., as acc. m. pl.; guvod as m., asf. pl., asn. pl.; 
quem as n.; gua very often as n. pl. (395-396). 
In popular speech gué was apparently used regularly for 
quis: Audollent 549, Quillacq 126-127, Bon. 391-392; it is 
common in inscriptions. Furthermore, the masculine gui took 
the place of the feminine gw@; it occurs in Christian inscrip- 
tions from the fifth century on: cf. R. 276 (gud, guem for gua.

quam), Haag 51, Bon. 390-391, 394 (gui f. sg. and f. pl., guem 
f.), Archiv I, 53 (gud for gue in 528 a. p.). Quid, moreover, 
gradually encroached on guod: Bon. 393. 
70. Qualis was kept, and was used as an interrogative and 
as a relative. The adverb wmde came to have occasionally the 
meaning of French dont (Bon. 580; Zs. Beiheft 7, 178), and 
eventually * de unde, * d’unde, was employed as a relative pro- 
noun. Cf. § 84. 
d. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS. 
71. Some Classic Latin pronouns fell into disuse, and some 
new compounds were made. The principal indefinite pronouns 
and adjectives used in late popular speech are as follows: — 
aliquanti took the place of aliguié and aliguot: aliquanta oppida cepit, 
G. 415. 
altquis flourished especially in the west: Sp. alguien, Pg. alguem. The 
neuter a/iguid was more extended: Pr. algues. 
aliqui tinus > *aliqu’iinus * alicinus. 
alius and alter were confused in common speech: G. 415-417; Plautus, 
alius filius, G. 417. This confusion is more frequent in late Latin: St. 
Jerome, nemo judicat alterum, G. 416. There is evidence of the retention of 
the old neuter a/d (Lucretius I, 263): Archiv I, 237. 
cata was probably introduced, along the Mediterranean, by Greek mer- 
chants, in such phrases as cafa unum = kal éva, cata tres = xara Tpeis. 
Hence * cata tinus, * cat iinus, etc. Cf. § 19. 
hdmo was used sometimes like French on: Per. 55, 25. 
inde came to mean, in certain constructions, ‘some’ or ‘any.’ 
magis: see plus. 
miiltus. 
*nec ente or *ne ente was apparently used as an equivalent for 2hi/ 
Meyer-Liibke, Gram. II, 650, conjectures * ze inde. 
* ne ipse tinus, * ne’ps’tinus. 
nec unus. 
némo was kept in Italy, Sardinia, and Dacia: Lat. Spr. 485. 
niullus. 
omnis: see totus. Omnis and omnia were kept in Italy.

paucus. 
persona, 
plus and magis were confused: G. 427, Regnier 108-109 (guanto plus 
tenetur tanto plus timetur, 109). 
quatis. 
quantus, tantus replaced quot, tot. There are examples as early as 
Propertius: Densusianu 179. Cf. Driger 104, § 53, R. 336-337, G. 
413-415 (St. Jerome, guanti justi esuriunt, 414; Claudian, tantis lacri- 
mis, 415). 
qui. 
quigue. 
quis. 
quisque, quisquis, Quisque was much extended (G. 409-411), being 
used for guisguis and guicumgue (Bayard 135). 
ves and res nata = ‘anyone’, ‘anything’: R. 345. 
talis. 
tantus; see guantus. 
totus, pronounced also fottus (S. 121) and perhaps *“ittus, was some- 
times used for omnis: Plautus, ‘otis horis, Mil. Glor. 212. This use was 
common in late Latin: Densusianu 178, Bechtel 143, R. 338, G. 402-403 
(tota tormenta diaboli in me veniant, 403). Cf. §§ 163, 204, (2). 
unus. 
3. VERBS. 
72. Frequent in late Latin is a pleonastic use of dedeo, 
Bon. 691-693: commonens ut... custodire debeant, 692. CE. 
§ 117. Compare the old Italian use of dovere. 
There is also a common pleonastic use of cvfz with the in- 
finitive, instead of the perfect: see § 124. 
Videri, too, is often used pleonastically: Bayard 99-100. 
4. ADVERBS. 
73. The words referring to the “place in which” and the 
“place into which” were confused, ui being used for guo, 07 
for eo: Lat. Spr. 488. Unde was employed in the sense of
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  § 78] An IntTRopuction TO VULGAR LATIN. 39 
‘where’ (Zs. Beiheft 7, 157); also ‘therefore’ and ‘where- 
fore’: Dic amice unde tristis es, Regnier 110; cf. § 84. 
74. Plus was often substituted for magis, and magis for 
fotius: Bayard 110. Plus and magis were used more and 
more for comparison, and the old comparative and superlative 
forms became rarer: see §56. Repetition was used for in- 
tensive effect: Seneca, semper semper, Wolfflin 5. Bene, 
multum, satis were employed as intensives more than in 
Classic Latin. Zotum occurs often as an adverb: Per. 37,1, 
and many other places; Dubois 332. 
75. Double negation is frequent: R. 446-447 (nec facio 
nihil, etc.). Von for ne with the subjunctive is common: G. 
435, Regnier 110. The absolute use of om, meaning ‘no’, 
occurs occasionally: Décit unus ex uno angulo: Ecce hic est. 
Alius ex alio angulo: Non, sed ecce hic est, Regnier 111. 
5. PREPOSITIONS. 
76. The functions of prepositions were very much extended 
(Bayard 137-158): see Use of Inflections, Cases. 
77. Ab, according to Mohl, Zexigue 43, is not found in 
any of the Italic dialects except Latin. It apparently has no 
successors in the Romance languages, having been replaced by 
ae, which also, from the third century on, usurped the place of 
ex (Lat. Spr. 487, R. 395-396, Hoppe 38): de palatio exit, 
Bechtel 105; egredere de ecclesia, Bechtel 105; de utero matris 
nati sunt sic, R. 3953 egressus de arca, G. 339; muri de lapide 
jaspide, G. 342; vivo de decimis, G. 341; de adversario... 
aliquid postulare, Hoppe 38; mec de cubiculo... procedit, . 
Hoppe 38. 
78. Ad for apud occurs in Plautus, Terence, and others  
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 80 
(Oliver 5-6), and is common in late writers (R. 390-392, 
Urbat 10): ad ipsum fontem facta est oratio, Bechtel 103; ad 
nos, Bechtel 104; cf. Per. 42,27. For the most part apud was 
replaced by ad, except in Gaul, where it was kept with the 
sense of cum: Haag 74, Urbat 27 (¢ractans apud me metipsum; 
also ab una manu pallas altaris tenerem, etc., where ab seems 
to be used for afud). Apud is used for cum by Sulpicius 
Severus, and more frequently by later authors: Lat Spr. 489. 
According to F, G. Mohl, Za préposition cum et ses successeurs 
en gallo-roman in Bausteine 61, apud is repeatedly found for 
cum in the Latin writers of Gaul, and cum for apud in Gregory 
of Tours; cum probably disappeared from actual use in Gaul 
by the fourth century; apud, being, as he says, a new word, 
had a great vogue in authors of the second and third centuries, 
a critical period for Gaul, and so came to supplant cwm in that 
country.* 
79. Pro often had the sense of ‘for,’ and replaced 0d and 
propter: fides pro una muliere perfida, G. 343; volo pro legentis 
Sacilitate abuti sermone vulgato, G. 343; attendimus locum illum 
pro memoria illius, Bechtel 106. ro itself was partially re- 
placed by fer (cf. $14), but was substituted for fer in other 
regions (Urbat 34-35). 
80. Circa, in the Empire, frequently meant ‘concerning’: 
Srustrati circa veritatem, Hoppe 37. /uxta often signified ‘ ac- 
cording to’: juxta consuetudinem, Bechtel 105; juxta drachme 
exemplum, Hoppe 37. Super sometimes replaced de. fallere 
vos super hanc rem, Bechtel 106; super anima commendatus, 
Hoppe 41. 
  
1 Mohl would derive the Old It. affo, not from apud, but from * ad post (p. 71); 
Fr. avec, not from afud + hoc, but from ad hoc (pp. 75-76). Pr. ab he takes from 
apud, but Pr. am from Italic amb, am.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  § 84] An InrTRopucTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. 41 
81. Retro, subtus, de foris, foris, foras were freely used as 
prepositions (R. 398-400, G. 334): vade retro me, R. 399; 
subtus terram, R. 399. 
6. CONJUNCTIONS. 
82. Quod, guia, guoniam (and after jubere, ut: R. 427-428) 
are used very often by late writers instead of the accusative 
and infinitive construction: R. 402, Regnier rr2-113, Ut 
with the infinitive is not infrequent: R. 445-446. Quod for 
ut is very common: Audollent 549. 0 guod came to be much 
used in the sense of ‘that’: Per. 48, 27, etc. Eventually ut 
was generally discarded. 
Cur, quare sometimes replaced guod and guia: .G. 431-432. 
Quia, which in late Latin was often reduced to gu or gua (see 
§ 168) frequently took the place of gvod: Regnier 111-112. 
Quomodo became a great favorite, often supplanting guando, 
guod, and guoniam: R. 403. Quando displaced cum in the 
temporal sense. Quwa, ‘when’, encroaches on guando in the 
Peregrinatio: 46, 22, etc.; cf. Bechtel 119-120. 
83. Sitook the place of am and utrum (R. 403-405, Regnier 
111), and was often used for we and num (G. 430): videte si 
potest dici, Regnier 111. Ac si frequently did service for 
quasi: Per. 39, 3, and many other places; Bon. 323. 
84. Aut... aut is sometimes equivalent to e¢... et: Per. 
49, 24; cf. Bayard 161. Ac sic recurs continually in the Pere- 
grinatio, meaning ‘and so’ or ‘so’: 40, 8, etc. Zamen in the 
same text (37, 2, etc.) seems to be used, in most cases, merely 
to indicate a subordinate clause. Magis is much employed 
for ‘but’ by late writers. Unde sometimes means ‘therefore’ 
and ‘wherefore’: G. 424 (unde inguit Dominus); cf. §§ 70, 73

42 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 86 
C. USE OF INFLECTIONS. 
1. CASES.! 
85. In popular speech prepositions were more used, from 
the beginning, than in the literary language; prepositional 
constructions, as time went on, increasingly took the place of 
pure case distinctions, and the use of cases became more and 
more restricted. Hence arises in late writers a great irregu- 
larity in the employment of cases?: G. 302-326, Quillacq g6- 
103; for African Latin, Archiv VIII, 174-176; for confusion 
after verbs and adjectives, R. 412-415. 
. a. LOCATIVE. 
86. The locative, rare in Classic Latin, remained eventually 
only in names of places. ‘There are, however, several examples 
in the Peregrinatio: Bechtel 110, et sic fit missa Anastasi, ut 
fit missa ecclesia, etc. We find remnants of the locative geni- 
tive in Agrigenti> Girgenti, Arimini> Rimini, Clusit> Chiusi, 
Florentiea > Firenze, Palestine (G. 322), etc.; of the locative 
ablative singular in 77bi7> Tivoli; of the locative ablative 
plural in Andecdvis > Angers, Aquis> Acqui Aix, Astis> Asti, 
Finibus > Fimes, Parisiis> Parigi Paris, etc. Cf. B. Bianchi 
in Archivio glottologico italiano IX, 378. With other words, 
and very often with place names also, the locative was replaced 
by za with the ablative (Hoppe 32: iz Alexandria) or by ad 
with the accusative (Urbat 10); the domi or domo of Cicero 
becomes 7m domo in Seneca. When the locative of names of 
localities was kept, it generally came to be regarded as an in-     
1C£, Pirson 169-202. 
2 There is confusion even in Petronius, who occasionally uses the accusative for 
the dative and the ablative.
-P-A-G-E-61
    
§ 89] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 43 
variable form; we find such locatives used as nominatives from 
the third century on: Lat, Spr. 481. 
b. VOCATIVE. 
87. The vocative is like the nominative in most words in 
Classic Latin, and such words as had a separate vocative form 
tended to discard it: vocatives in —ws, instead of —e, occur in 
Plautus, Horace, and Livy; meus for mi is very common 
(Regnier 34). In Vulgar Latin the vocative form probably 
disappeared entirely, except perhaps in a few set phrases, such 
as mi dimine. 
c. GENITIVE. 
88. The genitive, little by little, was supplanted by other 
constructions, generally by the ablative with de (which occurs 
as early as Plautus), sometimes by the dative. Examples 
abound: expers partis... de nostris bonis, Terence Heaut. IV, 
1, 39; partem de istius impudentia, Cicero, Verr. II, 1, 12; 
clerici de ipsa’ ecclesia, Bechtel 104; de aceto plenum, R. 396; 
de Deo munus, R. 396; curator de sacra via, R. 426; de colenti- 
bus gentilibusque multitudo magna (also guidam ex eis), Acts 
XVII, 4; possessor de propria terra, Urbat 20; de sorore nepus, 
Pirson 194; terminus de nostra donatione, 528 a. D., Archiv I, 
53; cf. Bon. 610ff. For the partitive genitive we find: xz 
gustabit de meo, Plautus, cited by Draeger I, 628; aliquid de 
lumine, Hoppe 38; neminem de presentibus, Hoppe 38; de 
pomis = ‘some apples,’ Per. 40,10; de spiritu Moysi, Bechtel 
104; de animalibus, de oleo, etc., R. 396; aliguid habet de vere- 
cundia discipuli, R. 342; numguid Zaccheus de bono habebat, 
Regnier 54; guéd de scientia, Sepulcri 217; de studentibus, Pir- 
son 197. Cf. Oliver 14. 
89. According to Meyer-Liibke, Zaz Spr. 487, the genitive 
probably ceased to be really popular, save in set combinations,  
-P-A-G-E-62
  44 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 90 
by the beginning of the third century. In late Latin a wrong 
form was often used: @ deo honorem in an inscription in Gaul, 
Zs. fr. Spr. XXV, ii, 135;-matre mea, alta nocte silentia, etc., 
Bon. 341-342; in fundo illa villa, etc., D’Arbois 13; in honore 
alme Maria, etc., D’Arbois 91-93. 
The genitive was retained, however, in some pronouns, in a 
good many set phrases, in certain words that belonged es- 
pecially to clerical Latin, and probably in some proper names: 
cujus, illijus, illorum, etc.; line dies, est ministérii, de noctis 
tempore >It. di notte tempore (later di notte tempo), etc. ; ange- 
lorum, paganorum, etc.; It. Paoli, Pieri, etc. 
d. DATIVE. 
90. The dative was more stable than the genitive: Zaz. 
Spr. 487. We find, however, as early as Plautus, a tendency 
to replace it by the accusative with ad: ad carnujicem dabo, 
Plautus, Capt. 1019; ad me magna nuntiavit, Plautus, Zruc. IV, 
1, 4; 52 pecunia ad id templum data erit, inscription of 57 B.C., 
C. I. L. 1X, 3513; apparet ad agricolas, Varro, De Re Rustica 
I, 40; ad propinguos restituit, Livy 11, 13 — constructions freely 
used by Classic authors. Inasmuch as the dative, in the sing- 
ular of most nouns and in the plural of all, was identical in 
form either with the ablative or with the genitive (e. g., cause 
causis, muro muris, mari maribus), the fear of ambiguity natur- 
ally fostered this practice and the substitution became very 
general in most of the Empire: ait ad me, Per. 64,8; dicens 
ad eum, etc., Bechtel 102-103; cum hac ad vestram affectionem 
darem, Bechtel 103; fui ad episcopum =‘ | went to the bishop’, 
Bechtel 104; Joguétur ad Jeremiam, G. 329; ad quem promissio 
Sacta, G. 329; ad quem dixit, Sepulcri 218 ; Dominus ad Moy- 
sen dicit, Urbat 12; ad me restituit omne regnum, Urbat 12; 
ad Dei officio paratus, Pirson 194. Cf. Lat. Spr. 488, Oliver
-P-A-G-E-63
  § 92] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 45 
3-4. Sometimes super, not ad, was used: tmposuerat manus 
super eum, Bechtel 105; super me misericordiam prestare, 
Bechtel 105, 
91. The dative remained in Dacia, and lingered rather late 
in Gaul (Zaz. Spr. 481); elsewhere it probably disappeared 
from really popular speech by the end of the Empire, except 
in pronouns (cé7, ¢/lud ili, etc., mi, tébi, etc.). 
Rumanian has kept the dative, in its original function and 
also as a genitive, in the first declension (as case), and so in 
feminine adjectives (as romine). 
e. ABLATIVE. 
92. The analytical tendency of speech, reinforced by the 
analogy of prepositional substitutes for the genitive and dative, 
favored the use of prepositions with the ablative, to distinguish 
its various functions. For de =‘than,’ see Zs, XXX, 641. 
Ab is common: ab omni specie idololatrie intactum, Hoppe, 
36; ab sceleribus parce, G. 335; @ carne superatur, G. 337; ab 
scriptura sancta commemoratos, Regnier 51; a premio minorem 
esse, St. Cyprian, cited by Wolfflin 52; ab Ariulfi astutia de- 
ceptus, Sepulcri 218. 
De is the most frequent: evudescens de infamia sua, Hoppe 
14; de singularitate famosum, Hoppe 33; nobilior de obsoletiore 
matrice, Hoppe 33; digni de celo Castores, Hoppe 34; gaudet 
de contumelia sua, Hoppe 34; de victus necessitate causatur, 
Hoppe 35; 2 vestra rideat emulatione, Hoppe 36; de manibus 
suis, Bechtel 104; de oculis, Bechtel 104 (cf. de se, Bechtel 
105); occidam de lancea, R. 393; patrem de regno privavit, R. 
426; de virgine natus est, Regnier 54; de te beati sunt, Regnier 
56. Cf R. 392-395, G. 339-342, Regnier 54-56. 
£x occurs also: ex causa humane salutis, Hoppe 33; ex 
infirmitate fatigata, Sepulcri 218.
-P-A-G-E-64
  46 An InTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 95 
Zn is often found: im illo die, Hoppe 313; guo in tempore, 
Hoppe 31; 7 maxilla asine delevi mille viros, R. 397; in camo 
et freno maxillas eorum constringe, Ps. XXXI, 9; in amore Dei 
ferventes, G. 347; in bonis operibus abundetis, Regnier 60. Cf. 
R. 396-397, G. 344-347, Regnier 58 ff. 
93. Sometimes ad or fer with the accusative is substituted 
for the ablative: per hoc, Hoppe 33; addiem, Bechtel 103; ad 
horam sextam aguntur, etc., Bechtel 103-104; per nomen 
vocavit, Sepulcri 218; pugnare ad ursos, ad unum gladii ictum 
caput desecare, Lat. Spr. 488. 
94. The use of prepositions became really neccessary in the 
late spoken language, because, after the fall of final m and the 
loss of quantitative distinctions in unaccented syllables, the 
ablative differed little or not at all from the accusative in the 
singular of most words: causdém causa, doniim dono, patrém 
patré, fructiim fructi, diém diz. It is likely that before the end 
of the Empire the ablative plural form was generally discarded, 
the accusative being used in its stead, and that the ablative 
and accusative singular were pronounced alike, in all words, 
in most of the Latin territory. The fusion of the two cases 
was doubtless helped by the fact that certain prepositions 
might be combined with either accusative or ablative. 
95. There is evidence of the confusion of accusative and 
ablative as early as the first century, but it was probably not 
very common before the third. Cum with the accusative i: 
very frequent: cum suos discentes, cum sodales, in inscriptions, 
Lat. Spr. 488; cum epistolam, Bechtel 95; cum res nostras, 
D’Arbois 27. Cf. E. K. Rand in Modern Philology Il, 263, 
footnote 5. 
The accusative form is substituted for the ablative after

medium maris, R. 410;—pro hoc ipsud, Bechtel 101; pro nos, 
D’Arbois 152; — sine fructum, etc., R. 406-412. 
96. Conversely, the ablative form is very often written for 
the accusative: ad ecclesia majore, Bechtel 94;— ante sole, 
ante cruce, Bechtel 95; ante sole, etc., R. 406-412 ;— circa 
puteo, Bechtel 95; — contra ipso loco, Bechtel 95 ;—foras 
ecclesia, Bechtel 96 ;—-7z” carne conversa, etc., Hoppe 40-41; 
in the Per., in + abl. for acc. is three times as common as the 
correct use of 7+ acc., Bechtel 94-101 ; venit in civitate sua, 
etc, R. 406-412 ;—intra civitate sua, Bechtel 99; intro spe-

Zectione, Bechtel 100; post morte, etc., R. 406-412 ;— prope 
luce, Bechtel 101; — propfer populo, Bechtel 101; — super 
civitate hac, Bechtel tor. 
97. The ablative was kept only in some fixed expressions, 
such as hora, ist’? annd, guomddo, pari mente, etc.; perhaps in 
such phrases as It. vendere cento soldi, etc.; probably in some 
proper names with de, as Della Casa.’ It is likely, too, that 
the ablative absolute survived in a few common expressions, 
like It. cid fatto; generally, however, in popular speech, the 
nominative absolute took its place: Bechtel rog—110, et bene- 
dicens nos episcopus profecti sumus, visa loca sancta omnia (Per. 
45, 8), etc.

f. ACCUSATIVE. : 
98. After verbs of motion ad was often used, sometimes 7x, 
instead of the simple accusative: eamus in forum, Waters Ch. 
58; fui ad ecclesiam, Bechtel 103; ad Babyloniam duxit, G. 
327; consules ad Africam profecti sunt, G. 328; ad istam 
regionem venit, Regnier 52. Cf. Regnier 51-52. 
99. Duration of time was expressed by fer with the ac- 
cusative, also by the ablative: Bechtel 108-9, per totos octo dies 
ts ornatus est, tota autem nocte vicibus dicuntur psalmi, etc. 
g. FALL OF DECLENSION. 
100. By the end of the Vulgar Latin period there probably 
remained in really popular use (aside from pronouns and a 
number of set formulas) in Dacia only three cases, in the rest 
of the Empire only two—a nominative and an accusative- 
ablative. Clerics, however, naturally tried to write in ac- 
cordance with their idea of correct Latin. 
2. VERB-FORMS. 
Io1. Many parts of the verb went out of popular use, and 
were replaced by other locutions; these obsolete parts were 
employed by writers with more or less inaccuracy. In the 
parts that remained many new tendencies manifested them- 
selves. 
a. IMPERSONAL PARTS. 
102. Only the present active infinitive and the present and 
perfect participles were left intact. 
(1) SUPINE. 
103. The supine disappeared from general use, being re- 
placed, from the first century on, by the infinitive: as cum
-P-A-G-E-67
  § 106] An Intrropuction To VuLcaR LatIN. 49 
veneris ad bibere, St. Augustine, Sermones 225, Cap. 4. Cf. 
Lat. Spr. 490, Dubois 275. In Rumanian, however, the supine 
was preserved: Tiktin 596. 
(2) GERUND. 
104. With the exception of the ablative form, the gerund 
came to be replaced by the infinitive, sometimes with a prep- 
osition: dat manducare, Lat. Spr. 490; guomodo potest hic 
nohis -urnem dare ad meuducare, R. 429; polestatem curare,   
necessitas tacere, etc., G. 3/ >. 
‘Lhe ablative form of the ,» -und became wore and more a 
substitute for the present partiiple: za miserrimus fui fugi- 
tando, Terence, Eun. V, 2, 8; Draeger II, 847-849, cites Livy, 
conciendo ad se multitudinem, and Tacitus, assurgens et popu- 
lando; hance Marcion captavit sic legendo, Hoppe 57; multa vidi 
errando, Densusianu 179; gui pertransivit benefaciendo et 
sanando, R. 432. Cf. R. 432-433. The ablative gerund was 
sometimes used for a conditional clause: cavendo salvi erimus, 
Hoppe 57. (3) GERUNDIVE. 
105. The gerundive was used as a future passive participle, 
with esse, from the third centvry on, in place of the future: 
filius hominis tradendus est, R. 433. Cf. R. 433-434, G. 386- 
388. Eventually, however, the gerundive was discarded, ex- 
cept in some standing phrases. 
(4) Furure Active PaRTICIPLE. 
106. The future active participle was probably rare in late 
Vulgar Latin, except when it was used with esse as a substitute 
for the future (as facturus sum). Sometimes, in a literary 
style, it took the place of a relative clause: faveant mihi pro 
ojus nomine pugnaturo, G. 389. Cf. G. 388-389.
-P-A-G-E-68
  50 An InTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [g 110 
(5) PRESENT PARTICIPLE. 
107. The present participle was kept, and was used as an 
adjective and as a noun: see Derivation, Suffixes for Adjectives, 
-ans. Sometimes it was employed periphrastically with esse. 
si ipse est ascendens in celos, G. 389. Writers occasionally 
substituted it for a relative clause: nemo mentiens plorat, G. 
388. Often, however, it was replaced by the ablative gerund: 
see Gerund above. 
(6) PERFECT PARTICIPLE. 
108. The perfect participle was kept, and, as will presently 
be seen, its use was greatly extended through new methods of 
torming the passive and the perfect tenses. Verbs that had 
no perfect participle were obliged to make one. : 
(7) Inrrntrtive. 
Io9. The perfect and passive infinitive forms eventually 
disappeared: see Voice and Tense below. In late writers, 
however, the perfect instead of the present infinitive is very 
common: R. 431-432 (malunt credidisse, etc.). 
110. The infinitive + accusative construction was more and 
more avoided from the third century on: G. 371-375. It was 
replaced sometimes by the passive, but often by a clause in- 
troduced by guia, quod, guoniam, ut, etc.: Eva vidisse de- 
scribitur, G. 371; legitur dixisse Deus, Regnier 63;— Bechtel 
112-115, dicent eo gued filii Israhel eas posuerint, sciens quod 
libenter haberetis hee cognoscere, credidit ei quia esset vere filius 
Dei, etc.; perspicue exposuit quod ager mundus sit, G. 377; 
nesciebat guia Jesus erat, G. 383; de corpore loguor, ut spiritu 
valeat non ignoramus, G. 385. Cf. G. 375-385, Bon. 659-671. 
Late writers, wishing to avoid vulgarisms, often misused 
the infinitive + accusative: G. 371-373.
-P-A-G-E-69
  § 112] AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. .- 51 
Ii. On the other hand, the infinitive assumed many new 
functions: see Supine and Gerund above. Cf. Hoppe 42-52: 
Linus regnare primus, amant ignorare, aliter exprimere non est, 
bonus et dicere et facere, etc. 
It was often used as a noun: fotum vivere anime carnis est, 
Hoppe 42; ipsum vivere accedere est, Regnier 106; per malum 
velle perdidit bonum posse, Regnier 106. 
it replaced the subjunctive with w¢ and similar construc- 
tions: vadent orare, Bechtel 117; revertitur omnis populus 
resumere se, Bechtel 117: valeamus assumi, G. 363; que legi 
digna sunt, G. 366; timuisti... facere, G. 368; non venit justos 
vocare, G. 370; venit aliguis audire, Regnier 73; male fecisti 
dare Spiritum sanctum, Regnier 74; mihi precepit hec logui, 
Bon. 673. Cf. G. 363-370, Regnier 73, Bon. 647, 671-675; 
P. Thielmann, Facere mit dem Infinitiv in Archiv III, 177. 
It took the place of a relative or indirectly interrogative 
clause after certain verbs: mesciendo gue petere, Venantius 
Fortunatus, cited in Zaz. Spr. 490; non habent unde reddere 
tbi, R. 430. 
b. VOICE. 
112. Under the influence of carus est, etc., amatus est came 
to mean ‘he zs loved’, etc. Hence amatus fuit signified ‘he 
was loved’: see Draeger I, 276ff. Then a whole passive in- 
flection was made up of the perfect participle + esse (in north- 
ern Italy fier’). The old passive forms—except the perfect 
participle and, to some extent, the gerundive—gradually 
disappeared from ordinary speech. Although authors kept 
up the classic practice as far as they were able, some examples 
of the popular formation may be culled from late writings: 
denuo factus filius fui, Hoppe 60; mors salva erit cum fuerit 
devorata, Hoppe 60; conjectus in carcerem fuerat, Hoppe 61; 
permissa est accedere, Regnier 63.
-P-A-G-E-70
52 . Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 117 
113. As the passive inflection disappeared, deponent verbs 
became active. Even in Classic Latin there is often hesita- 
tion, as in the case of frustrare frustrari, irascere irasci, etc. 
Many deponent verbs are used as active verbs by Petronius. 
In late vulgar speech mori, segui, etc., followed the same 
course. Cf. Bonnet 402-413. 
114. In the intermediate period the passive was frequently 
replaced by reflexive and active constructions. When “tera 
scribitur seemed archaic, and J/itfera scripta est vulgar, people 
said Jittera se scribit and litteram scribunt or litteram scribit 
homo: cf. facit se hora quinta, Bechtel 126; se sanare = sanari 
in the 4th century, Rom. XXXII, 455 (cf. Zs. XXXIII, 135); for 
the use of 4omo with the force of French on, see Per. 55, 25- 
c, MOOD. 
(1) IMPERATIVE. 
115. The imperative came to be restricted to the second 
person singular and plural of the present, the subjunctive 
being used for the third person, and also for the first. Dubois 
275 notes that the forms in ~o are very rare in Ennodius, who 
lived in southern Gaul in the fifth century. 
116. In negative commands the imperative was often re- 
placed by the subjunctive, by the indicative (found in Pir- 
minius), and in Italy, Gaul, and Dacia by the infinitive: Zaz 
Spr. 490. 
(2) SupByUNCTIVE. 
117. The subjunctive was limited to fewer functions, being 
replaced by the indicative in many constructions: cum hi 
omnes tam excelsi sunt, Bechtel 115; sé scire vultis guid facitis, 
Regnier 69; etc. At the end of the Vulgar Latin period it 
was probably used, in popular speech, very much as it is used
-P-A-G-E-71
  § 119] Aw InTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 53 
in the Romance languages. Late writers, while trying to 
follow the traditional practice, were less logical and evidently 
less spontaneous than Classic authors in their employment of 
the subjunctive. 
Sometimes the subjunctive was replaced by dedeo with the 
infinitive: debeant accipi = accipiantur, G. 418. Cf. § 72. 
Sometimes, after facia, its place was taken by the infinitive: 
Regnier 27-28, ecce Pater fecit Filium nasci de vergine, etc. 
Cf. § 111. 
In conditions not contrary to fact, in indirect discourse and 
indirect questions, in dependent clauses that are not adversa- 
tive nor dubitative, the indicative was often substituted for 
the subjunctive: R. 428-430, G. 355-357, Regnier 68-71. 
On the other hand, late writers often put the subjunctive 
where Classic authors would have put the indicative: G. 
357-362. 
118. The imperfect subjunctive gradually gave way to the 
pluperfect: this use is common in the Be//um Africanum (Lat. 
Spr. 489); cf. Sittl 133-134. It apparently began with dedu- 
isset, potuisset, voluisset, used freely for the imperfect by 
Gregory the Great (Sepulcri 226) and others, and with per- 
fect infinitives like ¢acuisse for tacere (Lat. Spr. 489: examples 
from the 4th century). 
The imperfect subjunctive ultimately went out of use, ex- 
cept in Sardinia. Writers of the third and fourth centuries 
show uncertainty in the use of it; R. 431 cites many exam- 
ples, as témui ne inter nos bella fuissent orta. 
In Rumanian the pluperfect subjunctive has assumed the 
function of a pluperfect indicative: canédse, etc. 
119. The perfect subjunctive was apparently confused with 
the future perfect indicative. It was thus preserved in Spain 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 122 
and in Italian and Rumanian dialects: cf. C. De Lollis in 
Bausteine 1, and V. Crescini in Zs, XXIX, 619; Tiktin 596. 
Cf. § 124. 
d. TENSE. 
120. The present and imperfect indicative and the present 
subjunctive remained, in general, with their old functions; 
see, however, § 117. For the imperfect and pluperfect sub- 
junctive, see § 118; for the perfect subjunctive, § 119. In the 
perfect, pluperfect, future, and future perfect indicative great 
changes took place, which led also to the formation of a new 
perfect and pluperfect subjunctive. 
(1) Tue Perrecr TENSES. 
121. In Classic Latin 4abeo with the perfect participle was 
used to express a lasting condition: Hannibal guia fessum 
militem preliis operibusque habebat, Part. perf. 376. It was 
used in the same way with adjectives: miserum habere, etc., 
Part. perf. 372 ff. Even in Classic Latin, however, the mean- 
ing of this locution began to shift to the perfect, or something 
akin to it: Cato the elder, guid Athenis exquisitum habeam, 
Part. perf. 516; Plautus, z//a omnia missa habeo, omnis res re- 
lictas habeo, Part. perf. 535; in legal phraseology, factum habeo, 
Part. perf. 537-538; Sallust, compertum ego habeo, Draeger I, 
295. The construction is very common in Cicero in a sense 
that closely approaches the perfect: satis habeo deliberatum, 
Lart. perf. 415; scriptum habeo, Part. perf. 422; rationes cogni- 
tas habeo, Densusianu 181; pecunias magnas collocatas habent, 
Draeger I, 294; cf. Part. perf. 405, 414-415, 423, 518-521, 
Draeger I, 294-295. 
122. In late Latin this compound often had simply a per- 
fect meaning: metuo enim ne ibi vos habeam fatigatos, Regnier 
ey 28; episcopum invitatum habes, Bon. 690. Cf. Bon. 689-691.
-P-A-G-E-73
§ 124] Aw INTRODUCTION: ro VuLGAR LaTIN. 55 
In popular speech it supplanted more and more the original 
perfect form, which was increasingly confined to’ its aorist 
function: Zaz, Spr. 489. In the Spanish peninsula, however, 
and to some extent in Italy, the old perfect meaning was not 
entirely lost. 
123. On the model of this new perfect, a compound plu- 
perfect was constructed: Cicero, guas in @rario conditas habe- 
bant, Draeger I, 294; si Dominum iratum haberes, Regnier 28; 
quam semper cognitam habui, Sepulcri 227. In the same way 
a future perfect was made: de Cesare satis dictum habebo, 
Part. perf. 537. Eventually an entire perfect inflection was 
built up with Zadere or, in the case of neuter verbs, with esse; 
its vogue began in Gaul in the fifth century, elsewhere in the 
sixth: Part. perf. 543, 541. 
124. The old perfect form remained in popular use, gener- 
ally with the aorist sense. Some late writers were fond of 
substituting for it cepz with an infinitive: Waters Ch. 70, etc. 
CE. § 72. ; 
The old pluperfect indicative became rarer, but still lingered, 
sometimes with its original sense, sometimes as a preterit, 
sometimes as a conditional. The preterit use occurs in dix- 
erat, ortaret, transalaret in the Gl. Reich.; auret, furet, pouret, 
etc., in the Old French Sainte Eulalie; boltier’ in the Old 
Italian Ritmo Cassinese (Zs. XXIX, 620); etc. The condi- 
tional function, which came down from the Classic Latin use 
in conditional sentences, was preserved in Spanish, in Pro- 
vengal, in some southern Italian dialects (notably in the Rosa 
Sresca aulentissima), and in the Italian fora < fueram. 
The old future perfect was apparently confused with the 
perfect subjunctive, and continued to be used, with the force 
of a future indicative or subjunctive, in the Spanish peninsula, 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    56 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 126 
in some dialects of Italy, and in Dacia: Sp. canéére, Old Sp. 
cantéro. Cf. § 119. 
The old pluperfect subjunctive was used as an imperfect: 
see § 118. 
(2) Furure and ConpDITIONAL. 
125. The Latin future was not uniform in the four conju- 
gations; the formation in —40, which was used in three of 
them and prevailed in two, was native, according to Mohl, 
Pr. Pers. Pi. 141-142, only in Rome and the immediate 
vicinity. Furthermore, the future in the first two conjuga- 
tions was suggestive of the imperfect, and in the other two, 
in late pronunciation, was liable to confusion with the pres- 
ent subjunctive and indicative. These causes or others made 
the future unpopular. As the tense became rare in speech, 
mistakes were made in writing: Vo&. I, 98; Regnier viii. The 
old audibo, dormibo forms were kept late (/uc/urum 161), and 
we find such errors as respondeam for respondebo ( Futurum 158). 
126. Classic Latin had some circumlocutions, such as fac- 
turus sum, delenda est, habeo dicere, which approached the 
meaning of the future. During the Empire there was a 
strong tendency to substitute these or other constructions 
for the future forms (such periphrases are particularly fre- 
quent in African church Latin) :— 
(1) The present indicative for the future is common in 
Cicero in conditional sentences: Lebreton 188-190. The sub. 
stitution became frequent in all sorts of constructions: nam 
st vis ecce modo pedibus duco vos ibi, Bechtel 112; cum volueris 
ire imus tecum et ostendimus tibi, Bechtel 112; pervidet, Bechtel 
90-91; guando corrigis, guando mutaris? cras, inguis, Regnier 
64; jam crastina non eximus, Sepulcri 225. Cf. Draeger I, 
286 ff.; Sepulcri 225~226.
-P-A-G-E-75
§ 129] Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 57 
(2) The future participle + esse was a favorite with late 
writers: sec et nos futuri sumus resurgere, Regnier 29. Cf. 
Bayard 256. See §§ 105, 106. 
(3) Velle and posse + infinitive were frequent: G. 423. 
Velle in this sense was preserved in Dacia; the oldest Ru- 
manian future is vot jurd or juré voit: Tiktin 599. 
(4) Debere + infinitive was another substitute. It was 
kept in Sardinian. 
(5) Vadere, ire, venire + infinitive were used also. 
127. The form that prevailed, however, was /adeo with the 
infinitive: In Classic Latin habeo dicere = habeo quod dicam, 
being so used by Cicero and many others; later, as in Sueto- 
nius, it means debeo dicere: Futurum 48 ff. Cf. Varro, De Re 
Rustica 1, 1, ut id mihi habeam curare; Cicero, Ad Famil. I, 
5, tantum habeo tibi polliceri; Lucretius VI, 711, in multis hoc 
rebus dicere habemus; Ovid, Trist. 1, 1, 123, mandare... habe- 
bam. In these senses it was very common in late writers: 
habes spectare, Hoppe 43; filius Dei mori habuit, Hoppe 44; 
probare non habent, Hoppe 44; non habent retribuere, R. 447; 
multa habeo dicere, R. 447; unde mihi dare habes aguam vivam, 
R. 448; exire habebai, R. 449; nec verba nobis ista dici habent, 
Regnier 28. Cf. R. 447-449. 
128. This Aadeo construction finally took the sense of a 
simple future: Tertullian, a/iter predicantur quam evenire ha- 
bent, cui dare habet Deus corpus, etc., Hoppe 44-45 ;— Servius, 
velle habet, Futurum 180;—St. Jerome, gui nasci habent, G. 
370;—St. Augustine, ‘o//ere haber, Densusianu 181; ef sic nihil 
habes invenire in manibus tuis, videre habetis, venire haber, etc., 
Regnier 28. It had become common in Italy by the sixth 
century. 
129. In the early stages of the Romance languages, or
-P-A-G-E-76
58 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 130 
possibly in the latest stage of Vulgar. Latin, the infinitive 
came to stand regularly, though not immutably, just before 
the habeo. Finally the two words were fused into one, but this 
union was not completed until after the beginnings of the 
Romance literatures, and in Portuguese it is not completed 
yet: Old Sp. cantaré or he cantar; separation is common in 
Old Provengal, and occurs in Old Italian; Pg. fazel-o-he. The 
earliest examples of the Romance future are found in Frede- 
garius: /ustinianus dicebat ‘daras’, Haag 54; addarabo, Haag 
55. See Morphology. 
130. On the model of this new form, an imperfect of the 
future, or conditional, was constructed. The phrase existed, 
ready for use, in Classic Latin, where it was employed with 
an implication of obligation or necessity. So it seems to be 
used by Tertullian, although sometimes with him the mean- 
ing borders on a real conditional: ~on traditus autem traduci 
habebas, ista civitas esterminari haberet, quod esset venturus et 
pati haberet, etc., Hoppe 43-45. 
In Classic Latin, in place of amassem in the conclusion of a 
conditional sentence, amaturus eram or fui was often used; 
and when amaturus sum was replaced by amare hadeo, it was 
natural that amaturus eram should give way to amare habe- 
bam. Furthermore, to match such a sentence as dicit guod 
venire habet, there was needed a past construction like azxit 
quod venire habebat or habuit; and corresponding to si possum 
venire habeo, something like s¢ potuissem venire habebam or 
habui was called for. 
St. Cyprian and St. Hilary seem to show a simple conditional 
use of the compound: guod lex nova dari haberet, Bayard 256, 
manifestari habebat, Bayard 257 ;—Herodes principes sacerdotum 
ubi nasci habebat Christus interrogat, Quillacq 116. There are 
sure examples from the fifth century on: Zaz. Spr, 489.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
  § 130] An InrRopucTIon TO VuLGAR LaTIN. 59 
The development of this form in the Romance languages 
was, in general, parallel to that of the future: see Mor- 
phology. 
The origin of the Rumanian conditional, cin/areasi, is not 
obvious; for a full discussion of the question, see H. Tiktin, 
Die Bildung des rumanischen Konditionalis in Zs. XXVIII, 691. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  Ill. PHONOLOGY. 
A. SYLLABICATION. 
131. The principles of syllabic division are rather difficult 
to establish. The Latin grammarians seem to have given no 
heed to actual speech, but to have followed the usage of Greek 
spelling, supporting it with purely theoretical considerations. 
Cf. S. 132-151. According to these writers, the syllable always 
ended in a vowel, or in a liquid or nasal followed by another 
consonant in the next syllable, or in half of a double consonant: 
a-ni-ma, no-ctem, pro-pter, a-mnis,; al-ter, in-fans; sic-cus, mit-to. 
The division of s+ consonant they regard as uncertain (a-s- 
trum); doubtless in reality the s was nearly syllabic, as in 
Italian. They add that etymological considerations often 
disturb the operation of the rule, as in 0b-/iviscor, etc. 
132. In point of fact, however, all consonant groups, except 
a mute + a liquid, made position and attracted the accent: 
perféc-tus, and not pérfe-ctus. It is altogether likely, then, that 
a consonant group, in the spoken language, was usually divided 
after the first consonant: moc-tem, prop-ter. A single consonant 
between vowels certainly went with the second: fo-si-tus. 
The group mute + liquid makes position in the older drama- 
tists: Naevius accents zntégram, Lat. Spr. 466. In the Classic 
poets it may or may not make position. Quintilian I, 5 recom- 
mends ¢énebre, vdlucres, pharetra, etc. In Vulgar Latin this 
combination almost invariably attracts the accent: cathédra. 
It is likely that in Old Latin the division came before the 
60
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  § 136] Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 61 
liquid, but subsequently, after the accent had become fixed on 
the preceding vowel, both consonants were carried over: ¢é- 
lub-ra, co-lib-ra, co-liu-bra. 
133. We have reason to believe that in closely connected 
speech a final consonant was carried over to the next word, if 
that word began with a vowel: cor exsultat=co r-exsultat. 
B. ACCENT. 
134. The Latin accent was probably from the beginning a 
stress accent. In the earliest stage of the language it appar- 
ently fell regularly on the first syllable: Corssen II, 892-906 ; 
S. 30-34; Franz. a1,13. The Classic Latin system —accord- 
ing to which the accent falls on the penult if that syllable is 
long, otherwise on the antepenult— developed as early as 
literature began, and remained, both in the literary and in the 
spoken language, through the Classic period; even after the 
distinctions of quantity were lost, the place of the accent was 
unchanged: bonitatem, cémpiito, delécto. 
The penult vowel before mute + liquid (cf. §132) normally 
has the stress in Vulgar Latin: cathédra, colibra, intégram. 
There seem to be a few exceptions to the rule: Old Fr. 
palpres < palpebras, Old Fr. poltre << *piullitra, and perhaps 
some others. 
1. PRIMARY STRESS. 
135. We have seen that Vulgar Latin regularly accents 
according to the Classic quantitative accentuation. There are, 
however, some cases in which the Classic principle fails to 
operate or the Classic stress has been shifted : — 
a. VOWELS IN HIATUS. 
136. Accented e and 4, when immediately followed by the 
vowel of the penult, became y, the accent falling on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    62 An IntRopuction To Vutcar Latin. [s 139 
following vowel: multéris> muljéris, S. 51, Lat. Spr. 468; 
puttolis> puydlis, C. L. L. X, 1889 (PVTEOLIS); so faréétes 
>parjétes>parétes C. 1, L. V1, 3714 (PARETES). This change 
seems to be due to a tendency to shift the stress to the more 
sonorous of two contiguous vowels: cf. O. Jespersen, Lehrbuch 
der Phonetik, p. 192. It was favored also by the analogy of 
mitlier, piteus, péries, etc., in which the vowel in hiatus is atonic. 
137. Accented ~, when immediately followed by the vowel 
of the penult, became w, the accent falling on the preceding 
syllable: bat(7)uére>* bdttuere > bittere; consiére>*cénsuere> 
conserve ; habitrunt>* hdbuerunt; teniéram >* ténueram. Here 
the shift was apparently due in each case to analogy, dattuere 
being influenced by dd¢tuo, consuere by cénsuo, habuerunt by 
hdbuit, tenueram by ténui, etc. 
138. Aside from these cases, hiatus seems to have had no 
effect on the accent in Latin. It is possible, however, that 
dios, stos, téos were sometimes pronounced duds, suds, tuds. 
b. COMPOUND VERBS. 
139. Verbs compounded with prefixes were generally re- 
constructed with the accent and the vowel of the simple verb, 
provided the composite nature of the formation was understood 
and the parts were recognized (cf. §31): déficit>* disfacit, 
displicet > * displécet, implicat > *implicat, réddidi > reddédi, 
réquirit > *requierit, rétinet > *reténet, etc. Cf. Gram. II, 
668-670. So calefacis, S. 56; condedit, perdedit, reddedit, tra- 
dedit, S. 54; addedi, adsteti, conteneo, crededi, inclausus, presteti, 
etc., Sepulcri 213-215. On the same plan new verbs were 
formed: *de-minat, re-négat, etc. 
  
17é regularly became 2; but if the preceding consonant was J, it was palatalized 
hence parétes, but * mulléres. Cf. § 225.
-P-A-G-E-81
§ 141] An InrRopuction To VuLGaR LarTIN. 63 
Récipit became * recipit, the composite character of the word 
being felt, although the compound was no longer associated 
with capere. 
In célligo and some others not even the composite nature 
was perceived, the simple verbs having become rare or having 
taken a different sense: /egere, for instance, came to be used 
only in the sense of ‘read.’ 
c. ILLAC, ILLIC. 
140. The adverbs ://dc, illic accented their last syllable 
through the analogy of Adc, hic. Priscian says “lic pro 
siecle; S. 42. 
d. FICATUM. 
141. There existed in Greek a word ovxwrdy (Pirson 40), 
‘figlike’, which was applied by cooks to a liver. It is found 
in late Latin in the form sycotum, which should properly have 
been pronounced syco/um ; for some unknown reason, perhaps 
under the influence of a vulgar *épdte for hépar, ‘liver’, it 
probably became * sécotum. 
Through this word there came into use the culinary 
terms ficdium, *ftcatum, *fécatum, *fécotum, *fécitum, all 
meaning ‘liver.’ /icatum, a simple translation of cuxwrdy, 
prevailed in Dacia, Retia, and northern Italy. écatum or 
fécotum, a fusion of ficdtum and *sécotum, was preferred in 
central and southern Italy. %catum, a cross between /¢catum 
and ficétum, was kept in Sicily and in the Spanish peninsula. 
Sardinia preserved both ficdtum and ficatum. Gaul had 
ficatum and fécatum; later, by a change of suffix, /écitum. 
See G. Paris in Miscellanea linguistica in onore di Graziadio 
Ascoli 41; H. Schuchardt in Zs. XXV, 515 and XXVIII, 435;

436.

e. NUMERALS. 
142. The numbers viginti, triginta, gquadraginta, quinguaginta, 
etc., were sometimes accented on the antepenult: Consentius 
mentions a faulty pronunciation /réginfa, Keil V, 392, lines 
4-5; guarranta occurs in a late inscription, Voz. II, 461, 
Pirson 97. See M. Ihm in Archiv VII, 69-70; G. Rydberg 
in Mélanges Wahlund, 337. The shift was probably due to a 
natural tendency to differentiate the numerals from one 
another: compare the floating accent in English shirteen, 
fourteen, etc. 
d. GREEK WORDS. 
143. The accentuation of Greek words was varied. Some- 
times the Greek stress was preserved, sometimes the word was 
made to conform to the Latin principle. 
(1) GREEK OXYTONES. 
144. Greek oxytones, when borrowed by Latin, were 
stressed according to the Latin system: 8paxpx > drdch( i) ma, 
émistodn > epistiila —dla, haprds > ldmpa(s), pnxavy > maéc(h)- 
ina, wapaBorj > pardbiila, reparis > pirata, cnacpos > spdsmus, 
tamewos >*tapinus. Cf. S. 42ff., Claussen 809. 
Svxwrdv, however, apparently stressed the first syllable: 
see § 141. 
(2) GREEK PAROXYTONES. 
145. Greek paroxytones were mostly accented according to 
the quantity of the penult: ypapiov>grdphium, xupapa>céméra, 
payda > mdgida, rahdpn > palma, worvrovs > Polipus,' roppipa 
>purpiira, pupérpa> phdrétra or pharétra (cf. § 134). 
IIrirdvn (> ptiséna) >It. tisdéna, puddrn (> phidla)> It. fda, 
xor<pa (> chdléra) >It. coléra, etc.,. may represent popular 
terms borrowed by ear from the Greek, with the Greek stress,   
1Occasionally the accent was kept by doubling the consonant, as folippus. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
§ 149] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 65 
but it is more likely that the Italian forms are book-words 
with a shifted accent. : 
Cf. S. 42ff., Claussen 810-811. 
146. The ending —a was at first generally assimilated to 
the Latin a: PiBrAia> diblia, Bac pypia> blasphémia, éxxdyoia 
> ec(c)lésia, toropia> historia, ontia> sépia, ovppovia > sym- 
phénia. Later a fashionable pronunciation —/a, doubtless 
favored by Christian influence, penetrated popular speech 
(copia > sophia, etc.) and produced a new Latin ending —/a, 
which was used to form new words: see Derivation, Suffixes 
for Nouns. Cf. Claussen 812. The pronunciations me/odia, 
etc., and sophia, etc., are attested: S. 55~56. 
The endings —eia, —eiov sometimes became —éa -ia, —éum 
ium, sometimes —ca, —eum: Badaveiov> bé/néum, xovwrdov > 
conopeum —éum —ium, mraréia> platea platéa. Cf. Claussen 
813-814. 
(3) GREEK PROPAROXYTONES. 
147. The treatment of proparoxytones is complicated. Cf. 
S. 42-49, Claussen 814-821, Gram. I, 35, § 17, A. Thomas in 
Rom. XXXI, 2-3. Late Latin grammarians mention a pro- 
nunciation of Greek words with the Greek accent (S. 42), but 
their statements are too vague to be of use. 
A few early borrowed words perhaps show the Old Latin 
accentuation: kumdpuooos >* ciparissos > cupressus. Cf. Claus- 
sen 809. 
148. When the penult was short, the accent remained un- 
changed: yéeveots > génésis, xdhapos > céldmus, Kddados > cola- 
phus, apecBitepov > presbjtérum (with a new nominative 
présbyter). 
149. When the penult vowel was in position, it took the 
accent: dBvocos > abjssus, Bdnticpa > baptisma, tadavtov > 
taléntum.  
-P-A-G-E-84
66 An InrRopuction ro Vutear Latin. Ls 153 
"Eyxavoroy, however, became both encéustum and éncaustum. 
Occasionally the consonant group was simplified and the 
accent remained: xapudpvdAdov > * gardfiilum. 
150. When the penult vowel was long and not in position, 
it apparently took the accent in book-words but not in words 
learned by ear (S. 48-49): xdyndos > camélus —llus, képuvos > 
caminus, xpoxdderos > crocodilus, pddAawa > ballena; &yKipa > 
ancora, Bddopnuos > bldsphémus (Prudentius), Bovripov > 
bityrum (AXmilius Macer), “ldxwBos >/écobus, cédivov > * sé- 
linum. 
Some words have both pronunciations: ¢i8wdov > iddlum 
(both in Prudentius: Zaz. Spr. 466), epnpnos > erémus ertmus 
{Prudentius), ctvami> sinapi sinapi. 
e. OTHER FOREIGN WORDS. 
151. Some words borrowed from other languages kept their 
original accent, contrary to Latin rules (S. 49): Umbrian 
Pisaurum> It. Pésaro, etc.; Celtic Baidécasses> Fr. Bayeux, 
Durécasses>¥r. Dreux, Tricasses>Fr. Troyes, etc., Dottin 103. 
152. Germanic words were apparently made to conform to 
Latin types: Higo Higun> Higo Hugénem> Fr. Hies Hun; 
Kluge 500. 
2. SECONDARY STRESS. 
153. As far as we can determine the rhythm of Vulgar 
Latin, judging from phonetic changes and from semi-popular 
late Latin verse, it consisted in a tolerably regular alternation 
of accented and unaccented syllables. Thus Sedulius, at the 
beginning of the fifth century, writes: 
Beatus ductor séculi 
Servile cérpus induit, 
Ut carne cdrnem liberdéns 
Ne pérderét quos céndidit.
-P-A-G-E-85
  § 156] AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 67 
The secondary stress, then, fell on the second syllable 
from the tonic: cupiditésus, felicitétem; dilorésa, lacrimésa; 
Césarém, Géllias. In some derivatives, however, the root 
syllable may have received an irregular stress through the 
analogy of the primitive: * érboricéllus. 
In late formations ¢ or 7 in hiatus did not count as a sylla- 
ble: *cominitiare. 
154. When the secondary stress preceded the tonic, it was 
strong, and the vowel bearing it was apparently treated as an 
accented vowel: *amicitatem> Pr. amisfét; so, in Italian, 
Buédlognino beside Boldégna, Fidrentino beside Firénze, vétto- 
vdglia beside vittéria, 
When it fo//owed the tonic, it was weak, but probably the 
vowel bearing it had more force than a wholly unaccented 
final vowei: sdécéri> Pr. sézer, placitim > Pr. plach; but cléri- 
cum > Pr. clérgue while clércum> Pr. clerc, célaéphiim > Pr. 
c6lbe while co?’ pum > Pr. colp. 
155. In many cases the intervening vowel fell out or lost 
its syllabic value. Then the primary and the secondary ac- 
cent were brought together, and the secondary was shifted or 
lost: *pardbulére>*pardulére >* pdrauldre, cdlidis> céldus, 
Slits > filius. 
UNSTRESSED WORDS. 
156. Short, unemphatic words, in Latin as in other lan- 
guages, had no accent, and were attached as additional 
syllables to the beginning or end of other words (S. 38-39): 
non-dmat, dma-me, te-videt, db-tibi, cave-fdcias, circum-litora 
(Quintilian I, 5). Many words, especially prepositions and 
conjunctions, as well as some adverbs and pronouns, were 
used only as enclitics or proclitics.
-P-A-G-E-86
    68 An InTRODUCTION To VuLGAR LATIN. [§ 160 
157. If such particles had more than one syllable, they 
tended to become monosyllabic: unstressed magis, perhaps 
influenced by f/us, became *mais and *mas. A dissyllabic 
proclitic beginning with a vowel seems to have regularly lost 
that vowel: lum videt>’lu’ videt; ecce hic>’cic (but éece hie 
> eccic); eccum istum>’cu’ ist’ (but éccum tstum> eccw’tstu’). 
For elision, see Franz. a II, 73-79, 379-390. 
158. Words sometimes stressed and sometimes unstressed 
tended to develop double forms: 7//és> ¢/las and * as, sia> 
sda and sa, CE£. S. 56-57. 
C. QUANTITY. 
159. We must distinguish between the quantity of vowels 
and the quantity of syllables. Every Latin vowel was by 
nature either long or short; how great the difference was we 
do not know, but we may surmise that in common speech it 
was more marked in stressed than in unstressed vowels. A 
syllable was long if it contained (1) a long vowel or a diph- 
thong or (2) any vowel + a following consonant. If, however, 
the consonant was final and the next word began with a vowel, 
the consonant, in connected speech, was doubtless carried over 
to the next syllable and did not make position: see §133. 
For the syllabication of mute + liquid, see §§132, 134. 
1. POSITION. 
160. In some of the Romance languages position checked 
the development of the preceding vowel, and it is probable that 
the beginnings of this differentiation go back to Vulgar Latin 
times: fa-rem>Old Fr. per, par-tem>Fr. part. Mute + liquid 
did not prevent the development: fa-trem>Fr. pere. Neither, 
apparently, did a final consonant (cf. §133): sa-2> Fr. sed.
-P-A-G-E-87
  § 163] AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 69 
Compare Italian fiero << fé-rus, ferro < fér-rum ; petto < péec- 
tus, pietra< pé-tra, fiel(e) < fé-l; — fuore < fo-ris, collo < cot- 
lum; corpo <cor-pus, cuopre <* co-p’rit, cuor(e) <co-r. 
161. Early in the Empire ss after diphthongs and long 
vowels was apparently reduced to s (S, 112-120): cassus > 
casus, caussa > causa, formossus > formosus, glossa > glosa, 
missit (S. 118: mIssir) > misit. This did not occur, however, 
in the contracted endings —dsse —dssem etc., —€sse —éssem etc., 
—isse —issem etc. 
Similarly one 7 was lost in ma@//o, millia (but not in mille : 
Pompeius, S. 127), d/lo, paullum., 
162. In Latin texts there is much confusion of single and 
double consonants, especially before the accent: da/(/)@ena, 
buc(c)ina, cot(t)idie,! ec(c)lesia,’ glut(t)ire, mut(t)ire, tap(p)éte, 
ves(s)ica, etc. Cf. S, 111-132, Stolz 223-224. In some words 
this may result merely from bad spelling; but often it must 
represent an actual difference in pronunciation, as seems to be 
the case with the doublet ci#o>Sp. cedo, citto (C. ZL. VIII, 
11594) >It. cetto. Cf. § 163. 
163. Many words certainly had two forms, doubtless be- 
longing to different Latin dialects, — one with a long vowel + 
a single consonant, the other with a short vowel+a double 
consonant: brachium bracchium ; biica biicca; camélus caméllus, 
where we have perhaps only a change of suffix, cf. §42; cipus 
cippus; ciipa, ciippa, giving Sp. cuba, Fr. cuve, It. cupola and 
Sp. copa, Fr. coupe, It. coppa; glito glitto; hoc erat hoce erat, 
S. 125-126 (Velius Longus and Pompeius); /ipiter Jiippiter; 
perhaps J/ifera littera; mucus miiccus; pupa plippa; stiipa 
stiippa; sticus sticcus. Cf. Stolz 222-225. 
  
1 The antiquity of double ¢ is attested by an old inscription: Lexigue ror. 
2 The single c, which prevailed in Romance, is common in Greek and Latin manu 
scripts: S. 129.
-P-A-G-E-88
Jo AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [gs 164 
To these may perhaps be added: bdca bacca; bisium 
*bassium (>It. bascio); braca bracca; *bitis (< Botms) * bitttis 
(>It. botte); caseus *céisseus (>It. cascio); chine(<xdvq) 
channe; conservamus conservammus, Vok. I, 261; jubemus 
Jubemmus, Vok. 1, 261 (iubimmus iobemmus); litus Tittus; 
misi * missi (>It. messi). 
Beside the two forms indicated, there was occasionally a 
third, seemingly a cross between the other two, having both 
the long vowel and the double consonant: anguila (>Sp. 
anguila) + anguilla =* anguilla (> It. anguilla); * stéla (>Old 
Fr. esteile: cf. Lexigue 95-98) + stéd/a (>It. dialect stella) = 
* stella (>It. stella; cf. Vok. I, 339, stilla); strena (> Old Fr. 
estreine) + stréinna =* strénna (> It. strenna, Sic. strinna); tota 
(>Sp. toda) + /otta (Keil V, 392!)=*totta (>Pr. ota, Fr. 
toute).? So perhaps Diomedes’ /ittera: Archiv XIV, 403. 
164. In late Latin inscriptions and manuscripts a consonant 
was sometimes doubled before 7 or u- acgua, bellua, frattre, 
lattrones, mattrona, strennuor, suppra, suppremis, tennuis. Cf. 
S. 122, Stolz 223. This doubling indicates in most cases a 
local pronunciation, prevalent in Africa or in Italy. Accord- 
ing to F. G. Mohl, Zs. XXVI, 612, a consonant was doubled 
before 7 and z in the old Italic dialects: compare the Italian 
doubling in fadéro, tenne, volle, etc. In agua the double con- 
sonant, attested by inscriptions and by Christian poets, was 
very widespread and prevailed in Italy, Retia, and a large 
part of Gaul. See Clara Hiirlimann, Dre Entwicklung des 
lateinischen aqua in den romanischen Sprachen, reviewed by 
Meyer-Liibke in Z7d/t, XXIV, 334. 
  
1Consentius: “ per adjectionem litter Zottwm pro toto.” Cf. Gram. I, 488, § 5473 
Lexigue 98-104. According to Lat. Spr. 485, tottus was used by Pirminius. 2 For * fiittus see § 204(2).
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  § 166] An InrRopUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. a1 
2. VOWEL QUANTITY. 
165. Originally, perhaps, long and short vowels were dis. 
tinguished only by duration, the vowels having, for instance, 
the same sound in /é/us and /détus, in débet and rédit, in vinum 
and minus, in nomen and novus, in ddlus and miiltus. However 
this may have been, long and short ¢, ¢, 0, and w were event- 
ually differentiated, the short vowels being open while the 
long were close: vendo sentio, pinus piper, solus solet, mulus 
gula. That is, for the vowels of brief duration the tongue 
was not lifted quite so high as for those held longer. Later, 
in most of the Empire, 7 and wv were allowed to drop still lower, 
and became eand a: see §§201, 208. In the case of a, which 
is made with the tongue lying flat in the bottom of the mouth, 
there was no such differentiation. 
According to Meyer-Liibke, Zaz. Sgr. 467, the distinction 
was clear by the first century of our era. In Vo&. I, 461, II, 
146, III, 151, 212, is given the testimony of grammarians, all 
of later date; in Vo&. II, 1 ff., the evidence of inscriptions. 
Marius Victorinus, about 350 a. p., distinguishes two e-sounds 
(S. 174, 182); Pompeius, about 480, cites Tertullian for an ¢ 
similar to 7, and several fifth century grammarians plainly dis- 
tinguish ¢ from ¢ (S. 176, 182); from the second century on @ 
was often used for ¢ in inscriptions (S. 183-184). Terentianus 
Mautus, by 250, distinguishes 9 from ¢ (S. 175, 211), and so 
do other grammarians (S. 211). Writers do not clearly dis- 
tinguish Zand #, until Consentius, in the fifth century (S. 193); 
é, however, is often used for 7 in inscriptions, as menus, etc., 
and 7 for e, as minses, etc. (S. 195, 200-201). None of the 
grammarians apparently distinguished w and u, but o is used 
for w in inscriptions, as ocsor, secondus, etc. (S. 216-217). 
166. In open syllables, if the word is used in verse, the 
quantity of the vowel is in general easily ascertained. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  72) An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 167 
closed syllables and in words not used by poets the quantity 
is in many cases doubtful; but it is sometimes given by gram- 
marians, sometimes marked in inscriptions, sometimes con- 
jectured from the etymology, and often shown by subsequent 
developments in the Romance languages. Occasionally the 
testimony conflicts: some inscriptions have carIssimo, etc., 
others KARESSIMO, etc. (S. 98, 99); Aulus Gellius prescribes 
dictum, but an inscription has pIcrarori (S. 105); Classic 
Latin offers /rigidus (cf. rrictpa, S. 105), but the Romance 
languages, except Spanish, require a short 7; some Romance 
forms support Classic zé#rire, others demand #%; andécim, 
lividus, ultra were apparently pronounced also with short w 
(S. 81-82); Fr. Zoir calls for *glirem beside glirem. 
a. VOWELS IN HIATUS. 
167. Vowels in hiatus with the last syllable offer difficulties. 
The Classic rule that a vowel before another vowel is short is 
not absolute even for verse, and the practice of poets was not 
always in accordance with spoken usage. Dies, fius kept 
their originally long vowel, attested by inscriptions (ples 
plvs plivs, S. 93; cf. Substrate II, 101-102); so ci’, proved 
by old inscriptions; and, at least in part, fa, found in inscrip 
tions, in Plautus, and in Ennius (S. 93): these preserved their 
close vowel in the Romance languages. 
Naturally long vowels, then, probably kept their original 
quantity in hiatus. Naturally short vowels doubtless had 
their regular development also: déus = deus, although we do 
find the spellings diws and mius (S. 187); diio> diii= dui; 
via= via. Ata later stage, after v had become o (see §§16s5, 
208), ary 9 before « was apparently differentiated into 9: 
ovum> oum (cf. § 324) >oum (and also evum, with a restora- 
tion of the v through the plural ova); siius>sous>sous (S.
-P-A-G-E-91
  § 170] An IntTRopUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 13 
216, Pirson 16). There may have been other special varia- 
tions in different countries. Cf. §217. 
For a different theory, see Gram. I, 246-248. For another 
still, see A. Horning in Zs. XXV, 341. 
168. Quiéa, used for guod in late Latin, had a peculiar 
development from the sixth century on: before a vowel it was 
pronounced gwz’ and was confused with guid, which had begun 
to assume the functions of guod (see $$ 69, 82; cf. Franz. a I, 
352-355); before a consonant, under the influence of gua and 
gua(m), it became gua. Cf. Hranz. a II, 357-390; J. Jean- 
jaquet, Recherches sur Porigine de la conjonction ‘que’ et des 
formes romanes éqguivalentes, 1894. 
169. Pliere was supplanted in popular usage by p/dvere 
(Lat. Spr. 468). livia, on the other hand, gave way to 
*ploja. Cf. § 208,(4). 
b. LENGTHENING BEFORE CONSONANTS. 
170. According to some grammarians, vowels were length- 
ened before 7, as in &/us, major. The Romance languages, 
however, point to open vowels in fejor, Zroja. The apparent 
contradiction disappears if we accept the statement of Teren- 
tianus Maurus, 250 A. D., who says (S. 104) that the vowels 
in these words were short, but the 7 was doubled — that is, 
there was a glide from the vowel to the 7, which prolonged the 
first syllable: not péjor, Troja, but peiyor, Trdija. We find in 
inscriptions such spellings as Adiax, coiiux, cuiius, eiius, 
maitorem, etc.: S. 236, Pirson 74. Quintilian states that 
Cicero preferred azio, Maziam, with double 7 (S. 236). Velius 
Longus adds that as Cicero approved of Azéacem, Maiiam, we 
should write Zroiia also (S. 236). Priscian analyzes pejus,

  14 AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 172 
171. When z was followed by a fricative (f, 7, s, or v), if 
regularly fell early in Latin, and the preceding vowel wa: 
lengthened by compensation: césor, cojugi, coventio, iferi. But 
inasmuch as occurs before /, 7, and v only at the end of pre- 
fixes, it was usually restored by the analogy of the full forms 
con-, in—: so infantem through indignus, etc.; conjungere 
through conducere, etc.; convenire through continere, etc. Be- 
fore s, however, ” occurred in the middle of many words, and 
the fall was permanent, the 7 being restored only in com- 
pounds before initial s- cosul, isula, mésis, sposus; but insig- 
nare. Cf. § 311. 
It is altogether likely that the » fell through nasalization 
of the vowel: consul consul cosul cosul. If so, all trace of the 
nasality disappeared, but the length and the close quality of 
the vowel remained. Cf. Archiv XIV, 400. 
Romance and late Vulgar Latin words with ms (except in 
compounds as above) are either learned terms or new forma- 
tions: so fensare, beside the old popular *fésare. 
See S. 77-78; for the usage of Cicero and others, S. 86; 
for inscriptions, S. 89. 
172. (1) Vowels were apparently lengthened before yf: 
guingue, sanctus, etc. Cf. S. 78; for inscriptions, S. go. 
(2) Before gx vowels were lengthened according to Priscian 
(S. 91), and inscriptions mark length in dignus, regnum, signum 
(cf. sigillum), S. gt. The Romance languages, however, 
call for dignus, lignum, pignus, pugnus, signum. Priscian, who 
wrote in the sixth century, is a very late authority, and some 
philologists regard the passage in question as an interpola- 
tion of still later date; still the evidence of the inscriptions 
remains. According to Meyer-Liibke (Gram. I, 54, Lat. Spr. 
467), the vowel was lengthened, but only after 7, 7 had be- 
come #, w, so that the result was 7, @, not 7, @; cf. BENEGNVS  
-P-A-G-E-93

in C. Z. Z. XII, 2153, which is doubtless equivalent to the 
BENIGNus of C. Z. Z. XII, 722. This seems a very plausible 
explanation. C. D. Buck, however, in the Classical Review 
XV, 311, prefers to regard such forms as dignus, in so far as 
they existed at all, as due to a vulgar or local pronunciation. 
c. DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OLD QUANTITY. 
173. The difference in quantity was probably greater and 
more constant in accented than in unaccented vowels. The 
distinctions in quality, resulting from the original quantity, 
remained, in stressed syllables, through the Latin period and 
developed further in the Romance languages; in unaccented 
syllables the distinctions were doubtless weaker, and were 
often obliterated. 
174. The old quantity itself was lost, for the most part 
during the Empire. It seems to have disappeared from un- 
stressed syllables by the third or fourth century; but confusion 
set in as early as the second. The nominative singular —is 
and the plural 2s were confounded by 150 a. p. (S. 75), and 
@ was often used for @ in inscriptions (S. 183-184: dene, etc.). 
Terentianus Maurus, about 250, tells us that az is short in 
unaccented syllables, as in aut (S. 66). Other grammarians 
warn against quantitative mistakes. Servius says, in the fourth 
century, “misere dativus est non adverbium,” etc. (S. 226). 
The poetry of Commodian, in the third or fourth century, 
seems to observe quantity in stressed and to neglect it in 
unstressed syllables, and we find numerous metrical errors 
in other late poets: cf. J. Cornu, Versbau des Commodian 
in Bausteine 576. 
On the other hand, Latin words borrowed by the Britons, 
mostly in the third and fourth centuries, show, through a 
shift of accent, the preservation of quantity in post-tonic 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  76 An InrRopuction To Vutcar Latin. [s 176 
syllables: Loth 72, 65. Moreover, Latin words borrowed by 
Old High German indicate a retention of long ¢ and u before 
the accent: Franz. 
It is possible that the quantity of unstressed vowels was 
better. kept in the provinces than in Italy. 
175. In accented syllables there are sporadic examples of 
confusion by the second century, as @gues for égues in 197 
(S. 225); but probably the disappearance of the old distinc- 
tion was not general before the fourth and fifth centuries, and 
not complete before the end of the sixth. Servius, in the 
fourth century, criticizes Rdéma (S. 106). St. Augustine de- 
clares that “Afree aures de correptione vocalium vel produc- 
tione non judicant” (Zaz. Spr. 467). Pompeius and other 
grammarians blame the confusion of eguus and éguus (S. 107, 
178). Much late poetry disregards quantity altogether. 
On the other hand, Latin words borrowed by the Britons 
from the second to the fifth century, but mostly in the third 
and fourth, show the preservation of the quantity of stressed 
vowels: Loth 64. Latin words in Anglo-Saxon, taken over in 
the fifth and sixth centuries, retain the quantity of vowels that 
bear the accent: Pogatscher. The Latin words in Old High 
German, too, distinguish by quantity 7 and 7, é and 4 6 and 4, 
uzand w; é, 6 are distinguished by quality also, for ¢>? while 
é>e or 7, 6>d or 6 while d>0- Franz. 
d. DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW QUANTITY. 
176. At the end of the Latin period a new system of quan- 
tity grew up, entirely diverse from the old, and based on the 
situation of the vowel. In most of the Empire accented 
vowels not in position were pronounced long, all other vowels 
short: sdncto valés, vindd vents, dixt plicas, formas fori, friictiis  
-P-A-G-E-95
  § 178] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. Ta 
gulé; ca-the-dra té-né-bras; co-r mé-l no-s ré-m tré-s. In Spain 
and in some parts of Gaul, a// stressed vowels were appar- 
ently long: /émpiis, porta. 
This new pronunciation doubtless sprang up with the dis- 
appearance of the old, which it displaced. Meyer-Liibke in 
Gram. I, 561-562, says that the development was different 
and independent in the several Romance languages; in Zinf. 
103-104, he describes it as common to all, but as posterior to 
the fifth century; in Zaz. Spr. 467, he puts it in the fourth 
and fifth centuries. 
177. It is likely that these new long vowels were pro- 
nounced in most regions with a circumflex intonation, which 
in the transition from Latin to the Romance languages re- 
sulted in diphthongization in a large part of the Empire, par- 
ticularly in northern Gaul: vézis> It. vient, gila> Old Fr. 
goule, cr >It. cuor, nés> Fr. nous, trés>Old Fr. treis. Por- 
tugal, southern Gaul, Lombardy, and Sicily apparently did 
not participate in this early breaking; and the conditions of 
diphthongization were very diverse in different localities. 
The vowels most affected were ¢ and @. 
An isolated example, perhaps only a blunder, occurs in an 
inscription made a little before 120 a. pD.: Ni£pos, beside 
NeEpotis (A. Zimmermann in Zs. XXV, 735). In 419 A. D. 
we find vosir for odz¢t (S. 213). 
D. VOWELS. 
178. Latin had the vowels 4, 4 %, 6, %, and in unaccented 
syllables before a labial (as in Aroxumus) a short #; further- 
more, the groups @, aw, ew, ce, also uz. We have seen (§ 165) 
that 2, 7, 6, # were pronounced close, and 4, #, 6, % open, while 
@ was not affected by quantity. We shall see presently
-P-A-G-E-96
  78 Aw InrRopucTion TO VULGAR LarTIN. [g 182 
(§§ 209, 210) that @>¢and ce>e, while au, ew generally 
remained du, éu (cdutus, céu), and ui (as in cu?) was wi. 
179. The foreign vowels of borrowed words were assimil- 
ated in some fashion to the Latin system. In the few Celtic 
words that were taken over there are no important peculiari- 
ties. In the Germanic vocabulary there is not much to be 
noted: az in words adopted early apparently became a, as 
*waidanjan>* wadaniare; eu (or iu) appears in ¢reuwa (or 
triuwa), which became *tvewa; iu is found in skiuhan> 
* skivare. 
The history of Greek vowels is very complicated :— 
GREEK VOWELS. 
180. According to Quintilian (Edon 64-65), the Greek 
letters were sounded as in Greek. This pronunciation was 
doubtless the ideal of people of fashion, but popular speech 
substituted for unfamiliar vowels the sounds of the vernacu 
lar. The inconsistencies in this substitution arise partly from 
the different dates at which words were borrowed, partly from 
the channel (written or oral) through which they came, and 
partly from the various pronunciations of the vowels in the 
several Greek dialects. 
181. A, long or short, was pronounced 4: ®aous > Phasis, 
padrayé > phalanx. 
182. was in Greek originally a long ¢, but early in our 
era it became z In book-words it was assimilated to Latin 
é: drobixn > apotheca > It. bottega; so in some late words, as 
Bracdnpia > blasphémia > It. bestemmia. In words of more 
popular origin it often had the Greek open sound: éx«Ayoia > 
eclésia; onria>sapia, but also sépia>It. seppia; oxnvy > 
scena scena. Late words often show 7: doxytis > ascitis, Per.

184. /, at least in the principal dialects, seems to have had 
a very open sound, even when long. In book-words it was 
assimilated to Latin 7: ¢ipds > phimus; piros > philus. In 
popular words 7 apparently became 4, later ¢ or ¢; 7 apparently 
became @, later often ¢- dpOpirucds > arthriticus > It. artetico;

civami> sinapi> It. senape; etc. Cf. Claussen 855-857. 
185. Q was probably @, but perhaps dialectically ¢ (cf. dpa 
> hora). In book-words it was assimilated to Latin 6: pdxy 
>phoca. In popular words it apparently became g, occasion- 
ally wu: yAdooa> It. chigsa; rroxds > It. pitgcco; rpoxrys > 
tricta. Cf. Claussen 869-870. 
186. O in most dialects was ¢ In book-words it was 
assimilated to Latin 0: xédwos > cophinus; dppaves > rphanus. 
In popular words it was generally close, but sometimes open, 
and occasionally the same word had both pronunciations: 
éudpyn > amiirca; oxy > doga> It. doga, etc.; Kopp > gummi; 
éopy >? It. orma; roppipa > pirpiira; répvos > ornu > It.

torno, etc.;— Kbyxn > concha; ortpddos > siréppus; xop84 >

187. Y was originally pronounced w; later in Attic and 
Ionic it became #, which subsequently, in the 9th or 1oth 
century, was unrounded into 2. 
In the older borrowed words, perhaps taken mostly from 
Doric (Claussen 865), v regularly was assimilated to Latin w 
(S. 219-221): Bipoa> biirsa; xpinty> criipta; KipBn> ciimba; 
pidros > millus; piptos > miirta, App. Pr.; wikos> biixus. It. 
dusta seems to represent a peculiar local development: cf. 
buxida (= pyxis) in Theodorus Priscianus and in glosses, 
Lat. Spr. 468. Cf. Zefurus, Audollent 536; “c¢ymum non tu- 
mum,” App. Pr.; Olumpus, etc., Pirson 39. In tpiravy> 
triitina the v was shortened. In dyxipa> ancora, oripaé > 
storax, and a few other words the v for some reason became 0; 
these probably have nothing to do with xaAvmrpa > It. calofta, 
kpvrrn > It. grotta, wX8os > It. mofo, in which the @ is a later 
local development. For some words we find an occasional spell- 
ing @, which may represent a Greek dialect pronunciation be- 
tween w and #: yipos> gyrus gerus; Mvoia> Mysia Mesia; etc. 
Towards the end of the Republic, cultivated people adopted 
for Greek words the Ionic-Attic pronunciation, which is gen- 
erally represented, in the case of v, by the spelling y. Cicero 
says: “ Burrum semper Ennius, nunquam Pyrrhum” (S. 221). 
According to Cassiodorus, w is the spelling in some words, y 
in others (S. 221). In the 4f/. Pr. we find: “Marsyas non 
Marsuas,” “myrta non murta,” “porphyreticum marmor non 
purpureticum marmor,”? “tymum non tumum.” Among the 
common people the unfamiliar 7% was assimilated to 7 The 
spelling 7 occurs sometimes before Augustus: dyxvua > ancilia; 
‘Odvoceia > Odissia, Livius Andronicus; ’OdAvoce’s > Ulixes. 
In inscriptions we find mésteriis, etc., S. 221. The App. Pr

has “gyrus non girus.” Cf. giro, misterii, etc., Bechtel 76-77; 
giret, Audollent 535; /7igia, etc., Pirson 39. This 4, if long, 
was usually pronounced 7; if short, 7, which became ¢: ydpos 
>It. giro; wipa> It. cima; cipyyya> It. scilinga ;—xv«vos > 
It. cecino; etc. For cixwrdv, see § 141; ytpos >It. gesso is 
probably a local development. Kv frequently became gui: 
kooxwry > cologuinta, etc.; cf. § 223. 
The modern Greek pronunciation is represented by some 
Romance words: dpvdov>It. amido; Brlavris> It. disante; 
TUpmavoy > Fr. timbre; etc. 
Cf. Claussen 860-869. 
188. AZ originally became ai, as in Alas> Aiax, Maia > 
Maia; \ater @ (as in aiyis > e@gis), which came to be pro- 
nounced ¢, as in Aiftoria > thiopia Ethiopia, Cf. Claussen 
871-872. 
189. AYV>au: Onoavpés> thesaurus. Cf. Claussen 872-873. 
190. £/ was doubtless originally pronounced e7 in Greek, 
then, from the sixth to the fourth century B.c., ¢; finally, 
about the third century, Z except before vowels. In Latin, a 
became 7 before consonants, @ or 7 before vowels; «iSwAov > 
idolum; rapd8acos > paradisus; meaparys > pirata; — Krad > 
Clio; Mysea> Medea. In —aos —ea —eov, the penult was often 
shortened: Aarcia > platéa. Cf. Claussen 873-875. 
I91. HY generally became ez: Etpos > Eurus.. Such forms 
as “erméneumata non erminomata” (App, Pr.), toreomatum 
from répeyua, may be merely misspellings: cf. Clepatra for 
Cleopatra. Some Romance forms show #: KéAevopa>? It.

194. A regularly remained unchanged in the greater part 
of the Empire: caput, dare, factum, latus, manus, patrem, tantus. 
But in Gaul, especially in the north, it probably had a forward 
pronunciation tending somewhat toward ¢: cf. crepere (probably 
for crepare) in Gl. Reich.; and agnetus (for agndtus ?) in Frede- 
garius, Haag 6. 
195. Some words had a peculiar development: — 
(1) Beside adécrem the Romance languages seem to postulate alecrem 
and alecrem. It is possible that d/acer (whence alacrem) > * dlécer (whence 
alecrem), then *alicer (whence alicrem alecrem). 
(2) For the suffix -a77us, see § 39, -arius. 
(3) Beside cérdsus (< xépacos) there must have been a Latin *cévésus, 
So beside *cérdséus, which was used in southern Italy, Rome, and Sar 
dinia, there was a céréséus, which was used elsewhere: Zaz. Spr. 468; cf 
Substrate I, 544. 
(4) Beside grdvis there was a grévis, under the influence of /évis: 
GREVE, Lat. Spr. 468; cf. Substrate Il, 441. 
(5) Beside ma/um (< Doric m@dov) there was a mélum (<mAov), used 
by Petronius and others: Zaz. Spr. 468. 
(6) Beside vacuus there was a vdcuus: vocuam, C. I. L. VI, 1527 d 33: 
cf. vocatio, C. J. L. I, 198, etc. Cf. S. 171, Olcott 33. The o was probably
-P-A-G-E-101
  § 198] Aw InrrRopuction TO VuLcaR LaTIN. 83 
original; old vocdre, voctuus regularly became vacdre, vactvus (> vacuus), 
whence by analogy wdcat for vécat: Lat. Spr. 466. By a change of suffix 
vdcuus became *vdcitus. 
é 
196. Long ¢, which was pronounced ¢ (§ 165), probably 
remained unchanged in Vulgar Latin, at least in most re- 
gions: debére, débet, habétis, mercedem, véndere, vérus. 
In Sicily, Calabria, and southern Apulia ¢ has become 7. 
In old Oscan, which was spoken in nearly the same region, @ 
became 7 in late Republican times, as in cénsum, dibeto, etc. 
(Lexigue 106). There is, however, no proof of historical con- 
nection between the phenomena: cf. Zaz. Spr. 468. 
197. Z is very often used for @ in inscriptions and late 
writings: Gregory the Great has crudilitas, dulcido, ficit, filix, 
minsam, vindo, etc., —ido for —edo, —isco for —esco, —isimus for 
~esimus; and conversely ver for vir, etc.: Sepulcri 193-194. 
Cf. S. 189-190; Carnoy 15 ff. (ficet in the 3d century, etc.). 
Also Vok.: for the confusion of —ére and -ire, I, 26o0ff., II, 
69 ff.; for -esco and —isco, I, 359-364; for -e’s and —i/is, —-elius 
and —7/us, I, 287-289; for véndimia instead of vindemia, I, 
328, III, 127 (Lexigue 115). These spellings are due in the 
main to the identity of @and7in late pronunciation: see § 165. 
A. Sepulcri, in Studi Medievali I, 614-615, conjectures that 
s+ consonant may have tended to raise ¢ to 7,9 to wu. This 
would account for distia (= déstia) found in late Latin, Studi 
Medievali I, 613; for crisco and other verbs in —ésco for —ésco; 
for adimplisti, etc.; for fistus, etc.;—also for colustra; for co- 
gnusco and other verbs in —wsco for —dsco. Some of the —ésco 
>-isco cases are surely due to a shift of conjugation: see 
§§ 414-415. 
198. In Gaul this substitution of 7 for ¢ was so very com- 
mon that it must signify something. It probably indicates an

For the development of diphthongs, see § 177.

In Sardinia and a part of Corsica this change did not take 
place, and both 7 and 7>z. These two islands were taken 
from Rome by the Vandals in 458 and added to the African 
kingdom; after that they were perhaps isolated: Einf. 106.

sémel: Lat. Spr. 468. 
(3) Sintster was replaced by sinéxter, under the influence of déxter:

Apulia 9 has become w, as it did in old Oscan: cf. the change 
of ¢ to 7, § 196.

It probably represents a very close sound, which later, in north- 
ern Gaul, became ow or wu: cortem> Old Fr. court. Cf. § 198. 
204. There are a few peculiar cases: — 
(1) Fr.and Sp. meuble, mueble postulate g in mdbilis, presumably through 
the analogy of mdveo. Cf. § 217. 
(2) Beside totus and tottus (§ 163), some of the Romance forms point to 
* tittus or * tiictus, or at least to a nom. pl. * Zi¢ti or * téicti: It. sg. tutto, pl. 
tutti; Neapolitan sg. tofto, pl. tutta; old Fr., Pr. sg. ‘ot, pl. duit. The 
Italian ¢v/fo may have come through the plural. Such a form seems to 
be attested by the G/. Cassel; “aiatutti. uuela alle,” where ¢u¢ti is defined 
as alle. No satisfactory explanation has been proposed; the most plausi- 
ble, perhaps, is that of Mohl, Zexigue 102-104, namely, the influence of 
ctincti on toti, Cf. Zs. XXXIII, 143. 
oO 
205. Short 0, pronounced 9 (§ 165), remained unchanged: 
bonus, folia, foris, forum, locus, mortem, sdlet, sdrtem. The 
rustic Latin funtes, frundes (for fontes, frondes) are perhaps 
connected with Italian fon/e and other words containing @ for 
@ before z + dental. 
U is occasionally used for 6 in inscriptions: Zucwus, etc., S. 
211-212. Cf. App. Pr, “formica non furmica.” 
For the development of diphthongs, see § 177. 
u 
206. Long u, pronounced w (§ 165), remained unchanged 
in most of the Empire: céra, diérus, nullus, ina. Gramma- 
rians mention the protrusion of the lips: S. 216. 
But in Gaul, a large part of northern Italy, and western 
Retia it was probably formed a little forward of its normal 
position. It was certainly not #, cf. K. Nyrop, Grammaire 
historique de langue francaise I, § 187; but it doubtless slightly 
approached it. This pronunciation may have been due to the

linguistic habits of the Celts: cf. Windisch 396--397. Celtic 
u#> i in Great Britain by the second century; in Latin words 
borrowed by the Celts # is generally treated like Celuic 0 
(mirus > mur), but in a few, presumably taken very early, 
>i (clipa> cib, criidus > criz): Loth 67-68. 
207. The following special cases are to be noted: — 
(1) Beside Z#7#dus there probably was a */iirdus: Substrate III, 517. 
(2) Niptia, through the analogy of * ndvius (“ bridegroom,” from ndvus) 
and ndra, became xdptie: Lat. Spr. 469. Cf. Substrate IV, 134. 
(3) Beside pamex there was a pomex: Bon. 136, pomice. Cf. F. G. 
Mohl in Zs, XXVI, 617-618. 
u 
208. Short ~, pronounced w (§ 165), became, probably by 
the fourth century or earlier, 9 in most of the Empire: dzcca, 
cilpa, gitla, riiptus, tinda, The spelling 0 is common in late 
documents: “co/umna non colomna,” “turma non torma’”’ (cf. 
“coluber non colober,” “ formosus non foi munsus,” “puella non 
poclla”), App. Pr.; tomolus, etc., Pirson 15-17; ‘onica, etc, 
Bon. 132-135; corso, covetum (= citbitum), toneca, Haag 14. 
The old spelling o for w after v (voltus, servos, etc.), which 
lasted down into the Empire, is perhaps only orthographic: 
Lat. Spr. 464. 
In Sardinia, a part of Corsica, Albania, and Dacia this 
change did not take place, and both # and #>u- Lat 
Spr. 467. 
For eu > ou, see § 167. 
(t) Beside angzistia there must have been * angéstia. 
(2) Fr. coudeuvre, fleuve, jeune call for local g in coltbra, flitvium, 
juvénis. There are other local irregularities. Cf. § 217. 
(3) In place of werus we find ndrus (R. 465) and ndra (S. 216), due to 
the analogy of sdror and *ndvia (“ bride,” from édvus). 
(4) Instead of plitere and plivia people said fldvere (used by Petronius 
and others) and *p/ija: Lat. Spr. 468. Cf. $§ 169, 217.

209. .4 was originally written and pronounced ai, but 
through the mutual attraction of its two parts it became < 
later e: cecus, celum, quero. 
In certain words a vulgar and dialect pronunciation ¢ com- 
mon to Volscian and Faliscan (Hammer 7, 8), came into 
general use: enum, preda, sépes, septum, séta. Cf. S. 166-168, 
188; Carnoy 79-80. For fénum fenum, préda prada, sépes 
sepes both forms were preserved. Hence, by analogy, such 
spellings as fecit, etc., S. 190. Cf. Neumann 13 (and Fort 
selzung 21-23): femina, quieti, etc. 
210. The regular change of @ to ¢ took place largely in 
Republican times in unaccented syllables; in stressed sylla- 
bles in the first century of our era and later. £ for @ in 
dative endings occurs early: Corssen I, 687ff. About the 
middle of the first century B.c., when Varro cited edus for 
hedus as a rural form, stressed @ was probably still a diph- 
thong in the city but had become ¢ in rustic Latium; some 
hundred years later ¢ came into the city and pervaded the 
provinces: Lat. Spr. 465. Terentius Scaurus, in the first cen- 
tury, says that @ represents the sound better than az: S. 224. 
£ is found early in Campania, especially in Pompeii (pes¢a, 
etc.): S. 225. In Spanish inscriptions ¢ occurs from the first 
century on (Carnoy 78): guestus (2d century), etc., Carnoy 
69-84. It was probably general everywhere by the second 
century: Zinf. § 78. Pompeius blames the confusion of eguus 
and éguus: S. 178. The spelling e for @ was usual in unac 
cented syllables (as sanc?e) before the third century, in stressed 
syllables (as gues‘or) from the fourth century on; it may be 
called regular by the fifth century: S. 178, 225. Cf. Bebtel
-P-A-G-E-107
  § 212] An InrropucTion TO VULGAR LATIN. 89 
75-76: cedat, grece, etc. Conversely @ was often erroneously 
used for ¢ (S. 183-184) and for Greek » (as scenam, Lex- 
igue 104). 
au 
211. Au, pronounced du, generally remained in Vulgar 
Latin: aura, gaudium, taurus. In Rumanian and Provengal 
it was preserved as az, in Portuguese as ow; its existence in 
the earliest stage of French is proved by the treatment of ¢ in 
causa > chose; in Italian and Spanish it did not become g until 
original g had broken into wo or we. 
(:) The spellings Cladius, Glacus, Scarus, etc., with a for aw when 
there is an w in the next syllable, are pretty common in various countries: 
S. 223; Carnoy 86-95. Perhaps they represent a provincial pronuncia- 
tion, or possibly they are only orthographic. 
(2) Clido for claudo is common, coming through derivatives, such as 
ocelido: Vok. II, 304; Carnoy too (c/udo in two Sp. inscriptions of the 
Ist and 2d centuries); Bayard 6. Cf. Carnoy 85-86 (c/wsa, etc.).   
212. Umbrian and Faliscan had o in place of Latin aw: 
Hammer 4-5, 8. -So, in general, the dialects of northern and 
central Italy: Chronologie 158-164. There are some examples 
in Pompeii, in Oscan territory, where az was normally pre- 
served; this pronunciation was used also in the country around 
Rome, and in the first and second centuries B.c. crept into 
the city, where it was used by the lower classes: Laz. Spr. 
465-466. In Umbrian inscriptions we find soru, etc.: Ham- 
mer 4. In Latin, Clodius and lotus are common in first 
century inscriptions: Carnoy 85, Pirson27. C/osa, etc., occur 
in the second century: Carnoy 85. 
The grammarians— Probus, Diomedes, Festus, and others 
—speak of a rustic or archaic o for au: Corssen I, 655-663; 
Vok, I, 301 ff.; S. 162-164; Hammer 15-19. Festus cites 
orum; Priscian, cotes, ostrum, plostrum: Carnoy 95. Cf. App 
Pr. “auris non oricla”; R. 464, coda, orata, orum.,
-P-A-G-E-108
go An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 216 
Conversely, aw was occasionally used for 6 (Chronologie 
160): Festus, auscudum,; Marius Victorinus, “ sorex vel saurex.” 
Cf. * aucidere for occidere, postulated by some Romance forms. 
213. This rustic and vulgar 4, — which was pronounced a, 
while the Romance o from au was 9, — was generally adopted 
in Vulgar Latin in a few words: coda; foces; *o¢ (cf. Umbrian 
ote, Hammer 4)= aut; plodere. Cf. Classic fauces, suffoco; 
plaudo, explodo; si audes, sodes. Cicero used loreola, oricla, 
plodo, pollulum: Carnoy 95. Ola, codex, coles =caulis, lotus, 
plotus occur also. 
eu 
214. Lu, pronounced éu (as in ceu, eu, Europa, eurus, chew, 
heu, neu, neuter, seu), was not preserved in any popular words. 
CiiSs228- 
we 
215. @ was originally written and pronounced oé, but 
through the mutual attraction of its two parts it became 
presumably 6, later ¢: cepi, pana, penitet, It may be that 
the intermediate stage is reflected by the spelling pHyeBa for 
Phebe, 8. 227. 
£ is attested by inscriptions in the first century of our era: 
ceperint, Carnoy 84; Phebus, C. L. L.1V, 1890; etc. Cf. S. 227, 
Lat. Spr. 464. In the er. we find amenus, cepi, etc., Bechtel 76. 
The confusion of @ and ¢ is mentioned by late grammarians: 
S. 227. In late Latin a bad spelling, @ for @ and ¢, became 
popular: cacus, celum, cementa, femina, fenum, merore, ma- 
stus, penates, Cf. S. 228; Vok. II, 293 ff. 
ui 
216. Ui, pronounced wi. was preserved: cui, hic, illu 
for the development of fw, see § 431.

  § 219] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. « 
c, INFLUENCE OF LABIALS. 
_217. According to some philologists, a following labial 
tends to open a vowel: colitbra >* colobra, fliivium >* flovium, 
Jivenis > * jovents, mobilis>* mobilis, dvum>* ovum, pliitre> 
plovére, etc. A general influence of this kind can hardly be 
regarded as proved for any combination except ow, which 
became ou. see § 167. 
S. Pieri, Za vocal tonica alterata dal contatto d’una consonante 
labiale in Archivio glottologico italiano XV, 457, maintains 
that 7, ¢, 0, w were lowered one stage—to ¢, ¢, 9, a—by a pre- 
ceding or following labial, even if it was separated from the 
vowel by a liquid. Although many examples are cited, the 
evidence is not convincing. For a criticism of the theory, 
see G. Ascoli, Osservazioni al precedente lavoro, ibid., p. 476. 
The discussion is continued by Pieri, Za vocal tonica alterata 
da una consonante labiale in Zs. XXVII, 579. 
d. CLERICAL LATIN. 
218. In clerical Latin the vowels were probably pronounced 
for the most part as in vulgar speech, until the reforms of 
Charlemagne. After that, in general, @=a, ¢=¢,7 
% =u (or #), @and @ =e, au=o or au.   
4, 00;   
  
2. UNACCENTED VOWELS. 
N. B.— For secondary stress, see §§ 153-155. 
219. Among unstressed vowels, those of the first syllable 
had most resistance, possibly through a lingering influence of 
the Old Latin accent: cf. § 134. 
The vowels of the final syllable lost much of their distinct- 
ness, but did not fall, except sporadically, until long after the 
Vulgar Latin period, and then only in a part of the Empire.
-P-A-G-E-110
92 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 22% 
Grammarians testify to the confusion of 0 and uw: S.212. Quase, 
sibe are found in place of guasi, sibi: S. 199-200. According 
to Quintilian I, iv, 7, “in ere neque e plane nequi 7 auditur.” 
Weakest were medial vowels immediately following the 
secondary or the primary stress. In early Latin there was 
an inclination to syncope: ar(z)dorem, av(i)dére, bdl(i)néum, 
cal(e)facére, jur(i)go, etc. This tendency continued, in mod- 
eration, in Classic and Vulgar Latin: cal(i)dus, dc(u)lus, 
frig(¢)daria, vir(z)dis, etc. In inscriptions we find such 
forms as infri, vetranus: S. 251. 
For the confusion of unaccented ¢ and 7, see Pirson, 30-36, 
47-48; for o and u, see Pirson 41-47. Fredegarius is very 
uncertain in his use of unstressed vowels: Haag 15-24. 
220. U was employed only before labials, in unaccented 
syllables: cf. S. 196-198, 203-208; Lindsay 25-26, 35; Franz. a 
I, 21-24. During the Classic period it generally became 7: 
decumus > decimus, maxumus > maximus, pontufex > pontifex, 
guodlubet > quodlibet, etc.; ci. Lat. Spr. 466. In Spanish in- 
scriptions we find maximus, etc., spelled both with w and with2: 
Carnoy 65-69. 
Stimus, being sometimes accented, developed two forms, 
stéimus and simus. The former was the one generally adopted 
in Classic Latin, but stmus was favored by Augustus and by 
some purists of his time (Lindsay 29). According to Marius 
Victorinus (Keil VI, 9), “‘Messala, Brutus, Agrippa pro sumus 
simus scripserunt.” In the vulgar speech simus seems to have 
prevailed in Italy and southern Gaul. Cf. § 419, (1). 
221. In general Latin quantity did not sensibly affect the 
quality of unstressed vowels, except in initial syllables, and 
even there the difference must have been small. In final 
syllables, however, z was certainly distinct from 7: senfis, 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
§ 224] Aw IntTRopDUCTION To VULGAR LATIN. 93 
  sentit >It. senti, sente; feci, fecit> Pr. fis, fes. In stbi, tibt 
the final vowel was sometimes long, sometimes short. 
a. UNACCENTED VOWELS IN HIATUS. 
222. and u followed by a vowel and beginning a syllable 
were apparently pronounced as consonants from the earliest 
times. Quintilian says that w and 7 in wos and dam are 
not vowels: S, 232. Quintilian and Velius Longus cite the 
spellings Aiiax, aiio, Maiiam as approved by Cicero: S. 236. 
Bonnet notes that a, not ad, is used before Joseph, Judais, 
etc. These, then, will be treated as consonants, and will be 
left out of consideration in the present chapter. 
223. After gutturals, ~ followed by a vowel was originally 
a vowel itself, but lost its syllabic value in early Classic times: 
acua> aqua, distinguere> distinguere. So it was in gualis, 
quero, quem, gui. In Greek transliterations xv for gud (as in 
dxvdas) is very common: Eckinger 123-125; cf. § 187. 
In perfects, however, such as xocuit, placuit, the u was ap- 
parently not reduced to a semivowel until the end of the 
Classic period. 
In some other words the syllabic value of ~ was kept, at 
least in theory, rather late: Velius Longus distinguishes eguam 
from acuam, S. 234; App. Pr. “vacua non vagua,” “vacui non 
vagui,” 
224. Otherwise, ¢, 7, and z in hiatus with following vowels 
lost their syllabic value probably by the first century of our 
era, and sporadically earlier. Occasional examples (such as 
dormio, facias, fluviorum) are found in Ennius, Plautus, Lu- 
cilius, Lucretius, Horace, Virgil, Ovid, Juvenal, and Seneca: 
e.g., dorsum in Lucretius; vindemiator in Horace; abiete, abieti- 
bus in Virgil. ta/ia counts as three syllables in poets of the
-P-A-G-E-112
  94 Aw InTRoDUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. [§ 225 
early Empire. Cf. S. 232. Valerius Probus has parietibus: 
Edon 208. Consentius declares that trisyllabic -so/wét and 
four-syllable induruit are barbarisms; Czsellius is undecided 
whether ¢enuis has three syllables or two: S. 234. Suavis, 
however, was used as a trisyllable by Sedulius in the fifth 
century; it was probably a semi-learned word, as it became 
soef in French, soave in Italian. 
The pronunciation ¢, 7, « was probably regular in popular 
speech by the first century or before; by the third century, 
with a narrowing of the mouth-passage, the semivowels pre- 
sumably developed into the fricative consonants y and w- S. 
231-232. So alea>alea>alja, filius> filius > filjus, sapui 
> sapui>sapwi. In the same way fil/olus > filjélus (§ 136), 
tenieram > ténweram (§ 137); likewise eccuw’hic > *eccwit, 
eccu’ista>* ecwista ($65), etc. We have, then, in late Latin, 
a new y and a new w. 
Hence arises, in late Latin spelling, a great confusion of e 
and 7 in hiatus: caprioLvs (cf. §136), S. 187; Caper, “non 
tamus sed eamus,” “sobrius per ¢ non per e scribendum,” 
Keil VII, 106, 103; aleum, calcius, cavia, coclia, fasiolus, lancia, 
lintium, noxeus, solia, vinia, App. Pr.; abias, abiat, exiat, 
Lauriatus, valiat, Audollent 535; palleum, etc., R. 463; cal- 
ciare, liniamenta, Bayard 4; eacit (=/Jacet), eam (=jam), Vok. 
II, 43; cf. Carnoy 33-35. 
225. But the combinations eéé, 24, od, ué developed differently, 
eé and #é apparently being contracted into ¢, od and ud into 0, 
at an early date: ariétem (§136)>arétem (Varro, “ares 
veteres pro aries dixisse”: Carnoy 43); *dé-éxcito>* dexcito> 
It. desto; faciébam>* facebam; mulitrem (§ 136) > mul'erem, 
the 7 remaining long enough to palatalize the 7 (the Romance 
¢ was doubtless a later analogical development); pariétes 
($136) >paréetes, C. L. L. VI, 3714 (Rome); prihéndéire>
-P-A-G-E-113
  § 227] Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 95 
prindére, then *préndére through the analogy of réddére and 
perhaps also of ascéndére, defindére, pindére, téndére; quiétus> 
guétus, common in late inscriptions, Pirson 57 (cf. veguebit, 
Carnoy 43); — c&hdrtem> cortem,; »codpérire> copérire, then 
* copérire * cop’rire through the analogy of co— and perhaps also 
of dpéra, opus; diiodécim> dodécim (Pirson 58: dodece). 
226. Furthermore, w after all consonants fell before un- 
accented w probably by the middle of the first century, before 
unaccented o by the second century: antiguus > anticus ; 
carduus > cardus; coguus> cocus (App. Pr. “cogui non coci,” 
“cogus non cocus”; cf. S. 351); distinguunt> distingunt (ac- 
cording to Velius Longus, some writers use no # in distinguere, 
Edon 130); éguus > écus (App. Pr., “equs non ecus”; cf. Velius 
Longus, S. 217); zndcuus > inndécus, Koffmane 111; mdrtuus> 
mortus; suus > sus, tuum> tum, Carnoy 117;— battuo > batto 
(cf. abattas, Gl. Reich.) ; coguo> coco (App. Pr., “ coguens non 
cocens”; hence *cocina); guat(t)uor > quattor (S. 218) guator 
(Pirson 58) guatro (7th century, Carnoy 221); guot(t)idie > 
cottidie, S. 352; stinguo> stingo; tinguo> tingo (Caper, “tin- 
guere ... non tingere,” Keil VII, 106); ‘orgueo>* torquo > 
*t6rco; tinguo> iingo (ungo, unguntur, ungi, Bayard 7; Caper, 
“ungue non unge,” Keil VII, 105; wncis = unguis, Audollent 
536). Soapparently arwum>* arum, éruum>érum (Lat. Spr. 
472: ero). Viduus, however, doubtless under the influence cf 
the commoner vidua, kept its wu: Old Fr. vef. 
After gutturals, « fell before stressed u and 0: quum> cum; 
quomodo > comodo, Audollent 536. See § 354. 
UV often fell irregularly in contin(u)ari, Febr(u)arius. 
Jan(u)arius: Vok. 11, 468-469; S. 217-218. 
227. Similarly, 7 after a consonant fell before unaccented 7;

Some late words, however, kept —éz and —izs: Dionysii> It. 
Dionigi, Parisiis> It. Parigi. 
b. INITIAL SYLLABLE. 
228. As far as one can judge from spellings and subsequent 
developments, @ was pronounced a; @, é, i, @ all came to be 
sounded ¢; 7 remained 7; 6 and « were finally all pronounced 
oor “; Oremained 9; au became a if there was an accented 
uz in the next syllable, but otherwise remained unchanged (cf. 
Lat. Spr. 470): radicem, valére; etitem, debéere, ténére, videre, 
fedire; ridémus, civititem, hibernus; plorare, friimentum, 
stibinde; colorem, dolére, movétis; A(u)giistus, A(u)runci, 
a(u)scilto, audére, gaudére, naufragium. For the confusion of 
e and #, see Audollent 535, Carnoy 17-33, Bon. 135-138. Cf. 
ecclesia, Bechtel 76; “senatus non sinatus,” App. Pr.; golosus 
gplosus (for gulosus), Koffmane 110; moniti (for miniti), Bon. 
136. Agustus is frequent from the second century on, S. 223 
(cf. agustas, Pirson 26); Avunci occurs in manuscripts of 
Virgil; Caper says “auscu/ta non asculta,” S. 223; *agirium 
must have existed also. 
229. In a few words the vowel of the initial syllable was 
lost before an 7: *corrétilare>*crot lare; diréctus generally > 
d’rectus (Vok. Vl, 422: drictus); guiritare>*critare. Jefinus 
after prefixes lost its first syllable: *dis-junare. 
Some minor peculiarities are to be noted: — 
(1) A after 7 apparently tended to become e: Old Latin jajzinus > 
Classic jejinus (the original a seems to be preserved in some Italian 
dialect forms); Classic Jaxuarius > /Jenuarius (common in inscriptions, 
S. 171-172, Lat. Spr. 470); Classic janua > *jenua > Sardinian genna, 
(2) Z, long or short, is very often replaced by # in Gallic inscriptions 
(Lat. Spr. 470): divota, mimoria, etc.; dilevit, Bon. 109; cf. Vok. I,
-P-A-G-E-115
  § 230] An InTRopuction To VuLcaRr Latin. 97 
422-424. This perhaps indicates a close pronunciation: cf.§ 198. D#- for 
de-, possibly through confusion with d7s-, is common in Gregory the 
Great: dirivare, etc. According to Mohl, Zexigue 105-108, e became 7 in 
southern Italy from the fourth to the sixth century: RIVOCAVERIT, etc. 
A form x/ for we is found from early times: Pirson 3. 
(3) Z was occasionally assimilated to a following accented a: givdntem 
> *jagante > Old Fr. jaiant, Pr. jaian, Old Genoese zagante; siludticus > 
salvaticus (Gl. Reich. cf. Lat. Spr. 470) > Old Fr. salvage, It. salvatico, 
Rum. sdlbatec. Cf. Einf. § 111. 
(4) 7 tended to become e, by dissimilation, if there was an accented 7 in 
the next syllable:! dividére > *devidére; divinus > devinus, in fourth 
century inscriptions, Lexigue 122; /inire > fenire, in manuscripts and 
inscriptions, Lexique 123; vicinus > vecinus, attested by Servius, Lexigue 
104 ff. .Sz, in late Latin, sometimes became se, attested from the sixth 
century on (Vok. II, 87; Lexigue 120; Franz. a II, 224 ff.; Bon, 126; 
Haag 11; cf. mise, C. 7. L.I, 205); in very late texts there is frequent con- 
fusion of si and sed (Franz. a II, 225, 234-235); the ¢ is perhaps due to the 
analogy of *gue < guid = quod (cf. §§ 69, 82), cf. Italian sed on the model 
of ched: si is preserved in French, Provengal, and Spanish, se in Portu- 
guese, Old French, Italian, and Old Rumanian. In miradilia the 7 ap- 
parently became ¢ and a. 
(5) J was kept by analogy in many words: dérare, miirare, miitare, 
nittrire (beside *notrire). Jinipérus > jeniperus (Lat. Spr. 470) and jini- 
perus (App. Pr.). 
(6) O appears as w in furmica (App. Pr., cf. Rom. XX XV, 164), putator 
(Bon. 127), turrente (Bon. 131). O is changed to e in retundus (Vok. II, 
213; cf. Vitruvius, retundatio, Lat. Spr. 470), through the influence of the 
prefix ve-; also sometimes in serore (Lat. Spr. 470; ck. serori, seroribus, 
Carnoy 107). 
(7) Aw in vulgar speech was often replaced by o (cf. §§ 212, 213): 
oricla, App. Pr., Pirson 27; so *o¢ (for aut: cf. Umbrian ofe, Lindsay 40), 
which prevailed in Vulgar Latin.    
230. S before a consonant was doubtless long and sharp, 
as in modern Italian, so that at the beginning of a word it had 
a syllabic effect — s-chola. This led to the prefixing of a 
front vowel (until the seventh century nearly always an ¢, later   
1 Mohl’s view, Lexigue 122-126, is that original Latin ei, if ¢ followed, became ¢ 
instead of 7.  
-P-A-G-E-116
  98 An Inrropuction To VuLGaR LATIN. [§ 231 
often ¢) to the s when no vowel preceded — in i-schola. Thisi 
or ¢ came to be regarded as a regular part of the word. The 
prosthetic vowel occurs first in Greek inscriptions. The 
earliest Latin example is probably ésco/asticus,. written in 
Barcelona in the second century; it is found repeatedly, though 
not frequently, in the third century (Carnoy 114-116); in the 
fourth and fifth it is very common: espiritum, ischola, iscripta, 
isperabi, ispose, istatuam, istudio, 8, 317; ismaragdus, Pirscn 60; 
estatio, Estephanus, iscola, istare, R. 467. Grammarians took 
no note of it until St. Isidore, in the seventh century. But in 
late Latin texts ad rather than a was used before words be- 
ginning with sc, sf, st- ab scandalo, Dubois 171; ab sceleribus, 
Bon. 445; cf. Dubois 171-172, Bon. 445-446. 
The es-, 7s— thus produced was confounded with ex-, exs— 
(pronounced es—) and ims—, his— (pronounced és—): explendido, 
splorator, instruo for struo, Spania, etc., S. 317; Atspatii for 
spatii, Bechtel 78; spiratio for inspiratio, Koffmane 109; 
scalciare for excalceare, scoriare for excoriare, spandere for ex- 
pandere, Spania, Spanus, stantia for instantia, strumentum, etc., 
R. 469-470; spectante for expectante, etc., Bon. 148. Cf. Vok. 
II, 365 ff.; S. 316-319; Pirson 59-60. 
c. INTERTONIC SYLLABLE. 
N.B.— By this term is meant the syllable following the secondary and preceding 
the primary stress. 
231. Vowels so situated probably became more and more 
indistinct towards the end of the Empire, and occasionally 
disappeared. In some regions they began to fall regularly 
before the close of the Vulgar Latin period, but @ was gen- 
erally kept: d07(2)idtem, cép(7)tdlis, cérr(d)cdre, cérebéllum, 
ctu(i)tdtem, cll(o)ctre, cmpardre cémperére, dél(i)cdtus, di- 
b(2)tdre, Eleméntum éliméntum, frigidéria frigdéria, mtrabilia,
-P-A-G-E-117
  § 233] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 99. 
sdcraméntum, sépartre séperdre, vérecindia. Frigdaria occurs 
in the second century B.c.: Franz. a1, 12. Cf. dedcavit, Pir- 
son 52; vetranus, Pirson 51; cornare for coronare, Koffmane 
111; stablarius, R. 467. The fall of the vowel of course dis- 
turbed the Vulgar Latin rhythm: see §153. Cf. F. Neumann 
in Zs. XIV, 559. 
Ministérium apparently became minstérium early enough for 
the ~ to fall before the s- see $171. Cf. Substrate IV, 116. 
d. PENULT. 
232. The Vulgar Latin rhythmic principle tended to oblit- 
erate one of the two post-tonic syllables of proparoxytones. 
The penult, being next to the accent, was weaker and more 
exposed to syncope. We find in late Latin much confusion 
of e and 7: anemis, meretis, etc., Neumann 22; dixemus, etc., 
Bon. 118. Likewise 0 and uw. amébolare, etc., R. 464; insola, 
etc., Bon. 131-135; cf. Sepulcri 201-202. 
The treatment of this vowel, however, was apparently very 
inconsistent in Vulgar Latin, and .the conditions differed 
widely in different regions. There was probably a conflict 
between cultivated and popular pronunciation, both types 
often being preserved in the Romance languages: thus while 
the literary and official world said (1) démines (>It. uominz), 
the uneducated pronounced ’6m’nes (> Pr. omne); similarly 
beside sdcérum there was sdcrum. 
As far as the general phenomena can be classified, we may 
say that in popular words in common speech the vowel of the 
penult tended to fall under the following conditions: — 
(1) BETWEEN ANY CONSONANT AND A LIQUID. 
233. A vowel preceded by a consonant and followed by a 
liquid weakened and fell in the earlier part of the Vulgar
-P-A-G-E-118
  100 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. ($ 235 
Latin period: a/tra; anglus; aspra; dedro for déderunt, Lex- 
igue 63; fecrunt fecru, Lexigue 64; ins(u)la; juglus; mantplus ; 
socro, Pirson 51. In some words we find a weakened to e: 
cttera, App. Pr.; hilerus, Carnoy 12; Ca@seris, compera, seperat 
(about 500 a.p.), Vok. I, 195-196; Eseram for Lsaram, 
Bon. 96. For a vowel between a /adial and a liquid, see 
(2) below. 
But if the first consonant was a palatal, the vowel seems to 
have been kept, at any rate in some regions: bdjulus, fragilis, 
gracilis, virginem. In vigilat>*viglat the vowel fell before 
the g began to be palatalized (so apparently in dégitum > dic- 
tum, Franz. a1, 15-16; frigidus > frigdus, App. Pr.). Cf. § 259. 
234. Latin originally had the two diminutive endings —c/us 
(<-#lo), as in seclum, and -ciilus (<-co-lo), as in auriciila. 
These were kept distinct by Plautus. Later they were con- 
fused, both becoming —c#/us in Classic Latin, both —c/us in 
vulgar speech: artic(u)lus, bdéc(u)lus, mdsc(u)lus, bc(u)lus, 
Spée(u)lum, verndc(u)lus, vic(u)lus. Oclus and some others 
occur in Petronius: see W. Herzus, Die Sprache des Petronius 
und die Glossen, 1899; cf. peduclum, Waters Ch. 57. Many ex- 
amples are found in inscriptions: oclos, scap/as, Audollent 538; 
aunclus, felicla, masclus, Pirson 49-50. Cf. Franz. a I, 16-18. 
To -clus was assimilated in popular Latin the ending 
-titlus: capttulus>* capiclus; fistula>*fiscla; vétulus>veclus, 
App. Pr. (cf. vitlus, Pirson 51). But a few words, which must 
have been slow in entering the common vocabulary, escaped 
this absorption: créstulum> crustlum (found in 18 a. D.); 
spatula>*spatla. Cf. § 284. 
(2) Between A LapBiaL AND ANY CONSONANT. 
235. A vowel preceded by a labial and followed by a con- 
sonant was inclined to fall early: bubZus; cém(i)tem,; comp’ tus ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  § 238] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. Io1 
déb(i)tum; adém(i)nus; fib(u)la; pdp(u)lus; sablum; trt- 
b(u)la; vdpulo baplo. In dém(i)nus the mn form may be 
the older: domni, Pirson 50; domnus in St. Augustine, Koff- 
mane 109; domnicus, R. 467; domnulus, Koffmane 111. 
Zamna occurs in Horace and Vitruvius, Franz. a I, 13. 
Petronius has dud/um, Waters Ch. 44, offa, Waters Ch. 56. 
Cf. jibla, poplus, sablum, etc., in R. 467. 
In some words, however, the vowel was kept, either every- 
where or ina large region: érb(0)rem; hémula; hdm(i)nes ; 
juv(e)nis; nébula; trémulat. 
236. When aé or av was brought next to a consonant by 
the fall of a following vowel, it generally became au, but 
often there were double forms; the process began very early: 
* évica > auca, found in glosses; évidus > audus, Plautus (cf. 
avunculus > aunculus, Plautus); *clévido > claudo (cf. *navi- 
Sragus > naufragus); fabula>*faula *fabla; gébata>* gauta 
*cabta; *ndvitat>*nautat; pardbula>*paraula *parabla; 
tébula>* taula * tabla. Cf. Franz. a I, 12. 
(3) BETWEEN a LiquID AND ANY CONSONANT. 
237. A vowel preceded by a liquid and followed by. a con- 
sonant was subject to syncope at all periods: ardus, Plautus; 
caldus, Plautus, Cato, Varro, Petronius; cé/(a)phus (cf. per- 
colopabat, Waters Ch. 44; colpus, Gl. Reich.); filica fulca, 
Franz. a 1, 13; lardum, Ovid, Martial, Juvenal, Pliny; merto, 
Pirson 51, franz. a 1,15; soldus, Cesar, Horace, Varro; valde; 
virdis, App. Pr. (cf. virdiaria, Vegetius, 4th century). Cf. 
Franz. a I, 12 ff. 
(4) MIscELLANEOUS. 
238. In some words the vowel fell under different condi. 
tions: digitum> dictum, Franz. a 1, 15-16 (cf. § 233); /rigidus
-P-A-G-E-120
102 An InrTRODUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. [§ 241 
>Sfrigdus (cf. § 233), App. Pr. (fricda), Pompeii (FRIDAM); 
maxima >masma, 2d century, Suchier 732; nétidus >* nittus, 
putidus > *puttus, probably late; postus, Lucretius, Pirson 50, 
Franz. 21, 13-14 (cf. posturus, Cato). 
239. In the transition from Vulgar Latin to the Romance 
languages the vowels in classes (1), (2), (3),—in so far as 
they had not fallen already,—were syncopated with some 
regularity; and a number of vowels otherwise placed fell 
under different conditions in various regions: pénere >*ponre, 
téllere>* tolre; fémina>*femna, habitus >* abtus, rdépidus > 
*rapdus; cérrico>*carco, cléricus >*clercus, cdllocat>*colcat; 
déc(i)mus, fréx(i)nus, pérs(i)ca, séd(e)cim. Cf. Gl. Reich.: 
carcatus, culicet culcet = collocat, 
In a part of Gaul émita>*anta, débita>*depta, dominica> 
*dominca, manica>* manca, sémita>*senta. Some of these 
shortened forms were used in other regions. 
A vowel preceded by @ or ¢ and followed by ¢ seems to 
have remained longer than most other vowels that fell at all: 
judico, médicus, vidticum, vindico, etc. 
e. FINAL SYLLABLE. 
240. The vowels regularly remained through the Vulgar 
Latin period. Later, about the eighth century, they gener- 
ally fell, except @ and %, in Celtic, Aquitanian, and Ligurian 
territory. 
241. In the 4p. Pr. we find “avus non aus,” “flavus non 
flaus,” “rivus non rius.” Aus and flaus have left no repre- 
sentatives, but 77s is evidently the ancestor of Italian and 
Spanish 770. All three forms are probably examples of a 
phonetic reduction that affected certain regions. 
Through a large part of the Empire -dvit>-aut: wi- 
umphaut is found in Pompeii. See Morphology.
-P-A-G-E-121
  § 244] An InrRopUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. 103 
242. Final vowels, as in modern Italian, must have been 
often elided or syncopated in the interior of a phrase, espe- 
cially e after liquids: Caper, “dzdere non biber”; haber in an 
inscription; conder, preber, prediscer, tanger in manuscripts. 
See Franz. a1, 41. So, perhaps, autumnal(e), tribunal(e), etc. 
The Aff. Pr. has “barbarus non barbar,” “figulus non figel,” 
“masculus non mascel.” ‘These curious forms are probably 
not the result of a phonetic development, but are rather due 
to a local change of inflection, which left no trace in the 
Romance languages. Cf. Old Latin facul = facilis, famul = 
Samulus. 
243. A, long or short, was naturally pronounced a; @, é, 2, 
according to the testimony of numerous inscriptions (Zaz. 
Spr. 469), were all probably sounded e, which in Sicily be- 
came eventually 7; 7 remained z; 6 was 0, which became w in 
Sicily; « was u. In some localities this 0 and this « were 
kept distinct, but generally they were confounded (Lat. Spr. 
469). Examples: dmds, dmat; sancte, tristes, tristém, tristis ; 
fect, boni, séntis; boénds, mérior; corpiis, friécti. About the 
eighth century @ probably became a in northern Gaul. 
244. The changes in pronunciation led to great confusion 
in spelling. It is likely that final vowels were especially ob- 
scure in Gaul in the sixth and seventh centuries. 
Neumann 7-8 cites ten cases of ¢ for a: /talice, etc. 
£ and @, in late Latin, were not usually distinguished (cf. 
§ 210): aple=apte, cotidia, etc., Bechtel 75-76. 
£ and i came to be used almost indiscriminately. Quintilian 
I, vii, says that Livy wrote sébe and guase; in I, iv and I, vii, he 
describes the final vowel of Zeve as neither quite ¢ nor quite z. 
Cf. mihe, tibe, etc., Lexigue 118. £ for z is frequent in the 
dative and ablative, Carnoy 45: /uce, dative; uxore, ablative. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
104 An InrTRopucTion TO VULGAR LATIN. [s 246 
  Es and is are continually interchanged: Vo&. I, 244 ff., ILL, 
116; mares=maris, etc., Audollent 535; /oannis, etc., Neu- 
mann 11-13; /acis, omnes = omnis (3d century), etc., Caruoy 
13-15; regis = reges, etc. Bon. 111; omnes =omnis, etc., Bon. 
121. So eftand zt: Bechtel 88-89, very common in er. ; seni, 
etc, Neumann 11-13; fosuet, etc., Carnoy 13; movit, etc., 
Bon. 115; Sepulcri 229-230. 
With o and wu it was the same. In Vos. II, grff., there are 
61 examples of « for ablative o between 126 and 563 a. D., as 
well as frequent instances of ablative in wm, of om for um, os 
for us, and us for os. The confusion of 0 and wm is very 
common in fer.; also in Gregory the Great, Sepulcri 203-204; 
cf. Carnoy 48, monumento=monumentum. Bon. 131 has 
spoliatur for spoliator. Os and us were interchanged from the 
third century on: anus=annos, Carnoy 48; bonus = bonos, 
etc., Sepulcri 201.. The accusative plural in ~s was particu- 
larly common in Gaul: fi/ius=filios, etc., Bon. 128; cf. 
Haag 42. 
245. In words often used as proclitics final -e7, -or became 
—re, ro: inter>*intre; quat(u)or> quatro, Carnoy 221; sém- 
per>*sempre; stiper>*supre. Cf. Lat. Spr. 474. 
Minus, used as a prefix (cf. $29) as in minus-pretiare, be- 
came in Gaul mzs-, perhaps at the end of the Vulgar Latin 
period, under the influence of dis-. Cf. Phon. 43-44- 
E. CONSONANTS. 
246. The Latin consonant letters were B, C, D, F, G, H, I, 
K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Z. Zand V were used both 
for the vowels ¢ and w and for the consonants 7 and v. A, an 
old letter equivalent to C, was kept in some formulas; it need
-P-A-G-E-123
  
§ 248] An Intropuction To VuLcaR Latin. 105 
not be separately considered. @ was generally used only in 
the combination QV = kw (cf. §223). Xstandsfor&s. Z in 
Old Latin apparently meant s or ss (S. 319-320); later it 
represented a different Latin version of Greek ¢, which will be 
treated below (§§ 338-339). 
In addition to the above, Vulgar Latin had a new w and y 
coming from originally syllabic w, ¢, or 7 in hiatus: see § 224. 
In words borrowed from Greek and German there were several 
foreign consonants, which will be discussed after the native 
ones. 
247. Double consonants regularly kept their long pronun- 
ciation: annus, nullus, passus, terra, vacca. For ss>s and 
Zl/>Z7 after long vowels, see §161. For double forms like 
cipus cippus, see §§ 162, 163. 
In late spelling there is some confusion of single and double 
consonants: avos, Pirson 88; /i//io, Pirson 85; serra, Bon. 158; 
cf. Pirson 83-91. For Fredegarius see Haag 39-40. Double 
consonants are often written single in early inscriptions. 
248. The principal developments that affected Latin con- 
sonants may be summed up as follows: 4 between vowels was 
opened into the bilabial fricative B, and thus became identical 
with v, which also changed to 8; ¢ and g before front vowels 
were palatalized and were then subject to further alterations; 
A was silent; m and became silent at the end of a word, and 
n ceased to be sounded before s. The voicing of intervocalic 
surds began during the Vulgar Latin period. 
The consonants will now be considered in detail, first the 
native Latin, next the Greek, lastly the Germanic; the Celtic 
need not be separately studied. The Latin consonants will be 
caken up in the following order: aspirate, gutturals, palatals, 
dentals, liquids, sibilants, nasals, labials.

106 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [s 251 
1. LATIN CONSONANTS. 
a. ASPIRATE. 
249. 7 was weak and uncertain at all times in Latin, being 
doubtless little or nothing more than a breathed on-glide: S. 
255-256. Grammarians say that / is not a letter but a mark 
of aspiration: S. 262-263. There is no trace of Latin % in 
the Romance languages. Cf. G. Paris in Rom. XI, 399. 
250. It probably disappeared first when medial: S. 266. 
Quintilian commends the spelling deprendere: S.266. Gellius 
says ahenum, vehemens, incohare are archaic; Terentius Scaurus 
calls reprehensus and vehemens incorrect, and both he and 
Velius Longus declare there is no 4 in prendo: S.266. Probus 
states that ¢raho is pronounced frao: Lindsay 57. Cf. App. 
Pr. “adhuc non aduc.” In inscriptions we find such forms as 
aduc, comprendit, cortis, mi, nil, vemens: S. 267-268. 
251. Initial / was surely very feeble and often silent during 
the Republic. In Cicero’s time and in the early Empire there 
was an attempt to revive it in polite society, which led to fre- 
quent misuse by the ignorant, very much as happens in Cock 
ney English to-day: for the would-be elegant chommoda, 
hinsidias, etc., of “Arrius,” see S. 264. 
Quintilian says the ancients used / but little, and citer 
“edos ircosque”’: S. 263. Gellius quotes P. Nigidius Figulus 
to the effect that “rusticus fit sermo siaspires perperam”; but 
speaks of bygone generations —i.e., Cicero’s contemporaries — 
as using 4 very much, in such words as sepulchrum, honera: 
S. 263-264. Pompeius notes that 4 sometimes makes position, 
as in “erga fatigamus hasta, sometimes does not, as in guisguis 
honos tumuli: Keil V, 117. Grammarians felt obliged to dis- 
cuss in detail the spelling of words with or without 4: S. 
264-265.  
-P-A-G-E-125
§ 254] Aw Inrropuction TO VuLGaR LatIN. 107 
is dropped in a few inscriptions towards the end of the 
Republic: arrespex (for haruspex), etc., S. 264. In Rome are 
found: E[REpEs], C. Z Z. 1, 1034; oratia, C. Z LZ. 1, 924; 
ostia, C. ZZ. 1, 819. In Pompeii % is freely omitted; and 
after the third century it is everywhere more or less indis- 
criminately used: abe9, abitat, anc, eres, ic, 0¢, omo, ora, etc., 
haram, hegit, hossa, etc., S. 265-266. Cf. ospitium, ymnus, etc., 
heremum, hiens, hostium, etc., Bechtel 77-78; ortus, etc., hodio, 
etc., R. 462-463. 
252. After % had become silent, there grew up a school 
pronunciation of medial % as &, which has persisted in the 
Italian pronunciation of Latin and has affected some words in 
other languages: michi, nichil, Bechtel 78, R. 455. Cf. E. S. 
Sheldon in Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Litera- 
ture I (1892), 82-87. 
b. GUTTURALS. 
253. Cand X did not differ in value except that C some- 
times did service for G: App. Pr., “digitus non dicitus’; 
dicitos = digitos, Audollent 536; cf. S. 341-344. There was 
some confusion, too, of Q and C: S. 345. 
254. QV was pronounced kw: S. 340-341, 345-346, 350- 
351. Before « and o, however, the kw was reduced to & by 
the first or second century, probably earlier in local or vulgar 
dialects: Quintilian VI, iii, records a pun of Cicero on cogue 
and guogue; condam, cot, cottidie, S. 351-352; in guo ante=in- 
choante, quooperta = coperta, secuntur, Bechtel 78-79. Cf. § 226. 
Before other vowels the 4w was regularly kept in most of 
the Empire, unless analogy led to a substitution of 4, as in 
coci for cogui through cocus: see §226. But in Dacia, south- 
eastern Italy, and Sicily subsequent developments point to a 
Vulgar Latin reduction of gue to ke, gui to ki: Lat. Spr. 473- 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 Aw Inrropuction To VuLcaR LatIN. [§ 256 
In guingue the first w was lost by dissimilation: cINQVvs, 
Carnoy 221, found in Spain (so cinqv, Lexigue 93); CINCTIVS, 
CINQVAGINTA, S. 351. Lagueus seems, for some reason, to 
have become */aceus: Substrate III, 274. 
255. xX stood for ds: S. 341, 346, 352. After a consonant 
ks early tended to become s- Piautus uses mers for merx; 
Caper, “‘ca/s dicendum, ubi materia est, per s,” Keil VII, 98. 
By the second or third century 4s before a consonant was 
reduced to s: ses¢ws is common in inscriptions, cf. Carnoy 170, 
Eckinger 126 (3éoros); destera, Carnoy 171; dester, S. 353; 
mextum for mestum, Audollent 537. So ex—>es— in excutere, 
exponere, etc.: cf. extimare for estimare, Bechtel 139. Hence 
sometimes, by analogy, es— for ex— before vowels, as in *essa- 
gium, but not in exire. 
At about the same time tinal 4s became s, except in mono- 
syllables: cojus, conjus, milex, pregnax = pregnans, subornatris, 
etc., in inscriptions, S. 353 (cf. xamto, etc.); felis, fifth cen- 
tury, Carnoy 159; Aff. Pr, “aries non ariex,” “locuples non 
lucuplex,” “miles non milex,” “poples non poplex.” 
In parts of Italy 4s between vowels was assimilated into ss 
by the first century, but this was only local: aLEsAN[DER], S. 
353; BISSIT BISIT VISIT = vixit, S. 353. For ks> xs, see § 266. 
There are some examples, in late Latin, of a metathesis of 
ks into sk: axilla>ascella, Lindsay 102; buxus>*buscus; 
vixit > VvIxciT (i. e., véscit), Carnoy 157. Cf. Vok. I, 145. On 
the other hand, Prisci//a> pRixstLLa, Carnoy 158. In north- 
ern Gaul apparently sé regularly became 4s, as in cresco, nasco, 
etc.: see Mélanges Wahlund 145. 
256. The voicing of intervocalic surds doubtless began as 
early as the fifth century; it is shown by Anglo-Saxon borrow- 
ings and by such Latin forms as /rigare, migat in inscriptions
-P-A-G-E-127

and manuscripts; there are many examples from the sixth 
century: Lat Spr. 474. A. Zimmermann, Zs. XXV, 731, 
finds in inscriptions some slight evidence of a change of ¢ 
to d@ during the Empire, in some places perhaps as early as 
the first century. According to Loth 21-26, intervocalic ¢, A, ¢ 
were voiced in Gaul in the second half of the sixth century. 
Rydberg, /ranz. a I, 32, maintains, on the evidence of in- 
scriptions and manuscripts, that ¢>d in the fifth century and 
the beginning of the sixth, while ->g at least two centuries 
earlier. Cf. Vok. I, 125 ff.; immudavit, 2d century, Carnoy 
121; eglesia, lebra, pontivicatus, 7th century, Carnoy 123; 7e- 
gat, pagandum, etc., sigricius = secretius, etc., Haag 27; cubidus, 
occubavit, etc., stubri, etc., Haag 27-28; cataveris = cadaveris, 
etc., Haag 28-29. Some of the above examples show that 
consonants followed by 7 shared in the voicing, at least as 
early as the seventh century. 
Voicing was not general, however, in central and southern 
Italy, Dalmatia, and Dacia. 
257. Initial ¢ and cr, in a few words, became g and gr: 
*gaveola; *gratis; crassus + grossus > grassus, found in the 
4th century. Cf. Densusianu 111-112.

258. Before the front vowels ¢ and / the velar stops Aand g 
were drawn forward, early in the Empire or before, into a 
mediopalatal position—’, ¢’. G seems to have been attracted 
sooner than &- in Sardinian we find & before ¢ or 7 preserved 
as a stop while gis not—4elu, kena, kera, kima, kircare, deghe< 
decem, noghe < nucem, but reina, etc. 
In Central Sardinia, Dalmatia, and Illyria 2’ went no further, 
and in Sicily, southern Italy, and Dacia the # stage was ap 
parently kept longer than in most regions: Lat. Spr. 472.

  IIo An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [s 259 
259. G’ by the fourth century had become prepalatal and 
had opened into y, both in popular and in clerical Latin: 
Gerapolis for Hierapolis, Per. 61, 3; “calcostegis non calcosteis,” 
App. Pr.; CON.GI.GI = conjugi, S. 349; geiuna = jejuna, Stolz 
275, Neumann 5, Laz. Spr. 473; GENVARIVS, S. 239; GENARIVS, 
Pirson 75; agebat = aiebat, Tenubam = Genavam, ingens = 
iniens, Bon. 173; agebat = aiebat, agere = aiere, Sepulcri 205; 
Gepte, Tragani, Troge, Haag 33; desta, D’Arbois 10. Before 
this happened, /rigidus in most of the Empire had become 
frigdus (App. Pr. “frigida non fricda”), vigilat had become 
*viglat, and digitus in some places had become dictus (Frans. a 
I, 15-16): cf. § 233. 
This y, when it was intervocalic, fused, in nearly all the 
Empire, with the following ¢ or z if this vowel was stressed: 
magister > * mayister > maester; so *pa(g)é(n)sis, re(g)ina, vi- 
(g)inti, etc.; similarly perhaps the proclitic ma(g)is. Cf 
Agrientum, Beevre = viginti, paeortpo, etc., Vok. II, 461 (cf. 
maestati, Vok. II, 460); trienta, S. 349, Pirson 97; guarranta = 
guadraginta, Pirson 97; @liens, colliens, diriens, negliencia, 
Haag 34; vecolliendo, etc., F. Diez, Grammaire des langues ro- 
manes 1, 250. After the accent, and after a consonant, the 
y regularly remained, except when analogy forced its disap- 
pearance (as in codliens through *co/liente, etc.): légit, léges, 
plingit, argéntum. But sometimes it fused with a following 7 
in proparoxytones: voitus (= rdgitus = rogétus), Vok. Il, 461. 
Spain, a part of southwestern Gaul, and portions of Sar- 
dinia, Sicily, and southwestern Italy remained at the y stage; 
elsewhere the y developed further in the Romance languages. 
C£. Lat. Spr. 473. 
1Some light is thrown on the later clerical pronunciation by a statement in a 
fragment of a tenth century treatise on Latin pronunciation, Thurot 77, to the effect 
g has “its own sound” (i.e., that of English gin gem) before ¢ and i, but is “ weak” 
before other vowels.

260. A” as early as the third century must have had nearly 
everywhere a front, or preepalatal, articulation: Xentu, duk‘ere. 
The next step was the development of an audible glide, a 
short’ 7, between the % and the following vowel: &yentu, 
duk'yere. By the fifth century the % had passed a little 
further forward and the ’y had become /’y. fyentu, dut'yere. 
Through a modification of this glide the group then, in the 
sixth or seventh century, developed into 7's’ or és: ¢’s'entu or 
tsentu. 
Speakers were apparently unaware of the phenomenon until 
the assibilation was complete. There is no mention of it by 
the earlier grammarians: S, 340. In the first half of the third 
century some writers distinguish ce, Za, and gu, apparently as 
prepalatal, mediopalatal, and postpalatal; in the fifth century 
we find BINTCENTE, INTCITAMENTO: P. E. Guarnerio in Suppie- 
menti all’ Archivio glottologico italiano IV (1897), 21-51 (cf. 
Rom. XXX, 617). S. 348 cites res[ir], paze (6th or 7th cen- 
tury). Cf. Vos. I, 163. Frankish “vs (German zis) is from 
census, borrowed probably in the fifth century: F. G. Mohl, 
Zs. XXVI, 595-7 
Sc was palatalized also: créscére, co(g)ndscére, fascem, nascére, 
piscem, etc. Cf. CONSIENSIA, SEPTRVM, S. 348. 
261. For a discussion of the subject, see H. Schuchardt, 
Vok. 1, 151, and Ztb/t. XIV, 360; G. Paris in Journal des sa- 
vants, 1900, 359, in the Annuaire de PEcole pratique des

1In the school pronunciation of the seventh and eighth centuries c before ¢ and i 
was probably és. In the treatise cited in the preceding note, Thurot 77, it is stated 
that ¢ has “its own sound” before ¢ and i, and is almost like g before other vowels.

263. XK and g before vowels not formed in the front of the 
mouth usually remained unchanged: canis, gustus, pacare, ne- 
gare. See, however, § 256. Inasmuch as a had in Gaul a 
front pronunciation ($194), 4a, ga in most of that country 
became #’a, g’a, probably by the end of the seventh century, 
and then developed further: carum> Fr. cher, gamba> Fr. 
Jambe. 
Intervocalic g before the accent fell in many words in all 
or a part of the Empire, and apparently remained—perhaps 
under learned or under analogical influence —in others: 
avstvs from the second century on, Carnoy 127 (cf. AvsTE, 
S. 349); FRVALITAS, S. 349; so *ledlis, *lidmen, *realis (for 
realis in Gl. Reich., see Zs. XXX, 50); so, too, the proclitic 
eo for ego, found about the sixth century, Vo&. I, 129 (other 
examples in manuscripts, Franz. a II, 242-243). But Uigare, 
négare, paganus. 
(3) C AnD G FINAL AND BEFORE CONSONANTS. 
264. At the end of a word the guttural seems to have been 
regularly preserved in Vulgar Latin: dic, dic, ecce hic, eccu’hae, 
fac, hoc, sic; cf. Italian dimmi (< dic mi), fammi (<fac mi), 
siffatto (< sic factum). 
Occasionally, however, the c must have been lost, —mainly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  § 268] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 113 
no doubt, through assimilation to a following initial con- 
sonant: Fa for fac, Zs. XXV, 735. In late texts mec is often 
written ze before a consonant, and there is a confusion of sé 
and sic: Franz. a II, 215-224, 236-240. 
265. Before another consonant 4 and g were for the most 
part kept through the Vulgar Latin period: actus, oclus,; frig- 
dus, * viglat (§ 233). 
For sw = gu, see § 254. For ks = 4, see § 255. 
266. KX? in some parts of Italy was assimilated into ¢# by 
the beginning of the fourth century, in the south even in the 
first century: FATA, OTOGENTOS, in Pompeii, Zat Spr. 476; 
AVTOR, LATTVC (301 A. D.), OTOBRIS (380 A. D.), PRAFETTO, 
fetes, Ss. 348; App. Pr. “auctor non autor”; Festus, “dumecta 
antiqui quasi dumecita appellabant que nos dumera,” S. 348. 
The Celts perhaps pronounced the Latin cf as y¢ from the 
beginning, inasmuch as their own ¢/ had become y¢ (e.g., Old 
Irish ocht-n corresponding to Latin octo, Windisch 394, 398- 
399); and likewise substituted ys for ks. *faytum > Fr. fait, 
*eysire > Pr. eissir. Cf. Einf. § 186, Gram. I, § 650. The 
resultant phenomena can, however, be explained otherwise: 
Suchier 735. 
267. V&¢ became y/, which seems to have been assimilated 
into w/in parts of the Empire, probably by the first century 
defuntus, regnancte, sante, Lat. Spr. 472; santo, S. 278; cuntis, 
santus, Carnoy 172. 
There is reason to believe, however, that the y was retained 
very generally in Gaul and perhaps some other regions, and 
subsequently drawn forward to the prepalatal position—w’- 
sanctum > Fr., Pr. saint, sanh, etc. 
268. Gm became um: fraumenta, fleuma, Lat. Spr. 472; 
App. Pr. “pegma non peuma” (i.€., wiypa); St. Isidore, “sagma
-P-A-G-E-132
114 An Intropuction To VuLcaR LarTIN. [s 272 
que corrupte vulgo sauma [or salma] dicitur” (i.e., odypa), 
S. 327. Cf. Italian soma, and also salma, which comes from 
sauma as calma from xatpa. Soma occurs in Gl. Reich. 
269. Gz was variously treated in different regions, being 
preserved in some, assimilated into 7’ or 2 in others, and sub- 
jected to still further modifications: renante, renum, Haag 34. 
Cf. Lat. Spr. 476. 
In cognésco the g generally disappeared, the word being 
decomposed—after the fall of initial g in gwosco—into co— and 
nosco; similarly the g was sometimes lost in cognatus: Vok. I, 
115-116, connato, cunnuscit, etc. 
270. Gr, between vowels, in popular words apparently 
became 7 in parts of the Empire: /ra(g)rare, inte(g)rum, 
ni(g)rum, pere(g)rinum, pi(g)ritia. 
c. PALATALS. 
271. Latin 7 was pronounced 4, being identical in sound 
with the consonant that developed out of e and Z (§ 224): 
Jam, conjux, cijus; eamus, habeam, téneat, filia, vénio. Instead 
of 7 (=/) the spelling #7 was often used: codiugi, eiius, Neu- 
mann, Fortsefzung 7. 
When »y followed a consonant, that consonant was often 
more or less assimilated, sometimes entirely absorbed by the 
y. Palatalization was commonest in Gaul, rarest in Dacia. 
272. Dy and gy, in the latter part of the Empire, probably 
were reduced to y in’ vulgar speech: dedrsum, ditirnus; adju- 
tare, audiam, gaudium, hodie, ddium, podium, videam; exagium, 
fageus. Compare 0ZE = hodie (S. 323) and Zovdeia =/ulia 
(Eckinger 80); zaconvs = diaconus, etc. (S. 324)-and zESV 
=Jesu, ZVNIOR=Junior (S. 239). Cf. afutit =adjutet, Pirson 
76; madias = maias, 364 a.D., Stolz 275, Pirson 75, Carnoy
-P-A-G-E-133
§ 274] An InrRopuctTion To VuLGAR LaTIN. IIs 
162; madio= maio, Haag 34; magias = maias, Carnoy 162, 
S. 349; suria = jurgia, Sepwos = Sergius, Carnoy 161; aios= 
dyws, Vok. I, 461; Congianus = Condianus, Carnoy 162; cor- 
ridie = corrigia, Remidium = Remigium, Haag 34; anoget= 
*inodiat, Gl. Reich. 
De, di, however, towards the end of the Empire, had 
another—doubtless more elegant—pronunciation, which was 
probably dz: pddium> It. poggio, but médium> It. mezzo. 
Servius zz Virg. Georg. II, 216, says, “Media, di sine sibilo 
proferenda est, graccum enim nomen est,” S. 320. St. Isidore 
writes, “solent Itali dicere ozée pro odie,’ S. 321. The letter 
Z is often used in inscriptions, but we generally cannot tell 
whether it means dy, y, or dz (cf. § 339): zES=dies, S. 323; 
fu=die, Audollent 537; ZOGENES, S. 324; cf. sacritus = didxpitos, 
Waters Ch. 63. 
In most words the vulgar y prevailed, in others—especially 
in Italy—the cultivated dz; from radius Italian has both raggio 
and vazzo. The dz pronunciation was especially favored after 
a consonant: hdrdeum> It. orzo, prandium > It. pranzo. 
273. It appears that the labials were not regularly assimi- 
lated in Vulgar Latin: sapiam> It. sappia, Pr. sapcha, etc. 
But through the analogy of audio>*auyo, video >* veyo, etc., 
and perhaps through slurring due to constant and careless use, 
habeo, debeo often became *ayo, *deyo: cf. It. aggio, deggio, 
beside abbi0, debbio. The reduced forms generally prevailed, 
but not everywhere. For p/ivia a form *p/oja was substituted 
in most of the Empire: cf. §§ 169, 208,(4). 
274. Ly, ny, between vowels, probably became 7’, x’ before 
the end of the Empire: /z/ius, folia, mélius, palea, tilia; His- 
pania, téneat, véniam, This palatal pronunciation may be 
represented by the spellings Aureia, Corneius, fiios, etc., S. 327
-P-A-G-E-134
116 Aw IntTRopuCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 276 
Lily, l’g’, ’'g’ were probably reduced to /’ somewhat later: 
allium, malleus; colligit; ex-eligit. 
Oleum, from é\aov, is an exception: cf. It., Sp. o/io, Pg. 
oleo, Pr. oli, Fr. huile; the foreign words borrowed from 
Latin o/eum indicate the same irregularity. 
For zy, see § 296. 
275. Sy, between vowels, doubtless became during the 
Vulgar Latin period s’, a sound similar to English s/ in ship: 
basium, caseus, mansionem, etc. 
Ssy, scy, sty were generally assimilated later: *dassiare, fascia, 
postea, Cf. consiensia, Pirson 72. 
For the confusion of sy and 7y, see § 277. 
276. Cy and 4, in the second and third centuries, were very 
similar in sound, being respectively 4’y and ¢’y (cf. Fr. Riguier 
and fitié in popular speech), and hence were often confused: 
*Apovetavés = Aruntianus, 131 A.D., Eckinger 99; TERMINA- 
CIONES (2d century), concupiscencia (an acrostic in Com- 
modian), /usticia (in an edict of Diocletian), many examples 
in Gaul in the sth century, Lat. Spr. 475; defeniciones (222- 
235 A.D.), 0cio (389 A. D.), sfaacio (601 A.D.), fercius, S. 323} 
oracionem (601 A.D.), fercia, Pirson 71; mendatium, servicium, 
etc. Bon. 171; especially common in Gallic inscriptions of the 
seventh century, Stolz 51. Cf. Voz. 1, ro ff.; Densusianu 111. 
In later school pronunciation cy and ¢y were sounded alike. 
According to Albinus (S. 321) “denedictio et oratio et talia ¢ 
debent habere in pznultima syllaba, non «.” In the treatise 
published by Thurot (see footnote to § 259), p. 78, we are told 
that “#, unless preceded by s, is pronounced like ¢, as in e¢éam, 
prophetia, quatio, silentium; ti, furthermore, is confused with 
ci, the spelling ¢ being prescribed in amicicia, avaricia, duricia, 
Justicia, leticia, malicia, pudicicia, etc., also in nuncius, ocium,
-P-A-G-E-135
  § 277] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 117 
spacium, tercius. Cf. Gl. Reich.: audatia, speties, sotium; am- 
bicio, inicio, spacio, tristicia, etc. 
This similarity or identity of sound led, in some cases, either 
locally or in the whole Empire, to the substitution of suffixes 
and to other permanent transfers of words from one class to 
the other: cf. Carnoy 151-154. Hence arose numerous double 
forms: condicio conditio, solacium solatium; later avaritia —cia, 
*cominitiare —ciare, servitium —cium, etc.; so many proper 
names, Anitius —cius, etc., S. 324. Cf. A. Horning in Zs. XXIV, 
545. This explains such seemingly anomalous developments 
as *exguartiare >It. sguarciare, *gutteare >It. gocciare, etc, 
A number of words evidently had a popular pronunciation with 
¢ and a school pronunciation with %, or vice versa: cf. It. 
comenzare cominciare, etc.’ 
277. T’y developed sporadically in the second century, reg- 
ularly by the fourth, into ¢s (cf. §260): CRESCENTSIAN[VS], 
140 A.D., S. 323; MARSIANESSES = Martianenses, 3d century, 
Carnoy 154; zoporys = Theodorus, etc., S. 324, Vok. I, 68; 
ampittatru, Vincenttus, Audollent 537. Servius in Don. (S. 
320) says, “ Iotacismi sunt quotiens post //— vel di— syllabam 
sequitur vocalis, et plerumque supradicte syllabe in sibilum 
transeunt.” Papirius, cited by Cassiodorus (S. 320): “/ustitia 
cum scribitur, tertia syllaba sic sonat quasi constet ex tribus 
litteris, 4, 2, et 7”; he goes on to state that it is always so when 
7 is followed by a vowel other than 7 (as in Zatius, otia, but 
not in oti, justiti’), except in foreign proper names or after s 
(as in justius, castius). Pompeius says the same thing at con- 
siderable length, adding (S. 320), “si dicas Zi#ius, pinguius 
sonat et perdit sonum suum et accipit sibilum.” Consentius

  118 AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [gs 281 
mentions the assibilation in e/iam, St. Isidore in justitia: S. 
320-321. Welsh words borrowed from Latin before the fourth 
century show no assibilation; but names in —//acum, carried 
into Brittany in the second half of the fifth century, are 
assibilated (e.g., Metiacus > Messac). 
At an intermediate stage between ¢y and ¢s— say ?¢’s‘y — the 
group, if the 7’ was rather weak, was easily confused with sy. 
Examples are very numerous: OBSERVASIONE, 5th century, 
S. 323, Pirson 71; diposisio = depositio, hocsies, sepsies, 6th cen- 
tury, S. 323; /ersdo, Pirson 71; cf. Vok. 1,153. Clerical usage 
for a while doubtless favored sy for zy, and many words have 
preserved it in various regions, especially in suffixes: palatium 
sium, pretium —sium, ratio —sio, statio —sio, servitium —sium, 
etc.; hence Italian palagio beside palazzo, etc., and —igia beside 
—ezza from —itia. Cf. Ltblt, XXVII, 65; Rom. XXXV, 480. 
278. ’y was assibilated sporadically in the third century, 
but not regularly until the fifth or sixth, after the assibilation 
of ¢’y was completed: Mapowvds = Marcianus, 225 a. D.. Eck 
inger 103; judigsium, 6th century, Carnoy 154; so facio, 
glacies, placeam, etc. The resulting sibilant was different from 
that which came from /’y: faciam>It. faccia, vitium>It. vezzo. 
But the intermediate stages were similar enough to lead to 
some confusion, and the ultimate products have become iden- 
tical in many regions. 
279. For #’, g’, not followed by y, see Gutturals. 
d. DENTALS. 
280. The dentals were pronounced with the middle of the 
tongue arched up and the tip touching the gums or teeth, as 
in modern French, and not as in English: S. 301-302, 307. 
281. D regularly remained unchanged: dare, perdo, modus, 
quid.
-P-A-G-E-137

Oscan and Umbrian had zm corresponding to Latin nd: 
Sittl 37. There is some indication that this pronunciation was 
locally adopted in Latin: aGENN#, VERECVNNYS, etc., S. 311> 
312; “grundio non grunnio,”’ App. Pr. If this was the case, 
the central and southern Italian mw for nd (as guannu for 
quando) may go back to ancient times: Zaz. Spr. 476. 
(1) Occasionally @>/: old dacruma>lacrima; App. Pr., “adipes non 
alipes.” Cf. Liquids. Cf. § 289, (3). 
(2) In a few words d>r: medidies by dissimilation > meridies; AR- 
VORSVM = adversum, S. 311; Consentius blames “eres pro pedes,” S. 311. 
The cases seem to be sporadic and due to different special causes. 
282. At the end of a word there was hesitation between d@ 
and ¢; @ may have been devocalized before a voiceless initial 
consonant, and possibly at the end of a phrase: APvD APVT, 
S. 365; capud in Gregory the Great; FECIT FECED, etc., S. 365; 
INQVID, SET, etc., S. 366-367; aput, guot, set, Carnoy 180. 
Some of the confusion was doubtless due to the fall of both d 
and ¢; see § 285. 
In proclitics assimilation naturally went further, as we may 
infer from the treatment of the prefix ad; people probably 
said not only at ze (cf. attendere) but sometimes *ar Romam 
(cf. arrigere). So the final consonant eventually often dis- 
appeared. Cf. S. 358-359. Grammarians warn against the 
confusion of ad and az, etc., S. 365-366. Cf. ad eos and at ea, 
etc., Carnoy 179-180; 7d it, guid quit, Carnoy 180; a, guo and 
co, Haag 29. 
Jilud, through the analogy of other neuters, became #//um : 
Haag 29, ¢/lum corpus, etc. 
283. Intervocalic d, perhaps at the end of the Vulgar Latin 
period, became d in Spain, Gaul, Reetia, northern Italy, and a 
part of Sardinia: videre>* vedere. Similarly intervocalic dy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-138

either at the same time or later, became 07 in Spain and Gaul:

In guadraginta, dr>rr: quarranta, Pirson 97. 
284. Z' usually remained unchanged: /éneo, sitis, partem, 
facit. 
Zl, however, seems to have regularly become ¢/: astiila> 
Pr. ascla; stloppus > *scloppus > It. schioppo; ustulare> Pr. 
usclar. Cf. sciit- and scitip- (from s/lis stlitis), S. 312-313;

dicendum,” Keil VII, 105, 107; App. Pr. “capitulum non 
capiclum,” “vetulus non veclus,” “vitulus non viclus.’ For 
—tulus >—clus, cf. § 234. 
Between s and / a ¢ developed: Caper, “fessu/um non 
pestulum” (hence Italian festio, etc.), S. 315. So probably

285. Final ¢ fell in Volscian (/asia= faciat), often in 
Umbrian (/ade), occasionally in Faliscan: Hammer 5, 7, 8. 
In early dialects we find such forms as cvpa, DEDE: S. 367. 
In Latin, final ¢ disappeared early in the Empire in southern 
Italy, and during the Empire in most of Italy and Dacia; 
Rumanian, Italian (except Sardinian), and also Spanish and 
Portuguese show no trace of final ¢ except in monosyllables. 
Cf. Hammer 28-32. The first sure examples of the fall in 
Latin are found in Pompeii; others appear later in the inscrip- 
tions in Christian Rome and northern Italy, as ama, peria, 
rélingue, valia, vixi, etc.: S. 367-368, Lat. Spr. 472. Gaul, 
Retia, and Sardinia kept the ¢ late; but forms without the 
consonant (as audivi, posui) — possibly due to Italian stone- 
cutters—occur in Gallic inscriptions. Fredegarius wrote e for 
et: Haag 29. 
Final z¢ perhaps lost its ¢ before consonants: Zaz. Spr
-P-A-G-E-139
  
§ 288] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 121 
473-474. The Romance languages show forms with 7/, with 
n, and without either consonant. Vé, in general, is preserved 
in the same regions as 4 In inscriptions we find: dedro and 
dedrot, in Pisaurum, S. 365; posuerun, restituerun, Lat. Spr. 
473-474. Cf. Lindsay 124. 
Final s¢, likewise, may have lost its ¢ before consonants — 
as post illum but pos’ me, est amatus but es’ portatus: Lat. Spr. 
473. Pos is very common in inscriptions, and es is found: S. 
368. Cf. pos, posguam in R. 470. According to Velius 
Longus, Cicero favored posmeridianus; Marius Victorinus 
preferred posguam: S. 368. Both stand s are represented in 
the Romance languages. 
For the confusion of final d and 4, see § 282: capud, feced, 
inguid are found. When ¢ did not fall, it was doubtless often 
voiced, inside a phrase, before a vowel or a voiced consonant. 
Caput became capus (Pirson 238) or *capum. Fredegarius 
uses capo: Haag 29. 
286. Intervocalic ¢ was voiced to din Spain, Gaul, Retia, 
and northern Italy probably in the fifth or sixth century: cf. 
§256. Inscriptions show a few such forms as amadus, S. 309. 
Such a spelling as retere for reddere (S. 309) may indicate un- 
certainty in the use of d and ¢ 
Later this d>0 in northern Gaul and Spain. In Gaul and 
Spain, moreover, 4>ar>0r. Cf. § 283.

287. Z had a convex formation, like @ and ¢ (cf. § 280): S. 
306-307, 309. 
288. Priscian I, 38 (S..324) writes: “Z triplicem, ut Plinio 
videtur, sonum habet: exilem, quando geminatur secundo loco

posita, ut 7-/e, Metel-lus; plenum, quando finit nomina vel 
syllabas et quando aliquam habet ante se in eadem syllaba 
consonantem, ut so/, silva, flavus, clarus; medium in aliis, ut 
lectus, lectum.” Consentius distinguishes the “sonus exilis,” 
which he ascribes to initial and double 7 (as in /ana, il/e), 
from the “pinguis,” heard defore a consonant (as in a/bo, alga, 
etc.): S. 326. Other grammarians blame, in obscure terms, 
a faulty pronunciation of / particularly prevalent in Africa or 
Greece: S. 325-326. See also Zs. XXX, 648. 
It is likely that 7 before or after another consonant had a 
thick sound caused by lifting the back of the tongue. Lefove 
consonants, this formation led in some regions, sporadically 
by the fourth century but regularly not until the eighth and 
ninth and later (Zaz. Spr. 476), to the vocalization of 7 into 
u: xavxovAaty in an edict of Diocletian, 301 a.p., Eckinger 12; 
cauculus in manuscripts, Vok. II, 494. After consonants, this 
elevation, shifted forwards, brought about the palatalization of 
Zin Spanish and Italian: clavem> &l’ave> Sp. lave, It. chiave. 
According to H. Osthoff, Dunkles und helles \ im Lateinischen 
in the Zransactions of the American Philological Association 
XXIV, 50, intervocalic 7, except before 7, also had the thick 
sound —as in famulus (but not in similis): thus is explained 
the different fate of @ in calére>Old Fr. chaloir and gallina> 
Old Fr. geline, etc. 
289. During the Latin period 7 regularly remained un- 
changed: Zina, altus, mille, sol. It seems to have fallen ir

(1) Metathesis occurs occasionally: Consentius (S. 327) blames “coacla

(2) There are sporadic examples of the dissimilation of two 7s:

MVNTV for multum, C. I. L. IV, 1593. Cf. S. 327.

scribebat et dicebat Aadamitatem pro calamitate.” Cf. § 281, (1). 
(2) & 
290. # in Classic and Vulgar Latin was probably a gingival 
or: prepalatal trill: S. 307, 309, 328. It generally resisted 
change: 7idet, carrus, ciirsus, pater. 
291. In many words, however, 7s> ss. The principle seems 
to have been that original 7s remained, while old 7ss, coming 
from 7tt, was early reduced to ss: Lat Spr. 471.  Velius 
Longus says (S. 330): “Dossum per duo s quam per 7 quidam 
ut lenius enuntiaverunt, ac tota 7 littera sublata est in eo quod 
est rusum et retrosum.” Russum rusum, susum occur in early 
writers; dextrosus, introsus, risus, suso, susum, etc., in inscrip- 
tions: S. 330. App. Pr. has pessica; Gl. Reich. has ius = 
deorsum. The assimilation was not consistently carried out 
everywhere, being probably somewhat hindered by school in- 
fluence. It took place in the whole territory in deorsum and 
sursum; in most of the Empire in dorsum; in about half the 
Empire in férsica; locally in alidrsum, retrorsum, revérsus, 
versus. 
After long vowels the ss>s (see § 161); so sissum>sisum, 
while déssum remained unchanged: susum, Waters Ch. 77; 
suso susu susum, Bechtel 83: susum very common, R, 460-461; 
diosum, R. 460. Cf. Corssen I, 243. 
292. Moreover, there was a strong tendency to dissimilate 
two 7’s, although it was only sporadically carried out: in Old 
Latin, -aris after r>-alis, as in floralis; App. Pr., “terebra 
non ¢e/ebra”; in inscriptions we find repeatedly felegrinus

(Sittl 74), also ministorum, perpenna= Perperna, propietas, 
propio, S. 329; albor, coliandrum, criblare, flagrare, meletrix, 
plurigo are attested likewise, Za‘ Spr. 477. Pompeius (S. 
329) says: “Barbarismus, quando dico mamor pro eo quod 
est marmor.” Cf. Italian propio, dietro drieto. 
293. Velius Longus (S. 329) tells us that in elegant speech 
per before Z was pronounced /e/, as in pellabor, pellicere. Cf. 
PELLIGE, etc., S. 329. So Italian per lo > pello, averlo> (in 
Old It.) avedlo. This assimilation was probably not wide- 
spread in Latin; it has left very few traces in the Romance 
languages. Cf. Italian Cardo, merlo, orlo, perla, etc. 
294. Metathesis is not uncommon: S. 330-331. Consentius 
mentions “perlum pro prelum,” S. 330. Crocodilus appears as 
corcodilus, cocodrilus, corcodrillus, S. 33%; cf. Italian coccodrillo. 
S. 330 notes prRaNcatiI. For guatro, *sempre, etc., see § 245. 
An intrusive 7 is found in cu/citra, Waters Ch. 38. 
295. Final 7, except in monosyllables, fell, probably before 
the end of the Vulgar Latin period, in most of Italy and 
Dacia: sdéror> It. suora, Rum. soaru, Sittl 11 mentions an 
early fall of final y among the Falisci and the Marsi, as in 
mate, uxo; Cf. FRATE, MATE.

period, although it may have been reduced to y in parts of 
Italy: corium> *coryu and possibly *coyu (cf. It. cugio). 
f. SIBILANTS. 
297. S seems to have been dental, with the upper surface 
of the tongue convex (cf. § 280): S. 302, 304, 307-308. 
The old voiced s having become 7 (S. 314-315), Classic 
Latin s was probably always voiceless and remained so in
-P-A-G-E-143
§ 298] An InrRODUCTION TO VULGAR LALIN. 125 
Vulgar Latin (S. 302-304): this is indicated by the fact that 
intervocalic s is still generally surd in Spanish (casa, etc.) and 
in most popular words in Tuscan (vaso, etc.) ; corroborative 
evidence, as far as it goes, is furnished by such spellings as 
nupsi, pleps, urps, also maximus, rexi, etc., and the develop. 
ment of a in such words as Ademps, sumpsi. At the very end 
of the Vulgar Latin period, however, intervocalic s may have 
become voiced in some regions (cf. § 256): causa, misi, etc. 
Classic Latin s was generally preserved: séx, dssum, ciir- 
sus, iste. 
298. Final s often fell in Umbrian (Amaze), and occasion- 
ally in Faliscan: Hammer 5, 8. Cf. Sittl 27, who cites Um- 
brian PIsAvVRESE. In early Latin final s was very weak after 
z and %, and often was not written. Cicero (Lat. Spr. 471) 
says the loss of -s is “subrusticum, olim autem politius.” 
Quintilian also (S. 361) notes the omission of -s by the 
ancients. Ennius and his followers down to Catullus did 
not count —s before a consonant in verse: S. 355-356. Cf. 
Pompeius (Keil V, 108): “5 littera hanc habet potestatem, 
ut ubi opus fuerit excludatur de metro.” In the older inscrip- 
tions —s is freely omitted, but later it is in the main correctly 
used until the second century of our era: Zaz. Spr. 471. The 
omission is commonest in nominative —ds or —is, but occurs 
also in -és and —ds, rarely in —ds: bonu, Cornelio, nepoti, pieta, 
TLerentio, unu, etc., and matrona for matronas, S. 361-362. 
According to Chronologie 175-186, the nominative singular 
without s (as Cornelio, filio) predominated in centra! Italy 
until the time of Cesar, when —s was partially restored; but 
by 150 to 200 a.p. the forms without s became common   
1In the previously cited Latin treatise (see footnote to §259), Thurot 77, s be- 
tween vowels is described as “weak,” except in compounds, such as vesolvit. This 
evidently indicates a voicing in late school pronunciation.  
-P-A-G-E-144

again, and prevailed in central Italy in the third century (eéo 
for ¢us, liberio, etc.). Cf. morbu = morbus, etc., Audollent 
539, 540; filio = filios, C. 1. L. 1X, 1938. In most of Italy, 
and probably in Dacia, final s disappeared for good from the 
common pronunciation in the second and third centuries, ex- 
cept in monosyllables (Lat. Spr. 471): amdtis> It. amate, 
séntis>It. sentt, tempus>It. tempo; but das>It. dai, tres>Old 
It. ‘rei (later ¢re). Cf. Hammer 19-28, Densusianu 122-123. 
In Gaul, Spain, and some other regions, —s, probably owing 
to the previous linguistic habits of the natives, was strongly 
pronounced and therefore preserved. Carnoy 185-206 re- 
cords the omission of —s in many inscriptions, but notes that 
as this nearly always happens at the end of a line it is doubt- 
less only a conventional abbreviation. 
299. According to Velius Longus (S. 316), vams— became 
tra— before d, 7, and sometimes before m and fp: tradusxit, tra- 
jecit; tra(ns)misit, tra(ns)posuit; transtulit, We sometimes 
find, however, ‘vansduco and transjicio. Both forms occur 
before Zand v: fra(ns)luceo, tra(ns)veho. 
Italy generally favored ¢ra— (but ¢rasporre), Gaul and Spain 
usaally preferred ¢vas— (but ‘raduire, traducir). 
300. In presbyter, a new nominative constructed from zpeo- 
Bdrepos, the s fell in Italy and elsewhere through the substitu- 
tion of the prefix Av@— (as in preditor) for the unusual initial 
pres—: hence It. prete, Pr. preveire (<*prebjtérum). 
301. For prosthetic 7 or e before s + consonant, see § 230. 
In Old French pasmer (from spasmus) the s was lost prob- 
ably through confusion with es— coming from the prefix ex-.

303. J, like d and ¢ (§ 280), was dental or gingival, witl 
an arched tongue: S. 269-270. 
M and 2, initial and intervocalic, regularly remained un- 
changed: méus, ndster, amat, vénit. For the reduction of 
minus— to mis—, see § 245. There was a dissimilation of two 
n’s in Bononia > It. Bologna. 
304. MZ and 2%, final or followed by a consonant, were 
obscure and weak in Classic Latin; the preceding vowel 
must have been partly nasalized, and the mouth closure in- 
complete. According to Priscian (S. 275), “mm obscurum in 
extremitate dictionum sonat, ut /emp/um, apertum in prin- 
cipio, ut magnus, mediocre in mediis, ut wmébra.” Terentianus 
Maurus (S. 275) says that for # the air comes through both 
nose and mouth. So Marius Victorinus (S. 275): “MV vero 
sub convexo palati lingua inherente gemino naris et oris 
spiritu explicabitur.” The same author describes (S. 275) a 
sound between m and m: “Omnes fere aiunt inter m et x lit- 
teras mediam vocem que non abhorreat ab utraque littera sed 
neutram proprie exprimat.” Cf. S. 276. 
305. In Classic Latin the nasal naturally took before 
labials the form of m; before dentals, x; before / and z, 
probably first m, then 7, as the pronunciation of these frica- 
tives changed from bilabial to dentilabial (cf. § 320); before 
gutterals, 7- combura, immitto, imperio; conduco, contineo, inno 
cens; comfluo confluo, comvenio convenio; anguis, ingutt, uncu. 
(cf. IVNCXI, NVNCQvaM, S. 278). Cf.S. 270, 279-280. They 
—or “z adulterinum”— is described by Nigidius (in Gellius), 
and also by Priscian, as between and g (S. 275); cf. S. 269- 
270,272. Before liquids the nasal was assimilated (co//igo, cor- 
rigo, etc.), before s it was silent (cosw/, etc.: cf. §§ 171, 311).
-P-A-G-E-146
128 An IntTRopucTION TO VuLGaR LaTIN. [§ 307 
Final nasals seem to have been adapted, like medial nasals, 
to a following consonant: nom paret, cun dice, nom or non féctt, 
ty carne; nol légo, cur régibus, i senatu., Cicero advocated cun 
nobis; Servius, cun navibus: Lat. Spr. 476. In inscriptions 
we find cun, locun sanctum, nomem, quan floridos, quen, S. 364; 
cf. forsitam mille, Bechtel 81 (forsitam, Carnoy 220). 
306. In the vulgar speech of the Empire the sound before 
labials seems to have been indistinct, and even before dentals 
not always clear (S. 271-272); before f and v there was great 
uncertainty (cf. §§ 171, 311), and there was apparently some 
doubt before gu and gu (S. 272): this is indicated by such 
spellings as senper, guamta, nynfis, nunguam, S. 276-277; con- 
plere, decemter, Carnoy 176; tan mulieribus, Carnoy 220. Cf. 
Carnoy 176-177. In both old and late inscriptions the nasal 
is often omitted altogether before a consonant: Decebris, exe- 
plu, occubas, etc., innoceti, laterna, secudo, etc., iferos, etc., de- 
fucte, pricipis, religuat, etc., S. 273, 281-285. For the change 
of ykt to yf, then to nZ, see § 267: santa, etc., Pirson 92; 
santo, etc., frequent, S. 278. 
The hesitation and inconsistency in spelling are certainly 
due in part to imperfect articulation, largely to mere careless- 
ness in cutting, but in great measure also to the mistaken 
efforts of later writers to restore a real or hypothetical earlier 
orthography: compare the treatment of prefixes, § 32. 
In late Vulgar Latin m, 2, y must have been reinforced, 
as there is little trace of confusion in the Romance lan- 
guages. 
307. Mn seems at one time to have been pronounced »-: 
Quintilian (S. 286) says: “Columnam et consules exempta 7 
littera legimus.” Cf. Priscian (S. 275): ‘/V quoque plenior 
in primis sonat et in ultimis partibus syllabarum, ut xomen, 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  § 309] An IntTRopuUcTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 129 
stamen; exilior in mediis, ut amnis, damnum.” Carnoy 166 
has /nteramico, for —amn-, from the first century. 
Late inscriptions, on the other hand, show a fondness for 
such spellings as calumpnia, dampnum (cf. Bon. 189, cal- 
umpnia, dampnare, etc.); and mpn is common in the early 
Romance languages. It is likely that this orthography indi- 
cates a conscious and painful effort to articulate clearly. 
Toward the end of the Empire fashion evidently prescribed 
a distinct pronunciation of mm, counteracting a previous ten- 
dency to slur the group. 
The Romance languages point to the preservation of mn, 
although it was probably assimilated into mz in central and 
southern Italy before the Empire was over (Zaz. Spr. 476): 
Lnteranniensis, Carnoy 166. 
308. Between mand s or /a f generally developed in Latin 
—that is to say, the latter part of the m was unvoiced and 
denasalized before the surd that followed; this 4 was not al- 
ways written: sum(p)s7, sum(p)tus, etc. Cf. S. 298. 
309. Final m often fell in Umbrian (as in puplu), occa- 
sionally in Faliscan: Hammer 5, 8. In Old Latin it was 
weak: S. 356. It is often omitted in inscriptions down to 
130 B.C., and again in late plebeian inscriptions; in the last 
century of the Republic and the first two centuries of the 
Empire the traditional spelling is carefully observed: early 
and late such forms as dece, eoru, mecu, mense, septe, unu are 
very common, and conversely forms with a superfluous ™, 
S. 363-364; cf. Audollent 539-540, abundant examples; Aff. 
Pr., ide, xumgua, oli, passi, pride. The omission of —m and 
the wrong use of it are very frequent in the Per. gue ad mo- 
dum, terra, Bechtel 79; jacente, etc., accedere, etc., Bechtel 80; 
dormito for dormitum, Bechtel 91; cf. Bechtel 107. So R. 462,
-P-A-G-E-148

 ardente lucernam, etc. According to Quintilian (S. 362), Cato 
said dice hanc; he adds that there is scarcely any m audible 
in tantum ille, quantum erat. 
Final m before vowels seems to have been, from early times, 
only a weak nasal glide: in cérvcueo it disappears (S. 274), in 
poetry it may be disregarded (cf. audiendu’st, etc., S. 361). 
Before consonants it was assimilated (cf. TAN DvRVM, etc., 
5. 361): see § 305. Cf. S. 356-358, 360. Carnoy 206-221, 
who notes the omission of —# in many inscriptions under all 
possible conditions, reaches the conclusion that it became 
silent at the end of polysyllables by the first century, having 
disappeared very early before vowels, next before spirants and 
at the end of a phrase, then (by assimilation) before other 
consonants. 
In the opinion of Schuchardt, Voz. I, 110-112, the preced- 
ing vowel was nasalized. The contrary view is maintained by 
Seelmann, 288-292. As the fall of m seems to have been due 
primarily to a failure to close the lips completely between two 
vowels, it is likely that the nasalization was slight. 
The Romance languages point to a loss of —m in all words 
but monosyllables: damnu(m), possu(m), ténea(m); ciim, jam, 
quém (quen, Audollent 537). Cf. Hammer 32-41. 
310. Final # must have been indistinct (S. 358), but it seems 
to have been reinforced in Classic speech (S, 286). The pre- 
fix con— became co— before vowels, as in coactum, coherere, co- 
hors, coicere: S. 274, 282. Before gn, too, the final of prefixes 
fell very early, as in cognatus, cognosco, ignotus: S. 274. Other- 
wise there is no sure proof of the fall of —7 in Latin (S. 364— 
365), but there is abundant evidence of its assimilation to a 
following labial (1m BELLO, etc., S. 361): see § 305; cf. Lat. 
Spr. 473. For further assimilation, cf. Caper (Keil VII. 106), 
“in Siciliam dicendum, non és Siciliam”: see § 311. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  § 311] Aw INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 131 
The Romance languages indicate the disappearance of —”, 
except in monosyllables: xdme(n), séme(m); in, non. It prob- 
ably fell late, after the Vulgar Latin period: Zaz. Spr. 473. 
For final w/, see § 285. 
311. Before fricatives or spirants regularly fell, probably 
through nasalization of the preceding vowel: see §171. This 
phenomenon was only partially recognized by Classic au- 
thority: —ensimus >-ésimus, —iens > —iés, —onsus > —Osus, as 
in vicesimus, toties, formosus (S. 273); 2s, however, was kept 
in participles, as védens, mansus; both forms were used in 
-é(n)sis (according to Velius Longus, Cicero preferred /o- 
resia, hortesia, S, 287). Charisius (S. 286) records that ‘“men- 
sam sine n littera dictam Varro ait.” Cf. Quintilian (S, 286), 
“consules exempta 7 littera legimus.” 
In popular speech the fall was probably constant from early 
times: cesor, cojux, cosol, coventionid, iferos, infas, libes, etc., 
S. 274, 281-285; Stolz 243ff. Plautus repeatedly uses mos- 
trare, Stolz 243. Terence seems to intend a rhyme in “neque 
pes neque mens,” Hunuchus 728. Such forms are frequent in 
inscriptions: cofecisse, cofectis, cojugi (very common), covenimus, 
ifer (Capua, 387 A. D.), deri, ifimo, ifra, iventa, resurges (on a 
coin of Vespasian’s reign), S. 274, 281-285. So in Greek- 
letter inscriptions: «runs, dos, etc., Eckinger 80, 113-115. 
Cf. Audollent 538, ¢fev?; Carnoy 177, cojugi, etc., mesis, etc.; 
Pirson 94, infas, remasit; App. Pr. “ansa non asa”; R. 461-

Before f, 7, v, the x was generally restored by analogy (see 
§ 171); such words as conjux, convenio are really new forma- 
tions: S.274. The only sure Romance traces of the loss of #

S. 299; App. Pr., “plasta non blasta,” “ ziziber non ziziper”; cannabis and 
It. canapa. 
313. In Italy and perhaps elsewhere there was a tendency 
to drop # between a consonant and an s or ¢: redemii, etc., 
Pirson 93; scu/tor, etc., S. 299. 
In a part of Italy fs became ss as early as the first century: 
isse for ifse is found in Pompeii, and is attested by Martial 
and possibly by the écse for 7se mentioned by Suetonius, Zaz. 
Spr. 476. 
In central and southern Italy A¢ became ¢¢ probably early in 
the Empire: scritus, etc., S. 299; settembres, 7th century, Car- 
noy 165. Ina part of Gaul captivus seems to have been pro- 
nounced *cayfivus: it may be that in Gallic speech the f¢ of 
this word became y/, as was the case with Celtic s¢ (Dottin 
100; cf. Old Irish secht-n = septem, Windisch 394); or perhaps 
captivus became first *cactivus, under the influence of Celtic 
*cactos (Welsh caeth) = Latin captus (Loth 35). 
314. Intervocalic # probably became ¢@ in the fifth and 
sixth centuries in Spain, Gaul, Reetia, and northern Italy: see 
§ 256. Cf. Pirson 60-61: labidem, etc. Pr likewise became 
br: Abrilis, Pirson 61; debra, Bon. 160; stubrum, Haag 862.

  § 316] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 133 
In northern Gaul intervocalic f and g7, even in clerical Latin, 
developed through 4 and 47 into B and fr by the seventh cen- 
tury: vivaticus, 629 a. D., Vok. I, 128; cavanna, Gl. Reich. 
For pe, pi, see § 273. 
(222: 
315. When 4 was not intervocalic, it usually remained un- 
changed: déne, blitum, oblitus. 
Mb, as in Oscan and Umbrian, became mm in Sicily and 
southern and central Italy, the #m being found in inscriptions 
as far north as Rome: Lat. Sfr. 476. Cf. nd, § 281. 
Before s or / it is likely that 4 regularly became / in Latin, 
although it was often written J- absens apsens, ab— apsolvere, 
plebs pleps, scribst scripsi, scribtum scriptum, trabs traps, urbs 
urps; App. Pr., “celebs non celeps,” “labsus non lapsus.” 
Final 4 must have been often assimilated to a following 
consonant: sud die, 601 a. D., Carnoy 165. { 
316. In the Empire, especially in the second century, initial 
6 and v were much confused in inscriptions (cf. V): diginti, 
bixit, botu, vene, etc., S. 240; Baleria, Balerius, Beneria, Be- 
neti, Betrubius, Bictor, bos, valneas, Audollent 536; African 
birtus, bita, boluntas, Vok. 1, 98; bivere, very common, Carnoy 
140; baluis, Bechtel 78; vibit, etc., R. 456; b0d¢s in Consen- 
tius, Vok, III, 68. 
In the Romance languages there are few, if any, traces of 
such an early interchange. Probably the confusion was mainly 
or wholly graphic, being due to the identity in sound of 6 and v 
between vowels (§ 318): Lat. Spr. 473; cf. Zinf., § 120. The 
Spanish levelling of initial 4 and v does not go back to Vul- 
gar Latin (Carnoy 139-141); the confusion is far commoner 
in Italian inscriptions than in Spanish or Gallic (Carnoy 
142-146). We find also a change of initial v to 4 in north 
Portuguese, Gascon, south Italian, and Old Rumanian.  
-P-A-G-E-152
  134 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 319 
317. After liquids, too, there was a confusion of 4 and v in 
inscriptions, d being substituted for v much oftener than v for 
6: Nerba, salbum, serbus, solbit, etc., S. 240; berbex, Waters 
Ch. 57; solbere, repeatedly, Carnoy 140; solbere, etc., R. 455; 
App. Pr., “alveus non albeus.” 
In all probability v really changed to # after liquids: see V. 
B remained unchanged. 
318. Intervocalic 4 opened into B; the development appar- 
ently began in the first century, was well along in the second, 
and was completed, at least in Italy, in the third: Oiwvia = 
Vibia, Rome, Eckinger 95; DEVERE, DEVITVM, PROVATA, etc., 
S. 240. As v also was pronounced £, a confusion in spelling 
resulted, 4 and w being used indiscriminately: CvRasit, 
IVBENTVTIS, NOBE, etc., S. 240; IVVENTE = jubende, 2d century, 
Linf. 127, § 120; cabia = cavea, Danuvium, Dibona, tubenis, 
vovis, etc., Audollent 536-537; devitum (6th century), /edis, 
redivit, vibi, Carnoy 134-135; annotavimus, lebat, Bechtel 78; 
devetis, habe = ave, rogavo, suabitati, etc., R. 455-456; cf. Stolz 
51, Pirson 61-62, Carnoy 134-136. Cf. V. 
When this 8 became contiguous to a following consonant, 
it was vocalized into wu: *faula, *paraula, *taula, etc. Cf. V. 
Intervocalic 47, perhaps not until the end of our period, 
became #7 in northern Gaul, Retia, part of northern Italy, 
and Dacia. 
(1) In the early stages of clerical Latin intervocalic 6 was pronounced 
8, as in popular speech: */faBula, *taBula, etc. Later, perhaps by the 
seventh century, it was sounded 4, 
(2) In App. Pr. we find “sibilus non sifilus,” and Priscian (S. 300) men- 
tions “sifilum pro sibilum”; cf. French siffer. Perhaps the form with f 
comes from some non-Latin Italic dialect: cf. bubulcus = It. bifolco, and a 
few other words. 
(3) For habébam > * aBea, see § 421. 
319. Ze, bi probably remained unchanged, at least in most
-P-A-G-E-153
  § 322] Aw InrRopuction To VULGAR LATIN. 135 
of the Empire: radies, riibeus, etc. For the analogical change 
of Aabeo to *ayo, débeo to *deyo, see § 273. 
(3) # 
320. F was originally bilabial (S. 294-295), but became 
dentilabial by the middle of the Empire (S. 295): cf. § 305. 
It is the old f, apparently, that is described by Quintilian 
(S. 296-297); a plain description of the dentilabial / is given 
by Terentianus Maurus and Marius Victorinus (S. 296). 
(1) Grammarians speak of an alternation of 4 and /: fedus > hedus, 
Sasena> harena, fircum>hircum, habam> fabam, etc., S. 300. The f and 
the 4 doubtless belonged to different dialects in early Latin; according to 
Varro, Ling. Lat. 5, § 97, the ffor 4 was Sabine. This phenomenon can 
have no connection with the change of initial fto 4 in Spanish and Gascon. 
321. It is probable that intervocalic f became v at the end 
of the Vulgar Latin period (cf. § 256): alevanti = elephanti, 
paceveci = pacifici, pontevecem = pontificem, Haag 32-33. 
(4) V. 322. The letter v was doubtless originally pronounced w; 
but, losing its velar element, the sound was reduced, probably 
early in the Empire, to the bilabial fricative 8. During the 
Empire Greek-letter inscriptions have ov or B for v (Nepova or 
NepBa): Otvovia = Vibia, Rome, Eckinger 95; 8 for v is com- 
mon from the first century on, Eckinger 85-91.  Velius 
Longus, in the middle of the second century, says that the 
in wa/en/e is pronounced “cum aliqua aspiratione”: S, 232. 
Hence arises a complete confusion of intervocalic 4 and v 
(cf. B): CVRABIT, IVBENTVTIS, etc., S. 240; jubari for juvari 
in Gregory the Great. This leads to a graphic confusion of 
initial 4 and v in inscriptions: BIGINTI, BIXIT, BOTV, etc. (so 
INBICTO), S. 240.
-P-A-G-E-154
136 An InTRopucTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. [§ 324 
  Later the bilabial 8 became dentilabial v in most of the 
Empire: cf. § 305. 
For the substitution of w for B or v in a few words, see 
Germanic Consonants. 
323. After liquids @ seems to have closed regularly into 4; 
this state was preserved in Rumanian (Densusianu 97, 103- 
105), but elsewhere the 8 or v was partially restored by school 
influence: CERBVS, CORBI, CVRBATI, FERBEO, NERBA (about 100 
A. D.), SERBAT, SOLBIT, E. G. Parodi in Rom. XXVII, 177, cf. 
§ 317. So vervex became *verbex, then berbex: Waters Ch. 57; 
BERBECES, 2d century, A7zf. 127, § 120 (also in GZ. Reich.). 
Hence came hesitation in spelling (/erveo, ferbui, etc.) and 
inconsistent results in the Romance languages: cérvus > It. 
corbo corvo, Fr. corbeau,; ciirvus > Old Fr., Pr. corp, Sp. corvo; 
nérvus > It. nerbo, Fr. nerf; servare, servire> It. serbare, servire. 
324. Intervocalic w or B had a tendency in older Latin, as 
in Umbrian, to disappear between two like vowels: divinus > 
dinus (cf. Umbrian deivina > deina, Sittl 26), odliviscor> ob- 
liscor, si vis > sis. Cf. Lindsay 52. Also, at all times, before 
or after 0: bovis > bos; devorsum > deorsum,; faor, Pirson 63; 
moere, Audollent 539; NoeuBpws, Vok. II, 479; NOEM[BRIS], 
S. 241; “pavor non paor,” App. Pr.; cf. late noembris, noicius, 
Lindsay 52. “avilla non failla” in App. Pr. seems to be 
isolated. 
In the above cases the fall apparently was only sporadic. 
But before an accented o or w, the w or @ fell regularly in 
most of the Empire: aunculus, Vok. Il, 471 (cf. auncli, Pir- 
son 63); FLAONIVS, S. 241; *padnem; *padrem. 
Furthermore, intervocalic w or 8 regularly disappeared in 
popular speech before any w, probably towards the end of the 
Republic (when —vos >-vus): FLAvS, vIvs, S. 241 (cf. faus in
-P-A-G-E-155
§ 328] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 137 
App. Pr. vius in Pirson 63); oum, Vok. II, 472 (cf. oum in 
Probus, Keil IV, 113); ous, Audollent 539 (cf. zoum, Pirson 
63); gneus, Lindsay 52; datius, Carnoy 128; primitius, Pir- 
son 63; aus, rius, App. Pr. Often, however, the v was re- 
stored, after the analogy of a feminine or a plural form: ovum 
(beside ovm) through ova, rivus (beside vius) through riz, etc. 
Cf. § 167. 
(t) In inscriptions —vs is common in place of —vvs; in most cases this 
is probably only graphic: Carnoy 128-131. The #VM of C. /. Z.I, 1220, 
cited by Schuchardt (Voé. II, 471) and others as eum, is evidently in- 
tended for evum. 
325. When intervocalic w or B became contiguous to a fol- 
lowing consonant, it was vocalized into w (cf. B): Classic 
claudo, naufragus, etc.; Vulgar aucella, triumphaut, etc. 
(5) U. 
326. U in hiatus which had not already become w (§§ 223- 
224) probably took that sound by the end of the Vulgar Latin 
period: eccw’ hic > *eccwic, eccw’ ista > *eccwista, nocui> nocwi, 
placuit>placwit. Before this, the original Latin w (spelled 7) 
had become PB: § 322. 
2. GREEK CONSONANTS. 
327. In Greek the surd and the sonant stops must have 
been less sharply differentiated than in Latin; the sonants 
were perhaps not fully voiced, and the surds doubtless had a 
weak, voiced explosion: so they were not always distinguished 
by the Latin ear. The Greek liquids, nasals, and sibilants 
usually remained unchanged in transmission. 
328. Single consonants sometimes became double in Latin, 
and Greek double consonants sometimes became single: véuos 
> nummus,; éxxdyoia.> ec(c)lesia. Cf. Claussen 847-851.

K, however, often became g; 7 sometimes became 4; of a 
change of + to d there is no example, although xavé:ros for can- 
didus (Eckinger 98) seems to point in that direction: ’Axpdyas

—ritos > buxus, ruppos > burrus, cf. bustiola in Gl. Reich. 
Kv > cin in kvkvos > cicinus > Old. It. cecino. 
331. After nasals, x, 7, 7 regularly came to be pronounced 
g 6, din Greek: dvdyxn > andngi, dapmpds > lambros, dvrpov > 
dndron. This late Greek pronunciation perhaps accounts for 
such cases as xapary > Lat. gamba, ripmravov > Fr. timbre, odv- 
tahov > Fr. sandal, Cf. Claussen 838-841.

S.259; later inscriptions, Z¢odor, nimpe, Cristo, etc., S. 259-260. 
From the middle of the second century B.c. we find the 
spellings TH, PH, CH: Claussen 823-833. People of fashion

  undoubtedly tried to imitate the aspirates (Lindsay 54), but 
popular speech kept the old 4 4, ¢, for new words as well as 
for old: o7a04> spatha = spata; xbdapos > colaphus = colapus, 
ovppuvia> It. zampogna, padrayé > It., Sp. palanca, pavtacia > 
Pr. pantaisar; xopsy > chorda = corda. 
Quintilian (S. 256) says there were no aspirate consonants 
in older Latin. Cicero (S. 256) speaks of using the old, un- 
aspirated pronunciation (as pulcros, triumpos) in order to be 
better understood. The proper spelling is discussed by gram- 
marians: S. 257-258. 
The letter 4 is occasionally misused, as in PHOSIT, PACHE, 
etc.: S260. It is transposed in Phitonis, phitonisse, Bonnet 
141, 218; cf. Mitonis, Fitones in Gl. Reich. 
333. In PddAawa > bal/ena, and some other early adop- 
tions, ¢> 4; perhaps the reason is to be sought in a Greek 
dialect pronunciation: Claussen 829-831. In doy > doga, 
etc, x>g- Claussen 831. In Oeios >It. so we have a late 
development of 6; cf. App. Pr. “ Theophilus non izofilus”: 
Claussen 833. 
(1) Evidence of a late school pronunciation of @ as ¢s is to be found in 
Thurot 78, 79 (cf. footnote to § 259): “ Z quoque, si aspiretur, ut c enun- 
tiatur, ut ether, nothus, Parthi, cathedra, catholicus, etheus, Matheus”... 
“In principio inquam dictionis nulla prescripta causa variari compellitur, 
ut thiara, Thiestes, Thestius, Thescelus, Theos.” 
334. By the first century a. p., ¢ had developed into / in 
some places (S. 261): DAFNE occurs in Pompeii, Claussen 828; 
7 is common later in southern Italy, S. 261. Certainly as early 
as the fourth century (Lindsay 58) / came to be the standard 
pronunciation: 4ff. Pr. “amfora non ampora,” “strofa non 
stropa”; Bechtel 79, neofiti; so ddyjxiov for oficium, etc., Eck- 
inger 97. In late words ¢ regularly appears as f: ¢aondos > 
phaselus faselus; xébados > It. cefalo; etc.
-P-A-G-E-158

(4) Liquips, NasaLs, AND SIBILANTS. 
335. The liquids regularly remained unchanged: Aapadés> 
lampas; jjrwp > rhetor. Rh in common speech was doubtless 
pronounced like 7. 
In céAwov > It. sedano, and a few other words, we probably 
have to do with a late Greek change of d to 8. 
336. The nasals, too, regularly remained unchanged: patpos 
> maurus; voyn> nome. There are, however, some indica- 
tions that they were weak before consonants: BéuBos > Pr. 
bobansa, etc. Cf. Claussen 845. 
337- Of the sibilants, o and é were regularly unchanged: 
oivam > sinapis; e€odos > exodus. In dopy?>It. orma, o has 
probably become 7 For zpeoBurepos > prediter, see § 300. 
The unfamiliar combination y lent itself readily to meta- 
thesis: ydAdew > psallere spallere. 
For Z see below. 
(5) 4 
338. Z doubtless had several pronunciations in Greek. In 
early Latin it was represented by ss or s- pala > massa, Cdvn 
> sona (Plautus). From Sulla’s time on it was written z in 
Latin: Claussen 841-843. The grammarians throw no light 
on the Latin pronunciation. Quintilian refers only to the 
Greek letter and the lack of a corresponding Latin one; Velius 
Longus discusses 2 at length, as a simple sound, but seems to 
be referring only to Greek speech: S. 308. Priscian (Keil II, 
36) says that ¢ is sounded sd, but was often replaced, among 
the ancients, by s, ss, or d—as in Saguntum, massa, Medentius. 
339. Judging from inscriptions, it was pronounced in Vul- 
gar Latin dy, later y (cf. § 272), and subsequent developments 
confirm this view: baptizare was equivalent to dapti(d)yare, 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  
3 341] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. {41 
zelosus to (d)yelosus. The ending —7(d@)yare became very 
common: see § 33. 
The spelling @ for z occurs repeatedly: baptidiare is found 
several times in Per. (go, 22, etc.; cf. Bechtel 79), and is com- 
mon in inscriptions (cf. daptidiatus, Carnoy 163); oridium for 
Oputa, Lat. Spr. 473. Conversely, z is often used for di: 
ZABVLLVS, Vok. I, 68; zabulus, zacones, Koffmane 38; Lazis = 
Ladiis, zabulus, zaconus, zebus, zeta = dieta, zosum = deorsum, 
R. 457-458. 
In late inscriptions z for 7 is common: zerax = tepagé (202 
A. D.), zanuari, Vok.1, 69; ZESV, ZVNIOR, S. 239; Zovdcia=/ulia, 
kolous = conjux, Eckinger 80. Cf. septuazinta, Carnoy 163. 
3. GERMANIC CONSONANTS. 
340. Most of the consonants offer no peculiarities, being 
treated as in Latin. A few, however, had no Latin equiva- 
lents: J, A,%,and w. Furthermore, 4 and & came in after the 
corresponding Latin sounds had undergone some modification. 
341. B between vowels, occurring apparently only in words 
adopted after Latin intervocalic 6 had become B (§ 318), re- 
mained a stop: voubén> It. rubare, *striban> Pr. estribar. 
G, although it can scarcely have come in time to share 
in the early palatalization of Latin g before front vowels 
($§ 258 ff.), seems to have followed a similar course, and to 
have participated also in the later Gallic palatalization of g 
before a (§ 263): gilda>It. geldra, *giga> Pr., It. giga, geisla 
> Pr. gisele; garba> Fr. gerbe, garto> Old Fr. fart, 
K resisted front vowels: skéza > Sp. esquena, skérnén > 
It. schernire; so *rik-itia > Pr. rigueza, etc. Lranko seems to 
have been an early acquisition, and its derivatives palatalized 
their 2 before e and 7. frank-iscus > It. Francesco, etc. In the
-P-A-G-E-160
142 An Intropuction To VuLcaR LatIN. [§ 344 
regions where Latin ¢ was palatalized, in the seventh century 
and later, before a (§ 263), Germanic & was modified in the 
same way before all front vowels (including @): cf. Old Fr. 
eschine, eschernir, richesse; so blank-a>F¥r. blanche (but It. 
bianca). 
342. The spirants J and / were replaced in Latin by the 
corresponding stops, ¢ and ¢: widarlon > It. guiderdone; hau- 
nipa>Fr. honte, pahso> It. tasso, parrjan> Fr. tarir, préscan 
> Pr. trescar. Cf. Kluge 500. 
343. Germanic /4 appeared when Latin % had long been 
silent in popular speech. 
At the beginning of a word it kept its sound in northern 
Gaul, but apparently was neglected in the rest of the Empire: 
hanca>F¥r. hanche, Sp. anca; hapja> Fr. hache, Pr. apcha; 
hardjan>¥r. hardir, \t. ardire; hélm>Old Fr. helme, It. 
elmo. Bon. 445 notes that aé, rather than a, is used before 
initial ch: ab Chilperico, etc. ‘ 
Intervocalic % disappeared in most words, but in a few— 
perhaps borrowed at a different date—it seems to have been 
sounded ££ in the greater part of the Empire: /éiu > Fr., Pr. 
feu, It. fio; skiuhan> Fr. esguiver, It. schivare; spéhén>Old 
Fr. espier, Pr. espiar; —jéhan > Old Fr. yehir, Pr. geguir, It. 
gecchire, Old Sp. jaguir. 
Hs, ht were generally treated like Latin ss, #: Aahso>It. 
tasso; —slahta > Old Fr. esclate, Pr. esclata, It. schiatta; sléht 
> Pr. esclet, It. schietto. But wahta, doubtless adopted at a 
different time, became Old Fr. gatte, Pr. gaita; cf. It. guatare. 
  344. Germanic w was a strong velar and labial fricative, 
at a time when original Latin w (spelled v7) had become 
the purely labial fricative B (§ 322). It was nearer in 
sound to Latin uw. see § 326. In the GZ. Reich. we find it
-P-A-G-E-161
§ 344] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 143 
represented by ww, in uuadius, reuuardent, etc. Bon. 167 re- 
cords Zuua, wa (the interjection), Waddo, walde, Wandali, 
etc. It is generally written w in Fredegarius, but Winirio is 
spelled Quintrio: Haag 38. 
In extreme northern and eastern Gaul, in northwestern 
Italy, and in Retia this w apparently remained unchanged 
in the Vulgar Latin period; elsewhere, through a reinforce- 
ment of its velar element, it became gw: warjan > *warire 
guarire, wérra > werra guerra, wisa>*wisa guisa. 
Through association with Germanic words, the 8 of some 
Latin words was changed to w: vadum + watan > *wadum, 
vastare + wost-> *wastare, etc; 
See E. Mackel, Die germanischen Elemente in der franzdsischen und 
provenzalischen Sprache, 1884; W. Waltemath, Die frinkischen Elemente 
in der franzisischen Sprache, 1885; W. Bruckner, Charakteristik der ger 
manischen Elemente im Ltalienischen, 1899.
-P-A-G-E-162
IV. MORPHOLOGY. 
A. NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES. 
1. GENDER. 
345. The three genders of Latin were not, in the main, 
dependent on sex or lack of sex. They were grammatical 
distinctions, whose observance was a matter of outward form. 
If words lost their differentiating terminations, confusion of 
gender ensued. 
a. MASCULINE AND FEMININE. 
346. Between masculine and feminine there was not much 
confusion, but there were some important shifts: — 
(1) Feminines of the second declension nearly all became 
masculine: /raxinus, etc.; cf. castaneus for castanea, Bon. 194. 
Feiminines of the fourth declension varied (Gram. II, 461): 
domus, ficus, manus. 
(2) In Gaul, abstract nouns in —o7, through the analogy of 
the great majority of abstract terms, became feminine (Bon. 
503-504): color, honor, Lat. Spr. 483; dolor, timor, Bon. 504. 
(3) Nouns that had a proparoxytonic accusative in —erem, 
—icem, —inem, —orem, or —urem were of uncertain gender (Gram. 
II, 464-467): carcérem, pulicem, marginem, leporem, turtiirem. 
(4) There were some sporadic changes: duos arbores, Pir- 
son 157; cucullus and cuculla, G. 293; fons feminine in late 
Latin, Zaz. Spr. 483; grex became feminine.

, b. MASCULINE AND NEUTER. 
347. In Classic Latin a number of neuters became mascu- 
line: balteum —us, caseum —us, cornu —um —us, frenum it, nasum 
us, tergum —us, vadum —us; cf. collus —um, lectus —um. 
In popular and late Latin this tendency was strong: ante- 
Classic, m. papaver; Plautus, m. guttur, dorsus (Mil. Glor. I, 4, 
44), Zactem (Bacch.V, 2,16); Varro, m. murmur; Petronius, ba/- 
neus, celus, fatus, lactem, vasus —um, vinus, etc., Waters Ch. 39, 
41, 42, 57, Densusianu 129, 132; codlus, me[ nt lus, etc., Audol- 
lent 545; MARIS, MAREM, Densusianu 132; cas/ellus, fenus, 
lignus, signus, templus, verbus, vinus, etc., R. 266; sulphurem, 
G. 293; /rigorem, maris nom. sg., marmorem, pectorem, roborem, 
Bon. 348; incipit judicius, etc., D’Arbois 135. Beside Zémen, no- 
men, piper there must have been */aminem, *nominem, *pipérem. 
Conversely we find cinus, n., for cinis, ciner, m.; there must 
have been a *fi/vus, n., beside pi/vis, m. and f. (Lat. Spr. 
483); Petronius has “resaurum, Waters Ch. 46. Cf. gladium, 
laqueum, puteum, thesaurum, etc., R. 270-272. 
Cf. Bon. 345-349, 507-509. For the confusion of masculine 
and neuter in Africa, see Avchiv VIII, 173. 
348. The transition from masculine to neuter was facilitated 
by the fall of final » (§ 309), and also by the fall of final s in 
the regions where that phenomenon occurred (§ 298). These 
changes reduced considerably the distinguishing marks of the 
two genders: — 
Sfiliu(s) Soliu come(s) corpu(s) 
flit folié comiti(s) corpori(s) 
jilio “folio comiti corpori 
filiu Soliu comite corpu(s) 
“jilio ‘folio comite corpore 
Sulit Solia comite(s) corpora 
Sfilioru Solioru comitu corporu 
“filii(s) “folii(s) comitibu(s) corporibu(s) 
Silio(s) Soliw comite(s) corpora 
“filit(s) folii(s) comitibu(s) corporibu(s)
-P-A-G-E-164
146 An InTRODUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. [8 351 
In the second declension the only difference is in the nomina- 
tive singular and the nominative and accusative plural; and 
in Italy and Dacia the distinction disappears even in the 
nominative singular. In the third declension the genders are 
distinguished only in the accusative singular and the nomina- 
tive and accusative plural. 
349. Thus the masculine and neuter inflections came to be 
fused, the characteristic neuter plural —a being regarded as an 
alternative masculine plural ending: Petronius writes nervia 
for nervi, Waters Ch. 45; cf. rivus rivora, Zs. XXX, 635. So 
locus, mirus, for instance, give in Italian: sg. Zuogo, muro; pl. 
luoghi luogora, muri mura. CE. § 351. 
Nearly all neuters became masculine: os Jocutus est, R. 266; 
donum celestem, etc., R. 277; hunc seculum, hunc stagnum, hunc 
verbum, hunc vulnere, Bon. 386, 348. dare, however, perhaps 
influenced by zerra, generally became feminine: mavis, m. and 
f., Densusianu 132; mare, f.. Haag 48. Greek neuters in —ma, 
if popular, generally became feminine: cyma, sagma. 
The loss of the neuter gender for nouns was probably not 
complete until early Romance times. Cf. Archiv III, 161. 
350. Among pronouns, the neuter forms were kept to express 
an indefinite idea: Adc, id ipsum, tllud or illum, quid, quod. 
Neuter adjective forms were used for a similar purpose: in 
the early stages of the Romance languages we find phrases 
pointing to such Vulgar Latin constructions as *mzhi est grave 
guod ille non veniat, etc. 
c. FEMININE AND NEUTER. 
351. Classic Latin often used not only the singular for the 
plural in a collective sense (as egues, miles, etc., in Livy: cf. 
Draeger I, 4), but also the collective plural for the singular
-P-A-G-E-165
  
§ 354] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. 147 
(as frigora, marmora, rura: cf. Draeger I, 5-9; Archiv XIV, 
63). So the neuter plural forms in —a were preserved in their 
collective use after the neuter singular forms had disappeared. 
This formation in -a was extended to many masculine 
(cf. § 349) and even to some feminine nouns: digita, fructa, 
Susa, grada occur in late Latin, Lat. Spr. 482. Cf. Old Fr. 
crigne <<? *crinea = crines; It. dita, frutta, etc.; Sardinian, 
Apulian, Rumanian /runza <? *frondia = frondes. 
352. In late Latin and early Romance this collective plural 
in —a came to be taken for a feminine singular: ¢ribu/a sg., 
R. 269; gaudia sg. Bon. 351; ligna...ardet (cf. rama), Gl. 
Reich.; hic est testa, D’Arbois 10; cf. ne forte et mihi hec eve- 
niat, etc., R. 435. The feminine character of such words was 
doubtless reinforced by the use, for instance, of an *//@ pectora 
to match gue pectora: Chronologie 199. Conversely, palpebrum 
for palpebra occurs, R. 270. 
Hence arose such feminine singular forms as *brachia, *folia, 
gaudia, gesta, ligna, etc., for which a new plural was created: 
brachias, Audollent 548; armentas, membras, Gl. Cassel; inge- 
nias, simulachras, Gl. Reich. 
In most of the Romance territory the —a forms were kept 
only as feminine singulars, but many were preserved as plurals 
in central and southern Italy and Rumania. 
353. Aside from these, few neuter nouns became feminine: 
marmor, f., occurs in late Latin, Zat Spr. 483. For mare and 
Greek neuters in —ma, see § 349. For cinus = cinis, *pulvus = 
pulvis, see § 347. 
2. DECLENSION OF NOUNS. 
354. For the use of cases, see §§ 85-100. By the end of 
the Vulgar Latin period the cases were generally reduced,  
-P-A-G-E-166
148 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 356 
except in Dacia, to two,—a nominative and an accusative- 
ablative,—the plural following the analogy of the singular. 
In Dacia the dative singular was to some extent preserved 
also: §g1. Cf. K. Sittl in Archiv II, 550. 
355. The number of declensions was reduced to three, the 
fourth and fifth being absorbed by the others. 
(1) The transfer from the fourth to the second began in 
Classic Latin and continued in vulgar and late speech: démus, 
ficus, so fricti, senati; gustus in Petronius; manos, Audollent 
544; jusso, passos, Bechtel 86; cornum, fructo fructos, gelus, 
genum, gradus, senatus, spiritus, etc., R. 260-262, 270; lacus, 
mercatus, G. 282-283; jusso, lucto, etc., Bon. 135. All the 
fourth declension eventually went over. One result of the 
intermediate confusion was an accusative plural spelling —ws 
for —os, which was very common in Gaul: Bon. 337-338. 
(2) The transfer of nouns in —/es from the fifth to the first 
declension began also in Classic Latin: effigies da, uxuries —ia, 
materies —ia. Acia, facia, glacia, scabia are attested later: Den- 
susianu 133, Zaz, Spr. 482. All passed over in the greater 
part of the Empire; but —zes was kept in the Spanish penin- 
sula, in southern Italy and Sardinia, and occasionally in 
southern Gaul, being assimilated to the third declension: cf. 
Sp. Zaz, Pr. glatz, etc. Dies maintained itself, as a third 
declension noun, beside da. 
Fifth declension nouns not in —ées went into the third: ves 
rem, spes spem, etc. There was also an inflection sfes 
spene(m), whence Italian spene (cf. spENI): W. Hereus in 
Archiv XIII, 152. 
356. The other declensions generally held their own, but 
there were a few shifts: — 
(2) For an inflection mama mamdane(m), etc., see § 359.
-P-A-G-E-167
§ 357] Aw InrRopuction To VuLcaR LaTIN. 149 
(2) For an inflection Be//us Bellone(m), etc., see § 362. 
Beside ervum ervi, there was an ervus ervoris: Lat. Spr. 483. 
Fimus fimi, under the influence of stévcus, apparently became 
Sémus (Gl. Reich.) *fémoris: cf. Old Fr. jiens, Pr. femps. 
Findus findi perhaps became findus * fiindoris: Old Fr. 
Sonz, Pr. fons, Fr. effondrer. Beside terminus -i, there was a 
termen terminis. 
(3) On the other hand, 65> dssum (R. 259-260), vas > va- 
sum vasus (Waters Ch. 57); so apparently ros>*vosum (cf. Fr. 
arroser, It. rugiada, etc.); beside coclear there was coclearium. 
Caput became capus (Pirson 238) and *capum -7: cf. Litblt. 
XXVII, 367. Corpo for corpore occurs in the Per.: Bechtel 86. 
Greek nouns of the third declension sometimes passed into 
the first: adsis > absida, G. 280; lampas > lampada, R. 258- 
259, G. 280, Dubois 258; pyxis >*buxida; siren > sirena, 
G. 280. So a few Latin nouns: juventus or —tas > juventa, 
likewise tempesta (Gl. Reich.) and probably *fores‘a; but the 
old forms were retained also. Puulva for piilvis is recorded 
by Audollent 416. 
a. FIRST DECLENSION. 
357. In countries which did not lose final s (§ 298), the 
accusative plural form came to be used as a nominative plural. 
This use was due in the main to the analogy of the singular, 
where there was only one form, and of feminine nouns of the 
third declension, which had only one form in the plural: jiZia 
Jjilia(m), matres matres, hence filias filias. So linguas, Audol- 
lent 546. It probably was not common until late Vulgar Latin 
or early Romance times. 
In Italy and Dacia, where the fall of —s made the accusative 
plural identical with the singular, the nominative plural was 
kept instead.  
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 An IntRopucTION To VuLGaR LatIN. [s 359 
(1) According to Mohl, Chronologie 205-209, the nominative plural in 
~as was probably old in some parts of Italy: SCALAS, nom., 57 B.C.; LIBERTI 
LIBERTASQVE, Dalmatia; HIC QVESCVNT DVS MRES DVAS FILIAs, Africa. 
M, Bréal, Journal des savants 1900, Feb., p. 70, affirms that there was a 
feminine in -a with a plural in -as in Oscan, and also in Latin down to 
the second century B. c.; Celtic, too, had a similar plural. D’Arbois 21-24 
assumes Celtic influence: Ac sunt cartas, etc. No foreign influences are 
needed to explain the practice, but they may have helped its diffusion. 
358. An ablative in -adus is occasionally found: Casstabus, 
Seminabus, filiabus, pupillabus, Archiv VII, 171; deabus, fili- 
abus, etc., Pirson 115-116; animabus, famulabus, filiabus, vil- 
Zabus, Bon. 331. This form left no traces in Romance. 
359. Feminine proper names and words denoting persons 
often developed, rather late, an inflection in —dmis, etc., or 
—énis, etc., probably under the influence of the consonantal 
declension of Greek names that was in vogue in schools. 
Pupils were taught to inflect Glaucé Glaucénis, Nicé Nicénis, 
etc. (R. 264); cf. Dante’s Semelé, etc.: hence arose Anna 
Annénis or —énis, mamma mamminis, amita *amiténis (so 
Juliana Julianenis in Pirson 143), cf. W. Hereus in Zs. fr. 
Spr. XXV, ii, 136. Some masculine person-names in —@ had 
the same declension (Zinf. 150, § 153): barba barbani, sa- 
crista *sacristanis (cf. It. sacristano), scriba *scribanis (cf. It. 
scrivano). Both mamani and tatani are found in the third 
century: W. Hereus in Archiv XIII, 152-153. See G. Paris, 
Les accusatifs en -ain, Rom, XXIII, 321; E. Philipon, Les 
accusatifs en —on et en —ain, Rom. XXXI, 201; W. Meyer- 
Liibke in Z7b/t, XXV, 206; G. Salvioni in Rom. XXXV, 198. 
In Lat. Spr. 483, Meyer-Liibke expresses doubt whether the 
feminine —a —anis is connected with masculine /atant, etc. 
This feminine inflection left some traces in Gaul, Retia, and 
Italy: Fr. nonnain, putain, etc.; Lombard madrane, etc., Rom, 
XXXV, 207.
-P-A-G-E-169
§ 362] An InrropucTION TO VULGAR LATIN. I5r 
(1) G. Salvioni, La declinazione imparisillaba in —a —4ne, -0 —6ne, —e éne 
-ine, -i ine -éne, Rom. XXXV, 198, shows that these forms of declen- 
sion were very common in the medieval Latin documents of all parts 
of Italy, from 750 on: amitane, 218; Andreani, 216; barbane, 214-215; 
domnani, 219; Joanneni, 250; etc. Attane, barbane still exist at both ends 
of Italy. According to Salvioni, the starting-point of all this inflection 
was bdrba barbdnis, from which it was extended to other nouns of relation- 
ship and to proper names; édrba barddnis itself he would ascribe to the 
influence of the synonymous *édr60*barbénis. A Germanic origin is postulated 
by J. Jud, Recherches sur la génése et la diffusion des accusatifs en —ain ef en -on, 
1907; also in Archiv fur das Studium der neueren Sprachen XXIV, 3-4, 405. 
(2) A. Zimmermann, Zs. XXVIII, 343, shows that there was also an 
inflection in —déis, -éts, and -dtis: Aureliati, Agneti, etc. Cf. Eugeneti 
from Lugenes, R. 264, Dubois 250; Andreate, Rom. XXXV, 216; also 
Joannentis, Rom. XXXV, 250. 
360. In general, at the beginning of the Romance period, 
the first declension was reduced to this pattern: — 
luna Sacia *folia 
luna facia “folia 
lune lunas facie facias folie folias 
luna(s) Sacia(s) Solia(s) 
In Dacia the dative singular (Zume, etc.) was kept also. 
b. SECOND DECLENSION. 
361. As neuter nouns became masculine, they assumed, 
partly in Vulgar Latin but mostly in Romance, the masculine 
inflection in those countries where the masculine and neuter 
differed: vinus, etc. Cf. §§ 347-349. 
The plural in —a, however, was retained to a considerable 
extent, especially in southern and central Italy and Dacia. 
Some masculines took this —a, by the analogy of dracchia, etc.: 
*botella, *botula, digita, fructa, rama, etc. Cf. §§ 349, 351-352. 
362. From the seventh century on,—perhaps under Ger- 
manic influence combined with the analogy of the Latin type  
-P-A-G-E-170
152 An Inrropuction To VutcaR LatIN. [§ 365 
gélo gulénis, etc.,—there developed in Gaul, Reetia, Italy, and 
possibly Spain, a declension —ws (or —o) —dénis for masculine 
proper names: Hugo Higon was Latinized into Hugo Hugé- 
ne(m) (cf. § 152); avus avi>avo avonis, attested in Lucca in 
776 (Rom. XXXV, 204); hence Pétrus or Pétro Petréne(m), 
Paulus or Paulo Pauléne(m), etc. Cf. Pirson 133: Bellus 
Belloni, Firmus Firmonis. See E. Philipon in Rom. XXXI, 
201; G. Salvioni in Rom. XXXV, 198. 
Traces of this inflection are to be seen especially in French 
and Provengal proper names: /oucon, Huon, etc. So perhaps 
Italian Donatoni, Giovannoni, etc., and possibly Corsican da- 
boni, suceroni: Rom. XXXV, 212-213. 
363. In general, at the beginning of the Romance period, 
the second declension followed this pattern: — 
annu(s) SaBe(r) vinu(s) bracciu *-us Sructu(s) 
annu —o Sabru—o vinu —o bracciu —o Sructu .-0 
anni fabri vini braccia i fructi -a 
anno(s) Sabro(s) vino(s) braccja -0(s) Sructo(s) -a 
The letters enclosed in parentheses were silent in Italy and 
Dacia. In Gaul the accusative plural ending was often 
spelled —ws: Bon. 337-338; cf. § 355, (1). 
c. THIRD DECLENSION. 
364. In the ablative there was considerable confusion of -i 
and -é in Classic Latin: mari maré, turri turré, etc. This was 
carried further in common speech: cf. Vo&. II, 85, 87. The 
ablative in —é finally triumphed, but there are some traces 
of -z: It. part, etc. 
365. In the accusative plural there was still greater con- 
fusion of —zs and —és (nubés nudis, etc.), both in Classic and 
in Vulgar Latin: cf. Voz. I, 247-249. Apparently —és crowded 
out the rarer —7s, which left no sure traces.
-P-A-G-E-171
§ 367] Aw Inrropuction To VuLcaR LatIN. 153 
Italian pani, etc., Rumanian Pini, etc., are best explained, 
as by Tiktin 565-566, through the analogy of the second 
declension: see §368. Cf. fol/i for folles in Gl. Reich. 
366. In the nominative singular the common ~és largely dis- 
placed the less frequent —és- Vok. I, 244-247, III, 116; Caper, 
“fames non famis,” Keil VII, 105; App. Pr., “nubes non nu- 
bis”; adis, famis, nubis, etc., R. 263; famis, etc., Sepulcri 220. 
As —és and —is came to be pronounced alike before the end 
of the Vulgar Latin period (cf. §§ 174, 243), it is futile to 
trace the Romance forms phonetically to one source rather 
than the other. 
367. Nouns which added a syllable in the genitive, without 
a change of accent, tended in popular speech to use for the 
nominative a form in —/s, -es, or —e fashioned on the model of 
the oblique cases: so s@ps > sa@pes, stips > stipes; Jovis, nom., 
in Ennius, Varro, Petronius (Waters Ch. 47); Zacfe in Ennius, 
Plautus, Petronius (Waters Ch. 38), Apuleius, Aulus Gellius; 
bovis in Varro, Petronius (Waters Ch. 62); carnis in Livy; 
stirpis in Livy, Prudentius; szzsin Prudentius (F. D’Ovidio in 
Raccolta di studii critici dedicata ad Alessandro D’ Ancona 627); 
Zentis in Priscian; calc’s in Venantius Fortunatus; dvite, etc., 
Audollent 545-547; “grus non gruis,” App. Pr.; principens 
(= principis), R. 263; antestetis, superstitis, Vok. III, 9; urbis, 
Haag 45; pedis, travis (three times), GZ. Reich.; cf. Chronolo- 
gie 203, Lat. Spr. 481. These forms prevailed in Romance, 
perhaps in late popular Latin. 
In Vulgar Latin this formation was extended to words with 
a shift of accent: excellente for excellens in Petronius, Waters 
Ch. .45,.66; audace, castore, latrone, victore, voluntate, etc., 
Audollent 545-547; heredes, R. 263; cardonis, papilionis (cf. 
aculionis for aculeus), Gl. Reich.; heredes, etc., D’Arbois 85-88. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
154 An InrRopUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. [§ 269 
These forms, too, prevailed in Romance, except for names of 
persons, which, being used mainly in the nominative and 
vocative, retained and generally preferred the old nominative 
form: hdmo, sdror, etc.; cantator, servitor, etc. But names of 
persons in —avs and ~ens usually made over the nominative: 
parentis, etc. (also presentis, etc.), D’Arbois 85-88; so, no 
doubt, *amantis, etc. (also *clamantis, etc.), but infans (also 
pragnans). 
368. In most of the Romance languages (but not Spanish), 
masculine nouns made over their nominative plural on the 
model of the second declension, which was regarded as the 
normal masculine type: /#i/, hence *fatri; liipi, hence *cani; 
anni, hence *mé(n)si. 
The process may have begun in the Vulgar Latin period, 
but there is virtually no evidence that it started so early: in 
late Latin, however, ¢//fanti is common, according to Bon. 367; 
parentorum is frequent in charters; in the GZ. Casse/, made in 
Italy in the eighth or ninth century, we find sapiendi. 
369. Neuters in —v and ~s regularly kept their nominative- 
accusative singular, as mdme(n), corpus corpu(s); for *lumi- 
ne(m), *nomine(m), beside the old forms, see § 347. For the 
nominative-accusative plural, however, they constructed, prob- 
ably in late Vulgar Latin or early Romance, new forms on the 
masculine pattern, as *xdmes *ndme(s), *corpes *corpe(s); but 
in Italy and Rumania the old ones, especially those in —dra, 
were kept also (Las. Spr. 482). In these countries —ora was 
used as a plural ending (It. cgrpo, corpi corpora; Rum. timp, 
timpuri), and was extended in Old Italian to the second, in 
Rumanian to both the second and first declensions: cf. 
Tiktin 566. 
Neuters in ~7, which apparently became masculine or
-P-A-G-E-173
  
§ 3:1] Aw Inrropuction To VuLcar LatIN. 155 
feminine earlier than the others, often developed an accusative 
singular in -e(m) as well as a nominative-accusative plural in 
-es: marmorem, Bon. 348, Zauner 30; papaverem, Plautus, Pen. 
I, 2, 113; *puperem; sulphurem, G. 293; cf. § 347. But mar- 
mor, etc., were kept also. Cdr apparently made its plural 
* cores instead of *cdrdes: according to Mohl, Lexigue 21-38, 
the word shows no trace of d in any of the Romance lan- 
guages, except Spanish cuerdv, and so probably goes back to 
an Old Latin *cor *coris = xijp xfjpos; the open o would possi- 
bly be explained as due to a cross between this *cdr and the 
Classic cdr. 
Caput became *capu(m) or capus (Pirson 238), and passed 
into the second declension: cf. § 356, (3). 
370. A few feminines in —7s apparently became neuters in 
—us, but the original forms were kept also: cinis cinus; pitlvis 
*piiluus, whence Sp. polvo, Old Fr. pols (It. polve may come 
from pilver). 
Lncus, incidis > incido, incudinis: Lat. Spr. 483. 
Sanguis, sanguine(m) also sangue(m). 
371. In general, at the beginning of the Romance period, 
the third declension must have gone about as follows (—és and 
-és having coincided in the pronunciation —es) :— 
(1) No CHancE or ACCENT.

Letters enclosed in parentheses were silent in Italy and Dacia. 
d. LOSS OF DECLENSION. 
372. In Italy and Dacia, through the dropping of final + 
and s, declension nearly disappeared before the end of the 
Vulgar Latin period: cf. Audollent 545-547, nom. a/umnu, 
Glaucu, Romanu, etc. It was probably lost altogether soon 
after, although a few double forms still remain: e. g., It. Zadro, 
ladrone. 
It disappeared early in Spain also. In most of Gaul it 
lasted through the twelfth century and later. 
373. In Gaul and Spain the forms preserved were the ac- 
cusative singular and the accusative plural. In Italy and 
Rumania, for phonetic reasons, the surviving cases are the 
accusative singular and the nominative plural. 
There are, however, not a few examples of the nominative 
singular of names of persons.

3. DECLENSION OF ADJECTIVES. 
374. Adjectives were declined after the same model as 
nouns. As neuter nouns assumed masculine endings (§ 347), 
the neuter adjective forms were less and less used; the neuter 
singular, however, was kept to represent a whole idea (cf. 
§ 350), and the neuter plural (as omnia) was doubtless em 
ployed from time to time as an indefinite collective. 
375. The principal types are: — 
(1) THREE GENDERS. 
-us -—a -um 
bonu(s) bona bonu 
bonu —0 bona bonu —0 
boni bone -as bona 
bono(s) bona(s) bona 
So superlatives, as optimus, -a, —um. 
-er -a -um 
LiBe(r) libra libru 
libru -o libra libru -o 
libri libre libras libra 
Libro(s) libra(s) libra 
So @eger, egra, egrum. 
~er -is -e 
ace(r) acre(s) acre 
acre acre acre 
acre(s) acre(s) acria 
acre(s) acre(s) acria 
(2) Two GENDERs. 
triste(s) triste 
triste triste 
triste(s) tristia 
triste(s) tristia
-P-A-G-E-176
  158 An InrRopucTION To VULGAR LATIN. [8 377 
(3) Originally ONE GENDER in the Nominative Singular. 
*felice(s) fullis *prudente(s) prudes) 
Selice Jélis prudente prude(s) 
Selice(s) felicia prudente(s) prudentia 
felice(s) felicia prudente(s) prudentia 
(4) Comparatives apparently did not reconstruct the 
Nominative Singular: — 
mélio(r) méliu(s) 
melibre méliu(s) 
melidbre(s) melibra 
melibre(s) melibra 
376. There was a good deal of confusion of types in Latin 
times: beside a/acer, m. and f., there was a/acris, m. and f., 
and there was probably also a feminine *a/acra and *alecra. 
Pauper early developed a feminine paupera and later a neuter 
pauperum: paupera, pauperum, pauperorum, R. 275 (cf. pau- 
perorum, Waters Ch. 46). Macer, miser, sacer passed into the 
—us —a —um class, Densusianu 142; so teter > tetrus, App. Pr. 
Deelivis, effrenis, imbecillis also assumed the —ws —a —um inflec- 
tion in the Latin period; so ¢ristis>¢ristus, App. Pr. CE. celerus, 
gracilus, prestus, sublimus, etc., and conversely benignis, in- 
Jjirmis, etc., R. 274. Praecox developed a feminine precoca: 
Neue II, 162. 
In the Romance languages more adjectives went over to 
the —us —a —um type: Pr. comuna, doussa, etc. 
4. COMPARISON. 
377. For the new method of comparison, see §56. The 
Romance type, not completely evolved in Vulgar Latin, 
was:— 
carus pies . pcarus alle te Mas } carus magis magis
-P-A-G-E-177
§ 379] An IntTRopucTION TO VuLGAR LATIN. 159 
However, the Classic Latin comparatives of many common 
adjectives remained: altior, grandior, gravior, grevior, grossior 
(G. 285), Zevior, longior, major, melior, minor, pejor ; also *bei 
latior. So the adverbs: Jongius, magis, melius, minus, pejus, 
sordidius, vivacius, etc. The old superlatives remained to a 
considerable. extent, in the clerical language, as intensives: 
altissimus, carissimus, pessimus, proximus, sanctissimus. 
5. NUMERALS.! 
378. Unus was probably declined like donus. It was used 
also as an indefinite article (§57) and an indefinite pronoun 
(ct-$i72). ‘ 
Diio came to be replaced by diz, attested in the third cen- 
tury: Archiv IX, 558 (cf. II, 107). Its inflection at the end 
of the Vulgar Latin period was probably: — 
dui doi (duo?) due doe duas doas dua doa 
duo(s) dua(s) doa(s) dua doa 
In early Romance there was doubtless much confusion of the 
forms. 
379. The numbers between two and twenty were as fol- 
lows: — 
Trés probably developed ‘a nominative *¢ve7, on the model of dus. 
Quattuor became guattor (Archiv VII, 65), also guatro (Carnoy 221) 
* quattro. 
Quingue, by dissimilation, became céngue (Archiv VII, 66); so cing 
ginta (Archiv VII, 70). Cf. § 254. 
Séx, sépte (and * sétte), dcto ( and *dtto), ndve, déce offer no peculiarities 
Cf. Archiv VIL, 68. 
Beside zndéce there seems to have been * zindéce. 
For dodéce, see § 225. 
Trédéce is regular.   
1See M. Ihm, Vulgdrformen lateinischer Zahlwirter auf Inschriften in Archia 
VI, 65. 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 Aw InTROpUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 381 
Quattuordécim regularly became *guattordéce (cf. § 225), but also 
* quattdrdéce. 
Quindéce is regular. 
Beside sédéce there was *déce et (or ac) séx. 
Septendécim, etc., went out of use; also unus de viginti, etc.: G. 400. 
priscian (Keil III, 412) mentions decem et septem. Beside this déce et sépte 
there was *déce ac sépte; so *déce et (or ac) dcto, *déce et (or ac) nove, 
380. The tens, beginning with 20, are irregular: cf. § 142. 
Viginti, triginta regularly became viinti, triinta (§ 259): 
Beevte occurs in a sixth century document of Ravenna, Vod. 
II, 461; “rienta, Archiv VII, 69. These forms easily con- 
tracted into vint, trinta (vinti, trinta: Archiv VII, 69), which 
account in general for the Italian, Provengal, and French 
words; Rumanian has new formations. But beside these we 
must assume for Spanish something like * vfinti, */rfinta, with 
an opening of the first 7 and an early shift of accent, probably 
anterior to the fall of the g; “#iginta is, in fact, mentioned asa 
faulty pronunciation by Consentius, Keil V, 392. Cf. G. Ryd- 
berg in Mélanges Wahlund 337. 
This change of accent apparently occurred everywhere for 
the subsequent tens: *guadrdinta, *cingudinta, * sexdinta, 
* septdinta * settdinta, * octdinta * ottdinta, * nondinta * novdinta; 
the sepfwa— and the octo— of 70 and 80 were made to conform 
to the type of the others. Outside of the Spanish peninsula 
—dinta apparently became -du/a. Furthermore the dr of 
*guadrdinta became rr: guarranta is found in an inscription, 
perhaps of the fifth century (Pirson 97; Zs. fr. Spr. XXV, ii, 
136; Archiv VII, 69). 
381. Céntu was regular. For ducénti, trecénti, etc., there 
were probably new formations, such as * did céntu, etc. 
Mille was regular. For its plural it had * diz mille or * ditt 
mil(/)ia, etc.
-P-A-G-E-179
  § 385] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 167 
382. The ordinal numerals, after 5th, were probably not 
very commonly used: the Romance languages show many 
new formations; in northern Italian, Provengal, and Catalan 
the distributive ending —enws was employed (sepéenus for 
séptimus, etc.). . 
Primus, seciindus, tértius, quartus, guintus were generally 
kept, inflected like dduus; but some languages have new 
formations even for these. 
The ordinals were best preserved in Italy. 
B. PRONOUNS AND PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES. 
383. The nominative and accusative remained; and the 
dative was preserved in personal, demonstrative, relative, and 
interrogative pronouns. The ablative gave way to the dative 
and accusative. The genitive was usually lost; but c#/us was 
kept, and so was the genitive singular and plural of #/e, ipse, 
and isée, 
1. PERSONAL PRONOUNS. 
N. B.— For the wse of personal pronouns, see § 60. 
384. As the pronouns came to be expressed more and more, 
ile and also hic, ifse, and zs were used to supply the lacking 
pronoun of the third person: cf. §§ 60, 67. Examples occur 
as early as the second century: /ranz. a II, 262. dc served 
as an indefinite neuter. “de assumed the function of an in- 
definite genitive: nemo inde dubitat, Regnier 110. 
385. go lost its g in all the territory, but probably not 
until the end of the Vulgar Latin period. According to 
Meyer-Liibke, Zaz, Spr. 484, co occurs in manuscripts of the 
sixth century.’ See § 263.   
1 But his reference to Vok. I, 242 is incorrect.
-P-A-G-E-180
    
162 An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [§ 388 
In the last syllable of 167, s#z the short 7 prevailed, and 
was carried into ddis, vobis. On the pattern of mi< mihi, 
there were formed #, sz beside #07, sidz; these are found, ac- 
cording to Lat. Spr. 484, from the sixth century on; cf. 
"rans. a II, 243-244. 
386. The inflection was probably reduced to: — 
¢o nos tu vos 
mi noie(s) Hi tee ~—=voBe(s) sf see fee me nos te vos se se 
2. POSSESSIVES. 
387. Méus, titus, situs were declined like dénus; ndster, vds- 
ter, like liber. But mi was used, beside méus, méa, as a mas- 
culine and feminine vocative (G. 281-282); mi domina is 
common, G. 282, Dubois 261-262. For the plural of the third 
person, 7//6ru came, in the Romance languages except Spanish, 
to replace sius, etc. 
By the analogy of méus, there was a seus: C. 7 Z. XII, 
5692, 9; cf. ste, IX, 3472. 
Sous is found in Gaul, Zs. fr. Spr. XXV, ii, 135: perhaps it 
is only a phonetic spelling of sows <suus, but it may represent 
a pronunciation sgws with an 0 opened by dissimilation (cf. 
§167). There doubtless was a *¢ous also. 
Vester disappeared. Vulgar Latin vdster may be a survival 
of the Old Latin vdster, or a reconstruction on the model of 
noster: cf. §199, (1). 
388. In archaic and popular Latin there was a short sus sa 
sum, probably used originally in the unaccented position: sas, 
sis occur in Ennius, sam in Festus; so is found in C. ZZ. V, 
2007. There must have been similar short forms for the first 
and second persons singular: mis, indeed, is used by Ennius.
-P-A-G-E-181
§ 390] Aw Inrropuction To VuLcaR Latin. 163 
The full inflection is found in the sixth century: Franz. a 
II, 244. 
These forms survived in Romance: Old It. fratelmo, madre- 
ma, etc. 
3. DEMONSTRATIVES. 
N. B.— For the use of demonstratives, see §§61-68. For their function as definite 
articles and personal pronouns, see §§ 60, 67-68, also §392. 
389. When #//e and is¢e had a really demonstrative force, 
they came to be compounded usually with the prefix ecc’ or 
eccu’: see §65. Cf. Franz. a II, 283-304. 
390. The inflection of #//e developed considerably in popu- 
lar speech. fse and is¢e followed a similar course; we find, 
however, the special forms “sus for ipse and ipsud for ipsum, 
R. 276; Franz. a II, 274. 
ile, nom. sg. m., was partially replaced, probably in the sec- 
ond half of the sixth century, by #//, framed on the model of 
gui: Bon. 114, ili =ille, ipsi = ipse; cf. Franz. a Il, 246-260. 
Through the analogy of cu/us, cii, the m. //ius gave way to 
illijus, and the dat. sg. m. #//@ was replaced in part by é//ai. 
The former, however, subsequently went out of use, and the 
latter is not found in Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia, and the Spanish 
peninsula. J//ius (ipsius, istius), having become archaic in 
popular speech, sometimes occurred as a dative: Franz. a II, 
277-279. There was another dative form, 7//o, used by Apu- 
leius and others (Neue II, 427; R. 275; Quillacq 83); but it 
disappeared from late Latin, being confused with the ablative 
and the accusative. The Old Latin genitive 77/1 (isi, isti), 
was abandoned: cf. Franz. a II, 273, 275. 
In the dat. sg. f., beside 27/7, there was i//@ (or i//e), used by 
Cato and others (Neue II, 427; R. 275; Audollent 302); and 
from that, on the model of é//a (and perhaps of gue7), was  
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 An InTRoDUCTION TO VuuLGAR LATIN. [8 302 
made i//ei (il/e’), which was used beside 7//i and i//e. In the 
genitive, on the same pattern (influenced perhaps by gwe/us), 
was constructed ://@jus (illejus), which crowded out é//ius. 
Lllujus, itlui, illejus, ildei are found from the sixth century 
on: Zs. XXVI, 600, 619. Cf. Lat Spr. 484: tlujus, illui, 
wlejus, ille, tlle; ipsujus, ipseus. 
| Illorum displaced the f. 2//arum. It came, furthermore, to 
be used, in Romance, for the dat. m. and f. #//is, which, 
however, did not entirely disappear. In parts of northern 
Spain and southwestern France 7//orum seems to have become 
*illurum, through the analogy of ¢//ijus, illu. 
The neuter 2//ud was replaced by i//um: Neue II, 426; R. 276. 
391. The popular inflection, at the end of the Vulgar Latin 
period, was something like this (brackets indicating forms net 
kept in Romance) : — 
elle elli ella ellu 
[ellujus} ellejus 
elli (ello) ellui elli elle ellet elit 
ellu ello ella ellu ello 
elli elle ella 
elloru elluru? [edlaru] elloru ellyru? 
elli(s) elloru elli(s) 
ello(s) : ella(s) ella 
392. When unaccented, these words tended to lose their 
first syllable (see §157): /# i//am vides >* tu’la’ vede(s); vides 
ti ipsam clavem>*vede(s) tu ’sa’ clave’? Lui and lei are 
found after the seventh century: Franz. a II, 281-283. 
lle and ipse were used freely as definite articles from the 
fourth century on: Densusianu 177. ///e prevailed, except 
in Sardinia, Majorca, a part of Catalonia and Gascony, and 
some dialects on the south shore of France. Cf. Franz. a II, 
271-272.

§ 305] An IntRopucTion To VuLGAR LaTIN. 165 
4. INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS. 
N.B.—For the wse of these pronouns, and the substitution of gui for feminine gue 
see §§ 69-70. 
393. In Christian inscriptions from the fifth century on, 
qui takes the place of guis, and also of the feminine gue. Be- 
side cujus, ciii is found a corresponding feminine gue/us, guei: 
see Mohl in Zs. XXVI, 619. 
The combined inflection of guz and guis, by the end of the 
Vulgar Latin period, was probably reduced, in common speech, 
to something like this: — 
qui que qua cod qued 
cuju(s) gueju(s) cujzs) cuju(s) 
cus quet cue cue 
que qua que cod qued 
co? qua co? co? 
ga que qu que 
cos? quas? cos? que 
The genitive was probably not used everywhere; perhaps it 
was kept only in Spain. Unde and @’tinde, ‘whence,’ took the 
meaning ‘of which’: Bon. 580. 
304. Qualis, inflected like ¢ris/is, was used as an interroga- 
tive pronoun and adjective. In the Romance languages 
(2) le + qualis came to be employed as a relative pronoun. 
5. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES. 
395. For these, see $71. Alter, nitllus, sdlus, totus, inus 
doubtless developed an inflection like bonus: gen. nulli, etc., 
R. 276; dat. solo, toto, uno, etc., R. 276-277. Alter, however, 
assumed a dative *a/¢riz, on the model of 27/ii, etc.

  166 Aw InrRopucTION TO VULGAR LATIN. [s 398 
C. VERBS. 
1. THE FOUR CONJUGATIONS. 
396. There was some confusion of conjugations; the first 
and fourth were least affected. In the Peregrinatio the second 
decidedly preponderates over the third (Bechtel 87); in other 
texts the third gains at the expense of the second. 
The second gained most in Spain, the third in Italy, the 
fourth in Gaul. Eventually Spanish and Portuguese discarded 
the third, Sicilian and Sardinian the second. 
New formations went into the first and fourth. 
a. FIRST CONJUGATION. 
397. The first conjugation generally held its own, defections 
being few and partial. 
Beside do, dant and sto, stant there came into use *dao, 
*daunt and *stao, *staunt: Rum. dai, stat; Old It. dao; Pr. 
dau, daun, estau, estaun; Pg. dou, estou. Mohl, Lexigue 47, 
would connect these forms with Umbrian stahu, but it seems 
more likely that they were late Latin formations due to an 
effort to keep the root vowel distinct from the ending. Cf. 
Probus, “ado non adnao,” Lexique 47. 
In northern Gaul there may have developed with *stao a 
*stais and a *stait, on the analogy of (*vao), *vais, *vait 
(see § 405): cf. Lexigue 47-54. 
The Italian present subjunctive dia from dare is associated 
by Mohl, Lexigue 47 and Pr. Pers. Pi. 30, with Umbrian dia. 
It is entirely possible, however, that the form is a later, Italian 
development due to the analogy of séa. see $419, (2). 
398. For new formations,—such as abédreviare, follicare, 
werrizare, etc.,—see §§ 33-35. Germanic verbs in —ov and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  § 402] An InrRopucTiIon To VuLGAR LarTIN. 167 
-an (but not -yan)' regularly went in the first conjugation: 
roubén> It. rubare, witan>It. guidare. Cf. § 36. 
b. SECOND CONJUGATION. 
399. Even in Classic Latin there was some confusion 
yetween. the second conjugation and the third: fervére, tergére. 
In Vulgar Latin the second lost some verbs to the third in 
most of the territory: *ardére, *lucétre, lugire (R. 283), 
miscére (R. 284), *mordére, * nocére, * ridére, respondére ( Bech- 
tel 88: responduntur), tondére, * torcére (for torguere). Other 
verbs passed over locally or occasionally: seditur, Bechtel 88. 
400. Some verbs went into the fourth, probably through the 
pronunciation of —eo as —io (see $224): *complire, florire (R. 
284), *implire, * lucire, lugire (R. 284), *putrire. The inchoa- 
tive —éscére then became —iscére: *florisco, lucisco, * putrisco. 
Habere, at least in Italy, sometimes became Aadire: Vok. I, 
266ff.; havite, C. LZ. L. V, 1636; habibat, Stala, Luke VI, 8; 
avire in many Italian dialects in which ¢ does not phonetically 
become #, and even in early Tuscan (cf. E. Monaci, Crestoma- 
sia italiana dei primi secoli I, p. 20, 1. 1c, etc). According to 
Mohl, Lexigue 108-109, this is a peculiarity of ancient Umbrian. 
401. While retaining abeo, habes, habet, habent, the verb 
habére, under the influence of dare and stare, adopted the forms 
*ho or * hao, *has, * hat, * hant or * haunt. 
c. THIRD CONJUGATION. 
402. The third conjugation gave a few verbs to the second, 
perhaps beginning with those that had a perfect in —w, such 
as cadere * cadui, capere *capui, sapere sapui: sapere was influ- 
enced, especially in Italy, by Aabére; capere may easily have 
imitated sapere, and cadere may have followed capere.
-P-A-G-E-186
  168 Aw InrRopuction To VuLcaR LarTIN. [§ 404 
In Spain all the third conjugation verbs eventuaily passed 
into the second. This transition was probably helped by a 
partial fusion of ésse and sedeére. 
403. The anomalous /dsse pdtui, vélle vdlud naturally went 
over to the second conjugation, assumed the infinitive forms 
potere, *volere, and conformed their inflection more or less to 
the regular type. Vé//e, however, was discarded in Spain and 
Sardinia. 
(1) Potere, potebam occur repeatedly in the sixth century 
(Pr. Pers. Pl. 24), potebo is found in the GZ. Reich., potebas 
in Fredegarius (Haag 60). osso for possum is used by 
Gregory and Fredegarius (Pr. Pers. Pl. 24), poteo is attested 
in 745 a.p. (Pr. Pers. Pl. 25). The present indicative must 
have been inflected something like this: — 
possu posso poteo *posseo *potemu(s) 
Pote(s) poteste(s) *potete(s) 
*pote(t) possun(t) *poten(t) 
The present subjunctive must have had corresponding forms. 
(2) Volimus is found in the sixth century (Lat. Spr. 478), 
volemus in the seventh (Pr. Pers. Pl. 21); voles is found in 
the GZ. Reich. Volestis, framed on the pattern of foéestis, is 
twice used by Fredegarius (Pr. Pers. PZ. 21). The present 
indicative forms must have been something like this: — 
*vol¢o zelimu(s) volemu(s) 
vele(s) voleste(s) *volete(s) 
*ugle(t) *volen(t) 
The present subjunctive must have been similarly inflected. 
404. Beside facére there doubtless existed * fare (Lacere 48) 
strongly influenced by dare and stare. Dare and facere were 
associated in old formulas: ZLexigue 53. Furthermore, a sug- 
gestion of shortening existed in the monosyllabic imperative
-P-A-G-E-187
  
  § 405] Aw INTRODUCTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. 169 
Sac (also fa: Zs. XXV, 735), which must have led to *fate 
beside facite. The present indicative certainly had several 
sets of forms, one series being on the pattern of the first con- 
jugation, but the present subjunctive retained its old inflection 
(see Lacere 72, 121; Zs. XVIII, 434): — 
facio *fao *fo Sécimu(s) *fdimus *famu(s) 
face(s) *fais *fas ficitels) *féitis — *fate(s) 
face(t) *fait *fat faciun(t) *faunt — *fant 
There was also a rare infinitive facire, which occurs several 
times in the sixth and seventh centuries: Facere 13. 
405. Vadére supplied its missing past tenses from ive and 
other verbs. These other substitutes, whose origin constitutes 
one of the most discussed problems in Romance philology, re- 
sulted —to cite only the principal types — in the verbs * ad/are 
or alare (used in northern Gaul), *annare (used in southern 
Gaul), *adare (used in Spain and Italy). It is now generally 
thought that *a//are and * annare developed in some peculiar 
way (perhaps through distortion in military commands) from 
ambiilare, which is very common in late Latin in the sense of 
‘march’ or ‘walk.’ * Adare is commonly traced to * améitare, 
coming either from améitus or, more probably, from ambilare 
with a change of suffix. C. C. Rice, in the Publications of the 
Modern Language Association of America XIX, 217, argues that 
the three verbs sprang from Latin aznare (= adnare) and its 
derivatives * anniilare, *annitare. Yor a bibliography of the 
subject, see Korting. Cf. also A. Horning in Zs. XXIX, 542; 
H. Schuchardt in Zs. XXX, 83; Lexigue 56-78. Both ambu- 
lare and alare occur in the GZ. Reich. Amanavit is found on a 
sixth century African vase: see F. Novati in Studi Medievali 
I, 616-617. 
Zre and the other substitutes were introduced also into the
-P-A-G-E-188

present. The present indicative, moreover, was influenced by 
Sacere fare: — 
vado *vao *vo uddimu(s) imu(s) etc. 
vade(s) *vais *vas védite(s)  jte(s) ete. 
vade(t) *vait *vat vadun(t) *vaunt *vant 
406. Verbs in -zo tended to pass into the fourth conju- 
gation (see, however, §416): *capire, beside *capére; cupire, 
Lucretius (Zaz. Spr. 477), Densusianu 148, Bon. 426; fodiri, 
Cato; fugire, St. Augustine (Zaz. Spr. 477), common in the 
Vulgate (R. 285), Sepulcri 229, Bon. 427, Haag 60, Gl. Reich. ; 
moriri, Plautus, and * morire. 
Some others went over, at least locally: */allire; gemire, 
Pirson 148; occurire, Pirson 148; *offerire, * sofferire, by the 
analogy of aperire (sufferit, R. 286; cf. deferet, offeret, Bechtel 
90; offeret, first half of the 7th century, Carnoy 112); *seguire, 
beside * séguére. 
Dicére, probably in the Vulgar Latin period (cf. Lexigue 62), 
developed a form * dire, doubtless suggested by die (cf. fac and 
* fare, § 404) and helped by the analogy of audire. 
d. FOURTH CONJUGATION. 
407. The fourth conjugation usually held its own, and 
gained some verbs from the others. 
For new formations, — such as * addellire, ignire, — see § 34. 
Germanic verbs in —/am regularly went into the fourth conjuga- 
tion in Latin (Kluge 500): furbjan>It. forbire; marrjan> Fr. 
marrir; parrjan> Ft. tarir; warnjan> It. guarnire, Cf. § 3€. 
For the intrusion of the inchoative —sc— into this conjuga- 
tion, see § 415. 
2. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN INFLECTION. 
408. Of the personal forms of the verb there remained in 
general use in Romance only the following tenses of the active 
voice, the entire passive inflection having been discarded: the 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  § 410] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 17t 
indicative present, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and in some 
regions the future perfect; the subjunctive present, pluperfect, 
and in some regions the perfect; the imperative present. For 
instance: amo, amabam, amavi, amaram, (amaro); amem, 
amassem, (amarim); ama. See Syntax. 
Of the impersonal forms of the verb there remained: the 
present active infinitive, the present participle, the perfect 
participle, the gerund (especially the ablative case), and 
probably in some standing phrases the gerundive. For in- 
stance: amare, amans, amatus, amando, (amandus?). The 
supine fell into disuse from the first century on. See Syntax. 
409. The entire passive inflection came to be replaced, 
towards the end-of the Vulgar Latin period, partly by active 
and reflexive constructions but mainly by a compound of the 
perfect participle with ésse’ (in northern Italy /iér7): littéra 
scribitur > littera scripta est (or fit). 
Deponent verbs became active: mentire, operare, etc., R. 298; 
cf. R. 297-302, 388-389. Conversely, some writers substituted 
the deponent for the active inflection of a few verbs: Petronius, 
rideri, etc. R. 304; cf. R. 302-304. 
Cf. §§ 112-114. 
410. The Latin perfect was kept in its preterit sense. In 
its perfect sense it was replaced, in the Vulgar Latin period, 
by a compound of /adére and the perfect participle —in the 
case of neuter verbs, ésse and the perfect participle: /eci> 
habeo factum; reverti>reversus sum, R. 289. Similar com- 
pounds replaced the pluperfect and the future perfect. See 
§§ 121-124. 
The old pluperfect indicative (amdram, audiram) was kept, 
as a preterit or a conditional, in various regions: see $124. 
In the subjunctive the pluperfect was used instead of the  
-P-A-G-E-190
  
272 An InrRopucTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 412 
imperfect, which disappeared everywhere but in Sardinia (/a- 
cheret, etc.): amarem>amassem, audirem>audissem; cf. § 118. 
The old future perfect — ama(vé)ro —fused with the per- 
fect subjunctive —amd(vé)rim— and apparently remained 
more or less in use, as a future indicative or subjunctive, in 
all regions except Gaul and Retia. It is best preserved in 
Spanish and Portuguese, but is found also in Old Rumanian 
and Macedonian. There are traces of it in Old Italian, 
sometimes confused with the pluperfect indicative and later 
sometimes with the infinitive (dpriro, pdteri, crédere, etc.): see 
C. De Lollis in Bausteine 1; V. Crescini in Zs. XXIX, 619. 
411. The old future, with the exception of évo, was crowded 
out by the present and by new formations, especially by the 
infinitive combined with the present indicative of hadére 
(amabo > amar habeo): see §§$125-129. In this compound 
all the various forms of the present indicative of Aabére were 
used (see §§273, 401): *amar’ —dbeo, —dyo, —do, -6; *amar’ 
—dbe(s), —és; *amar —dbe(t), dt; *amar dben(t), —dunt, 
-dnt. In the first and second persons plural, abemus and 
habétis eventually, as they came to be regarded as mere end- 
ings, were reduced to —emu(s), —e/e(s), to correspond to the 
dissyllabic or monosyllabic —éyo, —dbe(s), —dbe(t),-dben(¢) and 
-6, ds, —dt, —int: * amar —ému(s), * amar’ —éte(s). 
On the model of this new future, an imperfect of the future, 
or conditional, came to be made, in late Vulgar Latin and 
Romance, from the infinitive combined with the imperfect or 
the perfect of Aadbére (see §130): *amar —abe(b)a(m) or 
*amar —abui. In these formations the unaccented (4)ab- 
disappeared, as in the first and second persons plural of the 
future: *amar’ —é(b)a, *amar —isti, etc.; but *amar dbui, etc. 
In Italian we find, beside -4a from habebam and —dbbi —ébbi 
from hadi, a form in —é (ameréi), which has prevailed in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-191
§ 414] Aw InrRopucTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 173 
modern language, while in Old Italian the e¢ was sometimes 
detached and used as a preterit of averve: it is probably due to 
the analogy of the first person singular of the weak preterit 
(credéi, hence crederéi), cf. § 426. 
412. Theimperative disappeared, except the present, second 
person singular and plural: dma, amate; téné, tenéle; créde, 
crédite; audi, audite. ‘The first and third persons were supplied 
from the present subjunctive. In some verbs the present sub- 
junctive was used instead of all imperative forms. See $115. 
Instead of the plural form, the second person plural of the 
present indicative came to be used: adferte > adferitis, R. 294. 
For the monosyllabic dic, duc, fac, writers sometimes employed 
dice, duce, face: R. 294. 
3. INCHOATIVE VERBS. 
413. The Latin inchoative ending —sco was preceded by @-, 
é, @, or 6-. The types —asco and —dsco were sparingly repre- 
sented and were not extended in late and popular Latin; they 
have bequeathed but few verbs — such as Pr. irdisser < irascére, 
condisser < co(g)ndscére — to the Romance languages. The 
types —ésco and —isco—as parésco, dormisco — were extended 
in the third century and later, and lost their inchoative sense. 
414. There is some evidence of a confusion of —ésco and 
-iscoin Latin. Virgilius Grammaticus (Sepulcri 194) mentions 
double forms of inchoative verbs, such as calesco calisco, etc. 
Clarisco, erubisco, etc., are common in Gregory the Great: 
Sepulcri 193. Cf. criscere, etc., in Vok. 1, 359 ff. 
In Veglia, the Abruzzi, Sardinia, and a part of Lorraine 
neither of these two endings left any trace. Only —ésco sur- 
vived in the Tyrol, the Grisons, French Switzerland, Savoy, 
Dauphiné, Lyons, the Landes, Béarn, and Spain — Sp. parecer, 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  
174 Aw Inrropuction To Vuicar Latin. [§ 416 
florecer; —esco was preferred also in Rumanian. Elsewhere, 
although there are traces of —ésco, —isco prevailed — Fr. @/ 
fleurit, It. fiorisce. For Pr. despereissir, etc., see E. Herzog in 
Bausteine 481. 
415. The ending —isco eventually entered into the formation 
of the present stem of fourth conjugation verbs. ‘There is no 
direct evidence of this in Latin, nor are there any traces of it 
in Spanish, Portuguese, Sardinian, or southern Italian; but in 
the earliest texts of France, northern and central Italy, Retia, 
and Rumania we find a type 
*finisco Jinimu(s) 
*finisce(s) Jinite(s) 
*finisce(t) *injscun(t) 
The —sc— then generally disappeared from the infinitive —It. 
fiorire. Later, in some regions, the —sc— was carried through- 
out the present indicative (Fr. finissons, finissez); it also pene- 
trated the present subjunctive (Fr. fizésse), and in some dis- 
tricts eventually the present participle and the imperfect 
indicative (Fr. jinissant, finissais). 
See Archiv I, 465; Zs. XXIV, 81; Rom. XXX, 291-294; 
Lat. Spr. 478. 
4. PRESENT STEMS. 
416. Many verbs in —éo dropped the 7 whenever it was fol- 
lowed by another vowel. In the present participle this was a 
regular phonetic development (see §225): audientem>* au- 
dente, facientem >* facente, partientem >* partente, sentieniem > 
*sentente. Wence forms without the 7 were introduced more 
or less into the indicative and subjunctive: audio *audo, 
* dormo, partiunt * partunt, sintiam * séntam, etc. 
By the analogy of these, the ¢ was occasionally lost in the 
second conjugation: video * vido, On the other hand, by the
-P-A-G-E-193
  
§ 419] AN IntTRopucTION TO VuLGAR LaTIN. OL saL7e 
analogy of capiunt, faciunt, etc., the second conjugation ad- 
mitted such forms as * hadeunt, * videunt, etc., beside the regu 
lar habent, vident, etc. 
417. The verbs struére, trahére, vehére developed infinitive 
forms * strigere, trdgere, végere (tragere and vegere are used by 
Fredegarius, Haag 34) and a whole present and imperfect 
inflection with —g-, as */rago, *tragam, *tragebam, The guttural 
was derived from the perfect indicative and the perfect parti- 
ciple — struxi structus, traxi tractus, vext vectus—on the 
analogy of ago actus, figo fixi, lego lectus, rego rexi rectus, lege 
tectus, and also jfingo jinxi fictus, tango tactus, and probably 
cingo cinxi cinctus, Jungo junxi junctus, pango panxi panctus, 
plango planxi planctus, ungo unxi unctus, etc. 
There may have been also * stricere, * trécere, * vécere, based 
on the analogy of dico dixi dictus, duco duxi ductus, 
Cf. Substrate VI, 131. 
418. The verbs dare, debére, dictre, facére, habéere, posse, 
stare, vadére, vélle underwent considerable changes in the 
present: see §§273, 397, 401, 403-406, 412, 416. 
419. LZsse was made into *éssére, to bring it into conformity 
with the usual third conjugation type. Considerable alterations 
were made in the present indicative and subjunctive. For the 
use of /iéri for ésse, see $409. The Spanish use of sedére fo: 
ésse is probably later than our period. 
(1) The present indicative shows some signs of a tendency 
to normalize its erratic inflection by making all the forms be 
gin with s. The old eswm cited by Varro (Pr. Pers. Pl. 128) 
went out of use. Italian se? and Retian ses point to a *sés 
beside és; Italian sze¢e and Retian siede, etc., indicate a * sétis 
for éstis, while there is some evidence of an alternative * sitis 
on the model of si#mus,; Old Italian se for é, Provengal ses for 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
176 ° Aw InrRopuction ro VutceaR Latin. [§ 420 
es, usually understood as reflexive forms, may go back to * sé# 
and *sés¢ for ést. In the first person plural siimus became 
simus and simus (see § 220); séimus, the usual Classic form, 
was preferred in Spain, Portugal, northern Gaul, and the Tyrol 
(Sp. somos, Old Fr. sons, etc.); stmus, which was used, accord- 
ing to Suetonius, by Augustus, and by various purists of the 
Augustan age (Stolz 58), prevailed in southern Gaul, Italy, 
Dalmatia, and Dacia (Pr. sem, Old It. semo, etc.): cf. Lat. Spr. 
479; Pr. Pers. Pl. 130; Rom. XXI, 347. Provengal esmes< 
*ésmus seems to be a new formation on the analogy of és¢is; 
Mohl, Pr. Pers. Pl. 135, would derive it from old estmus, which 
existed with eswm. The present indicative inflection was 
doubtless something like this : — 
som somu(s) semu(s) *esmu(s) 
es, “Ses este(s) *sete(s) — *sgte(s)? 
est set? *sest? sont 
(2) In the present subjunctive the analogy of other third 
conjugation verbs tended to introduce the characteristic vowel 
a. It is likely, too, that from early times there was a recipro- 
cal influence of fam, etc., and the Old Latin optative séem, etc. 
(cf. Lexigue 51): fret is common for ji, Pirson 150; iam re- 
places sém in northern Italy and Dacia. Hence comes an 
alternative inflection * stam, etc., which ultimately prevailed: — 
sem *sea simu(s) sidmu(s) 
sis *sea(s) site(s) *sidte(s) 
set sea(t) sent *sean(t) 
For stat, see sead in Vok. II, 42. Stiamus, according to Laz 
Sgr. 478, occurs in Italian documents of the eighth century. 
5. IMPERFECT. 
N.B.—For the loss of the imperfect subjunctive, see § 118. 
420. The endings were —adbam, —cham, —iébam, —ibam. In 
the third conjugation —é¢bam regularly developed into —ebam,   
 
-P-A-G-E-195
    § 423] Aw InrropuctTiIon TO VULGAR LaTIN. 177 
just as —ienfem > —entem (see §§ 225,416): facicham >* facebam. 
In the fourth conjugation —i¢bam and —idam existed side by 
side from early times (Neue II, 445), —26am — as in munibam 
— being common in early Latin and recurring at later periods 
(Lindsay 491); —2bam, which stressed the characteristic vowel 
of the fourth conjugation, prevailed in popular speech, and 
-i¢bam disappeared: vestibat, etc., Dubois 277-278. 
421. Habébam, pronounced aBeBa (cf. $318), developed 
another form, *afea, probably through dissimilation. Hence 
came an alternative ending —ea for -eBa, which in Romance 
was widely extended, affecting all the conjugations but the 
first: It. vedéa, credéa, sentia. It is common to nearly all the 
Romance territory except Rumania: Zaz Spr. 479. 
6. PERFECT. 
422. We must distinguish two types, the weak and the 
strong: the weak comprises the z— perfects in which the z is 
added to a verb-stem (—d@vi, —évi, -iv7), the strong includes all 
others. Verbs of the first and fourth conjugations generally 
had weak perfects, those of the second and third had mostly 
strong. Only six verbs—all of the second conjugation and 
most of them rare — regularly had a perfect in —év/: de/eo, fico, 
neo, —oleo, —pleo, vieo; silevit for siluit occurs also, R. 287. 
All first and fourth conjugation verbs with strong perfects 
probably developed a weak one in Vulgar Latin: prestiti> 
brestavi, R. 289; salui>salivi. For further encroachment of 
the weak type on the strong, see § 426. 
a. WEAK PERFECTS. 
423. A tendency to keep the stress on the characteristic 
vowel, and also a general inclination to omit v between two 7’s 
(see § 324), led early, in the fourth conjugation, to a reduction
-P-A-G-E-196
  178 Aw Inrropuction To VuLcaR Latin. [§ 424 
of —ivisti to -ist# and —ivistis to —istis, which brought about, 
still early, the further reduction of —7v7 to —é and *-7Z7, —ivi¢ to 
itt and *-ii#, -ivérunt to -ieruné, and, later, the reduction of 
—ivimus to -imus and probably *-immus (the lengthening of 
he m being due to compensation and also, perhaps, to a desire 
o distinguish the perfect from the present). For —#i, as in 
Jeniit, see Servius ad Aen. I, 451; for —cerunt, see Neue III, 
452-454; for —imus, as in repetimus, etc., see Neue III, 449. 
Then a contraction of the two vowels gave, in the first and 
third persons singular and the third person plural, —¢, —7/ 
*_irunt: audt, Neue III, 434 (cf. S. 241: 65-121 A.D.); petit, 
etc., Neue III, 446-448; “cupit pro cupivit,” Priscian XII, 
17 (Keil II, 587); pertt, petit, redit, Bayard 60; ferit, etc., 
Bon. 440. 
A contraction without the fall of z, in the third person sing- 
ular, gave rise, locally, to an alternative form, *-zu¢: It. 
servio, etc. 
424. The loss of v, carried into the first conjugation, gave 
rise early to a reduction of —dvisti, —dvistis, —dvérunt to —asti, 
-astis, —arunt. Much later —dvi>-di, —avit> ait and ~at, 
-avimus >-amus and probably *-dmmus: calcai (Probus), 
edificai, probai (Probus), Vok. II, 476; ceyva, Densusianu I, 
152;—Jaborait, C. I. L. X, 216; speclarait, Vok. 11, 476; dedi- 
cait, Lexigue 46; “fumat pro fumavit,” Priscian XII, 17 (Keil 
Il, 587); denumerat, judicat, Fredegarius (Haag 55);—celebra- 
mus, memoramus, vocitamus, Gregory of Tours (Bon. 440); 
speramus, Fredegarius (Haag 55). ‘The third person singular 
in —at is found in Old Sardinian: Lat. Spr. 479. 
A contraction without the fall of v gave rise, in the third 
person singular, to —aw/; and, in the first person plural, prob- 
ably to *-aumus. triumphaut in Pompeii, Densusianu I, 152. 
This -au? prevailed in Romance: It. amd and amdo, etc. The
-P-A-G-E-197
§ 426] Aw InrRopuction TO VuLGaR LaTIN. 179 
*_aumus is preserved in some Old French dialects near Douai: 
Rom. XXX, 607. 
425. The forms in the first and fourth conjugations, there- 
fore, were: — 
  tui i XH HE ~dstp i 
-dve(t)  -dut —dit —dt —tue(t) *-fut = *-fit -4it -tt 
-dvimu(s) -dmu(s) *-dmmu(s) *-dumus +fvimu(s) -{mu(s) *-tmmu(s) 
—dste(s) -fste(s) 
—drun(t) *trun(t) 
With the exception of —2vz in Old Italian, the forms with 7 
were not preserved in Romance. 
Verbs in —évz doubtless had a similar inflection: *de/é, 
delésti, etc. Some other second conjugation verbs apparently 
adopted this perfect: sz/evit, R. 287. 
426. Compounds of dave had a perfect in -didi (crédidi, 
perdidi, vendidi, etc.), which in Vulgar Latin became —dédi 
(see § 139): perdedit, etc., Audollent 544. This —dedi was ex- 
tended to many other verbs in —d-: prandidi, Keil IV, 184; 
descendidi, respondidi, Lat. Spr. 479, 480; ascendiderat, descen- 
didit, incendederit, odedere, pandiderunt, prendiderunt, videderunt 
(cf. edediderit with an extra —de—), R. 288. 
Through the analogy of —a, *-é, *-i7, helped by dissimila- 
tion, this dedi became *—-dei. Hence arose eventually an inflec- 
tion *-dei, *—desti, *-det, *-dem(m)u(s), *-deste(s), —derun(t), 
from which there came a set of endings *—¢/, *—estd, etc., cor- 
responding to the —a/ —ast, etc., and the —7, —ds?i, etc., of the 
first and fourth conjugations: so caderunt, Gl. Reich. In some 
of the Romance languages these endings were carried into 
other verbs of the third and even the second conjugation (It. 
battéi, Pr. cazé); in Provengal they invaded the first also 
(améi). In Dacia, on the other hand, they apparently did 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
180 An IntRopucTion To VuLGAR LarTIN. [s 428 
not develop at all. In Italy, under the influence of stetti< 
* stétui, dare had (beside diedi<dédi) a perfect detti, whence 
arose an inflection —de¢#i, etc., and a set of endings —e/ti, etc., 
beside —d¢z and -e7. 
Through these endings the weak type encroached some- 
what on the strong. In Italy all strong verbs except esse 
introduced weak endings in the second person singular and 
the first and second persons plural: It. presi, prendesti, etc.; 
cf. plaudisti for plausisti, R. 286, also vincistit, Gl. Reich. In 
Rumania, where there was no —de/, the —wi and —s¢ types were 
extended. 
A few weak verbs adopted strong inflections: guesivi> 
* ques, sapivi > sapui. 
b. STRONG PERFECTS. 
427. There are three types — those that add ~ to the root, 
those that add s, and those that have nothing between the 
root and the personal endings: plac-u-t, dic-s-i = dixi, bib-t, 
In the first class the w lost its syllabic value and became w 
(cf. § 326): placwi, etc. 
428. The —wi type, according to Meyer-Liibke, Gram. II, 
357, included from the start not only perfects of the placui 
sort, but also all perfects in —z7 not made from the verb-stem 
(cf. §422),— such as cogndvi, crévi, movi, pavi, —this ending 
being pronounced wz/, but written v7 to avoid the doubling of 
the v. At any rate, the development of the v/ indicates that 
it was sounded ww, ww, or Bwé in Vulgar Latin: cf. It. 
conobbi, crebbi, etc.; Pr. moc, etc. 
This perfect disappeared from the first and fourth conjuga- 
tions: crepui>* crepavi, necui > necavi, etc.; aperui > * aperii 
*apersi, salui>salivi salii *salsi, etc In the second and 
.third conjugations it maintained itself very well: cognovi, crevi,
-P-A-G-E-199
  § 430) An INTRODUCTION TO VuLGAR LATIN. 181 
gemui(?), messui(?), molui, movi, pavi, tenui, texui. It lost 
posut (>post), siluc (>si/evi), and possibly a few others. On 
the other hand it received many additions: b%2> * bidut; 
cécidi > * cadui * cadedi; cépi> caput, Haag 56, Lat. Spr. 479 
(so *recipui); expavi>expabui, Lat. Spr. 479; légi>* légui 
*ixi: natus sum>*nacui; peperci> parcui, R. 288; sapivi> 
sapui; sedi>* sedui; stéti> also * stétui; sustitli>*tolui * tolsi; 
texi > texui, Lat. Spr. 479; vent > also *vénui; vici > also 
*yincui *vinsi; vidi> also *vidui *vidui; vixi>also *viscut; 
etc. Cf. A. Zimmermann in Avchiv XIII, 130; Zs, XXVIII, 97. 
  429. Of the —s7 class, — which comprised perfects in —s?, 
—ssi, and —x/,— some thirty-five were preserved: arsi, cinxi, 
claust, coxi, divisi, dixi, duxi, excussi, finxt, fixi, frixi, junxt, 
luxi, mansi, misi (also *missi, perhaps cn the model of missus, 
cf. $163), mulsi, pinxi, planxi, pressi, rasi, rexi, risi, rosi, scripst, 
sparst, —stinxt, strinxt, struxi, tersi, tinxt, torst, traxt, unxi, vixt. 
Sensi, however, became * sentit. 
In Vulgar Latin there were perhaps some thirty or more 
new formations: adsco(m)si, Keil VII, 94; *accé(n)si; 
*apérsi; *attinxi; *copérsi; *cirsi; *defe(n)si; *érsi from 
érigo; *franxi; *“fusi; *impinxi; *léxi; *morsi; * occist; 
*offersi; *pe(n)si; pérsi, Lat. Spr. 480; posi, R. 288; *pré(n)- 
si; *piinxi; *quesi; *redémpst; *respo(n)si; *rosi; * salsi; 
*sdlsi; *sirsi; *taxi, *tanxi; *té(n)si; *tolsi; *vinsi; 
*ydlsi. Some of these—* defensi, * fusi, * morsi, * occisi, * pensi, 
*prensi, *responsi, *rosi, *tensi — assumed the s— perfect 
through having an s in the perfect participle. 
Cf. Einf. § 165. 
430. Among the -7 perfects, the reduplicative formations 
were discarded in Vulgar Latin, with the exception of dédi and 
stéti (also *s7étui), whose reduplicative character was no longer 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [§ 431 
apparent; compounds of dave usually formed their perfect like 
the simple verb (cf. § 426; but circumdavit in Gl. Reich.), 
while compounds of s¢are tended to follow the regular first 
conjugation model (prestiti> prestavi, R. 289). , Cétdi be- 
came *cadui or *cadedi; fefelli>*falii; peperci > parcui, 
R. 288. The other reduplicative perfects either disappeared 
or passed into the —sé class: cucurri> *ciirsi; momordi> 
*morsi; pependi>*pé(n)si; pupiigi>*piinxi; tetendi> 
*te(n)si; tetégi>* taxi * tanxi, 
The other ~Z perfects were greatly reduced in number in 
Vulgar Latin. Some simply disappeared, some became weak, 
some went over to the —wz or the -si type: égi, vérti; fugi> 
*fugit; bibi>* bibui, cepi> caput, legit > * legui, sedi >* sedui; 
accendi >* accé(n) si, defendi >* defe(n) si, frégi>* franxi, fiidi 
>*fisi, legi>* lixi, prendi>* pré(n)si, solvi>* solsi, vici> 
* vinsi, volvi>*volsi. There were no additions. Two of 
the old perfects maintained themselves intact, and two more 
were kept beside new formations: féci, fud; veni * vénui, vidi 
* vidui. 
431. In fui the wu was originally long, but it was shortened 
in Classic Latin; Vulgar Latin seems to show both # and #. 
In an effort to keep the accent on the same syllable throughout 
(cf. §§ 423-424), fuisti> *fusti, fuistis>*fustis; then fuimus 
generally became */um(m)us, fuit was often shortened to 
*fui, and fuérunt became *furunt, There may have been also, 
through dissimilation, a form */drunt. 
The prevailing inflection, with some variations, was probably 
something like this: — 
Sua fe *fom(m)u(s) 
*/fosti *foste(s) 
Soe(t) Suet) *fot *fut — *forun(t) *furun() *ferun(t)? foerun(Z?

7. PLUPERFECT AND FUTURE PERFECT. 
432. When preserved at all, these tenses followed the old 
types: plécuéram (cf. § 137), placuissem, pldcuéro; dixérani, 
dixissem, dixéro; Sécéram, Secissem, fécéro. Informations from 
weak perfects only the contracted forms were used: amdram, 
amassem, amiaro; deléram, deléssem, deléro; audi(e)ram, audis- 
sem, audi(e)ro; cf. alaret, ortaret in Gl. Reich. Bayard 60~61 
notes that St. Cyprien employed only the shortened forms — 
petisset, etc. — before ss. 
433- In some regions a tendency to keep the accent on the 
same syllable throughout the pluperfect subjunctive led to a 
change of —assémus, —assétis, etc., to *-dssimus, *—dssitis, etc.: 
It. amdssimo amdste, Sp. hablisemos habléseis; but Pr. amessém 
amessétz, Fr. aimassions aimassiés. 
8. PERFECT PARTICIPLE. 
434. Verbs which had no perfect participle were obliged to 
form cne in order to make their passive and their perfect 
tenses: fério, * feritus. 
435. In the first conjugation —d¢us was preserved and was 
extended to all verbs: /rictus > fricatus; nectus > necatus; sec- 
tus > secatus; so the new alatus, Gl. Reich. The ending —itws, 
in the first conjugation, generally fell into disuse: crepitus > 
*crepatus; domitus > domatus, R. 295; plicitus> plicatus; soni- 
tus >* sonatus; tonitus >* tonatus; vetitus> vetatus, R. 296. 
Nevertheless there were some new formations in —itus: * Jévi- 
tus, provitus, rdgitus, vocitus; cf. Lat. Spr. 480. 
In the third conjugation —d/us disappeared: oblatus >offertus 
(G2. Reich.), sublatus>* suffertus, by the analogy of apertus, 
copertus; sublatus (from tollo) > tollitus (GI, Reich.).
-P-A-G-E-202
184 An InTRopUCTION TO VuLGaR LartIN. [§ 439 
436. In the fourth conjugation —Z/ws was preserved and was 
extended to nearly all verbs: sa/tus>*salitus; sensus>*sentitus; 
sepultus > sepelitus, old and found in all periods, Pirson 152, 
Gl. Reich, Apertus and copertus, however, were kept; and 
ventus generally became * venitus. ; 
In the third conjugation guesitus > * guestus. 
437. In the second conjugation the rare —éfus disappeared 
as a participial ending: comp/étus, etc., were kept only as ad- 
jectives. 
438. The ending —#/us, belonging to verbs in —were and 
—vere (argutus, consutus, minutus, secutus, solutus, statutus, tri- 
butus, volutus), offered a convenient accented form, corres- 
ponding to —d/ws and —itus. It was extended to nearly all the 
verbs that had an —w7 perfect: *dcbutus, *habutus, *parutus, 
* tenutus, *venutus, *vidutus, etc.; but status. It did not al- 
ways, however, entirely displace the old perfect participle: 
natus was kept beside * nasciitus. 
Eventually —a/ws was carried further, —as *credutus, * per- 
dutus, *vendutus, —and in Sicily encroached largely on —Ztus. 
On the other hand, * mdvitus and *mdssus were formed be- 
side * movutus, * sdlvitus (or *sdltus) beside solutus, * vdlvitus 
(or *vdltus) beside volutus. 
439. The ending -i¢us tended to disappear (cf. § 435): 
absconditus >absco(n) sus; bibitus>*bibutus; creditus>*credu- 
tus; fugitus > *fugitus; molitus >* molutus; paritus >* paru- 
tus *parsus; perditus>*perdutus *persus; submonitus > 
*submo(n)sus; venditus >*vendutus. A few of these partici- 
ples, however, remained, and there were some new formations 
in tus: gémitus?, pos(z)tus, sdlitus; * lévitus, * movitus, provi- 
tus, rogitus, * sdlvitus (or *sdltus), tollitus, vocitus, *vdlvitus 
(or * vdltus). 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
§ 441] An INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 185, 
440. The ending —/ws was kept for some twenty verbs, oc- 
casionally with a change of stem: cénctus; dictus; ductus; ex- 
stinctus; factus; fictus finctus, R. 295; fractus *franctus; fric- 
tus; lectus; mistus; pictus * pipctus; punctus; rectus; scriptus; 
strictus * strinctus; structus; *surtus for surrectus; tactus? 
*/anctus?; tinctus; tortus; tractus. ‘There were a few new for- 
mations in —tus.: offertus, *questus, * suffertus, *vistus; and 
perhaps * sd/tus, *vdltus (cf. § 439). 
About fifteen verbs probably replaced —/us by —atus, —itus, 
or —wtus: captus *capitus; cognotus >* conovitus?; crétus > 
*crevitus?; fartus > *farcitus and farsus, Lat. Spr. 480; frictus 
>fricitus; motus>* movitus? and * mdssus; nectus > necatus ; 
pastus > *paviitus?; saltus>*salitus and *salsus; sectus> 
secatus,; sepultus > sepelitus; tentus> *teniutus; lexus > * texu- 
tus; ventus >*venitus and venitus, Bechtel 91; victus > * vin- 
catus and * vinctus; victus >* vixitus. 
441. The ending —sws was generally kept: acce(”)sus; ar- 
sus; clausus; defe(n)sus; adivisus; excussus; fixus; fusus; 
ma(n)sus; missus, also perhaps *misus by the analogy of 
mist; morsus; pe(n) sus; pre(n)sus; pressus; risus; rosus; 
sparsus; te(n)sus; tersus; to(n)sus; visus, also probably * vis- 
tus. Several of these developed also a participle in —dfus: 
*pendutus, *vidutus, etc. Salsus, ‘salted,’ maintained itself 
beside saditus. 
A few verbs replaced the old form by one in —?tus or —atus: 
expansus > * expandutus; falsus>* fallitus; fusus > fundutus, 
GL. Reich.; gavisus>*gaudutus; messus > metitus, Dubois 282; 
sensus >* sentitus; sessus>* sedutus. 
On the other hand, there were some new formations in —sus + 
absco(n)sus, Keil VII, 94, Zaz. Spr. 480, R. 295 (very com- 
mon); farsus, Lat. Spr. 480; *mossus; *parsus; *persus; 
* salsus; * submo(n)sus.

  186 AN INTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LaTIN. [8 447 
9. PERSONAL ENDINGS. 
442. For the reduction of —7o to —0, see $416. 
443. Meyer-Liibke, Grundriss 1°, 670, assumes that in Italy 
-ds and -és became -7. The evidence, historically considered, 
does not support this view. Italian /odi and Rumanian /auzi, 
from /audas, are correctly explained by Tiktin 565-566 as 
analogical formations. 
444. As unaccented ¢, ¢, and /came to be pronounced alike 
($243), great confusion ensued between —és and —?s, —é and 
-it, This confusion is very frequent in the Peregrinatio: Bech- 
tel 88-89, colliget, etc. 
445. In southern and to some extent in northern Gaul the 
first person plural lost its final s, perhaps in the Vulgar Latin 
period: widémus> Pr. vezém. This is not a phonetic phe- 
nomenon, as —s did not fall in this region. It may be that 
—s was dropped because it was regarded as a characteristic of 
the second person, as ¢ was of the third (cf. Pr. Pers. Pl. 
73-80): — dmo *amdmu 
dmas amdtes 
dmat dmant 
446. According to Mohl, Pr. Pers. Pl, forms like *cdnomus, 
due to Celtic influence, were used in northern Gaul instead of 
canimus, etc.; then the accent was shifted to the penult — 
*canémus, whence came the French ~ovs. This theory has 
not found acceptance. 
447. In strong perfects the first person plural, —imus, — 
through the analogy of —¢s/#s and —ésti, and doubtless of weak 
perfects as well, — tended, perhaps after our period, to stress 
its penult: fécimus> Pr. fezém. There are traces of this in 
inscriptions and elsewhere: S. 47, 53. The shift, however,
-P-A-G-E-205
  § 450] An InTRODUCTION TO VULGAR LATIN. 187 
was not universal, as there are in Italian and French remains 
of the original accentuation. 
448. In the present indicative and imperative, —%mus, —itis, 
—tte generally became, in the sixth or seventh century, —ému(s), 
—¢te(s), —¢te,—the penult assuming the accent, to match 
—dmu(s), —dte(s), —dte and —ému(s), —¢te(s), —¢te and -imu(s), 
ite(s), éte in the other conjugations. The shift was perhaps 
helped by the analogy of the future — mit/imus, for instance, 
being attracted by mittémus: Pr. Pers. Pl. 30,64. Rumanian, 
however, kept the old accent (Tiktin 596): wugem, ungeti; vin- 
dem, vindeti ; etc. There are some traces of its preservation 
in southeastern French dialects also. Furthermore, /facimus, 
facitis and dictmus, dicitis kept their old forms in many regions. 
449. For the reduction of —¢wn¢ to —unt, see §416. Beside 
—ent, in the second conjugation, there was an ending *-ewnt 
(*habeunt, etc.), —due to the analogy of -éun/, — which was 
particularly common in Italy: cf. § 416. 
The endings —ev¢ and —un¢ came to be very much confused 
(*crédent, * vidunt, etc.); their interchange is frequent in the 
Peregrinatio: Bechtel 88—go, absolvent, accipient, exient, respon- 
duntur, etc. According to Mohl, Pr. Pers. P/. 112, the con- 
fusion goes back to early Italic. The Classic distinction was 
best kept in Gaul and northern Italy; in Spain and Portugal, 
Sardinia, and a part of southern Italy, -ev¢ prevailed; in cen- 
tral and the rest of southern Italy, Retia, Dalmatia, and 
Dacia, —un¢ was preferred. 
450. In the perfect, the third person plural ending -éve was 
discarded. The ending -erum?, in Classic Latin, sometimes 
had a short ¢ (¢ is common in the comic poets, Virgil wrote 
tulérunt, etc.); in Vulgar Latin this vowel was apparently al- 
ways short: débuerunt, dixerunt, viderunt. Cf. $137.

PUBLISHER’S PREFACE 
Aut who are acquainted with Mrs. Chambers’ work know 
it to be marked by accuracy and care, by painstaking re- 
search and verification. This present book is the result of 
more than seventeen years of specialization in teaching and 
studying the subject of the feeding, general care, training, 
etc., of children from birth to boy- and girlhood. Mrs. 
Chambers has conducted classes in this subject in Pratt 
Institute, Brooklyn, New York; in the Millikin University, 
Decatur, Illinois; and in Rockford College for Women, Rock- 
ford, Illinois. She has given lectures and lecture courses on 
special phases of the subject in Cornell University, the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, and before women’s clubs in various 
States. She has had serial and other articles on child-care 
published by the Youth’s Companion, Modern Priscilla, and 
other magazines. 
Care AND TRAINING OF Boys AND GiRLs is unique in that 
it is so widely inclusive. It covers the first eighteen years 
of life; it treats of food and diet, exercise, fresh air, sleep, 
and all physical care of the body. It discusses the normal 
growth and development of children at different ages, also 
their intellectual advancement, and the special traits of cer- 
tain years. It deals with games and play appropriate, phys- 
ically and psychologically, to different periods. It suggests 
the right toys for the right times. It stresses such important 
topics as free will and obedience, the formation of habits, 
and the instincts to be cultivated. Reading lists are given 
for children from six years up, pictures and enjoyment of 
pictures is touched upon. When to send the child to Nurs- 
ery School, Kindergarten, primary and grammar schools, 
and what to expect and demand of these schools is set forth. 
Recognized authorities on the subjects dealt with are 
quoted, the personal experience of parents is utilized, to- 
gether with the writer’s own experience during years of 
observation and first-hand study of children.

LADIES, PLEASE READ THIS FIRST! 
Tue young father of a small, colicky baby was told that 
when the child was three months old the trouble would dis- 
appear; consequently, on the last day of the infant’s third 
month of life he watched the clock — strong in faith that 
his Mary’s pains would vanish on the stroke of the minute. 
It is hardly likely that even an inexperienced mother would 
make such a mistake, yet it may be well to warn you, ladies, 
that when in this book certain times and seasons are assigned 
for certain happenings and developments, this means — like 
the railroad time tables — that hours are subject to change 
without notice. 
Every phase of development may be looked for, but not 
always at the specified season. The unfolding of every trait 
and characteristic should be watched for, but no two chil- 
dren will demonstrate them in equal degree. It is possible 
that even the angles of the time, called by Mrs. Cabot the 
Age of Angularity (‘‘Seven Ages of Childhood”’: Ella Lyman 
Cabot), mentioned in Chapter VI of our book, will be so 
gently rounded as not to protrude inconveniently in family 
relations. Yet, they will probably be felt by the watchful 
mother. 
Neither can any two children be treated alike. Each is an 
individual who has not his duplicate, in body, mind, or dis- 
position, in the whole world. Each will react differently to 
the same stimulus. All the rules, all the counsels, are only 
general, and to put them into practice will in every case be 
making an experiment. 
Nevertheless and notwithstanding, we hope this book will 
please you and be of service to you. Strong in this hope, we 
formally dedicate it

Cuapter I 
THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND THE NEW-BORN 
CHILD 
Extent and Limitations of the Mother’s Influence 
Once upon a time there was a popular belief that the 
mother, by an exercise of will power, thought concentration, _ 
or something of the kind, could impress on her unborn child * 
any quality from beauty to bravery, any gift from a genius 
for music to a faculty for mathematics. Then came along 
the scientists, with their questions and doubts, their ex- 
clusion of everything except irrefragable proofs; and they — 
or at least most of them — decided that the mother had no 
such power over the child. They laughed to scorn, or 
branded as mere coincidence, all the instances given of 
children who had in some way been “marked” by what the 
mother had thought, or done, or suffered before the birth 
of the infant. The old fallacy of prenatal influence was 
disposed of for the time. 
However, one of the excellent virtues of our true scientists 
is that they never hesitate to own themselves in the wrong 
by a complete reversal of old teaching by new. They now 
admit that a decided prenatal influence may be exerted by 
the mother — a strong, but restricted influence. They say 
that such qualities as the sex of the child, and its funda- 
mental physical, mental, and spiritual traits, are determined 
at the moment when life begins. The child i is, so to speak, 
endowed with a certain amount of goods, and the mother 
has no power to add one jot or tittle to this endowment. 
Here is her limitation. 
But, though quantitatively and qualitatively she is rigidly - 
restricted from possible increase of her child’s goods, she yet 
has the awful power to diminish its endowment, to put 
stumbling blocks in the way of the capacities it has been 
I
-P-A-G-E-18
  2 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
gifted with. She may not know what were the specific gifts 
the child was meant to have, she may not know in what 
measure these were bestowed, but she should know that she 
is responsible for their conservation, she should know that it 
depends on her prenatal care whether her child shall or 
shall not bring into the world the full percentage of the 
seedling gifts which are afterwards to grow and blossom 
with its growth. The mother, before its birth, is the environ- 
ment of the child, and has all the power to help or to hurt 
that is exercised by environment. 
Rules for the Expectant Mother 
The mother’s care of her child should begin with her care 
of herself, in the interests of the child, during her period of 
expectation. A couple of generations ago a “knowledge- 
able” New England mother framed, out of the fulness of 
her own experience, a few rules for the care of the yet un- 
born child which can hardly be improved upon today. 
These were, in substance, the following: 
(1) Eat easily digested food, and avoid the over-stimulation of 
much tea or coffee, or strong condiments or spices. Use laxative 
foods to promote elimination. 
(2) Wear light and easy-fitting clothing, sufficiently warm for 
protection from chill, sufficiently cool for comfort; but so free from 
restriction that when the clothing is removed the body should 
nowhere show marks from pressure or tight bindings. 
(3) Spend as much time as possible in the open air, enjoy the sun- 
shine when not too hot, and take regular exercise enough to stimulate 
respiration and circulation without reaching the point of fatigue. 
(4) Hear all the music that you can, enjoy all the available good 
pictures, all the beauties of natural scenery, and develop taste in 
all things fair and lovely. 
(5) Keep tranquil and happy in mind. 
By attention to the foregoing rules the mother can make 
the great hour easier to herself, and this alone may have a 
highly important bearing on the future well-being of both 
herself and her child. Further, every mother-to-be should 
know that according to a report of the United States Census
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD 3 
Bureau we are informed that one infant in every three or 
four who die under the age of one month, dies as the result 
of conditions which had place either before or during its 
birth. Such conditions are to a large extent in the control 
of the mother. 
Concerning the Diet 
Besides the avoidance of all unwholesome and indigesti- 
ble articles of food, there are at least three points worthy of 
particular attention. 
First, the food should be rich in the minerals needed to 
supply the bones and teeth of the child. We are accus- 
tomed to speaking of the new-born baby as toothless. He is 
not a bit of it! Inside those little red gums there are hidden 
twenty perfect teeth, ready to show themselves as soon as 
they are needed. Sometimes a baby is born with one or two 
already out. The child’s teeth begin to be formed about 
seven months before its birth, and since the mother-to-be 
commonly experiences trouble with her own, it is thought 
that the materials from her teeth are commandeered by 
nature to supply those needed by the child. However this 
may be, it is sure that minerals are needed in the diet of the 
mother, and milk, whole grains, and green vegetables should 
be liberally supplied to furnish them. < 
Second, the food should be laxative, because elimination 
is of the highest importance, and it is better that this should 
result from food rather than from medicine. The citrus 
fruits, and most other fresh fruits; dried figs, dates, and 
prunes; spinach, boiled onions, the green leaves of lettuce, 
all are laxative. Where there is an obstinate tendency to 
constipation it will be found that raw parsnips, thoroughly 
well masticated, are almost a certain remedy, if they other- 
wise agree with the mother. Other old-fashioned remedies 
are senna prunes, and bran muffins. 
Third, more liquids are needed in the diet before the baby 
is born than at ordinary times. Liquids aid in elimination of 
waste, and the mother has now to eliminate waste from both 
her own body and the rapidly growing body of her child. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  4 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Six glasses of water in the day are advised; besides such 
other liquid foods as broths and soups, cocoa, fruit drinks, 
buttermilk and sweet milk. The last is of particular value 
at this time, and a taste for it should be formed if only on 
account of its valuable vitamine content. A glass or two 
between meals with a toasted pilot cracker or triscuit will 
be found excellent for one of those supplementary lunches 
needed during pregnancy. 
Morning Sickness 
There is often — and more particularly before the birth 
of the first child — a highly distressing nausea experienced 
in the morning. This may frequently be helped by eating 
next to nothing at the evening meal, or by having this meal 
at an earlier hour to ensure its digestion before bedtime. It 
is also good to eat in the morning, a short time before the 
regular breakfast, a few mouthfuls of dry starchy food need- 
ing mastication.” The crisped puffed grains, shredded wheat 
or triscuit, unsweetened rusk or zweiback, hard toasted 
crackers, or lightly salted popcorn, are all worth trying. 
Increased Appetite 
Since it is during the last four months that the yet un- 
born child gains most in weight, it is to be expected that the 
appetite of the mother should increase during this period, 
and be extra large during the last two months, when the 
child normally gains one-half of the weight at birth. To 
satisfy this appetite, and to provide enough of food for two 
without overloading the stomach and taxing digestion, nour- 
ishing lunches between meals ought to be provided. It is 
also said that from the beginning it is well to substitute five, 
or even six light meals instead of the regulation three hearty 
ones, for this helps to prevent the morning sickness or nausea 
mentioned awhile ago. 
Maintenance of Cheerfulness and Poise 
The women who find this last rule the hardest to carry 
out are those to whom it is of the greatest importance. The
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD 5 
nerves of a sensitive woman subjected to the strain of these 
months of preparation, are often peculiarly intolerant of 
small irritations. She should endeavor to control such dis- 
turbance and to avoid its occasions. She should learn how 
to soothe mental turmoil and where to seek curative dis- 
tractions. Too much or too little work, or play, or exercise, 
or social intercourse, are often predisposing causes of nerv- 
ous irritation. Improper food and an insufficiency of 
sleep, also of out-of-doors air, are still commoner causes of 
the same. So are strong excitements, and anything which 
provokes emotions of anger, worry, or fear. These last 
especially alter the quality of the blood, and are unwhole- 
some, if not dangerous, to both mother and child. It is not 
the easiest time for a woman to ee the self-discipline 
of self-control of her thoughts and emotions, yet the incen- 
tive of the welfare of her child ought to be ‘a potent stimulus 
to effort in this direction. 
There is such a thing as tadeabsa the habit of happiness 
and tranquillity. How to form this most estimable of habits 
is something that each individual has to discover for him- 
self — for one person’s way of doing it does not always suit 
another. To find out your best way is your problem. To 
put this into practice and win out is your job. 
THE NEW-BORN INFANT. “THE NURSING 
MOTHER, ETC. 
Someone has described the advent of the new-born baby 
as entrance into a cold world where it has to work for its 
living from the very start. It emerges from the warmth of 
the mother’s body into a room probably twenty degrees 
colder. It is compelled immediately to master the new and 
strange art of breathing. It has to endure being washed and 
dressed and handled for the first time in its life. It has to 
accustom its eyes to light, and (perhaps in a couple of hours), 
its ears to noise. It is forced to labor for its food by the em- 
ployment of a kind of suction pump, and to put forth the 
effort of swallowing this food—something it never did before.
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  6 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
No wonder there are cries of protest and dissatisfaction. 
No wonder it begins to lose weight, and suffers a fall in 
temperature from the stress of having to accommodate itself 
to so many new and difficult experiences. 
More than this. A woman physician, who has carefully 
and sympathetically observed new-born infants, asserts 
that unmistakable signs of fear are present during the first 
hour of life. When fretful crying persists through what she 
believes to be the reaction of fear to unknown conditions 
she often quiets wailing babies by placing their arms folded 
against their chests, their legs gently flexed at the knee and 
bent against the stomach, in imitation of the accustomed 
prenatal posture, and she recommends this treatment to 
soothe and quiet a fretful infant and put it to sleep, in pref- 
erence to the more drastic measures of dosing with oil for 
colic. 
Weight and Height 
The average weight of an infant at birth is seven pounds, 
and the average height is eighteen or twenty inches. Boys 
are usually a little taller and heavier than girls. The shock 
of entering this world and encountering its discomforts and 
difficulties generally causes the baby to lose three or four 
ounces in weight during the first week. This loss should be 
made up by the thriving infant within the next four to six 
days, though sometimes, owing to difficulties in nursing and 
other circumstances, the baby takes from ten to twenty 
days to regain its weight at birth. 
Care of the New-Born Infant 
The nurse or doctor will see to the cleansing of.the child’s 
eyes from mucus; and most physicians will order an anti- 
septic solution to be dropped into the baby’s eyes before 
anything else is done. This is a precaution against the op- 
thalmia that is sometimes contracted from infection of the 
eyes during birth, and which unfortunately so often used to 
result in blindness.
-P-A-G-E-23
  
THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD % 
Immediately after birth the nurse should rub the child’s 
body all over with vaseline or olive oil, weigh it (wrapped in 
a warm towel), then tuck it up in warmed crib blankets and 
lay it on its right side on a pillow in its crib or any safe place. 
The room should be very warm, and the use of a hot-water 
bag in the crib, beside the baby is sometimes recommended. 
There is no immediate hurry about doing anything else for 
the baby until the mother is looked after. Then comes its 
bath, for which the vaseline or oil is a preparation, making 
it easier to cleanse the skin from the substance which covers 
it at birth. 
The baby should be bathed in water that feels pleasantly 
warm to the back of the nurse’s wrist, or her bare elbow 
(this should equal 104° F. by the thermometer); and the 
body gently and carefully washed with a very soft cloth and 
fine castile soap, then patted dry with soft, absorbent old 
towels. A careful nurse will first warm these towels. The 
navel will then be dressed with a little pad of sterilized 
surgical gauze, with a hole in the middle to put the cord 
through, and over this pad, to hold it in place, the nurse will 
lightly wind around the child’s body a band half a yard 
long and six inches wide, made of fine flannel and unhemmed. 
The baby is then ready to be dressed. Neither pad nor band 
needs to be changed for a few days (5-10) until the cord 
falls off. The use of the band is recommended to be con- 
tinued at least until all redness has disappeared from around 
the navel. 
After the baby is dressed and the mother is rested the 
child should be put to the breast. If this cannot be done 
for some hours (6-8), and if the child is restless, the nurse 
may drop into its mouth from a medicine dropper a tea- 
spoonful or so of warm, unsweetened water. The mother’s 
milk for a day or two is of a different nature from the real 
nursing milk which flows later. It is known as colostrum, 
and no doubt serves some useful purpose, perhaps that of 
elimination of the child’s first stools. These are dark- 
colored, thick and viscous like tar. The term meconium is 
applied to these stools.  
-P-A-G-E-24
  8 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Regularity in nursing the infant is highly important. 
The child is of more consequence than anything else in the 
world, and nothing short of an earthquake should be per- 
mitted to interfere with the mother’s engagements with it. 
Dr. Holt recommends that while the colostrum is secreted 
the child should be nursed only once in six hours, lukewarm 
water to be given between times and from a dropper only, 
lest the greater ease of nursing from the bottle should dis- 
courage the baby from use of the breast. After the natural 
milk comes the child is fed in the daytime every three hours 
by the clock; the time to be counted from the beginning of 
one feeding to the beginning of the next. For the first three 
months the child may be fed once during the night. Some- 
times the physician will advise that a weakly baby be fed 
oftener, and more frequent nursing also promotes better 
secretion of milk when this is scanty. 
Time Allowed for Nursing 
An infant should never be hurried at its feedings. At 
least fifteen minutes, and not more than twenty, should be 
allowed for each nursing. If the flow of milk is too plenti- 
ful, or the child feeds too fast, the nipple ought to be re- 
moved from its mouth every now and then, or indigestion 
may result. The normally healthy baby should not be al- 
lowed to go to sleep while nursing, but it sometimes happens 
that a very weak little infant, exhausted by hard labor at 
the suction pump, for a few weeks will need forty winks in 
the middle of dinner. This indulgence is only for the deli- 
cate baby; for the strong one it is a bad habit. 
Diet of the Nursing Mother 
The diet of the nursing mother should be even more 
scrupulously looked after than it was before the baby came. 
It should be adapted to promote an abundant secretion of 
healthy milk, and to avoid constipation, indigestion, and 
flatulency. It should contain an abundance of milk — to 
this the mother should become an addict — also of cream
-P-A-G-E-25
THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD 3 
soups, nourishing broths, cocoa, thin gruels, etc. One of the 
old-fashioned gruels found by our foremothers to be potent 
in promoting a flow of milk is made as follows. 
Thin Gruel of Bran or Oatmeal 
Soak two cupfuls of common wheat bran overnight in 
two quarts of water. In the morning pound the bran thor- 
oughly with a wooden pestle or potato masher, using a 
pressing and grinding motion to get out all the soluble sub- 
stances, then strain the liquid and boil it. Use this freely 
either warm of cold as a beverage, with the addition of a 
little sugar or honey, and perhaps the juice of a lemon, a 
couple of oranges, or any desired fruit. Rolled oats may be 
used instead of bran, and better yet is the Scotch or Irish 
oatmeal. 
Besides the free use of water and the other liquids already 
suggested, especially milk and gruels, the nursing mother 
should have a liberal diet of simple dishes, including green 
vegetables, the subacid fruits in season, whole grains in 
breads and breakfast porridges, and a small to moderate 
amount of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. 
Lemonade and acid fruits, contrary to old belief, are not 
harmful to either mother or child if used in moderation. In- 
deed, they often act favorably by producing a laxative con- 
dition. But their use should be watched, and if these or 
any other foods show symptoms of disagreeing with the 
baby they should be tabooed. 
Foods Forbidden to the Nursing Mother 
Baked Beans. These often prove difficult to digest. 
Cabbage and coarser vegetables are apt to cause flatulency. 
Croquettes, hashes, and made dishes in general should be 
avoided. 
Fried foods of all kinds. 
Heavy puddings. 
Pastry, especially the richer kinds. 
Pickles. 
Pork.  
-P-A-G-E-26

and Brussels sprouts as upsetting to the baby. 
Vegetarian Diet 
Even if the mother professes the vegetarian creed she 
should abandon it during lactation. Watery milk and 
anzmic children are said to result from a mother’s diet of 
vegetables alone. 
Neither should an artificially fed infant be given food 
solely from vegetable sources. The young of the vertebre 
cannot be adequately nourished on vegetables alone, their 
digestive organs are best fitted for the animal proteins. All 
the mammals suckle their young, and even the grain-eating 
birds feed their hungry youngsters on worms and insects. 
Dr. Holt is quoted as saying: ‘Vegetable proteins are of 
distinctly lower grade in nutritive value than the animal 
proteins, and while they may be adequate for maintenance, 
it is hazardous to depend on them for growth.” (‘‘The 
Happy Baby,” edited by Dr. L. Emmett Holt, page 94). 
General Care of the Nursing Mother 
The nursing mother should be cared for as solicitously as 
she was before her child was born. Constipation ought 
especially to be guarded against, and the tendency overcome 
preferably by diet rather than medicine. Regular exercise, 
especially brisk, blood-circulating walking, as soon as the 
mother is strong enough for it, will also help. 
Disturbing emotions of grief or anxiety, anger, and the 
like, ought to be carefully avoided. The secretion of milk 
is often stopped by strong emotion, and a fit of convulsions 
in the baby has been known to follow a fit of anger in the 
mother. Such emotions act like poisons in the blood, alter- 
ing its reaction, and causing hurt to both mother and child. 
As recommended before the child’s birth, the mother 
should likewise at this time live much in the open air; she 
should enjoy natural scenery, as well as books, pictures, 
music; laughter and jokes, cheerful conversation and inter-
-P-A-G-E-27

THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD il 
course with friends. She should practice the fine art of 
keeping happy, of maintaining cheer and joy; and she should 
cultivate the flower of inward tranquillity and poise. This 
will marvellously react on the baby. 
Regular exercise is good for the nursing mother, and if 
taken out-of-doors so much the better. Walking and gar- 
dening are particularly good. The woman who does her 
own housework — or all but the heaviest part — who en- 
joys doing it, and who knows how to maintain a healthful 
posture during certain of its activities, will be the better for 
the work. It often happens that colic in the baby is caused 
by too little exercise on the part of the mother. 
Cool bathing, and rubbing of the body to promote cir- 
culation; sleep for at least eight hours; a rest hour on the 
couch or in the hammock every afternoon, and an early 
bedtime, all help to keep the mother well, and conse- 
quently favor the health of the child. 
Artificial Feeding of the Infant 
Sometimes a physician will find it advisable that the 
child shall be artificially fed. Sometimes circumstances 
make it necessary. It is always a misfortune, and before 
any mother chooses deliberately and without need to feed 
her child artificially, she should know that according to a 
recognized authority on this subject she reduces its chance of 
living to one in ten. Statistics of infant mortality show that 
most of the infants who die during the first six months are 
infants who have been artificially fed. 
If, of her own free will, the mother chooses to run this 
risk, let her do it with her eyes open, and in full knowledge 
of its probable consequences. 
Dr. Holt, whose book on the artificial feeding of children 
has run through twenty-eight editions, and has preserved 
the lives of many babies, — he, perhaps the greatest known 
specialist on artificial feeding, — declares repeatedly that 
there is no perfect substitute for mother’s milk, and that it 
is not possible exactly to imitate it. (“The Happy Baby,” 
pp. 38, 54, etc.).

Differences Between Woman’s Milk and Cow’s Milk 
1. Protein. The curd, or casein, which is the chief protein in 
milk, is present in almost three times the amount in cow’s milk. 
This, says a witty writer, is “because the calf has to build more 
beef than the baby.” Dilution with water brings down the pro- 
portion, but even this does not make good the difference, because 
the curd of cow’s milk is different in kind and composition from 
that of woman’s milk. 
2. Fat. There is a little more fat in woman’s milk than in the 
milk of the cow, but here again the worst difficulty cannot be over- 
come by making the proportion right, form woman’s milk the fat 
is of a different kind, and no way of imitating it is known. 
3. Sugar. Woman’s milk contains a great deal more sugar than 
cow’s, but though the two kinds are chemically identical, the milk 
sugar of commerce, when used in artificial feeding, is often found 
to disagree with a baby. 
4. Minerals. The minerals in cow’s milk are quantitatively 
more than three times more abundant than in woman’s milk, and 
there is a slight difference in their kind. 
5. Water. The proportion of water in each is practically the same. 
6. Freedom from Germs. Woman’s milk, sucked from the 
breast, is sterile; cow’s milk is hardly ever quite uncontaminated. 
7. Woman’s milk is alkaline in reaction, cow’s milk develops 
more or less lactic acid within a few hours after milking. 
Note on Certified Milk. When a child has to be artificially fed, the 
“certified”? milk, guaranteed to be freshly bottled after milking, handled 
and dealt with according to surgical cleanliness, and so free from germs 
that it does not need sterilization or pasteurization, thus giving the 
child the benefit of all its vital principles, — should be provided eyen 
at the cost of some sacrifice. It is one of the costly things that are wisely 
economical. 
In the rare cases where artificial feeding is necessary, the 
physician should be consulted, and no additions made to 
the diet he prescribes on the mistaken plea that “a wee 
taste of such-and-such will do the baby no harm,” or that 
“he cried for so-and-so,’ and the mother knew it must be 
good for him, he relished it so much. 
There are still too many mothers who do not understand 
why the restrictions of a child’s diet are imperative, and
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD 13 
who think the rules laid down are fussy and arbitrary. For 
their benefit the following section is inserted, to show that 
not doctor or nurse, but nature, calls for a diet for the child 
as different as that for the adult as the body of the child 
differs from that of the grown-up. 
Reasons for the Differences in the Feeding of Children and 
Adults 
The child’s body is smaller than that of the adult, conse- 
quently it needs less food than the adult. But though the 
actual amount of food needed by the child is smaller, the 
proportion of food to the size and weight of its body is very 
much larger, since the child is rapidly growing, and food is 
needed not only to repair waste but to build all the tissues. 
More protein food, in proportion to the carbohydrates 
and fats, is needed by the child than by the adult, since pro- 
tein is predominantly the building food. 
Small amounts of food are called for at each feeding, be- 
cause the stomach of the child is so very much smaller than 
that of the adult. At birth, the baby’s stomach has a capac- 
ity of one ounce, or two-level tablespoonfuls, or one-half of 
one eggshell. At the end of the first month it will hold two 
ounces, or a quarter-cupful; at the end of the second, a little 
more than three ounces or six tablespoonfuls; at the end of 
the third it will hold from four to five ounces or from one- 
half to five-eighths of a cupful. The small size of the stomach 
should be realized, since this calls for a small quantity at 
each feeding. One of the commonest ways to illtreat a 
baby is to overfeed it. 
Much more frequent feedings are required by the child 
than by the adult, for the child’s stomach digests so much 
more rapidly. In the case of the child, the digestion of a 
full feeding is performed in a little more than an hour, and 
its absorption is complete in two hours; while the adult 
digestion of a meal occupies from four hours up. Therefore 
the quick emptying of the child’s stomach necessitates fre- 
quent feeding. 
No starchy food should be given in early infancy because
-P-A-G-E-30
  14 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
the secretions which digest starch are yet undeveloped. The 
saliva is scanty, and in the early months may be said prac- 
tically to be lacking. In the intestine there is no starch- 
digesting juice to speak of until the child is three months 
old. All this points to the exclusion of starchy food until 
the first three months are past, and even then it may be 
given in only small quantity, for the starch-digesting power 
of the intestinal fluid is not fully developed until the end of 
the first year. 
Mineral salts are needed during the whole of the growing 
period, and particularly in infancy, for the child’s bony 
system is so incompletely developed. 
A preponderance of liquids is called for in the diet of the 
child, because the digestive tract is not so well fitted to deal 
with solid food, and the baby has no teeth to prepare such 
food for digestion — and also because the amount of the 
child’s blood, in proportion to the size of its body, is nearly 
one-third less than that of the adult. 
Rules for the Artificial Feeding of Infants Under One 
Week 
The following rules have been compiled by the American 
Medical Association for the artificial feeding of young in- 
fants for the first week. 
Beginning on the third day, the average baby should be given 
three ounces of milk daily, diluted with seven ounces of water. To 
this should be added one tablespoonful of limewater and two level 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. This should be given in seven feedings. 
Notes on the Use of Formulas 
The best general formula ever framed will not fit every individual 
baby. A formula for artificial feeding, says Dr. Holt, is ‘‘something 
in the nature of an experiment.” (‘‘The Happy Baby,” page 65). 
Changes in composition have to be made for babies of weak digestion, 
for those whose bowels are loose, or those whose bowels are consti- 
pated. Big, vigorous, hungry babies may need more food—so may 
fretful and crying ones — to make up energy lost. Some babies have 
to be more quickly promoted, and some more slowly, to the next 
formula. Artificial feeding is not an easy undertaking.

What the New-Born Baby Can Do 
The most noteworthy accomplishment of the baby at 
from ten minutes to two hours of age, is that it can swing 
suspended from a transverse bar like an athlete, gripping 
with its fists a slender rod or cane, and holding on for twenty 
or thirty seconds at a time. This has been demonstrated 
over and over, and while some infants are able thus to sus- 
pend themselves in the air for only a few seconds, and lose the 
power in a few minutes, others retain it for at least a couple 
of hours, and can hold on for a half-minute or longer. 
The baby can cry, it can sneeze, it can suck and swallow, 
cough, and choke without apparent discomfort, imme- 
diately after birth. It can kick, move its arms, open and 
shut its eyes. It is able to grip the finger of an adult, and 
convey with the pressure a quite mysterious and thrilling 
emotion. The grip, however, is like that of a little monkey, 
for it cannot yet oppose the thumb to the other fingers. 
Hiccoughing, yawning, and stretching, have also been ob- 
served shortly after birth, as well as the often crooked and 
one-sided smile that mothers rejoice in, but which we are 
cruelly told means nothing. That it does these and other 
things without purpose, intention, or will to perform them, 
is why the new-born baby is called by cold-hearted scientists, 
an automaton. In Miss Millicent Shinn’s book, “The Bio- 
graphy of a Baby,” she rightly agrees with the mother’s objec- 
tion to this name, if by automaton is meant only a machine. 
But she says the baby ‘‘is a living, conscious automaton, 
and that makes all the difference in the world.” 
Sensory Development in the New-Born 
A hundred years ago, more or less, we used to be taught 
that we had five senses: touch, taste, hearing, sight and 
smell. Psychologists now credit us with twice to three times 
five senses, but since there is far from uniform agreement 
among them as to their number and their kind, we shall here 
consider chiefly the plain, ordinary senses that unpsychologi- 
cal folk have always recognized.
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Touch or Feeling. That a baby can, on contact with the 
finger, administer a grasp, and close an eyelid if it is lightly 
touched; that it sucks something placed between its lips, 
and spreads its toes if the sole of the foot is gently stroked; 
that it shows awareness of heat and cold, of gentle patting 
and cuddling; of hunger, thirst, and pain; that it is sensi- 
tive to vibration; and is disturbed by sudden motions that 
seem to endanger equilibrium, shows that it is susceptible in 
some degree to many of the sensations that used to be 
grouped under the single heading of touch or feeling. 
Taste. Experiments to test the sense of taste in the new- 
born have shown that it exists, but it is not yet acute — at 
least most babies do not show they discriminate between 
what they later recognize to be pleasant and unpleasant 
flavors. 
Smell. Pretty much the same conclusions as to taste have 
been reached by most observers regarding the sense of smell 
in the new-born. Yet, there are well-established instances 
where babies of only a day or two old refused one kind of 
milk and accepted another, or refused the use of a rubber 
nipple until it was smeared with milk, thus showing sensi- 
tiveness to either taste ‘or smell. 
Hearing. It is pretty sure that the baby is deaf for at 
least some hours after birth, sometimes for from one to 
three or four days. This, because the walls of the auditory 
canal are often pressed together, and the middle ear is always 
filled with liquid. Consequently all the songs and cooings, 
sounds of welcome and expressions of love and admiration 
murmured to the newcomer are—so we learn — wasted 
on a stolid, indifferent little object. The rousing of the 
nerves of hearing is too often signified by a demonstration 
of fear — another evidence that this instinct is one of the 
first to appear — when a loud, harsh, or disagreeable sound 
will cause shrinking or trembling. 
Sight. Though the eyes of the infant are perfectly de- 
veloped at birth, its sight is supposed to be.dim and vague. 
It does not seem able to distinguish anything except light 
from darkness; strong light seems unpleasant, and gentle
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND CHILD 17 
light pleasing. Stories are told of babies under a week old 
who turned their heads (for they cannot yet turn their eyes) 
in the direction of the window, or of a lighted lamp, but the 
fixed, wide-open stare of the baby does not mean that it 
sees what it stares at, except as a mass of light or dark. It 
is not able to distinguish objects or to focus distance, and it 
has literally to learn to see.

THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 
1 
Tue First QUARTER OF THE First YEAR 
Food During the First Three Months 
As already stated in the first chapter, the mother who 
nurses her baby may be reasonably sure that she is giving 
it just the right kind of food for that particular baby — pro- 
vided she looks after her own diet and the care of herself 
as recommended on page 2 and following. If her milk is 
scanty at first she should use all possible means to increase 
it, and she should be encouraged by knowing that even a 
little breast milk is better than none. 
If the child has to be artificially fed, and to suffer the 
handicap of a counterfeit of its lawful diet, the physician 
should be consulted and asked to suggest a formula for 
such feeding. Let us repeat that no additions should be 
made to the diet he prescribes, and no alterations made in 
it, without his knowledge and consent. 
An example, however, of a formula for the diet of an in- 
fant of average weight and health, compiled by the American 
Medical Association, and quoted in the bulletin on Infant 
Care, published by the Children’s Bureau in Washington, is 
as follows: 
At one week the average child requires five ounces of cow’s milk 
daily, which should be diluted with ten ounces of water. To this 
should be added one and one-half level tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
and one ounce (two tablespoonfuls) of limewater. This should be 
given in seven feedings. 
The milk should be increased by one-half ounce (one tablespoon- 
ful) about every four days after the first week; and the water should 
be increased by one-half ounce (one tablespoonful) every eight days.

  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 19 
Signs that the Baby Needs More Food. Babies differ, even 
at less than three months of age, and if they whimper in a 
disappointed and dissatisfied manner after nursing, or if 
during the second or third month attempts are made to suck 
the thumb, or to get the fist into the mouth under the im- 
pression that it is edible, these may be taken as signs that 
more food is called for. 
Water Drinking. The baby often needs little drinks of 
water between meals. The water should be boiled and 
cooled, but never ice cold. For the young baby under three 
months it may be lukewarm. Give for the first month a 
tablespoonful at a time, from a dropper or a nursing bottle, 
and increase the quantity as the child grows older. The need 
for water-drinking will be greater in the second and third 
quarters. 
Frequency of Feedings. During the first three months, 
counting from the third day, the baby should be fed every 
three hours in the daytime — the time to be counted from 
the beginning of one feeding to the beginning of the next — 
and one feeding should be given in the night, making seven 
in all. Sometimes the physician will advise that a weakly 
baby shall be fed oftener — also, more frequent feeding will 
promote better secretion of milk when this is scanty. Regu- 
larity in nursing the infant is of the highest importance. 
The child is of more consequence than anything else in the 
world, and the mother should keep her engagements with it 
to the minute. She may plan the hours for meals at her 
convenience, but they should not during this quarter be less 
than three hours apart, and they may be more. 
Time Allowed. for Feeding. See instructions on page 8, 
which hold good for the first three months. + 
Feeding-Boitles and Nipples. Choose bottles of cylin- 
drical shape with wide mouths and long, sloping shoulders. 
They should hold a half-pint (eight ounces) each, and have 
the measurements in ounces blown in the glass. There 
should be a bottle for every feeding, and immediately after 
the feeding each bottle should be rinsed in cold, soft water, 
then filled with water mixed with a pinch of baking soda 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
until all the bottles for the day are empty, when they should 
be washed with hot soapsuds and the bottle brush rubbed 
all over them inside. After rinsing they should be filled with 
hot water and placed on a cloth in a dishpan, more hot water 
added to cover them, and boiled for ten minutes. The 
bottles may then be considered sterilized. 
The plain black rubber nipples that slip over the neck of 
the bottle are the best. When new, it is safe to boil them 
for five minutes to make sure they are sterile. Rinse them 
well after feeding, and keep in water softened with baking 
soda until time for the general bottle-washing, when they 
too should be washed with soap and water, inside out and 
all over. 
Nipples are perishable. The hole soon gets too large and 
this is not good for the baby. Keep testing them by turn- 
ing the bottle upside down when the feeding is in and the 
nipple is on, and if the milk comes out drop by drop the hole 
is about right. If it flows in a stream the baby may take his 
food too fast for digestion. 
Signs that the Food Agrees with the Child. Normal and 
regular bowel movements, normal temperature, steady 
gain in weight, freedom from colic, and that the child sleeps, 
or rests quietly after nursing, are among the signs that the 
food agrees with him. 
Most babies when feeding suck in air as well as milk, and 
Dr. Holt (“The Happy Baby,” page 50) recommends 
holding the child upright or over the shoulder of the 
mother or nurse until he belches up this wind. To get it 
up will prevent vomiting and will make the baby sleep 
better. 
Results of Improper Feeding. Fretfulness, abnormal 
vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, irregular or disturbed 
sleep, colic, and profuse sweating about the head, are among 
the signs that the food disagrees with the infant. 
Signs that the Baby is Thriving 
Weight and Height. After the infant has made up its loss 
of weight due to encountering the first difficulties of life on
-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 21 
earth, there should be a steady gain, averaging at least four 
ounces a week, and more should be expected from big, 
vigorous infants. The greatest increase in weight may be 
expected in the second month. At the end of three months, 
the child that weighed seven pounds at birth ought to weigh 
at least ten or twelve pounds. The baby ought to*be weighed 
once a week for the first three months. 
At the end of three months the baby ought to be at least 
three or four inches taller than at birth. (See Table, p. 56). 
How to Measure the Baby’s Height. Lay the child flat on a 
thick blanket spread on a table, and measure with a yard- 
stick from heels to head, using a light book or a thin piece of 
wood to get the right level, as is done when the child is old 
enough to stand on the floor. 
Sleep. During the first six months the little thing’s chief 
business in life is to eat and sleep, and an ideally proper baby 
will be awake in snatches for only from two to four hours out 
of the twenty-four during the first half-year. Therefore the 
sleeping allowance during this quarter will be from twenty 
to twenty-two hours a day. The baby should wake to nurse, 
go off to sleep immediately after, and not wake until time to 
nurse again. It has to keep awake for bathing and dressing, 
and for exercise of its lungs (see page 29), and some babies 
will lie awake for brief periods of reverie or contemplation, 
but the perfectly well and properly cared-for baby will not 
be restless, whimpering, or wakeful between times. 
Bowel Movements, After the first week the bowels should 
move two or three times a day, and twice a day during the 
second and third months. The stools should be soft and 
yellow, smooth, and free from lumps. 
Urination. The infant in the early months urinates about 
twice in an hour. 
. Freedom from Colic. The healthy, well-cared-for infant 
should not suffer from colic. That most of them do suffer, 
is no proof this is right and normal, all it proves is that in 
the care of most babies there is something wrong and ab- 
normal. The commonest cause of infantile colic is painful 
distention of the intestine due to gas from indigestion. Too 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  22 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
much protein, e. g., meat, eggs, etc., in the diet of the nurs- 
ing mother, or not enough fresh air and exercise, often causes 
colic in the child. It may also proceed from constipation, or 
from cold feet or chill to the little body. 
Temperature. The temperature after birth is usually 101° 
to 104° F.. From the second to the third day it may run 
from 101° F. to 106° F., and after this it should gradually 
drop to 99°-100° F., when taken in the anus. 
The temperature of an infant varies more according to 
whether it is taken in the anus, the mouth, or the armpit, 
than does the temperature of the adult, which varies no 
more than a single degree according to the place where it is 
taken. Also, a child’s temperature rises more quickly above 
normal and returns quicker to normal than does an adult’s, 
but any lowering from the normal in a child should be con- 
sidered serious. 1 
The Posterior Fontanelle, or soft place at the back of the 
infant’s skull where the bones do not join, should be closed 
at two months old. The anterior fontanelle, the big soft 
place on the crown of the head, will grow larger instead of 
smaller, but this means only that the child’s brain is grow- 
ing faster than the bones which enclose it. This big, top-of- 
the-head fontanelle is recognized by every mother; but that 
at the back is so inferior in size that the young mother often 
does not know it is there. 
The Baby’s Nursery, and Other Belongings 
The baby’s nursery should be the brightest, cheerfulest, 
sunniest room in the house. Its temperature for the first 
three months should be 70° F. in the daytime and 65° F. at 
night. Besides the usual heating apparatus, the ideal nursery 
will have an open fireplace, both for ventilation and cheer. 
The air should not be too dry, and the room should be kept 
so perfectly ventilated that on entering it, the air, to a sensi- 
tive nose, should be as fresh and sweet as the air out-of- 
doors. Needless to say the nursery should be away from street 
and other noises, and protected from kitchen or other smells. 
The baby’s crib should be large enough to allow for his
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 23 
growth up to at least two years old; it should be of the railed- 
in kind, with drop sides, it should have a firm spring, and 
be protected by thin curtains of wash material. The mat- 
tress should have a waterproof sheet laid on first, over this a 
couple of thicknesses of cotton blanket or old, soft, table 
felt, and then the sheet proper. The covers should be the 
lightest and softest procurable. One of our authorities says 
it is more healthful for the baby to learn to sleep without a 
pillow; that he will breathe more deeply and easily. If the 
mother prefers to use a pillow, it is better to have it stuffed 
with very soft hair, since feathers are often too heating for 
the little head, especially in warm weather. 
The nursery ought to be provided with a soft, thick rug, 
to place on the floor for the baby to roll about on as soon as 
he is able to roll. 
The baby pen or kiddie koop, which can be made by a 
handy father or bought ready-made, is so great a comfort to 
both mother and child that it should not be omitted from 
the furniture of the nursery. The pen should be portable, 
and easy to fold up and carry from one raom to another, or 
out-of-doors. i 
The baby’s high chair should have a tray for his toys, or 
for him to bang a spoon on by and by. 
The baby’s carriage should be a comfortably big one, 
with room for a pillow, a toy or two, and a baby in any posi- 
tion. Laid flat on a pillow in his carriage, the baby may be 
taken out during his third month of life, or allowed to sleep 
on the porch. The carriage should have good springs, but 
they should not be too hair-triggerish to cause sudden ups- 
‘and-downs in the baby’s life at the smallest provocation. 
The hood of the carriage should be lined with green or dull 
blue, solid color, and it should always be adjusted to shade 
the baby’s eyes. Also, a high carriage, raising the baby well 
above the dust, the heat or cold of the pavement, and mak- 
ing it easy for the mother to attend to him, is much to be 
preferred to one that lies low. Be sure the carriage is long 
enough to allow for growing. Too short a carriage causes 
defects of posture later. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
The gocart is generally disapproved. It is too close to 
the ground, and its limited size cramps the child and causes 
discomfort and a strain on his back. 
A folding screen to keep off draughts or too bright light, 
is another nursery essential. So is a low, comfortable seat 
for the mother while she bathes the baby. There should 
also be a bath thermometer, and a room thermometer. 
Some of the furnishings listed need not be provided for 
the first three months. The creeping-pen, the high chair, 
and even the carriage may be dispensed with for the first 
quarter of the first year, and a large basket or bassinet may 
be used instead of a crib. 
A record book for the mother to note the important ad- 
vances in the baby’s progress, such as weight, height, denti- 
tion, first demonstrations of intelligence, growth in sense 
perception, early achievements in walking and talking, is 
exceedingly useful and ought to be kept by every mother. 
General Care of the Infant During the First Three Months 
The Daily Bath. After the first bath following its birth, 
the baby should be sponged all over every day with a soft 
cloth (or sponge) wet with tepid water, while the infant lies 
on a large, soft towel spread over a piece of rubber sheeting 
laid on the nurse’s lap. This daily sponge should be con- 
tinued until the scar from the navel cord is healed. Then 
the daily tubbing may be begun, in a comfortably warm 
room, a little over 70° F., ‘and in water that feels neither 
warm nor cold to the elbow of the nurse, or the back of her 
hand, or that the thermometer tells her is 98° or 99° F. Very 
little soap is needed in the bath; the child’s delicate skin is 
sometimes irritated by even a slight excess. The head and 
face of the baby are washed and dried before it is undressed, 
then the clothing is removed, a soft washcloth, slightly 
soapy, is passed over the whole body, and the baby is lowered 
into the tub or basin, where it is washed free from every 
trace of soap. A towel may be used to lower it into the tub 
while the baby is very young or the mother is unaccustomed. 
Babies are naturally water babies, and ought to enjoy the
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 25 
bath if it is properly given, and if they are not frightened by 
a sudden plunge, or a temperature greater or less than that 
of their bodies. After the bath the child should be lifted 
out, wrapped in a soft, warm towel, and its skin patted dry. 
Then comes a time of great enjoyment for most infants, 
when the baby is laid face downward on a dry towel on the 
mother’s lap, while she rubs its backbone gently with the 
heel of her hand, and talks to it, coos to it, or sings to it dur- 
ing the gentle rubbing process. 
If the child’s skin shows signs of irritation, give up the 
use of soap and substitute a cheesecloth bag containing a 
cupful of bran, to squeeze in the bath water until it is cloudy, 
then wash and bathe the baby in this. 
A sparing use of lycopodium or a pure talcum powder is 
recommended for the creases of a baby’s body, the thighs, 
buttocks, and under the arms, but it should never be applied 
until the skin is dry, and then not over-abundantly. 
If the buttocks are red and irritated, this may be because 
the napkin is not changed immediately after it is wet; or it 
may be that the laundress does not rinse them thoroughly 
from soap; or it may be the child’s stools are acid. Olive oil 
is recommended instead of powder while there is redness or 
inflammation, and to expose the bare skin to air and sun- 
light without the intervention of glass is very good. If red- 
ness persists,'and is not the fault of the napkin, the physician 
should be told about it. 
The large, soft spot on the crown of the head is a fearsome 
thing for the first-time mother, and after the nurse goes she 
is often afraid to wash it, hence a dark crust forms which 
should have vaseline applied to it to soften before it is gently 
washed off with soap. The best thing for the mother is never 
to allow this crust or “cradle cap” to form. 
A baby should not be bathed within an hour after feeding. 
Aside from this, any time convenient to the mother will be 
all right — even the last thing before bedtime at night. 
The Baby’s Outings. When the baby is two weeks old, if 
the weather is mild and pleasant, he may be taken out for a 
little fifteen-minute excursion on a sheltered porch in the 
.
-P-A-G-E-42
  26 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
nurse’s arms, well wrapped up and eyes shaded from light. 
When the weather is not quite mild, or when the baby’s 
home is in a city of noisy streets, he may be given an indoor 
outing by wrapping him up as for out-of-doors and having 
the nurse take him for an airing in his nursery or any other 
room with windows wide open. After the first two or three 
weeks the daily outing should be a regular institution and 
its duration gradually increased, until at last the baby is 
out-of-doors most of the time. Fresh air, next to breast 
feeding, is the best thing any mother can give her child, and 
without it, even breast feeding will not ensure the best 
possible development. Delicate babies may be brought 
through a critical infancy by keeping them out-doors all 
day in pleasant weather, in a sheltered place, with careful 
watching to ensure that they keep warm. This last is very 
important. 
After six weeks old the baby may be taken out lying on a 
pillow in his carriage. The carriage ought not to stand in a 
cold, draughty hall while not in use, lest it may serve as a 
conductor of cold to the baby, and the pillow on which he is 
laid, the wraps that cover him, should likewise be stored in a 
warm room. 
Care of the Eyes. For the first month the nursery should 
be kept in half-light, with shades drawn half-way in the day- 
time, and not too brilliantly lighted in the evening. After 
this the baby’s back should be turned to the light from either 
window or lamp, and its eyes, which at this age are very 
tender, should not be allowed to face the window even when 
the sun is not shining, neither should they gaze up into the 
sky when out of doors. To permit direct sunlight to shine 
on the child’s face, or to fail to keep it shaded by the car- 
riage hood, is a too-common and greatly to be regretted form 
of maltreatment. 
Care of the Ears. The ears should be washed with a very 
soft cloth, and nothing except this soft cloth put inside them 
for gleansing. 
Care of the Mouth. More harm than good often results 
from the old-fashioned practice of washing or swabbing out
-P-A-G-E-43
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 27 
the baby’s mouth, and we are now advised not to do it. 
Nature looks out for the sterilization of the mouth of a 
healthy infant, and the grown-up finger should be kept out 
of it. 
Care of the Nose. A wee twist of soft cloth may be used to 
cleanse the nostrils. If there is running from them consult 
the physician. 
Protection from Excitement. Sudden transitions, rapid 
movements of the child, hurried snatching from its crib, 
dandling on the knee or in the arms, tossing it in the air, 
jumping up and down, shaking crib or carriage, should not 
be permitted. Such things interfere with the child’s normal 
development, they are bad for its nerves, and they induce 
bad habits. The brain is very delicate in structure at this 
time and is growing rapidly, it needs quiet for its best de- 
velopment. It is difficult enough for the baby to learn to 
accommodate itself to a world that, Professor James says, 
“presents itself to the child as one, big, buzzing, blooming 
confusion.” The strain of such accommodation should be 
minimized as much as possible, rather than increased. 
To play with her baby, especially when it is wide awake 
for a few minutes after feeding, is a strong temptation to the 
mother and one to be resisted not only on her own part, but 
also ill-advised play of the father with his child must be re- 
sisted, as well as play or the exciting attentions of visiting 
aunts, grandparents, or friends who know no better. This 
does not mean that the child may not be cuddled and loved 
by its mother, for quiet love is good for the baby, though 
over demonstrative love is not. 
At two months, or often earlier, the baby shows anger, 
fright, and surprise, which is a milder form of fright. The 
mother should now sedulously guard the child from every- 
thing that may stimulate the emotions of anger or fright, 
and she should know that they are unwholesome and very 
bad for the baby. 
Habit-Forming. The mother from the first should en- 
courage in the infant the habit of lying quietly in his crib, 
and not fretting to be taken up and held in the arms. Some   
 
-P-A-G-E-44
a ee ee ee 
28 . CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
babies are satisfied to lie quietly all day except at feeding 
times. Others will fret if some little attention is not now 
and then paid to them. Often, merely a change of position 
from one side to the other will pacify — the young mother 
should remember that to lie long in the same position is 
more irksome to some individuals than to others — and the 
baby is an individual from the start. She should recognize 
too that so young an infant does not whimper unless phys- 
ically uncomfortable, and some are very much more sensi- 
tive to this than others. Often she will have to seek for some 
trivial cause unthought of in her inexperience, as a wrinkle 
in an undergarment, a slight chafing or reddening of the 
tender skin, a wet napkin, excess of heat or cold, etc. The 
wrinkle should be smoothed out, the chafed place powdered, 
the napkin changed (a napkin should be changed the mo- 
ment it is wet, and not used again until after washing), 
perspiration watched for as a sign of heat, the feet and hands 
felt to make sure of enough warmth, and then the baby put 
down again. 
_ Regular habits should be formed from the first, of nursing, 
sleeping, bowel movements. All should take place on the 
dot in a healthy and well-cared-for baby, and the mother 
will find that it is very easy to develop in her child habits of 
quite edifying regularity. This will make it easier for her to 
care for the baby, and will be good for the baby in more ways 
than one— since regular habits are training in obedience. 
The importance of right care during the first three months 
is very great, and when at their close the baby is strong and 
vigorous the mother may well hope that half the battle of 
the first year is over. 
A Baby’s Oddities 
Vomiting. The baby has a funny little stomach, different 
from the grown-up’s not only in size, but also in shape, posi- 
tion, and other respects. It is little more than an enlarge- 
ment of the tube of the cesophagus, it is set more vertically 
than the adult’s, and its orifice at the cardiac or upper end 
opens quite easily. Consequently, if the baby has been han- 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 29 
dled or shaken after a meal, or if it has been a little glutton 
and fed too heartily, it vomits very readily, without nausea, 
and often with no sign of being a penny the worse for it. Ac- 
cording to Dr. Jacobi it is good for the child thus quickly to 
get rid of an excess of food, or of food it is not able to manage, 
rather than to “enter into long discussions with it” as adults 
have mostly to do. 
Crying. That the child spends most of its time eating 
and sleeping does not mean that there is a silent baby in the 
house. /As the little one grows stronger and learns the use 
of its lungs it will be very apt to bawl once in a while when 
it feels like it, for no particular reason except pastime. — 
Physicians tell us that this “making a noise’’ is good exer- 
cise for the lungs, it shows enterprise and vitality, and it is 
one of the rights of the baby to make itself heard in the 
house by a fine roar at the top of its voice. This cry is alto- 
gether different from the fretful whimper or uneasy cry of 
the child that is not well. The loud, noisy bawl is an idio- 
syncrasy of its time of life, it is nothing that need cause 
anxiety to the mother, and she may make up her mind to 
bear it for fifteen or twenty minutes during the day. 
Drooling or Driveling. Somewhere about the third month 
the baby will begin to flow at the mouth and drool all over 
his clean slip, calling for the bib as an addition to his ward- 
robe. This troublesome flowing means that the saliva now 
begins to be secreted — there was none to speak of before — 
and the baby, to whom the gift is a surprise, does not yet 
know what to do with it, and lets it flow out until he learns 
to swallow it. This flowing should be distinguished from 
that which comes later at teething time. 
Rapid Pulse, Circulation, and Breathing. If the young 
mother, studying the novelty of her first baby, should wonder 
(we have known some who were alarmed) at what seems its 
abnormal pulse, etc., it should relieve her to know that all 
operations in the little body take place at a high rate of 
speed. The pulse may beat 130 to 160 times in a minute 
up to the second month; the entire round of the circulation 
is completed in 12 seconds in a very young infant; and it will 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  
  30 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
breathe, soon after birth, 44 times in a minute, and at three 
months old, 35 times in a minute. 
The Baby’s Progress During the First Three Months 
Hearing, one of the backward senses at birth, soon begins 
to be developed, and loud, harsh, or disagreeable noises may 
cause shrinking or trembling. From all such the child 
should be solicitously guarded. But sweet sounds bring new 
pleasures into a child’s life, and in three or four weeks it will 
show delight in them, and at the end of a month the baby 
manifests pleasure at being softly talked to, sung to, cooed 
to. Some careful observers of babies think that the child 
first recognizes his mother through the sound of her voice 
rather than the sight of her face. A young baby in the first 
three months also shows decided pleasure in piano or other 
music. At two months or earlier he will turn his head to 
listen to it. 
Sight is also much more developed. The baby’s stare 
seems to mean something by the end of the first month; he 
can move his eyes and follow a moving object with them, 
but though he seems to look at things with interest, and after 
five weeks becomes able to perceive form, he cannot yet 
distinguish detail. From two months on he will show great 
pleasure in bright objects, especially if they glitter. 
Nothing certain may be stated about the baby’s sense of 
smell. Discomfort at a disagreeable odor in the room is 
shown early in infant life, yet, since the child does not know 
enough to inhale an odor through the nostrils, but will 
during later infancy either open its mouth to eat the sweet- 
scented flower or sniff out against it, the mother often thinks 
this sense is absent or undeveloped. One of our authorities, 
observing the child’s sensitiveness to the odor of the rubber 
nipple, and of breast milk, goes so far as to say the baby’s 
sense of smell is as keen as that of a little animal. 
- Taste is another matter of uncertainty. ilhelm Preyer 
thought his child could taste things when only a week old. 
Miss Shinn, an equally careful observer, sets six weeks old 
as the earliest age when her little niece showed discrimina- 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
       THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 31 
tion between one flavor and another. Many mothers find 
their babies making grimaces of high disgust during the 
first month if a wee pinch of salt is put into their mouths, 
but they make the same faces at a pinch of sugar, and we 
are told it is only because they are surprised at an unusual 
sensation, and this has affected the face muscles. 
The group of senses that plain, unpsychological persons 
include in the word “touch,” develop rapidly. Looking on 
from the outside as we do, we only know that the baby en- 
joys having his back rubbed after his bath; that certain 
forms of patting and petting and holding in arms give satis- © 
faction; that the lips, the tongue and the finger-tips all give 
evidence of pleasure in new contacts and go around seeking 
for them. 
Some time during the third month the mother may expect 
to find her baby opposing the thumb to the other fingers, 
and giving up by degrees the “monkey-grasp”’ of earlier 
life. 
Other marks of development during the first three months 
of life are as follows: 
At a month old the baby knows the difference between 
being left all alone to his own resources, and having an at- 
tentive and entertaining somebody to talk and coo to him 
when he is awake. Also, he shows a decided preference for 
being held in arms or lap and cuddled, rather than laid on a 
couch. 
At one month old the baby can weep real tears. 
From one month on, Miss Shinn writes of her niece “the 
baby, when crying with hunger, would hush as soon as she 
was taken in the arms in the position usual for nursing.” 
This, we are told, is not memory, only a working of the law 
of association. 
Also at a month old the baby can turn his head on his 
neck when lying down, has been known to attempt to prop 
his body with his knees in the bath, and when held in his 
mother’s arms to lift his head from the support of her 
shoulder, and hold it on his neck without wobbling while 
she counted ten slowly.    
-P-A-G-E-48
      32. CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
At six weeks old Miss Shinn’s niece could hold her head up 
for a quarter of a minute. 
After six weeks the baby may begin to make his first 
sounds, such as ‘‘Goo,” “Guh,”’ “Oh, guh!” “Google-guh,” 
and similar utterances, when he is pleased with things in 
general and finds life especially good. A baby of our ac- 
quaintance used to repeat his whole vocabulary of sounds 
over and over, sway his body and show all symptoms of 
delight, while gazing at a softly shaded lamp at the age of 
seven weeks. 
The baby from birth is able to kick, but from two months 
old he will be found to kick with a difference; purposefully, 
pushing his feet against the pillow, against his mother’s 
hand, or—like Miss Shinn’s niece — against the bath- 
tub. 
At two months old, many a mother claims that her baby 
knows her, but his ability to recognize her at this age is not 
unanimously granted by writers and observers who are not 
mothers of babies. 
A two-months baby, held in the arms and interested in 
looking at something attractive, will, if moved so that his 
back is to it, turn his head as far round as it will go, to keep 
the desired object in sight. Here is one of the early evidences 
of will. 
At ten weeks old, often before, the child shows conscious- 
ness of new surroundings, new persons, strange things. He 
shows dislike and aversion by turning his head away from 
persons and things that do not please him. 
At three months old the baby can laugh a real giggle, he 
can pull his mother’s hair, oppose his thumb to his other 
fingers, he can grasp — or will try to — and can put things 
in his mouth. He learns to do this by first holding something 
and putting his mouth down to it. 
Also, at three months old he can suck his thumb and must 
not be allowed to form the habit. 
During the third month the child will make repeated at- 
tempts to hold up his head and back, but complete success 
may not be achieved by every baby. A forward child may

THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 33 
sit up straight and hold his head without wobbling at the 
age of ten weeks, another baby may not reach this point for 
a month or so longer. 
At the end of the first quarter the baby will probably 
recognize its mother, nurse, or the one with whom it has 
close association. 
Nors.— The baby that is born with hair on its head, usually loses 
this first crop within the first month or six weeks, and the new hair 
should be covering the skull by the end of the third month. 
2 
Tuer SECOND QUARTER OF THE First é*; 
Foods and Feeding & ; 
When the child is breast-fed the increased amount of food 
should normally be provided by nature according to the 
child’s need of a larger ration. For the child who is artifi- 
cially fed the following rules have been issued by the Ameri- 
can Medical Association, and are quoted from Bulletin 
No. 2 of the Children’s Bureau. 
At three months the average child requires sixteen ounces (one 
pint) of milk daily, which should be diluted with sixteen ounces 
of water. To this should be added three (level) tablespoonfuls of 
sugar and two ounces of limewater. This should be given in six 
feedings. 
The milk should be increased by one-half ounce (one table- 
spoonful) every six days. The water should be reduced by one- 
half ounce every two weeks. At three months, sometimes earlier, 
a weak barley water may be used to dilute the milk instead of plain 
water; it is made of one-half level tablespoonful of barley flour to 
sixteen ounces (one pint) of water, and is cooked for twenty minutes. 
Until the end of the fourth month the number of feedings 
may remain the same as in the first quarter, that is, six 
nursings in the daytime at intervals of three hours each, 
counting from the beginning of one feeding to the beginning 
of the next, and one feeding during the night. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
34 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
  Beginning with the fifth month the night feeding may be 
omitted, and after the ten o’clock nursing the child should 
sleep without waking until six or seven o’clock the next 
morning. 
Other physicians recommend a slightly different formula 
for the food; after the end of the third month they advise 
the omission of the night feeding, and an interval of 
four hours between the daytime nursings. Sometimes the 
baby’s night feeding may be omitted at the beginning of 
the third month. ‘Babies differ, so do physicians, and the 
mother will do,well to be guided by the advice of her own 
doctor. wh 
, soonas the interval between feedings is lengthened to 
four rs the baby should be given little drinks of water 
betweeh mea] ree or four times a day. From two to four 
tablespoonfulSof water, according to the warmth of the 
weather, to the age of the child, and its desire for a drink, 
should be given from the nursing bottle, after boiling and 
cooling the water. For an infant under three months the 
water may be lukewarm, it should never be ice cold. 
Neglect to provide for a baby’s thirst is a common fault, 
and very often when the child cries because it wants a drink 
the mistaken mother thinks it is hungry. She should know 
_ that the baby needs a great deal of water, both because it 
has nearly one-third less water proportionately in its body 
composition than an adult, and also because it loses pro- 
portionately much more, through frequent urination. 
The older each baby grows the more it will differ from 
every other baby, and the more its own little characteristics 
will have to be allowed for. Some infants, like some adults, 
seem to thrive on a smaller quantity of food than others — 
some need more. It is rare that for the first six months of 
life the normal child of a healthy mother needs more food 
than that furnished by her own breast, nevertheless, even 
this sometimes happens, and if the baby shows signs that 
he has not had enough to eat (see page 19) the mother should 
report the matter to her physician. The addition of a bottle 
feeding or two if she nurses her baby, an increase in the
-P-A-G-E-51
  
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 35 
ration, or the addition of a different kind of food if it is 
artificially fed, may possibly be called for. 
Foods Other Than Milk Allowed During Second Quarter 
Barley Water. The barley water recommended on page 33 
is made by blending one-half (level) tablespoonful of barley 
flour with a tablespoonful of cold water, and stirring this 
into a pint of boiling water, with the addition of one-fourth 
teaspoonful of salt. Boil directly over the fire for twenty 
minutes, or cook in a double boiler for an hour. 
Between five and six months, if the baby is weak and deli- 
cate, it may, with the sanction of the physician, be given one 
teaspoonful of beef juice, diluted with one tablespoonful of 
water, through a nursing bottle about a quarter of an hour 
before the noon meal. If the baby is bottle-fed the beef 
juice may be mixed with the prepared feeding the last thing 
before it is given to the child. A good way to make this beef 
juice is as follows: 
Beef Juice. Sear quickly in a broiler over a clear fire, or 
on a very hot, ungreased pan, one ounce or less of lean beef. 
A little square of round steak cut an inch thick is very good. 
The beef should be heated only enough to cause it to puff 
up very slightly, thus swelling the connective tissue and 
making it easier to rupture to let out the juice. To do this, 
press the meat in a lemon squeezer, or better, in a meat 
press. The juice should be red; if the meat is cooked too 
much the albumen of the juice will be coagulated and the 
color changed. 
The spoonful of beef juice has no food value to speak of, 
but it is a tonic and stimulating to the baby, and helps him 
to get the most good from his milk, which is his true nour- 
ishment. 
If the baby is constipated, or if he is artificially fed, he 
may be given a little fruit juice by the fifth month — some- 
times earlier. One teaspoonful of orange juice, strained 
through cheesecloth to get rid of every particle of fibre, 
then diluted with an equal volume of water that has been 
boiled and slightly cooled, may be given an hour before one
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
of the morning feedings. The quantity may be increased at 
the rate of one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful a week. 
Patent or proprietary foods should not be used by the 
mother without the physician’s advice. They are as a whole 
characterized by excess of carbohydrates, often insoluble; 
by deficiency of the fats needed by the baby; and by the 
presence of proteins of vegetable origin. They are conse- 
quently inferior to properly modified cow’s milk; are some- 
times harmful to an individual baby, and should be used 
only when sanctioned by a physician. 
Signs that the Baby Is Thriving 
The signs that the baby is thriving are in general the same 
for the second quarter as those for the first three months, 
viz.: 
Weight and Height. In a breast-fed infant gain in weight 
is the surest sign of health. Where the child is otherwise 
fed, especially where patent or proprietary foods are used, 
a baby may fatten up, thus increasing in weight, without 
being in normal health, firm-fleshed, alert, and vigorous. 
The baby ought now to gain an average of one and one- 
fourth pounds a month; and at the end of the sixth month 
it should at least have doubled the weight at birth. All 
through the second quarter the baby should be weighed 
every week. 
At six months old a boy baby may be expected to be be- 
tween twenty-six and twenty-seven inches long; and a girl, 
between twenty-five and twenty-six. However, even at 
this early age, the influence of race, family predisposition, 
climate and sometimes season, have to be allowed for; and 
a variation of a pound or two in weight or an inch or two in 
height may be compatible with healthy growth. | (See 
Table, p. 56). 
Sleep. As in the first three months, most of the infant’s 
time should be spent in sleep, and when awake it ought to 
rest quietly and happily. An infant under six months ought 
to sleep from eighteen to twenty hours in the twenty-four. 
The anterior fontanelle — that big, soft spot on the top
-P-A-G-E-53
  
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 37 
of the baby’s head, will keep growing larger up to six months 
old. (See page 22). 
After three months the healthy, well cared-for infant 
should not suffer from colic, even if he has mistakenly been 
allowed to experience a few colicky pains during his first 
quarter of a year. 
Bowel movements, urination, and temperature should be 
normal. 
General Care of the Infant During the Second Quarter 
The Baby’s Beauty Sleep. After the night feeding is 
omitted lively and spirited babies are apt to wake up early 
and demand breakfast as soon as their eyes are open. Cer- 
tain mothers, not in sympathy with this desire, frustrate it 
by keeping the child awake as late as possible in the evening, 
thus ensuring for themselves a longer morning nap. This is 
to be reprehended, for the baby needs his beauty sleep, and 
everybody knows that the hours before midnight are the 
only beauty-sleep hours. 
In demonstration of this fact a physician once threw on 
the lantern screen several highly magnified pictures of nerve 
cells. The well-fed, thoroughly refreshed and rested nerve 
cell was as plump as a wee balloon; but after a few hours of 
work and wakefulness wrinkles began to appear, and the 
longer these conditions continued the more flaccid became 
the cell, until when excessively prolonged it shrivelled and 
collapsed quite badly, as if all its contents were depleted. 
“When this point is reached,” said the doctor, “or even 
nearly approached, an ordinary night’s sleep is not enough 
to restore completely the reserves the cell has lost; it will 
next day more quickly lose its plumpness, and so on.’”’ He 
further remarked that sleep during the hours before mid- 
night restores the nerves more effectively than sleep for the 
same number of hours after midnight. 
It is hardly too much to say that beauty is largely a 
matter of nerves. The mother should think of this with re- 
gard to her baby — and she might also think of it with re- 
gard to herself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
38 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
The Daily Bath. The temperature of the daily bath should 
be gradually lowered to 95° F. during the second quarter. 
In one of Dr. Holt’s last papers he recommends even a lower 
temperature, but says the bath should be given in a warm 
room and if possible before an open fire. The baby’s body 
should always be dried by patting with soft, absorbent 
cloths rather than by friction. Use powder as before, and if 
the baby has fattened up be sure the powder goes into all 
the creases in neck and legs, under the arms, between the 
buttocks, and everywhere there is likely to be friction. 
The Daily Outing. In all except the worst kind of weather 
the baby should now have an extended daily outing. Pro- 
vided he is protected from cold, from sharp winds, that his 
extremities are kept warm and his eyes shaded from the 
light, the more the baby is in the open air the healthier he 
will be in the present, and the more reserves of health will be 
laid up for the future. Let him sleep on the porch in his crib, 
or lying in his carriage, or on a rug, or in a hammock — being 
sure that the hammock lets him lie straight and not with his 
spine curved. 
Temperature of Nursery. After the first three months the 
nursery in the daytime should not be warmer than 70° F., 
and at night not more than 55° to 60° F. Some authorities 
recommend a daytime temperature of not more than 65° F. 
after the first three months, and that the nursery windows 
shall be opened at night except in zero weather, provided 
the child is gradually accustomed to this. The baby brought 
up in cool, well-ventilated rooms should have a better ap- 
petite, make a better gain in weight, and be less apt to take 
cold. 
Use of Vessel for Stool. At shortly after three months, or 
as soon as the baby can sit erect for a short time, the mother 
should accustom it to using a vessel for stool. At the hour 
for the child’s movement she should place a small warmed 
commode (an old-fashioned cuspidor is recommended) on 
her lap between her knees, and place the baby comfortably 
upon it, facing forward, his back supported by her hands, 
and wait a little while for the movement, talking or cooing

    THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 39 
to the infant in the meantime. This habit can be formed 
very soon if the mother is patient and careful at first. 
The High Chair. Many mothers place their babies in the 
high chair too soon. Not until the baby can sit erect should 
he be subjected to such a strain on his back, and then he 
should be made comfortable with pillows, and not allowed 
to sit up too long at a time, nor ever to sleep in this position. 
After the middle of the second quarter the baby will enjoy 
sitting in his chair for periods of twenty minutes or more, 
and will learn to play with simple toys placed on the tray. 
The grandma of the baby Miss Shinn so delightfully 
writes about, put on the tray of her high chair, when the 
little girl was only three months old, “several handy objects 
—a rattle, a ring, and string of spools.” She saw the ap- 
proach of the power of grasping. ‘Miss Shinn thinks it is 
wise to be thus forehanded in providing’ for needs and powers 
to come, and she thinks a good deal of the fretting of small 
babies is due to their being able to do things and having 
nothing to do them with. 
The Flannel Binder or Band. Some advanced mothers 
dispense with the band within a month after birth, and it is 
comforting to conservative ones to find such a high authority 
as Dr. Holt advocating its use until the child is three months 
old, and not leaving it off even then unless the baby is fat 
and robust. He says the band is needed both for support 
- and protection of the abdominal muscles, and is a safeguard 
against rupture. He advises its use for seven or eight 
months in the case of a delicate baby. A knitted band may 
be substituted for the strip of flannel. 
Short Frocks. The time to short-frock the baby is again 
shown by the baby being able to sit erect. Some mothers 
think this is also the time to put on shoes and stockings, but 
if the climate is warm and the weather pleasant it is better 
for the baby to remain unshod until walking time. 
Vaccination. The time recommended as best for the 
baby’s vaccination, if this is not objected to by the parents, 
is when the child is about six months old. It will then be 
over and done with before teething troubles begin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
The Creeping-Pen, or Kiddie Koop. The baby in the 
fourth or fifth month may be placed on a thick, soft rug 
inside the pen, and will learn to do a whole lot of things all 
by himself in this protected little enclosure, which has been 
called ‘‘one of the happiest devices ever thought of for the 
baby’s well-being.” He is free from the confinement of the 
high chair or the carriage, and this safe little enclosure 
seems to be tranquillizing, as shutting out the bigness and 
confusion and tax on the attention and understanding of 
the great, wide world. Inside the kiddie koop and with one 
toy, many babies delight in long periods of by-themselves- 
ness, alternating with social times with parents or other 
babies. In the pen during this quarter the baby will learn 
much about his body and will discover its new powers. He 
will probably learn to roll, later to creep, and during the 
* next quarter to stand while holding on to the railings (which 
should be smooth); later to toddle on his rug, and to under- 
take walking tours within its safe limits, encouraged by the 
protection of its fence. 
Keeping the Baby Quiet. To be quiet and contented is 
natural for a well baby at this age, and it is better that the 
child under six months old should be trained to lie quietly 
in crib or carriage, or roll about in kiddie koop, and not to 
whimper to be taken up and dandled and given an over- 
stimulating social time. His physical comfort should be 
looked after as in the first quarter, position changed until 
he is able to change it, his body powdered if there is chafing, 
a drink of water offered now and then from the nursing 
bottle, and both perspiration and cold extremities pre- 
vented. Yet, with all the care the mother can give, some 
babies will insist on being taken up in laps, to sit erect and 
see the world and all that is going on. They will not be 
happy without human companionship and attention, while 
other babies of the same family are quite happy when left 
alone. The mother quickly learns that no two infants can 
be treated in exactly the same fashion. Many general rules 
— such as this excellent one of training the child to be happy 
and self-sufficient by himself — should be considered more 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 41 
or less flexible, and if a strong-willed baby should unmis- 
takably indicate his intolerance of them, such concessions 
may be made on demand as will not transgress rules of 
hygiene, or form bad habits. A child at this age should not 
be allowed to cry for very long at a time if he wants to be 
taken up, for such a strain is bad for a baby, but most in- 
fants will yield to persuasion and the influence of habit, and 
learn to be happy without overmuch attention. On no ac- 
count should the baby be over-played with, or excessively 
cuddled, or passed around too much to too many people. 
Protection from Unwholesome Conditions and Emotions. 
Loud and startling noises, sudden transitions of all kinds, 
jolts of the baby carriage, too rapid trundling of the same, 
and all conditions that may produce fear should be avoided 
with the greatest care. Also, the child from four months on 
should be guarded from the fits of anger and rage that are 
often shown by a strong-willed baby. The mother should 
watch for these when they threaten, and sidetrack them by 
some distraction. A child at this age may be lovingly 
trained to control anger and impatience, should be kept 
away from temptation to yield to them, and when they 
appear imminent should have pleasing distractions supplied. 
Music is one of the best — a few chords on the piano will do 
wonders in soothing an angry infant. The mother should 
set herself not to permit the habit-furrows of anger to be 
formed in the brain, thus making the path easier for them 
the next time. 
At as early an age as the fourth month a child has further 
been found to show disturbance and anxious jealousy at 
being ignored while another child, or an animal, was petted 
and noticed. Some young mothers are unwise enough to 
wish to display how easily the child’s jealousy is aroused, 
and how it appears to covet the mother’s attention. Such 
a display is evidence of nothing but the ignorance of the 
mother and her thoughtless cruelty. Jealousy is one of the 
most unwholesome and injurious emotions to which a baby 
may be subjected. 
One of the most essential factors in the care of the child
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
at this age is that affection and love shall be displayed toward 
it. The nearer the sixth month approaches the more the 
baby will show his preference and love, and the more he will 
respond to love. Miss Maud Royden says that the love of 
the mother is more necessary to the child than the minis- 
trations of the most highly-trained nurse and the environ- 
ment of the most hygienic hospital. The baby needs a 
petting party two or three times a day, and one of our au- 
thorities goes so far as to say that the reason babies in an 
orphanage or foundling asylum die, is because they do not 
get it. 
Once more may the importance of regular habits be em- 
phasized. If the child who is normal and healthy has been 
accustomed from birth to being fed on the stroke of the 
clock, he will wake up at the right time for his meals. He 
will go to sleep at night at the same hour, and waken in the 
morning on schedule time. He will evacuate the bowel at 
the same time every day, and once this habit is established 
it will be a safeguard against constipation. Good habits 
make the care of her baby easier for the mother, and will 
immensely benefit the child. 
The Baby’s Progress During the Second Quarter 
It is a pity that anyone except the baby’s own mother 
should be the first to note from day to day the early demon- 
strations of intelligence, the first achievements in muscular 
‘control. Hence, the mother who takes sole care of her baby 
will have full measure of delight in observing the develop- 
ment of a new little individual. 
Again the word “individual” is used with intention, for 
often a woman has to be many times a mother before she 
ceases to be surprised at the amazing difference between 
one baby and another in mental development and physical 
progress. Consequently — again to repeat a former state- 
ment — the estimate of times and seasons when the child 
can do this, that, and the other thing, is useful only as fur- 
nishing the basis for a guess. 
Development of Hearing. All through the first year the
-P-A-G-E-59
       THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 43 
child’s hearing means more to it than its sight. Wilhelm 
Preyer, who so carefully studied his baby, thinks that the 
child learns more through hearing, and gets more pleasure 
from it in the first year, than from seeing. Between the 
fourth and fifth month the baby will show unmistakable 
pleasure in music, and will love to have his mother sing to 
him. It is told of Caruso, the famous tenor, that he de- 
liberately set out to begin the musical education of his little 
daughter Gloria when the infant was four months old, by 
softly singing to her the Neapolitan songs with which he had 
himself been lulled to sleep when a baby. Many an Ameri- 
can mother, without deliberate intent but highly efficaciously, 
begins her child’s education in music long before the child is 
four months old, by, like Caruso, singing to it simple and 
tuneful melodies. 
In the second quarter the baby will probably show en- 
joyment of the ticking of a watch when this is held to 
his ear, and a small girl of our intimate acquaintance 
used to laugh aloud with delight at a murmured, semi- 
confidential, and long continued talk addressed to her by her 
father. 
Sight. The child is now believed to distinguish color to 
some extent, in addition to his awareness of light and shade 
and glittering objects. Mr. James Sully, in his “Studies of 
Childhood,” relates how his baby seemed doubtful that his 
mother was indeed his mother on the morning that she wore 
a red jacket he had never seen before, and he had to stare 
hard at her face before he was satisfied that it was she. In 
Miss Shinn’s “Biography of a Baby”’ she tells that her little 
niece, in the fourth |month, cried at the sight of a caller 
who was dressed in black, and two days later showed 
decided fear of the dark. The baby during this quarter 
loves to be held erect to see the sights and enjoy the passing 
show. 
Smell. How far developed is the sense of smell is still a 
matter of uncertainty and disagreement among our authori- 
ties. It may be that there are more marked differences 
among babies in the keenness of this sense at this age—it may 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
   44 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS      
    
       
   
                          be that less attention has been given it by observers of 
babies. Nobody seems to know for certain, and experts 
disagree. 
Taste. Authorities are generally agreed that the sense of 
taste is now rapidly developing, and the baby is able to show 
what he likes and does not like in the matter of food and 
flavor. This is the time to caution the mother not to give 
her baby a little taste of something merely because he enjoys 
it. Let him enjoy only what is right and good for him at this 
age, and let him remain in ignorance of forbidden delights. 
Touch. During the second quarter of his first year the 
baby will begin to take the initiative in touch-experiments, 
in getting acquainted with sensations, in learning how things 
feel. The little hands go “fumbling over things,” the baby 
loves to push and pull and handle objects within its reach. 
Miss Shinn calls the fifth month “the era of handling things,” 
and finds that ‘‘to lay hold on things was the dominant 
motive of her (niece’s) life.” 
Other developments are as follows: 
Holds Head Up. From the fourth month on, the baby 
learns to support on its neck the little head which at first 
used to wobble so helplessly, and will soon be found turning 
it easily and naturally in the direction of sounds and sights 
that interest him. 
Holds Body Up. Towards the close of the second quarter 
the baby will very likely be able to sit up in his carriage, 
his high chair, or his mother’s arms, with a stiff and unsup- 
ported back. But pillows should always be behind the little 
back, to prop it up and rest it. 
Uses Hands and Arms. From the fifth month on, the 
baby will learn to reach for objects reported attractive by 
the eye, to lay hold of them, show delight in their possession. 
This is the time to begin to teach, to some extent, the use 
of both hands. Much has been said for and against am- 
bidexterity, but at present it seems to be generally admitted 
that training in the use of both hands makes for symmetry 
of body and brain. 
Recognizes Parents. 
            
        
         
      
         
           The child during the fourth month     
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 45 
should unquestionably show recognition of the mother, 
father, nurse, and others with whom he has daily association. 
He should recognize their voices, also their faces, and he may 
be expected to hold out his arms to be taken into those of 
his friends. 
Makes Varied Utterances. Besides the “Goo” and “Guh” 
of his first quarter, the baby now originates a great variety 
of sounds. He loves to make new ones, and when awake and 
by himself in carriage, crib, or kiddie koop he will delight in 
uttering a succession of the new googles in a happy and con- 
tented recitativo. 
Plays with Feet and Toes. Miss Shinn thinks that to play 
with his own feet is a more important advance than most 
persons recognize. The child under six months is not yet 
sure of the difference between what is and is not his own 
body. To play with his feet and to try to get his toes into 
his mouth (as babies so often do with astonishing success) 
helps, Miss Shinn thinks, in “the control of feet and legs 
and the recognition of them as parts of himself.” Another 
good reason not to put shoes and stockings on the child too 
soon. 
Remembers Things. Whether or not our strict scientists 
permit us to call it memory, the baby in the second quarter 
will show that he expects different reactions from different 
persons and different things. From the one who has always 
taken flattering notice of him, cooed or whistled to him, 
played with him, he will demonstrate confidence that such 
entertainment will be repeated. If, accidentally, he makes 
a delightful splash in his bath one day, he repeats it the 
next. If he is allowed to touch something hot and hurts his 
hand, he will avoid touching the thing that hurt him for a 
long time after. 
Loves His Parents. Further, whether or not our cold- 
blooded scientists acknowledge that the baby at this age is 
capable of love, we find him acting with high success the 
part of alover. The eager, outstretched arms to his mother, 
the affectionate cuddling into them when taken, is, we are 
told, not love, but some scientific-sounding substitute for  
-P-A-G-E-62
  46 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
it, just as memory is nothing but ‘‘association of ideas.” 
Yet, every father and mother who has won the love of 
their baby knows better than to think it does not care for 
them and remember them. A wee lady of our acquaintance, 
at the age of four and one-half months, separated for a 
vacation in the country from the young father who was 
devoted to her, was taken to the train to meet him on his 
arrival, six weeks later. The moment she saw him, though 
overcoated and hatted, advance towards her, her whole 
small body squirmed and wiggled with delight, her arms 
_were outstretched towards him, and she made little noises 
of joy. Is it likely that all the scientists in the world could 
make him believe that his Marguerite did not remember him 
and love him? 
Mother and Baby Games 
To play with the baby under five months old is strictly 
forbidden, yet a gentle rocking in the arms, or rolling over 
and over of the baby on the bed or on a thick rug on the 
floor, talking, singing, or cooing to it at the same time, are 
harmless forms of daily frolic from four or five months on. 
The infant that is let go entirely without personal notice 
does not develop so quickly intellectually. However, if the 
baby is delicate or sensitive to excitement, it will be safer 
to let it alone, and on no account should a child be played 
with before its evening bedtime. 
A game is distinguished from play: first, by the presence 
of an obstacle to be overcome, such as a problem to be 
solved or a contest to be won; and second, by having or- 
ganized rules for the players. The first game between 
mother and baby may be played as soon as the baby is old 
enough to initiate it and take his part — this should surely 
be about the fifth month, it may be before. The child some 
day will press his foot against the palm of his mother’s hand 
and push against it. The mother will push her hand gently 
up, he will push his foot more decisively down, and when she 
pushes insidiously up, will press ever more vigorously down, 
and thus it may go on alternate feet — the mother always
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 47 
offering just enough resistance to be overcome by the thrust 
of the little limb when the baby pushes against it with a 
gurgle of delight — for in this contest of strength the baby 
is always allowed to win. This is “mother play” in one of 
its earliest forms. It has in it the game elements — the ob- 
stacle, the contest of strength, and the unwritten rule that 
the mother shall not push too hard. 
The mother plays this game, instinctively knowing the 
value of the stimulus of opposition — a stimulus that goes 
with us all through life, and that Miss or Master Baby 
quickly responds to. 
As soon as the baby is old enough to laugh at what he 
thinks fun, there is another game, laughter-provoking, that 
may be played with the child by the mother. This is, 
lightly to drop a soft handkerchief over the baby’s face, 
and then quickly to pull it off and coo to him. When 
the baby gets used to this he thinks it the greatest fun 
in the world and will laugh and kick with all-over pleasure 
in it. 
Playthings for the Baby from Three to Six Months Old 
As soon as he can grasp it —or attempt to grasp it — 
the baby may be given the traditional coral and bells, prop- 
erly fashioned, that is, smooth and without curlicues and 
corners, and with the bells so placed that they cannot be 
pulled off and swallowed. This is a good toy for the baby 
at an age when he loves sweet sounds, and it will later tide 
him over the coming of the teeth. Pray do not give the child 
a noisy rattle, lest he may learn to enjoy it instead of being 
sensitive to sweet sounds. A small, light hand-bell is delight- 
ful for the baby in the second quarter, and he will quickly 
learn to use it. 
As for other toys, let the child choose them for himself. 
He may appropriate a wooden curtain ring, a string of empty 
spools, a spoon, perhaps a fly-swatter. It is recommended 
that the baby at this age shall have hard rather than soft 
playthings, to develop his power to grasp, and to feel of 
definite shapes.

Foods and Feeding 
As in the preceding months, the baby nursed by his 
mother will have the food increased in quantity according to 
his needs. For the artificially fed infant the following rules 
are recommended by the American Medical Association. 
At six months old the average child requires 24 ounces of milk 
daily, which should be diluted with 12 ounces of water. To this 
should be added two ounces of limewater, and three level table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. This should be given in five feedings. 
The amount of milk should be increased by one-half ounce every 
week. The milk should be increased only if the child is hungry 
and digesting his food well. It should not be increased unless he 
is hungry, nor if he is suffering from indigestion, even though he 
seems hungry. 
Since, however, the amount of food needed varies with the 
weight of the child — large infants as a rule requiring more 
and small infants less — the following rule for adapting the 
meal to the baby is given by the Committee on Infant Social 
Service of the Women’s Municipal League of Boston. 
Weigh the child, and allow for its daily food one and one-half 
ounces of milk for every pound it weighs. With this quantity of 
milk as a foundation, modify by the addition of water, limewater, 
and sugar, according to the rules set forth by the American Medical 
Association. 
To illustrate: If a big baby weighs twenty pounds at the 
age of six months, the daily weight of milk should be 20 x 
14, or 30 ounces. The volume by the standard measuring- 
cup will be one and seven-eighths cupfuls. Add to this twelve 
ounces of water (one and one-half cupfuls), two ounces of 
limewater (one-fourth cupful), and three level tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar. 
At this age, five feedings daily, the first at six o’clock in
-P-A-G-E-65
   THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 49 
the morning, the last at ten at night, at intervals of four 
hours each, are usually prescribed. 
Additional Foods Allowed During the Third Quarter 
Thin Gruels. The American Medical Association permits at 
this age an increased proportion of barley flourinmaking the thin 
gruel used to dilute the cow’s milk, and changes the recipe to 
oneand one-half tablespoonfuls of barley flour to twelve ounces 
of water—the preparation and cooking remaining as before. 
The appearance of the first teeth is nature’s way of telling 
that the infant is ready for a little feeding of starchy food 
such as gruel without admixture of milk, and whether the 
child is artificially or breast fed, this may now be begun, with 
the physician’s approval. The following recipe is a good one: 
Barley or Oatmeal Gruel. Measure two tablespoonfuls of 
pearl barley or oatmeal, add to a quart of boiling water with 
the addition of one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, boil directly 
over the fire for twenty minutes, and cook in a double boiler 
for two hours. Strain through cheesecloth, sweeten with 
one tablespoonful of sugar, and give from one to two table- 
spoonfuls of the mixture to the child just before nursing. 
Begin by giving one-half tablespoonful diluted with the 
same amount of warm water. 
Great care is needed in giving a child — especially if 
breast fed — any new food for the first time. A very small 
quantity only should be tried, and the effects of this ob- 
served before the next portion is administered. 
Sometimes these gruels are useful in regulating the bowels, 
oatmeal being considered laxative and barley the opposite, 
but this effect is not always apparent. 
Fruit Juices. The orange juice recommended in the last 
section may now be given in increased quantity, and the 
baby — especially if artificially fed — ought to have from 
one to one and one-half tablespoonfuls every day. The 
juice of fresh or canned tomatoes, strained through cheese- 
cloth, may be substituted for orange juice. 
Beef juice, beef tea, and white of egg are sometimes 
prescribed at this age for children who are not thriving.

The mother should consult the physician before making 
alterations in the diet, or additions to it. 4H | 
| | ' Signs that the Baby is Thriving 
Weight and Height. The baby’s gain in weight will not 
be so rapid now as during the previous months, and the 
average increase will probably be only a pound a month. 
Once in two weeks will now be often enough to take weigh- 
ings. The child whose weight at birth was seven pounds 
will at the end of nine months probably weigh eighteen 
pounds, and will be twenty-six or twenty-seven inches 
tall. See Table on page 56. 
Quiet sleep, normal bowel movements, urination, and 
temperature are as before the customary signs depended 
on to show the infant is doing well, and besides these the 
child is now at an age when a good color and good spirits 
are signs of good health, 
The Coming of the First Teeth 
The most important change to be looked for in the third 
quarter is the coming of the first or “milk” teeth. When 
this first set of temporary teeth is complete there will be 
twenty of them; ten in the upper, ten in the lower jaw. 
The first begin to show themselves usually by the seventh 
month, and they are generally the two middle teeth in the 
lower jaw, but there is no rule as to which come first, and the 
paradox that erratic appearance and sequence are normal 
should comfort the mother when the young teeth show 
themselves in unexpected places or at unexpected times. 
Most babies put forth their front teeth first, the two in 
the lower jaw being followed by two in the upper — or vice 
versa. At the end of his third quarter the baby will probably 
have these four teeth. Then he will take a vacation and no 
more may appear for a month or two, when the next group 
of four should come. Generally, the teeth appear in groups 
of four, with increasingly Jonger intervals between times. 
A mother should not be too proud if her baby’s teeth 
begin to come earlier than the seventh month (though she
-P-A-G-E-67
       THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 51 
usually is), and she should not be discouraged if they are 
a little later; but if after full seven months there is no sign 
of a tooth the physician should be informed. 
More or less physical disturbance is common at teething- 
time. There will be drooling, restlessness, and increase in 
temperature for at least three or four days. Babies during 
teething-time are very sensitive to noise. With the arti- 
ficially fed baby there is generally more trouble than with 
the breast-fed infant, and it often happens that the mother 
of a healthy baby, nursed by herself, does not know the 
tooth is coming until it shows itself. This is a thing to be 
very proud of, as an indication of fine physical condition. 
As a rule, the baby will fail to gain in weight for a couple 
of weeks while struggling with his teeth, and will lose 
appetite. If this is the case it is better not to force him to 
take food, but to give him drinks of cool water instead — 
for at teething time he needs extra water. After the first 
group of teeth are out, his appetite will come back, and he 
may be expected quickly to make up his weight. 
General Care of the Infant During the Third Quarter 
Hours for Sleep. By the close of the second quarter 
the mother will probably find the baby gradually needing 
less sleep, until at six months old he will require only about 
sixteen hours of sleep in the twenty-four. He is likely to 
sleep five hours at a stretch, especially if he has been having 
many new experiences. Strain on attention is nerve-wearing. 
The Daily Bath. The temperature of the daily bath 
should still be warm, not more than 95° F., or a little under. 
A bath thermometer should be used. By this time, if not 
before, the baby ought to show great enjoyment of his bath, 
and should love to splash and play in the water. © 
The Daily Outings. As in the preceding quarter, the 
baby should spend hours in the open air and take all his 
daytime naps out of doors if the weather is pleasant or 
even tolerable. He should be laid flat, and kept properly 
warm. Small babies do not generate as much heat as little 
runabouts, therefore care should be taken to keep feet,    
-P-A-G-E-68
    
   52 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
arms, abdomen, buttocks, and all their little cold spots 
comfortable when the weather is cool. When they are taken 
for rides the carriage umbrella or hood should still be used 
to shade the eyes, which are yet far from strong enough to 
be exposed to direct, bright light. Neither should cold 
wind be allowed to blow on the child’s face. From this 
time it is good for the baby to be exposed as much as possible 
to direct sunlight, — provided the eyes are shaded — with- 
out the intervention of window glass, or over-much cloth- 
ing. Sunlight is both prevention and cure for rickets, a 
disease to which babies from six months to two years 
of age are subject. City babies are more prone to rickets 
than country children, because, so it is said, they have less 
sunshine in city life than in open country. 
Maintenance of a Happy Atmosphere. That the baby 
shall be kept joyful and happy is a very important point 
in its general care, especially from the beginning of the 
third quarter. In her book called ‘The Unseen Side of 
Child Life,” Miss Elizabeth Harrison tells of a cross nurse- 
maid who forced a six-months-old baby into his carriage 
and tucked him up so tight that he could not show his 
indignation by kicking. The maid’s face was angry and 
flushed, and the face of the child reflected these emotions 
with added intensity. Another nurse, whose baby showed 
a similar unwillingness to go into his carriage, put him in 
lovingly and gently, with bright and cheery words, so that 
“the tone of the nurse’s voice awakened a corresponding 
mood within, until he crowed with delight as the blanket 
was tucked around him.” She says: “In each case the 
child was unconsciously absorbing the mood of the older 
person, and this absorbing of mental conditions comes 
before the actual imitating of physical activities. It thus 
increases the importance of selecting the right person to 
take care of early infancy.” 
In “The Mother’s Year Book,” ‘by Mrs. Marion Foster 
Washburne, she says that when a mother finds herself angry, 
out-of-sorts, or sad and depressed, she should hand over 
her baby to some happier person to:take care of until she has

  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 53 
got over the unwholesome mood, and should no more keep 
near her child than if she suffered from a contagious disease. 
Fits of Temper. Sometimes these appear in the second 
quarter, and when they do not they may be expected 
some time during the third. The baby will give evidence of 
decided irascibility, and will demonstrate rage and rebellion 
at any discomfort, or at being refused something he has 
set his heart on. The training of her child, which should 
begin in the first year of its life, will be found by the young 
mother more conducive to her own training and develop- 
ment than any formal education she ever had. Now is a 
good time for her to take to heart what Professor James 
has written on Habit, to learn the danger of allowing paths 
of ill-temper or any other form of naughtiness to be formed 
in the young brain tissue. Every time the baby flies into 
a rage will make it easier for him to fly into another, and 
many faults are cured by not letting them happen. The 
child should not be given things because he cries for them. 
Nevertheless a prolonged fit of angry crying ought not to 
be allowed to take place, since this is a poisonous thing, 
a bad habit, and bad for the baby. The mother should 
banish the ill-temper by some cleverly devised distraction, 
she should guard against cause for its next occasion, and 
be skillful in checking its first symptoms. 
The Baby’s Progress During the Third Quarter 
From six months on the anterior fontanelle should begin 
gradually to grow smaller, the growth of the bones will 
now catch up with that of the brain and begin to enclose 
the big, soft spot that young mothers do not like. It will 
not be fully closed for some time to come, but it will be a 
comfort to find it growing smaller instead of larger. 
Sometimes as early as six months old, a baby who has 
constantly been sung to by its mother will attempt to 
imitate the sweet sounds loved so much at this age, and 
will lilt them in a small and charming treble, greatly to 
the mother’s delight. Miss Harrison tells of a girl baby 
who thus learned to sing the tune her mother constantly
-P-A-G-E-70
  54 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
hummed when putting her to sleep, and this phenomenon 
of a baby ‘‘carrying a tune,” though not so common as other 
indications of progress, is by no means rare. 
Babies now delight in being talked to, but sound is more 
important than sense, and to recite the alphabet with 
agreeable intonation, or to count up to a hundred, will 
please them quite as much as to read rhymes, call pet 
names, or tell them they are lovely girls — or boys. 
From six or seven months on the baby should be able 
to sit erect. Many babies can do it earlier. Look out for 
signs of fatigue, the little back is not yet extra strong. 
From the beginning of the seventh month, if not before, 
the baby will have enough command of arms and hands 
to play with things, and he never completes examination 
of them without experimenting on their reaction when 
put in his mouth. Miss Shinn thinks that it is not because 
of a mistaken impression that everything is good to eat 
that the baby crams it in his mouth, but rather because the 
tactual nerves of lips and tongue are more sensitive than those 
of finger-tips, and he wants to know as exactly as possible 
how the thing feels. The mother should make sure at this 
age that the child’s playthings are too big to be swallowed. 
About this time he will discover how entertaining it is 
to drop things and have someone pick them up for him to 
drop again. This, the child psychologists (or whatever 
they call themselves) tell us, is because he likes the sound 
the article makes in falling on the floor. We have seen 
a baby just as insistent in dropping things on the carpet 
or rug. Then our scientist friends account for it by saying 
the child has not yet learned to hold and keep them. For 
all this sophistry, few mothers will believe a baby drops 
a thing because of anything but a spirit of mischief and 
fun. He will drop the toy, then say, “Uh, uh,” leaning his 
body toward it or turning his face to his mother, but the 
moment she weakly picks it up he will drop it again and. 
want the whole performance repeated. Dr. Luther-Gulick’s 
little girl dropped a spoon seventy-nine times, and seventy- 
nine times had it picked up for her. (‘A Philosophy of 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
    THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 55 
Play’). It seems as though the baby wants to insist on 
this form of diversion as a game, but it soon becomes any- 
thing but a game to the long-suffering mother, and we advise 
her, after a dozen or so of pick-ups, to refuse to play. 
The baby in the third quarter shows decided likes and 
dislikes and preferences. Some strangers will be made 
friends with at once, others will be kept at a distance dur- 
ing a longer or shorter probation. Many babies are wisely 
intolerant of clothes which impede the free use of arms 
and legs, and will work off shoes and stockings and perse- 
veringly wriggle their arms out of a shawl or cloak. One 
little girl of seven months refused to wear a cap and always 
contrived to drag it off when put on her head. 
Sometimes the baby is able to bear his weight on his 
feet at the beginnihg of the ninth month, especially if he 
is not a big, heavy child. If not quite able for this feat 
he will be pretty sure to show a disposition to try it. The 
first thing he does as soon as he can stand on two feet in his 
mother’s lap, is to pull her hair. He learned to pull it some 
time in the second quarter, but not with the purposeful deter- 
mination he will now show, nor with the cries of delight, nor 
with the tenacity. It will often be hard to make him let go. 
Dawnings of purposefulness and intention will be evident 
from now on. Ralph at six months learned to reach a de- 
sired objective by rolling towards it on the floor, even before 
having learned to creep. Patricia at seven months old 
would creep to a brass bed, for the purpose of putting her 
hands on the brass posts and thus raising herself to her feet. 
Frances, her older sister, after weaning from both breast 
and bottle and first introduction to the drinking-cup, one day 
when her mother was called away for a moment, picked up the 
cup and began drinking by herself while in her high chair. 
The baby’s sense of causation is, we are told, shown by 
his dropping things to have them picked up — though no 
one is quite sure what is the result hoped for by this act. 
Every observant mother will recall other examples of a 
beginning realization of the relation of cause and effect. 
About the ninth month the baby will understand a great
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
deal that is said to him. On being asked where father is, 
or mother, or grandma, he will turn and look in the direc- 
tion of the person named. He will similarly be able to show 
the whereabouts of the cat or dog, the bird, or other domestic 
animals. 
He will be able now to say ‘“Pap-pa,” and “Mam-ma,” 
quite distinctly, but we are told he does not mean by these 
sounds to identify his father and mother. All he intends 
to do—so say the skeptics —is to practice his labials, 
and it is only in pride and vanity that the parents believe 
he means to address them. However this may be, the 
baby very soon learns that his mother is ‘‘Mam-ma,” 
and his father is “‘Pap-pa.” In this quarter, too, he knows 
his own name and pet names. 
During this quarter the baby will first essay that art of 
imitation in which he will shortly be a skilled performer. 
He will clap his hands on request, will imitate gestures, 
and will “go in hide”. Frances waved ‘“bye-bye”’ on re- 
quest at seven months old; she understood the game of 
“Pat-a-Cake”’ in her ninth month, and on hearing the first 
line of the verse would at once set to work on a vigorous 
patting of the cake. ?

This, and the table on page 105, were adapted from one 
compiled by Robert M. Woodbury, Ph.D., of the Children’s 
Bureau in Washington. 
How to Read the Tables. The column at the extreme left 
of each table gives the height in inches, irrespective of age, 
up to a certain limit. Thus, a boy of one month old may 
be from twenty to twenty-five inches tall, and in the second 
column will be found his right weight in pounds for every 
added inch of height that he may measure at the age of one 
month or close to one month. 
At three months old, or when the child’s age is nearest 
to three months, if the boy measures two feet (24 inches) 
tall, follow the line to the column headed ‘‘3 mos.” where the 
estimated weight is found to be 13 lbs. A boy who is two 
and one-half feet tall (30 inches) at either six or nine months 
old should weigh 22 lbs. — a girl of the same age and height, 
21 Ibs. 
Playthings, and Mother-and-Baby Games 
As in the last quarter, the common objects that seem 
particularly attractive to the child are the best playthings 
for him. Pieces of paper, which by this time he will love 
to tear up, make toys he will greatly enjoy. He also likes 
to make a noise with rather stiff, crackly paper, but to 
tear it up is better fun. The coral and bells, or a rubber 
teething ring, a wooden curtain ring large enough to slip 
over his arm, a wooden or celluloid ball to roll about, a 
clothespin or two, or string of spools, perhaps a bunch of 
keys, make delightful playthings. 
The games to be played are now more varied. 
“Peek-a-Boo.” From six months on, the baby’s delight in 
having a handkerchief thrown over his face and pulled 
off again, will develop into ability to play a real game of 
peek-a-boo. At eight months old he will be found attempt- 
ing to hold the handkerchief, with more or less success, before 
his face while he peeks archly out. 
“Hide and Seek.” Another game, which the baby will 
often initiate of himself — apparently he gets the idea  
-P-A-G-E-74
     58 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
    
       
   
                         
      
    
                          from peek-a-boo — is that of hiding his face on his mother’s 
breast, or in the hollow of her shoulder, and then turning 
it out again with an expression of roguish invitation to 
welcome his re-appearance. This trick will be repeated 
again and again to the reaction of smiles and appropriate 
words. These he likes best if musically intoned. In this 
game the mother is the hiding place, the baby the actor, 
and the mother (or a spectator) furnishes the applause. 
Its first beginning is often caused by real shyness at the 
overtures of a stranger, but when the right conditions are 
present the act of hiding and coming forth is soon performed 
in the spirit of a game. 
Repetition of Sounds. This game is played by the mother 
imitating some sound made by the child. To his “‘Goo-goo,” 
or any other primitive utterance, the mother returns a 
similar “Goo-goo.” As soon as the child is old enough 
to know that what she said was in response to his speech, 
and to be encouraged by her flattering imitation of him, 
he will respond by a repetition of the sound, which she again 
imitates, provoking further repetition from him in alter- 
nating duet — and this becomes a fine social game for the 
two. 
4 
Tue Last QUARTER OF THE First YEAR 
   Foods and Feeding 
During this quarter, in the case of the breast-fed baby, 
the amount of milk secreted by the mother will be found 
insufficient to nourish the child, and the time to wean will 
thus be indicated. Weaning will be discussed under a 
separate heading. 
For the artificially fed infant the following is the recom- 
mendation of the American Medical Association.    
   
     At nine months old the average child requires 30 ounces of milk 
daily, which should be diluted with 10 ounces of water. To this    
-P-A-G-E-75
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 59 
should be added two level tablespoonfuls of sugar and two ounces 
of limewater. This should be given in five feedings. 
The sugar added may be milk sugar (lactose), malt sugar (malt- 
ose), or cane sugar. At first, plain water should be used to dilute 
the milk. 
Additional Foods Permitted from Nine to Twelve Months 
Thicker Gruels. After nine months the barley flour may 
be increased to three level tablespoonfuls cooked in eight 
ounces (one cupful) of water. (See page 49 for recipe). 
Fruit Juices. The child may now have from two to four 
tablespoonfuls of fruit juice every day, between the first 
and second feeding in the morning. Orange juice is generally 
prescribed, but tomato juice, the juice of fresh, ripe peaches, 
of fresh pineapple, or raspberries, or of cooked apple, are 
permissible substitutes. The fruit juices should always 
be strained and diluted with an equal volume of water. 
After nine months the child who seems to need it may be 
given two teaspoonfuls of beef juice, diluted with two 
teaspoonfuls of water. Or he may be given a quarter- 
cupful of beef, chicken, or mutton broth, or broths made 
either wholly of vegetables, such as carrot, spinach, etc., 
or made of both meat and vegetables. The amount may be 
gradually increased to perhaps one-half cupful by the close 
of the year. 
At ten months the baby may be fed one teaspoonful of 
very soft-cooked egg once a day, gradually increasing to 
one tablespoonful daily. 
Zweiback. At ten to twelve months old he may be given 
a bit of dry, crisp toast, or an unsweetened zweiback, to 
do what he likes with, after one of the regular feedings. 
Or he may have a strip of the crust of a stale loaf to suck 
and chew and enjoy. 
Cereal Jelly. A thoroughly cooked and strained cereal 
jelly, without sugar, may be given at nine months old, 
beginning with one tablespoonful and increasing to three, 
after the first morning feeding. The following is a good 
recipe:  
-P-A-G-E-76
    60 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Soak overnight one cupful of Scotch or Irish oatmeal 
in three cupfuls of water. In the morning pound and press 
the grain with a wooden potato masher, and strain through 
a fine strainer. Cook directly over the fire, with careful 
stirring, until the mixture is thick, add one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of salt, and cook in a double boiler for an hour. 
This may be poured into small cups, and should jell when 
cold. It will keep for several days in the refrigerator. 
Let us again warn the mother that when adding a new 
food to the child’s diet it is always well to begin with a 
quite small quantity, and watch for a few days for signs that 
it agrees with the baby before increasing the amount. 
Preyer thinks that after weaning children are apt to be 
disconcerted by new flavors, and for a time to show dislike 
for them. 
Water drinking between meals should be kept up. 
Dr. Jacobi used to recommend that a delicate infant 
should have a piece of rare beef to suck, or a strip of well- 
cooked bacon fat. The child will be gory and greasy as to 
face and hands, and will immediately need a wash and a 
fresh bib, but the beef juice and bacon fat are said to be 
easily digested and good for the baby. 
Do not give the baby bits of candy, cake, or fruit; do not 
give any other foods than those listed above without the 
express advice of your physician, and do not give even 
those listed without his knowledge and consent. 
Weaning from the Breast 
The weaning of the baby is the great adventure of this 
quarter. Very often the baby has been weaned before 
this time, and if the weather is warm or there is trouble 
with the teeth, weaning may be postponed for a month 
or two later, but it is a good rule to begin to wean at nine 
months old. The hot summer months are the worst time 
to make the change from breast milk to artificial food, 
and if the baby is not strong it is better to plan that it 
shall be all over before they begin, or to postpone it until 
they are over. Also, if the baby has been sick or weakly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
     61      
     
                     
   
            THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 
or if there is danger from any prevailing epidemic, his 
weaning should not begin on schedule time. Breast milk 
will sometimes save a sick baby’s life, or restore vigor to 
one depleted by a summer’s heat, thus affording another 
proof that for all our skill in imitating it none of our imita- 
tions can fully take its place. 
Sometimes the mother finds her breast milk insufficient 
during the second or third quarter of the first year, and in 
this case weaning will have to be begun earlier and the 
process continued longer, but whenever it is done the change 
should be made so gradually that the baby does not know 
it happens. A bottle feeding should be substituted for a 
breast feeding once a day for a week or two, then twice a 
day, and so on. Prescriptions for the modification of the 
milk should be obtained from the physician, and its effect 
on the baby carefully watched and reported to him. This, 
because in no case is the food right for the breast-fed infant 
that is proper for the child artifically fed from the start, 
and also because the idiosyncrasies of the individual may 
call for special modification of the diet. The breast-fed 
baby at nine months old cannot usually stand a stronger 
milk preparation than the artificially fed infant gets at three 
or even four months younger. 
Weaning From the Bottle 
Weaning from the bottle may be begun as soon as weaning 
from the breast is successfully concluded. Where the child 
has been bottle-fed, it may be begun at ten months old, 
and by a similar procedure, that is, substitution of one 
feeding every day from spoon or cup for one of the bottle 
feedings. Weaning from the bottle should not be difficult, 
and ought to be complete at the end of the first year, or 
at farthest within two months of the completion of weaning 
from the breast. 
                            
          
      General Care During the Last Quarter 
Hours of Sleep. At one year old the baby should sleep 
for not less than fourteen hours in the twenty-four, and for     
-P-A-G-E-78
   
  62 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
as many more as he wishes. He may have eight solid hours 
of sleep at night, with a nap of three hours in the morning 
and another in the afternoon, or the hours may be changed 
to suit the mother, provided she manages to induce sleep 
for fourteen of them. 
Bathing. The temperature of the bath should be lowered 
gradually until at a year old it is only 90° F. Now, if not 
before, he should be accustomed to a cooler sponge follow- 
ing the bath. This should never be given in such a way 
as to shock the child. It may be begun by a cool sponge on 
the breast alone, then on the back, talking to him and 
reassuring him so that he will not be frightened or object. 
As soon as he is old enough to stand in the bath, pleasantly 
warm water may be provided ankle-deep in the tub, and a 
quick, cool sponge passed over his body, to be followed 
by a dry rub. The child should be trained to enjoy this. 
Avoidance of Excitements. Though play and games may 
now be more indulged in, and though the child delights 
in being noticed and craves new adventures, the mother 
should be careful not to allow his attention to be strained; 
to guard him from too much variety, too many friends, 
too great crowds of people, too quick a succession of objects 
of interest. 
The child becomes increasingly sensitive to love, and 
should be cared for only by persons who love him. 
A young mother during this last quarter of the first year 
should especially guard against trying to make her baby 
do everything some rival baby can do. She should not 
teach her child too many showy accomplishments, to excel 
those of the other child. A child’s brain has now to grow 
in size, and to force it prematurely to functioning is bad 
for both baby and brain. Neither should the mother, 
merely because the baby next door, of the same age, can 
walk independently while hers can only creep, attempt 
too soon to put him on his feet and try to teach him this 
difficult art. Bow-leggedness often results from such mis- 
directed ambition. 
The child of this age is often so entertaining that he will 
    
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 63 
have to be shielded from encouragement to “show off,” 
as well as from overmuch play with visiting relatives, and 
—hardest of all—from the before-bed-time stimulation 
of play with his father, who will naturally want his off- 
spring’s whole repertoire gone through after he comes home 
from business. It makes babies nervous and irritable to 
be played with too much and too late. It is not good for 
their young brains, they will not sleep so well, and it may 
even induce indigestion. 
Special Care During the First Summer 
The baby’s first summer has to be encountered some time 
during the baby’s first year, and his feeding and care adapted 
to it. This is especially urgent when the baby is artificially 
fed, either from the beginning or after weaning from the 
breast. 
The food should be tested with litmus at each feeding, 
to make sure the milk is unsoured. It is possible the feed- 
ings will have to be Pasteurized if the weather is humid, 
hot, or thundery. Regular appliances for Pasteurization, 
with full directions, are sold; and devices for improvising 
them are to be readily obtained, but the following has been 
found practical in the Philadelphia Babies’ Hospital; it 
is simple, and it is recommended by Mrs. Max West in her 
bulletin on Infant Care, series No. 2 of the Children’s 
Bureau at Washington. 
Fill the baby’s bottles for the day (there should be one for each 
feeding), cork them loosely, and stand them in a kettle containing 
a gallon of water which has been heated to a hard boil, and then 
taken from the stove to a table and allowed to stand uncovered for 
ten minutes. When the bottles have been put in, cover the kettle 
and let them stand in it for half an hour, then take them out, make 
the corks tight, quickly cool them in running water, place in re- 
frigerator, and do not uncork any of the bottles until it has been 
reheated for a feeding. Then the rubber nipple is substituted for 
the cork. 
In warm weather avoid overfeeding. Each feeding may 
often, with advantage to the child, be diminished by one-
-P-A-G-E-80
    64 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
third, and the volume made up with water. Water should 
also be given freely between feedings. 
The baby should put off all possible clothing. A diaper 
and a light slip are enough for very warm days, unless 
the skin seems over cool to the touch. Excess of perspira- 
tion should be looked out for, too. 
Frequent sponging of the child’s body with water at the 
temperature recommended for his age, will refresh him and 
promote sleep. 
The ideal conditions for sleep, either day or night, are in 
his crib on a screened porch. Next best is a cool, airy room 
at night, and in the daytime out-of-doors in the shade. 
Extra sleep should be encouraged in warm weather, and 
the child kept as free as possible from excitement — even 
that of the mother-and-baby games allowed at this age. 
Music instead of games is better for hot days. 
The seashore, when possible, is a good place for baby to 
spend his first summer. Even an occasional day on the 
water or at the beach has tided many a baby over summer 
sickness. 
The Baby’s Progress During the Last Quarter 
Height. The baby at the end of the first year should be 
eight or nine inches taller than at birth; hence, the child 
that measured eighteen or twenty inches at birth may now 
be expected to measure twenty-seven to twenty-nine, or 
perhaps thirty. 
Weight. That the baby shall treble his weight in his 
first year is the usual estimate. A child often exceeds ex- 
pectation, and will weigh something more — or something 
less — but the average given is a safe guide, and the baby 
is safe that conforms to it. (See Table, page 105). 
Teeth, Number and Kind. At twelve months old the 
number of teeth should be at least six, four in the upper, 
two in the lower jaw. 
Growth of the Brain. The brain during the first year may 
be expected to attain more than one-third of its average 
weight at maturity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
        THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BABY’S LIFE 65 
Advance Towards Walking. During the last quarter the 
baby will learn to turn his body on the soft, thick rug in 
his kiddie koop or on the floor. Next comes real creeping 
on all fours, and pretty creepers will have to be made for 
the baby’s excursions. Guard against dyed clothing now, 
that it does not touch the skin. Cold floors, too, will have 
to be guarded against, and the spirit of adventure that will 
impel the creeper to climb upstairs or down. This tendency 
to climb when the child has learned to creep ought not to 
be suppressed; it is a natural instinct, and a slanting board 
with thick rugs under it, may be provided for the baby to 
crawl up, or if anybody has time to watch him, let him climb 
upstairs. Some children learn to propel themselves so 
rapidly on all fours that they are slower in learning to walk, 
as though they were satisfied with the present achievement 
and had no ambition to try a new and difficult way. 
Some mothers, when the baby begins to creep, fasten one 
end of a long, stout string to a belt around his waist, and 
the other end to something stationary, so that the child 
may have a long and wide range for his activities, yet be 
kept from getting into danger zones. 
During the tenth month, if the child tries again and again 
to support his body on his feet and stand alone, he should 
have a ‘“‘walker” to give him confidence — or, if supported 
by the old-fashioned ‘‘leading-strings” or by his mother’s 
arms from behind, let him make his first great show of walk- 
ing, raising one foot at a time with pomp and ostentation 
and bringing it down on the heel. Perhaps, before long, he 
will be holding on to chairs and moving about the room, 
and finally will toddle, with conscious triumph, a staggering 
spurt of a couple of yards between the held-out arms of 
father and mother, or from one to another across the room. 
(See Table on page 75). 
Advance Towards Talking. The baby may be able by 
the end of the first year to address or allude to, by their 
names, the persons he knows best, or sees every day. He

names or by an imitation of the sounds they make; and he

    66 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
will at least attempt equivalents for his food, bed, carriage, 
kiddie koop, and for almost everything he sees every day 
or wants very much. He prefers nouns to verbs, and has 
quite a little vocabulary of them, and he will understand 
almost everything that is said to him. Miss Shinn’s niece 
at twelve months old understood eighty-four words, singly 
or in combination. 
As a rule, the slower the baby is to walk, the sooner he 
will learn to talk; this should console the mother if her child 
is backward in either of these arts, for they are difficult 
to acquire and have often to be practiced alternately. 
A baby of our acquaintance, a lover of song who had 
constantly been sung to, was able to hum three different 
tunes when he was a year old. Miss Harrison tells about a 
little girl who could do likewise at the same age. (“The 
Unseen Side of Child Life,” page 47). 
Gestures. The baby now knows much more than he can 
say, so he does what we all do in attempting intercourse 
with foreigners whose tongue we have not mastered, he 
makes gestures. He will point to things he wants, will 
turn most decidedly away from things he does not want, 
will hold up his arms to be taken, and will by various means 
show that he. wants to engage in different games or plays, 
especially when he wants to be danced or tossed in the air. 
Taking Notice. Animals or birds are very attractive 
to our one-year-old, so are other children, and he will enjoy 
looking at himself in the glass. Indeed, there is very little 
that he will not notice, either outdoors or in the house, 
and he will soon learn to say “Pitty” to things he admires. 
The young Frances, already mentioned in former pages, 
displayed a critical and independent judgment of what 
was or was not “Pitty,” and could not be coaxed to say it 
unless she thought the object presented for admiration 
deserved it. 
Toys, Play, Games, Eitc., for the Fourth Quarter 
Toys. Choice of toys for the baby should be based on 
his present instinct to put things in his mouth. They should

therefore not be painted, nor small enough to swallow, nor 
with too much carving or roughness or sharp-corneredness. 
Neither should too many be offered at once. Johnson 
(“Education by Plays and Games,” G. E. Johnson) thinks the 
best toys for the year-old child are still those that help 
in developing sense-perception, and also those that encourage 
the child to use means to ends. Bottles filled with bright 
shells or seeds, balls of colored wood or celluloid, rubber 
animals, blocks, and other articles that are colored and 
not colored; things that are rough and things that are 
smooth; some that are hard and some that are soft; some 
that are heavy and some that-are light, for sense develop- 
ment. For employment of means to ends, bells, gongs, 
sand pail and shovel, a tin pan to bang on with a wooden 
spoon, nests of boxes or a box with a sliding lid, perhaps 
- animals that squeak when pressed — and always the sand 
pile, both to feel of and to dig in, as well as such playthings 
as he picks out for himself from household utensils, will 
please and educate the child. 
Play. ‘“Pat-a-Cake” will still be enjoyed, and at the first 
words of the rhyme some babies will get to work on a vigorous 
patting of the cake. “The Falling Game,” “Swing of Pendu- 
lum,” “Beckon to Chickens” (or Pigeons), ““Coo-Coo,” “The 
Light Bird on the Wall,” and the mimicry plays like “ Mow 
the Grass’’— also dramatizing on request how grandma 
knits, how father reads the newspaper, what the dog or the 
kitty says, or the rooster, will give pleasure both now and 
for six months or more to come. 
Play or games that help in identifying parts of the 
body, such as “The Little Thumb is One,” and the many 
finger and toe plays, are in order now. 
Games. “Hide and Seek” may be played with a large hand- 
kerchief, and the baby who is able to stand or walk will 
hide under the mother’s apron or wrapper (mothers’ skirts 
no longer furnish adequate hiding-place), and laugh with 
delight when he is discovered. 
“Tunnel and Meet” is another game to be played standing, 
when the mother tunnels with her hand under one end of 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  68 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
a towel, apron, or large handkerchief, and teaches the child, 
through imitation, to tunnel from the other end, until the 
hands joyfully meet and clasp somewhere near the middle. 
It should, of course, be played with accompanying musical 
recita¥o. 
The game of ‘“‘Creep Mouse,” where the mother advances 
her fingers with a creeping motion from the baby’s waist 
to under his chin, meantime intoning with the proper 
accent: : 
“Creep mouse, creep mouse, creep mouse, 
In-to baby’s wee house, wee house, wee house!’’ 
with a gentle tickle under the chin at the climax will pro- 
duce shrieks of delighted laughter in a fun-loving baby. 
English infants have the following game played with 
them: 
“Here’s the Lord Lieutenant,” (the mother touches the child’s 
forehead with finger) 
“Here, his two men,” (the eyelids are lightly touched with two 
fingers) 
“Here’s the post office,” (with a touch on upper lip or tip of 
nose) 
“And here they go in,” (the lips or teeth are touched) 
ending with 
“‘Chin-chapper, chin-chapper, chin-chapper, chin!” 
at the same time tapping under the chin with the knuckles 
to make the teeth chatter together. We have seen many 
a baby of a year old or a little over compose his face from 
the beginning of this game to the thrill of its ending, then 
to let go in a delighted giggle, and want the performance 
repeated. 
But again, don’t play too much with the baby, don’t 
excite him too much.

  Cuapter III 
THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD'S Tire 
Foods and Feeding 
During the first three or four months of the second year 
the milk, which for a long while to come should be the staple 
food for the child, may be modified according to one or the 
other of the following formulas: 
1, Add to the milk one-fourth its volume of strained gruel, either 
barley or oatmeal. To every cupful of the mixture so formed add 
two level tablespoonfuls of milk sugar, or one of cane sugar, and 
add also one tablespoonful of limewater. 
2. Instead of using gruel, add to the milk two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of grated and sifted crumbs from unsweetened zweiback, 
mixed with one-fourth cupful of water. Add sugar and limewater as 
before. 
Starchy foods, such as the gruels and zweiback, are needed 
for two reasons. First, because the baby now needs more 
energy-formers than the milk affords, and he has now the 
proper secretions to digest them. Second, because undiluted - 
cow’s milk forms larger and more solid curds in the stomach 
than does woman’s milk, and starchy foods break these up 
and make digestion easier. 
The sugar is still needed after weaning, because cow’s milk 
has less sugar in its composition than woman’s milk, and it 
is well to make up the deficiency. 
Milk sugar is at this time often recommended because 
_ it does not ferment so readily as cane sugar, and its use 
may be kept up until after the second summer if it is found 
to agree with the child. After cane sugar time comes, or 
if the infant has been accustomed to cane sugar from the 
start, only half the quantity need be used; otherwise, its 
sweetening power is so much greater that the child’s food 
would be excessively sugary. 
69
-P-A-G-E-88
¢ 70 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Up to the age of eighteen months most babies are given 
five meals a day. The following are good standard menus: 
6-7 am. One cupful of the modified milk, slightly warmed. 
8 a.m Two or more tablespoonfuls of fruit juice. 
104.m. Two or three tablespoonfuls of well-cooked cereal, or 
cereal jelly, with one-fourth cupful of milk, or thin cream. No 
sugar. A very slight sprinkle of salt develops the flavor of the 
cream. Following this, a slice of dry toast or zweiback; the meal 
to conclude with nearly a cupful of the warm prepared milk. 
2p.m. One-half cupful of chicken, mutton, or vegetable broth, 
with one or two zweiback or rusks; or twice a week one-half of a 
soft-cooked or poached egg, on toast. A heaping tablespoonful of 
. boiled rice with a little top milk or broth over it. One cupful of 
warm, prepared milk. This time, for the sake of variety, the 
bread-crumb formula may be used. (See number 2, page 69.) 
6 p.m. Two or three tablespoonfuls of well-cooked cereal, with 
one-fourth cupful of plain milk poured over it. One cupful of 
warm prepared milk to finish the meal. 
10 p.m. One cupful of the prepared milk, slightly warmed. 
The hours for these meals may be changed slightly to 
suit the mother’s convenience, provided that not less than 
four hours intervene between them. The baby, as before 
stated, should be put early to bed to get a long beauty 
sleep. Such a baby will waken early, and if the first meal is 
given at six o’clock or soon after he will go off to sleep again, 
leaving the mother free for breakfast — so apt in American 
families to be a hurried feast — and for other morning 
duties. The last meal is the ten o’clock supper to which 
the baby has been accustomed from birth, and for which 
he ought to waken like clockwork. 
Regularity in hours for meals must be practiced, but the 
child should not be tempted to eat if he is unwilling, and 
should not be given food between meals. 
After the age of eighteen months, or when the first four 
molars are out and the second summer is over, the follow- 
ing changes may gradually be made in the menus. 
At the 2 p.m. meal, the heartiest of the day, a whole’ egg 
may be substituted for the half-egg. Eggs are allowed
-P-A-G-E-89
  
e 
THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 71 
only if they do not prove to be too heating for the baby, 
as they sometimes do. Then they have to be omitted from 
the diet. At this meal a baked potato with a little cream 
or dish gravy may be given instead of the rice. By way 
of a sweet course the baby may now have a good spoonful 
of apple sauce or prune pulp spread on toast, with or with- 
out a little top milk poured over. 
_ At the 6 p.m. meal he may have a dish of milk toast in- 
stead of the cereal, and a ripe peach or part of a baked apple 
may be added to the menu. 
Slight differences in the diet of the child at this age are 
found in the rules framed by different authorities, but the 
variations are not serious. As an example, see the following 
rules given by the American Medical Association: 
At 12 months he may take his milk undiluted, and strained cereal 
may be given twice a day. 
During the second year the child should have four meals a day. 
Hours: 6 4.M.,104.M.,2P.M.,6P.m. Nothing but water should 
be allowed between his meals. 
At 12 months, or after the baby is weaned from the bottle and 
taught to drink from a cup, he may have cereals twice a day; they 
should be thoroughly cooked, and for the first two or three months 
they should be strained. He should have four cupfuls of milk daily. 
When 15 months old he should have at first a teaspoonful, later 
on a tablespoonful, of rare scraped beef, mutton, or chicken. 
When 18 months old he may have one-half of a mealy baked 
potato daily. 
At 2 years old he may have most of the fresh green vegetables 
when thoroughly cooked and finely mashed. 
The juice of fresh fruit may be given after twelve months. 
Cooked fruit, such as baked apple or apple sauce, should be 
given once a day after the child is eighteen months old; it should at 
first be strained. 
The order in which the foods may be introduced into the 
diet is given as follows by Drs. Holt, Rotch, and others: 
At 12 months old. Bread, zweiback, or a hard cracker twice a day 
before or after meals, to encourage mastica- 
tion. 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  €; 
72 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
14 to 15 months. Boiled rice. Baked apple or apple sauce. A 
ripe peach in season. 
16 months. Butter on bread. (This is disallowed by some 
authorities.) Prune pulp. Whole milk, un- 
modified. 
17 to 18 months. Baked white potato. © 
19 to 20 months. Eggs, soft-cooked, twice a week. Milk junket. 
20 to 24 months. Rare meat pulp. 
The mother should note that though after weaning it is 
good — even necessary — to provide more variety in the 
child’s diet, this should be done gradually, and only one new 
food added at a time. Each food should first be tried on 
the baby in small quantities, and its effects carefully observed. 
Crying, fretful children often need extra nourishment to 
make up loss of energy. (See p. 111.) 
The Baby’s Progress During the Second Year 
Weare told that more than ninety per cent of our American 
homes are servantless. The mother who belongs to this 
honorable majority is to be congratulated — especially the 
mother of a little child who is beginning to explore this 
world for himself. There is no pleasure to be compared 
with that of watching from day to day the development 
of a young child; there is no greater service than to aid and 
direct it. Also, this constant association promotes love and 
understanding between mother and child; hence, if the 
mother finds the care of both house and baby too much 
for her, she would better engage a cook-housekeeper than 
a nursemaid, and keep her baby to herself. 
Teeth Due During the Second Year. From twelve to eigh- 
teen months the two remaining front teeth in the lower 
jaw should be looked for; also the first four molars will 
appear —as though out of due time and place — leaving 
a blank space between the front teeth and the first of the 
back teeth. Thus the child at eighteen months should have 
twelve teeth: six in the upper, six in the lower jaw. From 
eighteen months to two years the four canine teeth are to 
be expected. The two in the upper jaw are known as the
-P-A-G-E-91
       THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 73 
“eye” teeth, and the two in the lower jaw are popularly 
called the “stomach” teeth. The canine teeth fill the gaps 
in each jaw between the incisors (or front teeth) and the 
molars (or first double teeth). This leaves only eight more 
teeth to come during the next year. Sometimes the full 
set of twenty milk teeth will be complete at the end of the 
second year, for the teeth may never be counted upon to 
come on normal schedule time, nor in the same sequence, 
in every baby. 
The Stomach. The baby’s stomach at the end of the first 
year should have a capacity of nine ounces, or a little more 
than one standard cupful. At eighteen months it has a 
capacity of one and one-half cupfuls. This should be at 
least a rough guide to the mother how much food to give 
at one time, since distention of the stomach at this or any 
other age is harmful. The second and third, or two heartiest 
meals of the day (see Menus, page 70), should be slowly 
eaten — the young digestion is rapid, and the stomach 
capacity will not be strained if sufficient time is allowed 
for them. 
Height and Weight. The child during the second year 
should increase from five to six pounds in weight; and 
should grow three or four inches taller, making him weigh 
at least twenty-six or twenty-seven pounds, and be thirty- 
two to thirty-four inches high. But in neither weight nor 
height should an even and constant development be looked 
for. Nature seems to dislike a measured and unvarying 
rate of progress, and both height and weight will be inter- 
fered with by teething, weather conditions, etc. (See page 
105 for Table of Height and Weight from One Year on.) 
Closing of Fontanelle. The closing of the large fontanelle 
is usually complete by the end of the eighteenth month. 
It is often closed at fourteen to sixteen months, and it ought 
not normally to be open after the end of the second year. 
Growth of Brain. The child’s brain at birth weighs about 
fourteen ounces, and during the interval between this time 
and the end of the second year, when it weighs about twice 
and one-half as much — or an average of thirty-five ounces    
-P-A-G-E-92
     
    74 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
—it grows at a more rapid rate than it ever will in the 
years to come. (Gillespie. ‘‘The Growth of the Brain.”’) 
This growing time of the brain should be a time of quiet- 
ness; its best development will be secured by an unfolding 
of its powers undisturbed by excitement. 
Talking and Walking. Early in the second year there is 
a great advance in the art of mimicry, and the baby is pleased 
and flattered at being asked to tell what the cat says, or 
the cow, or the dog. Frances’s nearest approach to the last 
at 14 months was “Wah-wah.” William, at the same age, 
would fiercely “‘Bow-wow!” 
It has already been observed that progress in talking and 
walking proceed by turn about, as though the child had to 
give his attention to only one at a«time of these difficult 
arts. Talking usually begins before walking; many more 
words will be added to the vocabulary of the second year; 
early in this period two-word sentences will be used, and on 
its completion the child will be able to speak in sentences of 
from six to ten words. He will have a command of nearly 
forty words, and he will be able to hold his own in a short 
and easy dialogue. 
We have heard of babies who walked at eight months 
old, — we have known several who walked at nine, — but 
a young mother will save herself disappointment if she does 
not count on her child’s first independent, but very cautious 
toddle, until he is fourteen to sixteen months old. In a 
very short time caution will be flung to the winds, and the 
baby will toddle recklessly, so that gates will have to be 
put up at the stairheads and French windows, and the 
child’s adventurous excursions will be so varied and untiring 
that the mother will never feel he is safe unless he is asleep. 
Miss Jane Addams comments with much interest on the 
almost intoxicating delight manifested by a child when he 
finds himself really and truly a runabout on two (more 
or less) trustworthy feet. ‘It goes to his head,” says Miss 
Addams, “and he will career around the table or up and down 
the room at top speed, heedless of all but the joy of the new 
achievement. He will use this novel faculty to fatigue
-P-A-G-E-93
  
ne 
THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 75 
point, and so excessively will he yield to its delight that 
* for a time he may lose out in other things, even forgetting 
how to speak.” 7 
After this period of wild delight the child will quickly 
catch up with language study.

Notes. — The first figure, when two are given, means the date of 
the earliest attempt, and the second, the time when the art was mas-

Miss Shinn is here quoted from ‘“‘Notes on the Development of a 
Child,” published by the University of California. In “The Biography 
of a Baby” she has noted that her niece attempted to creep at six 
months old. Patricia (see p. 55) crept at seven months, but her 
sister, Frances, not until nine months. Their mother tells us that a 
baby of her acquaintance began to creep at five months old. 
Care and Training During the Second Year 
Sleep. Counting the midday and afternoon nap the baby 
should have at least fourteen hours of sleep in the twenty- 
four. Sleep is a good deal a matter of habit, and the child 
should be trained to it by regular hours and the quiet of 
a darkened room, or a shaded outdoor sleeping place. 
Plenty of sleep is a vital need of childhood, and at this age 
nothing should be allowed to interfere with the schedule 
of naps. The more nervous and full of excitement the child, 
the more need there is of long hours of sleeping, and, as in 
the first year of life (see page 51), extra sleep should be 
encouraged when there has been extra strain from new 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
ee nee \ 
76 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
experiences. Bedtime should not be later than seven 
o’clock, and the child should not be played with to the 
point of éxcitement or over-stimulation immediately before 
this. \ 
Bathing. The temperature of the bath during the second 
year may be reduced to 86° F., and the baby may be encour- 
aged to splash about in it for awhile and to play at using 
the sponge or washcloth. The bath should be followed by 
a gentle shower of cool water from a small watering pot 
after the child is eighteen months old, and he should be 
dried and dressea in a warm room. 
Walking Shoes. The child’s first walking shoes should be 
lefts and rights, and very carefully fitted. The mother 
should compare the outline of the child’s foot, traced while 
standing on a sheet of paper on the table, with the outline 
of the sole of the shoe, to make sure that the toes are not 
cramped, or the heel so loose as to allow wobbling. Too 
many of the makers of infants’ shoes (and of grown-ups’) 
ignore the anatomy of the foot. In the accompanying

reduced, is compared with that of the sole of the shoe for 
that age, showing this to be too large at the heel and the 
wrong shape for the toes, which it cramps. 
Night-Drawers or Sleeping Garments should be worn in 
cold weather after the child is a year old. They are com- 
fortable and convenient, but physicians say enough care
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 77 
is not taken to have them so long that the child shall not 
be cramped at his uttermost stretching. Posture defects 
later are attributed to night-drawers that at this time are 
shrunken or outgrown. 
High Chair at Dining Table. Shortly after eighteen 
months, possibly before, the baby may have his chair at 
table with the family during luncheon and dinner, whether 
or not his own meals coincide. If they do not, he can bring 
a plaything to the table, get acquainted with the family, 
and enjoy the social hour. Of course he will clamor for 
forbidden dainties, or want to use the carving knife for a 
plaything, but while in his earlier life distractions from 
things evil or impossible were offered —such as a tin 
canister when he cried for the moon — it is now time he 
should learn that there are some things which cannot be 
had for the asking. A happy, healthy baby will usually 
learn this lesson readily. but if the child has been given 
the great gift of a strong and persistent will — which is 
a fine endowment — the baby is going to be a means of 
grace to father and mother, educating them in loving pa- 
tience and self-control. Obedience must be taught, but it 
is almost better it should never be taught unless it is taught 
lovingly, patiently, and with unfailing good humor. 
Low Chair or Rocking Chair. The baby may now have a 
little rocker (or a low chair) of his own. It should be well- 
balanced, the seat broad, and deep enough to support the 
whole length of the thigh, low enough to allow the feet 
to rest comfortably on the floor when the thighs are at 
right angles to the body seated upright. The child should 
be trained to sit well back in the chair, and not on the edge 
of the seat. The fitting of the chair to the child is important 
to right growth and physical development, and it should 
be adjusted to his growth by means of a footstool or a 
firmly upholstered cushion. 
Physical Habits. A good habit to be fostered at this 
time is that of regular evacuation of the bowel twice a 
day; on rising in the morning and following the afternoon 
nap. Towards the close of the first year, or when he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  78 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
learned to enjoy his own low chair, the child should be 
taught to use a chair for stool. Its seat should be so low 
that the thighs are flexed on the abdomen. This is the 
natural posture for stool for either young or old, and the 
one which permits the most complete evactuation. A 
footstool should be used if the low seat is impossible. No 
well-trained child should soil the napkin or clothing after 
nine months or a year old. 
Encouragement of Touching and Handling. The sense of 
touch, of experiencing new sensations, is now one of the 
great means of development of the child. With the excep- 
tion of carving knives and the like, there should be nothing 
in the child’s environment that he may not be free to touch, 
to handle, to feel of. He is of more value than the polished 
table, the velvet cushion—let him satisfy his “touch 
hunger” by feeling, pounding, stroking them. It is cruel 
to the child to inhibit this natural instinct. Put away for 
a time, if necessary, all articles too good for him to handle, 
and let him learn obedience by not touching injurious ones, 
but give him otherwise the freedom of the city of his habi- 
tation. Miss Harrison tells (page 37, “Unseen Side of Child 
Life”) of the phenomenal success, the almost miraculous 
rapidity with which the children (in Dr. Montessori’s 
schools) learned to write after feeling the outline of the 
two-inch-long cardboard letters, “proving conclusively how 
much the sense of touch aids the sense of sight.” 
Sensitiveness to Sound. In the second year the child’s 
sense of hearing is exceedingly delicate, particularly so when 
he is cutting “eye” teeth, ‘‘stomach” teeth, and the molars. 
He should be guarded from harsh sounds and discords, 
- and-his love of music and sweet sounds should be indulged. 
More and more he will be found to imitate song as naturally 
as he imitates speech, and will even articulate new and 
difficult words better when he sings them than when he speaks 
them. His own little songs, in the clear, tuneful lilt of a 
very young child, should be a great delight to the father 
and mother. We are told that the singing mother will 
have a singing child — provided she sings to it.
-P-A-G-E-97
    
THE SECOND YBAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 79 
Love of Pictures. Sometimes babies will show pleasure 
in pictures long before they know what pictures mean. 
Sometimes they learn quite early to identify familiar ob- 
jects pictorially represented —or we think they do. It 
is fairly sure that in the second year a child will recognize 
a pictured dog, or cat, or bird, if he is familiar with these 
in his home. The mother is safe in investing in a few toy 
books for the coming of the psychological moment. She 
should choose books adapted to stand hard usage, with 
stout, cloth-backed pages, and large colored pictures of 
familiar domestic animals, familiar flowers, children, and 
scenes from home life. Miss Olcott (‘The Children’s Read- 
ing,” by Frances Jenkins Olcott, Chapter V) says: ‘Too 
many of the picture books that deluge the market are crude 
in color and coarse in treatment;” and this requires dis- 
criminating choice on the part of the mother, who should 
apply to the selection of her child’s first pictures the same 
fastidious care that she has been using in the choice of his 
first music. 
Safeguarding from Unwholesome Emotions. The safe- 
guarding of the child at this age from jealousy and fear 
has again to be emphasized. The jealousies of little children, 
often curiously intense, need careful treatment. Sensitive 
and loving children often demonstrate this fault, and may 
often be trained out of it by teaching them to love the one 
who is the object of their jealousy. The jealousy of a little 
child often disappears within a very few years, yet it is safer 
not to allow this fault to become ingrained or to form brain- 
paths at this age, and so spare the child much suffering 
later. 
Fear should still be kept an unknown quantity. It is 
significant that as a rule the intensity of a baby’s emotions, 
his tempests of anger, his outraged grief, will not — unlike 
the disturbing emotions of the adult —in the least inter- 
fere with his digestion, while fear — also jealousy — will 
inhibit all the nervous functions, often causes loss of flesh 
and has other hurtful effects, and may produce permanent 
injury in a sensitive child at this or any age.
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Training in Obedience. As already stated (page 28), 
regularity in methods and punctuality in hours are the best 
methods of initiating the unquestioning, automatic. obedi- 
ence that the child should now be trained to yield. “Time 
for dinner,” “Time for by-by,” ‘Time for a ride,” “Time 
for the bath,” will be a means of calling the child’s attention 
to the outside law, rather than the will of the parent, and 
thus forming a habit to persist through life. 
Psychologists exhort parents to give positive, rather than 
negative commands, to substitute a suggestion-of whole- 
some for unwholesome activity, rather than saying “Don’t 
do that!” Now that the child can understand so much 
that is said to it, pray do not permit “No, no, no!” “Don’t,” 
“Stop!” to be the words which he learns chiefly to asso- 
ciate with ‘you. Repressions and inhibitions are things to 
be avoided — except when there is danger of hurt to the 
child, and obedience to them is necessary. 
Care During the Second Summer 
Though the great ordeal of the second year is supposed 
to be the second summer, its seriousness, even in the popular 
mind, has been minimized by better instruction regarding 
the care of infants from birth. This care should have de- 
veloped in the child enough reserves-of strength to carry 
him safely through greater ordeals; and the child who has 
been nourished on mother’s milk, weaned from it unknown 
to him, and who is intelligently fed and cared for, can be 
brought triumphantly through the second summer, even 
though this has to be spent in a city. If, however, exces- 
sively hot weather coincides with eruption of the first four 
molars or the canine teeth, or if the child is ailing or in- 
clined to diarrhcea, it should be worth much sacrifice and 
cost on the part of ;the parents to take him to live in the 
country until the back of the heat is broken. 
While warm weather lasts, whether in city or country, 
the little one should be dressed as lightly as is compatible 
with decency, should have his body sponged with cool — 
not cold — water twice a day, and should be kept carefully 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 81 
powdered. His milk in warm weather may well be diluted 
with water, plenty of cool water should be given for between- 
meal refreshment, and if appetite is decreased the meals may 
be correspondingly decreased. Also, rice, wheat, and 
barley preparations may be substituted for the more heat- 
ing cereals, such as corn and oatmeal. 
Toys, Play, Games, Etc., for the Second Year 
The child is now still further realizing the delights of 
sense perception and muscle control, consequently oppor- 
tunity should be given him, by means of toys and play- 
things as well as games, to develop his senses and physical 
powers. 
The toys should be those that are adapted to joyful 
demonstrations of prowess, such as the soft papers that can 
be rent asunder or the crackling ones that can be crushed, 
that he enjoyed in the earlier months; also balls to roll 
and attempt to throw, gongs to strike, bells to ring; a little 
cart that can be filled with all-sorts and drawn along hall 
or sidewalk; a box with a lid that can for countless times 
be taken off and put on; a strong, securely corked bottle 
half-filled with bright pebbles or beads, or dried beans, 
to be admired and shaken up; rubber-animals, teddy bears, 
gay balloons; and, above all, a sand pile or sand tray is in- 
dispensable, with a kitchen spoon to dig in it. All these 
are delightful playthings for children at this age, but too 
great a variety should not be given at a time, confusing 
the child with embarrassment of riches. Most little children 
love a soft, wooly lamb to hug and take to bed with them. 
A certain Richard of our acquaintance had at one year old 
a grey velvet elephant, a foot or so long, which he loved 
and preferred to other toys. Even at six years old he still 
played with it. But fur animals are sometimes feared, and 
shrunk from when touched — supposedly a vestigal remnant 
of ancient fear of animals. 
Many times a small twenty-months to two-year’s old 
baby will reject all toys for a favored one of its own devising. 
Thus, little Rebecca, whose father mistakenly brought her 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
a beautiful baby doll when he found her cuddling her crib 
blanket, found his gift received with momentary joy, but 
soon discarded, while she trailed the beloved blanket all 
over the house and refused to be separated from it. 
Play. From eighteen months on the child will more 
and more enjoy play, and next to love and physical care, 
happy play is the best thing in the world for a child, and 
the most important. It is good to accustom the runabout 
to play by himself and not to be dependent on older persons 
for his amusement. A child that has playthings he enjoys 
will contentedly amuse himself alone for a long time, re- 
peating the same action over and over — filling a pail with 
sand and emptying it again, pulling out a sliding box-cover 
and pushing it in again, drumming and drumming with 
a wooden spoon on an inverted dishpan, or rattling a stone 
inatin cup. Untiring repetition of an interesting act seems 
to be a characteristic of this age — perhaps it comes from 
the pleasure of acquiring skill. This form of concentration 
is a good thing to develop. 5 
From eighteen months to two years the child continues 
to be a climber, and a common form of father-and-child 
play is seen when the child mounts step by step from father’s 
feet to father’s shoulders when held by father’s hands. 
The baby will also climb on couches, beds, and stepladders. 
Unless his mother guards against it he will manage to stand 
on the seat of his own high chair, with the horrible risk of 
toppling over. 
Another form of play that will be enjoyed by the child 
is in attempting to imitate everything he sees anybody do. 
In this he will show surprising development of his powers 
of observation, and there seems to be in a child of this age 
what someone calls “an inward necessity’? — almost like 
a reflex action — to “go and do likewise” after the sensitive 
intelligence registers the impression of a novel gesture, 
action, or sound. This imitation is not yet the conscious 
acting of a part, as when later he will play at steam engine; 
it seems to be mere copy-cat repetition, but he loves to do it. 
Games. Though the baby ought at this time to do most 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    THE SECOND YEAR OF THE CHILD’S LIFE 83 
of his playing by himself, he should every day be given the 
chance of a couple of periods of real, social, organized games 
of some kind with father or mother. The mother will do 
well to study ‘‘Froebel’s Mother Play Book,” to get to the 
bottom of the fine philosophy not yet discredited by later 
scholars, and grow wise in the simple finger-games and other 
play-methods suited to the development of her child in 
the pre-kindergarten years. Games of ‘‘ Peek-a-Boo” and 
“Pat-a-Cake” will still be enjoyed, so will ‘All Gone,” 
the “Swing of Pendulum,” the “Falling Game,” and other 
plays where rhythmic motion is accompanied by rhythmic 
song. 
Games of “‘ Pat-a-Cake,’’ “ Hide and Seck,” “‘Tunnel and 
Meet,’’ and many of those listed in the last quarter of the 
first year will still be enjoyed. 
“Shoe the Horse, Shoe,” “This Little Pig Went to 
Market,” the finger games; dramatizations of “Ride a 
Cock-Horse to Banbury Cross,” and also: 
“‘Pace-a-pace the lady goes,” (with sedate riding on father’s knee 
or foot) 
“Trot-a-trot the gentleman goes,” (tempo increased) 
“Gallop and gallop and gallop the huntsman goes!” (con furore) 
and all such games with thrilling climax will be delightful. 
Ball games, rolling a ball from one to another and later 
throwing it, may soon be engaged in by parent and child. 
Let us refer to the paragraph on ‘‘Growth of the Brain,” 
page 74, for correlation with our often-repeated advice that 
the mother should still beware of too much game-playing 
with the baby. It is good that the child should learn to 
play these and similar games according to his ability and 
preference, it is good he should delight in them and laugh 
with pleasure at the climax, but if there are signs of excite- 
ment the game should be stopped, and also if there are 
signs of weariness. 
To take the child out-of-doors, or from one room to an- 
other, or to lay him on the grass or on a rug with a toy to 
play with by himself, are suggested as means to end the
-P-A-G-E-102
  84 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
game when the young brain is in danger of overstimulation 
or fatigue. 
So far as possible, quiet play by himself should be encour- 
aged, and such amusement may be prolonged to whatever 
extent the child desires.

  CuHaptrer IV 
THE CHILD FROM THE SECOND TO THE 
FOURTH BIRTHDAY 
Foods and Feeding 
The growing child, in proportion to its size, needs much 
more food than the adult, for it has to build as well as repair 
tissue. Four meals a day should be the regular schedule, a 
four-hour interval to be allowed between the heartier ones, 
and an interval of three or three and one-half between a light 
meal and the one that follows it. The youthful digestion 
is rapid; each meal, if conditions are right, will be completely 
disposed of before time for the next; and when four moderate 
meals are given rather than three big ones there is less 
danger of overloading the young stomach. 
The meal gradually to be omitted from the schedule of 
the preceding year is preferably the 10 o’clock “nightcap.” 
General Dietetic Rules for This Age. The meals should be 
varied, to stimulate varied digestive secretions, and also 
because monotonous diet is said to make monotonous minds. 
The variety, however, should be from day to day and from 
meal to meal, rather than in serving several different kinds 
of food at any one meal. 
The food should be appetizingly and daintily cooked and 
served; the nerves of taste in children are very sensitive, 
and food that is relished is better digested and assimilated. 
Foods rich in mineral salts should be provided, for the 
bones and the permanent teeth are in process of formation. 
Foods rich in vitamines should also be chosen; especially 
those where the “A” vitamine is present, which is essential 
to the growth and health of all animals, and is more particu- 
larly needed in the diet of children. Milk contains this 
vitamine, also the lime and other salts so much needed, and 
the child who has plenty of milk every day, good helpings 
85
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
of such greens as spinach or tender lettuce, and an orange 
or two, has a fairly good food insurance. 
Milk. A quart of milk in some form should be the 
child’s daily allowance. There is no objection to warming 
the milk slightly in cold weather, since gentle heating will 
not produce hurtful chemical changes nor destroy the vita- 
mines, but it should not be boiled. Junket desserts and 
milk puddings are good. 
Meats, Fish, and Eggs. A restricted helping of meat — 
not more than two ounces — may be given at dinner. Lamb, 
the white meat of chicken and turkey, and the more delicate 
fish, are permitted, and a small amount of tender beef may be 
given. (See list of Foods Forbidden, page 94-5.) All meat, 
poultry, or fish for a child should be broiled or roasted in 
preference to being boiled, and should never be dried. An 
egg, soft-cooked in the shell or poached, may be substituted 
twice a week for meat or poultry, but care should be taken 
not to give too many eggs or too much meat. An egg every 
day is often too much for a child of this age, and an over- 
large portion of meat at dinner may result in restless sleep 
at night — an indication, very often, of over-stimulation. 
Vigorous children who live an out-of-door country life can 
stand more hearty food than city-bred or delicate young- 
sters. There is but one food that the mother need hardly 
fear to give in excess: this is fresh, pure milk; and, as in the 
earlier years, it will pay to provide the best certified milk 
for the child. Milk soups and milk broths are good for 
children if not too highly seasoned. 
Fruits and Vegetables. All delicate and easily digested 
vegetables may be used. Asparagus tips, squash, string 
beans, stewed celery, spinach, fresh peas, and all others 
except those on the forbidden list. One green and one 
starchy vegetable (both are better when steamed or baked) 
should form part of the dinner, and fruit may be used for 
dessert, or at breakfast, or for both meals. Oranges, baked 
apples — or raw apples if very soft-fleshed — peaches, pears, 
grapes when seeded and prune pulp, are all recommended 
for children. Skins, and tough fibres should be avoided 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 87 
because apt to produce gas in the digestive tract, or in 
one form or another to disagree. Green peas should be sifted 
after cooking, as their skins are among the worst offenders — 
so are apple parings in most cases, also the skins of peaches, 
and the tough fibres of celery and lettuce. Very tender 
green lettuce, or young tender celery stalks may be chopped 
for sandwich filling. 
Cereals and Breads. Almost all of the cereals,with the 
possible exception of the very coarse ones used by adults 
to correct constipation, and the preparations composed in 
part of nuts, which the child is not yet ready for, should 
form part of the diet. The whole grains furnish minerals 
and vitamines, but they and all cereals used to make break- 
fast porridges should be thoroughly cooked, since they are 
swallowed without a pretence at mastication. Sugar or 
honey may be used sparingly on the child’s porridge, or, 
instead of this, chopped raisins or dates may be cooked with 
it to give a little sweetness, and to tempt children who 
dislike the morning cereal. Rice is an excellent grain for 
children; it is easily digested and does not cause flatulency, 
but the brown rice is preferable to the white, polished 
grain, which has been deprived of its vitamines. Similarly 
to be avoided are the whiter preparations of the common 
grains, which lack every trace of the delicate, inside bran, 
are vitamine-free, and have lost much of their nutritive 
properties. Nevertheless, it is sometimes found that even 
the slightly coarser cereal preparations disagree with chil- 
dren of three years and under, and the finer cereals have to 
be used for a time, gradually adding the others. Day-old 
bread in some form should be part of most of the meals, 
and Educator crackers and unsweetened zweiback are 
excellent. 
Fatty Foods. If the child has a quart of whole milk every 
day, with a little scraping of butter on his bread; also an 
occasional egg, or a small strip of toasted bacon fat; with 
or without a teaspoonful of olive oil imperceptibly added to 
his dish of steamed spinach, scraped carrot, or tender greens 
of any kind, he will have all the fat he needs at this age.
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
With city-bred children who are denied unrestrained romps 
in the open and who breathe a good deal of secondhand 
air, this amount of fat may be too much. 
Sweets. Little children, who squander energy in perpetual 
motion, need a quickly available source of the same. Sugar 
is a necessary and desirable part of the diet, and their 
natural craving and demand for sweet things indicates a 
real need of the system. Unfortunately there is a temptation 
to excess, and it is to the effects of yielding to this temp- 
tation that sweets have earned a bad reputation. Cane 
sugar is not the best form of sweet for the child, neither 
is it the worst. Honey is particularly good and a child will 
rarely overeat of it. The sugar content of sweet young 
carrots, of apples and other sweet fruits, of dates and prune 
pulp, is in pretty good form, preferable to that in rich jams 
and preserves, cake icings, syrups, etc. Simple homemade 
candy, like barley sugar, almond rock, peanut brittle, and 
the old-fashioned rock candy, are all wholesome in moder- 
ation, and the child may have a few pieces after dinner for 
a treat. French candies and confectioners’ candies are 
best omitted for the present, and the child should not be 
allowed to eat candy or sweets before a meal, between meals, 
or early in the meal. Simple ice creams are permitted once 
or twice a week. 
The following schedule of meals for a week is meant to 
be suggestive only.

Notes on Foregoing Menus 
If the breakfast hour is later, or the dinner earlier, the 
mid-morning lunch may be served in mid-afternoon. 
Up to four or five years old all fresh vegetables should 
be sifted or mashed, and after this tomatoes should still be 
sifted free from seeds. 
Sometimes when vegetables are present the use of milk 
at the dinner results in the generation of gas in the intesti- 
nal tract. If this occurs the milk may be served in the 
form of a pudding. 
Vitamines. The “A” vitamine (growth-promoting) is 
furnished by milk, cream, butter, eggs, whole grains and 
greens. “B” (antineuritic) is present in all fresh vegetables 
and fruits, in milk, and in meat, fish, and fresh foods of all 
kinds. The “C” or antiscorbutic vitamine is present in 
citrus fruits, in tomatoes, and generally in fresh fruits and 
vegetables. 
Minerals. Lime, sufficient for the needs of the child, 
is furnished in the daily quart of milk. Phosphorus is 
also present in milk, eggs, fish and meat; and iron is found 
in spinach and other greens, in dates and other dried fruit, 
and in the yolk of the egg, etc. 
General Plan of Menus. At least a quart of milk is used 
in some form every day. 
Either graham or whole wheat bread, homemade, is 
served at most, but not all of the meals. These breads 
furnish some of the most important and most needed min- 
erals, and to accustom the child to their use will form good 
dietetic habits. 
The meat dinners are followed by fresh fruit in some form 
for the sweet course; and when eggs form the main dish 
either tomatoes or oranges are included in the meal. Both 
are rich in the antiscorbutic vitamine, and their acid seems 
further to counteract the tendency of eggs to disagree 
with some children. 
A aweiback or two to nibble before the porridge comes on 
is good to encourage habits of mastication. Also, if the 
       
-P-A-G-E-112
        94 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
child is encouraged to eat the solid food first, before the 
milk is given, this will help to establish thorough mastication. 
Raw apples, at this age, often cause generation of gas in 
the intestinal tract, but the soft-fleshed kinds such as the 
Yellow Transparent, the Astrachan, the Delicious and 
others may be given experimentally in small portions, and 
if gas results, baked apples or apple sauce should take 
their place. Such fruits as the coarser-fibred plums, etc., 
if used liberally may also cause gas. Also, since the combina~- 
tion of fresh cherries and milk is poisonous to some persons, 
it is well to forbid cherries while the staple food of the child 
is still milk. 
Potatoes under some conditions cause intestinal fermen- 
tation, and when this is obsetved, rice, or well-cooked fine 
hominy or farina should be used for the starchy vegetable. 
Foods Forbidden Under Seven Years 
Some authorities forbid the following foods to children under 
seven years old, and in general all are agreed that to postpone their 
use until that time means playing safe.

Norr. —The basis for forbidding many of the foods listed is not 
that a morsel of cake, a taste of pie, an occasional piece of French candy, 
will be injurious to a healthy child of vigorous digestion, but rather 
that the sense of taste in a young child is one of his highest sources of 
pleasure, and if these unlawful delights are experienced all the plainer 
foods and simpler desserts will be despised, and the child made dis- 
contented, 
Dislikes of Children to Certain Foods 
While it is true that certain foods — normally wholesome 
and nutritious — are found to disagree with certain children, 
owing to constitutional peculiarity (or, some parents tell 
us, inherited antipathy), it is also true that such idiosyn- 
erasies are rare and most children who are brought up on 
wholesome diet and have never heard objections made to 
   
-P-A-G-E-114
    96 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
any article of food by older members of the family, will 
eat with relish what is set before them. A child’s highest 
and fullest development is arrested or hindered by being 
allowed to give way to abnormal likes or dislikes of food. 
It is particularly important that at this age the child 
should not be given highly-flavored dishes. They vitiate 
the palate and impair the taste for milk, eggs, cereals, and 
other less sapid foods. The child who has been fed properly 
from birth will find a high pleasure in very simple dishes, 
and all the variety needed may be obtained from the use 
of different cereals, meats, vegetables, and fruits, without 
extra condiments and seasonings. 
Nervously organized children, or children who are re- 
covering from illness, will often be finical and fanciful about 
their food, especially at this age. While a child is ailing 
or ill the mother is often obliged to humor small fads, but 
this should always be done without appearing to do so of 
set purpose. To compel a nervous child to eat food that 
he dislikes by the use of force or authoritative commands, 
may, at this impressionable time, be productive of great 
harm, and the nerve strain suffered by the child who is 
compelled to eat what he dislikes may be the cause of 
permanent nervous injury. Yet, to allow habits to be formed 
of rejecting wholesome and necessary food is to be unjust 
to the little one, and to run the risk of serious interference 
with natural development. Milk, the most important of 
all foods for little children during the years preceding second 
dentition, is most frequently the first food to be objected to. 
Its monotony palls on the delicate nerves of taste. A 
fanciful and pretty way of serving it often wins the day. 
One mother’s little three-year-old son, sitting up in bed 
for the first time after a critical illness, irritably refused 
this food, though the physician had emphasized its need. 
The mother served very slightly sweetened milk in pretty 
sherbert glasses, with a spoonful of beaten white of egg 
piled on top, placed the glass on a pretty plate with a gay 
paper napkin, set the whole on a small silver tray, called 
it “fairy ice cream,” and found it much enjoyed.
-P-A-G-E-115
        FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 97 
Another child who refused milk had hers served in a 
tall glass with two shining yellow straws, and called a 
cocktail. 
Sometimes a bit of jelly — made to adhere to the bottom 
of a cup by melting one of its surfaces — or a date, a raisin, 
or a slice of ripe, fresh fruit dipped in gelatine and similarly 
fastened to the bottom of the cup, and the child encouraged 
to drink to the end and find “‘a surprise,” will stimulate 
the emptying of the cup. Sometimes a child will eat milk 
in the form of junket when he will not drink it. 
Soft-cooked eggs are also apt to be disliked. An inventive 
mother mixed yolk and white thoroughly in a cup, then 
cut four narrow strips of bread for “soldiers,” a corporal 
and a corporal’s guard, the corporal distinguished by a 
gold helmet, bestowed by an invisible colonel on a visit 
to the colonel’s tent — the egg cup. It was great fun to 
bite off the corporal’s head, helmet and all, then have 
his guard one by one created corporals to suffer the same 
fate, then to begin again with the resuscitated corporal 
and proceed da capo until egg and bread-strips were “all 
gone.” 
Sometimes during these years a delicate child will be 
prescribed raw meat juice, such as the baby had in the 
second quarter. (See page 35.) This can be mixed with 
orange juice and served in a little red wineglass under 
some attractive fancy name. 
One of our Home Economics specialists suggests that 
small amounts of a new food be offered repeatedly until 
the habit of eating it is established; and that the optimum 
conditions for habit formation be established by pleasant 
surroundings and setting a good example. Good example is 
of all things the most potent. Our three- and four-year-old 
copy-cats will imitate the food habits of both grown-ups 
and other children, far quicker then they will attend to 
precepts. A visiting child who loves milk, and is incidentally 
(and not too ostentatiously) commended and praised for 
this amiable trait, will stimulate its imitation in another 
child.
-P-A-G-E-116
   
  98 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
A food that is disliked and one that is well-liked may be 
served on the same plate, with the understanding, honor 
bright, that both be eaten. Or the much-relished food may 
be withheld until the food objected to is eaten. Finally, 
the mother may have to steel her heart in armor and play 
the Spartan by removing the food without remonstrance 
or argument, and giving nothing instead until the next meal, 
when the rejected dish may be brought on again. To save 
the child’s face, it may be slightly camouflaged and named 
“An old friend with a new face.” This drastic remedy 
usually shows the child that the mother “means business,” 
but it should always be carried out good-humoredly and 
never with a high-handed attitude or one to provoke re- 
sentment. 
Tact, persuasion, reasoning, or camouflage, may be em- 
ployed with different children, and mothers have to develop 
inventiveness and imagination — but however it has to be 
accomplished, a child’s dislike to wholesome foods and, above 
all, to milk, must not be allowed to persist. Lastly, the 
child’s abnormality should never be fussed over, talked 
about, or made much of. Some children are sensitive to 
this and hurt by it. Others enjoy being in the limelight. 
In both cases the notice taken of it impresses the con- 
sciousness of the fault and increases the difficulty of over- 
coming it. 
Diet for Constipation 
During this period, or a year or two later, children often 
suffer for awhile from constipation. For this there is a 
physiological reason, so the mother need feel no alarm, but 
rather accept it as one of the queer phases of the child’s 
upward way. The mother should know that a dry, hard 
stool is quite as sure a sign of constipation as absence of 
movement. She will likely be told by her physician that 
the difficulty is better overcome by other means than drugs. 
To foster those good habits of regular evactuation recom- 
mended in a former chapter will do much towards pre- 
vention or relief, but regulation of the diet is essential. 
    
-P-A-G-E-117
        FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 99 
Increase of fat, especially cream, often helps. Thin cream, 
diluted half-and-half with water, may be substituted for 
milk at one meal. The fluids in the diet should be increased, 
water drinking between meals encouraged; and the juice of 
a small orange in half a glass of water may be given on 
rising. | 
Constipation may also follow the use of boiled milk, or 
of excess of the fine, white, starchy foods, and deficiency of 
greens and fresh fruits and vegetables; therefore graham 
and whole wheat breads, graham crackers, oranges and other 
fresh fruits, and stewed fruits for desserts, all will help to 
overcome the trouble. When elimination is not regular 
and complete there is more or less poisoning from re-absorp- 
tion of waste matters, to which the growing brain and nerves 
are highly susceptible. An irritable child and one hard to 
manage may be merely suffering from the effects of con- 
stipation. 
The Child’s Development During the Third and Fourth 
Years 
Old folklore taught that the child at three years old has 
made half his destined height. But there is no lore, old or 
new, that can set a sure standard for the height and weight 
of either present or future. Race, nationality, family, 
environment, and several other factors influence both, so 
that a leeway of an inch or more in height, and from one 
to three pounds in weight, is found on comparing the most 
carefully compiled averages from the official estimates in 
different American cities. After the child has mastered 
the art of walking, the weight for his height is now thought 
the better standard. Dr. William Emerson says: “It may 
be stated as a physiological principle that a body of a cer- 
tain height requires a certain weight to sustain it, and 
the most significant test of a child’s physical condition 
is the relation between his height and his weight.” At 
four years old the child that is three feet tall should weigh 
— the boy, thirty-one pounds, the girl, thirty. (See Table 
on page 105.)
-P-A-G-E-118
   
    100 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Yet, during these years and those to come, the mother 
will very likely observe that a parallel increase in height and 
weight rarely goes on at the same time. Like the achieve- 
ments of walking and talking, they take turn about. The 
child is likely to shoot up tall like a young growing plant 
in spring, and to increase in weight in autumn. There 
will be years when he will take a vacation from growing 
tall and will put on pounds and pounds in weight instead; 
there will be other years when this will be reversed — this, 
however, is anticipating. 
As the child lengthens upward from the beginning 
of his third year the mother will find herself losing her 
baby, with the disappearance of the soft, infantile roly- 
polyness. 
Walking and Talking. Early in the third year the child 
is usually graduated from the baby carriage, and is able to 
take short walks-out-of-doors and to do many short errands 
within doors. The mother who has had entire charge of 
her child often thinks she may now take him with her for 
a daily walk, or for marketing, shopping, or calling, and 
the nurse who wheels the carriage of another child will 
allow the three- or four-year-old to walk beside it for too 
long a stretch at a time. This is wrong, because, though 
natural, spontaneous play will not be pursued by the child 
to a hurtful excess, he is not yet ready for the steady grind 
of putting one foot before the other in a long, straight line 
for a formal walk. The arches of a child’s foot are delicately 
constructed and easily injured. Nature, consequently, has 
provided that little pad of firm fat which fills the arch of 
the foot from babyhood to five years old, when, as the bony 
framework strengthens, it gradually becomes absorbed. A 
steady, continuous walk wears down this protective cushion 
of fat and results in over-strain on the small feet. Hence, 
until the child is five years old and the fat pad is absorbed, 
do not urge the baby to take long walks. The longest 
walk for a child of three should be not more than half a 
mile. 
At three years old, if not before, the child should be able   
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 101 
to go upstairs and down on alternate feet, instead of one 
foot always in advance and the other made to follow it, 
as in the first attempts at stair ascents. Some children 
go upstairs on alternate feet long before the third birth- 
day, some’ not until later; it depends a good deal on 
the child and a good deal on the height of the stair-step. 
Do not urge, let the development take place naturally; 
it will probably come about some time during the fourth 
year. 
Children in the third year of life grow bolder in climbing 
and are often found in the most unexpected places. A baby 
of our acquaintance was discovered by her astonished mother, 
at the age of two years and two weeks, walking on the key- 
board of the piano. 
At about thirty months most children love to jump from 
a low stool or a low chair to the floor. 
Let us again remind the mother that to stand erect and 
walk on two feet is the most radical and important step in 
development'the child has made up to this time, or ever will 
make. There is a nervous strain from the physiological 
reversal which will be more or less evident in different 
children. The difficulties of the second summer are by some 
authorities attributed to this. 
Talking. The child during the third and fourth years 
should learn comparative mastery of the art of talking. 
This is the time to begin training in clear and correct enun- 
ciation and inflection, also in good grammar. The letter 
“r” is often a difficulty at this age, and the child will say 
“T am weady,” “TI climbed a wock,” “I went wound the 
wailing.” Take no notice, the “‘r” will be mastered in time. 
Some children are slow in learning to talk and have nothing 
much to say until late in infancy. Robert, at three years 
old, could not talk, and caused his mother much anx- 
iety until William came along, when he learned to speak 
from the example of the baby brother, who began quite 
early. 
Some mothers think they acquire merit by not allowing 
their children to use “baby talk.” They tell us they never 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
102 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
use it in speaking to the child, therefore he does not imitate 
it, and consequently his speech is ‘‘English undefiled.” 
Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t—a good deal 
depends on the baby. Calm and deliberate infants will 
not attempt a word before they can articulate it as clearly 
“as mother does,” while rash and impulsive ones plunge 
into a torrent of improvised speech for the rapid discharge 
of their feelings, careless as to whether it is or is not “under- 
standed of the people.” Baby talk, like milk teeth, drops 
off in time; we do not see that its use is a serious trans- 
gression. Good syntax ought to be taught, while pronunci- 
ation of hard words may be left for the natural development 
of the speech organs. 
‘The child at this age is rapidly gaining mastery over his 
body, and his mind is unfolding. At three years old a little 
child’s imagination begins to develop, and will be shown 
in combination with his faculty of imitation or mimicry. 
He will impersonate animals, imitate his father’s profession 
and the activities of other humans, he will play he is a steam 
engine or a motor car, he will copy the table manners of his 
family. 
Up to two years old, or sometimes three, a child’s memory 
is undeveloped, and most experiences — unless very vivid 
ones — are forgotten; but from two on the mother may 
look for evidence of real memory, and it will sometimes 
~be strikingly developed. 
The jealousy of the baby may persist. This age is a loving 
one; the child will use expressions and gestures of affection 
and desires them; consequently, when “petting” is going 
on, he must not be left out. The jealousy of a child at this 
age needs careful treatment. (See page 79.) Students of 
children believe that this young jealousy, if carefully 
eradicated now, will disappear before the child is four years 
old. 
The sense of rhythm, present long before, will increase, 
and children are commonly found tapping out rhythms with 
a wooden spoon on a dishpan, a drumstick on a drum (if 
a drum is included among their toys), with a fork on 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
        FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 103 
the table, or a shoe heel on the floor. Children at this 
age sometimes improvise a dance to strongly accented 
rhythmic music, and they will quickly memorize rhyth- 
mic or alliterative verse, with plenty of repetition and 
refrain. 
The first appetite for stories will be shown (see page 126), 
and among instances of development must be cited the 
origination of stories on their own account by song-loving 
and story-loving children. 
“T picked a ’ittle f’ower, 
An’ it widdered all up — 
I picked a ’ittle f’ower, 
An’ it died!” 
chanted Janet at thirty-eight months, delighting her father 
by her reproduction of the narrative forms of all primitive 
people, from Lamech down, who achieved the effect of 
emphasis and rhythm by saying the same thing over and 
over again. 
After the third birthday the mother may begin to watch 
for the birth of self-consciousness in her child. He will 
find himself some time between this and five years old, 
and will use the pronoun “I” with some sense of what it 
means. “I” is often used earlier through imitation, or if 
the child is taught to say it, but the watchful mother will 
recognize when the small son or daughter says it “with a 
difference” — when he knows “I am I.’ The young self- 
consciousness is sometimes interestingly demonstrated. 
Sometimes it is not evident to the looker-on, though the 
mother who is forewarned of its advent seldom fails to ob- 
serve it. Before this time comes is her best chance to form 
many good habits, physical and other, which will be dis- 
cussed in the section on Care and Training. i 
With self-consciousness will come a very definite appre- 
ciation of the difference between “mine” and ‘thine.” 
The child will enjoy pockets in his nighties and knickers, 
a box or drawer of his own, unrestrained rights to his own 
possessions. This is the time when a child insists on taking
-P-A-G-E-122
   
  104 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
dearly-loved objects to bed with him — perhaps through 
fear of their loss with his own loss of consciousness in sleep 
—perhaps through hope of extending through the night 
the delight of close possession. This is also the time when 
over-fussy mothers are afraid of possible germs in the 
woolly sheep or teddy-bear craved as bedfellow. If the, 
sheep or the bear have been exposed to contagious diseases 
they should, of course, be quarantined and sterilized, other- 
wise they are probably safer as a source of infection than 
father’s overcoat, or the dress mother wears to church. 
By all means let the child have these beloved objects to 
take to bed — physicians say they protect from temptations 
to masturbation. 
Social consciousness is shown by the child’s seeking the 
society of other children, and coéperating with them in 
play. Mr. Joseph Lee tells us that until the child approaches 
the completion of the third year he has little social sense 
toward his equals, but later observers, especially since the 
development of the Nursery Schools (see page 121), know 
that from the beginning of consciousness quite young 
babies show interest in one another. At this age the mother 
should see that the child has playmates of his own age or 
nearly that, for such companionship is needed for develop- 
ment. 
Social sensitiveness now is shown by shyness with stran- 
gers, and also by the child “showing off” through desire 
for praise or petting. 
Three years old is a runaway age, and officers in the city 
police stations tell us they have more lost children picked 
up, and distracted parents coming to seek them, than at 
any other age. Every child should be taught to tell his 
father’s name and his street and number as soon as he is 
old enough to learn them.

twelve months to six years, has been adapted from one

only, were removed.

Care and Training During the Third and Fourth Years 
Sleep. The child should now sleep not less than twelve 
hours in the twenty-four, and many children need more. 
The morning nap is gradually foregone after first dentition 
is complete, but the nap in the afternoon should be continued 
up to the fourth birthday and as long after as the child 
may be induced to take it. Foster the habit of sleep by 
regular hours. In the day nurseries the children go to sleep 
on the stroke of the clock, and the habit is quickly formed 
in newcomers by undressing them and putting them to bed 
when the time comes. A quiet, darkened room, at a tempera- 
ture of 60° F. or under, should help to induce sleep, but 
the quiet room need by no means be one where no noises 
are heard from the outside, or from the street. To train 
a child to sleep during unavoidable noises from street 
traffic, etc., is to form a useful habit for the future city- 
dweller. Avoid all exciting play immediately before bed- 
time. 
About this time, when imagination develops, the child 
may be afraid to go to sleep in the dark. He is sure to be 
if he has injudiciously been told bogey stories. If the child 
is afraid let him have a light. Imaginative youngsters 
often suffer tortures from the dark. It is an outcropping of 
one of the primitive instincts, and it is cruel to put a child 
to sleep in a dark room so long as he fears it. Do not try 
too soon to induce a semblance of fearlessness, the pent-up 
dread will be often behind the brave show-off, and will 
cause nervous hurt. Wait until this natural fear is lost 
in natural development. 
Children of three begin to remember their dreams, which 
are often very vivid and sometimes disturbing and of a

nature to cause fear. The mother ought, if possible, to be 
present when the child awakes from his nap, so as to bridge 
over the distinction between real and unreal, and often 
to reassure or comfort the dreamer. 
Bathing. The temperature of the daily bath after the 
second birthday may be decreased to 80° F., and after 
the third birthday to 75° F. While the child stands in 
the warmer water let him have a final cool sponge or spray 
over chest and shoulders, at 60° F., provided the reaction 
is good and that he enjoys a fine glow, increased by friction 
with the bath towel. 
Care of Hair. The child’s head should be brushed with 
a soft brush morning and evening, and this should be ap- 
plied to the head rather than to the hair. Once every day 
the mother should massage the scalp all over with her finger 
tips. The head may be washed once a week, by first wetting 
hair and scalp with warm water, then rubbing in a little 
soap jelly or lather made from very mild soap, rinsing this 
off with warm water, and repeating the rinsings until there 
is no longer any trace of soap in the water. Rain water 
or soft water should always be used. The successive rinsing 
waters (the number will depend on the abundance and 
thickness of the hair) should be less and less warm, and 
the last one cool, but not cold. The hair should be rubbed 
as dry as possible between warm towels, and the drying 
finished out-of-doors if the weather permits, but not in the 
sun. Need it be said that a child’s hair should not be arti- 
ficially curled or waved? To bob a little girl’s hair until 
she is ten years old, whether or not it is the prevailing fad, 
is a clean and comfortable fashion and is said to be good 
for the hair. (It is also said that persistent bobbing after 
the girl is twenty encourages early greyness). The mother 
who keeps her little girl’s scalp in healthful condition by 
brushing, massage, and shampooing, may expect to be later 
recompensed by the beauty of her daughter’s hair. 
Sea Bathing. After the child enters on his third year 
he may be allowed to play on the beach in a bathing suit 
until he is sufficiently accustomed to the water to give
-P-A-G-E-128
  108 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS” 
him a dip. He should never be forced into the water or 
frightened, since this would hurt him more than the bath 
would benefit. A child will copy other children who enjoy 
a sea bath, or he will copy his elders and thus learn the fun 
of playing in the big sea without nervous shock. Children 
are naturally water babies and love to play and paddle in 
water, whether salt or fresh. 
Care of the Teeth. At three years old the child should be 
taught to use the narrow little brush with only two length- 
wise rows of soft bristles, which is made for use with the 
milk teeth, and taught to brush them on inside and outside 
with an up-and-down motion. He should brush his teeth 
night and morning, and rinse out his mouth with water 
after every meal. 
As soon as the milk teeth are out the mother should take 
the child to a dentist every six months. Defects are some- 
times present that make mastication difficult and cause 
children to choose the softer foods, thus making malnutri- 
tion possible as well as ensuring the loss of the good habit 
of thorough chewing. The milk teeth, if decayed, should 
be filled; their untimely loss means unsymmetrical growth 
of the permanent teeth. 
Footwear. Note the right shape of the shoe as described 
in the last chapter, page 76. Beware of too small a shoe 
or one that is outgrown, at this stage of rapid growth, for 
the foot should not be cramped even if you have to throw 
away perfectly good shoes. Neither is it right to be too 
forehanded, and to allow overmuch for growth when the 
shoes are fitted, for a loose shoe helps to form bad habits 
of walking, and shoes that are too loose often cause blisters 
and chafing of the feet. 
The first spring-heel shoes may be put on at three years 
old, or between three and four. The child should always 
be taken to the shoe shop and fitted by a vendor who knows 
his business — do not buy shoes by guesswork. The foot 
covering should be porous, and rubbers immediately re- 
moved on entering the house. Sandals, worn without 
stockings, are excellent for summer wear in the country 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
  FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 109 
or in the city parks. The child may even go barefoot on 
the soft grass in warm weather in the country. 
Clothing in General. All clothing should hang from the 
shoulders, and nothing should be too long, too full, too 
heavy, or too handsome, to burden or restrict the child’s 
free play. Look out for dye in stockings which may hurt 
the delicate skin, and let the head covering provide shade 
for the eyes, which may not yet, without hurt to their sensi- 
tiveness, be exposed to the glare of open-air daylight. Dark- 
colored rompers or overalls should be provided to be worn 
when making mud pies, and while digging and grubbing in 
the clean dirt of the earth — all of them delightful activities 
to the child from two to four years and older. 
The little boy at three may go into belted blouses and 
knickers, and he often has his first real barber hair-cut, 
which is rather a pity, since this adds to the store of joyful 
memories and is not appreciated in fulness much before 
the sixth birthday. (See p. 183-4.) A girl from two on may 
wear little bloomer dresses. 
Chair at Table. After the child is three, an ordinary 
chair may be used for meals with the family in the dining 
room. The seat of that chair should be raised, preferably 
by some other means than the use of dictionaries, and a 
foot rest adjusted or a.footstool provided to support the 
feet. A child’s legs should not be allowed to dangle; the 
thigh bones are soft and easily curved. 
The mother will sometimes have four or five inches cut 
from the legs of the high nursery chair and the arms removed, 
thus adapting it to the child’s height, and leaving him a 
foot rest. Between four and five years old some mothers 
will get a carver’s chair, sometimes called an English serv- 
ing chair, for the child. This is higher than an ordinary 
chair and may be used by the child until he is eight or 
nine. 
Concerning Touching and Handling. The three- and 
four-year-olds are no less “touch hungry” than the toddlers 
of one and two, and their increased ability to explore and 
investigate by means of touch will often try the mother’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  110 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
patience and grace. It should help her to know that the 
child’s brain centers are developed by use of the hand; the 
child is learning about things, getting into harmony with 
his environment through the exercise of touch and feeling. 
Let her put the value of this development beside the ad- 
vantage of not having things tangible meddled with, and 
see which is of more worth—as was done instinctively 
by one mother whose small runabout girl loved, as do all 
children of this age, to make fingerprints on the window 
glass. “I get my windows all clean and bright,” she said, 
“and then Lucy spots the panes pressing her finger-tips 
against them. But all little children love to do that, and 
a touch of the cleaning cloth makes the window all right 
again. She ’ll shortly grow out of touching the glass.” 
When a mother is heard to say to a child, “You may 
look, but you must n’t touch,” she is hurting the child, 
unless the thing to be touched is hurtful. 
Curiosity. Another instinct now in evidence is curiosity, 
which our sages say is meant ‘“‘to bring the individual into 
harmony with his physical and social environment.” But 
when the runabout is a little Paul Pry, poking into every 
corner, alert to “listen in” to the conversation of elders 
and ask persistent and inconvenient questions, this grace 
of curiosity is likely to be treated as a defect. Again, be 
careful, mothers, not to repress instincts. 
Self-Help. After three years the child should learn to 
dress and undress himself, unless there are difficult garments 
that button in the back. At three and one-half years he 
should put on his own shoes and stockings, and wash, at 
least his hands. Some children learn much earlier, and one 
baby we know, nineteen months old, can put on her shoes 
and stockings though she cannot yet fasten the shoes. To 
teach these arts may call for long patience on the part of 
the mother, but the development will be good for the child. 
So will the sense of independence. A good way to teach 
the business of dressing is by beginning with the articles 
easiest to put on, whether these come in unbroken sequence 
or not. Make it into a game, give commendation for skill, 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
    FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 111 
and tell father about it at dinner or when next he has time 
to listen, — relating it incidentally as an item of interesting 
news. Do not overpraise for any form of good conduct 
lest the habit be formed of looking for praise and doing 
things for praise. 
Help to Others. A young aunt who had to lie on a couch 
for some weeks after spraining her ankle, had for several 
hours of each day only the company of a three-year-old 
nephew. He learned to do many small services for her, 
to fetch books, pillows, sewing materials, and glasses of 
water; to pull up and down shades and adjust curtains, 
and even to undertake adventures in shopping at a near-by 
store. The spirit of helpfulness was quickly and beautifully 
developed in the child, he experienced the pleasure of service, 
and quickly assumed the pride of responsibility in the care 
of his aunt. Children naturally love to help, and even 
quite little ones are happier if they are given small responsi- 
bilities, very light household tasks ‘‘to help mother.” It 
will be frightfully troublesome for the mother, but it will 
be very good for the child. 
There are, however, tasks and tasks. Among those not 
to be recommended are the sewing of patchwork squares, 
which an old lady tells us she was set to doing at three 
years old. Forms of help to others that call for varied 
activities, for large movements, for quick and striking re- 
sults, will be more in accord with the development of the 
child at this age. 
Concerning Over-Excitements. Children of this age should 
be most carefully protected from over-excitement of all 
kinds, from getting nervous, anxious, or “worked-up.” 
After such an excitement as a fit of crying the child needs 
extra sleep, and some extra nourishment of a kind to be 
easily digested. (See p. 72.) 
Don’t take such young children to the circus. The per- 
formances are lost on some of them and over-excite others. 
But even from thirty to thirty-six months old the circus 
parade may be enjoyed without harm. If the child is ex- 
cited by the parade, by play or games or novelty, extra
-P-A-G-E-132
  112 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
sleep and extra nourishment are likewise needed. A cup 
of warm milk is an excellent prescription after excitement. 
Concerning Fear and Nervous Aversions. Again let us 
pray the mother to shield the child from emotions of fear 
and dread. Let us beg her to read again the discussion of 
fear on pages 79 and 106. Example is potent at this age 
and she should restrain her own fears — if she has any — 
and her brave assumption of fearlessness, if persisted in, 
will cure them. Ignorant mothers and nursemaids often 
teach little children fear of harmless insects, of frogs and 
toads and worms, instead of pointing out their beauty and 
usefulness. We have known many nursemaids train children 
in aversion to the beautiful dandelion blossoms, which are 
so attractive to unspoiled children at this age. These are 
the right years to train in both the courage which is fearless- 
ness, and that which is an overcoming of fear. It is the age 
to inhibit aversion and prejudice. 
Fear is an ancient instinct, at one time a means to safe- 
guarding the life of the individual. It is now regarded as 
one of the instincts to be overcome, except when later it 
occurs in a highly-spiritualized or altruistic form, such as 
fear of personal sin or weakness, fear of hurt or injury to 
another. But, being one of the basal instincts, it keeps 
cropping out during early childhood and any strange or 
unusual experience often produces fear. It is well known 
that a child who has had a fall is often more frightened 
than hurt and it is far from a far-fetched metaphor to say 
that the mother who ‘“‘kisses the part to make it well” is 
illustrating the casting out of fear by love. 
Concerning Nervousness Due to Imitation. In a former 
chapter mention was made of the unconscious absorption 
by children of the unwholesome emotions of an adult. 
(See page 52.) At this age of imitation there is danger 
that nervousness may be contracted purely through imi- 
tation of its symptoms in a grown-up. Dr. George K. 
Pratt (Medical Director, Massachusetts Society for Mental 
Hygiene), says children do not inherit nervousness from 
parents, but at this plastic and susceptible age they contract
-P-A-G-E-133
    
FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 113 
the neurotic type, the nervous mannerisms, from having 
these constantly before them in some member of the family. 
Unless a nervous and hysterical mother now learns self- 
mastery, the alternative is to keep the child away from 
her, if he would not perhaps be handicapped for life. 
Concerning Contrariness. During this period or the next 
a child often has curious fits of contrariness and takes 
pleasure in doing exactly the opposite of what he is told. 
“Don’t walk in the wet grass,” stimulates an immediate 
run through the wet grass; “Don’t touch the knife,” and 
the knife is quickly seized. Negative commands are often 
the cause of negative response. Try forming the habit of 
giving positive ones. Sometimes a bored child is contrary 
for the sake of introducing variety into life. Then, to make 
a game of it and deliberately order “Don’t play with your 
ball,” “Don’t eat this apple,” in a spirit of fun, will often 
work wonders. When these means fail, simply to let the 
child alone and take no notice while the fit is on, but later 
to reason gently and lovingly during a pliant hour, will 
eventually effect a cure. 
Formation of Habits 
It is said that physical habits are easiest to form and 
foster when the child is three years old, fairly easy to form 
when he is four, and a good deal more difficult if left until 
after six. The mother should therefore take advantage 
of the child’s present pliability, and should try now to 
ingrain the habits which should be kept up through life, 
such as the following: 
Mastication. The child should be taught to chew his 
food thoroughly and should be given foods like zweiback, 
Educator crackers, and others to encourage the habit. He 
should not be allowed to hurry or be hurried at meals, nor 
should the intervals between them be so long that he will 
come to table ravenously hungry and irresistibly tempted 
to “gobble.” 
Good Table Manners. Little children quickly learn to 
be proud of being able to eat and drink nicely, to avoid
-P-A-G-E-134
  114 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
spilling things, smearing hands or faces, and making crumbs. 
They should learn how to use spoon and fork correctly; 
to dip up soup from the far side of the spoon and eat it 
from the side nearest; to eat cereals and puddings with a 
dessert spoon rather than a teaspoon; not to allow a tea- 
spoon to stand in the cup, and not to use it with too much 
energy in stirring; never to eat “bite and sup” fashion; 
never to reach or grab for anything. They should learn to 
touch the napkin lightly to the lips before and after drink- 
ing; to ask politely for anything needed and to return 
thanks politely when helped; to place the knife and fork 
parallel on the plate when the meal is finished; to ask leave 
to be excused before scrambling from their chairs; — these 
and all other rules for table behavior should at this time 
become second nature to the child, to be performed un- 
consciously and without difficulty for the rest of his life. 
Posture and Carriage of the Body, etc. The child should 
be trained to stand erect, square on both feet, head up, 
with back flat, and body erect. Neither toeing out nor 
toeing in nor excessive swinging of the arms while walking 
should be permitted; the child should learn to walk with 
toes pointed forward as straight as an Indian, and as free. 
His chair should be adapted to sitting well back, with feet 
firm on the floor. He should breathe through the nose and 
inhale full, deep breaths. The use of both hands should 
be encouraged. Use pictufes of children in graceful atti- 
tudes to encourage imitation. 
Punctuality. Punctual habits of sleeping, waking, eat- 
ing, etc., are some of the easiest to form. Again to go to 
the day nursery for illustration, we find that there, if the 
afternoon nap-time is overlooked, the children will drop 
off to sleep in their chairs, or on the floor. The vegetative 
functions of the body learn to make prompt response to 
punctually observed hours, and the child will sleep, wake, 
evacuate, develop appetite— it is hardly too much to 
say he will even digest his food — according to schedule. 
Courtesies to Elders. One of the first habits for a child 
to form is not to cross in front of anyone if it can be avoided, 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
        FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 115 
and to apologize if it is unavoidable. The boy should 
learn when and how to raise his cap or remove it — the 
girl, when and how to make a pretty curtsey. Both should 
learn to open the door for an elder, to place a chair or foot- 
stool, to rise when spoken to, how to return thanks, to 
apologize, to answer an interrogation politely, to use the 
name of the person whom they answer or interrogate, and 
even how to disagree without contradicting. Many of these 
and other small courtesies may be learned in the form of 
a game. 
Neither is it too soon to begin at this age to inculcate 
other habits, such as those of patience, perseverance, cour- 
age, honesty and reverence. 
sy How Best to Form Habits. The child at this age is naturally 
imitative, and the best of all good ways to train him is by 
example. He is a natural copyist; see to it that he has only 
things that are right and good to imitate. Let him learn 
to stand and walk “like father,” to behave at table, to be 
punctual and courteous like some loved older person, or the 
child next above him in age. Let him copy good English 
from his parents. Unless this, as well as habits of courtesy 
are acquired at home, they will not be learned at school, 
for imitation of the voice, manner, and behavior of parents 
has a stronger influence than formal precept. Also, the 
custom of using towards the little ones the same courtesy 
we grown-ups use towards one another (or towards company) 
is one of the things that children at this imitative age are 
quick unconsciously to copy, so that fine politeness be- 
comes reflex action. Why should a little child be rudely 
told to “Shut the door,” to “Get up and give me that 
chair,” to “Get out of my way,” when a polite form of 
request will be found more productive of glad and willing 
obedience. 
The habit of obediene®) should at this age be almost 
automatic, and should be the fruit of training from birth. 
A woman who has been many times a mother says that 
perfect regularity in hours for sleeping, bathing, feeding, 
etc., is the best way successfully to initiate obedience.
-P-A-G-E-136
   
  116 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Up to four years old, or when self-consciousness is markedly 
‘developed, such obedience should be natural and unques- 
tioning, with no time wasted in discussion and argument. 
“Children accept the inevitable and are rested by the 
regular,” says Mrs. Cabot. (“Seven Ages of Childhood.”’) 
If the mother tries so far as possible always to give posi- 
tive rather than negative commands, she will more easily win 
obedience. Instead of saying: ‘Don’t drag that rug about 
the floor,” or “Don’t touch my dress with your dirty hands,” 
she would better say, in an inviting way and as though it 
were the most ‘delightful thing in the world to do, “Put the 
rug back before the fireplace. That is where it belongs.” 
With the child under four the command may be made 
more attractive by saying: “Now take the rug home again 
to its place. That is where it lives and likes to be.” Or, 
“A clean dress should be touched only with clean hands, 
and hands that are not clean should be kept away from it.” 
Further, the child of this age is able very clearly to realize 
the distinction between ‘‘mine” and ‘‘thine,” and should 
be trained to respect the property of others while being 
allowed freedom to do what he likes with his own. 
Training Out of Faults and Into Virtues. A desire for 
applause, a demand to “Watch me jump,” to “See, see my 
house I built,’ comes from an instinct for the stimulus of 
sympathy, ‘‘as aid,” says one of our philosophers, ‘to 
self-preservation through self-realization.” It should not 
be dwarfed through focussing on self. “That’s a good 
jump,” rather than “You can jump well.” “That’s a 
fine house of blocks,’’ not ‘You are a wonderful builder.” 
Beware of causing hurt to the child by stimulating self- 
conceit lest he become too dependent on approval rather 
than from experiencing joy at the achievement. (See “ Re- 
wards and Punishments,” page 118-19.) 
In fostering a virtue, try to make its practice cause 
pleasure. This means that virtues vary with the phase of 
development, and there are some which are hardly to be 
successfully achieved at the age of three. One of these is 
unselfishness. To compel a child of three to four to share his 
    
-P-A-G-E-137
  FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 117 
candy when he hates to, may be to sow seeds of rebellion 
against sharing with others in a later period. But a loving 
and affectionate child of three may be trained to give by 
experiencing pleasure in the feeding of pigeons, little chickens 
or young animals; from this to pleasure in giving to a smaller 
child, or to someone he loves who will demonstrate pleasure 
in his gift. 
At two years old a little child knows very well when it 
is best to obey, and when and how much latitude it may 
dare. The mother should be thoughtful in making com- 
mands, but once made let her stick to them. Ordinary 
- behests, such as those made every day, to put away toys, 
to take off rubbers, to sit or stand or eat properly, ought 
to be obeyed at once, but when a strange or novel order 
is given, like “Fetch me the red pillow from the parlor 
couch,” time has to be given for this to sink in, to be assimi- 
lated by the young intelligence. Be very patient if the 
child in such a case seems slow to obey. 
Many young faults are of physical origin, and will be 
outgrown. Many small peccadillos can be loved out of 
a child. When some friends of ours sowed grass seeds in 
their front plot, and weeds came up, too, they smiled at our 
counsel to uproot them, saying a few weeds always come 
up when a plot is seeded and may best not be paid any 
attention to, except indirectly and by way of careful culti- 
vation of the good grass. So with many of the small faults 
of childhood: they are better not fussed over and impressed, 
but rather dealt with indirectly, by encouragement of the 
virtues of the then present age. 
These are also the years of prevention, for tendencies, if 
not character, are fixed by six years old, and the mother 
who shields her child from small offences as she would 
from contagious sickness, who enters into his life with 
understanding sympathy, is doing much in the way of 
painless eradication of faults, in that the tendency to them 
may be atrophied through never being indulged. She is 
besides keeping the child’s brain free from impressions of 
struggle and rebellion, thus saving him from the bad conse-   
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  118 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
quences of being at this age either victor or vanquished 
in a contest of wills. 
Reward and Punishment 
Earl Barnes and others who have made a special study 
of children say that even after six years old a child does 
not understand punishment except as a form of revenge 
on the part of the grown-up, a “getting even, a wanton 
exercise of the power of the stronger.” 
“The happy child,” says Madame Montessori, “needs 
neither punishment nor reward.” A thoughtful nursery 
school teacher confesses that she never punished a child 
without afterwards seeing that she was herself responsible 
for the misdemeanor of the child, because she controlled 
the environment. 
The atmosphere of the rightly ordered home, of the 
mental states of those around them, deeply affect the char- 
acter and the emotional life of a little child during the 
unconsciously formative years. A child quickly responds 
to-suggestion-and_can_readily be distracted from wrong- 
doing by..an_interesting story-or-a-gay.song at the psycho- 
logical. moment;- and an invitation to the swing or a toss 
into the air will often banish evil humors before the child 
knows he is threatened by them. Also, the badness_of 
vigorous and healthy children often means.only that stored 
energy is finding an outlet. A minister-father kept all the 
psalm and hymn books used in family prayers in a room 
at the top of the house, whence it was the duty of his six- 
year-old son to fetch them, and the exercise was an insur- 
ance of good behavior during the morning orisons. Another 
parent used to send the little daughter, when she threat- 
ened to be bad, on an errand to the store, to the barn, or 
the garden, saying, ‘She will see so much that is interest- 
ing and wonderful that by the time she comes back her 
badness will have evaporated.” 
Besides being watchful to avoid the causes and occasions 
of small peccadillos, and skillful in shielding her child from 
them, the mother should further have insight enough to 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
        FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 119 
recognize that irritation is often a symptom of fatigue or 
hunger — perhaps of sleepiness; that plain “ugliness” may 
indicate a disordered stomach; and that certain forms of 
troublesome naughtiness proceed from some one of the 
natural instincts, most frequently from the instinct to 
examine by touch, and thus gain knowledge by what may 
well be called ‘‘first-hand” investigation of some novel 
and interesting substance. In all such cases the mother 
should know that to tamper with the wholesome instincts 
is a pretty dangerous thing, and that they may not be 
repressed without hurt to the child. 
Also, during the first six or seven years of life, or while 
the child delights in make-believe, or playing a part, his 
enjoyment of dramatic impersonation may be made use of 
by the mother, who, when Bobby or Mollie is very naughty, 
can pretend this is a strange child from Bad-Land, who be- 
haves so differently from her own well-conducted boy or 
girl. She can feelingly express her wish for the return of 
this paragon, and when it takes place welcome him back 
lovingly. This make-believe on the part of the mother 
will interest the child, will divert his attention from his 
own perverseness, and though for awhile he may continue 
to play the bad-boy part, it will be in conscious assumption 
of it, and he will quickly make the “right-about face” 
for the sake of entering into a new character. 
When there are symptoms of a return of the bad fit the 
mother may say: “Oh, here’s that horrid boy trying to 
get in again! Let’s run away before he catches us,” — 
and invite the child to a race from his adversary. ercise 
is an excellent remedy for many forms of naughtiness. 
Some of our Puritan parents question the morality of 
rewards and ask whether rewards are not bribes. By no 
means is this so. Rewards are consequences, and — like 
punishments when these are necessary — should ensue as 
the natural sequence of conduct. Whether child or grown- 
up, everybody works for reward. But there are rewards 
and rewards. At the Habit Clinics the gold stars are found 
powerful incentives and are used as aids to the formation
-P-A-G-E-140
   
  120 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
of desirable habits. A certain number of gold stars has a 
purchasing power: they can be traded for some desired 
plaything. In the nursery school the less tangible rewards 
of approval or disapproval are found equally potent. A 
smile is a reward, a ‘No, that’s not nice,” is a punishment. 
One of the women who is doing admirable pioneer work 
in the development of these schools in America, tells of a 
little girl who in the nursery school had learned, for the first 
time, to eat everything that was set before her. Day after 
day the child would take her empty plate to the young 
teacher and display it with a happy face and a triumphant, 
“See!” Her reward was an inward joy — perhaps in con- 
quest, in self-overeoming — who knows? It was a joy in 
something higher, more imponderable and permanent, than 
gold stars. 
We in our blindness have formed habits of thinking that 
very young children cannot be appealed to on a moral or 
spiritual side. Those who as nursery school teachers have 
cast off preconceived ideas about little children are dis- 
covering that they make a higher and finer response to 
the higher and finer appeal. 
Nursery Maids and Nursery Schools 
If a nursemaid is a necessity, it is not too much to say 
she should be chosen prayerfully. There are now specially 
diplomaed, specially trained and certified nurses turned 
out from six months’ (!) intensive work in a day nursery. 
From these a mother may possibly be able to select a gentle 
girl, a natural lover of little children, who is teachable as 
to their treatment, and the mother may work together 
with her for a month or so. Young college girls and others 
are often found willing to be “mother’s helpers,” and the 
girl who deserves the name is a veritable treasure, and, 
next to the children themselves, should be considered the 
most valuable of the parents’ possessions. 
One of the most serious lacks that observation has taught 
us is common among nursemaids is lack of natural affection 
or love for the child — and love is as necessary to the child 
    
-P-A-G-E-141
  FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 121 
as food. These maids also seem to think they acquire merit 
by training children to instant obedience to commands 
usually uttered imperiously. (See page 115, under “ Habits.”’) 
A woman who is wise and experienced in dealing with small 
children, tells us to beware of the maid with whom children 
are excessively well-behaved and obedient, and who, when 
relieved of her presence obviously “let go.’’ See page 183 
for comments on relaxation as indicative of a previous 
state of repression which should not be the prevailing 
atmosphere. 
The Nursery School. Companionship with other little 
children, in small groups, not larger than ten, is one of the 
needs of our small people, and a need that it is of the highest 
importance should be fulfilled. It comes next to fresh air 
and sunshine. Such companionship is found in the nursery 
school, where the child is wholesomely initiated into social 
life with his compeers. 
It is said that the child from the first to the third years 
learns more than he ever will during the years to come. - 
A good deal of what he should learn will be acquired in the 
nursery school, where the aim is to teach habits that will 
go with the child through life, and where the methods are 
based on well-thought-out child psychology. A mother will 
do well to send her child to such a school. for at least a 
year during this period, but we think preferably for the 
morning session only, unless the mother is the wrong kind 
or“is compelled to be a wage-earner. The mother herself 
can learn a lot from the nursery school and should 
make a point of attending and helping with the children. 
There are besides, parent-teacher meetings she should 
attend. 
She should choose the school for its teacher. When the 
child comes to high school age, anyone with common-sense 
and subject-matter is good enough for an instructor when 
a better is not available, but it takes an artist to teach little 
children in nursery school. ‘It calls,” someone says, “for 
a woman with a child-heart, who is also a poet and a 
philosopher.” (See “ Kindergarten,” page 151.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    122 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Toys, Play, and Games from Two to Four Years Old 
Playthings of large size that call for movements of the 
larger muscles are best adapted to little children. Get for 
the three-year-old a lot of wooden blocks, made by the 
carpenter, for the large sizes cannot be bought. Blocks 
6 x 3 x 2 are none too large, and two or three hundred none 
too many to order, for the child will use them for the next 
six or seven years. (See H.C. Wells, “Floor Games’’; and 
L. H. Gulick, ““The Philosophy of Play.”’) 
The rocking-horse for indoors, the kiddie car, velocipede, 
and swing for out-doors, are joy-bringers at this age of in- 
creased activity. They are good investments. It will be 
years before the child will outgrow the horse, and the time 
should never come when he will be too old for the swing. 
The sand pile too, is one of the stand-bys for all children, 
little and larger. It should now be increased in size, and 
the child may have a wooden shovel to dig with, and a 
larger pail. Choose large-sized toys and playthings rather 
than small. The little child likes to handle big things, his 
muscles call for them. 
From three to four small boys love to trundle an old 
motor tire, and little girls make the first clumsy attempts 
with the skipping-rope. Teddy-bears and indestructible 
dolls are good toys and will stand lots of rough usage — 
though we know of more than one Teddy-bear hugged to 
death. Balls of rubber to bounce, and of wood, big and 
brightly painted, to throw, roll, and run after, should be 
added to the child’s treasures; and large beads of colored 
glass, too big to be swallowed, too strong to be easily broken, 
are delightful to string and play with in many ways. Empty 
spools, too, should be saved for the toy-box, and most of 
the plays and playthings of the preceding age will still give 
pleasure. 
For quiet play children love to work with the patent 
modelling clay, with colored crayons, color-tops, peg boards, 
blunt-pointed scissors for riots of cutting-up, etc. 
Do not give toys too costly or beautiful for free use. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
     FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 123 
Avoid the expensive mechanical toys that perform some one 
spectacular feat on being wound up— money is wasted 
when spent on these, for the child soon tires of them — as 
he is apt also to tire of high perfection or vraisemblance 
in any toy. Imagination is rapidly developing and needs 
food to work on, hence the animals of indefinite form, the 
grotesque shapes that shape have not, and that can be 
called cats, bears, or elephants at will, are now just right 
for the child. At this age, too, he will be likely to choose 
for toys such domestic necessities as potato mashers or Dover 
beaters in preference to playthings especially manufac- 
tured for his delectation. Let him have them; they will 
probably be cheaper and surely more to his taste. Neither 
should the parent feel troubled when gifts are diverted 
from their original use, when the sand pail is only regarded 
as a helmet, or the shovel as a doll. Mr. Lee (“Education 
Through Plays and Games”) advises us to give the right 
things, but to leave the children alone to use or even misuse 
them. 
Plays and Games. The child now is learning physical 
mastery of his body. Consequently he delights in running, 
jumping, using his arms in wide, free movement. His 
power to speak, to sing, to understand and be understood 
in the vernacular is increased. Also, imagination begets 
dramatization and the acting of a part. Lastly, he craves 
the society of his fellows; his social instincts are strong. 
Scope for all these steps of development should be afforded 
in the play and games of these years. The following are 
suggested: 
Games of capture and pursuit in their simpler forms begin 
to be played as soon as the child is old enough to run, 
whether with the hare or with the hounds, These running 
and chasing games may be played by three: the child run- 
ning away; the nurse, an older child, or any interested party 
of the third part, as pursuer; the mother, as sanctuary or 
haven of refuge. Dr. Gulick has noted the delight of the 
child in the pseudo-sensation of fear, which his small daughter 
assumed and actually experienced when chased by her 
    
-P-A-G-E-144
   
  124 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
sister, while she knew she was secure from all harm. So 
little Robert, a friend of ours, at thirty months old delighted 
to have his governess run after him, would shriek with joy 
at his own realization of fear, and invite her again and 
again to the game. 
The simplicity of ‘‘Pat-a-Cake” now gives place to the 
more complex of the hand-clapping games, and ‘‘ Pease Por- 
ridge Hot,” etc., will be played for delight in its rhythm, 
the coincidence of the striking motions with the empha- 
sized words, and the ever-increasing tempo, kept up until 
one of the players gives out. 
Imitation gives way to a truer dramatization. Mr. Lee 
justly observes that when a child gets astride a stick to 
play galloping, plays horse and driver with another child, 
puts on spectacles and plays “grandfather,” or hat and 
plays minister or doctor, or when little girls play ‘‘ladies” 
and make social calls, it means that a child somehow gets 
a better understanding of the character impersonated. 
This instinct to play many parts is a phase in his develop- 
ment and one of no small importance. 
In the circle games the child graduates from the mother- 
and-baby games and those played by himself, into the 
wider social group. Children of three and four particularly 
love the ring games, those age-old plays of the childhood 
of the race where the charm of rhythm of movement and 
song and the freedom from emulation are in accord with 
their present instincts, which are now codperative rather 
than competitive. 
“Hide-and-seek’’ will still be played, ball-play will pro- 
gress from rolling to throwing and catching, and all nat- 
ural children love to play in mud and dirt and to grub 
in the earth. Let them do it, in clothes that won’t be 
hurt by it. 
Pictures, Rhymes and Stories 
Pictures. Man made pictures before he could write, and 
children enjoy them before they enjoy stories. To train 
a child to love pictures, to make sure that he shall be familiar 
    
-P-A-G-E-145
     FROM SECOND TO THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY 125 
with the best, is the duty of the parent who has a right 
conception of his child’s rights. 
In the child’s love for pictures there are three well-defined 
stages: First, the pleasure taken in recognition of objects 
common in his environment, pictures of other children, 
of domestic animals, birds — anything he sees every day, 
but preferably living things. 
Second, as soon as curiosity develops enough to stimulate 
interest in the as yet unknown and unfamiliar, the child 
likes pictures of the children of other countries. Of Dutch, 
Japanese, etc., in their distinctive dress; of gnomes, fairies, 
and other characters in the rhymes and stories he knows 
best; also of elephants, giraffes and other strange animals. 
Third, after children enjoy the pictures that illustrate 
a story, they like to whet the growing imagination on the 
picture that itself tells a story, or around which a story 
may be woven. 
These three phases overlap, as do most phases in de- 
velopment. Even we grown-ups 
“|. . we’re made so that we love 
First when we see them painted, . . .” 
the familiar things of our environment. We enjoy pictures 
of the new and strange, and pictures that tell a story — 
though by this confession we incur the scorn of artists. 
Up to almost the end of this period the child’s interest 
will be chiefly in pictures of the familiar, and they demand ' 
rich coloring. The Mother Goose pictures will be in high 
favor, also those in the Kewpie books and the Kate Green- 
away series. Pictures of children at play, and of dogs, 
cats, domestic animals and others that are familiar, in their 
natural form and not dressed up. Two or three books, 
with pictures well-drawn and colored in bright, clear tints 
free from gaudiness, may with much advantage be provided 
for the child. To insist on freshly-washed hands and care 
in their use will help to form habits of respect for books. 
Children display a curious sense of the real in pictures; 
as when one of them inquired one morning on seeing again 
    
-P-A-G-E-146
    
    126 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
a picture of the Infant Samuel he had been shown the day 
before, “Did he pray all night?” 
Rhymes. With all their faults the Mother Goose stories 
have proved themselves the right literary aliment for 
children at this age, and properly expurgated editions are 
now used by the most careful mothers. ‘They have per- 
fect rhyme and rhythm and just about enough excitement 
to delight but not to disturb children,” says one of our 
authorities. Some children never tire of having these 
rhymed stories read to them, several will memorize them, 
and others are able to pick out in the book their favorite 
jingles, recognizing them from their appearance on the page, 
and they will “go through the motions” of reading them, 
following the lines with a finger in a dramatic pretence, 
and often deceiving an unsuspecting adult. 
Stories. As soon as a little child can understand simple 
spoken language he ought regularly to be told stories in 
prose, animal and other easy-to-understand tales of elves, 
brownies, and fairies.

        CHAPTER V 
THE CHILD FROM THE FOURTH TO 
THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 
Foods and Feeding 
Up to the age of six — perhaps a year longer — the pri- 
mary need of the child is physical care, particularly along 
the line of nutrition; for it is believed that right feeding and 
care during these years affect later growth and tend to 
establish normal development of all the organs. Also at this 
time, much more easily than later, constitutional defects 
may be eradicated and the foundation laid of sound bodily 
health. 
The result of improper feeding in childhood is not always 
evident until later in life, when dyspepsia, malassimilation, 
and other ills are apt to be attributed to some immediate 
cause rather than to the remote one of improper food in the 
early years. Moreover, the child that is well-fed and cared 
for is likely to have a better mentality, a better disposition, 
and a better character development than the one who is 
improperly nourished and wrongly treated. 
Hence, in these papers, food is given first place. 
Even now, after years of preaching and teaching, there 
are still young mothers who think the healthy little son or 
daughter, during the years from four to six, may be given a 
small helping of everything on the family table. To do this 
would be an unfortunate mistake, not only because many, 
grown-up foods are unsuited to youthful digestion, but be- 
cause if once the habit is formed for over-sweet or complex 
or too highly flavored dishes, the child will lose relish for 
simple things, particularly for milk, which should be its 
chief food until at least six years old. This justifies the ob- 
jection to a once-in-a-while feast on cake, pie, or rich candy, 
127
-P-A-G-E-148
    
    128 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
even in the case of a strong child who may be perfectly well 
able to digest them. (See note, page 95.) Many mothers 
reform the family table to a greater or less extent, with 
proportionate advantage to the family health, while the 
children are young. 
Foods Allowed and Forbidden. The list of foods allowed 
and forbidden at this time remains the same as that given 
on page 94-5 in the last chapter, with the following alter- 
ations and additions: 
The sifting of fruits and vegetables, except tomatoes, which 
should still be sifted free from seeds, may gradually be omitted, 
unless gas is generated, or they are found in any way to disagree. 
Peas, unless sifted, still may cause flatulency. 
Strawberries and blueberries may be allowed in small quantities, 
but not raspberries, gooseberries, or others with larger and harder 
seeds, unless these are sifted out. 
A scrambled egg, provided it is scrambled in thin cream or milk 
— not butter — and is cooked only to a jelly-like consistency, may 
be substituted for the soft-boiled or poached. 
Some authorities at this age permit an egg for breakfast every 
day, but this is often too much except for the vigorous, country- 
bred child. 
Stews of lamb or beef, with rice, barley, or potatoes, and young 
carrots and delicate turnips, may be served once a week for dinner. 
Dried peaches, apricots, etc., soaked overnight in cold water and 
then slowly cooked until soft, may be used occasionally in winter 
when fresh fruits are not available. 
Peanut butter is allowed in moderation. 
Desserts of Indian pudding, chocolate cornstarch, baked banana, 
or quite ripe raw banana, may be added once in a while for variety. 
Cornmeal muffins, well baked, may be included in the bread- 
stuffs, and ginger cookies, molasses cookies, and plain ginger cake, 
are permitted. 
Grapefruit juice, diluted with water, may be used for constipa- 
tion. Weak lemonade, sweetened with honey, is a refreshing drink 
in warm weather. 
Oysters and the soft part of clams, and clam juice, are allowed. 
Weak cocoa — so weak as to be merely a flavoring of cocoa — 
is allowed for variety, though cocoa has come under the ban in diet 
for children, and would better not be used unless when milk, plain

Notes on Menus 
As before, the lunch between meals may be deferred to 
the afternoon, if the breakfast is late or the dinner early. 
Note that when an extra dish appears in the breakfast 
menu the lunch is lighter. Not being a permanent institu- 
tion, it may gradually become —so to speak — less pre- 
meditated. Fruit alone may often be beneficially substituted 
for it, but the child for many years hence needs an extra 
: } 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 133 
something to fill in the longer period between any two of the 
regulation family meals. 
Sometimes in the sixth year the first set of teeth begins to 
give way to the second. Whenever this is likely to interfere 
with mastication, there should for a time be a let-up on 
zweiback and other hard foods. 
A child should not be hurried at mealtime, nor encour- 
aged to eat quickly, but rather to talk all he wants to, and 
to masticate thoroughly. The adage: “Chatted food is half- 
digested,” means not only the stimulus of cheer during the 
meal, but that it is, because of the conversation, more grad- 
ually ingested into the stomach. 
The child that is thin, pale, and nervous, is often a result 
of poorly selected diet. Try more of the easily-digested fats, 
like cream and toasted breakfast bacon. Try more fruit and 
greens. 
The Child’s Development from Four to Six 
Weight and Height. According to a popular rule-of- 
thumb, the child’s height at birth should be at least doubled 
when he is six years old, and his weight should be at least 
six times the birth-weight. 
The standard weight to be carried by a certain height will 
be found in the Table on page 177. 
Walking. This art has long been mastered by the child, 
who will now for most of the day be constantly on his feet 
and engaged in free, spontaneous exercise. He should not, 
however, yet be tempted to take long and formal walks. 
(See page 100 in last chapter). Such a walk is not natural 
or right under the age of five full years. 
First of Second Dentition. During the fifth year, or the 
following, a new tooth is due to appear right behind the last 
double tooth of the milk set. The mother may naturally 
think it belongs in this set, since she is used to hearing that 
the permanent teeth dislodge the temporary, and this tooth 
does not dislodge another. Yet it is not temporary, it is the 
first tooth of the permanent set, and usually comes about a 
year before the truly temporary ones begin to fall.
-P-A-G-E-156
  134 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Social Consciousness. The social instincts continue to de- 
velop, and the only child or lonely child needs special pro- 
vision for training in becoming a social being, a citizen. 
Young companions are as necessary to wholesome growth as 
food, sunshine, and fresh air. While the kindergarten, the 
infant class in Sunday School and other organizations pro- 
vide in part for this need, the child should further have un- 
supervised and uncontrolled social intercourse and play with 
other children, and the mother must see to it that he does. 
Self-Consciousness. The consciousness of self is sometimes 
early in awakening (see page 103), sometimes is postponed to 
six or even seven years. With it there is often an eruption 
of difficulties, these are more fully discussed on pages 144 to 
150. Here we shall merely state that while consciousness 
of the self, and of free will may be expected to be demon- 
strated by rebellion, thus making the way ofthe parent 
pretty hard for a time, yet if the child’s will is now enlisted 
in coéperation the mother will accomplish something truly 
worth while in his development. 
Development of Motor Centers. The motor areas in the 
brain are now being developed and mastery over the body 
is being won. Naturally, a child wants to exercise, to be 
up-and-doing, hates to sit still and should not be required to 
do it. Free movement, free play, new activities, are all in 
order. 
Destructive Instincts. Gratification of the motor powers 
and an imperious desire to use them, often tempts to work 
of destruction, especially in the case of boys, whose increased 
strength and muscular energy needs an outlet. Give them 
now things it is legitimate to tear, to hammer, or break up 
— old cloth to be cut or torn into carpet rags, small firewood 
to chop into kindlings, clam shells or cinders to pound into 
little bits for the garden path, or anything else that will 
gratify love for destruction and gradually lead into love for 
construction — remembering that precision of movement is 
not to be expected until later. (See page 249.) 
Curiosity. The curiosity of the preceding age (page 110) 
increases, and the child’s destruction of toys is often through 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
    FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 135 
desire to see what is inside, or to find what ‘“‘makes the wheels 
go round,” through that craving to investigate that marks 
the scientist, the historian, the statistician, of later years. 
A good deal of instruction and information may, and should, 
now be given informally, without set hours or subjects, 
merely by letting the child take the lead and answering the 
questions prompted by instinctive curiosity. (See page 175.) 
This method of acquiring knowledge is wholesome and good 
when the child does not know he is being taught and the 
parent does not assume the role of teacher, only of the friend 
and comrade who “tells” and “shows how.” The first 
knowledge of reading, writing, number work, drawing, 
colors, and the names of the local plants and animals, should 
be thus gained in the home, imperceptibly, naturally. One 
little girl who delighted in her picture books and the stories 
they told used to ask her nurse to read to her, first the cap- 
tions, later, short paragraphs, and so learned to recognize 
and recite them. Very soon she could compare familiar 
words in her picture books with the same words in news- 
paper and magazine headings, or wherever they appeared 
in large and striking print, and from this she made un- 
noticed progress until at the age of four her mother was 
surprised to find her able to read in the First Reader of 
an older sister, with as much facility as the child who had 
been sent to school, and — as the mother said — ‘without 
being taught.” 
Metaphysical and Other Questions. Curiosity now impels 
to questions — metaphysical and theological — that might 
well disconcert the professor of philosophy and the doctor of 
divinity. To some of these the mother will have to answer 
that she does not know, to explain that nobody knows, for 
these are secrets that so far have never been found out. 
The child is not too young to experience a sense of reverence 
at hearing of these hidden things, ‘‘ which no man knoweth.” 
The very natural question where the newborn baby next 
door came from, is sure to be asked. For very little children 
we have, personally, no more objection to the stork myth 
than we have to Santa Claus. After six is time enough to
-P-A-G-E-158
    136 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
tell the truth, unless in the mother’s judgment it is best told 
now. A method is suggested on page 175. 
Children of four and five are capable of bringing home 
astonishing misapprehensions from the infant class in Sun- 
day School, misapprehensions often hard for the mother te 
straighten out. Such questions too, as “Is God in my 
pocket?” and “When I sit in a chair does God sit there 
too?” are sometimes asked by a mischievious younster for 
the sake — as one parent expresses it — of “putting mother 
ina hole.” This may be a time to shut down hard on ques- 
tioning, — or, it may be a time to answer with such sin- 
cerity and reverence as shall beget reverence. This would 
surely be the more excellent way. 
Imagination. During this imaginative age its require- 
ments of “make believe,’ dramatic impersonation, and 
fairy tale, are discussed in much fulness elsewhere. Let us 
in this place note the tendency of some children to create 
imaginative companions, whom they play with, talk to, 
and talk about to their mothers, as though they were of real 
flesh and blood. Lillian, at a little past four years, talked of 
the sayings and doings of an invisible “Margaret,” who came 
some days, but not every day, to play with her, who had long 
black hair, a torn frock, and who “was borned in our back 
yard.” So realistically and naturally did she speak of the 
said Margaret that one wondered how much she herself be- 
lieved in her. Mostly the child knows the shadow-child to 
be fictitious, but sometimes what they relate seems to be 
real to them. Students of children tell us variously that the 
creation comes from a dream, from a lonely child’s desire 
for companionship, or from a disordered stomach. Dr. 
Henderson (“Education and the Larger Life”: C. Hanford 
Henderson), relates that whenever he as a child had too 
much to say about invisible companions his grandfather 
sent him into the country for lots of fresh air and outdoor 
sports. 
Imitation. The instinct to imitate, referred to in its be- 
ginnings on pages 82 and 124, is persistent, and now, as then, 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
    
FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 1387 
it is of high importance that children have good things to 
imitate. The child will imitate the manner of grown-ups 
to one another, and much more will he imitate the manner 
of grown-ups towards himself. Fathers and mothers often 
insist on apology from a child who has disturbed them at 
work — are they careful to apologize to the child for disturb- 
ing him at play? Similarly should they observe towards the 
child all the courtesies they wish him to practice if they desire 
that fine politeness should become a second nature to the 
youngster, to be practiced like a reflex action, without effort 
and unself-consciously. Good English, good grammar, in- 
tonation of the voice, walk and posture, and all else that they 
desire him to copy should be of the kind good for him to 
copy. 
Care and Training During the Fifth and Sixth Years 
Sleep. A child, up to six years old, needs at least twelve 
hours of sleep in the twenty-four, and a very nervous child, 
or an unusually active one, needs more. The afternoon nap 
should be continued as long as possible, and bedtime should 
not be later than seven or half-past seven. 
Bathing. After the fifth birthday the child may be taught 
to take, without adult assistance, a daily shower bath, after 
washing face and hands. A quick run under water at a 
temperature of 65° F. and a brisk rub after it is excellent for 
the circulation, ‘will make the child vigorous, and is a safe- 
guard against taking cold — provided the reaction is good. 
Look for a glow of the skin, a reddening of the lips, a bright- 
ening of the eyes, an increased liveliness, and a fine appetite 
for breakfast. If the child shivers, if the lips and fingers turn 
pale or livid, and if the child seems used-up and languid 
after the cool shower, do not give it. Try substituting a 
rapid hand-rub with a bath mitten wrung out of cold, salted 
water. With most children this will produce a fine glow all 
over the body. The temperature of the bathroom ‘should 
not be less than 73° or 75° F., lest there be danger of chill. 
A tub bath of warm water at blood heat, with a mild soap, 
will be needed twice a week for cleansing. This, given before
-P-A-G-E-160
    
188 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
bedtime, will soothe the nerves, cause relaxation of the 
muscles, and produce sleepiness. 
Fresh Air and Exercise. The child should have all the 
fresh air possible, spend as much time out-of-doors as the 
weather permits, and sleep with open windows at night. 
Exercise in the open air hardly needs to be prescribed at this 
age; it may be left to the child’s own choice, stimulated by 
the proper playthings and games. Remember sunshine for 
rickets. (See page 52.) 
Breathing. Watch for mouth breathing, or for snoring at 
night and restless sleep. These may be symptoms of en- 
larged tonsils or adenoids, or of trouble of some kind in the 
nostrils, and the physician should be consulted. 
Care of Feet and Ankles. If a child wears down one side 
of a shoe more than the other it may indicate some weak- 
ness in the ligaments of the ankles, and the possible develop- 
ment of flatfoot. Professional attention may be needed. 
Without such advice do not adopt the so-called “corset 
shoe” for the child’s use; this may safeguard from turning 
the ankle but does not strengthen the part. 
The following remedy is recommended. Add a cupful of 
coarse salt to a quart of water and with this mixture sponge 
the ankles night and morning, and after drying, rub and 
massage for ten or fifteen minutes. The muscles will soon 
be found growing firmer under the touch. 
Ears. Watch for discharges from the ears, for swelling, 
pain, or deafness, and have the child examined at once by 
your physician. 
Throat. Teach the child to gargle the throat at bedtime, 
with water comfortably warm and salted in the proportion 
of one-half teaspoonful of salt to a pint of water. This gar- 
gling will at least cleanse the throat before the night’s sleep. 
The mouth should be washed out and water churned between 
the teeth for the same purpose. 
Teeth. The child during the sixth year should have an 
X-ray examination of the teeth. An authority is quoted as

foolish and costly mistakes are avoided, and much better 
health results.” It is safe to have a general dental examina~- 
tion at least every six months. 
General Examination by Physician. Every child from four 
to six or seven, even though in apparent good health, should 
be examined by the family physician every six months at 
farthest — some authorities advise every two months for all 
children under seven. 
Habits of Hygiene. Four years old, our specialists say, is 
the season to implant for all time, not only the habits rec- 
ommended on page 113, but also those of ‘‘keeping feet dry, 
backs warm, teeth clean, and a daily bowel movement.” 
To these, as a mere matter of hygiene, let us add habits 
of happiness. ‘Cultivate habits of happiness as you would 
a musical gift,” writes Richard Burton. 
Neither is it too soon to initiate the finer habits of honesty 
and truth, gentleness, courage, patience. 
Household Responsibilities.\ To assign to the child such 
small tasks as are easily within his power to perform is part 
of his training in helpfulness, in responsibility, in taking 
part in the life of the family, and should by no means be 
overlooked by the mother. A child of from four to six 
should be able to set the table for a simple meal, to help to 
clear it, to wipe dishes and even to wash them, to do small 
tidyings-up of couch pillows, books, and newspapers, to put 
his own playthings away, to put his bedding to air, to be 
responsible for father’s slippers, and similar small tasks. 
Much should be made of punctual and exact fulfilment of 
these responsibilities, the small tasks should be made pleas- 
ant and delightful to the child, so that the reward will be 
found in their execution rather than in praise for the per- 
formance. 
A child’s love for doing things often stimulates him to 
attempt something beyond his ability, but if he begs to be 
allowed to wind the clock, paint the floor, or polish the 
stove he may, when possible, be permitted to make the en- 
deavor. Do not allow him to be discouraged by failure; tell 
him he has done well for a first attempt. An impression of 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
140 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
defeat is apt to inhibit future action, especially in a sensitive 
child. Try rather to form the habit of persevering until the 
difficulty is conquered. Above all, never make fun of a poor 
attempt or a failure. To do this may be especially disas- 
trous — and when the child takes things seriously the adult 
should be equally serious if confidence and sympathy are 
to be maintained between the two. 
  Safeguarding from Unwholesome Experiences 
Teasing. The child of four is still too young to be exposed 
to the teasing of an older child, or a thoughtless adult, — 
that is, teasing to’ the point of tantalizing. A small amount 
of good-humored joking, not carried to the borderland of 
annoyance, may be permitted, but it is safer totally to forbid 
teasing if there is the smallest danger that it will stimulate 
a fit of temper. 
Anger, Worry, or Fear. As in former years, the child 
should not be exposed to fear, should not know what worry 
is, and should be shielded from fits of ill-temper as from 
smallpox. Until the child is old enough to use his will in 
the practice of self-control, the mother should shield him 
from habits of ill-temper, and she should remember that one 
fit of anger makes it easier to fall into another. 
It is interesting to find some of our authorities arguing 
against the inhibition or repression of the instinct of anger. 
Inhibited, we are told, the child may “lose the power of 
righteous indignation or flaming zeal.” Encouraged, “anger 
should be a great and diffused power in life.” As well argue 
for the encouragement of the natural instinct of fear — 
once, like anger, a means of preservation of the race. As for 
its power, let us ask whether the greatest achievments of 
men were accomplished in anger, or in controlled strength? 
Therefore, let us repeat, shield the child from anger until his 
will is strong enough to control it. 
Unwholesome Self-consciousness. The thoughts of a child 
of this or any other age should normally not be occupied 
with himself, but with things outside of himself. It is un- 
wholesome that his mind should be occupied with his own 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 141 
conduct, bad or good; and it is particularly hurtful to a 
child of this age to have forced on him a premature con- 
viction of sin. Hence, while we are farfrom being less tolerant 
in matters of conduct than our Puritan forefathers, far from 
less careful to inhibit habits of wrong-doing which if per- 
sisted in may open the way to more serious faults, we never- 
theless go about their correction in a different way. Writers 
on this subject assert that it does positive harm to a child 
to discuss his moral lapses with him, or in his hearing — it 
seems only to impress them. 
Indirect suggestion, such as reading a story or a fable 
without any attempt to point the moral — letting it sink in 
unaided — also choosing stories of positive good conduct 
and happy consequences rather than of evil-doing and its 
punishment, is one of the best helps for a story-loving child. 
Exhibition Before Company. The pernicious practice of 
calling on a child to sing, recite, or go through some facti- 
cious performance for the entertainment of company is one 
of the marks and signs of unwisdom in the grown-up. Toa 
shy child this is often pure torture; in the case of a bolder one 
there is danger he will learn to “play to his audience,” to 
become artificial instead of spontaneous, and to grow into a 
little prig. There are few children who escape unharmed 
from such a practice. It is better to train them to entertain 
guests in some other way than by self-display. 
Avoidance of “Forcing” Children. It is well known that 
during the extremely plastic years before the sixth birthday, 
if a child is sedulously trained away from its natural instincts, 
and its thoughts and energies are diverted by aspiring parents 
from ‘‘ Mother Goose” to Mathematics, and from “Ring 
Around a Rosy” to Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, it can be 
placed on exhibition as a little prodigy. To do this is as con- 
trary to nature as it is to clip and prune and trim a vyoung 
tree into the shape of a bear or a rhinocerous. The tree will 
probably be spoiled for life and will surely be inefficient as 
a rhinocerous. 
While not going so far as to impose on her child excursions 
into the higher education, some mothers will overdo its  
-P-A-G-E-164
  142 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
mental training at this age, at the expense of the hours of 
pure play, free, unsuggested, and unsupervised, which should 
be its natural choice. At this age the best form of education 
for the child is in play. To quote Mr. Joseph Lee: “Play, 
to the child, is a means of self-expression, a means to knowl- 
edge, and a means to socialization. It is the biggest and 
most important of life’s activities.” 
Again Mr. Lee tells us: ‘The plays craved at different 
ages are so many invitations of nature to new advances in 
life and learning.” The mistakenly ambitious mother who 
attempts formal instruction in reading, writing, and number 
work at this age may do her child serious mischief and im- 
pair health and development of either mind or body. Note, 
however, that it is the formal teaching which is contrary to 
nature. (See page 134-5 for informal instruction.) 
Inhibitions and Prohibitions. Inhibitions and repressions 
of natural instincts and desires are hurtful to the child’s de- 
velopment. At this age the child is likely to associate a pro- 
hibition with the one who forbids rather than the thing 
forbidden. Also, it has been the unhappy experience of 
parents that the commandment, “Thou shalt not” stimu- 
lates an irresistible desire to contrariness, and that children 
who are often subjected to it are extremely hard to manage. . 
The more excellent way of persuasion and reasoning is much 
the more difficult, but if faithfully pursued its results in the 
case of the child will be hardly short of marvellous, while in 
the case of the mother it is not too much to say her wings 
will sprout after sympathetic and patient care of two or 
three children from birth to boyhood and girlhood. 
Fibs of Mothers. Among the unwholesome experiences 
from which children should be guarded are the fibs of their 
mothers. By these are not meant the stories of Santa Claus 
and Cinderella, which are no more lies than are popular 
novels. To these, the race’s heritage of folk and fairy tale, 
every child has a right of which he should not be defrauded. 
But busy mothers, half-distracted by household cares, will 
sometimes “get rid” of a bothering little child by telling it 
an unpardonable fib. A certain little John used to keep 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
    FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 143 
watering the grassplot every day, anxiously, patiently, and 
for a pretty long period at a stretch. He would leave other 
activities for this work and would return to it again and 
again. His mother had told him that if he kept watering 
the grass it would turn into a red carpet, and his faith in her 
word was pitiful. Another mother told the small daughter 
who was imitating her when engaged in sewing, and kept 
bothering to have her needles threaded, that if she kept pull- 
ing the needle through the cloth for long enough, a thread 
would grow through the eye. The child was quieted by this 
and for months after she would have fits of sitting by her- 
self, patiently pulling a needle through a bit of muslin, wait- 
ing in vain for the thread to grow — the mother pleased at 
her “being so quiet.” Such fibs will, a few years later, be re- 
membered by the child as a betrayal of his trust, and confi- 
dence in the mother will be endangered if not lost. 
Parents’ Insincerities. Similarly, there are forms of in- 
sincerity on the part of the parent which are unwholesome 
experiences for the child. For instance, while little children 
may be distracted from mischief by the suggestion of some 
agreeable occupation without a word of comment on the 
wrong-doing, this method should be modified as the child 
grows older, and still without the inhibitory “Stop!” In 
one of the books on child care it is suggested that a mother, 
instead of saying, “Boys, stop your noise,” when the play 
of a couple of urchins in the room where she entertained a 
guest became too boisterous, she might better have said: 
“Boys, run out into the yard and gather some flowers for 
the tea-table,” or “Boys, go upstairs and finish your saw- 
ing,” thus not merely suppressing the wrong or annoying 
act, but substituting a right one in its place. Still better 
would it be to tell the boys frankly that they were too noisy, 
that they could not stay in the room, and then to suggest the 
pleasurable activities elsewhere. The wiles of the diplo- 
matic mother are quickly seen through at this age, and if she 
would win and keep the confidence of the child she should 
play fair and be as straight as a string. This will also foster 
habits of truth and honor in the child.

  144 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Some Youthful Peccadillos and Their Treatment 
Indulgence in Sulkiness. Sulks are a symptom, perhaps 
of a sensitive child not adapting or conforming himself to 
environment; perhaps of a rebellious, or silently resistant, 
shut-in style of personality; perhaps of difficult self-mastery. 
In “Madame Claire,”’ by Susan Ertz, the child is pictured 
who has withdrawn, offended, from a game, and the other 
children don’t know why. She “stands apart, lonely and 
miserable. They call her presently to come and join them, 
and she longs to go, but can’t — can’t. Something won’t 
let her. . . . She sulks. She does n’t want to sulk. She 
suffers.” The future happiness of the child may depend on 
complete eradication of the habit of sulkiness. Give her 
something interesting to do, something new in work or play 
with the others. Call them all to a march or a circle game 
with song, or to a dance, or a racing game. Motion that is 
enjoyed often helps to break the bonds and liberate the 
child. Music here may have a curative effect. Take no 
notice of her sulks. Laughter is good. Help her to help her- 
self and to know the joy of deliverance. 
Obstinacy. With the coming of self-consciousness the 
mother may expect a demonstration of the curious and ex- 
tremely troublesome fits of stubbornness that so often come 
with it. The unreasonable obstinacy of a child between 
four and five years old is frequently dogged and unyielding 
before the advances of love, bribery, persuasion, or anything 
except force. The child has found himself; has consciously 
discovered that valuable endowment, his free will. To com- 
pare great things to small, this is not unlike the coming of 
that other valuable (physical) gift, the saliva, which at first 
he does not know what to do with, is not able to restrain, 
and lets loose to the inconvenience of his mother. (See 
page 29.) If the mother makes this comparison it should 
help her to understand the unpleasant phenomenon of ob- 
stinacy. 
For remedy, restraint can be used, well and wisely, in some 
cases, and the child can be kept by gentle force from mis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
       FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 145 
chief or hurt to himself; but to compel active obedience — 
such as to pick up torn papers or playthings from the floor, 
to open the door for an elder, to go on an unpleasing errand 
—when resolute disobedience is persisted in, is a hard 
problem to deal with. 
This was the time when the Puritan parent set out to 
“break the will’’ of his offspring, and it is the time when the 
sorely-tried parent of today may well wish she did not know 
that wills were not made to be broken. It is now that the 
previous training of the mother — won through her care 
and training of the child from birth — should come into 
play. To grow angry, to scold, to compel obedience by loud 
and domineering commands, may set up a more determined 
resistance, may breed inward resentment, may pave the 
way to future estrangement. Thereisonly oneremedy. An 
understanding sympathy, and the long patience which is its 
flower and fruit. 
Sometimes the obstinate child, like the sulky one, wants 
not to persist, and is not able to let go, when some of the 
remedies for sulks may be applied. In the nursery school 
the obstinate child or the child in a tantrum is not com- 
pelled to obedience, he is given the choice of obeying or 
leaving the room; and the teachers think that his voluntary 
going into the solitude of the next room helps him to get 
back his balance, has on him the quieting effect of the kiddie 
koop on the baby. Such solitude must not be imposed as a 
punishment, but rather seem to be chosen at the will of the 
child. Nor is obedience in the kindergarten a matter of 
compulsion; the child is simply left out of the circle. Irrita- 
tion, anger, disturbance at the wrong-doing, is never shown 
by the teacher. Unfailing serenity and gentleness on the 
part of the parent implies a fine self-mastery which will un- 
consciously influence the child beneficially. Children of all 
ages are sensitive to atmosphere, and in the right atmos- 
phere there are not often serious difficulties to be dealt 
with. 
The capacity in a child for long and determined obstinacy 
usually indicates a strong will, which — enlisted for the    
-P-A-G-E-168
    
    146 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
right — means promise of worthwhile achievement. A boy 
of our acquaintance, fortunate in not being antagonized by 
force, but rather won by his parents to codperation, at the 
age of four years voluntarily undertook to cure himself of 
thumb sucking, and succeeded. He and his mother talked 
over remedies which he elected should be applied. If they 
had been forced on him he would probably be still sucking 
that thumb. : 
“T never failed to win Alice to obedience,” said Alice’s 
mother. “I always told her I would not make her do the 
thing until she chose, but that it had to be done some time 
— perhaps not until tomorrow or the day after —and I 
hoped it would not be left so long. I told her I knew she 
was going to do it and I hoped it would be soon. It was for 
her to say whether it would be now or tomorrow. Some- 
times it took hours of loving sympathy and patience — but 
she always did it.” 
Note here, “hours of loving sympathy and patience.” 
This is what may be to the mother the cost of overcoming 
obstinacy, but her reward will be great. By permitting the 
child the choice of doing the required something either now 
or tomorrow, she was allowed to feel free, and respect was 
shown for her free will by the promise that she would not be 
made to do what she did not will. While only dimly per- 
ceiving how she was being treated, how encouraged to make 
her own choice, the child’s will was strengthened and 
directed. 
Contrast these methods with those of another mother. 
Her child ran into the room, delighted with the gift of a new 
lead pencil, which she happily showed to her parents. “Ask 
father to sharpen it for you,’’ said the mother. But the 
pencil without sharpening completely satisfied the child, 
and she refused to make the suggested request. For what 
the mother called her disobedience the little girl was whipped 
and shut up in a closet until she consented to ask her father 
to sharpen the pencil. All pleasure in the gift was lost, and 
the incident stayed in the child’s mind, years later to breed 
estrangement from the mother. ”
-P-A-G-E-169
    
FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 147 
Disobedience. The last incidents related naturally lead to 
the vexed question of obedience. ‘Obedience is the first 
duty of the child to its parent,” used to be considered on a 
par with the duty of the parent to break the will of the child. 
General habits of obedience should be formed from the first, 
but the mother should know that obedience in itself may be 
, anything but a virtue, and over-insisted on it may weaken 
the character. As soon as possible the child’s right to self- 
government should be recognized and increasing freedom 
of choice should be given in all such matters as whether it 
should or should not ask to have a pencil sharpened. 
“Parents,” says Mrs. Max West (“Children’s Bureau Pub- 
lication, No. 10,” p. 48) “have no right to exact from their 
children instant obedience save when the line of conduct in- 
sisted upon will either serve to protect the child from phys- 
ical or mental harm, . . . or to protect the rights of others.” 
“Never insist on obedience for the sake of obedience, for 
the sake of mere drill,” says Professor M. V. O’Shea. 
“Train a child, as early as possible, to obey himself, to in- 
hibit, to stop himself. When a child is able to restrain his 
own acts he is showing will power, self-mastery, he is prac- 
ticing the obedience which is self-control,” writes another 
authority. 
Further, from Professor O’Shea comes the excellent in- 
junction: ‘Do not ask a child to do something when he is 
engrossed in play, and insist that he do it immediately.” 
Unlawful Appropriation of Property. With the sense of 
ownership, the ability to distinguish between what is and 
what is not his own, and the natural desire to increase the 
sum of his belongings, the child at four years will be found 
not sufficiently advanced in the moral life to have developed 
scruples about the use of means to ends when in presence of 
a coveted and readily portable object. Children will bring 
home beads and balls from the kindergarten and other 
places, sometimes without distinguishing right from wrong, 
sometimes with a guilty sense of yielding to temptation. 
They should be taught to return them in a matter-of-fact 
way. Duplicates, if possible, should be provided, and the
-P-A-G-E-170
    148 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
mother should encourage children to ask her for objects 
that they covet. If fearless candor and confidence between 
mother and child have been established from the time he 
could toddle, the child will naturally disclose to her the 
aching desires of his hardly more-than-baby heart, and 
she will then be able to deal with the situation, either by 
fulfilling them, or telling why this is impossible and giving 
something just as good. 
At this age, when private ownership is craved by the newly- 
awakened self, to give a child things of his very own, and to 
show a respect for his rights of ownership, is a good way to 
teach him to keep hands off the property of others. Do not 
be excessively shocked at such peccadillos, and do not make 
the mistake of trying to frighten or punish a child out of 
them. The moral life was never developed by punishment; 
but by cultivating and enlisting the will. Professor O’Shea 
says that almost all educators and psychologists agree that 
impulses to lie and steal ‘‘exist in every normal child and 
must be constantly watched and guarded against in a 
friendly, individual way. In ordinary family life these 
problems are acute only at rare moments. As a matter of 
fact, normal family life frequently effects a cure auto- 
matically.” 
Fibs of Children. The child at this age is imaginative, a 
lover of stories and a dreamer of dreams. But there are 
stories and stories — some of them are called fibs. A child’s 
dreams from three years on are vivid, they often make a 
deep impression on the memory, and facts and dreams are 
easily confused in the mind. The child will visualize stories, 
and many times will really believe to be true the marvel he 
relates and which he is convinced he saw. On the other 
hand, in telling a story of adventure he will consciously let 
imagination run away with him and will add to the tale the 
embellishments he wishes might have been real. This is 
well illustrated by a story in Mrs. Cabot’s book (“Seven 
Ages of Childhood.” Ella Lyman Cabot), where she relates 
that her little niece and nephew ran after her with the an- 
nouncement that there was a new baby in the farmhouse. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
    FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 149 
“And I saw the angel, flying across the fields, bringing it 
from Heaven,’ said Harold, aged five. As he was a naturally 
truthful child and I saw that he did not want to be pressed 
for further details, I did not question his statement, for I 
thought it was truer than he knew,” writes Mrs. Cabot. 
So will mothers do well not to question statements where 
the child has yielded to the irresistible desire to let imagina- 
tion go unshackled, and where he shows by evasion of exact 
details his awareness of backsliding from veracity. If 
pressed he may call on imagination for corroborative evidence 
and tell a real lie. To such a statement as Harold’s it will 
be well for the mother — like the aunt — to act as “them 
that having ears, hear not.” Or she may play with certain 
fantasies, saying: “That’s a great story, now I’ll tell an- 
other,” thus making a joke of it all. On the other hand, if 
the child earnestly relates the impossibilities of a vivid 
dream, the mother with the right insight should be able to 
distinguish this from a flight of imagination, and explain to 
the child why it seemed to him to be true. 
Another class of imaginative lies proceeds from the strong 
desire for something and the half-formulated hope that say- 
ing it is so will make it come true. A woman of fine integrity 
lately told us that when she was a little girl she worshipped 
from afar one of the “big girls” in school, wanted to be 
noticed by her, to win affectionate attention from her, and 
used to say that she received it by way of comforting herself 
for the disappointment when she did n’t. It was an effort to 
realize her castle in Spain. This kind of wistful lying will 
probably be outgrown, or the child might be gently shamed 
out of it. It is usually the form of lying most likely to be 
yielded to by a sensitive, loving child. 
Actual falsehood — denial of having broken the cream 
pitcher or appropriated the cookies — generally proceeds 
from fear, and here the mother should realize that if the 
child has lied because he was afraid of her to tell the truth, 
she is to blame! 
Punishment for lying is a desperate and very uncertain 
remedy. “Tf a child is thrashed for lying, it will lieagain to   
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  150 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
avoid another beating,” writes an English authority on child 
training. The child should be helped to conquer the habit, 
coéperated with, incited to emulate fine example. 
There is such a thing as pathological lying, and a book has 
been written about it by Dr. William Healy, (‘Pathological 
Lying, Accusation, and Swindling”), who says there are 
children who are unable to discriminate between what is 
true and what is not. These children are not feeble minded, 
they are rather in a morally color-blind class. In this book 
we deal only with the normal child — not the odd or un- 
usual one — nor the child that needs the psychotherapist. 
The Kindergarten 
The child may begin to attend kindergarten at from four 
to five years old, and the mother, too, will do well to attend 
some of its sessions and acquire a few ideas for home use. Op- 
portunity is frequently offered through some form of weekly 
assembling together of mothers and teachers, to gain knowl- 
edge of the principles underlying the play, the gifts and oc- 
cupations, which parents who have not studied the subject 
so often regard as mere pastime for children under school age. 
Unquestionably, the kindergarten is adapted, physically 
and psychologically, to children of this age. In it the child 
learns to play at organized games, and to adjust himself to 
social life and elementary coéperation with his fellows. 
He learns to use colored crayons and to model in clay, and 
gains the power of self-expression in these vehicles as well as 
in the use of English. Much is made, usually, of conversa- 
tion and of the child’s ability to relate stories. Many kin- 
dergarten teachers encourage spontaneous, improvised and 
original rhythmic movements to music on the part of the 
child, tending to graceful control of the body; also, his hunger 
during these years for dramatic impersonation is fed and 
his imagination is stimulated. Much of this may be done at 
home, but it is now good for the child to have it done out- 
side the home, and to begin his adventures in the world of 
society beyond the family enclosure. ‘‘Great are the dis- 
advantages,” says Mr. Lee, “‘of the sheltered life.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
       FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 151 
Every kindergarten should have a real garden, where 
children, especially city-bred ones, may get close to green, 
growing things. Yet, since the results in kindergarten work 
(as in all other work) are due in the proportion of 80 per cent 
to the teacher and 20 per cent to the system, the mother 
should choose the kindergarten on the basis of its kinder- 
gartner rather than of its garden or other equipment. Fre- 
quenters of the theatre know that a young actress is rarely 
able to play “Juliet,” and visitors to the kindergarten often 
find that young teachers have not enough wisdom to deal 
with babes. Sometimes they drill them too much, sometimes 
they allow them to become over-excited in play. Watch the 
child to see whether he comes home all keyed up and then 
has a period of listless or irritable reaction in the afternoon. 
It is a pity that many of the kindergarten doggerels, much 
of its music, and most of its pictures, are regrettable things 
on which to form a child’s taste. This, however, is not a 
serious enough defect to keep the child out of kindergarten 
if care is taken to provide antidotes at home. 
In too large a kindergarten class the teacher will have to 
occupy the children with too long periods of so-called ‘“busy- 
work,’ when — even now in some kindergartens — they are 
made to sit in rows and sew perforated cards or engage in 
other labor that calls for a finer muscular coérdination than 
is good for the child of this age — when free, wide move- 
ments are natural and the young eyes should not be labori- 
ously focussed on small things. Also, in the kindergarten 
there is no allowance for free, unsupervised play. Plato, in 
his old wisdom which to so many of us is new, thought that, 
up to six years old one of the most important needs of chil- 
dren was play, but that it was best they should play at what 
they wished, when they wished, and in the manner they 
wished. The organized play of the kindergarten is good, but 
not for this should the child be stinted or restricted in a great, 
plenty of free play. Some mothers (we think wisely) allow 
children to attend kindergarten on alternate days of the 
week rather than consecutively, at least during the first year 
—or they grant permission for a day off at the child’s request.    
-P-A-G-E-174

Play and Playthings 
It is said that a child under six years old cannot sit entirely 
and absolutely still for more than thirty seconds at a time. 
The motor areas are being evolved. These are the years of 
ceaseless energy. Psychologists tell us that play affords rich 
opportunity for the direction of instinct. Social.workers tell 
us juvenile delinquency frequently has its source in re- 
stricted opportunity for play. 
The Sand Pile. Up to six years old and later the child 
loves the sand pile. A little child — and often a larger one     
— delights in the feel of clean, fine sand. He likes to let hand- . 
fuls of it sift through his fingers or to draw them through it, 
to pat it, to touch it. When the child, with a definite idea in 
view, begins to dig ditches in the sand, to pile up mounds, 
to scoop out wells, this means a great advance. The sand 
pile should gradually be made bigger and its size kept well 
ahead of the child’s capacity, so that it will not only be ready 
for this when it develops but will stimulate such develop- 
ment. Then, with playmates of his own age, look to see 
mountains heaped up, solid towers built, and castles with 
ramparts and moats. 
A Playhouse. A tent, an unused shed, or even a big 
packing-box, where the child can mimic the home life in a 
dwelling of his very own and play at anything from dolls’ 
housekeeping to armed chieftain in a castle under siege, is a 
special joy-producer at this age, and the less “finished” the 
dwelling, and the more creative imagination the child must 
use in its furnishings, the more joy it will give. A dilapidated 
shed, a crude dugout, or a large wooden crate will give more 
lasting pleasure than an expensive playhouse with real 
windows and furniture. 
A Playroom, perhaps in the attic, for weather unsuited 
to the out-of-doors, is also a necessity of child life. Tables 
and chairs of kindergarten size, which if necessary can be im- 
provised by ‘‘cutting down” old furniture, ought to be pro- 
vided for the play room; and an old wardrobe, an old couch 
or rocking chair, in which to play robbers’ den, smugglers’

cave, Pullman car, limousine, steamer, canoe, island in the 
southern seas, or iceberg in the Artic Ocean; a folding screen 
behind which a band of guerillas may find ambush; a dilapi- 
dated wash boiler in which to discover or to store treasure; 
and many other cast-offs from grown-up uses, added one at a 
time, will equip a playroom of delight for at least the next 
four years. It should be recognized that this, like the out- 
door playhouse, is the children’s very own room, to have 
and to hold, and in which to do pretty much as they 
please. 
Playing With Fire. From the time the baby was old enough 
to notice and admire alighted lamp, the attraction of flame and 
fire will increase with his growth and development. By way 
of safeguard from the dangers of close acquaintance with 
these brilliant mysteries, more than one mother has allowed 
her infant to scorch his fingers very slightly. Whether or 
not this preventive measure has been taken, the child from 
four years on and earlier will love to play with fire, and 
matches had better be kept out of the way for a few years 
longer. Dr. Luther Gulick (of beloved memory), who be- 
lieved his children knew better than he did as to the right 
activities for them at different ages, used to provide an out- 
let for their longing to play with fire by the institution of a 
“fire day” once a week in fine weather, when parents and 
children collected sticks and made fires, to their intense de- 
light. (‘‘A Philosophy of Play,” Chapter V.) 
“ Dressing-Up Clothes.” From four years old or younger, 
to seven or sometimes eight, when small girls like to play 
“ladies,” and make calls, exchangevisits, or entertain at 
afternoon teas; or want to act “ Cinderella”’ or ‘‘Red Riding 
Hood” — the mother can baste up wonderful robes of cheap 
calico, and give the child material to make fashionable hats, 
long chains, and gilt paper diadems for princesses and 
queens. For the boys who are in turn “Hiawatha,” “Rip 
Van Winkle,” or “Sinbad the Sailor,” easy-to-make cos- 
tumes can be devised to suit the parts, and in all cases it 
should be remembered that the less of the restrictive ac- 
curacy of correct detail and the more flexible are the cos-  
-P-A-G-E-176
  154 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
tumes in yielding themselves to imaginative adaptation, the 
more they will be enjoyed. 
The wooden blocks described on page 122 will give in- 
creased pleasure, and the swing, the seesaw, the toboggan 
slide, will afford much desired thrills. Children love to climb 
trees and ladders, and should not be forbidden. They like 
to wade and dabble in water, and will sail toy boats by the 
hour. They will play with tenpins and bean bags, girls will 
learn the use of the skipping rope, and boys and girls should 
become more expert in ball play and throwing games. Per- 
haps they will enjoy coloring pictures and putting cut-outs 
together. 
Blowing soap bubbles, now the child has breath enough to 
inflate them, will be a fine diversion, and young friends may 
be invited to soap bubble parties. A good soap bubble mix- 
ture is made by shaving or grating Castile soap and letting 
it dissolve in water, in the proportion of an ounce of soap to 
a cupful of water. Let stand until the cloudiness is pre- 
cipitated to the bottom, pour off the clear liquid and mix 
with half its volume of glycerine. Such a mixture makes 
big, beautiful bubbles that last well. 
Remember to provide things for climbing up, sliding down, 
and jumping off. Other playthings are: a blackboard with 
colored crayons; a tile or parquetry board; ribbon, tape, or 
colored cord to braid or weave; beads to string, clay to model, 
blunt-pointed scissors for revelries of cutting out, are all ex- 
cellent playthings for this age — not forgetting the wooden 
building-blocks. 
Doll Play. Small girls often show love for dolls almost as 
soon as they can toddle. sometimes not until the years be- 
tween four and six. If they are not loved then they prob- 
ably will never be. 
Though Mr. Joseph Lee says the interest of boys and girls 
in dolls and soldiers is not the same (‘‘Play in Education,” 
Chapter VIII), some of us have found that many boys play 
with dolls just as girls do, while others play with them “with 
a difference.” Small boys and small girls seem naturally to 
love dolls, only the boys are usually shamed out of it and 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 155 
their attention diverted to tin soldiers — or it used to be so 
before the war. Doll-play has been pronounced highly 
educative for the future mothers, why should it not be so for 
the future fathers? Many observers of children playing to- 
gether, without having sex proprieties forced on them, find 
that boys and girls are equally interested in dolls and tin 
soldiers; and at least the boy-dolls, the sailors, cadets, High- 
landers, clowns, ought to be listed as unobjectionable for the 
little men; while in games of housekeeping they will like to 
play father of the family. These games belong naturally to 
the house- and store-keeping age, which are enjoyed at this 
age and often up to eight and ten years old or later. 
Games. Games of hide-and-seek, of capture and pursuit, 
of tag, and the circle games, are now natural and delightful. 
Look for suggestions among the games mentioned for the 
early part of the next period. 
Impromptu acting of a part, dramatization of stories, and 
all the kindergarten games are much loved. 
Pictures and Stories 
Children from four to six, like the younger ones, still much 
prefer colored pictures; they crave rich tints and pigments. 
They still enjoy the pictures of the preceding age, but they 
may now be introduced to those of strange birds and animals, 
of storks, eagles, and cockatoos; bears, lions, giraffes, and 
elephants in jungles. 
Now, too, they love pictures that illustrate the stories they 
have been told, such as “‘ Little Red Riding Hood,” ‘‘Cinder- 
ella,” ‘‘Jack and the Beanstalk,” and others. Each of these 
stories has been told in picture sequence by Mr. Crane, and 
these will be followed again and again with pleasure by the 
child who has heard the tales orally. Pictures of children in 
other lands and other times than ours, of boats and ships 
and railway trains, are all in order at this time. So are pic- 
tures that appeal to the imagination, like those of fairies, 
elves, and brownies; as well as pictures of the Christ Child, 
of guardian angels; and one in particular by Millais, “Angels 
in the Kitchen,” is sure to be loved by children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  156 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
In most of their pictures they like a good deal of action; 
boys and girls engaged in games or doing things, animals in 
motion. Do not be discouraged if they prefer what someone 
calls ‘‘pictures crude to the point of vulgarity,” to finer and 
more artistic ones, for they will immediately turn from a 
steel engraving of Landseer’s to a row of white ducks against 
a red background. Many of our modern artists are now 
making pictures for children; gay, bright, positive in out- 
line, yet artistic, fine, and stimulating to the imagination. 
The mother, in choosing pictures the child will enjoy, should 
be careful to select those it will be good for him to enjoy. It 
need hardly be said that he should be guarded from colored 
Sunday Supplements as sedulously as from sin. 
Besides pictures for the child to play with, it will be good 
to have now, as in the preceding period, on the walls of the 
nursery or the rooms most frequented by the child, pictures 
of graceful children in graceful attitudes. At this copy-cat 
age their grace will be imitated and standards will uncon- 
sciously be formed, of gesture, movement, carriage of the 
body. 
Oral Story Telling. The story hour, begun after the third 
birthday, should be continued and become a feature of the 
family life. This is the fairy tale age, the age of wonder, and 
the child who does not know “Cinderella,” ‘‘Goldenhair,” 
“The Three Bears,” and the other classic fairy stories, is de- 
frauded of his birthright. ‘All these,” says MacClintock, 
(“Literature in the Elementary School,’ Chapter VI), 
“were to those who made them, serious art, as they should 
be to the child.” He further compares these immortal 
tales with some present stories of ‘‘dew-fairies and frost- 
fairies, flower angels, speaking plants and conversing worms, 
whose mission in life is really a gentle species of university- 
extension lectures.”’ (Ibid.) These he pronounces tales of 
the fancy, the others, “of the deep human imagination, 
using all the powers of the mind.” (Ibid.) 
Story-telling now should include certain of “ Aisop’s 
Fables,’ such as “The Lion and the Mouse,” “The Hare 
and the Tortoise,” ‘‘The Dog in the Manger,” “The Oak 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  FROM FOURTH TO THE SIXTH BIRTHDAY 157 
and the Reed,” and others that the child can understand 
and apply. In relating these, tell the story and let the moral 
take care of itself. Folk tales like that of ‘‘The Little Red 
Hen,” and others; many of the myths like the Greek tales 
of ‘Jason and the Golden Fleece,” of “Hercules and His 
Labors;”’ some of the Norse myths and many from our own 
Indian lore, should be told to children as part of their edu- 
cation. So should the picturesque stories from American his- 
tory, of Paul Revere, the landing of Columbus, Pocahontas, 
etc. Above all, the beautiful Bible stories should now become 
a part of the permanent make-up of the child. 
Pictures and Stories to Avoid. At the risk of repetition, let 
us emphasize the counsel on page 156 to provide the children 
with no pictures that are not good. The mother should re- 
member that to ‘“‘eat butter and honey,”’ — two good things 
—will foster the instinct to “refuse the evil and to choose 
the good.” Good pictures, fine artistic decorations in the 
nursery, and good music, should all be the portion of children. 
Be careful at this time, before the child is clear as to the 
difference between right and wrong, to avoid the folk and 
other tales that glorify clever cheating, revenge, lying, 
cruelty, and deception. Avoid also all tales of horror and 
evil spirits. Avoid the over-harrowing emotional narra- 
tives. Even the classic story of “The Erl King” has caused 
sensitive children to suffer agonies of sorrow and of untold 
‘fears in the night. Sympathy with suffering like that of the 
“Babes in the Wood” and possibly of ‘Hans and Gretel” is 
good to cultivate, but let it be free from the element of 
magical or other dread. 
Music and Song. It is very easy, during the first five or 
six years of life, to cultivate the child’s natural love of music. 
If this has been done from the beginning the child will now 
delight to express himself in song, will sing while he is at 
play, will love to be sung and played to, and many more 
children than we realize are like Saul, King of Israel, in that 
their evil fits of temper will yield to music. There is hardly 
a mother who has not voice enough to sing to her children, 
and as hereinbefore mentioned, a singing mother will make
-P-A-G-E-180
  158 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
5 LZ 
singing children. There should be in every house at least 
one musical instrument; for where there are children, a 
piano, or a violin, and a good victrola are not luxuries; they 
are as necessary as tables and chairs. 
Like pictures and stories, the music should be good, for if 
the child is constantly exposed to jazz, rag-time, or discords, 
he will fail to distinguish good from bad. 
Poetry. Children love the rhythm of poetry, they love 
its imagery. Without formal memorizing they will now learn 
by heart the poems they like best when read aloud or re- 
cited to them. Many delightful narrative poems and others 
suitable to this age may be chosen from the books suggested 
on pages 208-9 in the next period.

THE CHILD FROM THE SIXTH TO THE 
TENTH BIRTHDAY 
Tue Prriop or THE Primary ScHOOL 
Foods and Feeding 
The rules and menus for from four to six years on the 
whole apply also to the present period. The quantities 
may be increased according to the need of the child, and a 
greater variety may gradually be introduced into the meals. 
A list of hitherto forbidden foods, now permitted, will be 
found on page 162. 
Proteins. Milk should be provided in abundance, either 
plain or in the form of simple puddings, porridges, junkets, 
and jellies. At least one and one-half pints, and if possible 
a quart, should be the daily allowance. In the case of 
run-down children, additional milk has been found to ac- 
complish nutritional miracles. An extra pint of milk in 
the diet of the public school children of Chicago a few 
years ago resulted in improved health, increased weight, 
clearer minds, better growth, and all-round better children. 
Milk is one of the foods that can hardly be given in excess. 
It is easily digested and assimilated, it is rich in lime, potas- 
sium, phosphorus and other minerals, and in the most 
important vitamines. 
Meat or fresh fish may be given. It is best not to give 
more than three or four ounces, but this restricted quantity 
may with advantage be spread over two or more meals. 
The extractives of meat are of high relish as a condiment, 
and when a very little meat is eaten with a large accompani- 
ment of vegetables it will promote appetite, and the food will 
probably be better utilized in body building than when a 
larger quantity of meat is eaten with a proportionately smaller 
159
-P-A-G-E-182
    
    160 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
amount of other foods. In this last case the protein of the 
meat, so easily utilized for energy, may be in part diverted 
from its more important function of muscle formation. It is 
difficult to persuade people that not the number of times 
meat is served during the day, but the total quantity, is 
important. The danger of meat twice a day or oftener is 
that so much may be eaten at each meal as to bring up the 
total to more than the wholesome maximum. 
Cheese, except cottage or cream cheese, is best excluded 
or given in very small quantity. 
An egg for breakfast every day now probably may not 
be too much for a vigorous child. Eggs rank [next to 
milk as body builders for the child, they are rich in iron, 
phosphorus, and the fat-soluble vitamine, and the yolk 
contains an easily digested fat. They should be served in 
an easily digested form and the white cooked only to a 
jelly. 
The legumes are best given in the form of purées, or 
milk soups. They should always be thoroughly cooked 
and sifted. The flatulency that often results from the use 
of peas and beans is said to be prevented by the addition 
of lentils, in the proportion of one-eighth to the others. 
Fats. Children seldom care for fat at this age and meat 
fat is apt to be much disliked. Some physiologists attempt 
to account for this by the fact that the growth of both brain 
and nerve tissue, largely composed of nitrogenous fat, is 
now slow. So is the growth of marrow, consequently there 
is less need for fat in the diet. The opinion has been haz- 
arded that when the child demonstrates a pronounced 
dislike of fat, this shows there is no natural demand for it 
by the body, and that to force it on the system may pro- 
duce bad effects in the stomach, or unwholesome reaction 
in the blood. It is true that at this age fat is often found to 
disagree, and it seems as though carbohydrates may best 
be depended on as the source of needed energy, yet if the 
child shows relish for any of the more easily digested forms 
of fat, such as cream, fresh butter, or the fat of toasted 
bacon, these may safely be given.
-P-A-G-E-183
    FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 161 
Suet pudding, when the suet is very finely divided and 
the pudding is light and well made, is permitted in small 
helpings to active children who are much in the open air. 
Carbohydrates. Day-old bread, preferably whole wheat 
or graham, is a valuable source of the needed minerals 
and of the water-soluble vitamine. Twice baked breads 
such as zweiback (unsweetened) and hard crackers necessi- 
tate thorough mastication, and this is good for the teeth 
as well as helpful to digestion. Cereal porridges, provided 
they are made from whole grains, are, like bread, rich in 
minerals and in the water-soluble vitamine. Though oats 
is the most nutritious cereal, the diet should include prepa- 
rations from the others, too, since McCollum’s researches 
have shown that. all of them vary in the kind and amount 
of proteins, amido-acids, minerals, etc., that they contain. 
A mixture of two cereals, such as wheat and oats, barley 
and maize, makes a pleasant novelty. All grains should be 
thoroughly cooked to soften cellulose and develop flavor, 
and they should be attractively served, perhaps with dried 
fruit or baked apples, so that children will relish them. 
Active children at this age, who use up calories of energy 
at the rate of hundreds in an hour, naturally crave sweets, 
which are quick sources of energy, and though sweets in 
moderation are good there is danger of their being eaten 
in excess and the pernicious “candy-habit” formed. A 
little simple candy, preferably homemade, may be given 
after dinner, and such sweets as maple sugar, molasses, 
syrup, a little jam or marmalade, the dried fruits, and 
honey, furnish calories and give relish to the meal. Honey 
is one of the best and wholesomest of natural sweets and 
one that does not often tempt to excess. It may be spread 
on bread, used to sweeten cereals and puddings and in 
many other ways, as a substitute for cane sugar. It is a 
ready source of energy, a slight aid to digestion, being 
classed among the peptogenic substances, and it is laxative. 
Vegetables. Fresh vegetables are essential in the diet 
of child or adult and an insufficiency of vegetables is one 
of the commonest errors in menu making. A starchy
-P-A-G-E-184
  162 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS ~ 
vegetable, one of the greens, and one of the roots or seeds 
with their succulent envelopes, should be served every 
day. The green leaves, such as spinach, different varieties 
of lettuce and chard, and tender green cabbage, are all 
rich in both iron and the important fat-soluble vitamine. 
Spinach, particularly rich in iron, should be cooked so that 
no water remains to be drained off, involving a serious 
loss of all that is most valuable in this vegetable. Beets, 
carrots, and parsnips contain sugar, and these and practi- 
cally all other vegetables are a useful source of minerals and 
of the water-soluble vitamines. Tomatoes, and the sweet 
yellow turnips, are listed with the citrus fruits as containing 
the important anti-scorbutic vitamine. 
Fruits. Practically all of the fresh fruits in season and 
all of the common dried fruits, may now be given to the 
child. Oranges are highly to be recommended, also apples. 
Most fruits may now be eaten raw, if perfectly ripe, and no 
parent should list fruit under the heading of luxuries, since 
it is needed by the child and should be given every day. 
A good habit to form is that of substituting sweet fruits 
for candy. 
Additional Foods Permitted at this Age 
Bananas, if perfectly ripe. The skin of a ripe banana becomes 
dark, but if dark or decayed spots are found in the flesh, these 
should be cut out. Bananas may be baked before the skin 
darkens, but not eaten raw. 
Berries. Berries are allowed after seven years old. 
Cabbage. Tender raw cabbage, shredded or chopped, is usually 
well digested, and so is, often, tender young cabbage when not 
over-cooked. But since the cellulose of cabbage is tough, this 
is sometimes found to cause flatulency, especially if combined 
with milk at the same meal. 
Celery. The tender stalks of raw celery are now usually safe to 
give. : 
Jams and preserves may be sparingly given, for a relish. 
Nuts such as blanched almonds, and pecans, may now be given, 
but other kinds would better be postponed. 
Onions, boiled or steamed until soft.

Foods Still Forbidden 
Cucumbers 
Egg plant 
Radishes 
Tea, coffee, and liquors of all kinds 
Soda water with artificial syrups 
Fried food of all kinds 
Rich dressings and gravies 
Soft, hot breads 
Pickles and pastry 
Pork, and fatty. fish such as mackerel, eel, tuna, etc. 
Sausages, mincemeat, and similar mixtures. 
Nors. — School life is stressful and exciting, therefore not only tea 
and coffee, but highly seasoned dishes and overmuch butchers’ meat, 
should be avoided. As for tea and coffee, no child has any business to 
know the taste of these stimulants before graduation from high school, 
or better, ten years later. Highly seasoned and stimulating foods spoil 
the appetite for milk, and milk is indispensable to the right nourish- 
ment of the child. 
Avoidance of Constipation 
During the school years, especially at their beginning, 
children often suffer from constipation. Girls are more 
likely to be affected than boys, perhaps because they take 
less exercise, but more laxative foods should prevail in the 
diet of both boys and girls than in the years of freer play. 
Oranges are excellent, so are almost all the fresh fruits, 
so are prunes and figs. Prunes are among the very few 
fruits that produce an acid reaction in the body, hence a 
decidedly alkali-forming food like apples or figs, may be 
combined with them. Do not give prunes every day, for 
children seem to become intolerably tired of them. If given 
three times a week, or at different meals on alternate days 
and served in different ways, they will usually be welcome. 
Spinach is an excellent regulator, so is lettuce, chard, and 
other greens. Boiled onions, and finely grated raw parsnips 
are both specifics for constipation.

164 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
The Daily Meals of School Children 
Breakfast. Some children, beginning to attend school, 
are possessed by inordinate desire to “be in time” in the 
morning, and are hardly satisfied unless they reach school 
before the door is opened. If allowed to, these children 
will hurriedly swallow an apology for breakfast without an 
apology for mastication, in nervous eagerness to be off. 
The mother should know that such a breakfast means either 
brain or body exhaustion before the noon meal, with results, 
to a greater or less degree, in retarded growth and develop- 
ment. To soothe and calm this nervousness — never by 
comments upon it — but indirectly and pleasantly, is now 
the mother’s task. The child may be good-humoredly 
reasoned with, or some pleasant distraction used to divert 
the intensity, but he should be made to understand that a 
sufficient, unhurriedly eaten, and well-masticated breakfast 
is a necessary preliminary to setting out for school; and as 
soon as possible he should be encouraged to use his own 
will power in inhibiting nervousness and demonstrating 
calm. 
There is another kind of child that goes to the opposite 
extreme, and has to be urged, pushed, and exhorted to get 
him out in time; but the one who wants to rush off at an 
untimely hour is the one who needs most looking-after — 
as having the more nervous organization. 
Dinner. Whether dinner, the main meal of the day, 
shall for the school child be at noon or after six in the after- 
noon, depends on whether the noon recess permits a sufficient 
meal, unhurriedly eaten, and followed by a short period 
of rest or recreation. Where the distance is short it seems 
best that the child should come home. This makes a break 
in the day, a relief from the strain of large numbers, and 
the mother will be surer that the meal is the right kind. 
The school lunch- or dining-room is an excellent institu- 
tion, but there is often an atmosphere of hurry and excite- 
ment, a drilling of large numbers into line, a desire on the 
part of the child to get out for free play before the next 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
    FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 165 
class, — conditions which make it undesirable for the child 
in at least the beginning years of school. 
The lunch basket, containing hot soup or milky cocoa 
in a thermos bottle, a few nutritious and easily digested 
sandwiches, a salad, fruit, crackers, etc., has often to be 
the compromise, and the child’s real dinner comes at six 
o’clock or after, with the family. 
The last meal of the day should be as light and easily 
digested as possible. Poor sleep, and heavy eyes and small 
appetite for breakfast are often the result of too hearty 
a supper. 
Lunches. During the school years there are unusual 
demands upon the functions of absorption and assimilation 
of food, to build the constantly growing body and to supply 
energy for increased activity. The school child may. con- 
sequently be expected to be in a state of chronic hunger, 
and to save him from nibbling at any and all kinds of eat- 
ables and at any and all hours—a practice decidedly to 
be forbidden — he should be given to understand that one 
or two extra lunches, in the form of a bowl of bread and 
milk or a slice of bread and butter, may be had for the 
asking. One kindly disposed authority goes so far as to say: 
“Tf a child is hungry enough to eat bread and butter he 
should have it at any time, day or night, that he asks for 
it.” Probably all authorities will agree that any time a 
child asks for a glass of milk, day or night, he should 
have it. 
Three meals a day are not enough for a growing child. 
If the rising hour is early and the breakfast does not quickly 
follow, a cup of warm milk immediately after dressing will 
“kill the worm” (to use an old-fashioned phrase), without 
hurting the appetite for breakfast. The mid-morning bottle 
of milk, now an honored institution in many schools, cannot 
be too highly recommended. Similarly, on returning from 
school, when children are likely to make a straight line for 
the cooky jar or cake box, some light and wholesomer 
refreshment should be provided to rival those attractions. 
If the dinner is at six o’clock, this three or four o’clock
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
lunch may be heartier, to ensure that the last meal of the 
day shall be light. 
Children from eight years on are old enough consciously 
to practise self-restraint, to inhibit impulses to anger, 
rebellion, sins of the tongue, and other temptations. Their 
battles are sometimes hard, and self-conquest is difficult. 
Extra nourishment is needed after such a strain, as recom- 
mended on pages 72 and 111. 
Instances of Some Results of Diet 
Government reports show that one-third of the men 
examined for service in the late war were rejected for dis- 
orders which could be directly traced to improper feeding 
in childhood. Surely no more forceful lesson should be 
needed by mothers as to the importance of right nourishment 
for children. 
In one of our city school systems a dull child of low 
mental ability, who for three years had been unable to 
advance in her school work, was experimentally fed a bowl 
of nutritious milk soup at 10 a.m. every morning. In a 
single year she covered three years’ work and took her 
place as a normal pupil. 
School and Study From Six to Ten 
I. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE ScHOOL 
At six years old, and sometimes sooner, the child is sup- 
posed to be ready to enter on regular school life, and to suffer 
the processes of formal education. The word “supposed” 
is purposely used, for some of the best authorities on edu- 
cation, and some of the most careful students of child life, 
contend that home, rather than school, is the place where 
children up to eight years old may best be developed, both 
physically and mentally, 
“Up to the age of seven or eight,” says a noted educator, 
“nutrition rather than schooling, is the greatest need of 
the child, and school life interferes with nutrition.” 
“School discipline,” says another, “is injurious to the

development of the brain before this organ has reached its 
full weight, which is not before the age of eight.” 
“Tt has been the experience of mothers who kept their 
children at home until the seventh year was complete, or 
even the eighth,” writes a third, “that both the health of 
the child and its progress in studies was markedly superior 
to that of children who had attended school from six years 
on. The children who began later quickly caught up with 
the others, and after this they showed more staying power 
and better mentality.” 
Reasons why school is not good for children at so early 
an age, culled from various authorities, run as follows in 
points of general agreement. 
1. Unwholesome Excitements. School life is too exciting, 
both from the strain of association with numbers so much 
larger than those in the home circle, and also because of 
constant stimulus from the teacher. It is true that the 
child of six and younger ought to learn to adjust himself 
to persons outside of his own family, but not to the numbers 
in a large school. 
2. Unnatural Discipline. School life is unnatural at this 
physically formative age, when the best means for develop- 
ment are found in abundance of fresh air and sleep, of 
wholesome food, of work and play in which the spontaneity 
of the, child is as much as possible allowed to assert itself. 
The confinement of school, the impure air, and the forced 
assimilation of knowledge, interfere more or less with normal 
growth. 
3. Excessive Demands on Involuntary Attention. During 
the periods of instruction the calls for what pedagogues 
have named “involuntary attention,” — meaning atten- 
tion to a subject chosen by the teacher rather than to one 
which the child himself elects— are excessively long. 
According to psychologists, the child of six cannot give 
enforced attention for a longer consecutive period than a 
maximum of fifteen minutes. In the first year of most of 
the primary schools fifteen minutes is the minimum, rather 
than the maximum length of the periods, and they are

    168 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
sometimes extended to twenty minutes, notably those 
which come late in the day, when the child is tired. The 
consequence is that the child’s attention wanders, which 
means time is wasted; or that it is held by over-stimulation 
from the teacher, which means injury to mind or body. 
The schedule demands from the child a psychological 
impossibility. 
4. Checking of Voluntary Attention. A child of six and over 
can give voluntary attention for periods very much longer 
than fifteen minutes. He will make cakes in the sand, 
or build a high and tottering tower of bricks, sometimes 
for an hour at a time — but this will be purely at his own, 
and not at a teacher’s volition. Much of the work assigned 
in school, many of its occupations, will be sure to enlist 
the child’s natural, involuntary attention, greatly to please 
him,.and make him desire to continue them. Therefore 
to cut up the day at the stroke of the clock — to insist 
during one period on attention to something the child cares 
nothing about, and at the close of the next to drag him away 
on schedule time from something which captivates him, 
is mentally confusing and is a long way from education 
according to nature. 
5. Overlong Hours. From nine to three, with a noon 
recess of forty-five minutes, and four recesses of twenty 
minutes each between classes, is too hard a grind for a six- 
year-old, and too rigidly inflexible. Compare the schedule 
of hours in many of our schools with the following scale 
framed in accordance with the physiological and psycho- 
logical needs of the child. 
      Age Estimated Hours of School 
From five to six years. . . 6 hours a week, or one hour and 
20 minutes of school work daily for 
five days each week. 
From six to seven years . . 9 hours a week, or one hour and 48 
minutes a day for five days a week. 
From seven to eight years . 12 hours a week, or two hours and 
24 minutes a day for the school week 
of five days.
-P-A-G-E-191
    
FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 169 
From eight to nine years . 15 hours a week, or three hours a 
day for the school week. 
From nine to ten years . . 18 hours a week, or little more than 
three and one-half hours daily for 
the school week. 
So far are we from conformity with the above standards, 
that in many schools there are now imposed on our six- 
year-olds, allowing for recess periods, more hours of school 
work than the maximum for the age of nine to ten. Also, the 
recess periods are too often over-supervised, too many pre- 
scribed exercises are demanded, so that the child has hardly 
a chance to escape the sense of strain and to relax naturally. 
Unsuitable Studies. Up to eight years old the child’s 
brain is increasing in size, but is not doing much in the 
line of functioning. Nutrition of this organ, not training, 
is called for. Simple nature study, stories from the old 
nature and other myths, narrative history, drawing and 
clay modelling spontanegusly undertaken, and free play, 
should fill the child’s life. Reading and writing should not 
now be insisted on. Arithmetic is hurtful, calling as it does 
for a premature brain-functioning. To compel the child 
at this time to study arithmetic may be compared to an 
insistence on his taking long walks at the age of three or 
four. (See page 100.) He may be forced to accomplish it, 
but at the cost of normal and healthy growth of the feet 
in one case, of the brain in the other. 
That the young brain has not been improperly taxed is 
the reason why children who begin school at eight years 
old are found to make better progress than those who began 
at six. 
6. Ill-Fitting School Furniture. Too few of our schools 
provide seats and desks adapted in shape, height, and 
construction to the anatomy of the child. Too few of the 
chair-backs are suited to the compound backward and 
forward curves of the growing spine, too many of them 
cause present discomfort, and may induce future mal- 
formation. Too few of the seats are adjustable to children 
of different height and build in the same class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  170 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
II. Arguments 1n Favor or THE ScHoou 
The first and perhaps the chief argument for sending 
children to school at six years old, is that they now need 
the broadening of human relations that comes from varied 
associations outside of the home and family. The child, 
we are told, is now ‘“‘going through the period which symbol- 
izes the chumship-activity of the race. It symbolizes man’s 
going out from the family to friends outside the family, 
of association with other men, of winning their respect 
by show of his own powers and achievements.” To meet 
other children, to work with them, play with them, measure 
himself against them, to take part in another and larger 
social institution than the family, is now one of the needs 
of his development, and if the child is not sent to school 
this need should, in some other way, be satisfied. 
The objection to the rigorous and inflexible schedule is 
met by an assertion of its benefit in making for orderliness 
in life, for the harmony of regularity and sequence. (Yet 
it is admitted that it should give way to an absorbed interest 
on the part of the child, and this can be provided for in a 
small class.) 
As in the kindergarten, so in the primary school, the 
teacher is the most important factor, and should be the 
dominating factor in the choice of the school. A finely- 
trained, sympathetic, and experienced teacher of little 
children will regard the welfare and interest of the child as 
more important than the course of study; and will adapt 
the last to the first, rather than the first to the last; she will 
know how and when to “let up.” 
Also, conditions in many places are better than we have 
painted them, and progressive educators are now awake 
to the importance of primary teaching. Strides of advance 
are being made in fitting the course of study to the child 
rather than compelling the child to fit the course. In many 
of the schools the mother will now find the subjects chosen 
for this age are in accord with its psychology and the methods 
used are in harmony with its physiology, — though unfor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 171 
tunately there are still in vogue in some of the old, conserv- 
ative school systems, all the bad, hard-shell, unpedagogical 
methods and rules. 
When the mother elects to send the child to school, she 
should, when possible, choose a school where there is the so- 
called transition class or sub-primary between the kinder- 
garten and the first grade — provided it is conducted by 
a teacher who has instincts for both kindergarten and 
primary work. ‘The mother should demand a shorter 
school day during at least the first two years; and on visit- 
ing the school she should satisfy herself that there is a sepa- 
rate room for each grade, that there are no more than ten 
—or at most fifteen — children in each class, and that 
seats and desks are of the best type. If mothers band 
together in making public the existing faults in a defective 
school, and in demanding the best for the children, their 
demands will be heard. 
There is, in our best public school systems, an increasingly 
intelligent care of the health of children. Contagion is 
guarded against, and school nurses, school doctors and 
dentists and oculists— also psychotherapists — look after 
the children better than they could be cared for in many 
homes. Even the diet of children is often reformed. 
There is, too, a contagion of good example. Children will 
fall in line and do what other children do, more easily than 
they will at home carry out the desires of the parent as to 
matters of behavior and hygiene. 
Further, many children are happier after beginning school 
than before. Companionship with their kind, new friend- 
ships, fellowship in work, new games and activities all have 
a beneficial effect. Even nervous children are often helped 
to poise by a well-poised teacher. 
But if a child is made nervous or irritable by school life, 
or if there is a reaction of apathy and dullness, or if the 
teacher is disliked or fails to win confidence and affection, 
a vacation of a few weeks may be indicated, — or a change 
of school. 
Lastly, the argument is often advanced that life in school 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  
172 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
is better for the child than life in an unwholesome home 
atmosphere, or under the misdirection of the wrong kind 
of mother. Of these, there are unfortunately many. Then 
the school, far though it may be from being at its best, 
will yet be better for the child than the company of the wrong 
mother, the average nursemaid, the casual care-taker, or 
life in the streets. 
Supplementary Schooling in the Home 
Correlation of Home and School. It is a good thing for 
parents to keep up with what their children are learning in 
school, and to ask interested questions aa it. They 
should encourage the children to talk about their studies, 
and should stimulate their correlation with life outside of 
the school by getting them to use the knowledge acquired 
in school. They will do well to visit classes now and then, 
to make acquaintance with the teachers, and attend Parent- 
Teacher meetings. 
Language and Grammar. Unless children learn correct 
grammar and pronunciation, clear enunciation, and good 
modulation of the speaking voice in the home, it is hardly 
to be expected that they shall learn them in school. These 
are among the graces best acquired abuse and 
through imitation. 
Well-written story books, as soon as the child is able 
to read, will be of more help than formal lessons at this 
age. From six to eight are good years to let the child learn 
foreign languages by hearing them spoken, and reading 
easy narratives in these languages as he reads similar stories 
in the vernacular. Never will vocabulary, accent, and pro- 
nunciation be acquired as easily as now, when the verbal 
memory is good and the tongue is limber; consequently 
if opportunity is not found in the home or with intimate 
associates it is advisable that the child should begin con- 
versational lessons. But the formal rules of grammar, 
may, like those of English grammar, better be left until 
the next stage. 
Spelling. Bad spelling is a disease of the present genera-   
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 173 
tion, and shocking to those of us who were brought up to 
regard an untruth and a mis-spelled word as equally dis- 
graceful. Many theories are advanced to account for the 
present weakness in spelling, but if the child does not learn 
to spell correctly during the ninth and tenth years the 
mother must make up this lack at home, for we are told 
that unless correct spelling becomes a habit before the 
eleventh year the chances are only one in ten that the child 
will ever, in later life, be sure of himself as a speller. 
Telling Time by the Clock. This simple art should be ac- 
quired, whether in home or school, during the first two 
years of this period. It is sometimes attempted during the 
kindergarten years, but time is not of great interest to the 
child until real school begins. Children often find it difficult 
to read time by the clock, then it seems to come to them 
suddenly. 
Memory Training. Modern methods of education are 
also accused of neglect to train the memory, and the parent 
should do it if the school does not. Ancient education 
. placed emphasis on the memorization of poetry, and long 
poems were committed to memory before reading and writ- 
ing were taught. From eight to ten are the years of ready 
memory and this is the time to learn worth-while poems by 
heart. It is true that from three years up the child ought 
naturally to memorize verse from hearing it; but formal 
memorizing of from one poem a month to forty poems a year, 
should begin at six. Let the children choose the poems, 
but let the parent see to it that nothing trashy is offered 
for choice. Let taste be formed and memory cultivated 
on things the child will not outgrow, such as great simple 
poetry, Bible stories and psalms; but let these be attractive 
to the child for what he finds in them here and now. Says 
P. L. MacClintock (“Literature in the Elementary School’’) 
“The merest primary child can enjoy the heroic or amusing 
adventures of Odysseus; he will enjoy them equally when 
he is forty, but by that time he will have added the ability 
to appreciate also the profound knowledge of human nature, 
the large mental and religious atmosphere of the poem.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-196
    174. CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Narrative History and Biography. The elementary history 
now taught in school may be supplemented in the home 
by tales during the story hour, of the great historical char- 
acters and events in our own and other countries. For such 
subjects in story form the child has at this age an instinctive 
interest and a natural ability. 
Nature Study. The names and habits of the birds, beasts, 
butterflies, trees, flowers, and all familiar growing things, 
should now be learned at home if not in school, and if learned 
in school should be further developed at home. The child 
delights in nature study at this age and it should have a 
larger place in the school curriculum. 
Music. Music is taught in school during these years, 
_ but unless it is first known and loved in the home there is 
danger that the school will find the instinct already dwarfed. 
Piano lessons are often begun at six years old or seven, 
and will be a natural sequence to the notes and chords the 
child has loved to strike on the home piano. Like drawing, 
it is early for much formal instruction, and unless there is 
decided musical ability the lessons may well be postponed 
until the ninth year. 
The violin, we are told, has to be begun young, and teachers 
of the violin are always on the lookout for the embryo 
virtuoso, who, if he is to develop into a great violinist, ought 
to begin on the quarter-size instrument not later than six. 
But unless there are extraordinary gifts the lessons may 
better be postponed for three years longer. 
The child should learn to sing tunefully, naturally. De- 
light in dramatization is a characteristic of this period, 
and children will dramatize better in singing, they will 
recite better, and the singing voice seems to afford them a 
better means of self-expression than the speaking voice. 
Drawing. Normal children, when allowed to develop 
naturally, will draw before they write— as did the race. 
Their first attempts will probably be meaningless to the 
grown-up, because they are not yet able to control the 
muscles needed for anything that deserves the name of 
drawing — nor should they be required to if the child’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY § 175 
power of free self-expression is to be unhampered. But 
by seven or eight years old they should be able to draw 
in simple and quite telling lines. Not until then should 
there be formal teaching of what Lukens calls the alphabet 
or rudiments of drawing, while the beginnings of technique 
or grammar of the art should be deferred until the beginning 
of the ninth year. “But if the power to draw is not acquired 
before the end of the ninth year,” says one of the Reports 
of the Massachusetts Board of Education, “it is not acquired 
in the public schools.”

Children’s Questions. Someone says that the best way to 
educate a child of six is by answering his spontaneous ques- 
tions. This, however, would call for the entire time of a 
person endowed with the wisdom of one oft-quoted Bible 
character and the patience of another! Questions, however, 
should be answered, simply and clearly, when put through 
a genuine desire for information. Sometimes a half-tired 
or bored child who has nothing better to do will exert him- 
self to ask questions merely to relieve the monotony. This 
is the time for a mother to offer some pleasant distraction, 
without other comment. 
One of the questions pretty sure to be asked now by the 
child deals with how he came into this world. The truth 
should always be told, adapting it to the child’s under- 
standing at this age. Storks may do for an earlier age 
—though many mothers tell the truth from the beginning. 
That the child grew from a little seed planted in a soft 
bag kept in a warm place, out of which he pushed himself 
when big enough, as a chicken does from the shell, may be 
told to quite small children, and will contain no element 
of untruth to be afterwards unlearned. Tell in a matter- 
of-fact way, and do not stimulate further curiosity. The 
story of the mother carrying the unborn child “under her 
heart” we rather object to because of its sentimentality — 
also because it conveys a physiological falsehood.

Growth and Development From Six to Ten Years 
Height and Weight. An old popular belief was that the 
child’s height at birth should be doubled before the sixth 
birthday — thus the child twenty inches tall at birth should 
when six years old be forty inches — and though the child 
may not conform to this standard and yet be normally 
well and vigorous, it is nevertheless a pretty good rule of 
thumb. 
Observers have found that there is but little growth 
between the ages of eight and ten, after which a renewed 
growth in height may be expected.

It allows for a wide range in different heights and weights at 
different ages — thus, a boy at 6 years old may be from 38 to 50 
inches tall, and may weigh 34 to 57 pounds. 
The average weight for a given height, during the years between

The weighing and measuring are done in ordinary indoor cloth- 
ing, after shoes, sweaters, and boys’ coats, are removed. The re- 
mainder of the clothing is supposed not to weigh more than from 
two to three pounds. 
Percentage Allowable Over or Under. Normal Weight. If 
a child under twelve years old is 10 per cent or more under 
the average weight for height, this should be reported to 
the physician. 
If a child under twelve years old is 20 per cent or more 
heavier than is right for the height, this too, shows need of 
the doctor’s opinion. 
Over twelve, 10 per cent under the right weight for height; 
or 15 per cent overweight needs consultation with the 
physician. 
Weight and Height as Signs of Health. There is a vital 
relation between advance in growth and physical health 
and parents are rightly disturbed when children are under- 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  178 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
weight. Yet, of all the tables of normal weight and height 
for different ages no two are wholly in agreement. Here 
is one reason why a slight divergence from any table of 
normal weight or height should not cause alarm. Another 
is that height and weight do not keep step with one another. 
According to nature’s habit of attending to one thing at 
a time, she will stimulate children to growing tall in spring 
and summer, and increasing in weight in autumn and winter. 
Also, there will be certain years for growing tall, and others 
for growing heavy through increase in size of internal organs. 
Surer signs of health are that a child sleeps well; eats simple 
food with an appetite; that his skin is clear, with good 
color in cheeks, lips, eyelids, and ear lobes; that his eyes 
are clear and bright, without puffiness under them; his 
tongue clear and red; his nerves steady; his hair abundant 
and glossy; that he is alert, eager for play, good-humored 
and happy. 
Signs of Lack of Health. Surer signs of lack of health than 
being slightly underweight are languidness, restlessness, 
malaise, disturbed sleep, poor appetite, and in general the 
reverse of the conditions mentioned as indications of health. 
Second Dentition. Second dentition will be in full force 
during these years and it sometimes begins earlier. The 
child from five to seven begins to lose the front teeth 
and disfiguring gaps in the front of the mouth will keep 
the little girl for awhile from looking her prettiest. When 
the permanent front teeth, or middle incisors in upper and 
lower jaws, appear, this is a time when likeness to either 
father or mother may be emphasized by similarity of these 
teeth. 
At eight years old, or from seven to nine, the lateral inci- 
sors, or the next-to-the-middle front teeth, may be looked for. 
From nine to eleven years the first bicuspids, or two- 
pointed teeth, will probably displace the “eye” and 
“stomach” teeth of infancy; and a year later will probably 
find the second molars of the baby replaced by the second 
bicuspids of the adult, which come next to that permanent 
molar which the mother so often thinks is a belated milk

tooth. (See page 133.) This leaves only one temporary 
tooth (at each side of each jaw) to fall, and since it is not 
usually lost until the child is well past ten, both this one 
and the others of the permanent set will be discussed in the 
next chapter. 
Girls as a rule lose the temporary teeth and grow the 
permanent ones earlier than boys, but race, family, environ- 
ment, and other things influence this and all other phases 
of development. 
Effects of Second Dentition on General Health. Careful 
students of children find certain transition periods, when 
the child, in passing from one stage of development to 
another, lets down physically and mentally during the 
time of adjustment. (See ‘‘ Pedagogical Seminar,” Vol. VII, 
p. 357). One of these important transition times is during 
second dentition. Our attention is called to the fact that 
dealers in horses for the market say that when the horse 
is getting his second teeth at four years old, the animal 
has not as much strength or endurance as it had at three 
years — nor as it will have at five after second dentition 
is complete. ‘The four-year-old horse,” says the dealer, 
“is less trustworthy.” Similarly, our authority asserts, 
when the child at eight years old is losing his first teeth 
and the second ones are coming he fatigues more readily 
than he did at seven, or than he will at nine. 
“Hight years old” is only an approximate term. It 
stands for the period when the temporary teeth are first 
giving way to the permanent, with accompanying demon- 
strations of variable health and uncertain nerves. The 
“Jet-down” may come ahead of schedule time, it may 
come later; it lasts longer with some children, shorter 
with others. Its symptoms are lassitude, capricious appe- 
tite, disturbed sleep, etc., and the child is irritable, lazy 
and dull — qualities incompatible with normal childhood. 
This is not the time to give a tonic and try to stimulate 
interest in exercise, it is the time to let the child rest, lie 
on the grass or in a hammock, be out-of-doors as long as 
he likes.

The child now is not so well able to stand the strain of 
a school program that is logical rather than physiological, 
and if he has been in school from the age of six he may have 
to be taken out for some months to recuperate. 
It is possible that many of the troubles at this age come 
from poor mastication of food, due to loose old teeth or 
tender gums from the pushing out of the new. They may 
however be caused by the general unevenness of develop- 
ment which will be discussed in the next paragraph. 
Muscular Development. The development of children 
may never be expected to proceed in a straight line and at 
a uniform rate. Nature seems to abhor straight lines and 
a regular progress and prefers to advance in rhythmic 
curves. These, after the manner of curves, will sometimes 
dip and sometimes rise, but the plane of the rhythm will 
always ascend. 
At the age of seven or eight a child’s muscles grow faster 
than his circulatory system — according to nature’s way 
of attending to one thing at a time— consequently the 
child will increase in size and weight before his heart muscle 
and blood vessels have developed sufficiently to give service 
to this larger body. This is the time to be watchful for 
signs of shortness of breath and poverty of blood. The 
child may tire quicker than before and have seasons of 
being under par. At this age there is also rapid growth 
of the nerves,-and nervous instability with upsets of diges- 
tion and general nutrition, may be found to accompany 
the one-sided development of the eight-year-old. 
Differentiation of Sex. Many observers of child life say 
that by the age of six at latest the child will have become 
a little boy or a little girl. Others believe that up to ten 
years old there is but slight physiological dissimilarity 
between boys and girls, and no positive psychological 
unlikenesses except such as parents or teachers have arti- 
ficially fostered. But many of the mother-students of their 
own children — women whose lives have been too much 
occupied in caring for the small people to have time to 
write about them — tell us that their boys have been boys 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
       FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 181 
from the first cry. This cry, so they say, was a manful, 
egoistic, attention-demanding one; their first steps in 
walking were more vigorous, they were from the age of 
twelve or fourteen months more prone to embark upon 
intrepid and dangerous adventures. They were from the 
start, emphatically boys! 
Perhaps all the observers were right and only the children 
they generalized from were different. Anyway, so long as 
little boys and girls show pretty much the same character- 
istics it is well not to force the differences. When allowed 
to develop naturally they will appear at the right time. 
Care and Training From Six to Ten Years 
Hours for Sleep. The afternoon nap is usually given up 
after school life begins, but if even a short sleep can be 
managed after the child comes home it will do much towards 
counteracting the strain of toilsome adventures in formal 
education. The child of seven years old, whether in school 
or not, needs from twelve to thirteen hours sleep, depending 
on the degree to which he is nervously organized. Children 
should have lots of sleep in order to develop stable nerves. 
Let us repeat what we said before. Sleep is largely a matter 
of habit. It should be encouraged by regular hours and no 
excitement or stimulating play immediately before bedtime, 
which at seven should not be later than half-past seven or 
eight. 
After the eighth birthday the child may be allowed to 
sit up a half-hour later; and after each succeeding birthday, 
up to and including the tenth, bedtime hour may be thirty 
minutes later. 
Care of Person. From six years on the child should be 
able to dress himself fully without assistance — except 
perhaps in the case of a girl’s hair ribbon. Children should 
be able to take without assistance the daily cool shower 
and biweekly warm bath followed by a cool douche; also 
to brush hair, brush teeth, keep finger nails clean, and in 
general to attend to the care of the person. Military 
inspection will be needed for a time, but this may or may 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
     182 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
not be informal. Besides being responsible for personal 
neatness, boys and girls should be given simple lessons in 
hygiene, in the use of individual towels, handkerchiefs, 
drinking vessels, toilet articles; they should know when 
and how to use a gargle, and how to care hygienically for 
the eyes, nose, ears, and feet. They should form ideals 
of health and be proud of a good posture and walk, proud 
of being strong and healthy and of working towards the 
end of good citizenship and potential service through health 
of body and mind. 
Posture and Carriage. The good habits of posture, etc., 
formed during an earlier period (see page 114), should be 
emphasized and the child’s codperation enlisted. Child- 
ren’s chairs should, as before, be fitted to them, and slouch- 
ing in the seat so as to sit on the end of the spine rather 
than on the buttocks, should not be permitted. The follow- 
ing counsels are given by Dr. Hugh Chaplin, Chairman of 
the N. Y. Nutrition Council, etc. “The child should stand 
with the toes pointing forward, the chest forward of the 
line of abdomen, and the abdomen flat. The shoulders 
should be in line with the ears, the body held easily and not 
stiff and strained.’ In correcting faults of posture, he says, 
the child should be instructed to place the feet parallel, 
to grip the floor with the toes (to raise arches), flatten 
abdomen, push up with top of head while holding the chin 
in, to allow the arms to hang loosely at the side, and to 
breathe easily. Instead of the old-fashioned command 
to keep ‘‘shoulders back,” the child is now directed to 
“stand tall,” to “sit as tall as possible,” with better results. 
Results of Faulty Posture. These are: bad circulation, 
with its attendant tendency to frequent colds; constipation, 
indigestion, and poor appetite; impairment of good looks 
and appearance, with consequent self-consciousness and 
awkwardness — less personality. More serious results are 
displacements of internal organs. 
Setting-Up Exercises. Where the morning setting-up 
exercises, broadcast by radio at 7 a.M., are available, and 
where father and children go through them together, as is 
    
-P-A-G-E-207
     FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 183 
the practice in some families, this makes not only for health, 
but for an excellent fellowship between parent and children. 
Training in Relaxation. Children at this age are capable 
of intense concentration, both mentally and physically, and 
after periods of great absorption they should be trained to 
relax, to roll on the floor, stretch themselves like puppies or 
kittens, and “let go” all over. Similarly, when the child 
has for a time been under the strain of unnatural good 
behavior, such as silence and stillness in church, or company 
manners at table—both of which should be required — 
let them work it off afterwards in unhindered exuberance, 
in shouts and vigorous exercise. Nature calls for this re- 
action, and it is a satisfying and wholesome thing to find 
boys and girls liberating great spurts of energy when school 
“lets out” for the day. This is a time when all the pent-up 
noise and motion should also be “let out,” and school 
authorities are pitifully mistaken who insist on a prim and 
decorous procession for so long as the children are in sight. 
Pulse and Temperature. From slight and transient 
causes the temperature of a child under ten may go up to 
100° F., and the pulse may race while nothing is going 
on to call for alarm. Only when abnormal pulse and tem- 
perature are maintained for a while is there need of attention. 
Hints on Dress. The girl at five or six years old may be 
promoted from the bloomer suits to the one-piece school 
frock, box pleated, worn with a belt, and let out under 
the pleats for width and at the hem for length. For play 
or in the country the sacque frocks with bloomers of the 
same material may be worn up to ten years, and these play 
dresses should be of pretty colors, fast dyes, strong enough 
material to stand output of energy without giving way, 
and preferably of crepe weave, easy to wash and needing 
neither starching nor ironing. 
At six years old, or when he first enters school, the boy 
should have his first hair cut by a real barber, and his first 
tailor-made short trousers and jacket. Small boys some- 
times go into barber shops and trousers long before they 
are old enough to appreciate the distinction, or to remember     
  
-P-A-G-E-208
     184 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
it with a thrill for as long as they live. It seems a pity 
that this form of the forcing process should deprive the child 
of the conscious pleasure of mounting the first steps towards 
manhood. These thrills of pleasure should be part of the 
rich memory-treasure of the years to come, but when the 
child is man-tailored and barbered at three he is too young 
to know how much it means to him. 
Money Allowance Now in Order. From the time the child 
begins school, if not before, a small money allowance ought 
to be given every week. This should be increased from 
year to year until the child can earn his own spending 
money, and with the allowance there should also be given 
the responsibility of providing from it some personal need 
of dress, etc., from shoestrings or hair ribbons in the earlier 
years to shoes and hats later. Let the children make mis- 
takes in their spending, and learn by them. 
This is a selfish age, often (says Sergeant Bellasis) because 
children have never practiced giving pleasure. To give a 
child a sum of money on his birthday, or before Christmas, 
to spend on presents for everyone in the house, from the 
kitchenmaid to the father, has been found highly successful 
in proving the joy of giving. 
It is also well that from his allowance the child should 
voluntarily contribute to church and charity. A girl lately 
told us, in regard to offerings in church, that one of her 
governesses made her contribute, while she inwardly rebelled 
—but the next governess made her want to do it, while 
apparently giving her freedom of choice. Surely the more 
excellent way. 
A woman of our acquaintance confesses that in adult 
life she had to school herself to contribute at the church 
offertory because she was unwillingly compelled to do it 
when a child. Naturally she was generous and would 
give all she had to some other child, or to a poor woman, 
but the compulsion of giving made her, to use her own 
words, “‘a stingy little pig in church.” This reaction will 
be continued under the heading ‘‘Obedience vs. Free Will,” 
on page 187-8. 
    
-P-A-G-E-209
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 185 
Payment for Services in the Home. The child’s money 
allowance may also be conditioned on specified services 
in the home, to be performed either regularly, or in times 
of need. In the latter case the recompense should be made 
independently of the allowance and at the market rates 
for similar work, and the money so earned should be given 
to the child to spend, so far as possible, as he pleases. But 
the parents should guard against the thought on the part 
of the child that all service in the home should be paid for; 
certain extra assistance when guests are visiting or when 
house-cleaning time comes, or some unforeseen emergency, 
may be asked for, on a purely business basis, in return for 
a specified wage which might otherwise have to be paid 
to a worker outside of the family. Ordinarily, each child 
should realize that he should contribute help in the main- 
tenance of his own home. The boys may wash the car as 
their help towards the rides, the girls may mow the lawn 
or weed the garden, and both may help with the cooking, 
bed making, and dishes. Both for the purpose of teaching 
principles of self-help and mutual aid, also of payment 
for extra services rendered, the servantless home is much 
to the advantage of its growing members. Realizing this, 
parents of our acquaintance deliberately chose the incon- 
venience of doing without a maid, and of practicing other 
needless economies, for the sake of the better moral oppor- 
tunities for their children. 
Sensitiveness to Ridicule. Girls— perhaps also boys — 
at nine or thereabouts, are very sensitive to ridicule; it 
hurts and outrages the young personality. From this they 
should be protected up to the later age of independence 
and give-and-take. Such sensitiveness is sometimes, most 
improperly, made use of to win obedience by ridicule and 
mockery of a child’s self-will. Such sensitiveness is often 
cruelly wounded by insisting on points of conduct, articles 
of dress, etc., not usual with the child’s companions, and 
which throw her into an objectionable prominence and 
singularity. 
Cultivation of Sense of Humor. Some children at this age 
   
-P-A-G-E-210
  186 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
have a true sense of humor and it is not too soon to begin 
to cultivate it. A keen sense of humor should overcome 
sensitiveness to ridicule, and it is good for people to be able 
to laugh at themselves. Somebody says that next to reli- 
gion a sense of humor is the most valuable endowment. It 
is a saving grace in that it helps objective “looking out” 
instead of introspective “looking in.” 
We know a father who began the training in humor of 
a solemn little daughter at the age of six — with excellent 
success. He said he wanted her life to be happy and wanted 
her to sweeten it for others. 
Social Life in the Home. From six years on, as the social 
sense develops and is manifested by preference for social 
games, is the time to have children’s parties, and to teach 
correct social behavior for both hosts and guests. Yet 
there should be an absence of stiffness and formality at 
such parties, not too much artificiality, not too much 
dressing up in clothes too fussy or pretty for play. 
We should probably demand too much of the mother 
in the way of foregoing pleasure to herself if we asked her 
not to celebrate the child’s birthday until it comes to the 
sixth or even seventh. A definite celebration at this time, 
a recognition of the lately discovered and rapidly growing 
self, will mean more to the child than the younger birthdays 
when one or more candles decorated a cake he was either 
unconscious of, or which meant to him nothing more than 
a cake and candles. The significance of a birthday, and its 
celebration in thanksgiving for the member of the family 
born on that day, should be explained, and privileges as 
well as gifts should be awarded — especially privileges 
implying more freedom of the will. 
In recommending a postponement of the recognition of 
the birthday we recognize that the custom of the place 
and what is being done with regard to it by other mothers 
has to be taken into account. From six on, however, all 
sorts of anniversaries may be joyfully and appropriately 
celebrated and made occasions for the exchange of gifts. 
Speaking of gifts, it is better not to give a surfeit at 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY _ 187 
Christmas or on the birthday — or if several have to be 
given, let a lot of them be perishables, or devise some way 
to pass them on. Also, it is a good thing to take the child 
to choose his own gifts. The wrong kind of doll — or jack- 
knife — often means heartbreak or chagrin. A “surprise” 
gift is often a risk. 
From now on, too, the child should feel free to invite 
playmates and friends to the home on his own account. 
A request for a party, a social evening, a chum to spend 
the night, should be made and granted as a matter of course, 
and the parents should coéperate in providing entertain- 
ment. More than this, where the family is small or there 
is an only child, the parents should deliberately provide 
for the comradeship of outsiders and have other children 
for callers, guests, and habitues of the home as frequently 
as possible. 
Obedience vs. Free Will. The older the child grows and the 
more he develops in strength of will the more intolerant 
he will be of commands which rouse protest from that will. 
The habit of obedience along certain lines should still per- 
sist, but this is the time for the parent to recognize, so far 
as possible, the rights of the child in the ordering of his own 
life, and it is not the time to over-foster a habit which should 
not be permanently maintained. Too much insistence on 
obedience for obedience sake will now either weaken the will 
or most surely sow seeds of future alienation from the parent. 
This is a questioning age with the child, and somebody 
says that to his quite natural question: ““Why must I do 
this?” any parent who answers: ‘Because I wish it,” or 
“Because I say so,’ should be taken out and shot at dawn. 
This is the time for adults to search their hearts for love of 
authority and reluctance to let it go. 
After eight years old, if not before, it is good to let the 
child make his own choices and strengthen his will through 
using it. The process may best be begun by giving freedom 
in small matters of little consequence, and gradually begin- 
ning more serious training in self-government. As soon 
as the child is old enough to form ideals of fine conduct
-P-A-G-E-212
  
  188 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
he will usually be found to choose the best when two courses 
are presented to him — one hard and right, the other easy 
and wrong. 
A child is also helped to obey by suggestion and imita- 
tion, by stories from history where obedience resulted 
in the success of some great undertaking, by instances of 
the heroic obedience of soldiers, of the need of obedience 
to State and Federal law and encouragement of pride in 
this. Then, after the parent has helped the child as much 
as possible to overcome an uncurbed will, or any other fault, 
let him always know that he was the conqueror, that he 
did the overcoming, and show approbation and pride in 
his strength. 
Obedience to an outside law rather than the will or 
preference of the parent should always be stressed. The 
laws of health should be implicitly obeyed; so should the 
laws of the house, its rules of punctuality, order, and 
the like. In calling attention to these, one of our authorities 
recommends “gentle requests for girls, military commands 
for boys.’”’ Always the parent has to guard against stimu- 
lating what the biologists call negative response to the 
stimulus — as in the case of the compulsion to give at 
the offertory in church, instanced on page 184. To force 
on the boy or girl of this age a disliked article of dress, 
an abhorred food, an uncongenial campanion, or a displeas- 
ing exercise, is often to confirm the dislike for life. 
Courtesy in the Home. This should be one of the laws of 
the house, one of the habits to be impressed for life. There 
is no reason why members of a family should not be as 
courteous to one another as to strangers or guests. Greater 
frankness is one of the privileges of such close and intimate 
union, but the frankness need not be brutal. When rude 
personal remarks, violent contradiction and disputes, and 
selfish self-assertion are common “family failings” it is 
not to be wondered at that the fledglings, once their wings 
are strong enough, fly from the home. 
When School is Out. Everyone knows the excess of 
exuberance that comes with the closing of school for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 189 
day. It is a necessary and healthful reaction to its restric- 
tions, and that the children are free to shout and jump 
and do pretty much as they please may be one reason why 
they so often live unharmed through its mistaken discipline. 
(See page 183.) 
Earlier in the life of the child the mother was advised 
to be present at its awakening from sleep. (See page 107.) 
Similarly, she is now enjoined to make a point of being at 
home to meet the children on their return from school. 
They often need “mothering” after a surfeit of ‘“teacher- 
ing.” They need something to eat, they need someone to 
listen to an outpouring of the happenings of the day. Merely 
to listen with sympathetic interest, without comment or 
criticism, may be the part of wisdom and the best way to 
secure and maintain confidence. 
Probably the children wii! contract mispronunciation, 
bad grammar, and possibly a mild form of bad language 
from school associates. We have heard mothers express 
alarm and horror, shocked surprise that the child, so 
carefully brought up, should embrace evil at the first op- 
portunity. They should know that this is not innate 
depravity —the children, so carefully brought up, are 
only attracted by the novelty of mispronunciation and 
perhaps bad words, and are copying it purely because it is 
unusual. 
Periods of Solitude. To provide for the child some time 
to be entirely by himself, alone in his own room, or reading, 
gardening, or working out-of-doors, is good for the restora- 
tion of nerve balance after the excitement and strain of 
large numbers in school. Something of the tranquillizing 
effect of the baby pen or kiddie koop in infancy will be 
produced by these brief periods of solitude. The child 
needs them, and should be trained to enjoy them. Some 
authorities recommend them from the time the child is 
three years old — others, as soon as he begins to associate 
with large numbers of other children, whether in Nursery 
School or Kindergarten — and others still say that they 
should be provided as soon as the afternoon nap is given
-P-A-G-E-214
  199 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
up. All are in agreement as to their necessity and whole- 
someness. 
Evening Hour of Song. During the first years of school 
is a good time to institute an evening hour of song, if this 
is not already one of the family institutions. Let children 
and parents sing together in the evening after supper, or 
better — shortly before the small people’s bedtime. Sing- 
ing in unison is better than even the enjoyment of an open 
fire for soothing the disordered nerves of the second denti- 
tion period, for bringing forgetfulness of unpleasant hap- 
penings at school, forgetfulness also of the business. or 
housekeeping cares of the grown-up. So harmonizing is 
singing in unison that one of our New England ministers 
(Dr. Samuel Crothers) says that if only it were practiced 
more frequently, and if larger numbers of persons would 
assemble themselves for the purpose, this good custom 
would put an end to war. Anyway, the evening sing in 
the home brings balm for all the little hurts of the school 
day — and many things happen in school to fret the heart 
of a child —it makes a bond of union between grown-ups 
and children, it brings peace to the soul and joy to the heart, 
and the pleasant smoothing-out of nerves which is a pre- 
cursor of refreshing sleep. 
Certain Traits of This Age 
After the let-down period which marks the phase of second 
dentition there will come, beginning at about nine years old, 
sometimes earlier, a season of renewed health and increased 
vigor, bringing with it a surplus of energy to be used in 
exercise and play. From seven years old to eleven is called 
by Mrs. Cabot the “Angular Age,” and in practically the 
same period Mr. Lee’s “Big Injun” is lived out. In this 
book, which makes no attempt to classify children accord- 
ing to the development of special traits, but is based on the 
school periods, it is enough to state that some time from 
six to ten the parent and teacher may expect an eruption 
of bumps and sharp protruding angles, difficult to fit into 
prearranged schemes; and many of these angularities will 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
    FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 191 
take the form of the “Injun” traits of cruelty, boastfulness 
and self-assertion, pugnacity, predaciousness, lawlessness, 
love of mischief-making, loud noise and horn-blowing — 
and a preference for squeaky boots. 
Pugnacity. Though small children, especially boys, will 
punch, pummel, and pillow-fight, will play at soldiers and 
battle, and grapple together like young puppies, there will 
be nothing real about it until the time when strong self- 
assertion comes as accompaniment of the growing ego. 
Now, little girls will viciously scratch and slap, while boys 
will fight in real earnest and come home in a condition 
shocking to their mothers. “Actual fighting among chil- 
dren (or adults either) is not agreeable to witness,” says 
Mr. Joseph Lee. ‘But the instinct is so deep in the race, 
and carries with it such a valuable element of character, 
that it ought to be guided and encouraged, not repressed.’’ 
A boy should be taught to box, to do his fighting according 
to rules and to fight fair, to take a beating good-naturedly 
and never to hit the one that is down; also, according to 
the “Tom Brown” ideal, ‘never to bully a little boy or 
turn his back on a big one.”’ So will this tendency become 
a means of character building. Again to quote Mr. Lee: 
“Fighting is protean in its manifestations. . . . Men fight 
disease, ill-fortune, failure, their own temptations, as well 
as enemies of flesh and blood....It is largely the 
fighting spirit that has supported the martyr and the mis- 
sionary.” Ability to control and direct this instinct, to 
master it rather than be mastered by it, should be set 
before the child as an ideal. 
Acquisitiveness. The growing ego finds high satisfaction 
in personal possession. Children will now surreptitiously 
take to bed with them, especially if secure from observation, 
any newly acquired treasure, from a suit of clothes to a 
guinea pig — and for much the same reason that they did 
so when younger — to ensure subconsciousness of owner- 
ship while consciousness is lost. 
This is the best time to give the child a room of his very 
own and to show respect for his rights in it. If a room is
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  192 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
not available, part of one may be screened off, or he may be 
given a closet or cupboard, a bureau or a drawer, unless he 
already has them. 
After eight years old, sometimes before it, is the time when 
there are intense longings for ownership of desired objects 
— longings that if now gratified will give more solid pleasure 
than ever, perhaps, may be experienced from a like cause 
in years to come. Somebody says that when a boy wants 
a thing he hungers for it with all his body and mind — 
he becomes one ache of desire. Also, delicate, sensitive 
small girls often grow peaked and thin through futile long- 
ing for some coveted possession. Especially after illness, a 
long desired gift often brings healing and recuperation 
through joy. Before a Spartan mother denies any legiti- 
mate longing in an effort to inculcate self-denial or self- 
mastery, she ought to know that perhaps never again may she 
be able to bestow so much happiness, a happiness which will be 
perennial, for it will live in memory and sweeten after life. 
Where the bestowal of the desired object is not advisable 
the child should be told the reasons, and the parent can do 
much to soften the blow by expressing sympathy and regret 
—also, at this age of self-aggrandizement, by encourage- 
ment to be big and brave under disappointment. 
A desire to make collections is another form of the ac- 
quisitiveness of these years. This often begins at five or six 
and is especially strong about the age of ten. According 
to an investigation made some years ago in Boston, by Dr. 
Stanley Hall, only nineteen boys in two hundred and twenty 
nine — or less than one in every ten — had no collection. 
All sorts of things are collected; buttons, badges, butterflies, 
cigar wrappers, marbles, foreign stamps and coins and 
picture post cards, or anything else in the line of portable 
property. It is an excellent diversion and is often educative 
beyond any course offered in the school curriculum. One 
of the finest collections of moths and butterflies in the 
United States was begun by its owner before the age of 
ten. It is now an object of pilgrimage for biologists inter- 
ested in the lepidoptera. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
      FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 193 
The Predacious Instinct. The combination of acquisitive- 
ness with desire for daring exploit, with the spirit of mischief, 
with a general vagueness regarding the ethics of private 
ownership — especially of apples — often results in raids 
on orchards and other unlawful forms of pillage. Such 
things should be stopped, should be shown up as dis- 
honorable and “mean.” Boys and girls have an odd code 
of honor which permits the appropriation of certain goods, 
notably of “eats,” under the name of “swiping,” and for- 
bids the taking of money, for this would be “stealing.” 
In their code, too, certain persons are legitimate objects 
of “pinching,” and parents, brothers and sisters, school 
and college mates, friends, and grandmothers may be 
despoiled, while outsiders and strangers may not. 
Notwithstanding Mr. Lee’s charge to us not to “imagine 
that we are going to eliminate the predatory instinct. It 
is an integral part of the eternal boy and cannot be removed 
without causing the death of the patient” (“Play in Edu- 
cation,’ Ch. XXVIII), we are yet inclined to believe that 
toleration is now carried too far, and that common, ordinary 
stealing of books, bags, balls, clothing, or pocketknives is 
not made innocent by calling it “swiping.” Even Mr. 
Lee, who believes that the orchards and apple-barrels of 
grandmothers are providentially provided to satisfy the 
instincts of predation, suggests that “ playground feats, and 
opportunity to satisfy his thirst for daring exploit,’’ should 
be provided for the working off of superfluous energy other- 
wise sure to be spent in depredations on other than grand- 
mothers. Mrs. Cabot, recognizing that boys and girls at 
this age are in a chronic state of hunger for goodies, and 
will make pantry raids, — for stolen goods are the sweetest 
— tells of a mother who used to hide away pieces of stale 
cake, “for the boys to steal.” (“Seven Ages of Childhood”). 
More serious unlawful appropriation is often the result 
of desire denied. It is a good thing for the parent to win 
the child’s confidence with regard to such desires, even 
when impossible of fulfilment, so that they may get worked 
off through free expression of them. (See pages 148, 192.)

Guard against temptation to real pilfering by appeal to sense 
of honor and fair play and being straight and square in all 
dealings, thus making self-approval win out against ac- 
quisitiveness. 
Egoism, Self-Assertion. From six to ten, and longer, is 
a period when self-assertion waxes strong and the pre- 
dominant virtue of this age is anything but modesty. Every 
normal child is more or less of a Pau-Puk-Keewis, in boast- 
fulness and pride. He loves to show off, to domineer, to 
play the tyrant. The great incentive to conduct is recog- 
nition, reward or praise, or honorary distinction of some 
kind. It is the age to give and take a dare; the age when 
a child will study, not so much for love of the subject, as 
to win acclaim in mastering it. He will enjoy the distinc- 
tion of being the best student in his class, or — often quite 
as much — of being the sauciest to the teacher. Gold stars 
and Honor Rolls are now used effectively in school and 
Sunday School—on the other hand, such acknowledge- 
ment from his elders may be eclipsed by desire to win from 
his fellows the reputation of using the most swear words. 
It is of high importance that the child shall be guarded 
from the danger of approval from his fellows for the wrong 
he does for the sake of distinction, for impudence, or swear- 
ing, or “swiping,” for cruelty, or deceit. 
During this age of competition and rivalry, when to win 
out in something to the discomfiture of another is one of 
the unholy springs of conduct, there will be times when a 
parent or teacher — nerve-worn by the vagaries of the age, 
and at wits’ end to persuade to performance of duty — may 
be tempted to use the irresistible bait of rivalry, of doing 
better than so-and-so, or ‘‘downing”’ the other fellow through 
excelling him. Such methods are unwholesome and should 
be avoided. The instinct to compete and rival should 
find expression in the competitive games (see page 202), 
and there is normally no need to fear its starvation. In 
line with this, the educators who put character-training 
first, last, and all the time, tell us it is not good to offer a 
single prize or reward in the school class, but rather to have 
    
-P-A-G-E-219
     FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 195 
many, and—like gold stars — of such a kind that equal 
honor is awarded to all who attain a given standard. 
The desire to occupy center stage and to feel important 
may be wholesomely fostered by giving the child certain 
responsibilities, such as the care of a grassplot or garden 
bed, or of a small brother or sister (if it be safe to take this 
risk), or of seeing that lights are out and the house locked 
at a certain hour, or of looking after the daily deliveries of 
milk, or ice, or vegetables, and seeing they are put in the 
right place — or any other service to the family of a rather 
spectacular nature, especially one which involves some dis- 
play of authority and “bossing” and may consequently be 
pridefully discharged. 
Pride in being reliable, in being dependable and trust- 
worthy, is an excellent thing to cultivate. We are told that 
the father of President Coolidge used to boast that when 
he gave the young Calvin a job to perform he never needed 
to go after him to see that it was done — for he knew it 
would be all right. To let a boy know that you expect 
good things of him is one of the best ways to get your ex- 
pectations fulfilled. Dr. Arnold of Rugby made boys 
truthful and honorable by assuming they were so and 
accepting their words unquestioningly. 
Mischievousness. This is the age when children love to 
play practical jokes, to ring door-bells and run away; to 
stretch strings across passageways with intent to trip up 
the next passer; to tie tin cans to dogs’ tails; to hide the 
grandfather’s spectacles or the mother’s keys; to stand 
behind the door in a dark room and pounce out on the 
nervous aunt or sister. These and countless other dis- 
agreeable acts are done, not so much through original sin 
as because the boy or girl thinks they are “fun.” It is 
consoling to learn they are forms of the perverted sense of 
humor that is natural at this age, but the pranks are often 
hard for the mother to live through. The best she may do 
is to suggest better and more acceptable forms of practical 
jokes, of pleasant instead of unpleasant surprises, of the 
fun to be found in impersonation, etc.   
  
-P-A-G-E-220
   
    196 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND. GIRLS 
One child we knew used to assume a disguise and come 
to his physician father to tell about a headache or stomach- 
ache. Another was fond of calling his mother on the tele- 
phone and announcing he was some or any personage in 
the public eye, from the President to the Chief of Police. 
Sometimes he would play he was his own teacher and con- 
gratulate his mother on the remarkable talents and virtues 
of her son. While even this more acceptable form of joke 
may pall on the grown-up, it is nevertheless more really 
humor, it makes for family fun and hurts nobody, it is 
wholesomer than enjoying the inconvenience of the grand- 
father who cannot find his glasses, or the frenzy of the dog 
with a can tied to its tail. 
The virtue of thoughtfulness for others is at this time 
likely to be in the discard. The overflowing energy of a 
vigorous boy or girl has to be worked off and the means 
nearest to hand will be used. During house-cleaning time, 
when the stair carpets were removed, a boy of eleven was 
known to pound up and down fifteen consecutive times, 
through joy in making a noise, regardless of a guest who was 
lying down with a headache. This was not malicious 
mischief, it was unthinking play. 
Cruelty. A characteristic streak of cruelty to be expected 
from the “Injun”’ is shown in a mild form by teasing, in 
a more serious, by carrying teasing to the point of torture 
—as a big boy sometimes will with a little boy. The dis- 
proportionate self-consciousness of an age when the ego 
is the biggest thing in the world will often cause ugly acts 
of cruelty towards animals, insects, and younger children. 
To remove the cause of the temptation, to divert from it, 
or to put down such acts with high-handed authority are 
suggested remedies for different cases. 
Talebearing. Sometimes at this age, sometimes before, 
children will tell tales on one another—a thing to be 
firmly discouraged. A prideful sense of honor should be 
established, and the child should know that it is a fine and 
brave thing to tell on one’s self, but mean and cowardly 
to tell on another. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
       FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 197 
Many mothers, finding a vigorous growth of faults and 
pindling-out of virtues at this age, place the blame on the 
school, on bad companionship, poor discipline, etc.; while 
the school is no more to be blamed than the home — it 
is a phase every child may be expected to go through and 
is as natural as drooling or second dentition. Many chil- 
dren have a light attack of what may be called the “Big 
Injun” disease, or the eruption of “angularity,” but their 
symptoms may be looked for in some form and in both 
sexes, and in this chapter we have purposely set them forth 
at their worst. 
A sorely-tried mother may take consolation from remem- 
bering that in the growth of every tadpole before he becomes 
a proper frog there are things developed which later are 
sloughed off. She should know that if there is now too 
much enforced repression of various and sundry things 
disagreeable — unless such inhibition is a voluntary exer- 
cise of the child’s will, — the traits of this age are likely 
to re-assert themselves later and then persist instead of 
being transitory. Further, for her greater comfort, she may 
remind herself that the best all-round, well-balanced life 
comes through having lived at its highest fulness each 
stage of childhood. Many times it is found that bad chil- 
dren and brainy, who assert their own rich and varied per- 
sonality —superior to the bribe of parents’ approval 
—learn quicker to meet life’s problems, and later, /hav- 
ing worked the badness out of their systems, display 
the self-knowledge and self-mastery which make for 
leadership. 
And yet—oh, hard is the way of the parent! — the 
injunction, now so freely given, to let the child live out its 
personality unthwartedly, has to be taken with a grain of 
salt, with an antidote of common sense. Freedom, as much 
as possible, should be given, but within limits. How much 
freedom, how much limitation, will be the parents’ prob- 
lem, and the problem will not be the same for any two 
children.    
-P-A-G-E-222
   
  198 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Recreation, Playthings, and Games 
It is a pity if this age has to be lived anywhere except in 
the country, for the city street, the housetop, back yard, 
or even the park are poor substitutes for the nature life so 
good for soul and body. Frequent trips to the country, 
the seashore, mountains and woods, should be provided, 
and, if possible, at all seasons, so that boys and girls alike 
may climb trees, take high jumps, wade, dive, swim, skate, 
coast and toboggan, make loud noises and blow horns. 
If they are let alone they will probably learn from one 
another. 
Swimming. Boys and girls should learn to swim before 
the eighth year is completed. They often learn before, 
but swimming comes very easy at the age of eight and 
they will quickly become expert in water sports. Every 
child ought to want to know how to swim and should be 
able to, even if there is no place but a city gymnasium pool 
where he may learn and practice. 
Boxing and Wrestling, Skating, and perhaps early lessons 
in fencing and archery may be given from nine on. These 
will be play, yet serious enough to gratify the appetite for 
reality now present. 
Riding. Country boys and girls should be able to ride 
horseback before ten years old; and city children should 
learn during summer vacations in the country. The more of 
these out-door sports the child learns and loves the better 
for health, nerves, and general well-being, both now and 
later. (See page 253.) 
Throwing at a Mark. Girls as well as boys should be 
taught to throw at a mark, to save them when grown-up 
from male contempt of ‘the woman’s attempt to throw.” 
We hear and read much about the physiological differences 
that inhibit a good stone-throw on the part of a woman, 
but up to ten years old there is but slight physiological 
difference between boys and girls, and boys are accurate 
throwers long before this. So are girls we know, who, 
taught by their brothers, can, at eight years old, throw a 
    
-P-A-G-E-223
  
  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 199 
stone at a mark with the long shoulder sweep and wrist 
jerk of the boy—or send a flat pebble, with the boy’s 
underhand arm sweep, to skim along the surface of a pond 
with alternate dips to the water and flights above it before 
sinking. 
Dancing. Girls especially need to learn to dance at six, 
for the sake of acquiring grace of movement and posture. 
This joyous activity now makes for freedom and unself- 
consciousness, for children of six are inclined to be more 
interested in what they are doing than in what onlookers 
are thinking of them, and will consequently learn to dance 
more easily than a few years hence, when the obsession 
of self-consciousness may be a very torture. Also, good 
teachers of dancing will train their pupils to hold the body 
properly — to “stand tall,” to “sit tall,” to breathe easily 
and naturally. 
Dramatics. The age of imagination — when real and un- 
real are mixed in the child’s mind, when dreams are not to 
be distinguished from facts, and when we sometimes think 
the child actually believes himself to be what he imperson- 
ates —is said to linger longer with children brought up 
in homes of greater culture and refinement, where the less 
mundane values of life are esteemed. Enjoyment of con- 
scious dramatization for drama’s sake ‘succeeds it, and 
there is sometimes a combination of make-believe and 
reality that gives intense pleasure. Thus, a boy who used 
to take the farm horses to water, played he was Isumbras 
at the ford —and thus, two boys when asked to move 
some grain to the loft over the barn, immediately (at enor- 
mous trouble to themselves) rigged up a tackle and wind- 
lass to convey freight from the dock into a steamer. 
Children in the primary grades at school love to dramatize, 
to dress up and act out poems and stories, to play a part, 
to read and recite in character. 
Careful observers of children have noticed that while 
little girls like the costuming to be as complete as possible 
small boys are satisfied with a bare symbol. A quill feather 
stuck upright in his cap makes the boy an Indian; a bit of 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    200 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
silvered paper pinned on his breast and he is a policeman. 
It is also observed that a boy likes to have something in 
his hand to assist his impersonations, and this essential 
something is endowed by imagination with dramatic fitness. 
Thus, the writer has herself seen a kitchen spoon become on 
different occasions a tomahawk, a club, a sword, a rifle, and 
the scepter of King Ahasuerus. 
Neither, so students of child life say, does the lack of 
other theatrical properties bother the boy so much as it 
does the girl. In charades played by children for a rainy 
day’s amusement an observer noted the refusal of a girl 
to pose as Justice because there were no scales to hold, 
and another could not possibly be Elizabeth Fry through 
lack of a Quaker dress, while a boy without the smallest 
attempt at costuming, placed a coal scuttle on the table 
and prostrated himself before it, while the spectators guessed 
and guessed in vain. It was the Israelites worshipping the 
Golden Calf. 
Yet the real thing is the thing craved, and during these 
years the toy boats, which the boy at first sails by the hour, 
will shortly be scorned and he will aspire to row a dory, 
fish from a punt, or paddle a canoe. At about ten years 
the building blocks, too, will be discarded, and boys and 
girls will delight in the use of real bricks, stone, and mortar. 
Children now love to build fences, to excavate caves, to 
dig for hidden treasure and to make caches, and boys in 
particular will spend more than day laborers’ hours in con- 
structing such work as a dam — getting hot and wet, sun- 
burned, muddy, and fatigued, during the process, but finally 
achieving the triumph of a contest with nature and an over- 
coming, in the completion of a dam that will dam. Such 
play trains for future endurance, perseverance, stick-to- 
it-iveness. 
Playroom. As in former periods, a playroom for wet days 
is an excellent provision. Children can make noise here 
without disturbing their elders, and their sense of the 
rights and responsibilities of joint ownership in a room for 
all should be developed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
       FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 201 
Playthings. For the girl nothing is better than the doll, 
which during this entire period is likely to be a constant 
plaything. Now, instead of loving the doll in proportion 
to the outlay of imagination needed in creating one from 
a stick or a pillow, the little girl wants pretty ones. Real 
hair is usually craved about seven years old, and it should 
be put on in a fashion easily to re-arrange. A child’s doll 
should not be too large or heavy — not taller than 12 to 
15 inches. To save from disappointment it is well to take 
the child to choose her doll and let her do this without 
prompting or suggestion. We are told that the doll-curve 
is at its height at nine years old, and love for a doll may 
persist for a longer or shorter time after this, with different 
children and under different circumstances. 
For the boy during these years there is no one plaything 
so educative as is the doll for the girl, and there is no substi- 
tute for the doll until the boy is old enough for live pets. 
(See page 235.) 
At seven years, or soon after, the boy is able to play 
marbles. His finger muscles and nerves and brain now make 
him competent for the handcraft of this game. A good 
deal of skill is required for some of the marble games, it 
is good for boys to play them, and we learn with regret 
from the supervisors of playgrounds that only the common 
and rather degenerate forms of marble play are made use 
of at present. 
Jackstones are at this time for girls what marbles are 
for boys, and a good deal of expertness is developed in using 
them. 
Boys will now whip tops and spin tops and there is no 
reason why girls should not do the same. Lead soldiers 
may be played with up to nine or ten, usually not later. 
Both girls and boys will fly kites, use velocipedes, roller 
skates, and play with balls. They will both, at least during 
the early part of this period, play at house- and store-keep- 
ing, and still enjoy the sand pile. 
The swing, the skipping rope, the seesaw, the toboggan 
slide, and trolley slide; ninepins and tenpins; drums    
-P-A-G-E-226
   
  202 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
and trumpets; sleds and express wagons; bean bags, soap 
bubble stuff, etc., are among the essentials to right living 
at this age. 
Now that the desire to construct and make things is 
somewhat displacing the desire to imagine things, children 
will gladly use colored crayons and paints, raffia and rattan, 
stencils, modelling clay, gardening implements and carpenter 
tools. To melt and mold lead is a great diversion; so is 
rug weaving, paper cutting, knitting, and cord work, such 
as hammock making. Girls enjoy paper doll construction 
and sewing on dolls’ clothing; boys should learn to sew on 
bean bags and marble bags, and both girls and boys love 
to learn camp cooking. At nine years old many little girls 
are expert cooks and love to do light cleaning and to learn 
to keep house tidily. 
Games. The love of a game (which in its true sense is 
a contest according to rules) begins at six or seven years 
old and should normally continue through life. From six 
on the observer will be interested in noting the desire for 
self-assertion in games of emulation. There is no team- 
work yet, to speak of, the individual wants to be thrown 
into high relief. The child will run, we are told, not for the 
sake of “getting there,” but to outdistance a competitor; 
he will aim at a mark, not so much to hit it as to hit nearer 
to it than another thrower. Hence, at this time the in- 
dividualistic and competitive games are in order, and in 
these there is a fine opportunity for training in playing 
fair. The following are suggested: 
Games of Chase and Capture. ‘Hill Dill,” a running and 
tag game, good to play in wide spaces out of doors; ‘‘Three 
Deep,” a standard favorite for all ages, is great fun and is 
mentally stimulating and quickening. Also “Bear in the 
Pit,” “I Spy I,” “ Yards Off” and many other forms of tag. 
Throwing and other Competitive Games. These include 
many forms of bean bag games, also throwing at a target — 
made by three boxes one inside the other, or three concentric 
circles chalked on the floor or on grass, or drawn on sand. 
“Puss in the Corner” furnishes exercise and a contest in

agility. So do many games of changing seats; and when 
these, like “Going to Jerusalem,” are played to the ac- 
companiment of music they are still more delightful. “Call 
Ball” is a good competitive game for these years. 
Games Featuring Individual Skill. One of the best of 
these is “Follow Your Leader,” which is a practical form 
of giving a “dare.” It is a fine way for a bold and adven- 
turous spirit to show off and will be welcomed by such 
spirits when other games pall. Mr. William Wells Newell 
(in ‘Games and Songs of American Children”) tells us that 
drivers of trucks and wagons in the’ Southern states, will 
considerately stop while the “leader” runs under the horse’s 
legs and wait for the others to follow. He also relates 
how one of his friends followed his leader over the roofs 
of houses in Boston. 
Rope jumping or skipping also brings the individual into 
prominence. 
The ‘‘Tug-of-War’’ and ‘“‘Thread-the-Needle” games are 
much enjoyed at eight years old. At this age, too, girls have 
enough muscular codrdination to play “ Hop Scotch,” a game 
which, like skipping rope, exercises the larger muscles and 
calls for use of the whole body. Such games, because of the 
game interest, are a better all-round form of exercise than 
formal gymnasium work. (See page 237-8.) 
Children from eight to ten delight in riddles and they 
should be given the traditional ones, such as “As I was going 
to St. Ives”; ‘Humpty Dumpty”; “ Eliza, Elizabeth, Betty 
and Bess”; “Round as an Apple,” the ‘‘Sphinx”’ riddle, and 
all the other good ones. 
Guessing games, too, make for nimble wits, and some of 
these, like ‘Guess Who” and “Blind Man’s Buff” combine 
exercise with guessing. 
Observation games, and others to test the senses of taste, 
touch, and smell, are well adapted to the rivalry and 
individualism of the age, while providing excellent sense 
training. 
From six years on the counting-out games are attractive, 
and the old, popular forms, like “Onery, twoery,’” and
-P-A-G-E-230
  204 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
“Eena, Meena, Mina, Mo” are constantly played by 
generation after generation of children. 
Up to ten, girls particularly and sometimes boys, still 
love the cirele games. Some of these are very ancient. 
“Here we go round the mulberry bush,” also “Oats, peas, 
and beans,” and “Looby-loo”’ are said to have formed part 
of the ancient rites of primitive people. The immortal 
“Muffin Man” and “Farmer in the Dell,” with circle, 
singing, and rhythmic motion — the delightful “Did you 
ever see a lassie?” (or ‘“‘laddie”) where mimicry is added 
— and others like these are natural and attractive now. 
“Frog in the Middle,” and “Lame Fox and Chickens,” 
etc., are good for timid children, who may take a neutral 
part at first until they are bold enough to be “It.” 
The semi-dramatic games with rhythmic chant, like 
“Here are three kings, three by three 
Coming to court you, fayre lay-die,” 
and the prettier, if less democratic 
“Here comes a duke a-roving, 
A-roving, a-roving,” 
or the tragic 
“We’ve come to see Miss Jennia Jones,” 
(in England the lady is Jenny-jo) are played according to 
their mood by all little girls under the sun of English- 
speaking countries. 
Mention has to be made of the well-known “London 
bridge is broken down.” (Boston children know it as 
Charlestown bridge.) This is played in some form in every 
European country, sometimes as tug of war, sometimes as 
a march, sometimes — in all its length and unabridged — 
it is chanted for pure pleasure in its repetitions and refrains. 
This, too, comes to us from the childhood of the race, and 
primitive rites. 
“FWunt the Slipper,” “Hide the Thimble,” “Drop the 
Handkerchief,” call for physical nimbleness and are mentally

stimulating. ‘Do this, do that,” and “Simon Says” (some- 
times known as “‘I say, ‘Stoop’’’), call for quick observation 
and mimicry, and Bancroft (‘Games and Plays’’) says the 
last is quickly refreshing to tired minds. 
Nine years old is the age for games of forfeits, and these 
will, if well planned, be a source of high pleasure. Timid 
and shy children, too, will learn self-forgetfulness in doing 
the ‘“‘stunts” called for by a forfeit, as they see them done 
by others. 
Nores on GAMES AND Piays 
We have given extra space to the games, etc., of this period, since 
the child is now entering naturally into the game age; and the game 
offers wholesome opportunity for rubbing off the “angularities” and 
working off the energies of the “Big Injun.” Plenty of play at this age 
is necessary and highly beneficial. 
Other games may be preferred by parents and teachers, to those 
mentioned, which have been cited chiefly as examples. They have also 
been chosen mostly from the games of ancient origin which have sub- 
sisted through all ages down to the present, thus demonstrating their 
value to children of all times. 
Mr. Lee (“‘ Education Through Plays and Games”’) thinks children are 
apt to be overinfluenced by their big brothers in aspiring to games be- 
yond them at this age, like baseball and football, and abandoning those 
most natural for them now, like ‘‘ Hill Dill,” “Three Deep,” and others. 
But we find that children will play with delight the right games for 
their age if properly directed, and especially if a grown person introduces 
them and frequently joins in them. 
Very great care has to be used in guarding children at the “Hight- 
year-old”’ period (see page 179) from too much running, too much skip- 
ping rope, and too-fatiguing activity. This is the time to look out for 
signs of over tire, and to divert interest to puzzles and quiet games 
and occupations. 
All that is possible of play and games out-of-doors should at this 
time be provided for the child to make up for the hours of confinement 
in school.   Books and Pictures From Siz to Ten 
Booxs anp READING 
Let us begin with the following quotations: 
“Literature helps to form taste; it enriches the vocabulary; 
grammar and spelling are incidentally taught (clinched in the

child’s mind); it brings perennial joy into life. It takes the city 
child into the country and the country child into the city.” 
“Literature in the Elementary School” 
Porter Lanpor MacCuinrock 
“Nothing is better for a boy who has to make his way in the 
world than to learn to take delight in poetry.” 
JoHN DRINKWATER, in a recent address. 
It depends largely on the school at this age, but more on 
the home and the parents, whether the foundations of future 
joy in reading shall be laid. If training in this line is neg- 
lected the future adult will go poorer all his days. 
At eight years old every child ought to be able to read 
for himself with enjoyment, and should be trained to find 
enjoyment in reading. Up to eight most children will 
have to be read to or have stories told them. 
Our lists of books for suggested reading during this and 
other periods are no more made from the standpoint of the 
teaching of literature than are our lists of pictures made 
from that of the teaching of art. Pictures and books are 
listed for the pleasure they bring, the inspiration, the 
uncritical interest of the child. 
The lists are also flexible in their adaptation to age. 
Until the children are eight the books suggested may be 
read aloud to them. 
Story-Books. ‘The Overall Boys” and ‘The Sunbonnet 
Babies” (Grover) are very popular. ‘‘The Lonesomest 
Doll” (Abbie Farwell Brown) must not be missed by a little 
girl at the doll age. ‘‘When Molly Was Six” (Eliza Orne 
White) may be read to the six-year-old, and will be read 
with pleasure by the eight-year-old. “The Japanese Twins” 
and “The Dutch Twins” (Lucy Fitch Perkins) surely, and 
maybe all the other ‘‘twins” by the same author — infor- 
mational, humorous, charming as they are, and with small 
touches of pathos — are stories for all children from six to 
sixty; and the repetition of twins and twins, and yet more 
twins, all alike and with different stories, is exactly suited 
to the tastes of children under ten. ‘The Little Lame

  FROM SIXTH TO THE TENTH BIRTHDAY 207 
Prince” (Dinah Mulock Craik) is lovely; and ‘‘The Story 
of Doctor Dolittle” (Hugh Lofting), a book of enjoyable 
nonsense that is a classic, must close this list. 
Myth, Fairy and Folk Tale, and Fables. ‘‘ Myths For Little 
Children” (Cox); and “Tanglewood Tales” (Hawthorne), 
together with ‘The Heroes” (Kingsley), for the sake of 
contrast in treatment, are recommended. ‘‘The Book of 
Elves and Fairies’ (Frances J. Olcott); “The Golden 
Goose” (Eva M.Tappan); “Alice in Wonderland”’ (Carroll); 
any good book of selections from Aisop; “Fairy Stories and 
Fables” (James Baldwin); besides those by Hans Ander- 
sen, Grimm, and others. 
Nature Stories and Books. ‘Little Folks in Fur and 
Feathers” (Olive T. Miller), easy-to-read true stories of 
small animals; ‘‘Old Mother West Wind” (Thornton W. 
Burgess); “Four-Footed Friends” (A. H. Smith); “Story 
of a Donkey” (de Segur); also “Beautiful Joe” (Saunders), 
a wholesome story for children; ‘The Prince and His Ants” 
(Luigi Bertelli); the Burgess bird and animal books; and 
“God’s Troubadour” (Sophie Jewett), which tells very 
charmingly the story of a man who was the friend of all 
birds and beasts and friendless humans. 
History, Stories from. ‘Stories of Pioneer Life” (Florence 
Bass) is full of interesting illustrations, and (with some 
exceptions) of well-written tales of pioneer life in America. 
“Pilgrim Stories” (Pumphrey) ; ‘Stories of Great Americans 
for Little Americans” (Edward Eggleston); “History 
Stories of Other Lands” (A. G. Terry); “Hero Stories from 
American History” (A. F. Blaisdell and F. K. Ball), are 
all recommended; and ‘‘Why We Celebrate Our Holidays” 
(Mary Isabel Curtis) is delightful to read and historically 
enlightening. 
Boys now love stories of Old Testament heroes, and 
for the younger children in this period the “Bible Stories” 
by Frances J. Olcott, where Old Testament stories are told 
in Bible language, will be found very useful. After eight 
the child should make acquaintance with the Bible for 
himself.

    208 CARE AND TRAINING. OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Civics and Health. ‘The Boys and Girls of Wake-Up 
Town,” by J. Mace Andress, is a new book on practical 
civics — also hygiene — which is well recommended for boys 
and girls. 
Poetry. A child of six will naturally graduate from 
“Mother Goose” into “A Child’s Garden of Verses,”’ where 
the eternal child in Stevenson will be welcomed by chil- 
dren. Many of the poems will be beyond youngsters in 
the First and Second Grades, but many of them will be 
loved. (There is an edition of this book with colored 
plates which may well be purchased even if its cost seems 
to be too much.) 
Children like a good story in verse, and “Story Telling 
Ballads,” also “Story Telling Poems” (Frances Jenkins 
Olcott), are good compilations. It is interesting to note 
that like the small toddler, who, in essaying speech, could 
pronounce difficult words when he sang them (see page 78), 
similarly a small child will understand more than we think 
of the lyrical ballads, of ““The Ancient Mariner” and other 
poems musical in rhyme and rhythm. ‘No prose,” writes 
one of our authorities, “could tell a short story so vividly 
and briefly as Tennyson’s ‘The Revenge,” and “ Boadicea”’; 
Browning’s “The Boy and the Angel,” and ‘The Pied 
Piper’; Longfellow’s ‘The Wreck of the Hesperus”; and 
the old ballads of “John Gilpin” and “The Bailiff’s Daugh- 
ter” are loved by many children under ten, and may 
be read aloud to those who cannot yet read them with 
ease. 
At nine and ten children who are used to poetry will 
read for themselves the unabridged “Hiawatha.” They 
will read for themselves “The Lays of Ancient Rome,” 
and they will discover many poems they like in the complete 
works of the American and English poets of the nineteenth 
century if allowed access to them. 
A book of verses for this age compiled by Lucas is recom- 
mended; also Kenneth Grahame’s “Cambridge Book of 
Poetry for Children.” The following collections are ex- 
cellent: ‘The Child’s Own Book of Verse” (Skinner and
-P-A-G-E-235

Wickes), for children from six to eight; ‘The Treasury of 
Verse” (Edgar), for children over eight; ‘Fifty Christmas 
Hymns” (Hyett), is a particularly beautiful selection; and 
“The Golden Staircase”’ (Chisholm), has admirably chosen 
poems for this and following ages. 
Nortss. — The nonsense verses of Lear, Carolyn Wells and others, 
and the rhymes in ‘“‘Zodaic Town” (Nancy B. Turner) will appeal to the 
child’s sense of humor and fun — which is not at all like that of the 
adult. Children at this age are only beginning to appreciate humor — 
not all of them have gone so far as even to make this beginning — and 
its more subtile forms, like irony, are hardly understood by children 
under nine — unless they are of Scotch descent. 
The Volland Publishing Company’s selection of books is recom- 
mended for little children where the parent is not acquainted at first 
hand with new writers and publications. This firm makes a point that 
their books do not “cause fright, suggest fear, glorify mischief, ex- 
tenuate malice, or condone cruelty.” 
PICTURES 
Though children of six still delight most in colored pic- 
tures, they are now at an age to begin to enjoy good black- 
and-white, in engravings, half-tones, and photographs. 
They now like best the human-interest pictures that tell 
or suggest a story. Next liked are animal pictures and 
pictures of movement and activity; also pictures of fa- 
miliar flowers, trees and plants—which should preferably 
be colored. Pictures of famous buildings, from the log 
cabin of Lincoln to the Eddystone lighthouse, and odd and 
famous ones, such as the Pyramids, the’ Sphinx, about 
which interesting things can be related, will now interest 
children. 
At this time, too, often earlier, they delight to pick out 
details such as that in many of the Dutch pictures, and at 
least one teacher has found children turn away from colored 
pictures for the greater interest in the richly embroidered 
robes of some of Fra Angelico’s angels. 
Observers are agreed that children under ten care very 
little for landscape per se, unless as a background to human 
or animal activity.

THE BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO 
FOURTEEN 
Food and Diet 
Amount of Food Now Needed. By way of illustration, let 
us tell again the oft-told tale of the father and his twelve- 
year-old son who dined at a restaurant and were charged for 
three table d’hote dinners. The man, it was explained, had 
eaten one, and the boy had eaten two. The father found the 
argument unanswerable, and thereby showed his wisdom. 
In the matter of food, more than in any other line of 
human knowledge and endeavor, “a little learning is a dan- 
gerous thing.” The old academic standards for this age, of 
eight-tenths or nine-tenths the food of an adult, are unfortu- 
nately still found in otherwise excellent books on diet, 
though parents of growing children will find them eating 
two and three times as much as their elders, The appetite 
from now on through the completion of adolescence is 
enormous in its demands, and abundant nutrition means 
more vigor and endurance in years to come. Metabolism is 
very rapid, and Lusk, Dubois, and all our best present-day 
authorities agree that there is some mysterious need of the 
vital forces which calls for what may be termed super- 
nutrition. 
“Children from twelve to fourteen need more food than 
anyone else in the world,” says a physician instructor in the 
Harvard Medical School. He further quotes as one of the 
best arguments for the sanction to fill up with food these 
youngsters who are seemingly empty from throat to heel, 
an experience of one of the Relief Commissions in Belgium 
during the Great War. At that time certain groups of adults 
were given three meals a day, by an American agency, as 
follows: A breakfast of bread and cocoa, a dinner of nutri- 
211
-P-A-G-E-238
   
  212 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
tious meat stew with bread, vegetables, etc., and a supper of 
bread and cocoa or its equivalent. Children of twelve and 
over were, through kindness of heart, ranked as adults. In 
a short time there was a general improvement in the health 
of the real grown-ups, all of them gained in weight, in vigor 
and cheer — and this in spite of the war nerve-strain, the 
homelessness, the crowded conditions in housing. But the 
young people from twelve to fourteen or older showed no 
improvement and continued to demonstrate all the marks 
and signs of malnutrition until the authorities provided them 
with a fourth generous meal. 
As a result of numberless similar instances, the old stand- 
ards of diet for growing boys and girls have been forced to 
give way to those based on experience, and our youngsters 
are now given as much to eat as they wish, provided it is of 
a wholesome kind. 
Broad general rules for the daily meals follow: 
Breakfast. A breakfast based on the principles of dietetics 
begins with some dry, hard, starchy food that compels 
thorough mastication and insalivation. The reaction of the 
saliva is mildly alkaline, and this on reaching the stomach 
stimulates the secretion of the slightly acid gastric juice 
and prepares it for the digestion of the protein food that 
follows. This may be lightly cooked eggs, delicate fish, 
toasted bacon, or a lamb chop. Unstinted bread and butter 
with marmalade — the bread made from’ whole wheat or 
graham flour — followed by porridge or cereal in some form 
with milk and sugar; and the fruit the last thing, is the 
breakfast program for child or adult advised by one of our 
specialists in dietetics who is also a physician. 
Fruit at the end of the meal is now becoming a custom 
followed by persons of understanding. This, because though 
fruit is useful for its minerals, its organic acids, and its 
alkali-forming power in the body, and consequently is good 
at any time during the meal, yet if eaten last its important 
peristaltic action is more effectively exercised. 
Luncheon. Hot milk, or soup, should be part of every 
school luncheon, for hot fluids are refreshing and stimulat- 
    
-P-A-G-E-239
        BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 213 
ing to the child and are needed to quicken circulation when 
the morning has been spent at a desk. The remainder of the 
luncheon should be nutritious, and especially it should be 
easily digested. 
The story is told of a boarding-school for girls whose 
pupils constantly made poor records at their examinations, 
to the disappointment of parents and the disgrace of a fine 
school. A new principal looked into the matter and found 
that a good-natured matron, ignorant of consequences, 
served luncheons of fried ham and eggs through the days of 
stress, believing this hearty and nutritious diet to be as ap- 
propriate to hard work in the classroom as it (probably) is 
to hard labor on the farm — and also because it was par- 
ticularly well relished by the girls. When the luncheon 
menu was changed to a milk soup, a green salad, and a 
simple pudding, followed by half an hour out-of-doors, the 
girls passed their tests brilliantly. 
Nature sometimes refuses to supply energy at one and the 
same time for the workings of the brain and those of the 
stomach. She will choose to attend to only one of the two, 
and since she cares nothing about examinations and grades 
and a great deal about digestion and absorption, she will 
unscrupulously divert energy from the brain to the gastric 
region. 
Dinner. First, a small helping of clear soup to stimulate 
digestion. Then a helping of meat or its equivalent. Large 
strong boys will often eat quite fearfully large helpings of 
meat, and if these are balanced by equally enormous help- 
ings of fresh vegetables, in the proportion of from two to 
three times as much vegetables as meat by weight, the 
parent need feel no anxiety. Body building is now going on 
with great rapidity, and eggs, cheese and meat may be 
given more freely than ever before, so long as there is plenty 
of out-door exercise and of vegetables to balance them. 
(See page 214.) The vegetables may be: one of the starchy 
kind; a second that is contrasting in flavor, such as any of 
the roots, or the non-starchy succulent vegetables; and the 
third should be greens. Or a green salad may take the place
-P-A-G-E-240
   
  214 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
of a green, leafy vegetable. Fruit or a sweet pudding may 
be served for the sweet course, and milk, or buttermilk, 
kumiss or one of the fermented milks, or plain clabber from 
the dairy, may be the dinner beverage. 
Supper. If dinner is in the middle of the day, the 
supper may be of broth with bread or crackers, or porridge 
with milk or cream, or milk toast, followed by stewed or 
fresh fruit, or a milk pudding, or simple preserves and light 
cake. Bread and butter unstintedly, and the butter should 
be real butter — not a substitute. 
“Lunches Between Meals. Bread and butter or bread and 
milk may be given on demand, as in the preceding period. 
Fresh fruit alone, plenty of it, is excellent for an in-between 
luncheon. 
Balance of Acid- and Alkali-Forming Foods. A point 
which has not yet been mentioned in this book, because it 
has been taken care of by the general directions, is the need 
to neutralize acid-forming foods by alkali-formers. Now 
that young people need more meat and other proteins it is 
time for the information (important to adults as well as to 
children) that certain foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, whole 
grains, peas, beans and other legumes, nuts, and some of 
the fats — such as, unhappily, butter and cream — produce 
acid conditions in the body. All fresh vegetables, nearly all 
fruits (except prunes, plums, and cranberries), and milk, 
produce in the body that alkaline condition which so aids in 
resisting disease that some physicians say nothing very 
serious will be the matter with the person whose blood is 
healthfully alkaline. Note particularly that the acid of 
soured milk, the acid of lemons, oranges, and grape fruit, 
react in the body to form alkali. Note that this is why hot 
lemonade is good for a cold, the alkaline condition produced 
aiding the body to throw off the infection. 
Unhurried Meals. During these years, as before, plenty of 
time should be allowed for meals, and children should be re- 
quired to eat slowly and to masticate thoroughly. Dys- 
pepsia in later life is most frequently the result of bolting 
the food and forming habits of hurried eating. The 
    
-P-A-G-E-241
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 215 
parent should enlist, by any lawful means, the codperation 
of the boy or girl with regard to correct diet and correct 
mastication. The ideal of vigor and growth may be used as 
incentive to the boy; that of good skin and complexion, clear 
eyes and fine hair, is often potent with the girl. 
These should be incidentally touched upon and not over- 
stressed, lest the youngsters suspect that the parent acts 
from general good intentions rather than for specific results 
which more particularly appeal to them. 
Food Before Breakfast. Children’s brains are active at 
this age, they learn quickly, they are often studiously am- 
bitious and will get up early in the morning to “‘do” home 
study before breakfast. As during the last period, so now, 
a cup of warm milk, or a bowl of bread and milk, should be 
insisted on if a boy or girl is addicted to early rising, or if 
chores of any kind are done before breakfast. It is especially 
bad for the eyes to tax them while fasting. It is bad all 
round to begin to work the first thing in the morning when 
the stomach is empty. So long as twenty years ago this was 
recognized in dealing with soldiers, and a famous English 
general is quoted as having formally issued the following 
order: 
“Every Commanding Officer should see that his officers 
and men have something to eat and drink before they begin 
their work, no matter how early, e. g., a cup of hot coffee 
and a biscuit before the regular breakfast.” 
Dinner or Luncheon at Noon. Whether or not the heartiest 
meal of the day comes at mid-day, should now be determined 
chiefly by the nature of the school work during the afternoon. 
If this is laboratory work in science or manual training, if it is 
music or drawing, the dinner may be at noon. If there are 
recitation periods or classroom work a nutritious and easily 
digested luncheon is better at that hour for the reasons 
given on page 164-5. 
Regular Meals Not to be Omitted. As is usual with all 
young vertebrates in their bony, growing years, boys and 
girls of this age have little reserve force in their bodies in the 
form of fat, consequently even one meal cannot be lost
-P-A-G-E-242
216 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
without risk of physical or mental hurt. Here is one of the 
important points of difference between the child and the 
adult; that while most adults are benefited by a fast from 
a meal once in a while, or by a fast for an entire day, or by 
the use of fruit only, or lettuce and oranges, for a day every 
week, as an aid both to cleansing of the system and phys- 
iological rest to the alimentary tract, such fasting must be 
prohibited to the growing youth. An adult in normal con- 
dition has enough reserves in the tissues to carry the body 
without injury through several days of insufficient nutri- 
tion, but schoolboys and girls lack these stored-up reserves, 
and especially when “school keeps”? must regular meals be 
religiously eaten. Note that in times of famine or siege the 
children cannot endure restricted rations as well as their 
elders. 
Craving for Sweets. Someone has called this age a time of 
perfectly alarming energy. Sweet things, sugar and candies, 
which are quick-fuel foods and almost immediate energy 
producers, will naturally be craved, and this craving indi- 
cates an actual requirement of nature. Young people need 
more sugar than adults, for they expend more energy; but 
the sugar would be better given in natural form, as in sweet 
fruits, either fresh or dried; in sweet vegetables; in the form 
of honey, maple sugar, or simple candy such as peanut 
brittle, almond rock, pralines, homemade fudge, fruit 
caramel, etc. These, if well made, will be relished by chil- 
dren quite as much as French bonbons, they are much less 
costly and ever so much wholesomer. 
Note, too, that the ery for sweets, considered by our 
Puritan fathers as something to be denied — as weakening 
to character and dangerous to morals — is now found to 
proceed from a healthful instinct and all persons at active 
work are begged to indulge it. Soldiers while marching 
have a special ration of candy; and youths in training have 
shown superior endurance when permitted a certain amount 
of sweets at the training table. 
Fruit. Boys and girls love fruit and this taste is one to 
encourage. Fruit in season should be provided as liberally 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 217 
as the purse can afford. Apples, one of the wholesomest of 
fruits, may be bought in autumn at low rates by the barrel, 
and a barrel always kept on tap. Oranges by the box are 
also a good purchase. Again let us repeat that free fruit for 
the family is no more a luxury than is music in the home. It 
is a necessity and its liberal consumption will save its cost 
in doctor’s bills. 
Whole Grains. Unpearled barley, undegerminated corn- 
meal, unpolished rice, and all cereals made from the honest 
raw grain without anything stolen or abstracted from it 
are needed by young humans as much as they are needed by 
growing young colts, cattle, or chickens. 
Milk. At this time, as well as before and after, milk 
is indispensable to nutrition. All our scientists are agreed 
on this point and two of them— Dr. Graham Lusk and 
Dr. E. V. McCollum — state that no family of five per- 
sons should buy a pound of meat until after the purchase 
of three quarts of milk. Milk should be on tap at all times, 
free for the asking, without postponement until regular 
meal hours. 
Iron and Vitamines. Girls from twelve on need plenty of 
foods containing iron, such as yolk of eggs, spinach, and 
other greens; and both boys and girls should have abund- 
ance of foods rich in vitamine A, that is, of milk, cream, 
butter, eggs, and greens. As before, care should be taken 
that too much butter or cream, or too many eggs, are not 
used, unless there is plenty of fresh air and exercise to en- 
sure their assimilation, and plenty of alkali-forming foods to 
counteract the acid-formers. 
(For further discussion of vitamine-containing foods see 
page 93). 
Minerals in the Diet. Unless care is taken to include 
them, minerals are likely to be insufficiently provided in the 
ordinary diet, because of failure to include foods which yield 
them, or because of the use of highly. manufactured foods 
which have been deprived of them. The minerals most apt 
to be lacking are calcium, iron, and phosphorus. Lists of 
foods containing these follow.
-P-A-G-E-244
  218 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Calcium. Calcium is necessary to normal action of the 
heart muscle and has an important influence on the absorp- 
tion and diffusion of fluids in the body, besides giving aid 
to other functions of the system. It is said that the ordinary 
diet in this country is more deficient in calcium than in any 
other mineral. 
Foods Supplying Calcium 
Almonds 
Cauliflower 
Cheese, both hard and soft 
Chives 
Dried beans and other legumes 
Eggs 
Milk 
Molasses 
Watercress 
Milk is an excellent source of calcium, since a quart of milk con- 
tains more of this element than a quart of limewater. Meat is 
deficient in calcium; so is fish. 
Iron. Iron is needed for the red blood corpuscles; and is 
essential to oxidation in the body, and to bodily develop- 
ment in general. An extra and abundant supply of foods 
containing iron is of especially great importance to girls 
from now on. 
Foods Supplying Iron 
Dates 
Dandelions and other greens 
Dried beans and peas 
Eggs, especially egg yolks 
Figs

absorbed as in eggs and greens. Spinach is richer in iron than other

greens, but it is present in all greens. Iron is also present in the bran 
and germ of the whole grains. Milk is poor in iron and though the 
minute amount present is in a. good form milk must not be depended 
on to furnish enough iron for the requirements of the body. 
Phosphorus. Phosphorus enters into the composition of 
every part. of the body. It is needed for the bones, the 
glands, the nervous system, the muscles. It is needed for 
life, and it is needed for thought. 
Foods Supplying Phosphorus 
Almonds 
Apples 
Bananas 
Brown rice 
Cheese, hard 
Carrots and other root vegetables 
Dried peas and beans

Meat, lean

Oranges 
Peanuts 
Prunes 
Walnuts 
Whole wheat and wheat bran 
Notr.— The yolk of eggs is especially rich in phosphorus, also 
cheese, and phosphorus is present in a slight degree in many other 
foods. 
Well-Relished Food. We are told that assimilation of food 
is influenced more by appetite and relish for it than by any 
other factor. (Dr. Singer). At this age when good-tasting 
food is so highly esteemed, and when the appetite is intelli- 
gently critical, it is of very great importance that the food 
at the home table should be of a high deliciousness as a 
safeguard against the surreptitious satisfaction of appetite 
by forbidden dainties. The factor of contrast in menu 
planning and in the compounding of dishes is a means to 
this end, e. g., the combination of a sapid food with one 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    220 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
milder in flavor, like tomatoes or cheese with macaroni; 
cress or chives with lettuce; raisins or dates in a rice pud- 
ding; or a spoonful of jelly or preserves with milk junket. 
The development of flavor by dry heat and high tempera- 
ture, as in the baking of carrots, beets, parsnips, and many 
other vegetables, also tends to sapid-tasting meals without 
the use of extraneous condiments; and the food provider 
should know that the dish gravy from roast meat is usually 
more savory than a made sauce, while the browned outside 
of a broiled chop or steak, of broiled fish or oysters, has an 
unparalleled condimental value in stimulating digestion and 
absorption. 
Foods Forbidden at This Age. The list is practically the 
same as that on page 163. It includes fried food of all kinds; 
also pork, mackerel, eels, and all foods difficult of digestion 
because of infiltration with fat; pickles, mustard, cayenne, 
mayonnaise dressings, and deviled dishes, which are often 
falsely craved during school life, as a kind of excitement, 
and which, besides vitiating the appetite, are said to irritate 
the delicate mucous lining. Pastry, when very rich or in 
large amounts, is also forbidden, as are large helpings of 
mince pie or heavy fruit cake. And—if possible — keep 
waffles and pancakes on the forbidden list. 
Tea and coffee are not needed by children and are much 
too stimulating. Well made cocoa or cereal coffee should be 
substituted, since these and all hot beverages, like hot milk, 
lemonade, or soup, are sufficient stimulants to heart and 
circulation for boys and girls, at least until they have done 
growing. 
From ten years on itis highly probable that the diet of 
schoolboys and girls, who are now at an age that is im- 
patient of authority, cannot be closely supervised. Some 
children, who have been taught the most important points 
in dietetics, and who are desirous to coéperate with parents 
in observing the rules, may be put on their honor not to eat 
forbidden foods. It is, however, a good deal to expect of a 
youngster to isolate himself from his “crowd” by refusing 
the ‘“‘eats’’ of its predilection and setting up a lonely stand- 
   
-P-A-G-E-249
    BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 221 
ard of propriety. To extort from the child any form of 
pledge to abjure some foods and to adopt others may in- 
volve the danger of a moral overstrain. The best the parent 
may do is to see that the home table provides all the ele- 
ments needed at this age, that the food is as delicious as 
possible, and that unwholesome and indigestible substances 
are excluded. 
School and Study 
The last four grades of the elementary school are usually 
the so-called grammar grades, and home study will often 
be necessary. This makes things hard for the child, 
since parents now will often employ special teachers for 
subjects not included in the school program, and _ this 
will encroach too much on time for out-of-doors and free 
play. It is much to be hoped that home study will be 
abolished before long in all schools, as it is now in many of 
the best. 
One of our pedagogues states that while in earlier years 
the interest of children in any subject is the first thing to 
think of, now is the time to “emphasize the obverse proposi- 
tion... that children are apt to become interested in 
whatever they attend to.’’ These then, are the years for 
the old-fashioned discipline and even drudgery of formal 
schooling. Involuntary attention should be demanded, in 
the near certainty that once won, the subject will be studied 
for its own sake through the now awakening intellectual 
curiosity. 
Yet, since this change does not come immediately, 
and since the desire for praise—so potent in motive 
power during the preceding stage — or the sometimes 
stronger desire to excel a competitor, are both in force, a 
good deal of studying will be done through these less noble 
incentives. 
Also, during the years before a finer and better-balanced 
judgment has developed, boys and girls will be prone to 
excessive enthusiasms, resulting in over-close mental ap- 
plication. Parents and teachers should beware of such
-P-A-G-E-250
  222 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
transgressions from the wholesome mean. They often 
indicate nervous excitement and result in a reaction of dis- 
gust, as at.a surfeit, which may retard mental and physical 
development. 
For what is called the ‘alphabet of arithmetic,” the mul- 
tiplication tables, the mastery of addition, subtraction and 
division, of fractions, decimals, and denominate numbers, 
there is no better time than this, and without it future ad- 
vance in mathematics is hopeless. If the school does not 
look out for this mastery the parent should stir things up to 
the desired end. 
Verbal memory is good at least up to twelve, and this 
is a time to continue language studies and to memorize 
poetry, After fourteen, foreign languages are acquired with 
more difficulty and may not easily be spoken without an 
accent. 
Slang, we are told, is created by each successive genera- 
tion of adolescents, through seeking a vent for feelings too 
intense for expression in common speech. Inhibition here 
will do no harm, and we learn with pleasure that last New 
Year the Camp Fire Girls throughout our country, number- 
ing more than 160,000, resolved to give up slang. They 
also formulated a resolution to cultivate a pleasant speaking 
voice, that 
ei . voice ever gentle, sweet and low 
An excellent thing in woman.” 
Every girl should be encouraged to make her speaking voice 
one that is musical in tone and pleasant to the ear. 
Music should be learned, whether in school or home, but 
by “learning music” we do not mean merely having piano 
lessons, which, unless the boy or girl has a taste for the 
piano, are so often drudgery. A school orchestra is a 
pretty good thing and boys will take to it who would not 
stand for piano lessons. Music may be profitably studied 
in correlation with band practice if attractively presented 
in the form of “appreciation of music.’ A friend of ours 
knows of a school where both boys and girls have won a 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
    BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 223 
good all-round knowledge of musical history, biography, 
form, also a healthy critical ability, through short talks on 
music, illustrated by a gramophone. 
Singing should be learned, too, not only for the joy of it, 
the opening of a new door to self-expression, but also be- 
cause it is a healthful physical exercise. Breath control is 
taught, also use of the tongue, flexibility of the lips, etc., 
where to relax the muscles that control the voice, where 
to keep them firm, etc. Health is benefited through deep 
breathing and the maintenance of a good posture, also 
through the psychological reaction of pleasure in this art. 
William Byrd in 1588 said further that to learn to sing 
“Gs a singular good remedie for stuttering and stammer- 
ing speech.” 
“Jazz” music is one of the evils of the day, the taste for 
it should be discouraged, and the best preventive is the 
formation of good musical taste and judgment. Where the 
foundations of real taste are established, occasional excur- 
sions into jazz, for the sake of being ‘‘in it with the crowd,” 
need cause no serious alarm. 
Drawing, out-door sketching, and manual training are 
recreative studies at this age. For other counsels see pages 
255-6. 
Growth and Development from Ten to Fourteen Years 
Height and Weight. From twelve to fourteen, or earlier, 
boys and girls may be expected suddenly to begin to grow: 
the boy develops long legs, long arms, awkwardness, phys- 
iological ugliness; and if the girl has long hands and feet, 
and slender, bony legs without a suspicion of calf, it is a 
fairly good sign she is going to be a tall woman. 
One of the old beliefs was that at the age of fourteen the 
height then attained should equal the height-to-be, minus 
one-twelfth. Thus, if a boy or girl was five feet tall at four- 
teen, the height when done growing used to be estimated at 
five feet five inches. This is cited more as an instance of 
folklore than as a standard to be taken seriously.

  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 225 
Norts. — Somewhere about twelve or thirteen years of age girls are 
often taller than boys of the same age, because they arrive earlier at 
puberty. A year or two later the boys will overtake and outstrip 
them. 
Dr. Walter Dearborn of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 
says, that until maturity girls are usually a year and a half in advance 
of boys in anatomical development, but that mental tests do not 
show these differences. 
Second Dentition. The four second molars, one at each 
side in upper and lower jaws, may appear anywhere from 
eleven to thirteen years. This makes twenty-eight teeth, 
leaving only the third molars, or “wisdom” teeth — the 
last at the back at each side in each jaw — to come. Since 
these may not appear until the age of twenty-one, when 
legal majority seems to imply the attainment of wisdom, 
no further mention of dentition will be made in this book — 
which does not deal with young persons over eighteen. 
Muscular Development. From nine or ten to twelve years 
old the individual organs will all increase in size. The heart 
muscle will grow proportionately to the size of the body, 
therefore the child will be capable of remarkable activity, 
immunity from fatigue, and great power of physical and 
mental endurance. This should, in general, be an age of 
splendid health and vigor. Statistics show that girls are 
least susceptible to disease at eleven years old, and boys at 
twelve. There are fewer deaths of girls at twelve, and of 
boys at thirteen. This is the time when the child passes 
naturally from play to work, and is a grand time for drill, 
discipline, and drudgery. 
Growth of Brain. The brain, which reached almost its full 
size at about eight years old, continues slowly to grow in 
size up to the age of fourteen or fifteen, but it is now rapidly 
growing in functioning. The intellectual centers are de- 
veloping, the school course should be strengthened, ideals 
of thoroughness in work should be impressed, and thorough 
work demanded. 
The “Awkward Age” for Girls. From eleven to fourteen 
the girl’s awkward age may come, when she is likely to be 
gawky and unattractive, with poor skin and perhaps blotchy 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
    226 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
complexion. Not all girls suffer in this way, and those who 
do grow out of it or slough it off, often in a month or a week, 
or almost before the mother knows the child has come upon 
this phase. 
Care and Training, and Traits of This Age 
Hours for Sleep. From twelve to thirteen both boys and 
girls should have ten hours ne going to bed at nine 
and rising at seven. If they rise earlier the bedtime hour 
should be earlier. 
After twelve, nine hours of sleep are usually enough. 
There is lack of agreement in the sleep requirements of 
different authorities, but the minimum given is too often 
larger than the amount of sleep some children get. Young 
people now live in an environment that demands a greater 
strain on the nerves than they can always bear without 
coming dangerously near breaking point. There is no better 
safeguard against this than plenty of sleep, which is an ac- 
knowledged remedy for nervous instability. 
Outdoor Life and Exercise. To sleep out-doors or on a 
sleeping porch, to attend an out-door school, to do home 
_ study out-of-doors, are all excellent at this time. There 
cannot be too much of such life in the open, and the mini- 
mum time spent every day in exercise in the fresh air should 
not be less than three hours. Parents should see to it that 
this minimum is provided and as much more as possible. 
Dress. The boy goes into long trousers some time during 
these years. When he wants them is the time to let him 
have them. It will probably be the time when other boys are 
wearing them. It is an age when girls love bangles and brace- 
lets, rings, pins, necklaces, chains and jingling trinkets. 
Gifts of this kind will be welcome on birthdays. 
Posture and Carriage. Girls at this age are sometimes 
found with one shoulder or one hip growing higher than the 
other; sometimes a slight degree of spinal curvature is de- 
veloped. Look out for symptoms and have the advice of a 
good physical director. 
Special Tratts of This Age. Many of the angles and much 
   
-P-A-G-E-255
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 227 
of the “Injun” will persist through at least the first two 
years of this period; but the shyness, aloofness, and high 
individuality of the preceding years will gradually be replaced 
by desire for a truer social life, for fellowship and codpera- 
tion, as in team play. Some of the cruelty of the Indian 
may remain, but the instincts of fostering and care for the 
weaker, of love for little children and for live pets, will 
sometimes seem suddenly to flower overnight. One of our 
authorities calls the years from ten to fourteen the “Age of 
Chivalry” (G. W. Fiske: “Boy Life and Self-Government’) ; 
another finds in it traits far removed from the virtues of 
chivalry, growing like tares amid its wheat, and names it 
“The Paradoxical Age.” (“Seven Ages of Childhood,” 
Ella Lyman Cabot.) 
It is often a difficult age for the parent who does not un- 
derstand it. 
More About Obedience. There may be serious difficulties 
in the matter of obedience. The brain, as already remarked, 
is now not far short of its full growth, it is rapidly function- 
ing, and beginning to develop its centers of special power. 
This means that the child’s will, which from early infancy 
has been more or less in evidence, is now claiming its throne 
for life. Now and henceforward it is his own will rather 
than that of another that the child naturally chooses to 
obey. Hence, training in obedience to himself should be em- 
phasized, and in order to strengthen his will and develop 
his ability to choose rightly he should be given as much 
freedom as possible and at the same time stimulated to make 
the right use of this freedom. 
The parents’ part should be to enlist the will, to stimulate 
in the child the desire to do the thing that is right. They 
should listen judicially to protest, they should be tireless 
in explanation. We have known a mother, who, when her 
ten-year-old boy was struggling «with temptation, told him 
that he was free to act according to his choice, free to choose 
which he preferred to be — the weak person who yields to 
impulse, or the strong one who is able to make himself do 
the thing that is hard — and right. “This,” she said, mak- 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
  228 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
ing use, in the interests of right conduct, of the intense 
egoism of this age, ‘‘is a bigger thing to do than to conquer a 
city and it takes a braver soldier to do it.” 
“JT will never try to make you do anything,’ another 
mother used constantly to say to her growing daughter. 
“You know what is right. Unless you are strong enough to 
make yourself do it you will never be the worthwhile woman 
you want to be. The more you can overcome yourself the 
more will be your power of influencing others. The great 
question is, are you able to obey yourself?” Ability to 
exercise one’s own power of self-overcoming has a strong 
appeal, and to leave a child free to do it will often save a 
battle of wills and make for strengthening of character — 
more especially if the child has been trained from the first in 
right exercise of the will. 
Declarations of Independence. The young vigor and 
strength, the sensation of fulness of life at this age, delights 
in breaking away from the authority of adults. “I did what 
I was told until I was twelve,” said a girl, “but after that I 
did nothing but what I liked. I had a little carriage and 
pony and a couple of dogs, and I used to stand up in the car- 
riage and get the ponies to galloping and shout at the top 
of my voice and get the dogs to barking and my mother 
thought I was crazy.” It was her declaration of independ- 
ence, her expression of freedom from the bonds of conven- 
tion, her delight in untramelled action, in power. 
Mothers have to be patient with such things in their 
crude beginnings. They indicate a spirit of enterprize, of 
that independence which thinks for itself, and is not a copy- 
cat or a sheep-like follower of the thoughts or opinions of 
others. When opportunity offers, examples of the true 
power of woman, her influence from the beginning of his- 
tory on the morals of her age, her responsibility for its ideals, 
may be lightly and apparently incidentally touched upon. 
Indirect methods now often work best with girls, and direct 
ones with boys. 
A form of the independence of this age is the pose. Poses 
are now very common. The boy of twelve to fourteen will 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
    BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 229 
often be skeptical, will express doubts as to the efficacy of 
prayer, the ethics of the Federal laws, the advantage of 
continuing school, and the truth of revealed religion. This 
is in part, no doubt, because he is now old enough to think 
for himself, but it is also in part because it sounds inde- 
pendent and manly to differ from other people. It is prob- 
able that so far the skepticism is only skin deep. Girls 
either assume the same poses, or the sentimental and affected 
ones, or the bored and blasé. 
The Gang Age. Together with independence of the adult 
a desire for close codperation with their fellows begins to 
be evident in girls and boys. The girls will form exclusive 
cliques in school and will talk of ‘our crowd.” They will 
band together in groups something like the boys’ “gangs,” 
assume secret and characteristic names by which they are 
known to one another. They will often organize for some 
self-conscious and laudable purpose like study and self-im- 
provement, or sewing and story-telling; sometimes for mere 
silliness — like a group of girls who had regular meetings to 
act the part of dogs, and called their club “The Fidos and 
Rovers,” —but seldom for physical activity and law-break- 
ing, as do the boys. Girls, we are told by many authorities, 
particularly love secret societies and social clubs, dressing-up, 
dramatics, the sesthetic life, and form clubs for clubs’ sake. 
Boys, too, beginning about ten, will think it a fine thing 
to belong to a team, but their teams do not hold together for 
long, they are quickly formed and quickly broken up — 
sometimes to the distress of an uncomprehending parent. 
Such a one will try to encourage the formation of a gang in 
the home woodshed or back yard, will himself enter into 
membership, direct the activities, and try to hold the boys 
together. Some of our authorities approve such methods of 
paternal guidance and cite instances of their success. Others 
emphatically tell the parent to keep “hands off.’ In the 
matter of the short-lived younger gang, it is better, we are 
told, “that a team should disband a dozen times a day than 
that it should be organized by the captain’s father and sus- 
tained through paternal compulsion.” (Pedagogical Seminar, 
® 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  230 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Vol. VII, p. 387.) The younger boy is feeling his way to 
codperation, and in a few years will have developed the 
faculty for it, and for merging himself in a gang that will 
really hang together. 
Savage life and physical activity are the most powerful 
attractions for the boy. Deeds of daring and lawlessness are 
his “declaration of independence.’’ Gangs are formed for 
terrorizing, for “plaguing people,’’ — perhaps a form of the 
practical joke of the preceding period. (See pages 195-6.) 
Mr. J. Adams Puffer, an authority on the gang, concedes the 
cruelty of the boy’s “plaguing” at this age, his delight in 
tormenting and pleasure in the sufferings of his victims. 
But he assures us that this ‘‘sheer savagery” is only a phase, 
to pass with later adolescence. ‘‘Till that time comes the 
wise adult will not attribute to thoroughgoing depravity 
what is only a temporary stage in the boy’s psychic evolu- 
tion.” 
The gangs formed for depredation and stealing will prob- 
ably cause more fret to the mother, who may be less able to 
understand the joys of plunder and pillage. Mothers who 
are shocked at their boys stealing are advised to ask the 
boy’s father whether he ever stole when he was a boy. Both 
Saint Augustine and Henry Ward Beecher confessed to it, 
and the latter says to “look out for the man who denies 
having done it, maybe he is doing it now.” 
That there are gangs which are evil and hurtful for the 
boy is not to be denied, but they are few and will probably 
be avoided by the right-minded youngster. On the other 
hand, membership in a gang provides abundant opportunity 
for acting out the virtues in disguise of this age, its splendid 
endurance, intrepidity, and loyalty. 
Loyalty to the gang implies some form of opposition to 
the governance of the adult. It means “standing by the 
pal.” Therefore, in times of collective mischief where serious 
consequences ensue, no grown-up should ever tempt a boy 
to violate his moral code by “squealing,” “talebearing,” or 
any form of telling on another. Let the boy or girl tell on 
themselves if they alone are responsible, and try to make 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 281 
such “telling” and “owning up” an ideal of conduct. (See 
page 196.) 
Another phase of the independence of this age is the 
marked aloofness of boys from girls and girls from boys. 
Girls express dislike of boys, yet copy them. Boys hate to 
be “sissies” and affect contempt of girls, but many authori- 
ties, including Dr. Stanley Hall, assert this mutual an- 
tagonism is assumed — whether consciously or not — to veil 
interest and attraction. 
Country life is good at the gang age, through offering 
wholesomer outlets for energy. Week-ends and vacations 
should be spent on a farm. Happily the motorcar now 
makes escape from the city possible. 
With both sexes the gang-age is often one of carelessness 
about dress.’ The girl despises clothes that hamper her 
freedom and frocks that may not be dirtied and mussed, 
while the boy glories in things that are rough, grimy, and 
much the worse for wear. Boys now may have to be ad- 
monished to keep finger nails clean and to wash behind their 
ears. But wait awhile. There will be in the next phase a 
reversal of all this. 
Runaway Boys. ‘During these years statistics show that 
many boys run away from home in real earnest. The reasons 
are various. Aspiration towards independence, love of ad- 
venture, impatience of restraint — especially when the home 
is strict, the school is tiresome, and the boy (sometimes the 
girl) overflows with vitality. To provide variety and change 
in the home life, to encourage hobbies and other interests, 
are often preventives. Summers of camping and wild life 
are excellent. 
Summer Camps for Boys and Girls. Ten years old, with 
its hankering for something approaching savagery, is a 
suitable age for a boy’s or girl’s junior camp. Children who 
have been found “difficult”? at home will have many of the 
corners rubbed off, they will learn coéperation and subor- 
dination as well as self-reliance. 
For boys and girls in their teens the camp is almost a 
necessity. “Youth,” someone writes, “must have some-
-P-A-G-E-260
  232 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
thing to do or it is apt to break out in undesirable spots. 
There used to be chores in the home, but these are now ren- 
dered needless by modern invention. Fortunately, their 
equivalent is provided by the camps, together with health- 
ful companionship, fine training, and the education that is 
always to be gained from the ‘sermons that are in stones and 
the books in running brooks.’”’ 
Psychiatrists recommend parents to choose such camps 
as provide for the children some optional hours every day, 
some free time to occupy as they please, some time for soli- 
tude and by-one’s-self-ness. (See page 232.) In many of the 
camps, following our American passion for standardization, 
all the time is planned out, thus depriving young people of 
initiative and making them dependent on schedules. 
Boy anp Grru Scout anp OTHER Movements 
The object of the Scout movement is to cultivate in boys 
and girls a spirit of fortitude, self-reliance, courage, help- 
fulness to others, and better citizenship by and by. To 
these the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. add Christianity, in 
the interests of a later Christian citizenship. It has for some 
time fortunately been recognized that young people cannot 
be approached as adults are approached. There is in the 
Scout and other organizations a play element that is attrac- 
tive because of its reality, and it is no exaggeration to say 
_ that nothing short of wonders have been worked in actual 
transformation of character, both in boys and girls, during 
this critical period, through societies where the gang in- 
stinct is utilized and directed to good. 
Certain forms of initiation, such as the vigil — required 
in associations like the Knights of King Arthur, the Gala- 
hads, and the Wood-Craft League instituted by Thompson- 
Seton — and other ancient forms known to satisfy the 
adolescent needs of outlet for the deep-lying sentiment, the 
aspiration towards heroism of this age, are made use of as 
good for the young people, without knowledge on their part 
that good to them is the ulterior motive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 233 
Every boy and girl should belong to one of these bands. 
It is a pity that the desire of girls to play the boy at this age 
has caused Girl Scouts to attract larger numbers than Camp- 
Fire Girls, with their beautiful rites, touched with a mys- 
tical quality. However, any organization for girls that 
fosters in them the manly virtues of truth and straight- 
forwardness, endurance, courage, loyalty, and fair play, is to 
be welcomed. 
Parent and Child Relation At This Age 
During these four years there will probably be more 
striking changes in the development of character and per- 
sonality than ever before, there will be irregularities and 
aberrancies (to coin a word) to correspond with the leaps 
and bounds of brain and body growth, and the parents will 
probably experience many surprises. They will learn — if 
they have not already learned — that it is impossible to 
mold their offspring according to their private desires and 
hopes. The children are individuals, they will strike out 
for themselves, they will show certain traits which are un- 
changeable. The parent has no right to try to make the 
child conform to his ideal. The leopard cannot change his 
spots — but he can make his spots to be things of beauty. 
It is said that at ten years old the child is less amenable to 
authority than at any age before or after. The will is strong, 
and parents may take comfort from the consideration that 
with a strong will there usually goes good judgment and 
power of self-control — though these may not appear until 
later. i 
Boys at this age do not as a rule enjoy womanish fussing 
over them, they don’t like to have finishing-off touches 
given to collars, ties, or buttons, by female relatives, and 
they mostly hate to be kissed. A boy now grows shy in his 
confidences to his elders and may be shy and distrustful of 
all strange grown-ups. His confidence should never be 
forced, his right to give it or reserve it should be respected — 
but if made it should be kept inviolate. That the child 
should confide in his parents is much to be desired, yet many
-P-A-G-E-262

  234 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
children seek an outlet elsewhere, having experienced lack 
of understanding in the parent. At this age they so easily 
close up in secretiveness and reserve that the parent has to 
be on guard. Advice should not be proffered too insistently, 
sympathy and understanding should be shown rather than 
disapproval, and parents should meet the child as an equal. 
Nothing so quickly helps to make a breach as to treat the 
boy or girl like a child whose judgment is not matured. 
Girls, too, at this age are often shy and wild, loving their 
own way, secretive. Between mother and daughter there is 
often an aloofness that is almost a rupture, and this fre- 
quently persists. The rare mother who wins her daughter’s 
confidence now will probably hold it for life. 
This aloofness from parents at the age of from twelve to 
fourteen often proceeds from the rebellion of the boy or girl 
at protection, at subordination when they seek companion- 
ship on an equality. It comes from love of novelty and new 
friends — parents are an old story. It comes from a young 
intolerance of the parents’ claim to love and obedience. 
‘Parents should never claim as a right the love of their chil- 
dren, they should know that nobody can love another from 
a sense of duty. That children should love their parents is 
natural if the parents have not unwisely forfeited their love, 
and one way to do so is to demand it as a right. 
Sympathy, commendation, approval, is sweet to young 
people now, and when they find this outside of the home 
more easily than in it, a breach will be inevitable. The first 
to recognize both good looks and fine qualities in the boy or 
girl should be the parents, and such qualities should be, 
in heart-to-heart confidences, welcomed and commended. 
There are still parents who keep harping on defects, and to 
whom beauty and goodness in their children might be non- 
existent for all that is said about them. 
Girls are particularly sensitive to commendation of their 
looks. Nearly every girl at this time wants to be pretty, 
and sympathetic observers assert that to tell a girl she is 
pretty will develop beauty in her. It will at least give her 
that sense of satisfaction and confidence which makes for

BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 235 
the charm of ease and self-forgetfulness. The mother should 
be the first to find beauties in her daughter and sweetly to 
compliment her on them. “Never,” says someone in advice 
to mothers, ‘‘tell a girl she is homely unless she is so unde- 
niably pretty that she won’t believe you.” 
Between 10-14 some boys and girls are found self-dis- 
trustful, and prone to “give up trying,” to brand them- 
selves as unable to do this, that, or some other thing. 
Parents and teachers must spare no pains to eradicate this 
habit of thought, which is likely to inhibit effort, and the 
child should be trained and encouraged to try and try again 
in different ways, until he forms the opposite habit of faith 
in his own powers, and of being stimulated by defeat to 
achieve final success. 
Pets, Playthings, and Games from Ten to Fourteen 
Live Pets. The best authorities are in agreement that up 
to ten years old it is safest not to give a child live pets of his 
own. (See page 201.) Not until the observant parent sees 
the development of the protective and fostering instincts 
towards animals or younger children, which succeed the 
barbarism of the savage age, should there be exclusive owner- 
ship of a dependent animal. About ten years old — sonie- 
times sooner — is a good time to give pets, preferably those 
that can take part in their owner’s activities, and which, 
like a pony, a dog, or a goat, may be freely hugged and 
handled and are not likely to misunderstand or be incon- 
venienced by exuberant demonstrations of affection. The 
bond between man and dog is older than history, and a dog 
is almost indispensable to a rightly lived boyhood. It is as 
educative for the boy as the doll for the girl. On the farm 
young animals may be given for ownership to both boy and 
girl and the children made responsible for their care. All 
such “humanizing relations” with the lower life have been 
found of high benefit in developing the nurturing and un- 
selfish instincts, and Dr. Cabot says that “for certain chil- 
dren the care of pet animals is an important road to salva- 
tion.”
-P-A-G-E-264
236 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
  Gifts and Play Material. This is an age for all the up- 
and-doing things, when the boy — and the girl too — loves 
a good knife. A box of tools and a shop of his own in base- 
ment or shed is now a great thing for a boy. A delight in 
tools and carpentering makes a bond with his home at this 
wild age. This was probably the age when the Father of 
his Country used his axe so disastrously, and rode his 
mother’s finest young colt to its death. 
Boys and girls at this age like to do things. The interest 
in making collections, in photography, wood carving and 
lathe work and sloyd, pottery and work in clay, making 
puppet theatres, gardening, beekeeping, poultry raising, 
and similar doings is very great and should be generously 
provided for. 
Love of adventure is strong, stronger than love of play, 
and as a means to this a boy will now crave a gun and his 
mother will be afraid to let him have one, In this contin- 
gency we beg she will read the paragraph beginning ‘“ After 
eight years old, sometimes before it,” on page 192. At this 
age the craving for a gun may be all over, deep down, and 
so keen that it hurts. See how happy the boy can be made 
by the gift of a fine rifle. 
Love of adventure also calls for a wild, free life. The 
camp for either boy or girl satisfies this, and where it is im- 
possible let them rig up a tent somewhere and live in it, eat 
in it, sleep in it. 
Introduction to Team Games. In this more wholesomely 
gregarious age, which succeeds the period when the ego de- 
manded high relief, team games will be natural. But from 
ten to eleven or twelve the self is not yet quite ready to be 
merged in the group, and such transition games as “ Follow 
My Leader” (played also in the last period); ‘‘ Run, Sheep, 
Run,” a team form of “Hide and Seek”; “Captain Ball,” 
mentioned by Bancroft as “one of the most useful games 
for pupils beginning to enjoy organization,” and adapted to 
both boys and girls. “Hare and Hounds,” “ Leapfrog 
Race,” “Ring Toss” and all other games which, when 
played with sides, give opportunity for individual distinction
-P-A-G-E-265
    
BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 237 
and also encourage the team spirit, are good introductions 
to more real team games. 
The True Team Games. These will be enjoyed only when 
every player no longer wants to “boss the gang.” Team 
games are in the truest sense of the word educational, since 
there is developed in the boy or girl who works as a unit in 
a corps the qualities of loyalty, subordination, and a sense 
of honor. Most particularly are these games essential for 
girls, to rid them of personal littleness and develop in them 
a manly sense of honor and fair play. In the team game 
there is in both sexes, that losing of the self to find the self 
which may possibly not be arrived at in any other way. 
Ball games are the most popular, and of these baseball 
and football come first. A boy of ten years old could be 
second base, and at twelve years old regular “nines” are 
often formed. There are also modified forms of baseball, 
like “ Town Ball” and “ Kick Ball”. There is also a modified 
football (American Football), where a big rubber ball is 
used, there is no tripping of a player, and the dangers to 
life and limb of college football are absent. 
Other good ball games are cricket, hockey, shinney, basket- 
ball, and many more. Girls as well as boys now play all 
these games. 
Games Calling for Muscle Control. Muscle control is now 
good, the hand and arm muscles are strong, and “Duck on a 
Rock,’’ “ Quoits,” ‘‘ Mumblety-Peg,”, and other games, are 
enjoyed. Bancroft described the Indian game of “ Rolling 
Target,” where a stick is shot or thrown through a rolling 
hoop, as one which makes an instant success on its intro- 
duction to boys. 
Racing and Running Games. The increase in lung and 
chest capacity and the fine “wind” at this age make for 
success in all games of running and racing, potato races, 
relay races, and the like. Long hikes and mountain climb- 
ing are in order. 
Boxing, fencing, bowling, track and field sports, are all 
fit for young people from twelve up. School gymnastics 
are better than nothing, but not nearly so good as athletic 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
    238 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
games, or games that are planned in the interests of physical 
culture. This is now being recognized in the gymnasium 
and games take the place of formal exercises, affording phys- 
ical and psychical delight. (See page 238.) 
Games for Nimble Wits. Games of verse-making like 
“Gobblelinks” and “Crambo”; of pantomime and guessing, 
like “Dumb Crambo,”’ charades, “Hands Up, Hands Down” 
(“Up, Jenkins” is another name), provoking laughter and 
intense interest; also the intelligent guessing of ‘‘ Earth, Air, 
Fire, and Water,” of “ Bird, Beast, or Fish,” and the mental 
and physical alertness of “Spin the Platter,” and games of 
riddles and puzzles, “Authors and Celebrities,’ may be 
counted among the quieter plays for this age. 
Checkers, dominoes, and cards will be played from twelve 
years on; marbles are not enjoyed after thirteen. Children 
now immensely enjoy parlor magic, and they like to play 
with magnets, prisms, and other simple scientific apparatus. 
Dramatic ability improves during these years, excellent 
impersonations will be made, and simple plays presented. 
Work like this, also the performance of assigned feats and 
stunts, are of high value in overcoming self-consciousness 
and developing the charm of self-forgetfulness. 
Besides the foregoing, many of the suggestions for games 
and play for the last period (pages 198-205) will be found 
appropriate to this. 
Books for This and Early in the Neat Period 
Storybooks. Some of the old-fashioned books, loved by 
generations of girls and boys, and far from having outlived 
their interest, are: the Alcott books; “Jackanapes” and 
others by Mrs. Ewing; ‘John Halifax’ and practically all 
by Dinah Mulock Craik; “Master Skylark” (John Ben- 
nett); “‘Hans Brinker” (Mary Mapes Dodge); the ‘What 
Katy Did” series (Coolidge); the “Isabel Carleton”? books 
(Margaret Ashmun); and “A New England Girlhood” 
(Lucy Larcom) with its pictures of the girl of long ago, its 
subtile humor and charm. 
“Anne of Green Gables” and her long list of successors 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  
  BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 239 
(Montgomery); ‘‘Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” (Mrs. 
Wiggin); are wholesome reading for girls at this age, who 
do not find their sweetness cloying, as do over-critical adults. 
Jules Verne is one of the immortals, joyfully read by girls 
as well as boys. 
“The Man Without A Country” (Hale); “The Flag” 
(Frances N. Greene); ‘‘The Perfect Tribute” and “The 
Counsel Assigned” (Mrs. Andrews); are stories to kindle 
fine patriotism. Marryat’s tales of the sea are excellent 
stories of ships and sea life before the days of steam. 
For pictures, respectively, of pioneer days and early 
colonial times, “The Boy Emigrants” (Noah Brooks) and 
“Blithe McBride” (Susan Coolidge) are recommended. 
Good stories of school life are: ““Tom Brown’s School- 
days” (Hughes); ‘The Spirit of the School,” and “For the 
Honor Of the School” (Barbour); “Grannis of the Fifth” 
(Arthur Stanwood Pier); “That Year at Lincoln High” 
(Joseph Gollomb) ; and “High Benton” (Heyliger). “When 
Sarah Went to School” (Singmaster); “Ruthie” (Phyllis 
Duganne); and “The Orcutt Girls” (Vaile), a story of a 
girls’ school fifty years ago; will be read by girls — and they 
will also read the stories of boys at school. 
Colby, in “ Literature and Life in School,” especially rec- 
ommends as among the indispensables, ‘‘Tom Sawyer” 
(Clemens); and “The Court of Boyville” (William Allen 
White). ‘‘Peck’s Bad Boy” is forbidden, but Aldrich’s 
“Story of a Bad Boy” is named as one of the must-be-reads. 
Stories of adventure, achievement and “making good” 
are: ‘‘Kim” and “Captains Courageous” (Kipling); “The 
Boy Scout” (Richard Harding Davis); ‘Forest Runners” 
and “Horsemen of the Plains” (Altsheler); “Off Side” 
(Heyliger); “Beach Patrol” (Drysdale); ‘Billy Topsail” 
(Norman Duncan), in which “Dr. Luke”’ of Labrador plays 
a part; “Jim Davis,” a story of smugglers, and “Martin 
Hyde” (John Galsworthy), which is a tale of spies and mys- 
tery of the days of Charles II, warranted to interest anyone 
not discouraged by many long, solid paragraphs; ‘Master 
of the Strong Hearts” (Elbridge Streeter Brooks), in which
-P-A-G-E-268
  240 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Custer’s rally against Sitting Bull is woven into a story of 
adventure for boys; and surely “Treasure Island” and 
“Kidnapped” (Stevenson), both full of thrills and excite- 
ment, but with heroes that are clean and strong. In tales 
of achievement, carefully avoid those of too easily won 
success. 
Dog Stories. Boys who love and understand a dog should 
read one or more of the following dog stories —some of 
them true and some good enough to be true. “Baldy of 
Nome” (Esther P. Darling) ; “Bar Sinister” (Richard Hard- 
ing Davis); “Bob, Son of Battle” (Ollivant); “Dog of 
Flanders” (Louise de la Ramée); ‘‘ Frank of Freedom Hill” 
(Samuel A. Derieux); ‘Greyfriars Bobby” (Atkinson); 
“Lad” (Albert Payson Terhune), and many other dog 
stories by this author; ‘Rab and His Friends” (John 
Brown); “‘Stickeen” (John Muir); and ‘Good Dog Stories,” 
a late publication by Houghton Mifflin Company. 
Myth and Legend. Now that the old humanities are being 
displaced in schools by the new practicalities it becomes im- 
portant that young people shall not be wholly cheated out of 
the treasures of the classics. Both the “Iliad” and ‘ Odys- 
sey.’ have been done into English by Andrew Lang, who has 
preserved the fine simplicity of the originals. In“ Adventures 
of Odysseus” and “Tale of Troy” (Padraic Colum) these 
stories have been a good deal “‘Columized,” but the spirit 
is preserved; and we are told that the “Iliad for Boys and 
Girls” by A. J. Church, pleases its readers; also the “ Aineid 
for Boys and Girls” by the same author. For the Norse 
myths “Children of Odin” (Colum) is recommended. 
“Myths of Greece and Rorne” and ‘‘Myths of the Northern 
Lands” (Helen Guerber); also ‘‘Classic Myths” (Galey); 
“Heroic Legends” (Herbertson); and “Legends of King 
Arthur and His Court” (Frances Nimmo Greene), simply 
and beautifully told, may serve as an introduction to How- 
ard Pyle’s more extended and rather heavier account. 
“The Arabian Nights” though strictly not either myth or 
legend, is excellent (in expurgated form) for its Oriental 
atmosphere. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
    BOY AND GIRL FROM TEN TO FOURTEEN 241 
That classic allegory, Bunyan’s “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” 
is one of the works of obligation for everybody’s reading; 
and boys and girls from twelve on ought to read Swift’s 
“Gulliver’s Travels” with keen appreciation of its hidden 
and inward significance. This is missed if read earlier. 
History and Biography. ‘“Boy’s Parkman” (Louise S. 
Hasbrouck), where the thrilling and interesting is culled 
from the less attractive reading in Parkman’s works; “Boy’s 
Motley” (H. W. Banks), treated like Parkman; and “Boy’s 
Froissart,” of which it should be enough to say it was 
edited by Sidney Lanier, are all very readable. ‘La Salle 
and the Discovery of the Great West” (Parkman); the very 
well told “Stories of the Pilgrims” (Pumphrey) ; “ American 
Hero Stories,” ‘Old World Hero Stories,” and ‘Hero 
Stories of France” (Tappan); “Four Great Americans,” 
and “Fifty Famous Stories Retold” (Baldwin); “Heroes of 
Chivalry and Romance” (Church), noted for its good de- 
scriptions; that fine book, too little known-by boys and 
girls whom it is sure to interest, “Heroes and Hero Wor- 
ship” (Thomas Carlyle); the lives of Lincoln, Lafayette 
and Grant (Helen Nicolay); “Guns of Bull Run” and 
“Guns of Shiloh” (Altsheler); the story by a boy of seven- 
teen, ‘Into the Frozen South” (Scout Marr); “Heroes of 
the Farthest North” and “Heroes of the Farthest South” 
(Maclean), which are tales of the great expeditions; ‘Gren- 
fell: Knight-Errant of the North” (Fullerton Waldo); 
“Heroes of Today” (of the Great War), “Heroes of Serv- 
ice” and “Heroines of Service’? (Mary R. Parkman); also 
“The Great Captain” (Tynan) who was Sir Walter Raleigh; 
“Joan of Arc” (Boutet de Monville); ““The Story of Gen- 
eral Gordon” (Boutet de Monville), a fine life of this fine 
soldier; and the ‘Roll Call of Honor’ (Quiller-Couch), all 
are interesting books for vitalizing and sweetening the 
study of history. 
Nature and Science. The comprehensible parts of “Water 
Babies” (Kingsley); ‘Insect Adventures” (Fabre), written 
for his own children; “Kindred of the Wild” (Roberts), 
authentic and interesting nature stories; the wonderful 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  242 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
“Wild Brother” (Underwood); “Bird Stories” (Edith 
Patch), accurate and interesting; “Birds and Bees” (Bur- 
roughs); “Earth and Sky Every Child Should Know” 
(Julia Ellen Rogers); or for older children, ‘The Geological 
Story Briefly Told” (Dana); “The Book of the Stars for 
Young People” (W. T. Olcott); “Nature Secrets” (Cham- 
bers), a very readable introduction to science; also the 
“Book of Wireless,” “Magic of Science,” “Book of Chem- 
istry” and ‘The Book of Stars,” this last conforms to the 
tests of the Boy Scouts, all by A. F. Collins; “Stories in 
Trees,” Mary I. Curtis, informational, with touches of fun, 
mystery, and charm, are safe to choose for boys and girls 
likely to be interested in these subjects. For general in- 
formation the “Boy’s Book of Knowledge” (The Grolier 
Press, N. Y.) is found absorbing by boys and girls alike. 
Poetry. This is the age when “Lays of Ancient Rome” 
(Macaulay) captivate both girls and boys. We have known 
girls to prefer Horatius and boys who liked Virginia best of 
these poems. They will probably be dramatized and you 
may look to see your girl with a strip of red flannel pinned 
to her nightgown as she plays the part of the 
“ — woman fair and stately,” 
who 
“Pointed to her bleeding breast, 
And shrieked, and fled away.” 
Other suggestions are: “Sir Patrick Spens,” than whose 
story, described as “a heroic bending of the will to the per- 
formance of duty, though the flesh and the heart repine,” 
there is none better. Other suggestions are: “Herve Riel,” 
“How They Brotight the Good News” (Browning) ; “Sohrab 
and Rustum,” that fine poem of love and grief of father and 
son (Arnold); and many more by the same author, who is 
not nearly so well known among us as he should be. Of 
course the “Charge of the Light Brigade’’ will be read; and, 
as in the last period, it will be safe to give children the free- 
dom of the great English poets, and of Longfellow and

Lowell, Whittier, Bryant, Sidney Lanier, Aldrich, Gilder, 
and other of the so-called minor poets whose verse is true 
poetry. 
Many boys and girls at this age enjoy James Whitcomb 
Riley. 
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “The Merchant of 
Venice’’ will probably be high favorites; both are good to 
initiate the taste for Shakespere. 
Nor. — While we deprecated tragedy for younger children, there 
is a natural hunger for it in early adolescence. Boys love to be stirred 
to the very depths, girls are never so happy as when in a revelry of 
grief and tears over “A Dog of Flanders,” or “Little Nell,” the “Sor- 
rows of Evelyn Hope,” ‘Enoch Arden,” or perhaps “Pompilia” — if 
they adventure the reading of ‘The Ring and the Book.” This pure 
joy in the emotion of sorrow is not so morbid as it may seem. William 
Dean Howells explains it in his statement that those who are very 
young and very happy crave stories of grief and tragedy because of 
their delight in sharp and accentuated contrast,

  Cuapter VIII 
ADOLESCENCE AND THE HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 
Adolescence is the period of growing time between child- 
hood and maturity. With girls, it is estimated to be from 
twelve to twenty-one; with boys, from fourteen to twenty- 
five. 
Food and Diet 
Amount of Food Now Needed. If anything, the amount 
of food called for will be larger than ever. The only limit 
should be that of appetite and digestion. It is said that a 
lack of the generous plenty, the unrestricted abundance de- 
manded by nature at this age, causes the boy to drift into 
intemperate habits, the girl to become a candy addict, 
and both to frequent the soda fountain and soft-drinks 
parlors excessively. 
Parents should be aware that during this period, as be- 
fore, there is present the same mysterious need of the vital 
forces for supernutrition. Also, there is unquestioned evi- 
dence that unstinted and nutritious food at this time is a 
safe investment for vigor and endurance in the years to 
come. 
Foods Allowed. No close supervision of the diet will prob- 
ably be possible. It is not likely to be tolerated. The co- 
operation of those big boys and girls, if this has been won 
earlier, and the habits formed at the well-conducted home 
table, if these have been fostered, are the best foundation 
for the hope that a fairly correct diet will be kept up. 
As an aid to codperation the ideal of a maturity of superb 
health and vitality, of mental poise and bodily mastery, of 
well-founded self-confidence, of faith and hope in high effi- 
ciency and future service, may be pictured. A boy or girl 
with these high hopes will often avoid excess of sugar, know- 
244
-P-A-G-E-275
    
ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 245 
ing that it eliminates calcium and thus hurts teeth and bone 
formation. They will use milk more freely and will in gen- 
eral apply the rules of correct dietetics. Especially at this 
age the need of iodine is emphasized by physicians. Where 
this element is deficient there is said to be danger of goiter 
from what they call “hypertrophy of the thyroid gland.” 
Neither will the organs of generation mature perfectly if 
iodine is deficient. This important element is found in 
organic form in water-cress, oysters, and dulse and other 
edible seaweeds. 
Foods Forbidden. There are now only a few things to be 
avoided: (1) Highly seasoned food, such as thermidors and 
deviled dishes; cheese rabbits that burn with cayenne; cur- 
ries and all the piquant dishes concocted to spur a jaded 
elderly appetite. This, because high and excessive season- 
ing causes an instability of the mucus membrane that pro- 
duces a craving for still stronger and more hurtful stimula- 
tion. 
(2) Fried food of all kinds should positively be tabooed. 
Most fats, when heated to frying temperature, decompose, 
forming irritant poisons. The work of digestion is increased, 
the energy for this process is abstracted from more worthy 
activities, and a dulling of the intellect and an incapacity 
for clear thinking may result. (See page 213.) 
(3) Stimulants such as tea and coffee, which affect the 
nerves, are not needed by young people and should not 
properly be used under the age of thirty years, when nerve 
poise ought to be established. The nerves at adolescence 
are likely to be disturbed by nerve stimulants. 
When to “Let Up” in Dietetic Restrictions. Let us recall 
the little four-year-old foot, unfitted for long walks which 
it may be subjected to only at the risk of injury to be 
demonstrated in later years. Let us recall the young six- 
year-old brain, engaged much in growing and little in func- 
tioning, which may be exposed to the stress of arithmetic 
only at the cost of normal and healthy development in later 
years. So with the stomach and intestinal tract. Foods 
difficult to deal with may be thrust on them while immature
-P-A-G-E-276
  246 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
only at the cost of future strength. But after the first 
fifteen years of life, says one of our authorities, if up to then 
the diet has been carefully regulated the digestive organs 
will have gained their full strength and for at least twenty 
years to come may be trusted with anything in reason. 
A Food Fable for Mothers. Once upon a time a mother who 
had been scrupulously careful with regard to the diet of her 
three children, permitted them to accept an invitation to 
Thanksgiving dinner at the home of some young friends of 
their own age. The children did n’t get over the effects of 
that dinner for a week, though none of the other young 
guests were found to have turned a hair. The troubled 
mother reported to her physician, who was also the family 
dietitian, that her children’s stomachs were abnormally 
“weak,” being unable to stand even a little piece of mince 
pie. He explained to her that the other children, having 
been accustomed to dealing with what were poisons at their 
age, showed a tolerance of them purchased by undermin- 
ing their development. “Wait,” he said, “for twenty 
years hence, for results of the right diet up to fourteen or 
fifteen.” 
Disorders of Appetite 
Lack of Appetite Caused by Over-Fussiness. This is more 
frequently one of the affectations of girls at this age, who 
sometimes think it is “nice” to be pernickety. Sometimes 
it is a matter of imitation of an older and looked-up-to friend; 
sometimes it proceeds from too much self-centering and in- 
trospection, sometimes it is nerves, and appetite is freaky or 
capricious as a result perhaps of illness or a succession of 
illnesses in early childhood. 
The remedy is simple dishes, carefully prepared, with abun- 
dance of out-door life, healthful young companionship, sum- 
mers spent in the country, camp life and picnicking, and 
above all, taking no notice of the fussiness except perhaps 
to try the effects of a little good-humored teasing. This last, 
with a nervous and sensitive child, has to be used in small 
doses and its effects watched. If there is present that saving 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
        ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 247 
grace — a sense of humor — it will tide over this and many 
other difficulties. 
Inability to Hat Because of Some Disorder of the Teeth. This 
reason for a disordered appetite is given by one of the older 
authorities, before the era of dental inspection in schools. 
Every high school youngster should have a thorough dental 
inspection at least once a year — better, twice — whether 
or not there is complaint of the teeth. Marks of arrested 
development are shown by ridges or serrations on teeth, or 
by change in their bony constituents. 
Depraved Appetite. Sometimes a boy or girl will eat slate 
pencils, chalk, plaster, blackboard crayons, wax candles, 
and other extraordinary and nonalimentary substances. In 
a few cases this is caused by a natural craving for some in- 
gredient, e.g., mineral matter, lacking in the diet. More 
often it is the result of an unbalanced nervous system. The 
muscles of the jaw are growing strong, the nerves that con- 
trol them stimulate use, and the chewing habit is formed 
and difficult to give up. When to chew spruce gum or wheat 
grains was the only outlet for this desire there was small 
harm in the chewing; but the taste has unhappily been 
pandered to by the chewing gum manufacturers. 
The remedy, again, is to enlist codperation. To encour- 
age the use of foods containing the lime or other element 
possibly craved by the one who eats plaster, to tell the young 
chewers that they are overworking the salivary glands, to 
tell girls that the shape of mouth, lips, and jaw will be 
spoiled, are suggested helps. Try quiet reasoning. Try an 
appeal to the power of inhibition (see pages 263-4), making 
it seem a big piece of self-mastery to be able to stop, putting 
it in the form of a “Can you do it?” Consultation with 
your physician may be necessary if the habit persists. 
Growth and Development from Fourteen to Highteen 
Years 
Boys and girls now make long strides in growing, they in- 
crease faster in height and weight than at any other period 
of life, not excepting infancy.

Height and Weight as Signs of Health. For discussion of 
this, especially where these signs fail, and the percentage 
that may be safely allowed over or under the average height 
and weight, see page 177. 
Growth of Body, Nerves, and Brain. The volume of the 
heart now increases almost to adult size, while the arterial 
system does not keep up with it, consequently is found 
diminished in proportion. The result is increased blood 
pressure. This finds relief in physical activity. 
The muscles develop in strength, there is fine codrdination 
and control of them, and the hands are strong and often a 
source of pride to the girl or boy. 
There is an all-round rapid physiological development 
and a consequent strain on the circulatory organs. 
The nervous system is highly organized and very sensitive. 
There is a demand for an increased supply of blood for the 
rapid life-changes, the wearing out and destruction of nerve 
and other cells, and their re-creation and repair. These 
swiftly alternating processes accompany increased mental 
activity; and nervous instability, lack of nerve equilibrium, 
is now common. 
The intellectual centers, the association centers, in the 
brain develop quickly at this time, and sometimes at the ex- 
pense of other areas, resulting, for instance, in a blunting of 
sense perception. 
The capacity of the lungs is increaséd, there are more red 
corpuscles in the blood, more carbon dioxide is given off. 
The wisdom teeth —the last four molars — may appear 
at seventeen, or any time before twenty-five. Sometimes 
these are forgotten by nature, sometimes she develops one 
or two of them and lets the others go. 
Special Signs of Puberty. The change of voice in the boy, 
which comes somewhere about fifteen, when he has to leave 
the church choir. This voice manifests the most curious 
variations from day to day and hour to hour. Sometimes 
it squeaks and squawks, sometimes it hoarsely burrs and 
bellows, and we have known more than one innocent mother 
to apply poultices to her son’s throat or dose him with flax- 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
    250 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
seed tea and be mildly surprised at the ineffectiveness of 
the remedies, while the father looked on in secret and huge 
enjoyment. 
The boy is further marked by what Dr. Stanley Hall calls 
“physiological ugliness.” He has the roughness which will 
later be virility, he is full of awkwardnesses — all legs and 
elbows — and is apt socially to do the wrong thing, in the 
wrong place, at the wrong time, and in an improper manner. 
The girl’s figure develops at this age, her angles become 
rounded curves, her hair grows abundant and glossy, her 
voice is sweet — and Dr. Hall thinks that from eighteen to 
twenty she is “nearest the ideal of feminine beauty and 
perfection.” From fourteen to eighteen she has, like an 
opening flower, the charm of promise. 
At sixteen the girl wants to “put up her hair,” if it is 
not bobbed; and the father (who is oftenest responsible for 
the non-bob) forbids it. At eighteen she insists on turning 
up the braid, father or no father, but the regular ‘‘coiffure” 
is not allowed by the mother. 
Some time during these years the boy will want to shave 
a possible moustache whether he needs to or not. 
Girls often stop growing at seventeen, but we have known 
many of them to continue to grow until twenty-one. Boys 
often stop at eighteen, but they may keep on until twenty- 
four or five. 
Eruption of acne and other pimples, roughness of the 
upper arm, etc., are often among the phases of this age and 
are extremely mortifying to young people. These need not 
cause alarm, but the physician should be consulted. 
Care During This Period 
Aim at Adolescence. The aim at adolescence should be 
to preserve and further to cultivate the body and brain 
during this time of physical and mental transformation. 
Observation should therefore be directed towards the fol- 
lowing points: 
Rate of increase in weight for proportionate height. 
Signs of fatigue after work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
    
ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 251 
Symptoms of lassitude after rising in the morning. 
Tendency to lack of physical and mental control. 
Carefully avoid questioning about health, or in any way 
fostering an unwholesome subjectivity. 
Dangers to be Avoided at this Period, Especially in 
Girls 
Anemia. This is either a deficiency of blood, or of some 
important constituent of the blood, especially hemaglobin. 
It is of common occurrence at puberty and the dietetic treat- 
ment is of much importance. The food should be nutritious 
and easily digested, with abundance of protein, with milk 
between meals, perhaps malted milk at night upon going to 
bed, plenty of fruit, eggs, vegetables, and of foods contain- 
ing iron. (See pages 217-18 for list.) Foods to be avoided 
now are pastry and sweet, and excess of all starches. Rest, 
fresh air, and sunshine, pleasurable interest in life and 
cheerful companionship are further recommended. 
Nervous Disturbance. This more subtle disorder is also 
common among girls at this time. Sometimes it is due to 
nerve strain, strain of school and study; or to improper care 
and training during the pre-adolescent years, such as emo- 
tional excitements and insufficient strengthening of the will. 
Such neglect now often bears evil fruit. It may also proceed 
from an oversubjective mental attitude; and sometimes 
from imitation, or catching a habit. 
Its symptoms are general lack of control over words and 
actions, manifested by immoderate expression of emotion 
(see page 249), of grief, laughter, love, or dislike. An inability 
to sit or stand still without jerking and fidgeting, especially 
with hands and feet, is another symptom; so is an abnormal 
craving for attention and sympathy. 
Wholesome food, easily digested fats, plenty of sleep, 
fresh fruit, and abundance of sunshine and fresh air, are 
recommended. 
Hysteria. This is a more serious form of nervous dis- 
turbance, where the symptoms are all exaggerated. 
Remedies are: exercise, out-door games, fresh air, and —
-P-A-G-E-282
  252 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
often very important — absence of comment or any form of 
“taking notice” on the part of the adult. 4 
Demonstration of wholesome contempt for a hysterical 
proneness to “go to pieces,” and warm commendation of 
the woman who is well-balanced and controlled, may be 
judiciously employed. At this period it is of high importance 
that habits of sound nerves should be formed, if the future 
woman is to be sane, well-poised, and efficient. Coercion 
from without is of small use —the will of the individual 
must be enlisted. 
Moral training at this time isof highimportance. Thought- 
fulness for others should be inculcated, self-control, obedi- 
ence to the laws of health. Also the educational training 
should include wider and more altruistic interests. 
The advice of the psychiatrist should be sought before 
any nervous tendency becomes established, or bad nerve 
habits may persist. 
Aside from the three special dangers just discussed, many 
authorities are of the opinion that adolescence is a period 
of improved health and marked power to resist disease. 
This opinion, however, is not universal and is contradicted 
by authorities of equal repute, who state that nervously 
high-strung youths of this age are extremely liable to disease 
— and that all youths are nervously high-strung. It is true 
that in our experience many boys and girls have had to drop 
out in the third or fourth year of High School through ill- 
ness due to some emotional problem not yet solved — some- 
times sex, sometimes religion, or any other. 
Plenty of Sleep Needed. Now, when the young people are 
growing by leaps and bounds, when nervous energy is being 
squandered and nervous instability is so common as to be 
almost normal, there is an especial need of sleep. Nine to 
ten hours ought to be the allowance. Physicians who deal 
with our aviators say the nervous troubles from which they 
suffer may be attributed to the high tension at which they 
live, and which is not balanced by enough sleep. “On ac- 
count of insufficiency of sleep,’”’ writes one of these, “firm- 
nerved men become vacillating and irritable and quick to 
   
-P-A-G-E-283
         ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS = 253 
take offence. Troubles that would be laughed away by 
rested men are magnified by sluggish brains. Most aviators 
are querulous about trivial matters, they complain of minor 
inconveniences, they are unduly sensitive to pain.” 
Not only the airmen among our adolescents, but all others, 
girls as well as boys, live at the high tension that creates a 
demand for sleep in almost as great excess as the demand for 
food. 
Bathing. The cold plunge, the cold shower, followed by 
a fine reaction, are excellent. So is sea-bathing, provided that 
in all of these practices moderation is used. Boys and girls 
should not exhaust themselves in swimming, they should 
not take a cold plunge if they come out of it chilled, shiver- 
ing, and blue-lipped. Since moderation and adolescence are 
incompatible, this should be one of the rare occasions for an 
exercise of parental authority. 
Nevertheless, remember O parent, that it makes a boy 
angry to be told to take care of himself, not to get chilled, 
not to run into danger, not to catch cold or get his feet wet. 
A military command, short and decisive —no questions 
answered and no arguments entered into — when rules of 
hygiene are transgressed, should be given and obeyed. 
Exercise for Boys. The trainers of young colts know that 
the animal needs exercise of the most vigorous kind. To 
quote one of them, “You have to race him and work him to 
the limit.” Vigorous exercise in the open is of even greater 
importance to the young male during adolescence. It is a 
safety valve. Says John Taintor Foote: (in ‘‘ Pocono Shot’’), 
“They’re at the mercy of natural instincts during their 
formative period. . . . Sex becomes to them not only the 
most important thing in life— which perhaps it is — but 
the only important thing in life — which it certainly is n’t.” 
Says Rudyard Kipling (in “Puck of Pook’s Hill”), “Be- 
lieve me . . . a boy is safe from all things that really harm 
him when he is astride a pony or following a deer.” 
Exercise for Girls. Like the course of study in women’s 
colleges — which was planned in slavish imitation of that 
in colleges for men — so athletics for girls is now conducted
-P-A-G-E-284
      
    
    
   
               
   
                      
      
                                   
    254 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
too much on the lines of athletics for boys. In some schools 
they are coached by men whose aim is to bring the girls up 
to the standard of boys. We have seen girls so misdirected, 
playing the boys’ game of basket-ball because their teacher 
did not know the girls’ game. In the last, originated as it 
was in the interests of girls, one of the important points was 
“No personal contact,” thus lessening the danger of injury. 
The division of the floor into halves or thirds, and the 
limitation of the players to definite sections instead of being 
allowed to run the whole floor, also protected the girls. 
Again, the ideal of the boys’ game is to win; through any 
sacrifice of the individual to win; loyally and self-forget- 
fully to play to win. The girl is much too precious to be 
allowed to expose herself to possible injury through a mis- 
taken ideal. The ideals for her should be the development 
of self-control, of the sense of fair play, resourcefulness, gen- 
erosity to rivals, and courtesy to opponents. 
Up to puberty a girl is often able to beat the boy at his 
own games, but from fourteen on, or earlier, she should not 
compete with boys nor play as boys do. She fails to equal 
them in strength. Let us quote directly from Dr. Jesse F. 
Williams of the Physical Education Department of Teachers’ 
College, Columbia University: 
“The differences which make girls’ athletic activities necessarily 
different from those of boys are: her weight is lower, her strength 
is less, her skeletal framework is different, and the results of a fall 
or strain are more apt to be serious.” 
   Dr. Williams says gymnasium apparatus should be modi- 
fied for girls. He does not approve of hanging and swinging 
exercises for them, particularly when these call for use of 
only the arms; and he’ advises exercises that demand such 
feats as vaulting, jumping, and climbing, where both arms 
and legs come into play. Neither are high jumping and 
distance running fit sports for girls, or any work or exercise 
that involves straining, reaching, or heavy lifting. 
Lastly, girls and women cannot be at their best at all 
times, and during her rest periods no strain whatever should
-P-A-G-E-285
  
  ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 255 
be put upon a girl. This should forever exclude her from the 
match team games and their codes as played by boys. 
Special Care of Girls at this Age. Again we find physi- 
cians insisting on the need of special care for the girl, dif- 
ferentiated from care for the boy. The girl needs more 
relaxation; she needs a complete “letting go” at her times of 
lowered vitality, when not even school work should be kept 
up; but the girl should be free to lie on a couch or a ham- 
mock out-of-doors, to relax and dream. This complete rest 
day is provided in some of our best private schools for girls. 
The girl is more important than the course of study. 
Thin shoes, wet feet, chilling of any part of the body, the 
ridiculousness of the winter fur coat worn with thin silk 
stockings, of the summer furs in the dog days, should come 
under disapproval. This is a time when the organism, how- 
ever fine the health, is as sensitive as the young wood of a 
tree, and comparatively slight injury may result in serious 
harm. It is a time for watchful care of the girl—to be 
exercised without comment, without questioning the girl, 
or fostering in her unwholesome self-consciousness or intro- 
spection. 
School and Study 
Sometimes there is great avidity for learning at this age; 
sometimes school is rebelled against by the adolescent, es- 
pecially the boy, who is bored by it and wants to get out of 
it. He wants to use his hands (they are strong at this age) 
and probably elects to go into a garage. Or he may want to 
run away to sea, or to go out west, or get rich quick at some~ 
thing. Where this happens it is likely to be the fault of 
the school. Perhaps it may be due to intolerance of monotony 
and desire for change. If so, a change should be provided if 
possible; a new school, new studies, perhaps a transfer from 
day to boarding school or vice versa. 
In spring there is often a veritable epidemic of rebellion 
against school and study. The curriculum, curiously ignor- 
ing the mentality of the student, makes no provision for 
this. A complete change should now be given; a differ-  
-P-A-G-E-286
  
  256 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
ent. program of studies, out-door recitations, a reversal of 
routine. 
Work in high school has to be carefully adjusted so that 
fitting for college is not too great a strain on health and 
nerves — especially with girls. For them the agonies of 
examinations should be avoided. 
Much may be done through right correlations. Says Mr. 
Robert W. Kelso, “A physiological chart of the lungs is a 
disagreeable and meaningless object, except to a boy trying 
out for the football team, or to a girl trying to improve her 
singing.” 
Interest in history, also in drama, in mathematics, in 
science and nature study, is often strong; and word and 
language puzzles like those of the cross-word, are highly 
enjoyed. A report from one of the best private schools 
for boys informs us that they are enthusiastic over cross- 
word puzzles in Latin. A fad, perhaps, but its recurrence 
and persistence through ages—for we are told it is of 
classic origin — shows that it and its kind win perennial 
interest. 
In regard to learning to sing, here are some more remarks 
from William Byrd (see page 223). 
The exercise of singing doth strengthen all the parts of the 
brest, and doth open the pipes. 
It is delightful to Nature, and good to preserve the health of Man. 
It is the best means to procure a perfect pronunciation and to 
make a good Orator. 
Let us add to these that it provides a wholesome outlet 
for emotion, for self-expression, and that for girls it means 
something far beyond a mere accomplishment. 
Finally, parents and teachers should take to heart the 
significant answer made by one of our educators to the old 
question: ‘What is the aim of education?” This was: “It 
is the formation of desire.” Desire is the great incentive, 
the great spur, the most powerful stimulus. Form the right 
desires, and the boy or girl is safe, is inoculated against evil, 
and to its contagion rendered immune. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  
  ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 257 
Plays, Games and Recreation 
Plays and Games. ‘The plays of adolescence,” says Dr. 
Stanley Hall, ‘are socialistic, demanding the heathen virtues 
of courage, endurance, self-control, bravery, loyalty, en- 
thusiasm.”’ 
“At this age,” says George Ellsworth Johnson, ‘‘com- 
petitive games and contests are peculiarly adapted to the 
physical and mental needs of the adolescent.” He explains 
that these involve great physical activity and furnish relief 
for the high blood pressure and escape from the morbid 
tendencies and dangers of this time. They are particularly 
adapted to further the development of large muscle areas, 
to continue the development of the finer motor adjustments, 
to relate individual motor activity to a social group, and to 
develop courage, staying power, and social consciousness. 
(“Education by Plays and Games”). 
“To the boy playing football,” writes Dr. Luther Gulick, 
“the losing himself in the consciousness of the team, utterly 
subordinating his individual aims to the common purpose, 
is not a matter of self-sacrifice but of self-fulfilment — the 
coming into his birthright, the satisfying of his human 
necessity of socialization, of becoming a part of a social or 
political whole. . . . The social man, in my opinion, will 
get himself born in no other way.” 
The games commonly played are baseball, bowling, foot- 
ball, tennis, basket-ball, hockey, cricket, lacrosse, polo, 
shinney, billiards and pool. (Yes, pool is a good game, it 
is the pool room that is not always good). 
There are also the exercises of skating, skiing, swimming, 
rowing, riding, and others — all to be encouraged. 
Recreation. Of all forms of recreation, the dance — at its 
best — is the most satisfactory. It is perhaps the oldest, it 
is surely the most natural. In dancing we yield to the im- 
pulse which is common to us all — to express by movement 
of the body the thoughts and emotions of the mind. When 
these are expressed rhythmically and in accord with the 
rhythm of music we have the perfect dance.  
-P-A-G-E-288
  
258 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
“Rhythmic movement,” someone writes, ‘‘is deep-seated 
in biology because it secures most of the joy of life with least 
expense. By it Eros of old ordered chaos, and by its judi- 
cious use the human soul is cadenced to great efforts towards 
high ideals.” 
Note the marching songs and music, making easy the long 
road. Note the work-songs, to secure harmonious concerted 
action in lifting, in pulling together, in the rhythmic use of 
flail and hammer, in working at looms. All of them make 
work lighter, they bring joy to it, they are truly recreative. 
Folk dances are particularly good for girls, for in them 
the woman’s part is usually the most prominent and calls for 
the most grace and skill. Witness, for instance, the Vafna 
Vadna or Weaver Dance of those born dancers, the Swedes, 
where the girl is the vivid, flashing shuttle in the loom of 
the dance. Other folk dances worthy of mention are the 
English Morris dance, connected by scholars with Druidical 
rites; the Scotch Hornpipe, proved by Captain Cook to pro- 
mote the health of the sailors during his voyages; the Danish 
Shoemaker’s Dance, illustrating the work of the cobbler; 
and the refined and beautiful Krakoviak of the Poles. Ex- 
amples of folk dance in America are ‘Money Musk,” “Old 
Zip Coon,” and the “ Virginia Reel.” These dances are due 
to reappear, in a revulsion against some of those in vogue at 
present, and the sooner our girls begin to learn to dance 
them the sooner will their vogue return. 
Home Dramatics and Charades. These wholesome forms 
of recreation are due to come in again in some guise. Their 
coming should be welcomed and their way made plain. 
Some genius will shortly arise who will open her house to 
their installation, who will rediscover their possibilities for 
self-expression. She will be the leader in this new-old-fash- 
ion, this form of entertainment will become the rage, and 
we shall all rise up and call her blessed. 
Other Recommendations. Socials with good games to 
work off physical exuberance, yet with restraint. The Coun- 
try or “contra” dances and Sir Roger de Coverley. Puzzles 
and guessing games, charades, chorus singing and dramatic 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
    ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 259 
impersonation. Early hours to begin, and early to home 
and bed. Very simple refreshments. 
Books During the Last Years of this Period 
Boys and girls — still interested in stories of action and 
heroism, of courage and daring — are now mature enough 
to enjoy fine characterization. This is the age for Walter 
Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Fenimore Cooper, 
also all writers who portray national types accurately, such 
as Ian Hay and Barrie for the Scotch and Elsie Singmaster 
for Pennsylvania Dutch. 
They enjoy detective stories immensely; they enjoy the 
great humorists; and with the growing tendency to reflect 
they will find pleasure in the great essayists. 
Historical novels will be read, too. Of these it is 
said that “The Queen’s Quair,’’ by Maurice Hewlett, gives 
the truest picture of both Mary, Queen of Scots, and Eliza- 
beth. 
Librarians say that the love stories of Amelia E. Barr 
are deservedly popular with girl readers at this time. In 
“The Maid of Maiden Lane,” the “Bow of Orange Ribbon” 
and others, there is authentic portrayal of the period, while 
the love element is simple and natural, not passionate or 
unusual. The love stories of J. E. Buckrose, an English 
writer, should be better known for their wholesomeness and 
unaffected naturalness. One pretty American story de- 
lightful to adolescent girls and not so well known as it might 
be, is “In the Cheering-Up Business,” by Mary Catherine 
Lee. 
Since after sixteen or seventeen our boys and girls will 
probably read all their fathers and mothers do, and much 
besides, we shall say no more on this subject except to recom- 
mend two especially good collections of poetry: Matthew 
Arnold’s selections from Wordsworth, where he has sifted 
the wheat from the dross in the works of this poet; and 
“Rainbow Gold,” poems of beauty and wonder sure to 
captivate the young in heart of any age, collected by Sara 
Teasdale.
-P-A-G-E-290
260 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
  Pictures During This Period and the Last 
After ten years old children begin to understand and to 
appreciate perspective. They still prefer pictures that tell 
a story, but they enjoy landscape and seascape, pictures of 
trees, mountains, snow scenes and other striking and won- 
derful nature pictures. 
Pictures for Adolescence. With early adolescence and its 
idealism comes a love for allegory in pictures, for noble deeds, 
for the hidden teaching of parables, for pictures that inspire. 
As soon as they begin to love a picture for something be- 
sides its story, and when they are at the age that delights in 
symbols, allegory, hidden meanings, is a good time to give 
pictures — the University prints or the Perry pictures serve 
very well — for examination, and ask children to name the 
most important points. Thus it is suggested that the “point” 
of Holman Hunt’s “Christ Knocking at the Door’’ is, that 
the door opens from within. 
Other parable pictures of Holman Hunt; the allegories of 
George Watts; the mythology and romance of Sir Edward 
Leighton and Millais; the symbolism of Sargent, Puvis de 
Chavannes, and Abbey; now make strong appeal. 
Love of the tragic and emotional holds good for pictures 
as well as books at this time, and the “Huguenot Lovers” 
(Millais); ‘Christ or Diana” (Long); “The Captive An- 
dromache,” ‘‘Herakles Wrestling with Death for the Body 
of Alcestis,” ‘The Sea Gave up the Dead” (all by Leigh- 
ton); also “Love and Death” (Watts); and the fine pathos 
of “The Fighting Téméraire” (Turner) — a picture which 
also portrays the effect of motion and finely illustrates con- 
trast — are examples of pictures much enjoyed at this time. 
But in satisfying the love for pathos and tragedy remember 
to withhold the painful, repugnant and horrible — such as 
the pictures of battlefields and criminals, etc., by Verest- 
chagin and others like him. 
This brief discussion of pictures, is, like all the others, 
barely suggestive. By the time this book is in print we shall 
probably weep salt tears at remembering the pictures we’ve 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 261 
forgotten to mention. A few that just occur to us at the 
moment, sure to be liked by young people, are: “Praying 
Hands” (Durer); “The First Step” (Millet), with its un- 
couth figures beautified by tenderness; ‘“ Alice” (Chase); 
and “Aurora” (Reni). 
Many girls and boys at the “collecting’’ age make collec- 
tions of good small reproductions, such as examples of the 
best in the different schools of painting, or fairly complete 
collections of a single painter’s work, or collections of heroes, 
saints, or madonnas, or of historical pictures. 
Parent-and-Child Relation, and Traits of This Age 
“T hate all teaching that is thrust upon me!”’ was the 
characteristic response of the ancient Greek to didacticism. 
So will our boys and girls of today run a mile from bald and 
prosy moralizing and injunction. But, as the Greeks ac- 
cepted moral teaching when presented to them sugar-coated 
in the drama, so will it sink into our young people when im- 
parted indirectly. 
Instances of Indirect Teaching. Girls who are prone to 
certain follies in dress, diet, or conduct, will usually be sen- 
sitive to hints from the parent that tight shoes make the nose 
red, that boiled greens are complexion beautifiers, and sitting 
with legs crossed is a sign of ill-breeding — where discourses 
on hygiene, balanced diet, and blood circulation would not 
have the weight of a straw. In such cases the parent will 
do well also to ‘state the more important reasons, as a 
stepping-stone for the girl to rise above a foolishness which 
should be transitory. 
A lecturer to girls on dress was once requested to impress 
the need of modesty in attire. She announced a talk on 
artistic dressing, never mentioned modesty, but dwelt much 
on beauty and becomingness, good lines and correct pro- 
portions. The girls discovered for themselves that too short 
skirts detracted from height and grace, that the young boni- 
ness of chest and elbows is nothing to be ostentatious about, 
and the lesson was valued in proportion to its urge from 
within, and lack of imposition from without.

So, rather than by direct teaching, may fine principles be 
instilled through reading of biography, narrative, or poems; 
through the drama as the Greeks were given it; even through 
well-chosen movies. 
Desire for Novelty and Change. It is good for young peo- 
ple at this age to visit new scenes, meet new people, make 
new friends. It is not the time for parents to force their 
society on their offspring and insist on being with them all 
the time. After freedom and ‘change the boys and girls will 
better appreciate the foundation of trust and dependable- 
ness to be found in the home, as they would not if tied to it 
and its rulers. 
It is possible that parents may suffer from finding the in- 
fluence of others more potent than their own, from finding 
some teacher or adult friend idealized and imitated. It is 
nothing but love of novelty. The day of the parent will 
come later. Most of these passionate idealisms are super- 
ficial and transitory. They will burn themselves out, and a 
help to this is the encouragement of confidence regarding 
them. 
A not impossible instance of the attraction of novelty is 
found in the statement by William Byron Forbush that 
“boys at adolescence turn from the mother to the father.” 
Relation with the father is, perhaps, more of a novelty. In 
our own observation we have noticed that the adoption by 
parents of a new attitude provides a novelty of an alluring 
and highly stimulating kind. It means a discovery of a new 
person in the old parent, one to be friendly with rather than 
filial. This new relation involves a putting off of authority 
on the part of the parent, of meeting the youth on the equal- 
ity of friendship. Young people enjoy being self-sufficient, 
the parent-friend will throw responsibility on them, give 
them freedom, and stimulate the will. 
Thus a father, whose son wanted to leave school and go to 
work, discussed the for and against of this movement, dis- 
passionately yet interestedly, in good pal fashion, brought 
up points the boy had not seen, gave his opinion but with- 
out stressing it, saying: ‘This is only my opinion, you may 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
    ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 263 
see it differently, it is for you to decide,” — and won out. 
He might have won by use of the heavy foot of authority, 
without enlisting the boy’s will, without creating the con- 
fidence and close rapport that ensued between him and his 
son — who afterwards brought all his perplexities to his 
father. 
Similarly, when her son, in a fashion of “taking stock” in 
himself common to boys, once said to his mother: “I have 
no vices, mother, except that once in a while a swear word 
slips out. I want you to remind me when this happens. I 
want you to stop me.” “I’ll remind you, Alvin,” said his 
mother. “TI’ll press the button, but you must do the rest. 
No one can stop you but yourself and that part of the job is 
up to you to handle.” 
Encouragement of Self-Mastery. One of the traits of 
adolescence is its desire for self-mastery, self-conquest. 
Boys subject themselves to painful and difficult experiences, 
such as a group of youngsters who a few winters ago stole 
from their homes every morning to break the ice in the lake 
and plunge into it with a brave show-off of enjoyment. Boys 
have been known to slash their arms with knives, to “dare” 
one another to endure the touch of a hot branding-iron on 
their breasts — and pridefully to stand the smart without 
the quiver of a muscle. Girls, too, take pleasure in self- 
overcoming. “TI used to think up what would be the most 
disagreeable thing I could do — and then make myself do it,” 
a woman told us. Many of the victories over self are secret 
and unspectacular, achieved purely for the sake of self- 
esteem. Thus, another woman relates how she once gave 
all of her candy to the girl she most disliked in school, not 
the least through altruism, but only because she hated to do 
it and therefore insisted on subduing a self that protested 
and rebelled. 
Such victories, foolishness to the wise, are yet fine indica- 
tions of a strength and power of self-conquest that in ma- 
turity will be used in more glorious battle with the giants. 
Development of the Inhibitory Centers. The intellectual 
centers in the brain are now being formed in large numbers.  
-P-A-G-E-294
  264 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
(See page 249.) That which governs the power of voluntary 
and self-conscious inhibition is situated among these higher 
intellectual areas, a fact quite in line with the belief that fine 
conduct and fine scholarship go together. Young people 
should know that this is the age when they can form their 
own characters by judicious choice of what to cultivate and 
what to restrain in themselves. This is also the age when 
they can form the habits which are essential to business 
success, such as concentration, application, dispatch, system, 
courtesy, efficiency. They should know, too, that character 
building is something no one but themselves can do for 
them. 
They should know that the tendency to exaggerated 
speech, to intemperate excess in misuse of the mother tongue, 
calls for the help of the inhibitory centers. Girls will say a 
dish of ice cream is “awfully good,” a cup of coffee “fright- 
fully sweet,” and a new hat “adorable.’”’ We already men- 
tioned that the slang of the day is created by its adolescents, 
who find ordinary speech too trite and well-worn to express 
their young vividness of emotion. Some harmless forms for 
its expression may be sanctioned, yet we older ones wish 
that the youthful inhibitory centers might be brought into 
sufficient play to recognize the bounds of good breeding, 
good taste, and responsibility for not over-debasing the 
vernacular. Our adolescents should be brought to see that 
the practice of self-restraint in small things is dignified, 
well-bred, and will help to make them stronger men and 
women. 
Craving to Follow a Leader. One of the many contradic- 
tions that are among the traits of this age, is the desire to 
dominate, and also that to follow the leadership of someone 
they love and idealize. Such a leader for the many-sidedness 
of many boys, ought, so says an authority on boys, “‘to have 
the magnetism of Moses, the patience of Job, and the wisdom 
of Solomon.” ‘Yet, Mr. Forbush says that ‘a manly man 
with some slight athletic prowess, a willingness to answer 
questions, and patience to guide by adaptability rather than 
by domineering, can do almost anything with a group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  
  ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 265 
boys.” In England the system of a resident tutor-companion 
for the boy, who serves as teacher, comrade, and as object of 
a mild idealization, is in accord with the psychology of the 
age and succeeds better than the governess system with girls. 
Girls, too, now need to idealize someone and they (if not 
the boys) demand perfection in those they idealize. They 
will not tolerate a hero or heroine who falls short of their 
expectations and will drop them from their pedestals with 
the inexorable mercilessness of youth. This is why “crushes” 
are usually short-lived. Psychiatrists find them harmless 
when short-lived, but otherwise dangerous, as being often in- 
ordinate. Similar friendships between boys are equally com- 
mon, and equally short-lived. 
The Girl at Adolescence. “The girl meets many crises 
during her teens. She develops her powers or she wrecks 
them,” someone says. She will very likely have a best boy. 
She loves long reveries and dreams, and unless too prolonged 
they do her no harm, being natural at this age. She cherishes 
secrets, with the love of mysteries and secrets peculiar to 
innocence and virginity, which one of our authorities says 
is found the world over in the girl at this period. 
At this time, too, her heart will be filled with the desire of 
the young for consecrated service. She may think she wants 
to be a trained nurse, a missionary, or a social-service worker, 
whether or not she is fitted for these careers. She usually 
has longings to be “good,’’ and may yet be very disagreeable 
at home. 
The girl at this age is accused of wanting to ‘‘run things.” 
She criticizes her mother’s ordering of the house and is con- 
vinced she could do it much better. It may be well to let 
her try. Girls, when given whole charge and responsibility, 
unhampered by an overseer or guide, have often shown them- 
selves capable of great things. When deprived of healthful 
objective interests a girl often becomes self-centered. 
At this fostering age it is particularly good for a girl that 
this instinct should be gratified. Young animals, poultry, 
very small children, bring out in her much tenderness and 
care, and pleasure in mothering them.  
-P-A-G-E-296
    266 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
Sturm und Drang. We hear much about the storm and 
stress of the adolescent years. This is supposed to be normal 
and is taken for granted. Even Canon Hannay says: “All 
high-spirited boys run riot occasionally, whether they are 
junior army officers, lawyers’ clerks, or university under- 
graduates.’”’ Psychologists and psychiatrists tell us these 
outbreaks are the result of repressions in earlier years, that 
these forced inhibitions and repressions now boil up and 
overflow. If the parents have given children as much free- 
dom as possible from the beginning, as we have repeatedly 
counselled in the foregoing chapters, if they have recognized 
their right to their own free will and trained them to use it, 
if they have been solicitously careful not to repress whole- 
some instincts, they need not fear the riot of storm and 
stress which used to be so devastating at adolescence. 
They may look for a year or two of egotism, of crass selfish- 
ness, but they should later expect a flowering of altruism, 
generosity, courage, loyalty, and aspiration to virtue. 
Contradictory Elements in the Adolescent. Speaking of dual 
personalities, Dr. Holmes said every man was an omnibus. 
Within him were — not two, but many different persons. 
So the boy at this age (also the girl) will have the house of 
life crowded, teeming full and overflowing, with all sorts 
and conditions of boys (and girls). With little, sensitive 
ones of whom they will be ashamed; and big bullies who will 
try to overmaster them; with the generous and the selfish; 
the idlers and the hard workers; and always the finer and 
the better of the dwellers in the house, the gentle and rev- 
erent and lovers of beauty, will be pushed into the back- 
ground by the rough-and-tumble kind, the Vandals and 
scoffers. Mrs. Cabot, however, says that under the epi- 
demic of a swaggering outside the deeper character is not 
hurt, the finer things are only temporarily concealed. 
The boy in particular, awkward, physiologically ugly, is 
inwardly filled with fine ideals and aspirations; but is horri- 
bly ashamed of them and would not disclose them under 
torture, except perhaps, to his best-beloved, and then only 
haltingly. The boy is fortunate at this age who has a wise
-P-A-G-E-297
    ADOLESCENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS 267 
mother to be his confidant, who is, unknown to him, his 
best-beloved, for to her will he sing pewans on the charms 
and virtues of that ‘‘best girl” who is so likely to be one of 
many — to her he will shyly confide his aspirations and 
ideals. But talk of wisdom in the mother! The lifting of an 
eyelash at the wrong moment may spell ruin to a relation 
which is one of the most beautiful on earth. 
Teaching of Religion. Religion is not taught in the schools, 
it sometimes misses being taught in the Sunday Schools. It 
is absorbed in the home where there is true religion to be ab- 
sorbed. That religion is one of the needs of young people 
entering on manhood and womanhood is shown by the num- 
ber of conversions during these years. Yet, profound ques- 
tions on philosophy, ethics, and religion, are now asked, and 
little is accepted on authority. Our boys and girls are now 
all young Missourians demanding to be ‘“‘shown.”’ Com- 
plaint is made that though young people are caught in the net 
of the church when young, they fall away before or about 
the age of twenty. Something seems to fail to satisfy them. 
Dr. Luther Gulick holds that the reason why only seven 
per cent of the young men of the country are in the churches, 
while most members and workers are women, is that the 
qualities demanded are the feminine ones of love, rest, 
prayer, trust, desire for fortitude to endure, a sense of atone- 
ment — traits not involving ideals that most stir young 
men. 
At present, women are thinking as men, demanding manly 
virtues, impatient with the old-fashioned feminine abnega~ 
tions. At present, young women are dropping away from 
church. 
May it not be the misconceptions of Christ set up as ex- 
ample for the young that fails to draw them to follow Him 
as a leader? Our boys and girls crave strength, courage, 
virility. They seek what Charles Rann Kennedy calls: 
“The strong Son of God in the Gospels, the Man who knew 
that he was one with the Father — the keen-witted, tender, 
ironic, even humorous and divinely pitiful Jew, who knew 
himself God walking on the earth.”
-P-A-G-E-298
  268 CARE AND TRAINING OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
\“hey have held up to them “the meek Christ,” where 
meekness is interpreted as merely mildness rather than the 
combination of strength with gentleness. All through this 
gentleness something tremendous must have been evident 
in the personality of One whose disciples held him in such 
awe that often they did not dare to question him — One 
before whose simple words the soldiers sent to apprehend 
him ‘‘went backward, and fell to the ground.” Young peo- 
ple should be shown that the meekness of Christ was akin to 
the meekness of Moses, the meekest of men, the mightiest of 
his age. His was the meekness of the great statesman, 
law-giver, man of war — the combination of strength and 
gentleness — self-control. Otherwise, according to prophecy, 
it is the molly-coddles who will inherit the earth, but the 
promise of this inheritance is to the meek — the men whose 
gentleness is equal to their strength. 
The true portrait of Christ, when lifted up, will draw to 
Him our young men and women. “This real Christ,” says 
Mr. Kennedy, “‘is coming back, believe me.”’

Work we never so well with our boys and girls we are yet 
sure to make mistakes — and they grow up fine men and 
women in spite of it! Deo gratias.

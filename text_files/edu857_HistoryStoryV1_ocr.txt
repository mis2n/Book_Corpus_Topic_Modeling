PREFACE 
The idea and purpose of this book is first to group material 
and outlines for history work in Primary and Rural Schools 
in a convenient form for the teacher’s use. For this reason, 
in cases where it would be difficult for the teacher to find 
the stories or facts, they have been given in such a form that 
the teacher can adapt them to her use. Also very full out- 
lines have been given in most cases, so that the arrangement 
in story form may be easier for the teacher. 
The plan has been to give sufficient work for a fourth grade 
or for use ina Rural School, and then it is expected that the 
first grade teacher will select the easier topics and points 
for her pupils. 
The second purpose is to give suggestions for making the 
history work more vivid and real to the pupils; to show how 
children may be madeintensely interested in this subject in the 
lower grades; and how it may be connected with the homes 
and lives of the children. For this reason there are many 
suggestions for the use of action on the part of the pupils 
in the regular school work. In connection with each month 
there are also suggestions for tableaux and simple enter- 
tainments or exercises, which may be given by the pupils 
before their parents and friends; or may be used partly in 
still simpler form in regular school work. It has been the 
intention that each exercise and entertainment should have 
a meaning, be connected with the story work of the month, 
and teach something, as well as be of interest. 
Of course the teacher would make selections from these 
suggestions and would use only a few of them in any one year. 
In the third place this book places emphasis on the value 
of the old celebrations of festivals. It suggests adaptations 
of these festivals and pageant ideas to present conditions. 
The joyfulness, the childlike simplicity of these ancient 
festivals is worthy of preservation. These festivals brought 
z 3

the people of a community together and taught them co- 
operation and valuable civic virtues. The revival of some 
of these old-time celebrations or the better use of our Ameri- 
can holidays may do the same for our country towns. In 
the cities the adaptations of historic ideas in the celebrations 
may help greatly in bringing the foreign element into touch 
with conditions in the United States. 
While this material is planned especially for Primary Grades, 
it may be used for general lessons in Rural Schools. There 
is also much in the suggestions for holiday celebration which 
is suited for upper grades and also for use outside of school. 
Practically all the suggestions given in regard to regular 
school-room work have been tried in connection with the work 
in history at the State Normal School, Fitchburg, Mass. 
Thus this is the result of the method of teaching history to 
children at that institution. The dances, drills, and exer- 
cises have.been easily taught to the children, and they have 
been greatly interested in this work. 
All illustrations are of children or Normal School pupils 
connected with the Fitchburg Normal School, and engaged 
in illustrating the character of this work. Many of the cos- 
tumes and other articles needed for the work described were 
made by the members of the class of 1914 and used by them, 
in connection with the telling of stories, etc., to children, 
during their first year at the Normal School as a part of 
their preparation for teaching. 
This work would have been impossible had it not been for 
the kind co-operation of the principal, supervisors, and teach- 
ers connected with the Fitchburg Normal School, and the 
interest and helpfulness of the pupils. Besides the class of 
1914, some of the members of the Advanced Class of 1913 
helped in giving the exercises which are described for October; 
a few members of other classes also helped in making articles 
needed and in training the children for some of the other 
exercises which have been given at the school. It is of 
course impossible to name all who have helped in this way. 
The name of Mary H. Arthur should be mentioned, however, 
because she planned the movements for the Harvest Drill 
and also for the Flag Drill; also that of Edith P. Ballard,
-P-A-G-E-8
PREFACE 5 
as partly planning the statements to be given by the children 
in the exercise concerning the Harvest Festivals in other 
countries- and the dialogue for the making—efthe first 
American Flag. 
Special thanks are due to Willis B. Anthony of the Fitch- 
burg Normal School for his interest and valuable help in 
obtaining illustrations for the book. 
Many of the songs suggested as appropriate for the differ- 
ent months and entertainments were selected from among 
those taught to pupils of the lower grades connected with 
the training department of the Fitchburg Normal School. 
Miss Elizabeth D. Perry, who has charge of the musical 
department at this Normal School, has kindly revised these 
lists of suggested songs.

INTRODUCTION 
DIscUSSION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF STORY-TELLING AND 
Work 1N History FOR THE LOWER GRADES 
To train pupils to be valuable members of a community, 
to inculcate thoughts, feelings, and purposes, which will 
make for good citizenship is the work of the schools. While 
this is the general object of all work in the schools, story- 
telling and work in history tends directly to the accomplish- 
ment of this end. 
The lower grades have a distinct part in this training for 
good citizenship. Small children are more imaginative, 
more enthusiastic, more easily pleased and influenced than 
older pupils. Much can be done with them, if carefully 
attempted. No definite work in civics is suggested for the 
lower grades, but careful consideration of the influence 
of stories upon character-building, indirect teaching of the 
value of patriotism and the civic virtues, and the inculcation 
of admiration for the heroes of our country is really the teach- 
ing of civics. All work in this book has been chosen and 
planned with this object in mind. 
The methods which are chiefly used to influence small chil- 
dren in training them to be good citizens are story-telling, de- 
vices to arouse their interest, and simple celebrations of 
holidays. Realizing how much depends upon interest in 
this work, many things are considered history in the lower 
grades, which would not be generally classed under that head. 
The importance of good story-telling in the lower grades 
can hardly be overestimated. Even in regard to historical 
knowledge, a person who has not made the attempt is unable 
to realize how much little children can understand and re- 
member, if the facts are presented to them in the form of 
an interesting story. The children gain, however, in many 
other and still more important ways than in knowledge. 
The stories teach them to be sympathetic and broad-minded; 
7
-P-A-G-E-11
8 INTRODUCTION 
to appreciate differences of life and customs; and they instill 
admiration for what is true and noble. It is one of the great 
principles of teaching that this admiration and desire to emu- 
late others must come first in the development of character. 
The celebrations and stories teach to foreign and native- 
born children patriotism and the meaning of their country. 
The selection of appropriate stories to be told to children 
is very important. First of all, the interests of the children 
must be considered. A subject which cannot be made in- 
teresting to children should not be presented in lower 
grades. Whether the story is of interest to them or not, 
however, depends toa great extent upon the way in which 
it is told. Next, stories should never be chosen unless they 
will be of some permanent value along the lines already 
mentioned of preparing the children for their future life 
as citizens of our country. The third point to be con- 
sidered is the historical or literary value of the story. 
Before telling the story, the facts must be clearly and 
definitely in the teacher’s mind, so that there will be no hesi- 
tation when talking to the children. Then the story-teller 
can give her attention to her audience and the effect of the 
story upon them. The important points of the story itself 
should be carefully chosen, arranged in the right order, 
and adapted to the age of the children. 
The principles of good story-telling are the same as for a 
good orator or public speaker. Anyone who is speaking must 
first of all obtain the attention of his audience. In telling 
a story, therefore, the teacher must introduce the story in an 
interesting manner; she must begin by appealing in some way 
to the interests of the children of her grade, she must con- 
nect the new which she is about to tell them with something 
with which they are already familiar, and arouse their curi- 
osity in regard to the story. There must be variety in the 
methods of introducing stories. What will do for one story 
or one group of children will not do in other cases. In general, 
we may say that the method of introducing the story should 
be suited to the subject, the audience, and the story-teller. 
A good story-teller is interested in her subject, of course, 
and in her audience. Enthusiasm, sympathy with the  
-P-A-G-E-12
INTRODUCTION 9 
characters in the story and with the children is shown in 
manner, voice, and expression. The voice and expression 
change for different parts of the story. She talks with the 
children and takes their point of view. 
To be able to see the dramatic points in a story is another 
- one of the chief elements in effective story-telling. Having 
selected the dramatic points, the teacher must be able to 
present them by means of vivid descriptions and the use of 
comparison and contrast, in such a manner that the children 
will be able to see pictures of the various important scenes 
connected with the lives of the characters in the stories. 
The important points in each story must be emphasized 
in different ways. Change of tone is sometimes a very 
effective means of emphasis. In telling history stories, the 
teacher should seek also to bring clearly before the pupils 
the historical facts. 
Simple language should be used with small children, but 
words which are new to the children must be introduced in 
order to enlarge their historical vocabulary through this story 
work and thus better prepare them for the work in the higher 
grades. All new words and other points of difficulty should, 
however, be clearly and carefully explained. The story itself 
must be told clearly and definitely in order that the pupils 
may be able to remember and reproduce it. 
In telling stories to children all points, as far as possible, 
should be connected with their own lives and previous knowl- 
edge. Toa great extent the use of comparison will bring out 
the resemblances and differences between the things the 
teacher is explaining and the children’s own experience. 
If the story-teller wishes the children to understand anything 
concerning time, distance, or size, this method of compari- 
son must always be used. 
It is always easy to tell whether children are interested in a 
story which is being told to them or not. If the teacher sees 
that they are not interested, she must be able to vary her 
method of presenting the subject. She must endeavor 
to arouse the children’s curiosity. Sometimes she may be 
able to do this by asking them to imagine what would happen 
next in the story. Sometimes a lower tone of voice, or a
-P-A-G-E-13
10 INTRODUCTION 
question about something in the story, or pausing a moment 
in the talk will effect the same result. By all means monot- 
ony must. be avoided in telling the stories. 
‘Thesunity of the story should be considered. By this 
is meant that the teacher should have some special purpose 
in mind in telling that particular story, and then she should 
try to bring out, through the method of telling the story, 
the central thought which she wishes to enmphasize. 
In some stories or lessons the pupils may be able to reason 
out for themselves certain facts. They should be encouraged 
to do this whenever possible. Questions should be used 
sometimes, also, to develop the children’s imagination and 
to see if they understand the difficult parts of the story. 
The teacher should be perfectly natural in her manner of 
telling the stories. She should not copy anyone, but should 
know her own points of strength and make the most of them. 
A good story-teller needs no outside devices to hold the chil- 
dren’s attention, beyond the power of her own personality 
as shown in voice, expression, and dramatic description. 
The value of the kind of devices which are suggested in this 
book is either to make a stronger impression through the 
power of suggestion and proper atmosphere, or to add more 
life and action to the reproduction work after the story has 
- been told. Of course good pictures and real historic articles 
are always of value. 
In conclusion, the teacher should review or sum up a few 
of the most important points of the story, or else in some cases 
she should lead up to a most interesting climax and leave 
all the review or summary until the next lesson. 
After the story or talk has been given to the children, they 
should be allowed to give expression in as many ways as 
possible to the new ideas and impressions which they have 
teceived. This will make the story more impressive, because 
of the greater interest which isaroused. In the first place the 
children should reproduce the stories in their own words. For 
this review many little devices should be used to add variety 
and interest. The ones given in this book are merely sugges- 
tive. Alive teacher will always be able to plan variations and 
think of methods best suited to the conditions of the school,
-P-A-G-E-14
INTRODUCTION 11 
The child should, also, be allowed to express his thought 
of the work through some form of action. This action in- 
cludes not only simple dramatic action, but also all other 
forms, as drills, dances, games, and tableaux. Through these 
the child may express his ideas in somewhat the same way 
in which primitive man and races in their early development 
expressed theirs. These methods of expression through 
action are natural to children; work of thiskind brings them 
into closer touch with the characters in the story or with 
the subject they are studying, makes them more sympathetic, 
and develops the imagination. For this reason many exer- 
cises and different forms of action have been suggested in 
this book. This should be the child’s expression of his emo- 
tions in action; it should be simple, spontaneous, and full 
of joy. Even for exercises which are to be given before 
parents or others, there should be no more rehearsing than 
is absolutely necessary and the rehearsing should be taken 
in such a way that it is play and self-expression on the part of 
the child. If this manner of expression is used in the school- 
room in connection with the regular work, and the children 
become accustomed to it, when the teacher wishes special 
exercises, she will find very little rehearsing necessary. She 
will, also, find that the children enjoy both rehearsing and 
giving the exercises. The drills, dances, etc., demand action 
together and physical self-control and through them the 
pupils gain important beginnings in the training for good 
citizenship, because good citizenship depends upon com- 
munity action, obedience, and self-control. 
The central thought of all history is unity and progress. 
We would allow the children to celebrate in simple form the 
ancient festivals, as well as our present holidays. We would 
explain to them how long ago the people used to celebrate 
these festivals, some of which are still celebrated. Tell them 
how people expressed their joy through these ancient festivals, 
show them, if possible, a better method of expression to-day, 
and so gradually and unconsciously teach them to see the 
underlying unity of all peoples, the good in all, and prepare 
them in their later study to realize the advancement through 
the ages of the human race.

THE HOME AND THE VALUE OF WORK 
Object of the Lessons in September 
To show the importance of the home. 
To show the value of all work well done. 
To bring out the idea illustrated in the poem, “Each and All,” 
by Ralph Waldo Emerson — “All are needed by each one.” 
To teach the special need of the work of the farmer. 
The lessons and stories suggested for this month make a 
good connection between the school and the home life of the 
child. The basis for the work is the holiday, “Labor Day,” 
which comes just before the child enters school. The topics 
this month are to be used as an introduction to the regular 
history work.

(Told by the teacher.) 
(Idea of the story adapted from “A Girl of the Limber- 
lost” by Gene Stratton Porter. Stories of other animals mak- 
ing their homes may be used.) 
Tam going to tell you the story of a little neighbor of mine. 
His name is Mr. R. Redbreast; and as he has many cousins and 
other relatives, perhaps some of them may live near you. _ I saw 
him first one beautiful day last spring; it was very early in the 
morning and warm and sunny. He wore a dark suit of clothes, 
except that he had on a red vest and necktie. I think he must 
be very fond of red, for I always see him dressed just the same. 
When I first saw him I thought he must be trying to find a house 
to hire; because he went from place to place, looking all around 
where no families were living at that time. 
However, I soon found out that Mr, R. Redbreast was going 
19
-P-A-G-E-19
20 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
to build himself a home instead of hiring one. I also saw that 
he was a carpenter and mason, and was going to build his own 
home. He brought the building material and went to work at 
once. He worked very hard and soon the home was nearly 
finished. It was small, but very cozy and neat. One day he 
brought Mrs. Redbreast to see if she liked the home. They talked together for a long time, probably about the furniture 
which they would need. The next day they moved into their 
new home, and they have lived there ever since. They have 
three children, and the father and mother are very fond of them. All through the summer Mr. Redbreast had to go to his work every morning, but I noticed that he always brought some- 
thing home for the children at night. While he was away, 
Mrs. Redbreast took care of the home and the children. 
Sometimes, after the children grew old enough, the father 
or mother would take them out with them for a little walk at night. Mr. Redbreast and his wife are very fond of music, and 
Mr. Redbreast especially is a very fine singer. He always sings 
in the morning and after he returns from his work at night; 
and as he lives very near me, I enjoy the music as well as his 
family does. I have been afraid lately, however, that Mr. and 
Mrs. Redbreast were not entirely satisfied with their home, and 
were thinking of moving. I shall miss them very much if they 
do leave.

3 Little helpers in the home. 
What are some things that children can do about the home? 
a Boys: Help to keep the barn, shed, garage, or piazzas 
clean; help take care of flowers and lawn; chop wood 
or bring it in; do errands, etc. 
b Girls: Wash dishes; make beds; keep their own rooms 
neat; dust; sew; set table, etc. 
Ask the children if they have any work that they do in the 
home if they have any special articles to use in helping in or about 
the home, as, for instance, a small broom or hoe, a duster or 
something that belongs to them individually. 
Put the title, ‘‘Little Helpers in the Home,” on the black- 
board and then under it write the names of all the children whose 
mothers say that they have any regular work to do in the home. 
Put the name of the article used in the work or the work done 
under the child’s name. 
Have a workers’ day and allow the children, if they wish, 
to bring their tools or anything they use in their work at home to 
school. Have them draw pictures of their work, tools, etc. 
Have a workers’ procession and have the children represent 
different occupations or kinds of work.

I The Importance of Work 
(Use as a lesson to show “All are needed by each one.”’) 
If many, many people did not work, we should have no 
homes, food, clothing and all the other things that we need. 
Just think for a moment and see how many people you can name 
who have been working for us. Some one has to print the books 
that we read; some people have to make the desks and seats 
that we use; others have to make the pencils and paper that 
we want when we write. Then the postman brings us letters, 
etc. (Give other examples and let the children name as many 
as possible of the persons who help them.) In the stores, on 
farms, everywhere people are working to get us the things we 
need and want. We cannot guess how many people worked 
just to get us the things we had for our breakfast this morning. 
Name all you can think of who have helped you to-day. 
(Teacher put the list on the blackboard.) 
II Labor Day 
(Explanation by the teacher of the meaning of Labor Day.) 
In this country we have a day in September which we name 
and have for a holiday in honor of work. It is called Labor Day 
and is just the day before you begin to come to school. 
In some of the large cities they have great processions on 
this day; the processions are to show the different occupations 
and their importance, and the men who work at these occupa- 
tions march through the streets. But in most places they stop 
work and have picnics and games on Labor Day. In some of 
the other countries they celebrate Labor Day on May 1, but 
in this country it is the first Monday in September. This is 
one of our youngest holidays and probably it is not the one you 
children know most about. But all our holidays have some
-P-A-G-E-22
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 23 
meaning and this one is to show us the value and need of all 
work that is well done. 
III Little Workers 
The home belongs to all the family, and so it is well for all 
the members of the family to help to keep it clean and make it 
better. There are many things which children can do about 
the home which will not hurt them, but on the contrary will 
teach them many things they will need to know when they are 
older. In this way they can help their fathers and mothers. 
But little children are not very strong; they should be grow- 
ing all the time larger and stronger. In order to become 
strong and healthy, they must not do very hard work or lift 
heavy articles; they must run and play; and they must be 
outdoors in the fresh air as much as possible. Our country 
wants strong, healthy men and women. If little children 
are shut up in close factories working all day long, they will 
not become strong men and women, able to work for their 
country. 
You are all little citizens now of our great country; but by 
and by you will be older citizens and will have to decide what 
you think will make our country better and stronger. Our 
country wants not only strong men and women, but also those 
who can think clearly, understand the laws, and decide ques- 
tions wisely for the best good of all. For this reason, little boys 
and girls are obliged to go to school — that they may learn to be 
good little citizens now and good big citizens by and by. 
In order that we may have these good citizens in our coun- 
try, laws have been made which say that children must go to 
school until they are fourteen years of age. There are also laws 
forbidding little children working in factories and mills. After 
children are fourteen years old, they are not allowed to do cer- 
tain kinds of work and there are laws also saying how many hours 
a day they may work. 
However, in some of our large cities, the parents are very 
poor and they need the money the children can earn. So some- 
times poor little children are found still working hard all day 
long and having no happy times such as you have. Many good 
men and women are trying to help these little children. Some 
of these women go to work in the factories to see if little chil- 
dren are working there when they should be in school. Other 
men and women have built playgrounds in the crowded parts 
of the cities so that the poor children may have a chance to play. 
Perhaps your teacher will tell you some stories of some of these

little workers, and also of some of the men and women who have 
helped them. 
(Show pictures of factories; of little child workers; of 
men and women who are working for children; of playgrounds. 
The material given above should be simplified still more and 
adapted to the children. It should not be given entirely in the

IV Special Need of the Work of the Farmer 
1 The Story of the Little Farmer Boy of Long Ago. 
(To be told by the teacher.) 
a Introduction. 
Perhaps some of the children live on farms. If so, connect 
the subject with their lives. If not, some of them may have 
visited farms or stayed on farms during the summer. Allow 
the children to tell what they know about life on a farm. 
6 Hints for the Study. 
If any of you have ever visited at a farmhouse, I am sure 
you must have had a lovely time, because there are so many 
interesting things for little boys and girls to do and see on a 
farm. How many of you would like to play visiting a farm 
to-day? One of you may be a real farmer boy and wear this 
straw hat and hold this sheaf of rye for us. 
c The Story. 
A long, long time ago there were not nearly as many people 
living in this country as there are to-day. There were at this 
time no cities or large towns, no railroads or electric cars, and 
no good roads. A large part of the country was covered with 
great forests in which were many wild animals. 
Every little boy and girl lived on a farm at this time. The 
farmhouses differed from those you may have visited. Many of 
them were very small; at first some had only one room and were 
like cabins; but soon the farmer would build on another room 
or perhaps build another larger home for his family. Some- 
times a very large chimney was built first, and the rooms and 
sometimes small hallways were built around it in such a manner
-P-A-G-E-24
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 25 
that, if the doors were left open, the children could run around 
the chimney and have a great game of blind man’s buff. 
In these old farmhouses, the kitchen was the most im- 
portant room. In the kitchen there was an immense fireplace; 
it was so large that all the family could gather around it; there 
were seats built in on the sides where the children often sat. 
In the winter evenings the family had good times about the fire. 
What do you suppose they did sometimes when the snow was 
falling, or the wind blowing fiercely outside? For one thing, 
they told stories. Then the children in the autumn had gathered 
out in the woods lots of nuts and they would crack these on the 
hearth; they would also go down cellar and get apples to roast 
over the fire; perhaps they would pop corn also. Sometimes 
the only light in the room would come from the fire in the fire- 
place; or the mother and children might have made some candles 
and a candle would be lighted. This was very different from 
the gas and electric lights that most of us have in our homes. 
Sitting by the fire, listening to the stories and eating the 
good things, I think the little children became sleepy before 
very long and scampered off to bed. They had to hurry because 
it was very cold in the other rooms. The houses were not built 
very tight and snug in those days and sometimes, while the 
little children were sleeping, a funny, daring snowflake would 
come right in through the cracks and then another and an- 
other, and they might lodge on the bed. 
In the morning, if you were a little farmer boy, you would 
probably go out to the barn with your father. Every day you 
would help to feed the animals. Perhaps you would have some 
chickens or other small animals that belonged to you and you 
would take care of them. Then you would hunt for eggs, and 
perhaps find a nest with a number of eggs in it hidden away in the 
hay. In the morning and at night you might help your father 
milk the cows, and, if you were large enough, you would carry the 
pails of milk into the house. In any case you would want to 
drink some of the new milk. 
This little farmer boy of long ago had very little money; 
but he had plenty of good food to eat. His father raised wheat 
and other grain; this was made into flour or meal, and his mother 
cooked bread and other things in a great brick oven at one side 
of the fireplace in the kitchen. A fire would be made in this 
oven; when the oven was hot, the mother would brush the fire 
out and the bricks would remain hot for a long time. Then the 
articles to be baked would be placed in the oven. Some people 
say that these old brick ovens used to bake much better than
-P-A-G-E-25
  ‘HE LITTLE FARMER BOY T
-P-A-G-E-26
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 27 
our stoves do to-day. Of course the father raised vegetables 
also, and the boy helped plant the seeds and weed the garden. 
Near the farm were many wild berries and fruits and it was fun 
to go out and gather them. 
Long ago at the time I am telling you about, not only did 
the animals in the barn give the farmer’s family food, but there 
were many wild animals in the woods which were good for food. 
So the father went out hunting and brought home wild turkeys, 
deer, and many other animals. Every time the little boy saw 
his father getting ready to go hunting, he wished to go too, but 
his father said for a long time that he was too small and there 
were so many wild, fierce animals in the woods that he was 
afraid he would get hurt. One day, however, the farmer boy’s 
father said he was getting to be such a big boy that he might 
go with him. How proud the little boy felt then! But there 
came a day, some time after this, when. he felt prouder still. 
This was when he carried home to his mother the first animal 
he had shot himself. His mother was also very proud of her 
little son. She put the turkey, which he had shot, over the 
fire on what is called a spit. The boy watched it very carefully 
and kept turning it around until it was done brown on every 
side. Then they had a great feast. 
The farmer boy has many good times. The farm is a very 
busy place in the summer and our little boy has to get up early 
in the morning and do more to help his father than he does in 
the winter. But his work is out in the open air and is not very 
hard; so he grows strong and also learns many interesting 
things about plants and animals as he works. Often he goes 
fishing also and all the boys enjoy that. In the fall, when the 
corn is gathered, they sometimes have a party in the great barn 
and husk it. (Explain to the children about husking.) This 
was called a husking-bee. After they had husked the corn they 
would have supper and a dance in the big barn. In-the winter 
there is not so much to do on a farm and the children have plenty 
of time to coast and slide. . 
If you were living on a farm long ago, however, and wanted 
a sled or some other plaything, you would be obliged to make 
it yourself or get your father to make it for you, because there 
would be no stores near you to which you could go and buy what 
you wanted. Your father and mother would have to make 
everything the family needed or else send across the ocean to 
England for it. And how many things the farmer boy’s father 
knew how to make then and how interesting it was to watch him. 
He would go out into the forest and chop down trees. Then
-P-A-G-E-27
28 HISTORY IN STORY. SONG AND ACTION 
he would bring home great logs for the fireplace. Some of the 
wood he would take and make into rude tables and stools for the house. Sometimes in the evening he would show his little 
boy how to make tacks and nails. Again at another time he 
would bring home a beaver which he had shot and would make 
the boy a hat from it. One of the most interesting times in the whole year was when a man came to visit at the farmhouse. Perhaps he stayed a whole week and he worked hard all the time. What do you suppose he was doing? He was making enough shoes to last the whole family for a year, because, as I told you before, there were no stores where they could buy these things. 
Perhaps we will hear at our next lesson how the little farmer boy’s clothes used to be made. 
(The teacher should show pictures of old farmhouses, fire- places, the furniture in the farmhouse, the farm tools that used to be used in this country. Have the children help collect as many pictures of farms and farm life as possible, and put them on the bulletin board. Use pictures illustrating the work of the farmer and explain them. Pictures of farms and farm life to-day may be used also and compared with former times.) If the teacher wishes to continue the story of the farmer boy, the next story may be the making of homespun clothing at the farm. 
Interesting facts for this story may be found in “A Suit of Homespun,” by Luthera Whitney, Wide “wake, November, 
1882. 
Then a visit may be taken to a modern farm and this may be compared with the farms and farm life of long ago. 
2 The importance of the farm to-day. 
(A lesson.) 
Have the children name the chief articles of food that they use to-day: as bread, butter, milk, eggs, meat, vegetables. Write the list on the blackboard. Lead the children to trace back the different articles of food, see from what they are made or where they are obtained. and in how many cases we are de- pendent upon the farmer for them. Put farm after the name of the food if it may be traced back to that source. Show the children that if we had no farms or farmers in this country we should not be able to get bread to eat; that the most healthy and necessary foods come from the farms. Above the list of foods place the word country; then place city on the blackboard and under that make a list of articles which are made in the city, as shoes, hats, etc. Ask the children to imagine that they are
-P-A-G-E-28
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 29 
shipwrecked or left without anything, and to say what would be 
the first thing they would need. If a man were on a desert 
island and had all around him gold, silver, and diamonds, but 
not a mouthful of food, he would give all his gold, etc., for one 
piece of bread. With illustrations and questions like these, 
lead the children to see that the first necessity of man is food. 
From this lesson, draw the general conclusion, that, al- 
though we do not obtain all our food in just the same way that 
the little boy on the farm did so long ago, still we are obliged 
to depend upon the farmer for most of it.

LABOR DAY 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
For several reasons it is well to emphasize our holidays, state 
or national, by special exercises, easily arranged and presented. 
It gives the teacher an incentive for something in the way of 
original work; furnishes a natural opportunity to invite in the 
parents; makes the ideas associated with the day real to the 
pupils; gives a pleasing variety and zest to the general work of the 
school. The following simple exercise is suggested as suitable 
for Labor Day. Of course no outline of this kind is supposed to 
be followed blindly.

2 Quotations in regard to labor, given by the children. 
Round swings the hammer of industry, quickly the sharp chisel 
rings, : 
And the heart of the toiler has throbbings that stir not the bosom 
of kings — : 
He the true ruler and conqueror, he the true king of his race, 
Who nerveth his arm for life’s combat, and looks the strong world 
in the face— Denis Florence MacCarthy 
With what content and merriment 
Their days are spent, whose minds are bent 
To follow the useful plough! — Old Song 
No man is born into the world whose work 
Is not born with him. There is always work, 
And tools to work withal, for those who will; 
And blessed are the horny hands of toil. — Lowell 
By the work one knows the worker. 
— J. De La Fontaine (The Hornets and the Bees, Fable 21) 
II A Labor Day: Procession 
The pupils should be instructed to prepare three banners; one 
bearing the words ‘“‘Labor Day”; the other two with some 
motto in regard to labor, as “‘All true work is sacred”’ or “Labor 
is health,” etc. These banners should be properly arranged in 
the procession. Besides those who carry the banners, select 
small boys to represent different trades and professions, as painter, 
carpenter, farmer, mason (doctor, minister and lawyer, if desired). 
All who take part in the procession must be dressed in character 
and carry some tool or article which will at once suggest the trade 
er profession which the boy represents. Following the same 
idea, if the teacher desires, it would be easy to add small girls 
to this procession, providing suitable costumes and implements 
to indicate work in which women are largely engaged. This 
procession may simply march across the stage, or one of the boys 
bearing a banner may step from the ranks and give a quotation 
in regard to labor, or an older person may recite a poem while 
the procession stands on the platform. In any case the boys and 
girls should. be given definite instruction in showing the imple- 
ments which they are carrying. If the teacher is willing to take 
a little extra trouble, it would be quite possible to select a boy 
who has some natural ability in this direction, and instruct him
-P-A-G-E-31
32 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
so that he could step from the ranks and make the audience a ‘‘Labor 
Day” speech in “‘pantomime.”’ It would be worth the trouble. 
Poems from which selections may be given: 
Labor is Worship, by Mrs. F. S. Osgood. 
The Heritage, by James Russell Lowell.

IIT The Little Mothers 
When the curtain rises for this scene, a little girl, dressed as an 
Indian woman, is seen standing near a tree from one branch of 
which a papoose is hanging. Three other little girls, one dressed 
like an American woman, one in the costume of a Japanese, and 
the other in that of a Swiss woman, are seen grouped on the stage. 
(Of course other nations can be substituted or added if desired.) 
All these girls appear as tending their babies, each after the manner 
of her own nation. Large dolls, properly dressed, make very good. 
substitutes for babies for their use. 
The scene should close with an Indian and an American lullaby. 
Perhaps others will be possible and desirble. 
Some lullabies. which might be used: 
The Dustman, by Mary Vaughan. — (Brahms.) 
Cradle Song. — Brahms. 
Lullaby, “Sleep, baby, sleep. Thy father guards the sheep.” 
Song of the Mother, by Tennyson. 
Cradle Song, by Tennyson. 
Indian Lullaby. 
If others’ are desired, consult “Lullabies of the Different Na- 
tions.’ 
IV Litile Helpers in the Home 
(The Days of the Week in Pantomime.) 
The stage is arranged for a home scene, with some chairs, 
benches, tables, etc. 
Sunday A little girl, dressed in her best clothes, with her hat 
and coat on and carrying a prayer book or Bible, comes in. 
She looks in a mirror, fixes her hat, etc. She then goes to 
a little boy who is seated at a table in the center of the room 
reading. The little boy rises, takes a tall hat and cane, offers 
his arm to the little girl, and they leave the stage together. 
Monday A little girl brings in a tub and basket of clothes. 
She places the tub on a bench, pretends to wash the clothes 
puts them in a basket, takes clothes-pins, and goes from the 
stage.
-P-A-G-E-32
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 33, 
Tuesday In the same way the articles needed for ironing day 
are brought onto the stage, and the child gives the appropriate 
action. 
Wednesday (Mending Day) For this scene the little girl 
brings her work basket and mending; she seats herself by 
the table and begins her work. 
The appropriate actions for Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
are also performed according to the same general plan. The 
little girl representing Friday is dressed in a pretty sweeping cap 
and apron, and tries to sweep with a broom which is larger than 
she is. 
During the time of this pantomime on the stage, a chorus of 
children below sings “Housekeeping Songs.” 
(The songs are found in the St. Nicholas for 1888.) 
V “When I am a Man!” 
Boys are grouped on the stage, with different implements 
about them, and are pretending to carry on different occupations 
such as their fathers are engaged in. The teacher can easily 
arrange for the ones she wishes to illustrate. She can also have 
a short dialogue, in which the boys tell about their fathers and 
what THEY are going to do when they are men, if she desires. 
VI The Lay of the Laborer, by Thomas Hood 
Seven boys march upon the stage, each carrying the appro- 
priate implement to correspond to the tools mentioned in the 
poem, as the first a spade, etc. They give two stanzas of the 
poem in the following manner, showing their tools as they speak: 
First Boy <A spade! 
Second boy A rake! 
Third boy A hoe! 
Fourth boy A pickaxe, or a bill. 
Fifth boy A hook to reap! 
Sixth boy Ora scythe to mow! 
Seventh boy A flail, or what ye will. 
All together 
And here’s a ready hand 
To ply the needful tool, 
And skilled enough, by lessons rough 
In Labor’s rugged school. A

34 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The second stanza may be all given by one of the boys; or 
the first boy may give the first line which is appropriate for him 
and the second also because it is not especially appropriate for 
any of the tools carried by the boys; then in the same way the 
sixth boy should give the next two lines, and the fifth boy give 
the next two. The last two lines may be given by all. 
The seven boys repeat what each one gave first. 
All together 
Whatever the tool to ply, 
Here is a willing drudge, 
With muscle and limb, and woe to him 
Who does their pay begrudge! 
Song: “The Harvesters,” by Louis C. Elson. Wide Awake, 
September, 1881; or ‘Comin’ Thro’ the Rye.” 
VII Farmer and Housewife Dance 
Equal number of little girls and boys take part in this dance; 
there should be four or more of each. The little girls are dressed 
in everyday thin dresses, caps and aprons. The little boys are 
dressed to suggest farmers; they may wear overalls and if possi- 
ble broad-brimmed straw hats. Wide-brimmed hats may be 
made of construction paper and painted to resemble straw, if 
real straw hats cannot be obtained. 
A little boy and little girl enter, one from each side, dance 
to the front, and face each other. The boy takes off his hat, 
and bowing, says: “Little housewife, will you dance with me 
when your work is done?” 
The little girl bows and answers: “Yes, I will dance with you, 
at set of sun, when my work is done.” Then they go to the back 
of the stage, one on the extreme right and the other on the extreme 
left. Another little boy and girl now enter, and do the same as 
the first two, and so on, until all who are to take part in the dance 
have entered. 
The little boys should be standing at the back in a line on one 
side of the stage; and the little girls on the other, with some space 
between them. The boys and girls together dance to the front 
and then back to the rear again; they dance four steps at a time, 
then stop for ten counts. At each stop the boys make motions 
as if digging up a furrow in the ground, and the girls as if washing 
and then hanging out clothes. This may be repeated with the 
same motions. 
The boys and girls next dance forward and back again, only
-P-A-G-E-34
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 35 
this time the motions for the boys are as if sowing seeds; and 
for the girls as if sweeping. 
The third dance to the front and then to the rear of the stage; 
ihe boys make motions as if mowing and the girls as if using a dust 
cloth. 
(Other motions may be added if desired.) 
After each change in the movements, the couple nearest each 
other turn, take hold of hands, and dance down the center of the 
stage to the front. They then separate, each dances around the 
stage back to his or her former position at the rear. Then the 
next couple does the same and so on until all have danced around 
with their partners. This may be repeated, or when the couple 
reaches the front of the stage they may go through some pretty 
movements together — dance away from each other, return, 
bow and courtesy to each other, etc. The last time, instead of 
going to their former positions in the rear, they dance from the 
stage, going off the same side from which they entered. Or in- 
stead of this method of leaving the stage, the couples may dance 
down the center of the stage, one following immediately after 
the other; when the first couple reaches the front they turn to the 
right and dance around and off through the right wing. The 
next couple turns to the left and leaves through the left wing. 
The others alternate in the same way. 
VIII “The Joy of the Worker” 
(Tableau.) 
A boy, wearing a large apron and in poor clothes, is seated 
in a poor kitchen. He has a cloth in one hand and a very large 
pan which he has just been cleaning and which is very bright, 
in the other. Pots, pans and kettles are around him on the 
floor. He is looking joyfully at the bright pan which he holds.

Baskets were made of grasses, roots, etc., and were 
used for many purposes. Sometimes they were used
-P-A-G-E-42
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 43 
for cooking pots and dishes. The grasses were 
dyed different colors and the patterns, which were 
woven into the baskets, all had a meaning. The 
Indians often carried large baskets on their backs. 
About this basket, the following legend is told: 
Long ago a hero was carried by a flying monster to 
a very high ledge. He killed the monster, but was 
unable to think of any way by which he could get 
down from the ledge. Suddenly he saw, far below 
him, the “Bat Woman” with her carrying basket 
on her back, and asked her to help him. She said, 
if he would get into her basket and shut his eyes, 
she could carry him down easily, as she had 
often carried a deer on her back in the basket. 
However, when the hero saw how slight the strings 
were which held the basket in place, he was fright- 
ened and would not descend until he had tried 
heavy stones in the basket first. After this, he 
rode down safely on the woman’s back. 
c Feeling toward the bear—The most powerful of all 
animals. The bear must never be killed, unless he 
has killed a Navajo Indian; in that case they havea 
strange ceremony in front of the bear’s cave; they 
praise the bear as the greatest of all beasts and say: 
“T beg your pardon, and hope you will bear no re- 
sentment against me, but I have come to kill you.” 
Then they kill the bear, but they never dare to hurt 
a bear in any other way except this.

b Proposal of William Penn that they should treat each 
other kindly, and should each choose an equal num- 
ber of men who should settle peacefully all disputes 
between them. 
c William Penn said to the Indians: “We meet on the 
broad pathway of good faith and good will; no 
advantage shall be taken on either side, but all 
shall be openness and love. I will not call you chil- 
dren, for parents sometimes chide their children too 
severely; nor brothers only, for brothers differ. 
The friendship between me and you I will not 
compare to a chain; for that the rains might rust. 
We are the same as if one man’s body were to be 
divided into two parts.”

A small wigwam may be made and kept in the school-room; 
imitation tomahawks may be made of wood; sometimes bows 
and arrows may be made by the children. 
Indian arrow heads, moccasins, bows and arrows, baskets, and 
pottery, which were really made or used by Indians, should 
be shown to the children.

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 45 
There are many articles or scenes connected with Indian life, 
which the pupils can draw or color after they are hektographed. 
When the teacher is having an Indian lesson, especially one 
in review, it will add to the interest and effectiveness, if 
those pupils who have Indian suits are allowed to wear them 
to school. In this case, they can make believe that they are 
Indian children and show in action some of the things they 
would do if they were really Indians. 
An Indian scene on the sand-table may be made quite effective.

i We know very little about these voyages. One is of 
interest, where Columbus took part in a naval expedi- 
tion against Naples. On this expedition, he was 
sent to capture a galley in the harbor of Tunis; on 
hearing that two ships were with the galley, his 
crew were determined to turn back. Columbus 
made his crew believe that he intended to do as they 
wished, altered the point of the compass and spread 
all sail, but he really kept on in the same direction.

Customs oF HaLLOWE’EN 
In some cases the teacher may wish to describe a few of the 
ancient customs connected with Hallowe’en, October 31. 
Long ago, about this time of the year, some of the ancient 
autumn festivals were held. Thus many of the customs connected 
with this time have to do with nuts and apples. 
The following ancient customs and games are good ones to take 
with the children: 
In some places in England a cake used to be baked at Hallow- 
e’en for each member of the family, and the night was often called 
“Cake Night.” Sometimes many small cakes, called ‘Soul- 
cakes,” were made. One ancient custom was for companies of 
poor people to go around singing under the windows, in some- 
what the same manner as the waits at Christmas time, only at the 
Hallowe’en season they asked for soul-cakes and sang something 
like the following: 
“Soul, soul, for a soul-cake; 
Pray you, good mistress, a soul-cake!”’ 
In the ancient celebrations of this night bonfires and the ring- 
ing of bells were used. A loaf of cake, in which a ring and some- 
times other articles were placed, was often made. Cabbages play 
an important part in the Hallowe’en customs in Scotland. One 
of the dishes for the feast is always cabbage broth. The boys and 
girls go around also and gather as quickly as possible all cabbages 
which still remain in the gardens and throw them against the 
farmer’s door. Sometimes they go into the garden blindfolded, 
and pull the first cabbage stalk they touch, thinking that its 
appearance has a special meaning for them. 
Hallowe’en is connected with the harvest time. It is also the
-P-A-G-E-52
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 53 
time when fairies and witches are supposed to have special 
power. 
Among the games with apples for Hallowe’en are ducking for 
apples in tubs of water; the “snap Apple” game, in which an 
apple and a candle are revolving at the end of a string and the 
player tries to bite the apple before the candle gets around; also 
peeling an apple and throwing the skin over the shoulder to see 
what letter it will make. Nuts are used in the games for Hallow- 
e’en. In some places the night is called “Nut Crack Night.” 
One game is to put nuts in the fire and watch to see how they burn. 
Another game is to hide nuts about the house or yard; then all 
are blindfolded and they try to see which one can find the most 
nuts. 
Plenty of apples and nuts must be provided for the Hallowe’en 
feast. 
The “Raisin Race” is another old game. For this game a 
raisin is tied in the middle of a long string; then two boys, one at 
each end of the string, try to see which can chew in the string to 
get to the raisin first. 
One of the old customs on this night is to melt pieces of lead, 
put them into water, and the shapes into which they harden are 
supposed to tell the occupation which the different persons, who 
put them in, are to engage in later. It is also said that if you look 
over your shoulder into a mirror you will see some one you care 
for. If you hang a red ear of corn above your door on Hallow- 
e’en night, then put on the threshold a horseshoe which was lost 
“by a white horse in the dark of the moon,” and walk around the 
horseshoe three times scattering hemp seed, some people say that 
all the evil spirits will be frightened away, but the good spirits 
will come and you will have good luck for a whole year. 
In this country the Jack-o’-lantern is used by the boys in the 
celebration. They often make these and carry them around from 
door to door.

OCTOBER WORK 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
SuccEsTions For Exercises TO Give AcTION 
AND ATMOSPHERE TO THE STORIES 
I Autumn DANCE 
The first part of the dance is given by twelve children, six 
boys and six girls. The boys have on white blouses and the 
girls white dresses; they carry autumn flowers. The girls 
wear red sashes cad hair ribbons, and the boys red neckties. 
(These are made of cambric.) 
The girls enter from the right of the stage; the boys from 
the left. They skip past each other around the stage until 
they meet at the center back of the stage. Here they take hold 
of hands and skip two by two to the front, where they break 
ranks, skipping to the rearagain. Thisisrepeated. The third 
time, when they reach the center front, the couples alternate, 
the first couple skips to the right, the second to the left, and so 
on. The couples then skip to the center back of the stage and 
repeat. After this they form a large circle, dancing all around 
the stage. They next break into three groups of four each, 
one group in the center front of the stage and one farther back 
on each side. The couples turn and join right hands diagonally. 
Each child should have the right shoulder toward the center of 
the circle. At a chord on the piano, all dance to the right for 
eight counts; they then drop hands and each one bows to his 
partner; they turn, join left hands, and repeat to the left for 
eight counts (windmill dance). At the conclusion of this, a 
large circle is formed again; they dance to the center back of the 
stage; then toward the front, forming two lines facing front 
(boys on one side, girls on the other). The flowers are held 
high toward partners. This first dance is to represent The 
Last of Summer and is for second and third grade pupils. 
The second part of the dance is to represent The Beginning 
of Autumn, and is for first and second grade pupils. : -Eight 
small girls now enter and dance around the stage, then between 
the two lines that have been formed by the other children. 
Then the children in the first part of the dance skip off the stage, 
leaving the others to dance around the stage scattering autumn 
leaves. 
The eight girls in the last part of the dance wear surplices
-P-A-G-E-54
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 55 
of the brown autumn crépe paper over their white dresses, and 
on their heads they wear bands covered with autumn leaves. 
They hold up the front of their crépe paper dresses full of autumn 
leaves, which they scatter over the stage as they dance. 
II Lessons oF Lirrie InpIAN CHILDREN 
(First and Second Grade pupils. Two older children for 
Indian teachers.) 
Branches of autumn leaves may be placed around the stage, 
or the school-room may be decorated with the branches if the 
exercises are given there; two or three logs may be used for 
seats; and wood arranged with red lights to look like a fire in 
the center. 
1 Lessons of Little Indian Boys 
a Walking Indian file. One large boy and five or more 
very small ones, all dressed in Indian suits. The large boy 
has a pouch full of arrows and near him on the stage are placed 
his bow and tomahawk. 
The little boys are grouped about the larger.one when the 
curtain rises. The large boy first shows the small ones how 
to stand up very straight (this may be omitted); then he walks 
across the stage or room, showing the small Indian boys how to 
walk as Indians should. When he returns across the stage, he 
points to the smallest Indian boy to follow him and the boy 
follows across the stage. The little Indian keeps his eyes on the 
larger one and tries to walk just as he does. After these two 
have crossed the stage, another little Indian boy follows and 
so on, until all the small boys are following the large one and 
trying to learn to walk just as he does. Then the large Indian 
stands a little back and watches the little Indians walk across 
the stage to see if they do it right. Each boy must stand as 
straight as possible and follow exactly in the footsteps of the 
one in front of him. 
6 Shooting with bow and arrow. After this all the In- 
dian boys form a group again in the center of the stage; the 
large boy takes his bow and arrow, kneels, and shows the little 
boys how to shoot with it. Each little Indian boy in turn kneels 
and pretends to shoot. The larger boy shows some of them 
again or helps them. He shows how to aim at some particu- 
lar object and he may show them also how to hide behind a 
tree, log, or some other object. As the little boys are supposed 
~ be having lessons, they are not expected to do very well at 
rst.
-P-A-G-E-55
56 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
c Using tomahawk. The older boy puts his bow and 
arrow, takes his tomahawk, whirls it around his head, and holds 
it poised as if to throw. The little Indians practice this also 
in the same manner as the bow and arrow. This is more diffi- 
cult and the boys require more help than in regard to the bow 
and arrow. 
The tomahawk may be made of wood by the older boys. 
Many boys have Indian suits and bows and arrows. 
d Giving the war whoop. The older boy gives the war- 
whoop a number of times, the little boys listening intently. 
Then one of the little boys tries it. The older boy repeats and 
has other little boys give it. 
2 Lessons of Little Indian Girls 
a Making clay dishes. An older girl and five or more 
little girls. The Indian costumes for the girls may be made 
of brown crépe paper, trimmed with fringe of red or blue crépe 
paper. The bands for the head may be made of cardboard 
covered with brown crépe paper and having red or blue feathers 
made from the paper. 
The older girl molds some clay into the form of a rude dish; 
she shows it to the little Indian girls; then places it before the 
fire. The little girls watch the older one as she molds the dish. 
After this the little Indians are given pieces of clay and they 
try to make dishes also. The Indian teacher goes from one to 
another showing and helping them. When the other dishes 
are finished they are also placed before the fire. 
b Cooking. For the second lesson a log hollowed out and 
a pestle made of wood are placed in the center of the stage. 
Ears of Indian corn are placed near, and some of the corn is 
put in the hollow of the log. The older girl or teacher takes 
the pestle and pounds the Indian corn; she shows the Indian 
girls when it is fine enough, and then lets each in turn pound a 
little corn. The lesson may be continued to the making of the 
Indian cakes or other forms of Indian cooking may be introduced 
instead of the one given here. 
c Making baskets. For the third lesson all the Indian

how to make baskets. 
3 An Indian Legend Told to the Little Indian Children 
All the little Indian boys and girls are grouped about some 
older person dressed in Indian costume. An Indian legend is 
told to the children by the older person,

(Of course, if this is given for an entertainment, the story 
teller is really talking to the whole audience, while pretending 
to be simply telling the legend to the children. The group listen- 
ing on the stage is used for tableau effect.) 
These lessons of the little Indian children may be taken 
in connection with the regular school-room work instead of as 
part of an entertainment. 
III THe Story of Cotumsus ILLusTRATED 
(First and Second Grade Pupils.) 
There are nine children, besides the queen’s page, in this 
exercise. They come to the center of the stage one by one; 
give short statements explaining what they illustrate in the 
story of Columbus and then go to positions so that at the end 
they form a semi-circle. 
1 A little boy. He carries a map which is drawn from one 
of the time of Columbus. He shows the map to the audience 
and says: 
“When Columbus was a little boy he lived across the water 
in the beautiful country of Italy. He loved the sea, so his 
father sent him to school to learn to be a sailor. He drew 
many maps.” 
2 A little girl. She carries an enlarged drawing of a 
picture found in Wilson’s Historical Reader; this picture shows 
what the people believed about the dreadful monsters that lived 
in the ocean. She says: 
“At this time the people were afraid to go far on the ocean, 
because they believed that dreadful monsters like this (shows 
drawing) lived in the ocean.” 
3 A little boy. He is dressed in full black bloomers, 
slashed with red, and has a black cape, lined with blue. He 
carries a plumed hat in his hand and represents Columbus. 
He says: 
“Tam not afraid of the sea. If I had a ship, I would sail 
across the ocean; but no one will help me.” 
4 A little boy. He is dressed in the long black costume 
of a monk and carries a small cross. He says: 
“Most of the churchmen laugh at Columbus; but I believe 
inhim. I will ask Queen Isabella of Spain to give him a ship.” 
5 A little girl representing Queen Isabella of Spain. She 
is dressed in a costume of red cheese cloth, trimmed with ermine, 
and wears a crown of gilt trimmed with jewels. Her page 
is a little kindergarten boy, dressed in white cap and cape.

(Jewels may be cut from bright colored pieces of glazed 
paper. The ermine is made of strips of cotton upon which little 
black pieces of cloth are sewed.) 
The Queen says: 
“T will help you, Columbus, even if I have to sell all my 
jewels.” 
6 A boy, representing a sailor. He is dressed in blue 
suit and wears a blue sailor cap. He carries a small sailboat 
and says: 
“Tt was only a small ship that we had and we were afraid, 
for we sailed for a long, long time before we saw land.” 
7 Alittle boy. He is dressed in an Indian suit and carries 
asmall Indian canoe. He says: 
“Columbus saw some of my people in the new country he 
discovered.” 
8 A little girl. She carries a Spanish flag, of the time of 
Columbus. She says: 
“Now Columbus had brought with him a Spanish flag, 
and when the men were landed he raised the flag.” 
9 A boy. He carries a white banner, upon which in gilt 
is October 12, 1492. He gives the following quotation from 
Lowell: 
“One poor day! 
Think whose and not how short it is! 
It is God’s day! It is Columbus’s. 
One day with life and heart is more than time enough to 
found a world.” 1

lovely flowers, vines, and hedges. However, they were 
determined to worship as they thought right, and 
King James of England said that he would make 
them go to the church he believed in or leave the 
country. Finally some of these people, who lived 
at Scrooby or near there and whom we call Pilgrims, 
decided to go to Holland, because there they could 
worship God as they thought right.)

b No other rock like this on the shore. 
c Story that this rock was the landing place of the Pil- 
grims. ‘ 
(Not certain about the truth of this story.) 
In the year 1741, a very old man who lived in Duxbury 
heard that the people of Plymouth were thinking 
of building a wharf over this Rock. This man’s 
name was Thomas Faunce and he was ninety-five 
years old at this time. He asked to be carried 
in his armchair to the Rock that he might tell the 
people of Plymouth about it and protest against 
their building the wharf. Many people stood about
-P-A-G-E-67
68 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
the Rock, while Thomas Faunce, from his seat on it, 
told them that when he was a boy his father had 
told him the story of the landing of the Pilgrims, 
and had said that it was on this very Rock that they 
first stepped. Thomas Faunce said that his father 
had come over to this country in 1623 and had heard 
the story about the Rock from Pilgrims, who had 
come over in the Mayflower. With tears the old 
man then bade farewell to Plymouth Rock. 
d Later history. 
There is another story connected with this interesting 
Rock. About the time of the beginning of the war 
of the colonies with their mother country, England, 
it was determined to move the Rock to the center 
of the town and to raise a liberty-pole on it. When 
they were trying to move it, it split into two parts, 
one of which was left where it had always been and 
the other was drawn by many oxen to the Town 
Square, where there was a liberty-pole with a flag 
on it. Upon this flag were the words: “Liberty or 
Death.” Some of the people thought that when 
the Rock split in two, it meant that the colonies 
would be separated from England. 
It was not until 1880 that the piece of the Rock, which 
had been removed, was taken back and the two 
parts joined together again. The canopy over the 
Rock was designed by Hammatt Billings and 
finished in 1867.

in some way with the Pilgrims: Governor Carver’s 
chair; Peregrine White’s cradle; an iron pot and 
pewter platter belonging to Miles Standish, also 
the sword of Captain Standish and the ‘sampler” 
worked by his daughter, etc. 
(Probably the teacher will be able to obtain some 
sampler to show the children.) 
Indian weapons and other articles are also found in 
this room. 
5 National Monument to the Pilgrims. 
a The monument is made of granite; is eighty-one feet 
high; was designed by Hammatt Billings; and 
finished in 1888. 
6 Description 
At the top is a large figure representing Faith, pointing 
upward with one hand and holding a Bible in the 
other. Below are four other figures, and still lower 
on the monument are shown some of the most im- 
portant scenes in the history of the Pilgrims. 
6 Places of historic interest in the towns near Plymouth. 
a Home of Major John Bradford, grandson of Governor 
Bradford, in Kingston. 
He was the last of the Bradford family to have the 
history of Plymouth, which was written by his grand- 
father. Major Bradford lent this history to Judge 
Sewall of Boston and later it was given to the minis- 
ter of the Old South Church in Boston, who kept 
it with other important manuscripts in the “steeple 
chamber” of the Old South Meeting-house. Thus 
it was probably in Boston at the time when the 
British troops occupied that place, but it was not 
heard of after they left the city until the time when 
it was found in England. About one hundred and 
twenty-five years after the loss of the “Bradford 
Manuscript,” the attempts of the people of the 
United States to have it returned to this country 
were successful, It was about 1846, when it was
-P-A-G-E-69
70 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
discovered in England, and it was returned and 
placed in the library in Boston, Massachusetts, in 
1897. 
As has been already suggested, a story about this 
history might be told to the children in the fourth 
grade; it could be made interesting by telling it as 
the story of a book which wasa great traveler. A copy 
of it may be shown and a description of it given. 
6 Objects of interest connected with Miles Standish. 
Standish house at Duxbury, built by Miles Standish’s 
son, but containing the hearthstone and some 
ee from an earlier house in which the captain 
lived. 
Monument erected to the memory of Captain Miles 
Standish on Captain’s Hill, Duxbury.

3 Harvest-Home in England and Scotland. 
a Sometimes the last sheaf of corn used to be dressed up as 
an old woman or a “maiden”; and at the harvest 
supper or feast this image would sit at the head of 
the table or would be placed in some prominent 
position, and all would do honor to it. (In some 
places the image was called the harvest queen.) 
6 Carrying home the last load of the harvest. 
Sometimes accompanied by the reapers, dancing and 
singing an old harvest song: 
Harvest home! harvest home! 
We’ve ploughed, we’ve sowed, 
We’ve reaped, we’ve mowed, 
We’ve brought home every load. 
Hip, hip, hip, harvest-home! 
c Custom of sending the last of the grain which was cut 
to some farmer near by, who had not finished cutting 
his grain. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE STORIES AND FOR MAxkING THE WORK 
INTERESTING 
(The suggestions, poems, and other material for this month are 
not given separately for each topic, because of the close connec- 
tion ets the two subjects: The Pilgrims and Thanksgiving 
Day. 
Use of simple arrangements of costume in connection with the 
stories about the Pilgrims. In the two illustrations, “Talking 
About the Pilgrims” and “The Pilgrims Going to Church,” the 
use of easily made costumes for the story work is illustrated. 
These simple costumes make the stories and talks seem much 
more real to the children; they give the atmosphere and setting 
which is so important and help the imagination. The teacher 
or person who is telling the story in one of the pictures is dressed 
in cap, kerchief, and apron as well as the others. The kerchiefs 
are made of squares of cheese cloth; the caps, cuffs, and aprons 
are made of white crépe or thin paper. The hats which the boys 
wear are made of brown construction paper. The boys may wear 
their sneakers or low shoes, and buckles may be made from silver 
or gilt paper. 
The costumes add also to the interest which the children feel 
in acting certain scenes connected with Pilgrim life. This repre-
-P-A-G-E-72
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 73 
sentation of Pilgrim scenes may be very simple, as for example, 
to march around the room or from one room to another and to 
pretend that they are Pilgrims going to church. Other tableaux 
or scenes which might be given by the children are the following: 
Pilgrims at Church (the service); Samoset’s First Visit to the 
Pilgrims; Priscilla and John Alden; The First Spinning Lesson; 
The First Thanksgiving (picture in “Short Stories from American 
History,” by Blaisdell and Ball, page 18.) 
In connection with the harvest, the teacher may take additional 
stories if she desires, as for example: The Story of the Corn 
Dance Among the Indians, and The Story of a Husking Bee in 
Old New England. 
If the teacher has time in November, stories about the settle- 
ment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and life in that colony; 
also stories of some other settlements, as for example, the settle- 
ment at Jamestown, Virginia, the settlement of the Dutch at New 
Amsterdam (New York), and the settlement of Pennsylvania by 
William Penn may be taken. In the work of this month the chief 
characteristics of the early settlers should be emphasized. 
The teacher should bring into the school-room as many articles 
as possible which illustrate colonial life. If there are any museums 
or historical rooms, where additional articles of historical value 
connected with this subject are kept, the children should be taken 
to visit them. Possibly the children may have some articles 
of interest in their homes also; if so, emphasize their value and 
encourage the children to bring them to school to show to the 
other members of the class. 
Tell the children the importance of preserving places, as well 
as articles, connected with the early history of our country. If 
any of these places are situated near the school, the pupils should 
be taken to visit them. 
An old-fashioned room or some colonial scene may be illus- 
trated in the school-room. If the teacher owns or can obtain for 
a short time some old-fashioned articles she may make one corner 
of the room suggest a colonial scene. Another way would be to use 
a wooden box or a table and illustrate colonial life with small arti- 
cles made by the teacher or some of the pupils. Some colonial 
scene, as for example, the visit of Samoset to the Pilgrim settle- 
ment or John Alden visiting Priscilla, might be represented on the 
sand-table, Of course the teacher might also illustrate life in the 
colonies by means of drawings. 
While talking about the settlement of Plymouth and other 
early colonies, the teacher may mention the settlement of the 
town or city in which the school is situated.

THANKSGIVING DAY 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
Stage Decoration 
The stage may be decorated with sheaves of corn in the 
background and vegetables grouped in front of the sheaves. 
As many pumpkins as possible should be used as they make an 
attractive combination with the corn. The children may be 
asked to bring the vegetables, which may be used first for decora- 
tion at the exercises and then given to the poor. 
Chief Characters 
Eight girls representing Summer. 
Eight boys representing Winter. 
Two boys, one representing an Egyptian, and the other a 
Hebrew. 
Three girls: first representing a Greek, second a Roman, third 
an English woman. 
Sixteen girls in a Harvest Drill.

Scenes or Exercises 
I The Coming of Winter 
1 Song: “November.” (Third Grade pupils.) 
2 Dance: Summer Driven Away by Winter. (Pupils from 
the First and Second Grades.) 
Eight little girls represent Summer. They are dressed 
in white, have green wreaths on their heads, and carry a large 
chrysanthemum in each hand. They dance lightly and joy- 
fully, using the skipping step and waving their flowers. 
Eight little boys represent Winter. The boys are dressed 
in red sweaters, stocking caps, and mittens. A band of cotton 
covered with mica snow is sewed around the edge of the sweaters 
and caps. The boys carry snowballs, made of cotton rolled in 
paste and then in mica snow. 
The girls enter first, all from the same side, and dance around 
the stage in a large circle. After dancing around the stage a 
number of times; they dance forward and back across the stage, 
four beginning at the extreme right back of the stage and four 
at the extreme left, and continuing until the two lines meet at 
the center back and come dancing to the front two by two. This 
is a kind of figure eight movement. (Other movements may be 
added here if desired.) Next they form and dance in two small 
circles, one at the right and one at the left of the stage. 
As they are dancing in the small circles, a very large 
snowball is thrown into the center of the stage. The little girls 
stop dancing and draw back, shivering. 
Then four of the little boys representing winter come run- 
ning onto the stage. They run across the stage, pretending all 
the time to be throwing their snowballs at the little girls, and 
drive off the group at the farther side of the stage, then return 
and drive off the other group. After being driven off the stage, 
one group of four little girls returns and begins to dance again. 
At this the whole eight little boys come from the other side of the 
stage and drive the girls off again. When the girls have been 
finally driven from the stage, the eight little boys turn toward 
the front, and kneel, pretending to throw the snowballs at the 
audience, thus forming a tableau as the curtain goes down.

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 79 
This subject is illustrated by five children, two boys and 
three girls, representing the Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, 
and English people. There is a green pedestal at the front 
of the stage to represent an altar. All the children, except the 
Hebrew, ca ry baskets filled with grain, fruit, and flowers. The 
Hebrew« carries a roll of paper to represent the Hebrew Law, or 
else a few stalks of wheat. The children come upon the stage 
one by one, and after each has spoken, the basket is placed upon 
the altar, and the child goes to a position so that at the end 
the five children form a semi-circle. 
Costumes: The children are dressed in costumes to 
correspond with the different countries they represent. 
The Egyptian boy wears a white tunic, a long, loose 
brown cloak, with yellow border, and a turban. 
The Hebrew wears a white tunic with a light purple over- 
garment. He has a breastplate. The breastplate is made of 
gilt paper upon which are pasted pieces of different colored 
paper cut to resemble gems. 
The Greek girl has a white Greek costume, with Greek 
border of gilt paper. The costume of the Roman girl is similar 
to that of the Greek. : 
The English girl wears a brown dress, made with a basque 
and old-fashioned full skirt. She has also a large white ruff. 
The material used for the costumes is cambric and sateen. 
The children give the following short statements concern- 
ing their harvest: 
First — Egyptian os 
“Osiris, the river god, is over the land and since he gives 
such rich harvests, we must serve him with gladness, or he will 
not give his blessings again.” 
Second — Hebrew 
“We observe the feast of harvest, which is in the end of 
the year, even as the Lord our God has commanded us.” 
Third — Greek 
“Demeter, our goddess, has watched over our harvest, and 
now we come to thank her and bring her gifts.” 
Fourth — Roman 
“Ceres has watched carefully over our grain and fruits, so 
now we are going to crown her with these lovely flowers and 
offer her this fruit.”

2 Tableau: Giving Thanks in a Puritan Home. 
A very small boy and girl, either from Kindergarten or 
first grade, should be used for this tableau. A small table is 
placed in the center of the stage; on the table is a turkey, pud- 
ding, pie, and fruit, or any other things appropriate to Thanks- 
giving. The little boy stands at one side of the table, his eyes 
closed and arm raised as if asking a blessing. The little girl 
stands, with bowed head, at the other side of the table. The 
boy wears the Puritan collar and cuffs; the girl has an old-

fashioned dress, Puritan cap, kerchief, and cuffs. The girl’s 
dress is made of dark cambric. 
3 Elder Brewster reads a Thanksgiving Proclamation. 
A larger boy represents Elder Brewster. He is dressed 
in a loose, long black cloak, with wide white collar and cuffs. 
He wears also a small black cap. 
The Thanksgiving Proclamation may be the real one 
for the year only with the language changed to correspond to the 
period of the Pilgrims; or it may be one written appropriate 
to local conditions at the school, but still preserving the Puritan 
forms of expression.

4 Christmas Legends. 
a The Christmas Rose. 
The beautiful light of that First Christmas Night was 
shining on the hills of Bethlehem. The shepherds 
leave their flocks and follow the angel as he sings, 
“Rejoice! for Christ your King is born this night at 
Bethlehem.” A thin blanket of snow which softly lay 
over all the country, glistened as it reflected back 
the light from the wondrous sky; underneath this 
blanket the little flowers were sleeping peacefully. 
One little white rose alone heard the angel’s song 
of joy. “‘I will blossom in the snow,’’ it said. On 
their way to Bethlehem, the shepherds saw the 
rose, and carried it to the Christ-Child. As the 
shepherds came near the manger, above which the 
star was shining, behold! the light of that star as 
it- fell on the white rose changed its color to gold 
and the blossom became the first Christmas rose. 
6 The Snow Owl and the Snow Flowers. 
One night at midnight, in the cold winter of Northern 
Europe, a beautiful white Snow-owl was sleeping. 
His home was among the evergreen trees in the 
great black forest. Suddenly he was awakened by 
aflash of light. The light grew brighter and brighter, 
and looking up through the branches, the Snow-owl 
saw a large star such as he had never seen before. 
Under the influence of that star, the owl flew far, 
far away from his home to the little town of Bethle-
-P-A-G-E-88
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 89 
hem. There he entered a stable, and all night he 
watched carefully over the Christ-Child and the 
Mother. But the next day, as the great Snow-owl 
was flying back to his home, a hunter shot an arrow 
which sorely wounded him. The dying owl saw 
some evergreen trees, which reminded him of his 
home in the great forest so far away. Although 
his wound was bleeding sadly, he struggled on 
until he could die under their shelter. When the 
hunters followed, they saw that each drop of blood 
shed by the Snow-owl had become a beautiful flower. 
c The Haughty Aspen. (A German legend.) 
As I went through the tangled wood 
I heard the Aspen shiver. 
“What dost thou ail, sweet Aspen, say, 
Why do thy leaflets quiver?” 
3 — Nora Archibald Smith 
Answering, the Aspen told this story: “Long ago the 
Mother Mary, with the Heavenly Child clasped 
in her arms and Joseph by her side, rode through the 
wood. The mother was beautiful as a lily, the Babe 
like a little lily-bud. The birds sang: ‘Thy Master 
comes! Bow down before him!’ The date, the 
fig, the hazel tree bent in worship. Every bird and 
tree and flower bowed before Him. I alone stood 
haughtily erect and would not own his power. 
‘Proud Aspen,’ said the Mother, ‘wilt thou refuse 
due homage to thy Lord?’ At her voice, my 
boughs began to shiver, and still through all the 
years since then my sorrowful leaflets quiver.” 
5 The meaning of Christmas. 
At the Christmas tide 
Hearts shall meet though the world be wide. 
Give us, O God, the Longer Love, 
And to all the Heart of the Tree. 
—Charles F. Lummis 
Christmas means peace, hope, joy, good-will to all. 
Emphasize with the children the following points: 
a The democratic character of Christmas; it belongs to all. 
Everyone should share in the joy of Christmas. It is 
a festival when differences of rank should be for- 
gotten, as they were in the olden times. The celebra- 
tion of Christmas should be joyful and universal.
-P-A-G-E-89
90 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
D The hospitality of Christmas time should be full and 
free; all should be welcome. 
c The greatest happiness at Christmas time does not come 
from receiving; but from giving, especially from 
sharing our joy with others. Explain that it is not 
the value of the gift in money, but the love it repre- 
sents that makes it worthy. 
One man gave much gold and built many beautiful 
buildings. Another man had no money to give, 
but he tried lovingly to help and cheer everyone 
with whom he came in contact. 
The record of the rich man’s gifts 
Lies on a dusty shelf; 
The poor man lives in countless hearts 
Because he gave himself. 
— “Aftermath,” by Charlotte Becker 
d Simplicity in the celebration of Christmas. Old simple 
customs in the observance of Christmas; those 
which have been handed down to us from long ago 
and have a meaning, are best. 
e The symbolism of Christmas customs. We should think 
of the real meaning connected especially with 
ancient observances. 
f Christmas is Christ’s birthday. We should do some- 
thing for others and celebrate the day in a manner 
of which He would approve. 
(These points should be emphasized by means of 
stories, quotations on the blackboard, drawings, 
and pictures. The talks on English customs will 
give many of the right ideas.)

On Christmas Eve a large log, called the yule log, was 
brought with much merry-making into the hall and 
placed in the fireplace. Then a piece of last year’s 
log, which had been saved for this purpose, was 
brought out and used to kindle the new log. Every- 
one treated the log with great ceremony as it was 
dragged in, bowing to it as it passed. 
A song to the yule log was sung, and after it was lighted 
story-telling, games, and enjoyment were at their 
height. ‘The yule log must burn all night and then 
what was left must be kept very carefully, because 
it was supposed to guard the house during the year.

5 Christmas carols and the Christmas Waits.

And ‘‘Merry Christmas” wished to all! 
— Wordsworth 
An ancient and beautiful English custom was that of 
the waits singing on Christmas morning. This cus- 
tom was not, however, confined to Christmas morn- 
ing, but all through December you might hear the 
Christmas carols, sung by groups of these waits, 
who went from house to house at night. There 
are many old English carols.

One of the old carols contains the following: ; 
“God bless the master of this house, 
Likewise the mistress too, 
And all the little children 
That round the table strew.” 
Sometimes, also, the little children who went around 
singing and collecting pennies, would sing this 
stanza: 
“The roads are very dirty, my boots are very thin, 
I have a little pocket to put a penny in.” 
(Show pictures of the waits, and have the children

portance. The boar’s head, with a lemon in its 
mouth, is placed on a silver dish and decorated with 
laurel and other greens. It is carried into the 
banquet-hall, accompanied by trumpeters and lighted 
candles, while the song, “The boar’s head in hand 
bear I,” is chanted. Story of the student at Queen’s 
College, Oxford, and the wild boar. (Show pictures

“Ancient sirloin,” or “baron of beef” (a half side of 
beef roasted.) The story of the knighting of the 
loin of beef by Charles II. of England: One Christ- 
mas time Charles and his men went forth to hunt 
a stag. When they returned with their prize, 
they piled the great logs on the fireplace that they 
might warm themselves, and then they had a feast. 
As they were all enjoying the huge loin of beef, King 
Charles said:
-P-A-G-E-93
94 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
“A noble dish! 
Aye, noble made by me! 
By kingly right, 
I dub thee knight — 
Sir Loin henceforward be!” 
And all “acclaimed” and thought there never was a 
more worthy knight than Sir Loin. 
The roast beef is always served at the Christmas feast 
in England; sometimes it is accompanied with a 
Yorkshire pudding. 
Plum pudding: very rich; decorated with holly; 
with blazing brandy surrounding it. (Description 
in Dickens’ Christmas Carol.) 
Mince-pie. Mutton was always the meat that was 
used long ago for making mince pies, in memory 
of the flocks of sheep that the shepherds were watch- 
ing at Bethlehem the night of Christ’s birth. The 
Old Saxon name for mince-pie is “‘Christ-Cradle.” 
The following legend or story is told by Margaret 
J. Preston under the title: ‘The Christ-Cradle: 
A Christmas Ballad.” Long ago, in the time of the 
Crusades, one of these brave warriors, the Lord of 
Lancarvan Castle, came back with his followers from 
the Holy Land. It was Christmas Eve; the yule 
log was burning; and helmet, shield, and banner 
were hanging on the wall in the great hall of the 
English castle, where this nobleman lived. His 
little children gathered about him, while he told 
them wonderful stories of the holy places he had 
seen far across the sea. He told them of the shep- 
herds, and the song of the angels on the first Christ- 
mas night; of the bright star; and the cradle, in 
which the little Baby lay. Then the baron said to 
his wife: “I have thought of a different cradle which 
you shall make me in honor of Christmas Day. 
Take the largest and deepest of your platters to 
remind us of the manger; cover it with rich flakes 
of pastry as the little Christ-Child was wrapped in 
white linen bands. The best of all you have in 
your larder you must use, for nothing is too good 
for this Christmas guest; meats cut in very fine 
small pieces because the straw was chopped in the 
stall; butter and honey, raisins and figs that make

us think of the East, spices to remind us of the gifts 
of the Magi, sweets and fruits — the richest of every- 
thing we have shall be placed in the platter. Then 
over it all put a cover of pastry, on which a star is 
drawn like that the Wise Men saw. We will call 
it Christ’s-Cradle and I hope you will make us 
merry with one at dinner each Christmas Day.” 
(Custom sometimes of eating mince-pie in twelve 
different houses during last week of year — supposed 
to ensure twelve happy months for the next year.) 
8 The Wassail Bowl. 
The wassail round, in good brown bowls, 
Garnished with ribbons, blithely trowls, 
There the huge sirloin reeked; hard by 
Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pie. 
—Scott 
The Wassail Bowl was of great importance in an old 
English celebration of Christmas; it was a very 
large silver bowl, filled with a spiced and sweetened 
drink, upon the surface of which roasted apples 
might be seen bobbing about. One custom was to 
have the Wassail Bowl brought in by the steward 
at the end of the Christmas feast. Wishing every- 
one a Merry Christmas, the master of the house put 
the great bowl to his lips and drank. Then the was- 
sail bowl was passed from hand to hand around the 
table and all drank from it, while the old Wassail 
songs were sung. 
According to another old custom, young women would 
carry the wassai’ bowl from door to door and drink 
to the health of every member of the household.

lyke in the house of every nobleman of honor.”
-P-A-G-E-95
96 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The Lord of Misrule had charge of the Christmas revels; 
he ruled from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night, and 
declared that he changed all into children and no 
one must think himself too wise or old to take part 
in the fun. 
The following is part of a description given by E. S. 
Brooks in the St. Nicholas, January, 1885, of the 
Lord of Misrule and his followers in the time of 
Queen Elizabeth of England. ‘‘On Christmas Eve 
the great hall gleamed with the light of many 
candles that flashed upon sconce and armor and 
polished floor. Holly, mistletoe, and all the decora- 
tions of an old-time English Christmas were taste- 
fully arranged. A burst of laughter rang through 
the hall, as through the great doorway trooped the 
motley train of the Lord of Misrule to open the 
Christmas revels. A fierce looking fellow was he, 
with his green mustache, his gorgeous clothing, 
composed of parti-colored jerkin and _half-hose, 
trunks, ruff, slouch-boots and high befeathered 
steeple hat. His long staff, topped with a fool’s 
head, cap and bells, rang loudly, as, preceded by 
his small but pompous page, he led his train round 
and round the great hall. A menagerie let loose, or 
the most bewildering of dreams, could not be more 
wonderful than this motley train of the Lord of 
Misrule. Giants and dwarfs, dragons and griffins, 
hobby-horses and goblins, Robin Hood and the 
Grand Turk, bears and boars and fantastic animals 
that never had a name, boys and girls, men and 
women, in every imaginable costume and device — 
around and around the hall they went, ringing out 
the chorus:

The children should not be told about all these old 
English Christmas customs in one lesson; it is better 
to take a few minutes at different times and talk 
informally with the children in regard to some one 
important feature of the celebration. In the Fourth 
Grade this work may be connected with the story 
of Queen Elizabeth, during whose reign the Christmas

“Any man or woman that can give any knowledge 
of an old, old, very old gray-bearded gentleman, 
called Christmas, who was wont to be a very familiar 
guest and visit all sorts of people, both poor and 
rich, and had ringing feast and jollity in all places, 
both in the city and country, for his coming; who- 
soever can tell what is become of him, or where he 
may be found, let them bring him back again into 
England.” 
b No celebration of Christmas among the Puritans in New 
England. (Christmas was not a holiday and no 
gifts.) Only about fifty or sixty years since Christ- 
mas began to be observed to any great extent in 
this part of the country. (Our present Christmas 
customs introduced partly from Germany and the 
Northern countries of Europe.) The poem, ‘The 
Puritan Doll,” by Mary E. Wilkins, may be read 
to the children. 
3 Some strange ways of observing Christmas. 
a In some of the quiet valleys of New Mexico, far from the 
general routes of travel, for nine days before Christ- 
mas the people used to gather together each evening 
and go to the house of one of their number, where 
they announced that they were Mary and Joseph 
seeking lodging. When they were admitted, there 
was great merrymaking. Christmas Eve a repre- 
sentation of the birth of Christ was given. 
b In some parts of Alaska, the native people of the coun- 
try, had a custom called “Going around with the 
star.” A large star was carried about from house 
to house; at each house the star-bearer and his 
followers sang a Christmas carol and were given 
refreshments. This was to symbolize the search 
of the wise men for the Christ-Child. On the third 
evening, the star-bearers were pursued by masked 
and disguised persons, who tried to destroy their 
stars and were supposed to represent the soldiers 
sent by Herod to kill the children.

V Christmas Symbols, or those things which are especially asso- 
ciated with Christmas 
(Suggestive material for lessons.) 
Introduction: Ways to make the lessons interesting. 
The children should have explained to them the meaning 
or reason for the Christmas symbols, whatever speaks to us 
of Christmas or reminds us that the festival is near. 
One or more lessons may be given in reference to these 
Christmas symbols. Let the children name some of the 
things that they see at Christmas time, or that make them 
think of Christmas, as laurel wreaths in the windows, repre- 
sentations of Santa Claus in the stores, bells, holly, etc. Have 
them tell the colors and flowers that are used. These things 
that remind us of Christmas, we may call little Christmas 
symbols. The teacher may draw the symbols on the black- 
board. She may also allow the children to draw them or to 
cut some of them out. Pictures will be helpful and also the 
different kinds of Christmas crépe paper. ‘The children may 
play that they are little Christmas symbols. This can be 
accomplished in the following manner. Before the lesson 
the teacher draws or cuts out representations of the symbols 
which she wishes to use. As she tells the story, she allows 
one of the children to pin on a representation of a symbol, 
after she has told about it. When all the symbols have been 
talked about and pinned on the children, the one wearing 
the bell makes believe he is the little Christmas bell and tells 
something about it. The others do the same with the symbols 
they wear. Another little more elaborate plan for this lesson 
is to have the children wear bands or surplices of the Christmas 
crépe paper upon which the different symbols are found. 
The few that cannot be obtained in the crépe paper may be 
easily illustrated so as to harmonize,

1 Christmas bells. 
Bells have been used from very very early times; they 
are closely associated with the life of man. The music of the 
bells tells of joy and sorrow; it expresses every feeling. We 
find golden bells described in the Bible, but these may have 
been ornaments which were worn by the high-priest among 
the Hebrews and made a noise something like our bells. 
Bells were used among the Greeks and Romans. The Greek 
sentinels were kept awake by them; a hat-shaped bell invited 
the Romans to their public baths. Large bells are said to 
have been first used in China. In that country, long before 
the birth of Christ, in every large town, what were called 
justice bells were placed above the head of the prince or 
governor. A rope extended from the bell out along the road, 
and anyone who had been wronged or needed help from the 
governor, could ring the bell. 
Church bells were not used by the early Christians, but 
they began to come into use long ago in Europe. Most of our 
churches have bells at the present time. Bells have been of 
great importance in the history of many towns, especially 
long ago in towns across the ocean; they have called the 
men to battle and they have warned the people of danger. 
Men, called bellringers, attended to the ringing of the bells; 
they were often very skilful and there are stories told to show 
the feeling of love some of them had toward their bells. 
(There are many other interesting facts about bells. 
Some of the different kinds of bells, according to their uses, 
are the following: the curfew; the storm bell; the gate bell; 
fire bell; small bell which used to be carried by the town crier 
and also by the five-o’clock postman; bells at sea. Some of 
the most famous bells are: “Great bell of Moscow”; ‘“ Great 
Tom” at Oxford, England; “Liberty Bell,” at Philadelphia.) 
This inscription is found on many old bells in Europe: 
“We rejoice with the joyous, we sorrow with the sorrowing.”” 
The bells which we see and hear at Christmas time are 
used to express joy. 
It is believed in some sections of Europe that bells may 
be heard ringing from under the earth at Christmas time. 
Those Christmas bells so sweetly chime, 
As on the day when first they rung 
So merrily in the olden time, 
And far and wide their music flung:

2 Christmas holly and greens. 
The hall was dressed with holly green; 
Forth to the wood did merry men go, 
To gather in the mistletoe. — Scott 
Green boughs have been used to express joy from very 
early times. In the Bible we find many references to them. 
The Hebrews decorated their homes with green for the feast of 
tabernacles; one of their writers says: “Go forth unto the 
Mount and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and 
myrtle branches . . . and there was very great glad- 
ness.” 
Holly is the emblem of peace and good will; therefore its 
use at Christmas is especially appropriate. The Persians 
say that the sun never shadows the holly tree. 
The evergreens that are most used are bay, rosemary, 
laurel, holly, and ivy. The Christmas rose and the Christmas 
thorn, which blossom at this time, are used in English decora- 
tions. According to tradition the holly should be placed inside 
and the ivy outside the house. In almost all countries where 
they grow, the holly and mistletoe are found in the Christmas 
and holiday decorations. The custom of using them was 
brought to this country from England. 
3 The Mistletoe. 
The mistletoe is closely associated with the holly. Long 
ago in England, which was then called Britain, the people 
had priests who led them in their worship. These priests 
were called Druids. The mistletoe, which grew on an oak 
tree, was considered holy. The oak was an emblem of strength 
and was sacred to Jupiter. Every year, when they heard the 
cuckoo sing, the Druids sent persons to find the finest mistle- 
toe that grew on an oak tree. They then went forth in solemn 
procession on the sixth day of the moon nearest the new year 
to cut the mistletoe from the sacred oak. The priest, dressed 
in white, cut the branch with a golden sickle and it was then 
placed in white linen cloth. Fairies were said to live in the 
thick foliage of the mistletoe and to protect a home in which 
a spray was hung. Thus from the very earliest time the 
mistletoe has been thought to bring good. It is associated
-P-A-G-E-105
106 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND/ACTION 
chiefly in our thought to-day with the old English Christ- 
mas. It used to be hung up in the hall on Christmas Eve, 
and a man had the privilege of kissing any girl caught under 
it, picking at the same time a berry from the bush. 
4 Christmas Star. 
“Tll sing, first in night’s diadem, 
Forever and forevermore, 
The Star — the Star of Bethlehem.” 
This symbol has reference, of course, to the story of the 
wise men and the star which led them to the birthplace of 
Christ. 
The Star of Bethlehem is the favorite Christmas symbol 
in Russia. The people in that country call the day before 
Christmas, when they are preparing for the festival, “the 
day before the star.” 
5 Santa Claus. 
Santa Claus or St. Nicholas is found in some form in nearly 
all countries; he is the universal friend of childhood. He 
is the personification of the Christmas spirit of giving and 
thus is true to the real meaning of the time. The children 
do not need explanations about him, but they like to hear 
stories and legends. They will all know the common ideas 
or legends associated with him, but many other interesting 
stories and exercises may be taken. 
One of the legends about St. Nicholas is the following: 
St. Nicholas was bishop of Myra, in Lycia. Among his 
people there was a nobleman with three daughters. This 
nobleman, although he had been rich, became so poor that 
he could not obtain food for his daughters. St. Nicholas 
heard how the poor girls were crying all day long, because 
they had nothing to eat and how badly their father felt since 
he could not help them. So St. Nicholas went to the noble- 
man’s house one night; looking through an open window he 
saw the father sitting alone weeping, and he threw in a hand- 
ful of gold. When the nobleman found the gold, he was very 
thankful and he gave it to his oldest daughter. 
Another legend gives us the reason why we hang up 
stockings at Christmas. This custom is said to have origi- 
nated from an incident in the life of St. Nicholas. On account 
of a severe storm, he once took refuge in a convent. The
-P-A-G-E-106
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION _ 107 
next day was Christmas and St. Nicholas preached a sermon 
to the nuns, which they liked so much that they asked him 
to come the next year and preach to them again. The 
second visit was also on Christmas Eve and before going to 
bed, St. Nicholas asked each of the nuns to let him take one 
of her stockings. In the morning the nuns found their stock- 
ings filled with sugar plums, which St. Nicholas had placed 
there, to show that he appreciated their hospitality. 
The children in Holland, on St. Nicholas Eve, spread a 
sheet upon the floor; then they form a circle round it and 
sing a song to St. Nicholas. When they see St. Nicholas 
coming, followed by his slave with a bundle of sticks, they 
run to greet him. If he finds they have been good children 
during the year, he throws fruits and sweet-meats on the sheet. 
Each child is provided with a little basket and they all merrily 
scramble for the good things. 
The stories, “The Symbol and the Saint,” by Eugene 
Field, and “The Original Santa Claus,” by Philip Youtz are 
good. 
6 Christmas songs or carols. 
“Carol, brothers, carol, 
Carol joyfully, 
Carol the good tidings, 
Carol merrily! 
And pray a gladsome Christmas 
For all your fellow-men: 
Carol, brothers, carol, 
Christmas Day again.” 
It is appropriate to have music and many Christmas 
carols, because the announcement of Christ’s birth was made 
to the shepherds through the song of the angels. In Germany 
the word used for a carol is Christmas Song (Weihnachtslied). 
While there are other carols besides those for Christmas, the 
word carol has come to be used especially for the songs of that 
season. In many countries boys used to go around the streets 
singing carols; we do not know when this custom originated, 
but we know it was popular long ago in England, Germany and 
elsewhere. 
(Under Christmas customs in England, the children 
should have been told interesting facts about the English 
carols and the Christmas Waits there. Under Christmas
-P-A-G-E-107
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
in this country they should have heard about the recent 
attempts to revive this custom in New York, Boston and other 
cities. Tell the children also that sometimes little children 
go around to each chamber door early Christmas morning 
in their own homes and sing a Christmas song, and that this 
is a beautiful custom.) 
An old German writer says that some of these singers 
long ago in Germany would make motions as if rocking a 
cradle when singing the hymn, ‘“‘The manger and the straw he 
bore.” 
Noel is the French word for Christmas; we often find 
this word in old Christmas carols. In connection with the 
carols, some French writers tell the following story: Mary saw 
some fine apples hanging on an apple tree. She asked Joseph 
_to pick some for her, but he refused. Then the branches of 
the tree bent down so that Mary could pick the fruit herself. 
When Joseph saw this, he attempted to get some apples also, 
but the branches returned to their former position. . Joseph 
then fell on his knees and asked Mary’s pardon. Something 
like this is told about a cherry-tree in part of the ‘“Cherry- 
Tree Carol.” 
Many of the French carols contain conversation between 
the shepherds and the angels in which the shepherds are urged 
to visit the manger of the Christ-Child. Sometimes the 
carols tell of gifts of birds, cakes, chestnuts, or grapes which 
the shepherds propose to offer. In a few of the songs, the 
birds and flowers are called upon to worship the new-born 
Child. The carols which were sung on Christmas morning 
all told of the birth of Christ. In the churches five hundred 
years ago, the scene of the birth of Christ was acted. The 
manger was shown; boys represented angels; Joseph and 
Mary were at the manger; priests as shepherds came to 
worship. A number of hymns were sung. 
7 Christmas Tree. 
Christmas is here: 
Winds whistle shrill, 
Icy and chill, 
Little care we; 
Little we fear 
Weather without,

The Mahogany Tree. — Thackeray
-P-A-G-E-108
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 109 
Germany is the home of the Christmas tree, but it has 
now become popular in many other countries. German 
emigrants brought the custom to this country. 
There are many legends of the origin of the Christmas 
tree. The French tell that a knight once found a tree on the 
top of which he could see a child with a halo around his head. 
The branches of the tree were covered with lighted candles, 
some erect and others upside down. The knight asked the 
Pope the meaning of this vision, and was told that the little 
child represented the Saviour, while the little candles were 
good and bad persons. 
We all know how beautiful the sky looks on a winter 
evening, when the ground is sparkling with snow and myriad 
stars are shining above us. Alone in the deep forest, this 
scene would seem even more wonderful. One Christmas 
night, it is said, a German who had returned home from a 
long journey, tried to describe to his wife and children the 
deep wood, the thousands of glittering stars in the sky, but 
he could not make them realize how beautiful it had looked 
to him. Suddenly he left the room. When he returned, he 
brought with him a little fir-tree. He lighted candles, which 
he placed on its branches. Some people say that this was the 
first Christmas tree. 
Another German story of the origin of the Christmas 
tree is that about Winfrid, told in Henry Van Dyke’s “The 
First Christmas Tree.” 
8 Poinsettia. 
Lately we find the poinsettia used largely in Christmas 
decoration. Its color and brightness are appropriate to the 
season. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE WoRK ABOUT CHRISTMAS MorE 
INTERESTING 
Decorations — General Suggestions 
The decorations for Christmas are of special importance. 
People are only beginning to realize the value of suggestion; 
a class of grownup pupils agreed heartily that they had more 
of the Christmas feeling if there was something in the room to 
suggest Christmas, and this must be still truer in regard to chil- 
dren.
-P-A-G-E-109
110 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
In order to be of value, however, these Christmas decorations 
should have a meaning and teach something to the children. 
They ought to suggest the Christmas spirit and be in harmony 
with the time. They may be very simple and inexpensive, 
since it is better to have few or none of the gaudy or boughten 
ornaments. The teacher may save some of her decorations and 
add to them from year to year. Laurel and evergreens, which 
may be obtained easily in the poorest rural school, and a little 
Christmas crépe paper, with Christmas pictures, will make a room 
very attractive. If possible, some plant should be in the room 
at Christmas time; a poinsettia, an easter lily, a red cyclamen, 
or an azalia are most appropriate, but if one of these cannot be 
obtained, some green plant may be placed in the center of the 
room. 
Decorations — Help of the pupils 
The decorations should belong to the pupils; for this reason 
they should be allowed, even if they are only small children, to 
make suggestions in regard to the arrangements and to help as 
much as possible. Nearly always the pupils can go out after 
laurel and greens, and can help trim the school-room with them. 
If there are older pupils in the same building, they may be asked 
to co-operate with the younger. Most of the pictures will have 
to be provided by the teacher; but the children may be asked 
to bring what they can. The children can make strings of bright 
colored paper and simple decorations such as are used in other 
countries for the Christmas trees; they can also make other articles, 
which illustrate Christmas customs among different peoples; and 
they can bring from home apples, nuts, etc., to be hung on green 
boughs or Christmas trees. If the decorations have been discussed 
with the children; if they have been told the reason for using each 
article provided, and it has been connected with something in 
their minds; if they have been allowed to make or provide some 
of the articles, or if they know the teacher has made some of them, 
the Christmas decorations will mean much more to the pupils 
than any that could be arranged, even with much more elaborate 
articles that it would be necessary to purchase. 
A Christmas Room 
If teachers have not enough material to decorate all the rooms 
for Christmas, those in one building may combine and have one 
room, called The Christmas Room. All work relating to Christ- 
mas, Christmas stories, and exercises should be given in this room. 
It will make the atmosphere of Christmas more real to the chil-
-P-A-G-E-110
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 111 
dren to have one room for Christmas, in which is illustrated the 
Christmas spirit and meaning, rather than to have a few meaning- 
less decorations in all the rooms. The variety will also please 
the children. 
Telling the Christmas Story 
The teacher should realize the special importance of suggestion 
in telling Christmas stories, where the impression made is often 
of more value than any mere memory of the facts that are told. 
Indeed there should be no review at all of most real Christmas 
stories. 
When telling the stories to little children there should be 
something of informality and the atmosphere of home. The 
children should be grouped about the teacher. The story is of 
course told in the part of the room where .the surroundings most 
suggest Christmas. It helps also in telling the story to have the 
teacher and the children have something about them that is asso- 
ciated with the time, if it is only to wear or hold a little spray of 
holly. 
Arrangement of Pictures and Articles about Christmas 
As large a collection as possible of selections about Christmas, 
poems, and pictures should be obtained and brought each year 
into the school-room. Many good pictures for Christmas may 
be found at the present time in magazines and even in some news- 
papers. The teacher should save these and add every year to her 
collection of pictures and articles in reference to Christmas. 
Whole Christmas numbers of magazines and books about Christ- 
mas may be brought into the school-room also. During all the 
time of the Christmas work, these pictures, etc., should be kept 
in the school-room, where the children can see them. It is a mis- 
take to suppose that only material which the children can entirely 
comprehend should be brought into the school-room; they will 
gain from seeing things, the meaning of which they are not old 
enough to fully understand. 
Some of the best pictures may be arranged on one side of 
the room. A good plan is to group pictures and articles according 
to some central thought or phase of Christmas, as for example: 
The Children’s Christmas; Christmas in Art; Christmas in Song; 
The Christmas Feast; Christmas in Story; The First Christmas; 
Christmas Poems; Christmas To-day or Christmas in America; 
Christmas in Other Lands or Christmas Around the World; The 
Christmas Spirit, etc. This may be accomplished by having 
a chart to illustrate the different phases of Christmas that you
-P-A-G-E-111
112. HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
wish to impress upon the children’s minds or in regard to which 
you have good pictures or clippings. Many other pictures 
should be grouped about these charts. The colored pictures may 
be placed upon a white background of cloth or crépe paper, and 
this background decorated with green sprays. A specially deco- 
rated Christmas table may be used for the other articles and 
Christmas magazines; the Christmas plant should be placed on 
this Christmas table. 
Methods of Illustrating Christmas in Different Countries 
One corner or part of the room may be taken to illustrate 
Christmas in Norway, another for Christmas in England, and an- 
other for Christmas in America or general Christmas pictures, 
charts, etc. Other countries may be chosen, as Germany or Hol- 
land, but those given here lend themselves, perhaps, most readily 
to this method of treatment. The other countries may be illus- 
trated by simple costumes worn by the children or in other ways. 
The suggestions given here have been tried in actual work with 
children and may be carried out in a school-room. 
The corner which represented the northern countries of 
Europe, as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, was decorated with 
laurel; a Christmas tree with simple silver tinsel decorations 
was placed in this corner. A candle was put in each window. 
Then a sheaf of rye for the birds stood just in front of the corner. 
A row of shoes might be provided, also, to illustrate the custom 
of placing the shoes of the family in a row on Christmas Eve, 
so that the members of the family will not quarrel during the year. 
When the children were talking about Christmas in the northern 
countries of Europe, they went to this part of the room. The 
Normal School pupil, who told the children about Christmas in 
those countries, was dressed in Northern peasant costume. 
In the front of the room, which represented England, there 
was a fireplace; this was made of wood, covered with red cambric, 
marked with white chalk to resemble bricks. The fireplace was 
decorated with red and green. Many boughs of holly, laurel, and 
other Christmas greens should be used to illustrate the character 
of Christmas in old England. . A window was painted on canvas, 
which was then nailed to boards; the boards were covered with 
the Christmas holly paper, with paper wreath and bell at the top. 
This window was hung just above the blackboard, and was used 
to illustrate the Christmas Waits singing at the windows in Eng- 
land. Instead of this, a window or other representation might be 
drawn upon the blackboard. A large log for the Yule Log; two 
tables, upon one of which was a large bowl representing the Wassail
-P-A-G-E-112
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 1138 
Bowl, and upon the other a representation of the boar’s head; 
two or three straight high-backed chairs give some idea of the chief 
features of an old English Christmas. The boar’s head may be 
an animal’s masque, painted and with tusks added. 
When the children were hearing about Christmas in England, 
they were dressed to represent the Christmas Waits. The cos- 
tumes were made from crépe paper; they consisted of a green 
surplice and over that a smaller white one. The children wore 
bands on their heads. These bands were green with a gilt star 
in front. Small harps may be carried by the Christmas Waits. 
(These harps might also be used in the decorations, if desired.) 
The frames for the harps are made either of wood or cardboard; 
they are then covered with white crépe paper over which mica snow 
is sprinkled. The strings are made of silver cord. A little edge 
of green may be added. 
The pictures and charts were placed along the other side 
of the room. The whole room was decorated with laurel, holly, 
and other green. A long table in the center of the room was 
covered with a white paper tablecloth; upon this table were placed 
poinsettia paper napkins, and a poinsettia plant. This table 
might be arranged with Christmas paper and cardboard articles 
to more fully illustrate the Christmas feast. 
For Holland the children wore little Dutch caps and girdles; 
while the one who was teaching them wore the entire Dutch 
costume. 
If Germany is illustrated at Christmas time, the Christmas 
tree should be especially emphasized. Legends of the origin of the 
Christmas tree should be told. A tree may be decorated to re- 
semble a German Christmas tree. The song, “Holy Night,” 
should be sung; perhaps it may be possible to get some one to 
sing it to the children in German. Sometimes cakes like those the 
Germans have at Christmas can be made or obtained in some way. 
That this method of teaching children interests them and is 
effective is shown by the following facts. Some of the children 
in a second grade, when they came into the room to have their 
pictures taken as Christmas Waits, without having had their 
attention drawn to the pictures upon the wall on one side of the 
room or being asked any questions about them, of their own accord 
picked out pictures of the boar’s head and connected it with 
the representation on the desk. Besides this, they connected 
a picture of the Christmas Waits with their costume and what 
they were representing. They were also interested and talked 
among themselves about other pictures and articles in the room. 
When we get children to teaching each other and talking about
-P-A-G-E-113
114 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
their work outside of their formal lessons with the teacher, then 
we may feel that we have really accomplished something. 
Variations may be made in this plan to suit different condi- 
tions, as for example the following: 
Instead of taking parts of the same room to illustrate Christmas 
in different countries, one room in a building may illustrate 
Christmas in Norway, one Christmas in England, one Christmas 
in America, etc. The children might be allowed to see and talk 
about the different rooms. 
Another method of accomplishing the same result is for the 
children in one room to study especially Christmas in some one 
country and the children in another room take another country. 
Then the children or certain selected ones from each room may 
go around to the other rooms and represent or tell to those chil- 
dren about certain Christmas customs in the country they have 
been studying about. For example, if a school was studying Eng- 
lish customs, the Waits might go around into the other rooms, 
singing the Christmas songs. Most of the Old English Carols 
mentioned in the list given later may be used in the first four 
grades. As the children go into the different rooms, they may 
make believe that they are really going from one country to 
another. 
Another variation would be for all the children from the differ- 
ent rooms to come together some day, and tell about and illus- 
trate in a simple manner some of the customs in the different 
countries they have been studying about. 
In a rural school the children might choose some country to 
study and illustrate in their room one year at Christmas time 
and the next year emphasize another country in this manner. The 
idea in these suggestions is not to try to illustrate many details, 
but to take in relation to each country the most typical or best 
worth remembering of the customs. 
Methods by which work of this character may be made valuable to 
the community as well as to the school 
One of the chief reasons for taking this kind of work is to 
reach and interest the foreign element in our towns and cities; 
also to remove prejudice between the different classes by showing 
that each race and nation has many good qualities and many cus- 
toms which are worthy of preservation. In order to accomplish 
these purposes, if there are children of foreign birth or parentage 
in the school, the teacher should try to interest them and their 
parents in this work. When Christmas customs in the country 
or countries from which they came are studied, they should be
-P-A-G-E-114
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 115 
encouraged to take part. If they have any articles at home which 
were brought from these countries and which would be of value, 
they should be asked to bring them to school to show to the other 
children. The co-operation of the foreign element should also 
be secured, if possible, outside of parents of pupils in the school. 
If those who have come from foreign countries to be citizens of 
our country will help — either by telling about the customs at 
Christmas time in their old home, by loaning articles of interest, 
or by singing for the children Christmas songs in their own lan- 
guage, it will make the work more interesting and also more 
valuable, not only to the pupils but also to the community. 
If simple Christmas exercises are given by the children, the 
teacher should make a special effort to have parents of foreign 
birth attend; if the exercises contain some reference to their former 
home and the Christmas customs there, they will probably feel a 
special interest in them. In communities where there is a large 
foreign element, a special entertainment might be arranged for 
Christmas, containing reference to each country represented in the 
foreign population. Some of the suggestions given for an enter- 
tainment under the title, “Everywhere Christmas,” may be adapted 
to this end, by adding exercises or changing it so that it will suit 
local conditions; or a more elaborate entertainment might be 
given, where an effort was made to gain the assistance as well 
as the attendance of the foreign part of the community. 
The final thought or impression in such an entertainment, as 
in all work of this character, should be the essential unity of all 
races and thus the inculcation of human brotherhood and good 
will. Christmas is an especially good time for work along these 
lines. If you are working among many foreigners, bring out the 
idea, that, as all nationalities have an interest and are united in 
the celebration of Christmas, so all these representatives of differ- 
ent nations have an interest in our country and are going to be 
united as citizens of this great republic. 
Another method by which this work may be made of value 
to the community is through the influence it may have in the 
revival of ancient customs, especially those of England, in the 
celebration of Christmas. Encourage the children to tell at home 
about these customs, and try to obtain the interest of parents 
and children. Because of their simplicity and joyfulness, and 
because all in the community can unite in the celebration, and 
thus be brought closer together, these customs are worthy of preser- 
vation. 
The story of how one of our western communities held a good 
old-fashioned English Christmas celebration is told in “Light Ye

Pictures 
Many good pictures can be obtained with which to illustrate 
this subject. 
Some of the Madonnas, and copies of the best paintings of 
scenes connected with the birth and life of Christ should be used. 
Also pictures of Palestine, of the people and the life in that country 
are needed. If good illustrations of Christmas celebrations or 
customs in other countries can be obtained, they will help to 
interest the children, but these pictures should be carefully chosen 
and the teacher should be sure they are typical and give the right 
impression. 
It is suggested that the teacher also show pictures to illus- 
trate Christmas to-day; Christmas among the poor; Christmas 
giving; and if possible, Christmas for the animals, etc. 
Try with the pictures to bring out especially the Christmas 
Spirit and Meaning. 
There is a page of good Christmas pictures in Woman’s Home 
Companion, December, 1912. 
' Suggestions for the arrangement of the pictures have been 
already given.

Games FOR YULETIDE 
Sniggle the Sprig 
“Sniggle the sprig” means to snare the sprig. Any small 
spray of green will do for the sprig. This is hidden and the chil- 
dren search for it. There is a prettily decorated pole to-which the 
sprig must be tied, when found. First, however, the sprig must 
pass through the hands of every player and return to the finder. 
When a player finds the sprig, he goes to his nearest neighbor,
-P-A-G-E-120
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 121 
hands it to him, and calls him No. 2, because he is the second one 
to have the sprig. This player passes it on to No. 3 and so on 
until all the players have had the sprig. Before the game com- 
mences everyone knows how many are playing, so by the number 
given him, a player knows when he is the last to hold the sprig. 
As the sprig is passed from hand to hand, the first name of 
the finder is also whispered. When the last player is given the 
sprig, he must pass it to the finder, who-at once runs to place it 
on the pole. All chase him, and try to get the sprig away from 
him, except the last player, who is not allowed to try. The victor 
is the one who is successful in placing the sprig on the pole. If 
it is the finder, he has a double triumph. 
Hunting Holly Leaves 
Holly leaves are cut from green paper. Many of these 
leaves are hidden and the children search for them. 
Star Ball 
A five-pointed star is marked out on the floor and a circle 
drawn around which touches its points. One player stands in the 
center; others are at each star point and on the circle in the middle 
between each point. 
The player in the center tries to throw the ball to the players 
on all the points and have it returned, before the players on the 
circle can roll the ball on the floor twice around the circle from one 
to another. If the boy in the center fails, another takes his place 
and the point and circle players change places. 
The Knight of the Whistle. (An ancient Christmas game.) 
Some one is blindfolded, and has a whistle hung on a cord round 
his neck. The whistle is arranged so that it will rest on the back of 
the player, who is blindfolded. The other players try to see if they 
can blow the blind man’s whistle without being caught. If anyone 
is caught, he must change places with the blindfolded person. 
Hitting the Christmas Bag 
The children would probably enjoy trying something like what 
the little children in Mexico do to get their Christmas gifts. 
These gifts are put in a large paper bag, which is suspended from 
the ceiling. Then the children are blindfolded and try to hit 
and break the paper bag. The children might be given wands 
wound with red crépe paper, with which to try and hit the bag. 
For the game, instead of gifts, some fruit, nuts, and candy may be 
put in the bag.

of Frolics,’’ by Mary Dawson and Emma Telford;

The First Christmas Night. (Tableau and Quotation). 
In the center of the stage have a little child representing 
the Christmas angel. The child angel should be dressed in 
thin white material, with long wings made of tarleton. Wreaths 
or sprays of green are around the angel’s head and shoulders. 
(See description in “‘ The Christmas Angel,” by HenryVan Dyke.) 
Curtains or screens must be placed in such a way that only 
the upper part of the child angel is seen; its arms are out- 
stretched as if flying, and the whole expression is one of intense 
joy. The angel should of course be raised as far as possible 
above the floor of the stage; behind the curtain or screens the 
little child may be held, if necessary, upon any very high arrange- 
ment that can be provided. 
At the right of the angel, three little boys, representing the 
shepherds, are kneeling. These boys are dressed in loose gray 
gowns; they carry shepherds’ crooks. The crooks may be 
easily made of wood; they should be covered with gray cloth 
or silver paper. 
On the left of the stage three boys represent the wise men. 
The wise men should wear loose gowns, but of richer effect 
than those of the shepherds; they have turbans or cloths wound 
about their heads. If desired they may carry tall staffs at the 
top of which are gilt stars. (For suggestions in regard to cos- 
tumes consult the description in “Ben Hur” by Lew Wallace. 
Pictures will also be of assistance.) 
One of the wise men is pointing in the direction of the little 
Christmas Angel, toward whom the others and the shepherds 
are looking adoringly. 
Before this tableau is shown, either the story, “The Christ- 
mas Angel,” by Henry Van Dyke, is told briefly, or else the 
following quotation is given: 
“Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have 
seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” 
“There were shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by

night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and 
the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were 
sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, be- 
hold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to 
all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David 
a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.” 
After the curtain is raised, some one from the wings says: 
“Tt is Christmas Day on Earth, and this is the Little Christmas 
Angel.” (From “The Christmas Angel,” by Henry Van Dyke.) 
Then the person from the wing, or else the wise men and shep- 
herds together say: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth 
peace, good-will toward men.” 
A song is now rendered. Let part of the song, at least, be 
given while the tableau is still shown. One of the following 
songs may be chosen:

II Christmas in Sweden, Norway and Denmark 
I The animals’ Christmas. 
Small children, dressed in white, are seen on the stage, 
decorating it with green in preparation for Christmas. A larger 
girl enters. (She may be from a higher grade than the fourth, 
or one of the larger and more advanced girls from the fourth 
grade.) This girl assumes the character. of a girl from Sweden 
or Norway; she is dressed in the peasant costume of the North 
of Europe. 
Norwegian Girl From my home across the sea, I have come 
to show you how we celebrate Christmas. The animals had 
part in the Christmas at Bethlehem, for the Christ-Child was 
cradled in a manger among the cattle. At midnight on Christ- 
mas Eve, the cattle still turn toward the east and worship him. 
‘They know when Christmas comes. This is why the people 
in my country always include the animals in their plans for the 
Christmas feast. You must get a sheaf of wheat; put it ona 
pole in front of the house; and throw out some crumbs or seeds 
so that the birds can have their Christmas. 
Children 
We will run and get the wheat! 
I will get some crumbs and seeds for the birds. 
I will help! So will I!
-P-A-G-E-123
124 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
(All run from the stage, except the Norwegian girl, who 
walks about looking at the Christmas decorations, or else 
sings a Norwegian Christmas song. The children return soon 
with the sheaf of wheat or some kind of grain. The Norwegian 
girl helps them to set it up at the side of the stage, which most 
resembles an entrance.) 
Norwegian Girl Now we have prepared a Christmas for 
the birds; and we must see about the other animals. Do any 
of you own cats or dogs? 
Two or three boys I have a dog. 
Girl I have a cat and a dog both. 
Norwegian Girl I will show you what we do for the cat 
and dog at Christmas time. (She brings from one of the wings 
a small table; places on the table a lighted candle, and then 
very near the candle a piece of sausage.) 
You want to give this to your cat or dog for their Christmas 
dinner, and see them try to get the sausage away from the 
candle without getting burned. It is lots of fun to see how they 
do it! 
(A description of this custom is given in “The Birds’ Christ- 
mas Carol,” by Kate Douglas Wiggin.) 
2 Receiving Christmas presents in Norway. 
(Suddenly, from behind screens or from the wings, a few 
packages are thrown toward the center of the stage. The 
children run to pick them up.) 
Children 
What can these be? 
Who do you suppose threw them? 
It must be Santa Claus. 
No, Santa Claus always comes down the chimney. 
Norwegian Girl The proper way to give Christmas gifts 
is to throw them in at the window. Open these and see who 
they are for. 
(The children pick up the bundles and open them. They 
may contain gifts for the children who pick them up; but it 
is a better plan to have them contain jokes, or simple gifts for 
guests. If the parents of the children are present at the enter- 
tainment, little gifts made by the children may be found in the 
packages; if the gifts are for the guests, they should be dis-
-P-A-G-E-124
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION § 125 
tributed at this time. If jokes are used, they should be either 
for some of the children, or for the teachers and superintendent. 
Let the children decide beforehand for whom they would like 
to have the presents.) 
3 How to prevent the family from quarreling. 
Norwegian Girl Now the most important thing still re- 
mains to be attended to. Do you know that in every house 
on Christmas Eve the shoes of every member of the family 
must be placed in a row? 
Children Why? 
Norwegian Girl So that during the year all will live to- 
gether in peace and there will be no quarreling. Now you must 
go and collect the shoes of all the teachers and pupils that belong 
to this school family and put them in a row, or there will be 
quarreling here next year. 
(Children run from the stage. Norwegian girl busies her- 
self about the stage. Christmas music may be introduced here 
if desired.) 
Some of the children soon return, bringing shoes of differ- 
ent sizes, from a very small pair of toy ones to the largest that 
can be obtained. A very large pair might be made of cardboard 
or construction paper. The large pair of shoes may be said to 
belong to a very small teacher or pupil. A pair of shoes might 
be covered and decorated with stars and bells or some other 
design for the drawing teacher. Other shoes may be covered 
also, using in certain cases the favorite colors of different persons. 
A pair of wooden shoes may be brought for the superintendent, 
the principal of the building, or some one else, with the statement 
that this person liked the wooden shoes that the people wore in 
Holland so much that he or she had decided to wear them in 
the future. All kinds of local hits may be introduced into this 
exercise. 
4 Preparing for Christmas in Sweden or Norway. (Tableau.) 
(This tableau may be used instead of the exercise described 
under 1, 2, and 3 for Christmas in Sweden and Norway.) 
The sheaf of wheat or rye is placed at one side toward the 
front of the stage. The window, which has been described, 
or some representation of a window, may be in the background. 
On either side of the window and around the stage branches
-P-A-G-E-125
126 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
of hemlock, pine, and laurel should be arranged. A few trees 
placed at the back and sides of the stage, will improve this 
scene. Branches of laurel, etc., should also be scattered about 
the stage. This is an outdoor scene, where persons in Sweden or 
Norway are getting the laurel, other greens, and the Christmas 
trees ready for the important festival. In the center of the 
stage are one or two Christmas trees; one of these trees may 
be already decorated, while two girls in proper peasant costume 
are placing silver tinsel or some other simple decorations upon 
the second. If more peasant costumes can be obtained, chil- 
dren may be seated around the stage, making laurel wreaths or 
other decorations for Christmas; or these children may be 
collecting green branches. If representations of snow are 
arranged on some of the green branches, it will give a pretty 
effect. Very simple peasant costumes can be used for the chil- 
dren.

near, with German Christmas cakes on it. A girl in German 
costume is seated by the Christmas tree. Other children, 
dressed in white, come from the wings and sing ‘Holy Night,” 
or else someone behind a screen sings the song. If it is possible, 
have the song in German. 
If it is desired to have this scene carried out more fully, 
an older girl and boy should represent the mother and father 
in a German home, while very small children take the part of the 
German children. The woman should be dressed in full skirt, 
bodice, scarf, and close cap. The little girls wear clothing 
somewhat like that of the mother. The boys wear blouses and 
full long trousers. First the German children dance around the 
tree; then the father reads or tells briefly the story of the first 
Christmas night. After this “Holy Night” is sung. If the 
teacher wishes to lengthen still more the German part of the 
entertainment and leave out or shorten other parts, different 
legends or stories about the origin of the Christmas tree ey, be 
given.

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ‘ACTION 127 
IV Christmas in Holland 
The scene where St. Nicholas visits the little Dutch chil- 
dren would make a pretty exercise. St. Nicholas should have 
a great bag filled with nuts and sweets; he is followed by his 
black slave, carrying a bundle of sticks. Simple girdles and 
Dutch caps made of cheese cloth will do for costumes for the girls. 
The boys should wear trousers, made somewhat like bloomers, 
only gathered at the ankles instead of at the knees. Loose coats 
or blouses should be worn. If wooden shoes cannot be obtained, 
have the children wear sandals, made the same shape as the 
shoes, but of light brown Galatea cloth, or cardboard. 
St. Nicholas Song, by Eleanor Amerman Sutphen. 
Instead of this exercise, a tableau and legend of St. Nicholas 
might be given. An older girl, in Dutch costume, has some 
little Dutch children grouped aul her, and tells them Bony 
St. Nicholas. 
V Christmas in England 
1 Bringing in the Yule Log. (Christmas Eve.) 
Either an outdoor or an indoor scene may be shown. If you 
wish the outdoor scene, have the stage arranged about the same 
as for the last tableau described under the Norwegian Christ- 
mas, except that the Christmas trees are omitted. Four boys 
dressed in old-time English costumes (red and green) stand in an 
attitude of pulling home the Yule Log, a great log with ropes 
attached to it. On the log, the court fool, represented by a very 
small boy, is seated. Other children may be bowing to the 
yule log, pretending to blow on silver horns, or in other ways 
expressing their joy. The costume for the court fool may be 
made in this manner. Use a dark blouse and trousers. Of 
orange cambric make a pointed shoulder piece and also a piece 
to go around the waist; upon each point sew a small bell. 
Make a cap that comes close over the ears, also sandals from 
the cambric and put bells on these. The boys who are bringing 
in the yule log wear short, full bloomers, capes, and small round 
caps. 
If an indoor scene is to be given, a large fireplace for the 
center background, green decorations, a few rugs and chairs 
are needed.. Other objects, as old candlesticks, the English 
coat-of-arms, cut from gilt paper and put on white cloth or on 
cardboard, old weapons, etc., may be added to make the stage 
look more like an old English manor house. A girl, dressed 
in a country or old English costume, may be seated by the fire-
-P-A-G-E-127
128 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
place if desired. The boys are in the position of dragging the 
log toward the fire. 
A chorus sings the Old English Carol for the Yule Log, from 
which a quotation has been already given. 
2 Under the Mistletoe Bough. 
The scene is the indoor one in an English manor house. 
A spray of mistletoe is suspended in the center of the hall. A 
very small girl, dressed as a woman, is seated at one side of the 
stage. A little boy goes up to her; she rises; he bows low and 
she courtesies. Then the boy leads the little girl to the mistle- 
toe; he bows and she courtesies again; he takes her hand and 
kisses her. After this he leads her back to her chair and they 
exchange bow and courtesy again. 
The little boy and girl should be dressed in old-fashioned 
costume. A full, elaborate old English costume, with wigs, 
would add to the effect;, but the scene would be pretty with 
simpler costumes. The girl could wear a long, full skirt of some 
flowered material, a kerchief, and either have her hair done 
high and powdered or else wear a cap. The boy might wear a 
white suit and have a sword and wig. 
(This scene might be used to represent a Colonial Christ- 
mas in Old Virginia instead of Christmas in England.) 
3 The Christmas Waits. 
Two slightly different ways in which this scene of the Waits 
may be represented are described: 
Little boys and girls may be grouped about a window, some 
kneeling and others standing. The representation of a window 
may be hung on a screen. Pines and green branches should be 
placed around, just enough to give an outdoor effect, but as if . 
near a house, not in the woods. The children sing two or three 
songs. 
Another way is to use the poem, “The Waits,” by Margaret 
Deland, for an introduction to the scene. 
First a quotation from the poem is given: 
“At the break of Christmas Day, 
Through the frosty starlight ringing, 
Faint and sweet and far away, 
Comes the sound of children, singing, 
Chanting, singing.”
-P-A-G-E-128
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 129 
Then the children are heard singing; they sing one or two verses 
of “The First Nowell.” 
Next another quotation from the poem is recited: 
“Careless that the chill winds blow, 
Growing stronger, sweeter, clearer, 
Noiseless footfalls in the snow 
Bring the happy voices nearer; 
Hear them singing.” 
After this quotation, the Waits are seen approaching from 
the rear or from behind screens; they march to the front of the 
stage, singing. The scene on the stage is an outdoor one of 
course. Lights may be arranged among the green foliage to 
give a pretty effect. Upper lights should be used as much as 
possible as this is supposed to be early in the morning. A 
simple costume for the Waits has been already described, or 
old English costumes may be used. 
Appropriate songs for the Waits: 
“God rest ye, merry gentlemen.” 
“Carol, brothers, carol.” 
“The Holly and the Ivy.” 
VI Christmas in America. (Christmas Eve) 
(Probably only one tableau would be given for this part of 
the entertainment, but a number will be suggested from which 
a choice may be made.) 
1 “The Important Ceremony.” 
An American home scene. A fireplace in the center back 
of the stage; a table with lamp and books on it; chairs, etc. 
A very small child in white flannel nightdress or pajamas is 
holding a red stocking which he is just about to hang in front 
of the fireplace. 
2 Watching for Santa. 
A very small boy in pajamas is kneeling, looking very 
eagerly up the chimney. 
Instead of this the poem, ‘‘The Christmas Spy,” by Helen 
Gray Cone in the Si. Nicholas, December, 1888, may be used. 
The picture accompanying the poem shows the tableau which 
might be given: A rather tall girl, in a long, white nightdress, 
standing with great dignity, and yet with a little fear in her 
attitude, near the fireplace.
-P-A-G-E-129
130 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
3 Playing Santa Claus. 
A box somewhat the shape of a chimney, covered with 
brick paper or with red cambric marked with white crayon to 
resemble bricks, should be in the center of the stage. A little 
boy, wearing a red cap trimmed with fur, is just peeking out 
of the make-believe chimney. 
(Other tableaux in reference to Santa Claus might be easily 
planned. The pictures found in magazines and papers are 
suggestive. The difficulties of a modern Santa Claus might be 
shown by having a very fleshy, small boy, carrying a great pack 
of toys represent Santa Claus; he is trying to get into a very 
small chimney. Praying to Santa Claus, or Going to Post a 
Letter to Santa Claus, are other tableaux which might be given.) 
VII “Everywhere, Everywhere Christmas To-Night” 
An exercise to give in conclusion in order to emphasize the 
meaning of the entertainment. 
A little girl, representing America, comes in first. She is 
dressed in white and has either a little silk flag fixed on her head 
like a cap, or wears red Christmas ribbon or a spray of holly 
in her hair. She carries a banner on which are the words: 
“Merry Christmas.” The following quotation from a poem: 
“Christmas is Sure to Come!” by Zitella Cocke (Youth's 
Companion, December 5, 1912) is given by this child: 
“Christmas is not a fair-weather friend, 
And every one has his share. 
And when Christmas comes to you and me, 
It is coming everywhere. 
All over the world the boys and girls 
In the lands of Christendom, 
Are looking and longing, as you and I, 
For Christmas is sure to come!” 
(The other stanza of the poem may be given if desired.) 
After this, other little children come dancing in from both 
wings and arrange themselves in a pretty group on either side 
of the first little girl, who stands in the center of the stage. 
These children are dressed in white also; they wear caps on 
which are the names of different countries; and they carry ban- 
ners which bear the words, “ Merry Christmas,” in the language 
of the country they represent. The banners are decorated so
-P-A-G-E-130
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 131 
as.to be both characteristic of the country represented and also 
of the Christmas season. The letters may be either painted 
on the banners, or cut from paper and sewed on. Appropriate 
colors are either white banners with gilt and red, or green letters; 
or dull gilt banners with green and red letters and decorations. 
The caps worn by the children should match in colors the 
banners. The words, “Merry Christmas,” in twelve different 
languages and some suggestions that might be of help in decorat- 
ing the banners are given in the Ladies’ Home Journal for 
Christmas, 1911. 
Additional children, a little taller than the first, may come 
dancing in and arrange themselves back of the smaller ones. 
These children wear white and carry the flags of the different 
countries. 
If a number of the peasant costumes of different countries 
can be obtained, still larger children may wear them; these 
children then take their places back of the children with the 
flags; or there might be a platform at the back or center of 
the stage arranged for these last children. 
Song: 
“Everywhere, Christmas To-Night,” by Phillips Brooks. 
(Christmas Songs and Easter Carols, by Phillips Brooks.) 
Rendered by all the children on the stage. 
If this entertainment is longer than is desired, Christmas in 
Palestine, or in any of the other countries, might be omitted; or 
the entertainment might close with the scene of the Christmas 
Waits, which would make a pretty ending. In that case the 
poem, “Christmas is sure to come!” and the song, “ Everywhere 
Christmas To-night,” might be given as an introduction. Where 
suggestions are made for more than one tableau or exercise 
under a country, it is not expected that the teacher would 
generally use more than one. 
It is easy to make other changes in this entertainment. 
If the teacher wishes to illustrate the Christmas customs in 
other countries, this may be easily arranged, although the most 
picturesque ones have been described, perhaps. 
Spain may be illustrated by showing the children hiding their 
shoes in the bushes for Santa Claus to fill with toys; or by the 
Spanish cavalier with his guitar singing a Christmas song. 
The midnight procession, led by a priest with a representa- 
tion of the “Star of Bethlehem,” might be used for Russia; or 
a procession of children all carrying stars and singing songs.
-P-A-G-E-131
132 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
Instead of this, the story of Babouscka might be told and illus- 
trated by a child in costume to represent Babouscka. 
If one wishes to give Denmark separately, a tableau, with the 
Christmas “‘Nisse,”’ represented by a very small boy, seated by 
a fir tree would be attractive. 
For Italy, children might bring onto the stage reproduc- 
tions of famous Italian paintings connected with Christ’s birth 
and life, and give a few simple statements in regard to them. 
The religious spirit of the celebration in the Southern or Latin 
countries of Europe and also in some of the countries of South 
America may be illustrated in the following manner: The stage 
is decorated with green; as many lighted candles as possible 
are placed about the walls, etc.,; a representation of a shrine 
or something which will just suggest an altar, or an arch, may 
be arranged in the background. A bell rings. There is a pro- 
cession of priests and monks, who station themselves in the 
background. Then children, dressed in white, come in and kneel 
on either side. Religious songs are rendered. The priests and 
monks wear long black gowns; mitres may be made for some 
of them from silver or gilt paper; the leader carries a tall cross. 
If the arch is used, the procession marches through it in back of 
screens as if going into a church, singing. 
Where there is nothing else especially good, national costumes 
or something else typical of the country, with Christmas favorite 
songs or a brief description of some belief or custom in that coun- 
try may be used. For example, a typical Irish costume might 
be used in this way; or Greek costumes, with representations of 
the Greek cross, would be pretty for song-singers. 
For Austria, the lighting of candles might be used; or the 
scene in the home, where the children take the lighted candle, 
stand on a stool, and say three times: ‘Christ is born.” 
Negroes, carrying banjoes, asking for ‘‘Christmas gift,” 
dancing and singing Christmas songs would illustrate Christ- 
mas in the old South.

CHRISTMAS 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
(Second) 
SyMBoL, LEGEND, Porm, Sonc AND Story: ALL IN THE SERVICE 
OF CHRISTMAS 
The stage is arranged with decorations of holly and green 
boughs; a few pine trees are placed in the background. Lights 
may be used among the green foliage. A small platform, covered 
with white and decorated with vines and green branches i is placed 
in the center of the stage. 
For this entertainment, it would be better to have five older 
children, with the younger ones; but if that cannot b- arranged, 
take five of the taller children from the Fourth Grade to represent 
Symbol, Legend, Poetry, Song and Story. The attendants are 
small children, although some of them may be from the Third or 
Fourth Grade. 
I Christmas Symbol and Attendants 
A boy represents Christmas Symbol. He wears a surplice 
of dull gilt, open at the sides and made with full, pointed short 
sleeves. The surplice comes to just above the knees; on the 
shoulders are loops of narrow red and green ribbon. Symbolical 
decorations of red and green are either stenciled on the surplice 
or cut out and pasted or sewed on it. This boy carries a dull 
gilt horn, from which red and green ribbons are suspended. 
He has also strips of cloth to match his costume, tied about the 
legs at the knee, and a cap decorated to correspond. 
Christmas Symbol is followed by attendants, representing 
each of the following: Chimes, holly, ivy, mistletoe, star, 
poinsettia, Santa Claus, Christmas tree. These little children 
wear surplices, over their white dresses, of crépe paper of the 
proper design, except in the case of the children representing 
the star, the ivy and the Christmas tree. For the star, a white 
surplice is worn, upon which gilt stars are placed. The child 
representing the ivy has a costume over which ivy or other green 
vines are twined; and the child for the Christmas tree is made, 
as much as possible, into a miniature fir tree. 
Christmas Symbol takes his place upon the platform, and 
with his horn pretends to direct his attendants. The attend-
-P-A-G-E-133
134 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
ants take proper position, and either give a dance, quotations 
or statements about the different symbols. 
Song: The Holly and the Ivy. By children carrying holly 
and ivy. 
II Christmas Story and Attendants 
Christmas story may be the teacher or one of the older 
pupils. She is dressed simply, in white, with a belt of Christmas 
ribbon, and in her hair a spray of holly. Little children, dressed 
in the same manner, accompany her. Story seats herself upon 
the platform; the small children group themselves about her, 
and she tells a Christmas story, choosing one of course which 
would be of interest to the audience. 
III Christmas Song, or Carol, and Attendants 
Co>g is dressed in Greek costume, white with green border, 
and carries a lyre, covered with green. This part may be as- 
sumed by a boy or a girl. Smaller children, dressed in white 
and carrying green lyres, accompany Music or Song. They 
form a pretty group and sing Christmas Carols. 
IV Christmas Poem and Attendants 
A tall girl in Greek costume, followed by smaller children, 
in white, with laurel wreaths on their heads. All carry rolls 
of brown heavy paper to resemble parchment. The older girl 
takes her position on the platform and gives a Christmas poem, 
or all give Christmas quotations. (The teacher would, of course, 
choose the poem according to the ability of the pupil.) 
V Christmas Legend and her Attendants 
Legend wears a loose robe, either white or dull gold. The 
trimmings are red and green, or gold and green. She has a 
tall, pointed cap something like a witch’s cap of gilt, with green 
points standing up around the bottom; also green butterfly 
wings, with gilt or red decorations, and a green wand with 2 
gilt star on the top. 
There are attendants according to the number of legends, 
which the teacher desires to have told. The two following may 
be used: 
A little girl is dressed in a yellow rose costume; the rose 
costume is described under Easter and Spring. This child 
tells the legend of the Christmas rose. (If preferred, the girl 
representing Legend may tell the legends, but itfis not quite as
-P-A-G-E-134
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 135 
effective as to have the small children in the proper costumes 
give them.) 
The other child wears a costume made with a foundation 
of white material, over which pieces of white crépe paper, cut 
to resemble feathers, are sewed. A cap is worn, made to re- 
semble somewhat the head of an owl. This child tells the legend 
of the white owl. 
Conclusion: Give a Christmas song; or a Christmas dance, 
with children carrying ropes of laurel.

CHRISTMAS 
A SHORT ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
(Third) 
THe CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL 
Song: - 
Why do bells of Christmas ring? 
Why do little children sing? — Eugene Field 
I Introduction: Quotation from a poem in the Wide Awake, Janu- 
ary, 1882. (Given by a small child.) 
“Wake from your sleep, sweet Christians, now, and listen: 
A little song 
We have, so sweet it like a star doth glisten, 
And dance along. 
Now wake and hark: all brightly it is glowing 
With yule-flames merry, 
And o’er it many a holly sprig is growing, 
And scarlet berry. 
But this it is that makes most sweet our story, 
When all is said: 
It holds a little Child, with rays of glory 
Around His head.” 
II Tableau 
“When our life is new, and our years are few, 
And our hearts to the Christmas time beat true,”
-P-A-G-E-135
136 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The stage should be decorated with green boughs, etc., in 
any simple attractive manner. An evergreen tree is placed in 
the center. A very small child, in winter clothing, is either 
standing by the tree, reaching up to grasp some of its branches; 
or is kneeling by it, with. arm around its trunk. The child 
is laughing. Some one from the wing of the stage gives the 
two lines quoted above. 
Song: Christmas Carol. Words by Minot J. Savage—Music by 
Howard M. Dow. — St. Nicholas, December, 1882. 
III Telling Santa All about It 
1 The letter to Santa. (Tableau.) 
If possible, arrange some representation of a mail box on the 
stage. A small boy, in winter outdoor clothing, is just about 
to drop a letter into the box. If the box cannot be provided, 
have the child hold out toward the audience a letter, which is. 
directed in large characters to Santa Claus. 
2 Song and tableau: “Jolly Old St. Nicholas.” 
A very small girl sings the song, and while she is singing, a 
little boy dressed to represent Santa Claus peeks out at her 
every. now and then from one of the wings or from behind a tree. 
It would be better if this could be arranged as an indoor scene, 
with a row of stockings hanging by the fireplace; in that case 
have Santa Claus peek at the little girl from behind the fire- 
place. By having two curtains to the stage this might be 
arranged, or by adding another song before that of “Jolly Old 
St. Nicholas” to allow for change of scenery. 
IV Christmas Eve 
1 Christmas Bedtime Brigade. 
Ten small children, dressed in white flannel nightgowns, 
march across the stage. They carry red candles and red stock- 
ings. A soft lullaby is played. The stage shows a home 
scene. 
2 Tableau: Christmas Eve. 
A woman seated in a rocking chair, with a very small 
child sleeping in her arms. 
While the tableau is shown, the poem, “Christmas Eve,” 
by Eugene Field, is rendered.
-P-A-G-E-136
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION § 137 
Songs: 
“Sing to Me.” 
Christmas Lullaby: ‘“O, hush thee, my baby.” 
(Tableau still shown during the songs, if possible.) 
V Christmas Day 
The stage is still arranged for a home scene., Children rush 
in, carrying holly, wreaths and long ropes of laurel, bundles, etc. 
They are laughing, dancing, and making a good deal of noise. 
As soon as there is an opportunity to be heard, the following quo- 
tation from a poem, “Christmas Day,” by Nora Perry, is given 
by some one below the stage or from the wing: 
“What the meaning of the clatter, 
What the bustle and the din?” 
The children turn, and say all together: 
“Why, what have you been about, then, 
Not to know it’s, Christmas day?” 
Song: “On Christmas Day,” by Julian Mount. 
VI “The Coming of the Child-King,” by John Clair Minot 
This poem is read, and two tableaux, arranged from the 
illustrations which accompanied the poem, when it was pub- 
lished, are shown. There should be a curtain shutting off part 
of the stage. In front of this curtain, a representation of a room 
is shown; a few chairs, table, and a fireplace are the furniture 
needed for this room. A woman is standing by the fireplace, 
hanging up a stocking. A boy is seated near. The boy looks 
up eagerly into the woman’s fac2 as the poem is read. When 
the last of the poem is reached, the woman kneels down beside 
the boy. 
At the conclusion of the reading, the curtain is drawn back 
to show the whole of the stage. Then a representation of a 
Hebrew mother, with her arm around a little Hebrew boy, who 
is standing beside her, is seen. The boy is looking questioningly 
up into his mother’s face. 
The Hebrew boy wears a loose garment, a cloth about his 
head, and sandals. Some thin material may be draped loosely 
about the mother to give the proper effect.

VII The Child-Angels 
Children are dressed in white and have tarletan wings to 
represent angels. These children may hold harps if desired. 
They are arranged in a pretty group on the stage. Most of 
these children should be very small; if necessary, there may bea 
few larger ones to help in the songs. 
One or more songs are rendered by the child angels. 
Songs: 
“Once a Little Baby Lay.” 
“Carol, Sweetly Carol.” 
“Angels Sang When Christ Was Born.” 
Another short Christmas entertainment might be arranged 
to illustrate Christmas in different countries by representing 
Santa Claus’ Helpers or messengers in different places, as Bal- 
thasar, “Befana,” etc.; or by showing the ways of obtaining 
gifts in various countries. 
By illustrating Christmas customs in England alone, a very 
attractive entertainment may be given. An entertainment of this 
character is described in “Historical Pageants,” by Florence M. 
Miller. (Pupils from the upper grades or older persons are needed 
to help in this entertainment.)

Object of the Lessons in January 
To continue the work begun in December, connecting the 
stories of customs in other countries with New Year’s as they 
were connected during the last month with Christmas. The 
children should be taught to understand customs which differ 
from their own in order that they may be sympathetic and 
broad-minded, most important elements in good citizenship. 
In connection with the story of the life of Benjamin Franklin, 
to emphasize the qualities of industry and helpfulness to the 
city and nation. 
OUTLINES AND SUGGESTIONS FoR Lessons AND STORY WorK 
A New YEAar’s Day 
I Story of January or the Roman god Janus 
1 Origin of the name January. 
a Long ago only ten months in the year. 
6 New Year did not begin at the same time as to-day. 
c Roman king, named Numa, said to have added two 
months to the year. 3€ 
d First month called Januarius oe January), after the 
Roman god Janus. 
2 Other names for this month. 
@ Very long ago, in England, called “the cold air month.” 
b Also called by Anglo-Saxons Wolf-Monat, because the 
wolves are'very hungry and savage during this month. 
3 Representation of January in old pictures.

b God ee (thus his name given to the opening of the 
year). 
c Two faces, one looking forward and the other backward, 
because he stood between the old and the new year. 
5 Sacrifices offered to Janus throughout January upon twelve 
altars. 
6 Roman celebration of New Year’s Day. 
a All wars and quarrels suspended during the first day of 
Janus or New Year’s Day. 
b Sacrifices on the altars. 
c White-robed processions to the Capitol. 
d Exchanging visits. 
e Giving presents. 
f{ Masquerading and feasting. 
II Custom of exchanging gifts at New Year's 
1 One of the oldest and most universal observances. 
(Still retained in France and the Latin countries.) 
2 Persians: exchanged presents of eggs. 
3 The Druids, in Britain. 
(Gave branches of mistletoe, cut the night before, from 
the oak tree in a forest dedicated to the gods. This 
mistletoe was considered sacred.) 
4 Formerly in England people gave New Year’s gifts 
to the king and queen. (Custom adopted from the 
Romans.) 
III New Year’s Customs in England and Scotland 
(New Year’s more important than Christmas in Scotland.) 
1 New Year’s Eve customs. 
a To unbar or open doors and windows to “‘let out the Old 
and let in the New.’ 
b Midnight service in the churches. 
c Ringing the church bells. 
d Hogmanay. 
Eve of New Year in Scotland known as Hogmanay. 
We do not know the meaning of this word, which is 
found in nearly every New Year rhyme. Bands of 
the poorer children, wrapped in sheets or disguised 
in some way, would go around from house to house 
on the last day of the year, singing:
-P-A-G-E-142
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 143 
“Rise up, gude wife, and shak’ yer feathers, 
Dinna think that we are beggars; 
We are bairnies come to play, 
Rise up and gie’s our Hogmanay” — 
or other rhymes. They are given a piece of oak 
cake, called their “hogmanay,”’ which the house- 
wives have been busy preparing for a number of 
days. After this, they mark with blue and white 
chalk in very large figures the number of the new 
year upon the door of the house. This mark is left 
on the door until the day after New Year’s. 
e First Foot. 
- This name is given to the first person who steps over 
the threshold of the house after twelve o’clock. No 
person, except a boy, must go out until some one 
has entered the house — this is “taking the New 
Year in.” Good or bad luck depended upon who 
was the “First Foot;” if a man entered first, it 
- was considered good luck for the coming year. 
Sometimes bands of young men or boys went around 
and there was much feasting and merrymaking. 
f Beliefs about the winds of New Year’s Eve. 
“Tf New Year’s Eve night winds blow south 
It betokeneth warmth and growth;

The bowl is carried from door to door by young women, 
who drink to the health of everyone in the house. 
Wassailing the orchards. 
The trees are sprinkled from the bowl, and boys and

New Year’s Day in France. 
a A very joyful holiday; the great family day. 
6 In the morning: Children first look at their gifts; then 
go to wish their parents a “Happy New Year.” 
c Everyone receives some gift. 
(Many New Year’s cards sent; sometimes one person 
will receive and send hundreds of these cards.) 
d In Paris children walk about the streets to look at the 
wonderful shop-windows. 
e A family dinner at night, to which all relatives are invited. 
New Year’s customs in Germany. 
a In many cities no man is allowed to wear a tall silk hat 
on New Year’s Eve. 
6 All try to be first in giving their friends the New Year’s 
greeting. If a friend comes up unobserved and 
says, “Prosit Newjahr!” (the greeting of the New 
Year in German), the other must pay a ransom or 
forfeit of some small gift. 
c In Frankfort-on-the-Main, at the same moment, the 
whole city wishes itself a “Happy New Year.” 
(Very old custom.) Family parties are held on New 
Year’s Eve; games, music, and stories are enjoyed. 
When the first stroke of midnight is heard from the 
dome of the cathedral, the windows of every house 
are opened, every person leans out, a glass held high 
in the hand, and all join in the salute, “ Prosit New- 
jahr!” (“Happy New Year!”’) 
d In the north of Germany: The Christmas merrymaking 
continues until the beginning of the New Year. 
If you go out about midnight on the last night of the 
old year, you hear a band playing ‘“‘Now Thank We 
All Our God.” You follow the direction of the 
sound, and come to a square where a large church 
stands and a crowd is assembling. The band stops 
and all is quiet. Then the clock in the tower strikes 
twelve. You are now greeted by the peal of bells, 
cries of “Prosit Newjahr!” the blowing of horns, the 
shining of red lights, Roman candles, and every 
expression of joy. 
4 New Year’s Eve in Belgium. 
The children strive to secure a “sugar uncle” or “sugar

Description given by Jacob Riis in ‘“‘ Yule-Tide in the 
Old Town.” (The Century Magazine, December,

6 New Year’s customs in rural Russia. 
@ Pea-and-wheat-shooters 
Boys at sunrise on New Year’s Day fill their pockets 
with dried peas and wheat, and go in bands from 
house to house. They go into the houses, which 
are never locked; throw the peas at their enemies 
and sprinkle the wheat upon their friends, if they 
find them asleep. 
6 Visit of the peasants to the house of the nobleman. 
The most beautiful horse of the village is decorated 
with evergreens and led to the house of the noble- 
man. The pea-and-wheat shooters follow. The 
nobleman’s family receive the guests, horse and 
all, in the parlor, and the children give them small 
silver coins. 
c Procession of animals. 
This consists of such animals as the ox, cow, goat, 
and hog, decorated with evergreens and led by 
children. Behind these, old women bring the barn- 
yard fowls, also decorated.

J Japanese form of Christmas tree. 
At New Year’s the Japanese plant on either side of the 
gate or doorway young pine trees and pine branches 
and bamboo. Eight hundred years ago the pine 
branches were used. The Japanese think that they 
represent courage and endurance, because they re- 
tain their leaves in cold weather. The bamboo 
grows very straight, so that represents truth and 
virtue. On the pine trees are hung oranges and 
other decorations. 
g Japanese and Chinese Santa Claus. 
The Japanese have a person, connected with the chil- 
dren, something like our Santa Claus. The little 
girls in Japan receive their toys in March and the 
little boys have a festival on the fifth of May. The 
little girls are given dolls and the boys have war- 
like toys and dress up like soldiers. These festivals 
for the boys and girls have been celebrated for 
hundreds and hundreds of years. The Chinese 
believe that their Santa Claus will bring them good 
luck for the coming year and they always hang up 
his picture in their places of business at New Year. 
V New Year's Observances in Our Own Country 
1 With the Dutch in New York. 
a Dutch a hospitable, joyful people. 
6 St. Nicholas, according to some accounts, visits the Dutch 
on New Year’s Eve. 
The following is the New Year’s Hymn to St. Nicholas, 
which the children, gathered about the large fire- 
place, with a bowl of “suppawn”’ and milk in front 
of each, sing: 
“Santa Claus, good holy man! 
Go our way from Amsterdam, 
From Amsterdam to Spain, 
From Spain to Orange, 
And bring these little children toys. 
“Saint Nicholas, my dear good friend, 
To serve you ever was my end; 
If you me now something will give, 
Serve you I will as long as I live.”

(Picture — Ladies’ Home Journal, January, 1906.) 
1 The Story of the Wise Men may be told again, giving some 
of the additions which were added later to the ac- 
count in the Bible. The Story of Baboushka belongs 
to this date. 
2 The Christmas celebration lasted in many places until 
Twelfth Night. The Christmas decorations are left 
until this date. 
3 In Spain, on the eve of Twelfth Night, the children leave 
their shoes near the chimney, and they believe that 
one of the three kings, Balthasar, brings the gifts 
which they find in the morning. 
4 Processions of children, carrying a large paper star il- 
luminated by a candle, in some parts of France, 
Belgium, and Holland. 
5 Twelfth Night Cake. 
(In England and France. Probably originated ia 
France.) 
a Cake, highly decorated, contains a bean. 
(Sometimes other things, as a pea and a clove, are baked 
in it.)

b Each person given a piece of the cake; the one who finds 
the bean is king for the evening. The king chooses 
a queen, or the one who draws the pea is queen. 
c The king directs the games which follow. In France 
the others mention everything the king and queen 
do. 
d The other persons draw papers, the ladies from a reticule, 
the gentlemen from a hat. These papers contain 
pictures and verses about characters which those 
who draw them are to impersonate during the even- 
ing. 
6 In England, at the close of the Twelfth Night celebration, 
Dickens’ Christmas Carol is read and the Christ- 
mas decorations are taken down and put in the 
fireplace. 
7 Additional points about the festivities. 
In the Twelfth Night feast immense pasties containing 
live pigeons or frogs were provided; Snapdragon used 
to be played at old Twelfth Night entertainments. 
A Twetrra Nicut Party 
If the teacher wishes to give a simple entertainment or party 
for the children, one in celebration of Twelfth Night may be easily 
arranged. The room should be decorated with holly and green 
branches. The children may march around the room in a pro- 
cession, the leader carrying a large paper star. For souvenirs, 
stars or small toy brooms in memory of Baboushka, who refused 
to leave her sweeping to search for the Christ-Child, would be 
appropriate. An imitation frog or pigeon pie would please the 
children; they might make the animals for the pie themselves. 
The Twelfth Night feast may be very simple refreshments or 
more elaborate as desired. Of course the Twelfth Night Cake is the 
most important feature of the occasion. After the king has been 
discovered, he may order the other children to imitate certain 
animals or do anything else he wishes; or he may choose other 
children to hold certain offices in his kingdom. Old English games, 
as Turn the Trencher, Blind Man’s Buff, Hunting the Slipper, and 
Snapdragon should be played. Last of all, the Christmas decora- 
tions are taken down and, if possible, burned, while the teacher 
tells the story of Dickens’ Christmas Carol.

The New Year’s Bells, by Kate Whiting Patch. 
(In the Plan Book — from the “ Favorite.”’) 
The Twelve Months (a Bohemian Story). 
(Given in “Fairy Tales,” by Edouard Laboulaye.) 
Facts about the year, the seasons, and the months may be 
made into another story or a lesson. One of the smaller children 
may represent the Little New Year, while other children repre- 
sent the months, each bringing some gift to the New Year. Instead 
of this, one of the children may assume the character of Mother 
Nature or Father Time. Little games about some of the New 
Year’s customs may be arranged by the teacher. 
“The Twelve Months” is a good story for the children to act 
in a Third or Fourth Grade. If the teacher desires, she can allow 
the children to cut out and make capes and hoods from Dennison’s 
crépe paper. These are of different colors to illustrate the differ- 
ent seasons of the year: white like snow for winter; green like 
grass for spring; gold like ripe corn for summer; purple like grapes 
for autumn. Some place in the school-room must be chosen for 
the peasant woman’s home; other parts of the room represent the 
woods. The children decide upon the different articles, which are 
needed in acting the story, taking what they can find in the room 
most like the object they wish to represent. Of course the chil- 
dren give in their own words the conversation between the differ- 
ent characters. 
In connection with this story, the poem, “The Twelve Little 
Brothers,” by N. G. Cone in the St. Nicholas, January, 1884, 
Vol. XI, could be used. The poem could be illustrated by twelve 
boys; or acted, the boys giving the conversation suggested by the 
poem.

Pictures 
Pictures of winter scenes, winter sports, etc., can be easily 
obtained by the teacher and used in the school-room during 
this month. The teacher should also use pictures represent- 
ing the different seasons, as “Autumn,” by Richard Andrew, 
because in connection with the New Year the children are 
told stories, which contain references to the seasons and 
months of the year. Pictures of Father Time, Mother Nature 
and the months, and New Year’s pictures are also appro- 
priate.

THE NEW YEAR 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
In Honor oF THE BIRTHDAY OF THE YEAR 
I The Watch: Tableau of a little girl, watching for the New Year 
An old-fashioned clock stands in the hall; a little girl is 
on the stairs, leaning over the banister, looking eagerly at the 
clock, The clock is just on the point of striking twelve, If de-
-P-A-G-E-159
160 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
sired, it may strike while this tableau is shown. If the tableau 
cannot be given with the little girl on some steps or stairs, she 
may be standing near the clock. One of the taller children 
should be chosen for this tableau; the little girl should wear a 
light thin dress, arranged to resemble an old-fashioned costume, 
with short waist, low neck, little puffed sleeves, and long full 
skirt. 
IT The Arrival: Tableau of the “ Little New Year” 
In the center of the stage a kind of throne is erected; a 
box or log with sofa pillows around it to give the desired shape 
may be used. Some white material is thrown over this; on the 
white material are representations of snow made from cotton 
and mica snow. Green boughs are placed around the throne 
and representations of snow on the boughs. On the throne 
stands a child representing the New Year, or giving the greetings 
of the New Year. If the New Year is represented, of course 
the child should be very small. A white garment, sprinkled 
with mica snow, and a white crown of imitation snow or of 
silver bells should be worn. The date of the New Year is 
placed on the child’s costume or shown in some other manner. 
If the child is to give the New Year’s greeting, a taller 
child may take the part. This child may wear a straight whole 
garment, reaching to the knees; the garment should be deco- 
rated with silver or red bells, or some appropriate design. Let 
the child hold in the right hand, held down toward the side, 
a long silver horn; and in the other hand, extended, a piece of 
parchment or heavy paper containing the season’s greeting. 
(Instead of a throne for this scene, the stage can be arranged 
so that the New Year is peeping out from a cave, or leaning 
forward from under a large red or silver bell.) 
Song: “The Little New Vear.” 
III Greetings to the New Year 
1 Ringing in the New Year. 
(Either sh of the following exercises or tableaux may be 
used. 
A procession of children, dressed in white and carrying silver 
bells, may march or dance upon the stage. A bell drill or dance 
would be pretty; or the child in the center of the procession
-P-A-G-E-160

might carry a New Year’s banner, step forward, and give the 
quotation: 
Ring out the Old, 
Ring in the New 
Ring, happy bells, 
Across the snow. — Alfred Tennyson 
(Other colors which are appropriate for the bells are gold 
and silver, with green or red. The children may wear silver 
or red bell hats; they may have small bells on their clothes or 
across their shoulders. If desired, the bells the children have 
may be real ones, covered with paper on the outside, so that they 
will ring as they enter. ) 
Instead of the procession, a tableau may be given. One 
large bell or a cluster of bells is suspended from the ceiling or 
held up on poles or in a kind of frame, turned sideways as if 
swinging. A little boy, dressed in the costume of an ancient 
bell ringer, stands in the attitude of ringing the bells. Little 
girls are arranged in a pretty group back of the bell ringer; they 
are blowing on silver horns. (These horns can be made of 
silver paper.) 
While this tableau is shown, the quotation given above may 
be repeated by some one from the wings; or a song sung. 
2 Welcome of the Night Watchman and the Children. 
Screens or a hedge are so arranged as to cut off the back 
part of the stage. Behind this little children are placed. A 
boy, in the costume of a night watchman, carrying a staff and 
old-fashioned lantern, walks to the center of the stage, stops 
and says: “Twelve o’clock and all is well!” Immediately 
the children lean over the top of the screens or hedge, each 
holding a glass extended in the right hand; they all say to- 
gether: ‘Happy New Year” or “Prosit Newjahr!” (The 
German “Happy New Year.) ‘The children must all look 
over the screens at the same moment or the effect is spoiled. 
Another way in which this may be given is to have the 
children come dancing in from the wings of the stage, and form 
a circle, taking hold of hands. Then either have a bell ring 
twelve times or the announcement of the watchman given from 
behind the scenes. After this, the children wish each other 
a “Happy New Year.” 
Another variation would be to have the children seated at a 
table when the curtain is raised. They rise at the stroke of 
twelve, come to the front of the stage, join hands, and give 
the salutation.

IV New Year's Customs 
Given by children from the fourth grade. Each of the 
following nationalities is represented by one of the children: 
Roman, Scotch, Dutch, German, French, Russian, Japanese. 
Simple costumes for the different nationalities may be arranged. 
The children give brief statements about the method of cele- 
brating New Year’s Day in the countries they represent. In- 
stead of the children, the teacher or some older person may give 
a talk about the customs in different countries, which the children 
illustrate. 
Song: “The New Year.” 
V Fruit from the Past Years 
A procession of the older children marches onto the stage, 
showing important dates. Each child is to give some quotation 
or statement explaining his date. Last a smaller child enters, 
with the date of the year that has just commenced, and gives 
some important anniversary that is coming in that year, as in 
1913 the fiftieth anniversary of the freeing of the slaves by 
Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation; 1914 the 
one hundredth anniversary of the composing of the song, “The 
Star-Spangled Banner,” and of the close of the War of 1812. 
VI A Vision of the Coming Years 
Under this topic different measures, which are advocated 
at the present time, may be illustrated. A few suggestions 
will be given. 
1 Woman Suffrage. 
This may be illustrated by giving a tableau, suggested by a 
picture, drawn by Rose Mueller: ‘“‘My ma says that women 
ought to vote.” This picture is found in the Si. Nicholas, Vol. 
XI, June, 1884. Three very small girls are seated under an 
umbrella, conversing. They appear to be drinking tea to- 
gether, as a tea-pot stands near. The children look very sober 
and wise, while one of them says to the others: “My ma says 
that women ought to vote.” 
2 Referendum or Recall. 
Boys are playing some game on the stage; it must be a 
game in which there is a leader. Suddenly a dispute arises 
concerning some action or decision on the part of the leader. 
One of the boys shouts: “Let’s have the recall!” 
Another boy says: ‘Shall we have the recall or the referen- 
dum?”

3 The Hope of Universal Peace. (A dance.) 
Small children dance onto the stage, half of them from each 
wing. These children are dressed in green and gold surplices 
or white decorated with green and gold to represent Hope. 
They may have garlands of green or flowers. They dance very 
joyfully. Any simple movements may be used for the first 
of the dance, as dancing around the stage, the two lines passing 
each other at front and rear, dancing in small and large circles, 
etc. Then the children cross the stage so that two, one dressed 
in gold and one in green ( unless the colors are combined in the 
costumes) stand together in such a way as to form two diagonal 
lines from the center back to the front sides of the stage. The 
children standing together put their arms about each other and 
take positions indicative of peace. A little girl, dressed in 
gray, and carrying a representation of a dove, enters and takes 
position in the center between the two lines. This forms a 
final tableau of Peace. 
Song: Ring Out, Wild Bells—Tennyson—W. W. Gilchrist. 
THE NEW YEAR 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
(Second) 
SHOWING WHAT THE YEAR Brincs Us 
I The Seasons 
As an introduction, the following quotation from “The 
Changing Year,” by Lloyd Roberts, is given: 
Summer, autumn, winter, spring — 
Back and forth the seasons swing; 
When the clean sap climbs the tree, 
When the strong winds groan and flee — 
Dance the daisies on the hill-tops 
To the thin tune of the bee. 
When the white frosts cross the threshold, 
Summer softly shuts the door. 
(Repeat the first two lines.)
-P-A-G-E-163
164 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
One child or four children together give this quotation. 
They remain on the stage until after the Seasons have entered 
and spoken. If there are four children, they should be dressed 
alike in some pretty costume. Motions may be used in connec- 
tion with the quotation. 
Instead of the above quotation, the poem, “Bare Boughs 
and Buds,” by Celia Thaxter, may be given to show the changes 
made by the different seasons. 
1 First season: Winter. 
A child, representing Winter, gives the following quota- 
tion from a German poem: “Winter”: 
Old Winter is a sturdy one, 
And lasting stuff he’s made of; 
His flesh is firm as ironstone; 
There’s nothing he’s afraid of. 
His home is by the north pole’s stand, 
Where earth and sea are frozen; 
His summer-house, we understand, 
In Switzerland he’s chosen. 
Now from the North he’s hither hied 
To show his strength and power; 
And when he comes we stand aside, 
And look at him and cower. 
The little girl who represents Winter should be dressed in 
outdoor winter clothing; she may wear real furs; or her clothing 
may be trimmed with imitation fur or with imitation snow and 
icicles. 
2 Second season: Spring. 
A child, representing Spring, gives the following quotation 
from “Spring Song,” by Paul Lawrence Dunbar: 
A blue-bell springs upon the ledge, 
A lark sits singing in the hedge; 
Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air, 
And life is brimming everywhere. 
What lark and breeze and bluebird sing, 
Is Spring, Spring, Spring!
-P-A-G-E-164
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 165 
The child illustrating this season wears a thin dress and 
carries some of the earliest spring flowers. She may wear also 
a broad-brimmed hat or a wreath of fresh green leaves on her 
head. If this entertainment is given in the winter, imitation or 
green-house flowers and leaves will have to be used. 
3 Third season: Summer. 
A child, representing Summer, gives the following quotation 
from Edmund Spenser: 
Then came jolly Summer, being dight 
In a thin silken cassock, colored green, 
That was unlined, all to be more light, 
And on his head a garland well beseene. 
If this quotation is used, the child should be dressed in a 
surplice of very thin green material, and should have a wreath 
of flowers on his head. The surplice may be held up in front 
full of flowers, or the child may carry a bunch of roses or a 
basket of flowers. 
Another quotation which may be used for Summer is the 
following from “Midsummer,” by John Townsend Trowbridge: 
Oh, softly on yon banks of haze, 
Her rosy face the Summer lays! 
(This last quotation should be given by a rosy-cheeked 
little girl.) 
4 Fourth season: Autumn. 
A child, representing Autumn, gives one of the following 
quotations: 
Then came the Autumn all in yellow clad, 
As though he joyed in his plenteous store, 
Laden with fruits that made him laugh, full glad, 
That he had banished hunger. — Spenser 
The world puts on its robes of glory now; 
The very flowers are tinged with deeper dyes; 
The waves are bluer, and the angels pitch 
Their shining tents along the sunset skies. 
— Albert Laighton
-P-A-G-E-165
166 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The child is dressed in yellow and carries fruit, if the first 
quotation is used. If the second is given, the child’s dress is 
decorated with autumn leaves and he carries either branches of 
autumn leaves across his back, or fruit, as desired, or according 
to what can be obtained by the teacher. Artificial autumn 
leaves may be used, or festoons of red and green. 
(Instead of the above method of representing the seasons, 
tableaux or other exercises may be used. The teacher can easily 
think of many simple tableaux, as for illustration: Winter —a 
small boy seated on or kicking a very large snowball, which 
may be made by using cotton and mica snow. Spring and 
Summer — any pretty flower tableau or scene. Autumn — 
a Hallowe’en or harvest scene. Pictures which are suggestive 
for arranging tableaux and poems which may be used are found 
in the St. Nicholas for 1884 and 1885. _The Autumn and Spring 
numbers of the Youth’s Companion will also be found helpful.) 
II The Months 
An Old Rhyme, “The Months,” given in “Days and Deeds,” 
compiled by Burton E. Stevenson and Elizabeth B. Stevenson, 
may be used to illustrate this topic. 
(Under another exercise, additional ways of representing 
the months are given.) 
Very small children, from the first or second grade, should 
give this exercise. The children come upon the stage one by 
one; each gives the part referring to one month. 
1 January: brings a large snowball; comes on rubbing his 
hands. 
2 February: brings an umbrella. 
3 March: with hair and clothes as if the wind had been blowing 
them comes rushing on the stage. He carries a little green 
leaf or a plant just started. 
4 April: brings a bunch of daisies. 
5 May: brings a picture of some lambs or a little toy lamb. 
6 June: carries a great many flowers. 
7 July: has flowers also. 
8 August: carries a few corn stocks. 
9 September: has some fruit. 
10 October: has a basket of nuts. 
11 November: scatters autumn leaves as he comes. 
12 December: has a Christmas stocking, or something else 
suggestive of Christmas.
-P-A-G-E-166
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 167 
III The Holidays, or the Days We Celebrate 
Either a procession of the holidays, or a tableau or exercise 
for each holiday may be'given. If a very simple easy enter- 
tainment is desired, the children may carry or wear the name of 
the holiday; each child then gives a quotation appropriate to 
the day he represents and there is no attempt to have the chil- 
dren’s dress illustrate the holidays. In this case songs con- 
nected with a number of the holidays should be introduced. 
Instead of illustrating a number of holidays, one tableau and 
one quotation about holidays and their importance might be 
given; quotations about the holidays can be found without 
difficulty. 
Suggestions for a Procession of the Holidays 
1 The arrangement of the stage and the action. 
Have the year shown in the background in some way; 
the figures might be placed in among evergreen. The words, 
“Our Holidays,” or “The Days We Celebrate,” should also 
be shown in some manner. A banner, displaying these words, 
may be carried to a small platform or kind of throne in the center 
of the stage by a small child; or the words may be placed among 
the decorations of the stage in the form of an arch. After the 
motto has been shown, the children representing the holidays 
march upon the stage. If they are to give statements or quo- 
tations about the days, they come to the front of the stage one 
by one, give the statement, and then arrange themselves in a 
semi-circle on either side of the child holding the banner, or 
in some pretty way about the motto. 
2 The costumes. 
a New Year’s Day. 
A co tume suggestive of “turning over a new leaf” 
might be used. Leaves can be cut from green paper and pinned 
all over the child’s clothing. Pin a number together so that 
they will flutter as he walks; the child may also be turning some 
of them over as he comes on the stage. 
b Franklin’s Birthday. 
A boy, carrying a very large kite, or having a costume 
covered with small kites. Instead of this a Revolutionary cos- 
tume may be used. 
c¢ Lincoln’s Birthday. 
A boy made up as a negro; he may wear an old-fashioned 
tall hat, if one can be obtained,
-P-A-G-E-167
168 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
d Washington’s Birthday. 
A boy in Revolutionary suit; if the whole suit cannot be 
obtained, a white neck-piece, buff flannel bands around the 
coat, epaulettes of gilt paper, a wig, sword, and low shoes with 
gilt buckles will do very well. The wig can be made by sewing 
rolls of cotton upon crinoline, shaped to fit the head. 
e St. Valentine’s Day. 
Child, dressed to represent Cupid, with red heart- 
shaped wings, and hearts arranged on the costume. The child 
carries a gilded bow and arrows, and pretends to shoot with 
them. 
f St. Patrick’s Day. 
A boy dressed in minstrel’s costume; he may wear a long, 
dark cloak or a surplice of the shamrock paper, or a more elabor- 
ate costume. Other suggestions are given under March. The 
boy carries a large drum, upon which he plays as he enters. 
g Easter. 
A child, dressed in white, carrying an Easter lily. She 
may also wear a hat in the form of a lily. 
h April Fool’s Day. 
A child dressed in the costume of a court fool. Pointed 
pieces of yellow cambric may be cut to go over the shoulders 
and around the waist; a close cap and pointed shoes may also 
be made from the cambric. These should all be decorated 
with small bells. 
t Arbor Day. 
A child, dressed in green, carries a very small tree or a 
small shovel. 
j April 19th. 
A child represents Paul Revere; he wears a Revolu- 
tionary hat and long black cloak. He carries an old-fashioned 
lantern. 
k May Day 
A girl, representing the May Queen, dressed in white 
and crowned with flowers. She has a small stick from which 
ribbons are suspended. 
1 Memorial Day. 
A boy carrying a flag and basket of flowers. The boy 
may wear soldier costume or not, as desired. 
m Flag Day. 
A little girl in flag costume; or in old-fashioned costume, 
carrying a flag like the first United States flag adopted by Con- 
gress. For a flag costume the child may wear a white dress, 
decorated across the front with thirteen red and white stripes,
-P-A-G-E-168
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 169 
and a blue band around the head upon which are thirteen stars. 
Or instead of this, red stripes may be put on the white skirt, 
and blue with circles of stars in it draped around the shoulders 
a waist. Dennison’s crépe paper in the flag design may be 
used. 
n July 4th. 
A child, in red costume or in red surplice and bell hat, 
carries a large bell. Instead of the bell, the child may carry 
an enormous firecracker in his arms. Of course this would have 
to be an imitation firecracker. The boy should be very small. 
o Labor Day. 
A boy in overalls, carrying a dinner pail or some tools. 
bp Columbus Day. 
A boy in sailor suit or in a suit of the time of Columbus. 
The child may carry the Spanish flag or a globe. 
q Thanksgiving. 
A child in Pilgrim costume, carrying vegetables or an 
artificial turkey. 
r Christmas. 
A child in long cape trimmed with ermine and wearing 
a crown trimmed with representation of snow or ermine on his 
head. 
3 Statements which the children may give. 
; a It is time, good people all, for you to turn over a new 
leaf. 
b I am sorry to say that a good many children do not 
know that my birthday comes on the 17th of January. 
c Freedom to the slaves. The birthday of our deliverer 
should always be celebrated. 
d May I be your valentine? 
e It is, L assure you, very gratifying to me, to find that my 
birthday, on the 22d of February, is still celebrated by the people 
of the United States. 
f No snake can endure the sound of my drum. 
g Everything — trees, .flowers, etc.—sleeps for a little 
while; but to-day tells us that they all awake again. 
h “What fools these mortals be!’ (William Shakes- 
peare.) 
i The sun is hot. Plant a tree and the leaves shall give 
you shade. 
j Awake! awake! the British are coming. 
k “I’m to be queen o’ the May! I’m to be queen 0’ 
the May!’’— Alfred Tennyson :
-P-A-G-E-169
170 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
1 To-day, upon each soldier’s grave, place flowers and the 
flag of his country. 
m My birthday is the 14th of June. 
n “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto all the 
inhabitants thereof.” Or give this statement: The birth of a 
new nation we celebrate to-day. 
o “Any work, perfectly done, brings joy.” 
bp The discovery of a new world. 
q Give thanks to God for the bountiful harvest. 
r King of all hearts, the greatest of the days we cele- 
brate. 
(This last statement about Christmas may be given by the 
child who holds the banner or by someone from one of the wings. 
If the child with the banner is used, he should advance to meet 
Christmas and lead him to the throne.) 
Some of the special days given above may be omitted or others 
substituted. 
For a final tableau, the seasons and months may come upon the 
stage with the holidays. Then as a conclusion a quotation or 
poem expressing thankfulness for the year, and a song should be 
given. 
Songs appropriate to the different seasons, or for the different 
holidays, add much to the entertainment. 
Songs for the different seasons 
Winter Song, by E. H. Miller — G. W. Chadwick. 
Miss Snowflake’s Party. 
The Daisy, by D. Batchellor. 
“Awake!” said the sunshine. 
The Song of the Rain, by F. D. Allen. (Jenks and Walker.) 
A Disappointment, by Louise Stickney (Schumann arr.) 
Fall Song: Autumn Leaves. 
If the teacher desires to have, instead of the procession, tableaux 
or exercises for some of the holidays, selections may be made from 
the suggestions given under other months. For illustration, the 
teacher might use the Flower Dance for May Day; the tableau 
of the salute to the flag which is given under June for Flag Day, 
etc. To add variety to the entertainment, the story, “Everybody 
Surprised but Addie,” in the Wide Awake, April, 1882, might be 
told by a child in the fourth grade for April Fool’s Day. Also 
a harvest scene and some of the games of Old New England husking
-P-A-G-E-170
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 171 
parties; or a Twelfth Night scene might be illustrated. A pro- 
cession of children, dressed appropriately, singing as they came, 
might be used either for Easter or for Christmas. 
A different exercise, illustrating the Months alone, may be 
prepared by using some of the following suggestions: 
1 The Months as Sprites. 
A procession of twelve maidens, carrying lighted candles 
of different colors for the different seasons. The same colors 
are used for the tall, pointed caps and pointed shoes which 
the sprites wear; also for the names of the months. 
2 Little Sunbonnet or Flower Months. 
Have the children wear sunbonnets, made of cardboard 
covered with crépe paper of different colors or with different 
flowers on it to illustrate the months. Sashes to match may be 
used. 
3 Mother Nature and the Months. 
This may be illustrated by a tableau in which Mother Nature 
is represented by an older girl. Little children are grouped 
about her, either offering her something or doing something 
characteristic of one of the months. 
Instead of this tableau, an exercise prepared from the pic- 
tures and conversation between Mother Nature and the Months 
given in the back of each month of the St. Nicholas, Vol. XI, 
1884, may be used. 
4 Sports of the Months. 
Material which is suggestive for an exercise along this line 
may also be found in the Si. Nicholas, Vol. XI 1884. 
(Last of each month.) 
With an exercise of this character, use songs which have 
reference to special months, as the following: 
Good-morning, Sweet April. Modern Music Series Manual. 
Lady Goldenrod — M. L. Baum — C. S. Conant. 
October’s Party — Susan Coolidge. (Action may be used 
in connection with this song.) 
Quotations suitable for each month will be needed. The follow- 
ing are suggested:

In the same way an entertainment might be prepared, by simply 
choosing songs, poems, tableaux, etc., suitable for each season in 
turn. Appropriate decorations for each season would then be 
used. A Winter Entertainment might also be prepared, which 
would be appropriate for January.

GENERAL HISTORY 
PLAN AND OBJECT OF THE WORK 
It is of great benefit to tell the children in the first four grades 
a few stories in general history as well as to take the work in con- 
nection with American history and the chief holidays of the year. 
The stories should be selected with care and with a definite plan 
and object in mind. 
The plan is to arrange the work in general history so that the 
children will have some knowledge of the nations of ancient times, 
which have most influenced the civilization of to-day. To tell 
many stories, selected at random and without any connection, 
is confusing to the child and fails to give any preparation for 
the gradual understanding of the unity of history, and the growth 
and development in the life of man. As a basis for the choice of 
history work and stories we would suggest that the teacher con- 
sider the following points in the order in which they are given: 
First, the interest of the child; second, the value at the present 
time in training the child toward good citizenship; third, his- 
torical importance. In selecting stories which will help to develop 
good citizens, we would weigh the question whether the story 
emphasizes some element, as obedience to law, perseverance, 
loyalty, etc., which is needed in the character of a good citizen 
to-day. By historical importance, is intended all that goes to 
make the absolute value of the story in the eyes of the best judges. 
Under this point, we would consider, then, the importance in the 
history of the world of the people with whom the work or story 
is connected, the importance of the event about which the story 
tells, the historical knowledge which may be gained, and also 
whether the knowledge of that story will be necessary later in 
understanding history and literature. 
Some of the benefits which the children may derive from the 
work in general history are the following: 
The child’s interests and outlook upon the world are broadened. 
His historical vocabulary and knowledge are greatly increased; 
and he is much better prepared for the history work in the upper 
grades. It is surprising how much children can learn from stories, 
if they are told in a simple, interesting manner. 
ur
-P-A-G-E-177
Iv HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The child learns from this work that people have lived under 
very different conditions from the present. He should be taught 
to take a sympathetic attitude toward these people, and to im- 
agine himself under the same surroundings. In this way, sym- 
pathy and imagination are developed; these are two of the most 
important elements in the right appreciation of history. 
Some of the stories connected with the history of Greece and 
Rome are among the best which can be found to use in the train- 
ing for good citizenship along the lines already mentioned. They 
are also very good for reproduction work and thus help to develop 
the power of expression. Some of these stories may be acted 
successfully. 
These stories and talks with the children about the people 
of different countries and their customs will be found of great 
help when the teacher wishes the children to take part in exercises 
and perhaps imagine that they represent different nationalities. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR ARRANGEMENT OF STORIES IN THE GENERAL 
History Work 
It is suggested that the teacher may find the following work 
of value as a basis for general history in the first four grades: 
I The Life of Pre-Historic Peoples 
Cave-dwellers, Lake-dwellers, and Indians. 
(In the First and Second Grades, the teacher would consider 
with the children chiefly the life of the Indians. Then 
in the Third and Fourth Grades, she might connect the 
Cave-dwellers and Lake-dwellers with the Indians; and 
lead the children to see that long ago all people lived 
under these primitive conditions.) 
The following topics might be taken about primitive man: 
1 Surroundings — Forests, swamps, plants, animals. 
2 Homes — Caves, houses over lakes, tents. 
3 Life and occupations — Defence against animals, hunting 
and fishing, care of flocks and herds, primitive farming. 
4 Food and clothing — Fish and flesh of animals, fruits and 
berries. Skins of animals for clothing. 
5 Weapons of stone; bow and arrow. (How these weapons 
were made.) 
6 Important points in the advancement of man. 
a Use of fire. (How it was produced in these early times.) 
b Pottery. (Study of how the first dishes were made.) 
c Invention of boats. (Study how the first boats were made.)
-P-A-G-E-178
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION NG 
In order to make this work of most value to the pupils, the 
teacher should lead them to imagine themselves living as these 
early people were and then have them try to work out the problems, 
in regard to homes, food, clothing, etc., which these early people 
had to work out. Through play, also, the children must recreate 
as far as possible, the atmosphere appropriate to the period. To 
aid the child’s imagination in this work, the teacher should give 
good descriptions. If possible, the children should be taken 
outdoors for the consideration of some of these topics. They 
should be taught to notice the different shapes of stones and for 
what purposes they would be valuable. Some of the different 
kinds of wood and their uses may also be noticed.

III Greek History Stories 
(Third and Fourth Grades.) 
1 Grecian Myths. 
Europa; Cadmus; Theseus; Hercules; the story of the 
Golden Fleece; and the Trojan War. 
(These stories may be told in the Third Grade and re- 
viewed in the Fourth; or part of them may be taken - 
in the Third and part in the Fourth Grade. Perhaps 
the children can read some of these myths for them- 
selves.)

a Country of Greece. (A little diagram or map interests

6 Description of Athens and Sparta.

4 Story of the life of Alexander the Great.

While the children in the Third and Fourth Grades can under- 
stand and enjoy much of the history connected with these stories 
it will be only when special care is taken in selecting the points of 
interest to the children and in telling the story. The topics here 
indicated are to be used only as suggestions. The children as well 
as the stories should be carefully studied. The teacher should 
endeavor to make these stories of long ago real to the pupils and to 
have them take something from each story of permanent value. 
The methods and plans for the work should be varied at different
-P-A-G-E-180
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION vu 
times, until the best plan is found. Begin with that which is familiar to the children, let them act out the stories when possible, 
plan to keep the imagination active, and to make the children think. 
If the teacher will keep the matter in mind, everything which comes 
to hand will suggest ways of increasing the interest. Special care 
should be taken to impress those facts and principles in Greek and 
Roman history which are of value in the making of character, as 
the Greek love of beauty and the Roman love of country. The 
work should be carefully reviewed by means of questions, familiar 
conversations, and reproductions, until the teacher is sure the 
children have mastered the essential points.

vit HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
Then out spoke brave Horatius, the captain of the gate: 
“To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late. 
And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, 
For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods? 
Hew down the bridge, sir consul, with all the speed ye may; 
I, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play. 
In yon straight path a thousand may well be stopped by three. 
Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with 
me?”

LOCAL HISTORY 
History of the town or city in which the school is situated. 
Visits to places of interest connected with this early history. 
Stories of the first settlers of the place, their homes, etc. 
Object : 
The object of this work is to show the children how history is 
made; that is, how we discover the facts of history in the records 
that we have of what has happened in the past. Also to 
connect what should be most familiar and interesting to 
them with their other history, and to increase their interest 
and knowledge of affairs in their own community in order to 
develop a better civic spirit. 
Method 
This work must be carefully done in order to be of any value. 
Some points in local history may be taken in the Fourth or 
Fifth Grades. The children should be encouraged to find out 
as much as possible for themselves. The teacher should 
tell stories connected with the early history of the place. 
Many pictures and articles illustrating life in the early days 
should be shown. Places of historic interest, any tablets 
which have been erected to mark special points in the town 
or city, etc., should be visited and studied.
